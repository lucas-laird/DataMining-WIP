1027,2010-09-10,0,dn_ipqbm7_jUz5X3rDez_A,"Todd English's latest is incredible!  Great atmosphere (cool bar, outdoor pub tables, red leather booths inside) and our server (Paul) was phenomenal.  Expansive bar and a huge selection of beers on tap, including some very enticing samplers.  No blue cheese olives for the martinis (bummer, since that's a signature drink at Olives).  Prices are high, as to be expected in City Center.  The seafood is the freshest I've had in all of Vegas- it's flown in every morning.  Their live bar comes by the piece- east and west coast oysters and delicious jumbo shrimp cocktail served on a gorgeous platter over ice and garnished with sea plants.  The duck buns were incredible- the meat was sweet and tender and the buns were like soft little pillows!  I've been dreaming about these ever since and I plan to come back for them!!  Lobster rolls were delicious- sweet rolls lightly buttered and grilled, then stuffed with lots of sauteed lobster meat.  The coleslaw they were served with was the best I've had.  The moules frites (mussels) came in a rich, delicious curry broth and even the fries were perfect.  We also had the pickles (three house-made varieties, thought they came with bottled mustard and not stone ground).  The smoked salmon quesadilla was incredible- with buttered yukon golds and fried capers.  They also do a fabulous bread pudding that is served with fresh whipped cream, salted caramel ice cream, and a delicious toffee sauce.  The bread pudding itself was the perfect texture and is one of my favorite desserts in all of Vegas.  This place rules, I cant wait to come back and try the carvery menu- chose your meat, sauces and bread.  Definitely recommended.",dEgO4_n8thLMbG1dKfFMHg,2,1,5,N7WCcnQgXuYF_ITflWyhOA

Overall on both trips I found the food to be good - a modern take / update on simple pub food - this trip had the shrimp as an appetizer - good but I also feel like any place on this level shouldn't screw this up - and the New Amsterdam - that burger was great - good flavor with a lot going on.

My only complaint for this place was prices of some items - I get that its in Vegas and on the strip prices can be a little inflated, but $8 for a PBR and $9 for a Bud Light seems a little steep especially considering I was able to order a great craft beer for just a few dollars more rather than having a BUD....",jM9YePr12W78DZyFq-l-Sg,0,0,4,TKjVy9Rtgh0nBPbgWrqMDQ
14235,2016-06-03,0,dn_ipqbm7_jUz5X3rDez_A,"For an overall experience,  I would give this place 4 stars based on a combination of happy hour and regular items. You definitely need to get the lobster rolls. They don't skimp out on the amount of lobster meat inside the rolls.  The coleslaw is fresh and the buttery rolls complement the juicy and flavorful lobster chunks. 

The beer pairing for the lobster is Blanche de bruxelles and complemented it very well.  It reminds me of a more subtle Blue Moon which has no aftertaste at all.  For a smaller than pint serving at 14.00, you should definitely hit this place up for happy hour where all their beer selections are 1/2 off. They have an extensive list of beers to choose from. 

The footloong dog is huge and comes with chili and onions for an additional 2.00. It can easily be shared between two people. I've had better hotdogs at Nathan's. 

The sliders are exactly what you get. The lobster rolls are definitely worth making a visit for.",pWFKkBvezfyQ0kIM1XlG7Q,0,0,4,2IUvGY9LxCppbLigPgURfw

We started off wanting drinks, but they have run of the mill beer for double what it costs in casinos. $9 for a PBR, really? $11 for a Corona? $14+ for any acceptable beer.. Crazy.

I got the fish and chips. It came with slaw (which was good), a few pieces of flavorless fish, mushy thick fries, and a couple of sauces. This mediocre collection of fried food can be yours for the low price of $25. I personally would rather have fish sticks from the supermarket.

My girlfriend got steak tacos for $20, and she liked them. They had a good flavor and came with some Mexican rice that wasn't great. 

I'm not cheap, but please save your money and eat at any of the other amazing places in Vegas. If you want to blow some cash on great food head over to Joe's.",JHQnThGZ5z5CH08ctCPJoQ,0,0,2,HjpMJBxGpkb5jdUCb4o3ww

29031,2010-05-27,1,dn_ipqbm7_jUz5X3rDez_A,"My girlfriend and I went to this Public Urban Bar (come on guys, just call it a pub) after reading Matt C's glowing review on here, mostly because the lure of nickel PBR's could not be ignored forever.

After finally figuring out how to get into the damn place, we took our seats and ate some food (and drank some real beer) until 9PM, when the PBR party officially started.

I tried the roast beef sliders, which were about as tasty as the roast beef sandwiches at Arby's. That is, worth about three bucks. They couldn't be simpler, either. Roughly four inches of roast beef between two buns with (I think) some sort of aioli thrown in so it at least has some sort of flavor. I love roast beef as much as the next guy, but these sliders were just too much. These suckers cost me thirteen smackers, which they are definitely not worth. The nickel beers (if you can call PBR beer) were definitely nice, but the mediocrity of my meal stuck with me.

I'm not going to get into details about my adventure today trying to recover the debit card I left at the P.U.B. last night, but let me give you a piece of advice: Never deal with the City Center security / lost and found department if you can avoid it. I'm pretty sure it's the entire staff's first day, every day.

Between the moderate inaccessibility compared to other pubs in town, the extremely high prices on everything (seriously, nine bucks for a Blue Moon?), and the unremarkable food, I can't recommend this place unless you've got friends who really insist on meeting up there -- or you go on a Tuesday night for some really cheap (in multiple senses) beer. I hear the actual burgers are actually quite good though, so maybe I'll try one soon. I'll have to save up for a while first, though.",UYACF30806j2mfbB5vdmJA,1,0,2,ucGHnN0F89Kk6ezhKls3og

53916,2012-06-25,0,dn_ipqbm7_jUz5X3rDez_A,"This place was a surprise for me.  My wife and I had just arrived in Vegas, were starving, and went into this place without much thought.  We were pleasantly surprised by the good drinks and great food.  We ended up coming back here again for lunch later in our trip.  

The shepherd's pie here is excellent, with lots of flavor and great texture.  It's not the typical browned, ground meat you get in most other places.  The fish and chips are great too, although not particularly different from any other good fish and chips place you might go to.  The lobster sliders are good but I thought they skimped a bit on the lobster.

One thing any of-age person has to try is Todd's sssSweet Tea.  This bourbon cocktail is amazing, and very dangerous.  I could drink these all day, and will probably come back here on my next Vegas trip just to get this drink.",uOmGw_dh7nwRI43drtsGWQ,1,0,4,3Y8vxHlD1pgPqGdyVHXF2Q

They seated us right away (we were expecting to have to wait), and our waiter, Alex, came to us within the first 5 minutes of being seated. This pub is awesome, for all you beer loving drinkers, they carry about 48 different types of beer on tap and have a pretty large list of wines as well.

I had the bison burger, my boyfriend had the chicken roasted pot pie and our friends had a shepards pie and the swordfish enchiladas. The bison burger was really good, it had the perfect amount of blue cheese and spice. The burger had a kick and it was so good and perfectly cooked! The chicken pot pie was really good as well. My boyfriend said that the vegetables were really fresh. It was well balanced and the chicken was cooked just perfectly. The swordfish enchiladas were yummy and the fish was very fresh, the salsa was homemade and flavorful. The shepards pie did not disappoint either. The mash potatoes were creamy and the flavor was excellent. We ended up having to wait for our food a bit longer (and we thought it was standard because we had ordered items that would take a while to make), but our waiter had told the manager about it and she came by, apologized for the wait (it really wasn't long at all) and offered to have us pick out drinks on the house.

It's not ""cheap"" food, but what you do get for what they charge is good. We skip the carvery section (pricey) and just order the rest of the menu.

If you like pretzels, theirs are good. Best dip is the ware rarebit appetizer. Lobster rolls are great, the mini pastrami sandwiches are a win as well. They do a burger with pastrami added, it's also good.

The real treat is the shepards pie. the beef inside is flavor packed and it's just a big hot cast iron skillet of comfort food. The skirt steak with ribeye chili on top is also flavorful and a definite winner.

They do a really good twist on a manhattan called The Excellent Crystal. Oh and they have a ton of beers on tap as well. Honestly if you wanted to sit and just eat bar food, drink draft beer and watch sports, i'd go here (and often do).  If you make it to dessert, the bread pudding is delicious.

Now the bar games...

Around the bar you'll find up lit small hourglasses. They are set to 7 second. Order any pint (Guinness is really the best bet for speed). With hand on glass, but glass on bar, they flip the hourglass, you drink. no side drafting beer out of your mouth and nothing left over and you get the pint for free.

Before you get excited, you can only do it twice I believe. Which brings us to the next game, Make a shot, take a shot.  They have a couple basketball hoops on teh bar (it's easier now than it used to be), sink the nerf ball, free shot. They have made this easier.

For the main course I ordered Fish and chips. It arrived as a whole fillet on top of a mound of french fries. It was accompanied with tartar sauce, ketchup, and malt vinegar cream sauce that was to die for. Overall the fish was good but i would get another item next time.

As far as food is concerned, I didn't try much because the summer heat in Vegas suppressed my appetite, but what I did sample was tasty. Some of the best Buffalo wings I've had, and only a buck per wing during happy hour. On my second visit I had the delicious chicken parmesan sliders & a few raw oysters (only $2 each all day long) flown in fresh from Vancouver.

Beer selection was the best I've seen in Vegas, although very overpriced with craft beers going for around $12/pint. Go during happy hour and they're much more reasonable at half price. I drank Dogfish Head 90 min IPA (my favorite beer) and the Speakeasy IPA which was solid. FYI, glasses of wine are also 1/2 off during happy hour.

The food was good, and of course priced high. I got the lobster rolls which were so widely lauded. I was disappointed that the main ingredient was butter, and it overpowered every other flavor, ESP the lobster. I rubbed all the butter off a piece of lobster to be able to taste it, and it was honestly not very good without its butter bath. Disappointed that a supposedly high end restaurant cannot make a good lobster dish without applying a butter solution to mask any other flavor. The chili burger was actually really good.

262961,2010-05-26,0,dn_ipqbm7_jUz5X3rDez_A,"Nickel PBR night at Todd English P.U.B. can safely be called the busiest event going on at City Center on a Tuesday night. This should come as no surprise. NICKEL PBR. Need I say more? 

I went here for dinner and beer with my boyfriend and some friends. I was surprised by their selection of beers. Not quite as large as Yardhouse, but impressive nonetheless. I ordered a Kronenbourg 1664, which is a usual of mine. I had some trouble ordering from the menu because nothing was exactly how I would like it and I prefer not to be one of those ""Can I get the bacon cheeseburger, no cheese, no bacon?"" kind of people. So I got the double cheeseburger, sans the double. The best way to judge a restaurant, particularly a casual restaurant, is to have the burger. If they can make a good burger, then I can confidently order from the rest of the menu. P.U.B. did not disappoint. The burger was delicious; seasoned properly and cooked to perfection. Despite being over-sized, the bun was awesome. To top it all off, the seasoned skinny fries were fantastic. 

Once the beer, burger, and fries were gone, it was time. Bring on the PBR. Let's just say, you get what you pay for. Who says you can't buy anything for a nickel anymore? One nickel can buy you a plastic cup filled with the beer that has been an American icon and beloved by Midwesterners for decades. May not have lived up to my Kronenbourg 1664, but it made for good times. 

Overall, I enjoyed the experience at Todd English P.U.B. The prices were typical Las Vegas Strip prices and apparently low for City Center. The staff still had that ""I don't know what I am doing"" attitude, but our waiter was decent. I can't say that you'll be able to find me there every Tuesday night, but I'm sure that was not my last visit. If you want some slightly overpriced, slightly better-than-expected burgers, and nickel PBR, Todd English P.U.B. is what you want.",TfG7QdAKhRkcTV7zzRfYIQ,0,1,3,MpUeVaXexVl8AbKBe_Hh_A

Although that is a hilarious sentiment, its something I can stand behind when it comes to the food at this restaurant. Yuuuummy!

There is nothing I didn't like - from the pork buns to the sliders to the Lobster poppie (for which I am currently Jones-ing).

I stayed at Aria a few years ago, but hadn't been back since so I decided to walk over and see what is new or had changed in that time.  It was around dinner and I was wander around the reception area and I spotted a restaurant that looked relaxed and casual in the far right corner.  This happened to be Todd English Pub, and is the place I decided to have dinner Sunday night.

I entered Todd English Pub around 8pm and the place was packed.  You needed reservations for a table, but since it was just me, I sat at the bar.  I was quickly greeted and given a menu by my server.  I checked out the drink menu and was thrilled to see that they had Strongbow Cider on the menu, so I quickly ordered one.  Price for the cider was $11 per glass, but I love cider so it worth it.  

I perused the menu for a while, not sure if I should order a Pub meal like Sheppard's Pie or a burger.  I finally made up my mind and went with Chicken Tacos ($16), the description made them sound flavorful and delicious and didn't let me down.  The chicken tacos come 3 to an order with a crock or rice and beans.  The shells were good; soft shells and held up well against the moist chicken meat and salsa.  The chicken was so moist and well seasoned, I thoroughly enjoyed every bite of it and could have eaten even more.  The rice and beans were presented mixed in a crock and were good with a bit of spice as well.   After two glasses of cider and the tacos, my bill totaled $41.  A bit steep, but it's LV so not too bad comparatively.

The service at the bar was great.  I wish I would have gotten my servers name, but he was attentive and quick to make sure I had what I needed.

After looking at several options for holding an informal reception, we came across the PUB.  Obviously being from out of town, and not being able to actually see/experience the venue beforehand, was a big concern.  Upon our arrival we decided to stop by and see what the place was like.  As you may imagine the place is typically ""English Pub"" décor, but with the added grandiose Vegas touch (exceptionally well kept, clean, and omitting the dark/grubby British aspects, not a bad thing).  The General Manager, John Lanata, graciously met with us and spent a great deal of his time providing assistance and making sure that all of our questions were answered.  He also invited us to try the menu for lunch, to which we were not disappointed.  I ordered the Lobster rolls while my wife requested the daily special, a Turkey club.  Both items were absolutely exceptional (see attached).  I am a huge lobster fan and this did not disappoint.  There was plenty of meat, butter, and seasoned just right, complementing and not obscuring one of natures more subtle flavors.  My wife's selection was also exceptional (see attached) moist and tender, with smoked bacon that was pretty amazing.  

The bar has an great selection of beer, wine, and hard-spirits, particularly Bourbon (many of which have been personally selected from small Distiller's that I never even knew existed).  

Perhaps the most important aspect of our visit were the people working there... Everyone was polite, friendly, and ready to help (Exactly as it should be in Vegas).  Mr. Lanata, was obviously involved with his staff and took the time to speak with them often.

For our Reception, We had the game-area set-aside for our guests with Hors D'oeuvres, Well- , beer, and wine drinks.  The game area also has self-serve draught-beer handles, which several of our guest enjoyed.  This small area was perfect for us as it easily held our small party (~25 persons) on an intimate level, but at the same-time keeping us within the public atmosphere of room.  It was a really nice casual setting, perfect for our needs.  The wait-staff were extremely attentive, providing us  with plenty of Hors D'oeuvres and drinks at all times.  All of the Hors D'oeuvres were fantastic (Pot Stickers, Ahi-Tuna, Shrimp Skewers, Sliders, and Brie and Bacon sandwiches)  Overall, if you are looking for a fun, casual setting in Vegas you would be hard-pressed to do better!

I suggested here because I had seen it from time to time while going through the Crystals center on my way to/from Aria, the Cosmo, etc. 

We were happy to see we came during their late night happy hour. We were starving so got some $1 wings to start. I am not a HUGE wing person, but these were very delicious and although some may find $1/wing ""pricey"" I thought they were a good deal? They give you real blue cheese too.

My bf and I decided to share their carvery platter (lamb) which was amazing and came with some tasty sauces. We had several friends meet up with us and our waitress was very patient considering we had all had quite a few cocktails and the constant seating kept changing as our group grew/shrunk.

However, the chopped salad my bf and I also shared was awful and we actually sent it back because it was so bad (basically ""chopped"" lettuce and... 1 tomato? That is all I remember being on it). Luckily our waitress took it off the bill so no worries-- but one of our friends got a Caesar and wasn't thrilled with it either, so maybe skip the salads all together and just get the unhealthy bar food and meat ;)",nSkfeG0zuC_8cker0KDDEQ,0,0,4,aOV5hT87A5Perk2K42RHkg

Prices are a bit steep, though this is a celebrity restaurant with ""fancy"" pub food.

The honey and I ordered some ""specialty"" ales, and there is a decent selection of beers available.  Spoiled by the Bay Area craft beer culture though, I didn't think that Todd English PUB really deserves to bill itself as a specialty beer kingdom..

The honey and I ordered the dirty chips, which seemed like such a great idea when we ordered them and first started eating them, but quickly turned to regret.  Everyone's descriptions of the dish are spot on--great when the cheese hasn't congealed (with the added bonus of chicken livers!), but not so great when everything turns cold and soggy.

The service was friendly and accommodating.  The hostess cleaned up and prepped a booth for us after we specifically requested one, and our server was cheerful, upbeat, and didn't chase us away after we lingered a bit too long.

All in all though, this seems like the (upscale, smoke-free) place to grab a beer and a basket of fish and chips and relax.  I would try this place again, but without the dirty chips.",84ZF5bk5IIbZ0sdA_EJyDA,0,0,3,F9DLE8vdPHndl0qAB5lS7g

The food is basic yet playful gourmet.  Don't come looking for molecular gastronomy, because this place doesn't take itself that seriously.  Who wants that at noon on a Saturday anyway?  Not this girl!

The food is pub fare, yet creative.  Gluten and dairy free options are clearly marked, if it matters.

First of all, the beer list describes a $9 PBR--yes, no joke, $9 for PBR-- with the following:  ""light to moderate body, nice even crispness, clean palate throughout with a great wrap-up of dryness in the finish."". How about:  ""the stuff we drank in college because it was only $2.""  Now that's an accurate description, and I wouldn't have to pay $9 for it.

To their credit, if you go after 10, beers are half price--so you'll end up paying what a beer actually should cost. 

We ordered some wings, because, after all, every good pub has good wings.  Ten minutes later, a server walked past our table with a plate of wings--no reason for us to believe they were specifically ours--and he started arguing with other servers. After a couple of minutes, he threw the wings down on the table next to ours and said, ""congrats, you got free wings.""  Another server then asked us, ""did you guys order wings?"" ""Yes, we did,"" we replied.  At this point, the guy picks up the wings from the table he had just given them to ""for free,"" mutters something about us, and throws the plate down on our table.  What did we do to make him so angry?  All we did was order some wings...!

Burger was fine...wings and fries were all mediocre. 

Overall, service was horrible.  Nearly the entire staff seemed disgruntled.     We were waited on by four different people, none of whom seemed like they wanted to be there.  It took twenty minutes and three requests just to get the bill.

We got to the PUB around 2 to enjoy a late lunch. The restaurant still had a fair amount of energy even though it was about 30% occupied. 

Now to the food. We had difficulty deciding on our meal as many items on the menu looked appealing. I opted for the lobster rolls with house made chips and my wife ordered Grichebactom (grilled cheese with brie an bacon) and mac and cheese. The lobster rolls were incredible. A warm buttery roll with the richness of the lobster were a perfect match. My wife's Grichebactom was good, but not great. We couldn't help ourselves and ordered desserts. I took down the bread pudding topped with salted caramel ice cream and caramel sauce while my wife ordered the chocolate cream pie topped with toasted marshmallows. The desserts were definitely a 10 out of 10. 

We were pleased enough with our first meal that we decided to go back for round 2. I ordered the dirty chips (topped with blue cheese, bacon and fried chicken livers) and duck buns, while the wife ordered the sliders. The dirty chips were amazing. I didn't know what to expect with the fried chicken livers and they were cooked perfectly. This was a delicious combination of salty, creamy, crunch and richness. The duck buns were ok. As I dug into the chips first, the juice from the duck made the buns soggy which was not the greatest mouthfeel.  This was not the foods fault, but mine for taking my time. My wife's sliders were tasty, but nothing extraordinary. We opted not to partake in dessert on this visit.

The best item is the Brown Butter Lobster Rolls. These are delicious, and they don't skimp on the lobster meat.

The rest of the items are just ok (standard pub fare) and quite frankly overpriced for what you get.

The bread pudding had potential and some interesting ingredients but just wasn't set up when I got it after quite a long wait.

683364,2011-12-04,1,dn_ipqbm7_jUz5X3rDez_A,"Well, that was disappointing.
The 4 of us are looking for a spot for dinner in Vegas. We've been wanting to try Todd English for over a year so we decide to meet up there. 
I walk in and stand for at least 5 minutes without a hostess being at the front. Eventually both hostess come back together and I am not joking both ignore me as I am standing 2 feet away, with a line behind me. Thankfully the (executive?) chef comes by and all of the sudden the hostess see I'm standing. We are then seated. 

Upon examining the beer list on the menu/chalkboards we still have a few questions so when our waitress comes by we ask her about the ""trappists"" beers they carry. The menu just says Rochefort, and I ask her which of the Rochefort's she carries but she has no idea. After checking she comes back and tells us it's the Rochefort ""8"" (which by the way is the worst of the three that the brewery makes, why would you carry that one). So we decide on Dechutes The Abyss instead. For some reason she only rudely asks for my ID, even though my friends and I are all the same age, watch out ABC. 5 Minutes later she comes back and informs us that they are all out of the Abyss...of course...  Since the rest of their beer list is very boring and unoriginal I'm forced to order an Arrogant Bastard. My friends order their beers and she runs away as I am trying to order Appetizers. I flag her down and order some sliders and pretzels. Our beers come out and I immediately know that beer I ordered is wrong. Its much much darker than it is supposed to be and tastes nothing like the Arrogant Bastard. I try to find my waitress but to no avail. So i set my beer on the edge of the table, fully untouched, but she ignores it. A food runner drops off our ""toasted""pretzels and they are stone cold. Worse than any pretzel I have ever had in my life. I place our untouched pretzels with the beer at the edge of the table praying to God someone will take them away from us. But of course they never do, and I am forced to sit staring at them.

The sliders and fries were actually pretty good, but they use Heinz ketchup, which is a big no-no for any gastropub. 

As we sit hungry and thirsty we decide that our dinner will have to take place somewhere else. Its easily an hour since we walked into the Pub and our waitress hasn't taken our entree order.  She then comes by and asks us how everything is, when there is 3 untouched beers and the pretzels at the end of the table. We simply ask for the check and she leaves without saying a word. She then brings the bill and drops it off without a word. With our dishes still waiting to be taken away. We pay the bill and leave.

I will never return to this place even though I love the concept and am in Vegas all the time. This is an extremely poor rendition of a gastropub. Hire some employees that actually care about what they are doing. Don't brag about ""you don't carry bad beers like bud"" when you actually DO carry terrible beers that are just as widely distributed as bud. I would not describe them as a craft beer bar.",8Rbe1D9o3z80rvBMd_ggig,3,1,1,M7QF8eEmoK8aEKsTT4cdjg

First of all, nice beer selection.  Great happy hour specials. For a place claiming to be super knowledgeable about beer, the quality beer was served far too cold.  Not to sound like a beer nerd, but good beer shouldn't be served so freezing that I miss much of the taste and smell.

Our waitress was, well, not nice to put it diplomatically.  She was clearly overworked, but she ignored us repeatedly for unknown reasons.  I gathered she got forced to work later than expected, but well, these things do happen.  The waitress also seemed to suggest I was stupid when I politely declined her suggestion of another beer when she said the beer I wanted was not available (she recommended a beer that was not comparable).

There are just too many places to drink and eat dinner to recommend this place after happy hour. I like the decor and the staff is pretty good-- I will say that with loads of hard surfaces (tile everywhere), it does get very loud even at only half capacity. There is also a large bell that rings frequently, so if you aren't into that, go elsewhere. 

Drinks are plentiful any time of day. I've only had the beer and was pleasantly surprised by the selection. Their Bloody Mary bar looks sort of overwrought, but it doesn't necessarily look bad. It might be sort of fun if you are into vegetable juice cocktails (I am not). 

The fish and chips are good, and traditional in style. That means you should be dousing them in malt vinegar and saving the ketchup for your fries. Please do not be the jerk I saw one time dipping his fish in ketchup and complaining that they we're not like fish sticks-- it's embarrassing. Keep in mind that portion sizes are large here, so it may be a good idea to split these or any dish with a friend. 

I went into my last visit here expecting to write a four star review, but have to revise it downward. Yesterday for lunch I had the the CBLT which was not spectacular. It was sort of soggy and strange, although I appreciated the heft of it. I'll return to the fish and chips next time. Also-- avoid the waffle fries.

Not only with the food being below average but with the terrible service (not the whole staff, our server specifically, Nicole I believe was her name). We made reservations, as we were a large party celebrating my sister's birthday. The server kept pushing a round of shots for the birthday girl after we turned them down 3 times, we finally agreed- (yes a whole 11 dollars a pop for  a group of 13!)

She then tried to up the sales again by mentioning that our food would take longer since we were large party so we should get appetizers. Why would you announce that you are incapable of providing for a large party effectively? And it's not really true that appetizers are quicker than entrees. 

She then brought out a birthday cake and sang to my sister even though no one requested this or ordered it, and then put a $9 charge for the cake we never ordered!

The ultimate worst part of it all, was the way she handled our check. I've been a server for 5 years and I know what a pain in the @$$ it is to split a check a million times when you are busy and no one tips right and its a huge old mess. However, under the circumstance that the bill is close to a thousand bucks, I really can't imagine why anyone would want to max out their card in vegas. Especially since it was not very busy, there is no reason to make a big fuss. We had mostly cash and 3 credit cards. This is easy enough. I've done it a million times for checks that are not even half that amount. Yeah it sucks, but you do it b/c you get an automatic gratuity even if you are an awful server.

She complained over and over about how she couldn't do it and how the bartender had to do it and how they don't like to do it, and how its so complicated.... give me a break! You swipe the card, type in the amount, rip it out of the printer, and stick a pen in the book!

It is difficult to find if you are coming from the strip.  We searched for 30 minutes.  For those of you looking, the restaurant is right outside Aria going into the city center.  

My group was participating in an event all day which prevented us from making the trip to the PUB in the morning.  Our goal was the bloody mary and when we arrived there around 11 pm at night...extremely hungry...we were told that the bloody mary's were for brunch only.  I pleaded with them and they kindly made us a round.  They were amazing and we loved them.  

The rest of the food was good, our waitress was pleasant.  The restaurant had a great atmosphere.  Here is a tip...bring a dollar to the bathroom as there is a bathroom attendant who is quick to squirt soap on your hands when you leave the water closet.  She deserves a tip just for sitting next to the bathroom at the back of the restaurant let alone giving you good smelling soap and a towel.

803780,2014-07-21,0,dn_ipqbm7_jUz5X3rDez_A,"Walking into any restaurant on the Vegas strip is always a gamble, no pun intended.  The massive billboards with famous faces and ""world renowned"" emblazoned everywhere leads the uninitiated to believe that there's something special hidden behind these giant glass windows.  I had ""meh"" expectations walking in, and I wasn't far off. 

Todd English P.U.B. is conveniently located only yards from the front desk of the Aria hotel in the middle of the strip, and makes its presence known to anyone checking in or out of the resort.  Billing itself as an excellent place for craft beers, and considering its close proximity to my room, I decided to go there at the recommendation of the man checking me in.  

A slow sunday evening meant quick seating at a large booth near the bar, and relatively quick service from a friendly guy named ""Cory"".  Lighting was a problem.  There wasn't nearly enough of it, especially for the 7 o'clock sunday dinner crowd.  Using the light from my cell phone I discovered that the beer menu is rather long, which is nice, but is on the pricey side if you want to drink a lot.  The food seemed appealing, especially given the enthusiasm with which Cory suggested the fish and chips meal.  I settled in, preparing myself for greasy and salty post flight recovery food.

The food arrived so quickly it left me and my companion wondering if they had a stack of them waiting for someone to order.  Seriously no more than 10 minutes elapsed between the words ""Fish and Chips"" leaving my mouth, and that same fish/chip dish entering my stomach.  

The portions were a bit off.  Only 2 pieces of fish about the size of a deck of cards, accompanied by a mountain of potato wedges that must have weighed 3 pounds.  I think I could have done with 50% less potato, and 50% more fish.  The fish was nice, not too heavy or oily, and the breading wasn't mushy or bland.  They also plate this dish on an aluminum pan with a piece of paper beneath it.  Presumably this is to aid in the dishwashing process, but I kept pulling little shreds of damp paper out of my mouth as I ate.  In hindsight I think I would have ordered something different.

In summary - 
Atmosphere: dimly lit, plenty of space.
Service - Attentive and friendly.
Food - Points for speedy delivery, but not for portion size or plating.
Drinks - Varied but pricey.  

2 Meh's for effort.  Would have been 3 if I had gotten 1 more piece of fish to eat.",c6tHNAllC_rKPtmxST6onw,0,0,2,NpVc-g17qp6pmQZOvkJaCQ

So, Friday morning, we got our bets in and headed to find a comfortable place to get something to eat and watch some games. Walking around, we ended up at Todd English P.U.B., which had everything we wanted; seats at the bar, breakfast options, and TVs showing the games. This was one spot, I was glad we stopped in, I had one of the best bloody mary's, ever, spicy, with the right mix of vodka (Hangar One) and tomato juice and the perfect garnish of pickled carrot and a block of cheddar cheese with some pickled string beans, all with a salt and peppered rim. Delightful. One of those babies and that's all I needed for the afternoon.  Breakfast was good but a little salty for my taste. There were a few brunch options, I got the bacon, egg, cheese sandwich (bacon on the side) and Gramercy Guy had the English breakfast, fried eggs, bacon, toast and beans. These beans were the show stealer. I traded my bacon for the beans and thinking about them now is making my mouth water. There was meat (I was told from the bar tender, it's what's ever left on the cutting board) with the right balance of smoky (probably from the meat) and sweet. Had I known how good the beans were, I would have swapped the fries I barely touched for more beans. And you know what they say about beans being for the heart. So really this was a perfectly balanced meal between the beans and the tomato juice.

The cool thing about Todd English P.U.B. is their drink challenge. Along the bar, there are many hour glasses that flip; they are timed for 7 seconds. The challenge: if you can drink a pint of beer before the time runs out, it's free. I knew I wasn't up for the challenge but watched many people around me do it, some more than once. Matt, the bartender, guessed that about 80% of the people who try actually succeed.

928146,2013-12-29,0,dn_ipqbm7_jUz5X3rDez_A,"Todd English's PUB is a fun place to visit in Vegas. They have a great beer selection (draught), not your typical American crap lagers. This was the first place I tried Innis and Gunn (a Scottish beer) and they served it at the perfect temperature. Of all the other places I've had it, no one comes close to serving it right. 

The happy hour prices are awesome: 50% off draught beers. Prices are otherwise high (lots of draughts start at $12+), but, as previously mentioned, they are good beers (lots of craft and European beers). You also get to sample their draught beers, so you don't have to blindly commit to a random beer you may not like. I have only sat at the bar, so I have never eaten food here. I can't comment on the food, but it appears their raw seafood bar is popular. 

The service at the bar has always been the same. Every time we go (my gf and I) our bartender will take a while to actually serve us (not too long, but longer than expected with the number of patrons that are present) and they won't be too talkative. However, the longer we stay the nicer they get. They are very informative on their beers and offer samples to the beers we are interested in trying. We have not met one bad bartender and we, honestly, have loved each bartender that has helped us. In fact, even the dishwasher at the bar was informative and very helpful as well. 

The only reason I give this place -1 star is for the price outside of happy hour. I understand it's Vegas and it's located within their high-end mall, but the prices are still extravagant. The PUB at Monte Carlo next door has a great selection of beers also, but they are not nearly as expensive. Regardless, this is a great establishment with great beer and wonderful service.

The selection was outstanding- lots of Belgian imports, as well as quality stuff from around the good old US of A. For an Eastcoaster such as myself, this was a great opportunity to get stuff like Black Butte on draft. For those visiting without renting a vehicle, this would also be a good opportunity to get their craft drink on right on the strip, unless they want to be sipping sugary drinkie poos from over-sized plastic sippy cups.
The ambiance is also superior to most L. Vegas bars. The lighting was very cozy, the bar was an oval in the center of the room, with multiple bartenders tending to ones needs. A game of sports was being televised on television sets placed all around the joint.
Now for the prices- most stuff was in the neighborhood of $8-$10. I understand that for Las Vegas this is a very niche business, though one on the rise, and the rent must be higher than Charlie Sheen, but other places we visited were able to offer somewhat lower prices.
Not being huge gamblers, what me and my wife did was play some slots at Aria, than upon winning $30-$40, we would proceed to this P.U.B. and blow our winnings. Repeat as many times as necessary.

Note for guests staying at Aria: the in room fridges have weight sensors. I did what I do everywhere else in the world- take the contents out neatly, place own purchases(gallon of water, as we're in the dessert, beers), and before checking out- place everything back in in the same order.

Where do I start???

Service: My waiter, ""Eric"" seemed a little lost. Frantic, disorganized, and it looked like he was freaking out to the busser about condiments. You would think this would happen in the back of the house and not in front of the table he is taking care of.

Food: We ordered some appetizers, which arrived 15 minutes after our entrees. AWESOME!!! Come on....  Onion rings! don't take more than 3 minutes in the fryer.   
The food was decent, I got to admit. The fish and ships tasted pretty good. Never thought to have fish at the desert. Freshly de-frosted....  Trust me, I know....   I lived in Florida, and I can tell...

Staff: I always like to walk around the place I eat at to check for organization, (old habit) and at times I learn something new...  But here, It seemed over staffed. A lot of employees just going around in circles and avoiding things that needed to be taken care of. 
On my way to the restroom could not help to notice a young girl that my guess is supposed to be the polisher, just being on her phone, while one of the bussers seemed a little frustrated about resetting tables and not having anything to reset with.

I understand that reviews are intended for other people and not management, but how to transfer the message??  

One more thing....  I'm sure the food runner noticed me just standing in the middle of the walkway looking at the chef. This poor guy looked overwhelmed, while 3 runners are just standing there with a pile of tickets in front of them and a row of dishes ready to be ran in the hot window...  Come on!!!!   It's frustrating to see such a place with this potential go to hell for the lack of team work.

I will go back and give it a second review....  I hope management pay a little more attention...  It's a great place, but needs tightening up...",eQG5NenyHiE0wy1Cj47F1w,2,0,2,34quuYkjqy6O7LOMJJTO6Q

I then had the grilled Brie, bacon and tomato sandwich. It was done panini-style and crisped to perfection. The thick slices of tomato and thick-cut applewood smoked bacon paired perfectly with the creamy gooey Brie.

As if English food doesn't have a bad enough reputation. The menu here looks very impressive but it just didn't deliver as advertised.
Food
We didn't order too many items but come on, fish and chips you should have this down. The fish was good, nice batter, nice fish but the service got in the way - fish came out just above lukewarm, and the chips, even colder. Perhaps because they sat under the heat lamp too long. Hard to believe they couldn't arrange for 2 order of fish and chips and the two other dishes to be prepared at same time. The skirt steak my wife had was also barely luke warm, the bread, sorry crostini served with it was bigger than the steak. And served with Fritos. Fritos...seriously for 20$.
The half lb of prime beef my daughter had was probably the best thing we saw, although 24$ and served on a hard hoagie.
Desert - Gingerbread was frozen and had to be sent back. After sitting under a heat lamp with a bowl of ice cream for several minutes. (see service). The ginger bread (hard as a rock with a strange flavored ice cream was replaced with the Cheesecake. The cheesecake was a bit clotty but overall hard to tell how good/bad it was considering it was drowned in the berry compote it was served with. Should be renamed to ' berry compote w/ cheesecake.  
Luckily, on e waiter decided to grab this from the heat lamp as our waiter was too busy [chatting].
Service
Quite funny to watch the manager busy one minute trying to expedite the kitchen and the next minute sitting down at 'friends' table stuffing his gob (getting his grub on). Did I tell you this man was hungry? Soon, half the staff felt the need to re-kindle with this same table and that's when P.U.B went to D.U.D. (my kids name for this place - now).
Strangest thing ever, some food is cooked in front open kitchen but other item are brought randomly from back [kitchen?] and aimlessly dropped off to sit under heat lamps. No coordination which explains the heat issues with our meals.
Beer
Good selection, overpriced
Price
Overpriced for what it is, $200.00 for party of 4. 2 of which were kids and I was only one drinking (3 beers). Do yourself a favor and take your money to  nicer place where the food and service warrants the $$$. If you want to give Todd English a try, you're better off with Olives.

For example the tomato and cheese salad was substituted with grapefruit after they were out of the tomatoes, cheese and dressing. Unbelievable. The sliders were very dry and we asked for them to not put on thousand Island dressing which they did anyways. The wings were extremely vinegary and had way too much sauce and less you like wearing your food.  Mr. English needs to come in and do a serious check up on this restaurant.

On first approach, the hostess was extremely pleasant and very kind. She sat us immediately at a booth along the wall. Our waitress, I think her name was Hayleigh, came to our table to take our drink order and my fiance and I both ordered drinks from the bar. I ordered the white sangria and he ordered a Manhattan. Our drinks took approximately 20 minutes to come to the table and when the server brought them out to the table, she made an excuse about the bartender being new and walked away. This did not bother us much except for the fact that we probably would have ordered 2nd drinks if they had not taken so long! 
Before she brought the drinks, the server asked if we were ready to order and seemed inconvenienced when I mentioned that we would like to order an appetizer. However, we ordered the mussels and they were really delicious. Our food came out before we were finished with the appetizer. I ordered the Lobster Rolls and my fiance ordered the RIbeye. My Lobster Rolls were delicious. i cannot express how much I loved them. Definitely a must try if you happen to want to try this place out. My fiance's ribeye was cooked well, however the potato wedges that came with it were cold and soggy. By this time, both of our waters have been empty for a good 15 minutes. Once we finally got our servers attention, she was annoyed when we explained to here that the wedges were cold.
During this time, the table in front of us was complaining to the manager about their food taking a long time, and the manager was a complete jerk about it to them. Both my fiance and I are servers and we have never witnessed worse customer service. The manager was rude and condescending and told the table that they were lying about their food taking a long time, and said ""What do you want me to do about it?"" 
For this reason, we chose not to speak with the manager because of how rude we saw him being. We then asked our server, who we have seen only 3 times all night to box up our food, because we just wanted to leave. 

Worst service I have ever experienced. I will never go back. I cannot believe a place with this reputation allows their management to treat customers so badly. My fiance and I have friends who live in Las Vegas and we travel here at least once a year.

With it being right on the walkway from Aria towards the mall and Cosmo beyond, it's a solid place to watch the crowd go by, which in Vegas, can always be entertaining. 

The P.U.B. (Public Urban Bar) has, as one would expect and hope, a pretty outstanding selection of beers, both on tap and in bottle. We were served by the barkeep very promptly, and as we were fairly starving after a long flight, it fortunately did not take long to get our food.

I tried the Buffalo Style Burger which was served with blue cheese, hot sauce and slaw. Really outstanding. Their fries were great too. 

At $18 for a burger, it's definitely on the pricier side, but what else would you expect right outside the casino door?

1225216,2015-10-05,3,dn_ipqbm7_jUz5X3rDez_A,"This review truly pains me to write. Todd English has been one of my absolute favorite restaurants in town for years, however they apparently changed chefs or management recently that have turned mine & my husbands once LOVED dishes into a pale comparison of their former selves. 

I cannot even tell you what number visit this was to TE, but I can say we've never experienced service as poor as last night. 

To start off we walked in & ask for a table for 2 outside. She seated us at a 2 top against the wall. It was pretty cramped so I went back in & asked if we could please move to 1 of the bigger (empty & dirty) tables once they were cleaned off. She said, ""tell your server"", turned her back to me & returned to her conversation w/ the other hostess. Hmm.  Ok, I let that one go, told our server and he moved us. 

Now we are getting to the sad stuff. It was 9:56pm. (According to the receipt.) We had intentions of ordering the Happy Hour chicken wings we love so much & as an appetizer the Fried Bologna Sandwich.  The waiter informed us it wasn't HH yet. I wasn't aware of the time, so didn't know we were mere minutes away, & agreed to an order of 3 wings. I expressed that we like them ""plain"", possibly my mistake for not expressing, ""no sauce"". So when they came out they needed to be sent back. Upon their original arrival though I discovered those are not the wings I've come to know & love. They are now a double jointed wing, which thankfully still tastes the same, but became change #1!  

Next the Fried Bologna Sandwich came, I thought to myself, WTH is this!  Their once incredible sandwich has been down graded to nothing more than a deli sandwich you can get at any old chain. I asked when they changed it and the waiter told me it has always been that way with a look on his face that said, ""I don't know what you're talking about, but that's the same!""  I decided to check if anyone ever posted a picture of the old sandwich to Yelp to verify I was not going crazy. Thankfully, I found a picture, but just let it go and made a mental note to never order that item again.

At this point, because I know I'm not crazy and I've already seen 2 very significant changes to dishes that are not even mentioned on the menu, (which btw looks exactly the same as it always has,) I decided it was time to ask what other changes had been made & if my favorite dish, the lobster rolls were the same. He said yes they are the same, & I unfortunately blindly trusted the employee over my gut instinct.  

My husband ordered his usual Prime Beef Carvery, which now comes served on a dissolving paper that almost ended up in his mouth because the meat is now served drenched in jus. Another change that rendered the dish inedible by my husband.  Not to mention, the beef itself was a sad substitute for the large, hefty slices he has always gotten in the past!

Onto the lobster rolls. Thankfully not much here other than smaller size rolls and a little too much mayo used in the mix, but that could have been a 1 batch thing, I don't hold that against them as a restaurant. 

When the waiter came over and asked how everything was, we were completely honest and expressed all our displeasure, most notably my husband's dish, the gravy or sauce or whatever was on his dish that made it inedible for him and turned the decorative paper into a part of the meal. The waiter again said nothing had changed with that dish, but finally agreed to go ask his chef.  

Well well well, what do you know, I was right about every single change I had addressed and the waiter denied. While I do respect the waiter for finally telling us the truth, it is extremely disappointing it took an entire displeasing meal and us pushing him to do so!  He informed us everything has been changed because they have a new chef and asked what he could do to make it up to us. Unfortunately the only thing that can make any of this better is to go back to the AMAZING Todd English PUB I loved so much. 

I'd also like to make note that at no point did a manager come over to express his apologies or anything!  Not good  especially when you have 2 locals who would frequently drive to the strip solely to eat at your restaurant!  The only thing that was done to make up for the regrettable meal was my husband's dish was taken off the bill. 

When seated the waiter asked if we have dined there before and we confirmed we had. It was at this point he should have told us there were recent changes to their menu. (I guess that maybe would have happened had he actually known there were changes.)

As for why I decided to give 1 star even though some of the food was edible is because upon leaving it occurred to me, the sad reality is that wasn't just a bad night in the kitchen that could be rectified...  This is how their food is now permanently. There will be no going back to the TE. Pub we loved.",RyVpd9WTfCC4puHIL8x4CQ,4,0,1,C_aznBREb9cM-dh26gwanQ

I ordered the duck buns, very good and not heavy. The duck was moist and the buns soft, nothing worse than tough buns :).

I then ordered the lobster rolls. *Que screeching breaks sound clip...riiight Now*.  So I wasn't sure what to think. I still don't know what to think. Finding amazing lobster rolls outside of New England is not easy and I'll leave it right there. I should have ordered the burger.

Then, to top it off, when we asked for the check, he gave us 1 check with 20% gratuity added.  We reminded him about separating it.  He then went back to his register and took about 20 minutes to slpit everything up and process our payments.

A one biter. We couldn't discern any vegetable aside from the red onion. Two large olives would have been more filling. We had the roasted chicken and TE brisket. Flavorful, but portions were very small for a large group. Only enough brisket for about a half of cup each. Chicken a little more. Sauces were good. More than enough for the meat we had.

No challenges happened but we did order some food. Even on a lunch, the restaurant is pretty packed but we only waited a couple of minutes to get our table ready. Upon suggestion, I decided to try their lobster roll whole the bf ordered their fish and chips.

When they say fish and chips, literally expect A FISH and some chips. Granted it was a huge piece of deep fries fish, but it was kinda sad to see just one fish on the plate. The fish and chips were good. But nothing too spectacular. I thoroughly enjoyed the lobster roll. I thought t was way worth getting the lobster roll than the fish and chips. You get 3 mini rolls with some cole slaw and chips. The lobster roll had some food chunks of lobster in them as well. 

We left full and satisfied. Will we come back again? Maybe. It's a little on the pricier side. For 2 lunch entrees and 2 drinks it came out to be about $80+ for the 2 of us. But then again, it's Vegas so what do you expect right?",-LhU9PZZKaP_xFa_rjo9jQ,2,2,3,vBG6X_JzT5u2DNMUHhwfOw

I noticed hallway through my lobster salad that there was soggy paper towel in the salad. How disgusting!!! This is supposed to be a high end place?? So I didn't make a big deal because I know mistakes happen but I was grossed out and didn't finish the salad as my clients finished up eating. They even made a few comments about it and I said it's not a big deal. I mentioned to the bidder and the server that my salad had the paper and pointed it out. They both basically said is there something you would like me to do? If I knew my company made a mistake I would just correct it ink stead of asking the customer to ask me to correct it. Maybe comp the salad? So I let it go, then I decided a few hours later to call and complain, because the bill was $125 for three people for lunch with one drink.... So I talked to the manager tonight who basically asked for the servers name, didn't really address the fact that my salad was complete trash ($25 salad). And basically blew it off with the comment, ""I will make sure the chef knows to make sure there isn't paper in salads."" Help me understand, why do you need to tell your chef to not put paper in the food? I would have expected the manager to say, I am so sorry, come in tomorrow and I will take care of you. Or maybe a gift card or an apology or maybe something?!?! I got totally blown off.

Something that a well trained, caring waitress should have noticed. Once we pointed it out, she cheerfully apologized and fetched two different beers. The second problem was that the burger that one of us ordered as ""medium"" showed up not medium rare, or rare even. It was bloody. Some obvious lack of attention in the kitchen. Our still cheerfully apologetic waitress hustled off to replace it. 

The dirty chips are an interesting appetizer, but probably not something that many people would make a regular habit. The rest of the food was not bad, but a bit forgettable.

We were seated quickly on the room on the side and given the Late Night Menu (good from 11:00pm-1:30am).  Looking around, they seem to have the raw bar in the middle with the small, slightly darker and more pub-like room on the side, an outdoor patio on the other side, and a more well lit dining room in the back.  There's a mix of polished cement, tile, and wood throughout.  It's modern yet still warm.

The beer menu here is fantastic.  It's not as extensive as some places, but they have a great variety of quality beers with excellent descriptions.  I had the Wexford Irish Cream.  For those who love cream ales and rue the day that Caffrey's was bought out by Coors who stopped importing it to the US, then Wexford is probably the closest thing you'll find.

The food here is good too.  Not the most amazing food in the world, but very tasty.  We shared a bunch of plates:
-- Caesar salad: Pretty standard.  Very good croutons.
-- Grilled soft mini pretzels.  These are about the size of a long cigars.
-- Corn dog puppies.  I'm not usually a fan of corn dogs, but these were fantastic.  Amazing, light, yet tasty breading.  They came with skinny fries which were unremarkable.
-- Kelley's roast beef sliders.  KM asked for them without wiz, which made them a bit dry.  Passable, but average.
-- Chicken parm sliders.  Just how chicken parm should be but on a small bun.  Good stuff.
-- Man of steel burger.  Cooked just right.  The potato bread bun was a nice touch.

The only downer here is the service was sort of off.  For a place that was less than half full our waitress took way too long to make her rounds.",Fr_rLfBcfvVVXkLTanrkvA,0,0,4,m5B0StA-qzcP2c5y4aQt6A

If the name wasn't there, would it be just as good? Well, the Todd English P.U.B. (even the name irks me. Would it be so bad to just say ""pub""?) seems to stand up as a respectable establishment hype aside.

The service was noticeable immediately when we entered as personable and helpful. We got seats on a Saturday night with very little wait. The place is spacious and bustling. Restaurants in Vegas don't have the selection of beer I come to expect in my home town, but here, the selection is respectable. Lots of things on tap, both imports (Belgian, German, English, etc.) and American microbrews (and they even have a cask ale, which is hard to find) . 

Here's a summary of what we tried: 

Raw oysters - fresh and delicious, just like in California.

Dirty Chips - GET THIS! Unsure what sick mind came up with it, but it was delicious as an appetizer.

Duck Confit from the carvery - Delicious. The maple soy sounded a bit suspect, but the savory/sweetness worked well with the duck. Use sparingly though, it's a bit concentrated. All you need is a dab. The other sauce that we ordered was the black truffle mayo. As other reviewers rave, it is awesome. Try dipping fries in it!

Sheperds Pie - meat and potatoes in a cast iron dish, how can you go wrong? Delicious.

The portions are plenty large, so bring an appetite. The prices are what you'd expect from a restaurant on the strip, but relatively speaking, it was worth the price.

Tonight I went with my fiancé and her family.  Our servers were very friendly and everybody had a great time.  The staff was nice enough to modify some of our meals - like a special salad for my fiancé and off-menu greens with my steak.  The mussels are so good, especially the sauce - I found myself almost drinking the tomato sauce with a spoon.  Others tried the thick slices of pastrami and loved it.  The shrimp, sold by the piece, is perfect.  My ribeye was a thin cut, pub style.  It was tasty although I prefer a good filet over a ribeye any day.

Interesting thing happened:  My shrimp came and I grabbed the lemon - something thick and black on the lemon made a dark stain on my finger!  Smelled like grease or rubber.  The staff was quick to apologize and take it back to the manager.  I went to the nice bathroom (complete with attendant) and wash my hand.  When I came back, they had given me a fresh batch of shrimp and a couple of extras!  The manager came by and apologized again and was very nice to everyone.  I was impressed because a simple sorry would have been enough for me, but they made sure we were taken care of.  

Finally, we briefly mentioned that we were getting married in several months.  At the end of our meal, out of nowhere, a couple of lit candles and some ice cream cookie sandwiches appeared on our table.  Nice touch.

The menu has so many different choices, I could come back 10 times and try something different every time.  Some people complain about the prices but, come on, what do you expect from a nice place right next Crystals -  a high end shopping mall.

Instead I just went during a less than peak traffic period to get a taste for the place.  It's located in the bowels of CityCenter, which now features hit and miss iphone 3G coverage.  (An improvement over the ""might as well just leave the phone in the car"" coverage.)

- The staff is super friendly.
- They serve Molson Canadian.
- A good range of bar food appetizers, to seafood, to burgers and fries.
- Free popcorn while you wait.

My friends got a couple orders of the west coast oysters and they were raving about them so I gotta recommend those as they are less than 2 days removed from the ocean when they hit your table.

The Todd English Pub was the first restaurant we came across as we exited the Aria so we decided to give it a try. In hindsight, I wish we'd done a bit more research and kept looking. 

I know we're in Vegas and prices are ridiculously jacked up but a $70+ lunch for two people is insane. There was nothing special enough about this food to warrant such a high price tag. I ordered the Prime Rotisserie sandwich, which was basically a fancy name for French dip. For $20, it shockingly came with a side of fries too. I debated for quite awhile whether I should order a $20 sandwich, as it basically goes against everything I believe, but everything else on the menu was similarly overpriced. The sandwich tasted fine but it was too much for me to eat in one meal. It's too bad that they don't offer half sandwich offers, especially considering that most people are on vacation and likely don't have a place to store leftovers. Instead, I had to toss part of my expensive sandwich away.

My boyfriend chose the Caesar salad, which even without meat still costs $14 and is at least an additional $8 depending on the type of meat you want to add. He then also added an order of waffle fries for an extra $9. For a side of fries!!!  Honestly, I wish we would have just ordered the waffle fries and called it a day. The fries were delicious albeit in no way worth $9 but at least it would have made our lunch less pricey overall.  The ranch here is way too dilly and definitely does not taste like regular ranch. I was quite disappointed in it and I'm a huge restaurant ranch fan.

To get the weekend started, my boyfriend also ordered a beer. Guess how much that cost? $14 for one beer! As is the theme of this review, that's crazy! In fact, it was so crazy that he only ordered the one beer and I'm not sure when is the last time I've seen him stick to one beer at a restaurant. 

I'd be willing to offer four stars for the food if the prices weren't so high but the quality just doesn't match the price tag as is. Although the complimentary popcorn was a nice touch, it wasn't worth $70.",hHgNg6u9P_Ym5wLXmnoBcw,6,4,3,VrylGWff0kdj6K34nLKpIg

Wait, let me back up. My husband and I wanted to sit outside. We asked a server in the area if it was ok if we sat ourselves thinking he could just send a hostess out with menus - he gave us a shitty look and told us no way. Jerk. 

So back to the food - we tried the roast beef sliders, chicken wings and chips. The first order of sliders we received came out COLD. Nothing like biting into cold beef, bun and Whiz sauce to make your stomach turn. My hubs had the wings which were kind of mushy, and very mediocre. By far the best dish was the chips which we ordered with curry sauce even though it wasn't offered as an option on the menu. This is something that I would recommend, although I have a hard time with any pub that doesn't regularly offer chips and curry - even a gastropub should get that one right. And no HP sauce. I mean, seriously???!

The beer selection was pretty poor for a pub as well. When I think pub, I think selection and variety is key. And by variety, I don't mean Stella and PBR. 

The only reason why I will award PUB that second star is because our server was very sweet and quickly replaced my cold sliders, requested our special curry sauce, and generally tried to take care of us despite the lackluster food and beverage offerings.

The next night, I went back and had the tuna burger. Again, a fantastic burger with lots of rare tuna and some wasabi oriented sauce that was just perfect with it.

I then needed to grab a quick dinner before heading back to expo activities, so I thought I'd try out Todd's place since I was one of his first ever clients who would rush from work to stand in line in Charlestown awaiting for the door to open at his first Olive's restaurant. Well.....
I arrived alone to dine, was taken to a table quickly outside and after a previous night's party with open bar, didn't think I was up to having anything but water. I think the fact that I was alone and wasn't going to be running up a big bar bill was a bummer for the server. She pretty much started ignoring me. Like , right past me to take an order of a full 4 top. Even the couple at the next table looked at me and remarked how she was not serving me. I was getting late and it was actually embarrassing. So, I got up and went inside and spoke to the manager about it. 
He was very good about quickly reseating me (although then I had attitude from another server in there about taking that table!l Lots of server attitudes there?!) 
But, the manager took my order quickly, brought it out himself, then comped it all.  This is how a restaurant should handle mishaps, if they do occur.  But, why oh why did it have to even happen?! Geez, snooty server; not everyone has a full group with them and not everyone drinks expensive drinks; so sorry!  But; I DO tip extremely well when it's deserved. 
So....the food: be hungry. Big servings! I had the wedge salad, which was really good. It was so big though, that I was too full to eat much of my entree. It is really big enough to be a main course, unless you are a big dude with a huge appetite. I also had the tuna burger. It was very good, but I only ate half of it. 
Overall, It was a fun place and I would go back. The outside area, where I actually wanted to sit, is really nice. Inside, a fun louder area.

We were in Las Vegas and were looking for a decent but still reasonably priced dinner spot so we decided to head to Todd English PUB.  I was impressed with Todd English's food at the LA Food & Wine Festival and had high hopes for this one (even though I knew that Todd English PUB was going to be much more casual and simple fare).

The atmosphere was very raucous.  It very much had a gastropub feel and it was quite loud.  There was also a seating area outside with heat lamps (unfortunately, since Todd English PUB is located in a congested area, you have to deal with several smokers nearby).

The menu consisted of a wide variety of food from several fried appetizers to burgers and sandwiches as well as some English pub grub like fish and chips and bangers and mash.

We started with the ahi tuna on wonton crackers, which was the best dish of the night.  While expensive, the starter was good.  The ahi tuna was nicely mixed with seaweed and gingered sesame vinaigrette.  The tuna mixture sat on light and crispy fried wontons.  The tuna was fresh.  It was also quite spicy.

I also had the bangers and mash.  The mashed potatoes were good.  They were very light for mashed potatoes and had a good flavor.  They kind of reminded me of the mashed potatoes at Nick & Stef's in Downtown LA.  The bangers were quite bland though.  They were moist enough, but they had very little flavor.  They sat on a creamy mustard sauce, which was also bland.

I tried some of my friend's fries, which were just okay (a little soft).  My friend mentioned that the fish and chips were bland.

Service was decent.  The staff was friendly, but it was hard to flag down our waiter at times (which is a common problem when you eat outside and the outside dining area is not that connected to the inside dining area).

Prices were not too bad for Las Vegas.  There were several entrees below $20.  However, for the quality of food, you can find better gastropub food in other cities at similar or lower prices.

Though we liked the ahi tuna on wonton crackers, the entrees were very disappointing and I am not sure if the other entrees would be any better.  I did like the little sampling of Todd English's food at the LA event (and he is a very charming, funny and smart guy), but I think his more upscale Olives in The Bellagio is probably a better representation of his skills in the kitchen.

Todd English PUB is located right next to Aria.  Aria has its own free parking structure and it is easy to find a space (valet parking is also available).",w-w-k-QXosIKQ8HQVwU6IQ,19,13,2,NWjY57nyYZVHfgr8LCAqOA

The beer selection is good but the prices are high. So for 2 people without a significant amount of food or drinks we ended up paying over 1$$ which is ridiculous for a pub.

Yay:
-Lobster rolls: nice buttery rolls, perfectly cooked lobster with a side of chips.  I'm not a huge fan of lobster because it can get overwhelming and tough but they cooked it really well here.  Plus the ratio of mayo to the lobster was good as well.

Other:
-Loaded chips: Freshly made potato chips, with bbq beef ragu, cheese and some sort of cream sauce.  The bbq in this is definitely strong. Get this if you like the taste of bbq.  The beef ragu was scarce, barely had any.  One of my friends didn't even know there was beef in it and we had already gotten through almost half.  It's a huge order though, so enough to share.

1799078,2013-04-01,1,dn_ipqbm7_jUz5X3rDez_A,"Know what you are getting into. This place is a gimmick. But that's to be expected when visiting an ""English Pub"" in a casino. Let's get to the pro's and con's.

Pro's: the grilled brie and bacon sandwich was very good. My wife's grilled chicken with avocado sandwich also looked very good. Come to think of it, every meal I saw pass us looked very decent.

Con's: No getting around it, the place is supremely over-priced. Typical pint is $11.00. While drinks are expensive in Vegas, this is at the upper-end in terms of cost. Most places in Vegas serve a pint of microbrew for $7.00 to $8.00 (and one place in Palazzo had happy hour pints for $3.00). But you are going to a pub with a large selection of beers, so arguably your premium beer price is going towards having that giant beer selection. 

The service is also leaves a lot to be desired. Our waiter immediately gave us a bad case of the douche chills. I ordered a pint of the cask-conditioned black butte porter and my wife ordered a pint of Magic Hat No. 9. After ordering, he went into this long story about how much he loved Magic Hat No. 9 but wishes he could find it in bottles because in his opinion bottled beer was so much better than draft. According to our waiter, the draft just seemed to ""change the flavor of the beer."" We thought this was a strange comment because nobody has ever tried to sell me on the idea that bottled beer is better than draft. We didn't think anything of it for the moment.

Then after he brings our beers, my wife sips her beer and comments that this beer is way stronger than Magic Hat No. 9. Magic Hat No. 9 is probably a 5.5% ABV wheat beer. She then let me sip the beer to confirm. Instead of Magic Hat No. 9, the beer was a Belgian Trippel like Chimay White. Personally, I would prefer the Chimay White to a No. 9, but my wife didn't want to start her lunch with a 9% ABV beer and wanted something light like the No. 9. 

When we explained to the waiter that the beer he brought wasn't No. 9, he tried to convince us that we were wrong. If he had left it at that, we wouldn't have really had a problem because, at the end of the day, we are on vacation, and it's just a beer. We can always grab a beer somewhere else. He then tries to convince that it's the draft mechanism that has changed the flavor. He says that the previous beer on that same tap was a Cider and that the Cider ""residue"" combined with the Magic Hat No. 9 changed its flavor to a Belgian Trippel. Then he starts smiling and says, ""see, I told you that the bottles are better than the tap,"" as if he were bringing his whole bottle full-circle with this experience.

Bottom line: We left with the impression that this guy knew they were out of Magic Hat No. 9 but assumed we were too stupid to know the difference between No. 9 and a Belgian Trippel. 

Bottom line: my lunch was good, but the service was kind of weird. And it's a little bit cheesy, but that is to be expected in Vegas. For the money, there are better offerings on the strip. I prefer the Public House in the Palazzo. Food there is similar in quality (also kind of expensive), but the drinks are a little cheaper.",8lbpoA4YBKY6PTJGE7LfkA,3,0,2,mnCM9MJX-3Ivbyf-LkdJ7Q

The cocktails were very good!  They have a very refreshing margarita with cucumber--which is made all the better by the fact that it is NOT syrupy sweet.  They have a HUGE beer selection--and suffice it to say we were all feeling no pain after our first round.

The menu is loaded with options--but we went mostly with comfort food including an excellent shepherd's pie and chicken pot pie, as well as very good salads, chicken parmigian sliders, and more drinks!  My wife tried several of the oysters from the raw bar, and said they were excellent.

Our server was well-versed in the menu, wine and beer list, etc--and attentive without being intrusive.  Towards the end of the meal the restaurant was definitely filling up and noticeably louder.

There is apparently a different hostess for indoor seating vs outdoor seating. Note that the outdoor eating area is not gated, so every once in awhile, an obnoxious passerby will walk through the dining area.

FOOD

Hand chopped ahi tuna burger- served rare and comes with wonton chips and some kind of wasabi or dijon dip. I ordered the avocado on the side since I'm allergic. OMG. This was sooooooooo good. Although they spread the wasabi aioli on a bit unevenly and I teared up on some bites into my burger, it didn't distract me from the amazing taste and texture of this unique burger. There is a layer of black bean puree that brought everything together. The buns were lightly toasted and the arugula marinated to complement everything else.

Brown butter lobster rolls - came with kettle chips and coleslaw. We split our entrees so I got a whole lobster roll to myself (it comes with three). My goodness, this was one buttery and rich lobster roll. The browned butter is such a genius idea. The lobster pieces were generous and not heavily saturated in mayo. I love how they kept the chunks of lobster big instead of dicing them smaller to make a filler out of mayo. It really kept things fresh and gave me nice chewing action. I tasted the coleslaw and it was pretty good. My mom is not fond of coleslaw, but she polished it off. The chips were just kettle chips, nice crunch, not overly salted.

SERVICE

Service was okay. It's what I expected for a bar/pub type restaurant. Nothing great, nothing bad. I don't like servers to check up on us too often; I don't think she checked up on us at all which can be an issue if I needed something, but didn't.  Definitely try out their tuna burger since this type of burger is rarely on the menu at other restaurants.  It's hard to choose between the two entrees we ordered though, so either order both for yourself and take half home or bring someone to share with.  Although there are a lot of homeless people there, so you can always order both for yourself and give the remainder to someone who needs it.",cxcp1WYR9wvJtBFfzbelVw,1,1,5,qo-Ric1hBN4KyeFk19Hw6Q

Had a great time there, superb beer menu unlike many slightly more snobby pubs on the Strip. Beers from around the world and a healthy variety of small craft brews. I had a couple different ones while I was there and will definitely try more when I go back

Had the duck buns for my appetizer and they were delicious. I realize this kinda contradicts the overall tone of this review that it was nice to have some pub food as duck buns aren't really what you'd expect from a pub, but somehow they fit well. The meat was delicious, well cooked and the buns were great as well. 

Had the tacos for my entree and they were superb. Just delicious, nothing like some tacos and beer for a dinner. The tacos had this tasty and creamy but not overly heavy sauce on them which was maybe the best part. All too many places also overload with cabbage and such but that wasn't the case at all at Todd English. 

Again, I think the thing I like most about Todd English is that it was almost like an escape from the Strip, just the overall atmosphere was a pleasant departure. And the food and beer were great. Would definitely go back!",4HvIzTHB9o-aI6M8IO3SPQ,0,0,5,M5i0DLtCKvpYGTzjX42lrQ

Ok so I've never had mead other than the bottle here and there from Bevmo, so to try the mead here was exceptional. It actually made our night much better. 

The waitress was sweet and attentive, though we were a bit perplexed that a restaurant would close at 10pm, and the waitress explained that all bars need to close at 10p... but this is a Pub...right? ""it's a bar that serves food""... which is a Pub.... it still closes at 10pm... well I tried.

A group of 10 of us had reservations and were really looking forward to Todd English PUB.  

The Good: The ""7-second pint challenge"" was lots of fun and meant free beers for some guys in the group.  The boyfriend loved his sandwich from the Carvery menu (pastrami) and the pickled veggies that came with.  Big menu with lots to choose from.

The Bad: Corn Dog Bites that tasted a lot like the samples at Costco.

The Ugly: Terrible service - from pushing alcohol sales too hard, to not detailing the beers in a flight of beers, to serving the wrong drinks (beer when it was supposed to be cider), to not serving drinks at all and not bringing condiments when requested. Our server was completely indifferent to us, but more than happy to put an auto gratuity of 20% on the bill.  The Fish n Chips which was supposed to be a signature dish was terrible.

My friend had ordered a pastrami sandwich, which I took a bite out of. As I had mentioned before their pastrami is really good, but the bread wasn't too good.

I think Todd English PUB does the latter.  From the beer flights to the tile walls to the tv's with sports to the chicken pot pie on the menu, there are real pieces of casual flare everywhere even though it is located where the Aria hotel meets the Crystals shopping area (two of the nicer complexes in Vegas).  But don't let the casualness fool you, the food is not lacking.  The shrimp cocktail is really good and especially the cocktail sauce is amazing.  The beer flights are fun and depending on your taste can be really good.  

I had the ckicken pot pie for dinner and to be fair, I love chicken pot pie almost anywhere I can get it but to also be fair is was really freakin good.

Overall, it is a fun place that IMO takes the best of a casual food atmosphere and blends it with really good food which I love.  I especially love it because all to often I feel like I end up at places that use the casual element on the food prep and make their atmosphere nice but stuffy and thus fail on both sides.

I really wanted to like this place not having tried a Todd English restaurant but unfortunately this place didn't live up to my high celebrity chef expectations.

We started off with the dirty chips which sounded good on the menu, but weren't that good in real life. The chips were smothered in REALLY sharp blue cheese which overpowered the entire dish. The chicken livers that were served with it were fried so much they were nearly burnt. The saving grace of that appetizer were the tomatoes and bacon which tried to cut the sharpness of the blue cheese, but to no avail. The bright side of our appetizer ordering were the raw oysters. They were fresh and the cocktail sauce had the right amount of heat from the horseradish.

Now on to the entrees. I ordered the chicken pot lie and the sauce was a little too salty. The pie top was nice and flaky though. My husband ordered the New Amsterdam and I think that was the best dish of the evening. It is basically a pastrami Reuben with a hamburger. It was delicious! 

My sisters ordered appetizers as entrees. The duck buns had too much hoisin sauce and in the sauteed clam dish my other sister ordered about half of the clam shells were empty! The waitress was kind enough to go to the kitchen and get her more.

Overall I would say it was an okay experience. Many of the items we ordered fell short, but perhaps it really depends on what you order. Maybe next time I'm in a celebrity chef mood in Vegas, I'll stick to the tried and true DC chefs (aka: Andres, Richard) ;)",oRdw398CSGXvh8yJjxXIJQ,0,0,2,UXHRNJtiyZyh03AfVH5q8w

We sat at the bar, for a late Sunday lunch. Looking at the fun impressive beer menu. I wish I would have been told about the flights of beer, but no matter.

Looking over the menu, the roasted meat selection and bread for sandwiches seemed to be a fun lunch, coupled with an order of skinny and fat fries, and we were off.

Weirdly, chicken on the bone, that was covered in a sweet sauce came out with two pieces of bread, and two very mediocre sauces (BBQ and Miso Soy). My husband had the brisket on a hoagie roll, which was fine, not anything great but decent. Our french fries didn't come out, and when we told the bartender she acted as if she didn't know why they weren't out, instead of just saying she forgot to order them. (which was evident later on our bill)

After 15 minutes, my cold skinny fries and husbands fat fries came out hot. Surprisingly at the end of the whole ordeal, we were presented with a check for 44 dollars, without the french fries on the ticket. Ok, fine, I guess the whole thing was just a mediocre lunch, and maybe try again another time.

Surprisingly after we flagged the bartender down to let us pay, we were given our credit card receipt back WITH the fries added after! 

AMAZING! It is just another example of a restaurant with no love in the food, a staff who doesn't really care about what they are doing, food that isn't spectacular and its a shame!

Quietly shut door and head out. Exit casino left. A walkway, flowing water, fresh air and sun. wow, I needed that; what's this? A pub? Todd English Public Urban Bar (P.U.B.)?? I give it a go - air flowing through out, plenty of seats at the bar. Despite his rumored financial difficulties, this place managed to serve up some pretty sweet food. 

Started off with what I hate to admit was maybe the best bloody mary I've ever had. Pint glass rimmed with spicy Cajun pepper rub. Pickled carrots, onions, celery stalk and plenty of Grey Goose. Well prepared bloody mix, thick and substantial. Outstanding start, particularly when paired with a shot of Patron Silver. Ordered  1/2 dozen West Coast oysters, somewhere in Washington, bartender wasn't sure exactly where, no problem - they were clean, fresh, meaty and shucked with no damage to meat or shell. Excellent mignonette to accompany these bi-valves. 

In addition, a side of house made pickled veggies - baby carrots, onions, peppers, and pickles. Great pickling job. 

Followed by a free Guinness - actually make that two. You get them free, limit of two, if you can chug it before sand clock runs out, not a problem on this end. 

Confit of duck three ways or so it seems. Really a confit leg, some shredded duck and then a breast as well. Quite good, certainly not close to La Cote Basque NYC but pretty decent considering it is served at a bar at 1200pm in Las Vegas. Served by the half-pound or pound, a variety of dipping sauces and a choice of breads to make little sandwiches. The maple soy and black truffle mayo were my favorites. Add another shot of Patron and lunch comes to a close - time for a shower, a nap by the pool and off to the club later in the evening.",_NTm9Xv0gDfafBQxR3uUyQ,0,0,4,Ahz9OrcMG8TZVHEs2Cvmyw

Place was bustling for lunch, but surprisingly we were seated quickly. The English pub style atmosphere was very welcoming and cozy.

Moment we sat down our waiter greeted us and handed us the menu. Their menu offers an extensive selection pub style food like sandwiches, burgers, fish n chips, hot wings, sliders, salads and other small bites, including raw oyster bar. Average price $20-$26 on menu items so not cheap, but portions are generous and shareable.

We ordered corn beef reuben, ahi poke and lobster roll slider. Everything was fantastic. The lobster roll sliders were outstanding. Three lightly toasted, buttery buns were busting out the seams with good amount of lobster meat and was very tasty. The cole slaw and freshly made kettle chips were great sides and on point.

I noticed one of the tables across from me ordered an amazing looking bloody mary called ""All About Mary."" Wow! It was huge (check out my pic) and I wanted one too. Hefty price-tag of $35, but was amazingly good. The bloody mary was stacked with a beef slider, crispy chicken wing, chilled shrimp, corn dog pup, stuffed olives, celery, carrot, pickled asparagus and choice of vodka. I got the Belvedere vodka with mine and it was refreshing. Meal in a glass and everything was delicious. Definitely not just about the drink, but an experience. Note: Takes about 10 minute to make.

This is my kind of place - good food, great cocktails and perfect pub atmosphere. Plus we had been shopping all morning on Black Friday and were starving.

Headed here for their gourmet version of pub food. We ordered fish and chips and the chicken pot pie.

The fish and chips (around $20) weren't anything special. The fish, albeit the quality of the fish is very good, suffered from an overly heavy, crispy batter and too much salt. I'm not sure why there was battered and fried parsley on the plate either. Like eating fish and chips isn't bad enough as it is.

The chips weren't as crisp as they ought to be. The cole slaw had a combination of peas and cabbage - in the end, it had too much mayo, not enough acidity. 

The accompanying tartar had too much relish added to it. The malt vinegar aioli was unpleasant as well. Sour mayonaise? I'd like to stick to malt vinegar, thank you very much.

The chicken pot pie fared (around $20) better but still had some issues. Albeit the puff pastry on top was nice, there wasn't enough chicken and veggies underneath. The sauce was a little too thin and rendered the bottom part of the pastry to be too soggy.  Overall, had better chicken pot pie for less.

My overall experience was okay and the food wasn't bad... it just wasn't great. Despite the issues, the food alone would have been a 3.5. However, given the absurd prices given the quality, I would probably give it a 3 overall.",h9RUaaHa5kcQKqtJ-sgS0Q,5,4,3,DCys8BgsuYncrVSk6JDijg

We usually come in around noon-ish on Sundays and we've never had to wait. With the hungover crowds lining up at buffets across the way at  Bellagio or Rio, Todd English has been quite peaceful each time we've visited. The longest we've had to wait (for a group of 6+) has been around 10 minutes.

The first thing we usually order is the bucket of Traditional Pickles - definitely wakes up the taste buds. My Vegas trips are not the same without them. 

My boyfriend has gotten oysters from the Raw Bar and on occasion, an oyster shooter or two...and he's loved it. I can never join in on the shellfish escapades due to my obnoxious seafood allergies. Big booooo's. :(

Because we usually dine with a group, I've gotten to try a little of everything. 

Appetizers:
I'd recommend the Ahi Tuna ""Poke"", Duck Buns or Caesar Salad. All pretty tasty yet not too rich. Perfect for a first course.

Main courses:
- The Veggie Muffuletta is sooooo tasty and not too overwhelming. If you like sandwiches, or you're veggie, I'd definitely recommend it (with EXTRA salsa verde).
- The Skirt Steak is to die for. You might also want a side of salsa verde sauce to go with it. Perfect flavors for a Vegas brunch.
- How do you go wrong with sliders? Especially BLT sliders?!? And those crispy skinny fries? Ahh heaven!!! You might want to ask for a side of the black truffle mayo to dip those fries in...or maybe that's just me.
- And if you like a meaty mouthful (o__O), you can always order meat by the pound at their Carvery. Prime beef, corned beef (my favorite), brisket, pastrami...you name it, they'll carve it fresh for you. Pick a choice of bread + sauces and you have yourself a meaty manwich. It's almost too good to be true.

They've also got a hefty collection of beers & beer cocktails. However, I stick to the girly stuff. I've had their bloody mary's, Bellinis, and their Grow A Pear cocktails...and I'm absolutely in love with the latter. Perfect hint of sweetness. Great as dessert actually.

As for the vibe, like I said earlier, it's never been busy when we've gone so I'm not sure how it is with crazy crowds...it is a pub, after all. I do love the layout though, it feels open and never congested; the bar is in the middle of the restaurant, like at Yardhouse. 

I've enjoyed this restaurant/pub each time we've gone. Todd English Pub has definitely become our Vegas Sunday-morning tradition.",uTyxPl9ieZ-nNeN0EpwUnQ,2,2,4,KfqgUQYk9RYxuwnzvfnfDQ

Now, let me be clear.  I do not have that skill with any sort of liquid.  But some of my friends do so it was fun to go with them and watch.  The promotion used to be unlimited.  But, as these things go, the rumor from the staff is that someone ruined it by chugging 11 Guinesses in a short amount of time, bringing up questions of potential alcohol poisoning and lawsuits.  So they limited to 8 beers.  Fine.  That's reasonable.

But then they limited to 4 beers for no apparent reason. Now the promotion, which part of their logo and permanent decor, is limited to 2 beers.  

Their other promotion, 5 cent PBR night, has also gotten lame.  At first, when they started it in April, it was so laid back.  We'd sit at the bar and order the 5 cent PBRs (served in 8 oz plastic cups) during the requisite hours (Tues after 9pm).  Now, even if you spend $50+ at the bar beforehand, they make you get up and go outside to get a wristband.  I get that the promotion has become popular but, cmon.  If we've been sitting at the bar already, you hopefully know we are of age.  Just give us the damn wristband instead of making us go out in the cold to get it!

Oh, here's an interesting incident.  During 5 cent PBR night, the staff made a group a girls get up and give up their seats at the bar to a guy who wanted to order food.  The guy was extremely uncomfortable with this but the staff was insistent... they wanted the sale.  The guy made up for it by being nice to the girls, buying them drinks (besides 5 cent PBR) etc.  But WTF?

Finally, the food has gone way downhill.  The dirty chips used to be extremely craveable.  Last time I got them, the portion size was smaller and they were nasty and soggy.  

The staff here has been really good to me.  They'd make recommendations and let me try drinks beforehand that they thought were questionable.  I even got some free refills on cocktails and beer.  It was a fun place to go and chat with the nice bartenders.  I like the staff and really want to like this place, but I think management has cut corners for some reason and screwed it all up.

They are plenty for two to share and they are insanely good.  I stuffed myself silly with them and would have eaten another full order if I had been wearing sweat pants with Spandex and didn't care about living maybe just a few years longer.

The drink menu is frankly so varied and extensive as to be incredible and the prices are high for just about all food and drinks on the menu, but you're in Las Vegas so I don't want to hear whining about high prices.  If you pay a lot and get quality in return, I'm ok with that.

Last, the music is insanely, ridiculously, offensively, needlessly and obnoxiously loud.

I had the signature Brown Butter Lobster Rolls ($24) and my wife had their CBLT ($19). The shake wasn't that sweet and tasted like melted vanilla ice cream goodness. The lobster rolls came with 3 mini lobster rolls and house made potato chips. As a first timer eating a lobster roll, I thought it was pretty rich tasting and delicious. A little too much butter for me but thats about it. The chips had a nice crispy, crunchy to them that lets you know they didn't come from a bag. My wife gave her sandwich an 8/10.

My table was across the room and were the normal table which is extremely hard on my knees (that is why I asked for the barstool table).
The menu was a scaled down version of the past, almost no vegetable sides and most of the menu was potato based which makes it hard for someone with a food allergy.
But, the food was ok, the presentation was non-existent and the service all depends on your wait staff. The waiter we began with was pretty good and attentive. When the shift changed the service fell off a cliff, we were constantly trying to find our waitress and most of the time she was off in a corner talking to other members of the staff or watching the game.

P.U.B. does seem like the Yard House or something similar - lots of beers, bar-type atmosphere, nice and lit up with patio seating if you wish. We sat inside and the first thing we noticed were the humorous placemats that have lots of intersting beer quotes on them. 

Our service was okay, one of the 2 things that knocked this down from 5 stars. The waitress took a LONG time to bring us our beers; my girlfriend ordered a 2nd beer during her meal that didn't arrive until she was completely done with it, thus negating the point of a beer. The waitress made no attempt to comp things like bringing out the other kind of tea because they didn't have the one we wanted, or bringing things out late. Although she did apologize. 

The food itself was amazing, and that's where all 4 stars come in and then some. We started with the mussel cocktail which comes out with delicious sauces and about 12 pieces for only 5 bucks. I ordered from the carvery - lamb, and went with the waitresses' recommendation of sauces - horseradish sour cream and pineapple sauce on pita. It was amazing, paired with sweet potato fries (ask for ranch to dip). My girlfriend got the burger which was really good, my brother went with the grichebachtom which was an interesting twist on a grilled cheese sandwitch that turned out very well. 

The beer selection was awesome, and so were the cocktails. I forget the name of my cocktail but it was gin, cucumber, st. germain, and a couple of other things. It really hit the spot, and the beers my party ordered did too, however some of them were extremely overpriced in my opinion. Another thing which was priced high was the raw bar with seafood options - 4.50$ per shrimp for a shrimp cocktail. The oysters were delicious but everything else was pretty damn expensive. 

Overall a great place to go for lunch; expect to drop around 20$ on the entree, 10-15$ a drink, at the least. Minus one star for high prices and not-so-great service.

Food - good
Lobster roll was very tasty.  Came here with my wife and two friends and all four of us liked what we ordered

Price - good
A little expensive by 'normal' standards but definitely reasonable by 'Vegas strip' standard

Atmosphere/decor - very good
A very good looking place, lively, cozy, with a nice outdoor area.

Service -  Inadequate
We went in for brunch and the inside space was half full; as most people wanted to sit outside (there was a wait for the patio) on this particular sunny day.
Our waiter was lacking energy and perhaps lacking proper training.

The food was extremely slow.  I'm not sure whether the kitchen was backed up (doubt it, as they were only half full) or whether there was a mistake.  
Anyways, as 15 minutes became 25, 35, and finally 45 (I knew for sure since I checked in on social media when we were seated) the waiter never came by to explained to us what was happening.  We even had to flag him to get more water.

As patience was running thin I finally confronted him about the wait.  He then said 'oh yes, your ticket is next'.  I replied 'can you bring something for us to nibble? I'm really hungry'.  He said 'well, do you want bread?'.  Yes, please, we responded.  He went back but never came back o bring back bread.  No bread, no apology.

As we were walking out he called me and said the charge didn't go through.  Upon double checking my name and room number I realized at this point we were already 1 hour past my checkout time (we were there 1 hour 45 minutes).
This was finally, the first time he apologized about the wait.

Experience:
The staff was very friendly.  I loved the ambiance and decor.  However, I don't go to restaurants for the ambiance and decor.

Food:
They do a great job on the sides, but fail miserably on the main entree.  I ordered the following:

1. Bison burger- they put way too much blue cheese, it over powers the burger.  I had to cut off the top of the patty, because it was making me nausea
2. Steak tacos- the steak was over cooked, which made it too chewy.  The grilled corn and black bean mix was really good, but I don't like spending $20 for corn and beans
3. Side of mac and cheese- great, but it takes a lot to mess up mac&cheese
4. Chicken parm sliders- decent, but nothing special

I came here on a weekday and even though there were a share of tourists and locals, this place was very full at the bar area.  Most of the staff were very chatty...there was a little bit of a back and forth between two staff workers on who really was the more devoted Kobe Bryant and Lakers fan!

I got three oysters plus a pint of Lagunitas from my beloved city of San Francisco and later on some sweet potato fries.  With happy hour pricing, all of that fell under $20.  I did try their Deschutes Inversion IPA but since it was a cask beer, they served it room temp which sort of turned me off.  I realized I need my beer cold.  The oysters were fresh and a steal at $2 each.  

Now to the beer selection: although they do offer a lot of selections and I saw the taps all around the bar to show it, I wasn't as impressed as I thought.  My usual excitement when I go to a place with lots of draught beers, is to find something that I haven't tried and usually it's an unique brew that is hard to find or something like that.  Out of all of the beers that were offered, I think I've tried at least half of them and most of the other half I didn't really want to try.  I was hoping maybe to see some smaller breweries from Southern California or Portland but I saw a lot of familiar names: Sam Adams, Trumer Pils, Shock Top, and Sierra Nevada.

It's still a good place to go for a drink and to watch the game but maybe I'm a beer snob.

Lobster Rolls - I honestly got this because apparently this is one of the more popular items.  While these were decent, I would not recommend them to anyone ESPECIALLY if you have never had a lobster roll in the past.  The lobster they use doesn't have a genuine sweetness to it and they load it with lobster claws, which in my opinion, lacks flavor and texturally is off-putting.  For what it was it was decent, but being that it was DROWNING in mayo turned me off.  Lobster is rich as is, so let the lobster speak for itself.  For certain they do not use maine lobster (a more traditional lobster roll approach) because as I mentioned, the sweetness was greatly lacking.

Sliders - Definitely get these with the truffle mayo.  I do not say this because I am hyped up on truffle, but because I truly enjoy truffle.  Unless you don't mind regular ol' thousand island then stick to that.

Belgian Beer Flight - loved this, all 5 were superb and different.

Sour beer - I absolutely adore sours and this tasted as if you bit into a sour apple and chased each bite with a nice red.

I had the casked Black Butte Porter, and it was amazing!  Served at room temperature, and not very carbonated, you could taste all of the fine flavors in this well crafted porter.  It was a bad choice for my Tomato and Onion salad with blue cheese dressing, but it was worth it!

The beer choices are some of the best on The Strip, and they are the only establishment serving casked beer.  I probably would have settled with a 3 star review, but that fact is pretty impressive. 

The food was pretty good.  I only had that Tomato and onion salad, which is just that.. two thick slices of yummy tomato and two slices of onion.  It is more of an appetizer than a real salad.

We actually came here twice during our weekend trip, and it was a solid choice for both food and a wide beer selection (I think we even had champagne?). The style of the restaurant is fun -- it's got that modern pub look that's not trying too hard to look old, and there is a great little patio area for people watching. Although we did get some odd looks for sitting out there, but hey December in Vegas is basically summer to Seattleites like us! 

One word of warning: if you're planning on using your Aria dining credit here you technically can't. I only found this out after checkout that the credit only applies to restaurants ""in Aria."" After about a half-second of stating my confusion to the customer service associate said not to worry about it and applied the credit anyway.

We ordered salads for our entrees cuz damn....we needed something healthy after 2 days of eatin' like a tourist. My boyfriend ordered the iceberg wedge salad $14 and I ordered a chicken cesar salad $14 + added chicken for $8. Wait...so you're telling me it cost $22 for a normal chicken cesar salad!? WOW!!!!!!!!! That's sad. I guess in order for you to be ""healthy,"" you gotta cough up some cash. He enjoyed his wedge salad but I thought mine was just ok.

Burgers and sliders can range anywhere from $18-25. Chicken and waffles were $24. Fish and chips were $25. (ouch!)

Stumbled upon this place after wandering around Aria and City Center on our first night in Vegas and the P.U.B. won over my fiance in a hurry.  Came in for some delectable brews and of course, these sweet potato fries.  Tried a multiple number of drinks and each one was delicious!  The Mead is FANTASTIC... especially for people like me who aren't into hoppy and bitter beers.  Also the Strawberry Lambic Mojito is delicious and I highly recommend it for anyone who wants something less brewy and more cocktaily. Oh, but I haven't even told you the best part.  LATE NIGHT HAPPY HOUR is the jam!  Great drink specials and good deals on appetizers.  YES PLEASE!!

The food is pretty good too...we obviously came back for more than just fries before we left Vegas (very helpful that we were staying at Vdara).  Split a chicken sandwich for lunch - definitely splitable for two people without enormous appetites.  Topped off with a couple of drinks and we were in business.  The Bloody Mary's were all the rage on Saturday afternoon for brunch but I'm not a Bloody Mary drinker myself so I passed.

2629485,2012-03-14,3,dn_ipqbm7_jUz5X3rDez_A,"Todd English's Public Urban Bar is located at the City Center Aria Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.  For years I have wanted to go to a Todd English place in Vegas ( he has three of them) and so this vacation my wife, Simone and i did.  The first problem I had was actually finding the entrance. You can see the place from the inside of Aria but the only entrance that i could find was from the outside walkway. At any rate, when we got to the P.U.B, the place was rather large and it was packed full of people. our waitress was able to squeeze us in at a table once again right beside the restrooms (this always happens to me). While I took advantage of being so close to the crapper Simone took a look at the menus. The P.U.B features an open kitchen so you can watch the chefs making the food. This is always a good thing as it helps pass the time while you wait for your meal and also gives you a good indication of the quality of the place. The menu is extensive with a complete carvery menu for those meat lovers that includes turkey, beef, duck, chicken and more. Also a raw bar and many grill choices. Simone and I started with an appetizer called Duck Buns.  These were extra large Hoison shredded Duck filled steamed dumplings. They were topped with scallions and served with Ailoi for dipping. They were pillowey and soft on the outside and the duck overflowing from them was steaming hot and tender. They were a very good start to our meal.  Next up were the entrees. Simones choice was, of course, a salad. The chopped Salad to be exact, and that is what it looked like when it arrived.  A bunch of vegetables and lettuce, chopped with dressing. Simone liked it. I didn't bother to even take a picture, that's how excited it made me, but i suppose its hard to make a bunch of rabbit food all that special. Perhaps stupidly so, I went a bit more adventurous with my meal. I went for the Brown Bag Lunch. Artisan Bologna Sandwich on simple white bread with melted cheese and Mayo and a side of chips.  I have not had Bologna in years and about 8 hours later ,I would remember why, but i digress. The Bologna was sliced thin and grilled until the edges were crispy then served on white bread with melted Swiss.  When it arrived at the table it looked kinda pornographic but I dug in anyway. It was definitely artisan and homemade, not your lunch meat variety Bologna. It was kicking with lots of spice and garlic. Good, but perhaps to spicy for my already pickled stomach after a week long battle with gluttony in the City of Vegas.  Being the trooper that I am, I pushed through and finished the entire sandwich and then of course had to move on to the dessert menu.  We went with the Mona-Resee dessert option, basically it was a tasting plate that included homemade Twinkies, a cupcake, red velvet cake, a cookie and even some cookie dough. Simone and I both enjoyed this and Simone took some with her for the rest of her late night chocolate fixes. But this is not where this review ends...as mentioned earlier,  I feel the need to share with you the aftermath of my meal choice .  The Bologna bit me back  at around midnight. The word Fire comes to mind, Not just your average heartburn situation- this burned EVERYWHERE. And it hung on. Three Zantacs, and a night of getting to know my hotel throne and Todd English and his meat were still with me. It took me almost the next twenty four hours to feel well again and it made for a rather rough last day in Vegas ( sorry to the hotel janitorial staff). I wish I could honestly say that I will not hold it against the P.U.B, but I probably will. I can tell you for a fact my Bologna days are over.  Even doing this review today my stomach turns just a bit at the memory.  Maybe someday I will go back to the P.U.B , but who knows? Sorry Todd, I so wanted to love your new place... but it stayed with me for way to long. Thanks for the memories...Two stars for the PUB. **",jyvmC6G9S0LnkJgHrW_12Q,1,1,2,JsdpkEJDTuP5oxPIYJtCVw

Showed up at the restaurant to find that the restaurant was entirely booked for a private party event. Obviously there was no way we were going to dine there. However, what was rude and annoying was that the manager kept on saying that they did not know what had happened. I showed all my email and text confirmations which he took a good 5 minutes reading thru ( seriously it was a short short email) and questioned is if the date was right. He didn't trust us which was offensive. I know what the problem was! You didn't shut off your automated reservation system, you idiot! What's so hard about that?

He finally admitted that our reservations were correct but there was nothing he could do. I said I wouldn't mind just leaving but i had tried to make reservations at several places nearby and they were all booked. The one other reservation I had at a different place I had cancelled. So I was left without a place to go for dinner. I asked if he could get me a reservation elsewhere using his connections.  That is all I wanted, another place to dine at. He couldn't do much but did call and found 
bar seating at Social House.

First, the pretzels effing rocked.  SO freaking good and came with cheese sauce for dipping.   Then the fish and chips were delish.  I found it weird that the cole slaw was full of peas, but it was tasty when the peas were pushed out of the dish.  The fish and chips, including the dip[ping sauces ROCKED.   My husband's wings were good.  The best part was our server was fab.  He had it all down and we dug the service.  I think the only thing that was king of a bummer was this place is pricey.

The brisket was very good as there was a lot of flavor and it was really, really well cooked.  The ribs were alright, although the barbeque glaze on top of the ribs was really strong....The cole slaw was good and light, but the beans to me were really sweet.....a little too sweet for me.

We were home visiting my parents for Memorial Day but did 1 night at the Aria. After checking in we wanted a quick bite but didn't want to ruin our appetites for Hakkasan later so popped over here on a recommendation from the front desk agent. Obviously Todd English has a renowned reputation and resume to match, but judge this for what it is, a casual pub with a luxurious twist. He already has a 5-star elegant restaurant on the strip at Bellagio, Olives, so why compare? 

It's a fun atmosphere with outdoor seating in front of the pond outside Crystals shopping center and the Aria lobby. Inside is decked out with red leather booths, a large circular bar, and expansive tables. They have a sports theme and happy hour deals, so we ordered the wings which were a dollar a piece and were really really yummy. The perfect blend of crispy and tender, spicy and mild, dunked in blue cheese sauce. Then we split a lobster cobb salad which I believe is one of their signature items for good reason. We both had huge portions even though we split one order, and they were very generous with the lobster. 

The next morning all of the breakfast places at Aria were teeming with lines of tourists and we just weren't in the mood so we came back here! I had a dish that I may have possibly come up with in a dream:

Bagel tacos (shell made from crispy thin bagel slices) filled with scrambled eggs, lox, sour cream, and caviar, served with a side of mixed greens tossed in a champagne vinaigrette. Whoaaaaaaaaa buddy this was amazing. T had a corned beef hash topped with poached eggs that was served in a personal sized cast iron skillet.

There were women walking around who were literally busting, BUSTING, out of their red gingham bustiers hawking customized bloody marys which were pretty cool.

The atmosphere. Everyone seems happy. It's extremely loud, so probably not a good place for a meeting and more of a place to have fun and drink lots of beer. There's TVs everywhere - good place to watch a game.

The restaurant itself was mostly empty and it showed in the staff. To say uninterested is an understatement. It seemed as though working that night was a chore for every staff member we observed.

We ordered some fried pickles for the table as well as Todd's tacos, Caesar salad, and Prime Rotisserie sandwich as entrees. I also ordered one of their adult shakes - the Brass Monkey.

The pickles arrived first and were a bit disappointing. The menu states ""house made"" pickles, so I was not expected pickle slices but instead wedges. These were very thinly sliced pickles that did not hold onto the batter very well. The pickles came with three different sauces, all of which tasted as though they came out of a jar instead of being homemade. For $11, I just expected something more (order this dish in Texas and you walk away saying WOW).

The taco's were average at best. Expected much more from them considering they bear the chef's name. The sandwich was more of the same with nothing that really stood out and had rather bland tasting onions. The Caesar salad was completely forgettable with one of the worst dressings I have ever tasted. It was very thin and tasted like watered down cream.

The best part of the meal was the shake, which was great. Rich banana flavor and plenty of chocolate to fill up that sweet tooth.

This was far and away the most disappointing food experience we had the entire time we were at the Aria. Stay away as there has to be a better ""Pub"" experience in Vegas.",hCRWlhOt3M-qFOAaMn2gFQ,0,0,2,05jP0ffcyq4UZVSk_MVnWg

2787057,2010-10-15,0,dn_ipqbm7_jUz5X3rDez_A,"Staying at the ""Death Ray"" (Vdara), and wanted someplace for lunch.  The City Center ""complex"" has turned (apparently) into a home away from home for us -- last time we were at the Mandarin Oriental, and ""Crystals"" is the adjoining shopping center/mall where Todd English's P.U.B. is located.  My wife and I checked out the menu prior to leaving Berkeley, and knew this would be a great spot for lunch . . . 

Todd English is like the under-the-radar Bobby Flay.  Aside from the Home Shopping Network (or is it QVC?), you really don't see him on television much, but between Olive's, Figs, and who knows what else, he's everywhere!  But this is his first and, to date, only PUB (or Public Urban Bar).  

Countless beers on tap -- I think over 60 -- including some cask conditioned ales (yes!), the food is close to perfect, and the portions are HUGE!  Lynn and I made the delicious mistake of ordering too much food, and thank heavens reinforcements arrived to help us finish!

We had something called ""Dirty Chips"" -- America's answer to nachos, this is sinfully good and truly dangerous!  Kettle chips tossed in bleu cheese, bits of amazingly delicious bacon, scallions, and served with fried chicken livers . . . just add beer and a football game and you're in heaven (albeit on a rapid descent to hell, if your doctor ever finds out!).  Seriously delicious, but don't order this unless you can share it with at least three other people!  (And if you try it on your own, make sure to have one of those defibrillators they have in airports at the ready!)

The iceberg wedge with bleu cheese and a bacon vinaigrette, avocado, tomato, and chopped egg is a classic, and served ice cold; the duck buns (three to an order) with shredded duck, hoisin and scallions were better than they had a right to be (delicious, though better at a true dim sum palace, to be honest).  And then, we moved onto the mains . . . 

Lynn had the pastrami sliders -- three excellent little sandwiches on rye parker house rolls, with kraut, swiss cheese and served with skinny fries . . . OK, I had one of the three.

I opted for the brown butter lobster rolls -- three rolls filled with freshly shucked lobster, warm brown butter aioli, served with slaw and kettle chips -- as if we hadn't had enough of those already!

All this paired beautifully with pints of Chimay white (in the proper glasses, BTW) -- a very filling, but very delicious lunch.  In fact, it's almost noon as I write this . . . maybe I'll have lunch there today, too.

Two more notes:

1) ""Good for kids,"" as always, will depend more upon the kids than the restaurant.

We were staying at the Aria and weren't yet ready to head to the airport and so decided on this place.  What was nice is that whenever I checked in here on Yelp I got a check-in offer for a free bud light.  While I am not in any way a bud light fan and often avoid it, I love anything free and so eagerly accepted my beer.  Since it was a nice day we decided to sit outside and so I cant really comment on any of the decor inside of the restaurant.

For lunch my fiance and I decided to start off our meal by splitting the fried pickles appetizer.  We were pleasantly surprised by the mound of pickle chips that came out and were also impressed by the choice of three dipping sauces: a BBQ, a Blue cheese and my favorite, a spicy sauce.   The pickles were fried nicely and had a good crisp to them and I enjoyed pairing them with the different sauces.  For my lunch entree I decided to go with the Caesar salad after a week of gluttonous eating while my fiance decided on the lobster Cobb salad.  She was nice enough to let me enjoy two of the claws and the lobster was good being sweet, tender and seasoned perfectly.  My Caesar salad was decent sized although I was a little confused whenever it came out topped with tomatoes.  Yes it helped dress up the presentation but I have never seen tomatoes on a Caesar salad before.  The salad was also loaded with dressing which I personally love but know that many do not.  It tasted decent enough but wasn't anything terribly exciting, not that I was expecting it to be.

The bottom line from me is that I would head back here again in the future.  It had a great location with outdoor seating in-between the Aria and Crystals and some of the food was really good too.",4m9NXICYBC5i9t4aTt-I6w,0,0,4,AXVC0aydPxo7ITOXszG01w

Served on a plate of ice with cocktail sauce and malt vinegar with a line, it was so freaking good.

The menu had a carvery section that seemed to be their specialty and was the only thing that wasn't too cliche sounding (or crazy sounding), so I ordered the half pound of pastrami. The meat was so thick and delicious. By far, the best sauce was the black truffle mayo!! The horseradish sauce was alright too.

Although still noticeably huge, it was chewy and pretty bland. I had a choice of choosing the black truffle mayo [there wasn't enough (synthetic) truffle oil, I tasted no truffle] and apple butter sauce. 

Also, DO NOT take those dirty chips home. Ever bit into a soggy bleu cheese chip? Not the smartest to decision to take this to-go, but if an after-club inebriated snack still tastes bad -- it's really freakin' bad.

Check in and they reward you with a free beer. We ordered fried pickles to start. It was accompanied by 3 unique sauces and was very good. For entree we tackled the foot long hotdog. This is a meal and then some and is accompanied by skinny fries. The dog is all beef and full of flavor. The fries are crispy and seasoned perfectly. Service is quick and friendly.

Even though we did ask the employees here at this restaurant whether it would count, and they said it would - lame! 

Regardless, this place is super over-hyped and over-priced. I didn't find any of the food to be fabulous or that great. We ordered 2 or 3 rounds of oysters, I found them to be small and nothing spectacular. Then we ordered 2 rounds of chicken wings which were yummy. And we also had the onion rings, which are HUGE, but I didn't find the flavor to be that great, but then again I'm not a fan of onion rings.

Well, this establishment is an old school looking English pub with some exquisite food. The hidden gem is the weekend  ""IT'S ALL ABOUT MARY"" signature Bloody Mary. The spicy morning pick me up cocktail provided  Frank pep in his your step after a night out of partying in SIN CITY. The special SINFUL BLEND of Mary mix with top shelf vodka is very spicy affair but a powerful morning neutralizer that not only cured my hangover but filled my belly. This amazing cocktail is not only filled with plenty of vodka but stuffed with a mountain of snacks consisting of a chicken wing, grilled prawn, olives, pickled asparagus, mini corndog, 3 celery sticks and mini cheeseburger. This drink is truly experience, but with a $35 price tag it should be.


As for my lunch I shared Prime rib dip and cast iron plate of brisket chili smoothed in Cheese & onions. The chili was exceptional with plenty of beans and meat all through the skillet. A worthy treat for chili lovers looking for something with a beer.

And thirsty.
For beer, in my case.

We had set our views on Todd English PUB before race, thinking that it was far enough from Mandalay Bay to be spared by runners. And since we had parked our car in the Aria - we just had to eat ourselves silly, roll out of the restaurant and into the car, set autopilot to the hotel and go to bed.
Easy enough.

But the place was totally hopping when we arrived, and we were told that it would be a 45-minute wait. Bummer. Fear not, dear friends. We managed to grab seats at the bar, sit down (felt like heaven) and went to business.

The place is nice and definitely ""urban pub""-like. And the menu was quite appetizing (but what wouldn't be after such an ordeal?); I ordered just before the last call a glorious shepherd's pie that was probably the best I have had in my life. Big chunks of beef AND lamb in a luscious ragu sauce, fluffy potatoes, generous layer of melted cheese - the ultimate comfort meal. But it was $18. OK. I get it. You are paying for the name, and the craft.
But when you go on the beer menu and see that a pint of PBR is priced $9 - you have to wonder. Who are they kidding here? Fine, we are in Vegas. On the Strip. But PBR is PBR. I couldn't get over it. I ended up choosing the only ""reasonable"" choice on this insanely extravagant drink menu - a combo PBR tall boy and a shot of Jameson for $14.

2965057,2012-04-13,4,dn_ipqbm7_jUz5X3rDez_A,"Although rarely a foodie haven, English Pubs have always had a soft spot in my heart. Cheap food that is usually decent, and reasonably priced imported draft beer is usually enough to keep my happy. 

I had been hearing about the Todd English PUB in Vegas for awhile and wanted to try it out. 

This is really more of a high end gastro pub than a traditional 'old school' English Pub. So the food was solid.

The Shepards Pie was a 5 star home run. One of the best I've ever had. Huge chucks of moist meat, soft potatoes with a yummy crust, and a gravy sauce that will make your knees weak. (seriously, be sure you're sitting down)

The Duck Buns were a surprise. Seriously, Duck Buns in a English Pub? I figured they were reaching outside their wheelhouse to try and be a little too diverse. But I was wrong. The plum bbq sauce was a little too salty I think, but the duck was super juicy and the buns were perfect. 

The beer however... ouch. First of all, they advertise hundreds of beers on tap. So me being German... I was excited. But they were out of the first beer I ordered. So I picked another one. Out of that one too. Hmmm. OK, let's try my third choice. Yep, also out. Yikes. Usually I'm a three strikes and you're out kind of guy, but I finally said ""Let's make this easier. What DO you have in stock?""

I finally chose a Black Butte Porter (one of my favorites from my days in Oregon) and a flight of 4 tastings. They are pretty proud of their beer here. That Black Butte Porter... $15! Wow, you can get the same thing at Yardhouse for $8. The sampler flight... $20. Holy crap! $5 for each shot glass of beer? Talk about buyers remorse.

The service was also hit and miss. For the first 20 minutes or so our waitress was on it. Then she disappeared for over an hour and we had to flag down other table's waitresses for water and extra napkins.

Still, the quality food makes this place a solid 3 stars. Would I go back? Yes, but I'd probably skip the beer next time and just focus on food. Kind of the opposite of why you usually go to a English Pub though.",Br8LOacyANG7nI9r0DRqLQ,5,5,3,RReCbxuIQL5DYO4yKsm0Tw

This is the newest of Todd English restaurants in Vegas and is located at Crystals in City Center.  I found this place on Opentable and made reservations for 3 to celebrate my niece's engagement and pregnancy, and we were seated immediately upon arrival.

There is a nicely sized bar near the entrace where you don't need a reservation to sit and eat or drink.  You may  notice their hour glasses at every other seat and wonder, ""just what the heck is this?""  Well, their theme is the seven second beer.  If you can down any of their beers in 7 seconds you get it for free.  It's a great gimmick and one that makes this bar a whole lot of fun.

I did arrive in the afternoon, though, and skipped the beer.  We requested a booth and that's exactly what we received.  Our server was nice and explained their menu, which is separated into parts as most are.  They have their seafood appetizers, their carney--assorted meats sold in 1/2 pound or 1 pound orders with bread and your choice of sauce--sammies, and sides.  Their wine menu is very extensive and quite impressive for a pub, so make sure to check it out while you're there.  

We ordered a 1/2 pound of lamb for an appetizer with pita and black truffle mayo, mini corn dogs with fries, their grilled cheese and a fried bologna sandwich.  I know what you're thinking--this food sounds too simple and not worth the money.  WRONG!  Their portions are huge and definitely not the type of grilled cheese or bologna I could make at home.  Here's the breakdown of the meal:

1/2lb lamb with black truffle mayo and pita: As suggested by our waiter, we went with the bread and sauce he recommended, although there are several choices.  The lamb is so tender, juicy, and seasoned just right.  I cannot believe how good that lamb is, and is one of the reasons I'll go there on a regular basis.  I wanted to order the other meats to try, but a 1/2lb can serve three people in all honesty.  Great starter.  It's a meal as well, if you prefer, but you can request it to come out as an appetizer if you choose.

Corn dogs: cute miniature corn dogs that are great!  They make their own corn batter and fries, all truly good and better than those frozen ones I buy at the market for sure.  They do not have any condiments on the table--that's because they make their ketchup and mustard!  I dipped my dogs in their ketchup, which is slightly sweeter than the store bought, but I liked it.

Grilled Cheese: it's named something weird on the menu, but you'll recognize it from the description.  They use several cheeses and throw in sliced heirloom tomatoes and applewood smoked bacon, too. It's panini pressed into their fresh bread and served with your choice of fries.  I went for sweet potato fries and I ate it all up!  the grilled cheese is definitely for cheese lovers only.  They use a stronger cheese mix, so beware.  However, it's lovely, gooey, and huge!  I had to share it with my niece's boyfriend because I couldn't finish the sandwich alone.  i did, however, eat the entire bucket of sweet potato fries with their house ketchup.  I love how sweet they are but with that salty outside.  It's also a great alternative to the regular potato fry.

Fried bologna sammie with fatty fries: My niece loved it!  i tried a piece of the deli sliced bologna and I'll never eat store-bought again!  It was salty and had that nice pork flavor to it, and when it's fried in butter, it tastes even better!  Again, huge portions--enough for 2--and the fatty fries were well seasoned with simple salt.  Great hangover food choice, I think.

We didn't try any of their desserts and I am not sure if they have a dessert menu because I didn't ask.  However, I doubt anyone would eat anything after a regular order of food!

You have to ask your server what they recommend for the day because they know what's best.  Let them know your tastes, and they'll guarantee a great meal!

Overall, I'm thrilled with this pub and will be a regular here for lunch and dinner.  I'm hooked on their carney part of the menu and will deem this my meat restaurant of choice in vegas.  If you love pubs and want a great meal any time of day, you have to stop into this place.  It is definitely worth the price!",o68A_3bAJTge-ioGXHdxKA,3,3,4,h47xz5gncRnsDl7mmq7idg

The chips still had the potato skin on which is not a crime but for the prices you are paying I expect proper British chips ( the sort you get at the chippy down the high street).  

To their credit, the shepherds pie was excellent.  Really good portion with nice flavorful mince at the bottom .  That was their only saving grace.   

The other thing we ordered was a chicken pot pie . The only good thing was the peas and carrots on top. The chicken was kind of tasteless and the pastry ( if you can call it that) was a breadth doughy mess.  I expect a good puff pastry or even a decent shortcrust pastry in a chicken pot pie .

You can get fries for a side, but I opted for the vegetables, which included pickled cauliflower and pickled peppers. (I happen to love pickled anything, but to each his own).

Beer selection is the best I've seen on the strip (even have Founders from my home state of Michigan--I live in Seattle now). Also had the Dragonsmilk stout on tap feom Holland, MI.

Like everywhere else on the strip, the place is a bit pricey. The good beers run about $15 a pint. (My turkey meal, however, ran $20, which is decent given the quality and location.) But, hey. you're in Vegas. Expect to spend some $.",ohSA_njMpfYyo7dQvgOQtA,1,1,5,tgrdCNsSvsRstqPj2mU9cw

This gastropub sets out spicy popcorn on the tables instead of bread and is pretty open. Nice for our big group of 15.  A little pricey, (but it is Vegas) and I felt that my menu options were a bit limited in the way of veggie friendly/pescatarian options.

My order: Veggie Portatbello Mushroom ""burger"" on a roll served with bucket of pickled veggies

The portabello mushrooms must have been chopped up and mixed into the spinach as I really didn't see or barely taste them in my sandwich. Perhaps they were buried under the grilled bell peppers and melted cheese but I had to dig deep to find them. The side of pickled veggies was an interesting addition, but I think I would have preferred them unpickled or maybe just a side salad.

They were able to accommodate our fairly large party without a problem.  This was key in deciding where we would eat that night.  Since there were so many of us we decided the best thing to do would be to order just about one of each appetizer and split them between everyone.  This turned out to be such a great idea since the breadth of items on the menu is huge!  I ended up having everything from lobster rolls to fried pickles to tuna.  They have an excellent drink selection which completes the experience.

I have to point one thing in particular - the horseradish that comes with the oysters on the half shell.  It was like nothing I have ever had in my life - I really mean it.  It was so strong and tasty I had to ask the waiter what brand it was.  He said the name is ""Atomic"" available on Amazon if your interested.  It's so powerful you need to watch how much you put on...it'll clear your sinuses to say the least.  Definitely makes the oysters.

One small complaint is that there is no entrance to the restaurant that is connected to the lobby of the ARIA.  There are faux windows that open up to the lobby but you can't actually get inside unless you leave the lobby and go next door.

Creamy delicious inside, perfect fluffy crust.  Served absurdly hot though.  The best tasting thing on the table was probably the lobster rolls.  Perhaps the most beautiful looking sandwich I've ever seen, from bright red lobster meat to glistening buttery rolls.

We had read the full menu earlier in the day while doing the touristy thing and decided to come back.

Damn you, tequila!!!
I got their very refreshing mojito and the boy and I shared the chicken parm sliders, the sweet potato fries and a Caesar salad. The salad was a Caesar... come on, how can you mess up a Caesar? I appreciated the addition of tomatoes though...  the fries were also yummy, not at all greasy or burnt (could have been a bit hotter)... the stars were the chicken parm sliders. Tiny cheesy morsels of goodness sandwiched between little fluffy buns that you can add a lettuce/tomato mix to... deeeeeelish.
Service was good... not overly friendly, but adequate. The thing that I will remember most is the ambiance... very man-friendly, but more of a modern Mad-Men off-duty type of way. I also realized that this is the same place that I had heard of that gives you your beer for free IF you are able to drink it in under seven seconds.

Luckily Todd English P.U.B. carries the good stuff! While my friends have gotten the mimosas on prior visits and can totally vouch for them, it's the bloody mary bar that is truly impressive. For your spirit, they have a choice of 7 mid and top shelf liquors (all the same price) or 5 varieties of infused vodkas. These include cucumber, bacon, habanero, tomato basil and pickles. In addition, you can choose from over 30 different ""fixins"" to top off your bloody. The choices are endless! I tried the pickle infused vodka which was sweet, tangy and very smooth. It might have been one of the best I've ever had. Now this is Vegas, so If you're for something even more intense, the P.U.B. also has signature bloodys. This includes the most mammoth of all, the ""All About Mary,"" which is composed of a slider, crispy chicken wing, chilled shrimp, corn dog pop, stuffed olives, celery, carrot and pickled asparagus. I saw one being served and it was both breakfast and lunch all in itself. While $15-20 (depending on your choice) for a bloody mary sounds steep, the true decadence of these are definitely worth it. Now I wouldn't want to get one anywhere else on the strip. 

The food is pretty solid as well. I usually get a 1/2 order from the carvery and still split it with my husband. The abundance of meat they pile on is staggering. And it's thick cut. They give you a choice of two different sauces and have a great bread selection. If you're just looking for an appetizer, the toasted soft pretzels with ""wit wiz"" is a tasty choice. The pretzel sticks are fresh, soft and buttery while the cheese provides a hint of tang. And then there's the beer selection. I come from San Diego, the craft beer capital of the US, and I can say It's definitely impressive. They have a little something for everyone and feature breweries from across the country. While the prices are a bit steep, they have a happy hour from 3-6 and 10 to late. There's also one way to get it free-- At the bar there are hourglasses that they can flip. If you can chug the entire thing in that amount of time, you don't pay for it.

3293965,2011-01-10,1,dn_ipqbm7_jUz5X3rDez_A,"I really enjoyed my experience at PUB. The atmosphere, the service, the drinks, and the food were all great. Here's the breakdown.

ATMOSPHERE - Very high ceilings and plenty of windows in the front. The bar is really gorgeous, with floor to ceiling bottles. The chairs, in bright red leather, were very comfy. 

SERVICE - Bright and friendly. Age-wise, it's a young group of servers, which is always a mixed bag, but everyone here was friendly and smiling and knowledgeable. Our server was really attentive.

DRINKS - An overall fantastic list of draught beers from all over the world, and though the prices are a bit steep, the list is high quality. Our water glasses were kept full. 

FOOD - Be forewarned. The portions (ALL the portions) are huge. We began our meal with an appetizer of Dirty Chips, which, going with the PUB theme, should have probably been called Dirty Crisps, because they were not fries, but chips, and chips are fries in... wait. Guh. I lost it. No matter. they were VERY crunchy and delicious, covered in some sort of green aioli and garnished ever-so-lightly with Fried Chicken Livers. I'm not a huge fan of liver, but wow, these things had me losing my mind a little bit. 

The Lobster Bisque was exquisite. Not too creamy, but plenty rich, topped with a flaky puff pastry. 

The main courses were all superb. The Chicken Pot Pie was creamy and and filled with huge chunks of chicken and topped with that gorgeous and impossibly light puff pastry. The Brown Butter Lobster Rolls were as good as they sound, and there was no skimping on the lobster. Shepherd's Pie was gravy-licious, and the large fellow who ordered it could barely finish half, try as he might. I ordered an open-faced Lamb Carvery sandwich with Horseradish Sauce and Pineapple Mint Sauce. The Pineapple sauce was non-descript, but the Horseradish knocked my socks off. I am used to things not being spicy or strong enough, but as I wiped away the tears as the last wallop of horseradish pulsed through my sinuses, I knew I had found a place that understands me. I was significantly more judicious with the sauce after that. The lamb was cooked perfectly.

We didn't get a chance to try the desserts, much as we wanted to. No one had any room left.

The place itself looks great, big open restaurant with alot of beers on tap, great vibe and the service was on point. I remember PUB used to be popular for nickel beers but they discontinued it as the place probably became a mad house. 

I describe their menu as high-end bar food with a British twist. The beer tap selection is what definitely makes it worth coming in along with a decent happy hour. My cousin ordered from their carved meat menu which comes with a couple slices of a selected meat, some bread and a choice of side. The turkey he ordered was pretty dry and I thought the portions were surprisingly small. For the $20 they charged him I thought he would have been better off ordering a regular dish. I saw some of the other diners order from the carved meat menu and their food looked equally mediocre.

I got the chicken parm sliders and had no qualms. Nice fluffy bread, perfect amount of sauce and cheese and chicken was great. . The bread pudding for desert was pretty meh.. I forgot to realize that it came packed with raisins which I can't stand but thats my fault for not anticipating it. The whole thing seemed to be soaked with rum which kinda gave it an odd flavor However! It's totally Todd English's fault for giving such a tiny scoop of ice cream along with a large serving of the bread pudding. I guess its a pet peeve of mine when restaurants don't serve certain dishes in proper proportions, this 1 clearly needed to be in a 1:1 ratio, but the captain crunch cereal pieces were pretty cool.

Ultimately the food is good but not great. PUB is great for the brews and a snack but their are more worthy places in City Center for dinner.",ALw8EN21lby0vWtfD6JfIw,2,1,3,D_OnitYBjZZbCKxP1oj3zw

As many others have mentioned, the 7 Second Challenge involves chugging any beer (up to two per day) within 7 seconds to win the beer for free.",kHGRDaZt4nHgNSJcjOTDeQ,0,0,3,w4oeCRIcWET4Xn5b1LhMpQ

As soon as we sat down (nice atmosphere, by the way), the waitress breathlessly told us that they had 38 (38!) beers on tap.  Only... they only had one of seven seasonal beers.  O-kaaaayyyyy...  so I guess that means they have 32 beers

How about...?  Nope.  The next half dozen choices we came up with, they didn't have.  So in actuality they had AT THE MOST 26 beers.  Our problem was that the rest of the beers we could choose from we had already had (or they were IPAs, and that's a beer designed by people who hate beer), and we wanted to try something new.  The waitress was very apologetic, and we finally found one we could live with. 

We only ordered an appetizer, the dirty chips.  Tasty, and even if you think you don't like chicken livers, don't worry -- they're fried and don't taste much like liver, and there's only four pieces around the side, so you don't even have to eat them if you don't want to.

At some point someone whom I assume was the manager came over to apologize for the lack of beers (I THINK he said something about changing the beers and menu hadn't changed yet???) -- but he also did something that turned this from a slam review to a ""you know, I'd go there again, and tell people to try it out.""  He comped the beers we had, and asked if we would like to try something else.  We thanked him and told him there wasn't anything else we wanted to taste.  But he came up with a Belgian that sounded good -- but instead of the little tastes we thought he'd bring over, he came with two full sized glasses (it was a tasty beer, too!), which were also comped.

Things go wrong sometimes, but how you handle it makes all the difference.  This was deft handling!

I say try the place out.  It's a great place for a little bit of food, some good beer, and great vibe.",bDP-6W4J-LvPRY2UXoej6w,0,0,3,bQTTcdQrQBsPH5medVVFLA

The shrimp cocktail was the fanciest I've ever had.  Sliced in half and pre mixed in sauce for me.  There were mandarin slices as well as some while and green sauce.  Sooooo refreshing and bomb.

Guinness- You can never go wrong with this stout on tap
Pyramid Audacious Apricot Ale- I'm usually not one for fruity beers but this is an exception. Amazing Ale with a burst of Apricot and hints of lemon and wheat.
Delirium Tremens, Belgium- This hoppy beer that sits at a 8.5% alcohol content is amazing. crisp yet yeasty you will love this beer. But be careful, its strong :)

Now for the food...

You can never go wrong with starting out with the Beer Battered Onion Rings. they come with this spicy ranch dipping sauce that truly makes the dish.
Ive always wanted to try the dirty chips too. kettle chips with bacon bits scallions and chicken livers... ill def try that next time!
I had the West Coast Burger for my entree. Its a turkey burger, with sunflower sprouts, bacon, slaw, avocado and dressed with honey mustard. It also came with huge fries. So yum!

Kind of nerve racking because they are banging on pots and pans while you are drinking, along with the pressure of the 7 second hour glass.

To update this review, they are no longer accepting guiness for the challenge.  You must choose a 9 dollar beer that's off of their menu.  I recommend the Irish cream.  It's the easiest of the allowed choices.

But anywayz, on to the food, I had the bison burger (medium) and my girlfriend had the roast beef sandwich on an english muffin served with fries with your choice of two dipping sauces (she chose the truffle mayo and bbq sauce).

You get to choose the  type  of alcohol, the type of tomato juice and then you toppings (3, 5, or 7 depending on what type of build your own you order). They have a wide variety of toppings (green olives, black olives, stuffed green olives, celery, carrot sticks, peppercinis, green beans, pickles, bacon, shrimp, a slider, etc) their food is also tasty. Since I was having a fully loaded Bloody Mary I decided to just get a bowl of clam chowder, which was very yummy and creamy. Some of my friend got the bangers and mash, the shepherds pie, the fried pickles, etc and they all thought the food was also very tasty. They also have a fun challenge here if you like chugging beer. It's called the 7 sec challenge. You choose a beer  under $10 and if you can chug the beer under 7 sec that beer you drank is free. Some of my friends did this challenge and thought it was great.

The whole time the young hostess clearly is frustrated with her day and giving us attitude the while time. We tell her we will walk to the bar and find seats.

She says Boddingtons is the best. I refuse telling her I want PBR. She walks away again and returns in 5 minutes.

The Good:
The food was quite tasty, well prepared, and the commentary from our guests was that they enjoyed everything. The servers that worked with us for the night were on top of things and we appreciated their attention to detail (for example, running around for ""last call"" orders). 

The Bad:
We were booked in an area that was lined with booths. We booked for 37+ and she put out 27 chairs. Apparently, the booths were not attributed to our group. Why, I can't say. This was, after all, a private party. 

When the food came out, our people took up two out of four booths to eat and this was not well received. In fact, the Coordinator asked them to move. To stand and eat elsewhere (while she had some people bring out extra chairs) We were paying about $90/head, so I think it's fair to say that having our people sit in those booths was not causing them any lost revenue. But she was adamant that ""this was not part of our package."" When we did move, the tables weren't even filled up. They sat there. Empty.

She was on it when it came to working and serving guests so I would give her 5 stars but unfortunatly she works at Todd English's PUB.  
I went here because I was craving fish and chips and even though I knew the food was not so good I figured they had to get fish and chips right because it's an english PUB.  I was wrong.  It was so terrible and since Chrystal was a very good bartender, I shut my mouth sucked it up (later yack it up) and ate what edible parts I could of my flavorless fish and cold over cooked hard chips, that cost $20!  There was a couple next to us at the bar that ordered the DIRTY NACHOS (which looked disgusting) and after a bite or two they returned them.

If you haven't been to this enjoyable little spot right outside of Crystals you must try it!!

We were greeted by a host and a manager before grabbing a seat at the bar. A bartender came right over offering us menus, ice water and information about their expansive beer list!

Their decor is old school English pub with great lighting fixtures, funky pieces of art decor and an old school feel by allowing you to drop your peanut shells on the floor. 

Another bartender checked on us a few minutes later to put in our order. We took all his suggestions and I'm so glad we did!! 

We ordered the house made Bologna sandwich, the lobster rolls and the fried pickles. I also ordered a Bloody Mary and my partner got a Delirium Tremens and also took the 7 second beer challenge. 

The Bologna sandwich was one of the BEST things I've ever eaten! Who knew something so nostalgic could be so delectable! This sandwich is filled with gooey mozzarella cheese, a tangy mustard sauce, layers of thinly sliced smokey salty house made Bologna and served on perfect toasted Texas toast. Yum!! It's served in a bag and comes with house made potato chips and a chocolate chip cookie. Just like mom used to make you for school... But 100% better. Order this sandwich and enjoy every single bite because you'll be sad when lunch comes to an end.

The lobster rolls couldn't look or taste any better. I've never had such large pieces of lobster served in my roll before. Smaller versions of their adult counter part these little gems are full of sweet lobster tossed in brown butter with a warm aioli and served on a buttered roll along side house made coleslaw and chips. Perfection! 

The fried pickles were my least favorite only because I'm so used to the usual dill pickle chip. These were more of a butter pickle and sweeter than my liking. The sauces were enticing, three of them including a bbq, spicy ranch and my personal favorite the blue cheese fondue. If you like your fried pickles a little on the sweet side these would be a good choice! 

Our bartenders were so helpful, wonderful servers. They were friendly and their recommendations were spot on. These reasons made our meal, and first time experience at Todds English P.U.B.much more enjoyable! We will return!",_8y-kAoK4BQ_MmzawRpQFw,5,5,5,xc9_3GifoAdEvX3C5DghTg

My mother & I were at Aria browsing around & decided to get a snack. Out of all of the restaurants we chose this one because we love pubs & pub food. The vibe & decor inside is inviting enough but our experience was not too great.

Our waitress is what made the experience the worst although I will say the food wasn't thatttt great either. She was one of those waitresses who is uncomfortable around Asian people & would hardly look us in the eyes. My mom got zero eye contact what so ever. Her discomfort made us uncomfortable & it's always a shame to see a waitress who is being chummy & normal with every other table but your own all because of the thing that no one , even I don't want to say. Prejudiced. 

Onward to food. We ordered the lobster rolls to share, a Guinness float, & some kind of local beer that I don't remember the name of.They serve complimentary popcorn which is nice until we tried it. Tasted old & a bit stale.The Guinness float was literally just half ice cream half beer, I expected something different especially for $13. My mother ordered a local beer that the waitress did not pour, she literally slammed the can & cup on the table & ran off. Big brands that serve overpriced can beer? A bit tacky. The lobster rolls were the only good thing. They were nice & toasted with buttery flavor & the lobster was delicious. It's unfortunate that they are served with stale potato chips & not real french fries, which will of course cost you more. $25 per plate with stale chips. Hmm...

Finally when we got the check our waitress at least said have a nice day only she said it while she already had her back turned to us... lol is all I can say to that. I'm going to pass on coming back here.",rx6TW2QmrfImGX0dvLyPQg,1,1,1,zes2efkVassBjR_sSVQacA

Also had the mushroom sope, which was tasty, but not on the same level as that lobster roll business.

The grown up grilled cheese is delicious, but you MUST have a taste for brie.  This last visit i had the brisket from the carvery where you choose your meat, type of bread, and 2 specialty spreads to make a sandwich.  The meat is sold by 1/2 or full pound.  The brisket was terrific on marbled rye with horseradish sour cream and black truffle mayo.  Their skinny fries are really tasty.  
Dad had the chicken pot pie, which was rich and creamy.  Mom had the sliders that come in 3.  Sister had a salad (can't remember the name) it had lettuce, tomato, cucumber, and topped with kettle chips.  It was different, but really tasty.
There are a number of beers on tap and they even make specialty beer cocktails.  
On our way out, we use the ""gumball machine"" to purchase a beer pong ball with the Pub's name on it.  FUN!

You already have Friday and Saturday night reservations on the books, and you're planning to splurge on those.  You're not sure you really *need* a third $300 meal for the weekend, and you were apprehensive about having to rush to make it to a Thursday reservation before the restaurant closed-- even if your flight was going to be on time... 

... of course, your flight was delayed, though a small part of you is now secretly smug about having not booked your reservation.  You're staying at Aria, you're tired, and at this point, you just want some normal food and a beer.  It's not excessively late, but a lot of the restaurants are now closed.  

Sound familiar?  Before you grumble your way to either room service, a 24 hour restaurant, or whatever quasi food meal substitute you can find within arm's reach, let Todd English P.U.B. be your salvation.  

Is it the best meal on the strip?  Of course not, it's not even in the discussion.  But, it has decent food, a good beer selection, relatively speaking (i.e. for the Strip) good prices, and it fills a much needed situational void as described above.  

It's one of my favorite ways to ease into the Vegas debauchery when flying in after work from across the country.  We can usually call ahead from the airport and get in without issue.",iz7jzlhnm-HYsP-r5MN_JQ,1,0,4,z81Z5bUPd4wTBhzhbtrfwg

British classics such as Bubble and squeak, bangers and mash, pot pies and expertly roasted until tender meats and poultry. 

Our waitress, Diane V., was friendly, effervescent, and attentive. Our water glasses were routinely filled and beer refills were offered. We're ""fans"" of Chef English's carvery so this time, it was no different than previous visits. Today, I ordered the 8 ounce portion of roasted beef brisket that was so tender that you didn't need a knife to cut it. It was seasoned well and you could taste its ""beefiness"", in a good way. At my urging, my husband ordered the lobster rolls. Oh boy, these lobster rolls were kicked up a version from those that you'd find at Bar Harbor, Maine! First of all, the rolls are brioche-dough based and secondly, the lobster claw meat is sautéed in browned butter, mixed with seasoned mayonnaise and STUFFED into the rolls. The lobster rolls were complemented with a bag of fresh house made potato chips.

The bartender told me they could still make it- so I ordered them...not the same, they didn't have chicken livers...which I don't particularly like, but quickly found out, their flavor is important to the dish as a whole. Then the bacon was missing and they had some other stuff in them that wasn't there in the original dish. My fault for trying to force it- so I'm sad to say, the OG Dirty Chips are no more and you shouldn't try to get them to make it. 

The location is perfect! easy to get to from both directions on the Strip.

I've eaten here probably 7 times and never been overly excited about any of the main dishes. They are all marginal to good- but nothing overly exciting. It's a shame. 

Great beer selection and a pretty good scotch selection as well. They have a half priced happy hour from 10-12, which is nice.

The food was so yummy!  I got the shepherds pie and the beef/pork ragu was probably one of the best shep pie fillings I've had.

During our most recent trip last week, I found out that Todd English P.U.B. was rated at a top 20 restaurant/ bar in the US. As an avid fan of Crystals in general, I decided to give it a try for my birthday dinner. Plus my dad was paying and I didn't want to run him dry right before retirement with a trip to Mastro's. We were able to make a reservation for 4, same day, for 7:45 pm. The hostess seated us promptly in a large, comfy booth. Instead of bread they immediately provide fresh popcorn (yum). Our server was very sweet and even hand-stuffed my husband's blue cheese olives for his dirty martini. I opted for a ginger beer cocktail and was not disappointed. It was served ice cold in a tin mug.

For a starter, we ordered 16 of the east coast oysters. They were served with fresh horseradish, mignonette and chili sauce. I've had quite a few oysters in my day and these were AMAZING. For entrees, my husband ordered the sliders (standard) and I chose the lobster cobb salad. The salad was loaded with lobster meat, but they forgot the dressing. It would defeinitely have added some flavor. My dad is Irish, so I convinced him to order the bangers and mash for his entree. Oh.. my.. lord. The onion gravy was divine!

The dressing was to die for, and the croutons were possibly the best I ever had, and I consider myself a hard to please Caesar salad connoisseur.  It was just enough portion wise.

Where do I start?
7 Second Beer -- can you drink a pint in about 7 seconds?  If so, and if you pick one $10 or less it's free  Up to two per day.  Go with Boddington's or another nitrogen-charged beer.  It goes down more smoothly.  But don't break the glass when you slam it down on the bar.  The bartenders will hate you and you'll bleed everywhere.  Apparently this actually happens.

Pastrami -- best pastrami I've ever had.  Ever.  Best pastrami ever.  It is sinfully juicy yet not visibly or tactile-y {is that a word?} fatty.  Great peppery bark and just the best thing ever on rye with the horseradish and mustard trio.  The pickles that are served with it {cauliflower, cucumbers and such} are also incredible.  Not too tangy or salty.  OMFG  An 8 ounce portion is enough to share and share you should; you want to save room to try other stuff.

Pastrami burger -- one of the top three burgers I've ever had  It looked I seriously {seriously} thought my pescatarian fiance would break down and take a bite.  It was a perfect rare/mediurm rare and beautifully red in the middle  The flavor was outstanding and while it was topped with goodies, the meat really stood up on its own.  The fries with black truffle aioli were also great but were totally overshadowed by the burger

Mussels -- best mussels I've ever had.  Inappropriately good.  Like pornographic.  You get a huge pile of large, perfectly cooked, perfectly tasty oysters.  Not remotely chewy.  And the sauce - oh, the sauce!!!  Ask for extra bread to soak up the brothy, tomatoey goodness  Holy mother of all things delicious.

Pretzel stick thingies with cheese sauce -- came out piping hot and great for absorbing those ill-advised shots after making friends with every bartender in the house  

Fish and chips -- the best fish and chips we have ever had.  Again - not kidding  The fish {cod?] was huge.  Like over a foot long.  And probably three inches thick.  And beautiful and flaky and fresh and flavorful.  Served with fantastic cole slaw {different from the cole slaw with the lobster rolls???}.  And fat fries  de-freakin-licious.

Lobster rolls -- the ""worst"" food item we tried.  Meaning it wasn't the best or among the best of that item we had ever tasted.  Our only complaint was that it was too saucy.  Would have preferred to been able to taste more of the huge lobster pieces stuffed into the brioche style buns.  They came with great cole slaw.  Think KFC but way less mayonaissey and way fresher.

Beer -- a freaking fantastic beer selection.  One of the top three I can think of in terms of scope, quality and size.  Don't know what you're doing?  Ask for a recommendation from the bartenders.  They know their trade  Maybe try a cask ale.  Nom nom nom.  Interested in Coors Light?  Go kill yourself.  Or you'll be the guy down the bar who was literally laughed at by the bartender.

Happy hour -- whaaaaat?  They have two.  I think one is from 4-7 and the other is from 10 - ???  Half price drafts.  This means you can get outstanding beers are very reasonable prices  $1 wings, $2 oysters and $3 sliders.  The oysters are always $2, but whatever  The wings were fairly small but very tasty and served with a chunky blue cheese.  The oysters were also not huge, but of good quality and served with some of the hottest horseradish I have ever had.  And also with straight up seaweed, son.  Eat it.  The slider was a good size and high in quality.  Also not cooked to a crisp.  I dipped it in my leftover wing blue cheese.  Awww yeah.

Bartenders -- they are GREAT here.  Super friendly and super knowledgeable.  Tip them well because you will be going back and back and back if you know what's good for you.  Marielle {sp?}, Tom and Ashley primarily took care of us during our most recent visits.  They are just the best  

A few things to note:

There are dining tables with built in taps that keep track of how much you've poured, to the 1/10th pint.  Help yourself.  

There are bathroom attendants.  Probably the only thing I don't like about Todd's, but the attendants were friendly and not really annoying.

I will be very specific about the issues that I had during my lunch at Mr Todd English's ill attempt at a restaurant:

We arrived at the restaurant around 2:00pm for lunch. There was no host at the host stand; just a busser standing up front twirling a drink tray on his finger saying ""she's gunna be right back.""  The hostess known as ""she"" didn't return to the host stand for several minutes. We were eventually sat at a table when she arrived back at her post.

We were greeted quickly by our server, Samantha. She was plenty friendly. The issue that I had with her is that she was sitting at a table next to us doing nothing but showing pictures of who knows what to other servers while they neglected their tables, and she neglected hers. I had no refill on my soda.  She didn't check on us after food was received.  The manager did nothing but stand next to the heat lamps and lean the whole time that we were there.

The $19 hamburger that I received had no seasoning on it and the bun was very dry and stale...huge disappointment. 

Theb $20 sandwich my wife had was good, but really I could have had it for $7 at togo's. 

In conclusion:

Service: terrible.

Food: mediocre at best. 

I know that my words will fall on deaf ears, as far as Mr English is concerned, but hopefully the management will try to improve the staff so that people don't continue to leave as pissed off as I did.

There are other items that look great I still want to try, but the carved meat is their ""specialty"" which was a little disappointing.",pz1HWfUdT4JPwh7HiynyEA,0,0,3,A26rs4EJFdPTPbpgujSiOA

We sat at one of the high-tops and enjoyed ourselves. The hostess was very sweet with a warm smile. Our service welcomed us and brought us our drinks. I got a merlot and my boyfriend drank water. They give you a bucket of popcorn, which is so good! 

I must warn you: DO NOT EAT ALL THE POPCORN. You will get full. Although it is a light snack, you become susceptible to mindless eating. I would save your stomach for the other dishes!

We ordered two dishes: the foot-long Artisinal chili hot dog with a side of fries and the Lobster rolls. The hot dog was decent. The size is huge! I would recommend sharing it if you can. It was hard to eat since it was so big. The fries are thin crunchy fries. Their ranch their is quality buttery ranch so I would order a side of that. 

Now the lobster rolls. That is what made the experience so great. If I had to rate the lobster rolls by themselves I would give it a 5. The lobster was tender. The sauce was delicious. The buttered toast was the right amount of crunch. The cole slaw on the side is the best I ever had in Las Vegas. The chips were chips. There was nothing special with it. It comes with three rolls that are pretty filling. 

The place is decently priced. The ambiance is great. I would recommend getting reservations if you can especially on the weekends or on game nights. The attire is pretty casual. The servers are great and the place looks clean. It is a true pub. I also suggest walking around the Aria after you are done eating. It is a great way to let your food settle and see beautiful art.

Seeing that there were open chairs at the bar, I asked the woman if I could sit there instead and not take up one of their larger tables.  It was OK with her but it was a mistake on my part.

Not all the bartenders take orders it appeared and since there was an hour left in Happy Hour, they were quite busy.  My space was eventually cleared and I was brought a menu.  I also ordered an iced tea.  After deciding to get the fish and chips, I waited for several minutes before my bartender came back to take my order.

About 10 minutes later, a runner appeared behind me with my dinner.  The chips were very good and the slaw with green peas added had a good flavor.  The fish was not impressive at all.  It seemed as if they have perfected the farm raised fish for people who don't like fish--battered fish with no fish taste at all--something my wife would like because she doesn't like fish.  The tartar sauce was OK but there was too little of it.

When it came time for dessert, a different bartender stopped by but he said I had to wait to order and he cleared my area.  He asked if I was done with my drink--I wasn't--but he took the glass, dumped it out, and put it in their mini glass washers that was the most interesting thing of the night for me.  No one asked if I wanted a refill.  I wasn't drinking beer or cocktails so I was merely tasking up a seat at the bar that a drinker could have been.  I should have stayed at the four person booth.

Eventually, my bartender came back and I ordered the sticky toffee pudding.  Again, a 10 minute wait and a runner was behind me with it.  Not stickiness to the toffee and pudding with little flavor.  There are so many good toffee puddings in the area I should have just skipped dessert.

By flash I mean it is a loud and party atmosphere.  Lots of beautiful people from nearby Aria, low cut dresses and stilleto heels.  Unfortunately I was sitting with my back to the bar area so I didn't get to enjoy the views.

I did, however, get the chance to try their curry moules et frites and the sweet potato fries.  The mussels smelled great with a heavy curry scent wafting up from the small cast iron pot.  There were about 20-30 small mussels in a curried stock drizzled with mayonaise and parsley.  I am not sure why they put maynaise on it, since it did not add to the flavor or richness of the broth.  They might have been trying to be European, but then why the curry flavor?  Anyway, the real let down with the dish was that no bread came with it.  Our waitress was nice enough to bring me a few slices of sourdough, but you think it would have been included with the dish.  The fries were thin cut fries that were a little dry and not thick enough to soak up the soup inside the pot.  The sweet potato fries looked and smelled promising, but they were just too salty.  If you got one that didn't have any salt on it, then they were great.

So its Pub food, and apparently when you put the name Todd English in front of it that means the price is x2 of the norm. A $20 hamburger that although the novelty of it trying to look over-sized with the heavy stack of vegetables doesn't help the lack of seasoning in the meat. The fries that came with it were meh. And the shepherd's pie was decent and much better than the burger, but at $22 i would have much preferred quite a few different options that were not more than a few steps away in Crystals or Aria. After 2 glasses of house wine, dinner for 2 was $100 with tip. Not even a meal i would put in my ""decent"" list of places that i have eaten. I wouldn't return even if my bill was half what it was.

We sat at the bar and scored seats right by the Spurs vs Mavericks game which was a huge plus. They have an amazing beer selection and so many tasty foods to choose from. We went with the Duck Buns and the Lobster Poppie. Both were excellent. The Duck Buns were like 3 little steamed buns you would get at dim sum. It's shredded duck, hoisin sauce and chopped scallions. Great balance of flavor and the actual bun was nice and fluffy. The Lobster Poppie was yorkshire pudding, creamy corn and brown butter sauce. It was a huge pastry pop over with lobster and all the other creamy goodness. Both were great and went well with beer. 

Our bartender that served was great. He was nice and checked on us frequently. Along the bar there are hour glasses on stands. The thing with those is that if you order a beer and you finish before the sand runs out (seven seconds) you get it for free.

Service was not good however. It's just not something you should have to deal with in a Strip property restaurant. I've been here before and it was when they first opened years ago. Service was also not good then, and I said it would be some time - if ever I returned. Forward nearly 3 years later and this time I stuck to ordering things like fish and chips and a Reuben - so it'd be hard to mess those things up. (Pics below)

Breaking it down further - myself and my buddy walked into 3 hostesses that were not even facing the doorway where guests walk in. One turned around and greeted us. The other two continued to face the opposite direction and seemed to be pretending to organize the menus? Seems like as the first people you see - you would like to be greeted properly by the host staff.

We were asked if we wanted to sit outside - which we did as it was a nice day - and that also became an issue. 10 minutes before someone with water came over - and quickly hurried himself away. This was even after a server delivered a couple of drinks to the table directly next to us. The server looked in our direction but without any acknowledgement ... What's going on?? Lol 

It became pretty funny at that point. Weary and hungry, we just wanted to eat. When the actual server finally came out - it was right around 15 minutes. 

""Do you guys want something to drink? Or are you ready to order?"" 

We did both right then, seeing this as our big chance :) 

The rest of the meal was pretty uneventful as the server was a bit more attentive than ever before for some reason. He proceeded to tell us how it was a job that he likes because it's casual and makes him good money. 

""Oh cool,"" I said .. lol .. ""We will take the bill when you get a minute."" Which he returned with promptly. 

So overall it's as so many have mentioned - food is good enough, a little pricey for what it is - although well executed. Wouldn't take much to make it just right and a ""5 star"" location.

My lobster rolls (heaven on a roll) also came with homemade slaw and kettle chips.  It goes without saying that the food was delicious and beautiful.

Second dinner was a kobe beef hot dog with a chocolate strawberry beer (chocolate stout and strawberry lambic mixed together) while my friend had cheese fries and corn dog fritters.  SO good.

In short: amazing food and extensive draft beer menu at a better value than anywhere in the Aria and I imagine elsewhere on the Strip. 

Our first meal was a Sunday brunch.  At 10am in late September, it was just cool enough to enjoy our meal outside, watching an NFL game on a big screen they had wheeled out.  After much deliberation and consultation with the server, I had a salad and the lobster rolls - best meal of my whole trip.  Just amazing.  Order them, several times if you can.  They were offering an impressive Bloody Mary menu... not our thing but I'm sure many others would love to add smoked gouda or bacon or beef broth to their Maries.  We instead ordered fancy $11 seasonal fest draft beers - a deceptively great deal considering the $8 Bud Lights everywhere else on the Strip.  

Second meal: dinner.  After demolishing the toasted pretzel appetizer, I couldn't finish the second half of my grilled cheese panini with brie and bacon.  I do consider myself a connoisseur of both soft pretzels and brie sandwiches - I can't emphasize enough how good these were. 

Third ""meal"": late afternoon happy hour.  TE PUB offers a decent Happy Hour for Vegas standards (somewhat decent for DC standards): 3-6pm and 10pm-??, half-price draft beer, $1 wings, $2 oysters, $3 sliders.  I hated the Woodchuck Pumpkin Reserve I ordered (who can drink that nonsense?), and my awesome waitress replaced it no charge.  Three of us shared some wings - perfectly tender and seasoned - but in retrospect I regret not getting the soft pretzels again.

Came here for lunch with a friend and I loved the fresh oysters and crab claws sitting on ice, the baseball games displayed on the TVs, and the smell of roasting meats in the air.  I knew I was in the right place.

Started with a dozen fresh oysters.  Half of them were from the East coast and the other half from the West Coast.  They were very fresh and mild.   We also ordered the Dirty Chips ($14), but not by choice.  I tried to order something else and they had already discontinued it from the menu.  Boo.  The Dirty Chips were pretty good, but they were just too much food for my friend and I to eat.  They are homemade kettle chips covered in bleu cheese, bacon bits, scallions and fried chicken livers.  Ugh.   My arteries took a serious hit after eating some of these, but they were damn good.  

For our entrees, he ordered the Organic Chicken Pot Pie ($18) - chicken, potatoes, carrots topped with a puff pastry crust.  It was huge!  I ordered from their ""meat"" menu.  They have a menu where you choose the meat and they carve it out for you and you get your choice of bread and condiments to make yourself a sandwich.  I ordered the Prime Rib, which came out shaved and oh so deliciously moist and rare.  I ordered it with the sourdough bread and creamy horseradish sour cream and mayo with truffles.  Sooooo good!

Service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is Vegas and located inside the Crystals shopping mall by Aria.  If you need to take a break from all the gambling and partying and just get a nice, hearty, ""man"" meal - come to Public Urban Bar.

Pros: good comfort food, huge portions, reasonable prices, laid back atmosphere

We arrive, and it's kind of loud in there, music was on blast. It's a nice place to maybe, drink but the food was crap. We waited about 10 mins before our waitress came over to greeted us, take our drink orders and then 10 mins after that, she returns only to tell us that we have only about 10 mins before the kitchen closes... WTF, why didn't you tell us that when you first approached us?! SO, since we were short on time, we asked her ""What do you recommend?"" and ordered whatever she spit out, BIGGEST MISTAKE-- EVER!!! But that's our fault for listening to her, no it's our fault for even coming here. Of course this chick wants a high tip-out so she of course recommends, the Lobster Rolls, a whopping $25. OK, so it's lobster and we're expecting quality for that price, hey, it's City Center, an MGM property, only good shit, right? WRONG. First of all, they are SMALL and consists of mostly bread. They used CLAW MEAT, the tail of the lobster is normally used for Lobster Rolls! That's the worst part to use, AND it was overcooked and chewy, WTH. They're more like shitty SLIDERS than an actual Lobster Roll. It also came with stale chips and some mushy cole slaw, YUUUUUUUCK. Worst $25 spent. 

The next thing on our menu was the chili. We like to try the chili when ever we go to a new restaurant. It was good for the first couple bites but after that, it became saltier with every spoonful. We were over the taste but we were hungry so we ate it anyway. My brother & his gf had a sandwich and sliders, both were disappointed in their selections, and again, recommended by the server. 

We were still hungry when we left this place, it's ridiculous considering the final cost of our bill! The bill was $70 between 4 people and I was the ONLY one that had beer, everyone else had water... Damn, it's a Pub, they're trying to be some kind of ""High End"" Pub? That's an oxymoron.

Little did we know that they are also doing a ""Twelve Beers of Christmas,"" with a new draft every day until Christmas for $2.00. So amazing! We scored Winter Lager (Sam Adams) for ridiculously cheap... you just don't find that on the strip.

We ordered twelve oysters from the raw bar to start and they did not disappoint. Fresh horseradish, cocktail sauce, lemon wedges, and another sauce which was Asian-inspired accompanied them. Super fresh, salty, and a decent size made this Carolina girl (read: oyster snob) a fan. I also ordered a wedge salad and was really impressed by it. Bacon vinaigrette, bacon pieces, fresh tomatoes and avocado, chopped egg, and blue cheese equals serious wedge perfection. I ate the entire thing. My boyfriend had the grilled bologna and thought the sandwich was great. The only downside was that it said it was served with kettle chips but they were no where to be found. Service was attentive at the bar but also a little sporadic, so he chose to just let that slip up go and not ask about them.

Inside, there is an enormous bar surrounding a huge wall of alcohol, with drinks, food and other specials listed on blackboards.

The place has 70 different types of beer on hand from various regions, including Belgium and the United States, along with Trappist beer made by monks. 

While there are other locations in Vegas that offer 100, any beer aficionado will find something they like. However, the star of the show in my opinion is the TE Bloody Mary. It's probably the best BM I've had in a long time, with a generous amount of spice and kick to really get the senses going. It comes with a variety of accouterments, including pickled carrots, green beans, olives and cheddar cheese. This drink is a nice beverage and meal rolled into one. I would recommend this to anyone stopping by here, it's that good!

The food on the other hand is hit or miss. While they claim to have a raw bar, I felt it really missed the mark, with the oysters improperly shucked and not very fresh. It was the biggest disappointment as I am a huge fan and was hoping to have something close to satisfy that craving. 

I also ordered their hot dog, which was okay. Look wise, it's a beast, at a whopping  foot long (possibly bigger) and more than enough for two people. The dog was split a third of the way down to fill it with cheddar cheese which was a nice touch. The brioche bun also took this American staple to a higher level but that's where it really ends. While the bun was nice and soft, the meat to bread ratio was grossly off, opting for big and large presentations over taste. The sausage also didn't have the kind of snap I was looking for. It may have been different with the chili and onion option but I don't think another $5 addition to an already expensive meal ($20) was worth it. 

Not bad by any means but definitely not great. 

The hour glass at the bar however, is super interesting, especially if you are coming with friends. The 7 second hour glass challenge allows daredevils to down a beer before the sand runs out. Those that are successful get their beer for free and you can do this twice a day. Pretty sweet for those looking for a raucous good time. 

Overall, an okay spot but nothing I haven't seen or experienced elsewhere.",RL--kEWrbnjUhnS5wWqXTQ,0,0,3,9h1s3nDfjbN7JumeQ57lGA
4364462,2014-11-08,0,dn_ipqbm7_jUz5X3rDez_A,"My husband and I had a late afternoon lunch here after spending the day riding the Ferris Wheel and gambling in Vegas, and it was good, but could have been a bit better for the cost.

We were staying at the Aria, so it was an obvious lunch choice as something different from the Aria Cafe or the Aria buffet.  We were seated quickly by a friendly hostess, and greeted by a polite server, who oddly, disappeared in the middle of our meal and was replaced with a nice waitress.  It must have been a shift change since were there during the middle of the day, but the swap was never explained to us, which seemed a bit odd.

The drinks were good.  I had a Moscow Mule while my husband had a craft beer.  Both were served cold and within 5 minutes of being seated.  My husband had a burger while I had a light shrimp cocktail.  My husband really enjoyed his burger, but the fries were the star of the meal.  They were definitely plentiful, and enough to share between the two of us.  So delicious!  The shrimp cocktail was okay, it didn't taste as fresh as others I have had in Vegas, and for the $24 price tag, it definitely was on the very steep end considering the portion size and overall quality.  

We would consider going here again, but I will definitely try another chilled seafood item from the raw menu - which was pretty impressive for a pub specializing in hearty fare.  Cheers!",90sTc0TQ7F1Uj5NGiIE30Q,1,0,3,sajA1wkQ4kFqhPQBZKGtgw

Everyone really enjoyed it as usual.  So when we returned on June 14 -17 we knew we had to plan on which day we would return.  So we decided Sunday so we could enjoy the bloody Mary bar.  My husband went for the ultimate and I just selected my own toppings from the menu.  We might downsize our Bloody Mary toppings next time so we can enjoy more food from the actual menu!!
My husband had the Cioppino, which he as been craving since he last had it in January.   It was everything he remembered.  I had the lobster Cobb salad.  It had a lot of lobster.  I really liked it.   
So for our last day we were trying to decide what to do for lunch.  Should we try Bobby Flay's burger palace? ?    Nahhh, we can get burgers at home.  We came back to the P.U.B.   
They didn't have Miller Lite which I normally drink so I saw a cider ale on the menu.  I asked about that and then the server recommended a Pineapple Cider ale.  It was soooo good.  now I'll have to see if I can find it anywhere.  
We split 3 appetizers for our lunch.   The shrimp cocktail whichh as a nice cocktail sauce, The crispy pickles with 3 dipping sauces and the Mussels.    All three were very good and plenty for us to share as a lunch.   My husband wasn't sure about the mussels.  He's been converted.  He loved them.

Really bad service.

I saw a review for this place with photos of delicious looking food and had to try it out. The atmosphere was great - casual, clean and was comfortable enough that I didn't feel like I had to shout across the table to carry on a conversation.

Once we got our order (it came out wrong....twice), everything was delicious. Our server on the other hand was totally rude. She stormed off when we pointed out the order was wrong and left the manager to serve our food.  It took them forever to check in on us to see if we needed anything. A steady flow of drinks would have helped during this experience. 

Honestly, I was ready to leave at the beginning of the meal, but it was getting late and we were starving. At least the food was great.

I also didn't want to force my party into dining at a fixed menu joint and/or spending an arm and a leg for a crappy meal. So I found the PUB, and wasn't disappointed.

I was a bit disconcerted by the either really high or really low reviews on yelp, so I had no idea what to expect coming in.  Starting out though, the decor was interesting with a mix of high celining and tile floor brasserie and modern english pub styles.

When we arrived we were promptily seated despite not having everyone in our group there.  We ordered a few drinks to keep us occupied as we perused the interesting menu.  Unfortunately our waiter wasn't quite as attentive as I would've liked, but I may blame that on some of our group showing up late and maybe he was thinking we'd wait for them. Over the night, we did also wait a little longer than usual for drink orders. I had a nice little find in Newcastle's Werewolf though.

Foodwise, I was severely disappointed no one at our table wanted the dirty chips. I knew I stood no chance against them alone, so I directed my efforts elsewhere. Oh well... the wife decided to get the ahi poke on wonton chips, which the tuna was nice and fresh but it lacked in seasoning and the wontons were kind of greasy and stale.  I also had a taste of someone's pretzel and wit whiz (I would imagine that means it is supposed to have some witbeer in it). The pretzel had a nice chew, but the whiz was pretty bland.  

Fortunately I ordered the pastrami along with the truffle mayo and blue cheese fondue.  The pastrami alone would've given this place at least a 4.  It is super juicy and tender, not too salty, and just a hint of smoke and spice.  The truffle mayo isn't mind blowingly good, but its pretty tasty.  The blue cheese fondue was easily forgotten in favor of the mayo.  The two slices of thick cut rye were just about right for making 2 open face sandwiches with just enough extra pastrami to nibble on its own.  Despite the make it yourself method, at $16 this is a pretty good deal considering the quantity and quality.  The wife had the BLT sliders, but with my full plate I unfortunately didn't have the desire to try them.

After we finished up eating we met up with an even larger group of our friends and the beer chugging, shots, and beer pong commenced.  Overall, a pretty good place to start out a night with some tasty, filling food and some drinks that still leaves you some money for the craps table.",d309V6R6bzFto279DMh5cA,0,0,3,y9yaHBrezKSgmUqMrhQz3A

Went for lunch and the place was not packed at all. Despite seeing several servers walking around, waited a good 10 minutes for a water and a menu. The following was ordered: buffalo burger medium, substitue horseradish sauce instead of bleu cheese, and sweet potato fries. 35 minutes later (place is almost empty) food arrives by a different server who puts it down without saying anything and walks away. Food consists of a small patty of well done meat on a very large, somewhat burned bun. I am not sure of there burger weight, but putting it on a bun twice the size does not help with any sort of illusion. Large hunk of bleu cheese, but no horseradish anywhere to be found. No one is around and I am starving so I scrape off the cheese and just eat it. Anyone who has had buffalo understands it has a different flavor than beef.

I felt like it was mostly crust with not a lot of chicken.  I did get a Strawberry Ale, which didn't taste like alcohol at all!  It was like a mild bubbly Strawberry juice - liked it a lot.  We also got free popcorn upon being seated at our table.  Service was spotty as our server was difficult to flag down at times.  Overall, not a memorable place to eat and pricey (but our meal was comped, so I guess I can't complain)!",JA4Rw3qdKuGDCFbexnbN5w,0,0,3,bLdCrlgcAzLYEpxzHFJonQ

I've frequented this establishment many times before and always enjoyed being able to watch football. When I came in last night, there were 2 TV's, one with the game on and the other with the news on. I requested that the other TV be turned to a football game, apparently the manager on duty had a stick up his ass. I'm not sure if he doesn't get laid enough or if he's mad that he only makes 36k a year. Maybe he's upset that he had to work on a Saturday night rather than spending his night at home with his cat. Instead of accommodating the simple request of a patron, he opted to have both TV's turned off, so that nobody could enjoy any of the games. Upon a second request, it was explained to me that he did not want the TV's on. As somebody working in a hospitality industry, maybe he should familiarize himself with the definition of hospitality.

On both occasions hubby and I ordered the pickled vegetables which are really delicious though with their strong flavor they can be a bit much. I recommend ordering them with a group. Last time we got something from ""the carvery"" which is also a good option for sharing. Our last visit we were there too late for a big meal so we just stuck to appetizers and drinks. In addition to the pickles we got some wings and the corn dog bites. Both were pretty tasty.

Of course being a pub most people come to Todd English's to drink and that is where they really shine. Their list of craft beers is stellar. I really like the fact that they have a description of each one on the menu. That makes me more confident to try new ones. However, that also seems to be a crutch for the staff since our server was not familiar with them at all. We actually had to point at the ones we wanted while he wrote them down. Other than that he was pretty good but not overly friendly. We were there during March madness so there was a lively crowd clustered around the tv but the rest of the place was pretty mellow. I think this would be a good option for some late night drinks since they have a reverse happy hour from 10pm to midnight (yes, that is late for me) and a lot of bars and even restaurants on the strip get way too clubby for my taste at that hour.

Overall this place is a Vegas style (i.e. cheesy knockoff but still cool in its own way) approximation of a British pub and even though the food does not impress, it is decent.

Like I said, we had a group of 30, which can be daunting. The birthday girl (who had made a reservation here months in advance) had called in shortly before we were coming and ordered several appetizers which were waiting for us when we arrived. There were two long tables that were next to each other where we were seated, and each table had onion rings (which were delicious!), ""dirty nachos"" (think nachos w/potato chips instead of tortilla chips), which were also delicious, and honestly I can't remember the third appetizer. I'm not sure if they did something special for our group or not (hey I just showed up and ate what was ordered), but if these were the normal portion sizes for appetizers they're HUGE! 

Now this is where I say the service was awesome... 

Shortly after our entree orders were taken a small group of us had to get up and leave to take care of some of business for the birthday girl's big night (the Vegas club scene is a pain!). We expected to be gone a short time and by the time we'd get back our food would have just gotten there. Well, we were gone much longer than expected. Without any questions asked (nobody from our group said anything) our waitress (I'm assuming she got permission from the higher ups) said she would remake our food since we were gone so long. I kind of felt like an a-hole, but the restaurant was beyond nice for doing this for us. 

Oh, as far as what I ordered I got the West Coast Burger, which is essentially a Turkey burger w/bacon, sprouts & avocado. It was delicious and tasted very fresh. The fries that came w/it were delicious as well! Oh I also had a couple of pear vodka cocktails which were refreshing (a bit sweet...but refreshing)

After passing by it on several trips to Vegas, I was dying to give this place a try, but I never seemed to have enough time to fit in in to my stay. This past weekend, however, I made it a point to finally try it out and I was so extremely disappointed. I wanted to love it, I thought I was going to love it, but it was actually one of the worst dining experiences I've had in an incredibly long time.

We were seated right away at an outside table, which was nice. Our waiter immediately came over to take our drink order, which was also great, except we weren't ready to order. They have a pretty good beer selection so we needed another minute to think it over. That's when it all went down hill. Although he had seemed eager to get our order in when we first sat down, he then seemed to forget about us completely. We had long waits between waiter sightings, and often had to ask other waiters to find ours. He would halfheartedly apologize for a wait, but then disappear all over again, not to be seen until we found someone to track him down. It was crazy! There was a party of 6 sitting across from us, then a party of 4, then another party of 4... so 3 larger parties all came, ate, and left by the time we had gotten our food! We were just a party of 2...

The food was on the pricier side for what it was, so I was expecting high quality. I ordered the sliders, and was disappointed when I tried them. They weren't bad, they just weren't good. They weren't juicy or flavorful as I had been expecting. I had just recently had some amazing beef sliders in AZ (for half the price) and these didn't even come close. I would say the food was average, and not worth the price tag. The service was beyond terrible. We did more work than our waiter did, having to flag people down and ask them to find him repeatedly.

In my opinion, the appetizer Happy Hour specials are a bit misleading. A $1 for seven chicken wings will come up to $7. Not a bargain at all.

  In this fast-paced world that I live in, I partake in Happy Hour to be happy. Todd English P.U.B., features a major selection of beers to choose from to be happy. The categories include craft beers, fruity beers, the big boys, and so on. I usually get one to three beers. When I entered this thriving restaurant and pub located between Crystals and the Aria all uptight and exhausted from work, I make a beeline to the center bar. By the time I drink the pint of Fruli strawberry for example, I am becoming happy. After the pint of Arrogant Bastard Ale I am happy. And once I cash in my Yelp free check-in offer for a free Bud Light and drink it, I am OFF THE CHARTS HAPPY.

  The reality is that Todd English P.U.B., is an upbeat establishment that feeds off all the positive energy on the Las Vegas Strip. The majority of the patrons are tourists without a care in the world but to have a good time. After an Arrogant Bastard Ale and Bud Light, I kind of develop this tourist state of mind. I feel like I am part of a big party. Every so often in this party, the bar tender will ring a bell. This is to call attention to the fact that somebody is getting a complimentary drink for quaffing a beer down within seven seconds. Maybe one day after a stressed out shift I could write a review update on drinking a beer in less than seven seconds.

  Being in City Center, Todd English P.U.B.,fills up fast. This will cause some delay in the partaking of Happy Hour when all the bar stools are taken and the bar tenders are busy. 

  At Todd English P.U.B., it is more than the names of some of the beers that are weird. What is kind of weird, or just so out of the ordinary in Vegas is that men and women share the same sinks. If you are going on a date and plan to freshen up, I would advise another restroom. 

   Happy Hour is a tradition that I am so going to continue to partake in. And I am happy to say that when I am in City Center with the urge for a cold one or two between 3 and 6 PM, that the odds are in my favor of partaking in another Todd English P.U.B., Happy Hour.

Fresh fresh seafood  - as soon as you walk in, you see the shrimp and oysters on ice. Raw bar heaven.

Great beer selection; moderately priced and great service. Skinny and fat french fries; you have your choice; I like that!

Tuna = have it a lot of ways and each way is excellent. Our table had tuna three different ways: the burger, the ahi tuna on wontons, the tuna stack. Outstanding!

Very busy. This is a place where you can get in/out in an hour, catch a show, blow your money at the tables and then come back again in the morning for their killer Bloody Mary.

Great buzz, open kitchen, clean. Loved it. Easy to see how you could come here a couple times a day. Next time, maybe Todd will be there...or at his Olives inside Bellagio!",hyJusnslNlSLflrThs-54w,0,0,4,R7-Qgdb1LTPMIjeuz5NupQ

We had dinner here before heading out to see Peepshow.  Great choice, ladies!  I love the space and the feel of this place (Ooooooo that rhymed).  It had the vibe of a vintage contemporary pub with the sounds of eager sports fans gathering for a bite before the big game.  Um, there really wasn't a big game happening it just felt like that.
I had The Amsterdam burger which was okay.  The pastrami was not piled on and not really that special.  The fatty fries were okay, but I did enjoy the sweet potatoe fries instead.  i think my favorite was the Chocolate Dipped Strawberry cocktail which was a mix of 2 different beers - excellent.  I don't know much beyond the usual Bud Light's and Taj Mahal's, but this was worth it.  Not sure if my burger was worth $18 though.  That's all right.  it's all about spending time with good friends and okay food (wait is that even right?).
I'm one to give places another go just because there's so much on the menu that one dish would knock me off my feet.  I would hope.",yZJMu5juqpvH3dvylwUafw,0,0,3,Wi_Tw0Bhx45HoSFiwTX8DQ
4659795,2010-08-25,2,dn_ipqbm7_jUz5X3rDez_A,"Your first impressions when you walk into Todd English's P.U.B. in the new City Center are that your walking into a high class brothel.  There are three hostesses, all gorgeous and perfect 10s.  One is white.  One is black.  One is Asian.  They're wearing tight tops and very thin mini skirts.  ""Hoochie mama!""  Why?  I don't know.  My only guess is that it's Vegas baby.

Don't let this deter you from going a few more paces inside.  I know this is not your usual pub scene.  Hell, maybe it is.  It's definitely not my usual pub scene, but to tell you the truth, I kind of liked it.  In fact, after the entire meal was done and I walked out of the place, I wish every pub was like this one.

It's another Vegas celebrity chef monstrosity but without the stuffiness.  Use your cloth napkin and put it back on the table.  Who cares?  No one's going to frown upon you for bad etiquette.  It's a pub for crying out loud.  

Beyond the three gatekeepers there is a gumball machine filled with ping-pong balls used for beer pong.  Personally, I'd love to see beer pong played in a place like this.  I know it's casual, but I don't think it's that casual.

The beer selection is wonderful and delicious.  I tasted one of their cask selections and an Anchor Steam.  Then I had their chili and fish and chips.  For dessert, a strawberry shake. 
 
Is there something that I could say that was wrong with the food?  No.  Maybe ask for some more bread with the cauldron of chili.  

The waiter was definitely not lingering over us to leave within 30 minutes.  I feel the staff is trained for patrons to graze and relish over pub food done well.  It is on the pricier side for this kind of fair, but you have to think to yourself, ""It is Vegas and there is no pub anywhere else that features three perfect 10 women when you walk in.""

The only bitch I have with the P.U.B are the restrooms.  The good news: there are toilets actually inside the restaurant so you don't have to go outside and meander through a smoke-filled casino.  The bad news: there's a guy waiting for you to exit the stall to put soap in your hand and give you a paper towel.  What a crock of shit.  I know how to get soap and paper towels for myself buddy.  Don't patronize me with that bullshit.  It was one o' clock when I ate here.  There does not need to be a bathroom attendant waiting for me to be done with my business in the very early afternoon.  The excitement really went limp after I experienced that one.

Ordered a few beers, popcorn comes out in a lil tin can, just eh.  half isnt popped.  

Appetizer - I ordered the lobster poppie, and my friend ordered the duck buns.  each came with 2, so we just split them.  Both of these things were so weird and refreshing, they were great.  The bun on the duck bun was a lil much, but delicious.  and the lobster poppie aioli was addicting, i actually soaked up some with the duck bun.

Dinner - My friend ordered a fish special, i dont remember what it was, other then that it was very good.  and i got the brisket on challah bread with te bbq sauce and black truffle mayo.  the sauces were delicious, and challah was, being a jew from long island, not the best, same with the brisket.  if you're not like me, and not used to amazing homemade brisket and challah bread, then it was easily amazing.

My man and I always say we need to actually get meals there but we love the Happy Hour so much we haven't yet.

DRINKS-They are known for their beers and they have a great selection. Every time we go we try something different. They also have drinks on Happy Hour. The best drink special they have going all the time is the 7 second challenge. Finish your beer in seven seconds and it's free!!!!!

SERVICE-We always sit at the bar and the service has been good every time. They do get very busy so the wait is a little longer at times but that is expected at any great restaurant. Bartenders are knowledgeable about beers so if you have questions don't be afraid to ask.

PARKING-It's at the casino, parking is still free here so take advantage of it before they starts charging too!!!!

They have a pretty good drink menu with a huge selection of beers. The strawberry mojito is delicious!! Get a pitcher for $40 and split it with friends. A few people at our table also got adult milkshakes which were pretty good, but apparently not as good as the regular milkshakes.

4701493,2013-09-06,2,dn_ipqbm7_jUz5X3rDez_A,"When it first opened in 2010, I visited at least twice, with different friends. And I distinctly remember that we all enjoyed it! The atmosphere, the food, the beer selection. I know there were a couple other times I had the intention of going, but decided on other restaurants in City Center or Aria. It was good, not amazing, and not enough to compete with new restaurants and bars popping up in the last three years with similar menus and/or themes.

I know a lot of people say this and it's a tad cliché, but I really wanted to like this place again. My brother, Marcus L., fiancé, Teresa S., and I were leaving Zarkana and decided to stay in City Center to eat/avoid traffic. Since I was the only one in the group to have been to PUB, it seemed to be the perfect spot. We were seated right away and pleasantly surprised that we were there for the start of Happy Hour (their second Happy Hour is 10pm to closing daily)! It features $1 Chicken Wings, $2 Oysters, $3 Sliders, and 1/2 off pint draft beers and glasses by the wine. We decided on 10 sliders and an order of Waffle Fries ($8) for the group. My fiancé and I both ordered a pint of Früli Strawberry beer ($6 during H/H) while I got a Caesar Salad ($12) and he got Bangers & Mash ($18). 

The service was...interesting. We weren't entirely pleased, but fortunately, it wasn't horrible. It was just odd. Our server just assumed we knew what Happy Hour entailed (to our defense, the little 1/4 paper doesn't explain details) so we were forced to ask multiple questions and follow-up questions. Which would have been fine, but after answering one question, the server would immediately say, ""I can come back if you need more time,"" leaving us with, ""Um, um, well, uh"" and trying to quickly phrase our next question. It was so uncomfortable! But, other than our ordering experience, the service was good throughout the meal. The person who brought out the food was really nice and our server came to check on us three times.

The food was extremely prompt, so that was great. The Sliders were only shrug-worthy. They were flavorless with a sad amount of caramelized onions (some seeming almost non-existent) and barely enough Thousand Island dressing. Also, only some of our order were cooked Medium Rare, like we requested. The Waffle Fries were delicious, but I can't give a restaurant much credit for something that came out of a bag/box then fried, especially at $8. My Caesar Salad was decent (didn't love the dressing), but made me extremely sad having paid $12 for the small bowl. Not worth it AT ALL. The Bangers & Mash were just okay as well. The sausages were okay, but the mash was weird. It had large chucks of potatoes on the bottom that resembled a kind of hash, then a small amount of mashed potatoes on top of it, then the gravy and sausages. The description doesn't describe the potato chucks, so perhaps it was an odd part of the gravy? So, mysterious substandard potatoes that took away from the dish, got it. No one was really impressed.

Our bill was just under $100 (tax and tip included), ouch. When you consider the type of eateries in the valley that serve superior tastes at much lower prices, it's hard to consider this worthwhile.

As for the Happy Hour deals, I'm not sure if the wings are truly cheaper than a regular order and the oysters are EXACTLY the same price you'd pay outside H/H (it doesn't even leave anything to the imagination because the menu literally says $2 each). And the sliders are basically the same price as the regular order, unless you don't want fries (the regular order, $16, comes with three sliders and skinny fries, $8 as a side order).

For example, we always get their Brown Butter Lobster Rolls and it used to be amazing...three little rolls filled to the top with REAL lobster meat (claws and all) for only $25 but now the rolls are barely filled and the meat looks like previously frozen and maybe not even real lobster and to top it off, they raised the price to $26!

$12.00 for Chili Recommended by server... was ground beef... it was hearty, plentiful, not very tasty and had no sauce it was more like dry beef with a little sauce, onions. 

$9.00 Clam Chowder was decent... did not appear homemade. 

$9.00 Onion Soup best of the appetizer lot. 

Entrees: 
""We are Famous for our ""Lobster Rolls"" ... $24.00 for 3 puff bread with chunks of lobster with the worst Sauce ever tasted. 

2 prime Beef sandwiches with swiss, carmelized onions and Au Ju $20.00 were pretty tasty and the skinny fries hot and fresh. 

.... watch some more of the game.. and finally pack it in...

I find No redeeming feature regarding this place aside from theme.  Food was simply OK, service spotty, bartenders, front staff, and management clueless and price points that are in short Ridiculous.

The long: This wasn't my choice for food and now that I have experienced it I will never let the person who chose it pick again. We had a reservation and still waited close to 30 mins to be seated and when they sat us the table still had dirty dishes on it. The interior of this place is LOUD which is I assume due to the fact every surface is hard so sound bounces all over. Plus everyone is hammered because well it is Vegas. The menu has some high points and low points, but overall nothing that is just going to wow you. The coolest thing this place has to offer is a make your own bloody Mary option which is kinda neat. 

Our server had to be the worst I have ever seen as he had 2 tables and couldn't keep up with that. He had zero menu knowledge and couldn't really make any suggestions. Even if he was new he should have learned a little bit and even faked it. The drinks took close to 20mins to get to the table and we had to flag someone down to get them even then. The food took over an hour and nothing was good. Beer battered pickles were limp and soggy. I ordered a simple artisinal hot dog which came on stale bread with watery chili. The other dishes at the table were crab cake sliders which arrived crumbled into pieces, shepherd's pie which might as well have been a hungry man meal, and a brown butter lobster roll with lobster you could have bounced off the floor and hit the ceiling. Even after sending all the food back barely eaten and making a point of telling the server we had issues no attempt to make anything right was done. Do yourself a favor and go eat ANYWHERE else. For the quality and the money I would rather eat at a national chain pub and I hate chain restaurants.

What works: A neat idea behind a make your own bloody Mary menu

They have a nice variety of beers and ciders on tap to choose from to fill your yard glass. 

I chose to go with a cider. I am not too clear on what that particular cider was called but it was fruity with a pear/melon flavor?

Drunk chips: House made chips, tomato, scallion, blue cheese crumbles, bbq beef ragu, scallion aioli.

I ordered a burger with a GINORMOUS hunk of Humboldt Fog and homemade kettle chips.  De-lish.  I tried a piece of my friend's pastrami meat from his sandwich and found it unreasonably salty.  But, then again, I'm not a pastrami fan to begin with so I may not be the best tongue.

The place scored major points for the extremely attentive bartenders.  Those girls are awesome.

Large TVs to watch the game, hockey was on when we were there. I tried a few bites of everyone's food and everything was awesome! The brisket was so flavorful and the sliders were tasty. I have to say my fave was the fries, some of the best french fries I have tasted since the ones at Half Moon. Yum! Have to try them! 

Oh but don't forget about the 7 second beer chugging challenge.... order any draft beer and finish it in 7 seconds or less and you don't have to pay for it. Awesome idea! Here in AZ we aren't able to play such fun drinking games, but Vegas is a whole different story.

Service - For a humongous place, the service was quite good.

Drinks - Different sizes for a pint of Guiness or your other favorites. And, the pint is the smallest size. Very cool.

Food - Oh, I just had dinner and still munched on their food. Order the ""Dirty Chip"".  You gotta try it.

Price - Ahhh,  okay that was a bit pricey.

Ambiance.  Too large, not too intimate.  Pubs should be eclectic and not, well clubby.  But definitely this place is huge.

Parking - if you are a local, well, what a pain to wait for your car, but it is part of the valet experience.

I would give this place a four, but due to such a large size place and high prices, I gotta reduce it a bit!

No problem. We totally understood. The bartender, feeling bad that it was our honeymoon, called over the manager (John?) who expressed how badly he felt and told us that we should come back the next couple of days and he would give us two bloodys on the house (which we didn't expect, we really were just excited about trying them). We made it a point to schedule a time to head back over to get the much antipated drink and when we got there the manager (John?) told us he was sorry that there was no one there who knew how to make them. I wanted to leave but my husband said we should just order a couple of drinks anyway. And we did. I assumed, in good manners, the manager would at least comp our $13 drinks as a courtesy.

Confirmed or Plausible?

Your hair so silky red
My feelings hard now to explain
My spidey sense is acting up
So please come be my Mary Jane.

Not a smoking reference
Don't dichotomize like Petty
Join my heart breakin' band 
Cuz I am 'Hipster' ready

You proudly wear your oversized
Leopard patterned glasses
So here's my love confessional
Your test, I hope it passes

Got my heart tickin' like a bomb
come diffuse
You wear your heart on your sleeve
I can see it in your tattoos

I said you were my dream girl
Rebuttal with an awkward pose
Failed attempted ugly face
Flared nostrils on a pretty nose

Double pierced tongue
I want to check your teeth for enamel
A dental hygienist married 
Sith destroyer Mark Hamill

Star crossed lovers, yeah,
I could be your Jedi Knight
And if you so agreed to it
I'd use the force like every night

Night time raccoon attack
You know I'd suck the rabies out
Just to kiss your pale skin
Let's churn 'sun-burn-babies' out

I'm Burning up, I understand 
there's prolley not a chance in hell
Do me a solid, don't change a bit
stay you, you do it so well

4966883,2014-01-27,2,dn_ipqbm7_jUz5X3rDez_A,"Stopped in after seeing La Rêve and on my way back to my room at Vdara. It was later in the evening, so I just wanted a beer and something to ensure I wouldn't get hungry in the middle of the night. Well, I did get a beer, but I ended up at Jean Patisserie for some cold sandwiches after the laughable experience I had at P.U.B.

Initially, my server came across like a pretty decent guy, but after a short time he seemed to be bothered by mother and I. We were obviously not a priority to him by any means. This was very clear when I watched him pick up my drinks from the bar for a moment, place them back down, pick up another party's, and walk out onto the dining floor. This was also very clear when he served us our appetizer before finally retrieving our drinks. Wtf? Is he new? No restaurant I've ever been to has thought that was the acceptable order service. I highly doubt that one founded by Todd English would feel differently.

My appetizer of fried pickles was also ridiculously soggy. So much so that even though I was very hungry, I ate two bites and couldn't bring myself to take another. Sitting under the heating lamps too long while my server socialized with other, more familiar, patrons? That's my best guess.

Finally, when I decided I'd had enough of P.U.B. for one lifetime, I ended up having to tell the bartender I wanted my check - minus the nasty pickles - because the server had put my table on ignore. It was like he thought, ""Hey, they got their drinks and pickles. What else could they want?"" He actually walked past once without a glance since setting down the drinks, but that was all I had seen of him for 10-15 minutes. Again, no restaurant I've ever been to has thought it acceptable for a server to not ask how everything is shortly after serving it. But perhaps I've been living on a different planet, or in the Twilight Zone or something...who knows...

To summarize: This place sucks. With all the places to get a drink and bite to eat just in Aria alone, I don't understand why anyone would ever go here unless by mistake; like me. Don't be fooled about this restaurant, people. It's nothing like what you'd expect from an establishment boasting Todd English's name, and located in one of the most beautiful hotel and casinos in Las Vegas.",QDlW-vc4YW0gw5MWRN_5dg,2,2,1,X4tngqAkJYtMWcN0ls1Vvw

Food: 3/5
Atmosphere: 3/5
Service: 2/5

Food-
I ordered the corned beef, potato, with egg on top skillet.  I found it to be pretty bland.  The corned beef itself was good but the potato cubes had no flavor.  I thought the egg on top was going to be a sunny side up egg, but it seems to have been over cooked and was more of a sunny side up hard boiled egg.  My wife had the cured salmon bagel tacos and they were pretty good and creative.  We also had a side of pickles (different flavors), I expected something like a New York deli pickles but there didn't seem to be much variety in the group.

Atmosphere-
It is loud in here.  This is a hotspot for the hangover crowd (their specialty is organic bloody mary's).  The decorum is simply...pub.

Service-
We waited about 10 minutes before our waitress made it over.  When my wife asked what cure salmon was ( I had already told her it was cold smoked salmon but she didn't believe me) the waitress replied that it was grilled.  When we got the dish it was indeed cold smoked salmon.  To say the least, service is lacking... we saw the waitress just before as it was time to see the bill the second time.

Got the beef sliders and mini corn dogs.
Sliders - Bland.  The beef wasn't really seasoned (though I guess that's standard in many places) so didn't really taste great.  The slider buns were pretty good - nice flavor and texture.  It let you eat your slider without things spilling everywhere.  But overall it just didn't taste that great.  Even the onions they serve it with get lost in the strength of the slider's sauce as well as the pickles served with it.  
Mini corn dogs with skinny fries - Corn dogs were, again, bland.  The batter had a nice texture but don't think it offered much flavor beyond just kind of a normal sweetness.  The dogs were made of decent meat (I think) but just not seasoned.  Fries were ok - but they did get soggy towards the bottom of the cup.  Not so bad since they would get cold served on a plate (there were lots of them).

I'm willing to try again as it looked like a really cool place and the Aria poker room is my new favorite.  But the food, so far, was poor.  Service was kind of lacking too.  Bartenders spent a lot of time socializing while patrons were kind of waiting there for service.  My water glass went unfilled my whole meal.",-Ox7QPz0G56GOzT0ex-f5Q,1,0,2,NdlSJ9NM-APUKIXX5lnI_Q

I really like the menu here. Lots of interesting twists on classics. One of my favorites was the pastrami sliders. They were super tasty with nice lean meat and soft bun and it comes with a healthy size of fries... all for only $13. The service could not have been better! Our waiter was super informative, attentive and friendly. The vibe inside is energetic without being overly loud or gimicky. The abundance of booths is a big plus also. The beer selection is outstanding.

THE BAD: 
While I understand the prices in Vegas (and places like this) are a bit high... I found the food prices to be a real value, BUT the beer prices are too high. $8-9 for a pint is a bit too much. If the prices were in the $6-7 range, we would have ordered a second round. Also, the fish & chips was just OK...

BOTTOM LINE:
In an area of the Vegas Strip (CityCenter) that has uber-high priced everything, you can escape all that at P.U.B. You'll be treated to every interesting and delicious food along with a pint of beer for a decent price.",2nXpeVQyYUDOWgSgsoRPRA,0,0,4,5z5NB6JNhAh0-76vGU_uAw
5041547,2014-01-08,0,dn_ipqbm7_jUz5X3rDez_A,"We came to Todd English P.U.B. for a friends birthday after a night at the Cosmo ice skating rink.  I definitely wanted to visit this place, being that Todd English is a 4-time James Beard award winner.  Yum, I heard the place was located in Crystals mall, so what a great opportunity to Yelp and top notch place on the strip!

We originally parked at the Cosmo and walked over to Crystals.  There's a convenient over pass, but let me tell you, the restaurant is situated in a little nook in the mall, so make sure you keep your eyes open!  Once you get in the place, you'll notice the round circular lamp chandeliers.  The lighting is a bit dim and offers a romantic/intimate setting.  One of the immediate focal points is the seafood bar.  When I went there, not much of the seafood was displayed, rather a bunch of crushed ice.  We were sat in the back where you say a cool exposed brick wall.  You got to see the expediter station and where the food was being cooked!  I love exposed kitchens.  It contributes to the intimate type setting, like you have a personal chef! Our servers name was Corey.  He was a cool guy, really nice and accommodating.  He checked on our table once in a while and didn't breathe down our neck which was very much appreciated.

Some restaurants provide a basket of bread before the meal.  This place, oddly enough, gives a small bucket of popcorn.  To me, it says cheap.  I'm not really a fan of that.  I'd put that in the same boat as giving peanuts.  Not something I really expected from a Todd English establishment, but it did the trick.  For my drink, I got the Gnarly Head Pinot Grigio for $11 a glass.  Heads up, if you check in to Yelp, you get a free 12oz glass of light beer!  I got that too :) LOL. For dinner, I got the New Amsterdam burger for $18.  This burger is a 10oz beef patty, shaved pastrami, kraut, Swiss cheese, picklelilly and fatty fries.  I got the patty medium rare which was perfectly cooked, the shaved pastrami was nice and salty.  I asked for the kraut on the side, but should had it on the burger like it came.  Offered a tangy element and a light crunchy texture to the burger.  The fatty fries were little wedges, nothing groundbreaking but they did give a lot!

At the end of the day, the place was better than OK. I wouldn't mind going back to try the seafood as it looks like a highlight to the restaurant.  Thanks for a great birthday dinner for my friend!",CNaaizAUc2c4WIb1M3BBPw,1,0,4,V2sI0_J1nBMGr459H34x_w

This pub is easy on the eyes, and has TWO happy hours for you to catch. (3-6p or 10p-12a) Somehow, we managed to miss both. Poop!

Should you desire one of their infamous bloody marys or bubbly drinks, make sure you seek out the table at the entrance, where a gaggle of young ladies in cowgirl getups will take your order on a checklist and bring your drink(s) to your table. You'll have the option to select your liquor, add-ins, and appetizer choices. These drinks are not found on the standard menu and are not made at the bar. 

Displayed out in front of the outside seating area is the ultimate Bloody Mary known as All about Mary. Here's where it gets a little weird. It's like they create a pupu platter of common appetizers, and arrange them above your drink so you get a single serving and taste of each item. One chicken wing, one large cocktail shrimp, one pub slider...you get the idea. It's like lunch in a drink. A genius idea, but with so-so execution. 

The drink took about 10 minutes to make because the girls had to wait for each food item to arrive from the kitchen before they could go about the tricky business of arranging it in a pint glass. The bloody mary itself was a little warm, and we asked the bartender to refresh it with some extra ice. No fresh cracked pepper in it, so the hubs dressed it up with extra dashes from the pepper shaker. The chicken wing stood out, but the rest of the appetizers were not especially memorable. 

Waffle fries were as delicious as I expected. When we asked for mayo, our helpful bartender offered two options, standard or black truffle mayo. The latter was very tasty. It went well on the little pub slider that came with the All About Mary. 

Pricey but an enjoyable experience. If you appreciate clean marble countertops and alternative rock bands like Muse, this might be your kind of place. Maybe you'll witness someone try and succeed at the 7 second challenge. Cheers!",UIn1TskIxqWCVOkiZoJfzQ,1,1,3,xcnYpO6BjoZCEnM7ikSkFw

5094706,2014-12-24,10,dn_ipqbm7_jUz5X3rDez_A,"Get stuffed!  Literally.

Not health food.  Large portions deep fried or with fat and juices from properly roasted joins, added calories from cheeses and spreads; this is Vegas.  Straight forward British pub grub paired with very well chosen selections of beers on tap.

The carvery is the focus.  Select half or a full pound of the protein, bread and two sauces.  Simples.  Do select heartier breads (sandwich breads turn to mush).  Stick to simple sauces (black truffle mayo or horseradish scour cream) if you want to accentuate the roasted flavors of the proteins.  Proteins themselves are perfectly cooked remembering that this is NOT a Jewish deli.  Outstanding, brisket.  Dripping with juices, deep flavor, just the right amount of fat.  The lamb, cooked mid rare has a mild lamb flavor.  Finally, the duck confit with its good thyme scented backbone.  Moist and crisp when heated.  All good eats.  All sandwiches are accompanies by a crock of pickled root veg.  The very strong acidic finish is required to cut through the fatty goodness of the sandwiches.

Great starters include a simple white wine steamed clams with apple wood smoked bacon.  The fat from the bacon imparts a great richness and flavor to the clams.  The steamed PEI mussels are also very well done.  Tender, just cooked through with a great spicy tomato broth.  The accompanying garlic aioli and crispy fried cherry peppers adds the right amount of complexity and heat to keep the palate alive.

Standard pub fare (fish and chips; very good with perfectly cooked, heavily battered, crisp on the outside and moist on the inside, with a nice side of fluffy chips and mushy peas and the grilled banger and mash with its deeply caramelized onion gravy) are great.

Excellent service bordering on off Strip Vegas local (real people living real lives).

Great energy and pub ambiance.  Crack the peanuts and throw the shells on the ground, bar games for free beers if you can finish in a crazy short time, games on nice and loud and the energy of the guest.

Note:  Outstanding happy hour and reverse happy hour with half off all beers and wine.  

Many, many repeat visits.  Always consistent.

So I get the craziness and can imagine Vegas is amplified but not even an acknowledgment that we were sitting there and someone would be with is shortly left a bad taste.",B38hvOkejRRTl60OAg9XVQ,0,0,1,iBivjBqCT7uXBXhGX7I94w

We came here with a party of 8 for an early dinner on a Wednesday. and the place was already beginning to get full. 

They have seating inside and outside. 

What I suggest:

-Brown butter lobster rolls: 3 mini lobster rolls. Very good! The lobster was prepared well it was very moist and tender. The roll was very buttery and crispy. It also came with freshly made potato chips.

-fish and chips: The fish was very flaky. You can pick fatties or skinnies fries.

-sweet potato fries

-pretzel sticks w/ cheese

-bread pudding: This dessert is a must! It's delicious. 

Restrooms: They have restrooms for men and women in the restaurant.",yeHRi5kh2qFcGE-0em2r4w,0,0,4,MOmurOAG8gWlcL1t3DwfAQ

Me & my BFF (best sister in the world) were plowing around Vegas and spotted the Todd English Happy Hour special on a SUNDAY (whhhheeeeee!). They feature a 3-2-1 promo for $3 sliders, $2 oysters, $1 chicken wings. We took advantage and OMG. The wings & sliders were fantastic (we didn't try the oysters). We sat at the bar and had top notch service, watched the Olympics at our request, and chatted up all kinds of friendly patrons and staff. What a wonderful place...I think we could have turned it into our very own version of Cheers. Extra thanks to the manager, Matt.

We were able to secure a booth in the back of the restaurant where we could take in all of the sights and we had a great time and meal. The decor is what you might expect in a pub- complete with dart boards and rich wood furniture. The ceilings are very high so the noise level gets a bit loud, but this is not the romantic dinner spot you were looking for anyway. Yelpers-- check in and get a free beer!!! Even though I was having a martini, I couldn't help but snag this deal up. 
To be honest, I wasn't expecting as good a meal as we had- the duck rolls appetizer was simply out of this world (see pics attached) and the mad Russian swears that this was the single best Tuna dish she has ever had. That is saying something indeed- It was a perfectly prepared ""burger"" that she wishes she could have another bite of even as I write this. I had fish and chips that was good and I would recommend it to anyone who likes a good portion of battered fish.

Service/Atmosphere: Awesome! We sat at the bar and were well taken care of all afternoon. My gripe here is there aren't enough TVs and they are too small. Unless you get a great seat expect to be squinting at the TV. The placement is also odd. The bar has TV's on the ends but none in the middle? Annoying if you're stuck in the middle seats. This was a fun place to watch World Cup - but only because we got good seats. 

Drinks: Prices were bad, as expected. Not like gouge you bad, but typical Vegas strip prices. $8-$10 average for a pint (at least they had fancy ass beers!), $10 for a glass of wine, $11 for a mixed drink. The free beer if you can chug it in 4 seconds game was a cool addition but didn't see anyone trying it ! 

Food: Some real gems! A raw bar and carvery and tons of fun sounding British pub type food ! SWEET! We tried 2 meats from the ""carvery"": Brisket and Duck. 1 # of each was $30ish/meat. Hardly cheap, but I'd say count on 1/2 # pp .. $15 each for a good meal isn't terrible. You get to pick 2 sauces per meat and 1 bread per meat. The standout sauce is the black truffle mayo.. OMG it's wonderful on ANYTHING. You've made a mistake if you don't choose it ! So the brisket was just OK, definitely not best BBQ in vegas material or anything. The duck was FANTASTIC. Only pet peeve here was they just shoved 1/2 a duck on our plate. So much for their ""carvery"". If I'm paying you $30 for half a duck can you cut it up for me damnit?! Other than having to carve our own duck at the bar, I absolutely adored that dish. Would get it again and again. Does duck go with black truffle mayo? Oh hell YES it does!

There was a variety of bread to choose from and challah seemed like the best choice.  The sweet potato fries were very crisp and hot too!  Oh, on a whim I had an oyster shooter.  A oyster with cocktail sauce swimming in vodka and a splash of beer sounded like a perfect idea.

5278793,2011-01-01,3,dn_ipqbm7_jUz5X3rDez_A,"Full review at the Blog - high points below:

""Dirty Chips"" consisted of a large pile of house cut kettle chips topped with bits of crispy house cured bacon, tomatoes, chopped scallions, chunks of blue cheese, blue cheese dressing, and fried chicken livers.  Never one to eat processed snack foods this was a rare experience for me with potato chips (or popcorn) and although the others ate more than myself, I loved the way the crisp chips held up to the ample toppings and despite the sheer gluttons of the dish the flavor profile was nicely balanced, albeit quite heavy.

""Grichebactom.""  Described as the ""workman's"" grilled cheese I'm not so sure many ""workmen"" find this in their lunchbox, but the combination of grilled sourdough, creamy brie cheese, double smoked bacon, and fresh tomatoes with a side of skinny fries was certainly delicious.  Using the fries largely as a delivery mechanism for Chef English's signature ketchup and BBQ sauce the chunky ketchup was outstanding, loaded with smoke and garlic while the BBQ was a tad sweeter than I'd prefer.  

BLT Sliders with Nueskes bacon, roma tomato, maple aioli, and skinny fries. Served as three buttery rolls loaded with supple bacon, sweet tomatoes, and crisp lettuce the aioli was actually quite mild and more hickory than maple.  Another large portion considering the price and ingredients a whole sandwich ended up packed to go home along with most of the fries.

Duck buns - a rather Asian inspired dish placing confit leg in an aromatic and sweet hoisin sauce on steamed buns, my first bite was good - the confit excellent.  Next adding the cucumber slaw and cool yogurt sauce, this is where the buns truly shined - as good as any steamed bun I've had, whether Dim Sum or David Chang.

Lobster Poppie with yorkshire pudding, creamy corn, and brown butter lobster.  Essentially a pot pie with a significant portion of buttery fresh lobster baked atop flaky pastry and dressed In chipotle sauce and house made sweet cream corn the flavors were excellent, though the chipotle was a tad overwhelming in bites where too much had soaked into the pastry.  Listed as a sharable appetizer I'm not sure how well this would divide as it was rather small, but as a main course it would satisfy most.

Mona's bread pudding with English toffee sauce, salted caramel ice cream, cap'n crunch.  A large brick of lovely custardized bread with a bruleed top, the bread pudding itself was loaded with cinnamon, sugar, and rum.  Resting in a boozy toffee sauce that tasted largely butterscotch and topped with whipped cream and salty caramel ice cream the dish was finished with a playful handful of children's cereal.  Intensely sweet but subtle in the way all the ingredients contributed to the overall flavor the dish was simple and wonderful

""Ninja Snacks,"" a plate of eight crispy wontons filled with nutella and banana served with ""ninja sauce"" that tasted quite similar to my English toffee.  Naming issues aside, the wontons themselves were excellent and absolutely stuffed with filling.  Using sliced banana instead of a puree lent texture beyond the crispy wrappers and while the sauce wasn't necessary it certainly didn't hurt.

""The Elvis,"" a dish described as pound cake, peanut butter, brûléed bananas, maple bacon and served with a shirley temple.  Delivered as two ""sandwiches"" utilizing pound cake as the bread it really isn't that the dish was poorly designed as it was that the cake was simply too dry.  Tasty otherwise, especially the bacon/maple/banana/peanut butter combination, the Shirley Temple was very sweet and obviously added more for kitsch than flavor.  The chocolate covered peanut was also quite tasty.

Chocolate Rendezvous, would essentially represent a chocolate crème brulee topped with peanut butter mousse, topped with marshmallow, and then finished in the oven.  A parfait of sorts with different textures as the spoon proceeded downward the dish was actually too large for something so rich...like the bread pudding and ninja snacks it was a dessert that could have easily been shared, and so it was.

In a city where the rich and the poor are quite well represented (The amenities, the shopping, the restaurants, and the patrons) it is nice to see there are some places still targeting the ""middle"" and doing a good job with a ""something for everyone"" approach.  Above average food made from above average ingredients in a nice space at below average prices should keep Mr. English's P.U.B in business for quite some time, especially if a whole meal can be had at the price of a pair of socks at the shopping center next door.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,5,4,4,f8bYPA9OwFKGi4ACQuIkzw

Expecting the same pretentiousness all over, we were pleasantly surprised when we showed up without a reservation and the hostess was a doll and our waiter equally nice.  Not to mention, our food came fast!

I love nice people and I completely sucked in all the smiles and graciousness like I was starved for it.   The food was hit and miss but I can recommend the happy hour sliders and the bloody mary's.   The bloody mary's are a meal in itself.   Meaty with the right amount of spice, tart and tang.   The beef sliders don't look like much when they come out but the meat is juicy and seasoned well with a dollop of carmelized onions...more please!   Completely pass on the chicken sliders and the pretzel.   They were tasteless and the pretzel was dry.   

This place has a nice, warm, low key pub atmosphere you expect to get at a local joint.   That's hard to accomplish in a place like Vegas.

- Bloody Mary - there tomato juice is so fresh and you can definitely taste all the spices that goes into the drink.  It's topped off with a pickled carrot, green bean as well as an olive and piece of cheddar cheese.  Definitely a must try here!

- Fried pickles - this was deep fried and came with 3 different sauces. It was like a blue cheese, thousand island and bbq kind of sauce.  The pickles were sweet, not at all sour, so I really enjoyed it.

My husband loved the Bloody Mary and was happy that we made the right choice in stopping by here.  We were staying at Aria Hotel, so it was conveniently located right in between the lobby and mall!

The beer selection is satisfactory. No complaints there. The Tenaya brews are actually local, and it's good to see a big Vegas hotel restaurant supporting a local brewery. My nutty brown had a full flavor, not too bitter but not tasteless. Thumbs up.

The Welsh Rarebit was not good. It didn't sound the most appetizing (it's basically an open-faced grilled cheese) but again, since my dad is from Wales, we decided to go with it. We got what we expected. I think they have it on the menu because it's British. I doubt anyone actually orders it. I wouldn't recommend it. Thumbs down.

The Kelley's Sliders were decent enough. They used juicy prime rib. If we would have stuck with another order or two of these, the experience would have been 4 stars. Thumbs up.

Lobster Poppie was thoroughly confusing. Splitting it 4 ways is NOT the best way to go about this. Now I didn't get the full scoop on its history, but it was basically like a little pot pie with 2 pieces of lobster, way too much bread and some random filling (with corn?). Might have been good if it was only for me, but again we chopped it up and shared. As with most things lobster, there was not enough lobster. Definitely overpriced. Thumbs down.

Shrimp cocktail was disappointing... mostly because at $4.50 a shrimp you'd expect it to be the best in the world. Thumbs down. 

Service was great... our waitress was polite, well informed and even took back a mixed drink that was ordered because my beautiful date didn't like it. Thumbs up. 

Atmosphere is what you'd expect from a Vegas ""PUB"". Trendy. Stylish. Mostly comfortable. They allowed us to be seated right away in the barstool section, near the bar. Thumbs up.

It took them about 10 minutes to switch it back and the manager insisted that all ten of us have been watching the other game this entire time and that the game has not been switched. Seriously??

I was full and was too busy watching a basketball game after I claimed my free beer upon check-in that I didn't realize my friend had the burger split so we can share fries and a burger.  He asked for truffle mayo to dip the fries in and it was great.  The best part of the evening was the food came out in no more than 10 minutes!  The friend was going on and on about the food, I didn't touch it except for the fries - I was too focused on the game.  He finished my half too - I guess he was saying it was real good?

The other times I've been here, I had the Organic Chicken Pot Pie and Shepherd's Pie - comfort food!  Hot, filling and delicious.  Angus Sliders were pretty good and juicy.  The Corn Dog Puppies come with fries and we order it everytime I'm here with my family.  But what I always get is their Lobster Rolls with slaw and kettle chips - one of my favorite lobster rolls in Vegas.  Nice big chunks of lobster on a buttery toast.  Absolutely delish!

Of course, it won't be a pub unless they have beer.  They have a great selection of beers here.  Stella, Carlsberg, Blue Moon, Pabst, Red Stripe, Amstel, Heineken, Bud, etc.  They have gluten-free beer too.

I ate the tuna burger.  It was great.  I got rid of the bun most of the way through and focused on the rest of the 'burger' and dressings.

The fries were a bit crisp.  If that was not intended, a bit of QC might be added to the kitchen.

Because of TE's other places like Olives, I was excited to try the pickles they brine on site.  They were OK.  Nothing to rave about...expected a bit more.

Be sure to see that you can get a free beer if you check in on Yelp there.  

Another time I had a Pastrami sandwich.  They said they make the pastrami on site.  It was really good.  I asked if it was big...they said it was New York deli sandwich big.  Pastrami and corned beef sandwiches at Jewish delis in NYC are often 9 inches tall.  That was what I was hoping for.

At first glance, it's cute..and it tells you to come hither.

So you do.

I was expecting awesome food for some odd reason..  mostly because I love pubs, and most of the time the experience is fun and yummy.

We arrived as a group of six, and were seated within ten minutes.  So far so good.

The menu is fun.  Half of the menu (literally, half) is their beer selection.  Too bad I only like pale/light/crisp beers, so my choices were limited.. but I still enjoyed my ""Straten"", from Germany.  On draft/draught.  

I was debating between the bison burger (never had, and was even contemplating subbing with regular ground beef had I gotten it).. the toppings sounded good..  I think it was blue cheese, celery, carrot.  Now that I wrote it out, it doesn't sound that great at all.  Either way, I'll never know, because I got the fish and chips.  Figured.. it's an English pub.. get one of their specialties.  

My cousins got the chicken parm sliders.  They actually sound good, even though it's not the thing to order anywhere that isn't Italian.  But there was a problem.  So let me ask you this.  When you hear ""chicken parm"", you think breaded chicken breast, right?  Not ground chicken meat with a sour marinara, right?  Well, that's what this was.  Ground chicken.  Why?  It should be named ""ground chicken sliders with acidic tomato sauce"".  And you only get three, and I believe it's an ""entree"" dish!  Not an appetizer.  Booooo.

My fish n' chips were good, but nothing that other pubs should be worried about.  Two pieces of fried Cod, and the batter was good.  Crispy, although a bit too thick.  The fish itself was a tad overcooked and rubbery, but shake some malt vinegar on it and you're good to go.  It comes with thick/steak cut fries.  The dipping sauces are tartar and a creamy malt vinegar.  I prefer regular malt vinegar, which you have to ask for..    odd for an English pub.  Usually they have cruets or the Heinz version of it on the table.  $18?  That's not right.  Oh, but it was.

Anyway, the person who wrote the menu descriptions should be paid a million billion dollars for making everything sound so good.. and unique.  

Ambiance is cool.  Beer selection is nice.  Food is a definite miss.  Prices are not matched properly to the quality and amount.  Service is very good.  The employees are very friendly and kind.",0tf14Cq5NU3PBINpEDXZdQ,2,1,2,9d1Rz8E_fdp2Nn0inMMqEQ

This was my first visit to PUB and all I can say is WOW.  I didn't know what to expect from this place but it became clear to me how perfect this restaurant was in every way.  The location is great, easy to get to from Aria, the Crystals, the Cosmopolitan and the Strip.  The atmosphere is casual and it is perfect for Vegas.  It envelopes you, takes over you, and is easy to get into the relaxed, casual, PUB atmosphere that so many other restaurants try so hard to replicate but none get as good as English.  But don't be fooled, because I haven't mentioned the food yet, and the food is the STAR of the show!  I had an order of dumplings that were better than Wing Lei at the Wynn.  The burgers are delicious and the entrees as good as any of the more ""formal"" restaurants around town, including English's own Olives at the Bellagio.  So even if you are not a drinker, this place is for you.  But if you do drink, the beer list is incredible.  This restaurant fires on all cylinders and is now permanently on my must go list for any Vegas trip.  It is equally appropriate for guys night out, a couple's date, a family dinner & solo dining.

Customer service can make or break a restaurant and the service here is just not cutting it. 

We arrived, had our food ordered and no one came back to ask us how we were doing for over half an hour. I would understand if the place was busy, but there were 4 empty tables around! It was not even busy! Come on?! Seriously?!?!!? Over 40+ minutes before my table even got our food! 

But my company was good so I guess it made the visit not too bad, but just a note to the management. Try not to leave your guests without any service or food for more than 20 minutes....let alone 40!

5431125,2017-04-26,1,dn_ipqbm7_jUz5X3rDez_A,"This is ONLY a review of the midweek bloody, the ""All About Mary"" in particular. First off, let's acknowledge the enormity of this thing. Major props for the sheer size. Topped with: 3 sandwich slices of salami, cheese cube, 3 stalks of celery, 2 hot wings (1 drummy, 1 wing), a jumbo shrimp (notably large and incredibly well cooked) mini corn dog, beef slider w/ cheddar and bacon (bit dry) and a lemon & lime wedge (not wimpy slices). Now time to list the pickled items: carrot stick, asparagus, 3 green beans, peperoncino, and a pickle. There was a seasoned rim that I think may have been old bay and black pepper but it didn't hold a lot of flavor for me. I'm hoping I didn't leave any accoutrement out. Refer to photo for fact checking. 
Now about the actual Bloody Mary itself. I found the drink lacking a particular briteness or needing a hint of citrus maybe. I would have been much less impressed had it not come with a platter of food...I can't recommend this drink on the mix alone. It's really about the bragging rights and photo cred. Having said this, the bartenders were friendly, accommodating (even agreeing to take my picture) and the atmosphere was upscale casual. I studied the menu believing I was going to have the room to order a lunch item (likely would have chosen the lobster rolls, which I saw get served to a man sitting next to me-YUM!) then hoping for, at the very least, some room for the chowder. However, all of these dreams were laid to rest in just about 6 mins into my time spent with Mary. Instead, like a true Wisconsite, I ordered a beer and wrestled through the rest of what lay on my plate, and then just paid my bill. I paid for that $35 bloody mary I'd set out to conquer and I made peace with that. Fun field trip!",tGttNiR6zHGKlh128C3dYA,2,2,4,JosiwkJL12kyb_8Cxx6U4w

If you've come to drink more than two beers, you might be safe if you bring an extra Benjamin. Although they have a top tier beer selection, they've quite simply priced me out. It's understandable for the price point for a cask ale or for a bottled specialty brew, but for common microbrews on tap (Boston Beer, Sierra Nevada, New Belgium, Anchor) that you can find readily and locally, the mark up is preposterous ($14 for a pint of Fat Tire or Sam). Yes, I am completely aware and cognizant it's on the Strip, in Crystals, and it should be expected, but as Chris Carter would say, ""C'Mon Man!""

My brother and I came here after a race during late night happy hour. Happy hour is the best time to have multiple beers because drafts are half off the average $12-$14 price tag for a pint. Happy hour specials also include a dozen oysters for $23, $2 wings (which include the wing, drum, and tip), and $3 sliders. These food prices are a minute discount from the regular price and you're not really getting that good of a deal.

We enjoyed the food that we did taste. The East coast oysters were served with a mignonette, straight horseradish, and cocktail sauce. The wings had a more tangy kick and the sliders were a decent size with sweet grilled onions and a sauce on the patty. Dennis was our server and he did an excellent job and had good knowledge of the beer list as he offered me a Stone Brewing milk stout after I found out that they were tapped out of the Dragon's Milk. After we finished eating the apps and drinking a couple of beers each, our tab was sitting at $76. We didn't feel like going broke without even catching a buzz, so we passed on entrees and called it a night.

I don't doubt that the James Beard award-winning chef's food is delicious and I would come back to sample more but I would go with the game plan to not drink more than one beer. If I'm on the Strip and looking for an even larger beer selection with pints that are literally half the price, I'll head over to Yard House in the LINQ.",Jbd1x8jj3EgOkQMZ3RImKw,6,2,3,umFpYqzktBCmNRsMNKY1_Q

My bf got the grilled chicken sandwich, which had a big giant bun, and a small, flattened piece of flavorless chicken.  I originally ordered a chopped salmon salad, but when it came, no salmon, and the rest was wilted iceburg lettuce draped over the sides of a bowl with chopped tomatoes and cucumbers inside.  We also got some kettle chips and blue cheese type of appetizer that was inedible as well.

Would give four stars to our server.  I can't remember his name, but he was a trooper.  I saw another table complaining about their food as well, so i'm sure its not his first time.  He tried to accommodate us, but there was really nothing he could do.

5454213,2012-12-06,0,dn_ipqbm7_jUz5X3rDez_A,"Well this experience couldn't shake a stick to the last one...

We went to lunch here b/c we were wanted to shop at the largest Louis Vuitton in North America located in the Crystals Mall. It was this place or Wolf Gang Puck's in the center of Crystals.

My personal belief is anyone who eats here is either staying at Aria [very high end] or shopping at Crystals [extremely high end] b/c the restaurant sits right b/w the two locations and there's no real access from the street [so you have to be looking for it to find it]. Also, parking is very tricky, there's no lot close to it, so you are forced to walk through the mall or Aria to get to this location.

We walked in and it was freezing cold in here, like lower than 60 degrees b/c it was 60 outside and it was almost unbearable. [Strike 1]

Then we got accosted and I mean accosted by the horrible, terrible, kill your puppy and eat it, eh-music. It was like Deathstar meets headbanging and it was LOUD so very very LOUD, it hurt my ears, my little brain rattled in my own head.  I think maybe the Devil was speaking to me, but I'm not exactly sure. [Strike 2]

So we mentioned to our waiter, Eric, that the music was pretty bad and very loud. He completely agreed and proceeded to tell us it was the Chef's personal iPod playing. [Strike 3--what manager allows this to happen?] The music was so bad we started screaming to one another [b/c that's the only way you could hear each other] to name that tune...then Shazam came out!  Here's a selection of the music that was being played at a high end restaurant at 11:15 am -- Barracuda- Heart, I am the highway- Audioslave [wha wha who?], The Doors [can do!], and STP [Here I come a little much at 1130 am but will work over Marilyn Mansion ""we're all stars in the dope show""--not kidding!].  

Now, we were probably one of the only tables not dressed in business suits and not over the age of 40...I can assure you this cannot be the music that a business lunch wants to hear or even notice, b/c you could not NOT notice it.  Eric did get them to turn it down...which only alleviated the issue slightly. 

Onto the Food- 

--We ordered the pickle basket for $7, it was delicious, reminded me of something Carnegie gives you for *free* to start your meal...so keep that in mind.
--They also brought warm popcorn over which was tasty, so ask for that early, the bar [not our table] had peel and eat peanuts.  
--One lady in our party ordered the Caesar Salad, looked nice, too much dressing, priced at $17, which is a little steep for a salad at lunch. Thank God we got that awesome music!
--I ordered the lobster rolls, butter and Aioli on the side, priced at $24. In the Yelp pix these things look huge, in actuality they are about 1.5 inches long and maybe stuffed w/ 1-2 ozs of Lobster meat, thank baby Jesus for the Coleslaw and pickles or else I would've left hungry.  I would not order them again for a meal, maybe a starter if you had 3 people. They were appetizer size in my opinion. They came w/ kettle chips which I let others at the table eat. I also ripped some of the bread away from the sandwich b/c the ratio of bread to lobster was like 3:1.
--We also got the lamb carver sandwich with sourdough, horseradish sauce and black truffle mayo--excellent choice, probably the best choice at the table $18. Lamb was done perfectly, a little on the rare side, and was moist and flavorful.  Choices of sauces was excellent as well. It came with pickled cauliflower [gross], I think a better side choice is in order here.
--Our other co-worker, who is preggers, was dying for the foot-long hotdog priced at $16. She ate the whole thing and seemed to enjoy it. 

So in summation, would I go back, NO I'd try something else.",8QKrhvVqhEkD8xo4E4s0GQ,3,1,2,Geunkj4YBRqLI-0VurMmPA

It's, for all intent and purpose, food porn. We go on and on about how we ate here and what we had like we're bragging about our latest conquest in the bed room. 

""Oh man, you should have seen that plate, man. It was easily a 10 and I tore it a new one!"" Yes, you can pretty easily make smut novels if you replace whatever food items in a typical review with gender names and you have yourself a grocery store check-out romance novel with Fabio on the cover. 

So with that, let's talk Dirty.. Dirty Chips that is. These things.. Oh man, if I had a camera I would tell them nothing as they would already be making love to the camera. Any more dirty and this review would be X-rated. But let's go with trying to make the FCC blow up. 

Let's talk real dirty now.. I mean, how can you top this nasty-kitten! It's a huge pile of Kettle chips with bacon bits, scallions, blue cheese dressing and deep fried chicken liver pate. If your mouth isn't watering already, I would have to question your manhood. 

Then you can get really raw.. with their extensive raw bar, that is. Though let's be Frank (Sinatra) here. If you are in Vegas, there's a cheaper way to get Shrimp and Crab than getting it at an oyster bar. Stick to those and you should be fine.

So what about the lubricant of love, the back bone of any good pub, The beer? It was what I consider a pretty extensive list of beers on tap. Any place that has Fat Tire is a place I will eat in. But they went above and beyond. Blueberry beer. Yes, the Snozberries may taste like snozberries but I do love me the taste of Blueberries. This beer.. tasted like Blueberries. 

The whole joint looks like it could be in some old English novel as the town tavern, but with a slightly more updated way to dimly light an establishment. The bathroom is very dark. They really nailed the whole dingy pub look there better than, say, New York New York did with its squeaky clean NY City streets. 

Brick stones line the walls and create a look and along with the many hand crank beer handles on the walls and the ""flare"" of old taverns and pubs, this place has a look that just makes me want to drink some more and enjoy the sights. 

I didn't even touch on the burger. Now I'm not much of a turkey fan. Just doesn't have the same food porn feel, no matter how much you stuff it, that beef does. But the turkey burger with turkey bacon wrapped around it was something out of this world. Oh man, would I like to put that in my mouth over and over again.

Lobster rolls are a must have here.  They are so buttery and fresh.

The barreled beer is something to try if you never have.  Being from Portland and being an Oregon beer (Deshutes), I couldn't resist.   Warning, it comes warm and is a little bitter, but a good change if you enjoy the micros.  7 second beer drop and it's free, limit two.  Guy next to us dropped one and got it free, he wanted me to join in his second, but by no means am I a speed drinker, but he insisted and paid, but I only got through half.

I have no idea why yelpers loves this place, except probably they were too drunk from the PBR specials.  This has been on my ""bookmark"" list for awhile so after a show, my husband and I tried it for late night eats.

After 11:00pm they have a limited late night menu.  Which is fine, except the quality of the food and the level of service did not meet the outrageous prices they charged for them.  On top of it, it took almost an hour to bring out our food which was only four appetizers.  Our waiter was one of the most uncaring (as far as if we liked our food or not) and inattentive we have had so far.  The only thing we got fast from this server was the check, thank god.

This is what we ordered:

Spicy Crispy Chicken Wings - there was nothing crispy about these.  They were soaked in hot sauce that tasted bottled and instead of having the blue cheese dressing on the side it was all over the wings, which really upset me as I don't like blue cheese on wings, but I like it on the side to dip the veggies in.  I couldn't eat more than a few of these because they did not taste good, and they only came with six for 14.00.  When the waiter saw we didn't really touch the wings he didn't ask if they were ok, he just took them away and didn't seem to be concerned if we liked them.

Toasted Soft Pretzels - There was nothing toasted about these, they were just literally 4 pieces of cold pretzel bread.  It came with mustard, and my husband asked for a side of cheese and they charged extra for it.  They were not special and didn't warrant the $10 price.  They could have bought them from the grocery store a week earlier and we wouldn't have known the difference.

Caesar Salad - this was just a few whole pieces, not chopped of romaine lettuce.  Hidden underneath was a few croutons and some tomatoes.  It was like they were trying to deconstruct it but was not successful.  On top of it, it was over dressed with mediocre dressing, something I forgive when I'm paying normal prices, but unforgivable when the cost was $13.00 for such a small portion.

Chicken Parmesan Sliders - This was about $15.00 for three sliders that was smaller size than what you would get at the slider truck.  It was basically chicken nuggets with very little cheese and sauce on it, and was nothing remarkable to warrant the price and were a little dry.  However,  we found out it came with a side of fries, which was literally the only thing we liked about this meal.  They were wonderful.

All of this massively complicated food took an hour to bring out to us.  And if you're wondering, no it was not crowded there at all.

So we got the check and it was $90, both of us looked at it and just laughed hysterically for 5 minutes.  We paid the check, gave really little tip to the shitty waiter, and left.  Later, my husband got so mad over this meal he was fuming.  I've never seen him get so upset over a restaurant meal.

I will never ever ever go back here not even if you paid me to do it.  Todd English should be ashamed to  put his name on this place and have the gall to serve such mediocre food for such outrageous prices.

Arriving for a late lunch after a morning of walking around we were quickly greeted and seated outdoors. Our waitress, Lauren, was fantastic. She was friendly, knowledgeable about the menu and beer list and lots of fun.

The menu is pub fare but the upper end of the spectrum of pub fare. K was told that the tuna burger was life-changing, N got the lobster rolls, our friend got a salad and I went with the caprese salad. While lots of things sounded good it was kind of hot and I just wanted to have something cold and light. We ordered an order of sweet potato fries for the table and Lauren had some honey mustard mixed up for us (thanks!). 

We were blown away by the fantastic beer menu. Like wow. From favorites to things we can't get in Michigan but have wanted to try to things we've never heard of there was a vast selection that was organized beautifully on the back of our menu. 

Everyone loved their food and all but our friend who was working and our exchange student enjoyed two beers. 

The lobster rolls were voted best at the table and my caprese salad, while beautifully presented, came in last. The tomatoes just had no flavor. I'm not sure if it's not tomato season in Vegas or what but they were crazy bland. However, I can deal with such a little difference between best and worst when the best is so damn good (and had the toms been better my food would have been excellent).

The beer challenge is a lot of fun - you used to be able to select form any beer on the - very extensive menu - but now you are limited by price to only certain beers - and you have 7 seconds to down your pint.  If you succeed you get the beer for free (limit of two) if not, you have to pay for it.

I would recommend that you pick a less gassy beer (my favorite is Boddington's, very smooth).

As for the food, we have tried 5 or 6 of the entrees (as our last visit was in a large group) and it really wasn't that great - sometimes it has been the flavors, sometimes the ""secret"" ingredients that aren't listed on the menu but come as garnishes on the plate.

Their fries are pretty good (sweet, steak and frites) so I would say get a side of those.

The food prices are a few bucks more than I think are reasonable and on any future visits I think we will stick to just some drinks and eat elsewhere.

Good food. Great beer selection. Tons of TV to watch any games while you eat. However, prices will keep me from visiting this place too often in the future.

The environment is loud and fun. I really liked the place mats because they had quotes praising the awesomeness of alcohol. My favorite was by Frank Sinatra saying ""I feel sorry for people who don't drink. When they wake up in the morning, that's as good as they're going to feel all day."" 

Now the food. We came for happy hour, so the sliders and oysters are HH prices.

Sliders ($3) - The meat is cooked great, which is sometimes hit and miss when dealing with sliders. The buns are soft and buttery. Great slider, but 3 dollars is a steep price to pay for such a small thing.

Oysters ($2) - I was unimpressed with the oysters. They didn't taste fresh, and it felt really water-y. No brine-y or sweet burst of flavor. The cocktail sauce was good, but I think a good oyster needs to be able to stand on its own.

Lobster Roll ($24) - Soft, toasty and buttery texas toast. Succulent lobster meat. The lobster roll was fantastic. Again, the price is steep at $24, but of the three things I tried, the lobster roll was the most worth the price.

One thing that's happened every time I've walked in from Pocket Park, is this dialogue with the hostess were I basically have to spell out that I'm a diner, I would like a table for my party, and we want to EAT HERE. I don't usually walk into a restaurant to sight see. Please please, say hello, ask what I'm here for (a reservation accepted or to be made, or an inquiry about getting seated). DO say hello to patrons. DO NOT text, talk with waiters, then go back to your paperwork duties. It's a constant complaint that has been discused on many blogs, podcasts, and with my friends (3 tries) something's wrong there!  It's weird...I know

Anyway, expect even lesser service at the tables, you'll see some tables get pop corn, huge bread baskets, yours might even be one, but others will get just a quick pass from a waiter saying hello and then asking for an order. Then...prepare to wait. On all three ocassions I've waited at least 45 minutes for the entree. That's rediculous for a PUB. 

The food is okay, the mac and cheese is fine, the bangers and mash consists of bland potatoes and bland sausage, even by english pub standards. The fish and chips is outstanding. The beer selection amazing.

From looking at the only pic on yelp of the junk chips, my chips didn't really look like that.  The chips on the yelp pic looks even spread, but when my junk chips came out the BBQ ragu was only like at the bottom chips and the bleu cheese was uneven and then like a lump of  scallions on the very top chip.  As far as the flavors, the housemade chips were like thicker lays BBQ chips and I felt they were pretty salty and sweet which didn't compliment the overpowering flavors of the BBQ ragu and the bleu cheese.  I don't know.  Just not my favorite.

The fried pickles were good.  They were just thin/thick enough with a nice coating.  It came with 3 dipping sauces which were a housemade ketchup, sirracha ranch that was pretty spicy, and a bleu cheese dip.

We ended up trying the Junk Chips, Bologna Sandwich, and Lobster Rolls. The Junk Chips were fantastic...tasted like a Sloppy Joe on steroids, refusing to release its grasp of my fingers and stomach. The Bologna Sandwich wasn't really what I was expecting. Housemade meat was far from reminiscent of legendary bologna I've had in Louisville and Michigan. Too much bread and an unpleasant horseradish-mustard sauce really brought the sammie down. The Lobster Rolls were more than I expected. A stout amount of lobster was packed into the three rolls, making for a pretty filling dish. Flavorsome seasoning and sauce helped the rolls achieve solid heights. Definitely worth checking out for an original, jacked up approach to traditional pub fare, but the gouged food and drink prices, I'd hesitate to stop back unless I was on a serious heater.",li5pwULg5kwUf7CjN7uvCA,0,0,4,GoRBWetD19Xh2WQHb9IW2Q

The drink selections were great for both the beer drinker and the non-beer drinker, which is unusual for a pub. i was able to enjoy a lovely sparkling rose while my DH enjoyed some wonderful draught beer. 

 They also have some really cool tables with taps in the middle that it looks like you can use a credit card and serve yourself. That was awesome! The menu is also great!

The first day we just came for happy hour snacks. They have $1 wings, $2 oysters, and $3 sliders which is a great deal. The sliders were lacking a bit but the wings and additional onion rings that we ordered were great. 

Then we went for brunch which was the real treat. I ordered bagel TACOS which were so different and unique and sooooooo good! It was a bagel shell fried into the shape of a taco shell, but it was light and flaky at the same time. It was filled with sour cream, capers, and smoked salmon. Literally amazing. I also LOVED the fact that they had a bloody mary bar with custom bloodys, but they were a bit pricey for me to try ($17 for the drink with 5 mix-ins).

5915210,2013-08-11,1,dn_ipqbm7_jUz5X3rDez_A,"Man I had high hopes for this place...

Fundamental service issues plagued our visit. 

I made reservations and yet had to wait 10+ minutes before we could be seated. We were seated at the tables near the bar and I asked if we could be relocated to a booth however the hostess said that they were reserved... Funny, I could have sworn that I too made reservations. 
This is my pet peeve of restaurants. Why make reservations if you are made to wait and still get meh seats? 

The restaurant seemed to be terribly understaffed as our server was handling 10+ tables. It's not that I want to be waited on hand and foot but the average laps in time between service checks was no less than 10 min. 

Once we did manage to order our food, it did not take to long for it to come out. ALL of our food (appetizers & entrees) came out at once. Why is this a problem you ask? When you are serving items like their Junk Fries that have an extremely limited window of edibleness before it all turn into mush. So we found ourselves rushing to stuff our face before the chips became soggy while at the same time trying to enjoy our sandwiches. They must have messed up when the entered out ordered because the couple next to us had a similar order and their food came out in the normal staggered affair.  

On to the sandwiches. 

I had high hopes for the lobster roll and man did it let me down. First the lobster meat was warm. Not too sure if that was by design or not since 99.9% of everyone else serve it chilled. Secondly the claw meat was overcooked and rubbery. You could tell the  sauce thrown on the sandwich was literally thrown on the meat since one the rolls was smothered in sauce and the others has much, much less. Lastly the roll was half-assed. One side was nicely toasted and the other (cleverly put on the inside) was not (consult my pics if you don't believe me). Off night or careless preparation?!?


The $17 grilled cheese (Gricheactom)
It should be relabeled as a panini and NOT a grilled cheese. It was grilled on a press and lacked any of the toasty buttery goodness you would expect from a grilled cheese.  This is another dish that has a limited window of enjoy-ability. Giant pats of brie inconsistently loaded in the sandwich and gigantic tomato slices quickly turned this sandwich into a mess. as well.


Sorry Todd English, both of these creations missed the mark for me. 

Overall, there were too many basic restaurant 101 issues on our trip to overlook to validate anything higher than a 2* rating. 

Ending on a good note:They have a great beer selection and if you check in via mobile yelp they offer a free Bud Light.",E_Ts8j758tpiAZknHR7k4g,0,0,2,YkDDpZDxW6mZGbr19jloqw

So it's an English style pub this means one important aspect to start out with - beer!  I had the arrogant bastard ale, which for some reason I suspect may have been the wife telling me something subconsciously but it seemed to hit home. Very smooth and refreshing.  The beer was pretty good too!

The wife had a Bloody Mary chock full of add ons to ensure optimal obnoxiousness was achieved. Cheddar, shrimp, salami, pickled asparagus, old bay seasoning, Worstershire sauce, lime juice, spicy V8 all made full with tomato basil infused Vodka!  A drink as large as a five course meal, whatever next!  She loved it.

Well next in fact was the crispy beer battered pickles as an appetizer.  Appetizer?  This could be a whole meal for 2 on its own!  Great dips with this.  Awesomeness.

If you're wanting haute cuisine, it shouldn't be your destination point. But then again- if you're in Vegas and you're wanting haute cuisine and then decide to go to a place with the word ""PUB"" in it, then you're totally off the radar and need a tour guide or something. But I digress....

P.U.B is one of my total mainstays when I'm in Vegas. Now granted, I have somewhat of a blurred point of view regarding Vegas seeing as how  my family lives there and I'm there practically there half of my year, but I have to say- I rarely have found a place in Vegas where I crave a specific thing over and over again. And it has got to be the Dirty Chips at PUB. Think about how mind-blowingly amazing it must have been for Todd English to put THAT together. (b/w you and me, it HAD to have been after a night of him being stoned off his mind or something). House made kettle chips, blue cheese, cheese sauce, pancetta, green onions, and fried chicken livers- yes, you heard me correctly- fried chicken livers! It is like a stoner's fantasy. But even if you're not a chicken liver fan- the chips are to die for. I mean- I would actually kill for them right now! Really. No...really! 

Other than that, everything else I've had there has been delicious. The Pot Pie. The Shepherd's Pie. The Onion Rings. Now I didn't have that all in one sitting....what am I? A heifer? But the true nature of the PUB is the chill atmosphere and to top it off, and amazing selection of beers. I highly recommend sitting at the bar to eat and you can get some one-on-one edumacation about some of the beers and sometimes they serve limited quantity, hand-crafted beers, and you can sometimes ask to taste some. To top it off, they actually have a great wine selection too. For those non-beer drinkers who don't feel like being gassy.

The bloody Mary's were hit or miss, one person in our group loved it but I thought it was too thick. I would still recommend trying it out if your near the aria!",LkddtSdE6hf2E4cklFPBtw,0,0,3,QvBg-TPIUhSfGVQmdlXdNg

Came here for my final meal before my flight back home, and one person in our party was insistent on finding a place to eat that would allow her to watch her beloved Eagle's game so we walked around a while to find a place that fit both and could fit us in around the Aria (where we were staying), and Todd English P.U.B. was the perfect fit.  Despite a packed restaurant, we were cordially greeted by a nice hostess and were seated after a brief 10 minute wait.  Water came quickly to our table, however it took ages for our waitress to come to our table.  After she took 4 orders from our table, she walked away having being pulled away to take care of another table's check who had been waiting over 15 minutes to receive their bill so they could pay and leave.  So we ended up having to wait even longer for our food to be ordered.  When the waitress finally came back after waiting for another 20 minutes one person had a question about the brunch items on the menu (mind you we came in 1.5 hours before brunch ended on Sundays) and our waitress again stopped taking orders and walked away as she didn't know the time and how late brunch wasn't offered (hello it's on the menu... we had cell phones and watches to give you the time).

Finally our waitress came back and we were able to get our orders in (and we made the brunch window) and a few of us had fun customizing our bloody marys.  The waitress who took our order for the bloody marys was super helpful, she guided us through everything and answered the ton of questions we had.

Luckily, the time for our food to arrived was minimal.  I ordered the lobster eggs benedict and it was super delicious and beyond stuffing.  My bloody mary was amazing!  I normally am not a huge fan of bloody mary's, but I'm glad I reserved judgement and tried it out.

So for anyone who wants a place with casual dining and great food I would highly recommend it!",RL1QQZ0EhFnvOQVTeT0wHg,0,0,4,xugOBrWrmwMTUhwKnf01wg
5950535,2012-06-12,0,dn_ipqbm7_jUz5X3rDez_A,"My friends and I got a little bored with the food options while staying at Aria and decided to venture out.  I wanted to find a place that was relatively pretty close and not too pricey.  We checked on Yelp and saw that Todd English Pub fit what we were looking for, so decided to give it a shot.

Arrived at the restaurant and who knew but Todd English himself was actually in the kitchen cooking and filming that night!  How exciting...so Todd himself actually prepared our food, or at least appeared to. 

We started with the oysters.  Thy Oysters were all from the Northeast and were a very good quality for the price. Also ordered the dirty chips which were a huge appetizer and very tasty.  It was the perfect blend of cheeses and tomatoes only complaint was that the beef was a little overcooked and dry. I was tickled pink to see they offered mini corn dogs bites so I ordered a side of them.  They were fantastic...however they came with way too many fries , and not enough corn dog bites.  The order only came with 6 or so mini bites and I probably couldve eatten at least twice that (come on people they were bite size!)

For our mains, we ordered the Chicken Parm sliders.  These were a little dry but still very good.  The lobster salad roll sliders (very very tasty, also a little dry) and the Grilled Cheese.  The Grilled cheese was way too rich, we couldn't eat more than a few bites a piece. Sure glad the 3 of us ordered and shared. 

We finished with the bread pudding which was excellent way to filling.  

Bottom line- we were absolutely thrilled Todd English himself appeared to have made our food, however the food wasn't all that great. It was really cool to be part of the filming experience but everything was way overcooked and far to filling. I would definitely give this place a second shot because the menu selections are fantastic , and perhaps it was just an off night.  Maybe Todd was nervose from being filmed?",g3ZAeoDXrOll7w1_YnaJbA,1,0,3,pbEcA3-u2eZK5scwQ759RA

$1 wings - pass on these, they're not very good.
$20 = flight of beer and sliders
4x 5oz flight - excellent! Beers are high quality and the four in our flight were not even listed in our extensive menu.
and 3 sliders = cheesesteak, asian slaw + salmon, turkey; all were excellent and very filling together. 

Service was just OK; we felt neglected and it took a long time for our food come out. However, it was very busy for a weekday afternoon, and the complimentary gorgonzola popcorn at the beginning kept us occupied while we waited for a server.",7Xpb51viDdOaV_89olxp5w,0,0,4,KA2NRIKpiefLiZJIxcsgug

I had the lobster tacos & some oysters during this visit. The tacos were OK, next time I'd get something different, but the oysters were fresh & were really great. Our server was super nice & we had a great time for our ""last supper"" in Vegas.",PlXQJMhZzXwAoNnp99YDUg,0,0,4,l-wnrkY1C9YLZxckOO_x2A

So I have seen, wined, dined, swam, raved, raged, raved, and raged etc... pretty much most places worth going to.  I have always thoroughly enjoyed Todd English P.U.B. conveniently located by the lobby of Aria.  This spot has been, the new up and coming place, and has flourished ever since.

Great place to come and grab some nice bar bites and as always a great selection of alcohol.  They have a very unique and special brew menu to choose from with beers coming from all corners of the world.  AAAAND wooow... their Bloody Marry's.... over the top crazy!  Very nice and original house mix... but their fixin's.... is literally like a bouquet of goodies overflowing from the top of your glass.  There is literally like a full meal of food dressing your glass, from chicken wings, to cold cuts, to shirmp, and even a crab leg, all blossoming out of your bloody marry.  Of course you can make it to your customized liking.  I think it was a bit too busy for me, so I will stick to the basics next time... but it was OH SO GOOD! :P

I always always ALLLWAYS bring the crew here for the seven second beer chug challenge!  It's a really fun way to get the party started during the day while hanging out and munching on some good eats.  You basically choose a premium $9 beer, and you have to chug a pint of it in 7 seconds and its $FREE.99 :P  You can do it twice.  Awesome way to get a free buzz going!  Of course please do tip your bar tender well!  The 7 second chug is quite doo-able, but if you need something easier to complete this challenge, try the Irish Creme beer they have, it is less carbonated and goes down way smoother.  Usually they don't let you, but if you rub the bar tender the right way, and you feel like a champ, try to do the 7sec chug with a nice dark stout and you will be good for a while.  Tried it a couple times and... yea... it unleashed the beast! :P

Finally.. on to the food... Yummmzzz!  Very tasty and creative.  We always get the Junk Chips to munch on and soak up the alchy.  It is pretty tasty with fresh cut and fried housemade chips loaded with bbq pulled beef, loaded with a house aioli and all the nacho type fixin's.  It is like a classy... nacho... on roids.  Their main dishes and entrees are very good as well.  They have a super wide array of eats from fresh salads, to lobster rolls, to fancy burgers, to a raw seafood bar, and grade A protein, there will be something to fancy your appetite!

Great upscale bar like atmosphere accompanied with friendly and welcoming service.  Not the cheapest place on the block to grab a bite and drinks, but heck, you're in Vegas... you didn't come here to save money. ;P  I will always pay a visit when I am in town!",o_3DTkG2j17gysTSDK6iBg,5,4,5,XYb5m0cKv7n88PHcwY8ZFA

we saw the ""$3.00 Beer!"" sign at this pub and decided that sounded great.. We waited for about 10 mins to be seated..even though it wasn't even that crowded..

our server decided to come to our table after 3 more people had already come and did stuff.. I kinda wish the bus boys would have been our server instead because this girl was awful. I get that sometimes you really don't give a s**t about your customers sometimes, as a server (I was a server for several years) but at least PRETEND. Put on that fake smile. 

This girl didnt even care that she made it completely obvious that she didn't care about us.. She clearly cared more about the 10-top full of males who would tip her based on the fact that she was a remotely attractive female..

  After sitting there for 20 mins, we were finally asked if we'd like drinks.. we excitedly asked about the $3 beer.. ""oh.. we're actually out of that"" and she didn't really give us any other options..

thankfully YELP! Actually had a ""free pint beer"" check-in offer. but it was of BUD which I HATE..but oh well.

my $12.00 hot wings were the quality of Buffalo Wild Wings.. which I could have gotten for about half of what I paid for these.. don't get me wrong.. I LOVE Buffalo Wild Wings.. but if I'm paying that much for 6 hot wings.. they better be the best wings I've ever had.. which they weren't.. .. at all.
  My friend ordered a $20 Burger with Bacon.. it came without the bacon.. which she had to mention.. it also came Bleeding.. and she's ordered it medium
well...

My other friends' portobello mushroom burger, on the other hand, was completely over-cooked. It looked like a burnt piece of cardboard.

We asked her to box our leftovers.. She proceeded to throw them all in ONE bag....
   I specifically said ""can you keep the blue cheese with my wings , please?"" no blue cheese was in my to/go box.

  by far the worst eating experience I've had in Vegas.. I'll be going to that burger place at the Aria next time.. with the brisket bloody mary's and burgers that are worth the high-prices.

The only complaint I have is the hostess service. When I arrived I was looking into the restaurant for the rest of my party and they did not offer to help or see if they were there. I ended up waiting outside and then calling my party to find they were already seated. This one of my biggest pet peeves with restaurants.

The whole menu looked pretty good, but since we had late dinner plans I limited myself to only things on the happy hour menu. The sliders and oysters were the most impressive: the oysters were fresh and served with several sauces and the sliders tasted much better than your average run of the mill hamburger. The wings were pretty disappointing, very little meat and a buffalo sauce that could have easily come out of a jar. Especially at $1 each, you can definitely do much better for wings elsewhere so it's probably a good idea to avoid those altogether.

The beer selection is HUGE but slightly pricey without the happy hour discount ($10-14). Make sure to pick something that you haven't tried before. Ask your waiter for help if you need it.

If you're into chugging, make sure to go to the bar for the 7 second challenge. If you can chug a beer in under 7 seconds, they'll ring a bell for all to hear and your beer is on the house.",HMXi4ySve0_SNvLxwz1Vfg,0,0,4,9YZYC6ylLCPYqVBfj9vr1A

Parking: 

There is always parking at the various self parking lots at Aria or Monte Carlo. 

Establishment: 

Decor was pretty standard for a bar. Service was a pretty slow. My favorite were the quotes on the place mat such as ""I feel sorry for people who don't drink. When they wake up in the morning, that's as good as they're going to feel all day. -Frank Sinatra. *2 stars*

Food:

Was there for Happy Hour and had the chicken wings which I consider just buffalo wings for $1 each nothing special but I hate when places serve chicken wings covered in buffalo sauce. Just call them buffalo wings please. *3 stars*

Also the beer was worth the money during happy hour since it was half off pints and wine glasses. They have a very extensive beer list for whatever you desire. I had Oskar Blues Dale's Pale which was enjoyable. You could get a cheap beer like PBR or Bud Light for $4-$5. *5 stars*

Had the Roasted Chicken Pot Pie what made it stand out was instead of using a flaky pie crust they used a huge cheddar biscuit which was good because it soaked up the veloute but unfortunately the meal was just that a biscuit soaked in veloute with very little chicken and vegetables and for $19. *2 stars*

Overall:

I feel the price point for this place is rather high for the food. Yes the portions are appropriately sized but I feel there was a lack of content. May give it another try just because there was a 7 second chug challenge at the bar which sounds interesting.",nWS4xS4lAfi9xeW8uABx8g,1,0,2,OUHfxn72-53vmnJZh0MecQ
