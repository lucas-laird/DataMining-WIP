591983,2010-06-30,0,q7iF6omNtpaeBXZscLuBxQ,Vegas is good food at a good price. Everything is made fresh and the food is not greasy or heavy at all. The chile relleno is one of my favorites. My only complaint is that they dont have any pork dishes. They have a great breakfast menu that they serve all day. And the apple burrito is pretty good.,DJuCp6NVHAmfolqDAsSQpQ,1,1,4,U_d4xlgokV3h-9FoD3JY6w
793031,2010-01-10,0,q7iF6omNtpaeBXZscLuBxQ,"The previous reviewer (Marianne) must have gone on a bad day. We just ate there two days ago and LOVED it!. The service was great and we only waited about 10 minutes for our entrees. Besides, we were eating there great chips and salsa in the mean time. 

We ordered the bean dip to go with the chips. It was wonderful. Loaded with beans and cheese, it actually stretched like pizza when you pulled the chip out. Sooo good. I ordered the Carne Asada and my wife had the Chili Verde. The beef was very tender and flavorful and the rice and beans was better than most Mexican restaurants I've been to. Everything tasted great and we will definitely be back. 

If there is a down side to Vega's, it would be the smaller menu than most. We didn't see any pork dishes (everything was beef or chicken) and their seafood selection was small. They also use the same menu for lunch and dinner, so you don't get a cheaper meal at lunch. But these are minor issues for such a high quality and wonderful meal.",QSZtKypie1BdoWRJ6wpMOA,1,0,5,o9dPbgd0LlxsNE9YJmiFdQ

We have been there a few times and enjoy it, although we have not had many entrees there, what we have had has been enjoyable!  Best way to describe this style of Mexican is probably to say the food is ""like a good home cooked meal"".   Sometimes I worry about certain places based on location and this is definitely one of them.  If you don't know the area well it can be hard to find.  I believe if they had a better location, closer to town, they would probably be more successful.  The northwest is slowly dying due to the foreclosure crisis sweeping through all of Vegas.  But i think its worth a try if you are in the area and craving some Mexican food!!!",n6WDNm9c0kCoPu794hvC8A,1,1,4,fIWU71QbXgoEDvG8NQ8nyQ

4464888,2008-06-02,0,q7iF6omNtpaeBXZscLuBxQ,"When I first moved to Las Vegas in 1984 a friend of mine took me to Vega's Cafe. I fell in love with the tiny little restaurant right away. I took my wife there on our first date in 1985. We would eat there often until they dissappeared in the early 90's.

They are now back with there wonderful tasty food and friendly atmosphere. I could not be happier.",DnpdvjQBhxtuU0Wns23k4A,0,0,5,ZhnPTwCu2USR2dNlwdNadw
4484306,2010-03-27,0,q7iF6omNtpaeBXZscLuBxQ,"A few weeks ago my husband and I happened to be in the Northwest so we had the perfect excuse to drop into Vega's Cafe, a restaurant my family has been eating at since I was a little girl. The location has changed a couple of times, and although it is now a lot further from us than it ever has been, the new spot is definitely an improvement upon the previous two. Well, at least the last location. I'll always remember the dimmed lights, big red booths and glass blower tucked in the corner of the second dining room at the first place on Charleston. I am really glad they have moved from their seedier early locations, however, to one that is more welcoming to those who don't already know how good the food is.

The restaurant is run by Ernie, who does the serving, and his wife Celia, who does all the cooking. She makes the best flour tortillas in Vegas and is also known for her famous chile rellenos, which she makes using pasilla peppers rather than the more common anaheim chiles. She covers it in a delicous white sauce that is from an old family recipe she won't share. After making the same food for thirty years you would expect it to be something special, and it is. I often get the chile verde bowl with tender chicken but today we shared another favorite, the machaca burrito enchilada style ($9.75). This is made wrapping machaca, or shredded beef and eggs, in one of her home-made tortillas which is then baked with enchilada sauce and gooey cheese and accompanied by fluffy rice and smooth refried beans. You really don't need to add much to one of her tortillas, and it almost seems like a shame to add so many other delicious components, but the fantastic flavor is still able to come through. Everything about it just works.

To top it off, each dish always tastes exactly the same, which is no easy feat for a non-chain restaurant. No matter how many times they've moved, the food hasn't changed one bit with the passing of time. This is comfort Mexican food that is done well, and I strongly recommend you try it, even if it is a little out of the way for most of the Valley's residents.

Tip: On Monday, Wednesday, and Friday the soup of the day is fideo, or noodle soup, and on Tuesday and Thursday it's albondigas, or meatball. I prefer the albondigas because the noodles in the fideo get mushy. Also, don't come here on a diet, but if you do, get the chicken chile verde bowl which is like spicy Mexican chicken soup. Yum!",RiU99Ze8UEoUutHMl73HIg,0,0,4,tG_-HSiAv9hWyZcxQDTPSw
4643607,2010-08-19,0,q7iF6omNtpaeBXZscLuBxQ,Pretty average. Friendly service. Nothing out of the ordinary. Pretty basic Mexican cuisine. Great in a pinch or for a neighborhood meal.,uzReH7zIh5tJX9ICBgTwNQ,0,0,3,fOBO2Z4VFp5-ZpfRuoADFQ
5049578,2010-07-05,1,q7iF6omNtpaeBXZscLuBxQ,"This place seemed homey from the get go. Yelpalicious Angela H. and I thought the place was cute and inviting. The server was very sweet and showed us some articles about them and pointed out some of their popular star items. 

I got myself a favorite- Enchilada Ranchera which is enchilada with green sauce and sourcream and I chose it with chicken. I am not too fond of beans so I opted for all rice. She said it's a bit spicy, but it the green sauce only had a whisper of spice which added a depth but didn't burn your tongue that you cant taste anything else. I liked my entree and rice and for $7.75 it could not be beat. 

She was saying that their chile relleno is one of their best known dishes. I love me that dish, but it's one of those things I have to be in the mood for. Yes, I am not Mexican, but my step grandma is and when she was alive she would make me chile relleno and pork  with some chipotle mocahete sauce everytime I'd come. Very few places tops that memory, but I will come back to try out the star dish as well as their bistek ranchero for sure. 

We met the owner as we were walking out and he seemed like a very nice guy who seemed very fond and proud of his place. I like humble homey places and will be looking to sample through everything.",n86B7IkbU20AkxlFX_5aew,2,2,4,HY5IQUqyanNp3p9WYvZXKA
5600041,2010-04-16,0,q7iF6omNtpaeBXZscLuBxQ,"Nice place inside and good service...

I scanned the menu and I was confused - the prices were way out of wack compared to other mexican places.  Beans and rice were alacarte???  I think they wanted $3 extra for beans and rice.  

I ordered the chile rellano and one rellano was $8 alone on a small plate and it was just ok.  A friend ordered a chicken tostada at $8 and some change.  It was ok but barely enough to feed a 3 year old.

There flour tortillas were made with canola oil.  Good if you are on a diet bad if you are in the mood if you want good mexican food.

You cannot call this place authentic simply based on the tortillas.  

I had high hopes but this place fell short - maybe I will go back for second chance...maybe",L15JCA18Ib_vMUVJILxiSw,1,1,2,2xGLKIQ-B-WbFfgfMFJcdg

Pros= home made tortillas, yummy beans and salsa and the sweet servers!
Cons=closed on Sunday, dinner salad is just shredded iceberg lettuce like what you would top tacos with, fried ice cream bland and blah.",dFOKDTKdZLZMSqPSr-_NkQ,0,0,4,ntHPGzDKnEe-9wghM8GiGg
