452693,2013-06-01,3,RkOguMKU13hPglELb6t2Vg,"This is a Gordon's Hell Kitchen experience.  

I came out of this place felt like I was robbed. For over $40 USD per head, we had less than average food (with no favors) and clueless service (they at least got the bill right, though).

If you don't believe what I am about to say, just go there and see that the restaurant is 95% empty for dinner, and, even better, go in and have dinner and experience it yourself (be sure to share =)). 

We made a reservation for dinner on a Saturday of May 2013, thinking the restaurant will be crowded because its Vegas. We checked out the menu before hand, and saw that they have fairly expensive offering - main courses for $25+, vegetarian dishes for $15+, so we had reasonable expectations of a decent meal.  

When we arrived at 6:30pm, we see that the restaurant is basically empty. There's only one other table. I felt something was wrong, but then I thought may be it's too early for Vegas and people are not coming in yet (I was wrong!).

I was debating the Okra vs. Veg. Biryani, so I asked the waitress what kind of vegetables they have in the Biryani. She said ""peas"". So, rice and peas for $19.00? What? Is that even a meal? OK, so we ordered the Paneer for Appetizer, Okra and Lamb Curry as main courses, and Nan and rice (which is also rice and peas, but for $9.00).

The paneer came, and I know we shouldn't have come. It was basically dry and have very little favor. It tasted more like paper than cheese. When the waitress came with our main course, she blatantly commented that she has no idea who ordered which dish (there were only 3 tables!).  Well, you could have handled that by saying ""Lamb?"". Obviously its her first day. Though I have to admit she doesn't have many customers to practice her skills.

The Okra was extremely sour. I tried very hard to eat as much as I can as we don't have time for another meal due to a scheduled evening show. I think I ate may be 1/3 of the Okra. It was so sour and dry that I can't figure out whether they are rotten for months or someone had washed their feet with the Okra. Then, I tried some of the Lamb Curry from my wife's dish. The meat tasted more like goo, and the source is more like a puree than a curry, it's just the wrong thing. And, for $26 USD you get a small bowl may be 10cm in diameter (not that we would want any more than what we got). The rice was below average (couldn't taste too much of it because of the sour Okra). The Nan was OK, and its the only thing they didn't mess up.

In the middle of dinner, another waitress came by with beer and asked if we had ordered beer. We did not - there are like three tables at that time, how can you possibly mess that up? Getting the check was really slow too, but I don't care too much about that. 

The final bill + tips was over $80.00, which is the most expensive meal we had in Vegas until that point, and the worst we've had in many years. It's simply worse than some of the very average Indian cuisine you can find in California. (We had a $130+ meal the next day at the Eiffel Tower Restaurant which is reasonably worth it).

Finally, I have to say this place fits exactly into the definition of Gordon Ramsey's Hell's Kitchen - highly over priced, clueless front of house, food lack of favor, and above all, no customers and hemorrhaging cash. If they don't get a major Ramsey make over, these guys are just going to continue to burn money and close up.  

Don't go here!

Let me first off tell you how excited i was to find a nice sit down indian restaurant. I had never had indian food before and decided to give this place a try and let me tell you how happy i am that i did.

I walked into the restaurant to see such amazing decor (the two large wooden elephants are breathtaking) and a fully stocked bar. I was immediately escorted to my table ( which was extra comfy) and my server came with a basket of  Lentil flour cakes ( which were DELICIOUS!) and cup of water.  I met my waiter Daman who was very easy to talk to and really helpful and patient when he was explaining to me the different dishes they had. I was a bit  lost since i do not normally choose indian cuisine so i let him decide what dishes i should get. And i am so thankful that i did.

 He recommended i get the Samosa chat as an appetizer , which was this crunchy potato filled dish paired with a tamarind sauce and mint sauce and some yogurt.

 For the main course he recommended i get the Chilean sea bass tandoor ( which melted in my mouth literally ) and the lamb chop masala .The spice level was on point and glad i took his recommendation of ordering rice and naan with the order. 

I dont understand why this place has so many low ratings i mean every restaurant i have been to in vegas is as expensive if not more than the price i paid at royal india. The food, the service, the quality is well worth the price i paid.

695458,2016-03-08,1,RkOguMKU13hPglELb6t2Vg,"So disappointed with last nights experience at Royal India Bistro!
I had been wanting to try this place, so last night I finally had the chance. 

We ordered a bottle of Fess Parkers Pinot Noir 2012 ($60), Tandori Chicken $13 and chicken kabob I think also $13 . The kabob was inedible,  (dry, hard and tasteless), so we told the waiter. Another gentleman comes out (presumably the mgr) and apologized and asked if we wanted to try something else. He suggested the garlic chicken, which we agreed to. Unfortunately that to was inedible, so we just shared the Tandori chicken, finished the bottle of wine, then decided to order 2 more glasses of the same Fess Parker Pinot Noir. However,  when we got the 2 glasses of wine, it wasnt the fess parker Pinot, so we see the bartender and tell her it isnt the same wine.. She says yes it is, goes to the bar and comes back with a bottle of the FP Pinot and said she had just opened it and poured our two glasses from it.. Interestingly, she is tilting the bottle back presenting it to us, and I ask her to set the bottle on the table. When she does, you can see the bottle is almost completely full. We tell her there is no way that she had just opened and served 2 glasses of wine from that bottle, but she insisted it was, but said she would repour, grabs the bottle off the table and takes our 2 glasses of wine with her.. Im not feeling to great about things at this point, so I get up and follow her to the bar, where the manager is. I tell him the story and tell him if she really had just opened that bottle and poured those 2 glasses of wine, try pouring them back into the bottle... (he wouldnt because it was obvious that not even a full glass had been poured from that bottle). I then tell him that we know Fess Parker Pinot Noir because I used to work for Fess Parker and every Thursday, we would have a sing along at his Wine Country Inn, and all we drank was his FP Pinot, so.. I definitely know his wine..and what she served was not the wine we ordered. (at $16 a glass, we better get what we pay for!)

 Im mad at this point for being cheated and walk back to the table. the mgr then brings 2 new glasses and sets the bottle down and apologized and said enjoy. (and yes, that wine was the real Fess Parker Pinot). We then ask for the check and see that we were given a $14 discount for our trouble, but, we had been charged for the ""apology"" wine ($32), as well  the replacement dish of garlic chicken ($20)  (that the manger recommended but we never ate because that too was inedible!) I call the Mgr over and tell him there is no way we are paying for horrid food and, asked why he charged us for the wine after all that... welll. he eventually took off the wine and the chicken, but.. I must say..HORRIBLE HORRIBLE Experience and food... Beware what you order.. you may not be gettin what you pay for.. !",OFxEHOl6EluGHiD9UfEicA,3,0,1,Y3fdjsQjYWTQYAPobbxmcQ

Royal at the Rio hotel is located on an obscure corner of the casino, so just keep asking around, and I'm sure you will find it. Once you do, you will notice that this is a really impressive looking Indian restaurant. High ceilings, great decor, the whole shebangabang. After sitting down, I ordered my food, and waited.

Shortly after ordering, I was given a complimentary papadum, a sort of cracker that was made from chickpea flour, with a couple of dipping sauces. This was nice, as I never had this before, and quite nice. I liked the tamarind dipping sauce, but didn't care too much for the green mint one.

The Vegetarian Thali platter then came out. It was basically a sampling of some of their vegetarian dishes, a side of rice, dessert, and a naan, cut into quarters. When reading the menu, it sounds like more than what actually comes out. The naan was really good, and I do like my naan a little bit more on the ""toastier"" side. The flavors, I think, were all there, but I would consider it to be a more conservative approach to Indian food. And that is understandable considering that they cater to a lot of people from all over the world. But, at $30 for a plate of vegetarian food... there can be better value located elsewhere on the menu. The table next to me ordered the Royal Surf and Turf, and after seeing that, I should have paid the extra $2 instead.

The service here was on point. The hostess was friendly and helped me with a lot of my questions. The server was good at anticipating my needs. 

If you are craving some Indian food, and don't have a car rental, and don't know anyone in Vegas who can drive you around, and stay at the Rio.. well, you have Royal. Your paying casino prices for the food, but that is to be expected.",gtwM4ijo65AN4DvXdgCu_w,25,19,3,pKToagmmdD_a8nfOmPTUjA

1450416,2017-04-04,0,RkOguMKU13hPglELb6t2Vg,"Royal Indian Bistro is located within Rio All Suites Hotel & Casino, just west of ""the Strip"" in southern Las Vegas.  I had the pleasure of enjoying some chicken tikka masala for dinner during a recent trip for a convention.

The restaurant is clean, the service is attentive, and the food is quite good.  Like most Indian cuisine establishments, you can select your level of spice.  I asked for a ""shade"" under ""medium.""  The dish was very flavorful, but I probably could have tolerated a shade above medium.  Every chef is different, so I usually ask for just under a medium spice level when testing an Indian or Thai restaurant that is new to me.

The chicken was perfectly done, and very tender.  The tikka masala sauce had great consistency and flavor - not too creamy, as it sometimes can be encountered.  The Basmati rice was perfectly cooked, and had some fresh peas atop, but lacked diced carrot.  The buttered naan was good, and not overly done, as I've found some places leave it on one side a tad too long, and it gets burnt - I didn't experience that here.

I had bottled water with my meal, which was a bit pricey; but food in Las Vegas isn't cheap anymore if you're on or anywhere close to the strip.  

Everything at this restaurant is a la carte.  With tip, my meal was a tad over $40.

We had been there twice before for dinner when it was Gaylord and both experiences were quite similar; nice ambiance, good, but overpriced food, lousy service.  So I was excited they were back (same owners, new name) and could do a major affordable chow down and not have to worry about the service because it was a buffet.  Really, what could possibly go wrong?

So there we are-nobody to seat us-so I poke my head into the dining area and someone comes and ushers us to a table in a near empty room.  I look around; WOW design fallout!  The Gaylord to India Bistro remodel is more of a demodel. What was once a rather upscale and attractively appointed space has been dehabbed with cheesy booths and a tacky over bright chandelier. Oh well, moving on...

The buffet consisted of: 

Dal Maharani,  Baingan Pakoras (eggplant), Aloo Baingan (think it was potato and eggplant), Palak Paneer,  Basmati Rice, Tandoori Chicken, Chicken Tikka Masala, Chicken Curry, and some expired salad.

A little heavy on the chicken and eggplant, but I was still OK with that...until I discovered that every chicken dish was a contender for the food despair jackpot.  The one commonality they all shared was their Styrofoam taste and consistency.  It was the worst rice I have ever had and we debated if it was old or undercooked, settling on the notion that it was probably both.  Everything else pretty much sucked as well.  There are people starving in (fill in the blank) and they would probably choose hunger over that buffet.

1588531,2015-06-09,4,RkOguMKU13hPglELb6t2Vg,"We went to the Royal as a special Mother's Day treat for dinner around 7pm.  The reason I waited several weeks to write this review is because I wanted to try out a couple more India restaurants and see if the food and service was average or above par for Las Vegas India restaurants.  I'm sorry to say it was below par, so believe the reviews that you read about it.

Ambiance:  The restaurant was beautiful inside and out.  The tables looked nice but the booth seats felt old.  It is set up to look like an upper scale quality restaurant, I'm guessing in order to justify the pricing.

Service:  The service was adequate but the food came out backwards.  Our soup and bread basket came last, about 15 minutes after the food, and food was served after thirty minutes, lukewarm not hot.  The bartender/hostess was also very pushy about alcoholic drinks.  We were asked no less than five times if we wanted an alcoholic beverage.  We told them repeatedly that I was diabetic so NO, and my son was driving so NO.

Food:  We ordered sparkling water, flavored ice tea and water for beverages.  We ordered Chicken Lemon Soup ($8) which was delicious but served barely warm.  We also had a Bread Basket ($12) which was served last after we had almost finished eating.  I ordered the Lamb Chop Marsala ($30) and my son ordered the Prawn Vindaloo ($27).  My Lamb Chops were very small, very few and almost cold.  Not enough for one person let alone sharing with two.  They had little to no flavor and were served first, so I was the only one with food in front of me for about 10 minutes.  I shared my dish with my son.  Then his Prawns came out.  There were about 8-10 large size prawns so this was a pretty good serving.  We shared this dish also.  The Prawns were delicious but also served barely warm.  The entire dinner was priced at $109 for two people and definitely was not worth it.

I didn't complain because this was only my second visit to an Indian restaurant.  I thought perhaps that was the way Indian food is served - barely warmed.  My son, who is an Indian food fan, said afterwards that the food should be hot and flavorful.  We received neither for this dinner.  To be fair, we only ate here once and only had a couple of dishes so maybe their other servings are better.  But we'll never find out because we will not be back.",jvmB9pym9-VVf-TBOUMGeg,3,1,2,BM75racYWvUbaOMqcAsOug

After eating horrible food for the past few days, the worst Chinese food in my life, it was a pleasant surprise to have this in Las Vegas. Better than all the Indian restaurants I had in NYC (even the silly Michelin starred ones) 

The only qualm is that the rice is $9 dollars on top and that's a little bit pricy for rice. But it was still overall reasonable in price for the best Indian food I have ever had. That is saying a lot considering I am a big fan of Tikka Masala. 

We had the butter masala I believe. Too bad they don't have an outpost of this in NYC...

The service is a little bit slow but I find that to be the case for almost all the Las Vegas restaurants I have been to so far. It is faster for Las Vegas pace I guess but snails pace for NYC. If I was in NYC I would knock off a star but since it's Las Vegas and the past two restaurants that we went to and reviewed were literally people that must have fallen asleep while working, I will let that go.

Service.  The initial service left a lot to be desired.  Despite the restaurant being mostly empty, it took over 10 minutes to get water, and at least 5 minutes for our waiter to stop by once.  He did apologize because he had many tables in the back, which helped. The food also came quickly and the waiter was more attentive, so things even out a bit.

Main Dishes.  I had the butter chicken, and my wife the baingan bharta.

The butter chicken had a nice flavor, although perhaps was a bit light on the chicken.  A worthwhile dish, overall. I can see why it was a chef special.  

The eggplant also sat nicely on the taste buds, although it was overly oily, and spicier than advertised.  I would have called it medium rather than mild.  

The breads were mediocre.  The naan was fine, bit the onion kulcha was underbaked, and the onions inside were again a bit too oily.",yM_n-JlaoHUpkDrUV0-IAQ,0,0,3,RYO7jBwAz3Qe97DhVy7Wsw

First, the selection is pretty meager.  When I see ~6 entrees at an Indian buffet, I assume they're going to be delicious, because the restaurant must make those particular dishes really well, right?  Right?  Unfortunately, that is not what's going on here.

A few of them (chicken tikka masala, baingan bhartha, dal makhani) were fine.  Nothing outstanding, but they could make a solid meal.  If I'd just stuck to those three and ignored everything else, this review would be at least a star higher.  But they did two things so badly that it just killed the experience for me.

They had tandoori chicken wings that were warm, soggy, and bland.  I couldn't finish one wing.

Their pakoras... how do I even begin?  Here's the process that I can only assume they must have followed:

Step 1: Make hot, fresh, crispy, delicious pakoras.
Step 2: Put under a heat lamp for three days, and serve.

The place is very clean, service is attentive, and I would take the chance to eat there at any time I could. I cannot recommend this place enough!",_EAIZdJH-cE8X7nOfRY18g,2,2,5,pEaJfJonGiWCL2kCaYJXEA
2576736,2015-11-08,8,RkOguMKU13hPglELb6t2Vg,"We had lunch here after checking out of a Rio staycation. They had just opened for the day, it is a very pretty restaurant. The hostess greeted and seated us in a booth, took our drink orders, and asked if we were doing buffet: I auto-replied ""NO!"" (well documented case of buffet-itis, here ;) 

But, since my dining companion was going out of his culinary comfort zone to try Indian cuisine, I went and looked at the offerings and figured the buffet would be the best way for him to experience various dishes. I quickly changed my ""just ice water"" to ""Pinot Grigio, please!"" and we went for round one at the just-opened-for-the-day buffet. (somehow this alleviated a bit of my usual germophobe fears) 

There was a basket of fresh, hot naan at our table when we sat down. Honestly I'm not sure if this was a large or small offering, but there were a variety of dishes: samosas, pakoras, daal, chicken tandoori, chicken tikka masala, cauliflower, saag paneer, curry, basmati rice, and more. We both thoroughly enjoyed our selections. The tasty naan was perfect for sopping up sauces, and was replaced without asking, water glasses were refilled without prompting, too. 

He went for a huge round two, while I was kind of full. The only lackluster part was dessert: I found the carrot pudding too sweet and dry, the rice pudding was A-Ok. 

Another 3.5* experience, service was 4*. I'd absolutely go back for a la carte dinner when in town again.",eZfHm0qI8A_HfvXScwIYsg,11,4,3,iansXs8vgEluGcxmyvVmjg

I decided to ignore the reviews because people have such different opinions and it was also recommended by one of the chef's at my school. 

I have eaten at many Indian places and I must say that I was surprised the food was great! I have great service and the atmosphere was also great. As far as the prices, I can see them being a bit higher than some other Indian restaurants but keep in mind, ANY restaurant in a casino will be more expensive. Even McDonald's in a casino will cost more for food than off the strip due to the high rent. I went in for dinner and I was very happy with what I ordered and I would totally try them again. 

$14 for lunch is actually a good deal and I wasn't aware of that until I went in. I will probably go back later in the week to check out the lunch buffet but otherwise  I really had no complaints.

The service here was bad (or way too good depending on your point of view). We came to relax and have a birthday dinner. Our waiter promptly asked us if we were ready to order and we said we needed some time to look over the menus (there were 3).

About a minute later the waiter was back asking if we were ready to order, so fine, we picked out some drinks.

About a minute after that (before the drinks even arrived) the waiter was back asking if we were ready to order. I was getting annoyed, but I explained that we were here to relax and have a nice dinner so we need some time to look over the menus. He seemed to understand.

About two minutes after that a runner brought over our drinks and our waiter walked over right away to ask how our drinks were (they weren't even on the table yet) and whether we were ready to order. No, we are not ready to order - I mean our menus weren't even opened. Of course we're not ready!

This time he gave us nearly 5 minutes and I had managed to open one of the menus, but sure enough, right back at the table asking if we're ready to order. I just picked something so he would leave us alone.

It took maybe 5 minutes for our food to come out. Holy shit that's quick! We took our time eating as we would in any restaurant (10-15 minutes) and I swear as I was putting the last bite in my mouth the waiter was back at the table asking if he could take my plate. He returned momentarily to take the second plate and already had a check in his hand ...but we were going to order dessert.

Obviously annoyed, he gave us a dessert menu and was back at the table 2 minutes later to take the dessert order. Dessert came out in probably 3 minutes along with another check.

I couldn't even enjoy the food because I felt we were in some kind of race. If NASCAR ever opens themed restaurants, you may want to interview the staff at this place cause they are as fast as they come.",9vL1pYsbbEZ-5OTEDlXFnQ,2,0,2,cNoAm9nZGv4BEsgGFo48dw

The food here is run-of-the-mill Indian and not especially outstanding.

With tax, tip, etc., this dish comes to about $36, or four times what I would pay at my local Indian restaurant.  My companion only had the vegetable pakora appetizer.  With two glasses of wine and one beer, tax, tip (not a very large one at that) it cost $96.  I would have got away with 1/3 of that locally. 

Service was slow.  They were asked to bring my entrée at the same time as my companion's appetizer, but the appetizer showed up several minutes before the entrée.

But this trip we have his whole family here from Spain. So we wanted to take them to something we know is good. 

The food here is good. That's not the reason I gave them 1 star. I have a few issues with how things went. 

The waiter took our order 15 mins after we were seated. The restaurant wasn't packed or anything. I just think he was avoiding us. When he took our order he didn't bother to write anything down! Mind you, it was a party of 6! Drinks and food orders were placed. Another 10 mins passes and a female waiter comes to our table with one drink. We ordered 6 drinks.... did he forget everything?! Yes, yes he did. We then had to wave down another waiter to help us with our drink order. Once all the confusion was over we were left waiting for our food for another 40 mins. 

When the food finally arrived we noticed that the dishes seemed fairly light. My chick tiki masala literally had 5 small squares of chicken in it! 

The absolute best part was the ""waiter"" that we never saw again had the nerve to put a 30% tip that he included on the bill automatically!! Our bill was over $200 for 6 people. We received very little food for the large bill we were given.

3968425,2014-06-17,4,RkOguMKU13hPglELb6t2Vg,"I went to the Royal India Bistro for the lunch buffet today.  Lunch was very good and service was excellent. 

I was the first person here at about 11:30 but several tables were occupied before I left.  The server asked me for my drink order.  I got tap water which.  She then said they had a buffet and I replied that was the reason I was there.  She gestured for me to go ahead and start and she'd get my naan.

The buffet is small by comparison to other Indian buffets in town.  There are 8 hot dishes, some salad, and achaar.  It was a good enough choice and the good taste of the food made up for the limited selection.

The naan was buttered generously and was a welcome addition to the meal.

For my first trip, I got chicken tikka masala, malai kofta, and some basmati rice.  The thing I noticed about all of their dishes was they all had a nice spicy flavor.  It's not overpowering for people who like mild food but it had a definite tang and it was not just one dish but all of them.  It was the first time I know that I had malai kofta and it was really a treat!  The last thing was the vegetable pakora.  This was a bit disappointing.  I didn't read the full description because I know what it is.  The only vegetable I could see/taste was potato.  It seemed more like it was a pakora made from bread stuffing and some potato.

For the second plate, I had aloo matar, daal maharani, and curry chicken.  The aloo matar and curry chicken were good.  The daal was OK.  The sign said spicy lentils but this was the only dish that was lacking in spice.  There were some beans mixed in the daal, too.

For dessert I got some rice pudding and some carrot pudding.  The rice pudding was not labeled as kheer and it had a lot of liquid with less rice unlike kheer or rice puddings I've had before.  The carrot pudding, on the other hand, was very thick and unlike the carrot puddings I've had elsewhere.  Both puddings were very good--I'm not criticizing them but merely pointing out the different preparation.  I wish I had seen the achaar at the beginning of my meal.  I didn't think it would be as tasty with dessert!

Service as I said was very good.  When I went for my second plate, my dirty plate was removed and my water glass refilled.  The server was very pleasant.  The room is quite nice and it was very quiet.  

The price is just over $16 including tax.  For the limited selection, it's higher than most places.  Also, you have to park and walk your way through the casino to get there and it's right in the middle, halfway between either garage.

4396990,2014-05-14,3,RkOguMKU13hPglELb6t2Vg,"Very bad experience at Royal. Indian food is one of my favorites and I was very excited to find a semi-upscale Indian restaurant in a Vegas casino, but what a disappointment. I think we might have made a mistake going for dinner though. In my experience, Indian restaurants are typically better for the lunch buffet.

1. Service- I'm not really sure whether to complain about service or not. We were not really ignored, but at the time we were the only ones in the restaurant so not that hard. I also felt like the wait staff was trying to push me to spend more money the whole time. They asked if I wanted an appetizer 3 times, asked if I wanted a bottle of wine rather than a glass a couple times, asked if I wanted to add sides or extra bread and weren't clear if they would be extra charge. Just slightly annoying. Also my entree was pretty spicy and they kept letting my water go empty (again, we were the only ones there)

2. Food-  I ordered the goat masala, which was one of the 3 or 4 items under the menu section ""specialties"". When I see this in a restaurant I usually assume they mean these are their best dishes, the ones they are known for. The rice was pretty good. Its pretty hard to mess up rice. The naan bread was also pretty good. The sauce was a little spicier than I expected, but I liked it (and they did offer a milder version). The problem was the meat. I've never had goat before, but there has to be a better cut than what we were served (my dad got the same thing as me). It was some of the toughest meat I've ever had, and there were maybe 2 or 3 bites that were free of fat or gristle. The pieces all had a big bone in the middle and smaller bones throughout. I kept accidentally biting down on them and hurting my teeth. The masala also had no vegetables in it just meat and sauce which was disappointing, to me at least.
The worst of it though was how I felt afterwards. I don't want to say that it made me sick, but I spent a considerable amount of time late that night and the next day on the toilet, and I wasn't hungry the whole next day.

3. Price- The reason this place is getting the worst possible score. For two people, one glass of wine each and then water the rest of the time, entree with no appetizer, no desert it was $83.00. Add a 15% tip and you are getting close to $100. I am used to paying that kind of money to eat on the strip, but I expect a certain level of quality and service for that price, and it was not met here.

Bottom line is that I am not going back and I would not recommend it to anyone. At least stay way from the goat.",zT6CYx2J7KcAjEsKg-Hgrg,2,0,1,_DoXcgIIoJQnQAS99nQaew

The servers are pretty rude and seem to not really give a flying fuck about anyone when taking orders or asked about something. The only gentleman who was friendly was the person serving water. The manager here is exceptionally unfriendly and doesn't seem interested in greeting their customers or even caring about anything. On a plus side, the food was pretty good. Hopefully the chefs attitude is unlike these people who are in the front.

For appetizers the Garlic Naan Bread, Bhaji onion ring type dish and the Vegetable Samsoa are all worth getting.  For main courses the Chicken Tikka Masala & Shrimp Vindaloo were both very good too.  

I would have to try some other places before I could compare it but I definitely recommend trying this place for yourself.  Service & Food both solid.",GkK2CrXnHq0mIEcW4TPceQ,0,1,4,t_SIjd0CN16zSqpb5cpSsw

The ambience was good, though before remodeling last year, my opinion is that it was better. The food was not what I was hoping for. The samosas lacked flavor and the shell was rather thick for a samosa. The tandoori paratha was very good. The main dish I ordered, malai kofta, was a big disappointment. I did order mild assuming this meant minimal hot chilis not expecting little or no spices in the malai kofta and the sauce as well. The sauce tasted too tomato like. It looked like a mixture of sour cream and canned tomato pieces with some food coloring. The pistachio kulfi was passable. It was too green in color. Because it was served in a martini glass, it was a little hard to cut a piece with a spoon when trying to eat it without tipping over the glass. Overall, the food was below average. The only reason why I might give it another try some day is that the service and ambience made it a good dining experience.",LHYN9QbgTKyQ4Nj7dxWLhg,1,0,3,7njIjQgJcD8oE7nBMFb52Q

All were very flavorful.  The hot, not too over powering, but can sneak up on you.  Very quite place located in the Rio hotel.  If you're looking for a break from the casinos this is the place to go.  Some private rooms.  Great wine list.  Would give it a 5, but the wait staff didn't seem as familiar with the menu as I a thought they should be.",2gXE-2otulL4cbrUM5I88w,0,0,4,VNeL4E9wRz8SWIzpWC_N-Q

I called the restaurant to verify whether the lack of rice with two small tubs of curry was correct. The restaurant admitted that we need to purchase rice separately. After paying $45 for two small bowls of curry with nothing to eat it with, I feel like my family was robbed. 

Luckily I had two bags of Uncle Ben's ready rice in my cupboard. Never ordering here again. We are better off eating Indian food from Fashion Show Mall food court.",mqTzWMZ9W4zUgJXAZJiQfg,0,0,2,5BcTWN-mv-EZJCtwWYlnGQ
5926061,2013-09-27,1,RkOguMKU13hPglELb6t2Vg,"The wooden elephants in the middle of a casino sure beckon your indulgence for Indian food.  Me and a friend of mine from LA, went there. The place is not for the someone looking for a cheap Chinese buffet where you need a food taster on a retainer, to see you will survive the ordeal.  

Almost all the Chinese restaurants in Vegas are filthy and dirty rat holes except for the Panda express outlets, exposed on a daily basis, by Chanel 13 TV. They are swarming with cockroaches (I saw one was as big as King Kong, sitting cross legged.on an easy chair ) The meat  is not brought at traditional butcher or reputable supply houses or suppliers, but from unknown sources and no one has any idea which animal it came from. Then the illegal Chinese workers live in the kitchen and bathe in the kitchen and they also double as cooks, dishwashers and cleaning staff and they are closed for cleaning one day a year. A disability and life insurance is a good thing before eating in there. The only word they speak is ""Enjoy"" which sounds like an order to be complied.. if not the fortune cookie will have even sterner message in broken English,.

In this restaurant, I prefer to order fish Kabob, since they are more North Indian than South. The kabob is a dry item and the cooking process removes any kind of fish aroma.. I suggested this to my friend who devoured this so much he came back with his family few months later and ate to the hearts content.

The food is fresh and healthy and you have to know what to order, not to mention you are paying three times the price for the luxury of dining inside a casino and the overhead is three time higher than a strip joint. 

The chicken pakora is another delicacy that is perfect as an appetizer when you are relaxing with a chilled red wine. The place was called Gaylord before and the decoration was awful and the newer remodeling is nothing to brag about. The eatery is too well lighted for my tastes and loses the romantic appeal that you seek when you are paying this kind of money but the fish kabob is just out of this world.

Other dry items i like is the tandoori assortment with fish, chicken and shrimp of course the mango kulfi and pistachio kulfi  that is delectable if served like an ice cream not like a hard cake.",QsznkLEL_ljuk6UUMd1ukg,0,0,3,QPjdRp_OATuYwtF_qYaA7g

It was grilled therefore no sauce. It had lots of flavor since it has been marinated. The rice was delicious too. The lamb vindaloo was a standard vindaloo nothing special but good.
