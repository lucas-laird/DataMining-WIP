It wasn't too far away from home. When my bf and I walked in we were greeted by a lady, she was very friendly. 

The oxtail soup was pretty good, not too salty, and was  missing a little bit of flavor. Once you add the ginger in it makes it just right. I would come back here again since it's the only decent Hawaiian food in the Northwest side of town.",jEBySjq6tgL-_R3P7LHq0w,1,1,4,tDmWa0IdiqhqTEgl3jpJsA

This was the only restaurant that satisfied our taste bud but didn't cost us a fortune. You can see the price from the menu that other people posted here. The restaurant was not fancy, but clean and comfortable. We ordered the Teriyaki Chicken, Hawaiian BBQ Chicken, BBQ Short Ribs and few other items. I definitely agree with other reviewers that the sauce was delicious, and the portion was good too. During the time we were eating there, we saw quite a few group of people came in to pickup their to-go orders.

We always order the same thing, the fried shrimp, mahi and chicken katsu combo plate, the fried shrimp, mahi BBQ chicken combo plate, beef fried saimin, spam saimin, BBQ chicken plate and a chicken katsu plate. Sometimes they're good others they're ok. Today everything was bad. It seems as if they're cutting costs by slicing the chicken and mahi length wise in half so it looks like the same amount but just much thinner. Nothing had taste even the saimin was watered down and half the amount of noodles. The fried saimin was half veggies half noodles with about 4 small pieces of beef. The BBQ chicken was thin and wasn't marinated enough so there was no taste. The chicken katsu was thin and overly fried it was like jerky. The katsu in my combo looked like left overs they cut and refried and the mahi was so thin it shriveled up into a curly q. I called them to tell them at the very least replace the katsu which was obviously refried so they told me to bring it back. Needless to say I brought back just the katsu and I told them how the mahi was and the cook showed me how the other pre-battered frozen pieces looked. The other cook gave me dirty looks and the two of them including the cashier was all talking Spanish which shows no ALOHA despite their name.",pFy3ZKFEbIHdZszCqzlG5g,1,1,1,uKBdjF7ktzKN-M__5_5NbA

We got the BBQ Mixed Plate and Chicken Katsu Plate to go.  The food was plentiful and tasty, However, I found the teriyaki beef to be quite salty and unusually garlicky.  The BBQ chicken and kalbi (Korean ribs) that is also part of the BBQ mix, were good.  The Katsu was also good.

This is as good as you can expect for the price.  So if you're craving some local Hawaiian grinds, this ain't a bad place to go.  Mahalo.",tS6uLu_8x4Tn_BzXYSKQgg,1,0,4,KV1BzymEdakSxLogkVw0rQ

901380,2016-02-21,1,KTDDw1gAV4G_YoKOdQ1Ygw,"Been eating here for several years now. Not that it was fantastic food, more because L&L is a few more miles down the road in centennial.

Lately, their quality of food and service have gone significantly down.  I was born and raised in hawaii and i know authentic hawaiian bbq.  The owner has hired mexicans to work the register and cook to save a few bucks.  How on earth does a mexican know about hawaiian food? I would never call myself an excellent authentic mexican cook if i never spent a lifetime experiencing their culture.  But then, i looked at the owner and he is a ""FOB"" (FRESH OFF THE BOAT) asian that probably has no idea what true hawaiian culture is anyway.

Long story short, because the mexican help had trouble with my order they screwed up on it. I'm not saying that she did it on purpose, what i'm saying is the message got lost in translation.  However their service recovery sucked ass and implied the error was by the consumer. Same thing with the manager, and especially with the fob owner. Simple math could have solved the problem.

The food isn't bad, but the customer should never feel cheated after attempting a resolution. Drive the extra couple of miles to L&L in centennial, you will thank me later.

One last thing, if you were the fob owner, why would you really hire mexicans at your hawaiian bbq?  The only answer i can think of is to save money.  His chicken katsu is smaller, his mahi plates are smaller in portions. It is reasonable to believe, he is dying financially and is on survival mode.  Good luck to renewing your lease and spending all your life savings.",6HvAk-WLcU3z4m7s4Eqq4A,3,0,1,Gnyxk-5uALecyV9Wc3oAVA
938988,2018-02-09,0,KTDDw1gAV4G_YoKOdQ1Ygw,"The cashier was clean and polite. It was the only positive takeaway from my lunch experience yesterday. The chicken was old reheated chicken in sauce. It was precooked sliced slimy pieces about the size of a quarter and as thick as a poker chip, and not freshly cooked. The broccoli was actually amazingly bad. Not only did it have no flavor, but it looked dead. It was rubbery and it had wrinkles all over the stalks. It is not that it was overcooked, but rather very old wrinkled up broccoli tops before they were cooked. Absolutely zero flavor. The rice was old and parts were warm and moist and parts were dry and hard. I was the only customer. They had a chef who was wearing a filthy apron that looked like it had never been washed, and a prep guy who was clean. Out of three people working this establishment, they couldn't cook their only one customer, a nice simple order. It really pissed me off, thus why I made a note to make sure and write a review. I tipped as I ordered because I was short on time and couldn't go anywhere else and was prehorrified by the look of the chef, and hoped that would get me some quality food, but it had no impact.

966161,2016-02-22,0,KTDDw1gAV4G_YoKOdQ1Ygw,"I have lived near and gone to this place for just over 6 years now. The quality has fluctuated as have the staff, but they have been 'good enough' and the close proximity has made it a place  I visit frequently. Today was the final straw for me. The quality of the chicken cutlet with gravy was terrible. It was like burnt chicken jerky (any cook willing to serve that cant be trusted). A side of Mac was ordered but instead of a extra side for my kid they just put the Mac from my meal on the side (lost in translation I guess). The steady decline in customer service but more importantly food quality means I now drive to Decatur and 215 to the Hawaiian place by Walmart.

If your going to go here you might get lucky but I would recommend going elsewhere.

The teriyaki sauce in this place is to die for. Their teriyaki cheeseburger is one of my favorite burgers in town (even above In and Out). It's not too big, but it has tons of delicious flavor. And because it's the size of a burger that you'd probably make at home, you don't feel disgusting after eating it.

Their macaroni salad (not vegetarian safe) is creamy and very good. It has a small amount of tuna(I think) in it - and while that may sound gross, it's actually quite awesome. Just trust me.

Their short ribs are kind of fatty and I didn't like them very much, but everything else I have tried (including the gravy) is yummy.",Uw-v0UN_g_oFvldC7HWXMg,2,1,4,3DypTAq-_4oCF5Aazy0xlg

I got the mini curry katsu. It was crispy and soft with enough curry just penetrating the exterior to soften it up a bit and really give it life. It comes with a very generous portion of rice and the always present macaroni salad. 

My girlfriend got the Chicken BBQ mahi mahi and shrimp combo. Lets say she could not finish it. A taste sensation? Sure if but to my honest opinion it's like the Hawaiian Soul food to be honest. Stick to your ribs food in it's pan fried, deep fried and BBQ-ed glory. 

Our tab ? under $20... You'll never spend more than $10 per person coming here.

There are usually two people manning the station up at the register. They are nice enough. The humongous 6 person T shirt adorns there walls. And Let's face it if you end up here ambiance wasn't what you were looking for in the first place. So stop by and get some Hawaiian classics.

Big portions don't mean it's good food. But, my family, who lives there in Las Vegas tends to think so. I guess if you pour enough shoyu or chili pepper water on something, you can't taste how bland something is. And that's what I thought about the food my family picked up for a small gathering at my mom's house. 

Chicken katsu, fried noodles and teriyaki. Lots of food - gotta give them that. But it stops there. Katsu was not crispy on the outside or moist on the inside. Damp is the word that comes to mind. Teriyaki was overdone. Looked ok at first glance but at first bite, overcooked. Fried noodles was ok. Frying noodles is hard to mess up, like cooking rice. For my taste though, the noodles could have used a little more salt and or shoyu.

First, the staff aren't really attentive or helpful. They kind of just take your order. No personality and not very welcoming. 

For foods, the chicken Katsu that I've ordered a few times had a very bland taste to it. The outer coating was more soggy then  anything. The sauce for the Katsu had a different taste to what I'm used to. It has a very watery texture to it. It comes with Mac salad which taste like pure mayonnaise and on the salty side. 

You probably wonder why I've ate here a ""few"" times like i mentioned in the beginning if I didn't like it. Well, the beau kinda likes this place and it's pretty close to his house so it's convenient when we need something quick and close by.

It's clean and nicely decorated, with bright yellow paint and a giant Hawaiian shirt on the wall.  The menu offers a wide variety of Hawaiian specialties like kalua pork, katsu and other curry, a few shrimp dishes, saimin and fried saimin noodles, etc.  My personal favorite, and the one I ordered while there,  is loco moco: hamburg patties topped with a rich, brown gravy and fried egg over white rice.  Macaroni salad on the side.  It was delish, just like in Hawaii.  Best of all, many entrees come in a mini version, less food and less cost.

3014177,2010-04-05,2,KTDDw1gAV4G_YoKOdQ1Ygw,"I wanted something different, something I'm used to from home.  First thing that popped in my head was eating at a Hawaiian place, but I didn't feel like driving down Rainbow to get it.  i was on my way to get my husband for lunch when I saw this place in the same strip mall near an Albertsons.  I figured, ""why not?"" and went inside.

It's fairly small so there isn't much seating, but from the looks of things people order take out A LOT.  That's a good sign.  I checked out their menu, and it's nice and simple.  It's the same menu I've seen at several Hawaiian bbq restaurants around town, so I went for the usual chicken katsu with steamed rice and my husband ordered fried shrimp and their seafood platter.  

Despite having several dozen options for Hawaiian bbq around town, this one is now on my list of favorites.  Their fried foods are awesome and not greasy like some places, and their batter has great flavor.  I love panko breaded anything, and their katsu and fried seafood is all panko.  I loved that their katsu sauce, whether it's from a bottle or not, is sweeter than the other places, but still has that nice tangy finish with a bit of heat.  

We tried their kalua pig and other things on the menu a few days after and it was all good, even when doing take out.  Their mac salad is good, too, and different because they add tuna in theirs.  They are known for their oxtail soup, which I will try eventually.  Overall, it's a great stop for some good Hawaiian fast food.  I actually prefer them over the other places around the northwest area.  

Clean, friendly. and fast.  They may not have the dessert menu that some other Hawaiian bbq places have, but do you really go there for the cake and ice cream?  No. You go there for a simple, fast meal that's good, and they do it well.

Stop by and try out their food.  Some people may argue that it's like the other Hawaiian bbq places because of the menu, but this place tastes better, cleaner, and less greasy.  That, and their employees give great service.

Give this place a try if you live in the area.  I know the location looks fishy because of the stores next to it and it's in this tiny strip mall building, but it is good.  I even questioned myself because I tend to stay away from places like that...at least, I used to.  I've learned that these places, despite location, can fork out some of the best food you will eat in Vegas, so give it a try.

3167490,2015-09-03,2,KTDDw1gAV4G_YoKOdQ1Ygw,"I've been on a massive Loco Moco kick the last couple months, and find myself constantly craving it. I work right by this Aloha location and with really no other places in the area, I've stopped here a couple times after work to somewhat satisfy my craving. One of my least favorite things about this place is the feel of it. It's not necessarily dirty, but it's definitely run down, and looks like the staff gives it very little attention. I realize it's more or less of a fast food joint, but at least try to make it look inviting so people will want to eat here.

The staff is another downer for Aloha. Each time I've been in here, everyone just looks miserable. There's really no smiles or welcomes, and if you ask them questions, it's like you're pulling teeth. They've also got a cook in the back who always seem to be screwing off and messing with the other staff. Maybe he owns the place, I don't know, but he kind of just seems to do whatever he wants. 

Obviously you aren't going to come here for 5 star service, so let's talk about the food. While I'm not an expert on Hawaiin food by any means, I think this place is ok and has a couple decent things to offer. My craving for loco mock isn't completely satisfied, but their version holds me over pretty well. I like that their hamburger patty appears to be hand made and has a decent seasoning on it's own. It's tender, not dry at all and their gravy isn't bad either. Besides being a little on the watery said, it has solid flavor and isn't overly salty. The rice they use is as plain jane as it comes, but they at least cook the egg right, and it makes for an overall tasty plate of food. And their portions are huge! Their ""Mini"" is only $6.15 and is plenty for me. If you're super hungry, try their ""Regular"" for only $8.15 and if you finish it, you'll probably be sickly full.

Both my son and I enjoy the spam musubi as well. It's got a slightly sweet sauce that pairs well with the salty spam, and for only $2.15 you get a nice size piece that is perfect for a little snack or side. Since their macaroni salad is extremely salty and has a strong mayo taste, I'd ask if they can just uncharge and swap it out for spam musubi instead on my next visit though. 

There are a couple things I wouldn't recommend trying, but these are probably givens being that it's basically fast food. Their fried mahi-mahi is pretty bad, and even my 6 year old, who loves almost all seafood, just couldn't eat it. He did like the fried shrimp however, which wasn't nearly as bad, but probably not something I'd order again for myself.

For what Aloha Hawaiin BBQ is, I don't think it's bad, but it's not great. The loco moco alone is decent enough for me to come back when I get the craving and I'm nearby, but I wouldn't go out of my way for it. Overall, it's ""A-OK""!",QqRSNjWhfUFv1ZU0OnYKZQ,4,4,3,jC9MlglHY73VUucJRJLYgg

3378460,2011-05-30,2,KTDDw1gAV4G_YoKOdQ1Ygw,"I have been to probably four or five hawaiian bbq places in my 29 years of life including this bad boy. I must say that, from my experiences, Aloha Hawaiian BBQ is atop the list. 

Before I begin, I want to start off by saying I wouldn't take my opinion on hawaiian food as seriously as the big, tattooed guy with black beads around his neck that lives down the block. I know good food and I know good prices. Aloha has both.

Today I purchased the 'Bar-B-Que Mixed' that was only 8 bucks. This meal consisted of fried rice, macaroni salad, BBQ short rib, BBQ chicken, and BBQ beef. The portions were fair for the price of admission and all of the meats had a distinct sweet / teriyaki flavor. If you are anything like me, teriyaki = mouth orgasm. From what their website says, the chicken, kalbi, and beef are marinaded in teriyaki before going on the grill. If you can complain about that, you will NEVER be a friend of mine.

Since I ordered my meal over the phone to go, I can't comment on the cleanliness of the restaurant or the service inside in detail. From what I saw, however, the restaurant was clean and the man who helped me was friendly and knew the menu. 

In the end, Aloha Hawaiian BBQ will be my place to go in Las Vegas for Hawaiian BBQ. The only reason I gave the place a 4 out of 5 is due to the fact that there can always be room for improvement (especially in price) and the meat was, in fact, a little bit thin and gummy (but I still assure you ; tasty).  

If you are in Las Vegas and want to escape to Hawaii for the duration of a meal, Aloha Hawaiian BBQ might just be your place.",kKbGPQ1Cn-6J1XRkdA50Uw,1,0,4,9b8aUjvYSG50Ck67b9opAA

4146925,2014-06-11,0,KTDDw1gAV4G_YoKOdQ1Ygw,"I am always on the lookout for good Hawaiian food closer to home than what I currently am aware of.  Aloha Hawaiian BBQ I have found to be the closest.  It is pretty much like most all the other Hwaiian restaurants out here.  In fact, they all start looking alike after so long.  And the food is all about the same.  

On this visit I ordered a Katsu 1/2 plate (one scoop of rice vs two).  It came with the katsu, rice and a scoop of macaroni salad.  You know, the classics.  I also got another clcassic in Spam Musubi.  That is kind of my basic judge of a Hawaiian Restaurant.  I did not have to wait too long to receive my food.  Just long enough to witness the interaction between the cashier and the next party of customers.  All of them were of Asian background.  Their speaking to each other sounded almost angry at times.  As if they were yelling at each other.  I think I even heard them arguing on price.  Maybe it is a cultural thing.  I don't know.  It was kind of entertaining regardless.  

Any how, I got my food to go and took it home to eat in peace.  At leastsome of the food made it home.  I took a big risk in trying to eat the musubi on the road.  I did OK.  The nori was tender enough that it was not a chore to bite through.  This helped to hold in the Spam where in some cases it slides right out the other side on bite one.  What bothered me just enough to reall is the sauce on this musubi.  I am used to a more teriyaki style sauce.  This was more like a hoisin with a mildly spicy kick.  It was not necessarily bad just not what I had expected.  As for the katsu plate when I got home, it was hit and miss.  The katsu and sauce were on point.  The rice was as good as sticky white rice can be.  The macaroni salad was not great.  Half of it was burried beneath the rice and getting warm.  It was a little gross.  The final impression was that the chicken was not on a bed of shredded cabbage like at L&L but rather on a bed of shredded lettuce that wilts whe in contact with hot fried chicken.  Not the most appetizing of garnishes.

Aloha Hawaiian BBQ is not going to be my number one go-to but for a quick go-to close to home, it does the trick.",eOIMO2wT_WbNqmavhnCRxw,2,0,3,FpfoJffnzv2xUYNSYG1d1g

5048441,2010-12-05,2,KTDDw1gAV4G_YoKOdQ1Ygw,"I find most Hawaiian plate places are pretty much the same, but on occasion a certain place might surprise me on the little differences that can set them apart even though they're serving the same usual menu. 

We grabbed a Combo Plate C-3 which is BBQ chicken, fried shrimp and mahi-mahi ($8.20) and a mini chicken katsu ($4.95). 

They give you the option of steamed rice or fried rice. Now normally I stir away at Chinese places that have lunch specials with fried rice since i usually gets the Panda Express treatment- just taste like soy and oil and not much else. I figured I never had fried rice at a Hawaiian place so we ordered one entree with the fried rice and one with steamed (just in case). 

BBQ chicken was nice in flavors and  give the teriyaki sauce a try with it. Normally I skip the sauce since most places it's this thick sticky cloyingly sweet salty thing. Theirs is light, kinda with a garlicky taste and you can taste some ginger in there. A little bit complimented the meat instead of overpowering.

Fried shrimp- standard, but good. Batter is light with some panko and you can see the fryer oil is clean since the batter taste how it should. 

Mahi- not in the panko batter, but this was decent. My problem is some places give a super thin piece that it's eating batter with a side of fish. Also many places it's fishy and it's something to skip. It wasn't bad here. 

Katsu was great. Light batter and panko since a lot of places overdo the batter and use it to mask the not so quality, fatty chicken. White meat, clean batter good sweet, but a bit worstershire-sque sauce. 

Fried rice was pretty good! It had a sweet shoyu taste and just simple with egg so it's not overly flavored, but just enough. It's also not greasy either. 

It's the little details that count and what makes this a better plate option over some of the competitors close by.",n86B7IkbU20AkxlFX_5aew,7,5,4,2R8T1MkVcs_V2W6z1RRUKg

I must say that the BBQ mix plate is enough to feed 2 or more people! The meat was all very flavorful and crisp on the outside while still juicy on the inside. The rice was cooked to perfection and the macaroni salad was a nice complement to the meat.

I informed her that my Boba taste like crap and I would like a tai tea instead and she told me normally they will not give you a different drink if you don't like it. That's bad for business. Anyways she ended up giving me my tai tea. I wonder if something doesn't taste right to you if she'll make you something else. I don't know but she got on my nerves.,GgHrOvmH1k7DIPr_dq_Slw,0,0,3,rQ6pa8swu-NMxdq1Gx3XVQ

The taste was so strong that I could barely eat it.  The next time I went the food was pretty good.  Then I went this past Wednesday and ordered the curry katsu.

They offer garlic shrimp which are breaded and fried not like the other locations. Good portions for the prices. They also have poke and you can tell it's fresh by the color of it. Every time I go I have to get an order of it but I would like it if they gave a little more,7NPV5prPRBebWlyprJBS1g,0,0,5,wcADlUsiaF9hqMsjaejRpQ

Don't mind the dirty restrooms lol but it reminds me of an old ma and pa or hole in the wall type of eatery!
