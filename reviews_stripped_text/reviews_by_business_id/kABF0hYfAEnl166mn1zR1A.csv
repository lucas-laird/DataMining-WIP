My husband and I both tried Shangxi sliced noodle on the menu, noodle is ok, not very outstanding. The soup taste kind of sweet , I wonder if they putting too much sugar in there. The second time when we visit I tried the beef noodle soup , I feel like it mostly taste the same as Shangxi sliced noodle in flavor I don't think this place Authentic! All of noodle soups I ever tried there almost taste like same way!

The soup broth itself didn't really have any flavor until you mix in the sate chili oil. As for the noodles, they were ok, nothing really special. The braised beef wasn't as tender as we expected it to be and just comes with plain noodles or rice.

Got great service and couldn't complain. I got the hot and spicy noodle and she got the chicken curry with knife cut noodles. 

When you looked at the knife cut noodles when they came.out they looked over done, deteriorating and mushy looking, yet when you tasted them they were completely doughy. My hot and spicy noodles were completely covered in chili oil and I could taste nothing else but the burning of the heat. Now I love a good spicy dish but when all they did was add chili oil on top I'm a little disappointed. My noodles were good but overall not a well thought out, or executed, dish.

We also got the steamed pork dumping, seeing as they mispelt dumpling on their menu, 8 pieces and as we watched the chefs they brought out frozen gyoza. Kind of disappointing when your name is the noodle man and yet no fresh dumplings. We also got the spicy pork wontons, due to the fact that everyone raved about them, and they weren't that good. Like my noodle dish, they were swimming in chili oil and had a black pepper crust on the top of them. Overall I wasn't that impressed seeing as I make and have been to places that make fresh pasta. I will be back to try something else because I don't believe one bad time is equivalent to giving a place a bad review but it will be a good long time before I try it again.",STVLaQt3mROi875J6i2GcQ,1,0,2,6sdh0IFDOZ89-_EzkQj9xA

Service is really nice and attentive. What a nice change from some other Asian eateries in town!

Décor is super cute - modern Chinese, and extremely clean. Somebody definitely put some thought into this place. 

The menu is not big but there's something for everyone (even vegetarian dishes!). They have appetizers, soupy noodle dishes, and a choice of dry noodles or rice on the last page of the menu. 

We split the beef filled flat pancakes ($6), pork wontons in chili oil ($5), and the Lanzhou beef noodle soup ($8).  Everything was tasty, and not overly salty (AKA no MSG hopefully). The wontons and beef noodle soup had a spicy kick to it, but nothing too crazy. I have a weak stomach for spice and handled it just fine.  SO had a milk tea ($3.5), but I thought it was way too sweet. They offer a couple fun boba drinks. 

Really happy about this place, I think prices are pretty reasonable for the portion size and quality of ingredients. Will def be back very soon to try more dishes.

It was packed with diners on a Sunday night, but we were seated and served at rapid pace. My partner had the beef and tomato noodle and I chose the hot and spicy noodle. Tip for anyone who loves spicy food: Szechuan peppercorn is a very different kind of spice- incredibly fragrant, warming, and at times NUMBING. There were times that I lost the focus of my palate due to the numbing effect of the peppercorn on my lips and tongue.

The hot and spicy, while challenging to the senses, was a bright and exciting broth with a touch of ginger and citrus. It was loaded with salty and unctuous morsels of ground pork, braised Bok Choy, and peanut.

The tomato and beef was mild, but had a wonderful umami quality, and was loaded with beef. It was very delicious and comforting, and would be suited to any non-adventurous palates in your party.

We also ordered the chicken and mushroom dumplings, which were served fresh out of the fryer and were incredibly juicy! My only disappointment was that we ordered them as an appetizer but they did not come to the table until the end of the meal.

I would advise trying to find a seat away from the door, as you will be prey to the wind every time it opens. But the blustery atmosphere at our table only served to emphasize the comforting nature of these delicious noodles.",gdra9cxGRv0XqoK4477kPg,0,0,4,WSZ6DnuiYgXCM0JYdEK_Ew

We came for a late lunch on my daughters second birthday as it is tradition to have noodles for ""longevity"".  We were sat by the door which I didn't mind since all tables were full and with a toddler there was no way we could manage the bar.  WRONG. At the time we were seated they were receiving shipment through the front door, so we caught a glimpse of cold air quiet frequently till they were done.  The menus were just dropped in front of us, no welcome or explanation of the menu (I know it's noodles...who needs explanation...but I usually enjoy the nice welcome introductory when trying something new, it's like a bonding moment lol).  Then shortly a slightly grumpy elder gentlemen approaches is and asks ""are you ready?"", we each order and he quickly walks away...soooooo no drinks?  I mean I ordered soup but I would like a beverage please?   As he comes back and drops off my soup I ask ""can we order drinks?""  So he takes my order for Lemon honey tea and turns around quickly before my husband can order lol.  When he comes back to check if I wanted ""Iced tea or boba"" and clarify iced tea and quickly stop him to let my husband order a beverage too.  At this time I think he finally understands how bad of service he is providing.  While waiting the door flings open several times for remaining shipment, twice for the trash; I noticed the table across from me also annoyed by all this, like shouldn't all restaurants have back doors?  How is this not against health code violations to be lugging piles of trash through a dinning area?!?!  Anyways enough of the service rant, the food is what saves them and that's the main reason for this awesome app right? I opted for the Beef Brisket w/ tomato soup.  Oh man!  It was tender and flavorful!  It wasn't spicy so I was more that doubtful to share with my little one.  The noodles were not overdone and cooked al Dente for soup.  My husband had a taste of my soup and admittedly wished he order the same.  He had the homemade Zhu Jiong noodles which too was delicious with the right portions of noodles vs veggies and meat.  By the time we were stuffed our left overs were still steaming hot.

The B3 is similar to the B1 but not as spicy and they use Shanxi Knife Cut noodles instead of the thinner noodles.  Shanxi Knife Cut noodles are light and fluffy noodles, akin to dumpling skin. They're a bit hard to eat, I prefer the thinner, hardier noodles in the B1. The broth and beef in both soups are good. 

The store's name is Noodle Man, so we ate noodles. But they have the best pan-fried dumplings in Las Vegas. Highly recommend. 

My gf always gets the Pork Belly and Egg over noodles and she really likes it.  

I'd skip the spicy beef appetizer (it's not on the menu), it is beef smothered in chili oil sauce and it is served cold. I didn't like the texture. 
The mongolian beef pancakes are a favorite amongst Yelpers but they didn't work for me. They are extra greasy. The beef is more like a hamburger patty than Mongolian beef. It's hard to explain. Weird is a good word for it. 
C1, Sliced Pork and Mushrooms is smothered in sauce and served with Shanxi Knife Cut noodles. I don't think it was as good as the Pork Belly and Egg which is served with thinner noodles. 

The service has always been friendly and on point. They got an order wrong one time and they corrected it with no hassle. The food comes out quickly. 

Overall, this is my favorite noodle place in Las Vegas next to Ramen Sora.",8ndTy5avbH5gFiJ0lkXODQ,4,1,5,JsceXTrmpZlRHQW17DEM1Q

The chili oil has ZERO spice or flavor, and whenever I ate a wonton, it felt like I was pouring oil down my mouth.

We came here for the fresh made pulled noodle, we were told the wait is over an hour because the machine is broken and the chef is not there. Wait! I thought the pulled noodle is always made by man not machine!! Apparently this is a machine made type of store.

We ordered b3, the knife cut noodle. The noodle is flat ok, the broth is not. Too sweet and too garlicky, and meat is undercooked.

We also order the (boiled) dumpling and beef pocket pancake . This is the part I strongly question the authenticity of the store. Everyone who has eaten the beef pancakes know the best (and  most cautious) part of eating it is the juice inside it. You bite a small opening, let the steam out, and carefully suck the soup/ juice out of the pocket! Nope! Not this store, they simple cut it in half so the juice and the heat are lost! And the onion inside, is undercooked. Not a big fan of half cooked veggies. And the dumplings, of course is broken. Authentic Chinese dumplings should not be broken, once again, to keep the juice inside.

Lastly, they charge $1 for tea. REAL Chinese restaurant will not charge for tea. Why? Because it is a gesture to show hospitality. It's a cultural thing. I know some of you may say but many restaurants do that, I can only say, my dear friends, then you haven't visited  the REAL AUTHENTIC GOOD ones.

We were super excited to finally have a legit hand pulled noodle place in town and was waiting to try it. As what other reviews say, its pretty busy. We were only 2 people so we were sat at a table fairly quickly. 

Menu is simple. 3 ""pages"" long with about 10 items per page. 1st page appetizers, 2nd page noodles, 3rd page, other specialty dishes. We had ordered a vegetable pancake (reminds me of a chive pocket my uncle's coworker made that was AMAZING), spicy wontons, B2 (brisket + hand pulled noodles in a ""tomato"" soup base) and B4 (hot and spicy hand pulled noodles).

You have a good view from any part of the restaurant of the guy making the fresh hand pulled noodles. They did a pretty good job with decor and layout with a nice new-age ambiance with the english music playing overhead. The waiters mostly speak mandarin but they are ok with english. So it's manageable if you cant speak. 

Food came pretty promptly despite the busyness of the restaurant. The vegetable pancake was nice and hot. fresh made. Contained veggies like chives but had a lot more glass noodles and other things than i had expected/wanted. Wish they would stuff the thing full until its about to explode with chives. The skin is most likely self-made which was nicely prepared and had a nice crispy edge and chewiness. 2 pancakes cut in half, great for sharing. 

The spicy wontons are nice. similar to Schewan chinese style of cooking with the numbing spices. Mainly filled with pork and lack of shrimp (legit traditional wontons have a large amt of shrimp compared to pork! XD) but overall not bad. Each order gives about 10-15 wontons. Small but not bad overall. 

B2 - Beef brisket with tomato base soup. The pictures are so misleading on their tv above the window. it is definitely NOT red but it is indeed made with some tomato. Not as much as the viet noodle soup Bun Bu Hue but you can taste the tomato flavor. Flavorful but not so heavy soup base. Noodles cooked to perfection. al dente and not soft like some other places by the time it gets to your table. Quartered pieces of bok choy and a small little pile of preserved veggies (probably made themselves too but yummy) Their beef brisket is flavorful and super tender. Definitely my favorite out of the few visits so far. Amount of cilantro and onions they pile on each bowl varies. It ranged from a small amount to and overly large amount. Kind of funny to those who dont like to eat it much. 

B4 - hot and spicy noodles. same hand pulled noodles you see the chef make and use for a lot of their other dishes but the soup base is similar to the one of the spicy wontons. its nice in the beginning but kind of gets ""old"" after a while. numbing spices OP. Lol

B3 - knife cut noodles. similar base to B2 with the tomato soup base and everything but with long flat with varying thickness noodles cut manually by knife. Great texture and chewiness if you like that. Same tender and flavorful brisket as well. and of course the mound of cilantro and preserved veggies. 

B5 - mushroom and chicken noodle. Lightest  noodle soup compared to B1 - B5. Different base. Lighter and good for recovery (hangovers) Lol. simple and clean. same noodles. 

Overall. definitely a fan. Recommend to lots of friends and family. they do get busy but turnover is fairly quick. Enjoy while you can. Who knows how long these places last (nature of vegas lol)",Ksp1e9Dw0Jcog_ZBD3-45g,5,2,5,-d64g--UsLGoTW0OEWLoiA

The interior design is nice, clean...compares to a lot of restaurants in Chinatown. I was very excited to try their Shanxi knife sliced noodles until the waitress put the bowl in front of me. BTW, it took only 3 minutes for them to cook the noodles which was way too fast? How can you make knife sliced noodles in 3 mins??? I'm from Northern China so I'm very familiar with Lanzhou beef noodles(lamian) and Shanxi knife sliced noodles(dao xiao mian).

Okay, let's talk about the taste. The soup was almost tasteless beside the greasy salty flavor. This is NOT a Shanxi knife sliced noodles! We also tried the hot spicy won ton, the sauce was decent, and Szechuan cold noodles, still, too much oils. Szechuan cold noodles are supposed to be dry noodles. I didn't expect to find aboslutely authentic Northern Chinese food in Vegas, but this place was not even close, and I had to give them 2 stars for their services.

The girl who seated us to the table was nice, but she was busy enough can only took our orders. It was pretty crowded during the lunch time. People who came in after us had to wait by the bar. We waited for like 10 minutes for them to bring us the check (because nobody paid attend to our table) The older lady (I guess she is the owner) came and cleaned our table. She didn't say anything to us when she came to our table for 3 times. No ""thank you"", ""are you finished"" or ""how was the food"". Nothing. Then she pulled the signed receipt from my mom's hand. That was the last straw. I knew she was busy and trying to push us to leave, but you don't just pull things from a customer's hand without saying anything! I doubt if my mom was a 6 feet tall big dude, she would do the same thing. 

Not recommend. I live pretty far from the area and we stopped there today because we had to do some business nearby. We gave a shot. It's not worth for us to ever go back.",O7IODrebdexn-KTuTaXxcQ,0,0,2,ytzCg_dwz4JGJAJBBPiwSA

1479640,2015-07-10,1,kABF0hYfAEnl166mn1zR1A,"I saw all these great reviews, was given a recommendation, and thought I'd give ""The Noodle Man"" on South Rainbow a try. It was a huge let down. 

The restaurant is a little hole in the wall place with about five tables of four that could be broken up into tables of two. There is bar space with a view of the chef's preparing your meal. Every time someone opens the door to the restaurant, it is slightly obtrusive, especially at sunset around dinner time. The restaurant is clean and comfortable. The staff is nice, and overall the restaurant has an appealing look.

We started with the Mongolian beef pancakes, which have a soft beef patty inside a crispy breading. Honestly, this was the absolute best part of our meal. If you try nothing else, you need to try this!

Next, we ordered two soups. I ordered the Beef Brisket w/ Tomato Noodle and he ordered the Hot and Spicy Noodle. They came out rather quickly. Mine was good, but lacking in something - not sure what exactly. The noodles were good. It just didn't taste like it was finished. I think maybe some more spices would make this better. I am not sure, however, that they know how to use their spices for flavor because he had the hot and spicy noodle and it was too spicy to eat. Now don't get me wrong, we both like spicy food. This was just a soup mess of spice with floating noodles. Incidentally, one splash of those spices while eating the noodles took his eye out for the evening. Oops! But, he said the bathroom was very clean. 

As a result, he order some pork dumplings to satisfy his need for nourishment. They come prepared two different ways - boiled or fried. He ordered fried and they were good.

Here is the kicker - most restaurants provide unlimited refills of iced-tea. Most Chinese restaurants I have been to do as well. I can even get unlimited hot tea at all of them. Unfortunately, this is not the case here. When I ordered my iced tea, I was asked if I wanted green tea or say honey lemon because, ""the green tea has no sugar, it is plain."" I thought, well... the honey lemon sounds refreshing, so I took her up on her tip. He ordered a mango flavored iced tea. The teas were poured in the back and brought out in iced to-go cups. There was so much ice that you could take maybe four sips before reaching empty. But, no problem... just ask for more, right?

Our bill for iced tea for two people was $17.50. Yup - and I didn't even get a buzz. Other than that, the rest of the bill was another $27.00. That's right all our food was only $27.00. 

I truly believe that part of service includes being knowledgeable about the menu and advising your guests about those menu specifics. I don't think it would have taken much for our server to ask if we wanted to ORDER another drink. There is key language that could have respectfully signaled the fact that drinks are not offered as refills. If all else fails after three maybe someone should have bluntly said, ""fyi... those iced teas are $3.50 each!""",jY1shXf_LQVhSoUyoXqQRQ,4,1,2,yWyaJNqIlkfMVCPz419g3Q

Started with the SPICY PORK WONTONS, they were our favorite dish. Served in chili oil, lightly dressed with spices, and only filled with a pinch of pork, the won ton skins were delicate and delicious. Moved on to the MONGOLIAN BEEF PANCAKE, which was a bit underwhelming. Dipping sauce and accompanying pickled daikon were a nice touch, but the vegetable option may be better as the filling itself was bland. Would suggest a vegetable and beef mixture to be added to the menu. Lastly, we shared the PORK AND MUSHROOM with KNIFE-SLICED NOODLE (first dish at top of last page). This was a massive portion of fresh noodles, would have preferred a thicker noodle though they had good flavor. Good quality, amount, and variety of mushrooms but only saw one small piece of pork in our entire dish. The accompanying sauce made the dish a bit unexpectedly soupy.

Quality was decent and value was great, but the service was having difficulty keeping up with the amount of business they were doing. Great cheap date spot, with nice décor and low prices.

1593482,2016-01-03,2,kABF0hYfAEnl166mn1zR1A,"WARNING: This place does use sichuan peppercorns for their spice. If you are unfamiliar with it, these give your mouth a ""numbing"" sensation. First timers may find it uncomfortable. Stay away from any of the spicy dishes if you wish to not experience it. Personally, I'm not a fan of it. I prefer the bum's-going-to-hurt-the-next-day type of spicy. 

Food can be inconsistent. I got (B7) Hot Pepper Shredded Chicken Chow Mein. I love this dish, but the first time, it was strangely on the sweet side..I decided to get it again and the taste was spot on. Also got the chili wontons again, but tasted different from the first time. I was able to taste and feel the peppercorns as opposed to the first time. I also recommend (B1) Lan Zhou Beef Noodle Soup and (B2) Beef Brisket Beef Noodle Soup. Some may think these do not have much flavor, but I personally think that it's supposed to taste clean, meaning simple flavors. Reminded me of some noodles I had when I visited China. 

I think my favorite aspects of this place is the simplicity of their menu and their prices. By only having a handful of appetizers and entrees, you are not overwhelmed by their options, and I believe it would be less chaotic for the kitchen. Food comes out very fast. Their dumplings and their pancakes tend to come out after the noodles as it takes longer to cook, but still fast considering the circumstances. Place is clean, and you can tell they put thought into designing this noodle bar. I appreciate the small things such as using mason jars as cups instead of the typical plastic/glass cups. 

As for service, I have nothing bad to say about it. They do their job. They check on you maybe once during your meal which is fine for me. I don't have to say constantly say ""I'm good"" while I'm chewing my food. Plus, the place is small, so it's easy to flag them down if you need anything.

Stopped here on Friday about 7 pm with 3 friends and there were only 2 other patrons sitting in this small restaurant. 

The two waiters (a tall heavyset guy and a slender guy) were standing and talking amongst each other. One of them came to us after a couple of minutes and handed 2 menus (there were 4 of us again) and we sat down. 

Prices seemed reasonable, either $8 for soups or $5 for appetizers, so we ordered about 6 soups and about 6 or 7 appetizers. The heavy set waiter brought our water and the slender waiter brought couple of appetizers. My friend asked if he could have a fork and the skinny waiter seemed bothered by us asking for a fork. Anyways the soups arrived and we were very disappointed. The noodles were chewy and the meat wasn't soft either in the Beef Noodle Soups. The Mongolian Beef dumplings were on the salty side. 
The cucumber salad and the beef wrap were decent. 

Overall, I was debating between 2-3 stars for this location, but the poor service by the skinny waiter and the below average food made me give Noodle Man 2 stars. 

My friends and I will not come back here and will stick with Liang's kitchen where the waiters know how to treat their clients. 

By the way, I made their cucumber salad at home and it was pretty comparable to what I ate at this location. Simply cut Persian cucumbers, add sliced green onion, minced garlic and chili oil and you have their famous cucumber salad. Enjoy!!",94Rqvuq-So0mHFRm-EfPdw,2,0,2,rDkc8eGcbhWp9AHuFGBuzw

Also, 3.50 for a 16 ounce tea with no refills seems steep, but the noodle dishes are only 8 dollars, so I guess the price points balance out. Overall, great food if you don't mind a little awkward staring and rushing you out the door. My advice? Takeout.",w8zIDmVgAFs7xtsN88cQIg,1,0,3,xaBIaAQdhmNWZu0xwvd62A

If you have a large group this may be a issue as most tables are set up for only 2-4 people. They can pull the table together and you can maybe squeeze 6-7 in. The menu was a brochure type. It was easy to read and there were pictures to help out if your unsure what to order. I ordered the wonton soup listed under chefs special. To be honest I was pretty disappointed on the dish. It packed flavor which was very surprising. For the appetizer we had the braised pork and beef fried dumplings both were absolutely delicious. Maybe it was the of day or maybe it wasn't but if you head here don't order the wonton soup.,SD7VNCMv46vdSAE0mQU4Gw,0,0,2,DaIIYwXw3bpVsyJQGR7QuA

BUT Noodle Man is about 5 minutes by car from my house so I know that I'll be here again and again. :)

My favorite appetizer is the vegetable pancake with tofu and egg. . .I got it once. . .and pretty much everytime since then.  Yes I am one of those boring people that can eat the same thing over and over again and still TOTALLY ENJOY IT!  =)  It is DELICIOUS!  Just be careful it is piping hot when they deliver it to your table and DEFINITELY use the sauce that comes with it.  Just adds that touch saltiness that you need.  Just writing about it is making my mouth drool. . .6/5  Yup!  I went there.  =D

I've also had the Wontons in chili sauce and it is good as well. . .I would say 5/5.  And that is as far as I got with the appetizers. . .LOL

I have never had the rice here. . .cuz I mean come on. . .IF you are going to NOODLE Man to eat. . .then it makes sense that you would get NOODLES right?  =)

Anyhow, I have tried numerous items. . .and they are all pretty decent. . .some are a little on the oily side for me but if you can get passed that oiliness at the beginning the oiliness dissipates as you eat more of the broth and the flavors really shine after that.  

I have had B1, B3, B4, C2, C3. . .yes some of them were spicy and some of them were not. . .BUT overall my experience here tells me that their hand pulled noodles are hands down better then the knife shaved ones.  (4/5 Overall for all the dishes)

The hand pulled noodles have a great chew and bite as you eat them. . .the knife shaved ones were on the mushy side for me and I love a great chew in my asian noodles.  So even if the dish comes with the knife shaved noodles, I request the hand pulled ones and they have always accomodated my request.  Service and Ambiance (5/5)

There isn't much seating at all so expect a wait at prime times. Noodle Man is famous for their hand pulled noodles, either in soup or stir fry form. Prices are really good and portions are big.

Looking at the menu, I wasn't really in the mood for anything but I wanted vegetables, so I ordered the String Beans w/Pork Chow Mein. Essentially, it is a stir fried noodle dish with string beans, onions, and peppers. The braised pork is pretty fatty but tender, and the meat is sweet. Overall, the dish is slightly sweet, which is perfect for my tastes. The dish was mainly noodles, so expect a carb heavy meal.

The dumplings were great and you can tell the dough and filling are homemade. The beef and onion pancake was juicy and flavorful with a crisp fried skin. The reason I deducted a star was that the service was a bit lacking. The pan fried dumplings took FOREVER. We had already eaten all the other dishes and still had to wait an extra 15-20 min for them. They kept telling us they're almost ready and we kept having to ask about them. Finally they told us the pan fried dumplings takes 20-30 min to make. We told them we are pressed for time and have a show to make. The owner did make it right by giving it to us in a to go box and comping the dumplings. I told the owner that in the future she should warn customers ahead of time so they can choose their dishes accordingly if they don't have the time. She told me most customers already know this, to which I responded this is my first time here, and it would probably be good to ask and make sure the customers are aware.

The decor of this place is quite comfortable, albeit a very small restaurant, that can seat no more than 30 people.

There were three of us and we ordered a bunch:

1. Spicy and sour beef soup -- which is a traditional hot and sour soup with beef. Taste is barely ok. The soup base is essentially water and not chicken soup ( or beef soup ) based. With that the flavor is greatly reduced.  Portion is quite small but acceptable for a $5.00 price. Grade C.

2. Spicy wonton - this is an awful dish. The wontons are small and are almost meat-less. Dishes of this type rely heavily on the sauce. This sauce is neither tasty, flavorful nor spicy. In addition, the wonton skin is hard and awful. Very disappointing.  Grade D.

3. Beef pancake and Mushroom with Pork pancake. Both are acceptable but not great. Grade C+.

4. Pork dumpling - not remarkable. Grade C.

5. Jia Chiang Mein with knife sliced noodle -- noodle is very good, just the right chewiness. Flavor is OK, Portion is small.  Barely worth a B-.

In general, pricing is very reasonable. Place is comfortable. Service is OK per Chinese restaurant standard. Noodle by itself is good. But the tastiness and flavors are not there. 

If you like a lot of carb and fond of noodle and dumplings, and pricing is a major issue, this may be the  place for you. But if you are looking for something better than the typical noodle house, look elsewhere. 

I have to struggle to offer this place a three star rating.",35sxzW8p-FGCN4_XB78FCQ,0,0,3,mBCExLToRdPxm_CAXzDHIQ

We came here on a Sunday afternoon at around lunch time. Now please be warn if you want seating do not come during a busy time because this place is way too small. Walking in there are about 2 or 3 sets of tables on either side with very little square footage. There is counter seating to sit at with some bar stools. The Restaurant itself had a very cool look to it with the design and decor but man they could've use some more space. 

The open kitchen took up half of the place but it was necessary because it's what makes the Restaurant so unique. You can watch the chef make hand made noodles right in front of your eyes. Plus it gives the Restaurant something most restaurant's don't have, something one of a kind and entertaining. 

With that said the actually food itself was where they some what missed the mark. The noodles are by far the star of coarse but even they weren't that great. Though everything looks and sounds so incredibly good it was just ok. The beef pancakes and the dumpling are totally made in house which should mean that they are to die for but instead the flavors were just dead. They were good and different but they were a little on the bland side. Not much taste and the sauce didn't help much, I had to drown them in soy sauce in fact I had to drown most of my food in soy sauce. The texture and the way they cook it was completely on point but it was just a bit flavorless. 

Same goes for the noodles the good thing about them were that they were made right then and there but besides the freshness there was nothing special to them. I ordered the Braised pork belly with egg and other pickled stuff which I totally should have gotten it with rice because on the knife cut noodles the flavor town was no where to be found. Although the pork chow mein was a lot better as far as having more taste and the  chow mein noodles themselves was off the hook.

I ordered the mango slushie and enjoyed it very much so I know it is that cheap sweet stuff but it wasn't bad how they made it and it was delish! We had left over so we took it home and the next day the food was actually better.

Strawberry Green Tea- $3.50

We started off with the Mongolian beef pancakes which were a mixture of been and onions, a little too oily but they still had a good flavor. My husband ordered the Hot & Spicy Noodles for himself, which he enjoyed a lot, they had ground pork, vegetables, bean sprouts, and lots of chili which made for a very spicy broth. I had the Shanxi Knife Sliced Noodle soup which consists of beef brisket, cilantro, cabbage, and green onions. The broth was very flavorful but the beef was too fatty and I was not fond of the noodles. My boys shared the Zha Jiang Noodles which consisted of ground pork, mushrooms, carrots, cucumbers, tofu, and bean sprouts it was a very flavorful dish and preferred it better than mine, unfortunately for me, they didn't feel like sharing their dish with their momma so I got the leftovers, ha!

We tried the Szechwan chicken with knife sliced noodles, which tasted kind of like sweet and sour chicken. They have a tendency to all stick together, so make sure you mix it well to get it coated with sauce before it gets cold. Also, we tried the Zha Jiang Noodle which were so good. I would definitely get the Zha Jiang noodle again, and maybe try a different flavor of the knife sliced noodles.

2150595,2015-05-18,3,kABF0hYfAEnl166mn1zR1A,"The Skinny: pretty great Mongolian beef pancake, soup noodles and Zha Jiang noodles; their stir-fried dishes(served over noodles or rice) are not quite as good (3.5), service is pretty great and prompt (FYI,  we usually hit this place around 11:30 am) although the male server is the only one who speaks fluent English (4), value: for the serving size and taste,  prices for this quality is pretty great (3.5 bump up to 4).

We stopped by a few times this week for lunch and we're able to try several menu items. Service is fast and friendly for a Chinese place. Seating is also comfortable. 

If you go,  you need to try their Mongolian beef pancake. The wrapper is appropriately thin and crispy,  while the filling was lusciously juicy from the combination of veggies and beef. The vegetable version is also quite tasty with the vermicelli, tofu, leek combo. We also tried the chicken mushroom pancake (it didn't have that much mushroom flavor and I couldn't see any black mushrooms mixed in, texturally also tasted more like ground chicken thigh meat than breast meat) which was okay but flavor wise was a bit weaker than the beef/vegetable version. Pancakes are $5 for 2 and served with some yummy sweet marinated daikon/carrot pickles. 

We tried both the pork pan fried dumplings and the pork wonton in chili oil. For me,  the pork dumpling skin was a bit too thick and lacked the juiciness of the above mentioned pancakes. I would recommend the aforementioned pancakes over the dumplings for sure. The pork wonton were nothing special -  there was minimal filling in each wrapper and the flavor just wasn't there. Skip this dish. 

Their entrees consist of soup noodles or braised/stir-fried dishes served on top of rice/Shanxi knife cut noodles. 

We tried the Lau Zhou beef noodle soup,  the shanxi beef noodle soup, the stir-fried pork and mushroom over noodles,  the chicken/eggplant over noodles,  the pork/green bean lo-mein and the homemade zha jeung mien ($8/dish)

Their strong points are not the stir-fried dishes. Both the pork/mushroom dish and chicken/eggplant dish were both too sweet for my tastes, had too much sauce, and didn't have enough wok hai. I probably would not order these again. We also tried their pork and green bean lo-mein. The pork was pretty well braised and fell apart in your mouth. But again I found it a tad sweet for me. This we may or may not order again. 

Where they shine is the beef soup noodles. The braised beef noodle soup hits the spot with just the right combination of star anise, citrus peel and pepper. The pickles add that last bit of sourness to balance out the dish. Personally I would recommend the Shanxi knife cut noodles over the Lan Zhou noodles. When I had the Lan Zhou noodles,  they didn't seem to be hand pulled but were good nonetheless. The Shanxi knife cut tasted freshly made and gives this dish the edge over the thinner Lan Zhou. 

Homemade zha jiang mien was pretty good with the right amount of sweet/savory flavors and sported real hand pulled noodles when I had this. This is a great summer dish with the mixed vegetables it comes with.

The food here is solid overall and prices are very reasonable for a good tuck in. The space is small,  and I can see how this place may fill up quickly during peak times. The servers were pretty good for a Chinese joint when we went although only the male server seems to speak fluent English.

2192000,2015-11-19,0,kABF0hYfAEnl166mn1zR1A,"My go-to noodle soup restaurant.  I recommend getting the B2 or B3 noodle soup.

B2 Beef Brisket with Tomato Noodle Soup - You won't be disappointed.   The soup is spicy, beefy, and totally flavorful.   The rest of the ingredients were okay (some bok choy veggies, thick round noodles, beef), but the soup makes the dish great.  Not too much meat though.  I haven't found a better tasting spicy beef noodle soup (or similar) anywhere else in Las Vegas.

B3 Shanxi Knife Sliced Noodle Soup - pretty good.  Get if you don't like spicy.  The star of this dish are the knife sliced noodles, which is so very soft and flavorful.  The soup is straight beef flavored.  The soup was near the state of being too salty so if you are sensitive to salt, this soup might be too much.  For me, it was fine.  Lots more meat than B2 included in this entree.

I do not recommend getting the B1 or B4 noodle soup.

B1 Lan Zhou Beef Noodle Soup - Do not order it.  It is very bland and almost tasteless.   (Beijing Noodle Cafe restaurant in the Eastside used to make the best Lan Zhou beef noodle soup, but a change of owners removed that dish from the menu.)

B4 Hot & Spicy Noodle - The spicy taste overwhelms everything.  Soup? Taste like spice.  Veggies?  Taste like spice.  Meat?  Taste like spice.  Don't order this unless you like this particular spice taste (can't identify it).

The portion is decently large and filling; but if you are still not full, you might consider getting an appetizer.   There are a few appetizers not on the menu; ask the waitress about them.  The only one I have tried, which I like, is a medium-sized bowl of black fungus for $3.   The black fungus is a cold mushroom dish seasoned with vinegar and sesame oil (I think).  Eat it plain by itself; do not put it into the soup because that would destroy the taste.   

Parking is plentiful.  The restaurant is a bit small (not a lot of seats) so you are likely to need to wait for a table during the busy times.  Or if there are only one or two in your party, you can sit at the counter.  Service is friendly and quick.

I plan to try the other dishes on the menu and will update this review accordingly.",7E4iVTIsZJu8y_w4_JKg2g,0,0,4,j3JaVPd2q3xL4rJ6g3zDFA

i especially love knife cut, hand pulled, fresh noodles.
noodle man satisfies that craving for me just well enough.

i would say it's ""good enough for vegas"", a statement i dislike very much no matter how true it might be for so many places in town, especially chinese food joints.
although i would love to give it 4 or 5 stars, it just doesn't reach that mark for me.
i've been here quite a few times now and each time something has gone wrong; losing the receipt and making me sign a new one, giving us food from another table, giving us the wrong dish altogether, giving us the right dish with the wrong noodles, etc.
i think the worst was the last time i was there.
i ordered the shanxi knife sliced noodle soup whose description reads ""beef brisket, sweet potato vermicelli, black fungus, pickled cabbage, green onion, and cilantro"", with a picture to match.
when the dish came to me, it was basically beef noodle soup with some chunks of beef and some pickled cabbage.
i mentioned to the server that it was the wrong dish and she replied, ""no, it's the right one. the picture on the menu is not the same"", to which i replied, ""well, maybe the menu should reflect the correct dish then, don't you think"", and she shrugged her shoulders.

my favorite dish here is probably the spicy wontons.

The establishment is very clean and has a great atmosphere,  staff is very friendly and approachable.

During my conversation with the waiter I found out that you can order fried rice even though it's  not on the menu. Also the waiter informed me that there on the process of making to go menu. 

The fried dumpling was yummy especially paired with what tasted like pickled radish which came with the dumpling, braised  pork was also good but as a filipino who eats lots of rice I just would prefer the braised pork to be paired with white rice but still it was delicious and very tender. The only thing that I was not a fan was the spicy soup. It's just probably me because this is the first time trying a spicy soup szechuan style.

I heard all the hype about The Noodle Man and never realize that the restaurant literally less then ten minutes from my house. I have stopped by twice once went for the rice action and second visit went for noodles. All honesty I know coming to The Noodle Man only get rice dish??? Some reason not so much in noodle mood wanted some rice. I ended up getting the chicken curry with rice. It was ok. The curry never really worked for me. I felt like could have been more well balance more depth in the curry flavor. Generous portion size!!! One thing they never cheat you out of not just the rice dishes but all the dishes. The amount of carrots, potatoes, and chicken was awesome. All on nice mound of rice. I started with the Spicy Pork Won Ton. Awesome. Don't be scared by all the oil that won ton sits in. All that oil has so much flavor its unreal. If like kick to your food the Spicy Won Ton great kicker too your meal. I have tried both kinds of pancakes. I enjoyed both of them. Second visit went for the star of the show the noodles. I had the Hot & Spicy Noodles. The dish that was looking at the first visit but went with the rice action. Mistake lesson learned. The whole dish was amazing. I was thinking more like ramen style but learned more about the noodles rather then everything in broth. When you taste the noodles understand why hand made noodles needs no broth. They literally that good!!!!!!!! You see the guys in the kitchen (open kitchen area always fan of any restaurant like the look and always entertaining see the cooks working on your food) pulling, twisting, and it art form just making these noodles. Not only do your appreciate the process. You realize the freshness of the noodles. I can not rave more more more more more more about the noodles. The Hot and Spicy love the meat had nice kick and the all the vegetables especially the bok choy. Warning one bowl can really feed two. Really not much broth it all about the noodles. Noodles that FIVE star period by ITSELF. 

You will be very surprise once you walk inside the restaurant. The outside it located in small strip mall that looks run down. Once you open the front doors see inside very well done the interior design. The whole open kitchen with counter no better way eat bowl of noodles. The asian theme decor on the walls all on point with the restaurant. The service was good. Second visit found it odd they ran out of can soda. 

If you want some noodles. Close to authentic hand pulled noodles. The Noodle Man will not disappoint. It was nothing but a five star winner for me.

Their popular Szechwan-style hand-pulled noodle soup bowl has a pretty boring and one-dimensional flavor: it was just spicy and red and not much else. Pretty unappealing if you ask me.

The first time I came here, they were busy so we decided to go somewhere else. Today, we got the last two seats, right in front of the noodle man. Yay for VIP seating! We were mesmerized by the whole making noodles from scratch process.

We started off with the spicy wontons. It was mostly thick wonton skin and barely any pork filling. The chili oil sauce with the peanuts was good. Just wish it had more filing.

I went with their most popular dish, the beef noodle soup. Honestly, I wasn't blown away. It's not something I enjoyed nor would I order again. It tasted bland and the flavor just wasn't there for me. My husband ordered the sliced pork belly and mushroom knife cut noodles. I liked these noodles and the sauce it came with a lot better than mine. I hate it when that happens. Where you end up not liking your dish but someone else's dish!

As for customer service, the lady acknowledged us immediately so that was a good start. Our dishes came in a weird order. I received my noodles first, then the appetizer about five minutes later, and my husband's noodles about ten minutes later. Our waters were constantly filled so that's a plus.

The decor and atmosphere is cute with the modern Chinese paintings. I like that you can watch noodles being made from scratch. I'll probably be back to get the sliced pork and mushroom noodles and try the other types of noodle dishes.",TS4RfxKny-c8QYcnMpfkiQ,9,7,3,zRG0DZNYJUSnKEAvrylI9g

The Noodle man is a strong 3 stars or a real weak 4 stars...

The fact that noodles at The Noodle Man are made in house is evident in every bite!...They may not be the best fresh noodles in town, but they are certainly very enjoyable and what's more is that they're offered at an amazing price!

The server said this is the only The Noodle Man around, but it felt like a Chipotle style chain that had hired an interior design firm to create a certain look and feel. We were impressed to hear otherwise. My wife and I shared Sliced Pork & Mushroom w/ Knife Sliced Noodle, Spicy Pork Wontons, Chicken Mushroom Pancake, and Tomato & Egg w/ Hand-pulled Noodles. We enjoyed everything! First came the Chicken & Mushroom Pancake that was moist and full of juicy, dripping flavor...everyone enjoys moist, juicy, dripping flavor in their meat pies. The rest of the order came right away and added up to a generous portion of food at a reasonable price.

Lately we've been getting the Tomato & Egg w/ Knife Noodles to-go. Then doctor it up a bit at home with the addition of some black garlic...just a suggestion if you're so inclined.

The food is a very strong 3 stars, but with most of the dishes coming in under $10 you can't beat the value...and this coming from the guy that would typically drive across town and pay more for a better version of similar dishes.

We also had the fried wontons, spicy szechuan beef soup which was good, chicken and mushroom noodle soup this was super bland. I think this was the only item we didn't like.

If you want something with a lot more heat go for either the hot and spicy noodles ($8) or the Chong Qing style spicy and sour noodles ($8). The chicken mushroom pancakes ($5) and vegetable pancakes ($5) were both good accompaniments, especially the latter. I also appreciate that they cut them in half, saving me from making a huge mess at the table by trying to do it myself.

1) spicy pork wontons $6 4/5 sauce was good

2) hot and spicy noodles $8 4/5 great flavor just wished instead on minced pork it was chunky meat

3) chicken and mushroom noodles $8 4/5 love the chunks of chicken and mushrooms but wish the broth was spicier

Adam had the sliced pork and mushroom bowl. Even though he is the biggest fan of mushrooms I've ever seen, he was not entirely happy with his food as there was too little broth and the mushrooms were bland. The pork was very tender and delicious and, of course, the noodles were amazing. 

I wanted to try Adams but I was so in love with my Hot & Spicy noodles. I must warn that I have a higher tolerance for spicy food than most & this dish is a spicy lovers dream!

You have the option of picking the bigger (handcut) noodles or the regular smaller noodles. The handcut noodles are usually more chewy IMO. I didn't see those options on their menu though. They also offer tea options located on their napkin dispensers. 

I ordered the beef brisket with the tomato based soup. I was about to go with their B1 but was told that the soup base was clear. My friend did however, order the B1. Our bowls came out quickly. The brisket was good, but some pieces were a bit touch. The noodles weren't too soft and were cooked perfectly. My friend and I enjoyed the noodles and she liked my soup base better.

**The moment I walked in, the smell of chlorine from the floor cleaner greeted me with a punch. The place is small so the smell lingered for a while. Also, I noticed that the floor was still a little wet and there was no wet floor sign anywhere. Tip to the business owner: Place a sign when you do this or have someone watch the floor to warn people. This is how you can get sued. **

It was a little busy when we went in so it took sometime before someone was able to seat us. We sat at the bar area with a full view of the kitchen. Some people are more sensitive than I am and I understand that. I will let you judge how they cook in the kitchen. I am just here for the finished product. 

Chicken Steamed Dumplings - We ordered these for appetizer. 10 pieces for $6, not too bad. I liked the flavor of the dumplings and goes well with our soup. Next time I will order it as pan fried/fried. 

Shanxi Knife Sliced Noodle Soup - This soup was delicious. It has a mild sweet taste to it reminds me of braised beef. This is basically that with thin flat noodles. The beef brisket was so good. It was soft and flavorful. The only problem with this dish was it was a little harder to eat because the noodles are flat and short. I had a hard time picking it up with my chopsticks. Aside from that, this one was a good choice.

Hot and Spicy Noodle Soup - When they say spicy, they really mean spicy! But even though you get the numbing sensation of the spice, you still get a lot of flavor from the dish. The ground pork that was mixed in with the soup reminds me of an XO paste but instead of seafood, it was made with pork. It was a little salty so I did not drink most of the broth. There was a lot of oil in the broth which I believe was chili oil - that made it even harder to slurp. I would definitely order this again. 

The prices are very reasonable and the portions are big. Definitely a good reason to come back. I am hopeful that they will broaden their menu and offer more selections in the future.",F1_WWxCjdHhMKBjPS9ljvQ,2,2,4,0s958xwG-sT-l4maiw5ESw

2 bowls of noodles, tax and tip $20 out the door and yes this is from the Beijing Noodle Cafe family but now just minutes from where I live.   

As mentioned this place is small and packed  - at some point I could easily see them expanding as every seat was filled.   There's about 4-5 chefs freshly preparing the noodles.  If you've been to Beijing Noodle 9 at Caesars this is the same northern chinese style preparation where you get to witness all the action but you'll be paying a fraction of what you pay at BN9.

As for the noodles, I was in heaven.   We got the Lan Zhou Beef soup which was spicy and jam packed full of delicious, al dente noodles.   We also got the Chicken, Eggplant, and Jalepeno Noodle.  I don't think I would order this again because it was on the sweet side but the knife cut noodles were highly addicting.

And when you throw them in with broth and some mushrooms (a definite must- the mushrooms), you have a satisfying mix of belly happiness. I actually watched, in a little bit of dexterous awe, the cook whip around a batch of them. It was as if he was torturing Stretch Armstrong while doing a Gene Gene dancing machine move. A sight to behold. And it's no lie to say that the noodles were the star of the show here.

The decor is homesy-inspired & wood-themed. I'm guessing it resembles a noodle shop of yore in far-away-when Asia. But, a guess only. It's a cozy place and the cooks are safely held away behind glass. I was pleasantly surprised by the greetings and friendliness. But, if you have a mix of guests, half of which are Asian (and Chinese-speaking, I may add), then the occasional gringo might be a noodle-slurping bit of comedic relief. 

I also like how the menu is sparse. I really despise the menu's that have a thousand and one items, none of which are in English, and only one in four are pictured. My only gripe is that some of the ingredients were a bit over cooked (the pork) and the seasoning was a little off-kilter (overly salted). Oh, and no need to be stingy with the onions.

The food was perfectly prepared and presented.  The tea was very good, too.

My server made sure I was happy and had what I needed.  

As it started to slowly fill up, it was clear they knew how to take care of their customers.   

And the Asian customers all seemed to be regulars.   And too be honest,  that let's me know that the food is really authentic.  Which matters to me, when it comes to Chinese.  

While I have my favorite ""American Style"" Chinese food, I prefer to have dishes that remind me of the dishes I've enjoyed in Mainland China and Hong Kong!   I tried something that many places struggle with Curry Chicken.  It was really good.

So when you walk in, there are the tables and stuff, then you see some glass and behind the glass is the kitchen. There will be this guy stretching out some soon-to-be-noodles and it looks awesome. That's how you know this food is fresh.

They must have changed chefs or something recently, because the food isn't the same. Unfortunately there isn't as much flavor as there used to be. They have expanded the menu quite a bit but because of that, the quality has dropped. I used to get the pork belly and mushroom noodles. The brown sauce it's in lacked that rich, salty flavor I love. They did finally put the cucumber appetizer on the menu though so that's cool. Those are really good. I' not sure what the sauce is that they're coated it, but it's refreshing. Their other appetizers are pretty good too. Everything just tastes fresh and simple. The prices aren't bad either, so that's a plus. 

The place is fairly small, so I wouldn't recommend coming in groups larger than 4. The staff is nice and the place is always very clean. There are seats right by the kitchen window so you can observe the awesome process of noodle making. It's a nice place to sit when you're having lunch or dinner alone.

Yes the noodles and Mongolian beef pancakes were very good. Saddened to say that's about it.

I'm trying to figure out the hype...we walked into the place and it is small - like 8 tables small and bar to watch chefs make noodles is about 8 seats. If you wish to go, do not go during lunch or dinner rush. You will wait a very long time if the place is full.

First thing I noticed was the humidity... Steamy and hot. Poor ventilation and the sun beats down even with the shades on the door which is the only window.

We were told by waitress to sit down and she grabbed two menus and threw them on the table and took off. Few minutes later she took our order. The good news was it was fast!!! Arrived like in seven minutes...

As we sat shoveling the noodles and beef  pancakes in our mouths I noticed most folks were sweating profusely like us- well, at least it wasn't just us.

The veggies were fresh, the noodles were perfect and highlight was the beef pancakes - those were heavenly!

The meat ruined everything. My Hubby's braised pork was pure fat. No real meat! (Flavor was great though... Damn shame!) My ground pork was surely frozen or dehydrated and then cooked in attempt to bring it back to life. Sad.

No kids menu, sweatshop vibe and our waitress never came back until we begged for check.

For noodles, I tried the B3 - Shanxi Knife Sliced Noodle Soup - the broth of the soup was very good and flavorful. Excellent in taste.  So was the meat.

I ended up taking that home.  I brought it to work for lunch and to me, the noodles almost had a almost mushy texture.  Still wasn't bad nor was it good.  But again, that's just me.  I'm sure a lot of ppl would disagree BUT the pancakes I loved.  Must order!

You are immediately greeted and  guided to have a seat at their beautiful wooden table. Love the decor, and the awesome window that showcases their noodle man. 

What we ordered : 

Hot and spicy soup: comes with ground pork, Bok choy, spices and and delicious broth that has a background taste of lemongrass. Not overly spicy. It's just right.  

Beef Burrito: brisket meat with cilantro leaves, green onion and a sweet dipping sauce.  The flour tortilla is perfectly cooked, soft with a slight crisp and bite to it. 'Twas Yummy. 

Spicy Szechwan chicken with shaved noodles: 
Veggies -- green and red bell peppers, and onion. 
Chicken was soft and the spice was -- I'd say 
At level 7+ from 1-10.  If you're into spicy, into chicken and veggies --- this is it.  The spice is incredible. A slight sweetness.  But oh so good. I'll be ordering this one for myself on my next visit here . 

Service: Within 5-8 minutes of ordering, our bowls were served piping hot. Everything was fresh.  The noodles were amazing. Fresh, thick and --sighs--- it was simply delicious.  Very welcoming staff.  Attentive and clean.  It was a yummy, delicious and pleasant visit with The Noodle Man.

The place is really modern and has a clean look. We took seats up at the bar right in front of The Noodle Man himself, watching him forge noodles right before our very eyes; very mesmerizing. 

We started by ordering the Mongolian Beef Pancakes, which were probably better than the noodles themselves! It's basically a mutant-sized gyoza filled with beef and onion with a thicker outer crust, but it's addicting! It's a bit greasy, but the flavors are exceptional!

Moving on to the noodles themselves, they have quite a selection! I ordered the Beef Noodle Soup (B1) because I'm probably the whitest person to ever eat at this restaurant, and my girlfriend ordered the Beef Brisket with Tomato Soup (B2). We both agreed that the noodles were good, but the flavors were a bit lacking. We kept going back to that Mongolian Beef Pancake for flavor, but the two together made an excellent pairing!

Unique in that it is a more traditional variety of Chinese food away from Chinatown, the Noodle Man offers what could be the best beef noodle soup in Vegas. While I prefer the spiciness in the broth at Noodle Pot, the beef here is on par and the noodles are generally better.

At 8 dollars for all the main entrees, this place is a relative bargain. It does get a bit busy at times and there is no suitable waiting area when it's hot outside. Sitting up at the window gives you a fun view when the noodle maker is at work, though honestly the knife cut noodles were a little too thick for my taste. For me, the B2 is the only thing I would get every time here.

If you don't want the beef noodle soup, there is always a pretty solid Chow Mein here. It's definitely different from Panda Express, and they give you a ton of noodles. The only reason I take off a star is that the noodles are a little inconsistent. Al dente one time, a little mushy the next.

Service/environment: You can see that they definitely put an effort in the interior design and decoration. Also, they have an open kitchen so that you can see the ""noodle man"" making fresh noodles in house. However, service-wise, it's only worth 2 stars. 

Food: The food is the thing which really blew me away. We got 1) Lan Zhou beef noodle soup (B1) 2) Beef Brisket w/ tomato noodle soup (B2) and 3) Spicy Pork Wonton (A5). The wonton was just ok but we really enjoyed the other two. The Lan Zhou Beef noodle soup taste very unique (in a good way) and is pretty spicy (which I like). For the tomato noodle soup, the only disappointment is that I wish it comes with real tomatoes. But since the broth already has a nice tomatoes taste to it, I have no complaint. Most importantly, the quality of the noodle is outstanding.

Overall: Being as a Chinese, I can say that the noodle man definitely provides authentic and quality Chinese noodle soups. The place is clean and the price tag is affordable. It becomes my next favorite restaurant when I'm craving for noodles!",m72viQ5BX0dgfMsfPR8AKQ,3,1,4,KGFFtQIYVDC24NB-tre7QQ

My usual order is strawberry black ice tea. Pork wontons. Fried dumplings (we tend to choose beef or chicken cuz we already have the pork wontons).

Love the strawberry black tea because it's like I'm drinking a strawberry soda without the ""too sweet"" factor. I always think about getting the lychee jelly in there but, I think it'll sweeten it up a lot. 

Pork wontons get me every time. No matter how often I eat it --- it just tastes so gooooood. That spicy sesame oil concoction dipping sauce tho is where the magic happens. 
I usually take my fried dumplings and dip it into this sauce!!!!!!! 
Fried dumplings = gyoza (Chinese version) = ALWAYS A GO-TO! 

Spicy noodle sauce is so good, too. Noodles so firm and yummy with the meat. Oddly enough, it reminds me of spaghetti lol (without the marinara).

The restaurant is in a prime location on S Rainbow in the SW of Vegas in the plaza directly across from the Arroyo Shopping Center. This place is jumpin' and has always been packed to the brim during my visits - always a good sign for good eats. The downfall is that this place is tiny. I'm talking itsy bitsy kind of tiny. Expect to be standing in the middle of the entrance/tables waiting for a table to open if you hit them up during the lunch rush. 

The food is good and it's worth trying out at least once. I've visited a handful of times and lunch is hectic with service being very spotty. The noodles, beef shank soup and spicy pork wontons were good and very reasonably priced. I really liked their spicy wontons and enjoyed the richness of broth with their thick and freshly prepared noodles. 

The main attraction for me was watching the noodle man do his noodle thing - stretching, kneading and stretching the noodles again.  On my third visit, I had the opportunity to sit at the bar and get a front row seat to the noodle making and kitchen. I would recommend sitting close to the action. I gained a greater appreciation and perspective of the preparation and labor that goes into their dishes.

I am so happy that a legit noodle spot has opened on the south side. Noodle man serves fresh hand pulled noodles and knife cut with a variety of broths. Both styles of noodles are delicious, however I prefer the knife cut noodles over the hand pulled. 

The restaurant is small but very well laid out. 

The only thing that Noodle Man is lacking in is service. They are not organized and have gotten my order mixed up quite a few times. On multiple occasions main dishes will arrive 15-20 minutes apart in a party of 2 or more. This causes an awkward experience if you're dining with a group. Those who received their dishes can either wait for everyone else's to arrive while theirs gets cold or finish eating theirs and awkwardly watch their friends eat. 

On our last visit the server also ignored our request for no peanuts on our dumplings and refused to remake it because the kitchen was closed...

Service - the servers were a bit unorganized, could be inexperienced. We were offered a table quickly, but we didn't get menus or offered something to drink. The servers were walking around our table cleaning the next table, but no one noticed we didn't have water or menus.

Atmosphere - the inside so far was clean and they built it to have a little bar seating directly in front of the kitchen, like the Side Stands in Asia, which was unique. However, It was stuffy inside and the smell of oil was everywhere. Although cooking smell is great with the spices and all, plain heating oil smell is not too attractive, ventilation needs to improve.

Food - although you see a ""noodle chef"" pulling fresh noodle dough through the glass window, not every noodle dish on the menu was made with hand-pulled noodle. We ordered Jia Jiang Noodle, String Beans w/ Braised Pork Chow Mein, Pot Stickers, Spicy Wonton. Both noodle dishes were not made with any hand pulled noodles, it was normal pre packaged noodles like other Chinese restaurant in the states. Jia Jiang Noodle were OK, the taste is a bit bland compared to traditional Jia Jiang sauce. Chow Mein used the same noodles as Jia Jiang, the sauce was very sweet, too sweet, but the braised pork in it was good. Potstickers had very little pork in it, mostly vegetables, but fried nicely. Spicy Wonton, disappointed. The wontons were tiny and the skin was falling off when we try to pick up a piece. Chili oil was plain, no fried chili shreds in it, which is usually how chili oil for this appetizer should be. They put a lot of black pepper over the scallions and wonton, if it was for the purpose of making it ""spicier"", black pepper IS NOT what should be used.

We may make another visit down the road to see improvements, this is our frist visit and I don't think they've opened too long ago. Traing and smoothing out takes some time.",QtMgqKY_GF3XkOpXonaExA,3,1,2,JoNh7mOTegM3rdyafFxepg

I liked the authentic paintings on the wall and the view of the kitchen - you can watch them making the noodles by hand and cooking all of the individual dishes!

This restaurant is supposed to be known for their freshly hand pulled noodles, so that was my order: C3 - Zia Jiang noodles. It reminded me of a Korean noodle dish where everything is mixed up by the customer.  When I first tasted the ground pork topping, it seemed to be on the sweeter side.  After it was mixed in with the sliced carrots, cucumber, fried egg, and al dente noodles, the flavors were more balanced.  (It did not contain any bean sprouts as stated in the menu.)  I could distinguish the tiny cubes of tofu, mushroom, bamboo shoots, and water chestnuts that were hidden in the brown sauce...yum!

We also got the Mongolian Beef Pancakes.  They were like flattened, fried manapua with a lot of filling and thin outer shell.  It was pleasantly crisp on the outside and warm, tasty, and moist inside.  The bold onion flavor led the way for the ground beef!

I could overlook this because I just gave them the benefit of the doubt as I normally do with things.

The server recommended a good pancake dish that was actually very good, I got the Mongolian beef dish.

When the new soup came, it arrived just as I had asked, without peanuts. The soup was actually rather good, I don't recall what it was called but it was a pork with flour noodle dish, literally the first thing at the top of the menu, but the broth was on the cool side, more like luke warm, I was hoping for the soup to be hot. I actually heard that girl at the table next to me ask the server to send her another one because of the same thing, her soup was more on the cold side.

All in all, the dishes that came out were pretty good, and a few quick fixes of making sure the soup is hot and improving on the service with customers would make this a much better place.

Pork fried Dumplings (8pcs) $8. It was so juicy, and crispy in the outside. Really good. 

Service was efficient and friendly.

Unlike most Chinese restaurants the decor and the service are really nice. The decor is like a contemporary design and does not have a hanging duck in the window. . . Which i actually love.  And the service is actually really polite which is really contrary to most small casual Chinese restaurant. 

I've been here a few times before and had the beef noodle soup but this time I was craving something spicy and got the hot and spicy noodle soup.

I like this place because the noodles are not overly  cooked and the broths are always flavorful. This hot and spicy noodle is super flavorful. It is also a great example of the different contrasts that can be found in one dish.  There is the smooth texture of the noodles the the oiliness and spiciness of the broth, a slight sour taste from the pickled vegetables and of course you can add black vinegar to make it even more sour.

FOOD: The food was delicious! We got the Mongolian Beef Pancake, Chicken and Leek Dumplings, (B2) Beef Brisket w/ Tomato Noodle Soup, and (B6) String Beans w/ Braised Pork Chow Mein. The Mongolian Beef Pancake is a must try. It is perfectly fried with a juicy ground beef and onion middle. It comes w/ a sauce on the side, but the pancake tastes great without it. The Dumplings was also fried well and had a juicy inside. It lacked some taste so I recommend dipping it in the sauce it comes with. 

The Beek Brisket w/ Tomato Noodle Soup was okay. The soup and noodles was really tasty. However, the brisket was dry, overcooked, tough and not good. I am not sure if we just got a bad cut of meat or if this is how they wanted it. 

The String Beans w/ Braised Pork Chow Mein is what really made the meal. If I could get this with a side of the Tomato Soup I would. Its a stir fry dish with incredible chow mein noodles green beans, red/green peppers, onions and braised pork that was fatty and tender. I recommend this dish and the Mongolian beef pancake for a first-timer.

PRICE: This place offers a great value! The food is fresh, house-made, the portions are pretty big and all menu items are less than $10 . For two people, it was $36 for four dishes. 

SERVICE: I read a lot of reviews saying the service was horrible. The lady that took care of us treated us well and we ate at the bar so the chef's in the kitchen smiled at us. 

AMBIANCE:  The place is small with a limited number of tables, so I don't recommend coming here during peak hours or in big groups. Since it's small and everyone's so close, it is a bit loud. There is a bar seating that was cool because you get to see the chef's while they cook and make the noodles. The place appeared clean. 

Overall, I give this place a 4 out of 5. I would come back again, but I wouldn't order the B2 Beef Brisket Noodle Soup or the Dumplings again.

Bright and clean with ample seating. Nothing to complain about the service. 

Menu is simple and straight forward. I should've looked at the menu more but after looking through all the pictures on yelp, I had my eye on B2 which is their Beef Brisket w/ Tomato Noodle Soup. 

""I had my eye on you, you are everything that I see"" 

Took a sip and it was noodle soup on a whole new level. They are on their A game. Soup was rich with prominent tomato flavor that's not over-the-top. Beef brisket was ridiculously and mouth-wareringly (is that a word?) tender. Cilantro was also in the soup, which added a nice kick and a refreshing note to balance the rich soup. It sort of reminded me of Oxtail Soup from California Hotel, but not as oily and heavy. 

Sadly, noodles fell short. Maybe because I am not used to the noodles they serve. I eat a lot of ramen and familiar with Japanese noodles like udon and soba, but this was nothing like it. It had a chew, and made me feel like I was eating strings of rubber. Not a fan of their noodles. Quickly want to mention that  hand-pulled noodle is only served with B3 which is their Shanxi Knife Sliced Noodle Soup. Noodles were a lot thicker and I personally prefer their hand-pulled noodle over the rubber noodles. 

They also sell boba drinks on the side. I have not tried their boba, but did get to try their Lychee Green Tea. Price is comparable to Chinatown boba shops and drink was alright, nothing mind-blowing. I asked them to put less of lychee syrup/sugar and I definitely tasted green tea with a hint of lychee which is exactly how I liked. They are pretty accommodating with any request which I appreciate.

Saddened that it took me this long to come to the noodle man. I love Asian noodles, and I go ga ga for the fresh stuff! 

I had the hand cut noodles with chicken and eggplant. I ordered it without the chiles as my tummy was still in recovery from my last culinary adventure. Therefore, it was sweet. The chilies would have been delicious. Regardless, it was really good. Super flavorful and just chewy enough on the noodle consistency. The eggplant was perfect and still slightly crunchy. I also had a lychee green tea. It was sweet and tasty. We had the Mongolian beef pancakes which were greasy and delectable. 

Hubby had chicken and mushroom noodle soup. It was light but flavorful. It was less unctuous than a ramen so you could eat the whole bowl without getting overwhelmed with umami. 

The were very accommodating to us and our 2 littles, although, I don't think anyone said a word to us. I think we got a nod here and there. It was awesome to watch them make the noodles through the window. Unbelievable how they pull them out so uniformly.

4106871,2015-09-05,2,kABF0hYfAEnl166mn1zR1A,"With my frequent appearances at certain places further down Rainbow Blvd, it was only a matter of time before I tried The Noodle Man.

I happened to dine today with a Taiwanese friend, who quickly pointed out that The Noodle Man is definitely a Taiwanese restaurant. The giveaway was that he saw a Taiwanese news program on the TV mounted in the corner. If I had been more versed in Taiwanese savory cuisine before this visit, I would have been able to arrive at the same conclusion down the line.

I tried several items, some based on specific recommendations, and others because I was sharing the foods with my friend. 

A1: Mongolian beef ""pancake"" (beef, onion, green onion): a recommendation that I did enjoy to an extent. The filling is surrounded by a fried shell, which is nothing like an American pancake. It was pretty good when dipped in the provided sauce, and the pickled daikon and carrot garnish provided necessary flavor variety.

A2: Chicken mushroom pancake (chicken, king oyster, black mushrooms, Hon Shimeji mushrooms): similar to the above, but with a different filling. I actually enjoyed this a little more than its beefy counterpart, and I'm wondering if it could have been because of the beef overload from enjoying the next item (which was actually prepared and presented to us several minutes before the pancakes).

B3: Shanxi knife sliced noodle soup (beef brisket, sweet potato ""vermicelli,"" black fungus, pickled cabbage, green onion, cilantro): gotta have a noodle dish, and this one came highly recommended. I enjoyed it a lot. The broth is lighter than some soup dishes like pho or ramen, but my companion today informed me that it's intentional. Regardless, I certainly loved the fresh broad noodle (vermicelli is very thin, hence quotation marks above), the ridiculously tender beef, and the juicy Chinese cabbage, so I'll have to order this again some time.

C3: Zha jiang mian (ground pork, bamboo shoots, dry tofu, chopped black mushroom, cucumber, carrot, and bean sprouts): a bowl of separate components that you mix at the table for yourself. The noodles aren't as huge as in my order, but you won't confuse them for thin noodles or (gasp) vermicelli. All the components worked, and although the flavors won't punch your palate in the face, they're enjoyable and balanced.

The cheap prices (the pancakes were $5 each, and the noodle dishes were $8 each) are certainly a plus, and the simple decor didn't detract much. I just wish that I'd noticed the bar seating near the kitchen so that I might have had a real show. I'll aim for one of those next time.

Count me in the ""fan"" category rather than the vocal segment of my friends who don't enjoy The Noodle Man as much. Whether it's before or after my visits to sweeter destinations, I'll certainly return from time to time for their authentic, affordable cuisine.

(UPDATE 9/5/15: Yes, I went on back-to-back days. The C2 braised pork & egg w/ broad noodles was actually good. The spicy sliced beef, an appetizer portion not on the printed menu, wasn't too bad. It's actually served cold, which helps to temper the heat a bit. The C1 sliced pork & mushroom w/ smaller noodles was actually underseasoned, and I don't think the soy sauce is a wholly appropriate addition. The A4 fried dumplings, for which I chose the chicken & mushroom filling because they won't allow multiple protein choices per order, were not that great in seasoning for my taste either. So yeah, there could be some truth to the mixed opinions, but I'll still order the B3 again any day and probably the C2 as well.)",_VMGbmIeK71rQGwOBWt_Kg,5,5,4,ySU5JquvcSV6GIdpXVQ7cg

We ordered the pancake, the mushroom chicken pancake, pork belly noodle, dumplings, and the cold noodle.  The dough was too much on the mushroom chicken and the meat was hard and salty.  The noodle was drowned with hot oil.  The dumpling was salty as well.  The only positivd was their pork belly, but the noodle wasn't all that.",O4QYLOps5SGXbeT294Dcjw,0,0,2,rdf6pQJStAz9WNTRWWaPGg

First of all, I can't stand any hot noodle place use cheap chemical/melamine bowl, those melamine bowl are known to release harmful chemical that causes breast cancer when contacting hot temperature over 60C (same thing if you leave your plastic water bottle in the car during summer), they obviously have no pride in their noodle so they use cheap container.  I was having difficult time request my order today, because there's this noodle soup I really want to try but it's super spicy, so I asked the waiter if they can make it less spicy, the waiter immediately responded with an attitude ""No we can't"", so I asked again, if they can just mix other soup with it or less chilly oil or do whatever they can to make it less spicy, he still shakes his head  and say ""No, the soup is spicy already"", I can't stand restaurant don't even showing ANY EFFORT trying to accommodate the customers, I get it, maybe they really can't do it, but they can't even respond nicely and said ""I will ask the chef for you"", what kind of horrible attitude and huge ego was that? their soup isn't even good at all, WAY TOO SWEET, almost like they dumped bunch of sugar in there.

I love that the water comes in a mason jar with ice cold water and ice! Also comes with a Chinese noodle spoon and chopsticks! 

I got the braised pork with 3 different kinds of mushrooms and their handmade thin noodles! I must say, I was super happy with my choice. The noodles were so good and so fresh and the pork was flavored so well along with the yummy mushrooms. It wasn't too salty at all, just perfect! 

The hubby and son got the chicken curry and of course I had to taste it. The curry was a little bit too watery and they filled the bowl with more than half of rice and less curry. Well I guess you don't order curry in a Chinese noodle house. Which is why I gave less stars.

It was naturally busy but thankfully they had a table ready for us despite that we had to wait for our friends to come by. Started with the appetizer - Mongolian Beef Pancake and it did well with my hunger lol. Not too hot on the taste buds and the light sauce it came with was a nice touch as well as the pickled sliced radish and carrots. Main dish was the B2: Beef Brisket with Tomato Base Soup. I did like how the soup base wasn't too overpowering with the tomato, it was just right. The beef brisket was heavenly for a meat lover like me so definitely an A+ on that! :D Lots of cilantro, which I looove!! Noodles are very fresh and I think there was only one or two bokchoy in my bowl as well as a small slice of ginger (which I think is nice because its good for those who are feeling under the weather or have a sore throat - and I just recovered from a sore throat so yay!). Overall the service was great. Had one of the servers accidentally spill a little water on me and a friend but it was no biggie as it didn't ruin the experience. She helped out in the end when a huge spider/scorpion thing was lurking near the entrance (and my friends that sat near there were frantic lololol I'm sorry these arachnids are just fascinating in my opinion XD ) and scared it off out of the store.

Another noodle place in the SW! 

Mongolian beef pancakes...not my thing I guess. It was ground beef wrapped in a noodle skin. I didn't like the flavor and wasn't impressed. I told my husband that I wanted the beef noodles, B1, not spicy of course for this preggo. He wanted some other dish but they didn't understand what he meant when he ordered. I guess that's how you know it's authentic Chinese food. I told him next time just order whatever the number and letter is on the menu. ;)

The noodles were a bit soggy but I liked it. It was spicy so I couldn't eat too much of it because spicy makes my heart burn (joys of pregnancy!).  I thought the flavor was good and I would definitely come back because the portions were a good size! You are actually full and I think that's one of the reason why Chinese food is so dang appealing besides the fact that I am Chinese as well and the cost factor. I was able to go back again some other time and this time they didn't add the spice so I was able to enjoy it more. I don't think that they should put the noodles with the broth when ordering to because that's what causes the noodles to be soggy. Overall, it's a decent place and it's close enough to home so that I don't have to drive down that street where no one can drive aka Spring Mtn.",sa5zd7bwBQzajQB48Y9SUw,5,3,3,vy7tIwrwNQ6kWbiEuNjysQ

Spicy wontons- 5 star. Looooooooooved this dish. It had plenty flavor from the juicy pork inside, to the spicy sauce that was being soaked into the wontons. I'd def come back just for this dish. 

Ching Qing style spicy and sour noodle- 2 stars. Maybe this is acquired taste, but I wasn't digging the sour flavor in the broth. I could do without this dish.

The place is chic with Chinese drawings on their wall and a glass enclosure to see your noodles being made. It is not very big- less than 10 tables plus some seats at the bar facing the chefs. The food isn't of superb quality, but it won't give you that post MSG- post oily Asian food- post where did that meat come from- feeling. The Noodle Man felt ""safe"" to me. The waitresses were extremely friendly and were patient- something I sadly find rare at many of the Asian food joints I frequent. 
I haven't Szechuan noodles before, thus I'll describe everything in terms of food that I know for those people Szechuan virgins like me. 
A1: Mongolian Beef pancakes= beef in a deep fried, oily breading. Good, but too much of it may make you hate your life after. It was similar to a moist deep fried gyoza. I think I'll pass next time. 
A5: Spicy Pork Wonton =  Yes, yes, yes! Small portion, but worth the price. It wasn't as spicy as it looks in the picture. 
B1: Beef Noodle soup = similar to Vietnamese pho but with a little more flavor and no sricha? Clear broth, lots of noodles, little veggies/meat 
C1: Sliced pork and mushroom = Option of brown or white rice. It was my favorite out of the dishes we ordered. Similar to gyuudon, but with an softer meat.

Yet the Noodle Man is a perfect Lucy - each and every visit, pulling the football away at the last and final moment.  

I was so excited to learn about the Noodle Man as it is very close to my work and, come on, hand pulled noodles.  What's not to like? 

On my first visit, I ordered the hand pulled noodles, pork, and mushrooms in broth.  They say part of the culinary experience is presentation and the Noodle Man made no mistakes in that regard.  The look of the dish was delicious to the eyes and immediately made my mouth water.  And then, the first taste came and went without a notice.  What?  How is that possible?  A second taste and bam!  Charlie Brown on his back, Lucy laughing holding the football from him.  The dish was just... Meh.  No flavor whatsoever.  Totally bummed.  Regardless of the lackluster experience, I chalked this up to an anomaly and vowed to return once more. 

On my second visit, I ordered pork belly and knife cut noodles.  I was sure the taste would come through and I would find a new favorite restaurant for lunch.  I brought the dish back to my office and my mouth watered all the way back to work in anticipation of what I knew was to be amazingness.  When I finally dug in I was supremely let down. More of the same nothingness from a taste perspective.  How could this be?!  I literally threw the dish away after several bites, defeated.

This brings me to my third and final visit.  I was determined to find the blast of tastes that I knew lived at Noodle Man but had eluded me, so I ordered red pepper pork and noodles in broth.  Same quick trip back to the office, same mouth watering anticipation. After one bite I was pleased to find some heat, but it was oddly not appetizing.  I continued with the dish thinking the taste would come but it did not.  On my fifth or so slurp of noodles the Noodle Man's fate was sealed.  An unfortunate drop of red pepper juice lingered at the bottom of a noodle in mid-slurp when it got flung upwards into my eye!  

Holy hell the pain was exquisite.  I ran to the bathroom and put my head under a facet with cold water running across my face and open eye.  As I tended to my wounds (physical and emotional) I knew... The Noodle Man was dead to me. Good bye Noodle Man.  I wanted so much to love you.",UiDrd543nY76Ze1E-jASdg,5,4,2,-zel_ycMYyNSrYAx2yyP0w

Today I chose The Noodle Man since it is close to the vicinity to where I live; I do not like traveling far for food unless it is something really amazing. When we arrived during lunch, most of the tables were filled, we got to choose where we sat and were given menus right away. 

We asked the waiter what was the most popular, and he recommended a few dishes, although when we inquired about C3 - Homemade Zha Jiang Noodle, he said not to order that, not once but twice. There seem to be an language barrier with the waiter; he was not understanding questions or at least pretending not to understand? If you're waiter and cannot understand easy terms when taking orders, maybe you should not be waiting. 

The decor was playful and clean. I liked the feel of the restaurant, like it was a modern noodle house with a small Chinese flare. 

We ended up ordering- 

A1- Mongolian Beef Pancake- This is your standard beef pancake that you see at a lot of Chinese street vendors, they place it on a plate with a side of pickled veggies and soy sauce. I think I've had better in NYC in a food truck, but it is worth the try if you wonder what a beef pancake taste like. 

A3- Spicy Pork Wontons- This dish was delicious, salty and spicy but came together with the chili oil/peanut sauce. The peanut sauce gave it a buttery finish (something I usually don't like but enjoyed this dish), the scallions on top also made the dish very delicious. 

Last thing we ordered was B4- Hot and Spicy Noodle (pork) - I was a little disappointed in this dish considering, the waiter said that it was one of the most popular dishes ordered. The sauce was minimal but the noodles were fulfilling, the vegetables seemed overcooked and again there was a peanuts everywhere with an overall peanut finish (peanuts not my thing). Overall I would give this dish a 3, Monta Ramen has something similar that is executed better. 

The service was good and they were all attentive with refilling waters and making sure everything was okay. I would come back only if I needed to quench my noodle craving and wouldn't want to drive all the way to Spring Mountain.

The location at 215/Rainbow is pretty easy to access in this busy part of town. We arrived around 6 on a Saturday evening and the restaurant was quickly filling up. There are about half a dozen tables and then bar style seating around the kitchen area. 

We chose to sit at a table and were quickly greeted by a waitress. She grabbed drink orders and then a male server arrived to take our food order. Throughout our meal both checked in on us and provided friendly and attentive service. 

The menu isn't huge, but still offers a nice variety of options to choose from. There are several noodle soups and noodle entrees. There are several good appetizer options like spicy wontons, beef pancakes, and dumplings. Pricing on all items is very reasonable and overall is an inexpensive meal option.

We started with Beef Pancakes which we both loved. They were full of meat with a little onion in a doughy yet crispy shell. I went with the Hot & Spicy Noodle for my entrée. It was tasty and loaded with noodles and spice. The portion was huge, enough that I ended up taking the rest home. My husband had String Beans w/ Braised Pork Chow Mein. He loved this dish and I enjoyed what I tasted of the dish. It had plenty of the veggies and meat with a nicely flavored sauce.",3nIuSCZk5f_2WWYMLN7h3w,7,3,4,RAvVV0eWphb4290pB4tywg

4424507,2015-12-28,8,kABF0hYfAEnl166mn1zR1A,"I fear I may have become too ""Westernized"" to enjoy The Noodle Man. All the times I've mocked my overly white wife for her fastidious palate when it comes to foreign cuisine...I have in this instance, become that which I mocked.

SZECHUAN PEPPERCORN is used profusely here in their chili oils so beware of the tingly numbing sensation that comes along with it.

My first visit to The Noodle Man was to try their 

CHILI WONTONS - which the thought itself made my mouth water. I thoroughly enjoyed every bite and almost ordered a 2nd round. Instead, I opted to get the 

Zha Jiang Noodles - I was not a fan. I tried the same namesake noodles at a different restaurant but these were very different and I didn't enjoy the strong mushroomy flavor at all. The manager noticed I barely touched my bowl and offered to take the item off my check.

The second visit was with my daughter who has a keen sense of ordering the right thing. She opted for the 
B6 String Bean & Braised Pork Chow Mein - a winner. The noodles had a nice chew with a tasty sauce to accompany it. There could have been more string beans as the dish is called but very good nonetheless. The large pieces of pork belly are good if you are a pork belly lover.

I again opted for an order of chili wontons, which seemed different this time. They were drowned in the mouth numbing chili oil that lacked the initial flavor I enjoyed during my first visit.

The third visit was last night with ""Whitey"" (lol) and I encouraged her to get the B6 noodles, which she enjoyed.
This time I opted to get the 
Hot & Spicy Noodle soup - I took 2 bites of the sour, spicy concoction and had to send it back. The Szechuan peppercorn mouth numbing sensation was not redeemed by a flavorful broth I so wanted to experience. It was rather bland and suffocated under a mound of these peppercorns. I felt bad sending it back but the manager was very understanding and let me swap it out for what I should have ordered in the first place...the B6 chow mein.
Based on all the positive reviews and the great service, don't take this Westernized girl's review to heart if you are a fan of what I imagine to be ""authentic"" Chinese noodles. The customers I observed seemed to enjoy their numb noms :)",bzU8Cl6B9nqV1i5NReobvw,14,10,3,EYvVgwWTRXU8HxuMVzkpdA
4447903,2017-03-16,10,kABF0hYfAEnl166mn1zR1A,"Oy. Not sure what all the hype is about.

I've been wanting to try The Noodle Man for quite some time now. I've came across it several times on yelp, heard about it from coworkers, and was finally able to check it out for lunch a few weeks ago.

For a Friday afternoon it wasn't very busy. It's a small restaurant in a plaza located on Rainbow right off the 215. There's a few tables and bar seating where you're able to look into the kitchen and watch the cooks hand pull noodles and whip together various dishes. 

Service:
Pleasantly surprised by the service! The server was a small female and she came by right away with waters (digging the mason jars) and provided menus. She went over a few cold dishes that were not on the menu and took our order. She was very attentive and stopped by frequently to refill our waters and asked twice throughout our meal if we were enjoying everything. Super friendly service!

Food:
Not impressed (besides the cucumbers). The only reason why I didn't give The Noodle Man 4 or 5 stars.

- Spicy Cucumber Salad
My favorite dish ordered. Cold, refreshing, with a hint of sour and spice. There's some minced garlic and black pepper to add flavor and chopped green onion in the dressing. It reminds me of a refreshing Korean side dish and I would love to know how to make this delightful cucumber salad!

- Spicy Pork Wontons 
I had to order this from the pictures I've stalked out on The Noodle Man's yelp page. Small steamed pork dumplings swimming in a chili oil sauce. Topped with peanuts, green onion, sesame seeds, and black pepper. The flavor wasn't bad but not memorable. The dumplings weren't as tender as I would have preferred for steamed dumplings either, I had to do quite a bit of chewing...

- Sze Chuan Style Cold Noodles
Hand pulled noodles topped with shredded carrots, cucumbers, green onion, and peanuts - with a spicy sesame based sauce. It's a cold dish that I've been searching for at Chinese restaurants in Vegas but am unable to find a good place where the dish tastes decent! Unfortunately The Noodle Man has me continuing on my search. Bland would be an accurate description for this dish.  

- Hot and Spicy Noodles
Hand pulled noodles in a spicy hot broth. Noodles are topped with ground pork, pickled/fermented veggies, peanuts, and green onion. This noodle soup I also had to order after stalking out the photos on their yelp page (why are the pictures so deceiving??) Being honest, I have nothing to compare these noodles to as I'm not familiar with Chinese noodle soups... So based off my taste buds it was pure meh. I enjoyed the heat of the broth but it was not anything special in flavor. The pickled veggies were the most exciting part and gave the noodle soup some character. I don't find myself craving or ordering this again though. 

Overall:
- 5/5 for the service 
- 5/5 for the spicy cucumber salad 
- 2/5 for the Spicy Pork Wontons and the Hot and Spicy Noodles 
- 1/5 for the Sze Chuan Style Cold Noodles

If I were to return, I'd definitely order the spicy cucumber salad and maybe try a different noodle soup. Not sure if I plan to return unless I'm with someone who's dying to go.",WJhQpdUHoFCtpU6gHFjVlQ,17,10,3,1j7-WH9cDYZ98bxNEcwhiw

Food is in a completely different level of its own when it comes to noodles.  5/5
Customer service, 4/5 if you don't speak the language, but the waiters and waitress is still very attentive and patient at explaining the menu and make recommendations for you. 
5/5 if you do speak the language, very nice talk and discussion with the waiter/waitress regarding hometown food. 
Ambience: it's a fairly small place but cozy. I could enjoy better without the music though. If you like quiet like me 4/5 if you like background music while you eat then 5/5.
Price: I think Yelp gave it a fair rating for prices 1$, it doesn't cost much to eat food this good ($10 and under).

The noodles here, as the name suggests, are made in house. You can see them twirl the noodles in the kitchen and before you know it, it's in your bowl. The ""chew"" you get from fresh noodles is something special when done well and this place is no exception. 

The decor is very dark and slightly intimate feeling. It boasts a very welcoming ""street vendor"" kind of look. Where you can pull up and order a great bowl of noodles with no frills. Service is alright, nothing to write home about - but is quick and efficient. 

& the food; I got the tomato and beef brisket noodles. But I also tried bites of the hot and sour beef soup. The soup comes out piping hot, with large pieces of meat in a large bowl. The noodles are definitely the star of the bowl with everything else playing a supporting role. The brisket held their shape but melted in my mouth. The soup is super savory and deep in flavor. BUT I think the hot and sour soup (if you're a fan of it without the noodles) was better. The hot and sour soup familiarity with beef thrown in and the chewy noodles. Great match. For those not familiar with hot and sour soup, it is exactly what it sounds like. Slightly spicy, slightly sour, mixed with a deep beef flavor. It's a literal party in your mouth.

For starters, we ordered the Spicy Pork Wontons and Mongolian Beef Pancake again. The wontons were just unenjoyable. The flavor was meh and there was NO SPICE. I don't eat fire, but if something says it's spicy, I expect a little kick. The pancake was pretty good though.

We tried three entrees: C1 Sliced Pork and Mushroom with Knife-Sliced Noodles, C2 Braised Pork and Egg with Rice, and B1 Lan Zhou Beef Noodle Soup. The first two dishes had the same braised pork belly and though dry, it had a decent flavor. I didn't mind either of these dishes, but they just fell flat with no flavor dimensions. The same could be said about the soup. We added a little vinegar, but it wasn't enough to help. We definitely could've used some chili sauce/oil.",TdYKJgSgY2GF_YJnwsi5yQ,11,5,2,S4arczlrXJUc4BzLHNRhAA

Spicy Wontons - SOOO GOOOOODDD!  They're smaller than regular wontons, but HUGE on flavor.  Plus, for the price you get a healthy portion.  

Hot & Spicy Noodles - Super tasty, good amount of heat.  My only knock, but it's the same with most noodle dishes the ground beef is that it's hard to get the beef to in every bite of noodle.  

The flavors of the spicy wontons and hot/spicy noodles are actually a little similar, but both are delicious.

They do it right in front of you, of course in their kitchen, but you can still see they are dancing with the noodles. I really like their noodles, I like thick noodles to begin with. I don't think they make thin noodles. 

Their broth is a little too oily for me, I'm used to broth that has similar texture to pho. Anything that is thicker or more oily than that isn't my thing. My least favorite part is the chunky meat pieces. It's just so big, so chunky. It's stuck to my teeth. I like meat that is thinly sliced, so it doesn't drop to the soup, and it splashes on my shirt everywhere. 

Wait is a little long during lunch time. But watching them making noodles is pretty cool and relaxing. However, rainbow is a super busy street, getting there is a problem already.",NXn0RBMGCkKN_lIy7vkmIw,3,2,4,92-YzmXk26cwCTXou-oXtA

One of the best things about this location is the proper display window of freshly made noodles and the open kitchen concept.  The décor is also much nicer, although there are less seats available.  We went on a Wednesday evening around 8 pm and by the time we left, every table was occupied.  

Our favorite go to item is the spicy pork wontons. (I've tried a similar place in town and prefer The Noodle Man's version more.)

First off, the soup came first and it was not very hot. Now, I normally do not like my soups steaming hot but this was definitely room temperature. The noodles was nice and chewy. The soup was underwhelming in taste... I expected it to be very spicy. Very much like Sichuan and peppercorn usage, this did not give that feeling. Reminds me of a spicy beef stew noodle soup from Taiwan. I just wished there was much more of a memorable element to the food.

I also tried the Mongolian beef pancakes which are basically large-scale pan fried dumplings. They were good and juicy but way too oily! The spicy wontons are alright, I do wish it was actually spicy.

When I find a Chinese restaurant that serve up non American-Chinese offering, I'm curious as to how far off the Main Street America its dishes are. Noodle Man surprises with both authentic and controlled spices that could appeal to a wider customer. It was pleasantly surprised to see half of the customers were non-Asians considering the spices used in their noodle soup. Actually saw a table of 3 biker dudes slurping down bowls of hand made spicy noodles - kudos to them for being adventurous.
Tomato beef noodle soup is very well done. Controlled flavors - no spices that punches your gut and taste bud. Tomato and stew beef mixed well, in a bowl of hand made noodle, bathing in a broth that's rich in beef stew flavor and a hint of five spices. Ordered a bunch of different types of beef, chicken pancakes, these were panfried nicely, crispy skin with juicy meat fillings.  
Responding to Yelpers saying pan fried items are full of grease. The meat filing is usually 75% lean meat and some fat, so it doesn't become dry during the pan frying process. The oil some have complained, is juice from the meat stuffing; it helps the dough stay soft and crisp during the pan frying.  Ethnic food aren't always appreciated by all. But Noodle Man takes hand made noodles, spicy stew, and strikes a pleasing balance. It's a 5 in my book.",2HNU4vNP8c_EtWG4MhlVVw,0,0,5,pwmQLS2sefe_owPs5bCyuQ

Items I have tried:

Shanxi Knife Slices Noodle Soup $8 - I think this is their most popular dish and I understand why.  It is filled with beef brisket, sweet potato vermicelli, black fungus, and pickled cabbage.  This is not spicy at all, but you have to like a salty and pickled vegetable flavor.  The brisket is beautifully cooked and the hand cut noodles are the perfect consistency.  If you could only try one dish, this would be the one.

Lan Zhou Beef Noodle Soup $8 - Just the right amount of Szechuan spice for me.  The flavor of the broth and meat came through wonderfully and if was craving something spicy I would reorder this again

Pork Wontons in spicy chili oil $6 - If you have the extra room in your stomach; this is a great appetizer/side dish.  You get a quite a few wontons to share easily with a group of three or four people and the meat is super tasty.  The spicy chili oil is a perfect combo with the wontons!

Hot and Spicy Noodle $8 - I thought I could handle spicy food, but apparently I can't hang.  The first few bites of this dish was amazing, but I had to tap out from drinking too much of the broth because it was just too spicy for me.  If you really like spicy, you will like this dish because it is jam packed full of flavor, but it is some serious spice.",QfFQvV6tcSg2cnbZORK3sg,1,1,5,IAjgWSB2LpNJa6htpjKpNA

Hubby was feeling under the weather & I thought maybe some hot noodle soup would be the elixir he was needing. 2 of our boys tagged along. 
An older lady that I'm assuming is the owner took our initial order for some appetizers. She suggested a Chinese black fungus dish & cold cucumber salad. Both were absolutely delicious & I am now looking for recipes to make the black fungus at home. We also ordered 2 other appetizers; the Mongolian beef pancakes & pan fried potstickers. I imagined the pancakes to be similar to a meat pie we used to love at a hunan restaurant in SF based on reviews. Not even close. It was so greasy, oil actually poured out of it when I took a bite. The filling was beyond bland that not even soy sauce (the only dipping sauce available) could help it. The potstickers were equally as greasy & they also didn't come out until we were at least half way done with our main courses. 
Both boys ordered the B6, I ordered the B5 & hubby ordered the C3. I was completely underwhelmed with my soup. The noodles should have been better seasoned, they really had no flavor to speak of & I had to add vinegar, soy sauce AND some of the leftover sauce from both cold appetizers for the broth to be acceptable for my taste buds. The chicken also had a strange texture, kinda mushy. 
Everyone else said their dishes were good. Nothing spectacular but good enough. We also all agreed that this wouldn't be a place we'd be rushing to go back to in the foreseeable future.",4dSX2TsK3jF-g8HzIpYGrg,1,1,3,WJz6dWTKFNu4bzPZtTLiNw

Okay, on to the food. We ordered the potstickers (pork), Mongolian beef pancake, pork wontons, and mushroom chicken noodles. The potstickers were good but could have been left in the pan a bit longer, it was only very lightly browned but the skin was homemade and pretty good. The Mongolian beef pancake, more like Mongolian burger was really good, with the skin pan fried to a crunch. Both the wontons and the mushroom chicken noodles had a bland soup base but otherwise were just okay. The mushroom chicken had a nice savory taste with handmade noodles, the wontons were mini wontons, both served with a bland soup. WIll want to go back and try their other noodle dishes.

Angry that we waited SO long to try this place!!!!!

I've had The Noodle Man bookmarked for a couple months now, shortly after they opened, my fella said ""We should go here sometime.""  
Every time, till yesterday, sushi has always won. 

So, we walk in, and the place is packed, but there is seating at the bar.  

I would sit here every time!  You get an awesome show watching the Noodle Men make your noodles!  I loved watching them do the knife cut noodles.  Such amazing technique!  

We ordered: 
The Mongolian Beef Pancakes: pancakes stuffed with Beef, Onion, and green onions.
The Lan Zhou Beef Noodle Soup (B1): Beef shank, radish, chopped green onions, and cilantro.
The Shanxi Knife Sliced Noodle Soup (B3): Beef brisket, sweet potato vermicelli, black fungus, pickled cabbage, green onion, and cilantro. (Mine also had bok choy.)

The Mongolian Beef Pancakes were amazing.  Sitting at the bar, we were able to watch them as they were prepared, and to be honest...we smelled the first!  They smell amazing as they're being cooked, and they taste even better!  Flavorful, and well cooked, these are a winner. 

As for the soups:  WOW.
Fella's was the B1, which is spicy.  Now, I'm not a fan of Beef shank, but this was cooked really nicely.  It had a lovely heat, not too spicy.   The noodles were great, and reminded me a little bit of a cross between ramen noodles and pho noodles.  Really nice chew. 

Mine was the B3, the Shanxi knife sliced noodle soup.  So, first of all, watching the Noodle Man actually slice the noodles from shoulder height into the water with just a knife...that was cool.  And I know its hard, because I watch Bizarre Foods, and Andrew Zimmern tried and failed.  
In the soup, there was tender beef brisket, which reminded me of my grandmother's pot roast.  The pickled cabbage was awesome, but let me tell you about the broth!  It was almost a beefy tomato flavor, and I could just drink this all day long.  
The noodles were amazing.  Thick, chewy, slurpable...I was SO pleased with this soup.  

Service was amazing.  Super polite, and very quick. 

The Noodle Man is a winner in my book, even though I desperately want to call it Mr. Noodle, like the late Michael Jeter's character from Sesame street.   I can't wait to go back, and to take all of my noodle loving friends.",renPzRDqMZpMaHiCD_e1_A,5,5,5,OLgqpaCd8MWb2uLvsynkiQ

Not especially sold on ""noodle soups,"" even during a time where people form hour-long lines for Ramen and whole books are written about the history of Pho, it was with six adults plus two children that nearly half the seating at The Noodle Man was filled on Saturday, the results rousing hope for an entire genre of food as friendly service nicely compliments a kitchen offering both dinner and a show.

Known for its housemade noodles, a glass partition separating the modern dining room from cast-iron pans, woks and boiling water while those sitting at the counter are face-to-face with Chefs whipping Noodles around and slicing the dough by hand, the menu reads rather simply with three pages divided into ""Appetizers,"" ""Knife sliced Noodles or Rice"" and ""Noodles / Chow Mein,"" though the amount of variation on these concepts covers a wide range of tastes.

Not claiming any particular expertise as relates to Asian Noodles, only one in the group having previously visited the small restaurant just south of the 215 on Rainbow Blvd, it was with the opinion of several ages and ethnicities weighed that a total of eight items - some in double portions - were selected to covering each of the menu's sections, the total bill of just $112 when accounting for tax plus a sizable tip.

Acknowledging a limited tolerance for heat, the chunky Pudding Milk Tea with light Caramel notes a good choice for quelling Chili Oil and Szechuan Peppers used in bowls such as the tangy Chong Qing Style Sweet Potato Vermicelli with ground Pork and Peanuts that was amongst the meal's most satisfying plates despite substantial difficulty in transferring the slippery glass noodles to share bowls, another great opening dish was the pan-seared Chicken and Mushroom Pancake with pounded Breast layered atop a blend of Fungus with a slight Iodine note from the Hon Shimeji Mushrooms.

Not particularly sold on the Vegetable Pancake or the Potstickers, both skipping the 'easy' method of deep frying in favor of a wok but still coming across as too oily for my tastes, it was back to the bowls that attention was turned for the wide ribbons in a complex Broth of cubed Pork Belly, Black Fungus, and the same Mushroom blend as the Pancake, each mouthful offering a slightly different experience and thus preventing a huge portion from becoming monotonous.

Finding the Spaghetti-like Hot & Spicy Noodles a touch redundant to the superior Chong Qing Style, though the pickling spices did make for an interesting contrast to the spicy ground Swine with crispy Bean Sprouts dialing up the texture, String Beans with Braised Pork Chow Mein came across almost sweet as fermented soy slicked more thick nuggets of Pork tossed with Potatoes, Onions and Peppers, the Chicken and Eggplant Knife Sliced Noodles another big winner as the each springy mouthful saw a good deal of heat foiled by roasted hunks of Eggplant, diced Tomatoes, Jalapenos and soft Tofu.

FOUR STARS:  A bit more limited than some of Chinatown's best, but nonetheless doing some really interesting things in a part of town where authentic Ethnic Cuisine is only beginning to be found, The Noodle Man is worth a visit for everyone from the Noodle obsessed to the novice or skeptic, though visiting with a large group is certainly recommended.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,6,4,4,CPnWClAtCRXvcUZHPW7pDg

5307727,2015-07-13,1,kABF0hYfAEnl166mn1zR1A,"My family and I had such an inadequate experience here. It was disappointing. In summary, the items served differ from the menu. 

The service was terrible. Waiting was a big part of the experience here. We waited way too long for menus, drinks, utensils, food, boxes, check etc. They need to chat with the servers at Monta and see how it's done. The restaurant was at 50% capacity, if that. 

I was particularly annoyed with the drink menu being handwritten on a napkin holder. That's just silly. 

We ordered quite a few things:

Mongolian Beef Pancake
Chicken Mushroom Pancake
Spicy Pork Wontons
Szechwan Style Cold Noodle
Beef Brisket with Tomato Noodle Soup
Pork Wonton Soup
Szechwan Chicken

I don't think anyone was impressed. Though I did enjoy my father's Szechwan Style Cold Noodle. It was actually spicy. They strayed from the menu description however, and included peanuts. I would ask for it without, if I ever return.

But the reason for the poor rating is that my dish, Szechwan Chicken was nothing like the description or photograph displayed on the monitor (shredded chicken, carrot, bell peppers, black fungus, and bamboo shoots). My dish contained chicken, eggplant, and bell peppers. It was not spicy either.

So I ask one server if this was Szechwan Chicken and she hurriedly replies, ""Yes."" After eating a little more, and still being confused, I ask another. The other server rudely says, ""Yeah, well, we changed the menu. It has those ingredients now."" 

You can't change ingredients like that without notifying customers. What if someone was allergic to eggplant? At least be a little sympathetic that my dish was totally something unexpected and offer me another choice.",6qTJVWJ9RmVuoHi1CNcb_g,3,1,1,C1CWExCeQEcBSoqs6Pjl5g

We ordered Lan Zhou beef noodles soup, beef brisket with tomato noodles soup & chicken mushroom pancakes.  The Lan Zhou noodles soup served with clear beef broth, top with thin sliced beef shanks.  It tasted a little bland compared to the tomato beef soup, well it wasn't fair, because soup bases were different, the clear broth supposed to have more delicate flavor while the brown broth should be more intense. 

 While the beef brisket with tomato noodle soup served with brown beef broth tomato base, more like a beef stew soup with chunky briskets. Both beef soup was very light and seasoned to perfection.  The chicken mushroom pancakes was very juicy however it did have a little gamey aroma.

5349084,2015-06-18,5,kABF0hYfAEnl166mn1zR1A,"The Noodle Man gets a solid 4.5 stars from me.

I've been to the Noodle Man maybe five times now, not to mention three out of the five was within a week. When I first heard about The Noodle Man, I just had to try it. Hand pulled noodles?! That's like a lost art in Las Vegas! 

The establishment is quite modern with decor that you would never expect. They have bar seating and table seating. The bar table revolves around the open kitchen where you can see the chef hand pull the noodles or use a knife to slice off a ball of dough to make the knife cut noodles. The bar is definitely a great place to sit if you want to watch it all! 

Their menu is quite simple. It's only about three pages with about .. 7-8 items on each page. Are you a person who has trouble making decisions? Are you a person that takes FOREVER to decide? Well, it won't take you forever to decide here, I hope. 

Let me tell you what I've had:

I've tried A1 - Mongolian Beef Pancake, A2 - Chicken And Mushroom Pancake, and A3 - Vegetable Pancake. I didn't care too much about the meat pancakes. They just didn't really tickle my taste buds. The vegetable pancake was my favorite but I just wish they put more leek in it. Other than that, I simply LOVE the exterior to the pancake. I think they make the dough in house so the wrappers were exceptionally yummy. Crispy with a little chewiness. 

A4: Fried Dumpling (Pork w/ Leek): Not as good as the pancakes. I didn't like it. 

A5: Spicy Pork Wantons: Pretty good. The wantons are smaller than what I'm accustomed to. The chili oil and the spices that they use have a little numbing affect to it. Don't get this if you can't handle the spice. It has a decent amount of heat. Great for sharing though! 

I've tried all of B1 - Lan Zhou Beef Noodle Soup, B2 - Beef Brisket with tomato soup, B4 - Hot and Spicy Noodle, B5 - Chicken with Mushroom Noodle Soup, and B7 - Hot Pepper Shredded Chicken Chow Mein. 

My favorite has got to be the beef brisket with tomato soup. It has amazing flavors to it and the beef is so tender! The lan zhou beef noodle soup is what we call ""ching"" in Chinese, which means it's clean. In American terms, it could be described as bland. It's quite light in flavor with a splash of chili oil on top. The hot and spicy noodles contain the same oil and same spice as the spicy pork wantons. So after a while, I got a little bit bored of the flavor, not to mention getting a little annoyed at the numbing spices. The chicken with mushroom noodle soup reminded me of something my mom would make at home and also quite light in flavor... and the hot pepper shredded chicken chow mein is not chow mein. It is more like lo mein. But it was DELICIOUS.

In all honestly, no matter WHICH noodles you go with, it won't matter. The star of the show is their noodles. Their noodles are always al dente and perfect. Almost always anyways. There has only been one time where the noodles were soggy. But definitely worth a try.

They have flavored teas as well, which are pretty good. They are not syrup heavy which earns ++++'s from me! 

As for the service, I never really got bad service. Sometimes they are quite busy and can't get to you right away. Just wave! One of the servers there now recognizes me and she's always friendly with us when we go!

5361275,2015-05-09,7,kABF0hYfAEnl166mn1zR1A,"**Summary**
       - Decor - I really like the modern Asian feel. The fact you can see the chefs through the glass is pretty cool. Especially when they are making noodles.
       - Service - Perhaps, my experience is the outlyer, but I had the worst display of service in my life from this restaurant.
       - Noodles - It's awesome to watch them make it, but the noodles had very little taste. It's a great gimmick, but poor execution.
**Ordered**
       - $6 Spicy Pork Wonton - Salty, but good.
       - $8 Beef Brisket w/ Tomato Noodle Soup - Beef was tender, but a bit salty. The noodles in the broth had a little flavor, but were mostly tasteless.
       - $8 Braised Pork & Egg - Pork belly was also a bit salty, but very good. Fork tender and bursting with flavor. Unfortunately, the lack of broth had these noodles even more tasteless than the one with the broth. Such a let down.

**Story**
Seeing a new authentic noodle place near our house, my wife and I were ecstatic and had high hopes. We were seated by the bar with a great view of the chefs making the noodles. When the waitress came, my wife ordered in Mandarin. On to my turn, I asked her her opinion, in English, on two of the menu items. Her response was to speak to my wife in Mandarin, totally ignoring me. Come to find out, she didn't even talk about either of my items. I ordered without her recommendation. About 10 minutes later, a couple sat down to the right of us at the bar. Another 20 minutes later, they were getting their food and we hadn't even gotten our water.

My wife asked the waitress about it, and they eventually figured out they had lost our order. We ordered again. The whole time the waitress had a scowl like it was our fault the order was lost. I asked her for water as she was leaving only to be responded with another scowl and an ""I know!"" The appetizer and my Braised Pork came at the same time. 10 minutes later, the Beef and Brisket...sigh. I had ordered hand cut noodles with my pork, but instead, got pulled noodles. At that point, I just wanted to eat. My wife mentioned it to the other male waiter, but I said it was fine. Half way through our meal, the waitress comes back and drops a Braised Pork & Egg with cut noodles on the table, like she was dropping off scraps for a dog, saying something in Mandarin to the translation of , ""here, this is free."" I was lucky I didn't get the noodle soup or I would be wearing some of my dinner. I have not felt this disrespected from a restaurant in my entire life, so I let my correct order sit untouched. This was also the very first time in my life, I've left a tip of zero.

Later, another waitress came over and apologized. When I commented about the first waitress, she told us she was the owner. It makes perfect sense now. She was probably filling in for someone else and felt she was above treating her patrons with respect.

**Recommendations**
       - I'm torn. Food wise, the meat is great, but the noodles are just tasteless carbs. However, the terrible service and experience I had, would lead me to recommend you going to China town. Though most authentic Chinese restaurants aren't known for their service, they're leaps and bounds above this one.",37S80IUIfb8yMsSwWWDsFA,12,5,1,968k_mQAhsWFIAW2rtT1GQ

We came here with a party of 5 and ordered a bunch of dishes for everyone and some appetizers. The appetizers consisted of spicy wontons, beef pancake, and fried dumplings. After what seemed like forever all of our main dishes started to come out first, which we didn't really mind because we were all starving. When we received rude looks because we asked them for a fork more than once I already knew this wasn't going to be a good experience. When we were half done with the meal the appetizers came. First the pancakes and then the spicy wontons. The fried dumplings never came. So when we were almost done with the meal we asked our server about the dumplings and said if they were not ready, we would like to cancel them. We watched her go to the back and tell the lady cooking to make some dumplings. As our server is walking back we see the lady throw  some dumplings into the pan. The server returns and says 2 minutes. To which we replied that we were done with our meal already and you just started cooking the dumplings. We want to cancel them. She actually had the nerve to tell us to take it to go. Are you serious? You forget our order and instead of canceling it you try to cook them and force it on us. We were adamant about canceling and after a few dirty looks from the staff she assured us it was canceled. 
We got the check and boxes. We paid the bill and we were getting ready to leave but since it was a hot day we decided to order a few teas to go. We ordered two honey black teas and one honey green tea to go. Now mind you the drinks we ordered with our meal came within a couple minutes of us ordering so we expected this to be pretty quick. After waiting about ten minutes what seems like the head server or manager walked by. We stopped him and asked about our teas. He went to the back and came back and said she's making it. It'll take two minutes. Who is she? Whoever she is isn't doing anything because the teas literally take a minute to pour over ice and pump with honey or whatever they do. So after another 10 minutes for a total of 20 minutes of waiting for some iced tea we got up and said forget it to which the manager just nodded his head as if he knew the whole time we weren't going to get our tea. That's just horrible. No apologies. Not even a recognition of how terrible the service and wait time was. Just a nod. 
Now I know that on this side of town there are not many options and this new ""hand pulled homemade"" noodles thing is kind of cool for people. (And not one single noodle was made fresh or hand pulled while we were there because there's a window for you to watch and we didn't see anything the whole time. ) There are way better places just a 10 minute drive away in Chinatown. Places that care about your time and care if you enjoyed your meal or not. I don't know if they think they don't need to care because they are busy but I don't think their supposed handmade mushy noodles are worth the insult.",I0JqG0FOL1FXDTTi_VVJhg,2,1,1,asMLCUNcyaUSSY-NMouNFQ

Rumor has it, this is the same family that ran the Beijing Noodle Cafe over on the east side.  Seems like they made a good business decision by moving to this new location, since it was packed with Asians during lunch time and there was even a short wait.  The noodles are hand made and if you come at the right time you can see them pulling the dough and making the noodles.  We got to witness the ""knife shaving"" of the noodles, since they have an open kitchen and we were sitting at the bar.  

Onto the food, I had a really hard time deciding what to get since I wanted to order everything but we went with:

1. Mongolian Beef Pancake $5 - the dough was nice and crispy with a little bit of chewiness with tender beef patty inside, served with daikon and soy dipping sauce.  I suggest shoving the daikon into the dough pocket before dipping, for ultimate umami flavor.

2.  Shangxi Knife Sliced Soup Noodle $8 - this is pretty much the non-spicy version of the Lan Zhou beef noodle soup for those with heart burn like me.  The soup was flavorful and the beef was melt in the mouth tender.  Honestly, if you aren't a big eater....you can definitely share a bowl of noodles.  The noodles were the perfect texture...chewy/al dente...no soggy noodles here!

3. Sliced Pork and Mushroom Noodle (Dry Noodle) $8 - I tend to like dishes that have a hint of sweetness and this is a good combo of salty and sweet.  And who doesn't like multiple types of mushrooms with tender slices of pork belly.

All the noodle dishes were cooked to perfection and honestly this is one of the best cheap meals in town...the only problem we really ran into was service.  They missed our appetizer order and we had to re-order that after our noodles came out.  But hey, Asian joints are notorious for bad service...so what can you really expect.",Tdv7HZa4Hyjm-X0MtNmeag,11,8,5,jrqFwIRP_6203jz56GChaQ

I ordered the c3 Szechwan Chicken ($8) the plate was drenched in sauce that made it almost inedible for me. The sauce was good, but there was so much of it that after two or three bites I really couldn't eat anymore. 

We also ordered the Mongolian beef pancake ($5) which we were excited about because it was featured in a lot of reviews on yelp. They were awful.

Won ton soup - bland. The place is Noodle Man not dumpling man, so my bad in ordering this. 

Onion pancake - skip this. Was oily and floury. I make it better buying frozen ones from Ranch 99.

10 minutes of waiting and this is what irritated me. A couple got sat at a table next to us, and the second they sit down the waitress goes to them to take their order immediately.

5 minutes after the table next to us ordered, their food already came out. That's when I had it, I just left. To me, horrible service really kills the vibe of experience.

Pros: Amazing noodles! 

Cons: Both dishes were drenched with oil, especially the tofu chicken; Eggplant chicken literally had only 4 small pieces of eggplant and a majority of green and red peppers (dish should be called bell pepper chicken instead); both dishes were salty (we probably drank 2L of water); did I say the dishes were oily (you could feel a film in your mouth after drinking water).

Their handmade noodles were spectacular, you can tell that the noodles are freshly made and just have the right amount of spring to them, if that makes any sense, not too al dente but not too soggy either is what I'm trying to get at!

I had done some thorough research at the hotel before coming out to order, which I could've ordered at the hotel on the phone but I was just being wishy washy so I waited.  They have seats in there for you for people that ordered to go which i thought was really nice. The restaurant itself is on the smaller side but had a good amount of people in it too.

For food we had the zha jiang mien, potstickers, chicken mushroom pancake, spicy wontons, and wonton soup. 

Zha jiang mien is the inspiration for spaghetti with meat sauce, which was brought back to Italy from China a long time ago. It's noodles with a meat sauce and fresh veggies. The noodles are nice and chewy, and the vegetables add a crisp bite, but the meat sauce is underwhelming. To be fair, the only such sauce that I loved was actually in China. For the flavor of the sauce, it's fairly similar to straight hoisin. If you love hoisin, get this, otherwise skip it. 

The potstickers were alright. They were crisp on the outside and juicy inside, but again, not much flavor. 

The chicken mushroom pancakes were advertised as having mushrooms, oyster, and more. But I struggled to taste or see anything inside but ground chicken. The pancake was crispy on the outside, and the flavor was ok, but I was hoping for more variety rather than all chicken. 

The spicy wontons had a slight kick to them, but they were all skin. There was almost no meat inside. I wouldn't order these again. 

Finally, the wonton soup was good. The broth was satisfying, and the wontons were stuffed with a little more meat than the spicy wontons. This was the best dish we ordered, but it still isn't among the best wonton soups in the area. That being said, I would order this again.

They kept posting pictures of bowls after bowls after bowls of noodles, with a plate or two of Mongolian Beef Pancakes (??????) and Fried Dumplings (??) tossed in the mix for good measure.  So I was intrigue to say the least, when some of the more active tasting agents were posting updates multiple times in the span of 3-4 days.

That good huh?

So yeah, I did the mental bookmark thing on my virtual list of notable restaurants to try. But with moving and all the related hassels associated with finding a place and arranging movers and carpet cleaners, etc. I was not in a hurry or had the time to tackle this list.

So last night after watching the Warriors came close to taking game 3 to OT, but sadly allowed the Cavs to take the game and 2-1 lead, Mike K and I decided to check this place out. It was only 1.4 miles away.

We arrived in the final 30 minutes of their business hour, so we were told we had to place our order since it is already ""last call"" time. After studying the menu, reviewing reviews, and performing final cursory analysis of the hundreds of Yelp photos, we both ended up with what we thought was a safe bet. 

B3 Shanxi Knife Sliced Noodle Soup (?????) - Beef Brisket, Sweet Potato Vermicelli, Black Fungus, Pickled Cabbage, Green Onion, and Cilantro. 

Our orders came out quickly and Mike K confirmed that it was shaved from a ball of dough, not cut on the cutting board like some other types of handmade Chinese noodles with uniform size and thickness.  So it tasted great, just the nice chewy texture one comes to expect from a properly made Hand Cut/Knife Cut Noodles (???). The broth was excellent, I ended up drinking as much of it as I could with that clunky black spoon that they serve your order with. The Beef Brisket could be more tender, and definitely could be braised longer, but it was not so tough you can wear out your dentures with and leave culinarily frustrated.  So I would definitely recommend it for first timers.

Service was friendly, even for a place getting ready to close for the night.  The decor is simple, the view of the clean open kitchen is nice, especially for people that sits at the counter.

Definitely planning to come back in the near future and try some other noodles from their small menu and the Mongolian Beef Pancakes.

Visiting so soon after my first visit, I did notice some inconsistencies. The noodles are indeed delicious, as are their sauces and stews. I ordered the shanxi knife noodle soup on both occasions and each time, despite ordering the same meal, they had slightly different flavors and I noticed the cut of meat was slightly more gristly and fatty than my first order. The noodles were just as delicious as I remembered. The strawberry green tea with boba had the same flavors but they were skimpier with the ice than on my first visit. 

My mom noticed her noodle dish had a slightly different flavor as well. We both enjoyed our meals on both visits and I know I will be back often, given how conveniently it is located to me. I look forward to trying their entire menu. 

Everything I have tried is packed with flavor and cooked well. The portions are incredibly generous and I see this being a regular stop for me as long as they stay consistent. 

Service is friendly and keep in mind this is a very small restaurant so they get extremely busy. I have had to wait each time I've come, but they are able to get customers in and out in a decent amount of time.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,18,16,4,O0rJNj4RPXWUXWWj60B-qw

Ordered B1, beef are hard to chew, just like rubber.  Mentioned to server later, she seems aware of that beef was not cooked to meet basic requirement. WHY do you serve to customer then?",Gz9buNUX5TPcq7VwI23Jow,0,0,3,BbV8WffTx25ZA5OFlgBEtg

I recommend getting the Mongolian beef pancake. Also any soup on the menu is good.",gM2VANBRd6X7BcPdEie3Xw,0,0,4,puekIUQt_RxolPUFY2lWSQ

The first time I ate here, everything went fine. Second time, my mom and I received poor customer service. We thought the server just had a bad day so we let it go and decided to come back for the third time. Third time was horrendous. I couldn't believe the attitude the busser had towards my mother. He was very rude and slammed the glass of water on our table after we asked the waiter to refill our glass. I guess he was upset because he thought we were finished and he wanted to clean the table but instead we wanted to sit a bit longer and sip our waters. Not only did he slam the glass on the table but he also said some things to my mom in Chinese. I believe he said to her rudely ""You have to pay first! You have to pay now!"" Truly appalling. Never coming back here again and not recommending to anyone. Ever. No one disrespects my mother.",kRenaXwON4BNz9bWWBm3bg,3,0,3,cDHxugIbdBbdMZAkx_Ik2A

5996621,2015-07-17,0,kABF0hYfAEnl166mn1zR1A,"I was really optimistic coming in to eat here for the first time. My party and I ordered a variety of things, the A1 (Mongolian Pancake) and A3 (Vegetable pancake)... A5 (Spicy Pork Wonton) , A7 (Chong Qing Style Sour & Spicy Noodles), B2 (Beef Brisket w/ Tomato Noodle Soup) and C3 (Homemade Zha Jiang Noodle)....

The food was decent... A7 was definitely our least favorite... B2, was good...

But...
The service was so weird... I feel like the servers displayed favoritism to Chinese patrons and White American patrons. The service we received made us not enjoy our experience. Utensils were not available at the table (I don't understand why not either) and they seemed angry that we asked for utensils to eat our noodles. We had to ask for chopsticks, then ask for spoons... All of our other dishes were almost finished before we finally received A5 and A7.

The spicy pork wonton (A5) was definitely not what I anticipated the dish to taste like. It was decent but it had this red watery sauce that made me feel like I was getting hypertension as I ate it.

I thought the pancakes A1 and A3 were okay. My party preferred the vegetable one over the Mongolian. The Mongolian was overly oil and watery... And it didn't have much flavor in my opinion.

A7 just straight up tasted weird... It looked a lot better than it tasted. Would not recommend at all. No one liked it.

I didn't try the C3 but my party finished that dish... Assuming it was good??

The noodles were very long in length and good, but as what someone in my party said, since they advertise to be a ""fresh noodle"" place, the taste wasn't distinct. I've had some amazingly fresh noodles with a very refreshing taste in Beijing.

I do like the decor/wall art. The layout is similar to Monta with few tables and a ""bar-like"" area where you can watch the cooking.

Overall, I'd be willing to come here again. I may have come on an off-day, or the servers really don't like children or non-Chinese people... I will definitely try other items since I saw a lady at the table next to us order a delicious looking bowl of noodles. 

I would say B2 is definitely safe every time.",TuDKWn--QmjAKLyLMGZZtQ,2,1,3,3BMoGvcqQNDtpyRzray6Yg
