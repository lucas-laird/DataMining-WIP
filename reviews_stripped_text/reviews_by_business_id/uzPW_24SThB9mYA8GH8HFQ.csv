We really had no idea what to expect. The restaurant is located in a strip mall. Inside it is VERY simple looking and nothing to talk about. We decided to eat outside. 

I ordered the Lega Tibs. It was cubed pieces of lamb, seasoned and cooked with tomato, onion, garlic, finished herbal butter & rosemary beef. Ice also came with a red sauce and dry spices on the side...THANK GOD!  Both the sauce and dry spices were hotter than any spice I'd ever tasted outside of a habanero pepper. 

My husband wanted a lamb dish...the server asked if my husband like ""bbq""?  My husband said he wasn't a big fan. She said, ""Well, it's bbq, but doesn't taste bbq."" Okay, so he ordered it. Once it arrived we figured she meant the meat was cooked on the grill, but there were no rubs or bbq sauces. 

In all honesty, that meat he got was as black as the ace of spades on the playing cards on the strip.  This is why I rated the place a 4 rather than a 5.  That was just a waste of money, but on the bright side we had a Groupon. 

We met the owner while we were dining. He seemed very nice and proud of his establishment. Everyone treated us very nice, and I did like the food I had ordered. I just wish I had been warned about the spiciness of the food. Even a tiny amount of spice left my mouth on fire. 

I might try Ethiopian food again, but not too soon.",Hu32E6QveTlfboidOAaB6Q,1,0,4,GfrqaHNIwt51nsMVm_t4lA

1368064,2018-01-21,0,uzPW_24SThB9mYA8GH8HFQ,"Ethiopian food is most known for its rich diversity in savory and spicy stews accompanied with injera, a soft sponge-like bread. The menu comprise of sandwiches, meat entrée, a vegetarian option, and meat & veggie combo. For starters, I chose the Veggie Combo of 7 Items ($12.99). These seven items are all vegan and include:  

[1] SUFF AND TIMATIM FITFIT: boiled sunflower blend, filtered and mixed tomato, onion, and jalapeno pepper. 
[2] SHIRO: seasoned mild chickpea powder cooked with onion, garlic, and tomatoes. 
[3] KEY SIRE: cooked fresh beets with carrots, potato, onion, garlic, and Ethiopian spice. 
[4] MISOR WOT: red lentil simmered with berbere (spice pepper), onion, garlic, ginger, and Ethiopian herbs. 
[5] GOMEN WOT: fresh chopped collard greens cooked with onion and garlic. 
[6] KIK ALICHA: simmered yellow split peas with onion, garlic, peppers, and Ethiopian herbs. 
[7] AZIFA: simmered green lentils with onion and garlic. 

The meal is pleasantly appealing, every item is abundant in flavor, and it taste absolutely delicious! For a newcomer, keep in mind when dining in there are no utensils, but there are napkins and salt on the table. It is proper etiquette to use your right hand to eat. Just make sure you wash them. How you would eat your meal is by tearing a small piece of the injera and scooping just enough food to put in your mouth. It's one of those meals where you are expected to take your time to taste while appreciating Ethiopian culture. 

They do have a bar where you can order drinks and watch sports. There is an intimate dining area called the Culture Room where you can enjoy a Traditional Style of Ethiopian Dining. And on the corner of the Culture Room, you can see how they make Ethiopian coffee. The restaurant also caters to special events and can accommodate up to 200 people. Habtu is the manager. He and his staff are very kind and welcoming. So far this restaurant is one of the best cultural dining I have experience in Las Vegas.",dpvR4LYXr0CYHtHf8BeCKg,3,1,5,cDe7cO3gcDK1oD4oYxotVw

The service was also great! The staff was friendly and regularly checked in us.

I LOVE Ethiopian food. Probably my favorite of all ethnic foods! In the past, I have gone to Merkato here in Vegas and had planned the same for this visit, but Yelp had some awesome reviews for this restaurant - and they were absolutely right!

So what did I order? Usually, I choose the veggie sampler, but I was feeling like some spicy beef today and Awaze Tibs hit the spot perfectly. I ordered it spicy and that didn't happen the first time out - not a problem at all. My amazing waitress brought me a side of some insanely spicy awaze sauce - oh yeah! 


I'm not big on giving 5 stars unless the place really wows me and this one was great, but no over the top. There were a couple of items that I thought could have been better.

I'm a patient diner and if it takes a bit of time it's ok but It took way way way way way too long for everything- to get menus, give our order, get food, pay the check and get my card back(a bit nervous about how long they held my card-I had to go get it).
The food: the dishes that should at least be warm were stone cold and thin(as watered down or not cooked long enough). Skimpy portions with the exception of a huge pile of salad covering 1/3 of the platter. 
Wait staff: friendly but we clearly had a language problem which made it difficult to voice our needs for much of the service. Another wait staff came only at the end of the meal too late to warm the cold dishes and satisfy our needs.

3242055,2017-01-06,29,uzPW_24SThB9mYA8GH8HFQ,"Mio bello said I have an international appetite.  It's a fact.  In Las Vegas we're spoiled with the variety of ethnic food that's convenient and available in multitude.  There are more Ethiopian restaurants in Vegas that have opened since 5 months ago.  Lucy's is the second Ethiopian restaurant I've dined.  

Their vegetable combo platter is huge and for a good price.  My favorite is the shiro wat and lentils.  Both are a little spicy and I love the flavors.  The pancakes are called injera and they're served cold.  There's a little tangy taste to them which I enjoy very much, especially paired with the spicy food.  

The chicken and rice plate comes with a healthy portion as well.  Chicken is spiced very nicely.  There were jalapenos scattered on top.  The chicken itself seemed fried but wasn't greasy.  They look like seasoned potato square chunks.  Really tasty chicken pieces.

Both dishes came with a green salad.  Perfectly crunchy fresh lettuce, tomatoes, and onions dressed with a mixture of something I'm unsure of.  I ate every little piece of lettuce.  Their salad was great!

I should've asked the name of our pleasant server.  She was super attentive and a sweetheart.  After ordering, our food was delivered to the table in fair time.  For the veggie combo, it's meant to eat with hands.  I asked for a fork though :P.  Our leftovers which I expected was prepared in take out containers by our server; really kind of her.

Menu is for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.  Desserts and beer are served here.  They're open super late!  I should say til super early - 4am!  In the evening, the parking lot is lit so brightly.  Outdoor seating is even available; of course not recommended in the winter season.  The location is not too far from the strip, but closer to Palms and Rio.

This restaurant has a blue and green neon light bar, lots of seating, live TV's along the walls, music on the speaker for entertainment, dancing laser dots, and a multi-colored disco globe light which wasn't on.  The interior is dim, but it was cool with the neon lighting coming from the bar.  Tables set up at the wall had traditional chairs and colorful woven basket-like tables with covers.

First time experience dining here and I have no reason to omit any stars!  Wonderful flavored food, good service, no issues with any wait times, ideal location and business hours.",JQIZhoQB-Tg9hdBEj90m4g,48,41,5,vfCKQsoF-41YhQbNYmMqNg

We came in for an early dinner on a Sunday night. The place was empty save one other table of diners. Still, it took a long time to get service, to get water refilled, for our meals to come out, and for the check to arrive.

I also emailed them off their website with some questions on their food weeks ago. No response. I had to call five times to get someone who could speak English to field but not answer my questions...still don't know the answer on some of their ingredients, which I needed to check for allergies. 

Don't bother calling ahead for carry out...you'll sit there and wait while they prepare your order. After you arrive. There's no recognition or apology of wasting your time.

Originally opened in Las Vegas in 2015, though the family of owners has been committed to serving traditional Ethiopian Cuisine to both immigrants and the community around them since 1992, it was partially in preparation for an upcoming trip and also out of curiosity that a party of three sat down inside Lucy Ethiopian on Friday for dinner, the apparently early hour of 6pm finding the main dining room otherwise empty though there was a small private group enjoying dinner in the private room tucked behind a curtain.

Fortunate enough to have been involved in the care of many sons and daughters of Ethiopia during the course of training as well as practice, the city of Columbus containing one of the nation's most dense populations while Las Vegas also employs a fair share of individuals in the hospitality industry, it was on the word of a father of four that Lucy was ""the only Ethiopian food I'll eat besides my wife's"" that recommendations had been sought prior to sitting down, the choice of two combination platters providing enough food for nearly twice as many at an all-inclusive cost of just over $40.

A surprisingly large space at 4850 West Flamingo Road, the storefront itself a little difficult to see from the street but in reality not all that far from the Strip, diners approaching Lucy Ethiopian will first notice that the restaurant's windows are covered with blinds as well as laminate to protect against the early day sun and although the inside may appear a little drab thanks to grey tile and old ceilings there is no questions of the space's cleanliness, everything including the bathrooms and 21-and-older Bar spotless with servers seen polishing glasses shortly after arrival and quickly wiping up as soon as the private party was finished.

Playing mellow traditional music overhead and sports on several televisions, a combination of Soccer, NCAA Football and the Golden Knights' first game on this particular evening, it was with waters filled for the first of several times that approximately twenty minutes passed between order and food delivery, both plates arriving almost simultaneously and quickly flooding the table with a vast array of shapes, smells and colors.

Totaling twelve individual menu items across the two trays, eight spongy rolls of Injera made with the authentic Teff-based recipe offered as the only form of 'utensils,' it was with a focus on things served warm that dining commenced, the Misir Wot featuring heavily spiced Red Lentil with a top-notes of Garlic and Onion an immediate favorite as was the Doro Wot featuring a similar list of ingredients served around a hard-boiled Egg and Chicken Drumstick.

Attempting to avoid filling up too much on the Wraps, the three lighter rolls a bit more sour than the dark rolls served both beneath and alongside the ingredients, it was with hands immediately covered in sauce that large spears of tender Beets and Carrots were enjoyed in a smear of Garlic and spices including Basil, Turmeric and Cardamom, the Vegan Combo's Collard Greens a bit too bitter to be enjoyed on their own while those served as a special request with Goat Meat as part of the Special Combo were better cooked and drained with more of the expected deep cruciferous flavor.

Receiving the Kitfo lightly seared, though by tradition it seems a dish typically served raw, it was with a lot of spice that the finely ground Tartare again ignited the palate before being cooled off by a bit dry Aybe, the taste not dissimilar from Dry-Curd Cottage Cheese and tasty on its own, though even better with the Lenga Tibs as a sort of Ethiopian Fajita.

Far too full for Dessert, the menu of sweets appearing fairly straight-forward and apparently not made in house, it was with the Yellow Pea-based Kik Alicha and a few more bites of Kitfo that the meal was finished, a lot of Injera plus some Greens still leftover but the staff apparently quite impressed by the table's willingness to try everything and the waitress even going so far as to give the 10-year-old dining with the group a big hug before leaving.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,10,7,4,WxRic3hOf3BzzlDgpaQwCg

I would definitely recommend this place if you're looking to try food that is a little out of the ordinary.",sWLXpqNLhIBi_4QOPwKPog,0,1,4,wp4ZdN3D02KxNIkAWhodnA

An Ethiopian craps dealer at Jokers Wild in Henderson recommended this to me. I was NOT disappointed, far from it. This is my new ""Must Go"" gem in Las Vegas when I come visit, and I come often, and I thought I knew ALL the ""off the beaten path"" gems. OH no, this place is now THE place for me.

I went for BREAKFAST, as my flight was leaving in a few hours. If breakfast (I believe the dish I had was called Quanta firfir) is this amazing, I can only imagine dinner.

My waitress was a DARLING! I sat outside to get the last of the warm desert sun before heading back to Snowland. I asked her to suggest something, and she suggested a dried beef/jalapeno/injera soaked in some kind of tomato stew. 

It is also served ON injera, so there is a lot of injera.When it arrived, the smell was exotic and heavenly. The quality of the beef was wonderful, and the flavors were divine. SO good!!

Service was over the top. You could not want for anything, the waitress was running back and forth to make sure I always had what I needed,

And the portion was MASSIVE. THREE people could have eaten off of that one breakfast. I NEVER waste food if at all possible, so when I was full, I asked the waitress to box up the leftovers well, so I could give it to one of the many homeless in Vegas. I was sure I would find someone on my way to the airport.

So she packaged it SO well, put in napkins and everything. I found my hungry guy on the way to the airport, and when he smelled the inside of the bag, his eyes lit up like he had just found nirvana.

I cannot wait to go back to Vegas, and this is one of the reasons for sure. Can't wait to try more on the huge menu.

And the prices looked VERY VERY reasonable. And that's BEFORE considering how large the portion was. AAAA++++",alZiccJ3Cp7K_34uLb7msQ,0,0,5,UfpKrxHRTBV5FfQsG3hobQ

too sick to type more will edit eventually

So the food is not very good I've had much better ehtiopian food

The restaurant is insanely loud even when empty.

The service is horrible. They speak perfect English (idk what the reviews that say they aren't are on about) they are just slow inattentive and rude.

also kind rude... Nope 100% rude. They will mock you for asking for utensils. Who cares if you've been working with toxic chemicals all day. Eat with your hands ignorant fool! So rude.",jD-A9MezhxEbn5pLlo5bJA,0,0,1,OPIVs9SNMnVus0Zl0y2kGg

Let's get straight to the food. Yum! I recommend coming hungry because the portions are generous. We've had the meat sambusas, Lucy's special combo, legs tibs and Kornies. My favorite are the lentils and kitfo. So flavorful and seasoned beautifully.  

If you need to take it home they'll package it up and give you extra injera if you ask",zQk1bdjUXwktAyDUfrE0dA,0,0,4,OPFPPSWNVmtxfLGZvVb0lQ
5629101,2018-03-14,0,uzPW_24SThB9mYA8GH8HFQ,Another first time for me! I love Vegas you really can eat different authentic foods from all over the world. This place is a perfect example. I tried their Veggie plate and it was very delicious. Our waitress was very bubbly and nice.

Each of the veggie items was delicious and flavorful, and the tibbs (beef) came in a sizzling clay pot, crispy and blackened outside but moist and delicious inside. The seasoning was great, the sautéed onions and jalapeños were good compliments. Oh and I really enjoyed the black injera, first time I've had it.

Service is always very friendly, the restaurant is clean and comfortable, and the prices are SO, so reasonable for how delicious the food is and how much of it you receive! I ordered two vegetarian entrees yesterday and have extra food for probably the next few days. I also asked for extra injera (some Ethiopian restaurants definitely skimp on the injera) and received easily a pound of it for no additional charge! I've never tried the meat entrees, but all the vegetarian ones are absolutely delicious and come piping hot. The miser wot has a perfect amount of spice and is definitely one of my favorites, and the kik alicha has an amazing flavor. I also love how the injera has a perfect fluffy consistency, flavor, and isn't overly thin so it tears when you're trying to eat. Definitely the best Ethiopian food in Vegas!",PAYz0kG3nQpNkWiYUPQh4A,1,1,5,g1ysPLLAiBuG1kePiNLuVQ
5698169,2016-12-26,0,uzPW_24SThB9mYA8GH8HFQ,Fairly quiet place. Looked clean. Bathrooms were good. Food was mediocre. I got the platter and only liked one of the options. Maybe it's just my taste but not for me. Service was painfully slow. I'm normally patient but towards the last 20 minutes was getting really aggrivated.,_5olc0UMlZDnuw49SRGdSA,0,0,1,ul4_aFUADM97eKt8Kwa6cg

The bad: the service, while not unfriendly, was exceedingly slow and inattentive. I had to wait a few minutes to order, my water was never refilled, and it took a while to get my check. And it's not like the place was super busy. So they lose a star on that one.",YE54kKTuqJJPNYWIKIpOEQ,2,0,3,ebofD1QyeArkaBeJ1ogGbg

A friend recommended Lucys and we were not disappointed. The service was amazing! Maki took care os us and she was wonderful. We sat on the traditional side of the restaurant.  She explained what things were and how they were prepared as well as made suggestions. There were 7 of us and she took good care of us with ease. Our friends had the honey wine and it was flavorful. When the food arrived, she showed us how to eat it. Some things were a little spicy for me but everyone else loved the spice. We had the combination platters and it was great giving us the ability to try lots of things. My favorite was the collard greens. All of the food choices were bursting with flavor and spices.

5893868,2017-01-06,0,uzPW_24SThB9mYA8GH8HFQ,"There are puhl-LEN-ty of places to get 4 or 5-star food in Vegas up until about 10 p.m.  or so; after that, you'd better have a short list handy in your back pocket.  For my money--which is running low around that time of night--there are only two late, late night-into-the wee-hours  restaurants that I've found worth taking my midnight growling gut to.  I wouldn't recommend them for daylight or early evening hours because there are just too many other stellar places to choose from; but when all the other wimps in their high white hats turn off the lights in their well-appointed kitchens, there's at least Lucy to satisfy your most basic need for nourishment and lots of it.  Not to mention our basic human desire for tactile stimulation (eating with your hands), ""strange stuff"" (try the bread, which you may understandably mistake for a cloth napkin), and mysterious connection with antiquity, the soil, the call of the wild.  You will have all these needs met, safely, at Lucy, at a fraction of what you spent on the Wheel of Fortune progressives.     Oh, the second worthy joint is The Bootlegger, Italian, open 24/7.",6c1t4iWwA-gcKFyyicPulA,0,0,5,vBlOzsTvtNfyoX0ZYPsLSQ
