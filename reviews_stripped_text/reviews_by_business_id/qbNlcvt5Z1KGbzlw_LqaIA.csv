This one is located in a strip mall off of Flamingo. It's right next to a Zaba's Mexican Grill. The parking lot is a zoo during lunch hours. 

The inside is clean. The staff is friendly. I've only stopped in once after work to grab a sandwich to go. The sandwich was decently made. I asked for extra banana peppers and I received them. Strangely enough I saw that this Quiznos had a bottle of the Batch 88 sauce out. I haven't see the Batch 88 sauce out at the Quizno's that is closer to my house. I love that stuff. Remember when Quizno's used to have a little bar where they had the sauce and banana peppers and other sauces so you could grab them at your convenience? I do. But I never see that little bar in Quizno's anymore.

Overall - they make decent sandwiches, they complied to my add ons with no fuss, and the store was clean (from what I saw of it), can't complain, it's a decent place.",hZfzVrhsCQ9JDAb2jYoJNQ,1,0,3,o37QZZFTQoJxvUPTelYXnQ

I went in to create my own sandwich and the guy there said I couldn't choose my own sauces so he put them on for me, he burnt my sandwich, charged me extra for stuff I didn't order and forgot to give my change back. Not once did he apologize for any of these things and he also had a horrible attitude. Not cool.",tTYqe25hAg_VuIsbpfYHog,0,0,1,dMjKGxLOg-57d2v-ArD2aw

Sandwich barely had three thin slices of meat and the cheese was so thin you couldn't taste it. 
The person making my sandwich couldn't understand me, language barrier, and I had to repeat myself several times. 
Also I was getting the lunch special. A small sandwich, soda and chips. I asked if I could a small soup in lieu of the chips and soda and was told yes for more money. (Again a language barrier). I'm very unhappy that there wasn't a slightly more healthy alternative. 
Oh well. will not come here again.",-ZfOoJyxQrqNRp5F0WbqHA,0,0,1,vTxZY06SedO9c7H4Zz3gSQ

I ordered my sub and when she asked me what I wanted on my sub, I said ""just lettuce"" twice.  At time same time I was paying for my order and I repeated to her again to add lettuce on it.  After I paid and went home and checked my sub ... of course she did NOT add lettuce on it.  I was pretty aggravated because I even gave her a tip and she couldnt even get my order right. Ugh! 
I probably wont go back to this specific quiznos again.",oDyEexUT09e3XhxIp0-Wxg,1,1,2,ZvgT5ZRuzhaO_bM9Gin_oQ
