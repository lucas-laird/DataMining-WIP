157323,2016-11-26,0,WT20ueFsAGf0bkzVCRgHTQ,They were terrible people with terrible things. All they did was treat women like hookers and hot dogs aren't actually sold there unless there is a slave in the kitchen. It's in China town so if you are not Asian they have no respect for you. Also the bathrooms are dirty. I spotted a few cockroaches on the walls and we found a dead on in the pocket. We left immediately because it smelled terribly like cigarettes. Also when we were trying to get out they refused to take our card unless we paid eight dollars. If I could I would have that place closed immediately.,JXhLsvwuDIwPkItlgbZ6Uw,1,0,1,KYssJRADh4VaiqQXB3G9Vg

I came with a group of friends and when we walked in the manager/or owner(Asian man with black hair and a tattoo on his chest) was smoking behind the bar and drinking, which is not presentable at all. Then instead of greeting us with a ""good evening"" or ""how are you guys tonight,"" we were greeted with a ""what do you want."" Ignoring the fact of the poor greeting we continued to go to our table. When we wanted to order a hotdog he stated ""really man"" then asked ""how many,"" then proceeded to say ""well you have to wait to order until 11:00 pm,"" I came to play pool at 9:00pm. I told him, ""why can't you make it, it is just one little hotdog,"" then he said ""well I do not have an employee and I do not want to go back there, so you can go next door to get a hotdog."" Then I went back to the table and notified my group and my girlfriend said, ""why can't he make a hotdog himself, it would not be that long."" Then she proceeded to ask him for a hotdog, asking politely because, again, it was a little, most likely frozen, hotdog. Then the manager began to get a little hostile with my girlfriend, so we decided to leave. Then began to confront us, practically yelling at us. Their is NO WAY I would come back to this place. The manager/or owner was very disrespectful to us and did not deliver any good or even ok customer service. The hotdog was not the big deal, but how he handled and responded was terrible. It does not matter how the guest is acting, as a Manger/or owner it is your job to handle any situation correctly.",RKRWctjk4mHa-NfCL-lYNA,0,0,1,0RXbsLv4S41Ojw5GRGBkTg

No that's not a mistake
No i'm NOT THAT DRUNK

Five stars for having such a wide selection of beers for such a hole in the wall. There's very few places that carry both Blue Moon AND Shock Top, I cant even get these two at the Red Rock Sports Bar and that's such a classier place then this hole in the wall.

The men's room is a sight to behold. How the frak do you get tagging on the ceiling? i mean seriously ON THE CEILING!! 

Cheap and wide selection of beers, Jukebox that plays some old school hip hop, cheap and wide selection of beers, cheap games of pool (either a dollar a game or you can pay by the hour don't know how much didnt ask), and the cheap and wide selection of beers.

Might see me here more often trying to recall what i learned from geometry.

2276928,2013-08-26,1,WT20ueFsAGf0bkzVCRgHTQ,"Talk about throwing it back old school for me. I still remember oh about twenty years ago first moved too Vegas would frequent Shark Pool Hall with roommate go shot pool and drink after work. Times have changed with lot more pool halls across the valley. It was my first time coming too Cue-D. I really had no expectations expect keep my early yakudoshi party going night. It located in the perfect spot comes too finding some great asian food off the strip. After great night at Wendy decided too keep the party going across the street. The only downfall feel for all the shops in this little strip mall is parking suxs! It can fill up supa fast but if all else fails can park across the road then walk over. 

Pool Hall its not Huge Huge but just overall nice size. Think something like over 15 tables in all. Not the full size regulation tables. Who need regulation really going there too drink and play pool with friends? Lol! Drinking about steal of deal. I believe from 7-10 running special two dollar beers. The catch was fact not your typical cheap flavorless ones they had few nice craft beers. Me and roommate went for the Shock Top. Really for $2 that is SHOCK of price no pun intended. The bar area itself is nothing too brag about just your basic hole in the wall feel for bar. The service is awesome. The moment walk in ask if playing pool, games or hour, many tables, and really on it. The tables for really looks like hole in wall place are really nice. The felt are nice all around or could tell on all the tables (no rips, clean, and tables are all leveled right). The house sticks most part straight not warped or abuse much being house  sticks. Each table nice table area you can place your drinks and whatever else bring, The jukebox something that cool surprise! You can play whatever music in the mood or rocking pool game on. I like the fact that the tables have nice amount of space between tables or feels like more then normal?

The only thing need too be prepared for is NO CASH. They do have ATM right next too the bar, We had too use because first timers had no clue. 

Definitely fan of Cue-D. If ever have urge too go shot pool really this place rocks for bargain and love hole in the wall places in Vegas.",iSC96O2NjQc3JExGUHQG0Q,3,2,4,eQC212CCg35ZigufHA8JNg

It's also centered near a karaoke lounge & a hookah lounge. There are several Asian stores surrounding, as for it's near the streets of Chinatown.

The prices are pretty flexible, if you can't afford enough for a game itself, you can always use the quarter tables. If you go there enough, the staff is like to give you discount. There's also music you can choose yourself provided along with other stuff like an arcade, a bar, and a lounge area.

Overall, it's a pretty chill environment, and although it's not the greatest, it's a spot definitely to check out because it's one of the places in Vegas where almost anyone who's done pool has gone there.",n-sqDEbE3RgvmO6QaZyLag,1,0,3,NCPTPQll4KQ2l8wqUope5g

*Beer and snacks

*Wifi - It popped up on my Itouch, but there was a pass needed. I'm assuming you just have to ask and it'll be free for customers
*Open late
*Friendly staff
*Decent amount of places to sit
*Erotic video games at the counter! They have a small touch screen computer with a selection of Trivia, Puzzle, Erotic, Action games that are only 25 cents each. We scored 3rd place on erotic trivia, right under ""F*ckalicious.""

Cons:
*Seems like there are always a lot of teens
*SO smoke filled. I felt like I was hot-boxed in a closet full of cigarettes and the stench would not go away, even after driving all the way home with all the windows down.

Pros: 
--Plenty of pool tables, all in good condition.
--Specials on drinks and a weekend happy hour!
-- Lots of restaurants/bars/karaoke spots in the same strip mall.
-- Young crowd, most of the customers were probably under 30. (well its a pro for me cause thats my age group)


Cons: 
--Super smokey environment - coming out your hair, clothes, everything will smell like cigarette smoke.
--Cash only - don't accept credit card but there is a ATM that charges $2.50 to use. BOO!

Plenty of full size pool tables with nice felt, decent cues that were not beat up too much, a nice Touch-Tunes jukebox (be sure to get the app for your phone!), and a bar at the entrance with beer specials ranging from $2 Shock Tops to bucket deals. Cash only, ATM at the entrance. 

The decor reminds me of something from the '80s, but I only spent two years in that decade so maybe I am not the best choice of judge. The bathrooms weren't the cleanest in the world, but that is to be expected at a pool hall I suppose. Smoking is allowed in the hall, as it should be, but if my memory serves me correctly, the place is poorly ventilated and you can just feel its presence seeped into the carpet, walls, and ceiling over the years.

The bartender didn't seem too enthused to be there, but that was fine by me. Hand over the beers and let us hit the tables. One last thing about the jukebox! Anyone can play almost anything on it and their sound system is pretty good and loud throughout the joint.

Fellow Yelpers recommended this place and I immediately bookmarked it.  Fast forward to just week and I finally was able to uncheck this bookmark. 

My Pool Hall ""Wish-List"" - So, what defines a good pool hall for me?
-Full size billiard tables, not the bar type ones
-Clean and fast felt.  I grew up playing on Simoniz felt, but anything where you can put action on the cue ball works just as good.
-Plenty of tables
-No sharks trying to hustle me. Ha!
-Straight cues ranging from 18oz to 21oz.  I prefer a 19 oz for playing and a 21 oz for breaks.  
-A good juke box playing good music.
-Cheap, none of this $20 an hour stuff
-Plenty of room
-A pool hall that isn't intimidating
-Smoke free (yeah right, especially in Las Vegas)

A group of us entered Cue-D's for a friendly game of pool and since there was an odd amount of us, we ended up playing a game of Cut Throat.  Cue-D's is chill and it doesn't matter if you're an A or even a D player, everyone is welcome. Cue-D's hit most of my ""Wish-List"", but most importantly I had a great time with fine people. 

My only issue is the stench of smoke in the air.  I know, I know, this is something that they can't control since smoking is legal inside pool halls in the valley. I use to smoke and I get it. Now that I don't, I see the difference.  The smoke didn't bother me so much while I was playing, but the smell sure followed me home.  Cue-D's is welcoming from the staff to the patrons. I'm a fan of the pool hall, just not a fan of the smoke. 

PS.  The rest rooms can use a little Mr. Clean or AJAX.

The hookah was just cheap and tasted like ash. When we asked to get our money back because what we got was NOT worth 25, they said they will not give our money back but instead give us a new bowl. But when we got the new bowl it was horrible as well!!! That wasn't even the worst part!

It's kind of his home away from home. As such, they know pretty much everyone there. So by proxy, I know everyone there. It's got that Cheers quality.

My most recent visit was last Friday. We didn't play any pool. We just hung around the bar area celebrating a friend's promotion. The bar area is a bit awkward in that the seating is kind of weird. They have these booth type things that look like they once had tables.

A note about the bar - they only take cash. Their prices are decent - $3 for domestic beers in a bottle - and they have a pretty good selection. I found myself enjoying a bottle of Shock Top poured into a glass at the suggestion of Henry, the bartender. He poured most of it into the glass, then put the bottle on its side, and rolled it back and forth before pouring the rest into the glass. I had never heard of this before, but after a Google search, it's apparently legit.

""The beer is best enjoyed in a tall, wide-mouthed glass. To serve the brew perfectly, follow these pouring guidelines. Pour the brew down the side of the glass until about one-half inch of brew is left in the bottle. Lay the bottle on its side and roll it gently back and forth, mixing the remaining yeast that has settled at the bottom. Pour the rest of the brew, producing a nice, thick collar of foam.""

They have a jukebox playing music  loud which is cool in my opinion, might be a turn off for others. All of the cocktail waitress are hot and friendly. My only gripe with the place is that it get pretty hot inside, they have a few fans blowing sporadically throughout the play but if you're not near by one it can get uncomfortably hot. Also as a side note there is a lot of smoking going on inside so if that bothers you, you may not want to come here.",LvEpVkdpji-JqyGYGwkLbw,1,0,4,_2Juxxu6uKYpcxZd3ThHNg

There are plenty of pool tables and every time I'm here I rarely have to wait for a table to open. The young lady that serves us is always friendly when we walk in and if you order food and/or drinks she brings it to the table. I appreciate the great customer service.

The rates per hour are reasonable and does not break the wallet. They also serve soft drinks and alcohol. I believe the only food they serve are hotdogs but I'm not too sure because I only ordered food here once and I liked it.

This place also has fun arcade games. My friends really enjoy the punching bag game where you hit the bag as hard as you can and it gives you a score every time you punch it. We are always very competitive. 

Overall this billiards is the place to be if you have nothing to do late at night with a bunch of friends just to hang out and have fun.",39FT2Ui8KUXwmUt6hnwy-g,2,0,4,evFL2qTDz5Y2wLC3N-dFzg

All I have to say is that Cue D's can be an addiction.  The people in this place make a difference and we already miss being here.  The staff is accommodating, warm, and friendly. It's very inexpensive and can have fun without spending an arm and a leg.

It is mostly young kids, so someone who is over 30 might not feel comfortable being here.  However, the most interesting person in here is the bartender who is like an uncle to my boyfriend.  When you come here often enough, it'll feel like home.  Just give it a try because you never know what kind of friendship you might make here.",QeZmjeEefdJ3bdbAeIHfWA,0,1,5,o5zWLvnVVzVGOGLyCpoYsg

5320638,2011-07-15,0,WT20ueFsAGf0bkzVCRgHTQ,"For over 3 years, I have found myself constantly coming back to Cue D`s. To sum it up lightly.. this place has changed my life greatly. I wasn't always a pool player in the beginning, but Cue Ds is more than just a pool hall to me and to many people. It is like a home away from home for everyone who simply needs that escape from reality. On first impression of walking in, any customer will be greeted with a cheerful staff that knows your name and will care enough to say hi by your name. It doesnt take much to become a regular here,  just a few simple conversations with the workers at the bar and before you know it, you'll be drinking beer, watching movies, playing beer pong and of course, shooting pool with your new friends. There are people who I see go here every day just to hang out with the people that they meet at this pool hall. If youre a friendly person who simply wants good company, youve found the right place to be.
Currently, Cue Ds has one of the best promotions in town. As a woman, pool is not an easy sport to try and dominate in. Not saying that Im good or anything (because Im not lol) but this place has given me and many girls out there the opportunity to practice pool for free. Monday through Thursdays from 6PM until 3AM, women get to play for free. YES. Free. Cue Ds has really given thought to the community and opened its doors to the females of Las Vegas. Women should really take advantage of this opportunity and go out there and shoot some pool! 
Cue Ds has tables that are custom made to be specialized only to their name. You wont find anything else like it in Vegas. With tables that get clean every other day and re-felted monthly.. its really good for the pros and amateurs of all kind.
At Cue Ds, they also have amazing drink specials that Ive become a big fan of. Their bucket specials are only 17 for 5 beers, something you wont find anywhere else. 
If you ever have a party, their beers come with free beer pong also! They recently remodeled and now have weekly tournaments on Sundays and Wednesdays. Its only $5 to join, and you can even win up to 150 at a time. Its one of the cheapest tournaments in town.
Overall, if you havent hung out here before.. youre missing out. Look at this place like a shelter or community boys and girls club. Theres more to it than just pool!",3HXyXpdkH1rNAEEaSxQucw,1,1,5,wTObEXDGs0Sg8-SfAmS5bw

5620610,2013-09-01,2,WT20ueFsAGf0bkzVCRgHTQ,"Another week, another pool hall.  Located right across the street from Wendy's Noodle Cafe, we just walked over after Chad S.'s early birthday dinner to play some Cut Throat.  It's a good thing we did the stroll since the parking lot here is always packed with cars coming and going.  

KUDOS:  
-The juke box has Bob Marley!
-There is a super friendly guy to greet you and they have happy hour specials for those who drink.
-TVs were showing a football game, which just happened to be the b/f's team.  If you like sports and pool, this is the place for you!


GRIPES:
-Smoky as all get out.  My eyes were watering after an hour.  I know this is to be expected in a pool hall, but it still stinks.
-The women's bathroom could use a little sprucing up.  Again, it's a pool hall, but whatevs.

We had a fun time and it's a cool spot to hang out for an hour if you're dining or having dessert at one of the many establishments right in the plaza or across the street.",7Oe6ikklTjVBbEFw9emLcA,6,3,4,eBmd35sEsUNBe2OOU4Z4_g
5934707,2018-02-26,0,WT20ueFsAGf0bkzVCRgHTQ,"My boyfriend and our friends wanted a place to chill and hang out, and Cue D was the perfect spot! We got a table and played pool for about 2 and half hours, got some darts, and ordered some food while we were there. There's a jukebox that you can choose songs out of, but you have to pay. It was fun being able to pick songs you liked, and the price was about a dollar per song. You can also order food and drinks, and play a few video game machines that they offer. There's also this small little punching ball/bag looking thing that you can hit, and it'll tell you how hard you hit it. It's a really cool place, with a great environment if you don't mind cigarette's. The rates were pretty decent. We paid $10 an hour for the pool table, plus $5 for darts, but the rate for the table varies depending on the day/amount of people in your party, so look into it! 

Now let's discuss the cons. While there, we found out we couldn't order food until 8 for whatever reason, but it was already 7:30 so we didn't really mind. We ordered at 8:20, but our food didn't come until 8:50, which we thought was a bit ridiculous for a box of wings and fries. We were actually suppose to get TWO boxes of fries, but we only ended up with one, so not only did our food take forever, but a part of it was missing. One of my friends went to ask about our food, and the girl's response was that she'd call to see where it was. Call who? We thought that the food was coming from the place directly, but I guess not. It was a bit sketchy, as I'd like to know where our food is coming from, ya know? The wings were $12 and the fries were $6, a bit pricey for food which was only mediocre at best. Although it is a bar and this is typical, the cigarette's fuming through the air was a bit of a turn off. It was a legit hot box but with cigarette's, and you end up smelling like it after, but eh, what can you do?

At the end, we paid $47, but an additional $8 (which we paid upfront) for two strawberrita's, so it was $55. There was 5 of us total, so not too shabby! Although the food part sucked a little, we will still return and genuinely enjoyed our time!

(Side note: If you are sick, you probably don't want to go here! My boyfriend had a mild cold and was coughing a lot because of the smoke. Just a little tip.)",vZp-loGRkht7npWKOwo7Ug,0,0,3,eh25cpWu349Arpd6o-84iA
5954500,2015-02-26,5,WT20ueFsAGf0bkzVCRgHTQ,"It is a great hang out spot! 
It is basically how you would expect a pool bar to be. Be prepared to inhale a lot of secondhand smoke! It is expected since it is a bar.  

There has never been a wait time for any tables here.  It's a huge place with plenty of tables!  The prices are reasonable! It's around $8-10 an hour per table. There are seats and tables around the table.  They have a happy hour for drinks but too bad I'm not 21 yet. 

From my experience,  they don't seem to mind if you bring drinks and food from Icy Juicy next door, even though they have a ""no outside food or drinks"" sign on the front window. Just don't have it near the table. 

The bathrooms is a surprise every time. Sometimes it is very clean, and sometimes it is very dirty. I guess you just have to be lucky.

There is nice music! Bring some cash for song requests on the jukebox!",ZsjuEgOdvx9l5GKZdtwYIw,6,7,4,RpQvdNQ2CQhaiQC5HV5nnA

They were out of Pizza and didn't tell us until after we ordered so that kind of sucked. The customer service was good from the guy with short black hair, not so much from everyone else. But they gave me a free strawberita for my birthday so that was really sweet. Overall the visit was ok, I just don't think the experience was worth the money. 15$ an hour for one table because we had one extra friend who didn't even play at all, so basically we had to pay for him to sit there. And $6 for a small serving of ""alright"" French fries.",_ra_93R7whtWY201kEeyFQ,0,0,3,qTGJNziF4h1FrHJfgM8l7w
