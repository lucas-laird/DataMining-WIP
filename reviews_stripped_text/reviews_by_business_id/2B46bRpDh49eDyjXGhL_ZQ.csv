I had no idea they had gluten-free options, so that was a pleasant surprise.  I had the Marion (tomato, mozzarella, pesto) and added turkey for additional protein. It went quickly. 

We had our 2-year-old with us, and we shared with her (and ""bought her"" the Tom - Nutella, Banana, and whipped cream to share).

Great atmosphere, lovely owner, and worth repeating. Thanks, Maggie!",GXHjso9fjPpRgiFWq5UzLw,3,2,5,u77SqI_sI6bWwbfBYJsVyw

We had the Marion (tomato, mozzarella, pesto) w/chicken, the Lauren (Nutella, strawberry, whipped cream), the Nancy (egg white, turkey, spinach), and the Matt (cheese, mushrooms, chicken). I had a great espresso and they even treated us to a free Alex (pear, caramel, cinnamon). All absolutely delicious!

Had interesting conversation about France... and they use imported French flour (less processed, no bleaching). The kids absolutely loved the French imported Kinder chocolate eggs with toys in them. Would totally recommend this place to anyone",2NQzY79j-zOEr1fLKxWDrw,1,0,5,HPwh1Sq_Q5-9ZwEwUfktyg

I was an 18 year old exchange student living with a basque family of 10. Every day I had crepes! They were waiting when I came home from school around 1 pm.  I fell in love with crepes!  Maggie's crepes had me reveling and time traveling back to those days. . Excellent crepes. Perfect earl grey tea.  Super friendly staff. The savory crepes are made with buckwheat so they are gluten free.  The ingredients were fresh and complimented each other very well.  Love this spot!

In fact I adore the little hideaway spot, you might actually miss if you don't spot the sign. The people who work here are very nice. And very respectful. And French! Or Jewish French. As Reb is a Jewish name in Origin. What a bonus! Anyway, my order was a Nutella filled Crepe. I usually go to this Asian lady on South Fort Apache by Kentucky Fried Chicken for the best Crepes, but I wanted to try this out. Something New. Something different. As authentic maybe? Not quite! Honestly, it was very short of what you would expect in France at all. I've been there many times too! Very plain, and mundane Crepe's. It was like toasted pancake with a slab of Nutella, a couple of banana slices and slightly old fruits. The fruits were actually old and mushy. I will admit. The Crepe Wrap is homemade and tasty, though mine was slightly under cooked. This is the main thing that makes these taste so good. Just the Wrap. Throw the rest away. The price was a little above average. The main thing, is my Crepe was small for the amount of money. Maybe I got use to the Football sized ones from the Asian Lady. But at least the Asian Lady uses the freshest Organic Fruits, and Cremes, and stuffs it like crazy, as if bulging out the sides. And it weighs a couple pounds too!. This place makes them weak and small. 1 Crepe and a Cappuccino, was almost 18 Bucks. And didn't fill a bag much for take out. This place can improve alot. And if it doesn't, no matter what the hype, it will vanish in the Desert Wind like many others here do.

Matt - savory buckwheat galette (gf) with cheese, chicken and mushrooms.  It was perfect in every way, diced roast chicken, creamy, melts cheese and sautéed mushrooms, perfectly salted and savory.

France - ham, cheese and a soft egg in the center.  My hubby inhaled it.

Alex - pears and cinnamon sugar.  It was loaded with sautéed pears and not overly sweet.

So to find a cafe that serves both sweet and savory crepes, plus traditional Butter Sugar Crepes and everything in between owned by someone who is French, makes my heart sing.

I have been here three times and had both savory and sweet crepes. I have always found that what goes into a crepe and the portions can make or break a crepe. They can be as simple as a Butter Sugar Crepe or the delicious Polo Galette- filled with Blue Cheese, Ham and Spinach. The savory crepes are served with a salad as well, so you get your greens. All are made with the French attitude of the love for food, Très Bon!

The patrons and the owner, Maggie, are very French. So don't be surprised to hear the language spoken around you or the lovely French accent of Maggie.

We tried the galettes which are savory crêpes. I had the France with egg ham and cheese and the egg was perfectly cooked sunny side up. My wife had the Marion with chicken and loved it. The good thing about those galettes is that they are made with buckwheat flour (imported from France such as the chestnut jam) so they are gluten free. 

The second time my wife had a salad and  it was very fresh and the homemade dressing was out of this world. 

Try their coffees and hot chocolate they are just very tasty. Add some homemade (no sugar) vanilla whipped-cream on the hot chocolate, it's the best !

1380613,2018-05-23,0,2B46bRpDh49eDyjXGhL_ZQ,"La Maison de Maggie is an authentic French crepe shop located just west of the Soccer Complex, next to Mimosa Gourmet. Prior to finding out about these two places, I thought this complex was essentially dead. A lot of previous shops closed in this strip mall. The only original one left is Arby's. Even Carl's Jr is gone and changed to a Dunkin Donuts. LOL 

We had unexpectedly came here after finding out about a 35-45 minute wait next door at Mimosa Gourmet, on a Sunday. We had saw that La Maison de Maggie had a 5 star rating with over 300 reviews. Somethings gotta be good for it to be this highly rated ! So nextdoor we went. 

Outside of the shop has a chalk board with specials listed. On 05/20/18, they had 4 specials. 

""Crepe Suzette"" 
""Galette of the Month"" w/ Goat Cheese, Cranberries, Onions, and Walnuts 
""Crepe Nutella"" 
""Croque-Monsieur"" 

They regularly have 7 different crepes and 7 galettes [buckwheat and flour made crepes - gluten free] on the menu inside the restaurant. I guess crepes are the sweet type, and galettes are the savory type? I totally skipped out on looking at galettes when I was there cuz I saw it was gluten free XD oops. Little did I know, that was what my friend had highly recommended in his review....

This place is the 'you place your order at the cashier and take your seat' kind of a café style. It was fairly quiet on Sunday early afternoon but soon after, it became busier. Lol 

The restaurant is quite cute. I'm not sure how to describe it. Mildly rustic. French styled? They had a side facing clock like what you'd see at a train station too ! Dimly lit. 

I had ordered the 'Crepe Suzette' whereas my friend had ordered the 'Lauren'. She had ordered a normal iced tea whereas I had ordered a 'Micka' smoothie

'Lauren' is a wheat flour crepe w/ nutella, strawberry, and whipped cream

Of the two crepes we had, this was really delicious. Crepe was fairly thick and folded. Thin layer of nutella and slices of strawberry inside the crepe. Light whipped cream piped outside on the plate. Simple but delicious. 

'Micka' is a smoothie w/ spinach, kale, pineapple, grapes, flax seeds, and agave

Simple smoothie with the above listed ingredients. They didn't blend it enough so it was still kinda chunky and hard to drink with straw. 

""Crepe Suzette"" w/ zesty homemade orange jam and Grand Marnier liquor

I was warned there was liquor in this when I ordered it which I was fine with. I had expected as much with it listing Grand Marnier which is an orange liquor. I know I've heard of 'crepe suzette' before and I think its a fairly known ""crepe"" in France. So that's what I got. 

Little did I know they were gonna bring out the crepe with the zesty homemade orange jam inside on a plate... then the Grand Marnier lit in a pot, pouring it on top of the crepe at tableside. I didn't expect how much liquor they'd use... They drenched the crepe ! it was swimming in liquor ! I know some people wouldn't complain about that... but ugh all I tasted was liquor. I don't know if the crepe soaked up and I ingested it most of it in the beginning, or I got used to it, the crepe tasted better later on. I noticed the homemade jam was really tasty but wished they were a little lighter handed on the amount of liquor. I cut a small piece for my friend to try and she had instant regret. INSTANT. LOL her face scrunched up so fast. XD it was borderline bitter with the amount of alcohol. I didn't know Grand Marnier was flammable. I feel like they mixed it with something to light it. I can't dock rating for something I was warned about. The orange jam they used is really delicious with seemingly candied orange peel in it too. I believe all their jams are homemade so I cant wait to try other ones they have ! 

The owner, Maggie, was super nice. She was the one who took order order, did my crepe suzette, and ran out thanking us for the $2 bill tip we left on the table. What a funny person ! Would love to come back and try the galettes and other crepes ! too bad they close by the like 3-4pm so it definitely not during a weekday/workday.",Ksp1e9Dw0Jcog_ZBD3-45g,0,0,4,mBk2imqenYjvgcGw0WviAg

The owner and her employee were nice and tried their best to accommodate the large crowd, but service suffered. We were there forever. Not sure why only 2 people were working on Mother's Day. 
Main cons:
The coffee was really poor and the girl looked confused when we asked for sweetener. I basically spent 4 bucks on a latte I didn't drink. Also she said she had almond milk but told me when she brought my drink that they didn't have any left. She made it instead with coconut milk without asking me. Whatever. 
Next, to be blunt.....
The food just wasn't good. I was surprised since the owner is French and seemed to have some other decent reviews. I had the Sophie, my husband had the crepe of the month and my son ordered a sweet crepe with Nutella. 
My crepe was a buckwheat batter and dry. I knew it was going to be buckwheat but expected a soft fluffy texture with cheesy oozing toppings. The cheese was not melted and the veggies lacked flavor. 
My husbands pears were not mascerated in anything and they had no flavor so the Gorgonzola was very unbalanced. All salt no sweet. 
My son had a sweet crepe -hard to go wrong with Nutella, but it wasn't as good as expected either. 
Aside from the food, the sweet young girl employee was wearing thongs,as in flip
Flops. Just not appropriate in a kitchen/cafe. Cheapens the place.

Maggie is a ""celebrity chef"" from the south of France who imported a little bit of France to Las Vegas.  French Maggie. French staff. French menu. But most important to me- French ingredients (ok, the coffee is from Italy!)
For the healthier inclined- the galettes (buckwheat crepes) are made to be meals.  Delicious, filling, nonGMO gluten free meals. Like most Americans, I used to think of buckwheat from buckwheat pancakes- but more recent digging on my part has discovered what a ""superfood"" buckwheat is (see link below).  
For the less healthy inclined- the imported French wheat crepes are a bit sweeter and have dessert toppings. French wheat is naturally low gluten and most 'gluten sensitive"" Americans have discovered they can eat French wheat with no problems. 
At last you can eat delicious, organic, GMO free meals with no worries. Every mother in SW Las Vegas should be dragging her kids here every day!
The ambiance is great. Maggie is a kick and the other staff I have seen here are either from France (or Quebec perhaps which works for me too). 
Stop in and see Maggie (et ses amis) when you want a delicious inexpensive bite (or Italian cup of coffee) with no worries attached.

ICED COFFEE: Great brew, served in a double-wall tumbler for dining in, refills were offered. This was just strong enough, and made me interested in trying other caffeinated drinks on my next visit!

 Location isn't noticeable from the street, tucked into a small plaza with a few vacant spots. Service was super-sweet and interior is cute and rustic. I can see myself coming back frequently to experience the great food and service.

TIP: Check in when you walk in, there's a Yelp offer for 10% off. You can get one savory option, one sweet option, and a drink for under $20. Not bad at all!",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,20,15,4,pEGE4PPQ3yjl-rpYK0qwsg

It's one of these authentic hidden gems you must try out! There aren't that many in Vegas. 

The crepes and the smoothies are delicious. If you're looking for the crepe experience just like in France, this is the place! (I'm French). If you're looking for an Americanized version, you may be disappointed. For example, you won't find any ketchup at La Maison de Maggie, but you will find French mustard. The flour is imported from France, and you'll even find gluten free options. The smoothies are so fresh - made with fruits/veggies picked up at a local farm.

The restaurant closes too early to my taste (6pm), but Maggie is alone and does everything herself. Given the quality of the food, it's ridiculously cheap (a savory crepe = a full meal = less than 10 bucks). I hope Maggie raises her prices because I want her to stay in business!

I'm very fond of galettes from my experience with a French bistro in Denver and Maggie's have to be the best in Las Vegas. Her galette batter is made with buckwheat flour from France, which is naturally gluten free. She also imports French wheat flour for her crepe batter- glutenous and delicious. Galettes make a perfect savory meal and crepes are great for a sweet snack. Most local places use crepe batter for both sweet and savory applications and that doesn't taste right. In my opinion, caramel is for crepes and pesto is for galettes.

I read over the menu behind the counter and decided to try the Flying Baby galette because it includes blue cheese. Asking Maggie why it is called Flying Baby, she explained that she named her menu items after family members and related a story of her godson in France bouncing around the house with so much energy, earning the nickname Flying Baby.

I took a seat at the bar and watched as Maggie prepared my galette. A few minutes later, my order was ready and she presented my plate. The galette was filled with a lot of melted cheese (mozzarella and Gorgonzola) and warm tomato slices. I love to combine bites of galette with the side of crisp lettuce topped with a perfect French whole grain mustard dressing. It was almost too much food, but I finished my plate and left full.

I'll be back with my daughter to try the crepes and smoothies. I just hope she is not able to reach the shelf of Kinder Surprise eggs, because she is addicted to opening those things.

Crispy savory crêpes for the win! 

My love and I recently came to La Maison de Maggie with one of our favorite yoga/Yelp friends and I completely enjoyed the experience. I don't mind sharing a sweet crêpe, but it's not something I'd normally order on my own. Savory crêpes on the other hand is a different story... Enter La Maison de Maggie with as many savory crêpe selections as the sweet variety...allowing us the opportunity to order away. I was able to try the France, Sophie, and Matt. These were all savory crêpes and, as such, made with buckwheat flour (the sweet counterparts are made with whole-wheat floor). I liked the crispy, almost overcooked, execution of these savory delights. I wasn't overly impressed with the chicken or ham in these options, but at the inexpensive price I wasn't really expecting to be either.

Maggie was a one-person-show the day we came in, taking orders, making the crêpes, and serving them as well. She was efficient, though it wasn't terribly busy at the time...A couple large groups came in when we were finishing up and I wondered how she would do then. The setting is nice-adorned with pleasing lighting and otherwise simply decorated with a few large pictures. There is also a long counter with seating. The space is finished with a few other items for sale, such as jams made in-house.

I'd come back, as well as recommend it to anyone looking for a sweet or savory crêpe experience.",A5A34ixb-yy6nwL42iZsnw,23,17,4,Q6agzPNv8HMdNiYy_JQKvg

I ordered the FLYER crepe And I added spinach and an egg to it. It was loaded and filling! The crepe batter itself was very plain and thin. It was just okay. I think I enjoyed the side salad (w/ their HM honey mustard dressing) that came along with it better than the actual crepe. 
My boyfriend ordered the Ham, egg and cheese crepe. The crepe was over cooked and the crepe batter was cracking. Not the typical French crepe I was expecting. 
I also ordered a hazelnut latte to go along with my meal, and also.... Nothing special. It wasn't sweetened and I had to add my own sugar. :/ I was quite disappointed....

Their crêpes are great, and very authentic, not only because they use different flour for the galettes (savory crêpes) and dessert crêpes, but because it's organic, and actually imported from France.  The crêpes (the pancake part) have a delicate flavor, with a nice bit of sponginess.  The fillings are fresh and flavorful.  There is also a nice selection of fresh-made fruit and vegetable juices.  Their coffee drinks are also great.  The accent is on fresh fare that leaves you satisfied, but not overstuffed. Decorations are pleasant, without being overwhelming, and Maggie is warm and friendly.  The fact that French natives love to eat here tells you a lot about the quality and authenticity of the offerings at La Maison de Maggie.",PhRj3okiYEWNLnlCihwOHA,0,0,5,WEQK7mD0EEXxB7Hxuq1pGA

When you walk in the restaurant you will see two big boards one with ""Buckwheat Flour Crêpes,"" which contains their savory selections and another with ""Whole Wheat Flour Crêpes "" which contains their sweet selections.

I ordered a cappuccino, and ""French"" which is Egg, Ham, and Cheese. I also added Spinach for $1 extra. There is a water station right by the door that is self serve...my love brought our table some water while we waited for our crêpes and my drink. My Cappuccino came in a double insulated cup that kept my coffee hot throughout my dining. Mademoiselle Maggie has three Crêpe cookers on and was manning the kitchen herself, as well as taking and serving all the orders.  All three of us in our party ordered savory crêpes, which all came with small salads with a perfectly balanced mustard dressing.

The Crêpes were a perfect shape and void of burnt edges. The egg on my crêpe came sunny side up egg and sat right in the middle of it.  I love how simple and delicate the crêpe was...no fuss...just an envelope of good ingredients in a perfectly cooked Buckwheat flour crêpe.

For what La Maison de Maggie lacks in style this place makes up for in flavor. I sat at the bar and ordered two crepes; a savory and sweet. The Nancy (savory) is filled with fluffy egg whites, turkey, and fresh spinach. I'm trying to watch the heavy food intake these days so this was the perfect light lunch meal. All the fixings inside were amazingly fresh, the spinach still had that crunch, the eggs were like soft protein filled pillows, and the turkey wasn't that pressed deli stuff, but sliced fresh gobble, gobble goodness. 

The Alli (sweet) was on point, the menu states that this comes with either sugar or cinnamon, but I requested both, sugar on the inside and cinnamon on the outside. This was the perfect cap during my lunch and I highly suggest anyone who comes here to get both a sweet and savory crepe, they have about ten options of each. 

I do have to mention, the crepes here taste nothing like any crepe I've had anywhere in Vegas, or beyond for that matter. They're light, soft, and have a delightful sublet flavor. I would even use the word, ""elegant"" to describe these. After I was done I was told that a large portion of the menu ingredients and cooking techniques are directly from Paris and the surrounding areas. I should have known, because the entire staff here has the thickest of French accents.

3371089,2016-03-26,1,2B46bRpDh49eDyjXGhL_ZQ,"I studied and lived in France for a short while, and like another Yelper said ""Anyone who is French, or has been to France has a place in their heart for crepes"". This couldn't be a truer statement. So many times, I've given American ""creperies"" a chance to fill the void, and each time I've been sadly disappointed. All the whipped cream piled high makes no difference, to me. When I read the description of La Maison de Maggie on Yelp and saw that Maggie imports her flour from France to make her delicious crepes, I immediately knew that I had to try this place, because anyone that's ever tasted a French crepe knows that the difference is in the flour, NOT the toppings (as many crepe restaurants here in Vegas seem to think). 

La Maison de Maggie is the real deal. I walked in on a, thankfully, very quiet afternoon. I didn't feel like dealing with a crowd, but I was desperate for a delicious crepe. Maggie was behind the counter making a crepe for a woman on the other side of the bar. I walked in quietly and gazed at the menu board, although I'd already planned out in advance (through Yelp photos and French experience) what I was going to order.

Maggie greeted me with a smile. She looked very welcoming and kind, with hard work in her face. When she was done making the woman her crepe, she came over to ask me what I would like. I asked for the Alex, for nostalgia's sake, and sat down at the bar and told her I would be enjoying it there in the restaurant. I noticed earlier that Maggie was speaking to the other woman, who had already left by then, in French. I decided to whip out some of my French and we had a great conversation about her time here in Vegas and the hardships of opening her own business here in Las Vegas. She is a hard-working woman who makes the most delectable TRUE FRENCH CREPE I've ever had away from the Homeland. She works by herself during the week and has a little help during the weekends. This business is ALL her.

The Alex has pears, caramel, cinnamon and powdered sugar. It was the perfect amount of sweet that I was craving. The crepe was thin (exactly the way it should be) and had the lightly spongey texture that I've missed so much in the 3 years since I was last in France. The pears weren't soggy inside the warm crepe; you could still feel a tiny crunch in the middle of the slices. The Alex reminded me of a crepe I had when I was young and in love in Paris. What a time in my life! 

I'm telling you, the difference is in the flour. If you have any semblance of an idea of what a crepe tastes like, but have never been to France. Scratch it. You know nothing. I mean that in the most ""you have got to try this place"" way. Trust me. Maggie named all of the menu items after her friends and family in France. Everything feels that it was created with love and affection. She tries to steer clear of Yelp, because she is wary of negative comments. She simply enjoys what she does and wants to happily serve the delicious crepes that she creates. I encourage everyone to give it a try. The next time I go, I'll take photos and order a thing or two. My first priority, this time, was to get a foot in the door and try it out.

I have to say, between my meal and the split dessert I was full in a nice way. I try to avoid gut bombs, and I also don't like to walk away hungry. We split the chestnut vanilla jam filled crepe and it was to die for! I heard about the jam from a woman who ate there and buys it from the owner. I also had a latte and almond milk is an option. This is a small place and it is fantastic that they accommodate dietary restrictions. 

The owner is from France and imports most of the ingredients, yes it may seem pricy to some, but it makes up for itself in flavor and ambiance.  I love the retail items she had and I kicked myself for not grabbing a jar of the chestnut vanilla jam. That is ok because I plan on returning with my Mom this week because there is a psychic who does readings and they have a special combo with a 15 minute reading!

Say Bonjour to Maggie when you go to eat!

We both had galette (savoury buckwheat crepe) each and they came with a side salad. Crepes we ordered were
Polo - ham, blue cheese, fresh spinach and Flying Baby- tomato, mozzarella and blue cheese. You can add any ingredient for $1.

The only thing that stood out was the Dunkin Donuts and Arby's in this small shopping plaza that is across the street from Desert Breeze Park. However, once you enter this small yet inviting restaurant, you're warmly greeted by the friendly staff. The cool thing about this cafe is the open bar where you're able to watch your crepe being made. It reminded me of the many crepe places in France. 

I ended up getting the Nancy Galette (savory crepe) which contains Egg Whites, Turkey, and Fresh Spinach. It was simply delicious and consistent throughout. The buckwheat was not dried out and was soft in texture. I didn't get a chance to try their Sweet Crepes, since I was planning to try another cafe in the area.

As for the Galettes, I would definitely recommend this place. I was able to try the Matt Galette which contains Chicken, Mushrooms, and Cheese. Overall, a great French spot in Vegas!

4107041,2017-09-06,8,2B46bRpDh49eDyjXGhL_ZQ,"I finally tried what some publications and people have called the best crepes in Las Vegas. I can't quite concur with that high praise though.

La Maison de Maggie is a little shop not far from Desert Breeze Park that offers crepes, galettes (savory buckwheat crepes), smoothies, and drinks both non-alcoholic and otherwise. They're in the back of a plaza containing an Arby's and are sandwiched between some driving school and the ironically liquor license-less breakfast/lunch spot Mimosas.

We were greeted promptly upon entry and nudged to order at the register before sitting, which is pretty much standard at these places. Glad I was able to save on the bill because the offerings here are pricey. Nevertheless, we ordered, found a table, then received our order relatively quickly. It was after when any typical weekday lunch rush would happen, so hopefully this wasn't a bad sign for them.

France ($11): galette with egg (chose sunny side up rather than scrambled), ham, and cheese. I enjoyed the galette itself, the runny yolk, and the ham and cheese. It felt like I got a little more cheese in a thicker form in this galette than at my favorite galette, but I didn't quite enjoy the flavors of the ham and cheese as much here. Plus, this galette is significantly more expensive.

Tom ($8): crepe with Nutella, banana, whipped cream. Loved the chewiness of the crepe and the Nutella, and banana had the right ripeness/sweetness. The whipped cream was good, but it wasn't magical as I've had at some places. The price is the same as my local favorite crepe, but the flavors were merely delicious and not heavenly.

Iced coffee ($2.50): strong coffee flavor, not too bitter, doesn't have that ""grassy"" tone that I've experienced and disliked from Stumptown and other roasters. It's the one area that's superior to the offerings at my favorite crepe spot.

I would love to give 4.5 stars to La Maison de Maggie, but considering the limitations of Yelp's rating system and my unwillingness to place this on the same level as my favorite crepe place (let's just say they're named for the Brittany region of France), I'll have to round down to 4. The crepe and galette menu does have more variety here, so hopefully I can try some of the less familiar offerings if and when I get a little bored of the other creperie. However, both are pretty far from my Henderson home, so I don't foresee that happening very often.",_VMGbmIeK71rQGwOBWt_Kg,9,10,4,jjPEhthrUUZu2wUdV2r3Mg

Here is my quick review of La Maison de Maggie and the phenomenal meal I had. My girlfriend and I got the Marion galette and the Matt galette and were to say the least, astonished. The lattes we both ordered were made to perfection and are exactly what a latte should be! There is no need to fear getting a poorly made coffee here like other places. Maggie has standards and most importantly CONSISTENCY! Great service too which is obviously key to a great experience. 
Also, the mimosas we ordered were delicious because of the fact that Maggie uses REAL champagne in them and not sparkling wine. Also, the coffee is Lavazza brand!
Honestly, you have to try La Maison to Maggie if you're in the mood for a great quality meal.

This is the perfect crêpe brunch spot and you are going to be instantly charmed by the cute little details of the place, including the decorative naming of the crêpes and the specialities written out on the chalkboard. The various compositions of different crêpes on the menu all sound pretty great that I had trouble choosing what I wanted first, but eventually I opted for the Marion crêpe (tomatoes, mozzarella cheese and pesto) and one sweet crêpe, the Domi. They were both delicious, sweet, satisfying! The crêpes can take just a little while to make, but they are well worth it. Ingredients are simple and fresh. Usually, there are no more than three or four ingredients per crêpe. Everything was seasoned lightly and allowed for the natural flavors of the ingredients to come out.  I would have liked perhaps a more traditional French dressing on my salad otherwise everything was very good. The smoothies are to die for and I would highly recommend the Domi crêpe, which had the perfect amount of salted caramel (not too sweet) and chopped nuts with vanilla ice-cream.

As the Editor-in-chief of French Quarter Magazine, I looked for a good French café in Las Vegas where I could take my guests and Maggie, the owner, welcomed us as we entered her restaurant. She shows her love for her heritage by the South of France inspired decoration, to her quotes written in French on the walls, the clocks on the wall showing the time difference between the U.S. and France, and of course crêpes! When you get here, you get exactly what you look for: minimalistic design, simple ingredients, and great service. For a moment, I almost felt like I was back in France with the talk radio playing in the background.

We had a galette (savoury buckwheat crepe) each and they came with a side salad.  I believe it was the owner, Maggie who greeted us, made the crepes, and did the serving.

Crepes were delicious, light, but satisfying for breakfast.  The only reason why my review fell short of 5*s is because the coffee wasn't great.  Having said that, I never really had a good coffee during my stay in Vegas.

I sat at the bar since all the tables were huge & preferably for bigger parties.

It didn't have any sweetener added to it, which is how I like my coffee. The galette came soon after and I enjoyed it very much. I probably should have added a little bit of cheese or something.

No cozy date booth, but it's fun to enjoy the company of other people enjoying the same thing as you.  It's a small place so sometimes there's a wait for seating. 

There are two options for crepes,  1 savory menu and the other sweet.   The savory is naturally gluten free.  The sweet you must request the gluten free batter and let them know if you've a severe reaction and they can heat up the spare grill for you. 

Savory crepes come with a small salad tossed with their homemade dressing.  I wish they would sell it,  it's so very good and simple. 

These are authentic crepes done in  the French style.  They're rather large.  Two of us usually order 1 of each savory and sweet then share them.

They serve some alcoholic drinks,  have coffee served in french fashion.  No sweet starbucks concoctions here.  Just good ,strong correct coffee.

The best traditional crepes you'll find in Las Vegas!!!

I came here during the start of the Christmas season, the ambiance here is so beautiful with Christmas decorations, listening to Jingle Bells in French definitely raised festive levels.  

The Galette (savory crepes) & regular sweet Crêpes involve authentic French buckwheat and wheat flour which are imported from France. Crepe tends to feel light on the stomach and unlocks the natural flavor from the fresh ingredients to come alive. They don't add lots of ingredients to the crepes, quite frankly it doesn't need more stuff, sometimes keeping it simple is the best. I actually had room enough to eat two crepes, in France that's very common.  

Maggie (owner) is very kind, friendly person and she's passionate about the products she makes. She loves her culture and wants to deliver on that taste of France experience all the time. 

These are my favorites so far, I have to go back try some more.

La Maison de Maggie is owned and operated by Chef Maggie Reb, who's cooking up authentic French cuisine at her restaurant on Durango.  Offering up crepes and galettes, I've visited twice in an attempt to widen my French food horizons.  Upon entering the café on my most recent visit, the sweet smell of strawberry basil jam being cooked on the stove greeted my gal pal and I.  Chef Maggie was making a new batch to sell and I'm sure it went quickly.  I had my first galette, the July special, with mozzarella, tomato, goat cheese, and honey.  You can sit at the counter and watch your food being made in front of you.  Using authentic buckwheat and wheat flour imported from France for her crepes and galettes, Chef whipped up our orders in no time.   My galette was delicious, especially with the pairing of the cheese with the honey.  Chef Maggie also let us sample the freshly made strawberry basil jam: ooh la la!

Great local business to support!",fcb3NvbGr9qaPPLUlSnk6A,0,1,5,vGbnOlQs4CX4ZR3-yJh3-g
