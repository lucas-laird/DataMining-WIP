However this review isn't because of the food, or the employees...it's the uncleanliness. I have been coming to this location for years since I work so close however the sanitary standards are way too unpredictable. Sometimes it is average and other times outright disgusting. I have always complained to myself that they don't have toilet seat covers or flushable toilets, however I ran into a girl with a newborn and she couldn't even change her baby since unexpectedly and shockingly there isn't a changing table in the women's restroom!! McDonald's?! I am just tired of seeing flies flying around the restaurant consistently and today few of them swarming in the restroom since the toilets looked like they haven't been cleaned in many hours.

However, after my most recent experience with this one, I just had to. The black gentleman who took my order in the drive through, was so unprofessional and rude, I actually left without my order, because He made the wrong order and kept arguing with me about it. I was like, can you just make what i ordered, and he was really bitchy to me. I mean they always get my order wrong at this mcdonald's it never fails, but this time, i actually caught it when i was paying because the price was off. He was such a jerk. I was like I don't think that is what I ordered, It is the wrong price. He says to me, well thats what i made so your gonna have to buy it. I thought he was joking and Then I realized he was seriously asking me to pay for this meal, that i did not order.

2985146,2018-06-16,0,Uw4z3M7H4buYtTGBrzFCSg,"Honestly, trash.
I never go out of my way to write a bad review. Especially for something as insignificant as McDonald's. I mean, the expectation on quality customer service and food definitely are not set high.
With that being said, here I am at 2 in the goddamn morning writing about how pissed I am.
First of all, this McDonald's has two drive through lanes that merge into one.
One of these lanes did not have a working speaker which wouldn't have been an issue, if they blocked it off so people know not to use it. By block it, i mean with cones or a gate. Something to alert guests to not drive through that lane. But instead, all they had was a tacky piece of paper with ""speaker broke"" in what was probably a crayola marker taped on the actual screen.
If you've been in the two lane drive through, you know it's impossible to back out of one after getting to the intercom.
So I was stuck there.
BTW, there was only 2 cars in front of me.
I couldn't order and I couldn't get out of line and I waited in that line for 45 freaking minutes. At one am. With a total of 2 cars ahead of me. How does that even happen?!
I was literally stuck there.
Finally I pull up to the window and NO ONE is there to greet me. The window is wide open and all I hear is employees laughing in the back for Atleast 3 minutes. Like come on. 
Eventually this lady gets to me and just asked how she can help me.
I explain to her the speaker situation and how I've been waiting for almost an hour and all she says is ""I know"" with a little laugh.
That was the most irritating part.
She told me my card was declined and i asked her to try it again. She said ""so you just want me to stand here and keep swiping it?""
Like.....? Yeah you douche. Obviously you're not doing sh*t else.
Finally it works and she sends me off.
I'm just freaking irritated.
So if anyone of importance reads this, please address this with the Pacific Islander lady that worked 1am on 6/16/18
She sucks.",jNkGIwVoQcJoQnIpvXOnkg,0,0,1,6a-kNCladwi1UXeIpoSP4A

I am never going to come back to this place ever again. The worst part was there was no apology for the wait.

Do not go to this McDonald's drive-through. Day, night, ever.  The worst part of it besides no apology was the fact that he just gave me my food after re-ordering it 10 minutes sitting there while he was getting it was a simple here you go.

Food?  Your standard McDonald's over-processed grub.  It's greasy, salty, but likely to bring back some fond memories.  I still get my Cheeseburger Happy Meal almost everytime.  But now with apples instead of the usual sleeve of crack-addled fries?  I don't know about that one.  Good try McDonald's getting through the childhood obesity barrier, but alas, you leave many kids whining for their fry fix.

Not taking stars away for this, but why is the blended coffee soooo sweet.  Why can't they just serve blended coffee in the light side, I probably would go a lot more often.
