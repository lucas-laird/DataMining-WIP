Has a ""mom and pop"" feel.

Food is good, I tried both the steak and the burger. Both were cooked exactly as requested. For about $6 you can also add a salad buffet. It is not huge by any means but it has all the ingredients you'd want in a salad.

Service is prompt.

Overall a nice place, quiet and friendly with decent food.",S-dfqUtbu7JybeU6mOTWmQ,1,0,3,kRjkJTGpzcer5-Z2qnWbcg

188851,2011-11-27,0,MUQS2XkrFl8QxCUHgSIzLA,"Was at Dessy's tonight for dinner. There were 3 of us and we had a 25 dollar gift certificate from restaurant.com.  The place is decorated kind of oddly. I'm not sure what all the pictures of indians around have to do with it. It seems like the wait staff wears like cowboy uniforms so it wasn't the most visually appealing decor I guess is what I'm saying. 

Our server was nice and attentive without being overbearing. One thing that sort of irked me was their drink glasses. They are like the thick glass pint glasses and with ice you don't get much of a drink in them so if you drink alot of beverages during your meal you're gonna be flagging down someone every couple minutes.  Also the menu had no wine or beer list, but I think they serve them. I have no idea really, the waitress never mentioned them. It woulda been nice because it's hard to spend 50 dollars here unless you're going to get steak or lobster which none of us we're in the mood for. 

The food we ordered came out quickly and was pretty good. I got the california chicken but I wouldn't order it again unless they put it between a bun with some bacon and some kind of ranch based sauce. It just doesn't belong on a plate by itself IMO.  The salad bar is good.  The greens and other mixins (basically anything you can want to put on a salad) are very fresh and inviting. They have 7 different salad dressings available as well. Also on the bar are wings, which are decent, pizza which I didnt try, tacos and nacho ingredients, pudding, ice cream, spaghetti? I think. 

So at the end of it all our bill was 45 before tax so we didnt end up using our coupon. We we're planning on having a drink or two which would of made it enough to use but the menu has nothing on it. We even looked for desserts and didn't see any. I think as a restaurant they would push things like drinks and desserts because that is what creates the higher checks and profit margins. 

I probably would not return for dinner because the food, mine at least, does not warrant a return and the salad bar, which I liked, at 9 dollars is just too much considering I can goto Sunset station for a dinner buffet @ 9.99.   However, being a small business, I definitely support them for what they are doing, and they obviously are doing something right for being open 3 years. If they change their decor and menu offerings a little I think they would generate a better business.",0jh6FM1kd6ecYs1ESjFZKA,0,0,3,s7Ij-RiA2W1iHmp4wP7Atg

We did not receive refills at all. She never checked in to see if we needed anything. Their salad bar supposedly offers ice cream but we were not offered that. Ordered country fried steak and that was very below average. It seemed like two frozen patties slapped with gravy. Salad bar was clean and fresh but nothing special. Although their fried chicken was really good! I would not recommended this restaurant and I will not be returning.

Lots of ""filler"" items such as jello salad, potato salad, whipped cream, etc.  The basics in terms of fresh veggies, but nothing exotic.

When we can into the restaurant we were first shocked to see how uninteresting the restaurant was and all the images on the wall. It plays to the tune of an old Wild West with Indians and Cowboys but it's not interesting in the least. 

The plates were averaged price but the quality was not so good. I did not enjoy any of the 4 plates we had. Each meal had lack of flavor and was presented with just the least bit of interest. We ended up spending close to $90 for 4 people and no one enjoyed the plates they got nor the service. It was hard to be interested in this place at all.

Why did other reviewers (vegas locals) give this restaurant  5 stars??
I have to agree with the previous reviewer, probably a local thing.
Makes me wonder if they are on the restaurant's payroll :)

Service is awful, we have to wait almost 45 mins to get our food, and its not even crowded that time.  I tried their burger, and at that price, it is no match for Kirk's steakburger in Palo Alto.  Heck, even In-and-Out taste better.  I guess other reviewers who gave their burgers 5 stars haven't tasted Kirks steakburger yet.

832295,2012-02-10,0,MUQS2XkrFl8QxCUHgSIzLA,"Hello All,

We went to Dessy B's last night just because we were in the neighborhood. What a pleasant surprise we had. It was a really nice ""locals"" restaurant. I would also say it is great for our family visitors and the Tourist Folks.

This place is 7 days a week. Serving breakfast, lunch, dinner, or anything any time you want to stop by. The menu is extensive. It is a steakhouse with more than steak.

The salad bar was full of fresh cold freshly prepared salad items. Not huge but, very good. There is also a Taco bar, Soup (Best Bean soup I've ever eaten) Spaghetti bar. Pizza, and ice cream machine. There are even hot crispy fried chicken wing pieces. All this can be yours for just under $9.00 or have it with your meal for about $4.00.

Our Server was Ashley. She savvy and friendly. She walked us through the menu and made the right suggestions for us. We both had 1 lb. Rib Eye Steaks with a baked potato. OK, Wife likes her steaks dead. I on the other hand like mine to flop around when I cut into them. These two steaks were perfectly cooked for each of us. The bakers were big and mine, as I had asked came filled with sour cream and butter. I was to full for dessert but, Libby had a nice piece of cherry pie and then took it to the ice cream machine and buried it in sweet vanilla ice cream.

Our next trip here will be this weekend to try the breakfasts. This is going to become a regular stop on our evenings out to dinner. This is NOT "" LV Strip"" food. It is better and a lot less costly.

Try it, you will enjoy this relaxed atmosphere and plain good food.

Let me start off by saying that our server Ophilia was one of the best servers I've ever had! She was super friendly and great with my kids. I had the new York strip mashed potatoes and the salad bar. The steak was cooked perfectly and the salad bar was one of the freshest I've seen. They even have fried chicken and tacos on the salad bar. It was delicious! Unfortunately the yumminess stopped there. The mashed potatoes were instant. As an irish girl I am just not OK with this! We got an onion ring appetizer they were OK definitely frozen. My husband and sons all got burgers. My son's are 3 and 11 McDonald's is gourmet to them so they happily ate them. My husband said he's had worse. It wasn't bad just wasn't good either. No seasoning.,dOlXmrZ6pZzEusS283utzQ,0,0,3,yMv_aMQz86Y7JbnGJd-T7w

869159,2013-05-29,0,MUQS2XkrFl8QxCUHgSIzLA,"This place was fantastic. A couple things to note: some menu items on the website are not on their menus at the restaurant. It needs to be requested.

My dad got Teriyaki pineapple chicken. He said it was not bad. The pineapples are chopped up into little tiny pieces which is cute. The dish comes with the choice of vegetables, chips, fries or baked potato. He got baked potato - the baked potato came with butter - A LOT of butter. That was pretty surprising. Overall, he liked it. 

My mom got the salad bar - now, I am very much impressed by the salad bar. You can eat a heck out of that mini buffet. It doesn't just have salad; it has pasta, pizza, taco, fried chicken and ice cream. Ice cream wasn't ready when we went there so aw. But, it's alright.

My brother got grilled chicken something with chips. Now, the grilled chicken is pretty small, actually. It is covered with ham and some kind of cheesy alfredo sauce. 

I initially ordered the bottomless fried shrimp - it was one of the menu items online. But they will not have it ready until very later so I got the alfredo baja chicken pasta instead. It was pretty delicious. The alfredo sauce was not as creamy, but I like it that way so it was nice. And, it came with toasts. 

I used the groupon for 4 ppl so it was pretty cheap. Even if I didn't have the coupon and I live in vegas, I would go back.",7oY-rFJR9uHMnsnc6EIkww,5,1,5,cf6Z9oduVEdUBFPfgSISsA

957728,2011-04-11,0,MUQS2XkrFl8QxCUHgSIzLA,"First off, I am always a supporter of ""Mom and Pop"" businesses and when I heard the story behind Dessy's I had to check it out. I have to be honest though. It wasn't that good. 

We went in about 7pm on a weekday, it was empty inside and the employees working seemed preoccupied with cleaning and preparing to close the restaurant rather than wait on guests. Once we got situated our server was attentive though and provided decent service. I am in the restaurant industry and I know the difference between being an order taker and being a good server. That night we got order taker service. 

I ordered a steak, it was tough and more of the steak was not edible than was edible. The fries were good and the salad bar was just OK. There was not much of a selection and everything seemed to have been sitting out for quite a while. However, I understand why. They are a new establishment and they are trying to stay afloat in a crummy economy. They use lower quality cuts of beef, and try to keep as much food as possible from spoiling and are reusing what they can for as long as they can. 

A few tips to the management if you are reading this. Get some better cuts of meat, add more to the salad bar, refresh the food in the salad bar more often, and train your waiters to work more on impressing the guests and being more than an order taker and your business will be much better off. I am willing to give Dessy's another shot for sure though. Don't write this place off though. Give them some time to grow and mature as a business and you will have a decent place to grab a quick bite.

Enough history.  Our Mothers Day dinner was absolutely delicious!  I had the 10oz Prime Rib from a special Mothers Day menu.  For about $20, it included choice of potato, and a trip to the salad bar.  What a bargain!!
The Prime Rib was the best I've eaten in YEARS!  It easily beat out others I have had, costing 3-4 times the price, such as at The Golden Steer.  Tender, succulent, and juicy; I honestly LOVED it.

Food was good... decently priced!  And the service was awesome!!! (Yeah, I know I said that already... )

Basically, there's a main menu where you get your burgers, steaks, seafood and then an all-you-can-eat salad bar which you can add-on to your main menu or just have it all by itself.  I had a steak and fried shrimp special which included a soda (w/ free refills), all-you-can-eat salad bar, and the steak and shrimp w/ mashed potatoes.  Okay, so the mashed potatoes were crap... I'd recommend getting fries instead, or maybe something else... I paid less than $20 for this meal which I think is pretty damn good...

1747327,2010-07-01,0,MUQS2XkrFl8QxCUHgSIzLA,"We were visiting Vegas this week and asked a lady that lived in the area for a steakhouse along the lines of Outback but that was local - something the tourists don't get to see. She suggested Dessy B's. It was a great pick!

The decor was a bit outdated, but the story of how this steakhouse came to be is a good one, so you can't really blame them, and honestly, decor doesn't have a ton to do with decent food.

The story is that the steakhouse used to be a Sizzler, but Sizzler decided to close four restaurants in the area, leaving tons of people out of work. The district manager for these Sizzlers decided it was time for him to open his own restaurant. He got a loan, hired back most of the employees from the closed restaurant and named it Dessy B's. The employees themselves actually helped re-finish the interior to change it over from Sizzler and I think if I remember correctly they actually own part of the business.

Anyway, the food is pretty good. I wouldn't say five star, but definitely better than a Sizzler! My boyfriend and I split the chicken and steak dinner with broccoli on the side and it was plenty for two people. The food was simple, but tasty - like it was made in Mom's kitchen.

They serve breakfast, lunch and dinner. We wanted to go back for breakfast but our Canadian friends wanted to go to an IHOP (apparently they don't have those in Canada). I'm sure breakfast would've been equally good. 

The prices weren't bad - we split a dinner remember, but the total bill for the chicken AND steak dinner and two drinks was $16 (without tip).

I think those visiting Vegas and looking for something a little less flashy than the strip will really enjoy this place, and if you're a local definitely check it out!",mE3HMtpGEMj-kEM5JcKbSw,3,1,4,qUdiWihQZFBblYUHILvJUA

If you're looking for BREAKFAST near Trop and Eastern, Dessy Burger is definitely a place to try. We hit a lot of breakfast joints in northern Henderson and we ventured up north to check this place out. We give it two thumbs up. (The Five Stars is because it is such a great bargain. If it were a few dollars more I'd drop the rating to Four Stars.)

We went on a Saturday morning around 9 am and we did not have to wait to get a seat. When we first got there and realized that the only way to go was the buffet, we were a bit concerned. We recently had a free full breakfast buffet in a hotel's restaurant and it was abysmal. 

Once we saw that the eggs were fresh and fluffy and there was a good selection of other items we felt a little better. But when we found out that it was $5.99 and that included a drink, we were hooked. Rather, it reminded us of the era in Vegas, not too long ago, where great cheap eats were abound. (ThirstBusters $1.99 breakfast, anyone?)

The eggs were as good as they looked. The bacon and sausage were of very acceptable quality for being all you can eat. (At $5.99, mind you.) Of the breakfast bready type stuff, the French toast sticks were my fav. They had three types of hot cereal, although I have to say that one of my very few disappointments was that the grits were not very good. I like grits and I'm not excessively picky, but there were many other yummy options that I wouldn't gave them again. 

It's cool that the full salad bar was available. They had many other nice touches like biscuits and gravy, Mexican breakfast items, and Soft-Serv ice cream. The staff was very good. The atmosphere was like an old style Sizzler, but it was clean and had high ceilings which made it feel open and bright.

Our bill came and was $12.95 for the both of us. We were totally satisfied and happy to have discovered this gem. We definitely like the places like The Cracked Egg, but if you're looking for a good breakfast for a price that's hard to beat, check out Dessy Burgers.",_fFpucW8mSKvFJ46zSJCrg,3,2,5,U1gqUujbpjrgSu65U21e5Q

The food is great! I usually walk out of here with a stomach full of baked potato, shrimp, and steak, while my wallet only lost about $30. I can't complain! Good food at reasonable prices.

One of the things I dislike about this place is the salad bar. While there is more than just salad, it contains items for ice cream (sauces, peanuts, etc.) but there's never been any ice cream :( I asked once if they have any and was told no. That was a disappointment. The only thing they really have in terms of dessert at the salad bar are chocolate pudding and jello. Also, I ate the salad yesterday and the lettuce was so watered down I couldn't finish it all.

Yesterday left a sour taste in my mouth. I ordered the 10 oz. steak - the one for $12.99 but was charged for the one that costs $17 instead. There are two menus - the regular one and the ""specials"" one; when I ordered, I pointed at the $12.99 one so I'm not sure why I was charged more.

My first bite was gristle, the next bite was all fat and my third bite was a very rare under cooked piece of meat (I ordered it medium well). It went that way for the rest of my dinner, with about every other bite either gristle or fat. I eventually started piling the pieces of fat on the side of my plate (Picture attached). The price point was $17.99 for a very rough piece of meat and a small potato. The server came back to refill drinks and didn't ask how the steak was or if it was cooked right. When you order the highest priced item on the menu, some inquiry about how it came out is expected. This place used to be a Sizzler years ago and I think people still come here for the extended salad bar. If that's what you want to offer, then don't advertise as a steakhouse.

3732269,2016-06-20,1,MUQS2XkrFl8QxCUHgSIzLA,"I'm sorry they had to close. I think it's wonderful what the owner did trying to keep the old staff from Sizzler together.
However customer service was poor! And the food quality took a turn for the worse for a long time.
I had been loyal to this restaurant for yrs until the owners son and I got into it. I never went back.
Their is one waitress I hated there with a passion. She came over to my table and verbally lashed out at me for telling another patron about the senior special. Told me to keep my mouth shut. I was shocked she was allowed to be so rude. So it was common knowledge to everyone ( mgmt & staff ) she is to stay away from me.
Once I was meeting up with friends and had suggested we eat at Dessys. I arrived first and got a table in the nice waitresses  section and when they walked in the witch from Hell was with them as they joined me. She told me I am going to be the waitress at this table and I said when Hell freezes over. We will leave!
She always a phony smile glued to her face but didn't care about you or what you really wanted.!All  she wanted was your money and to make sure you had a huge check before you got out of the restaurant!
Everyone else was pretty nice. Loved Big Al and Rita. Everyone but the witch and the owners son. I use to give the owners son who was breaking in to being a waiter a few $2 bills if I had someone else waiting on me when he came in to work because he was a young kid and reminded me of my grandson. Well one night he ruined my loyalty forever trying to be in charge!  He told me this bit*h waitress ""WAS "" going to wait on me and that if I didn't like it too bad! What a mistake.
So I went over his head and had insisted a call to one of his parents. ( owners )
They know the situation and told me she won't be waiting on me. I was so furious how their son treated me after being a loyal customer and lining his pockets when I didn't need to that I never went back! 
How this lowlife waitress kept her job I finally figured it out. This really old couple walked in and she was their waitress. I heard them ask her if they had any specials and she proceeded to tell them steak specials. They just ate from the salad bar nothing else and just drank water.  It made me so angry she was pushing the high menu items refusing to show them the senior menu with great deals! You could tell they were poor. I hate this woman!  I'm not going to mention her name because I waited to long to post this and she is gone now anyway. She's a user and I wouldn't trust her to take your last penny if she could get it. I'm sorry the owner couldn't keep it open with all the competition. I'm thinking when Golden Corral opened that had to hurt them. I feel bad for the nice staff that lost their jobs and I hope they have found new jobs and are happy!  Someday she will have to pay karma for her greed.",mZaufXzJaJompD0AjJRz9A,1,1,4,YFVu-Ox3oLkTxsXGHl_rJw

Realized I really didn't need the additional food. The entree was plenty. The trout was seasoned perfectly and grilled to perfection. The skin easily seperated from the tender fish meat. We really like to bring the kids because of the all-u-can-eat salad bar. It is always fresh with the usual stuff as well as pizza, pasta, tacos and wings. The latter is the main reason we go for the kids. Order just the salad bar, $6.99 for adult, $5.99 for Tweens and $4.99 for kids under 12.

No flavor and it tasted horrible. For 35 dollars, she almost broke into tears from this horrible meal. My father ordered a well done steak. What came out was a chewy, cheap, fatty, and undercooked meat. He could hardly finish it. The steak and lobster felt like I was chewing a rubberband rather than actual expensive food.

    ""The service was great and was very friendly.""
    ""The service was still equally attentive, without being clingy.""
    ""I came for a good burger and got one!""
The story behind the restaurant is that the District Manager bought out this restaurant when the Sizzlers closed up and pulled out of Vegas. He rehired the original staff and changed the food so it was, err, um, good. And it is. The food is good, and the salad bar is an excellent value. I like making a taco salad using lettuce, taco meat, ground beef and salsa. 
From the menu I ordered a burger and was very pleased with it. Drink refills came automatically without the glass ever hitting empty. The service was friendly and the atmosphere relaxing and pleasant. Unlike the old dark shadowy Sizzler restaurant, Dessy Burgers was repainted in light colors for an airy look and feel.
It is true no restaurant can be everything to everyone, and I noticed a 1 star rating a little down this list. Let's be clear that there is not a buffet in this restaurant; instead there is a large salad bar remaining from the sizzler. Aside from salad you will find a build your own taco bar, hot pizza and an assortment of fresh fruits. For desert there is a build your own sundae bar. 
This is an excellent choice for any casual meal, and I highly recommend it.",Jql0kDX77dWUZcRzGjPXLg,4,2,5,1YiMvunvQVr04Z1jVhVFBw

The whole time we were at the SB there were employees refilling/cleaning the area so that was good to see. I also liked that they didn't just have lettuce but they also had spinach.. I didn't like that they used cheap dried fake bacon bit things instead of actual real bacon bits.. I tried the soup that they had which was Split Pea with ham and it was pretty decent. The steaks were alright, nothing much to really say about them lol 

Service was friendly. Atmosphere is very dingy & old. Food was just ok.. All in all I would probably rather go to Sweet Tomatoes for all my salad bar needs since they are about the same price and because I would rather eat Sweet Tomatoes' chili than Dessy B's fried chicken haha 

HOT TIP: If you like people singing on your birthday let the server know.. they do the whole embarrass you by singing to you thing hahah",_ir8NHMtV7KPTwmBmlkmQw,3,1,3,15qeuQ8VROlQ6wBBdBh_cw

If you are looking for someplace that looks new and flashy, this is the wrong place. If you are looking for some great food and service, because you are hungry then you must stop.
If you are wondering why I only gave it four stars, the building and interior looks like it was built in the sixties and they haven't changed anything. The place was clean and well maintained just looked aged.",r1GQcCXHL3dF93OvDosOaw,1,1,4,1M1pWzRBvghh1Jc1Nu_xQQ

We were greeted and seated immediately. We had the New York steak special which came with one trip to the salad bar. Not bad for 13.99. The salad bar didn't have a huge selection but everything was very fresh and extremely clean. My salad was delicious! After our salads came the steak and a baked potato. The steak was nice and tender and the portion was ok. Not the best steak I ever had but far from the worst and cooked and seasoned very well. The baked  potato was very good and cooked perfectly. This is a very good place for a mid priced steak dinnerI will definitely be back again.

5199559,2010-07-30,8,MUQS2XkrFl8QxCUHgSIzLA,"So you think I only eat Asian food, well, as my neighbor announced tonight, ""Welcome to middle America."" There's nothing quite as un-Asian as a Sizzleresque dining experience, although I did see teriyaki chicken on the menu. Yes, Dessy B's is comparable to Sizzler, but we have a weakness for salad bars. This is one we had not tried. Couple that with the restaurant.com coupon being broadcast on the Yelp listing, and there is pretty much no way my husband could resist.

If you are staying on the Strip, this should not be a special trip for you. This is not a dry aged steak house; it is middle America on a plate. I too am a little surprised by the super high ratings, but I think there are ""charm"" stars lurking, as there is a certain unexplainable aura that comes from being served by friendly people in plaid. Call it the plaid bump.

The service is prompt, friendly, and unassuming. Refills hit the table before you finish your beverage, and as soon as you splash blue cheese on the salad bar, it is wiped up. 

The salad bar is definitely clean. You don't get the icky bar vibe. It might not be organic or have an abundance of super creative toppings, but it is clean and well-maintained. I am not sure I would drive across town for it again, but if I were driving by and hungry, I might give it a why the heck not visit. Included with the salad bar is soup, pizza, beef tacos, chicken wings, ice cream, and some super mushy looking noodles.

I also had BBQ chicken breasts with baked potato. The baked potato was a little over baked tasting. Do you know that flavor? The chicken was actually juicy and cooked just right. Although, we got into a debate as to whether the grill marks were real. Either way, it tasted A-OK, not foodie-licious, but like quality diner chicken.

I might make the trip back to try breakfast. Breakfast is hard to get totally wrong, and with the service, I could see how this meal could be a good call at Dessy's.

Probably 2.5 stars, but, well, it's a plaid bump. And, seeing the hub get so excited about jello cubes and sponge cake is worth something.",qewG3X2O4X6JKskxyyqFwQ,8,7,3,TU5zVgWhFhnfKjEqvZQsug

Decided to try again on Christmas Day 2014.  Service was a little better - more of an indifference of working on the day rather than a hatred, but we felt as if we were inconveniencing the staff.
Steak was not seasoned at all.  I hate to ruin a steak with steak sauce because I feel the meat should speak for itself - especially in a steakhouse with such positive reviews.  However, for the life of me I could not get enough A1 sauce on this steak to try to breathe some kind of flavor into it.

I ordered a steak, which came out perfect, just the way I like it.  Most places usually overcook the steak, but this place hit spot on. Besides that, my meal included a drink and the salad bar all under $20, which is pretty decent in my book.  Upon exploring the salad bar I came up to some things I didn't expect.  First off, when someone says salad bar, I only expect to get salad out of that.  This place surprised me when I was able to create my own nachos or tacos.  The additional choices in the salad bar took me by surprise.

The place is not for those seeking fine dining. It is very casual with a kind of dirty country feel to it. You can leave your heels at home ladies. I ordered the 16 oz. Ribeye mid-rare and it was a little on the tough side but the flavor was standard for an inexpensive steak joint.  My waitress for the evening was very attentive and pleasant. That goes a long way with this Yelper.  There was Contemporary Christian music playing in the background, not a deal breaker for me but could be a major turn off for some.

On monday, March 14th 2011, my son & I went to Dessie B's because I had a Groupon that I paid $15 that gave me a voucher to get $30 worth of food. 3/4 of the way thru dinner,  my son found a hair in his food! We told the server, & she offered to get him another order of fries! Well, if you are like me, you are turned off, & you are'nt eating anything else!
When I got the check, they did'nt take his meal off, & I was sitting there arguing w the manager! She offered that the next time we come in, he could get a kids meal comped, but that was'nt good enough for me, as I paid $13.99 for his steak & shrimp! She was explaining to me that my son ate 3/4 of his meal, & that comping him a kids meal would be fair! FAIR? He found a hair in his food! Then the waitress was arguing w me about the hair...are you kidding me? I told the manager not to worry about it, that I would pay for the whole bill, but that I would never come back! After arguing back & forth for about 15 minutes,she finally said,"" I don't want you upset & took the bill from my hand & told me not to worry about it..that she will take care of it""!  So as she is walking back to the kitchen, she proceeds to pick up my to go box & drink (that was sitting on the counter) to throw it out in the back!!!!!  I was just standing there up front watching her walk away!!!!! That was my food she took from me...it had nothing to do w me! And she also took my $30 voucher too!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! What a bad experience it was....
That was a big rip off, & I would suggest you never go there, cause if something is wrong w your food or you happen to find a hair...they prorate how much you have eaten, & give you the difference!!!!!!!!!!!
I could'nt believe how a manager handled the whole situation!
SHE TOOK MY FOOD...I paid for that voucher!!!!!! WHAT A RIP-OFF!
So, the bottom line was...I paid for two meals w my  $30 voucher that I paid for..1 meal had a hair..I paid for both, & then to top it all off...she takes my to go box that had my baked potato & a whole shrimp skewer!

The first time I came here two years ago I was seated and ordered then went to wash my hands before the food came.  I was so appalled by the condition of the restrooms I cancelled my order and walked out.  It was horrendous!!  The filthiest bathroom I've *ever* seen with the most bizarre decor.  Prior to that I had never walked out of a restaurant...and I'm not even that picky really.  Ever since then this place has been an inside joke between my husband and I.  He's always teasing me and threatening to take me to Dessy B's.  
Went yesterday 11-22-15 at 4PM for dinner.  The place is in bad shape, TBH.  The parking lot desperately needs to be re-paved...it's all uneven and the lines have faded from the spaces.  They have been filling the pot holes with kitty litter.  There's one right out front if you want to take a look.  The weeds out front are out of control and it looks like they fired their landscaper long ago.  The inside looks really dated, worn, and the cleanliness is questionable. I didn't go to the bathroom this time out of fear that I would lose my appetite.  I'd rather spend the night in a haunted house alone than go in that bathroom again.  
$55.53 got us a filet steak dinner, a NY steak dinner, two soft drinks, and cajun cheese fries.    Both of our dinners came with one trip to the salad bar.  
I thought the salad bar was going to be some wilted iceberg and a bottle of ranch by the looks of the place but I was pleasantly surprised with the salad bar.   Most things were fresh and they had some things I didn't expect like ice cream, pound cake, a taco bar, quesadillas, soup, and fried chicken.  If I ever go back I think I'll just do the bar because by itself it's $8.99 and pretty much worth it, IMO.  I fed my boy a couple pieces of cantaloupe from the bar and they didn't hassle me about it.  
The cajun cheese fries were quite tasty and came out piping hot.  They dusted them with cajun seasoning and poured some neon cheesy goodness on them.  
I had the 10 oz. filet steak dinner special for $28.99.  Kinda pricey but it was the third best steak I've ever had.  It was thick, cooked perfectly and melted in my mouth.  My potato was only partially cooked and I pulled a huge raw potato-iceberg out of the middle of it.  Didn't bother me much and wasn't worth complaining about.  
Husband was truly irritated with his $18.99 New York Steak dinner.  He asked for medium rare and it came out more like medium-well.  He found it pretty tough although he really enjoyed his potato which was cooked perfectly. 
I'd be really surprised if this place was open in 2017.  I enjoyed it because it reminded me of places back home in Tennessee but it seems to be on its last legs.  Good luck and God speed, Dessy B's.  I hope you make it.",VigsAph76fP7pechJ743EA,6,3,3,UQufvZmkstpRzNBoHTSZfQ

I will suggest this place for anyone that wants to enjoy a good meal for a great price. Dig the Native decor too ;)",ScFuhtsN54GU74ZyE-Go-g,0,1,5,xHF-kJOQM7Y_FlvTwmwNxQ
