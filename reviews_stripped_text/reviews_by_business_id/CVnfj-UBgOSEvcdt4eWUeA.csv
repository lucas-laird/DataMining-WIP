164568,2016-04-01,3,CVnfj-UBgOSEvcdt4eWUeA,"Really don't appreciate ordering take away, getting back to my office & the chicken looked off & wasn't even heated properly!  

This isn't a situation where my meal cooled because of the drive. 

This is a situation where the chicken strips in my Chicken Breast bowl were ICE COLD!  Like defrosted, but looked heated but tasted cold like an ice cube. 

Never going back. Whole Foods is the same price and it's cooked fresh. Unlike this place ... who apparently uses a microwave to heat frozen chicken out of a bag bought from Costco's frozen section!!!! 

It not only looked like frozen microwaved chicken (dry & stringy), the pieces of the chicken strip that weren't frozen & actually heated tasted dry. 

I'm saying heated instead of cooked. You don't COOK food in a microwave. You heat or defrost food in a microwave. Huge difference. 

If you want FRESH FOOD, you won't get it here.",9BuTUHt6Zlm-UCjaGD6aJQ,3,1,1,kxCk_F3bE224h4t49X8tXg

The order takers were young and looked bored/unenthused. Loud and at times offensive dance music was being played through the house speakers. When an order was ready, the server didn't have a very loud voice and often looked frustrated that nobody could hear her call out the names.

When my food finally arrived (the spicy chicken plate) the chicken had been overcooked and spiced unevenly. The noodles were good, and so were the vegetables -- still a good value for your money considering the quantity of food -- but this is not the place to have a quality relaxing meal. Overall it reminded me of a high school cafeteria with dance music. I will eat at the other location if I want this food again.",S8nyk8xt0MHrdwilzCKjgA,0,0,2,2ldxie4MqPyIYiR9fxhR6A

605457,2017-06-16,0,CVnfj-UBgOSEvcdt4eWUeA,"Usually my experience at Teriyaki Madness is nothing short of great.  The food is always fresh & the staff is always friendly.  However, my most recent experience was not a positive one.  

I called ahead to order a spicy veggie plate (no meat).  Sandra (the supervisor) told me that they can only make veggie dishes in bowls, not plates.  I explained that I simply wanted to sub veggies for meat in the size of a plate.  She put me on hold for a minute, and then told me she would do that for me and that my order would be ready for pick up in 10 minutes.

When I arrived the food was ready and I was helped by a young male cashier, who was very polite.  He told me the price would be $10.38 for my veggie & rice plate.  This confused me because this is even more expensive than a Chicken Breast Plate...  When I asked him why the veggies were so much more expensive he said he was a new employee and directed me to Sandra.  She proceeded to tell me that there's no button on their POS system for a veggie plate and that was the reason it was so expensive.  This still didn't make sense to me because on my receipt she charged me $7.09 for a veggie bowl and then an additional ""open food charge"" of $2.49...  Sandra insisted there was nothing she could do to lessen the price because there's no ""button"" on their system and she walked away to help other customers.  $10.38 is a lot of money to pay for white rice, cabbage, & broccoli.  Especially when the chick breast is cheaper!

Having worked in the food and beverage industry for many years (I even worked at Teriyaki Madness in my younger years) I know that there are ways to add, change, or delete certain charge amounts for ""open food"" charges.   

I rarely write negative reviews because I'm usually pretty understanding, but this situation was not handled professionally.  Sandra wasn't rude, but her lack of ability to work the POS system or find the right ""buttons"" does not reflect the competency of a supervisor.   Instead, it shows laziness & that guest satisfaction is not important.

This situation may sound small, but it's the small inconveniences like this that drive customers away.",51-Gd3B1jg3eUrFJEP44mA,0,0,2,SS7O9TtNH6FqPi_77dtnBQ

Not a good sign. The first thing I noticed was the few selections on the menu. Kinda like chipotle. I just ordered the traditional teriyaki chicken bowl. I had mine with white rice and salad. 

The teriyaki was very tasty! I thoroughly enjoyed the meal, even tho I had way too much rice vs teriyaki. The salad was subpar. Nothing to talk about. The drink selection was limited to fountain drinks. For all the hype I've heard about this place, quite frankly I expected a lot more. Very comparable to your fast food Panda Express, or chipotle and honestly, id rather go to those places...

So thanks for screwing up a simple order, looks like I need to stick to my normal location.

Just need to update this. Randy the owner reached out to me and apologized, he also made things right. It's customer service like this that has me coming back. Mistakes happen, it's what the follow up that happens after that really matters.

Fast forward about 9 months and it's been a while since I last had a wonderful teriyaki chicken bowl from Teriyaki Madness....that is, up until tonight. You see, I never realized that I had one around the corner from my new place of residence until just a few weeks ago! I was pumped to go enjoy another brimming bowl of pure bliss and tastiness!

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqgW-2orQQg

Wow! What a letdown!

This TM location actually has a pretty nice sized dining area with a couple of TV's (playing playoff basketball when I came in tonight, btw...nice!). The young lady who took my order was friendly and very cordial. I go to sit down and wait for my to-go order, while catching some NBA playoff hoops. Less than 5 minutes later, my food is ready! Sweet!! I am LOVING this place!

OK, um....where is the rest of it?? This is easily the skimpiest portion I have ever received at a TM. For almost $8 for a chicken bowl, can I please get some more rice, at least??? What was there tasted great, especially the meat...but I was definitely shortchanged in the portion department tonight!

I honestly wish I could say I'll give them another shot, but you have sooo many great options in the area to choose from...why roll the dice with a place that has no problem shorting their customers??

Disappointing.

I've definitely experienced MUCH better ....even at other Teriyaki Madness locations.

Seriously, when I got here it was a straight up sausage party, probably because it's all about the meaty portions and the giant flat screens that are only playing ESPN one and two. 

I ordered the spicy chicken plate with brown rice, a chicken egg roll, and a house salad. The portions here are massive, I mean when you definitely get what you paid for, but it is a chain restaurant so small prices and big portions are the name of the game. 

The chicken was very good and seasoned well with just a hint of spice. It could have been spiced a little more, but I like a da spicy! I only had a few bites of rice, but it was cooked well and the salad was your basic side salad with house dressing, a nice break from the mountains of meat placed in front of me. 

The chicken egg roll was a tad overcooked, but I actually enjoy the crunch and slight bitter taste of a slightly burnt egg roll.  

It's a chain restaurant yes, this I know, but sometimes you just want to eat and dash with no frills.",i_DR3vdE73nVm2GlMbGpGA,13,13,4,cPrd1sWw_NtgmtkB22tp2A

3075433,2015-10-30,0,CVnfj-UBgOSEvcdt4eWUeA,"We visited this location for lunch, keep in mind most places of employment only allow one hour for lunch. As we entered this teriyaki madness location we were greeted by the owner Randy, Randy took our order, and assured us it would be just a few minutes, I ordered a spicy chicken bowl with noodles only, which would mean no vegetables. Randy asked if I wanted vegetables I simply said no thank you. We waited patiently for our meal, however, when they brought our meals to us, my girlfriends order was correct, however my lunch was spicy chicken teriyaki bowl with noodles and vegetables. I simply explained to the girl, that was incorrect all I wanted was a spicy teriyaki chicken bowl with noodles only. She grabbed  the bowl off the table never said a word and walk back into the kitchen. We waited for anywhere between 6 to 8 minutes later, and I still had no lunch insight. So I approach the counter once again, and asked Randy for the telephone number to the store because I would like to speak to the manager, at this point I wasn't sure if they were making a new lunch or what? Randy said to me, well what is it that you need with the store manager because I'm the owner? I answered I just want my lunch, he said what what's wrong with your lunch, I replied I ordered a spicy teriyaki chicken bowl with noodles only, he said no you didn't, you ordered vegetables. I said no sir i ordered noodles only no vegetables no meaning none. He turned around and looked at the kitchen and said well didn't they make you a new one they should be making you a new one it's coming right up what is the problem? And I said the problem is by now my girlfriend is halfway done with her lunch by the time I received my lunch it'll be time to go back to work and I won't even get to eat lunch. and he said to me, well it a only be a minute, it should have only taking a minute to make you a new one so what is the problem? I didn't feel like arguing with this guy that it is now been an additional 10 minutes plus since I've been waiting for them to remake a new lunch, keep in mind I've now been waiting 20 plus minutes just for my order. It seemed like Randy could care less about anybody else's time and it was almost a privilege to step through the front door of his restaurant, he was very disrespectful with his attitude and his tone along with his comments. as my order finally came to the window he handed it to me and with this smart tome to his voice said, see. Now have a nice day. As I walked away from the counter I look back to see Randy motioning in my direction laughing with the next customer in line as if it was a giant joke and rolling his eyes at me. I don't think making a joke or talking about a customer behind their back and being disrespectful towards them is very funny. As I left the restaurant it angered me once again because I was not able to eat my entire lunch due to time restraints. I felt somebody else above him should know about his actions his comments, and his disrespect and his attitude towards customers, so I approach the counter one last time, and please keep in mind I just did not want any more conflict with this guy I tried to take the upper road one last time. So I asked the girl behind the counter to make sure his name was Randy, he interrupts the customer that is standing in front of him to look at me and say look buddy what did you want me to do give you a free bowl or something?! I replied to him, No, actually a little less attitude a little respect and a simple apology would have gone a long way. And he said well the girl told me you acted as if you are mad at her, I replied no I simply told her it was the wrong order and I would like the correct order that's all. Keep in mind this is all taking place while he is in the middle of taking an order he actually took the time away from another customer to engage myself?? Then with another smart aleck tone and with the flick of his hand as if to say,get out of my store he says well I apologize! And then asks how's that? And I said, had it been genuine I would probably accept it. He says to me oh well have a nice day! Treating customers like this and acting like Captain Jack Ass, is completely ridiculous. He will treat enough customers like this and eventually he won't be able to make his payment to the teriyaki madness franchise. So I warn you, this guy Randy, number one, definitely feels like it is a privilege for you to walk through the door, number two, your time is definitely not important, it's his time and his time only that means anything. Number 3, if you feel like being disrespected and treated like a moron and being spoke to with an attitude, go there and see Randy.",vAgcsRsaymbjzHXc_n8Rqg,1,0,1,43er_dMWkw1UjGQB9agxKQ

The girl taking our order was more interested in that conversation than our order.  My boyfriend ordered a chicken bowl for himself and an orange chicken for me.  We asked is they had water cups and she said yes and gave us one cup for 1 people.  I guess you have to be very literal at this place.  We got our order with in 5 mins.

Mistakes happen we understand.  We both work in the service industry.  But no apology? And the attitude we get is not appreciated. Some advice to the manager of this store.

I still call my order in 10-15 minutes before arriving and take my food to go, and it's actually ready when I arrive! Employees seem to be taking their responsibilities more seriously while remaining friendly and welcoming.

Outdoor seating. If they had  more different types of veggie selections/preparations and perhaps some toppers like peanuts or sesame seeds, that would make it a strong 5 star for me. Price, though, can't be beat.

Enough to fill you up. Teriyaki sauce too sweet for this sourpuss, so I will order the other sauces to try.

I opted for chicken katsu, because I haven't had it in so long. The breading definitely wasn't panko, and it was overcooked, so the chicken was a dry and lacking much flavor. The katsu sauce just tasted off. Sort of tasted like mild BBQ sauce with a dash of cinnamon - very strange. The rice and veggies had very little flavor also. What made it all taste good were the few slivers of onion in the veggies and the little bit of teriyaki sauce I also received.

When you walk inside it has a pretty big dinning room to eat and there usually isn't any problem finding a table whenever I come here. 

Menu is painless to read. First you choose the type of protein(s) such as chicken or beef. Next is the base such as rice, veggies or noodles. And last, a side such as veggies or a salad. If you brought the little kids, they also offer a special menu for them. 

They also offer side items such as eggrolls, pot stickers, crab rangoons, shrimp tempura and/or edamame. All the items are reasonable price and my favorite are the pot stickers and crab rangoons. 

I usually order the beef teriyaki, brown rice and the mac salad. I top it off with their teriyaki sauce and siracha. I mix my food around so I could get an evenly blend of my food to eat.

My boyfriend and I came here to eat for our lunch break. It was definitely a good choice! 

The cashiers were nice and the food got out in about 7-10 minutes. The bowls come with stir fried veggies. I ordered a beef bowl and a chicken teriyaki bowl. 

The beef teriyaki bowl was pretty good! The veggies were cooked perfectly and I could tell that they were fresh. The beef tasted more like bulgogi though.

The chicken teriyaki was amazing! It's definitely worth every penny. The chicken was juicy and the sauce just tasted perfect!

I must admit, I was surprised!  It just expected another panda express kind of place (which I like) but it was much better. 

Another upside was that the place was spotless so I feel a bit better about eating there. 

The only downside was that the plates were $1-$2 just so that you could choose the side instead of getting rice? I didn't really understand that part. Maybe there's more meat too? I'll try it out next time.
