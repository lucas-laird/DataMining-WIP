20799,2011-03-15,0,C74ViML3zx1akYVafLaiXQ,"Asian buffet, slightly above average in all aspects.

Buffet At Asia is an Asian buffet restaurant, priced cheaper than most casino buffets (around $16 for dinner) though there are Asian buffets that are cheaper still.

There is decent variety of foods and there is also a Mongolian grill (or bbq) where you can select the ingredients you want and they're cooked live in front of you.

I won't comment on the seafood as I don't eat any but there were crab legs and sushi options. 
For meat lovers there was pork, chicken and beef, around 3 choices for each. All were decent tasting though they were a bit oil/fat-heavy. All of them tasted average, not bad but also not special, about the same you'd expect from any takeout.

I really enjoyed the sweet sesame balls (essentially dough balls covered in sesame and deep fried) though they were kind of heavy on the stomach.

There's also a large variety of vegetables, steamed or fried and I also saw frog legs! (for those who consider it a delicacy, I don't)

The desserts station had a large variety of fruit (quite refreshing from the usual buffet ""cheesecake and carrotcake"" staples) as well as soft serve ice cream, donuts (not the usual style but a deep fried style I didn't really enjoy, too oily and crispy with a sour/stale taste) and cakes.

Something that I found odd (even mildly annoying) was that there weren't descriptions/names in all of the foods, and those that had any description it was just written with a permanent marker on the glass above. It would cost nothing to print some nice readable labels and it would really change the image of the buffet and inform customers what every food is.

Service was fast (the place was not crowded at all when I visited) but one of the servers was.. weird (in a good way). She didn't speak much, she would just stand in front of you looking down instead of asking if you wanted a refill. Now that led to somewhat eerie moments of silence while attempting to establish communication (having someone stand silently in front of you and you saying ""coke please"" just seemed weird and rude). I assume she was just shy and maybe new at the job and I'm not going to mark them down for that.

There's also a sign on the wall that says there's an extra charge for wasted food. While this is understandable in a manner that someone who fills their plate with one type of food and doesn't eat it will cause the restaurant to throw it away, it may also put off people from trying new things thinking that if they don't like something or can't eat it they'll have to pay extra. I haven't encountered such a situation and hopefully the restaurant will be prudent but still the sign on the wall exudes a passive threat.

Overall, Buffet At Asia manages to be slightly above average in everything: price, food selection, taste (some foods tend to be heavy/oily), service. Hence 3/5",S-dfqUtbu7JybeU6mOTWmQ,2,2,3,c-oteVDvY3cOxDRN3Vq1DA

Highlights:

1) Large population of Asian people eating at Buffet At Asia - always a good sign.

2) Healthy-ish options like Mongolian BBQ, Snow crab legs, fruit, salad, surprisingly good sushi, steamed prawns and more.

3) Tasty hot and sour soup (not always the case at Chinese restaurants, let alone all you can eat bbqs)

Lowlights:

1) Questionably clean dishes. They were mostly clean with a few notable aberrations.

2) Limited, gelatinous dessert selection (though I didn't see the ice cream until it was too late).

Overall, I am impressed that I liked the food, I don't feel sick after eating there, and it was only $15. I'll return.",SvDBPy8VQoe7gdzR-RAcjg,2,0,4,eO_k8ahidjw6GDJgBF6oLg

Service: Typical from a buffet. Nothing special, but nothing to complain about either.

Food: So they have the Sirloin Steak and Lamb Chops that you can order. We waited for 30 mins to finally get them, and they were super thin, and super overcooked, nothing like the pictures. lol, they never are. 
The buffet itself is pretty decent.  A good variety.  Loved the crab legs.  Loved the shrimp.  Loved the barbecued fish.
An okay mongolian barbecue grill, but you're not allowed to put in the sauce yourself, they mix it for you.  

Bottom Line:
Buffet food is pretty good.  Don't recommend the side Sirloin Steak or the Lamb Chop.  Wished they allowed you to mix your own sauce.  Other than that not a bad deal.",KMH0-vcV0atzuNN0LABsRQ,0,0,3,GQ9nB9qii5M0VTAdII3wBw

They charged $12 per person for a weekday lunch, which l later realized was way higher than the regular price they charge walk ins. While most people in my tourist group don't speak English and were foreign tourists, I am not and I for sure didn't want to be treated like an idiot who just paid his bill without asking. No price posted anywhere and front desk even lied to me that $12 is the regular price they charge other customers. I figured out myself later that they included generous tips in this $12 price. As a matter of fact, I did not get any service during my stay and I had to get my own drinks, so why I had to pay tips for missing service? In addition, what made this price fishy is the guy who collected payment at the front desk told me that I have to pay cash or I have to pay additional for tips? Why??? Is it due to the fact that you are trying to report business loss to IRS and ""smartly"" avoid paying tax on this? If there is a way, I would write a letter to IRS and report their suspicious conduct. Needless to say, the food looked and tasted like trash, unwashed and deep fried in dirty oil or mixed with all kinds of MSG. If you are looking for a value meal, don't come here!

372266,2011-03-21,2,C74ViML3zx1akYVafLaiXQ,"Ate at the location on Eastern & Flamingo yesterday (Sunday). I eat at many asian buffets, so I know what to expect.

Here's my honest take:

Pros: 
-Decent selection of food

-Server was friendly and attentive

-Gyoza dumplings, Wonton soup, Jalapeno chicken was really good, pretty decent quality fruit - seemed fresh.

Cons:
-Sign claims to have ""Thai, japanese, chinese, american etc"" all different types of cuisine - the only Thai dish they had was Pad Thai, and it was of really poor quality. The sushi was kinda gross, too. They only really had chinese, and some cheap pizza for the kids.
 
-Restaurant in general has a ""dirty"" feel to it. I was afraid to touch anything. I ate finger foods with my fork to avoid getting sick. It was really busy, but it didn't seem like they were keeping up with the crowds very well as far as cleanliness goes.

-Bathrooms were filthy, totally trashed. I saw an employee go in to clean, but she wasn't wiping up the mess, just spraying disinfectant randomly and emptying trash.

-The grossest thing about this location were the customers - REALLY filthy people. Waiting in line to get in, a man in front of us had *KILLER* B.O. - the kind legends are made of. It smelled like he hadn't washed his ass for a month! It kinda sucked to have to experience that right before eating. The people sitting near us seemed dirty and trashy too. I know the proprietors of the restaurant can't control this, but it ruined the experience for me.

-It was really busy, and I was nearly run over by servers, kids and fat people every 5 minutes. It was difficult to walk around with a plate of food in your hands.",og_e48wy0wIb44i_FF0gaQ,1,0,2,WIRZYCJskLyavgi7-1RfVg

Choices are limited consider we came with a tour bus n this is the only restaurant that open @ 9:30 (ya, i'm aware it's official hours state 11:00).

Food: I believe most foods are left over from night before, since they come out from the kitchen with 1/3 of the regular serving.

Most dishes are either too salty or too much sauces that I can't even taste the food itself. (The place I used to work does it a lot to cover up ......... ya...)

Clams are not clean probably as there's still sand in it. 

Service: unless u carry a bill in ur hand ready to tip, otherwise, expect to do it yourself. * after all, it's only buffet... what's there to serve other than greeting & taking away the plates*


Conclusion: 
Even with the $2 off, I would still choose macdonald & in-n-out over this. Not only because of the food quality but also the service. 
 
Really surprise this place existing to such long time without anyone reporting it.

For some reason my aunt loves this place and it gets worse every time we visit this place. They have added more chairs which make it nearly impossible walking around with your plate with out the waiters bumping into you. Cleanness is far from it. Serving spoons are not clean and used for more than one dish. Floors seem to be not mopped in days. Be careful of the ceiling fan they don't clean it and dust is clearly on it. 

Now the food. It's not bad. I mean it's the kind of food that you can tolerate to eat. But when you are done eating you feel disgusting. Disgusted that you at at this place. 

One thing about this place that I commend is the waiters though. They are poorly understaffed and they work really hard. In fact I didn't see one of them stand around.",YXdAl_E8F0WSqbPG_cnMyA,1,0,1,KWF1DiVSXa8I3HQZMxOEXA

882862,2014-08-30,0,C74ViML3zx1akYVafLaiXQ,"We decided to check out this Buffet at Asia in Henderson, NV when we first visited to Nevada . DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY OR TIME HERE. Upon entering this place not much of the staff spoke english, but they know how to count your money perfectly. There isn't much to write about the decor it's more like junior high cafeteria style wooden tables and small hard uncomfortable wooden chairs. There's a mediocre sushi bar near the front entrance.

The asian style ribs were so over cooked we couldn't eat them. We asked the waitress not to bring our drinks until we had gotten our food. I think the walls pay more attention to what you say then these people. Upon our return to the table there sat our drinks. Of course I requested she make all fresh drinks and watched her pour fresh drinks as well. I am very skeptical about unattended drinks and foods myself. Of course she wasn't very happy with my request and watching her back either. If you love seafood as I do such as fresh unlimited king crabs legs, fried blue claw crabs and fish etc. Now as of 2013 to present. Go to the Buffet @ Asia on Flamingo and Eastern Ave, Las Vegas. My nail technician recommended that place and we love it. 

The service is very friendly and the foods are always fresh and hot. There's a very high turn over during dinner hours from 4 pm to 9 pm. The lunch doesn't offer the same menu as the dinner does no king crab legs, fried frog legs, fried crab or pepper shrimp. The price for dinner is $13.95 you leave a tip after you dine. Alcohol drinks are extra but there's unlimited teas and water and Chi tea too. The dessert doesn't offer real ice cream it's just a frozen like iced milk. But they do have a selection of asian desserts cakes and cookies etc. The ribs are tasty but over cooked and dry. The veggies and rice are very good. King crab legs are a good size and plenty of them. But you must watch when they put them out because people grab them two plates full at a time. The atomosphere is relaxed and family friendly. They also have a huge wok station where you can choose your own ingredients too.

By far this is the best one of many of the Bufet @ asia to eat in Vegas. Be sure to dine no later than 8:30 pm because they will begin to clean the buffet to close for the night.",OjxsJwvJY2ArIQlDLQmIwA,1,0,1,TImacvp1XS9FN9pluRm6hA

Sure the place seems a tad run down at first glance, but this is not the case with the food. The selection is enormous, and omg it made me so happy! Everything I tried was absolutely delicious, with only one exception. Just skip the ribs. If you see ribs and think ""Mmmmm.... Ribs."" Just keep walking. They almost made me choke, and then almost made me puke.
This place, although in kind of a weird part of town, is an excellent choice if you love Asian food. It is NOT fancy! But it is awesome :)

Prices are still low but food quality has seriously declined.  It's strictly Chinese food now.  What throws it off is that there's a little side bar with banchan sides.  But what good is banchan if you can't pair it with Korean barbecue?

Dessert items are par for the course.  The sushi is ok, lots of fried rolls drenched with sweet sauces, and a few traditional varieties.

Customized fresh wok vegetables, meat and noodle smells great, but it tasted bland. 
Fried snacks are tasteless and soggy. Fried cheese wrap is disgusting. There is no taste, no flavor and the cheese filling is dry.
The rest dishes on the counter is over salted. Everything taste the same, it was all cooked with soy sauce. 
Steamed bun/steam cake is edible. 
Desserts cake is classic and it's okay.
Green jelly is gross. It was sour and bitter, I have no idea what that is and what that suppose to be. 
Totally inedible. 

This place is even worse than Panda express. 
If I had the choice on that day? I will never walk into that place.",IF_G8EqbNODvD8RjTsvo8A,7,1,1,m9Wm70Eaof5sAny0Yxa0Iw

1.food selections: Excellent 
Not only Chinese dishes are served in this restaurant but they also offer Thai,Japanese,Korean as well as  Mongolian BBQ,seafood,salad bar,fruit and ice-cream.

2.Taste of food: Good

3.Service: excellent service 
The staffs are attentive and move in a fast pace.They remove plates  very quick unlike other buffet that let your plates stack up.

4.Cleanliness: Good
The staffs clean the floor regularly.

5.Price: Excellent
It is quite cheap and you get a bit more than you pay.Less than $10 dollars for lunch and $less than$21 dollars for AYCE seafood dinner.can't beat that.


Good for big party,family as well as

Best days are to go on Fridays and Saturday ~ seafood night.  Come early; otherwise, there may be a wait and the food may not be as fresh as late in the night.

Usually, I focused on the crab legs and the oysters.  When it is oysters season, this places rocks!  It has the freshest oysters that we have ever had in Vegas.  By the way, we ate at the Southpointe casino the other day and their oysters like yuck....

As for the crab legs, large and juicy.  Yummy!

Atmosphere -- it is a buffet folks
Service -- seems alot of young chinese people ~ probably students.  They do work hard.  
Price -- it is about $20.. much better and more affordable than the strip at $35-40 bucks per head... 

I love this place.  If I could eat here everyday, it would be awesome... My cholesterol and weight would go through the roof.  

Definitely, one of the best in Vegas.",qy47UXcmGYsPhDSc6iHWPA,1,1,5,lDz1ovKibl4aOYHuMKZ_2A

I was a little taken aback today when we were charged $8.99 apiece (plus tax), but to be honest, it was worth every penny. Everything was not only fresh and beautiful, but each and every item had a sticker above it with the time that it had been brought out! Wow! Impressive!

The sushi was beautiful, there were plenty of delicious choices, and there was an abundance of ginger and wasabi. The fresh fruit was just that - fresh, and many choices. I personally LOVE the mongolian grill, and this one is my favorite because they used paper thin slices of meat-chicken, pork and beef, and all of the sides I love: water chestnuts, sprouts, cabbage, broccoli, garlic, baby corn, celery, etc. Mmmm, super good. 

I'm just very impressed. The place was clean, the food not only looked good, but was delicious. Sometimes at a chinese buffet, I take little bits, because I either don't know what it is, or I want to try it to see if it tastes good. Not necessary here. Everything I took was delicious! Oh, and the service was also very attentive. 

In reference to Meg H. on Aug 16, we had iced tea, and the girl refilled it every few minutes, however, if you order thai tea, there is an extra charge for that.

My mother, who eats like a bird, had just had outpatient surgery and we went straight to eat afterwards. She ate like a logger! I don't think I've ever seen her eat so much! Go mom!

My husband and I wanted Chinese food, saw this place and decided to try it. We were seated and then went up to the buffet and retrieved our plates. I noticed something felt greasy under my plate and turned it over. It was filthy, absolutely no exaggeration. I grabbed my husband and had him flip his plate over, again the same filth. I took the plates back to the pile we got them from and set them aside. Picked up another couple plates and turned them over, disgusting! I set those aside and started going through the pile. Every plate i picked up was greasy and had food residue on it.

At this time, I decided to talk to the people at the front counter. I showed them the plates and told them the whole stack was dirty. They told us to try another stack of plates so we did. The very same grease and crud was on those plates. In the meantime, the woman took the plates into what I assume was the kitchen. She emerged telling us it was taken care of. I told her I couldn't find any clean plates so she disappeared into the kitchen again. Out she comes with a stack of styrofoam plates, seriously. She put them by a stack of dishes and I grabbed a couple. 

We put a varied assortment of food on our styrofoam plates and headed back to our table. I started to eat only to find the food lukewarm. Got up, went and grabbed another plate and dished up some other items of food and returned to my seat. Oh swell the same lukewarm temperature.

In the meantime, I see a guy from the kitchen come out with stacks of plates on a cart. He stops at the first stack of plates and piles the fresh plates onto the dirty ones. Goes to another stack and does the same thing. Out of curiosity I go and get a fresh plate off the first pile he stacked. The plate was filthy! Picked up a few more and the same thing, grease and food residue. So, I decided to check the warmth of the food in all the tables by hovering my hand over the food to see if I could feel any heat. Barely felt anything. This was not near closing, this was at dinner time. I wanted to scream at the other people eating there to check the underside of their plates and ask if they noticed that their food was not hot as required by law, but I didn't.

So, the next time you go there, check every plate you use and don't eat food that is lukewarm as it could make you very sick or kill you!

By the way, Chinese are notoriously cheap. That would explain the dirty dishes, not using sufficiently hot water and changing the water in the rinse tank. As for the warmth of the food, it costs money to raise the temperature in the steam tables as it consumes more gas and that costs money.

For 17 dollars,  I had sushi, sashimi, frozen yogurt, lobster, Chinese food, Asian soups, and a nice selection of cakes and cookies.  The quality of the food was really good.  I did not find any items that were bad. Everything was either good or OK.  The buffet tables were well maintained. If something ran out, they would replace it very fast.  I think this place is better than any buffet place I have been to in San Francisco.  I am impressed by this place. I would not mind going to this place again.

We were there last week and we can't believe we've been eating there as long as we have.  The place was absolutely filthy, don't even go in the men's room!  The ladies room isn't quite as bad.  The place is run down and looks like a soup kitchen.  There are beggars out front peddling garbage or begging for money.  Passing over most of the food which just looked like slop I settled on cold shrimp by the ""salad"" portion of the counters.  I was going to have a salad but the lettuce was wilted and didn't look good.  The sushi looked okay so I chose a CA roll then a bowl of wonton soup which was quite tasty.  I had a couple bites from my son's plate and wasn't impressed.  My brother ended up in the men's room tossing his cookies after taking a couple bites of something he had grilled.  I didn't personally see any CR's but I'm sure they are around.  The employees seemed like zombies.  It was just ""all about collecting your money"" to them.  We couldn't get refills or dirty plates cleared.  I tried to ask one employee a question about the ice cream machine and they looked past me and kept on going.  Tried to get a small cone and stood there for 3 minutes for one inch stream.  I think it was empty and nobody cared.  I tasted the chocolate that seemed to be coming out ok but OMG it was horrible.  If that was chocolate, I'm never eating it again.  Price at lunch is almost $10.00 and for dinner (after 3:30 pm) it is about $13.99.  Way over priced for such a dump with nasty food.

2324724,2006-12-28,0,C74ViML3zx1akYVafLaiXQ,"Popular buffet in the burbs focusing on various asian cuisines, including, Japanese, Thai, Korean and Chinese. The quality of the food is just OK, as you'd for these lower end buffets. This is certainly no Todai. The overall quality is influenced greatly by how long the food has been sitting under the heat lamps. The first plate of Pad Thai was pretty good, while a later plate was pretty lackluster.

While my dad loves the Korean beef that is cooked by a chef, I like the  garlic string beans best. There at least a half dozen different chicken dishes, in all different styles. I didn't care for the lemon chicken, while the others were decent.  My mom said the fish balls weren't too good. The sushi are unremarkable.

They have yellow watermelon which is good. I like the almond jello too. I'd avoid the perennial chocolate fountain.

Service is average. Sunset station is much better at picking up the finished plates promptly. Here they are about average.

$6.99 lunch includes hot tea, but not sodas. Good value. Get there early as there's a wait once you hit 12:30 or so.",ImVfDOri1NG5UE5MEmqHJg,0,0,2,DVjHQ8w4DiwIrhFpTGwV_Q

Well look no further than Buffet @ Asia. Who can drop that much money Bacchanal Buffet anyways? For as little as $15 (that said I didn't get too good of a look at the prices if you know what I mean), you can gorge yourself alongside others determined to commit gluttony. Score yourself a 15% coupon and you even get to save some more! Maybe that $30 that you saved can lead to a jackpot! Just be aware, this is a Chinese buffet, as in don't expect the best.

Like most Chinese buffets at dinner time, the place was loaded with seafood. Most importantly, they had dim sum style lobster! For $15, you're getting all you can eat lobster. Am I dreaming and living the buffet life or what? Throw in salmon sashimi, crab legs, frog legs, and dynamite and it's a home run! Unfortunately, I must admit that the food is obviously not of the best quality. The clams were sandy and had a weird, somewhat metallic taste. The oysters weren't very fresh and weren't cleaned properly. The nigiri had obviously been sitting out for a long time and should have been disposed of. At the beginning of service, the salmon sashimi was very very good. Then, it became horrible cuts and believe it or not, I found a piece of bone in a piece. Yuck! The shrimp dynamite was deliciously cheesy and creamy but none of the shrimp were deveined. I don't know about anything else I found that the taste of the food in general was strong; it's heavily seasoned. 

Now, onto service. Holy moly! My table literally never had an empty plate at any time. There were times they carted my plate away while I still had food on it that I was getting to! And yes, most of the time, the item about to be taken away were lobsters and crab legs. My water was constantly being filled to the very blink. They were probably hoping that I'd get full off the water. 

Overall, for $15, this place is a steal. It's a bit messy but this is a Chinese buffet boy! You do't come here for world class service; you come here for food at dirt cheap prices.",9ZBh5eG74UaDA3uUezZhTQ,0,0,3,jpVEsicQluUGLvxRyDyFLg

My boyfriend and I decided to try it out since we haven't been in many many years...Well, what a horrible mistake!! As soon as we entered the so called restaurant that smells like wet dog the lady at the front was immediately distasteful and pushy. Once seated, we waited awhile for someone to greet us and take our drink order so we could get food. Finally some guy casually walks out from the kitchen and greets us! 
We get up and start with the Sushi Bar...Just by looking at it you could already taste the stale, dried out rolls! There was sticky notes that said ""For Dinner Only"" on some roles! Assuming they were left out since lunch time! Gross AF! 

We both got a couple that looked decent and kept going down the line thinking it would get better... Salad bar next.... WHAT salad bar?!?! There were two shrubs of lettuce and that was it. I didn't even bother.... Soups looked nasty and probably hadn't been changed since December of last year! 
 I don't know how anyone could consume this food!


We finally sit down and pick at the few things on our plates... my boyfriends eyes grew huge when chewing on the orange chicken, he said  tasted like rubber! We both tried a sushi roll and nearly spit it out, edamame was frozen, noodles were stale, long story short everything was garbage!! ( After we left we felt sick to our stomachs with the little amount we ate )

We have never been the kind of rude people to make a scene and walk out...So we politely told our waiter we were going to leave and my boyfriend was generous enough to pay for one meal! They were so rude when we were leaving and obviously talking shit in Chinese! They didn't deserve any money !

2505713,2012-10-17,8,C74ViML3zx1akYVafLaiXQ,"During numerous trips to Vegas, I've frequented the Buffet at Asia on Rainbow Blvd. (My review of that place here: (http://www.yelp.com/biz/buffet-at-asia-las-vegas-4#hrid:mSPf88mhq76t49Qo-3jtlw). In the sea of Vegas buffets, Buffet at Asia is one of the best ones in my opinion for Asian food. On my latest Vegas trip however, I got to try for the first time to the Buffet at Asia in the Henderson area.

The setup of this Buffet at Asia is a little bit different from the one on the westside. This one has one long row of food items that starts with a Mongolian wok type cookery. Next up is their sushi items and then this is followed by the soups: wonton, miso and seafood soup. Up next is the traditional Asian buffet food: they have good offerings like egg rolls, egg foo young, orange chicken, chicken skewers, dumplings and veggie tempura. Off to the side is their desserts: some items are orange jello, almond jello, chocolate mousse, frozen yogurt and sesame balls. I like how above the food items are big, bright lights and letters showing the name of the different areas. So very Vegas picturesque ;)

They do offer some food that the Buffet at Asia on Rainbow doesn't have. It was the first time I saw these chicken with cheese wontons that I really liked. I did think however that the selection over at the Buffet at Asia on Rainbow is larger. This branch at Henderson had good food offerings but not as many as the westside location. Nevertheless, the food here is a good and if in you are in Henderson, it's a good place to go to. It's less than $10 and includes a drink!",H4BiIX0gU-Fc2S487g7z1Q,10,9,4,v81TmTWrCxPW28u1MLQMcw

The food:

Let's start off with the best thing there: honeydew. I should have just ate honeydew the whole time because everything else sucked. Don't even bother getting their sushi....it's just California roll with sauce on top or presented differently. Their seafood soup or whatever tasted very fishy. The pineapples looked like they had been sitting out for too long. Idk the food was just a huge mess. I felt like I only ate their veggie tempura, baked sweet potato and honey dew the whole time because everything else sucked. And as for the veggie tempura, it wasn't even good, but it was one of the better food options. Thank god they didn't fail on baking the sweet potato or else idk how and why they are still open. 

The service:


We asked for napkins like literally 5 times and the waitresses had attitude. We also asked for hot tea and they put the hot tea in a plastic cup. Wait hold up? Have these waitresses not gone thru some type of food handlers training? Even if they didn't, do they not have common sense? Because you know it's common sense to not put hot drinks in plastic cups. Omg. They need to throw these waitresses back into kindergarten cus clearly they hired dumbasses. They also don't know how to own a business because the customer should always be right.

The price for dinner is about 1/3 that of a Strip buffet's price with a plethora of options to choose from for food and dessert.  Along with your freshly cooked typical Chinese fare, other options include a variety of soups, a sushi bar, a Mongolian BBQ/noodle station, and American classics (pizza for instance).  

What makes this establishment even more worthwhile is their crab claws.  Now if you're a fan of the buttery crustaceans then definitely go here one time!   The last time I had dinner here, the claws were replaced frequently and the size of the claws rival those of their Strip buffet counterparts.  An unlimited amount of crab legs is probably bad for the heart but good for the soul.  :)

This location hosts a private room for private parties if needed and the space is pretty clean and well-maintained overall.  However, the bathrooms could definitely use a make-over.   

When you're trying to stuff yourself and your family without breaking the bank, consider a trip to this buffet.  Your appetite will thank you for it.

Lunch for us was 11 dollars per person which covered drinks+tip

Typical asian buffet with eggrolls, dumplings, orange chicken, etc. They have a good selection of foods, with a sushi section(a bit bland) and a made to order Mongolian BBQ section that's covered in your buffet. I didn't notice til the end. However,  desert is lacking with few fruits and ice cream. The food was decent tasting compared to other asian buffets I've been to and the fact that I haven't had stomach problems the whole day means it's on par with ingredidents! 

Service there was very sullen, as if workers really disliked being there. Basically, overall gloomy ambiance from them. However, did enjoy the neon signs over the food sections, very Vegas-esque. :]

The Asian selection is nice, there's the sushi bar, fruits/desserts, soups, appetizers, noodles/rice, meats, and veggies. Of course the food tastes best when its fresh and hot, so you just have to time it right when they re-fill the section. 

The place usually has a good amount of people, but we never have to wait for seating. The staff is attentive, they always know when we are done eating, and bring us fortune cookies.",XQlK4Cnr-matKoM2rROocw,0,1,4,QAZf0NfOSV_R0MRNJuwSkg

So tour buses apparently love stopping here. I get that. It's cheap, it's chinese. But there were 4 different tour buses that stopped here the day that we went. And for some odd reason, this place just was not ready. The tour we were on had been doing this same trip once a week for some time as well and had stopped here previously. So it's not like they didn't know a whole bunch of people were about to come in.

And yet, they still weren't ready. We paid our dues and were given a paper w/ a receipt, and someone took us to a table. Since they did not have enough tables for everyone, some families were combined. In the table we were at, with seating for 4, with 5 people sitting in it, there was a box on one of the seats, so only 3 people could actually ""sit"" at that table. After saying good bye to the box, we went to get the food.

Except there wasn't any. I think after my first go, I got a few noodles, some broccoli beef, some veggies, 2 pieces of sushi, and that was about it. I think everything else was just empty. 

They also have fruit and apple pie that's not too sweet.

The mushroom with cheese in the middle was one of the better choices that they had, but it took me 3 walkthroughs to get there. It took them til almost the end (45 mins after we had arrived) to fill the sushi section. They had two sections, one of which was completely empty for the longest time. Smh. They have some soups which I didn't try and the rest are chinese foods :P

Plates are either plates that have some dirty stuff on it or plastic plates. utensils are also all plastic. Soda is DIY in the fountain in the back. And it's also kinda dirty :/

If I had gotten a chance to eaten some of the food, maybe a 2 star review? But since I had a very limited meal of almost nothing, I can only rate it on what I had.

We were then escorted to our table. Our waitress took our drink order, I asked for juice for the little boys and her reply was "" we dont have no juice"". When I asked what drinks they had the waitress said she would just bring them Orange soda. (Whatever, at this point we all just wanted to eat) Overall it was just a mediocre experience. OH I ALMOST FORGOT!!..... When the waitress brought us a refill on our drinks she brought them back in the same glasses that she put her fingers in while carrying them back to get refilled! GROSS!!! The glasses were greasy too! When we asked for new glasses she rolled her eyes and told one of the bussers to get us new drinks..

For this review I will be writing about Buffet @ Asia...  I bet you were wondering why I would come here when I'm in Vegas?

1)  I'm the buffet king remember?  It's my duty to check out the land of the buffets and give them a piece of my mind!

2)  We were no where near the strip

3)  They said that they offered Lobsters!!  (For dinner only!)

4)  It's only $8.99 for Lunch!!!  (This price for a buffet in Vegas is awesome!)

So.....  What's good here!

Food!  Many of the hot items were tasty... Sushi wasn't so exciting, but they do have oxtail soup that was super delicious!  Light tasty broth accompanied by meaty oxtails!  Oh boy oh boy!!!

Prices!  Well... if you don't feel like spending $20+ for a strip buffet, here is a delicious alternate!

As for the lobsters.. I missed out... came here for lunch so didn't get a chance to eat lobsters...

So what are the downsides to this place?

- Sort of hard to find... tucked inside a business plaza but hidden away from everything and placed in the corner...
- Parking is semi limited.... only about 10-15 spaces out front... otherwise you have to walk...
- Decor is very run-down... some torn chairs are very visible.... doesn't put out a good vibe because it seems though that they don't really care about looking pretty for the customers...


Would I go here?  Yes.... for the food, price it's a total yes... but definitely not for the drive or the decor as they both are disappointing...  (the drive would be real far for those staying on the strip...)

The waitress asked for our drink order and as we were giving it to her she was walked away saying, ""ok,ok thank you"".. all the tags on the line are incorrect and tons of cross contamination, not to mention they have raw oysters that are just sitting there and are at room temperature which is very dangerous!! They have store bought almond cookies and the salad bar has a big huge green light that says salads but all they have is cut romaine and that's it..  all the dipping sauces has a film on the meaning they are old and have been sitting there..

They have many different varieties to choose from and they are all in their own section. The place was nice, clean, and their food signs really catch your attention. If you're a person who is really hungry and is craving many different kinds of food then I would definitely suggest  this place for you. You can even bring your family if you wish as their buffet prices are very reasonable.

I have eaten at Chinese buffets all over the country and I find this one subpar even with the price acceptance. The hygiene standards are very off-putting. The dining room floor is obviously not cleaned on a daily basis and I'm curious if it's even cleaned on a weekly basis. The bathroom are disgusting. Even the door leading into the bathroom is covered in Grime. It looks like a door that I would see at an employee restroom at a garage or tire shop that is not used by the public. Inside the bathroom reeks of urine and has obviously not been fully cleaned in a very long time. It is a shame, because the bathroom itself would not take very much to get it up to standards. I found the food selection unusually Limited 4 a buffet. The one redeeming quality I found personally was the soups  I thought will well done. I will concede that soup is one of the hardest Foods to mess up. My experience with the wait staff was Pleasant, as they were friendly and kept my beverages topped off. Overall I was disappointed and in the end a little worried.  I have nothing against greasy spoons, but the hygiene standards I witnessed leave me wondering if I will spend this evening in the bathroom.

I took my five kids here Because they claimed to have sushi and sashimi as well as other Asian Delights. Food really was good, not how I expected. I don't really like buffets because the food is usually bland/plain and prepared in huge quantities with no personal touch. However this Asian food was similar to a fast food restaurant. The sashimi bar kept running out of salmon and tuna, and I would ask for them to replenish it. I saw a big piles of Artie prepped fish sitting on the counter, so I was not sure why they were not replenishing that fast. I do understand that seven of us were eating mostly so she me, so I gave an extra star for this. However about an hour before closing, they decided to start cleaning the floors. There was this huge horrible chlorine smell that start making us nauseous as we were trying to eat. Also the bucket water had a specific smell that you only smell when it's not changed often enough. I'm not sure how they figure that it's OK to sanitize the floors with smelly water while customers are sitting in booth next to the cleaner.

The last time we were at this location was probably four or five months ago and things seemed OK. Since then, they've taken a nose dive and they're heading for a crash landing.

I was about to say 13, but stopped and asked if they were free and she said they weren't and were $1.50 each. What buffet does that crap for soft drinks?

The Mongolian grill is gone. They sushi stand was ransacked and looked like I fell into after drinking a 12 pack. They time stamp the sushi and saw some pieces that were there since 3:30 PM and it almost 8 when we were there. Pretty much all of the food was old and dried out with no attempt to replace any of it.

Prices vary depending on age and height (or something like that).  Unfortunately, I didn't pay much attention to the prices because I didn't have to pay.  Har har.

Let's see here ... the food is pretty good I guess.  Nothing extraordinary and nothing that disgusts me.  I'm a vegetarian so there weren't many options for me.  I ate the Chow Mein, Saunteed Mushrooms, Fried String Beans with Garlic.  Furthermore, a couple of chocolate strawberries, fruit, and pastries. All of those were okay.  It didn't blow me away ... at all.

The place looks rather nice outside; I wouldn't say the same for the inside.  It doesn't look too clean.  Actually, I can put up with the look, but it's not exactly attractive.

So to sum things up; it's average. Call it a plain jane place if you want.",m4PsK-X3t1GvAAj0m2vMHA,0,0,2,WBHI0IRxe9VLDaMh3VuYSg

He walked by me and he smelled awful! I asked him where he came from and he said they had dinner at the Buffet @ Asia. I said "" Dude, you stink.... like you've been working in a kitchen all day"".

Ever since that evening, I've never had the desire to dine there. But then a few nights ago when my boyfriend and I were in the area, we decided to give this place a try. We said that if there's a line then we'll move on, but nope, there was no line. It was actually pretty empty inside. 

I only tried a few of their items, one of them being the beef and broccoli, and the beef was chewy. The chicken skewer and orange chicken were actually good. They served lobster that night and I took a small piece which only made me want more, it was good. I had a little bit of the pad Thai and it was just OK.  I also tried their donut which wasn't too bad. Not too much flavor, it tasted like fried dough that you would get at a fair.

5575722,2008-03-17,0,C74ViML3zx1akYVafLaiXQ,"I just found out about this place last week. After our ob/gyn department tour at St. Rose, I asked a fellow classmate about any local boba/milk tea places in the area. She suggested this place, since they had pretty good seafood and boba. I decided to try it out for myself with my classmates. For dinner, it only cost us $13. The place is pretty small when you walk in, but there is another eating area in the back. The food selection is somewhat varied. They have a small section for different soups, sushi, a grill area where you can get korean style ribs, seafood and beef cooked to your taste, dim sum, vegetables, and seafood, of course! I didn't get a chance to taste the lobster, since many people grab those first, and I didn't want to wait for them to make more...I love the spinach and the soy sauce/ginger fish they have. They have a mediocre dessert section (what do you expect from Asian buffets?), and I usually just get their almond jello fruit medley and coconut/orange jellos. Don't worry, they have the frozen yogurt machine, if all else fails! 

The sushi is pretty fresh (mostly the salmon!). It's pretty cheap for what you get here, and I probably will take my parents here when they come visit. Warning: any food that is wasted will get charged.

In reality, I would only give this place 3 stars, but since they have all you can drink tapioca drinks (TARO MILK TEA!) that are pretty good, as well as Thai ice teas, included in their buffet....I'm going to give them 4 stars!",Tk_FWXueutKii3f9yJFsdw,0,1,4,2lCibPM-QRwvxLdLLa2RpQ

I walked into this place knowing exactly what to expect - cheap, greasy Chinese food that will get you full. It was a weekend night, and all the nicer Las Vegas buffets had too long of a wait time for me to want to stand in line. I was hungry, and could pretty much eat anything after spending the entire day hiking in Death Valley.

Most of the food was decent; dishes are filled with MSG and oil but it's still tasty. There was a pretty good selection and you really can't go wrong when the tab is around $12-13 for dinner.",-2ETDtjV_ujly9HckLhZMQ,0,0,3,21dRr06aX8YKn_Sqd0A00A
5659838,2010-12-29,1,C74ViML3zx1akYVafLaiXQ,"I took my seven year old brother here last night (12/27/10) for a sister-brother date. My dinner was $12.99 and his was $6.99 for the kid's price. We were seated at a booth and went to town - sort of. 

Maybe it's just me, but I'd like to see more non-seafood options for dinner. I'm not one to pile a plate 13 inches deep with crab legs and shrimp to chow down. I did like the neon orange honey shrimp and the seafood stuffing, served on a scallop shell, but wished they offered more non-seafood choices. 

My little brother tried sushi for the first time (didn't like it) and a frog leg. I told him it was chicken and he said that he liked it until it ""started to taste like seafood."" He was a big fan of the baby corn in the seafood medley. He was quite worried about cleaning his plate because he saw a sign that said that if food was wasted, there'd be an extra charge. We only took tablespoons of this and that, so it wasn't a problem. 

The ice cream machine was out for almost all of dinner. We had the coconut jello which was good, and the rest of the desserts were ok. The candied nuts were decent. When the vanilla ice cream light went on, there was a big line for the ice cream - I got up to help my brother, as I had done the entire night, and our waiter completely cleared our table, like we left! We were seriously 6 ft away! My brother was a little upset because we had been hiding scallop shells in a napkin to take home and they got thrown away so we snuck two more out when we sat back down.

In addition to our table being cleared in the middle of dinner, nobody ever came to ask if we needed refills or anything. We were ignored the entire time by the staff. I had to ask for a water when our plates were cleared because they pretended like we weren't there. We were chewing on ice almost the entire night. 

I've had good Asian buffets and bad ones, and this one is about middle of the road in terms of quality. I had to knock it down one star for service.",OLn8EvPsu4hNug8V5PF2jA,4,2,2,t0MSb_L1cmLxx1QkUzBixA

Price was $15 during dinner, which is outrageously expensive because the selection wasn't good for the price and the food tasted terrible. There was not one dish that I enjoyed here.

I had a really hard time enjoying this place. It looks and feels dirty. Flies flying around the food.

So to summarize.. EXPENSIVE, BAD SELECTION FOR $$$$, BAD QUALITY, DIRTY...

I have no idea why some people would rate this place highly...they are either associated with Buffet @ Asia or they have been fed dog food their whole lives. Seriously.

So when I asked again about the price she made it sound like the waitress had to come over and measure again.  ??  The very rude cashier took my husbands card and swiped it.  When I asked what was going on,  she flipped out, got very loud and  told us we don't have to come back if we don't

Once you've tried Todai and the Rio's Seafood Buffet, give this place a shot and I don't think you'll want to go back to either place for a seafood buffet ever again. I actually like it better than Todai and the Rio. It's got a better selection of food and it's half the price. Albeit the décor isn't as nice as the other two places, but I would trade a nicely decorated place for better food any day. The quality of the food is slightly better at Todai and the Rio, however it's not twice the price better, it maybe only be $2 - 3 better. 

This place has got you covered with a little bit of Chinese, Thai, Korean, Mongolian BBQ, dim sum, and a decent sushi bar (the freshness is a bit hit and miss towards the end of the night, but spectacular at lunch). Dinner gives you a selection of lobster, snow crab, mussels, oysters, fried shrimp, fried scallops, and so much more. 

Since this place is off the strip, you also don't have to wait in the long lines. The servers are quite attentive, they will take plates almost as soon as you are done with it and I never quite saw the bottom of my glass. 

This is our go to place when we were living in Las Vegas and had out of town guests that wanted a buffet. They've never been disappointed.

Food is okay- too much mono-sodium if you ask me. Some food are just completely tasteless and dry- like their ribs. Most of food are just okay and filling. I'm a fan of their fried frogs and salt-and-pepper pork.
