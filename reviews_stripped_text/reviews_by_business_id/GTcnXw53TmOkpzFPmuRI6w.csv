But did you know they also offer soup and porridge too. The moment I saw Champorado ($3.99) and Chicken Arroz Caldo ($3.99), I just had to have it. With the cold weather still lingering in Las Vegas, I have been wanting some hot soup. The Chicken Arroz Caldo is a savory rice porridge flavored with chicken and saffron, and it taste so good! The Champorado is a Filipino sweet rice chocolate porridge and it's not as sweet as I anticipated. I think Crispy Town is okay if you enjoy eating lots of fried food. Personally, I prefer having the soup and porridge.",dpvR4LYXr0CYHtHf8BeCKg,1,1,3,If37Sa7X_W09uVpPKP6riw

Crispy Town has one of the better tasting and better portioned fried Filipino dishes in Vegas that I've had. Their crispy a la carte items are sold by weight and priced decently. The bengat (lechon) is not dried out or overcooked and the chicken skin crispiness is what I really liked. It's even better when paired with garlic fried rice! Haha! It wasn't too salty and the vinegar dipping sauce it comes with has a unique flavor and made for a great combination. 

You take a number to place your order. I'm very happy this place opened. I was deprived for a while because Filipino style crispy chicken skin is hard to find in Vegas. This will be my monthly ritual besides Popeye's. LOL!",pm7K54T6OmsDHREtiVBWGQ,5,5,4,GWuoj2gxDtZTcKPn_gZkjw

Hubs & I drive all the way from the West side in search of fried pork skin & fried chicken skin to go with our weekly dose of papaya salad.  Crispy Town had both...yay!

The friendly counter lady allowed us to sample everything in the warming trays.  Everything was indeed crispy...but a bit salty for me.  Hubs loved it all though.  So we bought a little bit of everything & A LOT of the fried chicken skin.  That was the clear winner :) 

Even after a week, the chicken skin remained crispy.  To freshen it up a bit, we'd throw a batch into the toaster oven for about 5 minutes on ""light toast"" right before service...yum!

Wanted to compare Crispy Town's Crispy Chicken Skin with another nearby spot, so we took the chance and were not disappointed! That vinegar dipping sauce is money!!!

I think I like these over pork chicharrones, but that's personal preference. To make things worse, another temptation is just a couple of doors down...yup, Magnolia Ice Cream. It's a good thing we don't live close by!  ALOHA!!!

Crispy Town is like the naughty sibling to Grill City next door...instead of grilling everything, why don't we FRY everything instead?  This my friends is what Crispy Town is!  Everything and a vat of oil!

To accompany our order from Grill City, we (well I) decided to give Crispy Town a go and get a 'Value Meal' from them as well.  We got:

*#1 - Bagnet with eggplant salad ($6.99)

Bagnet is basically fried pork belly.  Yes, fried tasty pieces of essentially what is known as uncured bacon!!  It is delicious as it sounds, particularly with a large serving of steamed white rice and a side of suko (vinegar) & soy sauce or All-Purpose sauce!  For just over $7 after tax I could see myself eating this at LEAST once a week!  Oh that fatty, fried pork belly with a scoop of rice, with some eggplant salad to cut the richness?  AI SOS!  Cut to napping.

For those of you new to eggplant salad, for us Filipinos it's a salad with roasted eggplant mixed with diced red onions & bell peppers.  Doused with some soy sauce it's a great accompaniment with fried foods.

Besides the the value meal, we also got an order of Fried Calamari to share...because, why not?  This was yummy too!  Fried fresh, light & airy, and went awesome with the rest of our meal.

Only complaint here is that AGAIN, the line can be horrendous & you are also sharing your table space with patrons from Grill City!  Seating is all in the same area.  It can (and will) get busy especially on the weekends.

If it's done RIGHT, how can you go WRONG with fried foods from Crispy Town!

4367113,2016-07-13,0,GTcnXw53TmOkpzFPmuRI6w,"It's not a particularly strong competition to Grill City which is steps nearby.  However, we chose this place seeing as there were only a couple of customers and we figured the line at Grill City was a bit too long for us.  I don't have to say that it's pretty common for customers to pause and take a few seconds to decide on their order.  There were four of us in our group, two of which could not decide on what to order.  Right away, I sensed that the lady behind the counter was clearly annoyed and tried to hurry them into ordering, even cutting us off mid-order so that she can expedite the process, and even elevating the tone in her voice.  I tried clarifying the confusion between the two in our group so that we could order as I now felt the need to rush them because of the Crispy Pata lady's demeanor; mind you, NO ONE was behind us in line, otherwise I would have understood the reason for hurrying us.  I then sternly asked, borderline order her to give us just a few seconds seeing as there was no one waiting in line behind us.  She grumbled and stepped back all the while banging serving spoons around as if it wasn't at all apparent to us that she was upset.  It is unacceptable, as a customer, to have been treated so poorly for no good reason.  If she cannot produce a better attitude to be able to work professionally with customers, then she should not be working in this type of industry where she has to constantly interact with customers.  Now I can't speak for the entire crew's regard for customer service as I had only dealt with the one lady.  I can only hope the others have better treatment of customers as our patronage is the reason they have a job.  The food here is not great, but it's satisfactory and definitely has room to improve.  The only other thing that would help it is exceptional customer service, which unfortunately, was severely lacking during our visit, so needless to say, customer service has to improve by A LOT.

3 stars for food, but extremely poor customer service lowered the overall rating to 1 star because one's overall experience combines both the food and customer service.",IyIvCd2_sM9J2vh7NOkaRA,1,1,1,IboYameIRlszquXOeWJu_w

RUDE CASHIER!!

I hope the staff are reading this because I'm about to give you some FREE helpful tips to avoid situations like this in the future. I'm doing you a favor despite the horrible service I received, tonight.

So, I got a coupon for a $2 taho promo for shopping at the grocery. I went in line to avail it. It was a looong wait because the customers before me took forever to order and most of the staff were not paying attention. 

Tip 1: Customers first!!
They were doing other things instead of minding CUSTOMERS!! Your business comes from customer transactions. Help them first before you do other stuff!

Anyway, a nice guy noticed me waiting and prepared my order. Then I waited some more at the register to get charged for it. After what seemed like forever, the guy reminded one of the ladies that I've been waiting. The lady finally charged me for it then checked my coupon and my receipt. Only AFTER the charge had gone through did she had the audacity to tell me that I don't actually qualify for the promotion because apparently I needed to have spent at least $25 at the grocery to avail it.

Tip 2: Check for requirements before processing any transactions!!
Are you serious?? You could've told me in the first place that I did not qualify so I didn't have to wait for so long!!! Also, the way she told me that was plain rude! She sounded annoyed like I did it on purpose or like I was some kind of cheater trying to scam them (of taho?? Seriously?? Ganun ba kasarap taho niyo?) 

Tip 3: Think before you speak.
Lady, you work in customer service. There are better ways to tell a customer they don't qualify without being rude! Specially if it's not the customers fault! No where on the receipt NOR the coupon does it say the that purchase had to be at least $25!!!

All this rudeness for a $2 dessert??

Tip 4: Communication goes a long way!
Since it's not on any of the receipts/coupons, please communicate this restriction to the grocery cashiers so they don't give ""unqualified"" customers your coupons. It will save, not just the customers, but also YOUR TEAM a lot of time and effort. Maybe, it will also save them from rude encounters like the one I experienced tonight.

I was just passing through to see what was on the menu & what first caught my eye was the fried chicken skin.  

So what did I do, ordered a half pound of it.  All for under $5. Mm mm mmmm.  Okay, that was going on in my head, when I finally tasted it, it wasn't as I imagined it.  

It tasted more on the chicharon side then deep fried chicken skin peeled off the chicken.  I think it missed the natural flavor of the chicken and it was a bit on the saltier than expected.  

However, I still enjoyed it and dipping it in the vinegar sauce makes a lot better.  Definitely something to eat while you are enjoying a beer and watching your favorite sport.

Just as an FYI they did have some others things that were not fried.  Their pinakbet looked better than the pinakbet that was served at Grill city..that one was cooked in coconut milk...not my Filipino style.
