I suppose, and is now called House of Liquor. Well, the new owner is great! Very friendly and accommodating! The store's clean too! The best part of this place is they have Mediterranean food selections, which I'm really excited about. Mediterranean food is one of my favorites!!",8am-kFvjaKj8uE3jBMmCmA,0,0,5,Khh6oxj2GOiGCk5yeQmq3w
258015,2017-01-27,0,ZyHdmeEnucnlMlK2Yk8fUQ,I love this place!! We've been going here since the transition from the old to the new owners. They have an  amazing selection and will gladly order something for you. And the food... don't get me started on the food. It is amazing!!! Some of the best Greek food I've ever had. Their prices are very reasonable and the lunch specials come with a ton of food. They are incredibly friendly and generous and truly love their customers.,pZNF_m0NJ0765IBdgJkHdA,1,1,5,OBsSIiQlzYtOMBlVgq3KcA

1578936,2018-04-09,1,ZyHdmeEnucnlMlK2Yk8fUQ,I found the food to be disgusting...and I eat almost anything. There's a reason that their parking lot is almost always empty.,8GWvPUh3uPOfertXaHED6A,0,0,1,T696uupx7IviMbSxdh5gdw

My husband stopped in to grab a quick six pack of Bud Light Lime, and upon opening two bottles, both of us knew something wasn't right with the beer. We checked the date on the box and they had expired in MARCH. It's almost November. Really? They tasted foul.
For a House of Liquor, this place needs to make sure the ""liquor"" is fresh.",_JNI4tbgJKLG2kFQtXxy5w,1,0,1,7Uf6mqXxtpNpEmffcecsNQ

Ask what's the best thing they have that day because it may not be on the menu and it'll probably be amazing.  If you like having your food put together by really nice men who take pride in what they make for you, I highly suggest this place.",C1km1WMqrB6wQRFuuaA7zw,0,0,5,Ep2ququEhnIo1Ry1CTg7FA
3226105,2017-02-27,0,ZyHdmeEnucnlMlK2Yk8fUQ,I love this place. I come there all the time. I always deal with the owner there and he is the best. He's always so nice and helps me find exactly what I need. If I ever don't find what I want he orders it and it's there within days. I absolutely love this place. Never came when it was owed by the previous people when I went there it was always empty the shelves would be so plain with maybe one of a particular thing never was stalked. Now I go there anytime I need something quick. Thanks!!!!,dX6Fy6jPox4Cretw0tyh9w,0,0,5,etDxWPbxHwaiOA1rGn7Ngg
3398849,2017-03-09,0,ZyHdmeEnucnlMlK2Yk8fUQ,I would have posted a picture but it's pretty much demolished at this point. First off the customer service is absolutely amazing. The owner is super friendly which started the experience off well! Secondly the falafel was so amazing I didn't want to stop eating it! Lastly you can't beat the price of this place we got a falafel plate and a veggie plate for 20$ and still have food left over for a whole other meal! Definitely going back again!!,fspUpdLJmr9taTr2scl5Kg,0,0,5,yJhn6F5nSOOtf-vd86qkkw

Very clean the two guys that run this place or always warm and welcoming always willing to spark up a convo! They have the best selection of Mexican candies!!


And they also of a lot of bottles that other places do not have like wild turkey etc.

We got some chicken plate and some Shawarma panini and even though it was a lot of food I still got some Dolmas because I couldn't resist it, the place looked clean and the owner was super nice. I will definitely stop by more often for lunch. 
Note: it's a liquor store that serves food also, but there is a separate section for food and they're rated A from the health department.",Z40Pf1rkPStbSJ9OXRVA2g,0,0,5,zd93Log9DsNXOrfILqFfwA

5628254,2017-03-10,0,ZyHdmeEnucnlMlK2Yk8fUQ,"I'm usually hard to impress when it comes to Mediterranean food, especially if it's Lebanese food. This is by far the best Lebanese food I've had in Las Vegas, and I say that not only as a foodie but also as a Brazilian who has eaten her body weight in tabbouleh (and let me tell you, in Brazil there's Lebanese food everywhere)!

What I love best other than the food is that the owners are incredibly kind and helpful. I've been twice so far and they remembered me right away.  You can tell they love doing what they do and the market itself has an air of familiarity I wouldn't have expected.

I've gotten the chicken plate with rice, hummus, and tabbouleh which was phenomenal. You can taste the freshness of the food in every bite; it literally tastes healthy and amazing at the same time. My fiance got the gyro and it was gone in seconds! That tells you right there how much he didn't like it.

My second time going to House of Liquor, I got the vegetarian combo and a side of kibbeh. Not only was the food oh so pretty but it tasted delicious and I had enough for lunch the next day.

I'll definitely be coming back regularly.",JflrDorwVeY1j4GTjqZmAg,0,0,5,ilt9G_YheZ0RB7-aAbw6aQ
