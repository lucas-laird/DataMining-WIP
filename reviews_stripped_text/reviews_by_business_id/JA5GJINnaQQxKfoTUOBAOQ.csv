A must is the carne asada  burrito, torta's, or for sharing, asada fries or nachos! Breakfast is pretty good here too, plenty of chorizo dishes! 
The Chicken is ok, with the Carnita's being the better choice. 
The salsa rojo and verde is not too bad, plenty of flavor and heat!

Have had numerous things from here. Chicken tacos are bomb, little greasy but damn tasty. California burrito is good, way better than those I have had at Roberto's. My wife digs the carne asada taco's, I'll agree with some other reviewers though, not very big on seasoning flavor here, but it is quality meat and the salsa, cilantro and guac makes them go down easy.

All in all, this place is cheap eats, done proper. And oh yeah open 24/7. Can't be beat really.",x16Fl_5h9aX4tn38kKSGHw,2,1,4,02DVC7Ms8YnTpVXpSjGMOA
919491,2011-03-08,1,JA5GJINnaQQxKfoTUOBAOQ,"I have been regularly coming here since I was a senior at Sierra Vista in 2004, and seeing how it's still around, you can tell it has to be good or at least have a good reputation.   My love for breakfast burritos?  It all started here.

Amigos Tacos is a mexican restaurant akin to Robertos, but in my opinion better.  Their prices are reasonable to your wallet and their portion sizes are quite large.  The dining area and restrooms are very clean as well.  There is a small salsa bar in the side, but if you love punishing your colon as much as I do, ask for the special habanero salsa behind the counter!  They also have a TV, which varies in showing either the news in english, spanish telenovelas or soccer.  

Their beef tacos are great, but HOLY CRAP THE BREAKFAST BURRITOS ARE AHH-MAZING!!!!!!  Seriously, my addiction for Breakfast Burritos started with their ham and eggs breakfast burrito.  The burrito is huge, and stuffed with who knows how many eggs, ham and potatoes.  Nothing like having one of those and drowning it in Habanero salsa.  I have yet to try most of what else is on the menu simply because I am horribly addicted to those delicious breakfast burritos.  

Best of all, they are open 24 hours, so it's a perfect option sober or drunk!  Hooray for all-hours eating, which will probably be the eventual death of my workout regime even though I deny it every time!  Yes, truly a Vegas staple.

PROS:
Tacos and burritos are oh so good.
Specifically their breakfast burritos, I can't get enough of them!
Clean tables and bathrooms
24 hours to satisfy your altered state of mind!

CONS:
Nada

From experience, my preferrred orders:

Carne Asada Burrito or Tacos: The burritos here are wrapped tight and more long than thick. The meat isn't super tasty but it does carry that authentic flavor without and trace of grease! 

Bean and Cheese Burrito: Their Beans here are among the best refried beans I've had! Beans may just be a filler to some but I always pay attention and adore beans in my mexican food! Sometimes I add sour cream.. 

Other great options: carne asada fries or nachos (could feed 3-4 hungry peeps), california burrito, cheese enchiladas..

* They got this habanero sauce that they don't have available at their 'get it yourself' condiment bar (they used to). For those brave, hot chili sauce lovers, try this! You must ask one of the staff members for it because its in they now store it in their kitchen fridge.

First, they really need to turn down the tv in order to understand me when I give my order.  Place isn't too crowded nor too pricey.  I had to give their carne asada fries a try.. I'm a sucker when it comes to french fries.  Overall, I think that it was not too bad, but they should have put the sour cream and guacamole on the top of the meat.. It just made the fries soggy and soft.  I did give their salsa and pico de gallo sauce a try, but was too impress since it wasn't hot enough.  I believe they have another spicier sauce, but you have to ask.. I think it would be much easier for them and me if you just put it out..

Place does accept major credit cards and offer cups for water. Seating is open and it's a clean it yourself when you're done kind of place.  There is a TV and a salsa bar.  Drinks are soft self served.
Parking is pretty open since it's a huge parking lot with Vons.

They were pretty fast in making it just waited about 5 mins. If your planning on taking it to go be careful because it's a little flexible, maybe they could make it like a chimichanga so that its firmer.

2519259,2011-03-03,0,JA5GJINnaQQxKfoTUOBAOQ,"If you think Taco Bell is quality Mexican food you probably won't like these types of places....But for those of us with more sense, it is Great to have places like this to get great little tacos even at 4 AM, since they are open 24 hours.

Amigos gets 4 stars because:
It's open 24 hours; 
The tacos are consistent and overflowing with meat; T
he specialty habanero sauce (by request only) is INSANELY hot but when used sparingly ads great flavor to the tacos. 
4 small tacos and a drink combo is $6.75

The reason it's not 5 stars:
The variety of the tacos is missing a few staples (there is NO CABEZA) which, in my opinion makes the best tacos. 
They claim to have the world's best chicken enchilada...OK it is a big portion for the cost, and does include delicious chunks of dark and white chicken....But nothing ever needs as much sour cream as this enchilada has. it is literally stuffed and topped with so much sour cream you almost can't taste anything else.
I once had to borrow a large serrated knife from the kitchen while I was dining in, because they were completely out of plastic knives. 

For the brave with huge appetites they have the 22"" 4 lb. burrito, which you can often see people leaving with as if carrying a huge loaf of french bread over their shoulder or cradling like a small child. They stuff everything in it including the beans and rice. I'm not a fan of this style because all the flavors run together, but.....at only $15 for 4 lbs. it is a more reasonable challenge than the one featured on Man vs. Food from NASCAR cafe, and its more cost efficient to feed 4 people with. Split one with 3 friends and its only $3.75 for each person to have a 1 lb. burrito.

My advice is to stick with the tacos and get it to go.

We used to be fans of Robertos and Faustos but NOT ANYMORE! The first night we got carne asada fries, bean and cheese burrito, and rolled tacos. Oh my gosh. I don't think I've ever had better carne asada. It is SO tender and my teeth cut through it like buttah, not chewy at all, or dry. It is perfect and super flavorful. 

Bean and cheese burrito is standard but delicious when I'm craving some legumes. Rolled tacos are also standard as I can't distinct the difference between these and other taco joints. The second night, we got carnitas nachos. I had to order these when I found out that they weren't the shredded carnitas, but rather the chopped and thrown on the flat top kind! These were also super tender and flavorful.

They are cash only.

From what I remember the carne asada fries were very very large.  They don't come with salsa, which I guess is common for non Los Angeles mexican restaurants from which I order carne fries from, but nevertheless you can add from salsa bar.  Comes with fries carne asada, cheese, gwak, sour cream, and a hint of refried beans (those are the mashed ones, not the whole beans).  

The rest of my party ordered: taco, tostada, and chimichanga.  All of these looked delicious as well.  Too bad I didn't get a bite.


Also tried the lingua tacos (cow tongue) that I did not order but was offered a bite.  They were pretty decent, for being tongue and for never trying them before.  Had the texture of soft beef brisket and tofu, but tasted like turkey.    

If you feed them to you cat you can say, ""Cat got your tongue?""",MxaKSTr4qVj5XtRvbami6g,0,0,4,Y_w5hZgsMUgZF1kyUvHi-w

3826889,2010-12-11,1,JA5GJINnaQQxKfoTUOBAOQ,"Was in the area and decided to stop by for lunch.  It's a small, casual dining restaurant with seating for about 20 people.  It has a small salsa bar, which is always a plus to me.

After browsing the menu for a while, I decided to order a Carne Asada Burrito ($5.25) and a Carnitas Taco ($2.65).  I asked the guy taking my order if they had a spicier Salsa than what they had on the Salsa Bar.  To my surprise, he said they had a Habanero Salsa that they make in the kitchen but it has to be a special request because it's that hot.....perfect!  I asked for a side of that too.

After a few minutes, it was ready and I picked up my order from the counter.  The Burrito was huge!  I eagerly took a bite with a little Habanero Salsa.....yum!  Very tasty and spicy!  The Carne Asada had a good flavor to it and was slightly dry, but that's ok with me.  There was a good ratio of Guacamole and Beans in the Burrito and the Tortilla held up well.....it didn't fall apart, which I don't enjoy.

The Carnitas Taco was just OK.  I thought the Carnitas lacked flavor.  I won't order this next time.

Overall, it was a good meal.

But alas, it too is worse than a TV dinner would have provided. Well, at least the chips and salsa are satisfying...  no, not really. And how can you screw that up. Just buy some fritos and pass it on if you can't do it right yourself.

The place wins on service and a passable chile relleno, but that's about it. Sad, as I had high hopes.  But really, I have to save at least one poor soul from this mis-step.",331GTyeQvzDxxfyBWnd5fg,0,0,1,twYC6NGKvMxPFEscNl2h2w

This time the BF got a California burrito and I got a carnitas burrito. It was pretty good flavor and there wasn't odd chewy or dry spots, only nice and juicy meat. Only ""bad"" thing about it was it needed a tad more seasoning on the meat as adding tad of salt brought the meat out. The guacamole and salsa was fresh tasting which can be a bit shaky with some of these late night Mexican food places. Their burritos are also on the heavy side- more generous with the filling than most. 

It's definitely fresher tasting and seems a bit more consistent in quality and flavor than Robertos and other late night Mexican.",n86B7IkbU20AkxlFX_5aew,6,4,4,tLRwYRRYr6RvTayjylt8tA

This place spanks every taco shop in town (Roberto's, Tortas Del Rey, Tacos Mexico), you name it! This place is makes is delicious! There's not at bad item on them menu. This little gem in nestled in the SE corner of a Smith's parking lot. 

My favorites here are tamales, chimichangas (beef, please), and their cheese enchiladas. There are several combinations, ala carte items, and different combo deals.

There salsa is on par with what you find at other taco shops (and I hate them all, what the hell is that shit anyway). The food here is so bomb dot com, that you won't need any of that other business.

The one draw back is that this place serves Pepsi, but I don't eat on places depending on what beverage options are available and I always get my food to-go. If you live in the SW area of town (Rhodes Ranch especially) get on this. It's addictive like crack!

* Food: Pretty good. I had a chicken taco and a steak taco with guac and pico...not bad. They have the sauce bar with the average green and red sauce.

* Service: Friendly staff willing to answer questions and made a combo suggestion!

* Overall experience: Good.

5864015,2010-08-26,1,JA5GJINnaQQxKfoTUOBAOQ,"I recently moved away from my favorite grungy Mexican food source, Filipitos.  So I'm on the prowl for a new place.  Enter Amigos.  The place is tucked inside a strip mall, an inconspicuous looking place, typical for the valley.  The decor is what one would expect from a Mexican place catering to Americans.  Couple this with the claim of being the ""best Mexican food in the valley"", who doesn't make that claim?  My expectations where low.  

I ordered the Green Chili Chicken Enchilada plate, to-go.  Sounds good, a bit safe (it is easier to gauge a place by trying something you are familiar with).  When I got home & opened the box, I was confronted with a familiar sight and sound.  Nothing about the food is standing out.  And that's a good thing.  They aren't trying to be some hoity toity place.  This is cheap Mexican food.  Perfect!  

First up the re-fried beans. Ick!  Talk about a bland experience.  I'll pass on these from here on out.  Next the rice....Now that's some good rice.  Great texture, not a dry grain in the bunch.  It wasn't soggy either and had a great flavor.  Now on to the enchilada.  First this looked more like a wet burrito than an enchilada.  The green chili sauce was sparingly ladled on.  Not a minus, just a note.  The chicken though.  Oh, mostly white meat & cooked just right.  The flavor of the chicken was great. It was not drowned out by sauce. (Now you know why having less sauce was a good thing.)  It was clearly the center of this meal.  

The restaurant offers 3 salsas. (A green and red at the self serve bar, a Habanero you have get from the cashier)  The two from the bar are typical.  But a must.  The habanero though.  SPICY HOT.  I love hot, hot and more hot!  So this was right up my alley.  But for those with a less than iron stomach.  Use sparingly or not at all.

All in all, I'm impressed with my new Mexican food source.  I will be coming back.",wfx2G50lMeSK_kqcQqP0lw,1,1,4,W9nhj7b9qUv7GWP4nfI9AQ
