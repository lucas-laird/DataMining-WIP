The menu is easy to understand and has a decent amount of variety for something with ""burger"" in the title. The people who take my order are always knowledgable about the food and are very friendly when answering my questions. 

I love the burgers, they are so juicy and tender and never taste charred at all! The toppings are always fresh and they do not skimp on them at all! Their chili cheese dog is amazing too! 

Besides having great food, I'd have to say that the staff at this location is always super friendly! We've been there a few times and we always manage to strike up a conversation with someone that works there, and they all seem to be genuinely happy to be at work, they're smiling and friendly. 

I would recommend this restaurant to anyone who is looking for a good burger at a good price!",jVbgzstT_hy6qEsWLEKUvA,0,0,4,yIU-WHkMZ5EHaSePn-oGpw

The first time we came here, our orders came out within 10-15 minutes. The burgers were terrific: juicy and delicious. Their smashfries (tossed with olive oil, rosemary, and garlic) and sweet potato fries were very good.

During our second visit, the difference was night and day. It took over 30 minutes from when we ordered to get our food. My burger was extremely well done to the point of being dry and charred. My wife's smashcobb salad was very small for the price and unappetizing as well. Veggie frites were a complete miss and consisted of oily veggies with no crispy coating. The only decent thing about that meal was the regular fries. Were we even dining at the same restaurant?

The third time I came for a CMYE. My order was ready within 15 minutes. I tried one of their new BBQ Ranch chicken sandwiches which was very tasty. However, this time the smashfries were soggy from too much olive oil. I also tried a strawberry shake which was not bad.

When this places fires on all cylinders, it merits a solid 4 stars. When things fall flat, it only barely deserves 2 stars. Until it addresses its lack of consistency, I'm assigning it 3 stars.",LkWNo83Lg92C5V4JEyxOZA,2,1,3,jX-tUc-hKfZ_MAks3YvU9g

It was just meat, cheese and a few mushrooms slapped into a bun without any other condiments. Chili fries were dripping with grease, they serve them on a cardboard plate so it could absorb the grease but they were drenched in red grease from the chili. Sweet potato fries not good enough, they're better at El Pollo Loco. My husband got the baja burger and he said it wasn't good either. It is way over priced for nasty food.

Thank goodness we had a groupon. We heard people ranting and raving about this place and in the words of Shania Twain ""that don't impress me much.""

My friend ordered the traditional All-American cheeseburger, smashfries and vanilla milkshake. I tried her fries and booo no flavor, which was a shame since they were sprinkled with Rosemary & garlic (I couldn't taste either).

I ordered the SinCity burger since it sounded like the best burger on the menu plus many stated this was the best burger. Was it? Uh negative, I personally thought it was too salty and dry. The egg was overcooked and the bacon was eh ok. It was topped with haystraw onion rings and grilled onions so onion overload indeed. Presentation was wonderful but the taste was less gratifying. Even the sweet potato smashfries had no flavor even with the rosemary and garlic that was on them. Perhaps sprinkle some of that secret smash seasoning on the fries and you might move up a star.

BTW the fried pickles were super salty, if you like fried pickles just stick to Hooters.

Overall this place is busy and had a line the whole time we were there. My friend and I couldn't understand what was so great about this place. Yes the cashiers and servers were friendly but they couldn't compensate for the quality of the food.

I'm not a big burger person - in fact have never had one in my life but you know what I have had a lot of? Chicken Sandwiches. And you know who's was the JUICIEST EVER?

Smashburger (aka: Smashchicken).

My B.F.F. had been RAVING about Smashburger for weeks now. She was obsessed with the chicken sandwich and kept telling me about their Veggie sides.

I, however, went with the Onion Haystack which was a delicious pile of thinly sliced onion strings that HIT. THE. SPOT. 

AND I got to build my own which is SO much easier in my book since I am a ""high-maintenance"" diner always asking you to hold this and that. Creating my own = creating the best.

The front counter girl was ADORABLE and super friendly and bubbly. Our food took about 10 minutes to come out and we were ""not allowed"" to clean up after ourselves. So service bumped this place up to a 5=starer.

Also, for all your Vegas Groupon lovers out there....today's featured business is Smashburger, $6 for $12 of some delicious nommin'. I think we bought 3 :)",lZmioQVRUrVdNNuF2qByYA,3,2,5,pAVeTS6zJldJhjB6UptpwA

Long: Arrived here around 7pm for some late to-go dinner. Was met with a dull ""Welcome"" and ordered my food from someone who seemed like they couldn't smile.
When I got home with my food, it was terrible.
The Sin City burger's buns were falling apart, so I couldn't hold and eat it. All the toppings were smeared with sauce and grease--which is fine--but it made it all taste like the same mush. No texture other than soggy mush.
The Truffle Mushroom Swiss burger was a bit better and could be eaten by hand.
The sides were the worse:
The fries were STALE. They weren't crunchy, but hard and had a off after-taste. I didn't finish them.
The haystack onions were a complete joke. The serving was the size of a half-cup measuring cup--a bit larger than the sauce cup they came with. This filled a quarter of the fry container they came in. And they were soaked with oil. It took a couple napkins to soak up all the oil. Then they were mushy--nothing like haystack onions.

I will not return here as there's better food elsewhere. You can get better sides at any fast-food restaurant, and better burgers at places like Carl's Jr. and Fatburger--for a better price!",kBoCLXsjzpSTpOKC9J6FUg,0,0,2,2DAX756VlzZc2ZvQQUmoKQ

704974,2013-01-25,0,diY31IEunbV8MfDh81FS1A,"So I work in the office complex right next to this Smashburger. I have several issues with this Smashburger but sadly continue to go there because they are the only burger place close enough to walk for my half hour lunch.  My issue are as follows.

1. The running joke in our office is ""What will our mystery meal be today?""  This is because regardless of what we order we wind up with something different every time. The last time I went there was Tuesday of this same week and the order was so wrong, and I since I walk there I was a little annoyed they were out of togo cup lids. They were also out of large bags to carry the 4 smaller paper bags full of food for my whole office, and ice cream for a milkshake. I called them when I got back to the office because our order was so wrong and got their voicemail and left a very detailed message with my name and that I would like a manager or owner to call me back. No one ever called.

2. Today I checked my order before leaving and it was wrong AGAIN! I decided to bring it to their attention the problem with the consistency and expeditor accuracy of the food. This was received by the shift leader with an apology and an offer to remake my food, but the young man who took my order decided to argue with me about what I order first. When I pointed out to the shift leader that I had left a message on their answering maching addressing this issue and never got a courtesy call back he tried to say their phones got disconnected. I explained I got their voicemail left a message and still no call back.  After that the manager called back to the kitchen to advise them there was a cheese substitutaion and a cook named Ryan argued and yelled back at him rudely.

3. Before he could finish helping me another manager pulled him aside and started lecturing him in great detail about something in a booth in front of all the customers.

4. When they completed our order I apologized to a young woman manager for making a fuss but they had a right to know they their order accuracy is terrible. She apologized this fact and said they are trying to work on this and other issues.

5. Upon returning to the office and opening my lovely little present from ""Ryan"" one burger was assembled so haphazardly that the top of the bun was saturated in mustard and mayo and  when we opened the paper the burger fell out of the bun and on the floor. The other had a ridiculously large amout of onions piled on it and the same issues with the burger not being assembled neatly enough to be eaten with your hands.

6. On a side note. Was also unimpressed that the girl that works their with the pink and black hair who had screwed up the expedition of my order on Tuesday was in the store on her day off eating with her friend and cursing/bickering with the kid behind the counter about how she works her ass off and needs a day off, and at one point took a cup that she didn't want  but had her hands all over back up to the front counter and put it back with the other cups for the new customers and I watched him give it to the next person in line.

7.  Oh and the kid that rang me up and handles the money went straight from there to the pass thru window and started handling orders coming out of the kitchen without washing his hands, and while he was handling my food and putting the condiments in bags there was a kid standing right next to the condiment/prep table trying to stuff one trashbag full of trash into another bag full of trash and then take them both out of the trashcan.  So gross and unsanitary.


Understand this is all while a shift leader and two managers are in the store, but the female assistant manager was the only one working in the store, because the other manager was talking to the shift leader in front of the customers about back of house issues.

I realize it's just a burger place, but they tout themselves charge more for being fresh and a little more than some drive thru shack.

The fact is I feel bad for whoever bought this franchise because his employees are doing them a huge disservice.  Good product and good location terrible management and customer service.",5ZzvHHYj9Ws4nChtIf9acw,1,0,1,S32dsmacyUeg9xcuUtWVnw

Since we had dined there several times before, we knew that the onion straws and the fried pickles came with sauces. There were no sauces served so we asked him for the accompanying sauces. He looked a little frazzled and said he would be right back with them. My wife took a nibble at my daughters fries and they were cold. Not even warm but cold. The server returned with only the onion straw sauce. We reminded him that we wanted the fried pickle sauce also and let him know that my daughter's fries were cold. He tried to make light of the situation and said how cold fries were no good. He left to go get the sauce and some hot fries we assumed. As we dug into our burgers, we noticed that the onion straws were not their usual crispy, hot selves. These were luke warm, oily and limp. The plan was to let the server know this when he returned with the fried pickle sauce and the hot fries. He never returned. Sure, we saw him floating around the restaurant which wasn't busy. Poor service & inconsistent food are never a good combination.

Note - you can make your own burger and there's a menu with a slew of free sauces and toppings.  That'll be my next burger.

What put me over the top was their smashfries.  Wow.  Rosemary, olive oil and garlic.  I wish it was served a bit more crispy as I prefer my fries more well done but the flavor was incredible.  I'll just ask for it well done next time.   My next fries order will be the truffle fries.  I'm drooling already.

Probably since the ""100% Angus Beef is smashed on the grill"".  Bad technique for burgers since smashing patties squeezes the juices from them. French fries are very unspectacular.  Dinning room is your basic strip mall sub-leased space but decent decor.  Great shakes with real Haagen-Dazs ice cream. One area where SB separates itself from the others is they have iced mugs for their root beer and have beer and wine as well.  Was expecting more because of the hype, but burger was pretty good anyway.  Not on the same level as In-N-Out or Five Guys but definitely better than your normal fast food burger joint.",JhV-D6a2tL6xpzGdBruepg,0,0,3,6Ic0Bt0iODSl1XcypQubug

I had a sin city burger on his recommendation and it was pretty great- egg, bacon, cheese, onion (both grilled *and* fried onions, on top of a 1/3lb patty. The patty itself was pretty good, a bit on the salty side. The smash fries were great, tossed with olive oil, sea salt, and rosemary, it added a touch of class to the lowly french fry. 
My friend got a milkshake and I tried it... it was mediocre at best. It didn't even taste like they used chocolate syrup, maybe cocoa powder and vanilla ice cream? Sub-par from what I'm used to at these types of places. 

My general complaint about the burger, though, is that it tries too hard to be so greasy. The bacon, for example, could be cooked to the exact same level of crispiness without having so much grease left on them by cooking it in the oven and finishing it off on the flattop. Same thing with the egg, it didn't need the extra squirt of clarified butter on it, eggs cooked on a flattop are plenty tasty on their own.

I would come here again, but probably not order the sin city burger due to its massive heft and overabundance of grease.",Ae1atVuqSF8r5QkchacXVg,0,0,4,J3AoQ0BpY0RiJ7OMNOgCfw

I. must.  have.  fries.

So I stopped into Smashburger to just get fries.  Before I knew it, the Mushroom Swiss was on the way, too.  How does that happen?  These are great burgers and I love the seasoning.  It is very satisfying and you can get the burger customized to your taste.

So after I order, I proceed to my seat to wait for my meal.  I managed to spill my entire purse in between the booth and the wall next to the booth.  Everything went down that crevice.  Oh how embarrassing.  I managed to pick up most of it, but still needed to get to some things in the crevice.  Ally, my server noticed what was going on, came over and pulled the entire table out, got a broom and pulled out what was remaining.  She looked into it and saw there was nothing else in there.  One of the guys from the kitchen came out too to help and they both were immediately assisting me.  Then we put the table back and got back to normalcy.  By the time that scene was over, my food had arrived. 

Another wonderful burger.  I really should try something other than mushroom swiss but its my go to and I love how it tastes.  Oh and there were those fries I was craving.  Sorry, I didn't leave you any.

1930755,2010-07-01,1,diY31IEunbV8MfDh81FS1A,"A nice flavorful spin on an otherwise bombed out and depleted American favorite.

A little background on the reviewer: i HATE burgers. Most of the bbqs my group had during my military service days were mostly dominated by frozen pre-made burger patties and bland tasteless buns dominated with ketchup and mustard to offer some taste to the otherwise lame and boring mass produced then frozen and shipped or mass baked and full of preservatives buns. Since these days i have ensured no patties of any type is allowed on my own personal home grill. Every time i crave a burger i strictly stick to my favorite chain: In n Out or Sonics.

Smash Burger renews my faith in burgers. Someone dumped a whole bunch of menus on the tables of the little area at the Charleston CSN campus i like to hang out in after class. Out of curiosity i picked one up and browsed. A few types of burgers made my mouth water specifically the Sin City and the Baja as well as their Smash Fries. I informed a buddy of mine and we made it a point to check out. A few days later we barely made it with half an hour before closing time. 

The first thing that struck me was the price and the size of the portions for 1/3rd lb patty burgers. A single burger in a 1/3rd lb side is roughly the price of a chain's value meal but does not include drink or fries. 'This better be the best damn burger i've ever ate' I thought to myself. The second thing that struck me was the tip jar. There were two twenties, a five and a few tens in there...wow they must be doing SOMETHING right.

So we ordered out burgers: One Sin City, One Baja, reg fries, smash fries and two waters. The burgers were Med-Well due to store policy they wouldnt go med-rare but offered med-well. They also cut the burgers in half at our request.

The soda fountain was nicely stocked in the fact that they had fresh (not dry but soft and juicy) lemon wedges.

Burgers and fries came roughtly 15 minutes later. First impression: Damn i forgot to ask for no onions on the Sin City my bad... Second Impression: Wow this burger is fresh...Very Fresh...OMFG I THINK I'M BURNING MY TONGUE WITH THIS BURGER! SPIT IT OUT! no wait...this is actually pretty good....OH GOD MY TONGUE IS BURNING!!

True story i actually burned my tongue on the first bite. 

The Sin City Burger is something you'd want to eat everyday but dont because you dont want to begin to count the calories. Very flavorful due to the fried eggs and fried onions, the Smash Sauce they use has a nice zing to it as well. VERY impressed even if it did render my taste buds numb for the next few days.

The Baja burger was something else entirely. Most 'spicy' burgers (that arent chicken) have such a heat to it that there's no flavor. Others have flavor but just a little hint of heat. the Baja was PERFECTLY BALANCED and was amazing. First bite i could taste the bun and the sauce a few chews later intergrated the juicy beef and between third and fourth the heat began to rise. The second bite reset the whole experience right down to the end.

The standard fries were standard fries but the oil they used was changed out recently and it showed int he quality.

The smash fries were a bit greasy but had a very nice rosemary essence. In my opinion they were too weak on the garlic and too heavy on the olive oil. 

Despite the higher price compared to fast food chains my comrade and made several notations to the staff that they'll be seeing us again and more frequently in future.

Overall i would highly recommend this place to anyone who enjoys a flavorful burger.

In the future i'd like to try the veggie fries and add garlic mushrooms to the Sin City and Baja burgers.",7A7FOLZZKL0iokQVOAEbgA,1,1,5,FztxIO_ExajiClG-5IPyeQ

Sin City Smashburger: fried egg, applewood smoked bacon, american cheese, grilled onions, haystack onions and their own ""smash sauce"" on an egg bun.

- I saw ""egg"" with burger and I didn't have to read any further. I ordered the 1/2 pounder. Pretty Damn Tasty and Salty might I add. The buns were nice and fluffy yet not too soft, bacon was ordinary (I didn't really notice much apple smoked flavor), medley of onions were great, their ""Smash"" sauce was green and creamy (not bad) and the meat was Juicy and Salty. I prefer less salt on anything I eat but the saltiness in this burger was obvious but wasn't tongue blistering salty. Overall, Still A Very Good Burger

Smashfries: tossed with rosemary, olive oil and garlic.

- ingredients sounded fun and it defintely was! Nice alternate from the usual ordinary french fries! Decent portion too!

I said in my first review that I would rather go to Red Robin.  Well, just kidding!  Red Robin makes me run to the bathroom after eating there.  (TMI?  whatevs!)

Their egg bun is a perfect compliment to a burger that is ""homemade"".  What I mean, is that it is not perfectly round or square, it looks homemade and tastes delicious.

I wasn't a fan of the rosemary, garlic, olive oil on the fries, but I have become a fan.  I now am a fan of the sweet potatoe smashfries.  yum!

My husband and I came here before the UNLV Basketball and were in and out within 20 minutes and got 2 burgers, 2 fries and 2 pop's (soda's for you west-coasters) and the total came to: $19.49.  Can you beat that for a good burger that is not coming from a fast food chain?

The crew here all know us by now, and it's gotten to the point that if they aren't that busy, and they see us parking and getting out of our car, they already start on our order before we even get inside! Many times as soon as we have sat down with our drinks, our food is ready for us. Talk about service! Our order is always the same, but they know our special modifications, and I can't remember them ever getting it wrong. I even started asking them for just one side of dressing for my salad since I only use one and felt bad about them wasting the other, and now they even remember to only give me one side of dressing.

Speaking of their salads, they're actually quite good, and the grilled chicken is always moist and tender, and I don't even like chicken all that much, and esp not chicken breast! Whatever they do to their chicken, it's good. And the chicken sandwiches are a much healthier alternative to the burgers and yes they are filling and satisfying. According to their website, the salads and sandwiches with grilled chicken clock in at about 500-600 cals.

It's a thin piece of smashed meat.  I tried the burger once and since I like my burgers thick and juicy, not thin and fried, it just wasn't doing it for me.

However, I did recently come back to try the smashchicken and that actually is pretty good.  I went with the crispy avocado club.  The bacon is pretty tasty and I got it with guacamole instead of avocado which gave it a little more spice.  Their guacamole is a little too tangy for me, but the crispy chicken had a good texture and was juicy despite being smashed. The multi-grain bun it comes with tasted pretty fresh.

I avoid the smashfries because they tend to put too much of the olive oil, garlic, and rosemary seasoning on them, making it a puddle of olive oil with some fries in it.  Save a few hundred calories and just get the regular fries.

Service here tends to be slow.  It takes a long time to place an order.  I don't know if that has something to do with the customers because once I get to the front of the line to place my order, it goes pretty quick.

I find it ironic that Bachi Burger and Smashburger located basically kitty corner too one another. I had too go with the Sin City Burger because who would not love burger with fried egg?? I did leave out the grilled onion so not true Sin City Burger. It came with great recommendation from roommate regular. Really two type of onions probably pinch much with everything else going on in the burger. The burger itself was cooked too perfection (the smashburger style) nice moist and juicy on the inside. The bun itself was great! The haystack onions, bacon, fried egg, cheese, and sauce all perfect compliments. They cook their fried egg not so loose missing some of that egg yolk goodness makes fried egg on burger. Still overall solid burger one that would order again and again. The Smash fries had nice flavor with the garlic and rosemary oil. Everything is prepared too order so may take time but well worth the short wait knowing everything comes out HOT. 

There other things on the menu at Smashburger from chicken sandwiches too vegan options black bean burgers. If all else fails build your own burger too your taste. It  very reasonable price and filling. You order at the counter then find place sit and bring food out too you. The staff is really friendly and great service all around.

On my occasional sojourn towards the Western hemisphere of Sin City, I have a list of places where I want to eat to review, but about the time I've reached the front doors of those yet-to-be-ventured dining establishments I scrap it, turn myself around and go to Smashburger- the best brick and mortar burger joint in town.

Now that consuming Burgers has virtually become a weekly event for me, I've decided to embrace my vices and dive in deep....real deep.  There and only there, will you find Smashburger; the mother load of decadence and flavor, your hands will smell of burger grease, onions and cheese for days.

Smashburger: Smash. Sizzle. Savor.  Catchy right?  Well, to be honest, they deliver a pretty amazing burger: the quality of meat is there (Angus Beef Meatball) which is smashed on the grill (giving it it's imperfect shape) sprinkled with heavenly Smash seasoning while on the grill which is then placed on top of a Butter Toasted Egg Bun.

I have only ordered one Burger here, the Sin City: The Smash Size (1/3 lbs.) + Fried Egg + Applewood Smoked Bacon + American Cheese + Grilled Onions + Haystack Onions + Smash Sauce on an Egg Bun.  And it will probably be the only Smashburger I will ever order, it is perfection! There's just an overload of flavors, the juiciest Burger that you will ever encounter; the rich Egg and Cheese proteins just coats your mouth like no other, the combo of Grilled and Haystack Fried Onions is a double punch of decadence - it's a flavor windfall with each bite.

As for Fries, I'm partial to Smash's Signature: Fries (well cooked) tossed with Rosemary + Olive Oil and Garlic.  I like the Italian twist that Smash offers, and since I can't find that anywhere in a fast food establishment, I get it every time. (they Sweet Potato Smash Fries are yummy too!)

By the time you're almost finished, you're hands and mouth are coated with a glorious glistening of rendered oil, and with an almost animal like post-mortem, you're overcome with a sense of calm satisfaction, like a pack of lions that have finished masticating a helpless (yet yummy) antelope. (calm down PETA- I'm too insignificant to be in the crosshairs of your bitter venom..)

Suffice it to say, Smashburger has the best burger in town and the reason why I go to the other side to get my fix?  Because if I start going the one closer to where I live, I would be there every day and be 400 lb. (worth every pound)

Luckily i didn't fall, but my eyes were drawn to every inch of the floor and it was greasy, dirty, food all over. I walked all around the restaurant floor except the bathrooms and employee area. They are asking for slips & falls because their staff doesn't take cleaning their floors seriously. It disgusted me. It also scared me bc I almost fell and my husband had fallen and hurt himself badly due to the same conditions. I had to walk very cautiously through the restaurant bc i was afraid to slip on their nasty floors. I know some of the staff are young and they may dismiss mopping the floors. I get it, I worked at INNOUT burger in my youth. But clean floors is a SAFETY issue. Plus, if you keep your restaurant this dirty- what does your kitchen look like? I know it's just a burger joint, but the staff should take some pride in their work. Be the best employee you can be, not for the sake of your company or career but for yourself.

Also, if you want to try something different, get the fried pickles. I hate pickles, but fried ones taste pretty good. The boyfriend had the Cobb salad with crispy chicken and liked it a lot.

We both ordered the Bacon Cheese Burger and Smash fries. 

The burger- was epic, flavorful, and did not taste like a typical pre-made frozen patty, it was tender like a home-made burger.

The fries- had some awesome flavors going on, I think they might have had oregano and rosemary on them, delicious!

Positives: Our waitress/cashier was INCREDIBLE, she was so beyond sweet, polite kind, completely amazing. We came in on 2/21/2016 and I didnt get her name but seriously this girl was so nice. She earned them a star! 

The soda was good to but thats probably cause they don't make it.

Nobody batted an eye at me breastfeeding which is always a huge positive in my book.

Negatives: Kitchen Staff were insanely LOUD. Like to the point my fiance and I couldnt hold a decent conversation with out hearing what sounded like a group of cackling hyenas in the kitchen. 

My burger (Jalapeno Baja) comes with guac, I kid you not I got like Half a teaspoon of gauc on my burger. I would of rather paid $1.80 (Like I do at Chipotle) and ACTUALLY get guac. Seriously.

My fries were the Buffalo fries and I'm pretty damn sure they used an entire container of salt on them. I order these fries every single time I go to Smashburger, and never, I repeat NEVER had this issue. I coated them in ranch (Which if it wasnt for our wonderful waitress, the kitchen would of forgot to put on the tray) and still barely got them down. Not to mention every single one of my fries were like 1 1/2 inches long.. 

My fiance liked his burger, he gets the BBQ bacon Cheddar nearly every time we go. His fries were the smash fries and literally there was SO much oil on them that every time he took a bit they would spurt little spurts of oil into his mouth. I tried one and nearly gagged at the oil, there has never been THAT much on them before. At least they werent over salted.

Both burgers were luke warm despite coming out of the kitchen right away.

They get 2 stars, if it wasnt for our awesome waitress they'd only have one. The atmosphere is very dull, they need music or something... i dont know. We most likely will not being coming back to this location, which is sad because we live right down the road.

I will note we did not complain because A. We had my 9 month old and did not want it to be an issue, B.

As soon as we walked in, we were greeted by the cashier.  With our dumbfounded look on our faces staring at the menu (as if we didn't know what was on a burger joint's menu), the cashier said, ""Is this your first time here?""  YES!!!  So we continued to stare at the menu for another 4-5 minutes.  It's amazing how stupid we get when we go to order a burger!

Anyway, burger joints in Vegas are getting a little outrageous, don't you think?  They're as played out as old underwear. I proclaim there's roughly 7 categories of burger joints: 
1. fast food burger joints (McDonald's, Burger King)
2. Asian burger joints (Bachi, Fuku)
3. burger joints on wheels (Slidin' Thru)
4. burger bar joints (Kilroy's, Grind)
5. tourist trap burger joints (Strip Burger, Holsteins)
6. gourmet burger joints (KGB, Bachi)
7. give me a damn burger without the preservatives joints (Elevation, Fuddruckers)

Well, Smashburger is in the #7 category.  It's a good all-around burger that is cooked to order.  It sort of reminds me of Elevation and Steak N Shake because the meat is similar to ground steak.  The standard bun is the the egg bun, wholesome and delicious.  Other bun varieties are available, though I have not tried them yet. Toppings are well proportioned and fresh.  I opted for grilled onions and ketchup.  Of course, there are tons of other toppings available for all of you who want a whole salad bar between your bun.  The cheese is well proportioned as well.  I chose American and would recommend it to others however, for the more adventurous there's swiss, bleu, cheddar, feta, goat, and pepperjack.  Who wants a goat on their burger, ewe!  ""May I get goat on my burger?""  LOL, sorry.

Smashburger is clean inside and has a modern yet cozy decor.  Orders are taken at the register where you are given a number.  Then, the food is brought to your table.  If you're really hungry, don't get your panties in a bunch because the food is cooked to order and takes about 10 minutes.  Each table is stocked with napkins for the sloppy (like my hubby), Heinz ketchup, and mustard bottles (good for people like me who like to secretly douse ketchup all over my food).  Sodas are self-serve with Coke products.  And of course they offer milkshakes (didn't try, on a diet at a burger joint).  

Smashburger is a good, reasonably cheap, #7 burger joint.",g89D3f_9GnTzHPNoxIpuKQ,3,1,4,jFFEvbA6aSrSrL5e3v3EuQ

It's kind of sad because I wanted to love Smashburger. It's conveniently located near my house, and the promise of the restaurant was great, but the execution didn't meet my expectations.

The first time I went there was a couple of months ago. I created my own 1/3 pound burger with bacon, pepper jack cheese, spicy chipotle bun, spicy chipotle sauce, and some jalapenos. It bought the heat! It was extremely spicy, but man, it was so delicious. It really hit the spot after seeing a movie across the street at village square. Their smashfries were delicious too; they were smothered in oil, rosemary, and garlic for a crisp and tasty bite. 

I came back a couple days ago, and I wanted to try something new, so I ordered  the barbecue ranch smashchicken, and I hated it. Why would I spend $6 on this burger, when I could have gotten either some spicy chicken sandwiches from mcdonalds, or one of arby's chicken sandwiches for far less money for the same ingredients and quality. It was so plain and mediocre. The lettuce and tomato did nothing for the sandwich, and the person that made it put so much sauce on it that it was over powering the rest of the flavors and dripping out of the bun. Needless to say, I wasn't pleased.

My advice for you, if you want to try smashburger, is to stick with a burger. The chicken is plain, and you can get the same thing from other fast food restaurants for cheaper prices.",-zWAApe_-ZLX5HfyAsaLQg,1,1,3,Bk895FAVN-ZRlZAiM5cLjQ

This Denver chain is growing in the Vegas Valley and there is good reason why.  They begin with fresh, not-frozen, 100% certified Angus beef that's literally smashed on a buttered grill for ten seconds with a cookie-cutter-style press. This searing process locks in the juices, and then the meat patty is seasoned with Smashburger's garlic and herb mix. Put it on a soft, delicious Artisan-style bun and add the extras to order. The end result? A five-napkin burger that tastes as good or better than homemade. Ready to eat in about six minutes. How can you beat that? 

There's several variations on the Smashburger theme: the Classic, the All American, the Sin City Smashburger, the BBQ Bacon and Cheese, the Spicy Baja and the Mushroom Swiss. Or make your own from a combination of the menu-item ingredients. The best part? Fresh ingredients, not frozen. The veggies aren't pre-packaged; they're cut on site. The seasonings and sauces are Smashburger's proprietary recipes. This is high-quality, cooked-to-order fast food. 

What's a burger without fries? Smashfries are of the retro, shoestring style. They're deep-fat fried in tallow and oil, mixed with rosemary, extra virgin olive oil and garlic. The Sweet Potato Smashfries are made the same way, crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. There's also the Chili, Cheese or combination Chili-Cheese Fries. Veggie Frites is a yummy, albiet greasy, fries substitute: a slightly-crunchy combination of flash-fried asparagus, carrot sticks and green beans. Another notable side is the tasty fried dill pickles served with a creamy buttermilk ranch dressing.

And what's a burger and fries without a shake? Take your pick of a vanilla, chocolate or strawberry shake or malt with the consistency of soft-serve, blended with whole milk and Haagen-Daz ice cream. The tangy fresh lime shake was not-too-sweet, and the classic root beer float could double for dessert.",EWQil1sWe23p9uoEU5AZlg,0,0,4,G1RduEUDyyIDzzxrlF7z3w

The circumstances are really quite simple. Rex believes that what a man does in someone else's dumpster is his own business.  Picture this...Rex goes to his favorite ""single wide"" (dumpster to the uninformed) and finds...and you won't believe this...trash in it. Philistines! So Rex removed it. He sits down with a can of happy juice (ammonia, gasoline (leaded), two moth balls, three mentos, a tic tac and 6 toe nail clippings that have been buried in the desert for 2 weeks) and a 3 year old copy of ""Giant White Butts""...like most men do on a Thursday...Tuesday...some night. Whatever. Well, suddenly after half a bottle of happy juice rex saw 3 blue men. They yelled. They grabbed at Rex. Next...what happens...is not totally clear...but ALLEDGEDLY...a naked Rex (a beautiful sight)...holding a top hat and stapler jumped out past the blue men and ran down the street straight into a wall. The wall stopped Rex's run. Rex awoke to a single padded room against his will. 

The first thing Rex needs outside of lock up is food.  After a ride from 4 kids out on a joy ride Rex found himself in front of Smashburger.  This was not the first time Rex has sauntered...sashayed...glided into Smashburger. Rex will tell you the first time he went, the second time and the third time he was underwhelmed.  Decent food, expensive food, not Rex's idea of a value.

Today was Rex's fourth time. Was it different? Did he like it? Was he allowed to leave after screaming ""This is the kind of place that the Nazi's would have opened if they won the war!""?  The answer to all of these is...no. Not at all.

Where to begin...wherever to begin?  The first thing Rex tried was the namesake of his town. The Sin City Burger. A good burger, and honestly, the best burger on their menu...when done right. They put a fried egg on top and if the fried egg is cooked too hard and the yolk doesn't come out...the burger isn't the same. Two burgers. Two different cooked eggs. The yolk makes a bit of  a sauce, and much needed sauce.  The Spicy Baja is just not spicy. Sorry. Rex understands the underdeveloped palate, and my favorite HO Third Eye Sally has half a tongue and isn't medically allowed to eat spicy food because of medical conditions...didn't find it spicy. The Mushroom Swiss burger has mayo on it when a better sauce would really make the burger.  Chicken sandwich you ask?  They have them. They are hit and miss. The Buffalo, miss...because the sauce isn't good. The BBQ ranch, miss...because BBQ isn't good. The Avocado Club, hit. 

What about the fries? The hallmark of any good burger joint...well...hit and miss again. Just like when Rex is asked to hit her belly...(but Rex misses on purpose).  Two times Rex went he got the regular fries. Two times the Smashfries. The Smashfries the first time were great. The second time the rosemary and garlic seemed liked it was burned. It has a bitter taste. The regular fries were just that, regular.  Third Eye let me have some of her Chili Cheese Fries and they are pretty good. The best of the bunch.

The bottom line is that this not a great burger place because the quality control isn't good. This is the type of food that needs to be done right. Sadly, it isn't. Somehow in the 200+ times Rex has eaten at In And Out he has never had a bad meal. One 1 out of 4 times did Rex have a good meal at Smashburger. Oh, and if you complain...no one cares. Just like when you complain to Rex. Only difference is you complain to a person at Smashburger...you complain to the memories of Rex.

The burgers are decent, and the side choices are not the run of the mill fries or onion rings. We had fried pickles and sweet potato fries. It can get a little pricey depending on what you order. I wish I had realized they serve beer but good to know for future reference.
The mood was really mellow in the dining room, which is not really what you'd expect from a place that has a giant red ""smash"" painted on the wall. The music was way too low key. And at least two of the cashier/servers were chewing gum while working. Personal pet peeve.

The restaurant was very clean, the employees were very nice and checked up on us multiple times during our visit.

They asked if it was my first time there as I gazed upon the large menu to the right of the counter. They offered tips, suggestions, and successfully guided me in selecting my big Sin City Burger and side of Smash Fries with a fountain drink. I did think it was interesting that they had $1 cans of PBR and other brands that came with a frosty mug available with the purchase of any food item. They gave me my order number and instructed me to sign up on their website in order to receive a free burger on my next visit.

When my burger was brought out to me my eyes were immediately drawn to the egg bun. It appeared fresh, fluffy, and had a wonderful golden yellow color to it that made me want to grab it and take a bite. The burger was topped with fried egg, bacon, American cheese, grilled onion and haystack onions. Upon mastication I was sold! The burger was phenomenal. I tend to cherish any burger that involves egg, but this one in particular was choice. One issue I had which could easily be remedied my following visit, would be to ask for no grilled onions. It already included haystack onions (aka shoestring onions) and the addition of grilled onions seemed to overpower the sandwich. Also, they would not allow me to order my egg to be 'runny', they make them only one way. Through ordering the bigger version of the sandwich I noticed the meat patty itself was much larger than the bun which lead me to believe their buns only come in one size (no joke intended). The Smash Fries were simply regular thin cut french fries with rosemary, garlic and olive oil over them. A nice and welcome spin on what would have been an ordinary order of fries.

One of the coworkers I was there with had ordered a 'create-your-own-burger' and the cooks had neglected to put bacon on the burger he had ordered and paid for. Upon notifying the staff, they quickly amended the problem and gave him a coupon for a free burger the next time he came in. A very nice gesture.

All in all, my lunch was a success. I was very satisfied with my meal and I look forward to returning for my free burger! I think it is safe to say I will become a regular at this chain burger joint.",pzMvoRhpuwwC3jHZtZSCeg,3,1,4,pX4dvzgFRkUZjlDYqD1jpQ

The bun was kind of uniquely sweet (in a good way) and the lettuce, tomato, and onion all looked very fresh and tasty.

-Baja Burger (very good, the way the patty is smashed made it quite tender, and crispy on the edges)
-Beefy Chili (was yummy, Tobasco would have made it super yummy)
-Sweet potatoes fries tossed in olive oil, rosemary (was a little burnt, and the olive oil and rosemary was not a good match, to me at least)
-Haagan Daz Caramel Shake (taste like plain vanilla, they might have made this wrong!)

This was the first time for me at this Smashburger location.  It was around lunch-time and it was busy.  They give you a number after you order, then bring your food out to you.  I just left the gym and wasn't in a hurry, which was a good thing because it took almost 20 minutes to get my order.  The good thing about that is that the food is prepared fresh, the bad thing is that it's not convenient if you're in a hurry.

The first item I tried was the Baja Burger....yum, it was tasty!  I could taste the spicy heat from the fresh Jalapenos.  All of the ingredients gave this Burger a unique flavor to it.  I like.

Next I tried a few of the Fried Pickles....yuck, they failed on this one.  The Pickles were soft and chewy.....when they're served fried like this, the breading should have a slightly crispy texture to it with the Pickle on the inside providing the soft/chewy part.  Plus they were very greasy.....all of these factors usually means the temperature on the fryer is too low.  Needless to say, I didn't finish my order.

Next up was the Chicago Dog.....I like how they split the Hot Dog in half so that it holds the toppings better.  I really enjoyed the Chicago Dog....they did it right and put together a proper Chicago Dog.

Overall, it was a pretty good meal despite the fail on the Fried Pickles.  I didn't need the calories anyway.

Will I return?  Probably, but not during the lunch rush hour.",QJI9OSEn6ujRCtrX06vs1w,16,13,4,mLDc4TrAqwexnP5NULK7kg

I looked at the online menu and then went to this location which is near where I live.  I got the avocado club hamburger for myself and the truffle mushroom burger for my wife.  After finding out what Smash fries were, I got an order for each of us.

Sarah was the woman running the register last night and she was good answering my questions.  I'm sure she could tell it was my first time there.  She told me to have a seat and she'd bring the to go order as soon as it was ready.  In about 5 minutes, the order was ready.  Since there was no one else in the restaurant, I knew it was mine.

A short drive home and we were enjoying the hamburgers.  They were good for a change.  They are somewhere in the middle between normal fast food hamburger chains and the upscale hamburger shops which have sprung up around Las Vegas.  The fries were good.

I checked in this place out the other night.. It was empty.  I was hungry and wanted to treat myself to something nice, like a burger or something.
So i order and ate and it didn't go as well as i planned.

The Sin City Smashburger with the fried nonyolky egg was lousy ;however, the bacon in it was good.  Then again I hadn't had bacon in a long, long time.  I mean the patty itself was decent, but the burger as the whole was just awful. And what's with all the onion crap on it?  It doesn't help!
The Smashfries with rosemary, olive oil, and garlic was crap too.  I guess this was my fault since i wanted to be more adventurous, but had i known I'd be eating shit i would have skipped it.  Ketchup didn't help either.  I took a few bites before they went limp on me.  

Oh, and your strawberry milkshake sucks too.  Why does it taste, i dunno, malty?  The aftertaste had this bitty-sourness to it.  I don't know what it is, but of all the milkshake i ever had in my life my taste bud did not hit it off with this one.

Service was nice.  Probably because they don't get many visitors, so it's a treat for them to see an outside form of life entering their premises.

I was lucky enough to receive a bogo coupon in my local zip code magazine for SmashBurger and the night was nice so i took a cruise and headed to the spot. Upon arrival the service was nice, and the location was very clean and managed. 
I ordered a Sin City SmashBurger which as others have mentioned have the fried egg, crispy onions, and this tasty bun going on along with the smash fries. When it arrived the presentation was solid and i was all about it digging into the fries first i was into them and they have alot of flavor but they were a bit too oily for my taste but still very good. i knew my burger had potential before the first bite when i found ""cheese paper"" you know the overflow cheese that sticks to the burger wrapper that you pick off with your finger nail and eat... yes and it was good cheese. i bit into it and was taken by surprise that it was actually this good, the egg, cheese, and crunchy onion combination just worked for me. The only think i could have asked for which ill do next time is ask that they do not fry the egg to completion and serve it sunny side up with a runny yolk i think that will be the icing on the burger. The bun is yummy, and for the ones who commented that a bun needs to be toasted?? thats a personal preference as i prefer them soft thank you so im glad they didnt do this. Its not totally what im use to with a burger as the patty was very flat, kind of thin actually as im guessing thats what the smash of smash burger is but in the end it all just kind of worked. For the price i think they are right on, and with a bogo coupon you are eating well on the cheap for sure so keep a look out for those in your mailers.

GREAT Burgers!! Excellent selection of Sides & Fantastic Shakes!!!

1st time out I had to try the Mushroom+Swiss Burger which was OVER the TOP good, 2nd time I had to go for the BAJA Burger which was great as well.

The burgers remind me alot of Fuddruckers with a great selection of fresh toppings but the sides are unique and quite incredible especially the pickle chips and veggie frites.

BEEFY CHILI IS THE BOMB!!!!!!!

Since this location is right across the street from the Village Square Cinemas its a good spot to fill up before seeing a movie instead of paying $12 for a popcorn & soda :)

I also come here whenever I have a hankering for fried pickles. Now these are a really good unusual treat. - I love them. 

Since I can't eat beef I can't vouch for the burgers, however the chicken burger is great. I ordered an Avocado Club that consists of Multigrain Bread,

Decent sandwiches and great fries in an unmemorable atmoshphere is just enough reason to give this place a try. One major pro are the variety of toppings, breads, and dressings gives the customer the opportunity to be creative. I like their spicy baja chicken sandwich the best. The sandwich was delicious and had the right balance of spicy and salty flavors. However, I recommend saying no to the spicy mayo because it's just another layer of unnecessary greasy salty mess. Their black bean burger was a disappointing mushy hockey puck. The more I bit into the sandwich, the patty began to fall apart. But for me, the  sides are the super stars here. I love their fries. They're crispy, hot and flavorful. I am willing to squeeze an extra hour at the gym to order a heaping plate of chili cheese fries.

Got the sin city burger with smash fries this time.  The burger was decent, the onions were grilled nicely and had a lot of flavor but for some reason the burger just wasn't satisfying.   

The smash fries were way too weak on the garlic and it was extremely greasy.  There was an actual puddle oil/grease at the bottom which was pretty disgusting.

Overall, I left with a gross oily after taste and will probably be burping up grease for the rest of the night.

4744359,2010-08-28,2,diY31IEunbV8MfDh81FS1A,"I'm still trying to feel out Smashburger.  The first time I went there, I had the Spicy Baja (pepper jack cheese, guacamole, lettuce, tomato, onion, chipotle mayo, jalapenos, chipotle bun).  The guacamole was the dominant flavor (which probably hid any spiciness that was there), with everything else blending together that in the end made for a burger with a flavor crisis.  I also had the Smashfries (tossed with rosemary, olive oil and garlic), which didn't leave much of an impression on me.  Fries with a very mild garlic flavor, nothing special.  After that meal I didn't really feel the urge to go back.

Until tonight.  Why did I end up here?  I really, really wanted a tasty burger; Smashburger was my second choice.  My first choice was Slider Truck behind Yogurtland with a really long line despite only being there for 20 minutes.  Me being hungry and not wanting to wait in line, I headed down Fort Apache to this Smashburger.  This time I had the 1/2 lb Sin City Smashburger ($6.99, fried egg, bacon, American cheese, grilled onions, haystack onions, smash sauce, egg bun), no fries.  So with this experience, it was out with the guac and in with the salt.  Not to the point that makes it inedible, but enough to keep it noticeable as you keep eating.  The fried egg and onions definitely led to a good combination of flavors that satisfied my burger needs.

Would I come back here?  I would, but I wouldn't go back for the two burgers I've already had.  Hopefully I can find a burger that is a bit more balanced with the toppings, since the beef is good.  Three stars until I find that burger.

Pros: Food made quickly, none of the locations was very busy.

Cons: The burgers are quite small. I brought this up and they told me some story about how they're smashed so it's the real weight or something I didn't understand, all I know is the patties are super thin and not very big/filling. The menu is very confusing, just imagine the opposite of the In-n-Out menu and that's Smashburger, a bunch of different screens that don't actually explain anything and it all seems the same. The burgers are overpriced, they're charging Five Guy's type prices but offering 1/2 the meat and 1/4 of the taste.

1/3 lb burger
chipotle bun
chipotle sauce (mayo?)
lettuce
tomato
onion
fried egg
pepperjack cheese

the patty for my burger was flavorless... but everything else on the burger made it better. my dining companion ate the other half of my burger and realized my patty had probably been left out for a while. he said it wasn't up to the standard he had when he first tried smashburger. darn. i came right before a big rush so maybe my patty was leftover from the last rush? it was around 12:45ish..... 

the sweet potato fries were yum! 

anyway.. the service while ordering was okay.. and food came out in a timely manner. and it was hot. 

one strange thing i noticed was the soda machine was placed in a poorly though out location. not only is it next to the restroom (gross!).. it's on the opposite side of the restaurant from the register. so you have to order.. get your soda then backtrack to the dining area. the dining area and the soda machine are separated by a short wall which makes the space to get soda very tight. if you walk in through the back door... you have to squeeze by the people who are waiting to get the soda.

We ordered:
The Classic Smash $4.99- my boyfriend said it was just OK.. I think he left a bite unfinished..
Truffle Mushroom Swiss $5.99- I got it low carb wrapped in lettuce... Except it wasn't wrapped in lettuce.. it had a small piece of lettuce on the bottom and it just looked so sad and lonely HAHA I think In'NOut & Carl's Jr. do the protein style way better..
Spinach & Goat Cheese Salad with chicken $7.99- I thought the salad was delicious! Very fresh ingredients and the best salad I've had at a fast food joint.. good portion.. we had to take half of it home. 
Smash Fries $1.99- I liked the flavor combo of olive oil & rosemary on the fries!
Fried Pickles $2.29- These were really good especially with the ranch.. I couldn't eat more than a couple bites though 
Root Beer $1.50- Came with an ice cold mug.. very refreshing! 

Overall,  I think the burgers are not something I would crave or go out of my way to get.. The patties just weren't that great and left something more to be desired.. I would come back for the yummy salad though but at $7.99 a salad bar seems like a better option!

I also ordered smash fries and a salted caramel shake. Both were amazing.

1. You can get it on a whole wheat bun.
2. You can top it with just about anything you want.
3. It is smashed super thin, and I like a nice, thin chicken breast sammie. 

Despite being thin, the sandwich is still quite filling, so most of the time, I don't need any sides to have a fulfilling lunch. However, they do offer some creative sides, including sweet potato fries with rosemary and fried veggie sticks. It's actually fun to choose your side because the options are not ordinary. 

It's a burger spot that has something for everyone, even those who don't want a burger, and even those that want a salad. I find the service as this location to be especially friendly and attentive.

Sin City Burger (1/3 lb, $5.99) - american cheese, fried egg, bacon, onions (I requested none), and smash sauce (on the side). I can't comment on the bun as I ate this bad boy bunless. The bacon was a bit soggy for my taste (I like crisp bacon), but the egg was PERFECT, and the meat was delicious. Salty, yes, but I can handle that ! Smash sauce wasn't anything special (mayo, mustard and sweet relish), but I snagged some of my coworker's chipotle mayo and that was slammin. When served bunless you don't get a lettuce wrap, which is fine, but would have been a nice touch. 

Veggie Frites ($2.99) - HELL YES. A low carb french fry substitute!! So happy! Carrots, asparagus, and green beans flash fried in oil. Sadly they were a little limp (maybe they could bake them instead to give them more of a satisfying ""crunch?""), but I'd still order them again. It's pleasing when companies think outside the potato!!

On October 8 2017, I decided that i would go to Smash Burger and grab dinner for myself and my family as I had a 25 dollar gift card that I received for my birthday two weeks prior. Upon entering the establishment, I was greeted by the staff who took my order. I ordered a Sin City Burger, a chicken club, and two double triple or triple double burgers ( not sure of the name) with fries, to go.

Upon bringing my food home, myself and my family began to eat the food, only to find that each of the sandwiches we're so salty it was like eating a salt lick. As the food was inedible, I ended up throwing the sandwiches away, and was forced to was money on a pizza that I did not want to purchase. 

Later on that night I completed the review on the company website, where I had informed them of the issue. The next day I receive an e-mail from Smash Burger's Market Captain, Joesph Zappala, apologizing for the overly salted food and promising to rectify the mistake if I sent an e-mail with my home address back to him, to which I did.

I am person who is patient and is willing to give a business a second chance if they had only kept their word.

In my last post I raved about this place.  I haven't been back in a while, but I went today for lunch and was highly disappointed. 

The service was terrible. The guy taking our order wasn't friendly. He actually asked if we would be ok if someone behind us could go in front of us. The guy who was busing wasn't friendly. He was trying to carry too many plates and dropped some and was unhappy with himself. The girl bringing out food was fairly rude. She asked if we needed anything else. I asked for more of the haystack onion sauce. She brought me some mayo then I didn't see her again after that. She also refused to make eye contact. 

Now if the service was terrible, but the food was delicious as always I could say oh well bad day. The food was no good. My haystack onions were about half the size as I have had every other time I've been here. They were so greasy it was disgusting. The bottom third was just crumbs, so I couldn't even eat it. The burger was basically flavorless. 

I was so disappointed I had to write an updated review. I will give it another try to see if maybe today was an off day, but wow no more raving for me :/",GSTf4SKV1HjZBfWFapea0Q,0,0,3,cMKufaMkzkYxZJ5pq2lp5w

I had to go to the counter and ask the manager where my food was and that i had been waiting for 30 mins for TO GO, She went to the window and grabbed a bag under the heating lamps. Why ask my name when you dont call it when my food is ready? She wasn't apologetic i had to wait that long either! My fries werent that good after 30 mins.
Another time i got the chicken sandwich and ate almost all of it then realized it was pink inside! I was not too happy. lucky i didnt get sick! I have learned from that and i cut in my chicken whether its in the salad or my smash chicken! Dont bother to do the surveys if you have a legit complaint *my raw chicken* No one ever contacts you. Although you do get a free side during your next visit. Maybe do the survey but if you have a complaint don't expect someone to call and see what was wrong.
Also i dont like the menu change! You used to be able to add any cheese to your burger or chicken at no charge.

I had the Classic Smashburger and sweet potato fries. The burger itself was very tasty, juicy and flavorful. The crisp pickles were great along with the leaf lettuce. I like the sauce as well, sort of similar to In-n-out's secret sauce. My only complaint was that by the time I got it back to my office to eat it, the bun had soaked up so much juice it left it mushy. The fries were casualties as well, limp greasy potatoes. The rosemary and garlic seemed to overpower the sweet potato fries, but it may have been more because of the lack of crispiness that left a bad taste in my mouth.

Upon arrival, the lady just looked at me, walked away and didn't greet me at all. After a few minutes of just waiting at the register, she finally came over and said ""Alright."" (Not even a proper greeting such as ""Hi there what would you like to order?"") and stared at me until I gave my order. I was a little taken aback at her lack of customer service but just ignored it and preceded with my order. 

I was excited to try the Black Bean burger patty that they offer so I got that as a large Classic Smash. That excitement went away with my first bite - I didn't expect the patty to be so mushy and lack any ""bite"" to it; it barely felt like I was eating a burger at all. I was disappointed since the classic smash used to be my favorite when I used to eat meat but this was a disappointment. I wish they would come out with a veggie patty in the future and possibly vegan options. 

I did appreciate the fact that they upgraded my Smash fries to a large even though I paid for a small but that was the only best thing of the meal last night.

I joined the Smashburger club via their website and in return they emailed me a voucher for a free entree. Hell yeah a free burger of my choice sounds like a great time to give them a try! I did not have to manually print the coupon they accepted it via looking at and deleting the email from my phone.

I am glad we did as I was very happy and satisfied with my meal! The service is Amazing as well, all of the employees so helpful and sweet always checking on us to make sure everything is perfect! Andy and the crew at this location kick ass!!! 

They were even patient with me while I stood at the counter trying to decide what I wanted to order as the menu is neat how you can add stuff on to your burger. They have their own creations and they have the option to create your own burger or chicken burger. Lots of free toppings! Mmmmmm yum!

I decided on the ""Classic"" and decided on the ""big smash"" size which is 1/2 pound Angus burger. Includes American cheese, lettuce, tomato, ketchup, onion, pickles and smash sauce on an artisan egg bun. I added sweet relish and extra purple onion as a free add on. The sweet relish on my burger was divine, it just took the flavor and taste to a whole new level. Reminds me of when I was a kid and would order a burger from an old school diner my Mom would take me to in San Diego, CA, they put sweet relish on their burgers, I will never forget how good it was! Thank you for the trip back in time and fond memory Smashburger! :)

My boyfriend ordered the ""Spicy Baja"" which includes pepper jack cheese, guacamole, lettuce, tomato, onion, spicy chipotle mayo, fresh jalapenos on a spicy chipotle bun. He added for .75 more fried pickles on the side and haystack onions to his burger. He really enjoyed his burger, his only complaint was that the meat patty is smashed out further than the bun. I said babe it is called ""Smashburger"" lol That is what I liked is that the meat patty was bigger than the bun, I enjoyed that meat hanging out on the sides mmmmm yum!

The Angus beef so juicy, flavorful and literally was running down my mouth and chin. They make a messy burger and they have plenty of napkins available on the tables. If a burger is not messy then it is not a well made burger!

We also ordered smashfries to share which are tossed with rosemary, olive oil and garlic, mmmm delicious as well.

This was truly a treat for our lunch today! I enjoyed it very much along with the Outstanding service we received from Andy and the crew!

We will be back! They have a burger worth sucking silly and I want to do it again!

Our total for two burgers, two drinks and fries was $25 after my coupon for my free burger it brought it down to $18. Had a great lunch, tried a new place and saved some money! WIN WIN WIN!

Thank you for the happy ending Smashburger, my tummy thanks you! :)",deL6e_z9xqZTIODKqnvRXQ,7,7,4,FI5CCSjP57Zy9AGZxOsVKg

Not a bad burger joint at all.  

After a nice little hike at Red Rocks, Killer was craving was some red meat and claimed that if I didn't take her to a burger joint soon, that she'd be taking a chunk out of ME.

Well, seeing as how I'm rather fond of all my attached parts, I decided to find her a burger joint close to Red Rocks - PRONTO.

We looked at our trusty Yelp app and it pointed us down Lake Mead to a place called ""Create"" , but after zooming up and down Lake Mead for several minutes and failing to find Create, I was lucky enough to spot Smashburger before I lost a limb. 

Tried out the BIG ""Sin City"" burger which had a single 1/3/lb patty, applewood smoked bacon, fried egg, fried onion strings, grilled onions and their special sauce on a multi-grain bun and it wasn't bad.  better than the average fast food burger (but I still miss Kilroy's) - it was a bit salty though, so it definitely could've used a sweet component in the burger. 

The smash fries were perfectly crisp and well seasoned with olive oil and rosemary

I actually like how the restaurant is laid out.  The entrance flows straight to the registers and through to either the indoor dining area or the outdoor patio.

From what I remember, the service was good.  The menu is not that overly complicated.  Build your own or pick a combo.  Pretty simple.  If you can't figure that out, stick with McyD's.  

The food was great, very juicy & the meat was mildly seasoned with salt and pepper.  It didn't detract from the bun, cheese or additions.  The price is a little more than you'd pay at the 'other' burger joints.  But the quality is noticeably superior.  (IE: You get what you pay for.)",wfx2G50lMeSK_kqcQqP0lw,1,2,4,ROXtV7v3GX_jrxSh1VOgEw

I ordered the Sin City burger since, well, I live in Sin City ;) It came with fried egg, bacon, grilled onions and fried onion stings and smash sauce, served on an egg bun. It sounded amazing, but overall it was just very very greasy.  The bacon was a little soggy and not crispy, and they were very skimpy with the fried onion strings. The smash sauce is pretty tasty tho! Would def recommend. 

I also ordered smash fries, which smelled great (rosemary/italian seasoning? yum!), but after about 10 mins, after the fries cooled off, didn't taste so good. 

Overall, I always compare my burgers to what I believe to be their equivalent.... So Smashburger is getting compared to Shake Shack bc of price.  Overall, I think the burger here is only OK. Shake shack's burger has better flavor.  Smashburger does give you more options, including a build-your-own menu, but even then, the burger is just so greasy, I taste fat more than flavor. 

To be honest, I would even prefer In & Out to Smashburger since I think the flavor is better (and it's almost half the price). 

Service is very friendly, and food service was fast.

5918655,2010-09-22,0,diY31IEunbV8MfDh81FS1A,"Smashburger - have heard about it from friends and read favorable reviews on Yelp.  Was able to sample their menu recently at their W. Sahara/Fort Apache location and I couldn't believe that I have never noticed it being there, since i drove past it on a regular basis on my way to the West Sahara Library or Boca Park.  The restaurant is cheerfully decorated and have seating for about 80 people. The menu on the wall is nice and large, so you can read and ponder which item to try on your visit or ask the friendly and helpful cashier for their recommendations.

These are the items I have tried thus far (for menu item description you can easily navigate to their menu page on the SM website):

BBQ Ranch Smashchicken - overall a good chicken burger, which was nicely flavored and juicy. 

Haystack Onions - works inside the burgers, but not as a standalone sides.  Why?  It was why over salted and over fried (at least the one I was served).

Sweet Potato Smashfries - I like it!  The rosemary and garlic flavor is subtle and enhances the yummy earthy treat.

Honey Mustard Chicken Salad - I think this is a good salad, but the breading of the chicken is not mixed very well, since some pieces are really salty and others are just good.  I like their Honey Mustard dressing.  Salad is a decent size, but I would like to see a little more for $7.

Oreo Milkshake - New item on their menu and it was good.  Although I still prefer the one from Jack In the Box better.
Chocolate Milkshake - Good chocolate flavor, can never good wrong with this one.

Overall, I think Smashburger is a good burger joint that is a little different from the major national chains and worth giving it a try.  And in my book is a 3-3.5 stars eatery.  Why not a higher rating? Price is on the high side for fast casual burgers and fries.",RQlnSCjuqMnhR3Qk6j4KoA,0,0,3,V7uwaFvgUbTe1AuU1lLISw
5919168,2012-12-07,9,diY31IEunbV8MfDh81FS1A,"Sin City Burger, I've missed you.  Just a little over 2 years ago, the Smashburger was a wee tot and had just opened up.  I had the pleasure of dining here twice before I moved back to LA.  So, while visiting Vegas last week, I relished the chance to go back, eat, and have an opportunity to look at it anew with Yelper eyes.

Lots of tasty choices from burgers ($5-7, offered in 2 sizes), to salads ($6), to grilled chicken sandwiches ($6-7), hot dogs ($5), sides ($2-3), haagen-dazs shakes ($4), and chili ($3).  The prices are really reasonable, and if you don't fancy any of the selections, you can create-your-own anything here.

Re-living a not too recent favorite, I chose the Sin City Burger (american cheese, fried egg, bacon, grilled onions and served on an egg bun, http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=aXY6Ejxdb1RpLzp5Q4COVQ&userid=ZIOCmdFaMIF56FR-nWr_2A).  Instead of glorious fries, I chose the veggie frites (flash fried carrots and green beans).  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/diY31IEunbV8MfDh81FS1A?select=FOVjP_4w6ahRA0-3-0A3YQ#ejIvLEaxT5wsCd_UvtQRSQ

I think for the price-point of a $7 burger (1/2 pounder), it's very good and very messy...couldn't eat the whole burger without it breaking into pieces.  Taste wise, it's in the neighborhood of a In-and-Out, Johnny Rockets, or a Fatburger.  The meat is hand-formed, but thin and larger than the bun.  Seasoned lightly (I remembered it differently from before), but the quality of the meat is less than a gourmet burger (many which are found in my ""Berger knows Burgers"" list, http://www.yelp.com/list/berger-knows-burgers-los-angeles-2).

The Veggie Frites, great choice to save on carbs, and a unique offering at a burger place.  Green beans and carrots, flash-fried, sounds great. Unfortunately, I found them really boring, really oily, and with no pizazz or seasoning.  I ended up adding a ton of salt to it, so sure, no carbs, but now -- not even healthy.  And, WTH -- are you flipping me off?  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/diY31IEunbV8MfDh81FS1A?select=FOVjP_4w6ahRA0-3-0A3YQ#P-k5gqRqkCBad8G2rw9WRw

In summary, while the price-point for individual items seems reasonable, they didn't offer a combo price, so my tab (with a soda) ran over $12.  Not an inexpensive burger lunch adventure by any means.  Would I go back again, absolutely.  The food is fresh, the decor is contemporary in red and white (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/diY31IEunbV8MfDh81FS1A?select=FOVjP_4w6ahRA0-3-0A3YQ#FOVjP_4w6ahRA0-3-0A3YQ) with big painted words of ""Smash"", ""Sizzle"", and ""Savor"" --- and if you know me at all -- I love a good burger fix, and I'll find one in any city across the country.",ZIOCmdFaMIF56FR-nWr_2A,16,10,4,AB5-879BbFtvWULvvU9vEw

A lot of items were taken away from the menu. They no longer serve crispy fried chicken. Really?? WHY?? I know that grilled chicken is healthier, but come on, sometimes I am in the mood for fried chicken! The Chicken Avocado Club that I used to love wasn't the same. They also took away their hot dogs and there are less varieties of salads. The sweet potato fries used to be awesome when they were tossed with rosemary, olive oil and garlic. I was really looking forward to eating these again, but now they are plain and seasoned with sea salt. 

There are big digital menus by the register, which is nice. The cashier wasn't too friendly, but the girl who brought our food to the table was. She stopped by our table and checked on us twice. Pretty good service for a fast food place.
