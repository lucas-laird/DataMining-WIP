37581,2017-10-09,0,b1WGIdd_oSwGYZtC769Shw,"My third visit here. It's expensive and the food is subpar to par! First two to-go orders tasted alright - breakfast burrito (sub par) on the first visit and then the breakfast wrap (par) on the second visit. This morning, I invited my daughter for brunch. As we were already enjoying our food (she ordered the chicken caesar salad, which she would've liked a lot if only they didn't put too much cheese in the salad), I found a short strand of hair in my food (I ordered The Favorite)! I'm not a stickler when it comes to stuff like that (I choose my battles in life!). I took it out and kept going and didn't even say anything to my daughter; and then my daughter's eyes got bigger, made a big ""woah"" and goes, ""Mom!!!! Look!!!!"" So, there she pulls out a short strand of hair out of her salad! Oh heck, I thought! Two strikes! I called one of the servers and told him what we just found. He asked my daughter if she wanted new salad, but by then, she already lost her appetite. The server just said sorry, and walked away. My daughter and I thought he could've just offered to credit our food or he could've given us a voucher.... something... We had to be home at a certain time, that we couldn't really stay at the place another minute, so we decided to just pack up. Needless to say, I felt JIPPED paying almost $35.00 for two meals and finding hair strands in both orders! Oh, and one more thing, the coffee beans in the coffee were not fully grounded! There were particles of ground coffee beans in my cup. Side note: when you order and pay upfront, you're automatically asked (by their computer cash register) to tip...",8am-kFvjaKj8uE3jBMmCmA,0,0,1,2iZQV3_5GZxvJKn5lTQlyQ

181017,2016-08-16,0,b1WGIdd_oSwGYZtC769Shw,"Good location. Easy to find. Staff is friendly and helpful. Knowledgeable about their menu. I like the unlimited fountain drink refills and that they offer vitamin water, not just sodas. 

First time I went, I had a smoothie only and it was pretty good. This time I thought I'd try a salad since I was there for a lunch meeting. But I was disappointed. 

If I were reviewing just the food, we'd be looking at 2 stars. I added the third because of the good points I mentioned above.

I ordered the Grilled Vegetable and chicken salad. The menu described my salad deliciously, but what came out really seemed like leftovers thrown together haphazardly with cross contamination from another salad I'm sure they mixed in the same bowl earlier. The menu on their website listed all of the ingredients, but I found items that weren't included in the menu description. Either the menu is incorrect, or the salad was mixed in the same bowl, or someone in the back made a mistake. 

The other issue I had was that the salad wasn't actually mixed well. I had been eating it for about 10 minutes before I found the zucchini and eggplant at the very bottom. By then I didn't want to eat it, because they didn't look appetizing.

The grilled vegetables were cold and limp, hence my suspicion that it was leftovers. The chicken tasted like it had been cooked and chilled the day before, as did the grilled veggies. The whole salad was bland, and there was barely any salad dressing at all. And again, the occasional stray item that wasn't supposed to be in the salad popped up every once in awhile.

I left most of the salad on the table when I left. I barely ate any of it. Shame, because it was a very large portion. But it just wasn't worth it. I came home and I'm making my own lunch.

Bottom line: I felt like I was eating a salad at a fast food establishment, not a mom and pop small, locally owned business.",TnhTyk1qfJ8jL2bHpeTrhQ,1,0,3,yNhrox5KsBIPi5jOiioc-A
189282,2017-09-19,0,b1WGIdd_oSwGYZtC769Shw,"Yes, this review is a novel  but I am beside myself! I've been to this location a few times because my youngest daughter loves their smoothies, but the service is always very nonchalant, bordering rude. My daughter's and I visited yesterday and ordered 3 of the same type of smoothie. Immediately after we tasted them we all remarked that there were a lot of seeds this time but didn't really think anything of it. A few sips later I got what seemed far too large and flat to be a seed and unfortunately , I was correct.  All 3 smoothies were FULL of small pieces of stiff plastic!!! I had both girls check theirs as I did mine to make sure before I went back and it was unbelievable. Of course I went back.  I showed the manager on duty several pieces of plastic inside of each cup and her brilliant  response was and I quote , "" Oh, it must be coming off of the cups.""  Not once did she or the very unfriendly young woman who made the smoothies apologize. She offered to give us more smoothies in the disintegrating cups or a refund. I find it ridiculous that they were not more concerned about serving customers indigestible and dangerous product...unless it was done on purpose. In either case the situation and their response is UNACCEPTABLE !

I got the curry chicken sandwich on wheat bread and he got the Mac n cheese. Let's start with the sandwich. There was so many greens on the sanwhich that I might as well have gotten a salad. It was thrown together and falling apart as soon as I picked it up. There was barely any chicken and most of it fell off when I picked up the sandwich. The fries were your everyday fries and the portion was tiny. The Mac n cheese was terrible. It was too liquidy. It lacked in overall flavor.

Nothing crunchy or even holding it together. My friend ordered Banana chocolate chip pancakes. It was a large serving but she ate less than half because  the bottom two pancakes were overcooked and a bit burned. It was clean and the staff was friendly although a bit slow.

The sandwiches and pastas sounded good and they serve breakfast all day...sounded promising at first!  Who doesn't love breakfast food at dinner?!  Well...then we looked at the prices.  Holy smokes.  These portions better be good.  I ordered a breakfast burrito and paid an additional $1.50 to add bacon.  My husband ordered a BBQ bacon burger with onion rings and we split a small soda.  Total came to about $22.  Whoa...we could have eaten at a sit down restaurant for that price.  :\  We then proceeded to wait for 20 minutes or so.  It seemed to take forever.  When we finally got our food, we were a bit disappointed to see the portions.  My husband got literally 4 onion rings on the side and I expected my burrito to be a lot larger for nearly $10.  My breakfast burrito was just ok taste-wise.  I didn't like how it was pretty much all egg with hardly any salsa and I could barely taste the cheese.  For some reason the avocado wasn't spread out evenly throughout the burrito, just a big chunk of avocado on the end of the burrito.  They need to distribute the ingredients more evenly to balance out the tastes.  The part that really ticked me off was the bacon I paid an additional $1.50 for...The bacon was just tiny little chunks sprinkled throughout the egg and there was hardly any of it!  Seriously?  I paid extra for this?!  I couldn't even taste the bacon in it so I feel it was a total waste to get it.  Extremely disappointing and a total rip-off.

The price was a little high but still within a reasonable range. It normally cost me $11.65, approx., to get my sandwich. Later they implemented a military discount which brought the total to $10.65. Today I came in to order the same thing I've ordered since it opened almost a year ago and it the total was around $13.50. Seriously? First they don't honor the military discount because you have to be in uniform. First off, that's a pretty good way of never having to give a discount. Military families use the same source of income, at least i do. So if you give a spouse $1 off you're still giving that same military personnel a $1 off. What's the difference? It just seems very unfair to me. I wouldn't of been upset if it was just that. But now the prices have raised which I understand that's how businesses work. But $13 for a sandwich that's just turkey,  bacon, lettuce, and mustard?? Needless to say I will not be coming back. The people here are not as friendly as the previous staff.  Before when I came in they would offer me a cup for water and I always declined but today I was thirsty so I asked for a cup for water and when I got my receipt it had a charge for the cup. Really???

Loved the colors a bit sparse but comfortable 

I didn't really feel like I was in a kitchen. There were employees cleaning silverware and tossing dishes under the front counter throughout the visit. It should be renamed Rachel's dishroom. It was very loud and noisy from all of the dish work going on right next to where you order and eat. 

The food was good. Very tasty a bit pricey. The staff all smiled and was very accommodating and nice. Could have used a bit more kitchen feel and less i was in the dishroom. Doubt if would return.

I go to Rachel's Kitchen once a week for lunch. Up until today my biggest issue has been the cooks. Without fail, every time an attractive woman walks in, they call each over to the window to check her out and make comments to each other. I get that people might think that's a silly issue, but it's totally unprofessional. This is a restaurant, not a club, boys. Then today, it was pretty busy, but I ordered my salad to go and took a seat to wait. After about 25 minutes I went up to inquire about how much longer it might be. They had set my salad off to the side. The cashier just smiled and said, ""Oh, here it is. They must not have called your name."" And by ""they"", I'm pretty sure she meant herself. No apology, no offering to refund my money, nothing. Just placing the blame on some mysterious person. 

So, there you have it. Great food, crappy service. I guess if you have all day to wait or want to feel good about the way you look by having the people making your food check you out, Rachel's Kitchen is for you!",QjheW_NVceZXpAGO0OUQQg,4,0,2,47eg6_ZicpW9N17bXNraYA

We ordered a mushroom burger and fettuccine alfredo with chicken, and two watermelon juices. The cashier Yesenia looked back at the juicer and then said, ""the juicer isn't working right now."" When I can clearly see it was taken apart to be cleaned and she didn't want to clean it or juice our drinks. Which was pretty upsetting. So we went with just food.

Before I could even get out of my seat someone was right by my side asking if my burger was ok. When I explained it was undercooked she took it right back and had one remade for me. I am beyond impressed with the service and the the food!

For one thing we ordered pancakes with eggs easy over. They said they cannot make easy over they would only make over medium. I agreed, but when they came they were easy over. They will serve you fruit with your pancakes. But I'm just not used to having my watermelon & cantaloupe dipped in syrup before I eat them. The prices were about average and the food was also just about average. I really did not see anything that would set this restaurant a part from the pack. It is a casual setting it is not a restaurant setting where you are catered to. It is somewhere between fast food and a restaurant in their atmosphere. But on the positive side they are very friendly and they have outdoor seating.

We went for breakfast, and left full and satisfied. I had ""The Favorite"", a scramble with goat cheese, sun dried tomatoes, avocado, and herbs. It was delicious. I love goat cheese but had never had it with eggs before, and now I am definitely a fan. The potatoes tasted freshly made and were seasoned and cooked perfectly, seriously can't go wrong with this dish. My friend had the breakfast burrito which was pretty big. She couldn't even finish half and took the rest of it along with her potatoes home. It came with freshly made salsa, and she gave it all two thumbs up. Her two grandsons had banana chocolate chip pancakes (which I was totally jealous of), and a burger and fries (at 9 a.m.--teenage boys are weird). He said the burger was nice and moist, and I stole some of his fries--yum, for sure. 

Service was fast and very friendly. The man who rang up our order and delivered our food came over to our table and talked to us for a while about the restaurant and some of the menu items. We appreciated that. I read a review that said the portions are too small for the price, but I would definitely have to disagree with that. We all had food left on our plates at the end of the meal, and we were happy and stuffed. As far as the price goes, as long as the ingredients are fresh and unprocessed, they can justify it. It's not fast food, and I don't expect to pay fast food prices.

I will definitely be back for lunch and a smoothie. I'm glad to have the addition of this type of place in the sadly ignored far N/W.",5hUWPuMrU2ZFNyove-IjWA,1,0,4,bGQvcVWemwDGjHvgP2JazA

I walked up to the counter to place my order and after having to wait several minutes for the cashier to get off a personal call to take my order I was already wondering if  made a good choice of going there, but from all the wonderful Yelp comments and suggestions I waited patiently. 
I ordered a kids Chicken Fingers with Fries for my little 2 year old and a Mac and Cheese for myself, with our drinks the bill came out $19.85. Hmm a bit pricey if you ask me for small meals. 
We sat by the window and waited, there were only 4 other couples in the restaurant waiting for their meals as well (which came in after us) but we were for some reason we were the last ones to receive our meal after waiting 28 minutes yes I timed it. I think the waiter realized that we had to wait a while and that my little man was really hungry since he ate his chicken nuggets even though they were still very hot, she offered us a cup cake and apologize for us having to wait. 
My Mac and Cheese was good I couldn't believe the portion size since it ended up feeding my little boy and myself with still a little bit left over. The chicken fingers and fries umm not so good, the Chicken was hard and was very Tuff my little man didn't eat much of it and his fries were soggy which he also wasn't too interested in. 
After being home for a few hours my little man had the worst upset stomach to the point I had to give him some medicine to calm his stomach and had to stay with him till he slept ( which is never needed for him). An hour after I started feeling the same stomach pains and both of us were sitting in the bathroom holding our stomachs and throwing up everything. I ended up having to take him to our local grocery store at 11 pm to get us something so that we could get some rest before our busy day ahead of us.
Therefore my rating is only 2 stars, Staff each probably could learn more customer service skills and the food well I won't be eating there anymore. All in all the concept of the restaurant is nice and the ambiance but that's about it.",K8j3LpYqWTeRPNkemMtqnQ,6,2,1,rKO30CXIrgWv7iKD3nBIVQ

I ordered the chicken and roasted vegetable salad and the portion I received was incredibly generous. It was full of roasted zucchini, squash, eggplant, fresh tomato, cucumber and marinated grilled chicken. I didn't even have to ask for the dressing on the side because it was already there and it was a nice portion of the vinaigrette, not one of those baby cups you sometimes receive and have to ask extra for. 

I like this place because the food is always fresh and the portions are always generous. My personal favorites are the Cobb salad, the 440 sandwich, any of their delicious soups and the lemon bars. Their breakfast menu is also full of good eats.

The actual location is nice and very open. Every time I have been there it has been clean and the staff has been friendly. Outside dining is available, but I am not sure how useful in the summer.

I have tried the following and would order each one, again (and I have):

- Chopped Salad w/ grilled chicken: This is the ant-lettuce salad. It. Is. Big. A great blend of chopped broccoli, red cabbage, tomatoes, olives, garbanzo beans and mozzarella cheese with a nice balsamic vinaigrette. I added chicken for protein, but it really doesn't need it. 5 stars out of 5, for me.
- Cheese Burger: Standard cheeseburger, done right, I'd rate it 7/10. I usually get the sweet potato fries which are slightly sweet, tender with a bit of crunch.
- Breakfast Burrito: I love breakfast burritos and this is pretty solid. I'd give it a solid 80%

Your Establishment isn't cheap but when you mess up take out orders it really makes people feel cheated and never want to go back.  We are no long ordering food from here because we feel that last meal was complete act of thievery or con or whatever.

I am friendly to everybody and to have such rude service at a place you really like sucks. I even tip them 20 percent or more and still the same.

If I had to give the owner a piece of advice I would say to move the blender to the back of the restaurant.

Meh, for some, a positive for me. Nice to have the option to go somewhere and eat clean if I want to....or not and get some fries with it. 

The BF and I decided to share: 

Curried chicken salad sandwich - this had nice flavor and enjoyed the pear (? or green apple) and raisins in the mix. We chose French bread, but it came on a ciabatta shape instead, that's OK though. We picked sweet potato fries as our side and that was standard, but solid fare. 

Angel Hair Bolognese - anytime I see bolognese I do want to try it. This was more in the ""meat sauce"" catagory than bolognese with carrots, celery, peas, etc. in it that other spots do. It was a rather large bowl and came piping hot! Decent homestyle sauce though. 

It's counter order, get a number and DIY drinks so there isn't ""service"" to rate, but they we're friendly at the counter. I've seen in other locations reviews that it was ""pricey"", so I was actually surprised it was prices I was fine with. $9.95 for a sandwich and side didn't seem outrageous to me when a shitty chain diner like Denny's is charging about that. 

I'm sure we will be back. I hear so much about their juice and smoothies that I definitely have to pop in for one soon as well as more of the menu. Good addition to the area, we don't really have a little cafe up here.",n86B7IkbU20AkxlFX_5aew,3,2,4,qmNTmf5EQY-dcTMIFF1Cog

The items I've tried so far :

440 Sandwich ($10.50): Grilled Chicken Breast, Goat Cheese, Avocado, Roasted Red Peppers and Tomatoes, and Romaine Lettuce. Good, healthy sandwich lol. It felt a little spendy, but you are paying for fresh ingredients in a health conscious restaurant...so it kind of comes with the territory. 

Hawaiian Bliss Smoothie : Pineapples, Banana, Coconut, Pineapple Juice, and Non Fat Vanilla Frozen Yogurt. This was probably my favorite shake out of the 3 I've tried so far!

Sunrise Smoothie : Strawberries, Bananas, Fresh Squeezed OJ, Apple Juice, and Non Fat Vanilla Frozen Yogurt. 2nd favorite...yum :P

Peanut Butter Blast Smoothie : Bananas, Peanut Butter, Chocolate Peanut Butter Cups, Chocolate Milk, and Non Fat Vanilla Frozen Yogurt.  I think they compensate for the peanut butter, since that shake was a little more ""runny"" vs the others.

Oatmeal Raisin Cookie and Chocolate Chip Cookie ($1.50ea). Good cookies...they probably go light on the butter and sugar here. Juuust sweet enough, but it's definitely a ""healthy"" cookie.

Overall it is a pretty good deli style setup for quick eats that won't make you feel guilty eating it afterwards :)

After a hearty brunch at a cafe nearby, I was craving for a smoothie real bad so we went here. I normally get anything with strawberries but I wanted something with Nutella...or chocolate. They don't have anything with Nutella so, I got Peanut Butter Blast (chocolate peanut butter cups, bananas, peanut butter, chocolate milk and non-fat vanilla frozen yogurt).  I'm not a fan of chocolate peanut butter cups but if it's in smoothie form then, it's not too bad. It wasn't as thick as a smoothie should be but the taste was great. The friend got an oatmeal raisin cookie and a Sunrise smoothie (strawberries, bananas, OJ, apple juice and non-fat vanilla frozen yogurt).  The consistency was perfect and you can tell real fruits were used.  We waited about 10 minutes for our smoothies.  You can add protein powder to your smoothie for $1. The cookie was crisp and not a lot of butter was used.  That's a good thing, right?

They have lots of healthy options such as salads, turkey burger, sandwiches, wraps, soups and fresh fruit juices.  I'll definitely be back to try their wraps or sandwiches.",tH0uKD-vNwMoEc3Xk3Cbdg,2,3,4,Xb7YoPd1MfHxCj-Y_A3OPQ

You can customize them too with your own choice of bread and side! Pretty awesome if you ask me. Here are some of my favorites:

Curry Chicken Salad Sandwich- An amazing twist on your regular chicken salad. I love spices, and this sandwich definitely is full of them. Hubby has to put up with my curry breath after I eat one of these lol.

BBQ Chicken Wrap- The secret behind this wrap is the onion rings! They go so well with the bbq grilled chicken and romaine lettuce. It's served on a green spinach wrap which helps all the ingredients come together (literally!).

Rachel's Chicken Salad Sandwich- Reminds me of my mom's homemade chicken salad, and anything that reminds me of her food is always delicious! This is Hubby's personal favorite, but I love it too. Apples & grapes are a great addition to chicken salad.

Whatever you do decide to order, you seriously can't go wrong here. Everything tastes so fresh and wholesome. The best part is that they use all natural & 100% hormone free chicken breast! Their baked goods are also made fresh daily. For a yummy treat, get an Incredible Hulk Smoothie. Bananas, peanut butter, soft silken tofu, milk, and honey all blended together...

However, I can only base my review on the items we order/have ordered. A Caesar salad is not the healthiest of choice when it comes to salads...but by gosh there are leaves in it for crying out loud--healthy enough! I am an absolute Caesar salad finatic and a huge critic. When ever we frequent Rachel's I opt for the Caesar chicken wrap. Honestly, one of the best Caesar wraps I've had, thus far. Gosh knows how much Caesar wraps I've explored. 

I love that it isn't dripping in sauce and that all the ingredients taste fresh and crispy. My husband thinks their chicken is a tad dry, but I absolutely love it. I don't think it's as dry as he thinks. The chicken used are hormone free, free ranged chicken...even better! There are different wraps to choose from (wheat, flour, spinach...), but if you don't special request your wrap of choice don't expect them to ask unless it is an actual option for that item. 

Their wraps come with a choice of French fries, sweet potatoe fries, onion rings, or kettle chips. I'm about the ying and the  yang...I'm already eating something healthy, drop me some french fries. Their fries are portioned small, not greasy, and more on the skinny side. I like 'em anyway. 

We've also had their bbq chicken wrap which is definitely good as well! Same thing, not soggy, fresh vegetables, no overwhelming amount of sauce in the wrap and pretty tasty. 

You can actually turn their salads/sandwiches into a wrap as well. My husband did this for their Rachel's chicken salad. It was deeeelish!!! It's a chicken salad but with grapes and apples diced in there! Definitely recommend you trying that as well.

I only have tried their smoothies once. Twas the sunrise. It was a little on the disappointing side because it was a little watery. Not even smoothie like at all. One day I may try a smoothie out again, but I only go for their wraps so then again...maybe not. That'll be a mood. 

I personally don't like bringing the whole family here because it's basically like 10/11 bucks per person. My boys end up hungry an hour later. They're typical filipinos who need their rice + ______ to feel satisfied. The husband and I...we're usually good. I mean, you are eating here with a purpose so you should know going in that you will probably be hungry an hour later. Hahahhaa. 

I would certainly recommend trying the place out especially if you are health conscious or on the road to weight watching. I love that when you dine-in they don't serve your food on paper plates (I don't have anything against paper plates whatsoever). Seeing your huge serving of salad in a real bowl just looks classier. They do offer vegeterian options and you can certainly request changes to your meal to make it vegan friendly if applicable. We don't have much places, if any, in the northwest side of such type of business to size them up to another location. Fortunately for them.

Note: it's best to try them dining-in first. If you order out and have a ways drive, your fries will sog and your wrap will start diluting the sauce...you may not get a good first impression that way. Unless, you plan on eating it to-go  in the next 5-10 minutes after buying it.

The breakfast wrap with eggs and bacon was very soggy on the outside, and had no flavor.  The potatoes were okay. My boyfriend's pancakes were very doughy inside and undercooked...he didn't even eat his.  Cost $30.",QdPY0W7WIgBZrzRuL1lZMA,0,0,1,URVnDXgnfiF2sCz0uk7RDQ

Kids had chocolate chip banana pancakes which were ok. I had huevos rancheros which was edible but not good. My husband had the breakfast burrito and didn't like it at all. He only ate half of it as he didn't like it enough to eat any more of it. We won't be eating here again and wouldn't recommend it.,xUSIcnSTPBEP27F6urXTpQ,0,0,1,JIOxcKBvDlDE1pg51j5mog

5783728,2016-08-19,0,b1WGIdd_oSwGYZtC769Shw,This place is hit or miss. Pear chicken salad and the signature pasta was great. The curry chicken salad was a big miss for me. Seems as though there's many pieces of pear in the chicken salad mix and minimal/ almost no chicken? Besides the missing chicken the curry spice mix with all the pear didn't seem to pair well and just ended up tasting very odd. And to top it off the salad came with a balsamic dressing on the side which made no sense. The fresh juice is a plus.,Am3LsTlsBcTXAb_M-6eWiQ,0,0,3,52Yii8tKvdNxTAxhULgc9g

However, my hubby tried it and said it was good.  He also got the Sautéed mushroom burger and really liked it.  The onion rings were fried nicely but 5 onion rings came with the order.

5811655,2015-12-01,6,b1WGIdd_oSwGYZtC769Shw,"We noticed Rachels Kitchen driving through this parking lot off Durango and not sure how long it has been in this spot we decided to take a risk and go try it out and never hearing about it before our son said he had ate here and he liked it for the smoothies and salads.

We noticed there is a small outside seating area with small bistro style tables.and inside
Café style setting.
Everyone was friendly when we walked in.
There were a couple of tables with people eating at.

We did not know what they had that was good so we both decided on getting  the Turkey Club ~ Smoked turkey, bacon, Swiss cheese, avocado, romaine lettuce, tomatoes and mayo .
We noticed they serve a lot of salads and wraps and healthy drinks.
So they are geared more toward being a healthier place to eat at!

We enjoyed our visit and the food was fresh and good. The only thing I thought was the prices were a bit high but you get what you pay for and that is Fresh

I think we would go back and try something else.  The salads do look good. I read some of the negative reviews and I would say I am sure every place has their bad days we didn't see anything bad other than a few tables that needed to be cleaned off.
No biggie!
Why not Try it for yourself and you decide.",zH6racrZ7rUqqv_Qy6dZDQ,11,7,4,DM0eRcnw65jz4x2CTZpN8Q
5826830,2014-02-04,1,b1WGIdd_oSwGYZtC769Shw,"Lately I've been in this smoothie mood. Since I was in the area I decided to give theirs a shot. I ordered the Peanut Butter Blast. I think it was close to $5. My 3 year old daughter wanted to try it first. Right after she takes a sip she starts spitting it out! On me! Yuck.. I asked her what's wrong and she kept saying it was yucky. It was surprising cause she's never done that with other smoothies. So, I tried it next and boy was she right! It was terrible! The worst smoothie ever (sad to say). It didn't taste like peanut butter or any if the ingredients that was suppose to be in it. I don't know how to describe the taste besides terrible. Ended up tossing it. Waste of money.. Maybe it was an off day to go? Friday.. The staff wasn't friendly either",Yj79QbOyYO1q6ythwB3bvQ,1,0,1,Km1Gfgi8MJE8A3og6Jje1w

I ordered a omelette, take note it comes without cheese, don't forget to add it because it's nasty without cheese lol they were kind enough to add it afterwards and made a world of difference. The immune juice was very good, people need to understand that healthy and fresh isn't cheap therefore stop bitching about the price people. I juice at home and vegetables aren't cheap especially organic so please stop! Rant over

5926478,2016-12-12,0,b1WGIdd_oSwGYZtC769Shw,"This place has something for everyone. From smoothies to burgers to pasta, they have it ALL! I work right next door and didn't feel like driving to find lunch, so I decided to walk over and see what all the fuss was about (from coworkers.) The lineup to order was alittle weird at first because people were on both sides (lining up across the dessert glass and in front where you had just walked in) so after stumbling abit and making sure I wasn't cutting in front, I finally found my place and ordered. I was originally going to get the Angel Hair Bolognese but I wasn't quite sure what exactly the sauce was and even if I would like it (the cashier tried to explain it the best he could, but sweet dumb me still didn't get it), so I ordered their Fettuccine Alfredo with Chicken. Now, I either missed it completely or it didn't mention it, but there IS mushroom in this dish and I didn't figure that out until I got it. I wasn't going to ask them to remake it or anything since it was my error, so I just ate around it. ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC as far as taste goes. The restaurant was clean and gave it a really nice, home feeling to it. Akin to going to a family member's house to eat. I also would highly suggest grabbing one of their Lemon Bars. I tried one for the first time and absolutely fell for it, it was heavenly. Waitstaff was very nice (I wish I had names, I would praise them so highly.) If you're ever around and looking for a place for a quick bite, I would definitely recommend them.",Pa2FJ6zh0BDXVs4ntCZkLg,0,0,4,JlZRSPINembJ6z7HJnVH1w

Their sweet potato fries are one of my favorites. Even their kids meals are big enough for an adult. My toddler enjoys the grilled cheese and big bowl of fruit every time.
