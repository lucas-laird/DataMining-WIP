Everything was hot and fresh. Miguel took the order and did a phenomenal job with everything. GREAT SERVICE!!,oOzR5j2PeW3A_PoG1eQK2A,0,0,5,sIrExzP6WKgbVhuB6Iizug

4019103,2017-01-11,0,sjO0HUb3VdYGQdHxrTnKUw,So I went to del taco today and order del nachos with no red sauce add turkey and no salt on the chips I get it like that all the time from the other del tacos the cashier was nice but the GM was super rude bout my order. She didn't even want to do it she was like next time I'm not gonna do it and just so u know ur chips are going to be super oily. I was like ok I just want the chips no salt cause I have high blood pressure.,dfZW9xmkNP8dF5rRtB_HIg,0,0,1,Z9dvU_tjjj0wNcf-iQu3vA

I sometimes have to wait quite a while for my food but In their defense I do often order a lot for my whole family. Overall a good experience.,4xXpSw76Fy0tzCNdK2izbA,0,0,5,0qOQvCHxMizVqsX8_rU_DQ
4951542,2017-02-28,0,sjO0HUb3VdYGQdHxrTnKUw,"Came here for lunch and had the pollo asado with avocado bowl.

Came out to be $5, not bad for a quick lunch at an inexpensive price.

The bowl was decent, but nevertheless it's still fast food so don't expect any more. 

The place was clean which is a big plus for me.",cRDQuBEgxaYQoSPHAiEgHQ,0,0,3,5DUowS5NhC-iTBq31orUww
