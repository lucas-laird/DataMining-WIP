I have come here several times and I am very particular with where I smoke hookah. Luv is a perfect place. The music is well mixed and play a little bit of everything. The hookah flavor is exceptional and doesn't give you that cheap burning feeling all the other hookah places give you. I REALLY recommend the steak tacos by the way the meat tastes soooooo good.

This is a new hookah lounge. The ambiance is great. Service great. They have 3 screens only one connected to cable, the other two show music videos. We came during happy hour to watch the game. Tired hookah, beers and tacos. Steak tacos were delicious. Chicken were really dry. Both were little cold. The hookah was very very harsh no matter what we tried to fix it. It's a new place so I hope they fix this. I'll go again hoping they still sorting things out and fix this. Prices are great as well",Ha5PQEZHmtPEVTAQDRvsRw,0,0,5,aXdjCzRwnhmKGadkI8bxVw

2437305,2017-07-29,7,aEtbk_LuJREjm66jKmCQRw,"I was excited that a new hookah lounge opened pretty close to where I live! The other ones I go to are near the strip and get crowded with tourist pretty fast. I came by the other day during their happy hour (5-8pm) to check it out. It's very nice inside but it is a little small. They have a relaxed atmosphere and I like that they play music videos on multiple tv screens. 

The hookah was only $10 and one of the servers suggested blue mist mixed with orange and I really liked it. The food and drinks were mediocre.... I ordered 2 margaritas and didn't even have a buzz after. My friend ordered Hennessy & Sprite and it was also watered down. I tried the mini tacos that were $2 each, one steak & one chicken and they were both bland. 

The customer service was really good and everyone was friendly. I might stop by in another month or so to see if the food and drinks have improved.",YB2SZbMgQHBOGOIsBK2Tkg,20,11,3,-NcVhu2n6-j3B-_SAeAtaw

3148569,2017-10-18,1,aEtbk_LuJREjm66jKmCQRw,"Our server greeted us and we seated ourselves in the center couch by this hanging clown installation. Came in around 10pm on a Tuesday, Celtics vs Cavaliers was on the TVs and the music playing was Drake to reggae which was some guys playlist on Spotify. The intimacy of the place is chill since they are working with such a small space. Happy hour was from 6pm-8pm so tacos weren't $2 but being taco Tuesday they should've at least had some sort of special with tacos. 
I was hungry so they accommodated me for tacos to be vegetarian which my friend made fun of me because when it came out it reminded him of rabbit food. Corn tortilla, lettuce with bell peppers and a side of not much pico, with sriracha. I noticed other pictures of chips coming with the tacos from previous reviews and I had no chips at all. 
I had some diva mule drink but drinking from a straw was hard due to the fruit garnish getting stuck from the bottom so just ditch the straw. Hookah was great forgot the flavor since our server recommended it but two coals should be good at first since not even 10 minutes into our bowl the harshness was real.
I had a problem with the way this place was suppose to be unwinding and chill but this group in the corner was going at it very obnoxiously wanting to fight and the staff tried to take care of it so I had to listen to two gentlemen wanting to fight each other by not taking it outside for at least 20 minutes. Trying not to roll my eyes so hard at that table just threw the vibe off.",06o1DmiBoiyxI2q3v2QRbg,0,0,3,vHdk-1xxVkOARhNMfxJyuA
