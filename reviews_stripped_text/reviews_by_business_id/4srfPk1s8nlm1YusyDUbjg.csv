2374795,2018-01-11,0,4srfPk1s8nlm1YusyDUbjg,Brought two of my coworkers here for lunch today and as usual Ian was there to smile and greet us. This is seriously one of the best subways I've been to and the new coupons really make it more affordable to come in more often. The coupon that came in the mail was $5.99 for any footlong and nobody can beat that price with a 20 foot pole!!!! My coworkers got two 6 in meals for $9.99! Cheers to you subway for making the cost more reasonable and Ian for always being kind and professional!,V7cGEFexpXTY-jKWhqkHcw,0,0,5,Yf9GZNkgQxZFhk_ftp3UoQ

They have a variety of drinks to choose from including fountain (coke products), Dasani, simple lemonade, Gatorade and a few other juices and milk (both chocolate and white). They also have a plethora of chips to choose from. 

Overall clean, good quick eats, will be back again and again.",WXDj6mmyrJi5q5nHKJ6H7w,3,1,4,FMRzUXMwjx8vPAy-qgej7A

2838729,2017-09-28,0,4srfPk1s8nlm1YusyDUbjg,"Worst experience ever Alejandra was very rude she even stated to me she was the manager when in fact she is the assistant manager at the store visited around 5:48 pm...I presented a coupon to her that said ""Valid for in-restaurant orders only, excluding kiosk orders. Extras & Deluxe additional. Plus tax. No cash value. Not for sale. 1 time use. 1 coupon per qualifying item(s). Cannot be combined with promotional offers. Void if transferred, sold, auctioned, reproduced, purchased or altered, & where prohibited. Valid at participating Clark, Lincoln, and Nye County, NV area locations. Exp 10/3/17."" She informed me that it could only be used for sandwiches that were under the discounted menu no where does it says this on the coupon above...when asking for the Corp. Number she told me to google it as I walked out the store it's clearly posted on the door. Even if she didn't know ""google it"" was a very rude response. To add insult to injury to talk shit in Spanish to the other customer in the store as if I don't understand made matters worse!!! Would give now stars if I could!!!!!",VvPx5CH2qzj0YWRSrDH4wQ,0,0,1,b-hPwDTtvj27RTwotZo9Gg

3942690,2014-01-05,1,4srfPk1s8nlm1YusyDUbjg,"Very rude.  I ordered 2 children sandwich meals.  My children are diabetic. I did not want milk as a drink.  I wanted water.  So he charged me for 2 water cups.  He told me he was giving me a cup, buthe was charging me for tap water.  When i wanted the milk for another family member, he had a problem.  Tap water should be free.  Then he had a problem with my coupon for the free coupons for filling out a survey.  
What i would like to have then option of water, tap or a bottle water. So if you want tap water, be willing to pay.  Or if willing to have a whiney child, they will substitute a cookie for a milk without a problem. Uneven treatment of guest.  Find another Subway, you do not not have to drive far.",L5YLSTH5237Hn_xR2N4wmg,1,0,1,vkazwaL_kHPQlqutc-1XwA
4042170,2015-07-30,3,4srfPk1s8nlm1YusyDUbjg,"This place definitely has its fair list of short comings but its over all a decent location.

I like that it is located pretty close to my home and that it's open 24 hours because I'm usually getting off pretty late every night.

I like that they have a bell to ring outside so the employees can buzz you in at night. I think this is a great safety precaution for any 24 hour business and its nice to know the owner cares about their staff.

I do not like that they are always out of stuff when I come after 9PM. It is always stuff I'm really craving too! Like pickles, or avocados, or tuna. I definitely think for a location that has to be open 24 hours they should stock better and help set their employees up for a successful night.

Over all not the worst Subway I have ever been too. Employees are always tired by the time I get there, but they are friendly!",oG9VFtr_ye8v2tDnS3NOYw,6,5,3,zggETvlNW-YEjd3hr6YWfw
4065886,2018-04-08,24,4srfPk1s8nlm1YusyDUbjg,"When it comes to Subway, this place has got to be my favorite. Not sure how long this location has been here, but it was SUPER clean and I mean like brand new clean. All the tables were neatly organized with all their chairs in their proper places. The trash was emptied. The floor was clean and shiny. All the chips and cookies were filled. The drink station was clean and in order as well. 

When it came to ordering my sandwich, the lady was very polite and efficient. I ordered the Veggie Patty sub. Had it toasted with pepper jack cheese and all the veggies except for the banana peppers. She had my sandwich made and I was out the door in a matter of just minutes. She was the only one working there, but was very quick and got people's subs done very quickly so no one had to stand around waiting for more than a few minutes. 

My sandwich was delicious! Bread was fresh, fluffy and crispy on the outside. All the veggies were fresh tasting. The lady making my sandwich made sure to fill it up with veggies. Usually, I end up asking for more of something cause it's like most Subway locations make sure not to put more than just 5 olives on your sandwich. 

Will definitely come back to this location.",GWs9J6lIUqrySTxl6uXO0A,35,38,5,fzoL8OoYfd2UQWttbHgUuw
4875716,2018-06-26,0,4srfPk1s8nlm1YusyDUbjg,"One of the nicest and cleanest locations I've been to. This location is just 8 minutes walking distance from my house and so it's very convenient for me, but for some reason, it's taken forever to visit this location. 

As you enter you are greeted by a very friendly face. Since I already knew what I wanted, I ordered right away. The guy making my sub was very attentive to my particular wants. He was efficient and quick. When making my sub he didn't skimp on ingredients like many other places do and he was kind enough to add extra when I asked for it. 

All the ingredients were fresh and didn't look as though they had been sitting out for a long time. The lettuce in particular didn't have any brown piece in it which I was very thankful for. 

The inside was super clean. All tables were wiped down and the floor was swept and clean. The inside looked like this place just opened up for business. Everything was perfect. Will come back again!",zudZl2wYpmZYyoklPVhV-A,1,0,5,-REnW5S_M6WTl8iHLgUdaQ
