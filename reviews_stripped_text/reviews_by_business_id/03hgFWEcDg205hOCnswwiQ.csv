First of all our sangria order was forgotten and it took over 15 minutes to be served our drinks even though the restaurant was not even close to full. After this we ordered 4 dishes, one of which we were informed they were out of at 6pm on a Sunday. Instead of that we ordered two additional dishes, neither of which we ever received :( The mac & cheese was excellent, the mozzarella  Beignets were completely overcooked, and the Gambas al Ajillo were not served sizzling despite what the menu says. We ordered the chocolate tort after this which was excellent. The waiter did offer to take care of our drinks and dessert as he knew they had messed up. To top it off the bill had the item that they were out of on it(?!) as well as some other random item we never ordered. We decided to just pay it and get out of there as we were fed up.

simple non-descript space in a shopping center.

started with a blackberry / cherry sangria, non-alcoholic mojito for the gf ( approx $7 each )   the sangria ok - my only beef - they left cut up pieces of lime in the drink - the problem with this is they looked like pieces of the apple ( not great lighting in the place ) and as i'm scooping out the blackberries, and apple pieces to munch on, i also munch on some lime rinds - i don't care for that !

the food - decent - ordered  caprese salad, coloroado lamb chops, finger potatoes w/ chorizo, grilled asparagus, sauteed mushrooms,  stuffed artichokes and the filet sliders.

the standouts - for me. the mushrooms, for the gf - the potatoes. everything decent just nothing that made you go , ""wow."" also, only minor beef - served the caprese last - thought that should be the 1st item to be served.

would i eat at RE tapas again - sure,  in fact, there were several items we wanted to try but  we can only eat so much in one sitting.

2971244,2009-04-26,0,03hgFWEcDg205hOCnswwiQ,"Overall, RE Tapas is a trendy-looking place with a fresh atmosphere.

The food was pretty good, definitely not bad for the price. I would have liked to have seen a few more exotic tapas choices on the menu, as the fare seemed pretty standard for a tapas place.

Roasted lamb: delicious and juicy and topped with cooked red onions. Definitely my favorite of the tapas I tried.

Stuffed peppers: delicious, although I felt the fried coating was slightly too much. I think the cheese would have complemented the peppers enough without the breading.

Ceviche: Not terribly exciting overall, although I must admit, I've never tried this anywhere else.

Stuffed dates: It's difficult to mess up stuffed dates for me, and these were definitely yummy.

Mixed green salad: The house vinaigrette was delicious, although I wish there had been more greens to go with it. 

The sangria was in the largest glass I have ever seen the drink in at a restaurant. It was tasty, although it seemed light on the alcohol and just a little too sweet.

Overall, the service wasn't bad, although a bit slower than we were hoping. We asked the waitress for the calamari fries (fried calamari) and the flaming cheese (a dish that looked particularly exciting because the dish was set aflame at the table), and she forgot to put the order in. We ended up not reminding her because we were in a rush to catch a movie.

I would probably go back to try a few more of the tapas I was eying (including the forgotten ones), but I'm not sure I would choose it over Firefly or even the slightly more expensive Cafe Ba-ba-reeba. All of the equivalent dishes I have tried at Firefly (including the sangria) I prefer at Firefly. Although, I did like that RE Tapas was quite a bit quieter than Firefly.",d1kO5QJ2E8IIft4NwmpxmQ,0,0,3,w7HygwzCnBMaJxgkGxjScw

The place is pretty good.  I came in to meet my party, who was already there and seated, so I can't speak about the hostess, but the waiter was prompt enough.  We ordered a lot of things, but I only got to try a few of them.  I started with a Thai Basil Mojito, which was very good.  However, there was a lot of very good tapas, as well.  I liked the stuffed dates, the sauteed scallops, the stuffed mushrooms, and most of all the crabby paddies!  They were very good, each bite quite flavorful.

I ate a few other things, but I can't remember them.  The only thing I didn't like was the lamb chops.  Too dry, and not enough flavor, especially compared to the other dishes.  

We also went on a Friday night, and there was an incredible jazz band there, so that really helped the ambiance.  I'd come back with friends, definitely.",UIdX_cI1awxvPH7kIFKpXw,1,0,4,jotKuFrAd-991-y292VXZw

3304880,2008-06-03,2,03hgFWEcDg205hOCnswwiQ,"Twice I have been to RE.  Twice I have been disappointed. 

The first time I didn't think the food was too bad, but it wasn't anything special.  The service was fine.  The sangria was tasty, but way too light on the booze for my taste.

The second time my husband wanted to check it out as he missed the food from the tapas places that I worked at in NY.  We had the patatas bravas.  While the flavor was spot on, they weren't hot enough & you could tell that they were precooked & past their prime.  We also had some beets with ricotta salata.  Except that it wasn't so, it was regular fresh ricota.  Big difference.  I want what I order & if you don't have it please inform me.  I do know the difference.  Another menu ""mistruth""  was when we ordered the fried piquillo pepper.  However, when it arrived they said be careful they are hot.  Piquillos are hardly hot ever, never, ever!  Anyway, they were freakin hot.  Maybe they were anaheims?  They got sent back & I love spicy food, but not when I don't order it.  We also had the chicken croquettes.  Dry, way too salty & I love salt.  They only tasted of oregano & salt.  Oh & did I forget the salt?  Dry, dry, dry.  Honestly, the best thing about the meal was the cheese plate.  It would be hard to mess that one up.  Even the bread that came with that sucked.  It was pre toasted & then brought to the table oiled, soggy & tough.  Oh & the serrano & manchego were fine.  
Again, how much can you mess that up?  All you have to do is plate it.

Now the service.  Our server was not very polite nor was he at all attentive in any way, shape or form.  We went in at about 8:30 on a Thursday night.  We were one of maybe 4 tables in there.  He ended up having a large party of about 12 half way through our meal.  It took a while to get our drinks in the first place.  Which was funny as the bar was right next to us, but he was no where to be found.  I never got a refill.  My wine glass sat empty for over 15 minutes too.  He walked by many times too.  He acted as if he couldn't have cared less.  He could have made some money off of our table, but let that one slip away.  When we discovered how hot the ""piquillo's"" were we pushed them to the side.  He came to collect the plates and I had to tell him to take them off the bill as he had no clue.  I suppose it wasn't obvious that we didn't eat any of them...Finally he asked if we wanted some refills.  Where was I Denny's?  No, I want another glass of wine, but I wanted that over a quarter of an hour ago.  By that point the sheer disappointment of the food & lack of service set in & all I wanted to do was leave.  In fact I couldn't wait to get out of there.  That hardly ever happens to me...

Oh & the interior.  Don't even get me started on that.  The trying to hard mod interior & those dowdy curtains on the windows.  Yuck.",0fG7akW_GqoA3iWMD8_wNg,2,2,1,aFkgY31qmucwXlZVFo9aUQ

Favorites included, well, pretty much everything we had!: smoked duck, lobster tacos (on the special back page, not sure if it's always offered), meatballs, stuffed mushrooms, grilled asparagus, grilled salad, shrimp diavolo, stuffed dates wrapped in bacon.  Also, the thai basil mojitos sound strange but are lovely, refreshing and citrusy.

The live music seemed to be good, but when I asked to be seated, the hostess told me that two cooks quit and it would be a 30 minute wait.  I think this is ridiculous when the restaurant was not that busy.  I then asked if we could sit down and have a few drinks before we ordered.  She looked around and said no.  This place will not be in business for long treating customers like this.  She told me the kitchen was backed up.

This comes real close to the tastes. I came here with a small group with intentions to see what Chef Errol was all about. I was very impressed with the fact he was using Food Science which is the new cutting edge trends hitting up many spots in LA and NY.
The ambiance of the place is very dark, clean, and comfortable. The staff was exceptionally nice.
We let Chef decide what to make for us. 
The drinks were very good. Made from fresh ingredients. This place also has a guiness surger! SCORE!
The food is exceptional and the price is definitely reasonable.
I enjoyed the grilled romaine salad. Very flavorful. The salad was warm and you can really taste the dressing and the individual flavors. The lamb was phenomenal. We enjoyed the Carpaccio, LOBSTER, and tortilla espaniola which is so authentic spanish.(It wasn't room temperature which is how it's supposed to be served) It was warm and tasty with the herbs and potatoes. Definitely try the duck breast. - I usually like it more rare, but it was definitely delish. The dessert presentation was very classy yet cutting edge. Truffles and Kai Vodka? PHENOMENAL!

Anyway, when I go to Vegas I usually go to Firefly and/or Cafe Ba Ba Reeba and eat my own weight in meat and cheese...but not anymore. I have a new favorite Tapas place in Vegas and it is RE Tapas!

The restaurant is in a new-ish strip mall in the southeast part of town, that has a few other restaurants and a Fresh and Easy (another one of my favorites.) It is a well decorated, nice sized room with a large bar area where we saw several ""single male eaters having lunch."" The service was great and the portions were huge. We tried the following dishes:

Gazpacho-Very fresh and light. You could really taste the cucumber and it wasn't too oniony...my complaint about many gazpachos.

Manchego cheese and serrano ham-Large wedges of cheese served on a stick with a large amount of ham wrapped around them and drizzled with a balsamic reduction. There were 4 skewers and they were heavenly.

Caprese-small plum tomatoes that were sugar sweet marinated in delicious balsamic and fresh buffalo mozzarella...really fresh and delicious and served on a cool yin-yang plate.

Lamb chops-perfectly cooked and served with chimichuri and roasted red pepper sauces. Amazing!

Marinated beef tenderloin skewers-very garlicy, moist and delicious.

Smoking crispy duck breast-It was served in a chinese steamer, and it was still smoking when it arrived. They actually smoke it in the steamer. The duck was juicy on the inside and crispy on the outside...it was coated in a dry rub that was really smokey and tasted like cumin. It was really decadent and fabulous.

Coconut flan-The flan was served with a burnt sugar sauce and garnished with flaked coconut and an orange sugar dusted plantain chip. This is some of the best flan I have ever had.

Overall the experience was amazing! RE Tapas is a bit out of the way, but it is definitely worth the trip.",QmH5O1JHDOBvUqzr4vz5-Q,0,0,5,zTQF2equpr2-keVw6rKW-Q

I mean that this is not your traditional Spanish Tapas restaurant, as they do have some novel creations by the executive chef/owner, such as this phenom sashimi dish, but that doesn't take away from the fact that I have now found my favorite Tapas restaurant in the US. The food was delectable, and well worth the 8 minute drive out of the strip. I believe the owner said the restaurant has been open for just a few months... and boy what a welcomed addition to the epicurean elite!

My group had at least 15 different dishes served all night, and as full as I was... I just could not stop eating. The lamb chops, super tender calamari, scrumptious lobster n' crab, the carpaccio, Tortilla Espanol (which even our Basque friend said was spectacular), and this amazing grilled romaine dish (yes... I said Romaine lettuce... NOT what you expect and a MUST ORDER!!)...... my mouth is watering just thinking about it... all the way to dessert (you MUST try the truffles with lychee vodka). The only thing I did not enjoy was the ceviche.... but that was probably because I just don't like ceviche in general, so I can't be relied upon for comparison on this.

In Las Vegas, this is only the 2nd restaurant in my 20 years of coming regularly that I've dined in that is on my MUST DINE list on each and every subsequent visit to Sin City (the other being Kraftsteak in MGM... their Platinum cut Kobe steak....!!!).

4974744,2008-07-22,0,03hgFWEcDg205hOCnswwiQ,"Birthday celebrations only come once a year, so we celebrated the Big F's day at R.E. Tapas.  With our intimate group of six, we got a chance to try a variety of their tapas.

Starting off with two pitchers of their sangria, we chose:

* R.E. Sangria ($24): ""Spanish Rioja, citrus fruits and juices, and a few other special ingredients."" - Pretty typical of your red sangria, lots of ice though.  Pretty light on the alcohol though.

* Peach Raspberry Sangria ($24): ""White Rioja, peach nectar, sliced peaches, fresh raspberries, and peach schnapps."" - A lighter fare of sangria, enjoyed by the girls in our party than the guys.  Again, light on the alcohol.

Tapas we chose: 

* Empanadas ($5): ""Stuffed with seasoned ground beef, avocado crème fraiche."" - A favorite amongst the group.  It was only one empanada cut into two pieces, so that was a bit disappointing.  Pretty simple when you think about it.

* R.E. Corn Dogs ($6): ""House made chorizo sausage, honey cilantro-corn meal battered, chipotle mustard."" - The Big F really enjoyed these corn dogs, the spiciness from the sausage and the mustard gave it the necessary bite to make it stand out from you average corn dog.  Came with three dogs.

* Shrimp and Scallop Ceviche ($7):  ""Lightly poached scallops and shrimp, marinated with citrus red onion, peppers, and cilantro."" - Uneventful, although nicely presented.  We requested some sort of bread or chips, and all they could provide were what they called 'pita chips.'  In actuality, it was just plain pita bread. 

* Albondigas ($6): ""House made, parmesan and fresh herb meatballs, baked in tomato cream sauce."" - Three meatballs in a nice sauce.

* Baked Brie ($8): ""Diced Spanish Chorizo, green onions, and fresh herbs, wrapped in puff pastry and baked golden."" - I don't remember any chorizo in the brie.  I was too focused on requesting bread or crackers to put my brie on.  They were able to provide garlic bread, but it took awhile for it to come out.  It also came with a side of leafy greens.

* Colorado Lamb Chops ($12): ""Marinated and grilled, served with agria dulce."" - Came with two chops and two dipping sauces.  I didn't get a chance to taste it though.

* Blackened Salmon Tacos ($7): ""Confetti-cabbage slaw and chipotle aioli."" - Three soft tacos with more cabbage slaw than salmon.

* Feta Fries ($7): ""Smothered with crumbled feta and spinach cream sauce."" - The one thing that our whole group could easily share without having to cut things up.  Tasty stuff because who doesn't like melted cheese on fries?

* Rolled Eggplant ($8): ""Three cheeses and herbs wrapped in pan fried eggplant, baked in red sauce."" - Looked like lasagna, not easy to share or consume.

* Mini-Herb Roasted Chicken ($9): ""Herb infused olive oil and cracked pepper."" - The worst of the dishes.  Half a chicken that looked blah on the plate and tasted even more blah if that's possible. Do not order.

* Lobster Ravioli ($7): ""Maine lobster, tarragon, brown butter and lemon."" - Three raviolis that held promise.  The one I got was cold, so the skin was hard.  However, the person who ate the one in the middle liked hers.

Moving onto dessert, the Big F wanted to try their Grilled Apricots ($6), but they were out!  In the end, we had these two:

* Three Ganache Chocolate Terrine ($5.50): ""Fresh berries, cherry crackle."" - Very cute presentation with a mix of flavors.

* Caramel Flan ($6): ""Desiccated coconut, citrus plantain chip."" - Recommended by our waitress, good overall.  Plantain chip could be done a lot better.

Food-wise, we were a bit disappointed by the serving size.  Perhaps we're used to being able to share our tapas with a group of people.  I would think there'd be at least 3-4 servings in each tapa, not two.  It would have helped if the waitress told us how many pieces were in each dish as well, so we would know how many orders to get to suit our party. 

Service-wise, we were not too impressed either.  Sure, the waitress was great about getting the candles on the dessert and surprising the birthday boy.  But she never cleared the dishes fast enough or at all.  By the time dessert shows up, you'd think all empty plates and pitchers would be cleared.  Not here unfortunately.  And as a result, our table was always so cluttered.  It was hard to find space for our dishes as they arrived, especially with the bigger than average-size plates.

Overall, R.E. Tapas was an okay experience.  They were some hits, but more misses.  It wasn't too busy when we went on Saturday night, which is nice change from Firefly on Paradise.  However, they are still in its infancy so they can only get better.  Add more alcohol to the sangria!
