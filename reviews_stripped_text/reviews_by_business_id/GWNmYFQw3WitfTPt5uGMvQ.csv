However, as it turned out, the food was terrific and the person who took and delivered my order (Alex) was so nice.  It's also worth mentioning that their order to delivery time was good.  

We had an impromptu gathering at a friend's house yesterday.  I was looking for restaurants that delivered in the area and decided on this place.  We ordered a variety of items including appetizers, soup, entrees, fried rice and lo mein.  Everything was exceptionally tasty.  The food was well prepared and not greasy; which certainly exceeded my expectations for a low to moderately priced Chinese restaurant.

Wow, this place has large portions great prices that worth every penny. 

The best thing to have when your sick is no longer chicken noodle soup. Trust me go into this place and order there hot and sour soup, not only is it the best hot sour soup in Vegas but it really makes you feel like you cured your cold with the lightly spicy and warm full filling soup. 

That dish is not even there best. They have so many to choose from its hard to pick from there full menu of pork, chicken and beef plates, noodles and rice plates, exocit plates, and appetizers. They are all great.

Most of there dishes come with a free side of white rice which just puts this place above the rest. Service is awesome for a Chinese Food restaurant, if you eat there or take out.

831157,2011-06-26,0,GWNmYFQw3WitfTPt5uGMvQ,"I rated Beijing two stars because the food was well prepared.

I tried the Spicy Seafood Noodle Soup.  The seafood: shrimp, squid, 1 mussel, as well as the vegetables and noodles were all properly cooked; that is not overcooked to the point of being unchewable or boiled into a mushy pablum.  The problem was that the soup tasted like colored water.  I doused the bowl with additional chile sauce, with more and more salt, with white pepper, and still the broth swirled in the bowl like insipid, unsteeped tea.

I also sampled the Cashew Chicken.  The dish boasted the same attributes, but suffered from the same irremedial flaw: lack of flavor.  Oh, the portion was huge, piled with cashews, but in spite of the colorful vegetables, the thin darkly colored sauce tasted very much like the soup broth.

This is a family restaurant, everyone but the dishwasher seems related.  We were seated promptly, of course, only one other person, aside from the entire restaurant staff sat in the restaurant.

Our table lacked forks or napkins, which the server did not bring, when she served the appetizer.  I finally had to rob the set-ups from another table.  I did this as the seated hostess watched with obvious ennui.

I wouldn't go back, especially since Pin Kaow, a superb Thai restaurant, sits right up the street.",vgHm8sXiGb1-w_CU66Vvdw,0,0,2,PkzWQsCagn91RT2895GBcw

Good portions of beef, with a starter of choice of soup: corn or hot n sour (honestly I don't like either so I pass) and choice of spring roll or salad (both are good).
I always add the cheese wontons (6 for $4.95).  Unfortunately/fortunately, however you want to look at it, this is an ""authentic"" employer...so I wouldn't recommend asking for things off the menu.  I asked for crab rangoons and was starred at with a blank look...repeated several times, then when I thought about it a little more and asked for cheese wontons I was met with ""ok cheese wonton"".  it's not on the menu I just always enjoy these.  no added frills to them though from here, just cream cheese in the wonton.

I read reviews that say much to the contrary and I just have to laugh.  I lived in China myself for two years. The food here is the closest to REAL Chinese food, not Americanized stuff thrown together like a Panda Express etc. where they are marketing to Americans.  

If you find that you do not like the food at Beijing, it is probably because you've never had it prepared like this before.  That's not saying there isn't a place for Panda, but don't discount Beijing if you've never tried it before because of that kind of comparison review.  

For reference, I would say I eat at this place, or have had delivery, at least 12 times per year on average over the past two years since I moved back to Vegas.  

Yes, their chairs could use a cleaning or redo; but having lived in China I recognize that this is just standard; but I am giving them the four stars for this as it is America and we do  have different standards.

Maybe dark soy sauce? And the portion size was a bit small, and I felt there could have definitely been more chicken in the dish, but altogether I was pleased with my experience.

Their lunch specials are great they are like 5 something for your entrée which is huge, plus soup or salad and a spring roll. Also while you wait for your meal you get those little crunchies to dip in the sweet and sour and hot mustard sauces. 

So far I have tried their broccoli beef, mongolian beef, house special chicken and most recently the yellow curry chicken that I got for takeout last night. Everything I have tried has been ok. The broccoli beef is broccoli beef, the house chicken is NOT spicy whatsoever and they compare it to a general chicken but it's more like a sweet sauce it has NO spice. And my bf said his chicken tasted different last night like it had already been made and sitting out for a while. Maybe that's why it took literally 5 minutes for us to pick up the food after placing an order on the phone? 

I was pleasantly surprised with the curry chicken i had last night.  It was delicious and had pineapple chunks in it! So yum. I literally didn't want to stop eating UNTIL I found a medium sized black hair floating around in the middle of my container. Boo! :/ Nothing makes me more disguted then seeing a hair in my food.

2803809,2015-03-07,1,GWNmYFQw3WitfTPt5uGMvQ,"Let me start off by saying I feel awful leaving a 2 star review for this place, especially because it's a family owned establishment and the little older lady was so sweet and was busting her butt serving the tables. 

The last time I came here was about 2 years ago and I remember it being decent. I was in the in the mood for Chinese today for lunch, so I decided to stop in. When I sat down, I immediately noticed how dirty the upholstered chairs were. And I also noticed that the customers dining there, let's just say, we're not so glamorous. I decided to look passed that and just focus on my food. 

I opted for the $5.95 lunch special, which includes your main dish, steamed rice, a bowl of soup, and a salad or egg roll. I chose shrimp with snow peas, hot & sour soup and salad. The soup was so bland and the tofu had a spongey texture. The salad was a sad plate of iceberg lettuce thrown on a plate. When I got my main dish, they accidentally gave my food to the table next to me because we both ordered shrimp dishes. No biggie, they just made me a new plate. I got my food and sprinkled some pepper on it. HUGE MISTAKE!!! The pepper had such an offensive odor that I had to scrape off the pepper I had just sprinkled. Even though I tried to scrape off the pepper, the bad smell was still there. The shrimp had a fishy taste to it, like it was old or something. I never waste food, but after about 2 shrimps and 6 snow peas, I was done eating. I literally left 6 or 7 shrimps on the plate. 

Like I said, this is a family owned business and grandma was working so hard to take everyone's orders. I feel bad for leaving a 2 star review. Hopefully they read this and work to improve the quality.",BI4jBJVto2tEQ0NiaR0rNQ,7,0,2,OA7nLGRuBwwGJfQeZ128kQ

Jajang Myun was bland and not enough sauce. The Gan Jajang did have more of that wok flavor that I was looking for, but it just didn't have that flavor we crave. The Champong was the same way. It was about 85% right with shrimp, scored calamari, and muscle, but not quite right with imitation crab meat and cabbage.

The main beef that my family had was with the noodles. It's kinda flat like linguini and didn't have a chewy texture. It was mushy. The girl behind the counter said they machine make their noodles, which is fine. Hand pulled noodles are rare even at Korean owned Chinese restaurants, but there's a definite difference in the texture from Korean machined noodles. That really took away from the experience.

Jjampong-Spicy seafood noodle soup, with a flavorful broth.  We have tried other korean, korean/chinese restaurant, and this bowl of noodle soup is usually JUST spice, not much of any flavor.  Here, you can taste the spice, plus the nice sweet seafood soup.  Note, the bowl is freakin huge!!!!!  Definitely more bang for your buck.

Jjang myun-noodles with black bean sauce, small bitty chunks of tender pork and shredded veggies.  Once again, have tried at many restaurants, but this place has got to be the best!  I love it here.  So yummy.  I started liking jjang myun because of this place.

Orange flavored beef-ok ok...I know, this might not be the typical dish that an asianized asian girl like me would order, but please read on...So anyways, I enjoyed this place's orange beef the most, due to the beef thinly sliced and nicely batter fried so that each bite, there is the crispiness of the outside and the tender beef  in the inside.  Other places that I have tried is unable to get the crispiness on batter, and worse, the chewy  meat in the middle.  That's no bueno.  I got this today  for lunch instead of my Jjang myun, but no worries, I will be back soon for that.  

The lunch special is $5.95 for the entree, plus an egg roll/salad, and a soup.  In addition, they give you a small bowl of pickled daikon and their kim chi (preserved cabbage).  The kim chi complimented my orange beef very well.

4655195,2014-05-21,5,GWNmYFQw3WitfTPt5uGMvQ,"TWO OUT OF THREE AIN'T BAD

   In recent times, I have dining here three times and in Christmas Day 2012 for lunch. I have sampled three entrees: shrimp with lobster sauce, pepper steak, and spicy eggplant. Two of the three entrees were delicious and one was ok. The shrimp with lobster sauce was delicious. The next time I eat here, it will most likely be the dish that I order. For the record this is the first Chinese restaurant that I recall in Vegas where the shrimp based entrees are the exact price as the other entrees. The pepper steak was also delicious. But the shrimp with lobster sauce was better, in my opinion. However, the spicy eggplant was ok. It could have been softer and tastier. Two entrees tasting delicious out of three ain't bad.

  The lunch special is a good deal that ends at 3 pm. The specials go for $5.95. As I wrote, they included shrimp based entrees that are usually 50 cents more at the competition. The lunch specials include white rice, corn soup or hot and sour soup, and an egg roll of the spring roll variety. A cold beverage increases the lunch special to $8 before the tip. 

  As an observant yelper I notice a couple of things. The portions are smaller than the competition, however, there is none of the filler chow mien noodles that some restaurants fill half the plate with. This is the only Chinese restaurant where fried rice or brown rice is missing from the luncheon special. I could eat white rice as long as it has soy sauce on it. Its just that fried rice and brown rice are far tastier and when I go out to eat in a Chinese restaurant, I prefer the tastiest rice.

  Beijing Chinese Restaurant is in the Eastern Be ltway Shopping Center. It is away from the Walmart madness but very close to the Eastern Avenue madness right off the Interstate 215 exit.

  I rate Beijing Chinese Restaurant 3 stars, equivalent to a ""B."" I'd like to conclude this review with a tip. If you catch the lunch special save your appetite for the German Bakery nextstore.",0tvCcnfJnSs55iB6mqPk3w,7,7,3,LyeFlSvZ_CwRb1frnAIfRA

Driver speaks no English, walked right into our home although we were on the porch, to pack the food we had already opened back up to deliver. We checked the order that was supposed to be ours and it was missing one of the items. He couldn't understand us at all and he had lost his phone. He borrowed my fiances phone to I thought call the restaurant but he walked out to his car with it and called his own phone with ours to find his instead. Then we talked to the restaurant on his phone at which time we couldn't communicate we were missing an item well. Finally we got that communicated and they said they would come back with our missing item after they deliver the other order (that we had already opened in our home). At this point I had already signed someone else's receipt so I had to sign ours. I didn't put a tip on the new receipt because frankly this was not good service. He pointed at the tip line indicating to leave a tip! Ends with, it's now been over and hour and the missing item hasn't been delivered.

So I found out this was an alternative Chinese delivery restaurant to Cook on Wok up the street on Eastern.  Also, if you spend 40 bucks, they give you a free entree so I decided to give them a try.

There were some hits and misses.  I ordered way too much food to hit the 40 dollars though and ended up having enough food for over a week.  The portions are huge.

Here is a rundown of what I had:

*Spring rolls - nothing special here but were tasty. 
*Lemon Chicken - really overcooked and awful.  Had to throw some of this away.  Sauce was just grease and no lemon flavor.
*Orange Beef - very very very overcooked but flavor was good.  Actually tasted really good as leftovers.  I prefer Cook on Wok's to this big time.
*Sesame Chicken - this was the standout dish, really was one of the best sesame chicken dishes I have had.  
*Shrimp with Snow Peas - Very well cooked and very tasty.  Much better than Cook on Wok's version.  Shrimp was big, and I was very satisfied with the medley of vegetables in this dish.
*Combination Fried Rice - One of the better fried rice dishes I have had so far.

I would order here again but I would only order the sesame chicken, the shrimp with snow peas, and the combo fried rice.  The rest I would order from cook on wok.  I'm still looking for other places to do chinese delivery from (damn China a go go won't deliver down past Horizon Ridge).",PomQayG1WhMxeSl1zohAUA,0,1,3,jrVo_v63kR84TdUnvNxzbw
5567410,2010-12-07,9,GWNmYFQw3WitfTPt5uGMvQ,"This is my review of 'Beijing Chinese Cuisine' (as other yelper mentioned before),,,the one right next to Sin City Sushi :P 
I am very pleased to write this review(even though it's past my bed time-.-;;;;) I FINALLY found a great place to taste Korean-Chinese cuisine in town. I've been tried so many different places in the past but I couldn't find the one that has the genuine taste of Korean-Chinese dishes in Las Vegas. 
I was highly recommended this place by good friend of mine to try some Jjamppong, Jjajangmyun, and Mandu! 

Growing up in Korea, I have early memories of eating Jjamppong, Jjajangmyun, & Mandu all the tme. It was a ubiquitous dish, not to mention cheap. Occassionally, my family had ordered it for delivery, the delivery man would carry the food in a big tin box with handles, on a motorcycle :P The noodles came in actual bowls, so after finish eating our delicious meal, we'd have to put the dirty dishes outside by the door(usually don't need to wash the bowls for them), so that the delivery man could come back for it later to pick up. I assume this is no longer the case in the State, haha :D 

Some people might ask,""What is Korean-Chinese Cuisine?"" Well, it is originated from traditional Chinese dishes but has been influenced by local ingredients in Korea. Because of the closeness in place, most Korean-Chinese dishes are traced from Northern styles of Chinese cuisine such as Beijing, Tianjin, and Shandong cuisine and these three are the best known regional cuisines of Northern China. Korean-chinese cuisine was born when Chinese immigrants settled in Korea in the 19th century, and 2005 marked the 100th anniversary of this popular dishes, according to wikipedia :) 

Ok,, now the highlights of K-C dishes~ 
---Jjamppong(a spice noodle soup flavored with all the vegetables, Seafood, meat, & chilly oil): You can ask a server how spice you want from mild to very spicy :) It was a perfect right amount of spiciness and rich flavor of the broth. OMG!! 
---Jjajangmyun(a steamed noodle in black bean sauce, with diced pork, onion, potato, & garlic,,serves with cucumber pieces on top): not salty at all, all the ingredients were blended well together and gave a perfect taste of Jjajangmyun! 
---Mandu(home made pork dumpling or goyza :P, either boiled-Mul-Mandu, steamed-Jjin-Mandu, grilled or fried-Gun-Mandu): I recommend these dishes to try with a dipping sauce of soysauce and vinegar that you can easily find on the table. I tried their Jjin-Mandu. I really loved their Mandu!!!  It was a real homemade dumpling that my mom and grandma would make it back home. It seemed like they put right amount of pork, cabbage, onion, garlic, scallion, Korean leek, clear noodle, tofu, & etc,. 
As might be expected, it came with pickled radish (with a splash of vinegar) and kimchi, yay 

The people next to me, they were looking at my Jjajangmyun and asked what I was having...All of a sudden, they put aside their menus and ended up getting the same dishes as mine. I was glad that they also loved their dishes admitting first time trying out Korean-Chinese Cuisine for them. The owner came by the table a couple of times and was very friendly. According to her story, she is a main chef and now she has been teaching her son to be a good chef of Korean-Chinese cuisine :) If you eager to have K-C cuisine that you usually tried back home or simply you are craving for some good K-C cuisine, go for it!",h0wxG2EiDLhgKjIzI8j2Mg,15,10,5,4n0nrsBgdwqQ2WpXiB_1UA

The soup was bland, the egg roll was basic frozen, but the worst offense was the steamed rice. So inedible. It was dry and tasted 2-3 days old. The shrimp entree was too salty and the chicken dish did not have much chicken and was in a nothing brown sauce. 

This is not Chinese food and even for Americanized Chinese food you are better off at Panda Express!

The spicy eggplant was good, but I feel like it's hard to mess that dish up. The mongolian beef on the other hand was sub-par. It was essentially all onion, with the occasional piece of meat. The lunch specials are $5.95 and include a generous entree portion, white rice, and a tiny egg roll. Soup is included when you dine in, but it's about a $1 extra for take out.

The food was fine, nothing special, and actually the sweet & sour sauce was actually terrible and extremely artificial tasting. Like kool-aid or something. But the thing that stuck with me the most was the staff, and probably not a great way. I don't know if he was the owner, manager, or what.... But there was this older white man walking around to tables asking how everything was and confusing many people like me. He wasn't in any sort of uniform or anything- just your average Joe. 

Also, our waitress was hovering around our table watching us like a hawk to see if we needed anything else at all, and wasn't afraid to share her opinion on the food we were eating (at one point she almost touched our food during her excitement to explain everything).
