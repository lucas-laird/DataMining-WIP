My biggest issue with them is the meat wasn't that great on them and it is in large chunks which just doesn't move with the nachos. Ps these things are huge I ate it for dinner and had over half the pan (that's right they come out in a huge pan) left.

Monday nights they roast a whole pig. My husband had the 4 oz which comes with veggies. Luckily he wasn't too hungry so it was great. He said the taste was really good.

The others in our party had a burger and brisket. Both got thumbs up.

Cool casual atmosphere and plenty tvs if you're trying to watch a game.",oOtNQXoD-aqzI07e5JQ4EQ,0,0,4,VgOBP6L3Dtn4Zhl8l7qZag

81107,2013-07-18,0,YnmtUJGqQIQL9tz1MRyfqA,"This restaurant was always packed with people since it opened, so I was excited when I got a chance to try out their food. I went with a couple of my friends on a weekend at night during peak hour, so I expected it to be pretty busy. 

First off, I love love love the atmosphere. I loved the ambiance of the restaurant, and I loved how it mixed the old-traditional pub look with a more modern touch. I also found the little window in to the kitchen area very entertaining. It was a bit loud when we were there but that's because it was a Saturday night, so it was to be expected.

The food was great! They were HUGE portions, so I do suggest that you share your food if you typically can't finish things that you order. Most of their food are burgers and fries, but they do have different options like steaks, fish & chips, lobster rolls, etc. Also they have unique touches to their burgers/sandwiches like the peanut butter crunch burger. I got the bacon cheeseburger and it was absolutely amazing. The saltiness of the bacon was nicely balanced with the perfectly seasoned meat patty. It wasn't too salty or too seasoned. I also got the Mac & Cheese as side with my burger, and it was so creamy and delicious! Loved it! Before that we got the stuffed devil's eggs for appetizers. It was light and creamy, but I only wish they gave us more! The dessert was my F.A.V.O.R.I.T.E part. We ordered a chocolate cake and a lemon sponge cake, both were amazing! Each cake, or rather each dessert, came with a little mini milk shake that complimented whatever dessert you got, so the chocolate cake came with a chocolate shake and the lemon sponge cake came with like a light lemon-y shake. I thought that was absolutely cute and unique, and for the price I think it's worth it. (If you're a chocolate or heavy sweet addict like me, I recommend the chocolate cake!) 

The prices weren't too bad, for a casual restaurant on the strip at a hotel. The price range is from $8 to $47($47 being the highest on the menu). Their burgers & entrees ranged from $15 to $32. The steaks are the most expensive: ranging from $32 to $47, but like I said the portion sizes are huge so you can share. 

As for the service, it was PERFECT. My friend had a different experience, but I think she just overreacted to things. I mean it was pretty busy when we came, and we were very demanding. We asked for napkins, straws, ranch dressing, separate spoons for desserts, etc. We kept ordering things at different times, but the staff was amazing. They were friendly and got everything we asked for. They were very attentive to our needs. 

The reason I rated this down a star is because I wished they would've asked me how I wanted my burger. I thought it'd come out rare like it usually does, but it came out medium-rare, so I wished they would've asked me before I ordered it. Also each of my friends had different types of fries, for instance I hand regular french fries, another one of us had potato wedges, another one had something totally different. I wished they would've asked us what kind of fries we wanted or at least indicted what type of fries our entrees came with on the menu. One last thing is that the fish & chips cost like $24, but you only get like 3 pieces of fish & a whole basket full of potatoes, so that was a bit disappointing, but other than that my whole experience was fantastic. 

This is a great restaurant if you want to hang out with friends, relax, and grab a burger and chill! My recommendations would be to definitely try the desserts and get the Mac & Cheese as a side!",jKwn6UYaJXIigu2hp0ylKw,2,0,4,UuNuh3YkSwC5lPLEfxkd_A
124325,2013-07-26,1,YnmtUJGqQIQL9tz1MRyfqA,"At first glance 1842 has a nice 'old' pub style to its interior, but upon closer inspection it feels not much better than a glorified Applebee's. There are some neat light fixtures, but lots of hard surfaces, mostly oversized booths and a really odd back bar make this for a strange replacement to the classy interior that was Nobhill. The restaurant is located in the middle of restaurant row and picks up huge crowds from the convention center and MGM Grand Arena, so plan accordingly if you're there during a peak period. I was there on a weekday at noon and was able to get a seat right away, but just 10 minutes later some convention broke for lunch and there was a line out the door. There are way too many items to list on the menu, but many of them sound great. Now that I've gotten a burger out of the way, I'll have to head back for the fried homemade pickles and lobster corn dogs at a minimum.

Out of the several burgers they offer, I went with the one that sounded the most interesting, the peanut butter crunch burger with bacon jam and potato chips. Upon first bite I was hit with a fantastic beef and char flavor that instantly brought me back to the Nobhill burger I enjoyed so much, but things changed a bit from there. Don't get me wrong, I really enjoyed this burger but it had some flaws if I'm going to be my nit-picking self. The bun was a bit too thick and dry, which didn't help with a burger that has peanut butter as one of its main toppings. As I said the meat had excellent flavor, was cooked well, but this was not a juicy patty at all. The bacon jam had great flavor, and really paired well with the potato chips even though you can't taste them too well in the mix. Overall this assembly is just naturally not very moist, and loses something for me. The two people I had lunch with both ordered a bacon cheeseburger, and theirs looked so much juicier than mine. I'd love to come back and sample both that one and the 1842 burger in the near future. All of the right flavors are there; I know they can most likely still produce something fantastic.

Unfortunately the fries seemed somewhat of the generic frozen variety; they weren't quite as good as before, but had a good rosemary flavor and were cooked well. I really wished for something a little more original when paired with something as odd as a burger with bacon jam, peanut butter and potato chips on it. As for the price, $17 seems way too steep for this burger, with a couple of them at $18 on their menu. I understand that this is a convention centric dining spot, and I get that strategy, but it's still a bit hard to cough up that kind of money for a burger. Plus if you consider that their last restaurant, which was arguably fancier and more intimate served what was possibly a better burger for $15, it makes this a bit more troubling. Regardless, Pub 1842 seems to have quite a good menu, and seems to offer several really good burgers, so if you're at MGM Grand you probably won't find a better offering.",0G9BcXSQscv_GnhlNwFfjw,5,2,3,3Pk1sZ53aRezbYZ_1VnsBg

165945,2016-02-03,0,YnmtUJGqQIQL9tz1MRyfqA,"The only reason that I did not give this five stars was because of the ambience and seating - Yes I know it's a pub but could have been configured in a more appealing comfortable way.  But to the good part.......I was in the mood for steak...Not fine dining $$$$ but a decent piece of meat.  I was glad to see the 100z flatiron served with spicy fries.  I was expecting a flat but tender piece of meat.  OMG not flat - about a half inch cooked to perfection - seasoned to perfection - melt in my mouth steak!  I did not care for the dipping sauce, but the steak did not need any kind of sauce.  Fries were good nice and thin and crispy but very spicy.  

Service was great, our waiter was local (we are too) and a certified beer server.  He was very knowledgeable about beers and made great suggestions with great descriptions of the taste.  He was also quite willing to provide a taste of several beers before settling on a selection.  He was enthusiastic about both the great food and the great cold beers, a very good ambassador for Michael Mina's meats!

We ate/drank at the bar each time.  They are hustling behind that bar...busy, busy, but not too busy to be nice.  Our server the first two times was Amanda.  She kept a good eye on us and gave great service. Our third time two different guys waited on us, our receipt says ""Bill"" - they were great.   I like that they have hooks to hang your purse on at the bar.  My husband liked the multiple televisions with sports on (although his Packers lost...boo!).   He also liked their beer selection. They are happy to put your drink in plastic cup to go if you have to be headed somewhere else.   When I think pub food, I think heavy, greasy, and fried...(nothing against that, but we were there for an event and wanted our evening clothes to fit when we put them on).  We ordered the Crab Louis deviled eggs on 2 different days.  They are delicious and served on little bib lettuce leaves.  They put the eggs on a little bit of the stuffing so that they don't slide around.  That little bit of egg, wrapped up in the bib lettuce, was a nice little bonus.  We shared a wedge salad and had them add steak ($12 extra). The salad was really good.  The big chunks of bacon were to die for!  I asked if they made a BLT w/ that bacon - our server said only on Sunday and Monday brunch - so we had missed out.  A must-try next time.  We ordered a lobster roll to share the next time.  I always thought a lobster roll was on a roll or a hoagie type bread.  This came on toasted, sandwich type bread.  It was really good, just not what I pictured.  They had it split in two for us since they knew we were sharing.  They are attentive on making sure each person has their own plate when sharing, and also attentive making sure there were napkins (cloth) and silverware as needed.  This was a fun place to hang out and I would definitely go back.",uiYda9QG9Z_VR02RekklmQ,3,1,4,kdAwO7KUbKS6fxV-9YbYQw

728866,2013-06-27,1,YnmtUJGqQIQL9tz1MRyfqA,"I was very excited to taste Michael Mina's new concept. I went with a group of 4, we were sat in a booth close to the hallway. I am aware that they are doing 1,000 covers a day, so I do know that they are in the weeds all day long and the restaurant is turn and burn. We ordered cocktails, and I took the server's advice and ordered the very first one on the cocktail menu. Bad choice, probably one of the worst cocktails I've had, and I love ginger beer so I was very excited, but ended up with lime water. 

 We all ordered different appetizers to share, fried pickles, pretzels, nachos, lobster corn dog, duck spring rolls, and green chili. The pickle batter, was disappointingly soggy, and the sauce that is served with it was like straight up mayo, but on the upside the lobster corn dog was very good, it didn't sound too great to me but it tasted awesome, crispy batter, tasty center, good sauce too!! The nachos were good, served on a quarter sheet pan which I thought was pretty cool. The duck spring rolls were a little too greasy, and not such a huge fan of the Mae Ploy kind of sauce. The green chili was good , the only thing with all of the appetizers was the temperature, I'm sure they can't hold too many things under the heat lamps due to space and volume, but it all would have been better if it was a bit hotter.

 Next, the entrees that we ordered were the chicken, the burger, and a lobster roll, with broccolini and magical mushrooms. the chicken was overcooked, the burger was not too great, the lobster roll was pretty good, nice brioche bun crispy and very filling. The fries that accompanied the roll were exceptionally good, I was full but I could not stop eating them, The broccolini was charred, and the magical mushrooms were inedible, they tasted like someone put a piece of charcoal in your mouth. I'm sure that's not what they were aiming for. 

The desserts were both great, we had a lemon cake which we cleaned the plate, and the roasted peach & almond buckle, at this point I could hardly breathe, but still had to try dessert, and I was very glad I did, it was all great. 

On another note, our server was great, she was super nice and knowledgeable about the menu, she stopped by constantly to see that we were doing ok. The reason I would not return was the noise level, I realize that there are a lot of people sitting down, but I felt like I was in a sports stadium I had to plug my ears all through the night, because the table behind us was screaming at the TV. Very annoying to have to put up with when all you wanted to do was enjoy dinner with friends. I'm sure they can't do much to fix that though.",lerZc5wx9j5eQICt7mdS0Q,1,0,3,MLPPGyNBagqRCJ2bTw_UcQ

We were just relaxing browsing the menu and ordered the lobster corn dogs for an app. They came out quickly and weren't very hot or fresh.  Nothing great about them at all which was a disappointment as we had read other reviews raving about them. There was also a small piece of shell in one of them. The server stopped by twice to see if we were ready to place our entree order yet and once again seemed irritated that we weren't decided. We were simply looking over everything and wanted to try something different, not the usual burgers we can get anywhere. Finally decided on the turkey burger and the peanut butter burger for both of us to share. They once again came out very quick. The peanut butter was interesting,  not my favorite as it was caked on and made my mouth stick together. It overpowered the entire hamburger and other toppings. I tried scraping some off to no avail. Oh well, the point was to try something new so at least now I can say I've had peanut butter and bacon jam on a burger!  The turkey burger was delicious.  Loads of flavor, a tad dry but that's usually the case with turkey and the sauce evened it out. My favorite part of the meal was by far the fries! Hot, crispy,  perfectly seasoned.

I went in with my Girlfriend  and we sat at the bar because the restaurant was so busy. ( THIS IS A GREAT THING IT MUST MEAN THE RESTAURANT IS DOING THINGS RIGHT) So to start off I have to say I'm glad they kept the open kitchen from the old restaurant SEABLUE. The decor of the restaurant was hands down stunning and all the funny quotes on the walls were great. The vibe of the restaurant was running smooth I saw staff laughing and having a great time, managers running around and helping with serving food and cleaning tables. ( You don't see that at many places great job to the team ) Well the music was not as loud as I thought it was going to be, I could still hear all the people cheering for their Hockey teams on the TV. This was fun and great. With that being said the bartender gave us menus and a drink list. This place had some cocktails that I can't wait to go back and try. I stuck to the beer, if you are headed to this place start off with the Shinner very light it was a great beer to start with after a hot day out by the pool crisp, light and had me wanting to drink more. Second I had the Abby this was a little more on the darker side but not to heavy it had hints of maple, caramel and very toasty another great choice. My girlfriend had one of the punches ""nacho libre"" great name right. It was a tequila based cocktail with port and topped with a sprig of cilantro. It tasted as great as it smelled. For food we had the crab cake. The crab cake was not fishy like most of them in this world are but very fresh crab meat that stood out, the crust of the crab cake was very like and not greasy very tasty and I would say its a must order. We had to try the frickles ( yes fried pickles ) I've had these one time only in DC and they sliced very thin. Well at Pub 1842 they serve the whole pickle sliced in quarters and then fried. Wow hands down Amazing. We also order the fish n chips. They use cod for the fish n chips and they were cooked to perfection golden in color and very tasty. The house maid tarter sauce was great and the hand cut fries let's just say WOW. I can't wait to go back and try more food, great cocktails and great beers.

We got:
-Shelfish platter
-crabcakes

992608,2014-09-18,0,YnmtUJGqQIQL9tz1MRyfqA,"Years ago, Seablue at MGM was one of our favorite restaurants. It had great seafood Mediterranean influence and everything was light and healthy. It has since switched gears, the space closed for a brief time and re-opened, last summer, as yet another Gastropub. Burger and pizza joints have monopolized the dining scene on the strip much to my chagrin. Michael Mina joined the trend with Pub 1842. 

The space has a great pub feel. Servers were quick and friendly. The draft beer selection was a bit lacking, but they did offer Weihenstephaner ($12) which is a solid choice. Beers were on special during our visit, buy one, get one. 

I have a weakness for all things duck. So, the spring rolls ($16) were an easy choice when it came to choosing an appetizer. They offered a Bourbon Burger ($19) on special. Which Frank was unable to resist, he's been hooked on Maker's Mark since our tour in KY earlier this year. I chose the 1842 Burger. 

The spring rolls failed to impress, they fell into the category of your typical pub grub offering. The 1842 is served in a basket (awkward for eating) and comes with caramelized onions, sautéed mushrooms and a truffle aioli. I was offered cheese, but Swiss was not an option and it was what sounded most appealing. I had requested the burger to be cooked medium, but it was a poor choice. It was well done. It was dry. The bun was dry. And I found the truffle aioli to be far more tangy than expected and the truffle flavor was very faint. I struggled to eat half of it before throwing in the towel. The Bourbon Burger was a better choice, but still left Frank pretty underwhelmed. Both burgers came with a generous portion of seasoned fries. 

The prices are inflated and the menu items do not warrant the price. I've always been a big fan of Michael Mina restaurants, but this one missed the mark. It's really quite sad that Seablue shuttered for this.",ZsUSGU1-L1ImomLZjXxxTg,1,0,2,pbUILej_eMmLd8NXREzFVQ

Now the bad part of the service is that I felt rushed when I was there and the people who were tending our table looked like they hated their lives. When they brought out our food it seemed like the guy just threw my friends food on the table instead of placing it down gently. Then when they came back out to refill our cups of water, the guy looked annoyed and just so cold. Not even a friendly smile or anything.

As I reached for my napkin to wipe up the mess, my bartender immediately sprung into action to contain the spill. Seconds later, a guy dressed in a suit (I'm guessing the MOD) walked towards me.

At this point, I'm thinking, ""Well, time to be told I'm drunk and get thrown out.""

The suit instructs me to please put down my napkin, and let his staff handle the clean up. Then, to my utter surprise, he apologizes to me, and says he would like to place a new order for everything.

Whenever I go to Vegas, the friends that I prefer to hang out with will live and die by MGM.  We went here looking for an okay spot for dinner, and it was a really disappointing experience.

At first, the service seemed good.  Our hostess was very welcoming as she led us to our booth, and I'll tell you -- in public, me and the guys are quite cool to be around.  But we never saw our server again.

I ordered a ""Homemade Fireball"" because it's a favorite of us back home, but it was horrible.  We had no chase either.  Disgusting.

I ordered a rack of ribs, which is usually conservative choice because you can't really grill those wrong, so it was good.  My friend had some nachos to start and those were great, but he didn't enjoy his entree--I think it was tuna.  My other friend didn't enjoy his prime rib either.

We don't usually box stuff, but that's what we ended up doing.

Their sound kept going in and out for some strange reason.  I didn't mind it mostly being off as I don't care much for loud environments.

We sat at the bar hoping to take advantage of some happy hour specials, but unfortunately there wasn't really anything that appealed to us on the happy hour menu.  Drink wise, there really wasn't much that appealed to me.  I like my craft cocktails and they really seem to focus on beer and mules here.  I saw pictures of lots of fabulous looking cocktails, but unfortunately none were on the menu when I was here.  I asked the bartender about them and he said they regularly update their cocktail menu, which makes sense, though I must admit I was hoping he would offer to make of the old ones.  Usually, they still can.  
I had the grilled cheese on rye and tomato soup.  This was listed as a snack/small bite, but I thought the portion was pretty good.  I didn't finish the whole thing.  I'm not usually a big fan of rye bread, but it worked beautifully with the cheeses they used and the tomato soup which was excellent.  I would absolutely order this again.  
My fiancé had the brisket which was good.  I'm very particular when it comes to brisket, so I thought it was okay, but he really enjoyed it.

The bacon Gouda burger was sweet and didn't taste savory like a burger should. It had the same flavor or something as the smoked marinara and the same as the fries.

Great beer selection. Beers served in cold steins. The Pilsner Urquell is listed in red on the menu. I had to ask and the server told me it was because the beer was from 1842 which is same as the restaurant. I just went with it. Beer was served at perfect temp in chilled stein. 

I wanted to order the Mac Attack burger, featured as their BOTM. I just missed it and they were all out. I decided to go with the salmon burger. I know it sounded strange to me too but it was freakin amazing. The salmon was cooked perfectly. It was paired with some spicy kimchee and a few other ingredients to give it a wonderful flavor. I ate half as a burger and the other half I took out the salmon and left the bread. Burgers come with fries or you can substitute salad or other side for additional charge. I went with corn off the cob. Order the corn. Mixed with some mayo and cheese. Good stuff. My bro had the Peanut butter flavored burger. He enjoyed it as well. 

The burgers run from $18-$24. Not cheap but well worth it. I thought it was a little pricey for 2 burgers and 4 beers. Came out to just under $100 before tip. Luckily, my bro treated for my b-day and he cleaned up at the sportsbook. 

Service was great. The server helping us gave lots of recommendations and did not rush us at all. I thought it was cool that they allowed us, as well as the other patrons to enjoy our dining experience. I would go back and give it another try.

We only got half an order of nachos, but it was still very filling between the five of us as an appetizer. 

For my meal, I got the 1842 burger. It was cooked to perfection (at least it seemed that way at the time), and the mushrooms and caramelized onions went perfectly with the bleu cheese. I wanted to sub out the bleu cheese for American, and the waitress deterred me. I was glad that I took her advice. The fries that were served with it were crispy and flavorful. The leftovers made for a wonderful midnight snack.

Despite the meal's excellence, I was so disappointed to feel like absolute crap the next day. All five of us got sick.

The fish tacos came recommended by the bar tender. So we ordered those too. Wrapped in  standard grocery store tortillas, they were room temp and stale. They could not hold up to the filling inside, as they fell apart one bite into the taco. The fish and mushy, not flaky and tender. The soggy breading lacked much seasoning.

Michael Mina does it again with his inspiring, fresh and unique menu! He never seems to disappoint. The restaurant decor is beautiful and the staff is spot on like usual. It is so nice to go to a restaurant in which the staff is well educated on the menu and knows what they are talking about. It is frustrating when you go to a restaurant and the wait staff is unable to answer basic questions about the menu. That is definitely not the case here. Our waiter was able to answer all the questions our group had and also give us some of his recommendations. He was extremely knowledgeable, friendly and spot on with his service.  

The burgers are phenomenal! I grubbed on the 1842 burger which was packed with flavor and cooked to perfection! The patty was juicy and the mushrooms and truffle aioli puts it over the top- in a good way of course!  I mean who doesn't love truffle? YUM! Other winners were the homemade frickles and 1842 nachos. Living in Texas, I can be quite picky when it comes to fried pickles. Not many places know how to do them right. They have to be the perfect medium of crunchy yet juicy inside. 1842 has it down!!! The special sauce is unreal and gives it just the right blend of sweet and salty. The nachos came out hot and crispy. Often times when you order nachos the chips can get watered  down and soggy from the beans and salsa on top. One of my fav places for nachos on the strip is Margaritaville, but I have to say 1842 gives them a run for their money! They are not as large of a portion, but the twist they put on ordinary nachos is unforgettable and delicious! 

The moscow mule is very tasty! Another pet peeve I have is when places put too much ginger beer in the moscow mules. This place knows how to mix it just right and they serve the drink how it should be served- copper mugs!! 

I am excited this place has joined the MGM scene and will definitely be a returning customer when I am in Vegas. I can't wait to try more items each time.

Michael Mina is not the first Chef one would think of when it comes to a Gastropub experience but perhaps that is the point in Pub 1842 - forward thinking execution meets Pub Grub. The interior is meticulously clean and reminiscent of The Yard House with a Vegas flair to it that almost begs one to order a libation. The service is top notch, as would be with any institution with Mina's name slapped on it and the price point is fair for the quality with most offerings being in the sub-$20.00 area. 

I stopped in with a good friend for lunch and found immediate seating with perfect sightlines to the countless OLED televisions around the expansive U-shaped Bar. I ordered the Steak Frites ($32.00) and the order appeared within a short 10-minute window after my IPA arrived. 

Pub 1842's Steak Frites are a very basic affair including a 10 ounce Flat Iron Steak (cooked well north of the ordered Medium Rare), an Arugula Salad, and Barbecue spiced Fries with a side of house-made Steak Sauce. The Steak quality and seasoning were both superb, however, the execution of temperature was anything but. The Fries are a ho-hum experience that gets a bit better when they are dipped in the supplied Barbecue Sauce. As far as Steak Frites goes, this was a rather amateurish attempt considering the name branding and associated costs but I wasn't completely unsatisfied with my lunch - I just expected more from a restaurant bearing Mina's name. 

Perhaps I ordered poorly, I have noticed most Yelpers rave about the Burgers and Barbecue. I will go that route upon my return but until then I can only muster a 3-star, A-Okay for Pub 1842 at the MGM Grand.",sGJvx1MTsetDzsnrHfJHLg,29,23,3,NK9Lz3NcscBqfwBMxGtA-A

Also, you're able to order from the HH menu TO-GO, which is unheard of elsewhere- and appreciated. 

LOBSTER GRILLED CHEESE $9; smallish sandwich served with a veritable mountain of seasoned fries. Combining cheese and seafood is always a little dicey in my book but this dish does it well. Sadly, the fries, though plentiful and visibly seasoned, lacked flavor and crisp. They also do not reheat well, consider yourself warned.

KOREAN PORK RIBS: $11, four ribs with gochujang glaze served with peanuts and mint. Or they're supposed to. Mine came sad and lonely on a plate with zero presentation. Admittedly I ordered them right before HH ended but presentation should still be consistent and the additional components likely would have made the dish much better. As it was, I wouldn't rush to order them again but did find them to be a bit meatier than expected. Flavor was one-note, sauce seemed to be sriracha-based, wouldn't order again.

CINNAMON HARLOT: $7 George Dickel rye whiskey simple syrup, cinnamon. A simple sipping drink, very strong, ordered on the rocks and got a cool boulder of ice in my glass. Not wanting to be plastered after one drink, I asked for it to be diluted with Sprite, which is apparently fairly common. Decent flavor but not something I'd get again.

SANGRIA: $8 red red wine, velvet falernum spiced rum, blackberry liqueur, lemon. It's rare for me to find a sangria I don't like, so I really enjoyed this drink much more than the Harlot. Fruity and strong with bold flavors, decent drink size too.

Service bumped up the score higher than the product alone- bartender was attentive and friendly, accommodated my HH order for takeout and fixed my drink to my liking. I'd come back for other apps or a burger in the future.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,10,7,3,KxXSbUg5-Rbmm5rfZc13PA

Unfortunately Sea Blue has now been replaced with Pub 1842. We were extremely excited to try this pub, and even made reservations months before. But, that's pretty much where the excitement wore off; This place was one of the worst dining experiences we've all had, not just in Vegas.

First off, the table taps looked pretty sweet, but right out of the gate they were out of Weihenstephaner.

For starters we went with some Homemade Frickles, Hot Salted Pretzels with 'Merican beer cheese, poached egg, and an order of Duck Spring Rolls.

Our Frickles were extremely bland and no one wanted to finish them. At least they were hot, as our order of Pretzels and Spring Rolls were cold. After we sent them back, we didn't get a poached egg in the cheese when they returned with a new one. Since they were kind of hot, well, lukewarm I'd say, we just shrugged it off. The Spring Rolls were bland as well, but that was only the beginning.

For our main entrees, not one person out of the group of six enjoyed theirs.

The Wedge Salad featured huge, undercooked, fatty bacon that ended up lining the edges of the bowl. Even a waitress was hard pressed not to notice.

The Mac & Cheese was bland and had too much black truffle. When I was younger I use to think, 'How can you screw up a Mac & Cheese?' but in my years I've grown to know that it's the simple dishes that are hard to execute and easy to muck up. Even in a group of 6, we barely ate half of it, and left the rest.

After seeing the bacon that accompanied the Wedge salad, we were quite scared at what The Smoked Bacon Burgers would look like. Both of them came out extremely rare after they were ordered as medium rare. Another send back. Fries? Just ok. Lukewarm at best.

The Heritage Turkey Burger had so much lettuce on it while The Smoked Bacon Burgers had so little, we all joked that the Turkey Burger ran off with their lettuce. Half of the Turkey Burger was left. Doggie Bag? Ya, right.

As it stands, we left the best for last: Magical Mushrooms. The faces each of us made after trying a bite of these was priceless. The Mushrooms had a really foul after taste and almost tasted of burnt meat. Obviously they were extremely overcooked, and it was hard to pinpoint the angle Pub 1842 was going for these. I would have been much happier with some awesome salted, buttery, and fresh herb mushrooms rather than whatever these 'Magical' Mushrooms were put out to be. They were so bad that we had to tell the waitress of how foul they tasted. No joke, all six of us spit them up into our napkins. A sight to behold.

Even our pickles were past their expirations and just plain uneatable.

Our waitress was super nice, but her attitude completely changed after we sent back some of the items. Since we were in a group of six and had to catch the hockey game after (FROZEN FURY!), we really tried our hardest to stomach most of the dishes since we wouldn't have time to eat anything else before the drop of the puck.

Once the time came for the check, the waitress dropped it on the table and literally ran the other direction without making eye contact or saying a word. It was quite clear that she wanted to move on past this experience with a blind eye. I have to admit, so did we.

What started out really bad, ended even worse. We all hated the food so much that you couldn't convince any of us to come back, even for a free meal.",XQ-kvSPLSBPiivNpt9GyuQ,5,0,1,ciYdVYad3igZBYou-oWjoA
1983152,2013-08-25,0,YnmtUJGqQIQL9tz1MRyfqA,"I wasn't expecting too much coming here since it is a gastropub and there are tons of such places on the strip. Every casino has very similar restaurant offerings and after having a most disappointing experience at Burger Bar the night before I feared I was in for similar here.

Not the case.

We really enjoyed our experience at 1842. We had two appetizers and two 17oz drafts (I had the MOA pale ale and she had the (NAME ESCAPES US) porter). The food was an order of their pretzels and cheese w/ poached egg. This was AMAZING. I could have eaten it all night. The second appetizer we had were the nachos which had a sweet corn salsa on top. This too was amazingly good.

After our nosh we went out and did a little gambling and then returned in about an hour to have another drink at the bar. I revisited the MOA and she asked the bartender if she could make her a chocolate martini. The bartender answered in a half-hearted ""sure"" and proceeded to make a watered down, non-garnished mixed drink for $12. She had over-shaken the drink, thus making it very watery (rookie mistake). Ok, this was the ONLY thing that sucked about our experiences. For that kind of cash add some damn flare to the drink. It is not beyond reason to garnish with some chocolate shavings or syrup.

So, despite the lackluster mixed drink everything was awesome. They lose a star on the drink, but retain 4 strong stars and a promise that we will return in the near future. If you are a fan of beer and tasty-twists on pub fare favorites this place is for you.

*UPDATE*

I am going back and giving this place 5 stars.

My wife and I revisited 1842 the next night for a snack and a nightcap. After a day of playing pinball and visiting Old Vegas we thought a revisit was needed. We were glad we went back.

The wifey ordered a Guinness and I had another MOA, both were 17oz and ice cold delicious. We then ordered the pretzels and cheese dip w/ poached egg, again. Absolutely awesome. It was satisfying and set us in the right mode to get some rest (pinball is a vicious sport).

We were quite fortunate to get our server from the first night, Juan O. A great guy that is very accommodating. Props.

OK, that's it. I think you get it and should give this place a try if in the neighborhood.",0jPa5Jy3bU6MIbF_3_x3hg,0,0,5,E0CaYVjxpvY7cHE-qcsS9A

2062312,2014-04-23,1,YnmtUJGqQIQL9tz1MRyfqA,"I was in Vegas with some friends who had never been to the U.S. before, and much of our trip was about exposing them to some uniquely American dishes and beers. Among all the hustle and bustle of Vegas, MMP was a lucky find where my friends and I were able to relax in sporty atmosphere and try some fun American foods.
   For those of you who have read my other reviews, you will know I am a friend pickle snob, so when I saw them on the menu and wanted to provide my friends with a fun, American-food experience, the friend pickles were an easy decision. Now, I am not a fan of friend pickle spears--indeed dill chips are much superior--but MMP managed a version that was acceptable. Many restaurants fail to properly bread the spear so the breading separates from the spear rendering a warm pickle without the flavor and texture needed to make a good friend pickle. MMP avoided disaster.
   On another briney note, the bar also offers pickle back shots (which it calls ""hair of the dog), and provided another unique experience for my American culture sponges. I pressured one of my friends into taking a shot with me after which he noted: ""I always knew you Americans drank weird sh*t."" Nevertheless, he said that he enjoyed it and I assume chalked the experience up to another great American first.  
   Aside from the food, the beer selection is also notable and should not be overlooked. If you really want a gimmick, MMP has tables that have their own taps so that you can just keep the Vegas fun coming. 
   Overall, I would say this is a great place for happy hour.",cA11C5M14IJ3Qanh2DHfow,3,3,4,96jmTKrZtq8QkqnaAqQVNw

Most of the restaurants at MGM close for lunch, so we were left with a few options, and Pub 1842 was one of them. I thought it would be just fine since I'm accustomed to bar food, and actually love it. Michael Mina, why did you fail me? You left a lot to be desired.

First off, there was nobody at the front to seat us (and it's a sit down style restaurant, so you can't just go in and seat yourself.) After a few minutes, someone finally came to help us out. It wasn't busy at all, maybe half a dozen tables at best. 

We thumbed through the menu and were aghast at the exorbitant prices for bar food. $30 for fish and chips?! Whatever, I was starving so I ordered it anyway. I paired off my entree with a $4 coca cola. The other person at my table had a $15 salad (just seasoned asparagus), which she had the option of adding chicken for $12 more. Needless to say she did not enjoy her meal and was left starving afterward.

Here is the rundown of my dish: Two heavily breaded beer battered flakey fillets on a bed of thick cut fries. I did not enjoy the breading at all. It tasted like Larry the Cable Guy's Beer Batter you can buy at the $.99 Cent Store. The fish was fine, and was flakey with no discoloration. I did not like ANY of the dipping sauces I ordered. They were all watery and gross. The tartar sauce tasted like coleslaw, the BBQ sauce was basically spicy water, and the ranch was watery as well. The fish and chips back home at the Fish Enterprise tastes WAY better and it comes with clam chowder and is HALF the price.

The one positive thing about Michael Mina's Pub 1842 is the service. Once seated, the staff was very friendly. Besides that one positive, I don't think I will ever be back to this place again.

My suggestion to anybody thinking of dining here is to save your $$$ and eat at the food court across from it!",B1m44jSEkCCyH6Hnyt4f1A,9,4,2,Mw_1JxJG1zAcg7LlyRrdEg

2128180,2013-06-24,0,YnmtUJGqQIQL9tz1MRyfqA,"I visited the Pub 1842 on (2) occasions during my week long stay in Las Vegas, the first experience was marginally acceptable, gave it another chance which was an incremental improvement. On the third attempt, mostly due to lack of casual evening options currently available in the MGM Grand, I ended up walking out due to what I deem to be generally poor attentiveness by the ""General Manager"" and the staff under his charge. I have visited a number of Michael Mina's' restaurants' in various cities along the west coast and had always had an enjoyable experience, when you place a name like Michael Mina on the door of a pub you rightly expect a whole other level of pub. I can't say my experience with Pub 1842 in the MGM Grand met Mina level expectations. I will start with the good:

- location good relative to the MGM hotel layout
- nice floorplan and decor 
- very good beer selection on tap and bottled
- good wine and liquor selection
- good menu 
- taste of food was good
- being a pub, there is a potential to fill what I would opine as a void in venue options absent in most other casino/hotels in Las Vegas, the only other pub I know of is the Ri Ra in between the Mandalay and Luxor, at least as it pertains to casino/hotel interiors.

The average & inconsistent:
- Greeters/hosts at front door very average to disappointing, don't look you in the eye when they speak to you, distracted & no smile. I generally felt that they didn't understand that there is a higher level expectation when employed by an establishment bearing Michael Mina's name, hence his reputation. I have to say I have received a higher quality greeting at Hooters establishments.

- Servers in restaurant, while generally friendly, were very inconsistent and NOT knowledgeable about the menu or dishes they are charged with serving to the customers. 

- Servers not knowledgeable about the establishment, there is a unique feature in the Pub 1842 in that there are a few taps with seating around them. We inquired of the staff on our first visit how that worked and they replied an uninspiring ""I don't know"" however, a fellow customer overheard us and was kind enough to explain.

- Bartenders and barbacks inconsistently attentive in regards to consistently checking in with customers, was challenging to get their attention, even while not busy, barbacks were of no help to customers where they could have assisted the customers via getting the bartenders attention. Took a long time to get the check and equally as long to process the payment.

The Bad: (In my opinion)

- General Manager, in my opinion, doesn't get it. As previously mentioned I walked out on my third visit over some confusion regarding seating directions from the host staff and generally rude attitude of one of the servers. I attempted to address a gentleman that stated he was the GM, yet, he really didn't introduce himself. I explained the situation and he seemed genuinely disinterested in assisting us, so, we decided to go elsewhere. We ended up at Wolfgang Puck's establishment in the middle of the casino and had a delightful experience, good food and service, despite the fact that my colleagues and myself being very underdressed for the venue, relative to the other patrons.

All that being said, given the nice decor and unique self serve tap feature available there seem like there is some potential for Pub 1842, perhaps a rearrangement of the staff might bring out that potential. In summary, currently, given the gourmet prices I would not return to the Pub 1842's less than gourmet service and would not recommend it until some service improvements are put in place.",Yx6YF_1cNZkvFf3GhZspOQ,2,2,2,jv1B3j3zAhSnvxAfa8o45A

The slaw dressing was simply milky and lacked acid - like a weak Ranch dressing. Would've been way better with a vinegar-based formula. 

I was super impressed by the St. Louis-style BBQ ribs on the Bit of Everything plate. Lean like baby backs, and robust-tasting like Texas beef ribs, I really enjoyed them. I agree with Cathy C - way better than Rollin' Smoke, and even better than the former Las Vegas Grille as well - that's saying a lot, I think! Seriously, if you were to tell me that these were just a large, delicious version of a baby back rib, I would believe it.

The brisket was great as well. Pretty smoke ring and great flavor. The fat was totally edible and had a true melt-in-your-mouth quality. Pulled pork was delicious, and the baked beans were served piping hot (which I appreciate) and tasted homemade.

I had a dozen oysters on the side - East Coast (Bluepoint, I believe), jumbo-sized and moderately priced at $3/pop. Good luck finding them for less coin on the Strip (at least these ones are huge.)

Overall I would put this place a cut above the Todd English and Gordon Ramsay Pubs, and on the same food par as Rx Boiler Room, but I believe Michael Mina 1842 wins on price point.

I was debating between the Organic Half Chicken and Scottish Salmon...both I suppose are equally healthy, right? But why go to a restaurant just to have ""banquet chicken""? Well, that's when I looked at what sides they come with and made my final decision.  The Organic Half Chicken came on top of a bed of truffled Mac and Cheese.  How do you say no to that?! So there's a running joke in the hospitality industry (at least the people that I worked with) that if you are not adventurous, you're always safe with getting the chicken.  Every menu will have that ""safe"" chicken option.  I laughed at myself a bit when I did finally order the chicken. But OMFG! It was DELICIOUS!  Everything about it was amazing! It was well seasoned and juicy! I finished every last morsel of my meal, which I didn't do any other meal during the week! I was amazed with every single bite. I didn't want my meal to end!

Prior to going into Pub 1842, my intent was to get a burger. I ended up ordering the bbq brisket plate that came with sides of jalapeno corn bread and baked beans.

The bbq brisket plate was fine. I've had better. The pieces were fatty just as I wanted it, but the bbq sauce threw me off a bit.

We were already fans of Michael Mina and were intrigued to see what he had cooking at this new location.  We had our two kids with us, but one day we'll have to come back for their Value Town - Happy Hour menu.  We were sat immediately by the Hostess and our waiter came by for our drink order and was extremely knowledgeable and friendly.
I started with my ""what's the best thing on the menu"" and he pointed us in the below direction.
We started with the Crab Louie Deviled Eggs and the Lobster Corn Dogs.  Both were very good, but slightly heavy apps.  The Lobster Corn Dogs are a MUST try and pairing this with an IPA crushes your taste buds into happiness submission!
Looking for a good entree, i was pointed in the direction of the ""Peanut Butter Crunch Burger"".  My wife ordered the 1842 Burger w/ caramelized onions, mushrooms and truffle aioli.  Her burger was good, mine was better.
The bacon jam and crunchy potato chips make the PBCB extremely salty, so if you have an aversion, stay away.  Otherwise, order one up Mid-Rare, grab a beer, and enjoy the Flavor Train!
The icing on the cake (knowing the value of a satisfied child) of the meal was the accommodating Chef. My three year old wanted Shrimp.  So the chef made a nice Pasta and Shrimp dish on the fly.  My kid wolfed it down like he was a starving child on a Sally Struthers infomercial and placed another full order.

With a large rectangle bar right smack dab in the  middle along with booth seating on each side as well as an open kitchen in the back, 1842 gives you that local bar vibe with a touch of sophistication.

Greeted as we sat down at the bar, the bartender was most hospitable. I had ask him to make me a drink whiskey based and he delivered with an old fashion made with jim beam that was aged for four months in a miniature oak barrel that was sitting at the bar. Delicious. They also have a decent selection of beers, wine and cocktails.

Food-wise, i went for the peanut butter crunch burger (i also asked them to put a fried egg on which they accommodated me on that request). It's one of those food where you know it's sooo bad for you but taste sooo good. My buddy opt'd for the bacon cheeseburger which was also a home run. The fries reminded me of fresh out the fryer Mcdonald's fries.

The Menu is easy to navigate and fun but uses high end ingredients which is really nice to see in a pub setting. Four of us had a ton to eat and drink and enjoyed it all for the place only being open a couple of days.

Food:
- Fried Pickles was a great starter and had some mustard inside that was amazing
- Green Chile Stew was awesome
- Double Dog Dare wrapped in bacon and topped with Guac and chicharrones was pretty dope and all 4 of us had two good bites each and enjoyed it (Great dish to share)
- Ahi Poke was a super high grade Tuna but under seasoned 
- Maitake Mushroom Tempura was really good but also under seasoned 
- Fish and Chips was clearly high quality fish and that makes all the difference
- We mentioned to the Chef about the seasoning and he was appreciative and thanked us for bringing it to his attention. I have no doubt this place will keep getting better each week they are open (Seems like that kind of crew)

Drinks:
- There was a wide selection of beers and we drank them
- They has home made Red Hot shots and we absolutely loved those
- They also seemed to have a bunch of bourbons and rums that they age themselves in casks and were ridiculously smooth and we drank a bunch of this.

Any service issues were easy to understand as they have only been open a few days and the place is already slammed non stop. Such a good time,

All in all great place if you are staying in the MGM and by far the best place to go to watch a game or before and after shows at the MGM since it is in that food corridor. I look forward to going back",EXouLmmMWB2U_tVpp7yioA,2,2,4,3hQa_U_i94Tga1sT8sA92w

Food: 4
Service: 3

Happy Hour is ONLY if you are sitting at the bar. If you sit at a table you will NOT receive happy hour service. I do not like this policy. I always prefer tables because I find high tops very uncomfortable to sit in and tables are more spacious in general. Most places have happy hour specials within the whole establishment, not just within one section. 

For appetizer we ordered the fried pickles. My boyfriend said they were the best fried pickles. I ordered the tomato soup with grilled cheese. The tomato soup was delicious; very creamy and well balanced flavors (not too acidic). The grilled cheese was just okay, it was very thin with not much cheese so the rye was overpowering. My boyfriend ordered the turkey burger which was delicious and juicy. We did not like the fries at all. The texture of the fries were great but they were smothered in this very sweet seasoning that reminded me of Steak N Shake seasoning (but at steak n shake its on the side so you can add as much or little as you like). 

The staff were friendly but the service was very slow. We were seated before 2:30pm and didnt leave until 3:45pm. I find it strange that service took so long considering its in between lunch and dinner times. 

For one appetizer, two entrees (the tomato soup being one of the cheapest items on the menu), and tap waters it came out to $50 with tip (18%). I personally don't feel its worth the price but they probably have to pay a lot of rent for their location.

Don't get me wrong, the food isn't bad, but for the price? For being in Las Vegas? And for being recommended? The food definitely wasn't up to the hype.

We got the frickles, which were decent. I always appreciate when a restaurant does spears over chips, but my fiance and I both noticed that the batter slightly scratched the roofs of our mouths as we ate them.

I got the 1842 burger and added blue cheese, but they put so much blue cheese on the burger, that it overpowered the rest of the flavors (weirdly enough, we took my burger home and ate it as a snack later in the day, and it was significantly much better, but that's because the blue cheese taste had died down - don't get me wrong, I love blue cheese, but when you warm blue cheese, the flavor because pretty intense so you don't need a lot to go a long way)

My fiance got the bacon burger, and he said it was ""alright"" but that there wasn't anything special about it.

My favorite thing on their menu is there zero alcohol drink that has melon in it, but I got a shot of vodka in it: so refreshing and not super boozy, which was great for lunch",CjPpqrBQMtKI33tvBIs3wQ,0,0,2,QIzVPm9srs0oF0AUkluI8Q

They are serving up tasty goodies like homemade fried pickles, pork nachos and homemade pretzels.... this is just a short list... of the appetizers.  These were all the things I saw and wanted to try.  The Nachos were HUGE and looked ""oh-so-yummy"".  The table next to us was digging into these... and seemed to be enjoying them immensely.

But I was ""being good"".... sort of.  I restrained from filling up on these appetizers. We opted to share the ceviche... and then I shared a burger and salad with my mom.

Ceviche was good... not the best I ever had but definitely solid!  Lots of shrimps and scallops so PLUS there. I'm just picky... so keep that into account.    

We had the 1842 burger (medium) and the chopped Chinese salad.  The Burger was SUCCULENT... JUICY.... MELT-IN-YOUR-MOUTH.... Yumminess!  Might be my new favorite burger.  I'm a big Bachi Burger fan... and this is right there...lots of flavor, savoriness and excellently prepared.  And then there's the Bun... Yes, the Bun is newsworthy... it was light and airy and soft.  It wasn't hard or dense.  I think it's definitely homemade cuz it just melted in your mouth along with the burger.  (Note... I was totally unimpressed with the store pickles they served with the burger.... it was limp and soggy.  I was expecting something more hand-crafted-like.)  The fries were ok.... nothing to get excited about.  But the Burger... The Burger is the Star!

The Salad was quite large!  Definitely Entrée sized.  Even for the 2 of us we didn't finish all of it.  The dressing was Fabulous... light, not overpowering and just a hint of ginger.  I'd definitely order it again.  I mean... if I was ""being good"".  But I'd probably end up having the burger.  LOL!

The Atmo .... Dark like a pub... but not murky... lots of TVs everywhere.  It being March... there was Round-Ball on the tubes everywhere so we got a good variety of games to watch all at once.  It seemed like everywhere had a pretty good view of at least 2 TVs.

The Service.... The waitstaff / server / water guy... All On Point!  They were on top of it.  

I definitely recommend making reservations if you plan on getting there after 5pm on a weekend.  We were there on a Saturday night at 5:15pm and we had about a 25 minute wait.",PV0VEhlmhc2BjzMZEbpWlg,1,0,4,EJgkHohAlfu9goim3yz18w

Is it $17 great, for a local, who had to walk a half a mile from the parking garage for it? Eh, not really. If you are like me going for the burger, it makes sense to do the $18.42 deal, where you get fries and a drink too. (or a shake or a cookie, depending on your mood) The burger came with grilled onions, mushrooms, and truffle. It was a big burger, but honestly if I were to dine here again, I would probably go for something else. 
We also went for a frickles appetizer. I am sure you can guess a frickle is a fried pickle. They were average. Nothing that really stood out. 
This place would be good for a happy hour with the girls. It is the only time I could justify returning. Even the happy hour cocktails were $6-$8.
Coming from a girl who grew up in Vegas, and could go to Ellis Island for $1 drinks 24/7, that just does not seem like a happy hour to me. Forgive me for being cheap. I don't mind going to touristy style places and spending more for something spectacular. For something that makes my mouth water at the thought of it. But for average burgers, not so much. 
We are talking MGM here, where within steps you can dine at Emeril's, or Wolfgang's. Mr. Mina, I would say step your game up just a touch. Lower the price to be a casual pub, or offer something fancy to fit in with your surroundings. Just my opinion.

First the precursor: drinks. 
Even my super picky dad was able to find more interesting-sounding beers on tap that he could consume in one evening.  After deliberating over a few and settling on one to start, our waiter gave him a taste of one of the others he was considering without any prompting - very thoughtful of him.
I tried a couple of their specialty cocktails - both were sweeter than I generally prefer but still delicious, and dang, are they strong!  I'm not complaining, but you can't say you weren't warned.  

On to the main event: food.
We started by ordering the chicken drumsticks - their spin on wings.  They were huge, smothered in a sweet barbecue sauce, and terribly good.  They give you handiwipes so don't be afraid to dig in.

My dad had the chili and a wedge salad and seemed pleased.  My mom and I went a little off the wall and split the carne asada taco salad and the beef brisket.  The salad was incredible, and they even separated it into two dishes for us so we didn't have to make a mess of it.  The steak comes out VERY rare, and mine even more than my mom's - it was more than edible and very tender, but if you can't deal with truly red meat, you might want to ask them to cook it a little longer.  

I was slightly disappointed with how dry the beef brisket was, but my mom thought it was cooked fine and really enjoyed it, so I think it's just a personal preference thing.  We also got a side of mac & cheese and it was excellent - not so overly cheesy that you feel like you're eating a heart attack, like so many fancy chefs seem to favor, and with a little broccoli mixed in.  

We were more than sated so we passed on dessert but they sounded adorable - cake & shake combos. 

Michael Mina definitely delivers a great dining experience in a casual environment with a classy and tasty take on bar food, while remaining affordable (considering it's in a hotel on the strip).  We'll certainly be back.",gqimocAPnvr9V-YjYhfElg,3,3,5,miIOcWLUT-0-c-j5AXI6yA

Food is 5 stars.  Service is 4 stars.  Beer menu is 4 stars.  Price is 4 stars for strip.  Michael Mina does it again.  We began with the street corn and nachos to share (pro tip - order half an order of nachos - they're huge!).  The street corn was great and a perfect appetizer.  The nachos were a little soggier than normal but would be a 5 star dish if bar eating and watching a game.  They have a nice nacho kick as well which was unexpected.  For my meal I had the delicious turkey burger with some added jalapenos to spice it up.  The turkey meat was phenomenal - chewy and fresh with some great cheesy sauce.  The burger in all was the best turkey burger I've ever had, hands down.  Mix that with a strong bun and a large portion and you have a winner.  The burger ran $19 with a $2 upcharge for a salad which is very typical for a craft burger on the strip.  The beers are overpriced by $2-3 but it is MGM so it's expected.  Michael Mina does not disappoint; Pub 1842 matches any craft burger joint on the strip for sure.",JaqcCU3nxReTW2cBLHounA,0,0,4,YXurb6jdVk9OCJOLFyLmaA

3369417,2016-12-01,3,YnmtUJGqQIQL9tz1MRyfqA,"Possibly the best meal I had this Veteran's Weekend.

Came for lunch, with a craving for a juicy burger. I mentioned prior to seating that it was my girlfriends' birthday and the hostess nodded, seated us and off we were to an amazing lunch. 

*CALAMARI $16 - The fried calamari was good, it was in a huge tin perfect for sharing between 2-3 people. It was on the salty side which stops you from having too much of it but nicely season with the herbs. Smoked marinara and lemon garlic aioli for dipping. It's one of those can order or not sort of dish. 

*BACON BURGER $19 - This was amazing! the beef patty cooked to a medium well doneness but still juicy, how?! Nice ratio of melted cheeses (gouda and american) that did not overwhelm, perfectly cooked crispy bacon strips. The burger came cut in half, i don't know if that's their standard or because they assume we were sharing. We did, it was a lot! Comes with fries, potato + potAto:

*BAKED SWEET POTATO $11 - This was excellent, perfectly baked large sweet potato that's sure to be too much for one person. The maple-chipotle cream cheese is genius, but can be too creamy and heavy, you better scrape some of that aside to reach the potato. Sweet on sweet can be a bit too...well, sweet, make sure you share this. Dusted with Pecan Streusel Sea Salt, makes this side dish a freaking winner. Loved it! 

*CHOCOLATE STICKY TOFFEE CAKE $6 (FREE, which came as a surprise after I mentioned the bday) So delicious and smart. Listen to this, Bourbon chocolate cake (sick), spiked caramel (what?!), chocolate mousse (keep going), chocolate streusel (Lord Jesus) and caramel freaking corn (can I get a pop-cooorn)! The BOMB (bear in mind i never say a food is bomb, but in this case, it's the only word that can describe this masterpiece) 

Service was excellent, loved the decor, the beer tables. It was all an unforgettable experience. This totally made our day!",wClUV2KsLWNZwOw5nlw6UQ,5,5,5,sNjyU2bBb3Lve8qmM0Arfw

Located at the MGM Grand next to the shops, the Pub is a great place to have dinner after doing some window shopping.This is Mina's version of a beer and burger joint so make sure to try both! It's casual and loud like any typical American bar that houses ten TVs. We caught the tail end of the world series here back in October and it was popping!

We started at the bar since we came a bit early for our reservation and instantly, I wanted to have a dessert like cocktail. The 1842 Cable Car had Captin Morgan spiced rum, orange curacao, eggwhite served on a martini glass with a burnt suar cinnamon rim. It is plenty sweet but seems fitting for a turn of the season cocktail. Delicious and foamy were two things that I was looking for and it didn't disappoint. The  $14 price tag might seem steep at first especially if you're being poured Captain Morgan, but the size of the glass actually justifies it. I'd get a smaller version in SF for sure. The beer list is long and is offered in varying sizes (even a 33oz. boot!) and he enjoyed an Innis & Gunn scottish ale. Dark brown in color with some chocolatey notes, this is a thin beer that goes down easy ;-)

We had deep fried calamari to start and it was breaded and fried to perfection. Our entrees varied from my girlfriend who got the shrimp and grits (passable) to the boys who indulged on the BBQ sampler (HUGE! great tasting meats, but just ok sides) and the special Bacon Burger for me. My burger was cooked medium as requested and was piled on with a smoked gouda & American cheese and two crispy bacon strips. The bacon jam added a hint of sweetness to it which I liked. While everything came together harmoniously and the fries were exceptionally crispy, I feel that $20 is overcharging for a pub burger. But whatcha gotta do, that's Vegas for you. 

I wouldn't have had a second cocktail but since our food took more than 30 minutes to appear (I guess they were massaging the cow?!) I ordered a Negroni with my standard Plymouth Gin. Bracing and bitter is just how I like it!

Overall, a nice casual alternative to all the fancy fine dining offered at MGM. Not everyone wants to go to L'Atelier or Joel Robuchon so I'm happy that Mina has a pub for us ordinary folks.",Z88N6qly3Dp5C06XbZ9IMQ,18,17,4,dl85YpJDoM_y5-YQaqMZkg

Salty delicious myserty cheese, bacon, some sort of green flakes (parsley? green onion?) and a poached egg in the middle.  You pierce the poached egg and stir it all up and it becomes some sort of liquid heaven.  Is there a hint of beer flavor in the cheese? Maybe?

Ranch- not to heavy and not too watery- just right and very flavorful! Nice! Perfectly slivered red onions and these amazing picked onions that gave this salad so much additional flavor- I mean a wedge salad is somewhat boring- but not here! And the marinated tomatoes on it- just another flavorful add on to this greatness! Ya gotta try it - so Delish for an otherwise typically unoriginal salad!!

I ordered the BBQ wings as my main dish. I cannot put into words how amazing these are! And these aren't your tiny no meat drummies- these are large with meat on the bone. They were cooked to crisp perfection with the tenderness of the meat- and glazed with a honey BBQ concoction that I have never tasted before...amazeballs!! Yup amazeballs!

I'm a big fan of Michael Mina - having eaten at his establishments in San Francisco and even when this location was called Knob Hill years ago - so when I found out there was another Michael Mina place to check out - I was all in.  I grabbed my girlfriends and quickly made a reservation for us and off we went.

I forgot how maze-like MGM Grand can be and they have made so many changes since I was here last time.  Plus, with the Nascar folks in town - it was a zoo. So we were a couple of minutes late for our reservation - but despite our tardiness and how packed they were - they seated us right away in a 6-top booth.

We were starving and immediately opted for cocktails and snacks - ordering the frickles (fried pickle spears) and the pretzels with a gooey beer-cheese dip with a fried (maybe poached) egg in the center.  The pretzels were amazing and I will say that the dip was better once someone broke the egg into and swirled it all around - I didn't even realize it was in there until someone else had the guts to break it and mix it all up.  The frickles were also delicious - with a snap to them and a sauce that was to die for - I could have put that stuff on everything!

My cocktail was the Soda Popinski.  Not being a fan of sweet cocktails - I tend to go for the tart ones or bourbon laced ones.  This was Grey Goose, Fresh Lime, and Ginger Beer - so perfectly tart and packed a real punch! Loved it!

For my entree - I was torn.  I finally gave in and ordered the Double Dog Dare.  This was two bacon-wrapped wagyu hot dogs, topped with guacamole, pico de gallo, and chicharones. So double the pork on top of fancy beef dogs - you cannot go wrong. But damn - this was a LOT of food.  I didn't want the fries it came with, so I asked for a substitute of the Mac and cheese.  I was warned it would cost extra - yeah, I'm in Vegas - I don't care.  So I opted for the smoked gouda mac and cheese with broccoli.  Not too shabby, but I've had better.

This is not a hot dog you can eat with your hands - you have to use a knife and fork.  Not that I minded - because it was DAMN good.  Honestly, I don't think it needed the guac and pico - just all that pork goodness and leave it be...maybe a fancy mustard and walk away. But I was happy - and seriously, could not eat it all (such a shame).

For ""dessert,"" they had boozy milkshakes.  How can you NOT get a salted caramel shake packed with bourbon?  Especially when they offer to put it in a to-go cup?  Exactly.  It was my birthday, after all.

Overall, the service was slow and we had to split up the check ourselves.  Our waitress said it would take her SO long to do it, so we took care of it on our own.  This is from the server who had trouble keeping our water glasses full (we might have ordered extra cocktails from her, but it was taking too long) and my mac and cheese came out late and I had to remind her about it - I still ended up with the fries.  So service loses them a star, but the food keeps them at 4 stars (plus honoring of the reservation despite us being late).

3517614,2013-07-04,2,YnmtUJGqQIQL9tz1MRyfqA,"Michael Mina's Pub 1842 is in the heart of MGM Grand district -- a long hallway with an odd combination of high end restaurants, shops, and a food court. It took over for Sea Blue, also owned by Mina. The place was loud. Like night club loud. And, it attracts the pool/day club crowd so you'll see plenty of drunk dudes in tank tops.

The menu is full of stuff you'll be familiar with. But there's a twist with most, if not all, dishes. An ingredient or two that has been added to those comfort dishes to make them new and exciting. Like peanut butter on a burger or popcorn on a lobster roll. I couldn't pass up the peanut butter crunch burger ($14). The combo was so odd that I had to try it. And, you know what? It works. The peanut butter lightly coats the underside of the top bun. There isn't a lot of it, but there's no mistaking the taste when you take a bite. In combination with the crunchy, salty chips and a perfectly well seasoned beef patty with a crispy char coating, it makes for a great array of flavors and textures that are unexpected yet pleasing. It may not be the best burger I've had, but it was certainly memorable.

The other food was decent, but a step down from the burger. The jumbo lump crab cake ($19) was tasty, especially with the garlic basil dressing. The avocado kale caesar ($14) was an unnecessarily large portion that tasted good after the first few bites but was so rich that we left the rest of it untouched. They took what should have been a healthy and light dish and fattened it up needlessly. We ordered a side of chicken ($14) that my kid had for his dinner. 

The one side dish we got was the mac and cheese ($9). It was as creamy, smokey, and cheesy as we had hoped but what ruined it for us was the broccoli. I'm not a fan of broccoli in mac and cheese and if they had bothered to list that ingredient on the menu I probably would not have ordered it. 

We didn't stick around for dessert, although those options all sounded delicious. Service was spotty, as can be expected from a newly opened restaurant.

They've got a few tables with their own beer taps. Customers can swipe their credit card and pour their own beer. Might be some of the best tables around for drinking and people watching.

I love peanut butter burgers (always drawn to them when I see them on the menu); if you haven't tried one before, don't hate - just try.  And the fries - oh the fries.  I had to literally throw trash on top of them to stop me from continuing to eat the plethora of fries that came alongside the burger (I hated myself for stopping myself at the time, but my tummy thanked me later :)).

They have a great deal during lunch hours - for something like $15 you can get a burger, choice of side salad or fries, a miller lite, and a cookie.  

Will definitely stop back in for a casual, laid-back lunch.",1A-geB-PQr1uveSFOS7Feg,0,0,4,ZwGINtfli8b9NkDk__HROw

The beer selection was outstanding and our waiter was a fellow craft beer nut so we hit it off well.  All of his recommendations were right on point.  (Thanks Will!)

My wife ordered the PB&J burger and we were both blown away by the complexity of the flavors.  It was a crazy experiment gone incredibly right!  I had the BBQ platter and was very satisfied with my meal.

My review was lowered by one star due to the prices being a little on the high side.  This is the new Vegas standard and could go for nearly every restaurant in town.

Pub 1842 will be on our list of places to hit again when the gambling goes south.  Expensive or not, I would rather have a full gut and a head full of beer than watch my wallet get bled dry in the casino.",tzqGEP-aTVTpjPhxhfV2WQ,1,0,4,Wo1uOk5lTWqpcp7APDVe7w

While each dish was tasty, they were somewhat lacking in their primary ingredient - particularly the duck and lobster. When biting into the spring roll, it was a struggle to actually taste any duck. I really wanted to taste it too! Likewise with the lobster mac and cheese, the texture of the lobster was evident, but there was little flavor.

We received satisfactory service, but the bar is very busy during happy hour and we were lucky to get a seat. At the same time, the manager offered to allow us to order happy hour at one of the tables even though that's normally not allowed.",KbwOwQZTOfrtaeJdmucALQ,2,2,3,4e54sMdhLMcPtz_vmmeHQg

To find the pub we relied on our friends to text us where it was located in reference to some other places we were familiar with, other wise it may have taken us a little longer. It was in the walkway heading back to the MGM garden arena.
Service was decent for our drinks and appetizers. We sat at the bar vs. waiting for a table, it was pretty crowded. Our food came out in a timely manner and we dove in. We had the 1842 nachos and the Hot soft pretzels.
Pretzel itself was good but the beer cheese with bacon and poached egg was lack luster. The egg was not noticeable in flavor and I don't think there was any bacon in there at all.
The nachos were your basic greasy mess all piled on top of each other, nothing to write home about.

I love their cocktails--had the Heist (Bulleit bourbon, passion fruit-lemongrass syrup, vanilla, and fresh lemon juice, with fresh cracked black pepper on top), which was sweeter than I normally go for, but interesting and delicious. They had a special version with strawberry peppercorn syrup as well, and that one was tasty, too. They do barrel-aged cocktails, which is an interesting concept, but the only one I tried was way too sweet for me (Sin City, with Buffalo Trace whiskey, Green Chartreuse, keffir lime syrup, and a gold leaf garnish). The Soda Popinski from the Fizzy-Lifting section of the menu (their version of a Moscow Mule--Grey Goose, fresh lime, ginger beer), was refreshing and balanced.

As far as food, the 1842 nachos were fantastic! They're cheaper during happy hour, and a ridiculously large serving--an entire tray of tortilla chips with big chunks of braised pork, cheddar cheese sauce, black bean and jicama relish, with pickled fresno peppers. Super flavorful.

Our waitress was really not so good at her job with very frequent interruptions, dropping things, taking away things we needed, and not being around when she was needed. Please don't interrupt my conversation to tell me you'll be right back with something. Just bring it. Don't ask me if it's okay that my burger comes with fries if there is no alternative. Don't ask me if I need another beer while my current one is half-way full every 5 minutes. 

The burger was pretty good and cooked medium-rare as ordered. It was cooked in a lot of butter though, making it too rich. When paying $19 for a burger and fries (?!!), could you please serve it to me on a plate instead of in a basket? The sauce and juices drip all over the fries, making them soggy. The fries were sub-par. I would expect thicker cut fries, skin on, or something other than what looked like and tasted like McD's fries. And $1.50 sharing fee? No thanks. 

The beer menu is good with very high prices. It's not easy to find craft beer in Vegas, but this bar has a decent selection. I went back the next day for Happy Hour to get a deal on a pint, but sadly the Happy Hour specials are only on cocktails and tall boy cans of PBR. Really? You're a craft brew pub, but you feature the worst beer in cans as your special? No thanks. The Todd English P.U.B. at the Aria has equally good beer and half-price pints for Happy Hour (3-6). 

If you are stuck at the MGM Grand and need a bite or a beer, there are worse options. I'm sure most of the food is delicious, but I couldn't afford to try it.",360o_mkiCENm5h6wixtGzA,0,0,3,2arsLZLQUWJ9r1fSUmbx9g

After reading the previous post I was very much looking forward to dining here and I was excited to try the fried pickles but at 8:30 they were already sold out.  Our server recommended the lobster corn dogs so we gave them a shot.  He also recommended the crab cakes and the tuna starter.  The tuna poke was great quality and well prepared but we were not crazy about the lobster dogs or the crab cake.  I asked the server what kind of crab it would be and he said lump crab meat.  I asked what kind of crab and he didn't seem to know.  He agreed when I suggested 'blue crab?' I'm not sure what it was but it it didn't seem like lump blue crab meat.  
For our sides we tried the mac and cheese, mushrooms, and corn on the cob.  The corn was the winner. 
Entrees: fish and chips- the fish looked great but it covered the fries completely in the basket and created a steaming effect that made the fries soggy. Also, the fish and or batter didn't seem to be salted or seasoned at all which was a bummer.
Seared tuna- slightly over cooked but tasty
Turkey burger- good, not amazing- but good, especially if you like spicy.

If you want a hip sportsl bar environment with average bar food Pub 1842 is a good spot but if you are a foodie expecting a little extra from Michael Mina I would suggest trying one of his other restaurants or give this one some time to work out the kinks before you visit.",Ot0aYEaOVe144ljMmG8YZQ,3,0,3,h2OjX0p1sT5riUC5SnZ9sw

Elvis would be proud of the peanut butter burger which I almost got.  Should have, since it sounded pretty unique since other items I did get were not where I was hoping they would be.

BBQ sampler was tried on round one.  Now granted, BBQ is a very special thing and if you love it you can be fussy.  So when a ""certified celebrity chef"" (whatever the ""f"" that means) claims great Q,  it better be up in the ranking.  So , served on the now to common crappy tin tray, we had a decent brisket.  Marbled with enough fat to make it very tender.  Not much of a smoke flavor and the ""rub"" was not as flavorful as it should have been. Still solid.  The pulled pork was to salty but tender and no real crust which it should have.  The ribs pulled cleanly off the bone and had a nice thick glaze on top.  They were pretty solid but all in all I have had much better Q.  Only one sauce on the smokey side didn't help.  Beans were very very salty but had a lot of meat in them.  Kale slaw I liked.  Jalepeno cornbread was stale and honey butter was warm and rancid.  Had a nasty taste.  $ 32 bucks for this ""sampler"" tray was to high.

Round two brought a friend.  Got the fried cauliflower with a hot and sour sauce.  Liked this a lot.  Lightly breaded and tender.  Sauce was the right amount of hot and sweet.  Tasty. Went for the veggie burger which was made with falafel. Haven't seen that before! Points for being different but if you don't nail a falafel you are in trouble.   Friend liked the idea but said it was to gooey with all the stuff they put on it. He ate half of it.   I had a sauteed mushroom onion burger.  Slightly overcooked so it was not juicy.  If cooked a nice medium it would have been good.   But the mushrooms and onions were so frickin salty I was drinking whatever I could get my hands on all night.  A good chef should not be salting anything like this. I ate most of it before I realized how bad it was.  ( I was really hungry!).  I regretted it all night.

Some nice beer selections at modest ( by vegas standards) pricing.  

So maybe I ordered the wrong things here. Other dishes sound good.  Prices are less than most of the other high end places in vegas but this is a kind of simple plain ""pub"" concept so for that you are still paying 17 bucks for a burger.  I'd rather go to one of the high end places, pay more and get better food.

We returned for lunch with high hopes of once again dining on some Lobster Corn Dogs, great Black Angus burgers and knocking back a couple of cold brews.  Instead, we found that the Lobster Rolls have been replaced by Lobster Fritters.

Our ""crack"" service team, Juan and Miguel, assured us that the fritters were a nice change to the menu, popular, and tasted really good. But, we weren't the only ones who asked for the corn dogs. Our slight disappointment quickly changed as we sloshed down our Kronenbourg beers and dug into our perfectly cooked, hand patted, hand crafted 1/2 pound burgers.

My husband chose The Champ that was a behemoth with smoked Gouda, American cheese (NOT your typical Kraft slice), crisp thick strips of Applewood-smoked bacon, lettuce and special sauce. Both burgers were served between toasted brioche buns in a seemingly bottomless basket of BBQ French fries.  

We enjoyed our return dine as it confirmed the versatility or range of Chef Mina's talent.  He is able to take a simple comfort food like hamburger and transform it into a gastropub delight.

This is definitely a knife and fork type of dog because there really isn't any way to eat this with your hands.

I also thought it was really cool that they sat me at a table right across from the kitchen so I got to see firsthand how my Double Dog Dare was made (http://bit.ly/1faB6nw).

3861512,2014-03-18,2,YnmtUJGqQIQL9tz1MRyfqA,"I stopped in here for a dinner with some girlfriends during a celebratory weekend in Vegas.  I had never heard of Michael Mina, but one of my friends was a big fan and picked out this place for our first night in town.

The place is located inside the MGM Grand.  We wandered around for a little bit, but finally found the place.  The place looked pretty packed, but we were quickly seated since we had a reservation.  We were in a big booth that seated 6.  I noticed that the hightop tables next to us had self-serve taps on the table, if beer happens to be your thing.  Beer is not quite my thing so I ordered a drink called Fog City.  It's a rum based punch that packs a pretty nice punch.  It's tasty too.

We started off with an order of pretzels and frickles.  The pretzels are bigger pretzel sticks served with a beer cheese sauce that has a poached egg in the middle.  Several of the girls picked around the egg, but I went all in and broke it so I could enjoy it.  I think it made the beer cheese sauce better.  The fickles is their version of fried pickles.  Instead of being pickle slices like chips, they are fried pickle spears.  They didn't really look that appetizing, but they were actually pretty good.  The special sauce that they serve on the side is what makes it so good.  Make sure you get extra of that stuff.

I ended up ordering the 1842 burger for my entree.  I subbed out a turkey patty for the beef patty.  The 1842 burger is topped with caramelized onions, mushrooms, and truffle aioli.  The toppings really made the turkey burger good.  The turkey patty was a bit on the dry side, but acceptable.  I'm sure it would have been even better with the beef patty.  The burger came with a side of fries.  They are your usual fries.

Overall, the food was pretty good and the company even better.  I will say that service was on the slow side.  Our server was pretty busy and it took a while to get water and beverage refills.  Paying was a bit of a pain because we had to break out the bill ourselves.  She said that she could do it for us, but that it would take her a really long time.  We had already been there for quite a bit so we went ahead and used our handy dandy TAB app on our phone to make splitting the check a breeze.",4LttfktRgAF_0Bunsyv9BA,5,3,4,i5I5hsqcvLdPfi-zOOnkaw

That said, I was impressed by the food and all the dishes we tried were an easy 4*, possibly even 4.5* - but I am docking 1* for bad service.

Every single dish we had was good, although everything was definitely on the rich side. We started with the duck spring rolls and lobster corn dogs. Both were really balanced flavor-wise (especially the spring rolls, where the preparation tempered the usual oiliness of the duck), and both had fantastic texture contrast. For mains, we shared the baked ziti, double dog dare, heritage turkey burger, and the jumbo lump crab appetizer. Normally I would never ever consider a turkey burger, but a member of our party had heard the turkey burger here was one of the best and really wanted to try it. Well, the turkey wound up being incredibly moist and well-seasoned. I still don't think anything turkey can ever beat a great hamburger patty, but I was quite impressed. I was also a big fan of the baked ziti, which had just the right of amount of spiciness for that extra kick.

Unfortunately, the service left much to be desired. The hostess could not have looked any more unhappy to be at work or to be having to deal with us. Our server was a little more friendly (not that that's saying much) but still lacked the polish and efficiency that we would have liked; refills on drinks were slow, had to ask multiple times to get requests fulfilled, jumbo lump crab came out with the appetizers even though we asked for it as a main dish, etc. Also, one of our party members is allergic to avocado so we told our server that and requested the guacamole in the heritage turkey burger on the side, but our server neglected to tell us that the pico de gallo on the double dog dare also contained avocado. We certainly take responsibility for our own food allergies, but good service would have involved her being aware of that potential problem.

I started with the lobster corn dogs which were accompanied by a container of crème fraîche flavored with whole grained mustard.  I have never had a regular corn dog--ever-- so this was a treat in more ways than one.  The lobster was very flavorful, the coating was a nice soft texture, and the mustard sauce made the combination a winner.

Next I got the peanut butter crunch burger.  It's a large burger, I'm figuring 8 ounces before cooking, served on a bed of fries.  The burger is topped with peanut butter and some bacon jam.  There are also a number of ribbed potato chips on top and it gives a nice crunchiness to the burger.  I asked for it rare and that's the way I got it.  The fries were crispy but there were way too many.

For dessert, I tried one of their cakes 'n shakes pairings.  I got the roasted peach and almond buckle that comes with a salted caramel shake and a small container of bourbon toffee to pour into the buckle like you would flavoring into a soufflé.  It was very good but the salted caramel shake which was very thick needed more salt.  I didn't taste any salt at all.

Service was excellent for most part.  It took quite awhile to get my check because it seemed like everyone was getting ready to leave at the same time.  Until then everything was good.  I was brought a new iced tea before my other one was finished, there was a clean fork brought between the corn dogs and the burger--in short--the kind of attention you get from higher end restaurants and not generally associated with a gastropubs.  

I really liked my time at the pub and I found it a great place for a person eating alone.  There was a TV near where I was sitting.  I enjoyed watching the Washington Nationals game.

Keeping with Michael's flare for food, the presentation was interesting as were the different flavors displayed on a baking sheet, not piled high with goopy cheese.  The menu, which, by the way is not on their website yet,  said the nachos came with green chili - at lunch, there were 3 small chunks of nicely flavored pork.  A couple of days later we stopped in for a late dinner/snack, ordered them again, and yes, there was green chili with ample pork on them.  The pork really adds to the whole taste of the dish.

The Chicken Drumstick appetizer is just that - large Drumsticks - crunchy, gooey, delicious - the  Lobster Corndogs are delicious too.  We didnt order the lobster roll because we had had it several times at Nob Hill,  our favorite Michael Mina restaurant that we were so sad to learn had closed in April.

The salmon was cooked perfectly. I don't even really like salmon and only order it occasionally, but I am so glad I did. I almost ordered a second salmon just to take home. And here's the kicker: apparently the chef thought the first time it was cooked it was overdone. So he sent out an appetizer (the lettuce wraps with crab - delish!) and his apologies. The manager was gracious and attentive, checking back to make sure when the dish did arrive it was to my liking. I even ordered one of their milkshake-cake desserts. The milkshake was adorable and perfectly sized for the small delicious coconut cake that it accompanied. The cake was a little dry, but not so much that it was ruined. I did mention it to the manager, and she was again very gracious and said she would let the chef know. And the bar? Beautiful. And I mean the staff as well as the ambiance. The essence oils around the bar added a nice effect, and the bar staff was knowledgeable and very friendly. Amanda was a great bartender and seemed to be interacting with her guests well. She made a delicious skinny margarita for me and was a great person to chat with while I sat and enjoyed my meal. They also have those new self-serve beer tap tables where you get an access key from the server and can pour your own drafts at the table. These will be great for football time and I can't wait to reserve my own seat!

4054513,2013-07-23,0,YnmtUJGqQIQL9tz1MRyfqA,"Bartender Jennifer is a 5 star-outstanding bartender.

I was impressed with Pub 1842. I went there with low expectations. I expected yet another clone of the casual yet fancy Pub-ish places. I was expecting good, but not WOW! Great

The food was basic with a twist but not so much that it made the food weird. I had the basic Pub burger on Jennifer's request and she was dead on right.
While she was making drinks for the servers she continued to tell us about the standards of their drinks and food and beer.

I go to a lot of places in this town and see a lot of lackluster bartenders going through the motions. That always amazes me. It was refreshing to see someone taking pride in her craft and really make sure the guest felt at home and welcomed.

My only criticism is the uniform. I saw a lot of female workers wearing attractive tank-tops that looked like they were made for females yet Jennifer was wearing what amounted to a potato sack shapeless men's t-shirt. I'm not expecting Pub 1842 to be ""Hooter"" (wouldn't go there if it were) but please have the women wear the women's uniform.

As long as Pub 1842 continues to have top line food, craft beer and drinks and workers like Jennifer,  Pub 1842 will do great in Vegas.",G3o7E76fOCy5G7_XV7rxbQ,1,0,5,AC0TOY4NA7wVElVFCtwHEg

4074619,2013-08-30,1,YnmtUJGqQIQL9tz1MRyfqA,"I love this place. We've been in Vegas quite a number of times this summer including our wedding, and by FAR, this has been the best gastropub we've set our feet in. 

1. Our favorite Bartender: LIZ
 I love this gal. She was the first person to serve us at the bar when we first visited, and she is AWESOME. She knows everything and anything there is to know about the beers they serve, will make you FANTASTIC cocktails (even come up with something new on the fly based on your mood), offer you just what you're craving, and is sneaky quick about making sure your eating/drink area is clean and pleasant. We easily spend over $100 between the two of us when she's working and keeps us coming back for more. It's nice to have a fav spot to grub and drink where you know the staff makes you feel welcomed.

2. The Food.
Okay, first off, this is frickin' VEGAS. DUH, everything on the strip is going to be hella expensive. But you know what? For the price point, this place serves, HANDS DOWN, the best food. I put this place down as ""good for 'Late Night' and 'Desserts'"" because gastropub food only goes so far and if you're expecting ""sit-down dinner,"" this place probably wouldn't cut it. But, if you're out with friends and wanna get some grub before you hit the tables/slots and have a couple beers, this is the place to do it. If you have a party of 4 or more, I recommend sharing the HUGE nacho platter (comes on a frickin' baking sheet) or if you have a small party, get the fried pickles (""frickles!"") and an entree to share. The baked ziti is our favorite; between hubby and I, we've ordered it twice within the span of 72hours and it's been awesome every time.

3. The Ambiance
It's so relaxing and nice to just be able to come in, sit down, have a beer, get some grub, and zone out watching some sports news. And this pub just gets it right on the money. I have been to many a gastropubs on the strip and I don't quite know what it is that other places don't have. I assume it has something to do with the fact that they have the bar in the center and it really focuses on its forte--being the best beer pub on the street. They also have a dart board and beer pong table in the corner if you're so inclined; for no additional charge (I assume; we weren't charged to play). I also love that EVERYTHING in print (menus, posters, coasters, etc.) at this place is so frickin' beautifully designed. I've gone to many a places where I'm sure they've got some great food, but their menu was soooooo poorly designed it just ruined the whole eating experience for me. 

4. The Service.
What can I say, this really just reiterates number 1, but I want to make sure the whole restaurant also gets recognition. The food comes piping hot right out of the open kitchen and you can really see the kitchen working it, every moment that it's open. You can really tell the people behind the bar and the kitchen really works as a team. 

...Gosh, writing this makes me hungry. Maybe we should get some lunch there. Haven't tried them for lunch yet. Yeah, frickles sound good right about now. Bye guys!",7w4zfX5JJgOQlp64sWvkHA,1,1,5,_w1C-uf-kXr0zA4M5oG3sA

4151022,2013-09-18,0,YnmtUJGqQIQL9tz1MRyfqA,"Bad experience. Specially with the totally uninterested crew. Both the kitchen staff and the waiter. 

Arriving around 2030 there was a waiting list for 15 minutes. No problem. We put our name down and (upon suggestion from the hostess) tried to have a drink at the bar. But....the bar was crowd and it seemed not to be possible to get attention to order a drink. Probably we looked a little bit desorientated because one of the waiters asked me whether I was looking for the restrooms. No....looking for a place to wait for our table, preferebly with a drink. He appointed us a table and send a waitress over to take our orders So far, so good.

Ordering dinner also went well. Big selection of beer and (pub)food. But considering it's pubfood, pricy. (Minus one star.) Our party decided to share two appetizers (drumsticks and duck spring rolls) and to go with the hamburgers and a salad as a main course.

First of all: everything arrived at the same time. Hardly fitting the table. Nobody seemed to find that strange. (Minus the second start.) The waiter (very obligatory) asked if everything was good. I answered that we were very dissappointed that every thing was served at the same time. He only nodded and said 'Yeah, that's a bit strange, but I don't know either why THEY did that'. Sorry, I don't like it when staff is blaming each other and is not interested in the guests or in solving the problem. He just walked of. And that was the third star I deducted.

Portion are huge, but I rather have a smaller portion, better prices, a little bit more quality and definetly a much much better staff. More interested in the guests. Both the waiters and the kitchen. There someone could also have noticed that it's strange to serve appetizers and main courses, all hot dishes at the same time. I think the waiter wanted us out in a hurry to get the table free for the next fools. And the big portions only leads to high bills and a lot of waist (think about our planet......).

Drumsticks and springrolls we're good, hamburgers also. The greek salad was very dissappointing. Dry and salt lamb meatballs, too much dressing, too soon poured over the greens so they were weak. I shalln't deducte an extra star for the poor salad because the MGM deserves an extra star because this (although we had a bad experience) is much better than the former fish restaurant that occupied the spot for years.

Update 2016: Things have changed. But nog for the better. Mothersday, 2030, hardly 1/4 off the tables in use. The menu seems to be smaller than before. We both ordered the 1842 Burger after the waiter asked for our choice for the third time in the fitst five minutes. Burger was oké, but expensive ($20). The fries were probably 'gourmet' but not to my liking. A bit sweet. All together: still a 2 star experience. Will not be back.

I found Pub 1842 on the Thrillist list of best burgers in Vegas (https://www.thrillist.com/eat/las-vegas/best-burgers-in-vegas), and I strongly recommend it if you're looking for a delicious-yet-reasonable meal in the MGM Grand.

I thoroughly enjoyed the classic 1842 Burger, topped with caramelized onions, mushrooms, and truffle aioli, with BBQ seasoned fries that will remind you of BBQ Lay's Potato Chips!

Warning: the hot soft pretzels are highly addictive!! They come with a poached egg swimming in beer cheese (topped with chives) for dipping, which is the perfect savory flavor combo to go with the salted pretzel pieces.

Note, the burgers significantly outshine the BBQ ribs.

We heard about the lobster corn dogs and we had to order them.  My wife (who doesn't eat meat) loved them because they tasted like a corn dog.  I didn't care for them because they tasted like a corn dog.  The flavors were very true to life and the sauce was excellent, but at over $5 each I felt the lobster got a little overworked.  Maybe a lesser ingredient would have made an equally awesome flavor.  But alas.  

My wife got a kale and avocado salad which she loved, but I'm not a huge fan of bitter greens.  I guess everyone has their thing. 

I got the ""Champ"" burger.  Best burger patty I've ever had.  So juicy and flavorful.  The sauce was really good, but a little messy and who doesn't love a ton of bacon.  This thing is a mess though, don't try to be impressing any ladies when you order it.

4447980,2015-02-25,0,YnmtUJGqQIQL9tz1MRyfqA,"I like Pub 1842. There's good food, good service- can't complain! 

I remember going to their grand opening 2 years ago or so, I was excited to check out Michael Mina's new pub. They brought around appetizers so we were able to try a few of their menu items. The duck spring rolls and lobster corn dogs were delicious. Not your typical pub food!

Since then, I've been back to Pub 1842 quite a few times. I'm pretty simple when it comes to pub/bar food. For a starter, I would recommend their pretzel. Comes out freshly baked with a beer cheese dipping sauce. There's a poached egg and bacon bits in the cheese... Amazing! 

If you want something light, I would absolutely recommend the Avocado Kale Caesar Salad. Kale has a unique bitter taste which some people love/hate. I personally am a fan and think it's a great contrast to the Caesar dressing. You can add protein it if you like (I've added the garlic shrimp and the salmon before, I prefer the shrimp). 

If you want to go for a burger, I've tried the 1842 burger and it's a solid choice if you like truffle and mushrooms. I've tried the Double Smoked Bacon burger which is meaty and flavorful, with large pieces of bacon and smoked gouda on top of the patty. They have some unique burgers too, a Peanut Butter Crunch burger and a Korean BBQ Salmon burger. I haven't tried either of those yet but I'm sure I will at some point!

Happy hour drink menu is decent. Cocktails and wine are included, as well as $3 drafts. I selected a drink that is pretty much a Moscow Mule with a fancy-fied name for a gastropub. I got a pinot noir in at the very end of the HH, it was decent, a fairly run of the mill California varietal.

Food is not included on the HH menu. O well. I was starving. Ordered the Double Dare Dog for $19. *facepalm* Well what can you expect? I shelled out twenty bucks for two hotdogs, wrapped in bacon, topped with guacamole, salsa (pico de galloesque) and Chicharrones. Came with unimpressive Luke warm fries. Hot dog WAS good. Flavors were playful, different. What you would expect from a gastropub. FYI: I had a serious tummy ache later... I think it was just too rich for my system.

Service was laaaah-AME! We were ignored at the bar by the bartender on numerous occasions. My drink sat empty without being asked for a new one. Bartender seemed uninterested... That is until we waved her down. 

Ambiance is.... Fancy sports bar with expensive bar food. You must get ready to break out monies and just not give a crap about the fact you're paying way too much because you're on the Strip and it's Michael Mina.

They didn't have our game on (even though it was available to them) and they refused to change any of the screens - even though there were plenty of empty seats and plenty of screens left unwatched by current customers.

Food: Somewhat decent but very overpriced. The lobster corn dogs sounded interesting but were a joke.  You get three small ones and they're nothing special.  The nachos were on a fairly large platter - but also nothing special.  We ordered ours with pork and we noticed only a couple pieces.

Beer: For a place that uses beer as a selling point, they really fail.  First of all, their beer is listed on the menu from ""lightest to darkest"" which is a complete joke if you know anything about beer.  No mention of beer style or hops... just darkness.  So dumb.

I came here though the suggestion of a close friend of mine, who was eager to come here. When we approached the restaurant, the hostess warmly greeted us, and gave us some suggestions on her favorite menu items. When we finally sat down, our server IMMEDIATELY greeted us and gave us water. He was well informed, clear, efficient, and funny. My friend and I decided to go for their burger special which includes any burger, a drink, and a cookie for $18.42 (so cute given the name!)

My friend ordered the bacon burger, and I ordered the 1842 burger. If you like a simple burger, go for the bacon burger. If you want a burger that is messy, filled with stuff, and bursting with flavor, get the 1842 burger. The fries were equally as delicious as the burger, and the cookie that came with the deal was soft, warm, and soooo good. I must say, I was impressed.

We had the nachos for an appetizers which came on a big baking sheet, I like the use of pots and pans to serve food. For entrees I went with the Pulled Pork, Brisket, and Spare Rib Platter with a side of Kale Slaw. The kale salad was good but my wife's not a fan of mayo in cole slaw. The spare ribs were a little tough, they didn't fall off the bone like I was expecting. The pulled pork was good but probably no different than Chipolte's Pulled Pork. The brisket was a little dry but the biscuit that came on the side was my favorite. My wife had the burger Medium Well which is a terrible way to eat a burger but that was really tasty and moist so they did well there.

My biggest beef would be that the bar seating is what they use for their dining guest.

The significant and I had reasonably high expectations for this place, given Chef Mina's successes at his other restaurants, but were slightly bummed to find out that Pub 1842 very well resembled to the Bourbon Steak & Pub in Santa Clara, CA, which was just mediocre on my list. 

I understand that they're both Gastropubs and all, but nothing mind blowing came out of my experience whatsoever. 

...Perhaps I didn't have enough drinks prior to eating at 1842?!

Not sure what it was but I wasn't really feelin' the vibe.

For our main entree, I tried the well acclaimed 1842 Burger ($18) whereas the significant tried the Double Smoked Bacon Burger ($19).

One of the main reason why I chose the 1842 Burger was because it had aioli in it, however when finally bit into what seemed to be a well-crafted burger, I was saddened by the fact that it didn't quite taste as good as it appeared. WOMP WOMP! The aioli was supposed to be enriched with hints of mushroom in it. Instead, it was super dense, not creamy at all in texture as I have experienced many times in other venues. Moreover, it tasted pretty darn bland. Huge disappointment, especially since my meal cost $18!

In all honestly, the Double Smoked Bacon Burger seemed much more appetizing than the 1842 Burger. 

Only downside? ...It was too big! Yes, burgers can be ""too big"", to a point where someone can no longer enjoy it because they're unable to bite into all the layers. 

I was better off just eating the season fries that came along with the entrée. They were perfectly topped with cajun and herb seasoning. Finished them in a matter of 10 minutes.

Since I'm all about second chances, I look forward to trying 1842 the next time I visit Vegas. I'll consider trying out all the starters they have available in hopes that I won't need to order a burger to fill me up. 

With all that said, I give this venue a solid 3 stars, mainly for quick, friendly service and a clean, subtle rustic-themed venue.

Food-wise, the wedge salad is good-the balsamic drizzle along with a lightly creamy but chunky bleu cheese dressing was perfect.   Shrimp & grits was good-blackened shrimp-and the grits were just right texture-wise.   A slice of Andouille made it every better.

The wife and I were walking through the MGM on a Monday afternoon in search of a good cocktail.  We decided to check out Pub 1842, the newish Michael Mina joint in the space formerly occupied by his Seablue.  We'd always been impressed with the level of service and quality of drinks (and food, too) at other Michael Mina places we'd been to around the country and Pub 1842 was no exception.  Upon looking over the mid-sized cocktail list, I had high hopes when I saw that they offered an extensive lineup of barrel-aged cocktails ($13).  I enjoy the subtle, yet very pleasant effects aging in charred oak barrels has on cocktails.  I was immediately sold on their barrel-aged Vieux Carré.  The hard edges of this boozy classic were rounded off without losing any of the distinct notes of the disparate spirits comprising the drink.  It was nicely done and as good a rendition of a Vieux Carré that I've ever had.  For my second round, I had the barrel-aged Negroni.  It, too, possessed the familiar bitter notes that make a Negroni delicious, yet the barrel aging once again smoothed out the drink, improving on the classic.  Topping off our experience was the service we received from Alli, our bartender.  We could tell she enjoyed her job and was passionate about her craft.  She was friendly, knowledgeable in explaining Pub 1842's cocktail program, and attentive as she took great care of us.  She, just as much as the high quality drinks she served, made a lasting positive impression.  We'll be back and next time we'll try the food.",le3Xn9Mheb1hNxWurF7RSw,3,1,5,XZ1YiekLd8Ych_CWp3RJFg

Remember, Mina is a master of seafood; namely lobster so...

There back!  Lobster corn dogs.  Incredibly sweet chunks of perfectly cooked lobster in a crispy, fluffy, semi sweet corn dog coating with a tangy whole grain mustard and crème fraiche.  Simply put, good eats.

Other starters such as the duck spring rolls with ginger chili dipping sauce, mint and cilantro (excellent with the earthy flavor of moist duck accented by a decent ""Asian"" dipping sauce that brings forth the flavor of the oily duck meat and a great, light, crisp tempura or maitake mushrooms in a soy, scallion dipping sauce are excellent.  As with all Mina's restaurants, try what sounds different.  While not authentic Asian, still very good flavors.

For larger plates, the Lobster roll with jalapeno creamed corn is excellent.  It's not Northeast authentic but who cares.  Rich, perfectly cooked lobster in a crisp, buttery roll surrounded by a very spicy creamed corn.  The flavor of the jalapeno brings a rich chili taste that contrast well with the sweet, cold water lobster.  The Korean BBQ salmon burger is also good eats.  Soy marinated, cooked medium, and accompanied by cucumber kimchi and ginger aioli is incredibly well balanced.  Complex texture.  Simply delicious.

I was right! 

I tried the lobster corn dogs... they were okay. I liked the mustard sauce, but really, considering how they were, and how much they were, they're probably the least value for your money. I would pass on these again. 

But the BURGERS were VERY TASTY. Everyone liked theirs, and I enjoyed a bite of my friend's salmon burger, too! 

I opted for the Peanut Butter Crunch burger, which is a burger with bacon jam and chips (read: Ruffles - the only thing on the burger not made in-house, or fresh). Our server told me it was going to be one of the heavier burgers on the menu, but I still managed to finish it rather quickly and cleanly, surprisingly so. It made me want to put chunky peanut butter on all the things... 

A friend ordered a shake, but it took forever to come out because they said the shake machine was broken and the dude had to do it by hand. It precluded us from getting any desserts, since most included some sort of shake! 

If I have a burger craving in Vegas, I will definitely come here. We even go to sit at a booth with good people-watching potential. And Vegas is a good place to people watch!

the girl who waited on us at our table was great however. we ordered the burger and split it. $1.50 to split it which is annoying but minor compared to NYC prices to split something. we split it because we thought it would be huge. it's a $20 burger but it was not really that big. we could have got an entire burger each but the fries had some sort of BBQ flavoring on them which neither of us liked. overall the food was pretty good. the service was good. the hostesses get -1 star. i wish i could get their names and get them fired. i've never felt more unwelcome at a restaurant in my life.i only ate there because it was next to the venue for phish and it was late and i did not want food court food. but i ended up getting food court food the next night for dinner and got much better, welcoming service, which is ridiculous.

Friendly service in a cozy atmosphere with solid eats. Very laid back and unpretentious. Actually a fun spot. Plenty of flat screens to watch a game. A terrific selection of brews with over 40 selections of beer on tap and in bottles/cans, including ales, stouts and lagers - oh my!

Had to go with one of their specialties. The PUB 1842 Burger - caramelized onions, mushrooms and truffle aioli. It was $17 which seems a bit pricey but it was really tasty. Cooked just right and juicy. The crispy bbq fries that came with it were a good side. We all know that dining in casinos is always on the pricier end, so it was kind of expected, but at least this was worth it as the portion was pretty large.

5139143,2014-10-31,2,YnmtUJGqQIQL9tz1MRyfqA,"The Peanut Butter Crunch Burger sounds whack-a-doodle but Yelpers rave so I had to try. I was picturing something along the lines of a Thai peanut sauce-esque burger but nope, it's straight up crunchy peanut butter sauce, served with slightly sweet bacon jam & potato chips for that extra crunch. 

For a burger cooked medium rare it was rather dry and not at all juicy so I was kind of disappointed. It also came with a boatload of fries that was spiced with barbecue flavoring. That was also unexpected. It was just okay for me. Nothing ""wow"" about it. I guess it did save me a trip to Potato Corner which was on my to-do list of places to check out but ran out of time. $17 for a burger with fries is rather steep but the portions are huge.

Also had the Jungle Juice cocktail since it was only $7 at Happy Hour. I was trying to decide between that or the Soda Popinski. Since Jungle Juice was one of the Happy Hour selections that decision was easily made for me. After a long day traversing the Strip it hit the spot. 

Service was friendly and excellent but the food has to sing and unfortunately it didn't. Overall this place is just A-Okay for me.

Happy Hour is Monday-Thursday from 5 to 7pm according to their website but I've seen their HH's vary so don't quote me on that. Select items are discounted so be sure to inquire. Cool place to catch a game on tv as there are several televisions strategically placed throughout the pub so it can get rather loud at times.

Located inside the confines of the MGM Grand which is a challenging casino to navigate. This is one casino where bigger is not necessarily better. You will feel like you walked a mile inside this monolith just getting in and out of this place.

5279495,2016-02-11,5,YnmtUJGqQIQL9tz1MRyfqA,"At one time proclaiming Michael Mina my favorite American Chef it was with gusto that I made my way to PUB1842 shortly after its debut, but clearly suffering an identity crisis as a restauranteur attempting to turn casual it was that experience followed by the disaster of Stripsteak that suddenly caused me caution - questions as to whether Mina had ""sold-out"" and whether his concepts could ever again be as innovative or well executed as before thankfully answered affirmatively by the 2015 launch of Bardot Brasserie, thus providing the impetus to investigate past impressions once more.

Now in its third year of operation, long past the days of lobster corn dogs or confit duck with an all-in focus on American eats like burgers, wings and 'cue, PUB1842 continues to occupy a sizable space within The District of The MGM Grand and although Chef Tony Schutz may not be a household name  amongst tourist or locals a tasting of the menu shows the work of someone with more passion than most would imagine from mere *bar food*, each and every item not only ""better than it has to be"" but a labor intensive investment in quality ingredients treated with both care and skill.

Arranging the tasting through Josh Smith of Bardot, a fixed price giving Tony carte blanche to serve as he'd like, it was just after PUB1842's 11:30am opening that myself and three friends were greeted by Assistant General Manager Dana Hostmeyer and led to a table, the nearly-two dozen menu items to follow offered in sharable portions with beverage service coordinated by a staff that is friendly, timely and well informed.

Declining beer flights, none of us imbibing but instead opting for iced tea and coffee from LAMill, it was following greetings from Chef Schutz that the the afternoon got underway and kicking things off with meaty drumsticks alongside lightly battered calamari the quality of accompanying sauces showed good attention to detail, the same to be said of an enormous ""half portion"" of PUB1842's signature nachos tinged in Fresno peppers balanced by a cheesy blend and chili made from slow-roasted Heritage Pork.

Amused by the ""Celebrity Chef"" endorsement stamped on a menu substantially overhauled from day one it was not long before a duo of salads was delivered by Tony and Dana, the vibrant beets accentuated by cheese and spiced pecans while the Chef's Special Chop Salad looked eastward with chicharones and Char Sui liberally tossed in a bed of Napa cabbage, shredded carrots, and Shitake mushrooms along with pickled peppers, peanuts, and a tangy ginger sauce.

Requesting the Beercheese pretzels outright, the longtime menu staple with a poached egg still a highlight from visit one, little has changed as the sauce remains spoon-worthy long after the soft batons are finished and  moving on to a quartet of sliders one would be hard-pressed to name a ""best of"" as all were well crafted with bronzed buns perfectly amenable to copious toppings, the Peanut Butter Crunch warranting praise for both the housemde Bacon Jam as well as Pimento Cheese while the Korean BBQ Salmon was surprisingly craveable thanks to the quality of the meat and fermented flavors complimented by ginger aioli.

Lamenting the quality of barbeque in Las Vegas, much like most who have properly investigated the genre across the land, it was with admitted skepticism that I approached  Schutz's loaded silver tray, but setting aside pulled pork that trended more Kansas City style sweet than my preferences for Carolina vinegar the answer to ""where to find good BBQ in Las Vegas?""  was quickly answered, the sticky ribs easily sliding from bones with a rich, porky sapor while the fatty brisket melted across the palate with uncompromising smokiness accentuated by salt and pepper, even the chicken noteworthy as crisp skin clung to juicy flesh beneath.

Not particularly sold on the side of Kale, though Butternut Squash and fried Brussels Sprouts with Apples scored high marks along with pepper-spike cornbread that necessitated extras served with smooth honey butter, it is somewhat disappointing that low sales have set limitations for Mina's ever-strong pastry program, but doing their best with what is offered it should be assumed that any shake made with Ice Cream from Straus Family Creamery is a safe bet, as too is the simple apple cobbler while the Sticky Toffee Cake puts a cocoa and coffee spin on the British classic beneath boozy caramel sauce and salty popcorn.

****A bit more pricey than some would expect for 'bar food,' though no moreso many Las Vegas Boulevard properties offering a similar bill of fare that is likely far less well-crafted, PUB1842 has clearly matured nicely under the care of Chef Tony...now if only they could compliment that Barbeque with some Pecan Pie or Banana Pudding.

RECOMMENDED: Hot Soft Pretzels, Cornbread, Korean BBQ Salmon Burger, Crispy Fried Brussels Sprouts, BBQ Brisket or Chicken, Chocolate Sticky Toffee Cake.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,16,12,4,RqGz8Z6Yxr8qiXTwifSvOg

I had my share of 2 beers but felt absolutely nothing. Our server was awesome. We had lots of questions and requests and he delivered. We tried the hot soft pretzels, 1842 burger, peanut butter crunch burger, a bit of everything BBQ plate and the baked ziti ""pie"".

Hot Soft Pretzels:
Pretzels with 'Merican beer cheese and poached egg. We were iffy about the poached egg. One person in our group is not a big fan of eggs and I'm not a fan of egg yolks especially if it's runny. But at the same time, we want to know what it's like to have it the way it was meant to be served. Our server gave us two sauces: one with poached egg and one without. Brilliant! A friend had to mix the poached egg and 'Merican cheese together as I looked away. The egg made the sauce a bit thicker. The pretzels themselves weren't all that great or soft. 3/5

1842 Burger:
Caramelized onions, mushrooms and truffle aioli with a side of fries. I asked for extra truffle aioli for my fries. Medium-rare perfection, natural sweetness from the onions and the flavor and fragrance of truffle aioli. The fries were thin and crispy and sprinkled with chopped parsley. They put pickle spears on top of the bun - no pickle juice touched my meat, yay! 4/5

Peanut Butter Crunch Burger:
Bacon jam, crushed wavy potato chips and chunky peanut sauce, fries on the side...pimiento on the side per our request. This seemed so interesting so gave it a try. It wasn't exactly peanut butter they slathered on the bun but a peanut sauce with chunks of peanuts. I tried it with and without pimiento. With the pimiento, it was like eating a Thai burger - nutty and slightly spicy. It was good the first few bites but the texture and flavor overload wore me out that I couldn't finish it. 3.5/5

A Bit of Everything BBQ Plate:
Ribs, brisket and pulled pork. Comes with kale slaw, jalapeno cornbread, baked squash and baked beans on the side. The meats were tender, sweet but vinegary. ""This is better than Rollin Smoke."" 4/5 

I was so full I didn't try the bake ziti ""pie"" so you'll have to wait for John F's review - if he ever writes one.

You can't go wrong with a massive burger with bacon jam, potato chips, and a peanut sauce that tastes like peanut butter but isn't quite that thick. It might sounds weird but it is a must try. Be warned though that it is very filling. I like to think I can eat my fair share but I wasn't able to finish this massive burger. If you aren't totally starving you could probably split this. It comes with fries that were just okay but nothing special. It is somewhat pricey but that's to be expected for a place in a Vegas casino.

This new restaurant is a major step down in the wrong direction. The two stars are because service was really great. The food, though, gets a one star at best! This is so not typical for a Michael Mina restaurant!
I ordered the warm pretzel with cheese/ bacon as a starter for the table. Not impressive, yet rather basic. I could have done without it as I have had so much better at other restaurants. I then ordered the hummus/tahini/tomato with falafel sandwich, with Salad on the side ( extra $2 for salad instead of barbecue fries). I love falafel and know what it should taste and look like. I will describe the sandwich in one word: gross! It was way too fatty with too much tahini sauce and the falafel patty tasted like anything but falafel! I expected that it would be in a pita or wrap. It was presented like a hamburger.. Just terrible! The salad was just green leaves with an overly sweet vinaigrette on the side... Disappointing. 
The coffee was decent! 
My friend ordered their 'house specialty' burger, which she said was ok/ good, yet not great or amazing. 
This place is likely great for grabbing a beer and watching sports on some screens. It probably has good barbecue, yet like many people, I prefer to make healthier choices that I expect should be really good as on the menu! 
Therefore, will not be going back for lunch and not sure if I will ever try dinner there as lunch was pretty bad.

1. The food was hit and miss. My fiancé got the Double Dog Dare which was decent. I got the 1842 Burger. I asked for it medium and instead got it burnt. I could literally taste the burnt outside with every bite. Quite possibly the worst burger I've ever had. I couldn't ask for a new one because I never saw my server. Which leads to my next point. 

2. The service was awful. We saw our waiter one time to order and that was it. No drink refills no anything. After having had finished, I waited 15 minutes before finally asking a busser to get our check for us. 

3. Lastly I had a 25 dollar gift certificate from Restaurant.com. I tried to use it on my phone and they wouldn't allow it. Like Groupon there is a button to press to validate it specifically for your phone but they refused. I asked the manager why and he said they just needed a printed page with the same exact code they would put in. Why other restaurants all honor the mobile coupon and they don't, I don't know.

5626907,2015-02-07,0,YnmtUJGqQIQL9tz1MRyfqA,"Customer Service Lesson 101: Incompetent Hostess Lost a Customer

I went to Michael Mina's Pub at the MGM for a late lunch (about 1:30 PM) and was offered a choice of table or bar seating. I requested a table because I needed a little space to complete some work. Yet, I was escorted to the noisier and less comfortable bar area and offered a small ""highchair"" style table that was very cramped. This wasn't what I had in mind when originally offered a table vs bar seating.

Looking around, I saw many empty regular tables and politely requested one of those instead. I was told all the tables were reserved for lunch and unavailable and that I'd have to wait at least 15 minutes to sit down. At 1:30, it was after the prime lunch crowd. It wasn't that busy and it seemed odd that all the tables would be reserved at that hour. I pointed out that there were a lot of empty tables and again requested one of them. Annoyed at the lack of effort to find a solution, it went downhill from there, and I ultimately decided to find another spot where I could have lunch.

I ended up eating in the food court adjacent to Michael Mina's where there were plenty of open tables. Upon completing my lunch at 2:15 (about 45 minutes after I first went to Michael Mina's), I was amused to see several vacant tables at Michael Mina's. including those supposed ""reserved"" tables that sat empty, just as they were when I had first arrived.

I don't dispute that some tables may have been reserved, but I doubt all of them were reserved for lunch at that hour. The restaurant appeared to be at 50% capacity. But it was more the lack of attempt to retain a customer, or say, ""Let me see what I can do."" Instead, the hostess let a first-time customer walk out the door, possibly losing a customer for life. There is way too much competition and choice. Restaurants need to hire, train, and empower their personnel to use a little common sense. Sadly, this is increasingly rare. Hence, my 2-star review is based on a poor service experience only and not the quality or taste of the food, which I never had an opportunity to try.",10v37RNGRykJrC5OWfBsaA,2,1,2,TDN4EVGqUTwthZA6nS17jw

This is a awesome pub dishing out delicious eats.  PUB is your typical pub with a plethora of popular bar eats with a fancy twist.  While staying at the MGM Grand my friends and I were in search of legit grub. My Yelp search led me here.

The menu boasted heavily about the craft burgers, nachos and fried pickles. They had me at Nachos. So my girl group headed in and we were seated right away. We were seated next to a wedding party closest to the kitchen. Seating was comfortable.  The ambiance is a modern pub. A bar closest to the door with flat screens and the rest is booths and tables.

We walked in with our drinks from Fat Tuesday and started off with the Nachos. The Nachos. Man...those nachos.  Life changing. A XXL sized tray of Crisp, warm tortilla chips topped with cilantro,  black beans, tomato,  cheddar, sour cream. This is a prime choice when with a large party. We ordered 2 Salmon burgers, side salad A bacon cheeseburger and of course I ordered the vegetarian Falafel burger with a side salad. These burgers were....some heavy weights. HUMONGOUS portions. 

The Falafel burger was the best I ever had like Drake. Crisp. Perfection. Chick peas drizzled with some banging Tahini. I ate half and saved the rest for my late night snack. My girls didn't care for the Salmon burgers.  They felt they were dry and I was happy I stuck to my falafel.

         This much highly anticipated PUB 1842 by Michael Mina Group, recently opened at the MGM, the former spot of Sea Blue (also Michael Mina Group). Since I'm a big fan of Michael Mina restos, I was in town for work, yes during the crazy freaking EDC nightmare! I thought I dropped in for a quick visit, we ended up had a full dinner here. 

          PUB 1842 is an American pub featuring a wide selection of global beers, unique whiskey and hand-crafted coctailks by no other than the Barman/Mixologist Carlo splendorini from Michael Mina and RN74 in San Francisco. Pub 1842 offers 40 selections of beer, including ales, pilsners, stouts and lagers. TVs through out the bar,  I can only imagine Football seasons, it's going to be banana here! 

          Pub 1842 also offers  playful menu including a peanut butter crunch burger with bacon jam, potato chips and pimento cheese, the 1842 burger with caramelized onions, mushrooms, blue cheese and truffle aioli. Menu is very reasonable in price, all snacks $8-$15, appertizers $9-18, burgers $15-$19, entrees $18-32.

        What we ordered on our visit JUNE 2013:

- Homemade Frickles - crunchy fried pickles $8 - lovely, perfect snack

- Crab Louie Deviled Eggs - Maryland blue crab, dill $9 - seriously perfect bite

- Lobster Corn dogs, whole-grain mustard crème fraiche $14, Michael Mina's signature dish that you can find at Arcadia Steakhouse in San Jose, and a few Bourbon steakhouses through out the country.

- Ahi Tuna Poke, avocado, shrimp crackers, butter lettuce - also similar to Michael Mina's signature dish at his flagship restos Michael Mina at the Bellagio and San Francisco, but for less! 

- jumbo lump Crab Cake, shaved apples, green goddess, white balsamic $19 we all enjoyed this dish.

- 1842 Burger - caramelized onions, mushrooms,  blue cheese, truffle aioli - All American Wagyu beef, $18 - this burger was so juicy, tasty and the bun was perfectly shiny toasted. A MUST ORDER if you are a burger freak!

- A delish wild salmon entree $29, with corn, tomato and a lot of love by chef Michael Mina himself. It was DELICIOUS! 

CAKE & SHAKES for $9 each only, all 3, my bestie and her boyfriend die happy :-) 

- Lemon Curd Chiffon Cake & orange vanilla frappe - blackberry jam

- Shredded Coconut Cake & pina colada milkshake - white chocolate frosting

- Big Chocolate Layer Cake & chocolate malted milkshake - boiled chocolate icing

          The service was perfect, quick, efficient, and pleasant. This was day 4th since they opened and I heard they did over 1,000 serving, that's AMAZING.

          Chef Michael Mina was there at the counter going through tickets of orders at 6 PM on a THUR night, and the place was jammed packed. Thank you PUB 1842 and chef Michael Mina for another amazing meals and took so good care of us. Until a few weeks from now, we will pay another visit. 

         If you love beer, pub, burger, snack and a sport fan, PUB 1842 is a hot spot now in Las Vegas at the MGM. You can thank me later!",JADdo9NEeO5Az9aOYbyvZA,15,11,5,9Nwr2a3ucH4m1c9OkhbkcQ

5675459,2013-06-18,3,YnmtUJGqQIQL9tz1MRyfqA,"This is a much welcome addition to the MGM Grand! I was lucky enough to attend one of the mock service nights on Friday night. 

If you ever dined at Seablue, you will recognize the set up, because it's pretty much the same. Just the decor has changed,  basically.  In general,  the Pub is very inviting.  There are large booths on one side of the bar, then tall tables on the other side. Then there is regular table seating and an elevated area that appeared to have taps at the tables.

The menu is definitely upscale pub grub, and prices reflect that. However, there are many creative items, in addition to classics to choose from. 

We started out with 3 appetizers: house made frickles (fried pickles), lump crab deviled eggs and lobster corn dogs. 1st off, the pickles were amazing.  The spears were thick and retained their crunch. They were probably my favorite app. The lobster corn dogs were also delicious,  but they were a little greasy and fell off the stick. The crab deviled eggs were not my favorite,  but I can't really put my finger on why.

For entrées we had the baked ziti and the peanut butter crunch burger. The presentation of the ziti needs some work - it came out in a metal tin, which was placed on a dinner plate. Except the plate wasn't big enough for the tin and it wobbled while you ate. My suggestion is to place the tin on a cutting board to serve it. But the ziti was REALLY good,  so there is nothing bad to say about it otherwise.  

The burger was really the highlight of the meal. It was cooked perfectly,  was super juicy and served with fries. It was topped with peanut butter and potato chips,  and my mouth was in heaven! It was the perfect combo of savory,  salty and sweet.

We didn't have dessert,  but did look at the menu. They have ""cakes and shakes,"" which was a cool concept. 

They have great cocktails - my 1st was a bourbon drink, made with Bulleit and a strawberry pepper juice. So yummy.  Their beer list is pretty decent,  and they offer ""beer wheels,"" which are basically 8 tasters. 

I can't wait to go back and try some of the other menu items! Of course the service was great, even though they are still working out some of the new restaurant kinks. They officially open 6/18, make sure you go check it out!",rKkpHJkJ27xOwnhy_bMkvA,8,6,4,WnpB8OmNbRL1HMQanfbRrQ

the decorations and theme of the restaurant is casual and on the light side. Tv's everywhere of course and entertaining sayings on the walls.

Had the fried pickles appetizer which is an entire spear deep fried. Not crazy about it but apparently it's what all the cool restaurants are doing these days.

I had the shrimp and grits which wasn't terrible but not amazing either. I felt like I was eating out of a sombrero because the plate had a ridiculous rim, and the grits were more like mashed potatoes. The shrimp had good flavor and it also had a pretty tasty piece of sausage in there too. 

Also tried the brisket: I'll forgive them because it's not Texas, but it didn't blow my mind.

The 1842 burger on the other hand blew my mind, and upon tasting it after finishing my meal and deciding I was full, proceeded to eat half of my friends burger. Mushrooms were fantastic and some crack laced aoli I think.

The Mac and cheese is also fantastic. Great flavor with actual melted cheese instead of the packet crap and its dusted with a spice that I think is also laced with crack.

Finally, dessert...
The butterscotch custard is heaven in a little bowl with a solid layer of caramel and a little bit of whip cream and something crunchy. We also had some chocolate cake which has a river of caramel mousse next to it with caramel corn for crunch.

5797823,2013-06-24,0,YnmtUJGqQIQL9tz1MRyfqA,"My husband and I are big fans of Michael Mina and his newest venture did not disappoint.  

We went in and sat at the bar last Friday night - opening weekend.  There was a good crowd but we were still able to grab a couple of the last seats when we showed up just before 6:00 p.m.  Overall, the staff was friendly and service was good.  The bartender seemed a little bit overwhelmed, but she was handling the crowd and the drink menu well.  Michael Mina's drink lists (here and at his other restaurants) demand a bit more out of his bar staff than many other restaurants.  Nonetheless, she was friendly, knowledgeable about the menu, the drinks, and Chef Mina's cuisine generally.

Chef Mina was expediting that night and was working - not there just for show and glad-handing.  He came over to speak to us briefly (and was very gracious) but quickly returned to work.  We saw him send a couple of dishes back and seemed to lay eyes on every dish that went out while we were there.  We observed him interacting with his  kitchen staff and his wait staff about service.

The drink list is a little more accessible than his other Vegas restaurants - more beer and ""fru-fru"" drinks (smaller drink menu and not focused as much on old school whiskey and gin cocktails).  I had the Heist and the Jungle Juice.  The Heist was a fantastic cocktail - great fresh strawberry flavor but without being overly sweet.  The Jungle Juice was a bit sweet for my tastes, but a good drink.  My husband had the Old White and an Old Fashioned.  Oddly, the Old White came in a shot glass, but was a very good drink.  The Old Fashioned was superb.

We started with the Crispy Chicken Drumsticks with chipotle lime glaze and the Homemade Frickles.  Both were excellent.  The chicken consisted of four regular sized drumsticks (not drumettes), which were amazingly crispy and the chipotle lime glaze was both spicy and flavorful.  The fried pickles were battered, light, and crispy, but the batter didn't overwhelm the pickle.  We tried to order the Lobster Corn Dogs, but they were already out (it was about 6:30).  

For entrees, I had the Lobster Roll and my husband had the Peanut Butter Crunch Burger.  The lobster roll was very good - a good portion of lobster mixed with creamed corn, popcorn for a little texture, on an oversized Parker Roll.  Not quite a knife and fork sandwich, but not something to eat while walking!  The only real criticism I have is that the roll gets a bit soggy by the time you get to the second half of the sandwich due to the creamed corn.  Nonetheless, the sandwich was great and still a value at $27 (compared to other strip offerings) .  The lobster was almost all cooked perfectly - a couple chewy pieces, but overall was great.  The website menu lists it as being made with jalapeño creamed corn, but I don't think that's the description on the menu we received in the restaurant.  (I didn't taste any jalapeño.)    My husband really enjoyed the Peanut Butter Crunch Burger.  He commented that he would have liked more potato chips on it, but that when he got a bite that had all of the components together, it was fantastic.

We didn't have enough room for dessert, but we'll surely be back again.  Our only wish is that there was a better bourbon and scotch list, but - to be fair - the name suggests that is not the focus.",qmIhP3cChH00fL7P4tZxYA,1,1,4,z8tWOxW5VfZne0UZ3OmTCw

The ambiance was great. It's casual, inviting, but very nice and classy. The atmosphere is very lively - a place you would go with a big group of friends.

I ordered 2 drinks from the bar - first was the Soda Popinski. It is their take on the Moscow Mule. This drink was amazing. I would actually go back just for this drink. It was light, refreshing and delicious. I think the second drink was called the Aviation (or something similar) and it was a gin cocktail with Creme de Violette and a maraschino cherry. This drink was also very good. Both drinks looked great and well presented.

The food overall was just above average. The presentation was fabulous on all food items but the flavor was not up to Michael Mina's highest standards. The nachos were eh... How can you mess up nachos? The deviled eggs were great though there were only three pieces and I ate 2 so the rest of the table was shit out of luck. The poke was pretty good. I felt like it could use more flavor and there were only 5 shrimp chips. It should definitely come with more! The crab cake was good. There was a lot of crab in there which is good but it wasn't anything spectacular!

For the entree I had the salmon done medium well. Again, this was just okay.  Lacking flavor a little. The wasabi mashed potatoes were good.

I mean, it was the usual...McDonalds, Chinese, pizza, burgers and hotdogs. Since we had 2 hours until the concert, we decided to try this place out. Best decision ever!!

At first, it looked like there was a wait. Luckily, a bunch of people were just looking at the menu and asking the hostess questions, so we were actually seated right away in a booth.

I don't even know who Michael Mina is, but he is a fricken GENIUS!! The meat was cooked perfectly, it was hot and juicy. The peanut butter and bacon jam made the burger awesome!

The Mac and cheese was pretty good too, not too salty or rich, and they cut the broccoli into small pieces.

We had every intention on ordering a few more items to share but after the nachos we were pretty full. The lobster corndogs came out and they were ok. My fella and mom didn't enjoy them at all so I ended up having to take the brunt of this dish. It was enjoyable, but pretty greasy.
Definitely better to share  most of these dishes. Most of the entrees that came out for neighboring tables were pretty sad looking. Tiny portions and the food didn't look or sound very exciting. The highlights from the menu really seemed to be the appetizers which were on the more creative side as well as the burgers that were a good portion size for the price. 

The piña colada was really the only good cocktail we tried and actually enjoyed, but with an extensive beer assortment, this is the preferable thing  to order here.

I won't go out of my way to try this place again, but it's a solid choice if you're in the area for a show or vacation.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,5,6,3,q2BAmr0Np4St7RHLid9ZMQ

I would move here for this burger!...a little pricey, but you definitely get what you pay for--the burger was HUGE! I wasn't able to finish the whole thing (as much as I would love to). I wish they offer a smaller portion. Overall awesome experience! Would definitely recommend!",ksZqPQF_2TBB_kDtkMitLA,0,0,4,IxhCWWZC8mVfWUoKk3thvg
5977670,2014-03-15,0,YnmtUJGqQIQL9tz1MRyfqA,Terrible.  The server left in the middle of our table ordering.  Half of us have food.  You'll get better service at McDonald's.  I'd give better service if I was working for free.   If you spend money here you are an @$$hole.,YDTatz0zewV9ca2kiKQB7w,0,0,1,899o1ZwlujsfPOrfkrchHw

Everything on the menu is amazing and hits the spot when the only thing that will curb our cravings is good bar food. The nachos are a must have when you stop in! Seriously, you're not doing yourself justice if you don't order these. The bacon burger is also mouthwatering!",Gb4iZKY--EPpQhfNcv4mKA,0,0,5,M8EchZ1qCPFLlbQ8RuoaVw

The fried pickles were pretty disappointing...especially compared to MN state fair frickles! They tasted more like corn dogs, and would probably be better if they were cut and then fired. The mac and cheese was SO SO good...I wish I could eat it everyday.",ERSO7iKqXxtpHSui2tl-iQ,0,0,4,r2InUyv8BZK2Bt4fRXxTnw
5986632,2013-10-14,0,YnmtUJGqQIQL9tz1MRyfqA,meh... the food was not as great as what the reviews rave about. perhaps because i ordered a steak taco salad and it tasted like they smoosh 1million taco shells into it.. meh! the salad dressing tasted like ass. ASS i tell you. and it was pretty pricey. meh!,vkS42EUbymmsuoMbT1h_Rg,0,0,1,U2dwByJ_EemSFWfNrwXsXw
5990506,2013-10-17,0,YnmtUJGqQIQL9tz1MRyfqA,"There was a 20 minute wait which really was 30 minutes when we were seated over half the restaurant was empty. The server was rude, the server assistant refilled my water, I said thank you and he ignored me. The server took our  drink order and after a while took a different tables drink order and they received their Bloody Mary as well as my husbands beer five minutes before I got a coke. Jean S. our server removed extra glasses off a table by sticking her fingers in the glass and then placed them on another table to be used by guests. So gross. This was a bad experience and mediocre food.",HySI_NhFZLi1_P44hGwDOg,1,0,1,jDTUG-4SNRO3OTWn4p16hQ
5995185,2017-03-26,3,YnmtUJGqQIQL9tz1MRyfqA,"First of all, this rating is based solely on the service. One would think, a party of 8...you would sure want to keep the drinks coming. Took more than 25 minutes for the first drinks to come, and they sat on the counter several minutes before they came. We told them we had an appointment and were assured there would be no problem. Again, times ticking...oh, your food is being plated. Again nothing.  Us girls had to leave or risk our hair appointment. Really? 90 minutes? So my nephew paid for our meals and had them boxed. Again, really???? Nachos and salads....boxed? They should have never charged him for that food at the very least. Very poor customer service.",MNMFWEH1byvWhF7t7HeMjw,0,0,1,bi48gn-4b2BPxht2hiIppQ
5995267,2017-05-04,0,YnmtUJGqQIQL9tz1MRyfqA,"I've been to this place a few times now which must say something (other than the fact that I go to Vegas too frequently). It's basically upscale pub food.  The setup is nice with a large bar area and many tvs.  The beer list is long and solid, for Vegas, but lacks some of the better IPAs...but again, I am currently spoiled when it comes to beer.  They also have very good cocktails.  The happy hour specials are excellent...I've tried the tater tots and the brisket sliders and both were very tasty.  The burgers are outstanding although I wasn't a huge fan of the ""must try"" PB Crunch burger.  It was a -happy I tried it but would never get it again- type deals. My friend got nachos which were very unique and tasty.  SO, as far as creative pub food goes in Vegas, this is a great option.",Q-wZgSosVo4x4arPKHtKeQ,0,0,4,x4gax4iCkkWzoMyqYD3xRg
