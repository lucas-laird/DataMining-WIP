I ordered seven things and all seven things came out wrong or completely burnt like a brick. I'm a nice person and they were treating me like they prepared my food like this on purpose. They didn't even apologize when I ask why they did this. The drive thru took me 30 minutes and it took me another 15 minutes to go back and get my refund. The manager was the one who took my order and she was by far the meanest and grumpiest person I've ever seen. Her only response was she was busy but there was only 5 people in the restaurant total. The people who work here are lack charisma, are spiteful and on top of that they do not clean the restaurant at all. After seeing how filthy the dining area is I can't even imagine what their kitchen must look like.",NfE1uHFWzzMyXkgBeEuR1A,0,0,1,917zcjTebHtvNPIohpPBDg

Viscous.  Raw.  Meat.  To make matters worse, they had actively scraped the cheese off of another sandwich that was supposed to have cheese (to what purpose, I have no idea--why add cheese then scrape it off?).  This is the topping on the dung cake of this awful facility.  The staff is immature, order times take forever, management is an incompetent joke, and the kids who work there have to be high.  It's the only way I can explain their behavior of doing things like sexually trying to come onto people, leaning out the window to try and touch your hair, or any of the other bizarre behaviors I've seen there.

And it's very close to the Vons grocery store. Just a perfect spot to grab something to eat quick and very cheap as usual.,dK3rqmt4lg99yRptTmueHA,0,0,5,Tbs7p3M_huZwYwT1eGVFJg

The manger was yelling at the poor cashier to go and get a milk for another customer, then turned and yelled at this same cashier to take my order. While I appreciate the attention to the customer, one needs to let an individual finish a task before even starting another. Or as a manager , you can go forth and fetch what is needed. I placed my order for three cheeseburgers, small fries, and a happy meal with fries and apple slices. 

After receiving my order and finding a table that was not very dirty we sat and ate. The cheeseburgers were fine. The fries were over cooked and tasted funny. The fries were almost over cooked Golden Brown. It seems like there grease needed to be changed. I ventured to use the restroom and the ladies room was a disaster zone or could of been declared one. It looked like it had not been cleaned properly in awhile. The white powder on the floor was the worst.",I-4KVZ9lqHhk8469X9FvhA,2,2,2,aVggcdjCxMON_NQcPFwXEg

I can't believe McDonald's is hiring people like this man. I use my Mcdonald's App for a buy one get one free Sandwich. The manager had no clue how to use the bar code. He then said the scanner did not work. He had so much trouble putting in the code manually. He gave up and just said its not a valid code. The McDonald's app will not dis play an offer unless it is valid by date and barcode for special offers.  After clicking the in store use, seeing the code, not using it, the app automatically registered the coupon as being used. This manager made me waste my coupon and would not validate or compensate me for his mistake. Stop hiring incompetent people Mcdonald's. The place was also dirty and badly maintained.",yW3xYtvPzCSCNDYcnT7TwA,0,0,1,TRudpcUqJtuHpFBTCQWYrw

I'm very aware that McDonalds is nothing special but, I didn't realize just how horrible my experience would be. So as I pulled up to the drive through the lady immediately told us to hold on, we didn't even get greeted. After we spent several minutes waiting for her to take our order she finally was ready. As we ordered, she failed to take down half of our order, which only consisted of a few items. We repeatedly had to say our order until she finally got it. Then after waiting for about ten min we got up to the first door to pay. The lady then proceeded to tell us our order and what do you know, IT WASN'T EVEN OUR ORDER! Then after we told her AGAIN our order she finally decided to input it into the system so we could pay. After paying, we waited about another 5 min before we then reached the second window for receiving our food. The first item we received was a soft served ice cream cone dipped in chocolate. Not only did the lady let the ice cream drip all over the cone before giving it to us but she also failed to let the dipped chocolate harden, which meant I basically was given a huge melted mess to the point where I had to throw the ice cream out because it wasn't even worth it. Then she gave us a large coke, or so we thought. My boyfriend tasted it and said it tasted horrible so he wanted a new one. The lady then told us that the coke machine was out of order so she had to give us Diet Coke instead. Um?!??? Aren't you supposed to at least let the customer know if you don't have an item on the menu before just deciding to give them a different option. So we asked for our money back which they gave us because frankly the other options weren't that great. The lady then said good bye and proceeded to close the door. We then had to tell her um hello?!? We have fries and a burrito as well! She then passed us our bag and we left. The burrito literally looked like it had been thrown together within 2 seconds and our fries we ordered were all over the bag and not even in the little cup that they are supposed to come in. Again I know I shouldn't expect much from a fast food place, let alone a McDonalds but really??? Never again is all I have to say.",Uc5IHHI8Ey4dM8zNfZBArQ,0,0,1,mHH4ikhQROfQV1vNAPndYg

This young, short, Mexican girl wouldn't give him one. He asked to speak to the manager and he waited. The manager never came out. He ordered two burgers, a pop, and two large fries, he wanted the box so his fries didn't get cold before he could eat them. He finally asked for his money back and she couldn't even give him his $10.68 back, she shorted him. Maybe they need to give him her job. I don't care who you are, in hospitality you need to treat everyone with respect. I will never come back to this McDonalds because they have no idea on how to treat their customers. You can never tell if a person is rich or poor by looking at them. I know several millionaires and you'd never know it by looking at them.

It was lunch time and my little sister wanted some chicken nuggets so mcdonalds is obviously the place to go. I ordered two of the 10 piece chicken nugget meals and the lady, with a very rude response might I add, said ""we have no nuggets."" Uhh, okay. In food service, you should at least say ""I'm sorry"" and say things in a polite manner. But anyway, I had to change up my order. When I was telling her my order, politely, she kept on getting whatever I was saying wrong. And then was still being really rude. I don't understand how a mcdonalds can have really bad service. It's worse than some of the places in Chinatown. 

Definitely won't be returning to this location. Sorry, not sorry!",wxQCLMnuVYbdtmQCc2ryZg,2,1,1,lG8-Opz7eeyMCCHjVJXQSw
