Basically, this is chipotle/subway of pizza. Great and fair prices. Quality ingredients. Daily specials. Friendly staff. Beer.

Great concept. This place really does things right! The white pizza was great, as well as the classic margherita pizza.

The downside I think for this place is the..... NAME. It's hard to associate ""custom built"" with pizza, especially if you are driving down the street and can't see the ""pizza"" part written very small. To me, this seems like a great name for a cabinet maker or something.

We love this place and hope it survives the rough Las Vegas restaurant market but it doesn't ever seem that busy and I think the name is what's hurting it.  

What helps this place? Word of mouth and Yelp reviews!",nS4mcwbdFynSchOqtDhWsA,2,2,5,Tu8F31A68RplGzO0Dc0GEQ

I picked up a couple pies last week at the suggestion of a friend.  The prices were reasonable at under $10 for a slightly larger than personal pan pie. The line staff were very friendly. The venue was small with only a few tables. I recommend this place for cheap eats for kids.  

I ordered two pies To-Go. When I got home (5 mins away) the pies were still warm, but they were clearly not properly cooked throughout the way a good pizza should be just out of the oven. The sauce tasted a bit raw like it had not been sautéed for the proper time. I had originally planned to order the gluten-free crust, but it came out of the freezer, so I changed my mind and ordered the wheat crust.  When the (wheat) crust pie I ordered came out of the oven, the cheese was not bubbly or even slightly browned.  In fact, the entire center was just warm - the ingredients were clearly not cooked together. 

I put the whole thing back into the oven to finish cooking, which helped blend the flavors and cook the cheese, but now the crust was overcooked.   

Interesting concept, but needs some work.

PS - If you check in on YELP before you place your order, you are rewarded with $1 off coupon.  Wish I had known in advance.  (Signage?)",aDPDPIFAkH0shPTosewT9w,0,0,2,agdg3nssSfTxn-1SgB2zMg

35596,2013-03-05,1,CeqWpwHBoaxwRcv5btnv6g,"Some friends and I went to Custom Built Pizza last Friday night after reading all of the promising reviews.  We were not disappointed!  Each of the pizzas starts at $8.95 with all of the toppings you can handle.  They charge $1 or $2 more for the honey wheat or gluten free doughs.  The ordering process can be daunting, but it is basically like ordering at Subway as you choose your options as you move down the line.  

I opted for traditional dough and after reading countless reviews on the diavola (spicy) sauce I had to try it.  I asked for it to be mixed with the crushed tomato sauce and the employees acknowledged that it was pretty darn hot on it's own.  After selecting my toppings, the pizza was thrown into the oven and out it came pretty quickly.  Now, my pizza turned out great, but I must say, you're building your own pizza so if you don't like the taste, it's probably your own fault.  Some of my friends went crazy with the toppings and ended up with something they didn't really like.  With that said, all of the pizzas were cooked to perfection so Custom built fulfilled on their end of the bargain.  

The only down side to this experience was watching the employees snack on pizza behind the counter and then go right back to making pizzas and serving the customers.  Everybody gets hungry but at least hide it a little better!  Overall, this restaurant has a very unique concept with good ingredients and decent pricing.

Tucked away in a shopping center across from Target, next time you are shopping stop in and order a pizza!!!

You pick your crust, sauce, cheeses, veggies and meats. Great variety of options, so yummy.
I ordered the diavolo (spicy tomato sauce, no joke), mozzarella, pepperoni, mushroom and jalapeno. So good. Couldn't finish it so ate leftovers the next day. The sauce was even better the next day.

My husband created his own BBQ chicken pizza, fantastic as well.

Great for kids as they can really get into creating their own pizza with all the toppings to choose from :) 

Staff super friendly and help with topping suggestions if you aren't sure what to get. Their specialty pizzas really good too.

We got our pizzas and while they weren't gross - they weren't any better than anyone else's.  If you eat pizza hut or little Caesars - this is a step above it, but that's all and costs more.

465087,2012-11-17,0,CeqWpwHBoaxwRcv5btnv6g,"Amazing pizza and concept.  I've been here about ten times now.  I've taken a few friends and it was not as memorable for them, and I think I know why: make your pizza something special.  If you just ask for mozzarella cheese, pepperoni, and classic tomato, it will be very good, with an amazing crust, but still basic.  They have a very extensive selection of toppings, including those that are harder to find for pizza, including garlic, arugula, sun-dried tomatoes, artichoke hearts, etc, not to mention various cheeses (I recommend a blend of mozzarella and asiago -staff suggested it on my first visit and I've loved it ever since!).  Go for something special, but try to limit the toppings to five or less, otherwise it can make the pizza more difficult to deal with (the cheese may not cook as well).

We tried the smores pizza for dessert today, and wow, it's amazing.  Just the right amount of sweet with an excellent presentation.

Glad a Belly card (a frequent card) while you are there; after ten visits, you will earn enough points for a free pizza!  That effectively lowers the already low price of $8.95 to about $8.10.

The positive reviews on Yelp led me to Custom Built Pizza. I was skeptical, but I loved the idea and just had to try it. You walk up and select your crust, sauce and toppings. You're not nickel and dimed for every topping either. And the options are endless and fresh. Overwhelmed by all the possibilities, I went with the classic 1889 Pizza Margherita. It was loaded up and baked for a few short minutes. I paid my tab and was digging in while it was still piping hot. This didn't compare to those in I had in Italy, but compared to those locally and in NY this was top notch. Who knew? Someone with this brilliant idea, apparently. 

My brother joined me on this visit. He had the spicy diavola mixed with the crushed tomato sauce the blend had a nice kick without overpowering the other ingredients. He went to town and chose a smorgasbord of meats and veggies. We shared slices and his creation was quite delicious and I was most impressed that the crust held the toppings. No grimaldi's pizza I've had has been able to do this, few NY styles have. Even those I had in Naples got soggy and limp. Avoid extra extra cheese and dine in to maintain the crisp sturdy crust.

1139162,2013-05-21,1,CeqWpwHBoaxwRcv5btnv6g,"Updated review since my last review was almost one year ago.

I have to give myself a little credit.  I usually hit the LVAC gym at Flamingo/215 at least 3 times/week.  IF i had no control, I would probably hit CBP at least once / week.  After all, burn a few calories, replenish them with pizza - makes sense to me !   But no, I've probably hit the place, at most, once a month.  Honestly, the main reason for the ""infrequency""  is there are tooooo many other places to try in the Valley.

I really dig the fact that you can pile on the toppings.  I really dig the fact that it only takes a few minutes for the pizza to be prepared/cooked/boxed.  I really dig the low prices ( under $8 given LVAC discount and sometimes lower given specials.)

I don't like that the crust does not hold up to the toppings ( then again, when you put a pound of meat on an 8"" inch pizza, you'll need to  add cement to the crust .)  I don't like that i rarely wait until i get home to eat the pizza.

Overall, I continue to be a fan.

Custom pizzas are approx 9"" and for $8.95 and you can choose unlimited toppings!!! They have an excellent selection of high quality fresh toppings. Some of my favorites FRESH mozzarella, roasted garlic, bacon, sliced meatballs, chorizo, caramelized onions, and fresh basil to name just a few!!! That's only about 1/3 of their vast selection. 

You start by choosing your dough original, wheat, or gluten free. FYI, they use double zero flour which is pretty much the best flour that $ can buy for thin crust pizzas. After you choose your dough it is hand stretched and shaped in front of you on a marble slab. You then choose from 4 different sauces (spicy diavolo is really good IMO). Then choose your cheese(s) from fresh mozz, asiago, gorgonzola, and parmesan. Now on to the bounty of toppings! The pizzas cook very fast in the 700 degree oven. You'll be biting into your custom built creation within a couple of minutes after paying. 

I really LOVE the high quality ingredients, large selection of toppings, but above all the CRUST!!! Their crust is a thin Neapolitan that is slightly charred and crispy on the bottom and chewy in the middle. Awesome! A bit more bite than a NY style crust, but still thin enough to really let the toppings do their thing. Anyone who's eaten at settebello or due forni (unless you chose the roman crust at d.forni) has had this kind of crust. I think their pizza is better than due forni by leaps and bounds (other than the originality of pizza toppings and flavors). Settebello is great in its own right, but I would give custom built just a slight edge.

Our pizza preppers were so friendly!

I love that the pizzas are ""individual size"", so we don't have to argue over what toppings to get.

I love that you can make your own pizza just how you like it and there are no hidden charges for each additional item you pick like most places. Their prices are set and the menu is simple, you get your dough and ask for what you want and how much of it you want. I loved it I would definitely go back!!

I walked in and was greeted with a smile and asked if it was my first time. When I said yes, the lady immediately offered me samples of the different sauces they have and made recommendations for mixing sauces together for flavor explosions! I was impressed! I tasted the sauces and ended up choosing a mix of tomato and a little diablo (spicy, I think that's what it was called?).  So, the set up is like ordering at subway. You pick what type of dough you want, and then sauce, and then cheese, and then toppings. The choice of toppings is unbelievable! So many meats and cheeses and veggies to chose from, and unlimited amounts and varieties for the same price? 

IS THIS REAL LIFE? 
PIZZA HEAVEN!

Did I mention the price is only like, $8-9? And the pizza is quite large (at least big enough for me to take half of it home!). I ended up choosing all of the cheeses, garlic, onion, pepperoni and jalapeno/artichoke on half of the pizza. As soon as you're done with toppings, your pizza gets placed in the brick oven. Literally, by the time I was finished picking out which beer I wanted and paying, my pizza was ready. 3 minutes, maybe?

And ranch - FREE RANCH. Awesome. 

Sat down, took my first bite, and fell in love. 

Okay, so this pizza isn't the most amazing delicious perfect heavenly pizza I have ever had, but it is VERY close. And you cannot beat the service, speed, and price!

So really had no idea kind of pizza thinking just keep it simple for the first time. The type of dough choose from honey wheat (one I had), whole wheat, even have gluten free dough, and believe one more not remember it. The sauces tomato sauce, diablo sauce (one I picked), white sauce, and two others ones. The cheeses I went with the combination of mozzarella and asiago but also have four other cheeses on the menu. The toppings have LOT too choose from I went with my standard favorite pepperoni and sausage with some fresh basil. It takes times for pizza come out depending on busy the restaurant. It so worth the wait! Too see them put together your own mona lisa of pie, perfectly cook, nice crust all around, and piping HOT. Personnel pizza for one should be about in life! 

I happy with the way my combinations came together. The diablo sauce had nice little kick too it. The combination of cheese gave it nice texture and depth of flavor every bite. The pepperoni and sausage was good. The pizza makers are really helpful if any questions on some combinations. He asked me if wanted half and half cheese but felt like going mixed both together be better. I am sure with all the combinations there something for everyone! LIterally go everyday have different pie. Cool. 

The inside not very big but still have ample choices of booth or tables too choose from. They do have one television just in case watch whatever they have on.

Everything looked clean but I'm giving this rating a 4 since there was cross contamination with the red sauce (marinara) which I really wanted.

I received an offer from Groupon and that was my introduction to Custom Built Pizza.

My husband and I went on a Tuesday afternoon. It was not too busy and we were able to order from the extremely personable Chef Moe and enjoy some conversation with him. He listened carefully and made our pizzas right in front of us.

I ordered a traditional crust with buffalo sauce, mozzarella cheese and Parmesan cheese topped with chicken. Moe covered the entire surface of my pizza with chicken! (see photo). My husband ordered a traditional crust with tomato sauce, mozzarella cheese and pepperoni.

Moe put our pizzas into the oven, which has an actual little fire inside in the corner (as opposed to a gas oven), and thanked us for coming in.

We moved down towards the register and selected drinks. There are bottled drinks and fountain drinks to choose from plus they have a liquor license with beer or wine.
We sat ourselves and watched Moe continue to make pizzas for other guests.

The dining area is spacious and very clean. The volume of the television was not too loud. It was easy to hold a conversation with the ambient sounds around us. 

When our pizzas were ready, Moe himself delivered them to our table. It took less than 10 minutes for these fresh, made to order pizzas to be delivered to us.

The first bite of my pizza will always be my favorite. The flavors from the buffalo sauce and chicken blended perfectly. The pizza crust was nice and thick with a good crunch when bitten into. Just delicious!

The pepperoni on my husband's pizza was thick cut and the tomato sauce was flavorful.

Neither pizza was greasy or soggy and they were a perfect size for a hungry adult. I was barely able to finish the whole thing but I didn't want to bring just one piece home. That would have been a tease.

The young lady from the cash register came over to check on us and asked if we needed anything.

We were very satisfied with our meal and will absolutely return in the future. There were dessert option pizzas but we were too full to try them on this visit.

I wish I had known about Custom Built Artisan Pizzas sooner but now that I have tried them, I will not forget them.

So when you choose to eat here your options are pretty simple. You can choose whatever house specialty pizza at different prices they have or you can choose your own unlimited toppings for 8.95. Mind you that they only have one size and I would say that it's a little bit smaller than a medium pizza hut pizza.

So here's your steps for your custom built pizza.

1. Choose your Dough. (Wheat, Gluten Free, or Traditional)
2. Choose your Sauce. (Crushed Tomato, Spicy Diavola, Creamy Alfredo, or Pistachio Pesto)
3. Choose your Cheese. (Mozzarella, Jack, Gorgonzola, or Asiago)
4. Choose your Meats. (too many to mention)
5. Choose your Veggies. (too many to mention)

When you hear of this place and find out you can put whatever toppings you want for 8.95 of course it sounds like a good bargain. So naturally I was thinking for the toppings why not EVERYTHING?

Here's where the problem lies. When I was there that day, I told the guy I wanted all the toppings on there. He said, you can do that BUT not all of it will get cooked properly and not only will it not look right, but most of the toppings will fall off when you take your first bite. 

Now I dont know if he said that so that he wouldnt lose money since you would have all the toppings he offers on there, so I ended up only going with about 8 toppings total on mine. I ordered another with just extra cheese and extra pepperoni because that's all my 8 year old likes to eat.

So overall, I was kind of disappointed. Dont get me wrong, everything tasted good but the fact that I can eat one pizza by myself, that can get expensive, especially with a family of 4.

Pick your size, pick your crust, pick your cheese/toppings/extras/whatever the hell you want on the pizza. I admit, there may be a few of the ""odd toppings"" missing from the counter, but for the most part you'll find a variety of toppings you want and like. The pesto sauce is awesome, and you can split the pizza in half, if you prefer different sauces/combinations. Plenty of vegetarian/vegan options (win!), and definitely the same if you're feeling carnivorous. Prepared and cooked to perfection right in front of you. Service is friendly, and I've never waited more than 10 minutes (for a single pizza).",m9y1phkwqdOmilZyuH8_wQ,3,1,5,FHfPXTgJCYJ4VsfLv7iaDA

Ya jerk much? I wanted a good pizza but the poor girl is just looking around like help me. So finally I'm guessing the manger came to help her out. Got a Cesar salad along with my pizza. Well the pizza is ok, the crust is just lacking some flavor, and the ricotta cheese was just bland. Also the salads must be pre made early in the day because the croutons were SOGGY!!!

They have a couple different doughs to choose from, including gluten free. The topping selection is pretty extensive and if you're not up for creating your own, they have a few pre-customized pizza options too.

The pizzas are a small 8"" size but can probably be shared depending on the amount of toppings you pick. My wife had a buffalo chicken and my son built a pepperoni, chicken and olive pizza. I also built my own with spicy diavola sauce, sausage, meatballs, onions and sun dried tomatoes topped with mozzarella strips. The flavors are awesome and they cook the pizzas almost perfectly. 

My only complaint was they were a tad stingy with the meats. I guess that's somewhat expected for the price. By the way, the price is great, most pizzas are just under $10 for unlimited toppings. They also run some good specials throughout the week. CBP is a solid pizza joint with good food, decent prices and the staff is friendly.

The location seems easy. NOT! I had to drive through the parking lots quite a few times before I found it. 
The place itself is cute and clean. They have SOOOOO many options to put on your pie. 
You choose the dough (regular, gluten free and wheat), the sauce (white, marinara, spicy and 2 others), and toppings. Oh, the toppings. They must have about 50 to choose from.
They've got sauteed onions, roasted garlic, pineapple, red onions, olives, fresh basil, peppers, and so many others. 
So, I made the most kick ass pizza ever! Regular crust, with some marinara mixed with the spicy sauce, gorgonzola cheese and sliced mozzarella, herbed ricotta cheese, parmesean cheese, sauteed onions, roasted garlic topped with pineapple and basil. It looked absolutely gorgeous!
SADLY, it just failed. The middle of the pizza was RUNNY and barely cooked. It just wasn't pretty at all. The taste was OK. The dough in the center of the pizza was terrible, but the crust and the upper part near the crust was outstanding. 
If you are reading this, owners of CBP, please, cook the pizza a little longer. My lackluster pizza would have been fantastic had that been done!

For the price you can get as many toppings as you want. I took it easy and just got the pesto sauce with chicken, mushrooms, and caramelized onions. After only waiting a few minutes it was brought out to our table. The crust had a decent char around the top and outside edges and the bottom was even crispier, making it easy to pick up a slice without it going limp and having the toppings slide off.

Other reviews have said they cut the pies into four slices, but they cut ours into eight. It's nice to see new business listen to feedback and make tweaks for the better.

in case you're not dreaming big enough, I'll give you two tips to make the best Custom Built: First, get the spicy sauce ... if it's too spicy for you, get half spicy (they'll mix it with the regular sauce). Second, have Mo put an egg on top. It's not on the menu, but as long as they have some in the fridge they'll put it on top and your life will never be the same again.

4014599,2013-12-17,0,CeqWpwHBoaxwRcv5btnv6g,"I love me some pizza, and Las Vegas has no shortage of pizza joints.  Everywhere you go here, you're not far away from some Italian pie.  Pizza Hut on the left...pizza!  Little Caesar's on the right...pizza, pizza!  Grimaldi's down the street...pizza, pizza, pizza!  CPK across the street along with Sammy's next to it...pizzzzaaaaa.  Yes, we in America are infatuated with anything on baked dough.  Other countries only dream about having so much bread around!  

When Custom Built Pizza came to be, I thought of it as a great concept.  It's like Subway, for pizza!  Build it how I want it!  My way!  Execution, ah, good but not great for me.

For us, Custom Built Pizza is a bit out of our way since we live darn near across town from where this place is in the SW.  We made the trek because I purchased a few Groupons back then for what basically was a buy one get one free deal.  Value for sure.  

Place is nice enough, room for small families, and can handle a nice lunch rush crowd.  We ended up going for dinner.  Each pizza averages about $9 each for an 8-inch personal pizza.  And each pizza can be loaded with any of the toppings that are available on the fixings line.  Wish I knew about their lunch special for $7, might have got more bang-for-the-buck on our Groupons.  Oh well.

Custom Built Pizza starts just like a Subway or Chipotle type factory line restaurant.  So don't go in and just sit down waiting for a menu!  It's not like a regular pizza joint.  You choose your dough - usually regular, whole wheat, or gluten-free.  You choose your sauce - marinara, alfredo, pesto, BBQ, or their spicy diavolo.  They you choose your toppings - there's lots available; pepperoni, chicken, sausage, ham, lots of veggie, and different cheeses.  Last I remember the toppings were very fresh, veggies looked fresh sliced and cut.  After that, it's off to the oven for a quick cook!  Seriously, your pizza will be done usually in under 10 minutes since they are of the thin crust style.  Which I happen to like very much.

Our family of four was on the table eating in less than 20 minutes.  The kids liked their pizzas, but who knows what they really tasted like because they threw almost half the list of ingredients on their pies!  Kids.  I thinks the entire process of building something of their own creation appealed to the Frankenstein in them.

I on the other hand wasn't totally convinced.  My pizza was pretty good, and the toppings were excellent.  What I wasn't fond of was the crust.  As we all know, a great pizza is built on a foundation of crust.  Bad crust = Bad pizza.  I won't go so far as saying the crust was bad, it just wasn't what I was expecting.  It was a bit bland.  I'm thinking a bit of salt would have helped?  The crust on my pizza just didn't have much taste.  And I wished it was a bit more done too, I like seeing the little black parts on the bottom of my crust.  Totally adds to the taste and texture.  Good pizza, but for what you pay it should be a tad more refined I think.  Nothing that can't be adjusted.

Another reason why I'm in the 3-star zone on Custom Built Pizza?  No Coca-Cola!  Pepsi!  Really, Coca-Cola just sounds better saying it in Italian!  But I understand with the soda wars now, getting a restaurant to choose a side comes down to what is a better deal.  

Friendly folks working, and couldn't be more accommodating.  I even asked for arugula to be placed on my pizza AFTER baking and was met with no resistance.  I'm sure this place is very popular for the lunch crowd, and for the gym-goers at the LVAC right across the way for a post-workout meal.  

I would go back if I was in the area, but not entirely sure if I would drive to Custom Built Pizza on a craving whim.  There's just so many other pizza joints near me!",QCtHk02W_Asu2LFfdmGQDA,2,0,3,hCTZ_gIsOx_GtEztj4SUUA

We accidentally stumbled onto CBP when we were going to a different place in the area.  My hubby was set on the other place but when we saw the big lunch special sign out front, we had to investigate.  I mean ANY PIZZA for $6.95 would get anyone's attention I think (this special is Monday-Friday 11am-3pm.)  When I went in to grab a menu to check out, I was sold on pizza for lunch just from the smell of the place!  There was no eating a boring sandwich after smelling the delicious pizzas baking in the oven.

I really liked the whole idea of this place as well.  It was like going to Subway where you walk down the line and point to the items you want on your pizza.  The choices are quite numerous and plentiful.  The toppings all looked super fresh and colorful.  There were several options for crusts, sauces, cheeses, veggies, and proteins.  There must be at least 1000 combos you can make, if not more.  They also have already designed pizzas, if the toppings are too overwhelming for you.  Since we were there for the lunch special time, we could actually get unlimited toppings, if we had chosen to do so.  Instead we went with a classic pepperoni pizza and a white pizza with extra mushrooms because everything is better with mushrooms!  Both were super tasty and had so much flavor.  The thin crust was crisp with a great crunch.  The cheese was ooey gooey and browned just perfectly.  The pepperoni was spicy and delish!

The best thing was our pizzas were prepared, cooked, and boxed up in 5 minutes flat.    That is some awesome pizza service right there.  We very much enjoyed the pizzas and had nothing left over afterwards because we are pizza piggies.  

I would give this place a solid 4 stars but the staff here totally pushes them to a 5 star rating.  Maurice was working the counter when I arrived.  He could tell I was new and slightly confused, especially since I was at the wrong end of the counter trying to order, so he took me under his wing and showed me the light.  He walked me through everything and was describing each step with the greatest of detail.  He spoke about the pizza as if it was his first born child!  His descriptions made you want the pizza right that second.   He totally made the experience amazing.  Both of our pizzas were works of art created by the one and only Maurice the Pizzaman!  Maurice alone makes CBP a 5 star joint!  Go Maurice!!!",8DBH3BpLINfTAK_Up5BtUQ,12,11,5,-6zbLCEa84DzabJbHU4hjA

It was a pizza kind of night and I was like I wanted to try Custom Built Pizza for some dinner....so we did and it was great!

Of course we had to get it to go as its easier that way so I wrote down what I wanted and off my husband went to pick it up.  It was a Saturday night and there was no line! They just took my post it note and made up my pizza (half Alfredo, half pesto with roasted chicken, Italian sausage, fresh mozzarella and artichokes!) 

My pizza was delicious although next time I might try to do Alfredo and pesto together and I want spinach on my pizza! I think it's a super cool concept and the fact that they don't charge you per topping rocks too! I do wish their crust was a lil thicker since I felt like my pizza toppings slid right off but it was still tasty.  My husband told me the pizza cooks really quickly which is good to know when they have a food rush. Definitely a huge bonus that they give LVAC members a discount!

I always ask for ranch and they give me a little side. The first time I went they were super sweet and patient with me, and this time also. I believe the owner was there, or some older gentleman but he made me feel awkward because I used a groupon then after I checked in I got a check in deal. Well this was after we began to eat so I decided to put it to use and purchased the smores pizza! He didnt know what I was talking about, but then honored it. Again I felt awkward. Anywho, we wrapped up our items and left.

The inside is very clean and nice, the employees are super kind and not little jerks! We tried a piece of the small (4 slices) smores pizza and were literally in high heaven. IT WAS ORGASMIC. SERIOUSLY! I would go to the gym 100 hrs just to eat one of these once a day! jk, but it was amazing!

It cooks the pizza perfectly at 900 degrees, as is required for VPN style pizza. The prices are excellent, and the casual pizza parlor type atmosphere is nice. You would normally pay nearly twice as much to get this kind of pizza in Las Vegas from the other VPN style pizza places. If you want great VPN pizza without breaking the bank, this is the only place you need to visit in LV. 

One must understand that this pizza is the opposite of commercial pizza. This pizza is exactly how it is made in Naples, Italy. It is a very simple and delicate flavor starting with the dough that takes 24 hours to rise naturally, without chemicals. The dough is very light and has a subtle natural flavor. They use Caputo flour from Italy. The tomato sauce is simply crushed tomatoes with a little bit of seasoning. The mozzarella is fresh and delicious. They have dozens of toppings, but I would recommend the plain margherita so you can savor the flavors of simple ingredients. Loading it up with toppings completely masks the essential ingredients; dough, tomato, cheese.  Pizza was never meant to be a casserole, so try to enjoy the pizza for what it was meant to be.

Lastly, you need to eat it hot out of the oven for the maximum enjoyment. I would not recommend this type of pizza for take out. It's very thin and cools very quickly.

We had a groupon which gave us $14 worth of food for $7, the only catch was we had to eat the pizza there.   They have several options for every part of your pie (crust, sauce, veg, meat, cheese).  I believe each pizza costs around $9 with cheaper options for cheese or 1 topping pizzas.  It would be a crime only getting one topping at this place.  You don't go to U-Swirl to get vanilla yogurt with a single cherry on top!  

I ordered the regular crust with Buffalo sauce, probably won't get this sauce again as it is really just a hot sauce, but it would make for a create topping.  Spicy Diavoli (sp) is a better option.  Then I loaded up on 4 different cheese options before adding mushrooms and every meat they had besides meatballs.  (chicken, pepperoni, sausage, bacon, etc...)  The pizza takes 5 minutes or so to cook in their ovens.  The young woman making my pizza was super friendly as was the gentlemen in charge of shipping the pies in and out of the oven.  The pizza is of good size and most mortals probably would be looking for a box half way through.  They also have beer/wine/non-alcoholic beverage options.  2 pizzas and drinks with the Groupoon came to just under $10....great deal.

The only slight suggestion for improvement that I would have is to somehow change their beverage area setup as to not have the door for behind the counter blocking the iced tea and lid section when open.  They also happened to be out of sun dried tomatoes on this particular visit.  Overall though a great place to pig out on a budget.",Cn-qcD1gZI7wW8hn748z0g,1,0,4,YRN30OmaEU8cWY1c5EM7DA

After talking no-likey pizza hubby into trying a new pizza place we ventured on over to custom built pizza!!!! Okay so the Grand Canyon shopping center is a maze. I hate it BUT this not a review for the horrible design of that place.

There were maybe 4 others patrons which I would usually be wary of! However yelp usually isn't THIS wrong so we went to order. I had a half white sauce half pistachio pesto pizza with the mozzarella strips, chicken, roasted garlic, bacon, and mushrooms. He tossed it into the wood burning oven and started on hubby's. he has the spicy diavola sauce, strips of mozzarella, tomatoes chicken, and bacon. Our pizzas had similar ingredients but were completely different!!! They brought our pizzas to the table for us and we dug in. My daughter ate a whole slice of the white sauce side of mine and she loved it. The pesto was yuuuuuuuummy! I like spicy and the diavola sauce creeped up on ya!! His pizza would have been bomb if he had thrown pineapple on that bi.....uh no cussing for me anymore!! The crust is crispy and soft all at the same time!

My friend Nicole B.'s birthday is Tuesday and she gets married next weekend, so I decided to chill with her while her husband-to-be had his bachelor party which included Eric R.'s presence.  NIcole B. wanted pizza - she was interested in trying something new.  I suggested Custom Built - she got the groupon and we walked around the North Premium Outlets for 3 hours in preparation for dinner!

When we arrived, there was no wait which was great because we were starving.  I ordered the regular crust, spicy diavola sauce and a few dabs of pistachio pesto, ricotta, buffalo and shredded mozzarella...and then here comes the veggies!  Fresh tomatoes, artichokes, jalapenos, caramelized onions, eggplant...then I added chicken.  They added a fried egg on top after cooking the pizza, then I asked for the toppings that are added after the pizza is cooked: fresh spinach, basil, green onions, cilantro, and sundried tomatoes.  It was truly a work of art.  It was cut into 8 slices this time rather than 4 like when I first got here.  Nicole B. ordered the honey wheat crust for hers and she really liked it.  I got a Mexican coke and we ordered the s'mores pizza.  Since it was Nicole's birthday, it was ""on the house""!  The staff here was SOOOOO nice!

When our pizzas came out hot and delicious, I was so excited.  Mine held up.  I do like the thicker crust because it allows for tons of toppings.  At Project Pie the crust was thinner and fewer toppings were recommended because the crust got wet while cooking.  This is not the case here.  We polished off our entire pizzas (no easy feat, seriously) and then chatted for awhile before asking the staff to fire up our dessert.  When it arrived, our mini pizza was delivered smelling amazing.  It was smeared with nutella and marshmallows that had a nice brown color on top.  It was heavenly.

Still fantastic pizza, still pretty nice service, although I'd like to see a bit more enthusiasm from the staff. They're still informative and cheerful, though, so it's not like there's a real issue with the service. And again, the pizza is still great as usual; you can't get a crust like this anywhere else besides Settebello, with that thin, but substantial, flaky, but toasted profile. 

And of course, the full power of pizza customization is still genius, and continues to impress the people I introduce to Custom-Built. They seem to be keeping the ingredients very fresh and quality, which is a huge part of the custom-style set-up. Remember that you can even mix cheeses and sauces; for example, I enjoy getting mozzarella with a sprinkle of parmesan, and others like mixing the mild tomato sauce with a bit of the spicy red sauce for a nice kick. You can even put toppings on just one side of a pizza, if you're sharing. And the size is substantial enough for sharing, too - while this is definitely not a family-size pizza, it's a bit larger than a personal pizza, and even anti-crust types might be convinced into eating the crust of this pizza, as good as it is, so this is a pizza that really fully satisfies.

I think the only downside, if I had to point one out, is that this kind of pizza does not leftover very well. It must be eaten hot, at the very least warm - once it hits room temperature the profile of the crust easily turns hard, and as non-greasy as the pizza is built, there's nothing for the ingredients to settle lazily in as the hours go by. I really have little issue with this though - this is good pizza, measured-out well, with me at the reins of the ingredients, so of course I never have issues eating exactly what I wanted.

Tasty ingredients all around, and the crust keeps a chewy consistency with a slight crunch.  

You want to ask me out for dinner?  How the heck are you gonna do that?  You can build me a pizza or something.  I am a fan and I will most definitely be back.",lsZlV02ZdqEzR-qILdT7Cw,25,16,4,mf6L-COGYSVNOvxf9avl_g

They're very generous on the toppings(you customize/load up each pizza with as many/as much toppings as you like). The only minor issue I experienced with my pizza was it got a little soggy after my first slice (maybe because of the extra sauce?). Next time, I'll just get regular sauce or a request it to be baked a little longer.",w-kN5hI24NLoKFPrrLX-Xw,1,0,4,m5BQ64TFLUPtAmslDtdN3g
4842598,2014-01-28,1,CeqWpwHBoaxwRcv5btnv6g,"Service was fast and friendly, restaurant was clean and toppings were fresh.

I tried the gluten free pizza crust with daiya cheese, house made meatballs, sausage, onions, and peppers. I was happy to have a gluten and dairy free option, it's great to see pizza joints offering this.

My pizza was a bit bland, even with all the toppings.

The gluten free crust is not bad, but it's no great either. I make better at home. It is thin, but they don't get it very crispy and it tastes like it needs some salt and a brushing of olive oil to give it some flavor. If they could season and pre-bake the crust to crisp it up it would be much better.

The meatballs and sausage were very greasy. After baking, oil from them was running all over my pizza.

Daiya cheese is awesome, but I wish they would put a bit more on there. Some parts of my pizza did not have any cheese at all.

They charge extra for both the GF crust and daiya cheese. All the other toppings are included in the standard pizza price. I'm not sure what the rationale is behind this. You can load up a standard pizza with all kinds of meats and veggies, but if you want daiya cheese and just one or two toppings, it will cost you extra.

The concept here is interesting, but I think it falls a bit short of the mark.",5rL-YgU3CXHbQA3Txzdd9g,5,2,3,KNCitp6r1bCdJ-jHphUiUg

I didn't get the guys name, but I know he's from Carolina.   He asked us if we had been here before.  We hadn't, so he explained how it all worked.  There are several different sauces!  I went for the spicy.  You can calm it down if you like, by having him mix it!  I didn't need that!  Then you get to choose your cheese! or several cheeses!  I did Mozzarella and another one.  Then they have the toppings!  I did a lot of toppings, they even have sun dried tomatoes and sauteed onions and a I think it was a fried eggplant!  I passed on the eggplant!

Food: 4
Value: 3 (used groupon but have to go with menu pricing)

Very cool concept, the groupon made it a great deal and the pizza was pretty good and done in no time at all. Definitely worth consideration if you are in a lunch time crunch and want some pizza.

Went at around 3pm and both girls behind the counter were friendly, informative and helpful, allowing you to taste a couple ingredients you may be unfamiliar with beforehand and offering suggestions such as mixing the diablo sauce with regular sauce to put out the fire...great tip!

I got one crazy pizza mixed with a ton of ingredients and one Margherita pizza to go. The sauce was good on the margherita but just not enough cheese...I know the cheese is the most expensive part of the pizza but if you are charging almost $9 menu price for a small margherita, I'd almost rather pay $12 and go to Settebello's for an insanely good margherita that's considerably larger...or with pizza hut and dominoes always at war with each other offering 50% discount online coupon codes you can get a dominoes artisan pizza for take out almost anytime for around $7...perhaps not quite as good, but more bang for your buck.

If I didn't have the groupon, I would say $20 is a bit steep for two small pizzas. 

The pizza industry is insanely competitive these days and just to be in the restaurant business in Las Vegas to begin with, you better have something magical.

If everyone is coming in with groupons and you have to give groupon 50% of the $7 they used to purchase it...just lower your price $1.50 and you'll have a lot of repeat business with an even better profit margin without having to rely on groupon.

TIP: Text 24587 on your phone while you are there and a coupon pops up on your phone for a free soda with your order (Man, I'm killing these guys).

I know I did some complaining on my 4 star review but the pizza was ""good"" and the service was great.

2 Pizzas and a soda for $12 ($7 groupon +$5 extra) was a great deal for a good lunch, I'm just not sure I'd come back and pay full price.",r52bugu98l77gdqTnIJ2oQ,1,0,4,5ABCpBqcWEVXIkNzw_-fdg

Toppings like Applewood Bacon, Roasted Chicken and Chorizo? Roasted Garlic, Arugula and Basil, Pineapple and sun dried tomatoes?!

You can do unlimited toppings for about $9! After you make your selections, it goes into a hot oven, and bakes for a few minutes. The aftermath is what you see in the pics...amazing pizza! I think we just found a new favorite pizza joint in town!

And they have specials every day here! Including half off wine and beer days! Our Thursday night included $2 Peroni and Birra Moretti's!

The people here are friendly and chill. They didn't intimidate noobs like me and I didn't feel rushed trying to figure out what I want on my pizza. They have a lot of options for toppings, crust and sauces. When I was finally done watching the guys making pizza, I was ready. We got a white pizza with bacon and a create-your-own pizza with pesto sauce. In a few minutes, our pizzas were ready!

Pesto Sauce Pizza:
The crust was crisp, light and not bland. Pesto sauce was great and just how I want pesto to be. For my toppings, I chose Italian sausage, pepperoni, mozzarella and mushrooms. 4/5

White Pizza:
Chicken, Alfredo sauce, ricotta, mozzarella, onion, garlic, oregano and fresh basil. We added bacon to this. This was just yummy. Creamy ricotta, freshness from the basil, tender chicken pieces and not-so-overpowering flavors from the onion and garlic. 4/5

Each pizza was less than $10 and could feed 1.5 people or 1 Cathy. Where you find your half a person is your own dilemma. We saved room for dessert.  I saw jars of Nutella so I had to have it. 

S'mores Pizza:
Dessert pizza with a thin crust, Nutella and marshmallows. I've had dessert pizza with Nutella from another pizza place but they skimped out on Nutella. Custom Built slathers a good layer of Nutella, tops it with lots of marshmallows then puts the crust back in the oven. When it comes out, you get hot toasted, melted ooey-gooey goodness from the marshmallows and that delightful taste of chocolate and hazelnut. 5/5",tH0uKD-vNwMoEc3Xk3Cbdg,9,7,4,Pa1eWCtvtq1lnZOIISUWUw

5800343,2013-04-11,2,CeqWpwHBoaxwRcv5btnv6g,"I have been to custom built 3 times now the first time was before my yelp days and I boosted all over facebook about it. I let all my friends and family know how awesome of a place it was as well as how awesome the customer service was. I think things have changed since then. 

Allow me to elaborate, the second time I went to custom built I quickly left the restaurant and choose not to dine there because I was turned off by this one employee today I went back and have found that the employees name is Larry. The time I walked out was because Larry was on the phone in the back and came out front to greet us. When he came out he was holding his cell phone in his hand and asked to wait a second as he finished his call, we didn't see this as a problem so we patiently waited. When Larry returned he had his cell phone in his hand and was hanging it up he placed the phone on a back counter came to the front and asked what type of dough we would like to choose. He quickly grabbed a regular ball of dough and was about to start kneeding it when I stopped him and apologized to him and told him loud and clear that I could not dine at his establishment since I did not see him wash his hands and we walked out. Bummed out by the incident I still did not want to simply stray away because of one employee so I told my wife we would give it some time and try again.

Well we did and we re-tried today. Like I said previously today the same employee that I walked out on was there and he was at the door. I take it that he did not remember the incident as he did not even recognize me. I thought that was great so that I could try and get a new experience and try and forget about the previous incident. I have to say the evening staff that first introduced my wife and I to custom built was exceptional they were up beat and seemed excited to just make a pizza. Today it felt like it was Monday and things were just crawling. If it was not for that one awesome employee that was genuinely happy to be at work I would have walked out once again that employee's name is MOE and the first thing that he did when he saw us and asked us the dough we wanted was go to the sink and wash his hands!! I quickly pointed it out to my wife and said look at that exceptional employee that is washing his hand prior to preparing our food. Moe quickly keeded out the dough and placed it on the order line to get prepared. Excited by a happy employee this made me happy and I quickly remembered the first time I went to custom built. I said to the gentlemen that was preparing my pizza the first time I came here the young man that assisted me suggested to try and get creative instead of having the same mundane pizza. He suggested trying multiple sauces and I remember him saying you can split this pizza into 16th's to try and give us a challenge we love challenges. When I mentioned this to the guy that was helping me today he seemed a little put off by the whole thing and even said I don't know why he would suggest trying so many different things. I ordered the pizza in 3rds so that I could try the different sauces 1 pesto 1 alfredo and 1 spicy. The guy seemed very uncertain on how to spread the sauces in thirds so he just made circles that ended up bleeding into each other in the cooking process. I layered and layered my pizza with topping after topping after topping. I always have fun in that part I feel like I'm a kid again when I get to pick and choose. 

My wife placed he order and I went to pay. When I was paying Larry was at the cash register and I told him that I forgot my belly card but had received the message that all custom built pizzas were 6.95 for the month of April. He said ok and then I showed him my yelp 10% off for checking in for the first time he again shook his head to which I thought was a clear sign for him acknowledging it. I paid the tab and was just handed my change. I thought that was a bit odd so I asked if I could have my receipt. Larry printed a receipt and gave it to me, I say a receipt because I was unsure if it was actually mine I paid with a $100.00 bill and did not nee that on the receipt and I also did not see a discount. I didn't want to be rude and be like YO! WHERE MY DISCOUNT SON!! so I just kept quite and said to myself the food will clearly change my mind and it will be worth every penny.

Well I got my pizza and it was totally not what I expected the sauces had all bleed into each other and I could not tell the difference from what was pesto what was spicy and where the alfredo started and ended. Also today I watched as Larry was at the cash register and then went to make a pizza for a guest with out washing his hands AGAIN!!!! SOME ONE NEEDS TO GO OVER SAFE FOOD HANDLING WITH LARRY BEFORE HE GETS SOMEONE SICK!!

Upon entering, we were greeted and instructed to file behind some other customers who had just placed their order. Assuming our place in this Subway'esq line, I eagerly watched a man begin forming a beautiful roll of pizza dough, into the flat palate ready to accept all the wonderful ingredients. As I was watching, I was paying close attention to his form as I've always wanted to hand toss a pizza in the air like you see in the movies. As I stared through the sneeze guard glass, i really focused on the mans hands kneading until I caught the terrible glimpse of his fingernails.

Custom build pizza is simply just that: a democratic pizza building operation where its you who makes the choices of whats on your pie! Yes, your vote counts here!!

The combinations are endless as there are 
3 crusts
4 sauces
4+ cheese's
20+ toppings 
I suck at math but the pizza combinations are nearly exponentially infinite! If you are hard up and really want to know how many different pizzas are possible us a permutation formula calculator. While you do that i will be eating them for you; all in the name of science.

Your creation takes about 8 minutes or so to cook (time varies on how busy of course) We lucked out and got our pizza's in about 8 min or less.

The pizza's has a nice crisp crust and were nice tasting. I wish I could tell you what we got on each pizza but I forgot. Just look at the pics and drool all over your keyboard or mobile phone. 

A word to the wise, the diablo sauce is supa hot! On the advice of the staff we mixed it with the traditional red sauce. 

I like the 3 creations that we concocted and am eager to make more!

Eat here with confidence!",E_Ts8j758tpiAZknHR7k4g,10,9,4,W0tOZfK7Yf5dsbr2BJIsPg

So after last night's post-For Goodness Shake visit, and the helpful Yelp reminder I will get this submission submitted.

Custom Built Pizza (CBP) is great.  They have fresh and quality ingredients that you can select from to engineer your very own pizza or pick from their menu of pizza combos.  If you get one with everything (all the sauces, cheeses, toppings on one pie = Suicide Pizza) it still costs the same as another pizza that you customize with just all the veggie toppings.  Awesome concept!  But don't go crazy, as the pizza might get more soggy when overloaded with too much sauces and toppings, plus some ingredients (bell peppers) will not cook properly or gets overcooked (the herbs).

My first personal sized CBP was a Suicide Pizza, the very first one ordered per the owner.  It was definitely a very hearty pizza.  But one with less stuff on it is actually better.

All meats + sweet onions, red onions, green onions and mushroom pizza with BBQ sauce was really good.  Of all the crazy combos pizza I have ever architect (doesn't it just sound more sophisticated instead of customize???), this was my favorite.

Regardless of how conservative or institutionally insane your pizza creation is, it still just requires a quick minute or two to be baked in their nice hot oven and delivered to your table for immediate consumption.   

CBP also offers dessert pizzas.  If you still have room to spare that is, which in my case has always been ""no"".

Quality ingredients, fast friendly service, even faster baking time, and 16,464+ combinations of pizzas = a lot of visits with a lot of friends, just so you can earn the coveted right to say you have tried every type of pizza offered at Custom Built Pizza.  Gotta eat 'em all!",RQlnSCjuqMnhR3Qk6j4KoA,11,9,5,4d5buJwaQeBXGbwnjK7jPQ

After a long day of shopping and running errands, my fella and I decided to get a bite to eat before heading home. Having spent a pretty penny on all purchases, we decided the best idea was to use on of the many Groupons I have pending. We arrived at Custom Built and were greeted warmly and instructed on the ordering process. 

My fella and I both got our own personal sized pizzas and proceeded to select our toppings of choice. They have some great sauces to choose from. The staff encouraged us to sample them before choosing. I tried the highly recommended spicy diavalo sauce and chose the pretty typical offerings of pepperoni, basil, mushrooms, olives, sun dried tomatoes and lots and lots of mozzarella cheese. I love the concept and the ingredients are really fresh and tasty. Their dough is handmade and you can taste it. I was surprised by how great my pizza turned out.  Since it was my first visit, I erred on the side of caution, but I look forward to my next visit where I plan on being a little more adventurous with my toppings and trying their whole wheat dough as well as one of their dessert pizzas.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,9,8,4,eb6czZOCFYw1q-NKq25BBA

I was hoping this place would be just as good as Pieology. It definitely wasn't... I would go back again, but definitely not routinely.",ZApCAOHduXde1ZFiY1QT3g,0,0,3,41NCHpKc1sOiNCqW1zYALQ
