1795562,2007-08-02,0,TSHrEyqHJbBbjmnwwmEN8w,"I came here once years ago and I remembered having the teppanyaki and my first taste of kobe beef.  MMMM delicious.  This time, my family and I bypassed the sushi bar and teppanyaki (to my disappointment) and instead we got a private room and we ordered a 5 course fixed meal.  Two of the dishes were raw, so I didn't consume it, but I asked for a substitute dish and they were pretty accomodating.  Well, only because my uncle knows a person at the hotel so we usually get taken care of when we go to Bellagio...We had some sort of roll, cooked, which the rice was soggy and stale, a lobster roll that I expected to be decent but it was bland and covered with some sort of citrusy sauce that really didn't go with the dish.  I don't recall the 3rd dish and the dish that followed was orange chicken.  Yes orange chicken.  How is that Japanese, I don't really know, but at least if it was good, it would have been forgiving, but it was lukewarm and not too tasty.  I was quite disappointed with the whole menu, until we got to the dessert, a lychee creme brulee.  I am a devotee to the OG creme brulee so I was alittle skeptical, but it turned out to be one of the best ones I've ever had...the lychee flavor was not overpowering at all, and there were even bits of lychee baked into the brulee.  MMMM....and at least I pushed to have them let me order a side of kobe beef from the Teppan. at least that was satisfying MMMMMM",bS61QwzLfsyGvNfDl4-Ebw,0,0,2,R6AP2-sFPVFJi4Lv7TYxRA
1882821,2007-07-10,0,TSHrEyqHJbBbjmnwwmEN8w,"For years now, I've avoided this teppanyaki joint b/c there were too many other hip sushi joints on the strip.  

This trip, we stayed at Bellagio, and Shintaro was the only restaurant that has yet to pass my lips.  

The bf scored the last reservation of the evening, 10pm, we were late and even witnessed a couple being denied entry.  Made me salivate even more for the food.  

Decor was a little Chinese, a little Japanese, a little carnival and a bit under the sea.  In conclusion, tacky and needing a revamp.  

Our server was a fiesty Chinese woman, who really worked to make the dining tailored to our needs.  We wanted to do the tasting menu, but last call is at 9:30pm, Tran was able to light a fire under the chef's behind to get us the tasting menu @ $85/pp.  

The wine pairings were well done and really corresponded well with the courses.

#1 Ahi Sashimi, four pieces in slightly spicy sauce & frissee.  Delicious.
#2 Crabcake w/wasabi mayo atop fragrant shitake mushrooms.
#3 Sliced beef with roots, tasty sauce, tender beef, but not very Asian.
#4 Spicy rock shrimp, generous portion, fantastic sauce & light batter.
#5 Sashimi & Nigiri, fresh and rice was done perfectly.  
#6 Lychee creme brulee the size of my head, pretty good, enjoyed the fresh fruits.

Japanese food is delicate in flavors and tastes JAPANESE.  The food is good, but just too Americanized for my palate.  Oh, and I hate smelling like food when the bill is high.",53bZ_EsXH71L7iFs5MP9_w,0,0,3,FAKHdS65meKCwXq2uTwT5w
2073304,2007-01-22,0,TSHrEyqHJbBbjmnwwmEN8w,"After booking this place 2hr. ahead (we booked at 7pm for our 9pm reservation), I came to Shintaro w/ a buddy of mine during our CES show  as we been told by family friend that 'the Japanese resturant in Bellagio' is really good. Well, it's good if it's on company's expense/if you're accompany your parents/someone is pickin' up the tab, cuz it can be a bit pricy.  My friend & I didn't feel like spend 30-40 some bucks for the sake wine list, so we just order some Japanese beer & order their special on the menu along w/ some tempura appetizer to share and still came to be about $70-80/per person, the rest of the menu are avg. about $20-$30 for the main course.  We didn't sit at the sushi bar at front/the teppanyaki side, but the people there seem to enjoy themselves.  But if you're coming to Shintaro, I'd recoomend to skip the sushi bar, the teppanyaki, just do the regular menu & sit by their seating where you get the fullview of the foutain right outside of Bellagio, the Paris cross st.  I guess, those altogether, if you have to spend in style, you might as well do-it-right, right?",bx6AcusVzV17KMX8i5J2XQ,0,0,4,LUwMMis8liFaSlDyXzxAGw
2230892,2007-05-16,0,TSHrEyqHJbBbjmnwwmEN8w,"This was another ""on the company"" dinner.  That being said, I have to say that it was excellent sushi.  I had the albacore and the yellowtail and both were melt in my mouth perfect.  Seriously.  I also had the popcorn shrimp with chili oil that was done very well.  My friend had the udon and she is a PICKY Asian food eater...she raved.  Said she'd go back in a heartbeat--which is quite a compliment.  Service was good.  

Now all that being said, it was expensive for what you get.  Of course, it IS Vegas so what do you expect?",8M6suLprYcMngrJjhYl_lw,1,0,4,3CVrvjIFI9huwXJqNXdDag

2835012,2006-09-08,0,TSHrEyqHJbBbjmnwwmEN8w,"Visited Shintaro 7/8/06 at 6pm. It was a weeknight.

Food: 4 stars
Decor: 5 stars nice, view of fountains, natural stone floors, marble teppan yaki tables and sushi bar with live jellyfish tanks.
Service: 5 stars They were attentive and removed plates properly.
Cost: 4 stars. pricey. a bowl of broth and 1 prawn was $17. 

Ordered:
Veggie Tempura$2/pr - well done and very tasty.
Lemongrass soup $17- broth with 1 prawn. the prawn was one of the best ive ever had but $17! jeez.
Sake Nigiri- creamy, tender. good but not excellent which was surprising.
Unagi Nigiri- not as good as kirala and it was served cold!




Pros: nice sushi bar
Cons: overpriced soup.
Overall: will return if i get the sushi craving and i cant wait until i get back to kirala.",QZLGsCANN9wSb5A_WAgLoQ,1,0,4,krAlpxaVQp3LdT4Yz_vApA
3203149,2006-04-02,0,TSHrEyqHJbBbjmnwwmEN8w,"Shintaro offers teppanyaki, sushi and contemporary  tasting menus in the dining room. The sushi bar actually faces a kaleidoscopic display of live jellyfish. 

I came here for the teppanyaki and it didn't disappoint.  
I recommend the ""land and sea"" pre fixe ($85/person) which includes salad, miso soup, mixed vegetables, prawns, lobster tail, white fish, filet mignon and fried rice. The portions are quite generous so be prepared to eat a lot.",5IX9FOesKrLRyz618xc6tw,2,0,4,cpKChIAvkmLkuPNYZSYYow
3965028,2006-10-06,0,TSHrEyqHJbBbjmnwwmEN8w,"Hmm, I have to go contrary to these other reviews.

The food is good, yes.  The sushi, in particular, is excellent.

BUT, the price is just absolutely insane for what you get.  There are just so many places with great food in vegas, that to charge close to $100/person for what you get is unreasonable.

When we were dining here, we saw at least 3 couples come in, sit down, look at the menu (and the high high prices), and leave.

Seriously, any dinner is going to seriously set you back, and while the food is good, it does not measure up to the price.

I suppose if money were no object, which this city tends to cater to, you could argue that the ambience and quality of food is top notch.  However, there are other places in Vegas, and indeed the Bellagio, that I would recommend over Shintaro.",h6YspRkEn_zb4dgGZTGNug,0,0,2,sbAORpVUEtgSocL91i5e-g

I just don't think it was so good that you get to charge $45/plate.  This is probably a place you visit once and then seek out something better or cheaper or both.",qtE59RKEer5zTr-i7mSGtA,0,0,4,09B-yflWTYhfmcyxv5AwNQ

The New York steak was tender and cooked medium rare just how I like it to perfection.  The Lobster tail was succulent and the bottle of Turnbull cab was the perfect meal topper.

The atmosphere is excellent, with colored jellyfish tanks behind the bar.  However, the sushi is merely good - not as good as some other top places.  Even more importantly, the sushi chefs are subdued, which may be proper for Bellagio but is not proper for a sushi bar.  Given the prices, not worth it.",qDi5XvihmkuTWLhaw3f3Fw,1,0,3,-lMpivO72YC1anyLxeD9Ew
