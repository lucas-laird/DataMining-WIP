1912437,2018-05-06,0,UeEzvTGkSyaHRvWTlZ1ISA,"Don't get discouraged by the location or the size of the restaurant. From what I have had, I can vouch that this is one of Thai restaurants in town with higher quality ingredients and more authentically flavored dishes. 

We had Tom Ka seafood soup, crab fried rice, sea bass with sweet chili sauce, chicken pad Thai to go and fried banana balls for dessert. 

Tom Ka soup, hands down the best I've had. It's so hearty and flavorful, unlike the watered down versions a lot of other Thai restaurants have. you can see how creamy it is by just looking at it. The shrimps were juicy and bouncy in the soup. It just begs you to have one bowl after another. 

Being Chinese, my parents are particularly picky about fried rice and especially the al dente-ness of the rice (can't be too hard, too soggy, or stuck together, etc. ) The crab fried rice definitely met their high expectation. The sea bass was grilled. It was a little bit overdone, but the sauce was great. 

The fried banana balls were more like fried coconut balls with a tad bit of banana in the center. Freshly fried, they were just too crunchy (never thought that I would be complaining about that). After a day in the fridge and microwave, they were much better. 

Last but not least, the service was quick and friendly for the dining in. However, The restaurant was very busy with to-go orders. We ordered our pad Thai to go before ordering dessert, but didn't get it until 30 min after we already finished dessert. The pad Thai was fantastic, one of the most flavorful ones I've had, but the long wait was just so unexpected. 

Overall, I would definitely go back, especially for that Tom Ka soup. If ordering to go, I would give it 40 minutes at least for the restaurant to prepare.",M2whdwvMtNxLllxOvt7cOw,1,0,4,Sxs8yDSyWZR56Dc82NS8AQ

Only waited about 12 minutes and it was ready.  Presentation was nice and looked really good. Sticky rice was exactly that, sticky rice. I've had better but it wasn't horrible. The salad was small but tasty. The egg roll was crispy and I really enjoyed the glass noodles inside. It was a pleasant surprise. The pad Thai had 5 large shrimp which isn't bad for a lunch size portion. The flavor profile didn't quite have enough of the peanut flavor in my opinion but was satisfying. However, I would think that a level 3 out of 10, my lips and mouth should not be burning afterward and they are. Overall a fairly neutral experience. I have had better and it was a little higher priced than I would have liked, but it was definitely better than the peanut butter jelly sandwich I was contemplating eating.",G7Ca2lgiFKKpv1v8glT4KQ,0,0,3,JpMaC6NnsBgR_K20C7iSGA

I remembered this place used to be another Thai restaurant a while back. I was super excited when I saw the sign ""Amazing Thai 2"". 

Location: This Thai joint is located next to 808 sushi and AT&T store, in the same plaza with the Vons at Rhodes Ranch. It is a multi- stores plaza with huge parking lot, so finding a parking should not be a problem. 

Decor: Apparently, Amazing Thai did a great make over of this small cute place and made their own style. I loved what they did to this place, it was modern, looked brighter and chic. 

Service was a two thumbs up. The server greeted us with smile when we walked in. Filled my hot tea and the kid's drinks. Service was fast, efficient, and attentive. 

We were able to tried couple of their favorites: 

Appetizer : 
Crab rangoon: it was standard, nothing too special about it but we liked it. Two thumbs up on food presentation of this appetizer. And my kids loved the sauce. 

Entrees: 
- Pad Woon Sen with Chicken: this pan fried glass noodle with egg, veggies and mushroom was my kid's all time favorite. Their portion was generous and had extra noodles. The glass noodles was perfectly cooked and it was tasty. 
- Crab fried rice: another my kid's favorite dish. It was delicious with generous size of crab meat. 
- Khao Soi with beef: This was a Northern Thai specialized dish and not many Thai restaurant offered it. In Thai, they would used hand cut noodles (all hand made), and you could add your own choices of protein.  It was so fresh and delicious! Back to Amazing Thai 2, I was not fond of the beef texture, it was not tender and a little too dried. I also wished they used a different kind of noodle, a more flat egg noodle to maintain its texture after soaked together with the soup . I did LOVE the coconut curry soup based! It was on the sweeter side, but since I requested spicy level number 5, it was a perfect sweet spicy combination at the end. Overall, I thought Amazing Thai 2 did well on this dish.

Desert: We had mango sticky rice and it was an average. Not a fan of the mango choices (used a different kind, not the sweet Thai mango). The sticky rice was not cooked thoroughly, some was way undercooked. I did like the coconut sauce and had to give extra credits on presentation. It was cute and neat. 

I will definitely come back and try their other favorite dishes and unique deserts (hint: their pot ice cream).",XU-JR0vGW1_O5GmNwZ0bfQ,5,6,4,FVyN_jIuyByBr6QxBBFKGw

Clean the slip covers on the chairs - they are too stained.   Would have rated the restaurant three stars but it was just not clean enough.  

Rice was not fresh - part of it was crusty and hard, so don't keep scraping the sides of the rice cooker to the bottom. The other part was overcooked and soggy, mushy.  Rice and noodles are so important to Thai food - at least have beautiful fresh rice.  

Service was good but waiter forgot to place the order for one of our dishes.  (Jerky, beef jerky not the waiter jerky).  Eggplant dish was somewhat bland - we did not want it too spicy, but there was no spice and the chunks of eggplant were huge - quite ugly.  

Cucumber salad was good - fresh, crispy, but a bit too sweet for me - could have used some lime.

When I stepped in, I felt like I was under dressed and they may not have lunch specials cuz it looked small and the décor was a bit fancy more than a casual looking setting.

This is their second location and they already had one opened on north side.

I decided to see if they had lunch specials at fair prices. I got a panang curry with chicken with spicy 5. I almost ordered an 8 but I remember that panang usually is spicier at a lot of places so I just asked for the spicy stuff on the side. So the 5, really was a 5. I think I should've ordered that 8 but I didn't want to be dying in class so good choice for me I suppose. 

It was really delicious and plenty of chicken in it. usually the chicken lacks at places. The lunch portion was a perfect portion for me. we get a salad and an egg roll. usually the portion is too much but I ate everything and didn't feel that food coma!

I also had a Thai tea. I believe 3 bucks for a Thai tea is a bit steep but I enjoyed it still. I'll give it another try and actually dine in next time.

3440289,2018-05-25,0,UeEzvTGkSyaHRvWTlZ1ISA,"Ordered for pick up, a piece of advice I'd love to give this place is to allow customers to select levels of heat on yelp and other ordering apps. I had to call to ask what their spice level was it's 1-10. They use traditional Thai heat which is VERY spicy.
I ordered:
Tom yum with chicken level 7
Massaman curry with tofu level 6

I can handle A LOT of heat so the level 7 wasn't quite hot enough for me, but he Tom yum was DELICIOUS.
This place WOULD have received 5 stars if it wasn't for the tofu.
I was given silken tofu which I have never seen in a curry, usually it's firm and cooked.
I took the tofu out because it was not good.

So, don't order the tofu and you're good!
The flavors were great other than that and I will definitely order from here again.
Especially for the Tom Yum!!",WZojlBpeuNhNew_EjB7GLA,0,0,4,yb0pJCU-4ZUFY5ndQ4dPJA

They do have a spice level from 1 to 10 and you can add more later if you feel daring. Drunken noodle is yumms.  The tom kar soup with chicken, eggplant dish with chicken, oh can't forget the takoyaki is on fire! So delicious",DsVnd4PH2nkbxo8UeGW3Mw,0,0,5,TkadoxNSjIgOJ9Ui5DIjlg
