This particular visit It was a to go order , food for the husband and me. I got to the cashier I paid . I got my receipt i didn't look at it, my fault. Once I got home i thought to myself it seemed a little bit more expensive than usual. I noticed my veggie mix was charged as an entree which is more expensive. I decided to give them a call , i explained to the lady i was charged wrong and she decided to argue and say the veggie mix was not a side!!  All i wanted was an okay bring your receipt next time and we can take care of it but no. So at this point i am like really?? I don't live too far so i went back ask to speak to the manager and showed him my receipt. He noticed i was in fact charged wrong, he end it up giving me my money back for my food. Which he didn't have to , i didn't care if he just gave me the difference .

I do not eat meat, so when I order from panda I simply ask for some white rice and chow mein. EVERY time I order they try to get me to choose some meat to go along with it after I tell them right away that those two things are all I want. Usually this doesn't bother me but the fact that it happens 1-2 times each visit by different employees is really getting annoying. Other than that they seem to handle the rush's okay. 
Food is usually good although sometimes you can tell things have been sitting out way too long and shouldn't be served. I've gotten hard rice on a few occasions. Oh well.",XMV1L5NNButqMCxmWCFOkg,0,0,3,JUB_elAlzIBaEjd16W8XjQ

Food: It's all cookie cutter style food prep- that being said, this location even managed to mess this up. I love love love pot stickers!, I buy them at any Asian joint I go to, make them at home.. I have DREAMS of gyoza dipping itself in fresh ponzu sauce and feeding itself to me, because I love them so much! (well, maybe not that far, but almost.) However, this is the first time I have eaten what equates to a Gag Rubber Gyoza.. =( It was sadness for the tummy. I couldn't even pawn off the rubbery ""treats"" to my German Shepard. She just sniffed it and gave me the stink eye like I was trying to poison her with them. 

Customer Service:  I have said this before and I will stand by it every time; I don't expect 5 star service from a fast food joint. I understand these are minimum wage employees who more than likely die a little inside every time the put their uniform on in the morning.  I get that this job will not be the one they fondly remember as ""the good ole days"". That being said, don't make me feel that way too please! I don't want to feel like the life is being sucked out of me because of the Eeyore atmosphere. 

Price: WOW, I remember when it was actually cheap to eat here. For 2 people, with 2 item combos, and portions smaller than they used to be, it came to more than $18! I could have gone to one of those mom and pop Chinese shops, got the lunch special with soup, egg roll, and bigger entree portions for less. And the food didnt even taste fresh. It definitely was NOT worth the cost and lack of atmosphere.",wPvp7ok3vK43HRE4Y930LA,0,0,2,liWzi7CnWQO_LxgMiyCoBQ

I thought I was going to like this place. It is located in a nice area, near a shopping center that has SEVERAL other stores. 

When we came in about 4pm there was a long line. I enjoy long lines. Why? In my head I am thinking ""yay, fresh food!!"" My boyfriend was the one actually groaning at the fact it was busy. But, it moved fast. 

Too fast. 

I felt like I was rushed when ordering. I don't come to Panda Xpress often so I was hoping I could look at my choices. Unfortunately, for me, the guy was writing down my food choices to pass along to the other employee so I didn't want to hold up the line. pluuuuusss, the customers in front of me where hogging up the food window. Like, ""excuse me, miss. Scoot your touch please?"" 

That's another thing. PEOPLE THAT WERE HERE ARE FRIGGING BLEH. They either stare, stand in your way or there are obnoxious children screaming while parents don't care. I know it's not panda's fault, it's probably just the area.. I don't know. 

Anyway, I ordered chow mien and black pepper chicken. The noodles were greasy but the b.p.c was on point! We ordered a side of orange chicken and it was delish. Sweet n fluffy, the way I like it. 

Since it was packed just watch out for your receipt. The girl at the register charged us for a plate when it should have been a bowl. Too fast, like I said.",-jL7hLAAwOnCAWKQlL9Wew,1,0,3,1b7T-y3HEv_5hZw_iY6AeQ

For fast food under $7.00 and you get extras because there is so much to eat, this is your place! Its in a nice location and very clean as well as friendly staff! My sister and I always come to Panda when we want something good and cheap.. 

Orange chicken is very yummy and their fried rice is really good too. Although I'm a huge fan of their chow mein and vegie eggrolls..they are to die for! :)",aerhroIPH1a-2fzwH0TLKg,0,0,3,xg4zyxj0pPTI4rKxXX8U-w

foyer isn't large enough for a line that forms and one can't see the entree's from the vantage
point. My one issue on this visit was I ordered the Shanghai Angus beef dish which has a
$1.25 premium and the server gave me a smaller than usual portion and even worse fewer
bites of savory 'steak' than vegetables and mushrooms. Disappointing. Other than that I
really love the food and the flavors!",Og5QfmXmMeQUcQIk-w94FQ,0,0,4,9m_clAAGdvD_BAvIZExKWw

Very clean and organized even when the line can get pretty long. I like how once you get to the front counter, employees are greeting you and getting you on your way. I've never have had a major problem while visiting here and the food quality is good! I recommend this location out of other nearby Panda's.",kSOkDKEdCzDjOVFaqOcTKQ,0,0,5,PsZbM-bNGJHufNZNT2SALA
