The best food is from their secret menu which you have to look up online. The best burger is ""animal style"" and I asked for free extra special sauce. If you're hungry, order the double double, but a single will satisfy an average appetite. With the extras, the burger is is great.

Instead of the regular fries, order the animal fries. They are covered with grilled onions, melted cheddar, and special sauce. Animal fries are excellent, but regular fries are nothing special.

Service was very good at peak time. The inside was packed and the drive thru line was backed up at least a dozen cars. Despite the crowd, we were able to place our order promptly. And our food came out after a short but expected wait. The staff was very efficient and friendly.

Overall, one of the best fast food places in town.",jXGO-W5XY_lFj0qH_JhyRQ,0,0,3,FkUrBjc5NZMs6Mk6bpX0rg

Since I had no breakfast I went about 11:30am and of course there was a line starting to form already. I ordered a double double (greedy) with grilled onions and a lemonade. Sat in line for a little bit (not long) but when I made it to the first window the heffa was really rude to me. Before I could even get my card & receipt back the heffa slammed the window on me. Not that I needed anything but she was RUDE!!! Never said hello, thank you, or anything. I usually give these people a little break cuz I know we all have bad days but to customers who help you stay employed is totally unacceptable!!! Put your happy face on and suck it up you have a job to do. 

When I pulled up to the 2nd window the young lady was very nice, personable, pleasant, and didn't necessarily rush me off & slam the window on me. But that didn't make up for the heffa being rude to me initially. 

Now onto the food.....My double double was amazing as expected and just outstanding. My fries were a bit soggy but they were hot, fresh, and good. My lemonade was perfect also not watered down & I could actually taste it. Probably will go back in the future but the young lady working the first window definitely needed an attitude adjustment!!!

We all have bad days but the people you're servicing should NEVER EVER know that. When I have bad days you better believe our patients, doctors, and nurses will never know it. And the others never know unless I tell them or can sense it cuz they're around me everyday. I hate hate hate receiving bad service or feel like somebody is being rude or short with me. I treat you like I want to be treated so I would like the same done to me!!!!!

2827987,2014-07-01,2,tgXiIcCoKYfg-hm8yLxenQ,"I hardly ever go to fast food places to order food, yet alone a burger. But In N Out can make a pretty good burger. So if you're cravin a burger.. fast, In N Out is the way to go.

It has been a long time since I've had In N Out and the burgers are still the same. At this location, things are on the slower side. The drive thru line gets pretty packed.They created a lane for the drive thru using cones and chains. So once you're in that line... theres no way out! And it ALWAYS smells like sewer outside. It just kills my vibe!

I usually get a #2. Cheeseburger no onions, animal style fries no onions. But last visit I decided to be crazy and keep the onions on the fries. Bad idea! My fries tasted like sh**. I have started to acquire the taste for onions but In N Out grilled onions are disgusting! I will stick to ""No onions please"". 

They have a secret menu. Part of that is animal style fries. They also have protein burgers, grilled cheese, and some other fun secretive items that I can't remember. My friend once told me they had a item called ""Road Kill"" and she ordered it in California and it is basically Animal Style fries with chopped up burger patty on top.

We got home, like 8min away, and the burgers were still warm, and the fries... well, they were gone by the time we got home. LOL. They were good. Fresh and tasteful. Better than McD's.

I bite into it, and holy cow... literally... god bless that cow that gave it's life to be on that soft bun. Juicy, beefy, and cooked just right.

My regular order is a 4x4 animal style, protein style, easy sauce burger with fries well-done and a large lemonade. 4x4 (aka 4 by 4) takes its base burger format from the double double, e.g. meat, cheese, meat, cheese; the result of ordering a burger ends up being meat, cheese, meat, cheese, meat, cheese, meat, cheese. Animal style burgers are made fresh daily with mustard grilled into the meat. Protein style means no bun, wrap the burger in one big leaf of lettuce. Ordering this back in the 70s and earlier was a big secret. Now, not so much. But the quality is always good and they don't miss a beat taste or presentation. Well done fries means the fries are made crispier, almost potato chip crunchy on the outside. Great change up on the regular order of fries.

Everyone is courteous. The food comes out quickly and well presented. The only real drawback is that there are better burgers in town filled with burger competition.

What's my bottom line? Give them your money and eat their food. The price is right for what they have and it is a drive-thru, fast food joint giving you quality for your buck. My actual rating is a solid 4.1 stars...",azBg2Tl2ncITAXKdX07tGQ,0,0,4,IsX54rg1YbhIrec4NdEIOA

The place is always packed and during lunch and dinner hours, there's always like 12 cars lined up in the drive thru. They have to send a person out to the line, which now reaches the parking lot, to take orders, but they make one thing in 3 variations, but each order will at least have the bun, a burger patty, and the lettuce and tomato. Why aren't they just throwing a bunch of pattys on the fryer and setting up at least a one patty burger during that time?

   I don't understand why I can go to a Chinese restaurant, order three different dishes, out of a menu of about 50 or so different items, and get all of that faster than it would to get a burger in a place that sells one thing in three variations. Screw people and they're ""Animal Style"" or the idiots that want to do a 10 by 10. Now they're just playing with food. Eat your damn burger and be happy. 




   In conclusion, my cravings for In N Out have never been powerful enough to want to wait for 20 minutes in a crowded, noisy, kids running everywhere place where the line at the drive thru is so long that if you put your car in reverse, you'll be in the drive thru line for KFC. Just don't go there during the lunch rush. Especially if you're on lunch because you won't make it back in time. Even if you worked at that In N Out, you won't make it back in time from lunch.

3920249,2014-03-20,5,tgXiIcCoKYfg-hm8yLxenQ,"As a born-and-bred native of the East Coast, I have never, up to this point, had food from an In-n-Out restaurant.  We just don't have them here, never heard of them - unless it's from my West Coast friends, who have all raved for YEARS about the wonder that is supposed to be this food.  So my husband and I are going to Vegas for a week, and I tell him, ""Before I do anything else, I want to go to In-n-Out.  I want to find out what a freaking Double-Double Animal Style is.  And the shakes.  I want to know what's the big deal here.  Take me there."" 

My husband just laughs at me.  He's from Vegas.  He knows what it's about.  But he humors me anyway.  Love that man.

We pull in.  I run excitedly for the door.  I'm about to taste this burger that everyone's been raving about.  This is IT!  I order the Double-Double Animal Style.  The fries.  The shake.  This is going to blow thousands of calories - but it's worth it, they said!

I sit at the impeccably clean table.  I unwrap.  Oh, it looks good.  I pick up my burger, take that bite, and.....

I was completely UNDERWHELMED.  What the hell is THIS?

Don't get me wrong.  The burger was good.  It tasted just fine.  But....where is the manna from heaven I was expecting?  Why does this just taste.... like a fast food burger, albeit a little better than Mickey D's or Burger King?  And the shake tasted NO better than either of the aforementioned places.  Matter of fact, I'd go so far as to say that Jack in the Box (another place we don't have on the East Coast) makes a much better shake.

Now, I'm well aware that this review will be considered utter BLASPHEMY to In-n-Out fanatics.  That's fine.  I liked it - but the buildup is NOT warranted.  

The restaurant was sparkling clean, which is a definite plus, and the service was good, so there's that.

Good.  But nothing more than that.",aB867JHc0gxKujKuLeIxNQ,2,2,3,UTz3dLBOOT0SCIbsn1_q4A

I really won't go out of my way to eat at an In-N-Out.  I don't have to.  Regardless where I'm at in Las Vegas, there's an In-N-Out within 5 miles.  But I did go out of my way to hit up this location. Why?  Well, this is the only In-N-Out in Las Vegas that I have yet to eat at until now.  In-N-Out Nellis/Charleston is no joke.  Just driving to the location is an adventure. If you're familiar with the area, then you know that a lot goes down in this area at night.  A lot of activity even happens during the day.  There's also a lot of construction and traffic on the way here.  So, don't expect a quick and painless trip to this In-N-Out. 

Like most of the locations out here, this one is busy. The drive-thru line is long and it's packed inside.  I kept my meal really simple.  I got two Flying Dutchman's and two cups of water.  A Flying Dutchman is two patties and two slices of cheese.  A Dutchman doesn't a bun, lettuce, or tomatoes. This is Keto all the way with high protein and crazy high fat.  I eat this meal a lot and wasn't too impressed with what I got. Both Dutchman's were smaller than normal and on the dry side.  This has never happened to me at an In-N-Out.  Oh well, I only came here because I haven't been here before.  I'm still a fan.  I'm just not a huge fan of this location. By the way, this In-N-Out has a great view of French Mountain and Sunrise Mountain.  Bookmark Checked!!!",y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQ,7,6,3,eP5j8eG3PoIa5GFfufYDJQ

4142613,2013-08-13,4,tgXiIcCoKYfg-hm8yLxenQ,"This was the very first In-N-Out burger I ever visited.  It was 1992 and I was 12 and new to the West Coast.   We waited in line for over an hour to get that first cheeseburger and fell in love on the spot! This day changed my burger life forever more.

Now to the present...I don't really visit this location often since I no longer live in this part of town.  When I do visit, I am usually pleased with my experience.  The food is consistent with the other In-N-Out locations, the service is the best, and the staff is unbelievably happy.  And yeah, the foo is totally delectable!

I do wish the parking situation was better at this location.  It is always really crowded and it is hard to find a spot.  The parking lot is also usually dirty with trash scattered everywhere.  This probably isn't In-N-Out's fault and more so the shopping center where it is located, but it is still a bit of an eye-sore.  Other locations I visit seem to always have someone out there picking up the parking lot, but I have never seen anyone doing that at this location.  

Also, I am really not comfortable leaving my car in the parking lot at night.  This neighborhood has just gone down a bit and there seems to be some shady looking people hanging out in the parking lot after dark.  If I am here after dark, I do the drive thru and head out of there ASAP.  

These last things are the only reasons why this location doesn't get 5 stars from me because I am still in awe of the work of art that is an In-N-Out cheeseburger.  Yum!",8DBH3BpLINfTAK_Up5BtUQ,5,5,4,aYhySmYzwb8wxivks9UXJw

I was amazed at how busy this restaurant was. Matter of factly this whole shopping center is a bees nest of activity. I was concerned that I wouldn't make it back to work in the allotted time. It took 15 minutes to get my order mind you there were probably around 40+ people eating, waiting or contemplating placing an order. 

When I got back to work my area, I opened the bag to find a well prepared burger just as I ordered it. The fries were hot and salted well. I wish I would of taken the employees offer of catsup for my fries as it would of made my meal perfect.

4451456,2012-10-21,0,tgXiIcCoKYfg-hm8yLxenQ,"Honestly what is not to love about In-N-Out Burger? They have tasty, well prepped burgers and french fries. Service is 99.9% of the time great - most likely because this burger chain actually pays their employees decent wages and from what I have heard from friends who have worked there - the chain actually does have a good rapport with their employees.

Any In-N-Out I have been to is squeaky clean and employees are consistently cleaning the tables and floors - not just this specific one. At this one in particular I have noticed the drive-thru can start to get a little out of hand, but usually they will send out an extra person to start taking orders.

Why I love In-N-Out over most burger chains - their burgers have a crispness to them, the lettuce is not soggy, the tomatoes are fresh, you can get your onions grilled. The french fries are cut fresh (you can see them doing it). The shakes are very good. 

The menu is simple. Yet... we all know of the ""secrets"" behind what you can order at In-N-Out. I applaud them for not layering bacon and BBQ sauce and all kinds of other crap onto their burgers like so many other chains do. 

In-N-Out knows what they're doing and I appreciate that.

1. GREAT service..always friendly and is that not a rarity these days especially fast food???

2. so inexpensive for some really tasty food.

3. hooked on animal style...the sautéed onions...the pickles..the sauce...what's not to love???

4. the milk shakes are super good and don't taste ""fake"" like all the other fast food chains where I won't even get a shake.

5. the fries are real french fries...not frozen things thrown into the fryer...some sit down restaurants don't have fries this good.

6. this location (the only one I've been to) is kept super clean.

7. and the most important reason...to me at least...is the fresh brewed iced tea...super good and makes the whole meal even better. 

Well, until this chain stretches to the east coast, I will just have to love from afar...absence really does make the heart grow fonder and I would really like to have a number 2 animal style right about now....",tZXFo0wtbCDP-Gt09Ar9_w,2,1,5,I9_FSav_2Dg3QYiesV3BLQ
