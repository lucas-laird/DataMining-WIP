I picked the avocado chicken bowl.  My wife's burrito was ho hum to say the least.  The beans and corn made up almost all of the burrito, there were two small thin slices of avocado, about a tablespoon of chopped chicken, no shredded cheese, and if I had not ordered extra pico  there would have been none.  My bowl was 1/3 rice, 1/3 cabbage, 1/6 beans and again about a tablespoon of chopped chicken and a little sour cream and pico.  Once again if I had not ordered extra condiments and sauces it would have been very bland and disappointing.  As it was with the extra sauce and pico it was palatable, but not what we are used to from this establishment.  Don't know why this is going on but they need to live up to the products they display.",QevYjxVahffbvVM53g9a0w,0,0,2,aydMJHbhi0eIhcZtNSc4VQ

This location is right next to Home Depot making it a convenient stop when I have to hot The 'Pot and I'm in a hunger pinch. It's a clean establishment. I tried the chicken avocado quesadilla thing. It was actually rather tasty. Better tasting than anticipated although a little on the salty side. I added their avocado salsa and that was tasty too. The drive through is pretty fast and the attendant was at least pleasant to deal w/. 

They only get 3 stars b/c they're typical fast food but they have good chicken. I can't see giving a fast food joint more than 3 stars due to its lack of originality.",3ZCS3niZj8GjbZY6Dx7uqw,0,1,3,l_MABKNbmpVtYnq8zj8upg

But when I proceeded to order a 3 piece thigh they said I couldn't have that cuz they didn't have enough. Will never go there again. But ur a chicken place?!

5425772,2016-09-24,0,SNc3-bV7preAPifzE4asNA,"so I went tonight to get a 8piece family meal of dark meat 2sides tortillas,salad and chorro's for dessert. for only $20, cant beat the price. The only problem I have had is the service. the one gal made the chicken,and sides, put it on the take out counter for over 5minutes and was NOT WEARING gloves,,,also while I was waiting on the chorros I had them remake my chicken hot and fresh, she has attitude behind it.than the cashier guy takes over puts all my stuff in the bag,and ask where is my salad so I told him to place my order under the heat lamps. he did. I got the salad,and my bag and went home. came home,and looked like slimmy spit all over the salad!!! the pico cilantro,and onion salsa bar was nasty, looked slimmy. the girl said it was probably just water, since when do they water down pico sauce? !!! I will be calling corporate,and the health department!!!!",anwmW5m3Q_ZvDK50-RMGbw,0,0,2,o3zbW8EPXHrQvFILI9HKeA
