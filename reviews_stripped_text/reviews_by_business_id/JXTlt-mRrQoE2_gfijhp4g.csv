The kimchi pancake reminded me of my mom's. But that is all gone. Service was slow. One both visits we came in at 11pm. On the second visit, we just up and left before we ordered drinks. Provide a better menu and service and maybe I can give a better rating. I give this place 0.5 stars out of 5. The first time around was good and that was during their soft opening.

I'm Korean so I like my soups, there was literally 1 choice, tofu seafood soup, so that was my order by default.  So here comes my second negative, I ask the waitress for the soup to be mild & she said there was no choice for spice level, most other Korean places can accommodate the spice level but not here.  Third negative was the portion size was way too small, even for lunch.  My tofu soup came in a 3 inch round crock, it was so dang small for $10.99.  And the 3 measly banchan (side dishes) they served were literally pea sized amounts.  The soup tasted so so, but definitely not something I would order again.  I was so disappointed after having read so many 5 star reviews on yelp as this place was closer to 1 maybe 2 stars.

1192862,2017-03-16,0,JXTlt-mRrQoE2_gfijhp4g,"We actually found this little place on Groupon and after some cross-referencing, we discovered they had a soft opening special... free beer and fries! We asked if we could use the Groupon and still take advantage of the free beer and fries special, and they said yes. Score!

We each got a pint of possibly-draft Asahi and a small basket of fries with some non-spicy mayo concoction while we looked at the menu. Menu seemed to be made up of a variety of street food and fusion items. Staff were super friendly although you could tell they were still learning. They were very attentive and refilled our banchan as we were running low. The interior was modern and there were K-pop videos playing on multiple TVs except one, which was playing some crime drama.

Unfortunately they were out of chicken gizzards but all the other food we got was delicious and definitely satisfied our hunger. The Kimchi Jjigae had a good amount of spice and plenty of substance. It was much more filling than it looked! In hindsight, it was probably not a good idea to have it with the beer though, but who can say no to free beer!? The cold tofu was colorful and tasty, but it seemed like a small-ish portion for the price. The Korean Style Omelette was simple yet the flavours were all there. So much deliciousness packed into it!

As we were heading out, they offered us some complimentary ice cream, which had some great flavors to choose from. We ended up picking chocolate coconut and lychee. Will definitely return to try their other dishes!",ihtr8PzUNeNMAihO02vyBw,0,0,4,T1quLY5HbOmlcdJ94YnvlQ

The interior was clean, comfortable, trendy tables, TVs playing Kpop/US News/etc, and overall a step up from some Korean sit down resturaunts I've been to.

Best part was hands down the food, things on the menu might seem limited and pricey but in all actuality it's worth the price paid. The miso beef with pickled onions were a nice sweet contrast to the spicy squid, while the deep fried chicken with spicy mayo and sweet chili were a whole new taste!

We were immediately greeted, seated, and asked what we wanted to drink. The restaurant is pretty nice on the inside. Perfect to take a date. There are TVs all over the place, some with sports on and others playing different K-pop music videos. I love it when a restaurant plays authentic music from their country. The menu was small but had great choices. Each dish came with a biwl of rice, soup, and at least 5 different types of kimchi. The chopsticks were silver, the glasses were metal- very posh. The Cucumber kimchi was our favorite. I ordered the Spicy Tacos which were 3 fist-sized tacos on flour tortillas with carne asada in a spicy sauce. It was pretty good! My husband ordered the Spicy Bulgogi. He felt that it was just way too saucy and that the portion was very small. But he didn't dislike it, I think he just expected something else and he is used to getting big portions. 

When we were there, they kicked off their first night of Karaoke! They have very thick song books, a huge monitor where the words were displayed, and 2 microphones. It was actually a lot of fun!!! I think the owners were there bc even after we paid and stayed to participate in Karaoke, we were offered free desert (shaved ice by Aloha Company), were offered free beer, and even offered us Sake. It was just a really cool environment that actually caused people in the restaurant to interact. We were strangers until Karaoke happened, then it seemed like everyone in the restaurant became friends! 

I definitely would go back and try other dishes. Plus, would go back for Karaoke!

The food took sooo long to come out (40mins.) and there was just 4 tables.  I don't mind waiting for good food to come out in this case it's just NOT good.  ONLY 3 side dishes given during lunch hrs. 

I ordered LA Galbi (2pcs) was so damn chewy, my mouth was hurting after eating the beef.  The flavor wasn't bad though. The beef bulgogi was just alright and the worst was the seafood tofu soup,  so bland(even I make it better at home)

The food was great. Authentic and nice spicyness. Bonchon was a little different with edamame and potatoes, but it still also had the usual radish and kimchi.

Add in some rare apple soju and I had a great time. The rice cakes were superb and the spicy beef was also a hit. Customer service was exceptional and they were always refilling our glass or bringing us more soju to keep the good times going. 

I really hope this place stays open so that there's good Korean in Summerlin and you don't have to go to Spring Valley or China Town for the goods.

4001765,2017-03-02,1,JXTlt-mRrQoE2_gfijhp4g,"For several years, I traveled to Korea regularly for business.  During those visits, I got to know both the people and the food fairly well.  The people are gracious and welcoming, and the food is remarkable to say the least. It is fresh, healthy, and full of wonderful flavors and textures.  There is no other cuisine quite like it anywhere in the world. 

Once my travel came to an end, I quickly discovered that quality Korean fare is very difficult to find in the US.  Over the last few years, I have eaten at Korean establishments from D.C. to San Diego, and have yet to find a place that sent me back to the busy streets of Seoul.  That is, until last night when I chanced upon Gangnam Street.  

Gangnam, if you are not aware, is much more than a trendy song from a guy that dances funny.  It is an upscale area in the center of Seoul full of shopping, dining, and a big chunk of the South Korean entertainment industry.  Like the rest of Seoul, it is a bustling high energy area full of people.  I worked and stayed in this area many times, so when I saw Gangnam Street tucked in modestly next to Fuddruckers my interest immediately peaked. 

Over my years of traveling, I have learned that the best food in the world generally does not come from big, fancy, overpriced restaurants.  To the contrary, I have found that some of my most memorable meals came from small, out of the way, establishments where the owner is both the waiter and the cook.  Their menus are were not full of dishes created by consultants, but rather recipes that were handed down through generations of their family.  They are not so much making you a meal as they are offering you a part of their life. The minute I walked into Gangnam Street, I could tell that it was one of these places.

The restaurant is small, but well appointed and very clean.  You can tell they take great pride in their establishment. The owner came out to talk to me when I came in, and happily gave me a sample of some of the best kimchi I have had anywhere.  My theory is that when you walk into an Italian eatery for the first time, you order spaghetti and meatballs.   If you don't like it, you will not like anything else they have to offer.  I have found this theory works with almost any type of fare, so the minute I tasted the owner's homemade kimchi, I knew that the food at this little joint was going to be great!   For the record I ordered the Dynamite Chicken, Kimche Pancakes, Chap Jae (Korean noodles), and bulgogi nachos.  In addition to my order, the owner supplied me with a healthy portion of their delicious kimchi and nice selection of banchan (Korean side dishes).

The kimchi pancake was tender with crispy edges and was accompanied by a delicious sauce that had just enough spice to give it a lovely kick.  The noodles were fresh and accompanied with a lovely selection of mushrooms, vegatables, beef, and peppers. The Dynamite Chicken was crispy, perfectly cooked, and came with a nice spicy mayo and sweet pepper sauce. The nachos were fun and tasty as well.   Overall the quality of Gangnam's food is outstanding, and the perfectly crafted flavors instantly took me back to the alleys and side streets of Samcheongdong and Insadong.  I am already looking forward to my next visit.  

So here is my advice.  If, like me, you love small owner operated joints that put out great food, you owe yourself a trip to Gangnam Street.  Whether you are a Korean food connoisseur, or have never tried the stuff, you have my assurance that Gangnam will not disappoint. And while you are there, spend some time talking to the owner. I guarantee you will leave happily full and feeling like you have made a new friend.",dZlInsG0HbDd0Di9W7Ml1A,5,2,5,UquIW11NMObq_9xS1wvQFA

The katsu was great but I wasn't a fan of the curry. It needed more flavor. We also ordered Chap Jae. You can't go wrong with that. It was tasty and portions were plenty. 
The mini veggie appetizers they give you in the beginning of your meal had a lot of flavor compared to other Korean restaurants in town. I def enjoyed that. They also served a side of soup and rice with your entrees which I thought was nice. The broth was delicious.

If it were not for the sauce I could not have finished the katsu. My kid who is normally an eating machine never got out of first gear.
I think the star of the show would have to be the the TVs with the Kpop music! If you want good Korean food, save your $$ and drive to Spring Mountain area.

The third item Chap Jao or something was pretty tasty! The bulgogi in it was delicious, couldn't eat the chew fish cake in it...really wish I knew about that ingredient but it was easy to go around.

The male server was great and so was the lady working, she was not a server and not the owner so idk what role she plays but she was such a sweet lady, we loved her!

The decor is super cute, modern, and clean. The service was attentive and great. We were seated quickly. And our drink orders were taken care of asap. 

We ordered the Bulgogi Bibimbap and Bulgogi Burger. Both were very very delicious. Good portions too. 

The cook, I'm assuming, came out and checked to see how we liked everything and we thought that was very nice. Going above and beyond. He even engaged in small talk and gave us two desserts on the house. 

The only reason why I didn't give five stars, is because I thought the price for a regular Coke of $3 was kind of expensive just for a Coke, and the Bulgogi Burger bread was getting a little hard the longer it sat there on my plate. So I ate it pretty quick to avoid that. Lol.

We came in on a Saturday afternoon. Place wasn't even that busy. The staff didn't even greet us or sit us down on any of the 5 unclean tables that where empty. They didn't even bother cleaning up after the customers left until I asked them nicely. 
Then we where waiting about 20 minutes for the staff to take our order and then I lost patience and asked them to help us with our order. The Korean lady nodded and then nothing for another 10 minutes! They didn't bring out banchan (Korean side dishes) until after I asked them more than half way finished with the lunch. 
I looked around and other customers where fed up and leaving without even ordering. This is a joke. 
To owner of this place: read this and hire additional trained staff, the two older women working don't even know how to ring up the register correctly. 
The only reason we didn't leave sooner after the terrible service was because we purchased a Groupon and had no choice but to use it. Fortunately the food was decent.

This place is just a few blocks away from my house so I decided to give it a shot. The decor and environment here is very average and looks the same as any other place. 

I ordered bugagi naturally and my food was actually pretty good. They don't cook it in front of you like most authentic Korean BBQ places but that's okay. 

It took almost 30 minutes after my meal was brought out for them to bring out my fiances noodles. The owners who happened to be sitting beside us went to the kitchen and asked them to speed things up. Her food was brought shortly after. They gave us beer and desert for free for the inconvenience. I have nothing bad to say about the owners as they were very nice and friendly. 

My biggest issue with this place was the price. My fiance and I like to dine out on the weekends and have been to a lot of places. I don't think the quality of food or environment justifies the price here. You are looking at around $20-25 per plate. For those prices, you can go to an authentic Korean restaurant with a more traditional Korean environment and have much better food and better service.

The sides were amazing! Kimchi, fish, soup so good! We got the kalbi (which was one of the best we've had) and the spicy pork belly, also very good! 

The staff was super friendly. We will definitely be back!",ZpVkd0ZI5iEq3C9ndawuZw,0,0,5,5QGd2dwTXKAHFfs05PCfwQ

The chef even came out to see if everything was to our satisfaction, which was a pleasant surprise.

We also ordered the regular fried rice for my 1 year old, but this really lacked flavor.  The miso ribeye has a savory flavor with the miso and is paired well with the onions/citrus garnish.  The meat is also very tender.  The chicken was fried to a crispy perfection and of course sriracha mayo sauce tastes good on everything.  There was only one server for the whole restaurant, which makes sense if your not busy.  However, with six tables occupied, service was a little lacking. Also, the server's English was not very good.  Later on I realized he was not trying to sell us soup, but wanted to know if we wanted the soup that came with the meal.  Also, I asked for a cup of hot water and he said it was not available.  I had to kindly suggest if he can just microwave some hot water for me.....For people with younger kids, they do not have high chairs.  We did use a Groupon on our first visit and the waiter kind of laughed when the bill came back and it was less than $10 afterwards.  We tipped generously on the full amount of the bill, but maybe advise your servers not to laugh at the use of Groupons.  The point of a Groupon is to bring people in and try your food....  We came and we enjoyed the food, so we will definitely be back since there are not too many good Korean options in the area.  But Gangnam step up your service!",Tdv7HZa4Hyjm-X0MtNmeag,2,2,4,6m6gHqOEFKZgys5EQV0vFw
5523084,2017-05-17,0,JXTlt-mRrQoE2_gfijhp4g,"Found on Groupon and was nicely surprised on how tasty the entrees and all the sides were. Enjoyed the marinated ribs and ribeye. So yummy. Entrees served with 5 sides of  daikon, octopus, marinated white fish, kimchi and delightful marinated finely sliced potatoes. Also served with sticky white rice, crispy white fish, delicious miso or tofu soups and a small salad. So much food but the entrees were the best. Service excellent by Edward. It wasn't busy at 7:00 but it started to fill up around 8:00. The dinner also comes with choice of sorbets which were very sweet. We didn't have room to do anything more then to just taste. I wasn't excited about the sorbets. I will definitely be going back!",4e5DRj0dO_3mCwzqv5_aEw,0,0,4,vwN_FXrqTwTsdvyzmnhV3w

My friend and I were seated and he served just waited next to us waiting for us to order haha so we had to tell her a few times to give us a minute since it was our first time here. The prices are $$ but the food was mediocre in my opinion. We got the chicken wings and they were so sticky and ""molasses-y"" that it was unenjoyable, we constantly had to pick out the gooey Wong dressing/skin from our teeth and it was just sweet and didn't really have the depth of flavor that you typically see with Korean style BBQ wings. We also got the pork with kimchi and tofu which took the longest to prepare, which is fine, but it wasn't what I was expecting when you typically think of Korean style Pork (usually square slices of pork belly) and sautéed kimchi (should be more smoky and caramelized), with tofu on the side. We also got spicy squid stir fry which was probably the best thing we ordered, the squid was cooked well and OT over/under cooked and it was (a good) spicy! Veggies were crisp and had good texture in the dish. I probably won't drive out of my way to come here again and stick to my ""go-to"", Soyo.",q8rjyleuk_jimFj9SoAm4g,0,0,3,yvZHHsypMGw1q33FAA72gg

I love the beef kalbi. So tender and flavorful. Also their noodle menu is something you don't find anywhere. We will definitely be back.,hlz8zpExssJfG9LUfq43yg,0,0,5,zKPKUdGXTKBRzw3x3lDJqA

Galbi & Bulgogi is my favorite. They serve on hot plate and it always gives ""impressive taste of finish""! A meal here never disappoints.",87OYhWPXiLHDgP9pcP3aPA,0,0,5,zy93NEWHcIe08eLnlK8JJg

I ordered the bulgogi tacos which came as three small tacos with the bulgogi and coleslaw. The taste was delicious but as someone with no spice tolerance, the coleslaw about killed me it had such a kick to it! The other people at the table agreed it was spicy but weren't complaining. Thankfully the waiter saw my struggle and gave me a complimentary Hawaiian frost, which saved that day. The other dishes we order were the tonkatsu which was good, but nothing special, and the cold noodle which wasn't as good. After dinner we used the yelp check in to get a round of Hawaiian frost. 

Overall the meal was only alright but the service rounded the review to 4 stars.",O-nFhs8UBvWaCkgkOTynDw,1,1,4,mzYQnoxgNf4P2_7sQJnJHg

We shared the fried dumpling appetizers -- generous serving and delicious.  Loved the little dishes (seaweed, fish cake, and squid) that came out before the meal.  My bibimbap was very good and my partner's pork belly and vegetables was even better.  The food was NOT too sweet -- something I hate in many Korean restaurants.
