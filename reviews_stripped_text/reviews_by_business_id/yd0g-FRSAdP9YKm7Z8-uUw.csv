Here's the quickies: 
The chicken parm pizza is absolutely phenomenal, in fact I'm drooling as I type this. All of the pizzas are really good. 

It's a Chicago bar, and if you like baseball it's a Sox bar, sorry Cubbies. 

The bar tenders are pretty hot. 

The owner, Joe, is a pretty nice guy. 

It's one of the few places in town with a shuffleboard.

Nobody seats you. this of course is not the dealbreaker. After an experience with a female bartender I came across (didnt ask her name white/spanish w black/ brown hair), i will never step foot again in the restaurant because of terrible service and rude staff. the bartender i was dealing with had messed up a previous order that I placed a few hours before. (She charged the wrong credit card with someone else) When I placed my second order she realized that she messed up previously. she tried to be smooth and charge me for the previous order she had messed up on. After I agreed to pay for the previous meal she messed up on, I had asked to speak with front desk, manager, or anybody who was in charge (in order to make sure I wont be double charged) before I took out my credit card. her response was ""it has nothing to do with them"". Which only makes me believe that she wanted to cover up her mistake so her employers wont find out.  After she refused to get a manager or contact front desk, her comment was "" I wont argue with you, we will charge u regardless of who you talk too"" in a rude tone. I left upset and walked out with no food from la piazza. After this whole experience, I will not eat here again simply due to disorganization, awful customer service, carelessness and rude staff. Whereas this could have been a simple problem to fix if she just called over her manager when asked.  GOOD FOOD DOES NOT EQUALIZE RUDE CUSTOMER SERVICE.  food was okay, nothing to brag about. I will now go out of my way to find another restaurant before I concider eating here. This bartender who was working the night of 9/19 should be reevaluated for her unprofessional performance. Blaming customers for staff mistakes is unacceptable. The one question that I really cant figure out is, how can you possibly charge a customers meal to someone elses credit card? Of course this bartender made sure that her manager would not answer this to me.  This just goes to show how much these employees value their job",8EX43x_drg6oAn2mMFYasA,0,0,1,WmrpHLU1nZEnf7JhhUSkvA

Located out of the strips, very nice place to eat. The manager/waiter is very nice (and that's one of the best quality of this job). Make sure that he's gonna do all his possible to make you spend a good time and will make you feel comfortable and happy! The food is really good too! I only tried the pizza but I bet that the rest of the menu is also that good!

So two stars for the theme and excellent portrayal.  If I were a local I would frequent this bar.  I ordered a philly cheese steak and my girlfriend had the lasagna.  The guy who took my order was cool as hell.  (Bald guy, Jeffrey I think).  My sandwich was ok.  My girlfriends lasagna was either a mistake or some ones culinary misfire.  The meat sauce very odd.  To me it tasted like a chili con carne.  Just beanless chili.  Pack full of noodles.  Not your traditional Italian lasagna.  She was so disappointed she wanted to take it back.  I talked her out of that I personally felt that it wasn't a kitchen mistake and more of a recipe failure.

The pizza is thick, crispy and swimming in a deliciously spicy red sauce.
The rest of the food is good, but the main draw here is the pizza for sure.

I talked to the staff last time I was visiting and they claimed that the original chef kept the recipe a secret and took it with him when he left.  I honestly couldn't tell the difference.  It was just as amazing as I remember.

My fiancee and I both had their seafood alfredo, and it was excellent.  It combined clams, crab and shrimp and was a good value considering the amount of seafood on the plate.  The serving also came with a salad or soup, and while my salad was lacking, my fiancee's beef vegatable soup was delicious.  It was fresh made there, with generous portions of beef roast and stewed vegetables.
There was a full bar inside the restaurant too, with video poker and several big screen TV's.

Mike Piazza's hall of fame issues aside, I hit up La Piazza after catching the Mets play the Cubs at Cashman Field. Reluctant to walk into a Chicago bar in my David Wright jersey, I was invited by some friendly Met fans I met at the game. La Piazza consists of a standard bar area complete with gambling machines and a dining area. The place appears to be adjoined to a hotel, which is great if you find yourself a little too sauced to drive home after spending time at the bar.

We grabbed a few beers at the bar first and discovered that the bartenders were on their game and extraordinarily friendly. We then took the party to the dining area and put our food order in. We went for a bucket of well done wings, plain sicilian pizza pie, and a sicilian topped with all sorts of protein. I typically don't order my wings well done but these turned out pretty tasty. The pizza itself was not much to look at upon first glance, but after I took my first bite, I was sold. I hadn't had pizza this good in quite awhile. The cheese pizza with no frills was decadent. The quality of the cheese and the toppings on the meat pizza was very evident. The meatballs and pepperoni were phenomenal.

We sat in the dining area and got to meet the owner Joe, who was a super nice guy. The dining area is very comfortable and they have a nice menu selection. They serve breakfast lunch and dinner and serve food til 11pm. 

Chicken Milanese with twice baked potato, veggies and garlic bread was the special and my friend enjoyed it very much. She's Italian and all I heard were compliments on the food. 

I went for the pizza. They have three kinds, thin, Sicilian and Chicago deep dish. The thin crust is more like the thickness of a hand tossed pizza. The Sicilian is supposed to be double that thickness and deep dish is, well you know what deep dish is, don't you? 

I ordered a 10"" thin cheese with black olives (my fav). See my picture. It was delicious and perfectly cooked. I had to take most of it home as it was quite filling. I really like the cheese they use. 

It's not far from main st casino- it doesn't look like much from the outside but don't let that fool you. 

Check it out when you're in the downtown area!",TOrRfYRFuxx0k9HH7OC6pQ,2,1,5,lruwaWUmnDnajJ2LHZf6Gw

A tad off the strip but well worth the trip if you're looking for some great pizza. Open late, sports bar right next to the restaurant. Not the best looking joint, but it's clean and the food makes up for the rest of it.",ehIpQo8mQHxhNIq7WAwKFw,0,0,4,h4gjhi1Nw-zbWnebocf9ZA

The people here are terrific and go out of their way with service.  the Chicago style ""italian"" food is great , and the daily specials are always terrific.  Great place to watch a game or hang out with friends.

Try the small thin crust pizza with sausage, the cheese is delicious!!",j3WNuSotcKBKZFofP9QP-Q,1,1,4,7JjCs6rbLFqZesyx4cl6oA
5116430,2010-06-24,3,yd0g-FRSAdP9YKm7Z8-uUw,"Not hip, not trendy, not funky fresh, not the flava of the week, but the pizza here is some of the best I have had in Vegas. La Piazza is located in the unlikely location of a Best Western Hotel. I have not ventured past the pizza here, so no opinion on the rest of the menu. Vegas, the other windy city where most of the pizza blows, offers La Piazza, where you will discover an outstanding thin crust pie....not New York Style. I'm really not sure what kind of pizza category it would fall under. The crust is thin, and crisp, and can handle a kitchen full of toppings without going limp. They also offer up a Chicago style deep dish pie that is also pretty rockin'. I'm not saying it's the best by Chicago standards, but you would be hard pressed to find a better Chicago style deep dish pizza here in Vegas. Rosati's being up there for the Chicago style too. My biggest problem with the place is trying to decide on the thin crust or the deep dish. Staff is friendly, place is clean, the neighborhood will be a turn off for those that have been coddled in life, but it's not THAT bad really from a safety standpoint. To walk there from Fremont and Main St. Is really no problem, it's not a scenic stroll though. If you're looking for a scene or to be seen, this is not the place for you. But if you are looking for some pretty rockin' pies in the ""other"" windy city that is Las Vegas, La Piazza will hit the spot.",TwUqavuMpDWCw9iCva3KXA,3,3,4,0NRbgMXfcaJhf-SudHQ7Tw

But what do you expect from bears fans.   Pizza was super cheesy mmmm   Pizza was average but still tasty.  Tight space due to all the fans cramped up in one room, but was still a good time!   Pizza deal was 7.77 for a 12 inch 3 topping. So the bill was nice! A bit smokey.    Im used to no smoking in buildings in Chicago",S_BD0m7gsYAHqBDqOK5EEA,0,0,3,pNTA-DUQ2qX4631a-9mWEg

I got a pepperoni pizza to-go and when I got home and opened the box I could tell immediately it was not cooked even half way through.  Cut into a slice and the crust was completely raw on the inside!  How could this happen, I could tell it was raw by looking at the outside of the crust, why couldn't the person who cooked it tell.  The crust was completely white and gooey in the middle, not golden brown.  

I decided I am already home, not going to take it back and have them remake it.  Tried to finish the cooking process in my oven.  The pizza was not good even after I finished cooking the crust.",B9E-0zwJ6mkMtWnJAOpUaQ,1,0,1,6wReVFjReHYog-eAlzGSbg

Well, about a year ago, I asked a friend who lived nearby and he said that he had never gone their either. I said ""Tonights the night"". We went and were were pleasantly surprised. It is non-smoking while the kitchen is open (approx. 8am to 11pm). I said we have to come back for a full meal. When we came back we ordered the Chicago Style deep dish pizza- so GOOD-their sauce rocks! We have been coming back every week since then. Tonight we found out that it is closing after the Super Bowl on February 7. NOOOOOOOO! We will have to come here ore than once a week.",FhkZk24n_Dh-pVLpBKUwEw,2,0,5,U9g_0xpdOtcAGpOy_WT6dw
5845300,2010-02-18,3,yd0g-FRSAdP9YKm7Z8-uUw,JUST SAY NO! This place is up the street from my job in a bad neighborhood. The food is SOOO bad. I have ventured here a few times under lunch bunch pressure only to be reminded that there is NO reason to serve this food to humans! Once I had a lump of lettuce that came over on the Mayflower in my salad. Another time the re-fried beans looked more recycled than re-fried. This makes me want to find a real dive to upgrade to! I can only imagine the cockroach poker parties that go on in that kitchen.,5mkRo6VhwdYQ0X2qbBFE_Q,1,0,1,lgQq2aXhf9xp6MerANajSQ
