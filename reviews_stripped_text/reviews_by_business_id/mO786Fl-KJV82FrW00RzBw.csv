He asked us what we liked and started whipping up these giant rolls. Everything was super fresh. I can't even say what my favorite item was because it was all delicious....maybe the marinated ahi. Great prices too! Prices are cheaper if you go in and pick it up as opposed to having it delivered by ubereats.",zbalgC4yB7pycbcL35o2Hw,0,0,5,BMndVMLovqZ27F1kuGae1Q

Walking in it smelled fishy and looked like a dive...,,made me a little worried. However no need to worry! The food they produced was beautiful & delicious!

1962829,2017-04-02,6,mO786Fl-KJV82FrW00RzBw,"Hadn't even heard of this place til I found a Groupon- and it's not a bad deal. They market themselves as wholesale sushi, and while that doesn't exactly conjure up the most positive impression, it isn't misleading either. Location is bare-bones, in the back of the Juan's Flaming Fajitas plaza, mostly takeout with one table to dine in. 

They have basic rolls (Philly, Cali), specialty rolls (rainbow, spider), and Premium rolls. Rolls are good-sized but fairly basic even for the specialty options, and our large order of 6 rolls was very hit or miss. The Kelly Crunch and the Alaskan (with jalapeno and asparagus) rolls were good but the spicy scallop roll was awful with a metallic aftertaste and the imaginative fried okra in the Cajun roll was hard and offputting. I like that they're trying to expand and offer different rolls, but some of them didn't really work. 

TIP: They have check in discounts (free basic roll with $25+ pickup), a Yelp deal ($20 for $25), Groupons, etc available for an even cheaper home sushi party experience.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,15,6,3,hk0Of25Lyz5CFot1R69AmA

2488698,2017-05-16,0,mO786Fl-KJV82FrW00RzBw,"On demand sushi is a catering/pick up type place. We ordered 5 different sushi rolls for pick up. Service was good and the staff are friendly. When we picked up the food the presentation looked great. Beautiful looking sushi with flowers on a nice platter. Unfortunately, the sushi it self didn't taste as good as it looked. The rice consistency was not the right type for sushi and practically fell apart while trying to dip into the soy sauce. The fish wasn't very fresh either, and my husband nor myself were able to finish them. It is kind of comparable to grocery market sushi.",8hnwJtRq7ECbRPrlPRbWZQ,0,1,2,4ld_IOHKp3p5ixyLvwJJBQ

I would visit simply because of the convenience alone, but I was stunned at how flavorful and beautiful the food is compared to other poke bowl establishments. The price seals the deal. BY FAR.

But, do not be dissuaded. What we really didn't expect was the absolutely amazing sushi. Clarence, the sushi chef, is a master. We basically said do what you do best. All four rolls were wonderful. The fish was fresh. We also tried perfectly prepared poke.  The owner is a super nice guy who has a true passion for what he is doing.

4116464,2017-02-15,0,mO786Fl-KJV82FrW00RzBw,I bought a Groupon to check this place out. And Im so glad I did! The owner was so friendly and gave me good advice on what I should try instead of ordering the usual items. This was over the phone when I placed my order for pick up. He asked me what I liked and I went with whatever suggestions he made. When I picked it up the owner was super friendly. This restaurant is just for pick up or delivery only BUT there is a table there in case u needed to eat there. The establishment is still under works so its not fancy or anything. The sushi rolls were HUGE and FRESH. Price is great! Im definitely ordering pick up from this place again! Great place for pick up instead of ordering the expensive sushi at all Japanese restaurants.

Made an order last night - a Saturday - for pickup through Eat24, their ordering platform. Made the order, got halfway down to the restaurant to pick it up and got a phone call on the way. It was from Eat24, telling me that they had just heard from the restaurant owner and the restaurant was closed. (this was two hours before posted closing time).
