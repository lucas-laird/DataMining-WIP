1559531,2015-01-10,5,f4vb5tv60WaBcwzRhKpANA,"Cute little French breakfast and lunch place: quiche, sandwiches, salads, pastries, and coffee. At current time, their pastry selection looks a bit limited but the few items I did try were well-executed, the almond-paste-filled one: though it only had a scant amount inside.

Sandwiches are on fresh French bread, and gigantic, which justifies their $9 price tag. Staff recommends the Italian as their favorite.  They also have a lunch special featuring a soup of the day and fresh French bread. 

I was a little disappointed in the nonfat café latte I ordered: I'm used to French coffee being a bit stronger and bolder than what I was served here, which was a bit overly milky and didn't seem to be strong. Perhaps the beverages aren't their highlight.

Service was warm and genuine, and happy to suggest menu items to try. Location interior is homey and clean, without being shabby. Not sure this was the best area to open a bakery given the close proximity to German Bakery and the Kosher place across the intersection, but if they emphasize their French offerings, they should do well.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,10,7,3,uIg0U3ETHYep-k5Zm90LwA

My wife pulls up cafés in the area and Nanny's pulls up and the photos look good. I'm thinking a bowl of oatmeal to warm me up. Nope! It's this awesome little French place with incredible looking (and tasting) croissants and various pastries. 

My wife was a little put off by the lack of breakfast items, however, she gutted out a croissant with butter and jam and probably the best cup of hot chocolate I've ever tasted.  My wife admitted that it was a perfect breakfast. The ladies that run this place are extremely cool and very friendly and put you at ease immediately. All with a genuine French accent.

My daughter and I got the egg and ham croissant. When it came out I was a little wigged out because the egg and ham was microwaved. Usually, eggs and microwaves do not get along. But, surprisingly, it was fluffy, buttery and delicious. So, all you hoytie toytie upper crust snobs (Lilly) who are put off by such things, relax, it's good. Really good.

We got an apple tart to go and it too, was off the hook good. Thank you to the French hotties who run the place. We'll be back when in town.",_nbJahjXGV-Y-ipYNytO5g,1,1,4,wLi1fMkfyrTQfRu7Sgq4Ug

Fresh tomato & balsamic salad
Flaky chocolate croissant
Unique chicken parm (not like a typical one, this one is filled with thinly sliced chicken, parmesan, EVOO, and balsamic reduction 

My man and I enjoyed our late breakfast here and were impressed with the food. It's a light amount and filled with some very good flavors and you can taste the quality ingredients that are used. This is a small place and the only thing I think could be even better is the decor. I enjoy details and I see so much potential here but it is clean and simple.

Place was empty at 3pm on a weekday so we decided to have some simple, light food. There was only one person working the place and she suggested the new Greek Salad. So we ordered at the register and she told us to go ahead and have a seat, and that we could pay afterwards. Had a good, slow-paced lunch -she made all of our food to order (2 sandwiches and a salad) so it took about 15minutes.  Throughout the meal she was topping off our water and checking if the food was ok, as we finished up she brought out complimentary pastries for us to try. So thoughtful! When I'm in the area, this will def be a great, healthy (or not-as-healthy if you like pastries and croissants) option. Baked items are all made in-store.

1. Greek Salad $8.95- large entree sized salad with bell peppers, tomatoes, cucumbers, olives - diff kinds, and tons of feta (a LOT). Light, filling, and really tasty.
2. Healthy Sandwich ($8.55)- sliced radishes, cream cheese, and chopped chives. Basic and light. Came with a small side of the Country salad. We asked for more cream cheese and she brought some extra out no probs. 
3. Italian Panini ($8.55)- Mozzarella, tomato, spices, and prosciutto-type meat, all panini-pressed until its crispy on the outside. Pretty good, lots of flavor from the herbs/spices she used. Came with a small side of the Country salad.
4. Pastries, not sure what fillings were in them but all were tasty. All were also slightly soft/mushy from being in the case probably. There would have been perfection is they could have been toasted up for a min before serving.",K8byELF3mfZxbVA_FPVo9w,13,6,4,ngSp9j_ISvXz4xfbyHa7cQ

2798948,2015-05-05,3,f4vb5tv60WaBcwzRhKpANA,"The most memorable thing about this little cafe and bakery in Summerlin is the service. The folks here are so friendly it might catch you off guard and leave you wondering why more people aren't as kind. You can order at the counter but if you're planning on eating there, you can grab a seat and they'll be happy to wait on you table side. 

Their menu consists of baked goods, sandwiches, and a few hot items. The Belgian ($8.95), filled with black forest ham and gouda cheese, was about a foot long, thin panini accompanied by a small side salad. It may have been a simple sandwich, but it was plenty satisfying. Baked goods were hit or miss. The chocolate croissant was flakey and airy, filled with a touch of semi-sweet chocolate. The mini apple danish was decent as well. On the other hand, a flat, limp mini almond croissant was a disappointment with an interior that was rather doughy with an undercooked quality to it. 

I love that some of their pastries come in a mini size -- perfect for sampling a variety of items. But, in a town with so many good bakeries it's unfortunate that their service was the highlight of the visit.",C2C0GPKvzWWnP57Os9eQ0w,8,5,3,n92D5XWyiy7SZl-420kJgQ

Everything is fresh and home made, from the outstanding coffee to the oo-la-la quiches to the formidable pastries to the fantastique sandwiches.  And the soups are excellent.

I was feeling slightly adventurous and since I'm not that familiar with french food, I asked her to recommend something for us. She suggested the 1/2 sandwich and salad special. I got the Greek salad and turkey sandwich. She recommended the ham and cheese croissant for my son.  We sat down and enjoyed the view out the window while we waited.  Within about 5 minutes they brought the food to our table.  It looked amazing!  Everything tasted just as good as it looked. My son ate every bite of his sandwich and the little salad that came with it. My Greek salad was delicious and fresh as well.

I didn't mind but my boyfriend was a bit disappointed. We noticed the pastries of the day and decided to get one of those as well. There was an apricot pistachio and a fig one. I let my boyfriend decide and he chose apricot pistachio even though I wanted the fig one haha. The cashier, who I think might also be an owner, must have overheard me because she ended up giving me the fig pastry to try for free! I haven't tried the pistachio yet but the fig was amazing.

In a strip mall near the corner of Rampart and Lake Mead, there is ample parking but all the spots in front were marked 20 minute parking so I didn't park there.

There is a small menu for breakfast--a couple of omelettes and some breakfast paninis.  I chose the ham and cheese omelette and a black coffee.  I then took my seat and the very nice woman who took my order soon brought the coffee.  It was rich and strong with a good flavor.  Then the omelette came.  The egg was very fluffy and it was served with four thick slices of very tasty baguette.

The ham was thin lunch meat and there was a good amount to go with the cheese.

I would like to have more of a choice at breakfast but given the small size of the place, I guess I can't expect a large menu.  I enjoyed my breakfast.",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,12,9,3,0Mkzp6TvXFF6nGaudu3Png

The food - I had an Italian sandwich and didmt really read the ingredients closely when ordering - I figured I knew what an Italian sandwich was.  I was wrong. However, it was awesome.  There was only a thin sliced piece if Italian ham, a piece of provolone, some olive spread and a dries tomato.  I'm thinking this thing was missing at least two other meats...  However the blend of these high quality ingredients along with the delightful bread was more than satisfying.  

The people -. Very nice people who operate the business.  You feel like you're on vacation and you hear their French accent.  

The place -. Very clean but the most uncomfortable chairs for bigger folks inside - I felt like I was at the kiddie table.  I will never, ever eat inside again. My butt hurts and may back hurt.  Never again.

Nanny's is a French cafe. They have a small menu of sandwiches, paninis, salads, and omelets. Plus, they had some beautiful looking pastries. After perusing the menu Joel ordered the salami sandwich and I had the Belgian panini. 

Joel's sandwich came on a huge piece of baguette. It had salami, cheese, and pickles. Plus, it had a side salad with romaine lettuce, tomatoes, eggs, and topped with ranch dressing. He said it was good, but nothing we couldn't make at home. My Belgian panini was so large it took up most of my plate. It was hot, toasty and loaded with ham and gouda cheese all melted together.

My friend had the Italian sandwich and couldn't stop raving about it. Highly recommend this place for either breakfast or lunch.,Y0VfqxMOcjVcdCIwKdm1rA,0,0,5,KPZbkS6SvRyHmEslokZGog

Light on the meat by American standards, but very flavorful.  I would have quality with good flavor or quantity any time, and this place seems to focus on that.  I will be back.",hAZEee0Q7APAcerRQ4Ze3g,1,0,4,PerJna9ERfbOVm2mUNpeIw

Jamie and I split a Greek Salad and Belgian Panini (Black Forest ham and gouda) - terrific combo, also excellent French coffee and chocolate croissants. You know it's authentic French when both employees, probably the owners, are speaking French in the kitchen. We'll be back for sure - need to try their breakfasts.",wj6GUyVGyxQVw8dWb0QgNg,2,0,5,3rmO4tS-m0gTG6afcMeTrQ

My kid is 7 and he ordered the Nanny's sandwich, which has a pepper sauce on it and the ladies who worked there were very sweet and after we had sat down brought us a sample of the sauce to ensure that he liked it, without us asking. They even smashed it panini style so he could fit it in his mouth.

We ordered two cafe lattes and they were over priced for what you get, but the sandwiches are worth what you paid. I got the panini with the buffalo sauce on it and it was fantastic! Would absolutely eat here again, this was our second visit.",S_7OkmN0BicgWEt2oMmzIQ,1,1,4,aJ-CZYbQ_mOgsPbJEvhXXg

I felt like some of the tables were too close to one another for a private conversation. Other than that, it's pretty much perfect. I paid $40 for two people to eat breakfast/brunch, both have coffee/tea, and even took one of each pastry in the display case home with me.

I love the coffee, one of my friends got the ham and cheese omelet, and another the ""Spicy"" sandwich which  they both raved about.  The owner too great care of us and sitting outside was a lovely bonus.  We'll be back again and gain, I'm sure!

The sandwiches, salad and breakfasts are simple plus the coffee is strong. All the breads are baked there on site. The Panini's come with a small salad. There is outdoor seating too.

5947999,2016-11-08,0,f4vb5tv60WaBcwzRhKpANA,Was going to Classic Kids to buy my son his pre-school uniforms and they didn't open until 10:00 so took my son and infant daughter in for breakfast. I was excited to find out the owners were from Belgium but sadly they didn't speak Flemish (same as Dutch really) but rather French only-still happy to talk about The Netherlands and Belgium. My son got a bunch of small doughnuts and AMAZING mini muffins-he loved the chocolate Ines which were filled with creamy chocolate. I told them I was on a low carb diet (shedding the baby weight) and they made me a great ham and cheese omelette with a side of salad. I also had a double espresso. Great little place!!!,DmtgMXZTKmTILg6OyzhJbQ,1,0,5,hRp3fsuDHw04-UWkNHINvg
