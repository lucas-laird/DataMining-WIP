50964,2012-11-13,3,8YjfILsV0xu84t0aTiceig,"whenever I write a 'less than stellar' review, I always wait a few days. I just like to take all emotion out of the review. I have waited almost 2 weeks to write this - mainly because this Papa Murphy is less than a mile from my house and I always root for the local businesses in my neighborhood.
Here goes:
I have been to this location enough to fill up a punch card (12th visit gets you 50% off your next order)... So I thought - AWESOME! On Halloween, I don't want to cook and we are having people over before going downtown for the Las Vegas Parade. I bring a friend (who has never been to Papa Murphy's). I have talked up the place to her and convinced her that pizza would be better than Mediterranean food for the occasion. 
We walk in, there are 3 others in the shop, two are waiting for their pizzas and 1 is paying. We walk up to the registers, pick a couple of salads and grab a menu. We we not greeted, but, you know, people get busy - and we are gabbing away anyways. Well.... after standing next to the workers 'building' the pizzas and a few feet from the left register for 5 minutes - Another woman walks in to the shop. The manager or owner (I assume) who is building the pizza, asks another employee to help 'the guests.' 
The employee proceeds to greet the other woman and start taking her order. After a moment, the 'Manager' asks us if we've been helped. We let her know we hadn't. She proceeded to tell us because we weren't standing right at the register, thats why know one had helped us............ 
*REMINDER* : I've been here enough to earn the complimentary 50% discount. It's not my first rodeo at this place. AND we did go straight to the registers when we arrived. How would we have picked out the Greek Salads (which are in between the 2 registers).... 
Needless to say, a place that makes it the guests fault that they weren't helped is not a place that I need to spend money at.... It's really too bad! 
I have had no issues the other 11 times at this location - but those times I came in after 6pm (this visit was around 1:30pm). I have always been helped by the night male 'manager/owner' (assumption on title, but these are franchises that are proprietor owned)..........
I will say, I've never seen it busy at this location, so maybe when they get more than 1 or 2 people in their store at once they get a little ""overwhelmed.....""
But, I think it will be awhile before I return, and needless to say, my friend will never get to try Papa Murphy's because she doesn't like rude service- especially when it's at a pizza place that you have to take home and cook yourself.",1prJgTrk4kH85h6mvDTL3A,5,0,2,ubQ29TK33zy68bPklg-qZQ
119014,2015-04-28,0,8YjfILsV0xu84t0aTiceig,"So where to begin......

I've been to this location three times and my experience has progressively gotten worse.

The first time I went here the service was fine for the most part and the pizza was good for this type of pizza.

The second time I went there I waited 20 minutes or so because they only had one person working and had 7 people or so waiting or ordering  pizza. The pizza was once again good for this type of pizza.

The third time I went there was again, only 1 person working and they would not take the coupon I just printed off coupons.com. The employee stated that they only take coupons that come to you via email.  The funny thing was they took my coupon last time and I printed that off of another coupon site.

My wait would not have been as long as last time as only 3 people were ahead of me but I still would have waited longer than I should have if I actually gave them my business. I decided to go elsewhere for dinner.

So if you like to wait, be frustrated by inconsistent couponing policies, this is your Papa Murphy's. Otherwise steer clear and find another pizza place.

2 stars for them as their pizza is good, but the service is sub par.",giqNe9Ecx4R-xb5VgQ4dLA,2,0,2,DZUB3JHpssRL8nCZy-v6_g

My mom had called the store asking for a certain person who worked there (our order was messed up before and we were told that we would be comped the next visit). Immediately the ""owner"" Carrie yelled ""Jason doesn't work here!"" and slammed the phone on my mom. In complete disbelief, we called again and this Carrie lady yells ""I told you there is no Jason here! Were too busy to deal with this."" And slammed us again. We decided to take a stroll to this location and we were greeted nicely (not one person was in this store, must be pretty busy), and once my mom asked to talk to the owner Carrie knew who we were. She screamed at us saying were not welcome and that they're too busy, running out dough, and product. There was a huge scene caused by this Carrie woman and I have never been treated so rudely in my entire life. We've been to this location HUNDREDS of times and never once did we encounter something like this. I wouldn't even give this place one star.",0eVEEn32XY5HM1KsBu3QzA,5,0,1,dR43EesYPLsJg8OjMLxmfw

Pizza: Awesome as usual. Their large pie is larger than most other joints, around $10, Family size is $2 more. Dough is very good and when you bake it at home, you can control how crisp the bottom is. They are not skimpy on toppings either. The baking tray it comes on is super. By making it at home, your pie is hot out of the oven, not lukewarm and soggy like delivery pie. The pizza will bake perfectly.

Staff: Very friendly and helpful.

Value: All things considered, size of pie, fresh ingredients, large topping selection, great dough, bake it hot at home, it is worth every penny! This is not like Cici's or Little Caesars, much better.

Give it a shot and I think you will be happy.",rhH1Cqta8lb3n-t0fTRm5w,2,0,5,3LvLrFV3Z5RPQt6BaCyX_w

I am also lured to the Papa Murphy's by it's copious coupon deals.  They regularly mail out a book of coupons that contain some pretty good discounts.  Obviously, cheap,""homemade"" pizza cannot be resisted.

Overall, Papa Murphy's isn't the best pizza.  It's worlds better than the freezer section and, to me, better than places like Dominos and Pizza Hut.  

P.S. This location is spotless and provides quick service.  Also, if you're on an EBT diet, they randomly accept those.",gq8dZgJConBUANpSFzKKjg,6,1,3,Ct0ycZmrKj_3F2kiA488OA

There's a reason Zagat has rated this the best pizza chain multiple times, and there's a reason people listen to Zagat and not random biased reviewers who only get noticed by virtue of writing the first review. 

Papa Murphy's gives you quality food for a good price and you don't even have to deal with waiters, seating, or any of the trappings of a normal restaurant environment. It's a low key good quality experience.",yXuvxLICKpUCrM7cg4E2Bw,1,0,5,6UTeMISqfTbcqyZ7lPYSow

They make the pizza there for your and then you take it home and cook it yourself. Ordered a $14 medium cowboy special. The establishment is clean and the staff is amicable, but quiet and non-engaging.

Pizza came with instructions on how to cook. So there's that.

Here's the issue with this entire scenario; Papa Murphy's is located in the same shopping center as Smiths. Based on the taste of the pizza, we would have ben much better served just getting the ingredients ourselves. If I wanted so-so pizza with a very salty sauce, I can order from a chain and get it delivered in less time than it took to bake it at home, and for a cheaper price.

Also, you can get a far superior pizza at Costco for much less. So there's just really no point to go here. All negatives and no positives gets a red light from us.

At least we tried it, and there's no more curiosity as to how it is. Take a page from us and skip it.",4yG4J05aKzE2zov0Jr37kg,1,0,2,lwEdH_6i-T2XBcMXPqCUHw

The favor was good & the dough had a crisp since we got the thin style. Still there was some dough to chew as well.

All of the pizza's in this franchise have the exact same ingredients. It is called duplication.

Maybe there are some franchise locations owned by people who lack customer service and business skills, but not this location. I have been driving there twice a month from North Summerlin since they opened and I can assure you they run a tight ship (K.A)

I love this location and would not place a lot of credibility on reviewers with just a few posts or people looking for a free lunch.

I did try papa murphys many many years ago and it was horrible.  So to have one open at the corner of where I live, I was totally willing to give it a try but didn't expect much.  I only went in because they had several coupons that arrived in the mail.  So I went in and ordered a family size pepperoni pizza.  I got it home and baked it in my convection oven (which always bakes better then a regular oven) and to my surprise, it was REALLLLY good.  

A few days later they had their official grand opening specials and I went back again this time to get a sausage, mushroom and onion.  I was kinda caught off guard cause I was offered white onions, or the onion mixture. I was like well what is an onion mixture?  It's white onion, green onions, and red onions. Well hell I'm a huge onion and garlic fan so I went for the mixture.  I also played one of their games for the grand opening and won a card FULL of huge discounted coupons for several styles of pizza.  

I went again 2 days later before their specials ended and got a large 2 topping pizza for only $7 

Then 2 days later they called me telling me I won a family size pizza.

So all in all, let me sum this up.  

Service for this location - Very nice (especially since it was all young teens/kids who usually don't give a crap) I met 2 of the managers and they were very nice too.

Quality & Taste - I honestly really enjoyed it and am looking forward to trying some of their combo type pizzas.

Price - Well this is the only problem I actually have.  I honestly won't ever goto this place and pay full price. I think it's over priced just like every other pizza place.  A typical large pizza should be $5  (little caesars and cici's pizza) Don't mis understand me though. Those 2 places are definitely cheap pizza, but they are decent.   

I think papa murphys is definitely a step above those 2 place but again their prices are high.  However I''ve already noticed that they frequently have coupons and as long as I have a coupon I would DEFINITELY go back.  

I mean come on. $7 for a family size (x-large) pepperoni. YUMMMM

I look forward to being a regular customer at this location.",9GyTNxzAN8UxpPPSTfei-A,2,0,5,lx19hMcFCJ0nNa2QgBvtjQ

Every time I go in, I'm greeted with smiling faces, great attitudes, and a clean shop. I stop by after work to pick up a couple pizzas to take home for the family and it's always quick and accurate. It's so convenient and the family loves pizza night because we get to make it bake it ourselves!",spp4JKBoiVJGNkaH46UDBw,0,0,5,29KLLV8afI8GnkOCT1WBHA

I called and asked for a Cheese Pizza. They asked for my name and phone number and I went to pick it up about 10 min later. I get there and there is a uncooked pizza on the table. I asked the lady this is not my pizza right? She says yes, we are a take and bake. I'm respond, nobody told me. She says oh we don't have to tell you that's how we are. I say I have hungry ppl and I don't want to have to bake this myself. She gets mad and says that's rude. At this point I just walk away and tell her you need to inform ppl on the phone as you have a different concept and many people don't know. Unbeliaveble.  Papa Murphy's management. Freaking include as part if your phone etiquette. We are a take and bake pizza how may I help you. Not that hard to do so. I'm so mad I shouldn't even give you this business tip. I will never ever ever be back there or any papa Murphy's ever!!!!!",8TuZ5jO1_tjaISwlmt1h-w,2,2,1,e8B2CtrRwia3b5WpDAl7sw

I purchased a pizza (very good) and a salad (not very good). The salad lettuce turned brown and I don't care for stale salads. I called them and the next day (today) I returned the salad and told them we could not eat salad with our dinner last night. Quite irritating to have to return the salad and not have it for dinner. The employee handed us a new salad. No offer of refund, no offer for anything to compensate us for our inconvenience or their error. The gentleman at the counter said if I give you a free salad, I would get fired. Interesting - I don't believe it. When I mentioned common sense, I felt like I was talking to a wall.  His blank attitude made me think that he's so glad to get me out of that store. He won't have to worry. I'm gone.",VkpABkbDZR_Pf4AJnaQIdg,1,0,1,JHDicCTbVYEkrWtSN2qFmA

My only problem with Papa Murphy's is they take food stamp cards. I hate paying full price for my pizza and someone else's.",0KeT9NKimYkHN0wlrij-dg,1,1,4,zT51NqmM3-jQes9nYEORVQ

Just missed the pizza.  Called my beloved spousal unit and told him the oven temp and when I hit the door, we would have a hot pizza in less than 20 minutes. That being said, I was so happy to find this Papa Murphy's though I would LOVE to have one here in Summerlin for my convenience. LOVE the Gourmet vegetarian with red sauce (instead of white). Loaded with spinach, artichoke hearts, onions, zuchinni & tomatoes....add some olives and I'm all over it. They accommodate my beloved spousal unit's penchant for MEAT on one half and peace reigns in the LV Valley. Papa Murphy's, Thanks for bringing a taste of home to the desert!",Q3Y0AjsTpuJuQ-TWZOlVzg,2,1,5,0piPjMO50xOytFHrdlMbxg
