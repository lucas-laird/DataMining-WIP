The problem is pastry isn't well cooked, coffee doesn't taste very good, and the service is exceedingly slow.

On the positive side seating is ample and the shop is air conditioned.

Honestly I think Starbucks and Samba Latte are both much better choices.",hvbj_NW7sEEmLqmc_WCybw,0,0,2,C2GktD7zyW_VFr8z3aMaCQ

444430,2017-05-24,0,m6QREZLAQatX1swZ2FN4hQ,"Wasn't that impressed. 

Went on a slow Tuesday around 1 ish and it wasn't that great. 
The menu in my opinion is confusing and there are no prices listed anywhere for normally coffee stuff. It's also written in chalk and it's a SUPER wide menu so it's hard to see the whole thing. Unless you have ""that drink"" that you order at every coffee shop (you know the one) the menu isn't helpful, it's basically just flavors.

The biggest issue I had is I ordered a pastry with my coffee and it wasn't given to me at the time my coffee came out. So I had to wait around for it. When the barista noticed I was waiting for something  she let me know that she'd grab it in a minute. Meanwhile she kept making other drinks and having a conversation with her customer. Waited about 5-10 minutes to get a pastry handed to me. 

Barista apologized for the wait but ... c'mon. You see me standing around for 5 minutes waiting and instead of taking the 5 seconds to step away from the drinks you're making and grab the pastry out of the glass container.. You instead make me wait 5-10 minutes while you finish all the drinks (that were ordered WAY after I had already been waiting). Just little things like this are frustrating. 

Overall I got the sense that the bar flow and order of how things were made and processed wasn't very efficient but the coffee was good. But, not good enough to deal with everything else. I probably won't return. Waiting so long for a pastry + the awful menu + not *that* great of coffee isn't worth it to me.",LcQ4JedpWqMACuGZuu7uyQ,0,0,3,yPxwuyAQVAPnJAxi6CUynA
461892,2017-07-04,0,m6QREZLAQatX1swZ2FN4hQ,Was so excited to go here. It was 10:30am on a Saturday and there was a very loud band playing inside the coffee shop. Who also took up most of the inside tables. It was so loud it was hard to order or hear your name called for your drink or food. I was there with 2 other people who I could not even hold a conversation with. When I asked the girl calling out names who's name she said she didn't even answer me she just said not your's. Uhh ok but I'm with 2 other people as well. She looked at me confused and told me what the sandwich was...not who's but what. Once we finally had all our food and drinks the 3 of us sat at a tiny table outside so we could hear eachother. The coffee was pretty good.

I came here on a Saturday morning a little bit before 9am. The Cuppa at DTS is NOT a good study spot. There is way too much foot traffic; music is louder than the music I'm playing through my earphones; I couldn't find any outlets. They have ample seating as most people seem to be grabbing their drinks and going. The crowd definitely grows and gets progressively louder. They have wifi, so I guess that's nice. But if you want serious studying done, this is not the place.

Coffee wise, I really enjoyed my drink. I got the lavender flavored latte in medium. You could get floral hints throughout your coffee, but the star was still the coffee flavor which was great. Even though I came an hour after opening, the pastry selection on display was really meager. 

All in all, I loved my drink. I will drop by whenever I'm shopping at DTS, but I'm never studying here ever again.

It's nice to have another option other than Starbucks and Dunkin' Donuts that's right in front of my house. I've only been here when they opened on weekdays (7 a.m.) due to final exams, but have stayed until DTS actually opened (10 a.m.) so my review is based off of that time period. It's an awesome place to go for coffee or to study. I've only had their regular coffee (both iced and hot) during all my visits and they tasted fine. I'm not picky when it comes to coffee nor am I particular in how it tastes so coffee is coffee to me. Basically the coffee doesn't taste burnt which is a good for me. They have their own private wifi and an option to sit outside. Unfortunately they don't have a lot of outlets that I've seen so far so it'll be harder to charge your electronic device. One of my favorite things is that there's parallel parking spots right in front of the coffee shop so it saves some walking. It's basically dead at 7 a.m., but once it hits 9 a.m., that's when it starts picking up. I've only tried one food item on their menu and it was their jalapeño cheese bagel. Honestly I prefer the 59¢ ones over at Smiths. A good amount of cream cheese comes with the bagel which is awesome, but the bagel itself was not only dry, but crumbly. Not a big deal, just wouldn't order it again. The music noise level was at a medium so it might be bothersome to people that are sensitive to noises, but it wasn't a big deal for me since I did have my own headphones. The staff has always been kind and attentive. Never had an issue, never made me feel uncomfortable, and they've always had a smile on their face. Truly shows what the staff is like if they're able to do this at 7 a.m. The girl that has taken my order, on the day that I ordered the bagel, heated it for me without even asking which I appreciated a lot. I was planning on taking my plate back once I was finished studying, but the same girl came and removed it out of the way for me without me even asking which I also really appreciated. I've also seen the staff clean the tables often both outside and inside. Overall it's a nice, close coffee shop for me to visit if I need to kill time or a place to study.

It's about time DT Summerlin got a legitimate coffee shop.. granted the location isn't AS accessible as a drop in shop (i.e. if you wanted to come study you'd have to lug your stuff through the mall to get here-- unless you got here right when it opened and parked on the street).

There is ample seating and the atmosphere is nice and lively. 

I brought my pups on a Sunday morning right when they opened. Their beverages are tasty, albeit typical cafe selections and prices. The croissants are delicious. I have yet to try their breakfast selection but I anticipate it will be good also. They also serve meals such as sandwiches, quiche, etc.

I really like the patio seating area. It's enclosed so you can let your dogs roam around a bit (as long as the patio was empty as it was when we were there) without fear of them running into the street. You're also allowed to bring the pups inside while you order. 

I met Holley, the proprietor of the cafe, and she as very nice and responsive. She told me they're hosting a Canine and Coffee on May 20th.

4655051,2017-04-09,7,m6QREZLAQatX1swZ2FN4hQ,"Finally Downtown Summerlin is home to a coffee shop. After nearly three years, customers no longer have to rely on the tiny Starbuck's in Macy's for a caffeine beverage. As of this past Monday, just down the pedestrian pathway from Macy's is the Cuppa. 

  The Cuppa is just what Downtown Summerlin needed. It is a comfortable space to relax with a caffeinated beverage, a bakery treat, or sandwich. Today, I relaxed with first a cup of drip coffee then a hazlenut late. ""Relaxed"" is the key word because there were plenty of seating arrangements to relax. It's ironic that I visit a coffee house for a caffeine boost yet end up hanging out for a couple of hours mellow. 

  The Cuppa did a fantastic job with creating an inviting third place which is the term for a hangout spot outside of home and work. This is evident before stepping inside. Bordering a pedestrianized streetscape in the heart of Downtown Summerlin, the commodious patio attached to The Cuppa gives the passers-by a subconscious message that this is a place to stop and relax. On a cool April afternoon this was the place to enjoy a hazlenut late. The patio is furnished with tables and sofas. This is the ideal spot for Downtown Summerlin people watching. The inviting environment also permeates the large coffee shop. The walls are adorned with pictures of funny sayings. Halfway into the coffee shop is a library surrounded by plush seats. Bordering the left wall are plate glass windows overlooking Downtown Summerlin. To the right the counter takes up a large portion. 

    I walked to the counter on two occasions to order. The overhead menu made ordering simple. Off the menu, I ordered a medium coffee that costed $2.55 then later a medium hazlenut late that came to around $5.25. Both times, a friendly batista welcomed me. And both times they were in a mug. 

  I thought more highly of the hazlenut late than the coffee. This is one of the deals where the quality was high but I personally did not agree with the taste. It's one of those deals where several people would greatly appreciate it. It is a personal taste thing. Maybe next time I'll try the pour over. On the other hand, the hazlenut late was a taste that I preferred. What is nice is that there is a list of flavors to create the late. Next time I can switch it around with another flavor. I must add that it has a sweet taste for a sugar free syrup. 

  The Cuppa is the missing piece that completed the Downtown Summerlin puzzle. Finally after 2.5 years, Downtown Summerlin is home to a coffee shop where you can spend time in a relaxing setting with a quality caffeinated beverage.",0tvCcnfJnSs55iB6mqPk3w,16,16,4,zhueBcTvYnWzcU4KNzSJdQ

I just found out that Cuppa's last day is this Tuesday and I'm SO bummed. Because I basically LIVE in Downtown Summerlin, I'm SUPER bummed that this great coffee shop is leaving so quickly!

It's a super cute place, they have a few book shelves full of books to peruse, and they have a great array of drinks and food. And guys - they have bulletproof coffee!! Granted, I haven't been overly impressed with the coffee overall...it's worth it for the ambience and location. This is SUCH a killer location for a coffee shop, I'm really surprised they didn't do better. (Though, based on all the recent closings, it seems like not many restaurants make it in Downtown Summerlin.) 

The only other coffee shop in the mall is Starbucks, unless you count the espresso bar in that weird guy's clothing store where everything is always 50% off. I'd love another coffee shop to move into this place - I'd even like it if Starbucks just relocated to this spot instead of Macy's! 

Goodbye Cuppa, it was nice while it lasted.",ABrS2sgtZA1hSH3YTmNFPA,3,1,4,FHbDKUyxbKP88kxCVYVJZQ

First off, the customer service was terrible. The young man that took our order & made our drinks sounded like he was forced to be there, rather than enjoying his job. I said it was our first time there & he made no suggestions. I tried ordering some pastries but all he said was ""we're out"", no sorry or other suggestion as to what else I may like. The store lost money because after that I decided to get food elsewhere & just order drinks. 

The drinks we did order were a green tea lemonade slush & an iced chai. The slush was okay. Not great but not bad by any means. Just not something I'd order again. Their chai was where I was most let down. I personally base a good coffee shop off their chai & their chai gets 0 stars from me. The entire cup was filled to the top with ice, so I barely had any drink to drink. Also, their chai doesn't even taste like chai. It literally tastes like a watered down horchata. If I wanted horchata I would spend 1/4 of the money & get a horchata from Roberto's. 

Lastly, the rude barista never replied when I said thank you for either of the drinks & my boyfriend made a point to say bye & thank you as we left. To no surprise the barista had nothing to say in response. I would never go back here again & I know a lot of people that go to Downtown Summerlin & I will go out of my way to make sure no one wastes their money here.",zuJwiAXFGQ4_Dfozybx5kg,2,0,1,KbDIywViThtj8XSGXBvq6Q

Don't worry they also offer pastries that make your mouth water with the smell and make your mind melt with the flavor. 
Glazed cinnamon roll to the lemon bars can't be overlooked. 
I've always been a coffee fan and coffee shops make it easy to be lazy but it's rare to find a place that checks all the boxes and Cuppa DEFINITELY checks all the boxes.",1lKTTs1GvqdHuiZFDDYX_A,1,0,5,-8s3FjEySJ_tqOtOmJ_rWg

They were adequate, though it had a dominating creamy flavor. Could have used a boost of the spices, I think. 

I want to see The Cuppa do well and I think they should take some things into consideration: 

The seating looks haphazard and really disorganized to the eye. Tables placed wherever, turned this way and that. It also doesn't seem like there's enough tables. 

The empty bookshelves looks sad and messy. Either openly encourage a lending library or buy filler books.

There doesn't seem to be enough outlets.

5556345,2017-05-31,15,m6QREZLAQatX1swZ2FN4hQ,"FINALLY!!! I have been waiting for a good coffee shop to open at Downtown Summerlin foreverrrr! Lol. I'm especially glad that it's The Cuppa since I've always been a fan of their Russell location & it's nice to have a local coffee shop in the Summerlin area that isn't a Starbucks chain. 

First off, GREAT coffee! I am absolutely in love with their White Mocha Latte with almond milk and it's one of the reasons I keep coming back here. My friend also tried their Lavender Latte & we agreed that it's one of the bests! Definitely recommend those drinks for sure. Their Matcha Latte is alright, I really wanted to like it but I couldn't really taste the green tea flavor. 

Second, I love how it's a nice study spot! Keep in mind it doesn't have a lot of outlets and it can be a tad bit noisy when it gets busy but I love going here since it closes at 9pm (which is later than most!) and it's nearby my house which is a plus since other coffee shops that stay open late are pretty far from me. 

Third, their outdoor patio is ideal for those who love to bring their pups! I'm always at DTS with my dog and their patio is enclosed with a gate so you don't have to worry about your dogs running off lol. 

Fourth, love their atmosphere and how they have a good amount of seating inside and outside. They even have a nice little library of books if you just wanna enjoy a cup of coffee and a good read!

They do offer pastries and some savory croissants but their menu of food isn't much. They also have great customer service and are pretty fast in making your coffee. 

As a nursing student, I'm definitely happy to finally have a great coffee and study place in DTS!",rKdGiLfeE55TClso9GtjsA,31,23,4,VqcL787YUftZFL79asneQQ
