There's also hot dogs, custards, milkshakes, and plenty of other burgers out there for you to choose.

I've tried their chocolate, strawberry, and peanut butter milkshakes, and they were all very good. Fries were fine, nothing too special.

Seriously though, order the Shack Stack.",gyRRaEhwK_zbiJeWfXCxdQ,0,0,5,J5VlAEv4-1IrOiw6s1MU7w

I'd never been to a Shake Shack before, so I strolled there from the City Center.  The walk takes about 15 minutes.  

I have to say I was pleasantly surprised with my Shake Shack burger.  It was fresh and tasty, and the bun reminded me (by texture) of a King's Hawaiian roll (but not as sweet).

People always say they want to go to Vegas and try shake shack. Knowing this, you would think that the employees would have exceptional customer service. This is not the case. I've been here twice with two different people and both times were not that great. One star because the shake was really good but everything else sucked. The employees did not crack a smile one time, they rushed through our orders and I understand that it's busy, however you should be able to try to help recommend something for someone who has never eaten at your establishment. I got cheese fries and they were cold. My friend ordered a burger and asked them the melt the cheese more and they said it's not possible to do so. My other friend asked for ranch and the guy replied ""sorry sweetheart, we don't carry ranch here"" in a condescending manner. The food is not all that great and the employees don't make it worth coming. Go down the strip and spend your money at Taco Bell cantina lol",JPsSE7yYjymImcG8WY_qGQ,0,0,1,CgqXmjtUTRI4WcGTw1AwVw

Obviously, nothing can get better than In & Out Burgers lol. But....I love how Shake Shack offers different items on the menu: friendly to meat eaters, to vegetarians, to those who do not eat red meat but can eat poultry & sausages.

They have an extensive menu offering items such as chicken sandwiches (MY FAVE!) to frozen custards to chicago hot dogs. Since we were already here, we pretty much ordered everything on the menu. Kinda felt bad for the lady at the counter for being so patient with our indecisive selves.

What We Ordered: 

* Chicken Sandwich: THIS WAS DELICIOUS! The chicken inside was juicy, crunchy, and flavorful. Now I know why it's a favorite. I did appreciate how they did not skimp on the veggies.

* Mushroom Burger: For all you vegetarians out there, this one is for you! This is basically a fried portobello mushroom in place of a meat patty. Bit don't be fooled! It's delicious!

* Original Burger w/ Fried Mushroom: Best of both worlds all in one bite. So glad my cousin ordered this, it gave me a chance to keep taking samples haha. The meat patty itself has a good flavor. The bun is very moist & soft. I's order this again.

* Chicago Dog: Not bad. Haven't had an orginal Chicago Dog so I can't really vouch on its authenticity. But I would stick with the burgers if you're not much of a hotdog person.

* Pie Cement: Frozen custard mixed with their pie of the day. It's decadent & rich. Do not consume if you are on a diet or if you are lactose intolerant haha.

Fries: Basic. Still like In & Out's hand cut fries.

Verdict? All in all, I'm glad to have finally gotten the chance to try Shake Shack. I'd definitely go back on my next trip to Vegas. However, I did knock one star down for the price. For 4 people, I spent $89. Well I guess with the amount of items we ordered it would be understandable. But $89 is high for fast food.",-M1Nv9UYmgFEcJhJxQr8CQ,1,1,4,wpvmClTLEUDcMfEcIA9BIA

The simple answer. Because it's fucking good! 
A little on the pricier side for a fast food establishment, but you really are paying for the quality in this case. Beef is supremely good for a fast food establishment. Obviously very fresh, which is sadly more than you can say for most in the same category. I got cheese fries, expecting some sort of bagged ordeal melted on top. My friends, this is a nacho cheese type smothering your fries. It feels very middle school-esque but in the most positive way possible. 


Variety wise? Nothing ground breaking. It's pretty simple in terms of what they offer. I wouldn't necessarily go out of my way to make it here again. But it seriously surpassed my expectations. 

If I were you, I'd check out another location unless you are staying directly on the strip. It was busy, and is likely consistently busy. Even so, it's worth the wait.",bfq5L0rWgG5VQF3tU1TF5w,1,1,4,5qJ1d7x4NdmbbUOKEWhxPQ

I've fallen in love with the arena cheeseburger all over again!

Quick Review
+ Best walk-up food available at any arena, anywhere.

+ Location, location, location! This is the arena's Shake Shack® listing.

- Queues get lengthy ... well ... because of the location: the arena.

Employee of Excellence
N/A. Or, that guy/gal anonymously making the burgers back there.

------------------------------------------

Note: This is for the arena listing. The Park listing is here: https://www.yelp.com/biz/shake-shack-las-vegas-2. Cheat sheet: if you're inside an arena named for crappy mobile service carrier, this is your listing. If you are near New York, New York casino, go to the other listing. There are two locations (believe it or not)! 

It's no revelation that when in an arena or stadium or ballpark or prison, one's choices are limited. It is typically between shit and more shit. Fortunately -- in Las Vegas -- there is Shake Shack. 

It's no secret, as there will be queues of patrons waiting to order, waiting to pick-up their already-placed orders, and to accessorize their orders with condiments. And, for times when I am not physically pinned to the barrier for a pit show, I'll meander over with all the other yuppies to Shake Shack for a burger, fries, and a shake. And you should too!

Final Thought
If you're at the Las Vegas Arena, for a game or show, this is pretty much the only legitimately good place to eat. Keep the hotdogs limited to baseball, please.

Good for tourists.
Good for kids.
Not good for dogs.

I have something to confess.
I like Shake Shack better than In-N-Out Burger!

After first trying Shake Shack at the pop up event at the Source (in Denver), I was hooked! I knew I had to introduce everyone to it when we hit the strip!

++ Located just outside the New York, New York casino, it exudes all things NYC! Brooklyn bridge, I love NY signs and more surround the space!
++ Ample seating! Whether you're sitting inside to see where the magic happens, or outside on the patio, there is a spot for everyone!
++ Brooklyn beers on tap! Or freshly brewed tea, lemonade and soda for those none drinkers.
++ Staff is friendly and beyond efficient! They have the burger ordering process down to a well oiled machine - which runs smoothly!
++ Food is outstanding - duh! I opted for the ""Shack Stack"" which featured a cheeseburger and a fried cheese portabello mushroom topped with lettuce, tomato and ShackSauce! Seriously, SO GOOD.
++ Hot dogs and chicken is also offered!
++ THE BEST CRINKLE FRIES EVER.
++ Open until 2am to curb those late night cravings!

While you will have to shell out a pretty penny to enjoy this greasy goodness (our bill for 2 burgers, 2 fries and 2 beers was $45!), it's entirely worth it!",crg97ztpsfvf6VQ0y8Nx1A,29,34,5,GoUuSgUGYiIzTKTKQENxZw

Otherwise, the burgers are small, needed a pinch of salt and EXPENSIVE fow what it's worth. A burger alone will cost you close to $10. The food is good so I suggest it's worth trying for the first time it.",V7GuMxOo_RF39_MRKYoL5Q,0,0,4,_J_kgykTAb-RXJnN2eF1ag

The line was long as hell, but it dwindled in size fast:) The place was clean and the cheese fries, burgers & shakes were all really yummy. My family and I didn't care for the bacon and cheese fries, though, as we felt the bacon over powered the taste of the cheese and fries.",qkwHQEuHIZNJyWhUMEMeSA,0,0,4,qKUn-f14eswqJMatw6qy_A

For those vegetarians who can't eat mushrooms, the cheese sandwich is pathetic. I asked for a cheeseburger without meat, what I got was a horrible grilled cheese sandwich with a cooked piece of lettuce and thin slice of tomato, no sauce. They should go on a field trip to In N Out to see what freshness looks and tastes like (I have included a picture of an In N Out Grilled cheese for reference). As well their shakes are nothing special, despite being part of their name.",4M3KNM28yq6RdLyO_Pc-nQ,0,0,2,Zdk5oE_5q6mXkdXHgaPADg
