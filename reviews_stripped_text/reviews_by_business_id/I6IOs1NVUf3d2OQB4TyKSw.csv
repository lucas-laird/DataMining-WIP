I ordered a meal and the total came out to $24.75, which is also what I was told over the phone when I was placing my order. I went to pick up my meal. Then I got home and thought nothing of it. Now mind you, I have push notifications enabled on my bank app on my phone that shows me what I recently spent my money on. I saw that BaBa's Kitchen charged me $29.70 for that meal. I decided not to go up there and raise hell over the five measily dollars that they overcharged me. I'll just withdraw my services from them entirely and never order from them again. They just lost a customer. Hope it was worth the $5 stupid dollars.",VDLOQYIE8qH6NTsi7mxZkA,3,3,2,Mijp1CrYC-fnSx5L7zIC8Q

The food is 6/10 average, I would recommend a bit more spices on the chow fun and the Kung pao chicken wasn't that spicy. Let me tell you, sriracha would kick it up a bit.",qQxpmxc9wM8qzzKHtiUgJg,2,1,3,oTmh-Sak4qiD0U7xxznj0g

The egg flower soup is orange and tastes like water. We ordered 1 chicken and 1 beef dish and orange chicken. The textures of the meats were so odd, they don't even seem like meat. Who knows what they have been soaked in! The orange chicken was dry, no sauce what so ever. Worst Chinese food ever!",TXUOaWtNvuBBk56tTvVY2Q,0,0,1,RK9vL7b7kKjmAVwH2_nJ0w
