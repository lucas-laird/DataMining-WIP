Well obviously the people in this area have no taste buds cuz the food was trash, slop, garbage. I ordered the garlic shrimp which was suppose to be spicy...wasnt spicy, was slimy, and the sauce was gray, the noodles were chewy and tasteless, they tasted stale, and the bell peppers in the shrimp had big chunks that had rotten spots on them....gag! To top it off we arrived at about a quarter to 3pm...the menu said lunch prices until 4pm. We ended up paying almost $20 for two which should have been about $15 according to what we ordered. Not sure if there is waiter service or not because as soon as we walked in the door a toothless man in a filthy white shirt handed us menus so we sat down. Then a woman comes and takes our order. She brought us our food and drinks. Turned out toothless man was the cook. I had a view of the kitchen and noticed rivers of water running down the walls over his cooking area.  I want to throw up after just a few bites of each thing...if ever in las vegas DO NOT EAT AT CHINA JOE'S. Contemplating calling the health department if I am sick tomorrow. We eat alot of chinese food and this is the worst in my whole life.",onwuDaxErEJXbN0Y5yVanw,2,0,1,hp3ehL3D9Ryt_9jOM8zYrA

1737362,2013-04-26,0,ZTCKRVCjdcb2eS_-260O2A,We have ordered from this place several times and the food has been great every time.  We really feel the dinner for two meal combo is the best bang for your buck and they allow me to substitute my curry chicken in there.  Being in Centennial and not having much to choose from around here....I think it's a great option for Chinese food.  And the delivery time has always been pretty standard--usually 30-45 minutes.,0YrC_H_8WrfulHJbeKqrNw,0,0,4,2O9-1e_ldYaF3ONJo-CkFg
