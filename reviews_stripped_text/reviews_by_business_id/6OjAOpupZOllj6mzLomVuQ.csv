Decided to eat here, after the movie, cause I was running kind of late and didn't want to miss the previews. But after the movie, didn't want to go around the concession stands just to get food to bring home. So decided to hit up the food court and eat there before going home.  So I stopped at Panda Express, since its probably the only thing that actually look good there. 

First off, it seems like the person behind the counter, really didn't want to serve me or talk to the cook, till I creep close enough to be looking over the counter. Got myself some Chow Mien, Honey Walnut Shrimp and Beijing beef. Kind of wondering, why isn't it on a tray or something.  Basically I just had a plate to carry around. I gave her a 20, and she gave me my  change, and when I looked up, she disappeared. That's probably the only thing I didn't like about this Panda Express. 

The food on the other hand, is edible, but I was really hungry, that I just ate it. It was decent, I don't have any gurgling sound in my tummy, so I guess it wasn't to greasy. So, I give the food a thumbs up. 

Over all, I just gave this an OK rating, cause I think the customer service could of been much better, but the food on the other hand, made up for it.",VsL7I-dRjo4eToDC7Un_3Q,1,1,3,QmdzSUXIREAQnbyRodVrZQ
