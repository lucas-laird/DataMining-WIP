It was very difficult to understand the waitress, but I was there for the experience and I got it!!! The location and ambiance was little to be desired.... I would eat Ethiopian food again as long as I have a groupon... Food was good, just the atmosphere would be the reason I might not go back.... But, maybe I would....

So many REALLY good Ethiopian restaurants in Las Vegas.

Menu ... well, they only brought half of it. When asked for some traditional dishes, I was looked at very strange. Then she brought the other menu with what I was looking for. Prices did not make much sense and portion compared to the price was not good.  Also, asked for NO SPICE - it was loaded with jalapenos. Hmmmmm.

I could get over a lot of this, but I was using a Groupon and they tried mis-charging me.

Then, the biggest problem ... there is no way the dining area or bathroom would pass any health inspection ... very dirty! Like it was never cleaned - ever.

This is in the location of the original Viva Mercado.

Oh yeah, they wanted to charge me a $1 service charge for using a credit card.  Really?",US5TnFHzeZLWHgwzArQJrw,2,0,2,H2ntS22lqWuvQxiPw4Lx4g

I wasn't sure what to expect when I first went to Jolly Bar. I had never had Ethiopian food before. So, I wasn't exactly sure how to eat the food when they brought it out--the meat with the flat, spongy bread (injera). Well, it turns out you just scoop up the meat dish with the injera. The food was decent and it is worth trying. If you're thinking about trying something new and being adventurous, I recommend this place. It will open your taste buds up to new flavors and new styles of food!",zRGtyW374pq0fNGcc-yTNQ,0,0,3,FsEplyIXWOl_RhO5jyJnkw
2042047,2015-07-06,0,dgseqfpjVGR7TkEee3LZtQ,"I was looking forward to trying this restaurant, as I enjoy the spices and veggie dishes from this part of the world. Had this been my first exposure, however, I would never eat anything Ethiopan again. The food, at best, was marginal. From the small size of the servings, I suspect they knew it wasn't worth the bother to eat. I'm not sure where or when these other pictures were taken by other commenters, but our platter, for three people, was better suited for two light eaters. After spending $75 for the meal (with one water, one iced tea, and a soda), we were all ready to eat again an hour later. For two vegetarians and one omnivore, there were three scoops of vegetables and another three scoops of some sort of meat. The portions looked like they used a single serving-spoon for each item. I don't mind Third World portions if they are Third World priced, but those two aspects were grossly disproportionate.

The d√©cor was rather tired and looked like it never really had a prime to be past. Perhaps that was intended to help convey the feel of economy where the food originated - not sure.

The wait staff was pleasant, but it would've been a plus if she had a better command of the English language, at least to the extent that she was clear on the difference between 'meat' and 'vegetable'.

Anyway, if you're one of the people that wrote or was influenced by the more positive reviews, rest assured you will never have to wait behind me for a table.",fCD13Qiq0LUTF8yMCS71qA,1,0,1,8naLRudrA2vfcAlqWDpxMw
2556290,2015-04-06,0,dgseqfpjVGR7TkEee3LZtQ,"My rating is based off of the food that me and my gf ate. This is our 4th time at an Ethiopian place and this place had the best tasting platters. We ordered the veggie and the meat sampling plates with a lot of injera bread. We also ordered an extra order of beef tibs? I can't remember the exact name but the waitress said it was their special and it was DELICIOUS! Food was very good quality and it looks like this was a soft opening. 

Yes it was a bit expensive but we used the groupon and paid $36 before tip but we got A LOT of food. Eating at other Ethiopian places, they all seemed to cost around the same prices and they were all expensive so it wasn't like this place was especially costly.

It is located in an area that was a bit questionable. Not the best looking shopping center but don't let that deter you from eating here",mfLzwoOJsyEUSyawg1fRRw,1,0,5,d06nZy1vc2JKdO5mo98d3A

We came here for lunch one day to use the groupon deal and it was well worth the price we paid for the voucher. They offer very large portions and the food is very unique and delicious. We ordered 2 of the lunch combo specials under our waitress' recommendation. The menu is extensive and since I'm not too familiar with Ethiopian food, it was nice for her to explain what some of the items are and recommend the combo which contained a little bit of everything. 

We didn't wait too long before our drinks and food came out, it was a huge plate of pure goodness, lots of different things to try and the flavors were so unique and explosive. We shared some of the meat dishes like the lamb and beef. 

The service was a bit lacking and the restaurant smell like smoke, so minus 1 star. The bathrooms are reasonably clean.",8ZryN_S-n48g6rsa3W3QtQ,28,28,4,UoLUUuJqt15H1Vk8J2B6_w

4088129,2015-03-29,0,dgseqfpjVGR7TkEee3LZtQ,"Found a Groupon for this place and decided to get it so we can check it out. The only Ethiopian place we knew of was Merkato. 

Environment: Low light, small and cozy. I like that they have booths on the side so it's almost private in a way. People aren't staring at you. 

Service: Not too bad. Had more service compared to Merkato in that the 2 waitresses stopped by a few times to see if we liked our food. Our main waitress was a younger lady who didn't speak English all to well so I would usually look at the other lady since she spoke more fluently. They were super nice but the young waitress was a bit slow and forgot to get us water when we asked. 

Food: I will have to say it is not bad at all. We ordered Sambusa, Zil Zil Tibs, meat combo and ayib cheese. They ran out of Sambusa so I asked if there were other appetizers that were good but I don't think she understood. She ended up brining out these mini Sambusa, so it looked as if the chef made some mini ones real quick. It was good. Their injera to me isn't all that great. Compared to Merkato's, it doesn't have a hint of sourdough flavor, it's a bit soft and breaks easily. It's more bland which is good too but I like Merkato's better. 

Price: compared to Merkato it is very expensive. For the meat combo it was $18, for Zil Zil Tibs it's $19, for their ""electric tea"" which is basically a hot Lipton bag tea it was $2.50, a water bottle was $1.50, maybe half cup of ayib cheese was $5, extra injera cost $5 so the whole bill ended up being $54. They didn't charge for the Sambusa so that saved us a few bucks. 

Hours: There is no place that states their hours, not even their website. When we got there, we saw it and it looks like they are open 7 days/week from 11am-2am.",ZF-1QU2jweLa59a5gYQptA,2,0,4,RxbVA5Wq5sZfK1kp3tRv7Q

5123008,2015-02-15,6,dgseqfpjVGR7TkEee3LZtQ,"I love trying exotic cuisine (and have tried it all) so I was eager to check Ethiopian off the bucket list. 

Sadly, this was the biggest ripoff in my 5 years living in Vegas. 

I got a beef and onion/jalapeno dish for about $18 that had about as much meat as you'd expect to find in a carne asada taco.

The remaining 2 dishes ($16 a piece) were a spicy and mild curry type and were supposedly lamb dishes, but there was no lamb meat whatsoever, just bone parts and fragments and fat that I  had to keep spitting out onto a napkin. You'd find more lamb meat in one spoonful of any lamb dish in any Indian restaurant in town than I did in the entire disgusting bowl of ""curry"" which just tasted like sauce out of a can.

They top off your dining experience by giving you a cold flavorless nasty flat spongy bread to dip in the dishes that wasn't made fresh and came out of the fridge...imagine a soggy tasteless flat sponge that is about 50 degrees that you have to dip into a much warmer sauce and eat...giving someone a pre-made cold one to make the hot food cold lacks any culinary common sense....do Indian restaurants give you naan that's been sitting in a fridge to dip in your curry. No...and the fact that it is moist and spongy means the thing wouldn't even adjust to room temperature...it just remained a cold mess.

Another joke of the evening was the absence of a drink menu. So we just asked for iced water...not here...$2 bottled watered for a $4 total to wash down this nasty meal.

They could see by our unused soggy cold sponge and all the fat and bones I had to pick out of the sauce that we weren't too thrilled with our meal...that is when the added fun started. The 2 of us were tacked on 18% gratuity!!! Isn't that against the law? The worst meal of my life came to $65 with tax and I was going to leave $5 because we left hungry and were really upset at what we were given for such a high price...and we weren't even allowed to decide our own tip...THEY decided how much we should have enjoyed their meal and service.

They are a new business and I didn't want to slam a new business so early on yelp but the fact that we ate Wendy's an hour later due to still being hungry and that 18% added gratuity for a table of 2 still left me with a bitter taste (aside from the food) a couple days later..
