If you, on the other hand, want to be in shellfish heaven with a little H-E double hockey sticks or want to live on the wild side, then this is the place for you. 

New Year's Day was about to be over. My parents, siblings along with their families, a few friends and I decided to eat dinner at this place after a day of playing in the snow and falling on my big behind! We waited for a about 5 minutes before we were seated and 2 servers quickly asked us what we wanted to drink and put our bib on (see my profile pic).  We first ordered our bottomless (free refills) then another server took our main orders. Their menu mainly consisted of shellfish, poultry and fish. We ordered the following :

1 lb. Crawfish
1 lb. Shrimp 
1 lb. Clams 
3 lbs king crab legs
catfish and chips basket (chips = cajun fries)
chicken nuggets and fries basket
gumbo (for my dad)

Everything came in a plastic bag drenched in mild shabang sauce which is a combo of all their available sauces and it was all DELICIOUS if you're a shellfish afficionado like myself. The mild shabang sauce had a kick which is perfect when paired with a hot side order of rice ( I think I ordered 2 sides of rice!). Throw the rice in the plastic bag with the leftover sauce after eating all that shellfish goodness or drizzle some over your rice bowl as you eat them shellfish. Either way, your taste buds & mouth will thank you!

The only down side is the price is on the high side and customer service is not bad but not very good either. Nonetheless, I can't wait to go back there when I go back to Vegas!!!",uAFG11WgN0Q1KGtldW68IA,3,2,4,Jj8Fx0bdBss8-yGMGTIbUg

Man was I looking forward to this ... But nope I came out pretty disappointed, first of all they're very unorganized, the waiters/waitress aren't as attentive as they should be, my gf asked for ranch for her chicken tenders they never brought it she had to get up and ask for it at the counter also for some lime since they didn't bother to stop by and ask if everything was well or if we needed anything. We ordered a Corn on the cob along with everything else we originally ordered & we never received it so once I received my bill I noticed they were still charging for the corn on the cob so I politely told the girl if she could remove it of my bill because we didn't receive it & she asked me if I had asked anyone about it ? & of course I could have asked any of the other waiters  but that's why you took my order down, right? & even if we had asked anyone else it's not like they were coming by our table. The food wasn't any better, my two pounds of shrimp were over cooked they were real rubbery and hard to chew, my Cajun fries were hardly seasoned it looked like a splash of the seasoning was thrown on one spot only and the rest of the fries were plain, my girlfriends chicken tenders looked like they were battered and thrown in the microwave to heat up , they were so Mushy !! Another thing I noticed is they take forever to get a table cleaned up, at previous boiling crabs I've been too as soon as the guest leaves the waiters are on it and get the table cleaned up it takes them no more than 3-5 mins to get it cleaned and seat the next guest. These waiters it took them about 10 mins just to get started on cleaning a table, and there's no excuse to say it's because they're busy there was more than enough staff to help half of them were slacking around just walking around. I was really disappointed when I came here I was looking forward to it but came out home sick lol I'm never coming back here again and for those Los Angeles or South Bay residents If you've had boiling crab back home don't come here unless you want to leave disappointed!

128517,2012-11-06,0,zcScEL0WEdFkROcnz5379g,"Last winter, my friends asked me if I wanted Boiling Crab and I was shocked to think that they'd go so far for it. Apparently, while I was away for college, a location sprouted up in Vegas as I enjoyed the shrimp from its SoCal counterparts. Right, duh, I knew that.

Fast forward about eight months later, we finally put on our bibs and started peeling shrimp. Got my usual order of one pound of shrimp with the whole shabang of seasonings and XXX for the heat. Perhaps my tolerance for heat and spices went up, but the XXX seemed really tame! I also love eating the chunks of cooked garlic in between preparing my next seafood sacrifice. Their Cajun fries are seasoned well like their marine friends, and their sweet potato fries also make great accompaniments.

Considering it was a late afternoon lunch and didn't seem that busy, I thought the service was lacking a bit. It took a while to flag down the waiter for water then the bill. I've had more attentive service at busier Boiling Crabs that were practically overflowing with people.

I love boiling crab but the Las Vegas location, not so much. 

I come with my girlfriend often and we always have rude servers. Maybe because we are younger they think we aren't good tippers. I've had several rude hosts, and the one time it was decent was when I brought my family. That's just rude that it has to be that way. I am a great tipper but the servers didn't get much from me and I hate not tipping.

When I order the shrimp there's barely any sauce in there!! Over in California for all the bags is just about halfway full if not all the way to give it some flavor. 
Lacking on the sauce!
Lacking on the service!

We went here and to hot n juicy (competitor)--a few major difference that really made one enjoyable and one not so much, we went to HJ first then were told by a few people that boiling crab was a LOT better....well they were a LOT wrong.

Service was 10x better at the other place

Calamari was 100x better at boiling crab

Shrimp were 100x better at other place (all different small sizes at bc, exact opposite at hj)

Clams were 10x better at boiling crab

Mussels were 100x better at other place


We requested extra sauce on the side and we didnt mind paying, they said no they wont do it....REALLY? Pour some sauce in a styro cup and take our effing money!!! what the hell....other place offered to do it, we didnt even have to ask.

Other place sells bread to dip into the sauce, this place will tell u to bring ur own or go buy it from the market next door....REALLY? I am about to set up a bread van outside on the weekend and sell it by the loaf.

This place used to charge .25c for a cup of water....seriously? People go in there spending a minimum of $10/lb on multiple pounds, and you want to charge the people 25 fricken cents for water?!?!?!?! unbelievable.


overall the service was a big factor, it wasnt nearly as good as the other place. The food was ok, maybe even a better sauce, but not enough to sway me. Other place is 5 stars.",2oF_oHcerMolLL6jlO-aDA,0,0,3,dcmaQZhv8eaKptO8B4hZKQ

I heard about this place from my cousins in California and recently found out that we have one out here in Vegas. We decided to go here for fathers day dinner and were in for a treat.

The menu was small but it was your basics for seafood. A few varieties of crab to choose from, shrimp, crawfish, oysters, catfish, and for those that don't like seafood they had chicken fingers. What makes it yummy is the options you have for seasonings. I went with the whole shabang for my crawfish and was in heaven. We also ordered fried and raw oysters. I've never had fried oysters so I wasn't sure if I'd like it. As soon as we got the order I tried the fried oyster and it was sooooooooo good. It just melts in your mouth :)

Came here on a whim because the wife wanted to compare it to hot and juicy.   Turns out it may just end up being my goto Cajon seafood joint. 

The menu is eerily similar to hot n juicy,  except they round up to whole jumpers.   Makes eyeballing the bill a little easier I suppose.   The sauces they use are excellent -  medium has a ton of flavor but not overly spicy. Even though the sauce is probably still butter based it doesn't come off as greasy, seems like more powder ends up on your hands than butter.   Makes cleanup a little easier since they don't carry gloves..

Ended up with 4lbs of food - shrimp,  clams, snow crab legs, and crawfish.   All the seafood was insanely fresh, and nothing was soggy.   Crab legs were tight and juicy, made us want to order more.   But it was a ton of food as is.  

Still trash bag covered table,  still served in plastic baggies,  but i really enjoyed the food.   Restaurant is a bit bigger and there are way more tvs to watch while you eat - plus it's cooler with all the overhead fans and ac on full blast.   Great for summertime seafood fun.

841199,2011-11-10,2,zcScEL0WEdFkROcnz5379g,"As a Los Angeles transplant living in Las Vegas, I can honestly say that if there's anything I miss most about home, it's Boiling Crab.  Granted, home is only a three+ hour drive away, but when the shabang cravings kick in, life is unbearable.

Ever since they put on their website that a Vegas location was opening soon, I kept counting down the days 'til I'd be reunited with all the goodness that is BC.  My friends (also California natives) and I screamed with joy as we saw that familiar red neon sign that read, ""Lousiana Crawfish"".  I could not stop giggling.

And sure enough, from the moment we walked in, it was like we were home again.  This particular location reminds me a bit of the Rowland location with booths and open areas; but Vegas' open dining area is REALLY big.  It almost felt like a cafeteria.  Lucky for us, we were seated at a booth so we could catch the Eagles/Bears game.  I was tripping out.  I could not believe that I was going to have Boiling Crab in Vegas.

The girls and I knew what we wanted to order ahead of time, and we wasted no time so as to get our food faster:

- 1lb. shrimp shabang non-spicy
- 2lbs. shrimp shabang medium
- 1lb. clams shabang medium
- gumbo w/ rice
- catfish w/ mild cajun fries

We figured that if we tried a little bit of everything, we'd be able to make a fair assessment and compare it to the BC's back home.

VEGAS DOES NOT DISAPPOINT.  All the garlicky goodness of that red shabang sauce was just how I remembered it.  Note: The shabang was really limey in flavor, but I actually enjoyed that better because I didn't have to waste my time squeezing all those tiny limes onto my shrimp.  so nice that the lime essence was magically incorporated in already.  The consistency of the shabang sauce was not as grainy and pasty as I'm used to, but all the right flavors were still there.

Shrimp -- One of my friend's bag was overcooked, but the other friend and I had no complaints about our's.  The medium could have been a bit spicier (since I remember medium being really really spicy), but it was still yummy as ever.

Clams -- Sooo good.  Most of the clam meat fell out of the shells, but that made it taste even better since direct contact with shabang is always best.

Fries -- perfectly cooked; not too spicy.  And not oily at all.

Catfish -- HOLY MOLY.  Flaky and fresh.  It tastes best when you dip it in both ketchup and the tartar sauce.

Gumbo -- Perfectly seasoned AND they had more okra than the Alhambra locations.  My only issue with the gumbo was that there wasn't enough rice or shredded crab bits, but it still rocked my socks.

I tried really hard not to cry, but when food is this good, how can you not tear up a little?  Especially when it's something that reminds me of home -- football games on Sundays, drinking Coronas while you wait for food, good company, friendly service.  Restaurant perfection at its finest.

And I have to address the wait staff.  Although it looked like the place was over-staffed (perhaps preparing for the influx of crazy California transplants like me), the service was awesome as usual.  Everyone was really attentive, super nice, and kept refilling our drinks without our asking even once.

The best part is that when I got home, even though I knew I would reek of shabang goodness, my clothes didn't smell that bad.  Maybe it's because this location is larger and the air circulates better, but that was a change from the places back home haha.  Although as word spreads and it gets more business, I would still recommend wearing casual clothes you don't mind messing up.  Sometime that one shrimp shell misses your bib by a smidgen and you'll wish you hadn't worn your club clothes or taken a first date here.

My only regret is that I didn't bring a Sharpie to commemorate one of the happiest days of my life ... but I'll definitely be back again and again :)

--- one more thing.  I have nothing against Hot 'n' Juicy; but, for all you Vegas natives who have never had Boiling Crab ... I guarantee you'll never see Hot 'n' Juicy the same way again.  BC will always be the one to beat.  (at least in terms of cajun seafood restaurants in areas with a high concentration of Asians)",ur4Xu3hUHB7BR98wS82ACQ,7,4,5,rsNoO3qmtap2LPW6v0_3Nw

After all of the rave reviews that I've read & heard about from friends, I decided to give the Boiling Crab a try. My first visit to Hot & Juicy was literally 2 weeks ago, so despite my typical high alcohol intake, the experience was still fresh in my mind.

Like Hot & Juicy, a friend & I also visited Boiling Crab on a Friday night. The place is pretty big, with TVs all around. STRIKE 1: It wasn't crowded (or @ full capacity) and the wait was minimal (7-10 mins). That shoulda been a sign to get in our cars & drive up the street to Hot & Juicy, but it wouldn't have been fair to leave without even walking inside, right? 

STRIKE 2: The server was ok, but he definitely wasn't as fun or friendly as any other servers I had recently encountered. I ordered shrimp & crabs @ XXX spice level, with the whole shabang (Cajun, lemon pepper, & garlic sauce). My friend ordered fried calamari & crawfish @ medium spice level w/the whole shabang. 

Anyone who knows me (or has read any of my reviews) knows that alcohol is always an important part of my meals. As usual, I had already indulged in some vino before we arrived and was hoping to keep the party going by keeping the liquor flowing. STRIKE 3: This place only sells beer. No wine! I asked if we could bring in a bottle & have them uncork it for us, but that wasn't an option either.  I'm not a big beer drinker so I think I opted for raspberry ice tea instead. I was obviously already tipsy cuz I hate iced tea! What the heck was I thinking? The goal is to continue the buzz, not kill it! Why was I even still there after 3 strikes? 3 strikes & you're out, right? Blame it on the al-al-al-al-co-alcohol! 

Anyway, food finally comes out & in my opinion, it was just ok. The shrimp didn't seem as fresh (one should not have to fight w/the fishies @ the table) as those @ Hot & Juicy and the seasoning is nowhere near as savory! My friend said the calamari was dry & the crawfish was also just ok. Don't remember what kind of crab we got, so it was obviously forgettable.

Needless to say, I was pretty disappointed and haven't decided if I would even visit any of the other locations to make a comparison. Granted, I had an amazing time @ Hot & Juicy during my initial visit, so it would be difficult for any other place to add up in comparison.

My advice is to run like the wind to Hot & Juicy Crawfish where you can get fantastic food, fabulous service, & vino to go with your meal!",nvTztDIiDJJ8JS3HTlu2PA,1,1,2,VKpGsJYRzDswYbbpLW37zQ

SERVICE:
Our server was Nadia who upon delivering our drinks accidentally spilled them as she took one off. Accidents happen, but she didn't offer to get a new beer which OBVIOUSLY doesn't come with a refill like the other drink did. Now we aren't going to beg for a new drink but the person who had ordered it had asked for another beer which she charged. I mean if you accidentally spill all over your customers table it's nice to offer to get your customers new drinks that are actually full.

Less than halfway through the meal Nadia came back to tell us she was going on her break and that someone else would come to check on us. She asked if we needed anything and at the time we didn't. Maybe ten minutes after a male server came to see if we needed anything, which we did not but that was the LAST time anyone came to check on us. 

We were constantly overlooked in the corner booth and had to actually get up and go to the front to get the bill. 

FOOD:
I wasn't going to let the service put a damper on my experience with the food. We ordered oysters, crab, clams, crawfish and fries. I will not lie. The food was AMAZING!!! A lot better than Hot & Juicy Crawfish.

The price is also reasonable for what you are getting which is seafood, definitely will not break the bank. The service was good and the ambience was great specially for groups or two people if that is your choice.

1132085,2011-11-16,8,zcScEL0WEdFkROcnz5379g,"All you California natives, the ""Boiling Crab"" has made its mark here in Sin City. Conveniently located central of Las Vegas (Decatur/Flamingo), inside the Food-4-Less plaza. 

After reading reviews of the other crab/shrimp competitor, Hot N Juicy, it's amazing how many yelpers mentioned Boiling Crab. I personally have not been to the Boiling Crab before, they don't have a spot where I'm from in SD. So what better way to break bread with a bunch of other fellow yelp heads! Representin' from SD. SJ. SF & LBC! 

Honestly, I could not really tell you the difference. Boiling Crab's name of the flavors are titled differently than HnJ, pretty much the same mix. The WHOLE SHA-BANG is the most popular seasoning, which has rajun cajun, lemon pepper, and garlic butter all mixed in together. On spice level, they have plain (simple), mild (just a kick), medium (gettin' hot in here), and XXX (can't feel my mouth!).  

I love shrimp and spicy food. So I ordered the ""1 lb. shrimp whole sha-bang xxx!"" At first, I hesitated a little on picking XXX for spice level, but I liked it! You can definitely taste and feel the spiciness... and the slight burning sensation on your lips. Did not even break a sweat. Poor Eman S. sampled my food and was literally choking and gulped down a glass of water. yikes sorry! And Aljamin S. was already sweating profusely with just the Medium! 

What I give the most stars is for the atmosphere & service. It blows HnJ out of the water. Its SPACIOUS to accommodate really large groups, no wait, customer service was on point, there's practically 100 TV's in the restaurant to watch the sports, and then have the capability of drawing/tagging on there walls! Pretty cool. See photos! 

Only down fall, is they charge 25 cents for water even refills and 50 cents for ranch sauce. What the? Overall, good stuff. I'd come back again.",8NPnK5h5Te91Ot6nbX9a5g,16,12,4,IdzH025j85F7i_rZoR3wUA

We ordered the sha bang which is a mix of all the sauces.  We had half in no spicy and the other medium, as we can all handle a different level of spice.  For myself I have a pretty high tolerance for spice, so I really enjoyed it, even though I'm not much of a seafood person.  The sauce is just AMAZING!!!  Some of the other girls wasn't really a fan.  If you can't handle the spicy and don't like to work for your food then crawfish may not be the right thing for you.  

We did also order the shrimp, clams and catfish.  The catfish was great with the side of cajun fries, it was a great alternative for the girls who didn't enjoy the crawfish.

on the other hand, our shrimp order is a bit weird. I could tell the freshness is different in each bag. I had no idea but the other bag is fishy and spoiled (very much!).

2lbs Shrimp
2lbs King Crab 
1lb Sausage
4 Corn on the Cob
2 Potatoes (6 pcs.)
2 Steamed Rice

We went with the Whole Sha-Bang (Cajun, Garlic, Lemon Pepper) flavor Mild. The Mild flavor still has a slight kick to it and I've been told that the Medium is fairly spicy. In any event, you can pass the time waiting for your order to come out by squeezing the limes into the salt-pepper cups creating a refreshingly tasty dipping sauce. The service is spot on as the bags of seafood and side orders are delivered efficiently to the table. 

Once the food arrives, roll up your sleeves and go at it with your hands! For the seafood, I would recommend dipping it back into the bag for additional flavor and alternating with the lime-salt-pepper dipping sauce. The king crab had to be the table favorite. The rice, potatoes and corn provide a nice balance to the flavors of the Whole Sha-Bang. The sausage also provides a nice change of pace to the seafood. 

Overall, I really enjoyed being able to get down and dirty with my food even as far as eating the rice with my hands. This place has definitely gotten my attention and has snuck into my ""must have"" list when I visit vegas!",f2bmogzk7JMhZd84j4Umsg,3,0,5,0cq0Wx8Pvuzqc7xYhlIq1g

The crab is fine, the sides are meh, but what inspired this review was the shockingly blatant racism my party was met with.

Then the black half of our party arrived the entire evening changed. Suddenly we could no longer get our drink orders, our sides, even a simple request for drawn butter somehow turned into a major production requiring lengthy waits and excuses

The food is also delicious... same concept as Hot n' Juicy, where you choose your flavor, spice level, then seafood of choice plus add-ons -- then feast on the table with cute plastic bibs and get messy! I usually get the WHOLE SHABANG flavor with a POUND OF SHRIMP, with a few corn on the cobs (which is a must!) Never disappoints. We also ordered the KING CRAB... a little pricy, but a lot of meat!

I've been here a few times before, and usually I have no complaints. But my recent visit definitely left me with a few qualms. First of all, our waitress was just overall impatient. Yes, it was busy, but nonetheless, impatient. We made a few requests, such as an extra bottle of ketchup (which seemed to annoy her), for vinegar to eat with the crab legs (which seemed to annoy her more) that they didn't carry anyway... then when I received my drink, I ordered an unsweetened ice tea, I had to ask for sweetener which took 5 minutes to arrive. I added two packets of sweet n' low, only to find my tea was already a sweetened raspberry tea. When I brought this to her attention, her annoyance level went through the roof. No apology or anything. At this point, we were already getting uncomfortable. After that, her service became minimal -- to where she didn't check up on us or give us refills, unless we flagged her down. 

The food was amazing, but I haven't had service that bad in a while. Considering this was also my birthday dinner too, it was quite a disappointment.

Finally have a Boiling Crab in Vegas!! Coming from the neighborhood of where Boiling Crab came from, this Boiling Crab tastes exactly the same. :] So here are my recommendations for you first timers:

1. SHRIMP: (best bang for your buck) and get it in the WHOLE SHABANG (cajun style sauce). Remember to make your lemon juice, salt and pepper sauce so you can dip the shrimp in. 

2. CORN: may be small but it'll help you feel better that you ate some veggies and it tastes great. 

3. SWEET POTATO FRIES: sweet, golden crispy fries... so good. 

Yes, you don't need to buy that $$$crab just because it says it in the name of the restaurant. Just go for the shrimp and a great/messy time eating. :] YUMMIES!! Awesome, young service. You wont regret it.

Walked in and had no troubles waiting for a table and was sat right away. Laid down their signature table cover and was handed our big baby bibs. 

This was our order:
2 Fried Catfish baskets - (4/5) would have been a full five stars if they were hot. Our friends said their basket felt ""warm"" not ""hot"" usually an indicator that the basket was sitting in the window for some time rather than being served immediately. But no MAJOR issue, will delicious & the fries were still delicious as always.
1.5 lb Shrimp, Whole Shebang flavor Mild - (5/5) Can't go wrong with the shrimp. Bag was steaming when we opened it & tasted so juicy & delicious!
1/2 lb sausage, whole shebang flavor mild - (5/5) I, PERSONALLY, wasn't a fan of the sausage because it was too salty for my liking especially w/ the sauce.. but aside from that everyone else at our table ate it up. The server asked if we would like the sausage and shrimp to be separate, which we did.. but there's also an option to put it in the same bag as the shrimp.
3 corn in butter - (5/5) Also have the option to mix it with your seafood or have it separate, and also can do any of the house sauces with the corn. Corn was sweet and a good palette cleanser from all the flavors.
1 lb of mussels, whole shebang sauce mild - This was probably the highlight of the meal! Haven't had mussels here & wow, the sauce and mussels was so good. Props to our friend for recommending it. Wouldn't have ordered it otherwise! 

Typical sides: Rice, tartar sauce & ketchup for the fried baskets, & something I never thought of: salt & pepper with lime. Maybe I'm a newbie at this but, ask the server for this & they'll bring out salt & pepper in containers with limes. Squeeze the juice of the limes into the sauce containers & dip your seafood. So good!

The menu is small and pretty straight forward.  All the items listed as market price are written on a dry erase board at the counter, which makes sense since the prices constantly changes. Either the claims or shrimp (cant remember which) price is now a $1 more per pound which they tell you right away as you sit down at the table since the menu hasn't been updated with the price change.  No biggie.

The only down fall is there isn't a kid's menu.  Most people this isn't an issue, but it was for us.  At first I was disappointed no kid items but saw a fried shrimp baskets...problem solved.  Well...not so much.  The batter it is fried in is seasoned and gives off a spicy flavor.  I tried one and I thought it was a little spicy, nothing too bad but it can be too much for a child.  Especially if they don't do spicy.  They basket was $10 so we basically paid $10 for a basket of fries.  

I ordered a 1lbs of claims in the whole-shabang mild, hubby got shrimp in the whole-shabang medium.  After a few bites I realized mild was a little more than mild.  It was delicious but my husband tried mine and he said he couldn't tell the difference between his medium and my mild.

*****TIP! The spicy can get pretty spicy so i would try a pound first.
******TIP #2! Corn soaked in CAJUN SPICES will taste so good but will burn so bad.

You know a place is good when people are lined up BEFORE the place opens. We got there at about 1155am on a Saturday & there was already about a dozen other people lined up to get in. 
The staff was young & friendly from the get go & very informative about what everything was on the menu & it's description. The atmosphere is a mixture of picnic tables & sports bar tvs. A nice laid back environment where you can tag up the walls. Very cool atmosphere.
The food is just as good! We got a pound of shrimp in 'the works' sauce which is a combo of 3 of their sauces. The spice of the shrimp is your selection, but apparently from the med to XXX is QUITE the jump. In addition to the shrimp we got sweet potato fries, Cajun fries (which you get a whole basket of), & fried calamari. I'd pass on the calamari as it is typically made bar food which I was pretty bummed about. Everything else was great!
With all the food we ordered & a beer the total came out to $35. You def get your monies worth at this spot. Be prepared to make a mess, it's not for the light hearted that aren't into getting dirty.",lK6vU1_UCK1owB6VEIOZPQ,0,0,5,1W4oPPK_yFNLhlvvo5NuIw

- Shellfish served in bags of hot cajun spices & sauce

I'VE TRIED
- Shrimp in Whole Shebang Medium (8/10)
- King Crab in Whole Shebang Medium (10/10)

Ohhh man! How lucky are you! If you're reading this - there's a good chance you're waiting in line at a Boiling Crab or are driving there. That means you're in the vicinity of a Boiling Crab or are making plans to be in the vicinity of one. All of these situations are so much cooler than mine, because the closest Boiling Crab to me is over 900 miles away! 

If you've never been here, they did a really good job with their menu showing you the 3 steps of ordering. Most of the seafood is market price. You basically 
1) Choose your seafood
2) Choose your sauce
3) Choose your level of spice.

It then comes to you in a big clear plastic bag with whatever shellfish drowning in the sauce of your choice. You have to peel or crack the shells and then eat it. I recommend re-dipping it in the sauce after peeling/cracking. WARNING! The sauce is HOT! Not immediate scalding hot, but probably can't stick your finger in there for more than a second.

It's also good to get fries or something too - because the flavors are intense, and you don't want to start getting accustomed to it. You need to simmer down with the fries or rice, and then shock the system again with the sauce again!

SAUCE: WHOLE SHEBANG
The ""Whole Shebang"" is essentially all of the other 3 sauces combined. You get: Rajun Cajun, Lemon Pepper, and Garlic Sauce all combined into 1.

Seasoning is great! Whatever shellfish you decide to drench in this sauce will get some added seasoning and fill in whatever small gaps might be left by the shellfish alone. If things start getting too salty, eat a few fries to calm things down, and then go for it again!

The flavors are awesome! Honestly, I can taste Rajun Cajun, and I definitely can taste Garlic, but Lemon Pepper is the little squirt in this bunch. There's nothing lemony about any flavor, but if you think hard about it, you can convince yourself that you taste it. The pepper is definitely not going to be individually picked out, since you got enough peppers in the creole seasoning. The garlic is awesome! There's no quenching my lust for garlic, so of course I'd want more, but there're garlic pieces floating around in that sauce sometimes. 

SPICE: MEDIUM
As for spice, I love spicy foods! I wanted to try XXX just to see how bad it was, but I was with 2 people who not only couldn't tolerate spice, but also had long nights of drinking, so they had sour stomachs. So, I had to go one step lower and got Medium. 

Having said all that, Medium ain't really joking around either. The sauce flavors are all so delicious and intensely flavorful that you don't really complain too much about the spice, although I was a little disappointed. Fast forward to the end of the meal, and I was reaching for that glass of water! My lips were burning, and my tongue wasn't exactly reclining on the La Z Boy. This was one of the slowest gradual burns I've ever had, and it gets pretty hot. If Medium got this hot (which is 2nd to hottest), I'm even more curious now as to how bad XXX is! 

SHRIMP
The shrimp should be considered as a ""filler."" Even with the sauce, it starts to get a little boring after a while, but a lb of shrimp will go a long way! Most are cooked right, but there're some that are a little well done, so they're kind of dry and rubbery...which means MOAR SAUS!! If you never had anything else here, and just started on shrimp, I think you'd be perfectly content. The shrimp is pretty clean, but I don't think they really make an effort to de-vein. Since you are actually peeling, nothing's hidden, and you see that line of shrimp poop, and suddenly, you want it a little less. I will say this, though, it is cleaner than other similar types of places I've been to!

KING CRAB
Oh wow! The crab is just awesome. Even by itself, it's great! Perfectly cooked, seasoned well, and they're even pretty meaty! Then you add the sauce, and you just can't get enough! ...and there in lies the problem...market price is quite pricey! 1 lb could be up to $20, but 1 lb would hardly serve as an appetizer! That's why you have to get some shrimp in order to leave full.

BOILING GOLD
I love this place, and you're damn right I'll be back! I just wish it didn't cost so much to eat here. I'd say a person could do 2 lb crab and .5 lb shrimp, plus drinks and sides, and get something like a $60-80 meal! You'll be satisfied, but not as full as you'd expect after dropping that much dough. In any case, pray you win at Vegas (yeah right) and wait in line here with the best of us! Now..if I can only convince them to open one here!",4dk6ki0f4GKpgzAqdupOvw,2,2,5,S1TSSDDfX6FboRMSDplVRg

For the sauce you have the option of choosing the original cajun sauce, garlic or a mix of both. You would then need to choose the level of spiciness for your order and whether you wanted to add any sides to it at an additional cost. 

I had ordered 1lb king crab legs which came to be 3 legs along with my potatoes and corn. It was really good but definitely very messy to eat. I was totally stuffed after the 3 legs and couldnt even finish my potatoes or corn.

So in my short Las Vegas trip, all my dad wanted to eat were oysters and crab. The gushing reviews convinced me to take him here. Less than an hour later, my dad and his wife are eating leftover salmon and rice to make up for a tasteless dinner, while I suffer from daughter guilt. 

The oysters had been previously frozen and defrosted into tasteless oyster-shaped coagulant. The snow crab legs, he and his wife said, were flavorless (despite the garlic sauce dip). The Husband went full fried with oysters, fries and soft shell crab, all of which were middling.

On the upside, we had a great waiter, people were happy to be there, and there are multiple TV screens to distract you from the disappointment that's on the table.

You have to pay 0.50 for water which is weird and you're not able to bring ""outside drinks"" But other than that my boyfriend & I really enjoyed it! 
We ordered 1lb of shrimp, with all of the spices in it and it is delicious when dipped in the juices in the bag and eaten with rice. We also ordered the chicken tenders basket and mild cajun fries. We could have appreciated more spice to our fries, and I wouldn't recommend ordering the chicken tenders basket because the chicken fingers are more like giant chicken nuggets (they dont really have the consistency of real chicken fingers if you know what I mean) 

Also, they don't have any plates or anything so  if you grew up with traditional Filipino families (ie: use hands to eat EVERYTHING) then you'll feel like you're at home.

Crawfish is a nice size esp for the time of season I went. I was shocked that they were as big as they were. The corn that comes in the bag is so sweet, but be careful though, bc if you ordered the spicy crawfish, your mouth will burn from the seasoning that rubbed on the corn. Also, the shrimps are nice and big too. If you want a lot of meat with less work then crawfish, then shrimp is your way to go, but I prefer crawfish.

I've recently decided that I like Boiling Crab over Hot N Juicy.. Although I HATE the lingering garlic, spices and butter smell in your hands and mouth equally!

This place is actually not that garlicky and the smell only last for three days tops! LOL

I always eat shrimp or crab here but this night I actually tried the crawfish-- weird little creatures-- all it's goodness is in the head, then the body has the smallest amount of meat! It was good first try but I prefer my shellfishes to be shrimp or crab!

Concept : Pick how many pounds of shrimp, crawfish, crab or lobster you want to eat. Pick a spice (Rajun Cajun, Lemon Pepper, Garlic Butter and the (recommended) Whole Sha-Bang). You also get a choice of if you want to add sausages (delicious!), corn (goes great with everything) or potatoes! They cook everything up in the spices and serve it in a bag, steamed and ready to serve to a table with nothing but napkins and your drinks!

They also have good sides like rice, fries, and sweet potatoes. 

Other items for the none Cajun peeps would be wings, chicken fingers, oysters, fried oysters, or fried shrimp!

1. Choose your protein. You can order in 1/2 or 1 pound increments. We ordered 2 pounds snow crab and 1/2 pound shrimp. They were out of sausage so unfortunately we didn't get to try any. 

2. Pick your flavor. We chose ""The Whole Sha-bang!"" which is a combination of their other three sauces, Rajun Cajun, Lemon Pepper, and Garlic. 

3. Choose spice level. We went with mild and it was still spicy for me. 

4. Choose extras. They serve a bunch of fried food but we didn't order any. We did add potatoes, corn, and a side of garlic sauce to our order though. 

5. Eat until you can eat no more. All of the food comes out in giant plastic bags filled with the sauce, garlic cloves, and any extras you added. The seafood is piping hot and fresh! The shrimp are whole and still have the heads on but they are oh so delicious.

6. Pay ridiculously low bill. I don't know how but this place is so affordable! Our bill came out to $41 (for the order listed above). Amazing. 

This place blows Joe's Crab Shack out of the water. Lucky for us we live in California and there are THREE Boiling Crab restaurants within 20 minutes of our house. We went again two days after getting back from Vegas.",yTSqig9_dK80tzjgeWW08Q,2,0,5,DT3vKIC0uJJ-LywdLq_4sQ

Came in with a party of 11 and we ordered plenty of items including: shrimp , crawfish & crab (you order by the lb. @ market price) , oysters (9$ for 6 pc. or 15$ for 12 pc.) , fried calamari (10$) , Cajun and sweet potato fries (4$) , etc. I wasn't really a big fan of the crawfish or crab, but I definitely liked the shrimp and oysters. We got our seafood w/ the ""whole sha-bang"" sauce (which is a combo. of their Cajun , lemon pepper & garlic sauce) and w/ medium spice. Medium was still spicy and flavorful :) Everything was super fresh. I also have to mention I had the best fried calamari here. You can actually taste the calamari and not just fried dough. Most people say that the Cajun fries are the best but I preferred their sweet potato fries over the Cajun. Also have to note , one serving of fries was more than enough for a few people. We didn't even finish our fries even though they were delicious.

Our service from our hostess & waiter was great from start to finish :) They split our orders and bills among groups no problem.",qtOCfMTrozmUSHWIcohc6Q,5,5,5,X-AsgzEHITHQX_QJRwGD1g

The place was huge and we had a ten minute wait.  It felt so lively. 
A friend of mine told me I was about to get messy with my food.  Which honestly, didn't seem fun....;  But little did I know...

Food - It was delicious. So I had to eat with my hands and get the sauce all over them.  A little weird at first but I got over it once I tasted the sauce.  The shrimp was wonderful.  I also had the fried catfish with fries which was scrumptious.  

Atmosphere - Very lively.  Also they had TVs everywhere so I may come by for the games every once in a while.

Service - Our server David was very sweet and attentive.  He knew it was my first time so he explained how the menu worked and guided me through out.  He's also very cute and charming.  You can say I have a little crush on him

Price - Seems very affordable.  I recently went to Hot N Juicy, which is pretty much the same style restaurant and their prices are a tad bit higher.  

If I had to pick between Boiling Crab and Hot N Juicy.  I'd pick Boiling Crab in a heart beat.

Me and my brother got 2lbs of snow crab legs, a pound of shrimp, 4 corn, and sweet potato fries!  Both the shrimp and crab were cooked well.  However, the key is in the Cajun sauce that  the shrimp and crab are cooked in.  The flavors were on point!  I preferred shelling the shrimp and crab legs first and then dipping it back into the Cajun sauce. Yum!  We got the medium spice sauce which was actually pretty hot.  The heat builds up over time, so if you're not used to eating hot or spicy food, I would suggest you order the mild version.  The price was a little high as our total bill costed a little over $60 for 2 people.  However,  the quality did match the price.  You definitely get what you pay for.

I've been to a handful of cajun seafood places before, and this is by far my favorite establishment. The food came out shockingly quick, (5-10 minutes?) and everything tasted amazing. I also loved the fact that they give you free limes and salt and pepper seasonings on the side. I've never seen this at any other establishment.

The raw oysters are the freshest and most delicious raw oysters I have ever slurped up. I didn't taste any sediment, and the oyster went down so smooth with no excessive fishy smell/taste. The shrimp was very plump, fresh, and delectable. I got it in the spiciest whole shebang sauce and it surely satisfied my seafood cravings. I almost got a spicy level below, but I'm glad I got the spiciest XXX level. If you love spicy food, and can handle nearly thai hot, but not quite there yet, or even spicier, then trust me, go for the XXX level!

The crawfish was very succulent and fresh and the sweet potato fries are a must order! these are so addicting and perfectly fried and seasoned. I'll admit, I could probably eat a whole basket by myself!

The Fried shrimp basket was not bad, but could be seasoned a bit better and battered a bit differently to make it crispier, however still tasty. The cajun fries that accompanied the shrimp in this basket again, could have been seasoned a bit better but were still tasty.

This is definitely going to be my first stop whenever I visit the west coast again! I love this place! The waitress was also very easy going and friendly about splitting our checks between 6 people!",XiMjphpRsjC4jK8_4jYQtA,2,1,5,WltLM216TYhqOsyT3KxaBg

Boiling Crab has good crab, but I was surprisingly more impressed with their fried dishes. This place always has a wait, even if it goes pretty quick, so plan ahead or go elsewhere if you're in a rush- this isn't fast food.

SHRIMP: Do it right, whole she-bang, with your preferred spice level. Shrimp is my go-to seafood boiling critter, but I've been underwhelmed by overcooked shrimp that is hot but not juicy.. as elsewhere.
SNOW CRAB LEGS: Priced by the pound, sold by the unit, accompanied by tools. Lemon pepper garlic is your best choice, spice it up if you want. We got someone else's order by accident, which was Ragin' Cajun cranked up to hot, and it was surprisingly good. I don't really get why the legs are cooked with seasoning in the bag, as the sauce doesn't penetrate to the meat. Shrug.
FRIED OYSTERS: They were out of the raw option on my visit, so we stuck to fried before I read a tip warning us against them on the app. Good thing I ignored it though, because they were tasty. Maybe they're not consistent?
FRIED CATFISH BASKET: Basket comes with cajun fries, which are thin, hot, and perfectly crisp. The fish comes in 4-5 huge pieces of hot, juicy, flaky fish, served with one single cup of a lightly-flavored tartar sauce. I'd get this again. It's a huge portion for only $10, too.

I'm not a huge fan of the oddly corporate-chain feel of the space but I can't put my finger on what gives me the weird vibe. The food is fresh and it's a fun dining environment, but I have no idea why this place is so popular with H&J in town as a worthy competitor.

TIP: This might be a good spot to watch a game, as there are ~50 TV screens hanging everywhere. But they seem to be showing SD instead of HD, so picture quality isn't great and they don't seem to have any game-day specials. But it's an option to keep in mind if you want to watch your team AND spend time with your family. Plus they have beer.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,19,10,3,WtI-82_5fCOs9zPIJCgwZA

I LOVE boiling crab. 

The first visit I had dungeness crab, corn, potatoes. It was fantastic. 

All other visits I stuck with the shrimp, not because I didn't like the crab, but because the shrimp is a better value and just as tasty. I get either 1 lb or 1.5 lbs add corn and call it good. 

Last time, I got the medium spice level and was told ""it's like an 8 out of 10"". Um. No. It was more like a 2 out of 10. I'm not complaining, though, as it was still tasty, I was just looking forward to more spice. They offered to fix it, but I declined. I was in shrimp grubbing mode by that point. 

Also, the service could use a little help. There were a couple of times we had to ask someone passing by for something because our actual server was nowhere to be found. 

Our last visit there, the table next to us requested to speak with a manager as they were very disappointed and upset with the service, and eventually stormed out. Disappointing, but it happens. 

I think if the service was more streamlined, it might help. Right now someone seats you, someone takes your drink order (and sometimes the same person is your ""waiter""), someone takes your dinner order then another person brings your meal. Honestly, what happened to ONE person taking care of you from start to finish? I think it could improve their service if they had dedicated servers instead of an order taker and a food runner. 

Either way, I'll still go back as I love it, it's adequatetly priced and I've had good experiences there.",sDlRFzGHzfpFHaxvJ1JtTg,0,0,5,6QbkOPrpzjFPJT7WmMGrtw

LOL Totally kidding because compared to Boiling Crab, Hot & Juicy seems Tasteless & Dry! Now, that might be a cause of offense to some people, but in my preference, which I will elaborate on, would be the service and environment of BC! Since it's been established in Las Vegas, they've always been busy! The first time I've had BC was in LA and I told friends from Vegas about it and they told me about H&J! Ever since I've had BC, I've never been back to H&J!

BC has similar food items like H&J! They have the Cajun style seafood with your shrimps, your crawfish, lobster, crab legs, cajun fries and they tailor to your tolerance of spicy! If you're like me, I'm good with ZERO spicy because even medium is spicy for me! Friends who've preferred the Cajun spice to their food have said it isn't spicy at all! Do I know how true that is? No! Will I ever test how hot their spices are? Probably not! If you know the movie starring Ben Stiller and Jennifer Aniston, Along Came Polly, you'll know exactly what spicy food does to me! LOL!

But the reason I give BC a 4-star rating is for the other items on their menu! The fried catfish and cajun fries are TO... DIE... FOR! I ask for extra tartar sauce for extra dipping, limes to drench it in it's juice, and if a friend is kind enough to let u dip some catfish in their Whole Shebang sauce, give them a big hug and be sure to have a few mints on deck cuz the smell of your burps and breath will kick like a mule! More like a pack of mules! They give 4 or 5 HUGE catfish filets along with a medium sized basket of fries (regular and sweet potato fries are also available!). Another addition to BC's already awesome menu is their fried oysters! I'm a huge raw oyster fan, but the fried oysters are just as good!

2059835,2012-01-16,1,zcScEL0WEdFkROcnz5379g,"Short version:
If you like Hot 'n' Juicy Crawfish, but hate the cramped dining room and horrible parking, check out the Boiling Crab. It's like HJC with 4x the dining room space and decent parking.

Long version:
I went here with some friends because I heard of its similarities to HJC, and didn't feel like the crapshoot of getting a table in a decent amount of time or finding parking at HJC. It was 5 of us plus my infant son.

Seating:
We were seated almost immediately, even though the place was almost entirely full. It was a table for 4, with a 5th seat added to one end and a highchair added to the other. Slightly cramped, but we were going to share everything family-style, so no big deal. As is typical with these types of places, the table setting is a plastic sheet with no settings or utensils. Oddly, though, there was a napkin dispenser instead of a roll of paper towels. The napkin dispenser ran out 2/3 of the way through dinner and had to be replaced, and I can't help but think a paper towel roll would've served better.

Food:
We ordered:
2 lbs of shrimp, ""whole shebang"" sauce/medium spice
2 lbs of snow crab legs, one with lemon pepper/medium, one with shebang/mild
2 lbs of king crab legs, cajun spice/mild
1 lb of clams, Shebang/xxx (maximum spicy)
1 order of fried catfish with fries
1 order of sweet potato fries

The shrimp was a great appetizer for the table and a great way to gauge the flavor of the sauce and the level of spice. The shrimp were large, the sauce was very tasty, and it gave us a good baseline for spice levels.

The crab legs were all excellent, although the king crab was definitely the most flavorful. I'd rate the sauces: 1. shebang, 2. cajun, 3. lemon pepper.

The clams were meaty and delicious. The xxx spice level was a nice surprise, as it actually packed a decent punch. As I liked spicy the most at the table, I ended up eating most of these - everyone tried one, and enjoyed the flavor, but most didn't want to deal with that much heat.

I'm not a huge catfish person, but the fried catfish was decent. The sweet potato fries didn't have any extra seasoning, but I preferred them to the cajun fries.

Also, as this type of place serves the food in the bag of sauce, it's messy as all hell. Your hands will smell like seafood for hours afterward, no matter how much you wash. Price you pay for delicious seafood flavor.

Service:
The place was busy, but a few different servers ended up dropping off food and refilling drinks. Overall they were prompt and courteous, although for some reason they served the catfish and fries about 5 minutes after the shrimp and about 10 - 15 minutes before any of the crab or clams. Kind of odd timing on that.

Overall:
Loved the food, loved not having to wait 45 minutes for a table, loved the availability of parking. Will definitely come back.",jhaT21VWZVtW2zXPVmzeyg,1,2,5,13bAh1RE-_e4iSqFFmAwBQ

When I walked into this establishment I was expecting the same quality of service and food as the ones in SoCal. We asked our server the market price of a few items and she did not know them and had to run to the back and ask. She also forgot to give us our bibs after we ordered. So we are off to a rocky start but I dismiss it. Then my food arrived under seasoned and cold. I had to send it back to get it fixed and the manager took care of it. Other than that, the food tasted fine after it was fixed. Throughout the course of my meal I was constantly being interrupted by different servers asking how my meal was and if I needed something to drink. Checking up on a table a few times is reasonable, but 15 times was a little overkill. So unfortunately I was unable to enjoy my meal to its full extent. Ironically, by the end of our meal there was no one around for us to ask for the check and we had to wait a while. Among all the Boiling Crab restaurants I have dined in I'll have to say this particular one did not impress me.

2090573,2012-04-02,0,zcScEL0WEdFkROcnz5379g,"When I'm in the mood for crawfish, my first thought is never Boiling Crab in Garden Grove because I hate the wait and the loudness and the charge for what seems like every little thing. The food itself isn't too bad, but I find it more worth my time and money to go to the Cajun Corner, a bit further down Brookhurst. With that being said, I was still interested in trying the Boiling Crab that opened in Las Vegas. Little naive me was hoping it wouldn't be too bad.

K. and I went on a Wednesday night, and unlike the GG BC, there was no line outside the door. Yay! However there was a short wait, about 10 minutes. However when we were seated, I was able to see that although the restaurant may have had all the tables booked, the booths along the side were deserted. That irked me a little, and also because our hostess was slightly rude. When she sat us down, she didn't even bother to look at us when she was talking to us. She told us the usual, here's your table and your server will be with you shortly, blah blah, but she must've been talking to another table seated behind us, because she sure as heck wasn't looking at us. Or maybe she was, I just couldn't tell underneath the inch-wide layer of eyeliner. Little makeup tip for you sweetie, that look is so 5 years ago. Makeup is supposed to accentuate your features, not hide them. You're wearing it wrong. Moving on...

Our server took a bit long to reach us. I noticed that a family got seated after us, yet they were waited upon before us. That's never cool. But whatever..so I have been to BC before so I know they charge for water, which I personally think is ridiculous, but whatever, so K. and I brought our own water. Turns out they have a policy where you can't bring your own water (!!!!!!!) but our waitress was nice enough to give us a cup to pour our water into. The food seemed like it took a loooot longer to come out, and there's no way this place is as busy as the one in GG.

K. and I both ordered crawfish, mild, the whole she-bang, and the food itself wasn't too bad. I did miss having condiments though...I'm so used to getting free condiments at the Cajun Corner, but eh. One huge plus was the corn was soo freakin' good. Quite possibly the best tasting corn I've ever had at a crawfish place. 

My experience here wasn't too bad, but it wasn't great. When in socal, I'll just stick to the Cajun Corner, and when in Vegas, I'll just curb my craving 'til I get back home. Probably won't come back.

Shrimp: Yes, I know it's called Boiling Crab, but you get the best value with shrimp. Medium spice, whole shebang, extra juicy is the way to go! We also line up the heads after we're done eating...it's just quirky tradition. We also ask for the lemon and salt/pepper as an extra dipping sauce. 

Sides: Corn is love. I always get at least two corns. I also order a side of rice because the sauce with rice is amazing. 

Cajun Fries: Great spices! Great choice if you love fries as much as I do. 

Service: Pretty inconsistent. It's hard to get a hold of someone. Most recently, it took forever for us to get our check. I would say their service has the biggest room for improvement.

As such, it was tough for me to get on board with the idea of eating at a place that delivers saucy shrimp in a plastic bag - only for their patrons to then DUMP the contents onto their butcher-paper-lined tables. I mean, seriously - EW. 

But it was the touristy thing to do, so we took a trip to The Boiling Crab on one of our recent visits to the City of Sin. 

From the moment we entered, it quickly began to win my heart over. It was the little things, really. An area for you to leave your mark on the (Boiling Crab) world via a Sharpie marker, a la old school Gino's East establishments. Iced Green Tea on the menu. Super-fun plastic bibs that I couldn't resist donning almost immediately. And - could it be?! - sweet potato fries on the menu! SCORE!

Unable to get past the ick factor of spilling out a bunch of shrimp juice onto my portion of the table - not to mention that I don't actually know how to peel my own shrimp - I opted for the much safer 'Fried Shrimp Basket.' It did not disappoint! Battered, but not overly so, and with a flavor that I've yet been able to match with other fried shrimp joints - I was not at all jealous of my dining companions (who were up to their knuckles in shrimp-y goodness). 

And, for the piece de resistance - the sweet potato fries. I would come here again and again for these alone. Thin cut, incredibly crispy, and salted to a science - I didn't want to share! They were perfect for alternating with the 'XXX Cajun Fries,' as those suckers were seriously spicy. Like embarrassed-because-you-thought-you-could-handle-it-but-you-coughed-after-taking-just-a-bite spicy. 

To top it all off, service here is always amazing. Servers are beyond friendly, and bring refills on your drinks before you even realize you need one. My only gripe? That they haven't opened any Boiling Crabs in the Midwest yet!",9cvf2L90hvmzeO2ZzmuXcQ,4,5,5,GbfocMcLzuN5JTycSSLpZw

I got mine last and as soon as I got the clams I finished about 15 mins faster then my fianc√© because crab legs your need to crack and clams you just get out of the shell. I know seafood is on the expensive side and our meal definitely was. Between the both of us we spent $60 plus tip $70. I gave them only 4 stars because the clams were not worth it in my opinion. I got mostly shells which made me a little disappointed. I didn't mind because shawn shared his food with me as there were plenty meat from the crab legs.

First time ever eating here was in July 2012 I was in Vegas for my brothers 21st birthday and the last day before we left everyone decided to come here to eat. I was pretty amused on the big wax paper they laid out on the table and knowing that everything that you eat will be all over and you can just throw your trash onto the table. They also give you a bib knowing how messy it will get. You also can eat with your hands if you wanted too. I was pretty excited on eating here. Of all the times Ive been to Vegas I never knew about this place. 

I ended up ordering 1 pound of shrimp with cajun seasoning and a side of white rice, my BF ordered the Jambalaya with a side of Calamari. It was definately delicious. I loved it. The prices may be a bit much but totally worth it. 

We loved this place soo much that when we came back to Vegas for a wedding in December 2012, we ended up eating here again on the last day before we left. Its like a tradition to eat here every time we are in Vegas. I ordered my normal 1 pound of shrimp and this time my BF ordered 1 pound of shrimp with sausages.

You have to come here when it opens because it can get pretty crowded. And Im usually with like 20 or more people so we have to get there before everyone else does to get a table that can seat all of us.

We ordered a pound each of the shrimp and crawfish then a lobster all with the whole sha-bang sauce medium. Also we ordered corn on the cob and potatoes. 

I'm very picky about my seafood so when the order came out I was very happy that it was hot, fresh, and not overcooked. I couldn't believe the size of the lobster it was huge and well worth the price.

The Boiling Crab is a lot bigger than the ones in Southern California and now have a huge wall of tvs that will be great to watch any sporting event, especially once football season starts. 

You must get the whole shabang sauce (basically extra butter, garlic and spices) to marinate your selection of seafood.

Went here one morning with a group of friends.  It was my first experience.  We were seated immediately and our orders were taken promptly.  However, they only gave us enough salt and pepper thingies and lemons for only half of our group. It took us a good ten minutes to get anyones attention so we could get more.  However, the first person we were able to grab told us we had to wait for our waiter. Okay, the guy couldn't tell the waiter for us? Our guy wasn't paying attention.

The oysters were the first to come out.  Now, I'm not an oyster snob, I don't know the names, I don't know where they come from, I just know if it tastes good or not.  These were not good.  The oyster snobs at my table agreed.  We didn't even eat them all.  We waved down a waiter and asked if we could do anything about it, perhaps deep frying them, since they have fried oysters on the menu.  The guy said no, and walked off. So we were stuck with crappy oysters.

The calamari came out.. Burnt tasting. Not good whatsoever. However, drowning it in ketchup helped. If I could stand the taste, im gonna eat it. I don't like to waste food.

I ordered crawfish in medium and the whole shabang flavor. It was awesome. Large chunks of garlic and a nice spicey flavor.  No complaints here!  Super messy though, I wish I hadn't worn white.

The sweet potato fries were good as well. I loved the slight crunch they had and the sweet flavor.

I'd probably go back if I went to Vegas again, was hungover, and craved crawfish.  Other than that, I'll stick to the one in CA. It was a way better experience.",k4ER9L0BhKNDoLlZVzVzOg,0,0,3,ktGio86F7vMxvIvD4laOwg

2318034,2011-12-05,2,zcScEL0WEdFkROcnz5379g,"Shrimp is as good as Hot n Juicy Crawfish (HAJC), but NOT as good quality as Cravin' Cajun (CC). I did receive a generous 19 shrimp per pound ordered, though. (Yes, I lined 'em up like trophies.) The sauce is spicy, but oddly buttery/oily, and I found myself not dipping the peeled shrimps back in the sauce. That is a sad state of affairs. Both HAJC and CC have me redipping in the sauce at all costs.

The Snow Crab (14.99/lb) here was of extremely good quality, and this reason alone is what is keeping my overall rating from being 3-stars. Some of the plumpest, sweetest and biggest Snow Crab I have ever had. I guess the owners figure that if people in Vegas are paying $25 elsewhere to eat all-u-can-eat snow crab, paying 14.99/lb better get you some top-tier crab. Interesting to note that my Snow Crab order was actually 0.9lb on my lunch receipt, so they only charged me 13.00 for the crab that I received. Pretty cool.

A ton of LCD tvs in the space, BUT NONE of them were on HD channels, so we ended up leaving at our game's halftime when we probably would have hung out longer if they had HD channels. The tvs are plentiful, but all kind of small (37"" or 40""?) And the restaurant space is big, so I found myself squinting to keep my eye on the football at times. If they had sprung for 46"" or 50""tvs it would have made a BIG difference. A classic case of quality vs. quantity.

Service was really good. The place seems well-managed. Unfortunately the buttery/oily sauce wasn't my style. I'm sure there are people out there that love it that way. Definitely give it a try, it may be for you. For me, I'll stick to CC and HAJC for my bag of cajun seafood fix!

Sauce note - if you get just the 'ragin' cajun' sauce it comes out like a uniform mol√© sauce with no garlic bits. No fun. If you add the 'garlic spread' to the sauce it improves, but then it comes out buttery/oily. Maybe doing the 'whole shebang' by adding the lemon pepper cuts it some, but I didn't try it.

Each visit, I have ordered 1lb of shrimp with sha-bang mild with an order of corn in the bag. I've also had the crab legs and lobster but although I have a taste for expensive eats, lobster and crab legs just don't do it for mel. I've sampled the crawfish too from a friend's bag but for me, there's no point to ordering crawfish unless it's the right season!

But: the shrimp in sha-bang mild is a godsend. The sauce is a mixture of garlic and heaven and if you don't try it, you're sincerely missing out. Large, perfectly cooked shrimp with the head still on (eating tip: rip the head off, suck some flavor out, then peel and eat the shrimp meet. ::drool::).

I love getting messy and eating with my hands, but of you've got a problem with that, BC probably isn't your place! Seafood orders come out in a plastic bag and after that: game on. Put on your bib, roll back your sleeves, and dig in!

  I've also sampled the Cajun fries (addicting and delicious) the sweet potato fries, and the fried catfish. All wonderful!

finally we pay first and i still continue my dinner. after we pay, they never come back, but actually we need another pen to sign cos the pen thet they gave wasnt working. They just talk eachoter, start ignoring us cos we pay already.

About 5 servers for 4 or 5 tables, but it seemed like the servers seemed to be in a not-working mode, will take forever to check back. the food was OK but not superb or addicting like when i had it over there. Seasoning was lacking. It seemed like you were eating plain boiled seafood(clams & shrimp) the fries were still delicious as always...but skip this place and drive up to HOT N JUICY.

I know this is called Boiling Crab but I'm not a fan of any crab that's been boiled so I'm probably not gonna try them. Now if BC had them steamed or grilled? I'd be all for it, something to ask about next time.

So a pound of shrimp is what I went with, all sauced up in the whole shebang with a side of sweet potato fries to soak up whatever sauce not on the shrimp. They were nicely sized and very delicious, add lime,some extra salt and pepper, and while you're at it more hot sauce. My mouth is watering right now. I usually don't like it when food is hot to touch and in a plastic bag but what's wrong with a little hint of plastic in your food once in a while. You can also go with other item like oysters which are raw, snow or blue crab which are boiled, fried shrimp which BC won't soak in sauce for you, etc and they're all at market priced I believe. You can also add potatoes and corn on the cob, yum. It smelt so good too. 

One pound of seafood is plenty though I probably could've done another pound if I didn't drink so much, BC serves alcohol best thing to drink with spicy food. And it gets messy so don't wear nice clothes unless you're female, we like it when you dress nice but hate it when you complain about those sauce stains. Wear something nice that you wouldn't mind getting stains on.

The interior is pretty spacious and can easily accommodate larger parties. It has a beach, fishing, crabbing theme with many TV to watch a game, a large fan circling the ceiling, and if you really wanted to write on some of the walls and tables. Service is good but watch out for that auto-gratuity, I think it's on parties of 6 or more.

I am a big fan and want to go ASAP.

Over here, it seems like a little known gem since I only waited at most ten minutes! Plus, there were empty tables that I passed on the way to my table, meaning that they just purposely make you wait a little. Probably because everyone wants to be hipster and eat on the Strip. But that's expensive--why fork over your winnings from Vegas there when you can get more for your money here.

It is kind of hard to find this place since they don't even have their name on the main plaza sign. But it's not like they need it anyways due to the hype. Take the waitress's offer and have her tie on the bib for you, you're gonna need it. Definitely get Whole Shabang sauce with the cajun fries, which are perfectly crispy. I actually expected the sauce to be a thicker consistency, but it's actually watery but still garlicky spicy goodness. And remember, mild here is not that spicy so spicy-lovers, go to the next level!

Three potatoes is probably good (I had six), but I'm glad I got two pieces of corn. I also had all three spices, medium - which was just about perfect for me (I don't eat as spicy in my younger days, but this was fine).

I had been hearing about The Boiling Crab from my friends here in L.A. but hadn't had a chance to venture out and try them.

Thankfully the Vegas location was not crowded at all.  I was a little worried about eating here on a Friday night when there was so much going on in town.  We got there at about 7:30pm and were seated right away.  We had:

2 pounds of shrimp with mild Rajun Cajun seasoning
Corn for one bag  
Gumbo with rice
Fried Shrimp Basket 
Dos Equis
Water
Total = $54+ with tax and tip


Highlights:
-The prices are extremely reasonable given the amount of food you receive
-The amount of food you receive is pretty impressive
-Service was fast and friendly (only had to ask for something twice, one time)
-Cool and clean decor
-My corn was delicious!! Should have ordered more. Hmpf! 


Lowlights:
 - One has to get over the fact that you can actually see the ""track"" aka poop trail in the back of a lot of your shrimp
- Tartar sauce was bland 
-The bulk of the flavor for the seafood is at the bottom of the bag, I kept having to dip my shrimp pieces in the sauce 
-Did they really just charge me $0.25 for water?!?!?!
-Only 2 of the 3 bathrooms were working in the women's restroom (not sure if that is a good sign...) 

I know some folks didn't like the mess (or the whole head thing) and I guess that it is part of the experience.  It reminds me of some other crab places (Crab Pot in Long Beach) but with more mess and less flavor.

I'm glad I tried it but there are some other places (Rockin Baja Lobster) that deliver less mess and way more flavor!

I'm spoiled by a place back home called Hanks's. My first attempt was Hot 'n Juicy. It was very so-so, giving a flavor similar to tobacco spit. Yes, I'm not kidding. In Houston, I was used to 5 to 7 dollars/lb. for restaurant crawfish, and here in Vegas it was $10/lb, so I was at least expecting passable. Now I've discovered The Boiling Crab, And it's GREAT!  Much better than HnJ, like everyone else seems to be saying. The only reason that I am giving 4 stars instead of 5 is that they have really high prices. 10 dollars per pound for crawfish is almost punitive!  They were happy to increase the garlic and spice, and it really paid off! Beer selection would have been better if they had a bock, Shiner or Ziegen, prefereably.

First Tip: Wear casual clothes that you won't mind if they get ruined.  This was my first time here and my wife and I were unaware of the ""get up in it"" hands approach of dining so we were dressed inappropriately.  I wore one of my favorite polo's and she wore white pants...tsk tsk.  Luckily, my polo made it out unscathed.  Her pants.....we won't mention.  Second Tip: Leave the jewelry at home. It just gets in the way of truly enjoying all of the flavors when you're eating like a cave-person.  No forks or knifes to be seen.  Third Tip: They only serve Beer and Wine due to not having their liquor license so be prepared.  You can however bring your own bottle of wine for a small corkage fee.  They offer a decent selection of beers.  We went with bottles of Corona and the (canned) IPA.

The server was fantastic and we were with people who dined there before so they did all the ordering.  All I remember hearing was a lot of ""1 LB. Shrimp She-Bang"" and ""Spicy She-Bang Sausage"".  After a short wait, the server would deliver a plastic bag filled with your protein of choice swimming in the most delectable sauce I've tasted.  The bag o' sausage had chunks of garlic that had me sticking my dirty paws back in repeatedly.  The server then brought us boardwalk fries dusted with Old Bay (just the way I like them).  Over the course of the meal, we had tried the Dungeness crab, king crab legs, shrimp, lobster, fries and sausage.  Every item ordered was a huge win. Can't wait to go back, but this time we will be prepared.  I plan on dining with sweat pants and a painter's smock.",NppW9SFDMKioUAx_87QQhw,1,1,5,8ET891msejlXxB0HpgJzCQ

Coming to Boiling Crab isn't just eating out, it's a fun experience with the bibs and the adventure of eating. I love spicy but their Medium is actually pretty spicy so I went for mild and that still had a pretty rad kick to it.

I was so excited to see that there was a BC in Vegas and of course had to come. Especially because I get uber anxious driving to the one in Koreatown. Not to mention the wait time in ktown =/

My hubs and I came around 4 pm and the restaurant was maybe 1/4 filled. The first thing that shocked me was the size of this location. It's so open and pretty big compared to ktown. Our waiter was really friendly and spoke a bit too soft. But it could've been the noise inside that made it difficult to hear. 

As we were seated, we are informed that they were out of blue crabs and dungeness crabs, which was a huge let down, but in hind sight probably better. 

The reviewer that mentioned the flavor not being on par as the other location, totally hit it on the head. We ordered a pound of shrimp with the whole shebang-medium and was sorely disappointed at the sauce in the bag. The sauce was barely liquid and primarily had chunks of the seasoning, making the sauce uber salty. We also ordered the king crab legs (a pound, which came out to three large legs) and same issue with the sauce. 

The shrimp and crab legs were definitely over cooked. But that didn't stop me from eating them.. Especially when our bill came out to over $65.

We also ordered catfish with cajun fries - which my hubs loved. The only downside was the fries got cold pretty quick.. And I love my fries to be crispy and crunchy. 

Overall, it was an okay experience and I've definitely had better. I wish I would've checked out the new place that just opened up. Probably won't come back the next time we're in Vegas.",cFi7o039_xwe7s53yKPdAg,3,2,2,dTPl-2c2-zFntWwyb9nKHQ

We tried The Whole Shebang sauce and it had an overly excessive amount of garlic. HUGE chunks of garlic, which was really unappetizing. Also, we felt the lobster was a bit over cooked.

The restaurant is large with A LOT of flat screen TVs, so it's good if you want to come for the big game.

Also, the service was HORRIBLE. Not just from one person, but from everybody!! We got the saucy spicy, so any logical waiter would know that we would probably need a lot of water during our meal.

I was promptly informed that they were out of blue crab and only had frozen crawfish. No prob as I was here for the snow crab legs. Got seated promptly and waited on just as quick. 
I ordered the snow crab legs not spicy and with the whole sha-bang which I guess is Cajun, lemon pepper, butter and garlic. I also asked for 2 pieces of corn. Me loves corn.
Everything comes in a big steaming plastic bag. The table is covered with a sheet of paper ripped off a roll and this paper is containment for the entire tables mess that's left when the meal is done. All the empty shells etc...are just thrown on the table and everything is picked up in one fell swoop. The waiter gave me a sheller and cracker tool. I also needed a fork to help get the meat out of the legs. Anyway... It was awesome. The flavor was magnificent. I could taste the old bay, the garlic, the butter...very very sweet tender crab. The corn made the meal even better. I consider myself a corn connoisseur. I hate when I get corn that has been soaking in a water bath for so long it is flavorless and soggy. This was crisp and soaking in the sauce just made it full of goodness. 

Oh the sauce... I used the eaten corn cobs to sop up the sauce and just kept sucking the sauce out of the cobs. The garlic chunks were so plentiful and soft I didn't know how much garlic I was eating... When I went to pick up my wife from work afterwards, she asked if I had leftover food in the car...that's how intense the smell was. My hands reeked of garlic for several days afterwards. I told her she needed to try the place...I couldn't wait to take her there so we went back that weekend. She really enjoyed it. So mucho that we took friends who were visiting a few weeks later. That third visit was the best one yet! That nights meal had the most crab of all found in the bag. Each leg was big and oh so tender. We really really love this place, and writing this makes me think tomorrow's dinner is going to be there. 

The only problem I have had in 3 visits was on the last visit with friends, I ordered the mild instead of not spicy. I asked for two pieces of corn, my wife asked for one. When the meal came the bag I was handed had one piece and my wife's had two, so we asked if it was just each others order and we just should switch bags. He said no...hers was correct and he took my bag back to get another piece of corn...well 20 minutes later everyone was in the middle of their meal and I hadn't gotten my food back yet. All for another corn. My waiter disappeared for 15 minutes so we had to ask another for my food. Anyway it turns out after talking with my wife that it was switched bags from the get go. She said here's was a bit spicier than she xpected. We like spice so it wasn't a problem, but the waiter messed up...no real biggie. Not going to keep me from going back. My friends who can be real picky loved it too. The husband who can be real proper sometimes, dove in head first. Not knowing how to eat crabmeat I showed him, and by the end of business his hands were bsolutely covered on sauce...wish I had my camera handy.",6BG-geUq96Q5j_sbG0fqlQ,1,0,5,zTmg_5_llXh1_H_ou603VQ

I love this place because: 1. It's way bigger than the other two locations in Southern California. 2. As a result of it being bigger, wait times are next to minimal. 3. Service is fast and efficient. 4. Plenty of parking. 5. They have tvs just about everywhere so if there is a big game on, you will not miss it!

Tonight I also ordered the lemon pepper hot wings out of curiosity. To my pleasant suprise the wings were actually pretty good and bigger than your average wings! 

I gave them 4 stars because the first time I came here I remember ordering the calamari which was about 10 dollars. It was good but for that price you get a small portion and honestly one person could scarf it down and not even think twice about it. My recommendation would be to get the hotwings instead because you will actually get more meat for the price. 5 pieces were about 6 bucks and 10 was about 3 bucks more. The two flavors they have are lemon pepper and cajun. No, you cant get both flavors if you order 10 pieces. You would have to order separate to get both flavors. Why you cant split it I dont know. The server couldnt answer my question.

The most common question I get is, ""Is it better than Hot n' Juicy?"" My answer would be ""YES!"" Both are similar but Boiling Crab has more advantages namely my 1 thru 5's above. Go eat at both and you can come up with your own conclusion, but as you can see I already gave you mine.

Ask for limes and salt'n'pepper -- they give you a generous amount!

The service was quick, efficient, and friendly during both of the times we dined here.  Even though it was a madhouse on Saturday during dinner, our food came out within 10 minutes!

P.S. Don't wear nice clothes if you plan to come here!
P.P.S. Wash your hands with limes and let it soak for at least 1-2 minutes if you want to get the seafood/cajun smell out of your hands!",LkP5uU4ncr5MgNp8ercSCA,10,5,4,2SMnpZJ2FlWEPyChaPyLnw

If you didn't, or just missed the first seating, you'd be subjected to about a 1/5 - 2 hour wait. The San Jose BC workers were also mostly teenagers who liked talking to themselves as opposed to following up with what customers wanted. To avoid this, I'd end up going to similar places (Red Crawfish, Crawdaddy, making it at home etc.), but nothing really compared to that whole shebang flavor. 

This is why the Las Vegas BC is definitely a welcomed change of pace - the workers are young here too, but they are really on top of things. The dining room is also huge with 30+ flat screens showing a ton of different things - sports, cartoons, news, etc. Food is just as good without the hefty wait, and if there is a wait, the waiting area is indoors with a bunch of TVs as well. Looks like this is a popular place to have big group outings and celebrations, too.

2894336,2017-04-20,2,zcScEL0WEdFkROcnz5379g,"First visit and I wanted to give myself a day to really think about this, before giving a two star review. They use MSG, and they use a lot of it! 

The food was good (while we were eating) but by the time my party got to the car--two of us were suffering immediate allergic reactions. By the time we got home, all of us didn't feel good. It's been 24 hours since we ate and I'm still sick. Massive headache, dehydration, itchy, red skin etc. Every symptom I get, when I'm exposed to high levels of MSG. 

Besides that, The restaurant in general is really odd. It has a plank wood interior (cool idea, you feel like you should be eating fish when you're in there) but most of it is covered in graffiti. There are signs everywhere that they're doing a renovation. There are warnings on paper signs saying that if you write on the ""clean wood"",  you will be fined or in trouble etc. There's also a big sign that says you will be prosecuted if you ""dine and dash"". There are security cameras facing every table and hired security at the door. What am I at nightclub? Am I missing something here? Very unusual thing to see at a restaurant like that. They obviously have issues with something. Not going to revisit to find out what. 

We had to wait a while to sit even though the place wasn't crowded by any means. 

The only food issue we had was with the clams, there was one clam to every 3 shells in the bag. Weird. Don't rip people off, it's not cool. 

The only other crawfish restaurant I've been to, is hot and juicy. I think we are definitely going to stick to what we know and not return to the boiling crab. Sorry guys, it's not worth getting sick over. 

It's petty but I have to mention because I am a woman that spends a lot of money on my nails.... They don't carry gloves. I know it might be traditional to eat with your bare hands, but not everybody want to get that dirty. 

The reason why I gave two stars instead of one was because the food was pretty good, we just was nice but other than that.... big no. Maybe take the food to go if you like MSG... if not, go elsewhere!",UUVbV8XmTzNksBOPaiO3pA,8,3,2,TOTxX0DIjeoe-PrQEta8eQ

There was a perfect view of the game in every angle of the room. I went there for a NBA Finals game and I was stoked to see so many televisions. If this place wasn't a restaurant, I would assume it's a tv convention with all the tv's they have in there. Best part of my night, I ate for free because we had a bet on the game, and the loser had to cover the tab (Eat for free?? Oh yes, I LOVE it!).

The food was great, service was even better. There are dozens of people on the floor scurrying around refilling drinks and serving countless bags of yummy shrimp, just waiting to be devoured by hungry guests. The shrimps are gigantic but the portions are pretty small. I had to order two bags for a filling meal.

Oh yeah, make sure to take a sharpie or pen. Inside it looks like some severe graffiti took place, but the restaurant is OK with people writing on the walls. I regret not bringing one because I wanted to doodle all over the walls.

One gripe: They are missing a sauce between medium and Triple X. Isn't there supposed to be a ""hot"" somewhere between that? Because Triple X is too damn spicy and medium is too mild. Oh, and I wish they had pitchers of beer. Ordering them individually takes out the fun. :[

But I'm nip-picking here. This place is up there with Hot and Juicy for me, as far as the quality of food. However, in terms of service and venue, I would choose Boiling Crab in a heartbeat. It is so much roomier, faster and better service, and thousands of TVs. Food comes out in less than 5 minutes, 10 minutes if they are busy.

2976392,2015-03-20,2,zcScEL0WEdFkROcnz5379g,"This is tough for me to review but I'll do my best..
I love the menu prices because I believe it to be fair for the quality and quantity. I don't believe that the food is that amazing that it warrants a 2 hour wait to get a table. Are there no other seafood places like this in the area?

I was visiting from NYC and we are really limited in seafood restaurants that prepare the variety of sea creatures the way they do at Boiling Crab. There may be one or two restaurants but what you'll discover is that the alright seafood comes at a steep price tag. Now that is a sucky combo. Needless to say... those restaurants are not generating lines out the door.

The reason I explain all of that is because my lack of access to sea creatures in a bag is extremely limited. So if I compare my previous experience in NY to what I recently experienced in LA - LA takes the win for sure.

But I just didn't get the hype. We were a table of 6 and ordered at least 1lb of crawfish, 4 lbs of shrimp, basket of fries as well as the fried catfish. The service was great - very attentive and friendly. Fries - standard. Fried catfish - not too shabby!!! The batter was light and the fish was moist though sliiiightly undercooked. You can tell when the meat doesn't easily break when you try to cut through. 

Oh - LONG LINES for the bathroom!!!!!!!!!! Everyone wants to wash their sauce covered hands and it's just one stall per gender. Not cool man. Get your customers another sink or some wet wipes!",Bli7WC918E-v8pGebf4EBQ,3,1,3,Ek9VgXRf9jP6b89XjiCuYw

The only reason its not 5 stars is the weird up-sell on everything. We initially tried to order a half lb of mussels (something not offered at the Koreatown location), a lb of Lobster, a half lb of snow crab for my 9 year old (he likes non-spicy so has to have a separate order). The snow crab is a minimum 1lb order. Okay... the mussels too... okay.... the lobster is a whole lobster and they are 2-3 lbs each (so I guess the minimum order for lobster is 2 lbs). Sighhhh. 

So our final order : 1lb snow crab and half lb shrimp in non spicy for the child. He loved it, no complaints. (And actually, he ate it all.) 1 lb mussels, 1 lb king crab, half lb shrimp, potatoes and corn in mild for us. Cajun fries. with so much food I had to skip the gumbo, there's no way we could have finished it. 2 beers rounded off or order (Shocktop Apple). The food was delish! One exception, the mussels. They just didn't absorb the seasoning, I ate one and decided they weren't worth the calories. My advice is to skip them and go for the gumbo instead.

Location- Easy to find same area as food for less (cheap cheap food) and tons of parking out front. Love that this location never has a wait and there's always a table ready for us every time I come here...unlike San Jose's location where you always have an hour or more of a wait time.

Ambiance- It feels like a fisherman's wharf kinda feel to it where the ocean is right out on deck in front. Love the nets, fake crab and ocean decor they have going on all throughout the restaurant. I like that the bathroom never has that nasty feel to it nor does the restaurant have the fishy, ocean smell to it...which says a lot because the place is a seafood restaurant. And I love that the menu is so easy to read and self-explanable for 1st timers.

Food-It's all about the ""XXX WHOLE SHA-BANG"" Basically all the flavors they offer in one from lemon-pepper, Cajun, garlic and butter. You can also choose your spiciness level from xxx, medium, mild and non-spicy...I like the xxx the best because it's super spicy and perfect with all that high calorie goodness sauce...I always ask for extra lime to squeeze inside of my shrimp and corn bag and on top of my rice. The salt and pepper container should also be used for your dipping. I usually always get a pound of shrimp for $8.99/lb. I've also tried their craw fish and crab legs but the shrimp is still my favorite seafood of choice when eating here. Other yummy food items are their raw oysters with the sauce they give..and they are big oysters and it's fresh! The spicy Cajun wings are really juicy, spicy, full of flavor and has tons of meat in them...it's not overly fried nor is it too oily, everyone that has eaten that has loved it. My boyfriend and his friends loved their gumbo for it's flavor and fillingness it gave them.",9A0BjnrnYdEg4uRgfFhppw,1,3,5,_hDynkmpY9ZtIAJnwONiOA

We took a cab from the main strip - it's not that close and the cab ride was about $30 with tip included. 

We arrived around 2:00pm and there was still a wait - I would recommend getting a reservation before you come. This place seems busy no matter what time you are there. After we were leaving, the dinner rush came and the wait was even longer.

The food: we ordered crawfish in the she-bang sauce and the Cajun ragin sauce. We also ordered 2 dozens of their oysters and the snow crab legs and king crab legs in both Cajun ragin and She-bang sauce. All of it was really good, I do prefer that She-bang sauce tho because it has a slight kick to it! And OMG the oysters were so gooooooodddd. These were Gold Bonds which are gulf oysters and they were amazing. We stopped eating the crab legs and just ordered more oysters! Lol!

I'm glad we tried this place, service was great and I'd definitely come back. If I were to compare this and Hot N Juicy, I would say hot n juicy is better but this spot is pretty damn good too. I'm salivating now! Lol",xBb1iJZi9kn5bCawCOM1Cg,0,0,5,F4yg0A2BXgxEzdNjIiz56A

For newbies I recommend you get your fish in butter (it's actually not real butter)

After having been somewhat disappointed by one of their competitors, The Boiling Crab really stood out for me. The restaurant itself is very open with plenty of seating and while you can obviously smell the seafood, it wasn't like a punch-you-in-the-face smell you might expect. As with similar restaurants, each table is pretty basic with a disposable cover and next to nothing else. I thought it was really cool they let you write on the walls too!

With places like this, I come generally for two things only...crawfish and shrimp. I was glad to see that Boiling Crab clearly differentiates between frozen and live crawfish. There's a huge difference and for those complaining about the work to reward ratio, you just ain't doing it right! :P 

I ended up ordering 1lb of each and loved every bite of it. The crawfish were perfectly cooked and I was in body cracking, head sucking heaven. Even the shrimp were cooked as close to perfect as you can get. They have a couple seasoning choices and if you can't decide what you want, they'll throw it all together for what they call the ""Whole Shaw-bang"". I opted for that on the crawfish and although I didn't taste much of the lemon pepper, it was delicious. For the shrimp, I ordered it with the ""Cajun"" seasoning, which is spectacular! Both were super flavorful and with the medium spice, it's the perfect heat level.

If you're not into shrimp or crawfish, they have several other options from oysters to lobster. My little man had some crab legs which they happily made plain for him and he devoured them. For those who don't eat seafood, about the only thing they offer is chicken wings, but the wifey ordered those and said they were pretty decent.

When it comes to the service, I had no complaints. Our waitress was great and made sure we were taken care of from start to finish. The prices are good too! And while I'm always wanting to check out new joints with crawfish, I'll definitely be back to The Boiling Crab when I want an amazing, messy meal!",QqRSNjWhfUFv1ZU0OnYKZQ,5,1,5,x_ploOuYpiBcWvSPD4m0ng

We probably had around 20 clam shells in our bag but only about 8 had meat inside. It was quite disappointing. However, I enjoyed the bold and spicy flavor of the rajun cajun seasoning, so I poured it all over my rice. The portion of the shrimp was a bit more generous (we got about 15 pieces? for the pound), but I didn't enjoy the whole shabang seasoning (tasted like ketchup to me). And the cajun fries were way too salty. 

All in all, it was just ok. I had skyrocket expectations for this place, because my friends hyped it up so much. Unfortunately, those expectations fell immensely short. But I'm sure that I will give it another try sooner or later. In the meantime, I'd rather spend a couple more bucks and pig out right across at Makino.

She was like ""yeah okay but it's extra"" and I told her I have been coming to this one since it opened and it's the first time I can't get anything out of the bag and even the ones in LA aren't so lacking in sauces and she said that they follow the guidelines and basically it is what it is.

Get the sha-bang sauce. It'll be the best choice you'll ever make in your life. I usually order it with their fresh shrimp. Add on some sausage that highly complement the sauce which in turn brings out the flavor in them. 

And the finishing touch - corn! I know it sounds strange and my dining companion didn't believe me either (he became a devout believer after one bite), but when the buttery sweet corn on the cob is covered with the sauce, there are simply no words to explain the explosion of flavors that makes you think ""wow, I've never had corn like this before!""

When I got there, I found several things interesting:

1. First, they bib you.  Yes, you get a bib, but they'll put it on you.  I thought it was novel until I got a pair of boobs mashed into the back of my head and was forced to pretend not to like it due to the sour face my wife was making.

2. The place it wide open.  It's like eating at a crab feast.  Only, with restaurant prices.

3. Everything comes out in a bag.  No dishes.  Just bags with your food in it.

So those were the interesting parts.  Here are the parts I didn't like:

1. They ran out of Dungeness crabs.  Um, you're called the boiling crab.  I expect you to have crabs if your name indicates you're a crab joint.

2. When selling the blue crabs, they sell by weight.  Not by the bushel like I'm used to.

3. It's too loud - between the TV noise and the other diners, I could barely chalk this up as a restaurant experience.

So, I wouldn't be back if I can help it.  Of course, I admit that I am a bit of a crab snob since being the near the Chesapeake, I can get crabs when I want, in the quantity I want, all drenched in Old Bay.  The combination sauce they have there is not bad, but I liked it better on the shrimp and not the crabs themselves.  C'est la vie.",7bwDw99gKkuxr-zBtzqvCg,3,0,3,QparV0GptGh40uVB_DomRQ

I've been to BC Koreatown and BC Alhambra in CA but didn't go to either one of them during spring break so that I could try the BC in Vegas.  

First pro to this BC is that there's free + lots of parking. (BC K-town is valet and street parking free after 6pm.  BC Alhambra has street parking but hard to find)

The space surprised me because the BC K-Town and Alhambra are TINY!  Those two combined would only be half the size of BCLV!  I loved the spaciousness and that each table had a tv BUTTTTTTT!!!!! Service was horrible!  BC K-Town is ALWAYS busy (there's a huge line of people waiting in line before the place even opens) but BCLV barely had anyone and yet, my server spent more time at one table full of girls than my table.  I'm sure serving a table full of girls is more fun than serving a couple but honestly, he didn't even stop by to see if we needed a refill...and my boyfriend had his cup RIGHT AT THE EDGE OF THE TABLE!  

The food was okay.  It was too watery/ somewhat bland compared to K-town and Alhambra so I was a little disappointed.  

After we were done eating, the server was still busy serving the girls that we had to get up and get the receipt ourselves..He probably didn't even know we left.

They tell me I can order Togo. -shrug- I'm sure crab travels well. The guy at the Togo register was so confused. I ordered a lb of King Crab. 19.99/lb.

The fried catfish is hearty and they sure as hell don't skimp on portions. You could easily be full off of that alone, especially with the fries, which are pretty decent.

We decided to order some shrimp as well as crawfish because we knew how frustrating peeling away those crawfish all night could be. When it comes to seasoning your crustaceans, I highly recommend ""the whole shebang"", which is a mixture of all their seasonings thrown together. I found the sauce absolutely delectable and was practically slurping it up off of my side of the table. The crawfish are...well...crawfish, which means that they can be difficult to peel apart for that tasty meat. It helped that I had my dexterous girlfriend with me who helped peel much of the critters for me. The shrimp were juicy and easy to eat but I definitely preferred the flavor of the crawfish. Try squeezing some lime in there for added flavor.

I walked away from the meal feeling rather full and bloated and licking the sauce off my fingers. It's good food but I just can't bring myself to give them the 4 star rating. Something is missing-- maybe it's just that hint of authenticity that you look for in real cajun cooking. But at the end of the day, I do endorse this franchise as worthy of your business.

We sat and order the fried oysters, lb of shrimp, Cajun fries and the king crab legs. Plus a side of fries and coke. All the seasoning were the sha bang and medium spice. 

The rice came first, no reason when there were nothing else served so the rice got cold when food actually arrived. Followed the Cajun fries, shrimp, fried oyster and then the king crab legs. Everything was alright until I saw the king crab legs. For $45 I got three king crab legs and they weren't meaty at all. (SCAM) 

Fried oysters were bland, and the Cajun need lots of ketchup. Only the pound of shrimp held up to its name. 

All the seasoning were over salted and that's pretty dreadful. Our server Kristin, I believe didn't tell me about the refill soda. She only asked if I wanted a refill when I payed the bill. What???? I was in need of more soda cause the medium spice was pretty hot. Aside from that, seems like the severs here like to take care of the larger tables considering they would tip more than a smaller table. Plus she didn't offer a bib until I notice everyone had one and I asked for it! Seems fair I deserve some better service since my entire order was not cheap. 

Won't be returning to this establishment. Wouldn't recommend the king crap legs to anyone. Totally not worth it for so little in return. Hopefully management can work something out about the over priced king.",Vd24R1OnKzw8WjHLrrDTtw,4,2,3,-eeFzRb0IF8dGQOk4bJVvg

But enough with the constraints let's talk about why we go here in the first place.  

First up the service, this is probably the only Cajun style seafood restaurant in town that has the shortest wait time, probably due to the space, its twice as or close to three times bigger than the other similar restaurants in town.   Don't get me wrong, service is still fast, i like it that the servers are fairly organized.  

Next the food, the shrimp is a great start and probably the best bang for the buck, note 3lbs is plenty for a party of 4.  Throw in some sausages, corn and some rice you got a full meal.  The snow crabs & king crabs are great albeit +/-$18/lb market price at least here in Las Vegas. So the price of your meal can get up there.  Their oysters are the common pacific oyster variety, fresh and always a sure bet.  Their crawfish can vary depending if its season or not which the latter you will get the frozen kind, which to doesn't bother me the least.  All in all the foods flavor is based on their numerous sauces which goes with the garden variety Lemon Pepper sauce to the hodgepodge of Cajun flavor The Whole Sha-Bang.  In addition, you can choose from varying heat levels, I love choices.

Overall, its a flavorful experience that keeps me coming back for more.",gVZ4ZpM3bAjRGukxNBr-aA,2,1,4,Epw_iqw_muBz7qJ78j0pNA

Came here recently on a weeknight & it was packed! Prepare to wait patiently. Drinks can be ordered at the To-Go counter & hold you down until it's time to eat. 

No matter what other similar concept-style place I try, The Boiling Crab's sauce always wins. It's not too salty, oily, or sweet like others I've tried, IMO. My family loves coming here because the space can accommodate us, it's casual, fun, & super kid friendly. For some reason, other families think it's so kid friendly that they let their kids become barbaric. Dear parents, please keep your offspring seated, pick up that corn they threw on the ground!

The shrimp (about $10 a pound) was large. They still had their heads on, which can make for a memorable experience. I ripped one off and all the brains and extra stuff exploded all over me. Luckily I had their plastic bib on. The king crabs were excellent (roughly $25 per pound). It's tough to ever be disappointed with king crabs as long as their not overcooked. We got the whole sha-bang with both. That's a mixture of all their seasonings -- rajun cajun, lemon pepper, and garlic pepper. I loved how they had chunks of garlic in there. It made for a great dipping sauce. We also got corn and potatoes. Dip that stuff in the sauce and cover in garlic and you'll be in heaven.

The place is huge. Plenty of tables, chairs and booths and TVs everywhere. It's a great place to watch football or just hang out with a group. They get extra points for having HD, unlike HNJ, where the reception was nothing but static.",C2C0GPKvzWWnP57Os9eQ0w,5,2,4,nUzbjXY5NMouK83zsI3hDg

The restaurant is located on the corner of Decatur and Flamingo and it's enormous! It was empty when we went because I'm not sure a lot of people know about the opening yet. There are lots of booths and tables. The cool part is that you can vandalize the restaurant! They give you Sharpies and you can write and draw on the walls. They just ask that you keep it PG.

Our waitress was great about explaining the menu to us since we were first timers. I ordered a pound of snow crab legs in the whole she-bang sauce in mild. My husband ordered the same but in medium. The market price today was $14.99. I also got some steamed rice and corn on the cob.

With our sexy bibs on, we opened up our plastic bag and got down and dirty. The crab was succulent and finger-licking good! The corn on the cob was the perfect compliment. I probably would've needed another pound of crab if I didn't have my rice on the side.

Service was top notch. We were checked on regularly. They have good soap and a heavy duty hand dryer which is a must when you eat here.

There's no way to avoid comparing Hot N' Juicy Crawfish to The Boiling Crab. There's something about the sauce at BC that's so good!  Don't get me wrong... Hot N' Juicy is delicious but The Boiling Crab is all that and a bag of well... Crab!",MaxlLd0HZmCtdZ3yJ9pyJQ,12,6,4,UshO9TQ2sMGqqZOVWRMOVQ

I'm usually conscious about the price. I usually get water, half pound of the whole shabang mild shrimp with rice and cajun fries and that will typically cost less than $12 and a very full tummy.

The first time I went here with my boyfriend, we were really awkwardly seated, but that was fine. They had only been open for a few weeks at this point. The server that we had was a little rude when we asked if we could have some lemon with black pepper and salt. She sarcastically asked, ""Did you mean you want more lime?"" Seriously girl? Lol.  I know that they were new and it was not that busy, but there were about 10-14 people standing behind the counter chit-chatting away when we did need something, and did not want to be rude by trying to flag them down.

The food was definitely as good as in Calfornia!

The second time we went was definitely the reason why I have raised it to four stars. We were still awkwardly seated, haha. Somehow we landed the same booth that we had last time! This time, our server was very nice and friendly. After she took our orders, she went back and gave us the black pepper and salt cups without us having to ask. The only thing we requested was the lime. Ha. And man did she pour out a lot :D She kept checking up on us the whole time that we were eating and made sure that our drinks were refilled in a timely manner. It wasn't just her this time as well, it seemed like random member of the crew were assisting us which was a plus. Yay for team effort! You HAVE to try their sweet potato fries!

While I was eating, I saw that they are able to accommodate larger parties even when they get busy during dinner hours. This restaurant is definitely big so there is tons of seating everywhere so you won't have to wait.

After reading the reviews on boiling crab I felt confident we would have a great evening.  Sadly, that was not the case and at this point our experience has to be the worst dining experience we have had in 2012.   

Let's start with the good.  We went on a Thursday and were seated right away.  We ordered a couple punds of crawfish 1 with the cajun spice 1 med and 1 mild some boiled shrimp and some fried shrimp and fries for our young son (2.5yrs).  
The boiled food all came out together and was prompt and tasted good to great no complaints here.  

Now the bad. First, the fried food came out at least 10-15 minutes after the boiled food so I was left managing a hungry toddler trying to keep him out of the spicy food.  
We had to track down another server to get them to check on it.    Then we immediately ordered some additional boiled crawfish. After 15 to 20 minutes of no food and no server we sought someone out to figure it out. Another 10 minutes and our server shows up saying they must of sent our order to another table. She rushed our order and offered 25% discount. A nice gesture but sadly the poor service continued, as our toddler continued his downward spiral we tried to get our check and waited another 10 minutes.   Over all the service was lacking and inattentive.  
The food was good but I found the crawfish to be a tad overcooked and hard to peel. I probably wouldn't have noticed that if I wasn't already upset by the poor service.    The crawfish were large and flavorful but the sauce spicy levels were hard to distinguish.

Plus I ordered a pound of crab and it felt like there was nothing inside. Cracked the 4 legs and there was barely any meat. Biggest piece was the size of my pinky.  At first I wasn't mad but after opening each leg it got more aggravating. I brought it up to the server and showed them how small the last piece was they said they need to see if all of them were like that. They didn't do anything to fix the crappy feeling I got from eating there. 

All in all poor customer bservice and it ruined the experience for me. The clams and the crawfish is much bigger at hot n juicy too.

3698189,2012-01-14,0,zcScEL0WEdFkROcnz5379g,"The great debate is over! I've finally dipped my sinful fingers in a one pound bag of shrimp, drenched with SHABANG sauce. The controversal question that lingers everyone's mind is...HOT AND JUICY OR BOILING CRAB? Who is the king of ocean shell eats?!?!?! A great first for me tonight at Boiling Crab, and I must confess, my heart is in the middle.  I'm at a 50/50 decision here where one seafood joint outruns one trait and another for something different.

Here are the pros and cons: While the 1 pound shrimp may feel like you're being swindled in quantity, I think the quality of shrimp cancels it out. The shrimp SIZE is big. Which I am thankful for since it requires less work in peeling shrimp, and the taste of wonderful shrimp does suffice at every bite. It gets discouraging sometimes peeling small shrimp, and feeling like you didn't pop enough shrimp in your mouth to enjoy it. The SHABANG SAUCE tastes different from HOT AND JUICY's house sauce. Shabang is a bit more tangy, salty, and less spicy. Which I actually love. If you're an indecisive person when pick a good sauce, pick the Shabang since it compiles all the sauces together. I went for mild tonight to be safe, and thankfully it wasn't as spicy as I would have assumed.

25 cents for a cup of water. This turned me off a bit since that was a first for me, and I always thought water is complementary in every restaurant. Also, I heard from my friends the catfish isn't that great. But, I think thats expected because fried catfish isn't fried catfish unless its from the south, or with a little soul! 

Service was great! They were very friendly, and always returned with your requests promptly. The fun part is the idea of writing on the wall. I mean, you came, you saw, you conquered. Might as well let everyone know you were there!",a48HhwcmjFLApZhiax41IA,3,0,4,9Th57iqHaudAO1YFkHxaUg

Wanted to order two but Jessi demanded that she got her own pound.  It was ""spicy but good."" Jessi also ordered the Cajun chowder after she found out that the jambalaya was called gumbo (which upset her). ""It was good!""the girls also ordered sausage and rice. It was ""yummy"" they loved the sausage in their mouths. Also Jessi recommend corn with your shrimp. It makes it better. Angel got king crab and garlic shrimp. Both were good. Crab was too much work. He also got some lemon pepper fries. Those too were good. I got catfish and fries. It was excellent as always. The girls also got spicy fries.

We got a little bit of everything in the whole shabang sauce in varying spiciness. My choice is whole shabang medium, just the right amount of kick. We got shrimp, crawfish (frozen), dungenous and snow crab legs. To go with all the seafood we got corn, potatos and sausage. All the food was cooked perfectly and the sauce very flavorful and delicious. My complaint would be that not all the bags were seasoned the same, some were better than others, even between two whole shabang mediums, one was much more flavorful so I ended up just dipping everything in that one bag. The corn was a big hit as well, the potatos are definite fillers, but good for dipping into more sauce. The sausage should be a pass, it was dry, even after sitting at the bottom of the grease seasoning bag, maybe it was old or just not good but I rather spend the money on more corn next time.

Apparently there would always be a 45 minute wait, so this place HAD to be good. Finally Boiling Crab was in Vegas and I thought I would be one of their first customers. Haha, that was not the case because I waited 2 months after they opened to actually eat here. I think I wasn't as excited because people who tried California Boiling Crab and LV Hot N Juicy said HNJ was better. But of course I had to see for myself so my friend and I came in on for a late lunch/ early dinner. We ordered 2 lbs of shrimp in the shabang sauce with potatoes, corn, and cajun fries. Boiling Crab is only the second restaurant I've been to that has the same concept, so I had no choice but to compare them with HNJ. The sauce was thinner and tasted like it had less flavor. It also seemed like the sauce was just all butter and the spices weren't mixed in very well. The shrimp also made my fingers itch, which was kind of odd (no I'm not allergic). The potatoes, corn, was good as usual. And the cajun seasoning on the fries was surprisingly good because I was anticipating it to have too much paprika or something. The service was promp because I guess there's no assigned servers to a certain table/ area. I know that for a fact because after we placed our order, another gentleman comes with a note pad and pen to ask us if we ordered already.

This is a great place to take a date because you get this interactive meal, get down and dirty with eating shellfish, and get to test your date on how hot and spicy they can take down.  I like the atmosphere in here because it has a home like feel and a chill ambiance.  I come here in my dress down clothes so I can get down and dirty with my crawfish.

I order the whole sha-bang!  I like it medium so I can still get some garlic flavor in there but still taste the seafood.  I get my bag of crawfish with two ears of corn inside and let them marinate in the sauce while I eat. Sometimes I have to take them out early before they get too marinated in the hot sauce that I can barely eat them!  I also order a side of sweet potato fries for some carbohydrates to cool down the heat a little.

What I like best about this place is that it's huge and accomodating for big groups of people, but they have an array of booths for some privacy if you come here with a friend or loved one.  You can even write on their walls to commemorate your visit!  I also like how they play the sports channels on  their TVs so that your boyfriend doesn't miss an important game.  And they have a plethora of TVs on their walls so you definitely can't miss a game!

I dined here during holiday season. The wait was around one hour but we got called in early. Sweet! This restaurant is huge. So it's good for big parties.

Customer service is efficient and excellent. I ordered some shrimp, crawfis h, clam, and king crab legs. I ordered mild with whole shabang flavor and it was still too spicy for me. If you can't handle spicy like me order non-spicy. I love the king crab leg the best. It was juicy. The Cajun sauce was flavorful too.

I will definitely return on my next visit to Las Vegas.

You basically order your seafood of choice, pick a sauce, then pick a heat level.


I like how they have their own cups and bags for to go food. It's a nice touch.

We had a server, Shelly, who was delightful. She pretty much waited on our party of about 7 alone. She checked on us frequently, refilled our drinks often, and we never had to look for her.

The food was good. I got a lb of shrimp in the whole she-bang. This is their three sauces mixed together. It was good over all but I thought it lacked in citrus flavor. I'll definitely get lemon pepper next time as a squirt of lime really made the sauce taster for my pallet. 

I also had some calamari, sweet potato fries, lemon pepper fries, and Cajun fries. It was a cool option to choose spice level on the Cajun fries. I also took some gumbo the go which was delicious.

Overall I enjoyed my first time at boiling crab. Would I return? Yes. The staff I encountered all seemed happy,  our server did a great job, and my food was comparable to hot n juicy.",pZ6P_1V-bTSoYG1fg1TXzw,4,2,4,ewYpZ8zhTdkiQG_fGb8beA

Upon reading the menu we noticed some things had changed. The waitress did mention that the sauce was the biggest change. The whole shabang was more of dry rub versus the liquidy buttery sauce. However, she did mention that if you request for extra sauce, they will add it to your order. 

We had a couple clusters of King crab, 1.5 pounds of shrimp, 1 pound mussel, 1 pound clams, half dozen oysters, corn, rice, and cajun fries. We order everything with the whole shabang sauce because it is the best one out there.

4066071,2018-06-14,0,zcScEL0WEdFkROcnz5379g,"This was my first visit to the venue. The food was pretty good, but there were a few issues that we ran into. We order the king crab legs, shrimp, clams, corn and potatoes in "" no spicy garlic"" flavoring, which was perfect for me since I don't eat spicy foods. The waitress was gracious enough to explain to me that no spicy would be a spicy level of one to two, and be mild spicy would be a level of 4 to 5. My initial inclination was to order 4 to 5 but that would have been way too spicy for me so I'm glad she made the recommendation. (No spicy level of 1 to 2 was perfect for me!) 

The food was delicious! My only complaint was that some of the shrimp was really mushy and just wasn't fresh. Other than that, the rest of the food was really good. A lot of the items on the menu are marked ""MP"" for market price so you really don't know what you're paying for it until the check is issued. We ended up spending $80 on our meal which was pretty average for what I usually pay for seafood boil. 

I definitely would have given this restaurant a 4-star rating if the shrimp would have been more fresh.  Otherwise, I think it really deserves a 3.5 start rating,  that but that wasn't an option. My only other issue, was it was rather difficult to get ahold of our server because the restaurant was so busy and it was so hectic. It reminded me of a cafeteria setting. Also, coming from Atlanta, we usually get our order in one bag so we can easily get a variety of all the seafood ordered, but they didn't have it that way here. Everything came an individual bags and you just kind of had to pick through the bags. When I asked if there was a way I can mix it I was told to just dump it on the table or put all the bags together into one bag. I really didn't want my food sitting on table liner paper so I just left it in the ba. Regardless, it's still definitely worth checking out.",vRB_Rl5MnQrasRHIkXOGfw,0,0,3,6_5OEsnE5_bMJ91n3sikoQ

I love it either non spicy or mild depending on what I feel and I get the ""whole shabang"" flavoring which is a mix of Rajun Cajun, Lemon Pepper, and Garlic Sauce.

Today however, i wasn't feeling up to a pound of shrimp. As I am a fan of their Cajun fries as well, i decided to order their Fried Shrimp Basket. There was a basket of their tasty tasty cajun fries topped with fried shrimp, unfortunately 10, but perhaps you may request more by paying more? Will definitely ask next time. The Fried shrimp was just really good. I requested a mild spice on the shrimp and it was just perfect. I think i just found my favorite order here! lol

Once you walk in, you see a bunch of tables, to your left and right there's a waiting area, when you look further to the windows there are a nice amount of TV's and booths all along the windows about a step high. The furniture and the whole atmosphere kind of gives off a sense of what you think you may see inside a bar/lounge. Well that's how it would be for me at least.

Our waitress was nice, she checked up on us a couple of times, our group arrived at two different times and she came each time someone of our group arrived and got them their drinks. Unfortunately she left while we were just about to finish eating and we left the tip for him instead. But he was nice as well. But feel the tip should be the first waitress.

I kept it super simple and ordered the Chowder with Rice ($8), and a side of seasoned fries ($4). I should have looked at the photos first as the chowder came out in a small take out style container, and didn't even look to be enough for a full serving for an adult.

It's amazing that they can offer you a full pound of seafood with potatoes and corn for under $30. One seafood boil (bag) feeds two.

Pick your sauce and your level of so iciness and you're set. Personally I think you're missing out if you do anything other than the Whole Shabang sauce. And beware because the ""medium"" level spicy is deceiving because it's actually really hot! If you're unsure, get part of your sides marinated in a hotter sauce and dip in as you like.

It's unique because when you enter you see people have left their mark by writing names and dates from when they came.  Something I wish I had done.  But anywho maybe another time.
We sat down and basically you order the type of seafood you want with the level of spicy that you want.  I will warn you that if you don't like spicy DO NOT get any level of spice to ""test"" yourself get the naked!!! Which although is no spice has a slight kick but nothing that will knock you on your butt.
You can also order sides like rice or potatoes.  The rice they put in a side bowl and the potatoes they make in the bag with your seafood. 
It may take you a little while to eat all your food but I promise you it will be worth it.  
I know what your thinking, seafood is expensive.  Well yes it can be but here it's quite affordable even when certain seafood is at market price.
It's a local spot which I highly recommend and yes I know it's only minutes from the strip where there is amazing high end seafood you can taste but hey why pay a fin and a tentacle when you can have affordable seafood? Just saying.

The 3rd time I was there, I was eating and found a ""sick"" looking clam got mixed in the bag, when I opened it it's all black goo inside,  I had clam before but was fine so I just threw away the bad one and continue eating, yup, I had another allergic reaction again that night.  I now highly suspect that I'm allergic to ""dirty"" seafood, or not-so-fresh seafood, I'm afraid to ask the country of origin of the oyster and whatever happen to that clam, but I will never go back there again to risk my pocket and my life.

Oh BTW, I didn't believe I have allergy to oyster so I order raw oyster from a Japanese restaurant, I can clearly tell the quality and the taste of the oyster from Japanese restaurant is so much better, and that night I was totally fine!

We got here around 8 pm on a Saturday night and the hostess just told us that we beat the dinner rush. Yay us! Good sign! After looking at the menu we decided to go with the Shebang Snow Crabs, Lemon Pepper Shrimp, Cajun wings and cajun fries. The server told us that the mild spicy level was about the same as flaming hot cheetoes! Wow, thats super duper spicy to me so we went with the no spicy level. The wings and fries came out first, it was covered in their ""cajun"" powder and I wasn't impressed as there wasn't tons of flavor for being ""cajun."" 

The shrimp and crab came out at the same time. The sauces were red which wasn't what I expected (should have looked through pics first) not necessairly a bad thing. It had sort of a tomato based texture with chunks of their ""cajun spice"" and garlic. The sauces were alright, I just felt that the sauce didn't penetrate through the shrimp and crab. I know that's part of the food experience when you end up dunking them before putting them in your mouth, but it was that bland that you HAD to redunk them in the sauce. Luckily it was just the 2 of us so we could double dip. The shrimp was way over cooked to the point where the shell was so hard to take off. Crab meat was pretty meaty, but without the awesome flavors of the sauce it was just regular crab. I ordered a side of rice and the rice was dry and old...not very appealing. We didn't end up finishing our meal which is surprising seeing as we didn't eat all day. 

Overall, I'm disappointed that I had a not so good experience at this place when everyone hyped it up and said it was better than any other place! Service was good, bathrooms have no paper towels which saves tress, but kind of a hassel. One of my friends recommended that I go back again to give it a second chance, but I won't be for awhile.",sa5zd7bwBQzajQB48Y9SUw,3,2,3,CrtlN1eDiyaIUCADVnRivw

Depending how large your party is and what time you come, the wait can be up to an hour. I have no shame admitting I have waited that long because my friends and I were mentally prepared to do so. 

On this particular visit, our wait was only 5 minutes long (3 people around 9:00PM). Our waitress Amy greeted us and we quickly ordered our food. I ordered a 1lb of shrimp, mild, with the Garlic Seasoning. It's my go to flavor choice and I've never had a bad experience. 

My friends ordered shrimp as well, but with the Whole Shabang Seasoning and a side of mild Cajun fries. I highly recommend sopping up some of your seafood seasoning with your fries for extra flavor!

They've got a much bigger, better location here. It's spacious, with lots of booth and table seating spread out. We got a booth and they put down a large sheet of butcher paper to protect the table during the meal. 

I didn't want to overeat like I always do, so we ordered a pound of shrimp - with the ""all of the above"" seasoning with mild spice - along with an order of corn and 2 orders of red potatoes. Since we were starving, I broke tradition and got an appetizer of the gumbo with rice. 

Gumbo was good, nothing that blew me away. Definitely get it with the rice because it's pretty soupy even with it. Good flavors, a decent amount of shrimp and sausage, but I wouldn't necessarily order it again. 

The shrimp came out with all the goodies in the bag. Corn tastes amazing after it's been soaking in there for a while. Our shrimp were hot & tasty. I think I like Hot & Juicy's seasoning mix a little more - I recall it being a bit more flavorful and savory, but this is just as good. 

I like to cut my potatoes open at the art of the meal so they can cool off a bit, then I dunk the halves into the juices at the bottom of the bag. This is extremely delicious and I recommend you do the same. 

Our server was great, made sure we were well tended to since once you start eating your hands will likely be covered in tasty juices. Unless you bitch out and wear gloves while you eat. Please don't so that; it makes you look weird. Man (or woman) up and eat it like you're supposed to.",4lng77gRdpRb24o91sSihA,4,3,4,41tI82I23G6GnGujSvLcbA

4309388,2012-04-21,12,zcScEL0WEdFkROcnz5379g,"It is a shame that we had to go all the way to Las Vegas to be able to eat at the Boiling Crab on a weekend night without having to wait 2+ hours to be seated.  In Los Angeles the Boiling Crab is crazy popular, and is always packed.  Apparently the Boiling Crab has not received the hype in Las Vegas that it has in Los Angeles.  However, I do feel that the hype is deserved because the food here is just that good!

We arrive to this Boiling Crab last Friday night after spending the whole afternoon driving from LA.  When we pulled up I jumped out of the car to put our group's name down on the wait list while the others parked.  I was shocked when I entered to find no line, and no one waiting.  I asked the hostess how long the wait was, and she told me ""10 minutes.""  I responded in disbelief with an ""excuse me, did you say 10 minutes?!""  After getting over the shock of there being no wait, I headed to the restroom since I had been sitting in a car for hours.  By the time I got back, my group was already seated!  I was AMAZED!

This Boiling Crab location has the same look as the other ones I have been to in LA, but is just bigger...MUCH bigger.  This probably contributes to the wait not being as long here.  The food was identical to what I have had at the LA locations.  Since I have loved the food at the Boiling Crab, I loved the food here as well.  My wife and I split orders of king crab legs, shrimp, sausage and potatoes.  We typically go with the THE WHOLE SHA-BANG seasoning with everything, but changed it up and had the Rajun Cajun with the shrimp, sausage and potatoes.  The Rajun Cajun was good, but it was no WHOLE SHA-BANG.  Truthfully, we just didn't want to overdo the garlic while we were in Vegas, but next time we will go back to what we typically order.

Eating at the Las Vegas Boiling Crab was the best experience I have ever had at a Boiling Crab.  Not having to wait or deal with pushy people waiting in line made dining here what eating out should be about, the food!  If I could, I would give this place more than 5 stars.  Since Yelp won't let me do that, I will say that this Boiling Crab is a must visit place if you are in Las Vegas.",YWWDhFvemd93HKof8D-QoA,21,16,5,nV4jbbRGdxVyEwWSkqsO7A

There was even a time where I was put on a ""no guarantee"" list - pretty much a list where you might not get to eat because it's so busy and they'll close.

As for the LV location, I've never had to wait more than 30 minutes for a table. It's really spacious inside and the workers clear off tables for the next patrons quickly. Make sure your party is all present because they will not seat you if everyone is not there. When they said they count heads, they aren't kidding. Both tables and booths are available. If you're trying to get the best seats for the TV, it doesn't matter where you sit because there's TV's everywhere. 

My typical order is usually a pound of shrimp, the whole sha-bang medium. If I'm really hungry, I'll add some corn and sausages too. An order of the Cajun fries is a must.

The servers are always attentive and quick. I don't think I've ever experienced bad customer service at Boiling crab.

2) Gumbo with rice $6: Dont get this item.  Totally not worth it!! The gumbo was pretty bland that I had to put in a ton of Tabasco to make it taste like anything.  They barely give you any rice (please see the Service note below). 

3) 2 lb. Crawfish (She-Bang seasoning and Med heat) $10/pound:  When the bag was first placed on the table, all you see are super large crawfish soaking in a bath of liquid yumminess.  Then you grab one and is let down that there isn't even a small kick to the Med heat.  And the more you dig in, the more you notice the crawfish are smaller and smaller.  Yes i understand that it is still by weight so its not like you're getting cheated... but I want big ones and that's that!!

FOOD (2nd round of orders): 
1) Chicken Tender with Fries (XXX heat) $7:  The chicken tenders aren't anything special and the pieces are not large (but at least they weren't small lol).  Same fries except the XXX seasoning was all heat and no taste.  

2) 2 lb. Crawfish (She-Bang seasoning and XXX heat) $10/pound: So i should have explain their heat level earlier - the XXX is suppose to be the hottest one as its stated on the menu ""Cant feel my mouth"" and the level right above that is the Med... They need to figure out something to go in between the Med and XXX.  The XXX was indeed spicier then the Med but if you're a restaurant you should know that a hot level should still mean you maintain the taste of your food! 

There was so much cayenne/chili pepper in the dry XXX heat that you couldn't taste any of the food.  All you get is a coating of dry power that overwhelm your taste buds.  

I would like to make a point that is probably not that important but for me I feel like its something worth noting... They only give you one corn when you purchase at least 2lb. bag of crawfish. Which is fine... but where is the potato!?!? Yes I know this isnt Hot n' Juicy... but where is it!?!?!

SERVICE:
Where should I start... So our server didnt introduce himself so i'm only assuming his name is Spencer since it was on our check which may not be correct since half way through another waiter assisted us. 

He wasnt really friendly as we had to ask about pricing for everything.  I'm sorry, if I'm inquiring about pricing, wouldn't you assume i would like to be inform and you should be nice to let me know instead of me having to pull teeth????

Our waiter talked my fiance out of ordering the XXX the first time around, which is 
fine and we took it as friendly advice.  However, when we got our Med heat orders we wanted something spicier, we asked if we can get a small side of the dry XXX seasoning so we can get more kick.  We were told he cant do that but if we wanted to order something else such a side order of corn, I can get the corn in a big soaked with liquid XXX sauce... great so if I want to season my food to my liking, you're going to make me buy more... right... This annoys me the most since he was the one convincing us not to order the XXX in the first place.  

Anyway moving on... I ordered the Gumbo with Rice and I didnt get gumbo with rice.  The whole reason for going to Boiling Crab was cause I was craving rice with lots of sauce!  And what could satisfy my craving for saucey rice?? Gumbo! but nope, didnt even hit the stop.  I had to stop another waiter and tell her that I didnt get my correct order.  Instead of just bringing me a cup of rice, she takes my whole cup back to the kitchen and comes back with it...when i get my cup back, it looked like someone took 1 spoonful of rice and dumped it in.  I didnt realize rice was such an expensive item that I cant even get more than 1 spoonful.  

So after all this interaction, our waiter comes by and ask us how we were doing.  My fiance being the nice guy that he is says everything is great where I said things werent so good.  I'm pretty sure our waiter thought I was being sarcastic since my comment came after my fiance and it assume it was though ""oh its awful but i'm still stuffing my face that's its obviously amazing food""... nope, I didnt say it like that or mean it like that.  He just walks off like nothing happened.  

So i'm writing this review a few hours after my visit to Boiling Crab... and in our group only three of us had their ""fresh"" crawfish... and now all three of us arent feel so well.  

That sums up my extremely delight experience and will never stop back in that place and any of their other locations.  EVER.",pHnTiqjkLajb3UdoUg3f8w,5,0,1,h3B2sVQvJ6BnrfPWdS_ROg

Location - it's located in the Food 4 Less shopping center. Lots and lots of parking is a plus. 
 
Service - awesome! Although the place is humongous, everyone is attentive and they always check up on you. They also don't make a big fuss about splitting checks with big parties. I know it's a hassle, but they've always been accommodating and say it's not a problem.   

Food - yum! I think I've had almost everything on the menu and nothing's disappointed me. I always get the whole shabang medium and it's the perfect amount of butter, garlic, and spice. I hate getting messy, but the sauce is finger licking good.
Shrimp is nice and plump. King crab is meaty! Crawfish isn't my thing, too much work for such little meat. Oysters are fresh and sweet! All their fried stuff is super crispy, just the way I like it. Like their Cajun & sweet potato fries and Cajun chicken wings. The wings were bigger than expected.

Atmosphere - I like the openness to it. They play good music, there's so many TVs, and they accommodate large groups. It gets loud and pretty busy, but I like that about Boiling Crab.

Food: Like I said... YUMMMM, only thing i'd change which has been bothering me is.. the SHRIMP. I think they over boil it because MAYBE ITS JUST ME. But every time I go I have a hard time peeling the shrimp. The skins stuck on the shrimp, this only happens when shrimp is OVER BOILED when cooked. 

Price: Its actually cheaper than Hot & Juicy I believe, when I went a pound of shrimp was 9.99 apposed to hot & juicys at 10.99. I know $1 wow but I notice I spend a lot less at boiling crab than at hot & juicy. Maybe its ust me",iS4NVHLQDt1IzmmMKqwy5A,2,1,4,okQaVr6lKyA36ooW3YBjog

The main reason I didn't like this particular Boiling Crab was due to the sauce. The sauce is not as flavorful, the consistency is more watery, and there usually is not enough of it. The shrimp and seafood were cooked well, but if the sauce isn't delicious then what's the point, right?

Overall, the staff was friendly and the rest of the items like the Cajun fries were decent. I probably won't be back again since there are lots of Cajun seafood joints in Vegas. I guess the next time I'll be at a Boiling Crab will be in Cali!",9FT7TtB8S4u1PwjkZmizkw,0,1,3,WpniATYajrS3iaHCz-hrTw

4464606,2017-06-07,0,zcScEL0WEdFkROcnz5379g,"Server (also named A-A-Ron) is the all star here. We were super happy with our experience here... mostly. Seriously THE ONLY DOWNSIDE I personally experienced was the humbling realization that I can't even handle ""mild"" spice. I cried a little bit. Inside and out. Yet, it didn't stop me because the food was so good anyway. 

Go in knowing this place is going to be a mess. The establishment itself is pretty nice and they do a good filtration job not to make it smell like a sea food market to my surprise. But you are given a dorky looking bib for a simple reason... you're going to need it.

We got ourselves a full pound of shrimp, an order of potatoes, and three orders of corn on the cob paired with two blue moons to drink and cups of water to drink on. It costed us barely $40. That was not a bad night. 

Now, for the recommendation... get ""The Whole Shebang"" flavoring. It is nearly impossible not to be satisfied with your choice. It was FANTASTIC. The potatoes we weren't all that excited about. They were just potatoes. But the corn on the cob saturated in that flavor was to die for. The shrimp comes in that natural state where you have to physically peel all the shell off yourself but it is amazing none the less.  So so good. You can choose your grade of spice between 1-4. I chose a #2 (mild) and I was hurting. Granted, I'm accountably a bag of wuss. So find out for yourself, don't take my word for it. 

If you're of age, get a beer with it. It pairs really well with the experience and takes some of the fire away from your mouth, which was a nice saving grace. 

I will end note this with the fact that we went on a Monday in the early evening (around 6pm or so), and there was not much of a line at all but I have left this place several attempts because the line is SUPER long and they don't take reservations over the phone. It's kind of a first come first serve kind of thing. Which on one end, I get. But from a guest perspective... come on lol. Consider it. It will make most of your guests very happy, I promise.

Compared to Hot and Juicy for spice levels The Boiling Crab is just a tick lower. Service was generally good the servers came by often enough that our sodas rarely ran dry and checked up if we needed anything.

My Fried Oysters [3.5/5] were cooked pretty good.  They came with a Sriacha type sauce that was waaaaayyy too sweet, but luckily I ordered the tarter sauce on the side already. 
Then I tried the Gumbo [4/5] which was surprisingly tasty. It had a little bit too much of a spice I could not place, but it was still good. Glad it actually had okra in it, and they served it popping hot!

No utensil unless requested. No plates. Just a wooden table with a sheet of wax paper on it, a bib on your belly, a pile of lemon wedges in the middle of the table (again, no plate) and that's it. Then they bring plastic bags of hot succulent, fresh, plump, perfect craws! Lobsters too! King Crab legs! Dungeness! Shrimp! The seasoning and spice levels can be mixed and matched.

The spices on the Gulf shrimp and the clams were very good. It was not that hot for me though. I prefer spicy foods, so it may be hot for some people. The fried oysters were also very good. The raw oysters they serve are from the Gulf of Mexico. I prefer cold water oysters, but these were excellent. The fried shrimp were good, but small. The king crab and the fried calamari were good too.

The only complaints I have is that they do not have metal forks to shell the shrimp, so it is a tedious task with the sauce all over the shrimp. It makes it difficult to shell with your fingers or the plastic fork they give you. Next visit I will have to bring my own fork. They also have Green Mussels that are not on the menu. They were good, but they were not cooked long enough and the mussels did not open.

I will definitely be back. I look forward to trying the other items on the menu. I would recommend this place if you enjoy seafood.",aD263WOD4RShoqgvVhcKqQ,4,2,4,so-ngdzqIij_wqToPKxmKQ

The premise is exactly the same--you order seafood in 1-pound increments, you choose a sauce type and spice level, it comes out in a plastic bag, and you go to town. The sauces are named differently, but just like HnJ, I go for the one that mixes everything together i.e. ""The Whole Sha-Bang.""

If there's one thing BC has over HnJ, it's that the space is much more, well, spacious. You could probably fit more people in BC than both Vegas HnJ locations combined. Also, it's a minor thing, but I like the napkin dispensers at BC better than HnJ--when your digits are covered in sauce, it's much easier to grab a napkin at BC.

I don't typically eat spicy, so I always go with the non-spicy option and it's still super flavorful. Try adding corn, sausage, and potatoes in your bag (you can also get it in a separate bag).

4657309,2013-02-03,0,zcScEL0WEdFkROcnz5379g,"Came here around 6pm with a party of four to celebrate birthdays: mine and my boyfriend's dad's. I often frequent the Alhambra and Garden Groove locations in SoCal so I was pleasantly surprised when I was promptly seated on a Saturday night. 

This location is spacious with both booths and tables. Even when we left, there was only one party waiting. Last week in LA, my friends came around the same time on a week night and we easily waited an hour. Wait time is my biggest obstacle between me and my crawfish. The service was great. In LA, the servers just seem a little more frazzled. 

Last summer, I tried Hot N Juicy on my way home from Yellowstone. I was wary of the mixed reviews but had a good experience with good service. But I remember telling my best friend that Boiling Crab was better because the sauce had more garlic and more flavor. 

We ordered 2 lbs of crawfish and 1lb of clams, both mild with garlic sauce. The only thing you can order a half pound of its the shrimp. I counted about 18 clam shells which was much more than I thought we would get for 1lb. I have defaulted to mild now, which surprisingly still slightly has spice. 

Everyone I know gets the Whole Shebang seasoning but my boyfriend and I both agree that you can't discern the different flavors. To us, the flavors become muddy. I don't know why ""garlic butter"" is now ""garlic sauce"" but it's my go-to seasoning. The garlic chunks were softer at this location than the socal ones. This wasn't necessarily bad, it was just different. 

My boyfriend's dad was devouring the crawfish at a rapid rate. Seems like I picked the perfect place for us to celebrate his birthday. His mom had fun taking pictures of the restaurant, especially the hanging shark wearing a bib. She even took a bib as a souvenir. They asked me to send then the address so I'm thinking they like this place as well. 

FYI: Even though you can write on the wooden walls (good luck finding any empty space), there is a sign mentioning the $100 fine for writing on the booths, floors, off tables.",exWfJBRKvl5dyBpDnRC6FA,0,1,5,sen9gXMXF_p2zOVCi480xw

4676829,2017-08-29,1,zcScEL0WEdFkROcnz5379g,"I've always heard good things about TBC (The Boiling Crab) and I've also enjoyed my experience at TBC Honolulu, Hawaii. So the experience I had here this evening with my family was a big disappointment and we actually regretted spending our time and money here tonight. 

Let's start with the restrooms, I'm a stickler for restroom hygiene...it's very important that not only is the facility clean, but also that it is well stocked! During our wait (1 hour wait) I went to the restroom to accompany someone and I just stood in the open space in front of the sinks, I noticed the floor was wet, there was a broken soap dispenser and no hand towels (only hand blowers! Gross! We all know that dispensers atomize germs). My cousin came out and told me the trash in the stall was full and there was trash on the ground too. 

I went to the restroom a second time to wash my hands before dinner (15 minutes after the first time), the restroom was still in the same state. 

The third time came after dinner which was probably an hour after getting seated...this time there was no soap left in the only working dispenser. My cousin's complained that there were no sanitary toilet covers and no toilet paper rolls in the stalls.

You would think that they would check the restroom every two hours or have a regular scheduled spot check for the restock of the restrooms. Obviously, they don't. 

So that was pretty much my rant about the restrooms, the other disappointment came when they did not inform us that there were no disposable bibs and gloves for us to use. The bibs weren't too much of a problem since we were in casual attire. However, the gloves were important for my husband to have. He suffers from psoriasis and the skin on his hands crack from dryness, he has to constantly apply a medicinal cream to the skin on his hands. If the juices from the sauce or the food get into the cracks of his skin, it causes severe discomfort and stinging, also the cream should not be ingested. If he knew that there were no gloves, we would have chosen an entirely different place for dinner. Unfortunately, the servers said they don't have gloves and instead offered plastic bags. The bags were not practical substitutes for gloves as he wouldn't be able to pinch the legs off of the shrimp. This was very inconvenient. Also, when your party has to repeatedly ask for water that's usually not a good thing. 
My husband was upset that he was not able to fully enjoy his meal and even more upset that I had to peel his seafood for him, since he wanted me to enjoy my meal too. I didn't mind peeling his seafood for him, but he insisted on speaking to the management to let them know about his experience. 

In the end, the manager could only offer plastic bags. My husband was nice about it and didn't argue, but he made the manager aware that this upset him. I'd like to tell the manager to peel his 1/2 lb of shrimp and 1 lb of crab with those plastic bags within the same time frame that his family enjoys their meals. His family would surely be waiting around for him to finish. 

Overall, we all agreed (10 adults) our experience was so dissatisfying that we would never waste our time and money here again.",9VljRRFnivDCtc2gDaJsNg,2,0,1,sfyIX0s1MiaH1yD-nS9kGw

When choosing a flavor for your bag of crustaseans or friends, ""the whole shebang"" is a must. It's a blend of lemon, garlic and cajun..YUM. Trust me, you'll never go back to one flavor once you've had that.

The sauce was certainly garlicky, but it lacked that delicious punch that makes you crave more heat.

As for the restaurant itself, it is spacious and littered with (small) TV's.  Lots of seating available, both tables and booths.  Walking in, it was nice to not be overwhelmed by the smell of their special sauces, probably due to the large space.  During my visit there were several large groups that came by, and there was no issue with seating 20 or so people together.

We tried the ""whole shebang"" sauce which is a mixture of their lemon pepper, garlic and Cajun sauces. This is a definite must try sauce, it was spicy, buttery and garlicky all at the same time. I had the mild version, which was still pretty spicy. So be careful with the spice level as it is spicier than you would think. Also, don't turn down using the bib or you will be sorry!

One thing I need to mention is that I found the pricing system a bit confusing. I had the waiter explain the system to me, and it seemed to help but I was not really sure until I got the bill. My best explanation is that they charge per pound, but most things are not served by the pound. For instance, the crab legs were around .8 or .9 lb a serving, but they give you the pricing for 1 lb. Some items are more than 1lb, like the lobster and whole crab. I will attach a picture of the receipt so it is clearer. 

 My second question was, how much food do I order? I am not used to ordering food in this fashion. So for 2 people, we had 3 seafood items, corn on the cob and 1 basket of fries.

The center is anchored by a grocery store and non-descript shops that you might find in any city. We may have been the only out-of-state customers who ventured over to this section of town. The clientele was primarily Asian and Hispanic. 

We had a great experience. I ordered shrimp, snow crab legs, corn, and potatoes in the Whole Sha-bang sauce and medium heat. The seafood was cooked just right and the seasoning was great. I thought the seasoning was a bit saltier and less buttery than H n J's.  I missed out on ordering a bowl of rice, but that would have been perfect for extending the amazing Sha-bang. Service was excellent. The wait staff were all young people, and they were polite and friendly.",loHW3nLm8Ex5BbCu7QOVaA,2,3,4,zTIyF0f6_2hllQm4FlNZjg

HnJ took the cake, but I did enjoy my meal so much here!  I ordered crab legs here and they were very good.  Not as juicy as I like, but still good.  And they were a bit tougher to crack open.  I ordered mild and that cleared my sinus since my allergies were out of control that day.  I also ordered Cajun fries, which I couldn't stop eating.  The seasoning is just right and had a nice kick.  Pricing is market price, so it fluctuates often.  They do, however charge for everything, water is .25 cents and all the sides-potatoes, corn, sauces cost extra as well.

Something that I really look for when I'm out is customer service and that was one of the down falls.  I ordered 1lb of crab legs, and while I was eating I wanted more, so I ordered more.  A worker came by and asked how we were doing.  I asked for another pound and she said ok.  Time rolls by- no legs.  Our waitress came by and I told her I ordered more and she said they were ready, but no one tagged it to my table, so they sent it back.  So I had to wait even longer, and by the time they landed on my table, everyone was done eating.  They were super friendly, though.

The restaurant is fairly large and open, which is good considering the aromas floating around.  I love places laid back places.  Plus, you eat with your hands.  They have TV's around for entertainment and scribbles on the wood panels.  On the way to the restroom I passed a beam with people I knew which put a smile on my face.

Well, I guess I should write again anyway since my review of them has changed. 

For those that lived in California, the name ""Boiling Crab"" goes hand in hand with being known as the best place in the west to get Louisiana style crawfish. I also visited their southern California restaurant when ever I visited that area.

When Boiling Crab opened their first restaurant in Las Vegas, I was one of the first to try. Their seasoning is the same as any other Boiling Crab places, but the similarity stopped here.

A few months after their grand opening, I visited their places a few more times and got disappointed more and more. Unlike their CA restaurants, the quality of their seafood at their LV restaurant was not fresh. There were several times where I bit into the shrimp that was either rotten or spoiled.  

I do realize not many people were aware of their restaurant yet and it will take time to reach the capacity that they have in CA. That doesn't mean that they should keep and served rotten shrimp. Doing this will mean losing customers, not gaining.

I, for one, will go back to Hot N Juicy when I'm in LV, but will definitely go to their Boiling Crab restaurant when I visited Santa Ana.",Xr63tSoQeUWpgdzSIQnFYA,1,0,2,kbazcU_c5e4JBTicRVedGg

Waiting for 20 minutes and I heard the host asking the people before if a table is okay I am guessing its because most asks for a booth!

They changed their menu from the last time I was there (prices)
I always get the shrimp, I like it mild with rice on the side (asian here).
There's probably 15-20 pieces in there and man you'll be full!
Sweet tea has an after taste to it, I don't know what that is but I liked it (hopefully that's a good thing).

If I had reviewed them on my visit before this last one, I would have given them 5 stars, however they fell quite short on this last visit and unfortunately I've only become obsessed with Yelping recently.

The service was great.  We got seated right away despite it being pretty busy.  The server was attentive and nice, although they didn't bib us, to my great disappointment.  In fact, they brought out all our food before giving us bibs so then they had to bring them out and we put them on hurriedly while holding back from salivating all over the table. 

My number one complaint is the food.  I ordered shrimp and king crab legs with the Whole Shabang sauce.  It had been a while since I had eaten there but I remember the taste of the Whole Shabang sauce like it was yesterday.  The sauce from the other night was NOT the same.  It was tasteless, like the chef forgot to put salt in.  I had coat my seafood with lime juice and use the salt and pepper shaker.  The shrimp were a little overcooked and tough.  

On the bright side, the meat from the crab legs were tender and yummy but it just wasn't enjoyable because the sauce lacked flavor.  I was severely disappointed because since my friend and I had nailed down our plans the night before, I had been dreaming of that delicious stinky salty spicy flavor and it just wasn't what I had built up in my mind.

I first thought this would be a rip off HnJ type of joint. But after reading the yelpers reviews, I knew I had to try it.

1.  Parking - A lot more parking selection compared to HnJ locations!

2. Seating - Hella lot more room at this place and therefore, they are able to handle many more people, size of parties.  This is an added plus.

3.  Service - Just like HnJ, very friendly staff. The only difference i notice is that here, it seems like low down fun and being part of the fun and at HnJ, it seems to be all about the ""cult"" of HnJ.  Both very cool, good staff, just had a good time here

4.  Food - We had the Shrimp, Crawfish, Filet of Fish, Sausage and Corn on the Cob, Sweet Potato Fries.  All I can say is WOW.  We had guests from Atlanta and from Rome, Italy with us and they absolutely loved it.  That is saying alot in the great seafood capital of Rome and how much our guests loved this place.

5.  So Casual - I love the low down shorts and flip flop style relaxation mode of this place!

6.  Ambiance - From the multitude of TV Screens showing plenty of sports, to the wood paneled walls where you can scribble on and do your graffiti, the place hits the spot when it comes to creating the perfect ambiance to get down and dirty with some serious shellfish.

GK says this place is pretty awesome and check it out.",owlUazXSDLaxlOV7z8181g,6,3,4,EnCqbaGPj5JFw5ETjcIJxw

The seafood is fresh, no complaints thus far and the service is quick; which I love! I tried the calamari rings this trip and omg they were huge rings and equally amazing; I even dipped them into the sauce because I'm extra like that.

I'm from SoCal, so I'm no stranger to this chain.  A friend swears they have the best (cajun) fries, and I can't argue with that... yet.

If you've never had crawfish, and you're in Vegas and wanting to try something new, this is a great place to wet your beak.  It's a little off the strip, so be forewarned.  The place is huge, and there are plenty of small TV's (though crappy quality, I never made a note in my phone about what brand).

Many people like the shrimp, cause you get more meat for your buck.  But crawfish has a unique flavor, and I do recommend getting a pound to play with.  Yes, it's a lot of work for such a small morsel of meat, but it's more of an socializing activity for me than a dining experience.  A beer goes well with the spice.

Arvin T swears the snow crab is the best.  He also raves about their sweet tea... idk why, I tasted his and it was ok.  But then again, maybe he knows his sweet tea, so give it a go if you're a fan.",-2UOdDlzg7XLuUuyOrldhA,1,1,3,TyYURtKeKnp0yTyzHzmsJw

The two Crabs were complete strangers from a different shore.  BC Koreatown's Sha-Bang sauce had more.. Sha-Bang!  Twice as flavorful, garlicy, oniony, salty, tasty!  BC LV's Sha-Bang was lacking the Bang Bang.. the sauce was bland and watered down.  I guess that's what you get from seafood served in the desert.

I have developed an acquired taste for BC LV and have dismantled my fanfare for BC Koreatown.  BC LV had become my official rebound.  If you are dining at BC.. I suggest ordering all three seperate flavors on your choice of crustacean and then try the Sha-Bang just so your options stay open (cuz u know what they say.. ""once you go 'Sha-Bang' you'll never go back."").  All the fried goods are mighty delish.  The fried Catfish and Oysters are always a good side dish.. it changes the game a 'bit for when things get a little too saucy.  Never go riceless.. the rice will balance the sodium imbalanced meal.

We arrived on a Monday!! 
 and set out..The place is big! plenty of tables and booths and NO LINES!!! NO WIATING! The staff greeted us at the door and lead us to a booth. SHe covered the table with a long sheet of paper aand put bibs around our necks and gave us the run down of the menu...But, I already menu...I've been looking at it online for days!

We ordered 1 lb shrimp, 1 lb crab legs, 1 lb crawfish all smothered in SHABANG SAUCE! I also had them trow in corn and potatoes. Hubby had fried catfish basket wi cajun fries. 

I must say when all of that yumminess came to our table..we pounced on it as if ...we were waiting for weeks to try it!!

THe shrimp were big and juicy, the crawfish and crab legs equally good. Love the Shabang sauce the seasoning is deep, flavorful, garlicy sauce with a kick. The catfish basket included 5 nice size pieces andwell cooked fries with cajun seasoning.

We loved this meal so much, we came back again on Thursday! This time we had Shrimp (again...that good!), fried oysters and calamari, with potatoes and corn in the yummy shabang sauce!! 

The food is so good, I guess I will have to go to the L.A. restaurant...and wait!

Boiling crab is a nicer version of Hot & Juicy (can I say that?)  The place is much roomier and feels cleaner.

Every time I go there, the service isn't all that great.  Tons of teenagers sort of just hanging out.  We never really get much attention and never have one dedicated server.  There are a couple of really great servers, but a majority... EH.  One time, I had to get up from my seat all the way in back and walk to the very front to ask for a drink.  Not that fun when your wearing a bib and your hands (and probably face) are smeared with gunk.

Anyway, the food is pretty good.  The shrimp is typically pretty large.  A pound is enough for me to share with my husband.  Love the added on corn on the cob and sausage (half pound addition is plenty!).  I did have one time where the shrimp was so overcooked it was impossible to peel is cleanly, but normally its pretty awesome.  For $9.99, I would say that the value isn't bad!

$14.99 buys you a pound of snow crab legs.  I really hate paying for snow crab legs when I know I can have as much as I want at a buffet... but one night we were really craving it.  Verdict - not worth it.  Overpriced and despite it being soaked in spices, bland.  

I recommend getting the whole shebang in medium (its plenty spicy!)  Its the perfect blend of spicy garlicky goodness.

Do try the cajun fries (so worth it!).  I haven't been able to try any of their other fried stuff yet, but looking fwd to it.

First, you choose your seafood. Second, how many pounds. Third, you choose the flavor. Lastly, you order some yummy cajun fries, squirt ketchup all over your newly papered table--then they tie a 'baby bib' around your neck and you are seriously READY to make a big big mess on your table! 

But usually, since I don't like to always look like some crazy food addict, I call in my order to-go and pick it up so that I can just eat like a lunatic in my own home. Or you call your family members and make the mess at their house ;)

My favorite thing to do is order a pound of shrimp or crab or crawfish (if you like it) in the Whole Shebang sauce and call it a night! Also, when I eat in the restaurant, me and my cousin like to order fresh oysters--which are super yummy and not dirty tasting here!

After you are done, your stomach will be thanking you.

Always having it in the back of my mind I got into a conversation with a fellow co-worker about this crawfish crazed place. I also noticed it had two locations on Spring Mountain Rd. so they must be doing something right. He convinced me to skip the hype and go straight for the Boiling Crab. I had already visited Crab Corner so I figured it was going to be similar in style.

I call our night at the Boiling Crab, ""Crustaecean Annihilation"". It was great! We had a pound of crawfish and shared a dungeoness Crab - he was massive!

The place is spacious. not like its counterpart. There are plenty of televisions around the room with lots of sports, news, etc. Something's on for everyone if that's your speed. There are different styles of seating, long bench or more intimate booths. Great place for groups!

The cajun flavoring was perfect and the spice level was exactly how it was promised. You choose from various sauces served and then you choose your spice level. The crustaceans are delivered to your table in a plastic bag with it seeped in the juices and flavors you chose. You eat straight out of the bag right on the table. No plates or cutlery at this place. Feast hardcore, hands in. Start cracking and sucking away. I almost licked the bag it came in. ALMOST!

Service was a little shotty, our waitress was all over the place. But this fact simply can be overlooked as she was sweet and had good intentions for the most part.

If you shy away from eating the shellfish suckers, they even offer seafood gumbo, fried fish choices and nice sides like sweet potato fries, corn etc. It's a fun experience for all age groups. And its super casual and fairly priced.

Coming from California, The Boiling Crab franchise is a tried and tested brand for us, it is in our rotation of places we like to eat at. Yesterday was our very first time trying the Las Vegas location. I like how the place is very spacious but still has that Cali vibe, and that huge ceiling fan they had in the middle of the room made me giggle I didn't know why. Huge plus is not having to wait so long, I don't know if that was a fluke and that we were there before the dinner rush started but when you're used to having to wait at the very least 45 minutes in their CA locations, it was a welcome change for us.

Since we're creatures of habit, we tend to order the same things we like: Shrimp in mild sha-bang sauce ($11.99/Lb), Fried shrimp basket with Cajun fries ($10), chicken tender basket with lemon pepper fries ($7), Corn ($0.75/each), steamed rice ($2), sweet potato fries ($4) and instead of our normal Alaskan King crab legs we opted to try the Snow crab legs ($18/Lb) 

Food was still good although I noticed the slight difference in the sauce, it wasn't as concentrated and didn't have pieces of garlic as the one in Cali. Service was a tad slow and our waitress only refilled our drinks once and never gave us lemons even after we settled our bill when we requested lemons to take that smell off your fingers that sticks even after you've washed your hands 3 times. I'm sure we'll be back when the mood strikes but there's so much places I'd rather try.",JqjAthJThuVYgTh4iWDZ2A,10,5,3,eiREM-lxLdNbAGSr5c-6Jw

5100329,2012-02-07,0,zcScEL0WEdFkROcnz5379g,"BOILING CRAB vs. HOT & JUICY

Essentially, the experience is the same. You order seafood by the pound. They drench it in a sauce and serve it in a bag on your table. I don't really like this kind of food. I wouldn't have cravings for it. But after experiencing both, I prefer Boiling Crab over Hot & Juicy for a number of different reasons. 

LOCATION: Close to my house! at Flamingo & Decatur in the Food4Less shopping center. The restaurant is HUGE. 2-3 times the size of H&J with much higher ceilings. Unlike H&J, you can smell the food but there's enough fresh breathing air at BC for everyone. 

SEAFOOD: You have the option of choosing fresh or frozen crawfish. The fresh is supposed to taste a little better at double the cost but the frozen is much larger. We got the frozen and I didn't think anything bad of it except one or two of the buggers had an awful ocean taste (the bad kind). Shrimp can be ordered in half-lb increments (the ones we got were overcooked). 1 lb of Snow Crab is 5 legs and some body. Definitely need at least 1 lb / person if your doing crab.

SAUCE: We tried a variety of the sauces. Lemon Pepper, Cajun, and the whole sha-bang. We went with all Mild heat. H&J has a tendency to be ridiculously spicy (as in heat) even when you order Mild. The Medium over there killed me! The sauce at BC was wonderful. The Sha-Bang was definitely my favorite. Full of flavor and spice, heavy on the garlic, but not to hot. I'll probably go Medium the next time I come. 

SIDES: Freshest fresh oysters in Vegas! They were tasty, meaty, and had a healthy gloss to them. I could've eaten a whole dozen myself! The ones I've received at H&J in the past were subpar quality and not that great. And what's not to like about sweet potato fries? 

SERVICE: We had a few different people serving us. Luckily, there were no mistakes on our order and everyone was pretty friendly. H&J servers aren't attentive and they always get something wrong. 

DRINKS: No liquor license yet. Its coming though. I hear 25 cents for a cup of water?  We ordered iced tea. But they've got sweet tea as well.

PRICES: We got 1/2 lb shrimp, 1 lb crawfish, 1 lb snow crab, sweet potato fries, dozen oysters, and 2 iced teas. Bill was $25 per person. Not bad!

H&J / BC really isn't my type of food. But if my friends want some buttery cajun seafood then I'd pick Boiling Crab over other places.

5102406,2012-05-26,0,zcScEL0WEdFkROcnz5379g,"I had been wanting to try this place out for a long time. I love Hot N' Juicy, but they are considerably more expensive than this place. 

I will give you a couple of tips -

The price is more expensive at Hot N' Juicy, but the tasty and quality is much better. 
You still reek of garlic for at least 24 hours after leaving this place. 

We ordered, 1lb each of the following -
Dungeness Crab (this is a whole crab, and it is typically 2lbs or more)
King Crab 
Snow Crab
Clams

The only thing you'll get close to a pound is the clams. Everything else will be as close to a pound as possible. 
We also had 2 rounds of beers and our tab was a little over $100. That is a very reasonable price for as much as we got. 
I always recommend getting all of the flavors. The medium is pretty spicy, and I enjoy very spicy things. So if you like hot, get medium to hottest. 

The flavor here is good, but could be better. Also, a couple of legs for the kind crab were over cooked, so it made is very difficult to get it out. As much as you pay for a pound for King crab, it's very frustrating if it's not cooked properly. 
I did enjoy this place, and the service was good. I will probably go back, but I would always compare it to Hot N' Juicy's quality, but not complain about the price.",-xDW3gYiYaoeVASXywTPgw,9,3,3,chGTi8P1VAkZRr51kShL4A

Oh wait, this is a review for Boiling Crab!

I've been here but once, but they earned the 5 star-nage with the decor, the ambience, and the food.

Decor - Wood everywhere, and written all over, paper covering the tables with a general sea-faring-ish attitude.  Profess your love for seafood, represent your area code, write whatever you want, just remember to follow the posted writing rule and that this is a family establishment.  Keep it clean!  

Ambience - TVs playing sports, noisy, the sounds of people sucking crawfish and shrimp heads, licking their fingers, wearing bibs and just generally getting down and dirty with their food?  Me likey!  See that paper on the table?  That's your plate, that's your whole tables' plate.  I'm sorry, you wanted a what?  A F-who?  Oh, a fork!  What the f*ck is that for?  Your food came in a plastic bag, ya know.

Food - The whole Sha-Bang, Triple X.  That sounds like an all-inclusive sex resort, but no, that's the seasoning and level of hotness that I got for my meal.  Full flavored with little chunks of garlic and soaking in all it's glory, the crawfish and shrimp were cooked perfectly and were so delectable that when I was done, the bag looked just like new!  You could have re-used it!  Or not.  

Seriously, if you love seafood like I love seafood, this is the place to throw down like there's no tomorrow.  If I was being forced to eat myself to death, I'd ask for a plane ticket to Vegas, and a bottle of Jameson 18 year to go with this last meal.",tQOVsJoOYwoPMIGkkPIfDA,4,2,5,7bc-k2HuU9_4SEzh2pM_2w

Surprisingly the wait here is not that long compared to the ones in SoCal and I'm assuming its due to the fact it really hasn't caught on yet in LV since it has just opened.  Plenty of seating, flatscreen tvs for my LAKERS and 49ers games, walls that you can tag on, and good service.

I come here to order my usual whole shaBang (all the flavors in one) in medium spice level, smothered on my shrimp and crawfish, cajun fries, oysters, and I can't forget my rice which I top off with the shaBang sauce as well.  Make sure you ask for lime, salt and pepper to add a kick to the flavor.

Service is pretty good, you will be helped by multiple people, not just one.  I did have to ask for refills, but that is partially my fault for ordering XXX and drinking like a fish lol.

If you have never eaten at a place like this, the atmosphere is kind of disturbing.  When you walk in, all the tables are covered with scratch paper like they used to do for us in art class when we were 5yrs old.  Everywhere you see, people eating an unimaginable amount of seafood in plastic bags.  And no where to put the shells, except right onto the table next to your food.  I REALLY wish they did the empty bucket thing like at Joes crab shack (not nearly as good food wise, just stating the idea) so that you could discard and keep clean.  Maybe I am pretentious.

So now that I got that outta the way, how is the food?  Must be good to still get the 5 star review lol.

The food is amazing.  The prices are fair, and the sauces are packed with flavor.  I LOVE hot food...I ordered the XXX, and I admit, this was hot.  I will keep my Thai food and others as hot as possible, but this XXX was actually a little distracting...I will order XX from now on.  We always order the ""all of the above"" seasoning, although it becomes a little salty towards the finish line.

The crab is very good, I have tried pretty much all the varieties, as well as the shrimp and crawfish.   I'd probably say I enjoy the shrimp the most.  I really like the corn, how they toss it in the bag with the seafood...best corn ever.  We usually order a basket of fries as well, since they are large enough to share and fill in the gaps between seafood bites.

The lady responds with an irritated attitude saying, ""No you just hung up on him (referring to the first guy that put me on hold) but what would you like in your order?!"" Again I explained I didn't hang up instead I was asked to be out on hold. She instantly denies that happened and told me he was ready to take my order upon calling... WHAT THE HECK?!

If you don't mind getting down and dirty with you hands, then this a place for you. I usually come here for their shrimp alone because it's my favorite and I'm on a Keto diet. If you want your shrimp to have full of flavor, go for THE WHOLE SHA-BANG which is a mixture of cajun, lemon pepper and garlic sauce. It's heaven in your mouth! Lastly, you can choose how spicy you want it and I normally do mild which just gives it a nice kick which is not overwhelmingly spicy. It's perfection! It's served in a bag with the sauce and you can also request to add other items in the bag such as potatoes or corn. To add some additional flavor, you can request for lime, salt and pepper or butter to dip your nicely seasoned shrimp. Whichever dipping sauce you prefer, it compliments the flavor so well and adds a little bit of heaven in your taste buds.

In addition to the food always being so delicious, the service here is also top notch for me. They're always fully staffed and everyone is very friendly. They always recognize you coming in and out. The servers are consistently checking up on your table making sure they're tending to  your needs. 

I've never had a bad experience whenever I come here. However, due to it being the only location in town, make sure to check their peak hours as you could wait as long as 45 minutes if you come here during their peak times. When you do check in, they won't seat you until your whole party is there so keep that in mind.

Loved how they give you a bunch of sliced limes so you can add some lime juice to our bags - don't add too much though because it can get sour. But overall the sauces are really good, super flavorful. 

I also tried the King Crab - do not get this. This was just really bad. Crab legs weigh quite a lot, we only got 3 legs for the pound that we paid for. Worst part is, the legs and skinny and have no meat! The shells are so soft you can't even use the crab cracker to crack the legs open. This is a total waste of money. It's actually funny that the crab was the worst item considering the name of their restaurant. I sure hope it was just a one off kind of thing.

Adding corn to your bag is quite a rip off since it's just half of the corn and they charge like $1.50 for it, but its REALLY good! Mainly because its drenched in all the sauce and the flavor really sinks into the corn. 
I didn't like how they didn't provide disposable gloves though.",26WgdHfEjWj4BrN-cUNhVw,1,1,4,PqnFXf6_2KqBgy3yZItycA

Service was spotty as well. I informed the waitress that this was our first visit to the boiling crab but was familiar with the concept from similar restaurants we visit.  Before even receiving our food the waitress had come by the table to see if we wanted to place an order for more food before the kitchen stops taking orders. Normally this wouldn't have bothered me, however there were still people being seated at new tables. We informed her that we would like to at least try the food first.

The bill was interesting -- because the total for BC was about the same as HnJ, BC was about $45-$50 with tip because my server was awesome and HnJ was about $40 with tip. For BC we had more food and that's including getting soda too. 

The cajun fries here at more of a spicy kick and HnJ are more cajun tasting. Lbs of shrimp between here and HnJ is about the same $11-$13 I believe

High quality seafood in a super lay back atmosphere... whats not to love!!!

I have been here many, many times and the service was always great (unlike hot n juicy), I tried everything on the menu and there is not a single item that I didnt like!

The shrimps,  clams and crawfish are bigger than hot n juicy, you get more snow crab legs in your order and I think the sauce is better, more flavorfull and complex.
Ask for extra juicy!

You get a free corn on cob with 2ibs of crawfish, I cant get enough of those sweet, spicy, chunky little creatures and their creamy delicious brains!!!

I can never decide which is my favorite between, dunjunness crab, snow or king crab. They are all awesome.

The lobster is the bomb too. So much to eat in one order, huge!!! Easily feed two persons.

I am also a big fan of their fried items: catfish, cajun fries, sweet potatoes fries even the chicken tender is a great item. I always ask for a side of sugar to put on my sweet potatoe fries... yum yum yum!!!

I came here last sunday (easter) and didnt had to wait to be seated.
My niece learned how to peal her first shrimps, awwww I am so proud, she loves crustaceans as much as her auntie!

The only negative thing I can say is when I ordered my lobster, it would have been nice to have the server actually share this information with me before hand, my lobster was a nearly 4 pound monster!!

The wait would we were told about 30 minutes, we decided to wait, but we got seated in only 20 minutes, so it was great.  We got service right away and placed our order.  I ordered clams and shrimp by the pound with mild spice, and the hub bub. 


The shrimp are huge, with head on, the sauce was just spicy enough to give my eyes a little water!  I also ordered a cup of the gumbo without rice, it has a very strong okra base, dark brown rue, very good flavors.

The rest of the table ordered fried baskets, I tried some of the big rings of calamari, it was tender, and the sweet potato fries were good.

Actually, it does. Their gumbos are excellent, and their oysters are savory.

I've been in a seafood funk since last Summer's visit to Florida, and while I've tried a few places around town, nothing has really gotten my seafood-based energy going. This place? This place is good times.

A lot of great food and seasonings, the service is very well done, funny, and helpful. From the moment they toss limes and little tubs of salt on the table, they know things are going to get messy, and line the tables with paper, and bibs for the customers. Food demolition is imminent, and I felt slovenly and decadent all at once.

Their gumbo is great, as is their other gumbo variant with the tomato bisque style sauce. Full of various seafoods and flavors. Everything was good, but I probably could ruin plates of oysters all day. Fortunately, everything was very fresh.

Busy times vary. The first time we walked in, it was simply just that: We walked in. We tried again a week later, only to find lines out the door.  We went back the next day only to find a smaller, more manageable line, and the restaurant filled up instantly within minutes of us sitting down.  Once you're in, you're golden. I'm still trying to figure out when ""busy"" time is for them.

The only thing they were missing was an ocean view, which I suppose I could forgive them, unless they want to hire people in dolphin costumes to frolic outside the windows, in which I will totally forgive them. The food's too good for the scenery outside.

Great food and service, crazy busy times, and needs and ocean view. I will visit here again, and keep doing so.",H3wPBzQCKCKiHcV7GZK4kg,7,4,5,1hnvfexqL-85Qz_3CvcrbQ

My family and I went and ordered 2 lbs. of fresh clams (amongst other things). IT WAS AMAZING. The clams were so fresh, juicy and PLUMP!!! and complemented by the sha-bang sauces, we definitely felt $10 a pound of these clams were a STEAL! 

I dont' recommend ordering the crab despite the fact that it's called Boiling Crab because often times, the crab smells and it's not because they're frozen, but because they die and the cooks don't even notice. 

Also, don't order the crawfish unless you've never had it before. As most people would say, crawfish meat is probably the size of your pinky and it's not worth the entire bang for your buck. 
Order a pound of clams instead. =) I'm still reminiscing how meaty they were!

A couple things about this particular location: It's a large open restaurant but they don't use their floor space very well. By the time it's 7pm, primetime for dinner, many people are standing in line and yet, the restaurant itself still has floor space to put more tables and chairs but the staff doesn't.
There's also a lot of bench-seats but they're uncomfortable =/ While these long benches deceivingly look like they could seat a lot of people, those could probably only seat 4 people max especially since you're going to be battling for elbow space as you chicken-pose to prevent the juices from splattering onto your sleeves/clothes!!",U0Be1j5f0On9DrV3TPmZZQ,0,0,5,bQtr67oPpoqRFBIRs211jQ

We asked one of the guys there and he said they don't have plates and they only have plastic forks and knives. I wanted the fork to eat my catfish. I'm not used to eating with my hands.  The catfish was good, perfectly prepared, and the fries were yummy.

The shrimps came unpeeled and I had a very hard time peeling them. My wonderful boyfriend ended up peeling them for me but between the both of us, we probably only ate half the shrimps. We ended up taking the rest home.

5568503,2015-09-20,2,zcScEL0WEdFkROcnz5379g,"4.5 Stars. This is the one place in Vegas that I'm willing to go off The Strip for. My buddy introduced me to Boiling Crab a couple of months ago and during my most recent trip, it was a no-brainer that I had to go again. If you've read any of the other reviews for this place, the seafood is obviously bonkers. Boiling Crab specializes in churning out boils not only for crab (duh), but a variety of our delicious crustacean and mollusk friends - shrimp, lobster, crawfish, clams, and oysters.

The interior combines the charm of a coastal seafood market (beach wood tables and benches, large chalkboard menu) with some unique original touches (graffiti clad walls, GIANT airplane propellers for ceiling fans). The space itself is HUGE. But even so, the waits can get lengthy during peak hours. To avoid the wait during my last visit, I came around 5:30pm on a weekday and was seated immediately.

The Sauce/Spiciness. Once you decide what seafood to order, you have to choose a sauce and heat level. For me, I have only tried the ""The Whole She-bang!"" which is a combination of all three sauces (Rajun Cajun, Lemon Pepper, and Garlic). You may be cynical, but TRUST me, this sauce is seafood ambrosia. The flavors go with everything on the menu. As for spiciness, I tend to prefer not to let too much spice overpower the flavor of the seafood, so I usually go mild (you'll still get a touch of heat).

During my latest visit, I had the clams ($10/lb), snow crabs ($18/lb), king crabs ($27/lb), and shrimp ($12/lb). The clams were great and just the right amount of tender. The ONLY slight slight slight criticism I had - which is why I'm not giving 5 stars - was the crab legs. Given the price I paid, I expected them to taste just a little bit fresher, and a couple legs were a tad overcooked. Don't get me wrong, they were still good, just not to my standards of what ""5 star"" crab legs should be. As for the shrimp (served shell on), they are my absolute favorite item on the menu. Not only were they the best bang for my buck at $12/lb while also having the best meat to shell ratio, the shrimp were cooked to perfection and pair perfectly with the Whole She-bang! sauce. So yes, you absolutely have to order the shrimp.

The first time I ate at BC was in LA with my little brother, where we got in line with about 20 other people half an hour before they opened on a Friday afternoon--popular!  That hasn't been the case so far at this Decatur location, but we usually arrive around 5:30 to beat the crowds who do show up by the time we're leaving.  

Eating here is fairly straightforward:
-pick your seafood and order by the pound:  shrimp, crawfish, oysters, clams, lobster, blue crab, king crab legs, snow crab legs, and Dungeness crab are your choices.  Your server will inform you up front if they are out of anything that day.
-pick your sauce:  Rajun Cajun, lemon pepper, garlic sauce, or the Whole Sha-Bang, which is a combo of all three sauces.
-pick your spice level:  non-spicy, mild, medium, and XXX.  
Fried options include catfish, shrimp, chicken tenders, calamari, oysters, and hot wings.
Sides are gumbo, Cajun chowder, corn on the cob, potatoes, sausages, Cajun fries, lemon pepper fries, sweet potato fries, steamed rice.
(Yes, I just summarized the menu.)

I usually get a pound of shrimp with mild Whole Sha-bang sauce, steamed rice, and a corn on the cob.  This past visit, we also had sweet potato fries first.  My method of eating shrimp is to peel a bunch first, then eat with rice, peel another bunch, eat, repeat, until all the shrimp is gone, my hands are red from the Sha-bang sauce, and the table is a disaster area.  What's so great about this place is that there are always so many other Asians there, mainly Filipinos from what I saw the last time; it feels like I'm at a family party.  Any opportunity that we get to eat rice and seafood with our hands is a good one, apparently.  There are TVs everywhere, so you can watch a good game or ESPN while you nosh.

We waited about 15-20 minutes to be seated. My party was called , and as we walked to our table, we ended up actually not having a table because it was all of a sudden taken by another party. So, we had to go back and sit down. 
Our server did his best to be nice. He was just forgetful when we would ask for things. 
The gumbo with rice is pretty good. So was the calamari and chicken tenders. On the other hand. the fried chicken and the French fries were super over seasoned and just awful.

I always get the mild whole shebang sauce for the shrimp, and there is not one time where I was disappointed. Flavor has always been consistent. Their service is not always consistent though.

I. Was. Wrong. Service was quick - employees were all young, energetic, and on point. Tables were lined with wax (?) paper to avoid any mess and allow for quick cleaning. Decor was unique and beachy with lots of wood features.

I got a pound of shrimp with potatoes in medium lemon garlic sauce. The sauce is so amazing...I just can't. Upon request, they give you salt, pepper, and lime, to make your seafood taste even better! I also tasted the whole shabang sauce and corn, which was just deliciously delicious deliciousness. The sweet potato fries were crispy and fresh as well.

When we got a hold of an employee, we told her that there was no corn and asked if that was a pound.  She held up the bag and asked if we ordered a full pound or a half.  We replied that we ordered a full pound.  She said that this couldn't be our order and took the bag away.  A couple minutes later, the chicken wings arrived.  They were excellent as always.  By the time we finished the wings, the shrimp still hadn't arrived.  Our original server dropped off a corn in a bag, but no shrimp.  The first girl came by a few minutes later and said that the first bag had to be our order because she has been watching it and nobody has taken it.  Then to my shock, she said that she would go get it.  I told her that I didn't want that bag because after 15 min of steaming in the bad, it would be way overcooked.  She looked a but stunned and paused.  I told her not to bring me that same bag.  At the same time, the original server was bringing it over.  She intercepted him and told him that I didn't want that bag.  They went over to the cashier area and discussed something with some others.  They came over and told me that the order was being remade.  To this point, I was fine with the proceedings.  I figured that ""shit happens"" and no big deal.  Then the shrimp arrived.  If someone tells me that wasn't the same shrimp, I'll tell them that they are a f'kn liar.  The shrimp was so overcooked that all of the heads had fallen off.

We ordered 1 lb of shrimp in non-spicy garlic spread, 2 lbs of shrimp in medium whole shabang sauce, 1 lb of clams in medium sha-bang sauce and 1 fried catfish dinner.

Well, we devoured the shrimps and clams - the sha-bang sauce was absolutely delicious especially the clams in that sauce.  For some reason, I found that the clams had more chopped up garlic.  I'm thinking it's because you can scoop up the wonderful garlic bits with your clam shell and then slurp it all up in one go!  I was impressed with the size of the shrimp and freshness of the shrimp.

The catfish dinner was really, really good. Not at all fishy.  Came with a full basket of fries - you can choose the spice level of your fries.

Why only 4 stars out of 5 stars - The Drinks - soda is $2 but believe it or not, they charge for H20!  25cents for Water - what a ripoff!  Not only that, they don't have hot water.  How hard is it to get a kettle for a restaurant?!?  But I must say, my waiter was really nice in that he offered to heat up the cold water in the microwave.  

Not too bad - will come back.  Hopefully, they will re-think charging for water.

They always give such little seasoning with a pound of shrimp, it's never enough. Seasoning never settles into the shrimp like it does in So Cal. I'm so use to getting so much flavor within the shrimp & lots of seasoning

Spice level is not always consistent. I'm a fan of spicy food so a few weeks ago when I ordered XXX my mouth was on fire, this week ordered XXX and felt like I was eating medium level.


Their seasoning is not always consistent either. Always get the whole shabang seasoning and it is normally bland or just right.

Cajun fries are to die for!

This place is huge, huge, huge!!  Extremely spacious and decorated like the others.  It kind of has a cafeteria feel to it with all the tables settled in the middle and the huge counter to the side.  This location also has its own door/area for to-go.  Nice touch!

I've already written a full review on my take of boiling crab.  Take a quick look at it if you'd like.  Everything's just as good as the Cali locations.

Reason why I'm not giving the place five stars is cause service is still sketch.  This place just opened up a couple weeks ago so I'd imagine it will improve over time but in the mean time they need to step it up.

Although really friendly and inviting, it seems like there are too many people in there just standing around.  The servers I've had were nice enough but I had to keep asking for shit that should be dropped even before my food comes.  ie. salt and pepper, limes, spoons for my rice, bib.  When in Cali, they take your order and come back right away dropping all the stuff needed for BC consumption... No questions asked.

.25 cents for filtered water (whatever), .50 cents for condiments (ranch, tarter sauce, etc.). No liquor license yet, but that's expected cause it takes a while to obtain.  Overall still a great place and I'm happy that they opened one up.  I get my cravings and it's nice that I can finally fulfill.  Cheeeeers!",ywI6YzxkoKyKC2JV4_19Sg,1,2,4,5aEiQ9vVAXGApyvO96GoKQ

Mr. W. was the one who had originally wanted to try out The Boiling Crab.  We've all heard how big they are in California and being that Arizona has HnJ and AC, BC was a temptress.  My friend had said it was oily like AC so I was really put off with that notion.  Ignoring her warning, we went to BC and it turned out to be my second favorite meal in Vegas for our trip!

Those crawfish were fresh!  The lungs were still white and not awkwardly grey or muddy; the head-fat wasn't bitter, black, or goopy but perfectly colored and sweet [head-fat that holds together in one sweet piece is an A+ in my book]; and the tail was so easy to break apart.  Chipping your nails trying to wrestle a tiny piece of tail-meat always leaves me salty so this makes me very happy.  The whole sha-bang sauce is pretty decent with chunks of garlic, not too spicy [this is where HnJ might have a *slight* advantage... their sauce is more broth-like] and not as oily as my friend made it out to be.  I enjoyed my every bit of my 2lbs. of crawfish and I will admit that I probably could have taken down another pound!  We also shared 1lb of lemon pepper shrimp, six raw oysters [plump, briny, and delicious] with lip-smacking spicy cocktail sauce [I liked to dip my crawfish meat in it every now and then], and a cup of gumbo [I recommend getting it with more sausage and shrimp].  Mr. W. had his heart set on the chowder but they sadly ran out.  Oh well.  Only means we have to stop by again!  I washed all this down with a sweet green tea and it was a great dinner in Sin City!

This restaurant is huge so a wait time was never an issue for us even at 6:00PM.  I love how sweet and attentive the wait staff is!  Pitchers of limes dumped onto the table?  Yes please!  I also like how they tie the bibs on you.  Ain't nobody got time for that in Arizona!  ;)  I'll be daydream of slurping the juice out of the head before ripping it apart for some head-fat!",zFYs8gSUYDvXkb6O7YkRkw,17,17,5,GuT8k3H0CRP-FAXpbj0zMQ

We had crab legs and peel and eat shrimp and not even a receptacle to put the waste. So in order to not to feel like total barbarians we combined our bags to have an empty one to put our waste in. 

The food was good. I do have to say that. The beer was a little chill but not cold.  I had the red potatoes which come whole so I had to use my hands and it was so messy because of the seasoning sauce that is in the bag. And the potatoes were undercooked.

Order with an open mind, an open wallet, and the expectation of getting very messy. With a short, but sweet menu of boiled seafood and fried goodness, there is nothing less pretentious than being served hot plastic bags of food brought to you in buckets, rice in to-go containers and plastic utensils if needed. Being of the indecisive, yet I want to try everything, mind set, the ""whole she-bang"" of flavor choices seemed perfect and worked out well as the sauce in which the food arrived in. Flavorful and a bit spicy, the flavor penetrated the shells of the shrimp perfectly and left the meat tender.
 
Use your hands to eat everything and satisfy your need to break the heads off helpless creatures, tear meat away from shell and bask in the juices spraying everywhere as you destroy your meal. Hulk hungry!! Then discard the useless parts on the table just like you used to do at mom's. It's finger, hand, wrist, forearm, elbow, chin, forehead-licking good.

I love love coming here whenever I'm super hungry or craving seafood. They have the best shrimp and cajun fries in town. I love the atmosphere and friendly workers. They all always look like they're having so much fun and most of the girls wear jean shorts and nike shoes. Just a little observation I took note of, lol. 

It can get pretty busy but definitely worth the wait! 
They have a lot of workers so expect to be helped fast and with a smile always!

I went with my boyfriend and his family and our server was Joey. He was super cool and really nice. He introduced himself to us right at the beginning and is very social and knows his menu for sure! Always checked up on us, made sure we were good, and got us taken care of quickly and efficiently. Our waters were constantly refilled and needs were fulfilled. I felt so needy but he never made us feel like it was too much to ask for. Excellent customer service! 

The whole shabang shrimp mild (half pound) with a side of rice and cajun fries is my usual. SUCH a delicious meal. I am craving it right now as we speak! Their prices are very reasonable for how good their food is. I love putting limes to season my shrimp. Their mild cajun fries are just the right amount of spicy! And the side of rice is a good portion. I share half and half with someone usually because it's too much for me!

If you're down to get dirty and have a good time, this is definitely the place.",wxQCLMnuVYbdtmQCc2ryZg,0,0,5,MDuAeSiOM5ghqGizrKiLmg

i visited this location last september with my husband, child and a couple of friends who at the time just moved here.  we had to wait, but not very long.. less than half hr.  

restaurant was pretty clean.  server was nice and friendly.  

i ordered myself what i now consider my usual, which is a pound of shrimp seasoned with the whole shabang. so fricken delicious!  i got chicken strips and fries for my little one. i forgot what my friends and hubby ordered.  everyone left happy. 

the only thing i hate about the whole idea is having to peel the shrimp and getting dirty.  i always think long about it before suggesting we go there 'cause it's pretty hard with a toddler who wants to run around while it's time to eat and chasing him with dirty hands.  i love the boiling crab. it's so worth it.

5937056,2012-03-17,0,zcScEL0WEdFkROcnz5379g,"So I heard this boiling crab place is really popular in California, so we definitely had to try this place out. My husband who is from there swears up & down that the food here is good even though he Is allergic to shrimp (but only when he wants to be). As newbies to this joint we definitely had to emblazon our names and words of wisdom on the lovely walls of this establishment (yes it is perfectly OK to vandalize the walls, they will even provide you with a sharpie). The menu is pretty simple (or so it seems) how many pounds of shrimp, lobster etc... You want and what kind of style sauce or how spicy you want it...problem is have you ever measured your food intake as to how many pounds? It was a good thing we had experts with us. For for people we had about 1 lb of shrimp & about 1/2 a lb of clams with sausage and a basket of fries, it didn't seem like much for people, but when we got our plastic bags (yes the main entrees are placed in plastic bags & nothing else just like how they do it when you go eat at the pier in redondo beach) it was a lot & was definitely enough for us. Keep in mind they have no plates nor any silverware and YOU MUST LEARN TO EAT WITH YOUR HANDS! so you can savor the goodness of their finger licking Cajun style spicy sauce that your seafood is drenched in. Word of advice though, as we all already know, seafood tends to get pretty pricey, so please do order in moderation, and try as much as you can to visualize how many pounds of food your party can consume so your bill can be somewhat reasonable. This was definitely worth the experience though, worth it enough even for my husband to give this place a ""shrimp""  exemption.",UAO-fiRQl0Why09SjUaMjw,0,1,4,GIt0z0opGMHNpbGQPHDzYA

Service was a bit overwhelmed, but there were alot of us, and I think that would've happened regardless of where we went. I tried the crawfish, but there really wasn't much to try on there.

The food tastes good (4 out of 5), but the prices are high (2/5) and nothing special about the seating arrangements (2/5).  The wait staff consists of typical young kids tatted and pierced (not my idea of clean wait staff) and with attitude.  The crawfish is usually small (1/5), but shrimp is good size so better to fill up on corn, sausage while 'tasting' crawfish.

1lb Shrimp - Mild whole sha-bang
1lb Clams - Mild whole sha-bang - I prefer this over the shrimp because its easier to eat and more flavorful. 
Corn- Lemon Pepper - Super buttery
Fried Catfish with french fries. - YUM and even if you don't order the fish you should order a side of fries.
Ive also had their gumbo which I wouldn't recommend. Has a kind of asian medicine taste to it.

So what was I doing at Boiling Crab in Las Vegas waiting over 30 minutes for a table?  Well, I have wanted to try the food at this chain restaurant for awhile now.  You know what.  I was pleased with our meal here.  

We shared King Crab legs, Shrimp, Corn, and Potatoes.   We had it flavored with the whole Sha-Bang!!  It is a mixture of Rajun Cajun, Lemon Pepper, and Garlic sauce.  Super flavorful!!  Went with medium spicy for just a kick.

Did I have to work to get the crab meat?  Yeah, but it was well worth it.  It truly is messy to eat all that yummy food that we dig out of those plastic bags.  No wonder they give us bibs!

Overall, we had a very nice time at Boiling Crab.  Terrific atmosphere with all the tvs.  Delicious food and good service too.  Now I know that I am a fan of Boiling Crab.  Are you?",whINg-cC-FiAv_ATDGMDTg,9,8,4,3qaQkn9Lh3Fmh3aWfgzcEw

The seasonsing for the food is on point and the atmosphere is pretty cool.  It's a lot more fun to eat here with a big group of people, but I guess it's pretty cool for date night too.  

The only downfall about this place is there is NO DESSERT!  Gotta have dessert in a place like this IMO.  But overall, the best place for cajun seafood in Vegas that's off the Strip.",PIqY8tBBbRIWmdpW7EFEUw,1,1,4,rLWxieRaFQ8JicBvmhuayw

I'm generally not a fan of seafood, but I definitely can put down a pound of shrimp. ESPECIALLY when its drenched with The Boiling Crab sauce! I came here on a Monday night while visiting Vegas and got there at about 6:55-7PM. (NOTE: If you arrive AFTER 7PM be prepared to wait)
We waited 10 minutes for our table of 3 but it went by pretty quickly. I already knew what I wanted. Our waitress Nadia was super friendly and helpful. She came by and welcomed us and brought us some waters to start.
We ordered a round of beers and she put our bib on.
I ordered 2 lbs of shrimp to share in the Whole Sha bang sauce in medium spicy. I'm pretty good at handling the heat but, wow, I under estimated ""medium,"" its actually pretty up there on the spicy scale. 
 I ordered my corn and potatoes in the Hot flavor and that thing was SPICY. I think I cried a bit...
I would just stick to medium. lol I love that they have rice! I eat my rice with the sauce and my shrimp. :p
Nadia was really attentive and refilled the much needed water often. I really enjoyed eating at this place, I would def recommend it and would go back next time I'm in town.",C0HldVZbJfQDjL4FkeJslQ,0,0,4,pq0z_Jm5HVfB9rOF7Jbf3A

5986586,2012-01-14,0,zcScEL0WEdFkROcnz5379g,"We had heard that H n J and Boiling Crab's owners or businesses were related, and had always wanted to try what our Cali friends were raving about.  We were stoked to see that it had come to town, and with such great reviews in such a short period of time, so we had to give it a try.

First, our seafood resume:
Semi-regulars at Hot n' Juicy, which is great but crowded and long waits, and terrible parking. Crawfish, of course, is their mainstay.
Then Cajun Crawfish (now defunct), which we also liked a lot; at least the takeover addressed the accessibility issues.
Crab Corner near St. Viator's, which was also very good, but not the same style as the above-mentioned.
Shucks, Joe's, not bad not great.

When you're eating seafood, you're getting dirty, and the tables were plain and adequately spaced apart for that purpose.  There are TVs everywhere, and we the Saints game on.  Kids (and adults) can scribble on the walls, and mark their territories.  

We ordered dungeness crab, shrimp, and crawfish, so we could give a more well rounded analysis.  We had a single ordered delayed for some reason, but otherwise the food came out in a timely fashion.  Water for $.25 was kinda lame. (I wonder if you brought your own cup if they'd charge you? ;)  )  The crab was very good, fresh, and flavorful.  The appropriate tools were provided  (crackers, picks) for crabbing. The shrimp was of a good size, tasty, and lended itself well to the She Bang sauce.  Your fingers and hands are going to smell for hours, just embrace it and dig in.  The crawfish were a little disappointing, and didn't taste as fresh as H n J. 

Kids ate chicken and fries. Fries are essential for sauce dipping.  We also ordered gumbo, without rice. Definitely get it with rice, and there wasn't much to it alone.

The oysters seem on the large side compared to what other places serve. What ever the spicy sauce is that that serve with the oysters the one in the plastic container with a lid that stuff is really good. I have also had the shrimp and craw fish, and tried the diff seafood with Mild whole she-bang sauce and no spicy, just with the sauce. I prefer the no spicy cause the sauce they serve with it is all ready slightly spicy and I think adding more spiciness to the seafood takes away from the flavor of the seafood. Kinda like when you eat a raw jalapeno you can only taste the hotness you couldn't taste the flavor of the other food. The meat in the bags go really well with rice cause you have all the extra sauce.",N26-dXhOoB3gHhX6meMMNw,4,3,4,sfix0mXef7q_eK98bAdXdw
