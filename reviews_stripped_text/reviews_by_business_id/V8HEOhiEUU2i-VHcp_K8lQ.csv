This is the third mistake I've experienced at this Starbucks in 4 weeks. I was given the wrong size drink a few weeks ago and the barista realized she made a mistake and it was no problem.

Especially here in Vegas it has been so hot and the humidity was just insane. In order to get that extra boost while moving Timmy we had stopped by this Starbucks. For me I love the Mocha Frap's and I love to have them drizzle that chocolate on the inside of the cup and mix it really well.
This Starbucks was very clean and the bathroom was very clean which I was so happy about because we still didn't buy toilet paper yet for Timmy's dorm LOL. The service was very quick and the order was on point. I loved the service that was provided to us and I wish I could have remembered her name for she was just smiling and happy and gave the best customer service. 
This is place was up the block from Storage West in Vegas and I know that the next time we are  in Vegas and we move Timmy's stuff to storage we will be coming back here forsure. You can always count on Starbucks for quality drinks, good food and great dessert items. They also have A/C here and in Vegas that is a HUGE PLUS. 
Also, if you add their app you will receive free drinks and earn points for discounts. Also if you belong to Groupon, then they have deals of buy 5.00 and get 10.00 dollars worth of Starbucks. :}",6LvSDK7CKaSQqoltfPgRVA,14,13,5,V1steHmjLdJa_r9h36DvHg

I've been through the drive through a few times but usually come in and sit down with my friend. I like this location because it's a convenient for my friend and I to meet up and we love the speedy service.

The only downside of this location is that it closes at 7pm most days, which is a little too early for my taste. This usually causes me to have to drive all the way to the sandhill location because they are open till 9pm. In a nutshell this location gets the job done and I dig it!

When there are 8 or so employees, you'd think that the place would run like an efficient, well-oiled machine. Nope. Everybody is cackling, acting foolish, trying to be funny and generally just running around and not getting anything done. There shouldn't be a line backed up with that many employees. 

I had an unsweetened green tea and my dad ordered a Java Chip Frappuccino. He complained to me that they didn't sweeten it, outside of the chocolate chips. He had a jar of stevia in the car to fix it, but still, the drink wasn't properly made and looked like it was topped with whipped topping rather than whipped cream. It just tasted funky.
