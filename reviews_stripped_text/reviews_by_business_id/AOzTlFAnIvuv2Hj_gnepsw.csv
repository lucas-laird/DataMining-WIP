224690,2016-08-19,3,AOzTlFAnIvuv2Hj_gnepsw,"Yikes! This new Popeyes is off to a rocky start. I had the misfortune of encountering (Shaniece...girl with purple hair strand) at the drive thru today. She was too dang RUDE to be interacting with customers! She needs to be far, far, away from customers, with her crappy people skills. Also, prices are way too high here. Either that, or they made a mistake on ringing up my order. The 2 piece combo for $7 plus tax is basically a one piece combo because the wing piece is so tiny. 

Check your receipt and contents of your order before you drive away. She also forgot napkins, fork, and straw with the order. 

I'll never come back to this location. :(",n_dSB1XI5xniKHIpfbnX5w,6,4,1,04Pic3cMfhWCwHK9_67J_g
263251,2016-09-08,1,AOzTlFAnIvuv2Hj_gnepsw,No Tuesday special.  No need to go back.  Didn't even order when I found out.  I can go to Sahara/Jones or Rainbow/215 and get a POPEYES Tuesday special.  This place sucks!  NEVER BE BACK!!!!  And I'll bet corporate or any manager doesn't even read these.  If you do I challenge you to respond,FD9gb2_NGnDXd2GBMHoJjg,1,1,1,etv6FIiBE2D25zmlF7cQTw

1498918,2016-12-03,0,AOzTlFAnIvuv2Hj_gnepsw,I love Popeyes so when I heard a Popeyes was being built near my area i was excited. Then a few months passed Popeyes open and I came here a few times and while the food here is good and the chicken can be hit or miss they don't have any ongoing deals that's advertised on TV like the Tuesday special or any other deals or new menu items that other Popeyes locations have while I still see this Popeyes stay in don't see it lasting or getting alot of business for much longer will still come by every now and then just disappointed that they don't have any deals.,Unhr6Ut9xQowzzohevNdxg,1,0,3,N3Vk54GnC070xPo10bSo1g
1748501,2017-01-19,0,AOzTlFAnIvuv2Hj_gnepsw,"Goddamn, i knew i made a mistake when i walked through the doors

I'd never been to a popeyes before and I was starving and needed something quick on the way. 

I ordered the chicken po-boy with red rice and beans and the cashier tried to explain something to me but I couldnt understand a word she was saying and she was also taking orders from the drive thru over her headset so I just walked away after i got my receipt.

14 minutes later i finally got my food in a to-go bag even tho i said i was eating in. 

The chicken strips on the po-boy were 90% deep-fried breading and 10% the fake ass chicken i was expecting. There was also two pickles and about 7 strands of diced lettuce and a slathering of mayo. 

I.Still.Ate.It.All. Did i mention that i was starving? Still.. I'll never return.",UXd56jH3f76kppekXqui9g,0,0,1,ca4QwQFyP9H_JP-2DB1mBQ
2326391,2017-03-20,0,AOzTlFAnIvuv2Hj_gnepsw,What a joke. First time visit.  No one working there had a clue. Tried to order 3 piece strip but they were out etc etc etc. guess that is what I get trying to order dinner from kids,gw6FV2Z07axlDjWhIrczyA,0,0,1,orE1nj1J1WKeSYOBg6D35A
3378937,2016-09-07,0,AOzTlFAnIvuv2Hj_gnepsw,This place is awful awful. They don't have the Tuesday special. I've seen customers who waited for there order for over 30mins. I sat there eatting my meal wondering what the heck did these customers order that's taking so long while I'm done eatting my meal. I been here once and that will be my last time because there's no Tuesday special.,a4pXeujst8qSsQ0Bg-EZsA,2,1,1,ZwI557EUhbZnXlXLku0j6g
3731560,2016-09-07,2,AOzTlFAnIvuv2Hj_gnepsw,"I went to this location 12229 after work to pick up food for my pregnant wife and my self. Not only did it take me over 8 minutes to get my food as I sat at the window my order was completely incorrect. Normaly I don't do these surveys but it caused a major issue and we could not eat the food.
 From what I orders for my wife mild 2pc big box upgraded to breast with mash potatoes and coleslaw ( this is what she's craving).
For my self I ordered the 3 pc spicy tenders with Cajun fries for both sides and a extra side of red beans and rice.

From looking at the boxes I received all chicken no tenders. 
No red beabs and rice instead they give mash potatoes.
The fries where cold and old.
My wife couldn't eat her chicken cuz they gave spicy not mild for both.
Lucky she was Abel to eat both sides of mash potatoes and the Cole slaw while the rest of the food went into the garbage. I called the store before and told them the situation and the lady who answered the phone "" Popeyes can i help you"" I explained the situation and she stated ""well if you want you can bring it back"" I live in vegas and at this time it's rush hour me going to that store would take about 40 minutes there and back. No other solution was given i felt as if i was rushed off the phone as just another piece of trash thrown away as if it is not her problem. I would like this fixed  $14.58 was spent I don't want my money back i just want it made right!",gd4tLkpAd5VkeL_MeRJQVg,3,3,1,7dh9NMh3VADYv9HB2s6sCw
4117948,2016-10-22,0,AOzTlFAnIvuv2Hj_gnepsw,First time at the Flamingo/Decatur Popeyes. I went into the store to order. Ordered Mac n Cheese as a side. They don't have any. The cashier tells me nobody in Vegas has it. Well it's on their website! The mashed are too spicy and the biscuits taste salty. Not planning on going back ever again.,i5MlesN2FAeZjR9ECjISPA,0,0,1,SmXveUTPnvth2t8BE3iPlw
4699544,2016-11-02,0,AOzTlFAnIvuv2Hj_gnepsw,I love Popeyes chicken. But what I don't understand is how this new Popeyes is going to stay in business. They don't have the Tuesday special. I've only been there twice. Both times I have seen people walk in and leave immediately empty-handed. This place is not off to a very good start. I'm just saying....,eqF6SEpEnSRR43yPLbJc1A,0,0,1,xA1krvKWbqAvH3HKX2gJ4Q
4759444,2017-01-30,1,AOzTlFAnIvuv2Hj_gnepsw,"Ugh. Love Popeyes but this location needs a huge upgrade in their customer service. Employee who took my order was extremely rude when I had questions about the menu and I had to stand at the counter for at least five minutes for a take home box when one person was on break and sitting at a booth playing with his phone with another sweeping the floor, mind you, we were the only people in the store along with another couple eating.",UQfbOU0G7zTi6Qz6TCoaeQ,1,1,3,ewnTEYvpzr7PW0oxGScd7A

5646440,2016-09-05,0,AOzTlFAnIvuv2Hj_gnepsw,"I love their  fried chicken.  When it's right it's juicy, crispy and full of flavor.  Everything was great.  My Cajun mashed potatoes were hot and the biscuit was still warm.  My only complaint was it did take a while to get the food through the drive thru, but she apologized for the wait and I was satisfied with that.  Other than that this location was great.",XFhyeDMz4MSYuub2hRVOpQ,0,0,4,TmSC4-iPelcWHOOupTh9Hg
5738633,2016-09-05,1,AOzTlFAnIvuv2Hj_gnepsw,We got our food and it was cold so we asked them to remake it. The manager Christian never even looked to see what was in our box just said okay and turned around while turned away he said four minute. We waited about ten minutes and went to the front to see if it was done. When they handed us the food the meal we paid for wasn't complete it was missing all the side. Spoke to the manager again and he said we didn't ask for the sides to made over (All of the meal was cold so why would we only ask for the chicken) then he just turned around and continue to do whatever he was doing before hand. The manager was rude and didn't seem willing to help or serve quality food. I get its just a fast food place but that doesn't mean you can serve people cold food then get an attitude with a paying customer because you served them cold food,uiDMzDqsw_2tRi-55DPvSw,2,2,1,BL-oqMwziXfvUeJ3dhDmfw
5849091,2017-02-23,4,AOzTlFAnIvuv2Hj_gnepsw,"The WORST experience ever! This Popeyes is near my home however I will never return ever!  I decided to check it out and it was one big regretful mistake. 

I visited at 7:30 at night and it seemed that there was an issue with everything I ordered.

First, they had no wings so I was told it would be a 10 minute wait sitting in the drive thru Seriously? I was then informed they had no mashed potatoes so I had to pick a different side.

I then get to the window and the employee says they are out of sweet tea. So she gives me unsweetened and hands me sugar packets
 Um ok?

They also had no honey for my biscuit that I had requested, she replied, we never have honey but is on order and they should have in a couple of days.

It just got worse by the second, honestly I should have just said forget it and drove off.

I inquired as to why they had so little chicken prepared and why no sweet tea.

She replied ""is late and we don't make much chicken"" Hmmm 7:30 pm is late???? Wow. She also informed that the sweet tea is popular so it goes fast.
I replied well wouldn't it be a good idea to check it more often and make sure is being made rather than waiting until it is empty and not available for customers.

She just kept saying is late, so I said so basically I should not visit around 7:30 as it is too late to get what I want?

She then asked her team lead with a major attitude to explain to me why they were out of everything I wanted. She just said ""she ain't know why they out but I can call the next day and talk to somebody if I want?""

I did call the next day just to issue my complaint and explain what happened. I was met with more attitude and rushed off the phone.

I can't believe this crew that they have serving the customers.

This Popeye's location is pathetic and a big disappointment. They just don't care.",deL6e_z9xqZTIODKqnvRXQ,7,3,1,nCEJDX7ejHuaTrRx1Dc2cQ
5911999,2016-08-14,3,AOzTlFAnIvuv2Hj_gnepsw,"Just saw that they've finally opened! The place actually came up pretty fast. It's located on Decatur and Flamingo. We went through the drive thru this morning and the service was excellent. The lady on the other side of the speaker was super nice and friendly. When we approached the window, her smile was very contagious! Super sweet! On to our food...

The three piece chicken combo-
It came with a biscuit and a side (which we chose coleslaw). Pretty good sized meal with a good price. The chicken was crispy and tasty.

Mashed potatoes-
Soooooooo delicious. I don't know what's in the gravy, but it's bomb.

Biscuits-
Buttery goodness!!!!!!

Definitely a great place for some soul food!",wxQCLMnuVYbdtmQCc2ryZg,2,2,4,xPmbnFQq6ZyuD6A8xZmxxw
