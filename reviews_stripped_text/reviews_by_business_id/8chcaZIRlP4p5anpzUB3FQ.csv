600437,2017-03-04,2,8chcaZIRlP4p5anpzUB3FQ,"Came to this place based on ratings..won't do that again.  The place was nice, but the service was very slow and the food overpriced and nothing to rave about.  It took like 20 min or so to get regular coffee  and the owner comes over to us apologizing and says that the coffee will be free and that he just opened the place 2 or 3 weeks ago and doesn't have enough servers.  When I ordered the crepes with nutella, one with banana and one without, I was told by the waitress that she wasn't going to tell the cooks that because they were so busy and it was going to make them mad, that she could tell them to put the banana on the side.  The place was not even at full capacity, and there certainly wasn't a crowd waiting for a table.   And they still didn't get the order right anyway!  My instinct was to get up and go but I decided to let it slide.  I ordered the Vegas Style Toast and it simply was not good.  The poached eggs were still kind of raw and were totally bland.  It grossed me out so I had the waitress take it.  I decided to only order a bagel instead of a new full dish because of how long it took to get our food in the first place.  Even that took like 10 minutes!  My son's hash browns with onions were burned and  he said that the crepes we make at home were better.  I tried the omelette my husband ordered and we agreed that wasn't good either.  When it came time to pay the bill the Vegas Toast had not been removed.  I asked the waitress about it and she said that her boss said we still had to pay for it.  I was obviously not happy with having to pay for a dish that was so disgusting to me.  I took my kids and went to wait for my husband in the car I was so pist.  When my husband comes out he says he told the owner that I didn't like what I got and the owner responded by saying that I didn't like a lot of things, that I wasn't in the mood.   What a professional!  Don't try to pin on me the fact that the food and service was so damn shitty!  This guy clearly has no experience in the food business and much less in customer service!  I doubt this place will be open for long.  Even the waitress told my husband that it wasn't right that we had to pay for the dish.

711125,2017-08-19,0,8chcaZIRlP4p5anpzUB3FQ,"Ok. Where to start... been bookmarked for quite some time. Love all the #dirtyfork pics on instagram. Finally got here with my daughter. She knows her food. 
We got:
dirty fork lunch special: too much going on. Like wayyyy too much. Texture was strange. It was beautifully plated. It truly gave me the same feeling as the restaurant itself- confused. Too many ""good"" ideas. Mis mashed. How do I explain this... from the decor to the food. It just felt... confused is the only word that comes to mind. 
turkey sammy: good... I think. I dunno, again- too much. Hard to get a complete bite. I like my sandwiches stable. I like them balanced.
short stack of island pancakes: GREAT. all the syrups were yummy. They were fluffy, light, absolutely delicious. 
Here's the bottom line- go. Try it. Make up your own mind. Support small businesses. My take is just that- mine. 
(ATTN OWNER!!!)Last BUT NOT LEAST- get rid of the elevator music please. I think that was the worst. Waited quite a while for our food and the music in the background just made it feel like I was in a doctors office. Play some chill good vibe island sounds. Isn't that your ""thing""??

We were seated,never asked what we wanted to drink ,waited for 10 minutes without a return by the sole server in the restaurant yet two tables were seated after us were served drinks. Pitiful.

My mom even went up to the counter to try and get someone one to wait on us and that did nothing. We ended up leaving and going to Norm's diner just down the street where we were seated promptly,drink orders taken immediately and a server over a few minutes to take our order. Much better experience there than the dirty fork.

If I didn't want to lose my money on a Groupon I wouldn't go back. The management needs to get a much better system in place and more staff on hand. If not it's going to be the same thing over and over again.",V_cd8pu8dOYhml8PO7-TpQ,1,1,1,UMbCtzTocgxT0BkqA1EnBA

This new (opened early this year) breakfast and lunch spot is a little out of the way but worth the trip. The staff and owner are extremely friendly and the food they prepare is top notch at a reasonable price. My wife's egg white omelette and my bacon & scrambled eggs were both top notch. The service was quick and attentive. The owner pointed out that the hardest part of launching a new dining spot is making people aware you're there.

1049953,2017-02-06,5,8chcaZIRlP4p5anpzUB3FQ,"I am always for a new brunch experience!

FOOD: The presentation of their dishes are pretty. The Happy Hippie Kale Salad was a refreshing salad served with an avocado dressing. I was not a fan of the dressing, but the salad itself was refreshing made with quality ingredients. I was really excited to try the Ms. Lorraine Quiche. The bacon, cheese, and egg was cooked perfectly and literally melted in my mouth. My only thing was it was cold when it was served to me and I did not like the crust at all. I prefer my quiche to be more flaky in texture. The Tomato Soup and Grilled Cheese is always a must order everywhere I go. But unfortunately, it was also cold by the time it was served to me. The soup was decent, but I was not too crazy about the grilled cheese, I think it was the type of bread used. The food is good, but I think they should work on their recipes a bit more.

BAKERY: The owners seem to focus on recommending customers their bakery items more than their menu items. The macaroons were delicious and I highly recommend trying them. Their croissants and almond croissants were okay, but I wasn't too crazy about it. They were a bit hard for croissants.

DRINK: They serve the basic coffee, latte, and tea items you would want for brunch. Nothing too special. Water is served in a glass bottle.

ATMOSPHERE: This restaurant is a cross between a casual and fancy coffee shop. I have to say the service was great. Our waiter was really friend and attentive. I love the look of the place with the bright blue walls and shiny floors.",LTCxnnAQGaGZPHZx4KbvGA,10,9,4,K0oOrvXP3o8P_6ooeFn_Ow

Basically the server equivalent of ""not my fault and not my problem"". Would have been manageable if the omelet? had been good but it clearly wasn't mixed well since some parts had too much flavor and other parts were extremely bland. No in between. Tried to enjoy the toast since my omelet wasn't good but my first bite, I cut my gum on the rock-hard? crust. Fabulous. I'll deal with sub par food or bad service but both?

1662779,2017-03-18,0,8chcaZIRlP4p5anpzUB3FQ,"Ah I seriously don't like to leave bad reviews, and have only ever left one. This one just needs to be said.
Came here after reading a great review and was really excited. Looks mostly cute and modern minus the very tacky ornaments and black curled ribbon hanging everywhere. Those IKEA lights would look a million times better if they didn't have all those extra frills suffocating them. I wanted to cut them down so bad! Please adjust this and let your restaurant be a restaurant and not a quinceanera who's favorite color is teal.
Okay no that's not most important, the food clearly is. 
We glanced over the menu and saw some awesome looking things. Lady at the table next to me had this great looking frittata style dish and I had to get that. But first I saw ""Scone with clotted cream and jam."" I bounced at the idea of that, since I love European baked goods and the fact it came with clotted cream was epic! Well my waitress suggests to NOT heat the scone because the cream get gross on top. On top? Cream is not on the side as traditionally served I asked? No she said. Okay so I took her suggestion. Scone comes, with no clotted cream and jam, it's triangular and flat, and has a hard glaze over it. Ummmm wtf? This is zero like any scones with clotted cream and jam. So I try it and my fork almost broke off. Hard as a rock. Literally. I could throw this against the wall. I tell the waitress how this has no cream or jam and is hard as a rock and I want to trade out. She's confused. Says she can bring me cream cheese and jam. What?! That's NOT clotted cream. So now my dreams of a warm scone and clotted cream, which if you're wondering at this point what that is, we'll it's divine. Like a smooth, spreadable slightly sweetened marriage of whipped cream and butter. Usually served cold next to a warm scone. So now you can see why I'm so bummed. I ask for a chocolate croissant because now I'm really wanting to feed my pastry hankering and if a restaurant is going to have a display case of great pastries, well I'm trying. She brings out and then, only then, offers to warm it. Uhh ya, who doesn't want a warm pastry? It returns warm and I try to stick my fork in and yet again, stale, hard, gross. WHYYYYYY?????? You are offering such great pastries on your menu but they've been refrigerated and hard as rocks?! Then they are served nothing as described on the menu? Come on. Okay that was just the appetizer which at this point I've eaten neither. My dish comes out and is served with a small side salad which I like and can identify the yummy raspberry dressing from a local grocery store. Definitely not homemade. So that's three things I've eaten now that are clearly not freshly made at this restaurant. So what is made there? I go to eat my quiche/ frittata dish and hmmm, damn....no luck here. The egg is just straight up mush. Like full of liquid and I'm worried it's not even edible. I'm so hungry though and the favors are good, but the texture is just soooooo gross. Like not fully cooked. I completely struck out and will never return. Such a bummer because it seemed so cute and had a chic menu. They really gotta hit the drawing boards again before serving another dish.",B9fl7l18ZvjiGffVfuhjkQ,9,1,1,hHNCoz2UqNKydnQQkuQx4Q

Came in for lunch and being the only table in there raised some concerns. We got French toast and the madam sandwich. The sandwich tasted like cheap biscuits and gravy but maybe I'm just spoiled from Paris? But the bechamel had a really grainy texture and it was just basic ham. The French toast was good but nothing to brag about it, not to mention that there wasn't any guava cream cheese on it like the menu advertises.

The Breakfast Special (riffing on chicken and waffles) and their Lunch Special (with salmon!) are unique options that have several flavors and textures to prevent food FOMO. If you're into sweets, get a side of their guava cream cheese, which was the tastiest version I've come across! Prices are a couple bucks higher than warranted but the food itself is solid. Avoid the acai and yogurt bowls. 

Bring a friend to catch up with because, as other reviews mention, this place runs on island time and lengthy wait times are typical.

No wait. It was actually really empty on a Saturday morning at 11:00am.  It doesn't matter but we got here and I wanted to try the dishes they are known for so I ordered their Dirty Fork Breakfast.  The kids had the blueberry pancake and my husband ordered their turkey sandwich. 

Blueberry pancake: My kids didn't like the blueberries.  That was my fault in ordering it.  They said that the blueberry in the pancake tasted funny.  So, I tried it.  It was fine. I guess the kids don't like Blueberry?

My Dirty Fork Breakfast was AWESOME!   My son took the french toast bread and my daughters took the strawberry and eggs. I was left with some fried chicken.  

My husbands turkey sandwich:  The sandwich was suppose to have sprouts but it didn't come with any. He also said that the turkey was too thin compared to what you'd get at other diners. So he didn't like his sandwich but he was so hungry he ate the whole thing. 

Service: AMAZING.  But then again, we were the only ones in the restaurant. The lady was super nice and came back many times to help us out. I wished there were more people in there.

My mom and I came in for breakfast around 9am and the place had about 2 tables that were filled(expected because it is still quite new). The waiter brought us our menus and I realized there weren't any vegetarian or vegan options (I'm a vegetarian) so I opted to ask the waiter what my choices were and he told me ""a salad"" and that tone in his voice was so rude and insincere. In the end (without his help) I opted for a fruit bowl and hash browns. Now, when my hash browns came out they came out black (literally, both sides were black and burnt) and when I brought this to the waiters attention he played off the burnt hash brown saying ""hash browns are like this"" (????? At this point it's clear he obviously eats from the dumpster) so I asked if I could have it browned instead & the second time they came perfect. NOW, this waiter at this point knows I'm a vegetarian but he didn't think to tell me that the hash browns were cooked with butter... I took a bite of the hash browns and ~butter explosion~.

The pastries didn't look too appetizing so I passed on that, but I did order their brunch special of salmon wrapped lettuce with mushrooms and other crap that didn't seem to go together. I must say, the best part of my meal was  the poached egg that was done perfectly and the whiff of air when we left.

I saw a picture of the pancakes and read a review about how great the food was. I was so excited. As I walked into the restaurant at 3:08pm, I was barely greeted with one of the servers kinda of under her breath saying they were closed. The restaurant advertised online and on the front door to close at 3:30pm with 2 tables still dining but the CLOSED sign flipped on the door. The server asked the cook if he wanted to turn on the grill (which means they must have shut down early and cleaned it to not want to turn it back on; someone was ready to get out of work early today) 

Fortunately, with all that is available in the area, I will never return to this place just on the laissez-fair attitude they have. How over-the-top could this place be if the ethic of the place is to shut down whenever they feel like it. 

Good luck.

I ordered the omelet with hash browns and rye toast. I could not believe the amount of salt they used.  I could not eat the hash browns and only tasted the omelet.  I gave some to my husband who isn't as particular as I am to over salting foods. So my breakfast consisted of one slice of rye bread.  The waitress asked when she brought the check if everything was okay. I told her about the salt problem and she said she would let the cooks know. So not a good experience . I purchased a groupon we will return on a weekday only and be careful on what we order.  The bill with tip and no drinks was 35.00.",JHJ3r1-q0ORQIQey_E_BWA,0,0,3,0ueRoprvdJUsG7oajrSqQg
2303965,2017-03-09,2,8chcaZIRlP4p5anpzUB3FQ,"Talk about nice little breakfast/brunch spot off the strip. I always wanted to check out Dirty Fork because honest the name does peak one interest. More so close to the house for me and always looking for new spots nearby. My first impression was talk about REALLY really nice interior decor. I know the place before was also breakfast/lunch spot but am sure not as nice. The display case with the fresh pastries is on point! The different pastries all looked hell of tasty just had no room for any once realize the size of the 9th island french toast. Three different areas in the restaurant. The bar area once walk in that had all these different cool light fixtures hanging down, the main dining area, and in the back little booth area that has really cool framed artwork hanging on the wall. The whole Dirty Fork name and big Fork on another wall. I like the personality in it. They do have some outdoor patio available. 

9th island French Toast was screaming at me for first visit. I know just cause from 808. Really when reading the description the key was ""Hawaiian Sweet Bread"". It something that not see often on menus in general. Who would have thought basic French Toast concept but use Hawaiian Sweet Bread. Brilliant! Not only the Toast but add the guava cream cheese and coconut syrup went tropical island style. I added fresh fruit (Strawberries and Blueberries) not only more filling but balances out all the flavors. Talk about nice portion size if carbs is the game you get your money worth on this one. lol. It was winnah!

I also ordered fresh orange juice. The only reason mention it is that they squeeze juice everyday. You can tell the difference. Super refreshing and perfect drink with my breakfast. 

The service was five stars. The waiter told him first time explaining everything checking up  making sure everything was great. The owner is awesome. I love seeing small business owners out in the dining room asking for feedback on the food. Honest. Friendly. Grateful. Genuine. Someone that not only has passion for the food but cares about customers. 

The prices are very reasonable. If looking for great spot start the day Dirty Fork is great spot! Or if any your plans involves Desert Breeze Park head across the street for food later.",iSC96O2NjQc3JExGUHQG0Q,4,5,4,cMOmS49IMl0zHrj3nqMJkQ
2306261,2017-02-03,7,8chcaZIRlP4p5anpzUB3FQ,"Was looking for a place I could grab lunch with my puppy today.  Saw the tables outside and thought I'd give it a try! So happy I did!

The servers were nice enough to bring me a menu as I sat outside with my pup.  Honestly all the options sounded so good, it was difficult to choose.      The server KJ brought out a carafe of water, which tasted great! Not that vegas water flavor that I usually decline to drink.  I also started with a glass of orange juice, only because it is fresh! I usually dislike OJ, the one they've got here is delicious and frothy.  

Burger with avocado and fries- Really exceeded my expectations. The bread reminds me of something from shake shack. So good! It's probably the first time I did not need to add any ranch.  The avocado was saucy enough on its own that the burger needed nothing extra.  The fries!! Such a nice crunch on the outside, super good all by itself. I can't think of where I've had this texture of fries before. Definitely stands out from other places.  

Lunch special- took a bite from my girlfriend's plate. If you are looking for something light it's a great option!   It has salmon, arugula, mushrooms, pico de gallo, with a poached egg the yolk just oozing.  You can tell the thought they put into this menu.  Everything is so yummy!

I thought I'd have a super quick and casual lunch. I surprising enjoyed my afternoon here and decided to stay a little longer. 

KJ told me about their afternoon tea offering.  Which I can't wait to try next time!  I didn't have much space so I opted for a cup of tea and macaroons. They were just the right amount of sweet to finish off my meal. 

I'm looking forward to making this my social spot.  Afternoon tea is already on my schedule!",jUZW1alRK8QvdZ-pH1OquQ,10,12,5,P94uI8WhHDUNml9MW3Rc9g

Dirty Fork doesn't sound like a french name but the vibes are definitely french, not to mention the menu has items that have clearly french names. It's just that the name ""Dirty Fork"" didn't make me think ""french bistro."" Which also means that I was not prepared for the higher than average pricing. I ordered a Paris Panini and it was good but nothing special. I replaced the salad with hashbrowns and those were bomb! They cook them with onion and I didn't even need ketchup to enjoy them. My boyfriend got the Dirty Fork Breakfast Special. He liked it but I didn't even try it because I really was not in the mood for chicken.

I think the shock of thinking it would be something it wasn't turned off my boyfriend from it, but I will certainly come back. I enjoyed my time and learning about what this place offers. The portions are  smaller than other comparable restaurants but I thought it was perfect sizing. It was enough to eat everything and feel full but not so much that I felt sick or had to take some home. I was particularly impressed by their coffee! I am by no means a coffee snob, I can be equally satisfied by 7/11 brew as LavAzza but this was smooth and perfect even without creamer.

It is also out of necessity cause my lovely wife do not like the sight of a cook top, I was told it causes a rash of some sort and I believe it as it puts her in a odd mood all day when she does enter the room called kitchen! She saw this place one day and suggest we go there and give it a try as that is our hobby living in Vegas to try any place we have not been before at home or when we travel. Sometimes it is a fantastic surprise and sometimes it is a disaster. The chef/owner came and introduce himself and told us he was at the Wynn for 10 years and that sets me up to have high expectations. I am pleased to say, it does not disappoints as the room is cute and pleasant with a nice park view, parking is abundant and the food is great! Fruit is fresh and the croissant is as good as any in Paris, all the little things are done right, the egg in my croissant is slightly browned and portions are good for humans but not gluttons so don't expect a feeding trough but a civilized portion! Tomato soup is note worthy, perfect balance of flavor and texture, it is common to be over salted and this one is not. Coffee is good and hot and the dessert which we took home was a very nice surprise for a breakfast place, is it as good as Angelina  in Paris? Certainly not as elaborate but for what they do make, comparable and that is a high praise if you ever been to Angelina in Paris. In finally, we will be back with friends and I honestly do think one thing they can do and that is to raise the price a little, for what they serve, they deserve a few more dollars, that is what I think of this place, enough said.",Wi_PIYFGV0GP3uDn7A285w,0,0,5,mzPwaNK71g6xc_9oMekmXw

Now I never ate here before. And i still haven't.  I ordered my food today at 1pm for delivery.  The app EAT 24 said the food would be picked up and out for delivery 10-30 min after food was ready.  My food was not delivered until 4pm.  By then i had to go to work and get food elsewhere.   It was quite upsetting.  When the food finally came, the delivery guy made it seem like because my roommate received the food 3 hours later all was forgiven.  I ordered food with enough time to have it prepped, delivered, and eaten. The food arrived inedible, old, and soggy. My roomie ended up receiving 3 hour old breakfast burritos and pancakes that were held in a sweat box of a person's car, who has no business doing deliveries.

My mom was interested after seeing their Instagram photos so we came in. As soon as we walked in, we weren't acknowledged at all and were standing awkwardly behind a table of seated guests. Two employees looked at us but said nothing; one of them even walked right in front of us but still said nothing. 

Finally, we were acknowledged by someone at the cash register. She said it would be a few minutes until we were seated. There were only a handful of tables taken so we were confused as to why we had to wait when there were so many tables that weren't taken. Turns out, no one thought it'd be a good idea to clear and clean the tables after patrons left. Literally every table was still full of used plates and cups! Then one of the employees tried seating us at one of these tables when I noticed there was a table literally right next to the door that was clean so we told her we'd rather sit there than at a dirty table. She sat us down and then walked away. We didn't even get to place our drink order for almost 5 minutes because she took so long to come back to us.

After we were finally able to place our food and drink order, we got our drinks pretty quickly (I mean, it was a latte and orange juice). I was a bit confused because she placed our drinks down and left without asking if I wanted sugar (which is typical since some people like to put sugar in their lattes). I took a sip anyway and it was SWEET. I like my lattes sweet so I enjoyed it but for those who prefer a latte, well, to taste like a latte, this is not what you'd expect. I think they should have removed the sweetness factor and give patrons the option to sweeten it to their preference because not everyone expects their lattes to come pre-sweetened. Or, they should have asked if I wanted it pre-sweetened or not. 

Our meals didn't create any sparks, so nothing to particularly rave about. We weren't happy with the lack of cleanliness and desire to clean up the tables after being used, the extremely slow and lackluster customer service, and food that didn't live up to the hype. Perhaps it was an off day, but the three things I just mentioned shouldn't happen anyway.",Jc-bW5Mzktn0o65r3-I1aw,0,0,2,0O3VfJce5gy1jyaDcMBd0g

I was pleasantly surprised to see an eclectic breakfast/lunch menu that includes both some gourmet touches mixed with a good balance of more traditional food options. 

Deciding on the 9th Island French Toast, I was looking forward to a delicious experience. While good, the french toast fell short of expectations. It was not remotely as sweet or sumptuous as I would expect from standard french toast at any other breakfast place. The fruit offered at an additional cost was also nothing significant, though aesthetically on point, and was essentially room temperature. Particularly for the price ($13.75 with The fruit add), I certainly expected something more memorable. I also was not offered a glass or ice for my can of diet coke. Seems strange, but not a huge issue for me. 

All that being said, the food was decent and I will definitely return to try some of the other intriguing items on the menu to see if I better connect with a different item. The service itself was fast and the food was attractively plated. A gentleman, who I assume is the owner or at least manager, did stop by after my meal to check on me. He seemed concerned with the flavor, which makes me wonder if they have had complaints. I will say that I did not raise my concern at that time because overall everything was decent and they may intentionally be trying to downplay the sweetness of the dish. He also requested a review if I used Yelp, which is always a positive sign for a brand new restaurant.",kYzcmzwXRLkPgfnX5EMK3Q,1,3,4,oH7vmEel9c0QGsTLwMR01g

I was really excited to try the Dirty Fork Lunch Special with the prosciutto wrapped arugula which is what I have been seeing on the YELP menu and the Eat 24 menu but when I got there they had changed it to salmon. I didn't even notice the change on their menu and proceeded to show the Yelp and Eat 24 menu to everyone working there because after months of anticipation I was disappointed. Well much to my surprise they brought me a complimentary plate of prosciutto to make up for the confusion. Apparently they changed their menu but Yelp and Eat 24 hadn't had updated it yet. I admit I was a tad bit dramatic about the issue but I take my food seriously lol. The Lunch Special was amazing both ways. Salmon and prosciutto. I loved the decorations and waiter was very good. I'll definitely be back to try the French toast and pancakes! Don't understand the negative reviews.

2991972,2018-06-25,1,8chcaZIRlP4p5anpzUB3FQ,"I was REALLY looking forward to dining at The Dirty Fork. 3 girlfriends and I decided to meet here for our monthly breakfast date. We had a groupon to use and were excited when we looked at the menu. 

We arrived when there was only two other tables occupied so it was lovely and quiet. The server greeted us but immediately seemed frazzled just getting us water. 

My 3 year old son tagged along as well and I asked for an orange juice for him, to which she replied, ""Well that will be a little while because I have to squeeze it and everything."" Okkkkk....was she trying to convince me not to get it? Then I said, ""Ok, do you have kids sizes? It's just for my little guy."" She started walking away and said, ""No we have one size. It's five dollars so, it doesn't matter who orders it."" 

Then came the ordering of other drinks. She came back and asked what we'd like. I told her I was fine with water. My friend across from me asked for orange juice, which she again told us it would be a bit since she had to squeeze it. Then my other friend ordered an iced coffee (which is on the menu), to which the server responded, ""We don't have cappuccino or anything, we're basically out of everything today. We didn't get our delivery."" My friend told her, ""That's fine I just wanted regular iced coffee."" She said, ""Ok I don't have beans or anything."" So my friend said, ""So do you have coffee?"" and the server said, ""Yeah I can make regular iced coffee."" ........?!?!?!?!?!?!?? Then my next friend asked for a latte....oh brother, the server was clearly pissed now. She said, ""I don't have stuff for lattes. Do you just want water?"" My friend said, ""What are your assorted teas?"" (Listed that way on the menu) and the server said, ""We have green tea and English breakfast."" My friend told her she'd have English breakfast with lemon, and the server said, ""Not honey? Usually it comes with honey."" 

Ok, moving on to food. We ordered and had no issues ordering the food, all of which was fantastic. The saving grace of this place was the food was fantastic. 

Now it's time to pay. I thought her head might explode. We told her about the Groupon in the beginning but she brought the check without taking it off, so my friend said, ""Oh you forgot the Groupon"" and she said, ""Oh well you know you shouldve reminded me.""  She then looked at the paper printout my friend brought and said, ""Can't you pull it up on your phone so i can redeem it immediately? Otherwise we have to send it in and it's a big pain for him."" (""Him"" being the owner, i presume?) My friend tried to pull it up but was not getting service in the restaurant so the server (tapping her fingers on the table) said, ""Ugh I'll just take this. I just don't want it to kick back to him that it doesn't work."" Then she took it and came back with the adjusted check and we handed her our credit cards asking her to split it 4 ways evenly. She said, ""Oh I cant Split the check or the Groupon won't work."" I said, ""Oh we're not splitting it, we're just paying with multiple forms of payment. That shouldn't matter."" She said, ""No I can't. You'll have to pay for it with one form of payment."" As a former waitress, I was floored by her behavior and terrible service up to this point but this response was laughable. Finally I decided to just pay for it and we had to get it figured out how much each owed and how to Venmo it. All while my newborn was screaming. 

Time to go. We said goodbye to each other and as I went to grab my son, the server snatched the paybook off the table which caused my keys to fall. As I'm holding my car seat in my arm and my sons hand with my other arm, she didn't even pick them up. 

Bottom line, as a diner, I don't care one bit what you're out of or why, what inconvenience you might incur because of a coupon program YOU participated in, the fact that you only have ONE server and by the time we left there were 8 tables of people, or the mood of said server because she's dealing with all these issues. 

They say you come for the food but you come back for the service. I WILL NEVER COME BACK TO THIS PLACE. For $5 per glass of juice, and $12.50 for 2 tiny Nutella crepes with one spoonful of whipped cream, you better be kissing my ass, and this was a joke.",l8kyfsIWh0B_eZ6HOCwZpw,2,0,2,jQGqeSod9Nq-NA3BYPEgiA

forget the guy with the long hair in the kitchen picking he's nose and teeth but the idiotic server lady just watching him and not even reacting to he's nose and teeth picking, of course they didn't realize we where watching them. 
Our food came and of course we didn't touch it, much less pay, we wanted to let management know but supposedly there was no manager on duty, a few minutes later this old lady with some horrible lip piercing acting like a manager or something try to talk to us but my friend ignored her and so did I as soon as I realized she was the old lady with the dogs in the kitchen!!!!!!

3492287,2017-07-28,2,8chcaZIRlP4p5anpzUB3FQ,"I was excited to try this place but I was very disappointed with the results.

I stopped by around 1pm with a friend. I had already looked up the menu and Yelp reviews prior to arriving. The place was empty except for people at a few of the two top tables by the windows. We ended up sitting at one of the bigger tables for 4 in the middle. The restaurant was warm. I'm cold natured so I'm figuring it was over 80° in there for me to even notice. All of the tables have the same kind of chairs, hard wooden with decorative designs on the back. They obviously don't want anyone hanging around. My back was killing me after just over an hour in these chairs. 

We sat at the table for about 4 minutes before the cook came to give us menus (the waiter was focused on the few couples at the tables on the wall & cleaning dirty tables). The waiter came and took our drink order. I ordered a diet soda. It came in a can with a glass of ice that was melted into half water when presented to me. My friend received water no ice, no straw (she never asked for no ice and wanted a straw). We decided on what to order, a few minutes later we placed our order. I ordered a short stack of pancakes with coconut syrup. My friend ordered 2 scrambled eggs and a bagel(btw- they charge $1 extra for cream cheese on the bagel). While placing our order someone came in to sit at the counter. We waited and waited and waited for our food.  The guy at the counter got his food, ate, and left before we were served even though we ordered first. The cook was walking around, hanging out at the register, and certainly in no rush. It was about 30/40 minutes before we got our food. Finally the cook brings over our food. He drops it off with no silverware. We see him speaking to the waiter at the end of the counter (no customers/no register there, he was doing something by himself). The cook begins rolling some silverware. He brings it back to us 3 minutes after dropping off the food.

I was very disappointed that my item was not was described on the menu. Instead of coconut syrup on the pancakes, it had shredded coconut (which I don't like) and regular maple syrup. Either they are out of the coconut syrup (& didn't mention it) or their menu is written incorrectly. I didn't even feel like trying to get it corrected because it took so long to get this. I ate about a 1/4 of one pancake after scraping off the shredded coconut. 

I asked for the check. The waiter brought it and took my debit card. After 10 minutes I had to ask for my card back.  He didn't have it in his hands and I was getting concerned that I saw him return one to someone that gave theirs a couple minutes after I gave mine. He was confused that he hasn't given it back and went looking for it. He returned it to me a couple of minutes later. I wasted $20 on 2 scrambled eggs, a bagel (no cream cheese), a canned soda, & 2 inedible pancakes.

TLDR: This place is over hyped. The service is incompetent in the afternoon. The menu doesn't match what you get. Waste of time and money.",csEL3VrnnX-T2rWX16v3nA,3,0,1,rChSJ1oqF9XFYFQ71mL9nw

There's a decent sized dining area and also a counter you can sit at that looks into the kitchen. 

Their menu isn't very focused. There's some Hawaiian inspired fare that seems to be the main attractions and also shows the most creativity. Then there's some French and American dishes thrown in, along with a breakfast burrito. So, it's a hodgepodge of breakfast and lunch stuff that's probably good for their bottom line, but doesn't really show what they're about or where they want to take this restaurant.

On my first visit, shortly after they opened, I only grabbed a couple pastries. At the time they were outsourcing their pastries and the product was poor with the chocolate croissant soggy and limp and the almond croissant tasting like it was days old.

A second, more recent visit, showed much improvement. First, a thick, biscuit-like scone to start. Followed by their 9th Island French toast. Using a sweet Hawaiian bread, it's more like a dessert, but if you like sweets, you'll love this dish, especially when it's drenched in coconut syrup and guava cream cheese.

This place shows some promise but will have to re-focus their menu and improve their pastries.",C2C0GPKvzWWnP57Os9eQ0w,9,5,3,0fg2rVElJ89yE-BiBKB5UA

The chef and the serve both came out to say sorry and that they just opened. 

Second time, I came with girl friend since I saw there was a Groupon special. I wanted my Eggs Benedict that I had last time and the server let me know the menu has changed due to a change of owners. Well, basically everything REALLY changed because the food wasn't as good and the service was even worst then the last time I was here. We ordered a kale salad since my friend saw a picture of it and it came out completely different with mixed green salad and just a few pieces of baby kale. My friend also ordered orange juice and a cranberry juice for her and her daughter. The juice cups were the size of a kids meal cup and charging $3 for cranberry and $4 for OJ.

I got the 9th Island French Toast and he got the Dirty Fork yumminess chicken French toast strawberry thing. Coffee was very good. Orange juice fresh squeezed. A bit of a bummer they don't have mimosas or bloody Marys. The reason for the low stars is I ordered 3 chocolate croissants to go. They were pricey but my kids love them. They were so stale my kids took one bite and tossed them. I even took a bite before the toss and it was not good.

3807290,2017-03-11,2,8chcaZIRlP4p5anpzUB3FQ,"The food gets 4 stars for me. It's a good solid breakfast and different from the many breakfast spots in Vegas, but really nothing special in comparison to the incredible brunch spots Los Angeles has to offer. I would say the uniqueness is on the higher end of the Las Vegas scale but dead center average on a Los Angeles scale.

The thing that stood out the most about this restaurant is the timing. It took quite some time to get our order in (15 min), 30 min from the time of ordering to get our coffees, an additional 15 min to get our food (45 min from the time of ordering), then an additional 5 min to get our silverware to actually enjoy the food sitting in front of us.  

The problem with this restaurant is not lack of staff, but rather lack of organization and structure. Breakfast is not a hard meal to prepare and is rather quick. Maybe they don't have their routine in place or methods of handling a full restaurant but something needs to change in this restaurant.

At this point, although the food was good, I do not think I'll be coming in for a sit down meal anytime soon.",G6VespdVV3R4XInKgFDMDw,9,2,3,flNoa1uDOBrtMY2C94vGEw
3813541,2018-06-15,9,8chcaZIRlP4p5anpzUB3FQ,"Solid breakfast and lunch spot on the West side of town. My most recent visit was during a 3 hour wait time at the DMV down the road and decided to use Yelp to try out a new place to eat at since I had so much time before the DMV would call me up. Dirty Fork was previously bookmarked in my profile but I left it in my bookmarked section for awhile and remember seeing a few delicious looking posts from various Yelpers. 

Upon arrival, I was greeted by Maggie and was seated promptly and given a Menu. She was quite knowledgeable of what is offered. It took me some time to decide what I wanted but I ended up with an order of the 9th Island French Toast with fresh fruits. When it arrived, I was like, ""Aloha!"" It was so big and filing. The actual Toast is made with Hawaiian Sweet Bread and was paired well with the Guava Cream Cheese. Every bite was scrumptious and mouth watering. I would come back for this if I wanted to an order of carb overload, lol. Great to share with someone or needing a delicious cheat day. Kudos to Jose, the cook for the Day. I wanted to try a few items but they were out of certain ingredienta so I was quite bum. However, I will come back to try more of their delicious food and if im feeling home sick. Mahalo Dirty Fork!

I've eaten here twice, and will be back many more times. When you're at the Dirty Fork, you feel like family. Do yourself a favor and get the hot coffee - it's not your typical diner coffee. A turkish roast with phenomenal mouth-feel, each sip is a buttery treat for your taste buds. 

The avocado toast will BLOW YOU AWAY with smoked salmon, fresh fruit, greek yogurt, sunflower seeds and the most perfectly poached eggs I've ever encountered. I didn't want this meal to end. 

The french toast is a feast, I took half of mine home! French toasted Hawaiian sweet bread topped with scrambled eggs, chicken tender nuggets, fresh sweet strawberries, and fresh whipped cream. Holy moly. 

My husband says the burger was one of the best in Vegas, and the fatty burrito was bomb.com - his words, not mine.

1) Walking in, no one greeted us. Not even a smile nothing, it took awhile for someone to notice, it was not until we were about to walk out they acknowledged us. Service sucks! Especially Fatih, the misogynistic fool aka manager. 
2) The chicken panini's bread tasted stale & literally had only 3 small strips of chicken.
3) Hawaiian French toast was sad. The ""guava cream cheese"" literally was a teaspoon of flavorless junk. Bread tasted like it was re-microwaved & the fruit tasted overripe, overall totally dissatisfied with the food.
.... totally dissatisfied, with absolutely everything the food & service, took one bite & we were done and decided to pack the food To Go .

.... we returned from our car to find out they did not give us the coconut syrup rather they gave us regular syrup.. so we requested for some coconut syrup.. here's where it becomes good. This arrogant, chunky, misogynistic fool starts yelling at us, saying that he's the manager/cook FATIH & that he did in fact place coconut syrup in our order. There was another worker in the back that told him that he in fact put maple & basically told him to shut up. At this point, we were heated, he literally started YELLING at us basically saying he's right & we are wrong. Now, we are just disgruntled & kindly asked for a refund, & returned the food. Now this misogynistic fool, FATIH starts yelling & saying NO REFUND (like an angry bulldog) & that only the owner can approve it. After arguing, his pettiness, on a business card, writes a note with the amount of the toast for ""store credit"". Now, I ask him for a # to call the owner... he gives me the same # on his card. Turns out the customer outside told us that him & his wife owns the place & and that customer ended up leaving as well.

My friend and I entered the store around 1:02, we got seated and waited. It took about 10 mins for the someone to realize we did not have any menus and have been waiting for someone to come help us. We our waters a couple minutes later and order our food within 20 mins of arrival. It was extremely busy during the time we went. My friend and I literally waited almost an hour afterwards for our food (which I have no complaints about). There was only TWO chefs working and cooking all the food for everyone and it took extremely long. I was certainly not expecting to wait so long for average tasting food. This was such a hinderance on my time. 

Not only that but my other friend order an acai bowl and it literally came out like soup!! with barely any fruit or granola or anything to mask the horrid taste. For $11.50 it was certainly not worth every penny. Although I do thank management for giving her extra honey, extra granola, and extra fruit - because girl let me tell you that acai bowl was well very bland.

I got their avocado toast (I can't go anywhere without trying any place's avo toast for some reason) & a 9th Island French Toast which were both delicious. The avocado was only 1 slice of wheat toast with a lot of greens, 2 poached eggs & the avocado spread of course. You can get it with smoked salmon & cream cheese if you'd like as well. The French toast was 3 slices of sweet Hawaiian bread with fruit & very yummy coconut syrup. 

My SO got a side of bacon, hash browns, & 2 eggs & a Take Me to Belgian Waffles with fruit & he expected more than just 1 Belgian waffle.. 

We both got coffee & everything tasted great. But we didn't expect our brunch bill to come out to almost $60.. for it to fill our stomachs contently. I recommend to not order sides to prevent it from being costly.

I bought a groupon for this place and was excited to try a new hip neighborhood eatery so I came there with my family one morning. We stood up at the door waiting for a waiter or a host but after waiting a good 7 minutes, we tried to get one of the waiter to help us but they were too busy running around serving others. Tables were dirty, this place is understaffed. We then decided to take a long table by the door but a mean looking lady at the cashier just yelled at us and said ""give us a moment"". A moment? We've been standing infront of her for now about 15 minutes and that's the respond we'll get? And still no waiter or waitress attending us. The excitement went out the window when we waited for so long for service so we got up and we all left to go to another breakfast joint.  
Like I said I messaged this place on Instagram messaging hoping to be able to help improve their service but I was ignored. ( made me feel like I was on the wrong for giving my concern) No reply, no apology, no thank you for letting us know either.

I'm apologize if you're reading this I'm horrible with remembering names) was what made my experience a 5 star one.

The menu here is awesome, so my family of four gave it another whirl, but our most recent visit was absolutely awful. A table that arrived after us (another group of four) were seated, served, presented their check, paid their bill and left before we got our food. They sent food out for 3 of 4 people at the table with no explanation on the missing plate, which we had to wait another 15 minutes for. Of the three meals that came out, all three were wrong- one set of poached eggs were undercooked and tasted strongly of vinegar, another meal was doused in sauce we ordered it without, and blueberry pancakes were raw in the center and oozed batter when we cut into them. The waitress, who was very apologetic and moderately embarrassed, returned the bad meals to the kitchen. While waiting for the second round of food, the manager came over and we shared what was happening, asking about the still missing fourth meal. She apologized and offered a free dessert, which we declined. About ten minutes later, we got new pancakes (which were good), and replacements for the other two meals. Of these, one set of poached eggs was over cooked (completely hard). The fourth meal was still missing at this point, and my son was nearly in tears.

My second juice was not charged and they did not let us use the Groupon for it was a weekend. We had check in on yelp but did not get to have the free soda. What a fucking waist of time and money.

I ordered my son a fruit cup with a butter croissant. I don't mind paying $5 for a fruit cup as long as the quality of the fruit is worth it, in this case it definitely wasn't. Fruit was soggy and didn't seem so fresh. The croissant wasn't that great either. I would've rather had a croissant from Starbucks. 

I had the Hawaiian style fried rice (I think that's what it was called) for about $11, and I was expecting a huge portion for that price. But no, it was small and the rice was kind of hard. Didn't care for it. The mac salad was also unusual, I didn't like it either. We also got the Loco Moco, which was kind of bland. 

The service was HORRIBLE. We had a good start when we came in, there was a guy with glasses, he was nice. But nobody came to refill our coffees, til we asked. If we didn't ask, I'm pretty sure nobody would've came. Nobody came to check on us to see how we were doing, literally not even once. I made my boyfriend go up and pay for our meal because I knew nobody was gonna come to ask us if we wanted the check. The man with the black shirt that showed his stomach hanging out and the beard, dropped off our food and he did not look happy to be there lol. I was watching him interact with the table sitting in front of us and he looked like he hated his job, I thought it was pretty funny that he had such a crappy attitude. 

Needless to say, we left a really bad tip. And I probably won't ever come back. The only thing I really cared for was the coffee.",ChQUPGg4Bh6R059hUwaQ8Q,4,1,2,EzP7FQex7PC9J1FgyNIhdQ

The menu consisted of what one would say ""exotic"" dishes. Lox on toast, Hawaiian bread toast with coconut syrup and guava or passion fruit cream cheese! They had this dish called the madame which is what I got, it was a surplus amount of ham and cheese, a spread of some mustard, and more Swiss cheese oozed on top of the sandwich and then finished with an Egg over easy as the cherry on top! The taste was absolutely indescribable, my partner had ordered the jade toast with the guava cream cheese, and I almost couldn't tell if this was breakfast or dessert for breakfast executed with perfection.

I came here when they first opened with my boyfriend & got the Vegas style toast which was good (obviously multigrain toast, avocado, smoked salmon how could you go wrong?). The only thing I didn't care for was the yogurt on the bottom on the plate but NBD

We then went a second time & I decided to get the Dirty Fork Lunch Special without pico de gallo and replaced the bread to multigrain.  Absolutely loved it.   

3rd time I went was with a girlfriend & I got the same Dirty Fork Lunch Special with my alterations.

The 4th and last time I went.  I had my boyfriend order since he arrived before me and I told him the vegas toast with no pico de gallo and multigrain toast.  But I meant the Dirty Fork Lunch Special & mixed it up.  So I received the Vegas style toast no pico de gallo (it doesn't originally have pico)

I'm aware that the order wasn't correct (honest mistake) but I do feel like the waitress should've known that the Vegas toast didn't have pico de gallo and maybe clarified that that was the correct order if she knowingly knew the Vegas toast had no pico.  When I tried to tell her I meant the Dirty Fork Lunch Special she said ""no problem let me try to alter it"".  THEN shortly came back and said she couldn't alter it and they would make the correct one.  THEN she came back again and told me I would get charged for both plates.  

It's disappointing when you go to a business when they first open & then they start to be ""cheap"" & not accommodate.  The owner has even recognized me the first 3 times prior.

I liked going here because the food was decent and close by to work.  They're over priced for the amount of food you get, I won't be coming back.  Take care of your customers & customer service determines if people will come back.

As we're waiting, I had to ask the server to refill my drink; that's a pet peeve of mine. She comes back with the French toast. I pause because I was about to remind her, but I just couldn't hold it.

3 stars for the food and coffee. They only have regular coffee no lattes or other specialities. They have a better breakfast menu than some places, but they didn't have what I wanted off the menu today which was the veggie sausage- were kosher so sometimes it's easier to eat vegetarian than to eat anything with meat. So I was also disappointed to find the only quiche they have here has bacon. I got steak and eggs and so the eggs wouldn't be cooked in butter I got them poached which I was happy they had that option even. I liked how the steak was served- they sliced it so it wasn't too hard to cut into bite size pieces. My husband got the avocado toast with lox which he liked but was still hungry after eating, so he got a chocolate danish. Over all good place- they just need to up their choices for vegetarians (kosher eaters alike) and get a proper latte machine. Also they should serve a homemade dressing for their salads perhaps, just an idea most French bistros and bakeries do this.

It was very slight, 20 minutes from when we were seated to when the food arrived. 

Bottom line, coffee was strong, our Breakfast Special was plated nicely with a lot of food, and not expensive at all. The chicken was quite juicy, as breastmeat aren't usually.

1. Seating - We wanted to sit in a 4-seater table (at least 2-3 tables available) but we were advised that they liked to reserve that for big parties, fair enough. 20 minutes passed by and no big party that came. 

2. Drinks - The person who sat us got our drink orders but it took them forever to get me a regular cup of coffee and they had no half-and-half which I found weird but ok. 

3. Order - It took about 20 minutes as well for them to come in and get our orders. I asked for crispy Belgian waffle, side of scrambled eggs with cheese, and a side of crispy bacon. My husband ordered avocado toast. This took more than 30 minutes and i noticed a couple who sat by the bar and who came in after us get their order first. The manager/owner came up to our table and said he was going to give us free dessert 'on the house,' because of the wait and apologized profusely. When my order came, it was a waffle with fruits and whipped cream. I asked our server if it normally came with fruit and he said, he wasn't going to charge me for the fruit and the cook was new and 'hooked me up.' Though it is normally nice to be 'hooked up,' please do not mess with my breakfast. Needless to say, my waffle wasn't crispy as it was doused in maple syrup, my eggs didn't have cheese and my bacon was not crispy. My husband's avocado toast, he was happy with though he found it weird there was yogurt on the plate of his avocado toast. I really don't understand how people can eff up breakfast food. What really got me was if I didn't ask about the fruit on my waffles, it appears they wouldn't have said anything about getting my order wrong. I like what I like what I like. 

4. Dessert - As for the promised dessert on the house, it never came. We asked for the bill and the manager/owner was nowhere to be found. I didn't ask for it as I just wanted to go. 

5. Seating, part 2 - A family of 5 came while we were in the midst of eating but other than that no other big party came. I told my husband (and this is going to sound so obnoxious), if by 10-ish, you don't have a list of people to be seated, I highly doubt you're going to fill your dining floor. We have been to too many breakfast places on Sunday to know this. 

6. Price - OVERPRICED. 

7. Service - We are not above tipping (up to 50%) if we get exceptional service. Sadly, this is not the case.

The cooks are out in the open & you can see the kitchen and the serving area, so you know exactly how long your food sits & waits once it is plated. Saturday afternoon, not too busy, & we were seated immediately. We ordered both breakfast and lunch items. The bacon was extra crispy. Burgers cooked well. Fries had an added herb/spice that made them savory over salty. Sadly, as we went to pay the owner elected to charge a ""Groupon tax"" after the fact. We use Groupon to test out a lot of new restaurants and we've never had to pay this fee. We contacted Groupon & they handled it for us, but it kinda spoiled the meal to argue with the manager over this random fee. Hopefully, they will fix this for their future customers.",n1cGg7NpJspFPUcyYO4lzw,4,0,2,hx_oOusCdSakdIzOUtle_w

5556376,2017-04-20,2,8chcaZIRlP4p5anpzUB3FQ,"I've been wanting to try this place out for a while and today I ran upon their deal on Groupon so I felt like that was a sign that it was finally time to try it out! We came in around 11:30am and were seated right away. I really enjoyed the interior and decor of the restaurant, I felt like it was very cute and quaint which is the perfect design for a breakfast/brunch place! :) The menus have two sides - one side for breakfast and the other for lunch. There were a variety of options which made it hard to choose but we decided to go for the ""Fatty Burrito"" and the ""Dirty Fork Lunch Special."" I subbed the bacon on the breakfast burrito for turkey bacon and salad instead of fresh fruit on the side and my bf subbed his side for hash browns with onions (which was phenomenal!). 

Our food took a while to come out considering the fact there was only two other tables in the restaurant but our server was super friendly and kept refilling our waters and reassuring us that our food would be out soon. I wasn't entirely impressed with the burrito and halfway while I was eating I noticed that I didn't get my pico de gallo that comes with it, but the server was able to bring me out a side of it immediately. my bf's entree was very delicious! It consisted of salmon, poached eggs, mushrooms, veggies, and butter on top of a whole grain toast - definitely recommend to try this dish! 

Overall, it was a good first time experience. The owner came around making sure we were enjoying our food and at the end, even gave us a flyer that gives us two free coffees on our next visit, yay!",rKdGiLfeE55TClso9GtjsA,1,2,4,Hgyx9qaoQdVsD7Fs0R2hnA

Ordered Sunrise Sammy, Breakfast special and couple sides including french fries, hash browns. We also requested to put fried chicken on the side instead of combining into our toast ( Breakfast special). 

As we shared our dishes, we got chances to try a bit of everything. So, it's weird to say but we actually like the side dishes than the main entrées we ordered!!! Toasts that were in the Breakfast special was too sweet and the fried chicken was dry and lack of flavour. Sunrise Sammy, which is a croissant stuffed with bacon, egg and cheddar, was very dry and not warm. Hash browns were the only dish we enjoyed eating... 

Staff were not very attentive and helpful. We had to wave a lot of time before they could spot us, which was an unpleasant experience.",xmy1y1htU7UfPy_T5AgrEw,0,0,3,ubbiyM4sOcioi2htX_ZS1w

My friend had the fatty burrito and I had the breakfast special with a side of Hawaiian rice. I feel the waitress was very accommodating  to all our requests . Everything came out delicious. My friend had a coupon for free coffee and when I checked in on Yelp we got a free soda, they honored both. I almost got some pastries to go but I was so full. The service was better-than- reviewed and my coffee never went empty. The waitress checked on us often. There was no wait to sit down, it was actually kind of dead inside. The only downside are the prices, they are a little higher than I expected but the flavor makes up for the price.

It's a small place, maybe 15 or so tables. Very clean and well decorated. My friend and I sat down and ordered our drinks, coffee for me and water for him. Both of these cups were never empty. They even bring a fancy bottle with water for your table...nice touch!

Service was excellent. Maybe because it wasn't crowded, but our server took his time and let us check out the menu, answered all questions with accuracy and knowledge, and did a great job. No complaint here.

On to the food. I had the 9th island French Toast, my friend the Dirty Fork breakfast special, which was chicken and eggs on top of french toast. Both were well cooked, and delicious. Coconut, passionfruit or guava syrup. Very enjoyable meal!

I'd come back, as would my friend. Prices were very fair, I think $11.95 for the French Toast.",wXZS42D0L8hoCiSh2Krc_A,3,3,4,L6nPIQUkvF1-B_SbAvSIdg

After food delivery she was busy training a guy and teaching him how to make cappuccinos. I needed a touch more syrup on my French toast. Secondly on the picture on yelp there was more yogurt looking substance on the French toast than 2 squirts literally. And it states on the menu that you can add fruit well DONT! It already comes with fruit and I didn't want any. The Sunrise Sammy is good but croissant is way too toasted that the ends are so hard I left it behind. Like the croissant was toasted over and over. Honestly, server didn't deserve tip; she bought water with no ice which I never once stated I DIDNT want ice, she took order and delivered. Than I went up to register asking to pay.

The French toast with fruit was tasty. The pancakes were a little on the dry side but huge portion. The tea sandwich came with tiramisu and macaroons. The spread on the sandwich we good, the tiramisu would've been better if it weren't so dry. Oh and fries which were awesome with ranch! The fries saved the rating! They were nice and crispy.
