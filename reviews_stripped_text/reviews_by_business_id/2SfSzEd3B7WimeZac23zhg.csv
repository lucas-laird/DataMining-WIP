24798,2015-08-23,0,2SfSzEd3B7WimeZac23zhg,"I have no idea how this place has a 4 star rating.  I had breakfast here with my husband on a Saturday morning.  We both ordered the House Breakfast, his no onions, mine no mushrooms.  The gentleman who served us our food set down a plate in front of me and told me there were no mushrooms even though there were clearly mushrooms on top and scrambled within the omelet.  I sent back the omelet and it took more than 10 minutes for them to serve me a new one.  Both omelets were huge and overcooked, the toasted sliced baguette tough and chewy, and the hashbrowns were lukewarm at best with a strange citrus flavor.  Everything was sadly underwhelming.  The only redeeming quality was the friendly manager on duty who stopped by to chat with us.  Unfortunately, we won't be dining here again.",QWUCx_phlA-LNq8ykamQgQ,1,0,1,aX-A9tHp9eNptVZt9T0p5Q
25753,2015-03-27,1,2SfSzEd3B7WimeZac23zhg,"I have been in Vegas for about 5 days for work - the company I work with has an office in Trivoli Village, making a stop at Leoné's cafe convenient on my way to, during, and from work. 

No matter what meal I enjoy, everything has been great. I get a cappuccino from here at least twice a day, and occasionally eat breakfast and lunch. All items on the menu are fresh, they are willing to accommodate special requests, and the speed at which the food comes to your table would rival some FastFood places around the world. 

I just finished eating their egg white wrap (breakfast is available all day), which they made without feta cheese for me. Their salad with apple, walnuts and chicken is a great, healthy alternative to the more heavier items on the menu - they enjoy putting cheese into many of their dishes, which you can ask them to remove if so desired (I am sure you would have gathered by now: I'm not a big fan of it! ;)). 

Above all, the service is always friendly and professional by the predominantly younger service team. Always a joy to eat here and I look forward to the next time I am in town.",vOlPtKtcYDKopg9esopUCw,1,0,5,jd9coGwE5TfsNfz6-biYfw

The food is always amazing, everything from the Leone Special to pasta to sandwiches to pizza to their delicious desserts. The staff is always accommodating, and goes above and beyond every visit. The one person that makes this place is Lior, the manager. He is always helping his team out, and talks to everyone. He truly cares about his patrons. We had a wonderful Mother's Day today.

The food is more than you expect from a cafe. My husband and I ordered omelets. They were much larger than expected and even came with juice. 

Their coffee is great! I'm very picky about my coffee. If you need a pick me up, I highly suggest the shot in the dark :)

The environment is very open. They have a ton of outdoor seating, but indoor seating is good too. Great place to go to for breakfast or just to grab coffee and hang out with your puppy.

I didn't get a chance to try their coffees, but had their iced passion tea that had the right amount of sweetness to it. Their display case is filled with tempting desserts, but look again! Be sure to ask for the price before you order, because you may be in for a pretty pastry with sticker shock. I ordered the charlot, a pastry made with ladyfingers, vanilla custard and topped with fruit, and was stunned to see it cost $5.75. I liked it, but a sandwich would get more bang for a few more dollars.

The servers check up on you from time to time after they bring out your order. They'll even ask if you'd like refills for your iced teas!

Go in line, place your order, and if you're dining in, they'll give you a number to place on your table. Sit anywhere you like but I definitely recommend the outdoor area. If you're hungry, get the champagne chicken berry salad and for coffee, my favorite is the cafe milano with almond milk. They have the option of soy milk or regular milk as well. Once you're done with your drink, there's free refills for coffee. As for dessert, I have never skipped out on it here. There's a pastry case in display and I usually will get a slice of cake. So far, the coconut cake wins it for me.

Leone is not the quietest but I used to frequent this place to study. Free wifi with no password and outlets available. Now, I tend to go here on days off to enjoy the ambiance. I try to catch the 9a fresh52 farmer's market held every Saturday when I can and stop by here to grab some coffee. Overall, solid coffeeshop.

I subtracted 3 Stars for these reasons:
-* for Unusually strong smelling cleaning products now in use. Smells like a 7-11 in Leone Cafe, not good for customers, employees, coffee or food. Unnecessary since one can use microfiber cloths and water and clean better!
-* for Insanely Loud and distorted music mindlessly playing  inside cafe. It's so loud you can't hardly hear person at your table. And the choice of music is terrible. Nothing nice and subtle.
-* for Fans on outdoor patio. They have 3 Small Fans installed in the ceiling in outdoor patio which are incredibly Loud! Tornado level! Be warned...

Note - The entire Tivoli Mall is now wired for outdoor sound. It is the most god-awful, loud, tasteless, mindless music you have ever heard in your life. The outdoor music is a total mismatch with the upscale mall and stores.

The only thing I can say is they are trying hard to run off what few customers they have.

I'm a bit of a coffee snob. I love good coffee, and I love that coffee more when it is artfully brewed. I'm a purist. I prefer black coffee or espresso. And I tend to think of flavors and cream as  something to mask mediocrity. But I digress. So I ordered the espresso and the husband ordered coffee. Delicious. Plus, we received sparkling water, as is common practice in foreign countries where they celebrate it's play against the coffee on the palate. Perfect. There was also free water available, flavored beautifully with cucumber. 
I'm already happy. And then the food. We ordered a sandwich and a quiche. The sandwich was well prepared and incredibly tasty. And then there was the quiche. I'm generally not a huge fan of them. Can't really say I've ever met one that I enjoyed. But the husband is a big fan. Upon trying a bite, I understood his love of them. The crispy flaky crust, the tender, melt-in-your mouth fluffiness of egg. Oh goodness, this is what it's supposed to taste like. It was amazing. The husband said a true quiche should have some parsley in it, but I was more concerned with the deliciousness than authenticity. 
Both the food and coffee can only be described as made with love here. I'm sure I'll be back repeatedly until I've sampled a majority of those delicious-looking desserts that beckoned my name when ordering. Mmmmm.",dOBVvU3YFkGjlAAtyKO2dQ,0,0,5,TutHuBjYzzJhFpF4TmaOHg

The cakes and pastries are super expensive but they are not fresh, they taste nothing and you can find on the strip high pastries and cakes quality for a cheaper price ! The manager is a cheap person who's looking for cheap products to make as much profit as possible, doesn't care about the quality he can deliver to his customers. The people at the cashier never smiles, they don't look happy to work there... a very negative place. I absolutely don't recommend it.

I have been coming to Leone Cafe since they opened at Tivoli for an afternoon coffee or business meeting because they serve great coffee and pastries in a very nice setting. 
Last saturday morning I took my wife and daughter to Tivoli for the farmers market and we enjoyed a very nice breakfast at Leone. this is certainly a hot spot in mornings (which I had not previously experienced)
we ordered the following:
Belgium waffle -  topped with fresh fruit and had blueberries inside along with a trio of sirup, nuttella and jam to accompany. 

yogurt parfait- granola and fresh fruit

egg sandwich- very good and served with a side salad

Iced Mocha 

OJ

everything was great although the sandwich tasted a bit ""par cooked"" but I am sure they are working with a minimal cook line and trying to make it all work.

we especially love the outside seating on a day where there is so much happening in the shopping center and a band playing.

BTW, coffee and teas are always free refills here :)

A nice place for group gathering with the variety of selections and also great for solo eater just wants to be left alone, enjoy food and/or play on computer.  I usually meet friends here for breakfast/brunch because I know everyone will have a great time.

You order your food at the counter, you put the number they give you on your table, and your food gets delivered :)  I always think it incredible that they hunt down the entire outdoor and indoor seating to find your number, especially during the weekends when there are loads of people.

Tivoli Village is pretty empty in general, which is quite unfortunate, but Leone Cafe is always full of people having a good time either enjoying a full meal or just snacks/drinks.  

I'm usually here for breakfast, so can't comment on other food besides breakfast. But I love their breakfast croissant sandwich, crepes and wraps.  And they're always happy to customize it for your needs, usually without any extra charges.  

It's hard to find 100% friendly service restaurants/cafes nowadays, usually a hit and miss, but I have to say with the hundreds of times I've been to Leone, I've never been disappointed at either the food or the service.  It's a great casual spot to hang out.

Once that happened, you realize that this restaurant is stocked floor to ceiling with young, attractive staff; it's nice to see young people being so productive!  We ordered a bunch of dishes and for the most part, the food was satisfactory (they could make a better steak sandwich, to be honest), but the killjoy was the stray thin strand of hair on one of the plates.

1059417,2016-05-22,1,2SfSzEd3B7WimeZac23zhg,"Well ... the darling Orchid was shopping at Charming Charlie's here at Tivoli Village, so it was time to go get a drink and some Wi-Fi time.  So ... iced tea at Leone.

While I was killing time, my darling phoned and said she was finished.  I asked her if she was either hungry or thirsty.  (She's almost always thirsty; the medications she takes tend to dry out her mouth.)  She said she was hungry, so I went and walked her down.

(DISCLAIMER - IN THE INTEREST OF FULL DISCLOSURE, I WILL MENTION THAT THIS WOULD BE THE SECOND TIME THAT SHE AND I HAD BEEN THERE FOR FOOD.)

The last time we ate there, she had the lasagna and I had a sandwich - which 'wich (sorry ... couldn't resist) I have forgotten.  My sandwich was as good as I expected for this price point.  Her lasagna was HUGE  I ended up with about half of it.  This time, I intended to have the lasagna.  When we arrived, we saw on the counter, just being picked up by the server, a salad of some kind with a mound of yellow something-I-couldn't-identify beside it on the plate.  Inquiry - it was a more-or-less deconstructed egg salad sandwich.  The egg salad was dished out on the plate, and the veggies that normally went into the sandwich were replaced with a small portion of their house salad mix.  (Note that this preparation is not on the menu, but of you ask really nicely - ""please, please, oh PLEEZE"" - they'll make it that way for you.)

So ... here comes the food.  My lasagna was, once again, HUGE.  A truly massive portion of meat,. cheese, eggplant with traditional noodles, having been oven-fired at some time, where the crispy-almost-burnt pasta made its appearance.  (That's one of my favorite parts, kinda like the lasagna equivalent of barbeque burnt ends.)  Orchid's egg salad ""salad"" was, to her and my taste, quite nice.  I am not a big egg salad fan, but I would order this myself.  They have unlimited iced tea refills, but they have no soda fountain, so you order soft drinks by the bottle - you want more, you pay for more ... which is about the only knock I have on the place.

The manager, a delightful fellow named Jonathan, came by a couple of times to ask how we were doing.  One of the servers, a fellow who looked to be about 22 or 23, whose name I didn't catch, also came by a couple of times to inquire, and engage in a moment or two of conversation.  Very attentive all the way around.  Orchid and I will certainly be back.

1314363,2011-05-24,6,2SfSzEd3B7WimeZac23zhg,"How do you make a non-aerodynamic location, without flight attendants or pilots smell like an airplane? Simple: 1 part new building smell, 1 part central air-conditioning, 2 parts roasted coffee beans, and voila! Instant airplane smell!

Like most new places in Vegas, this place looks really nice, but the setup is a bit strange. It feels like I am in a train station or airport terminal. Again, this may just be because it smelled like an airplane and my mind just drifted to those associated memories, but the mind is a funny thing. 

I digress. 

The reason I am giving this place 4 stars, and it's a big reason is: The opera cake is delicious. I've had opera cakes before, but this one takes the cake (pun fully intended). In the words of the barista that recommended this selection, ""It will change your life."" I don't know if I would go so far as to say that I left with two stone tablets and 10 commandments to share with the chosen people (read: facebook), but I definitely left with a happy tummy and warm memories of ganache spread across layers of chocolate mousse and fluffy chocolate pastry. It is definitely worth ordering, especially if you love chocolate. Definitely not airplane food.

The siblings and I originally wanted to go on a coffee adventure, but decided to incorporate food, so we Yelped this place out. Of course it was our first time at the establishment, thus making it an adventure. 
Was definitely crowded by the time we got there around 10:30-11AM on a Saturday morning. Kinda chilly outside, but we had no choice since the restaurant's indoor area was full. No biggie. I realize what time of day we were going, but...
Going inside, we weren't greeted or acknowledged until my sister said she was ready and went straight for the cashier to start placing an order. We were kinda flustered - took us a good minute to find the laminated food menu, separate from coffee menu up top, thinking all they had were displayed breakfast pastries. Not to mention that by the time we all ordered on 1 bill, the cashier was pretty... Eh. LOL. Seriously? What happened to the smile and chit chat you were having with everyone else working behind the counter? You wait to stop the chatting once customers get up there? I also realize it was cold out, but with that amount of workers behind the counter, no one really checked on outdoor patrons? There were about 2-3 other tables that were occupied with ours. We only got checked on once aside from bringing out the food and drinks, then taking our plates away in 2 trips. Anyway...
We enjoyed our drinks. Had the flavors we were looking for. The food was fulfilling and fresh. The sister had a Scone and Banana Nutella Crepe, brother-in-law and brother had the Leone Breakfast Croissant, and I had the Southwest Breakfast Wrap. Only criticism my family had was that the Scone was a bit dry. So yeah... Food was good. 
Would it be a place we'd like to go to more often? Not really. Maybe if a food craving drove us there. That or relatives living on that side wanted to go. Sorry, but this place gave us a silly first impression, especially since outdoor elements already made us slightly uncomfortable that service could've made up for. If my siblings aren't happy, I'm honestly going to be more displeased. That's putting this all mildly.",WdD8hWn-NjSyDYoHqin_tQ,3,1,3,Djj0dv4v_p_gKyIE1c7R2A

The omelette came without chicken so I brought it to the  counter where they offered to bring a side of chicken. The side of grilled chicken came and I ate 1/2 of it with the omelette. I took the rest home, refrigerated it, then grilled it lightly for dinner. The entire next day I was sick as a dog with typical food poisoning symptoms. And as with food poisoning, it had passed by Monday evening.

After carefully reviewing what I ate Sunday, I'm convinced the chicken was the culprit. Either the chicken was under-cooked (it seemed ok), or more than likely, the cook used the same tongs to plate the chicken that he used to place the raw breast on the grill ... a common restaurant practice called cross-contamination.

2005532,2013-12-27,4,2SfSzEd3B7WimeZac23zhg,"This review is for coffee and the pastries. 

I came in with Amelinda L. and Teresa S. last week after we had just grabbed dinner at View Wine Bar. After walking in, we were informed by one of the staff members that some of the pastries were 1/2 off. Great. As we took a closer look at the cakes and tarts at the counter, we were appalled to see a lot of not-so-hot looking little guys there. We're talking smudged frosting, and fruit that had been sitting out too long, i.e. strawberries that were shriveling and browning, plus a dried kiwi. Oh wait, no, it's just a kiwi slice that has seen better days.

When looking at the pastries we asked a couple questions:

Us: What is this pastry here? 
Guy: Uh...this is the caramel, and this is the strawberry, and I'm not sure (runs off to ask a coworker)
Girl (who swoops in): That's a caramel, this is the strawberry chocolate, and that's the chocolate. It's my favorite!

I love nondescriptive answers! Thanks for the enlightenment. Like I couldn't figure it out by the caramel drizzle, the strawberry sitting atop the second choice, and the chocolate garnish on the third. 

Worst of all, the conversation when ordering went like this:

Me: I'd like two Nutella cappuccinos and the pumpkin latte - all medium size please.
The same guy as earlier: Um, what size do you want the latte?
Me: A medium? 
Guy: OK
Me: I'd also like the strawberry chocolate cake and the carrot cake.
Guy: OK
Me: How much are those?
---Guy runs off to check, and at this time the girl in the front proceeds to tell me again that some of the pastries were 1/2 off---

Terrible. Hot mess express. When I pointed out that some of the tarts were severly dried out to the girl, she said ""No, those are fine!"" What a lie! Seriously, is this amateur hour? The two stars are for the barista..who seems to actually have a clue, since our drinks were totally on par. The rest of it though? No thank you.",Lo0GIJ5H9p3vwUTIcraNwA,8,3,2,CQQF-X7kfpCW_BOxtnIEPQ

How it works: you place your order at the counter, they'll give you a number, and the servers will deliver your food when it's ready. 

Food:

Shakshoka skillet: comes with chorizo, avocado, marinara sauce, 2 eggs (I got over easy eggs), and 2 prices of bread. I thought the chorizo was mixed in with the dish but instead it was placed on the side. And you only get 3 dingy pieces. At least give me a few more pieces! However, the flavor was good and there were plenty of veggies in it. 

Medium chai latte: I should've gotten the large! It wasn't overly sweet so this is something I would get again. Only thing is I wished they served it a bit hotter temperature wise. 

Service here is great! The waitress and the owner was attentive and always made sure our water was filled. Some people in the group got bottomless mimosas and the waitress did a great job of refilling those too.

Ordering was easy. Go up to the counter, order, take your number and seat yourself. 

Food and drinks came out promptly. We ordered an iced mocha and chai latte which were both delicious. As for the food, we got an avocado toast with egg ($10.99 without egg. +$2 with.) and a tuna melt ($9.50). The avocado toast was piled high with so much unnecessary greens. It was extremely difficult to eat. The balance between toast and avocado was way off that it just became a soggy mess.  It didn't help that I got an over easy egg on top. The tuna melt was.... different. It had some kind of spice that one would normally not expect in a tuna melt. It also had corn in it.

The bread was rather forgettable (I have a particular aversion to crunchy bread), but the orange juice!!!! I know, it is just OJ, but this orange juice was AMAZING!! Just delicious- I could seriously drink it all day long! The latte was also very good, strong and flavorful, and of course with a fancy design in the foam.

This place is very popular, so of course it gets crowded and you may have a bit of a wait for a table, especially on a nice day. There is outside seating, and both the inside and outside is lovely.

Weird and inconsistent, as my drink was in a ""real"" mug.  (We all ordered our drinks ""for here."")

Friends know how much i enjoy a chai or dirty chai at any coffee shop. So i decided to give this joint a try! 

Rundown; Came in, asked, ""what kind of chai do you guys use?"" 

Response(friendly tone): ""I don't know. They keep switching it on me. Haha! It's either powder or syrup"" next time if a worker is unsure, its ok to ask and make sure. p&t(please and thanks)

(-_- ) ""ok, can I please have a small dirty chai?"" (cause I was so tired and needing that extra kick, feel me?)

Mmmmmmmm pretty good chai! I know I'd come back for more if I was hanging out again in the village.

Wait, this doesn't taste dirty!? Thinking back at my total(my mistake), I was only charged at an amount of chai price which means no added shot of espresso. Sad. Perhaps she doesn't know what a dirty chai is. Maybe dirty water in a dirty cup?!(hope not)

The inside was spacious as well and equally gorgeous. I have never been to a cafe in Europe, but this felt very much like what I imagine them to be like. The lighting is bright, the colors are sophisticated, and even though the manager that day apologized for the A/C not working properly (it was getting fixed that day) it was still a suprisingly comfortable temperature. 

I got a plain cappuccino which was amazing. I also ordered some sort of open bagel sandwich which was equally good, but i wasn't able to finish it because it was so filling.

Here's why;

hard to find seating because they're so busy. I don't like when you have to have one person find seating while the other stands in line. Reminds me of home town buffet, and man I hated that place in California.

You cant see any menus really posted until you get to the front when your supposed to order and I felt rushed. No child friendly options on the menu, nor did I see a child's menu. A little pricey than I expected based on the fact it's a breakfast/lunch place where there's limited options. No refills on drinks? Never had that experience elsewhere. No bathroom?! Had to leave and walk my daughter to another street to get to one. Very unconventional. 

What I did like was that it was pretty good sized portions. I wouldn't say it was huge. The restaurant is cute and quaint looking. The turkey bacon wrap was good and the honey mustard sauce was delicious. More turkey than I was expecting since most places like to skimp on the meat. It was nice to see them offer cucumber water on the side. My daughter didn't like her waffle because she said it was too hard. But on the other hand she loved that it was served with a side of Nutella and raspberry sauce, which she called jam. 

I think next time I would rather go next door to brio, since in the end it cost the same, I wouldn't have to fight for a seat, have a bathroom and free refills.",WaAOt_eG0_-yLpG3fI--3g,5,5,3,CH0VyVoIqQx_gnOW-xCPmA

Got to Tivoli, first time here. They have valet. I'm already at 5 stars in general. I see intended cafe. Looks awesome. Lots of cool outdoor seating. It feels like Europe.  Still 5 stars. I ordered quiche with a salad. And a granita. The granita tastes amazing. Still 5. I taste the salad. Bottled italian dressing. Really? That's something a 1 star place would do. Quiche is a little too wet and soft inside but tastes good. 3-4 stars. Waitress never comes to get my plate. I have to bring it inside after like 30 mins of it sitting there. I bring it inside and politely ask where it goes. A girl inside smugly says ""usually you just leave it outside but here"" and has me hand it to her. I notice like 5 staff inside doing nothing, just hanging around. Two were folding napkins. Clearly too busy to clear off my table of old plates. That's a 1 star moment to me.

This time I got a palmier. It was huge. Sweet pastry cookie with delicious roasted sugar layers. I loved it.

The staff seemed more efficient than previous visits. The first time I ordered they gave me a number and brought my togo drink to my table.

I liked it all, all was pleasant. There's chicken in their caprese, just a btw. I wasn't too upset, since my diet isn't super restrictive, but I felt a bit inept for not reading the menu thoroughly. The tiramisu was light and filling for what it was worth. I didn't pay for my meal, but I'd like to think it was pretty fair for being a bit boutique-ish cafe.

Service was laid out pretty well. You order at the counter, they deliver to you. We were checked on fairly often and offered refills every time. 

(As for gnats/flies, that's a common issue anywhere that's hot and has access to the outside. Don't like it? I'd advise you to eat at home, or at least let the restaurant remake your meal/drink.)

But I was willing to risk heart palpitations & a sleepless nite.). We got there just before 9p & there was pretty impressive occupancy. While there were patrons inside, the obvious draw was the outdoor seating. & that was precisely OUR plan! In retrospect, I wish I would've gotten the name of the girl who helped us order because she deserved a shout-out. My g.f. got the same iced vanilla latte she would order anywhere while I asked some questions about familiar items. Our order taker patiently & sincerely answered my questions & gave me input. She talked me into trying (what I believe is) their signature drink: a latte (iced, in my case) with cinnamon & honey that she assured me was neither too cinnamon'y nor too honey'y (& told me if I didn't like it, she'd personally buy me a new drink). We then picked a table outside & waited for our drinks. That were delivered to us. In real glasses. By our order taker so she could ensure satisfaction. My latte had great flavor, I'd definitely order it again; however, it really isn't sweet so I'll ask for a tad vanilla. My g.f.'s vanilla latte (which I'm typically not a fan of) was very delicious. The vanilla actually tasted vanilla'y, not like high fructose corn syrup or chemically. & the latte was robust enough to handle that vanilla. I'm no coffee snob but I know this much: we got 5-star service, the outdoor seating was lovely (minus the wretched 'singing' coming from the stage nearby), the drinks were good & the people-watching was great!",hd343st7cOIUSfAd5r0U7A,0,0,4,fjKzxSc30CriR8HQp1t_Fg

The concept for this spot is to order at the register, pay, the cashier gives you a number, and they bring your order to you. This isn't an uncommon practice for restaurants but Leone Cafe makes it so difficult for guests. It's not easy to get from either entrances to the the register, the line is awkwardly formed because people are trying to get out of the waiters way while also looking at the treats, and once you get to the counter the staff is actually quite rude and rush you to decide. I asked what kind of hot teas they had and it was quite comical how annoyed the cashier was to answer my question. After placing my order I made a bee line for a table outside and waited for my items. 

I ordered a chocolate mousse cake and an English Breakfast tea which came in a french press. The cake was very rich and although I enjoyed it, it was entirely too sweet and I could only finish half. The tea, however, was terrible. I don't like giving bad reviews as I know this is people's livelihood but... this tea....tasted like what I suspect the water to taste like after a dog bath.

I originally became addicted to this place due to their coffee.  I am very picky about my coffee  I am not a fan of Starbucks coffee as I feel it lacks a coffee taste and is just overpriced milk.  I've also tried Sambalatte and thought it was okay.  It wasn't as bad as Starbucks, but it wasn't the perfection that Leone Café is. This tastes like a true Italian coffee.  

I usually have the Mocha here.  It is sweet, without being too sweet, and where you still have the rich Italian espresso flavor.  I recently had a friend in town and we needed to kill some time.  I brought him here without saying anything about the place or my opinion of it.  He ordered the white mocha and said it was the best he's ever had!!  As for a sweet treat, please try the cannoli crepe.  It's big enough to share and will have you addicted after the first bite!!

The food portions are very generous here.  My Mom and I wanted a light fare and split the Champagne Chicken Berries Salad.  (I'll include the picture below.  The picture is actually the half order since we split it).  The staff and service here are amazing.  They are so attentive.  I told the cashier we were splitting it and they didn't just bring an empty plate, as most other places do. They perfectly prepared each plate for us.  

If you're in the mood for breakfast, I can't say enough about their dishes.  Each time you try something new, it immediately becomes your favorite.  I LOVE the Mediterranean omelet. It's made with spinach, mushrooms and feta cheese.  It also comes with additional salads (that are soooo good) and an orange juice.  This is the best omelet I've ever had.  It's made to perfection and is so fresh.  

Lastly, (yes, I'm here at least a couple times a week) so I have a lot to say....this place is soooo clean!!  I came in one time right before they were closing.  I took my decaf coffee in a to go cup and sat outside.  I was able to see their cleaning process.  WOW!!  I've never seen such a thorough cleaning.  They moved all the tables and didn't just sweep or mop.  They had a deep cleaning, commercial machine with rotating bristles to clean the floors.  You could tell the crew was used to doing it, as each one knew the area and role they had to complete.  It wasn't just the floors, but I saw them thoroughly clean every nook and cranny.  I was really impressed.  

If you come here on a weekend, know that it'll probably be packed....but it's sooooooo worth it!!",xM4y2agj_lhEpWZUh6cMTQ,0,0,5,4vU7ttueOLh05-ozAARJkA

Oh, and people bring their pets so if you're allergic to dogs...well, now you know!!",K8oMD_meXp4doHyqu2BjOw,0,0,4,kkeXhlyBzmfhjVrh3kxLVQ

Ordered the Chinese Chicken Salad and an Iced Mocha at the counter, then went outside. Didn't have a problem finding a table in the shade. The salad was pretty good and the mocha was tasty! The one thing that stood out for me was that the staff was very friendly, and they all seemed to love dogs. My husky was showered with love and attention from the staff and customers. The staff always flashed him a genuine smile whenever they would pass our table. It's one thing to allow dogs, but to have employees that seem to genuinely like them is another.

Leone Cafe is a nice addition to the Tivoli Village atmosphere.

I really dig the interior with its marble table and countertops, illustrated menus and charming chandeliers. It's a step above your average mom and pop cafe. Complimentary waters are available on one side of the wall and big windows makes the room feel bigger than it actually is.

This cafe is located right in the heart of Tivoli Village and it is actually one of the highlights of this place. The spacing, design, and decor are all great. I would recommend sitting in the patio area that surrounds the outside of the cafe. It offers that charming cafe dining experience. :]

The food wasn't too bad, but there's really nothing fab about it. Nothing struck out to me and there really wasn't anything on the menu that will make me want to keep coming back here (See photos). I did, however, enjoy the chocolate mousse cake. It was light and not overly sweet. But I really only came here for the ambience, sights, and the opportunity to walk the dog in a somewhat shnazzy place that's not a park. lol

Customer service was okay. The one behind the counter didn't seem too friendly and looked slightly irritated. We got here about an hour before closing so I don't know why anyone working would be that annoyed. I know that at the end of the work day you count down the minutes, but when running a business, don't let your customers sense it.

I'm one to support local businesses in hopes that it will still thrive because of the likings of the location. Tivoli Village still has a lot of potential when it comes to opening shops and restaurants. The location is great and it can still expand.

I've been in three times, and each time I've ordered the same drink - chocolatte espressionale. It's hot chocolate with a shot of espresso and it's absolutely delicious - strong and not overly sweet. This morning, I ordered the same drink, and it came out iced. I went up to let them know I was given the wrong beverage, and the barista rudely told me it comes iced, and I needed to specify hot. I take issue with this for several reasons - 1) I've ordered this several times and it's always come hot. 2) If this is accurate, the cashier is responsible for asking me iced or hot - I am an ex-barista, this is a standard. 3) It says HOT chocolate, how does it make any sense for it to come iced by default? I pointed at what I ordered on the menu and repeated it, to make sure we were all on the same page, explained myself again - at this point another person working told me it comes iced. It was a busy morning but they were visibly annoyed, which is not acceptable. 

I knew there was miscommunication but there was no way I could have explained myself again a different way - the baristas were just not listening. I went back to my table, looked at my receipt, and saw that they charged me for a chocolate latte, which costs more  and does come iced. However, if the baristas had listened to me and looked at where I was pointing, this miscommunication would have been instantly understood. But they weren't. At this point I was a little frustrated, I went back up and explained what happened AGAIN (I feel like this is their responsibility) and asked if they would just give me a larger size coffee to make up for the price difference. At this point nobody had apologized, which was annoying. 

Their manager came over, and I explained what happened - since she was listening to me, she instantly knew what I was talking about - the cashier heard my order wrong (understandable) but the baristas didn't listen when I brought it to their attention and tried to tell me I ordered wrong. She apologized for the way it was handled and I let her know it wasn't a big deal, it was just poorly handled when I brought my drink up. She was very nice and got my coffee out to me quickly. 

I know this seems like a such a small thing to complain about, but their customer service needs work (aside from the manager working, who was lovely.)

I even thought about adding more milk to it to dilute it, but alas, no non-fat milk on the counter (only half & half and 2%). It needed more spice, not more sugar/syrup. Next time, I'll ask them to cut back on the sweet. 

The pastries behind the glass display looked delightfully delicious, and I was tempted to try one. Maybe next time.",PspDTd6CrF1aUtdC_k73-w,1,1,3,dxshL4s_x2LmqyCF8oXgeg

It's so cute and a close tie with the neighboring cafe Sambalatte. It is much more roomy than Sambalatte which I enjoy and the ambiance is beautiful .

The servers are extremely nice and welcoming and even attend to you at your table although its pretty much seat your self etc. 

I had a bagel lox and it was delicious, they don't hold back on their portions too so that's a plus. Although the food is a little pricey for a cafe, i don't mind at all since the service and the ambiance is remarkable . 

Its located in tivoli village and when i came there was a farmers market going on lining the streets which gave it a little more uniqueness compared to the rest of Vegas.

There is also something very satisfying about the lack of kitsch decor and pop music.

Expect Korean style coffee preparation though less foamy and not too hot. Cup sizes are correct (meaning a macchiato will be coming in around four ounces) with larger size options available. The drip is automatic sadly, and there could be a bit better consistency with the espresso pulls but the coffee is thankfully not Colorado River. The pastries are serviceable but can get pricey, stick to the layered cakes for best taste-to-value ratio.

Nutella Latte ($4.75 for a large) - I did enjoy this drink, but didn't love it. I did try some of my friends iced chai and it was much better. The latte art was cute and the price was fair. 

Banana Nutella Crepe ($8.50) - I loved the taste of this crepe. There was a fair amount of nutella and bananas inside the crepe as well outside of it. Worth every penny. 

Chocolate Cake ($5.99) - I got chocolate wasted on this one lol. Really good, but also rich. Thankfully this was a shared dessert because I wouldn't have been able to finish it.

I veered in and thought I'd try their lattes, but their hot-chocolate-with-a-shot-of-espresso snagged me instead. I had just stuffed myself with a burger at another restaurant.. but I when I saw the dispay case full of beautiful goodies I *had* to get a bite of something sweet too. Honestly, I felt like a country hick in this pretty place, so I said, ""I'll have that thing with the almonds and the strawberry on top,"" so I could get the hell out of the way. 

The total for my small drink and dessert surprised me: over $12 before a tip! Instead of yelling about highway robbery, I just paid it and hoped my bf didn't hear that I'd just dropped that much on food when I wasn't even the slightest bit hungry. But the guy hands me my cake slab in a tiny To GO box, and it had smooshed the top of my cake! You can smoosh a $4 cake, but this is an $8 cake, and I refuse to eat it smooshed! The guy immediately gave me a new one, in a bigger box, in pristine condition. Bonus points for fixing that without rolling his eyes at me! 

My boyfriend raised the very good questions, ""How is a slice of cake $8??"" and more importantly, ""How can you even be hungry after that lunch you ate?!"" Well, I wasn't hungry, and I didn't know it was going to be expensive, but since I had it I was at least going to make a valiant effort to see what The Eight Dollar Cake tastes like. Just take a bite or two and toss the rest, right? 

WRONG.  Leone Cafe has the best damned cake I've ever tasted.  It was a strawberry shortcake type deal, with almond slivers coating the outside, and a fine layer of dark chocolate on the bottom. The strawberries were not too tart, the cream was not too sweet, the light fluffy cake layers were somehow not soggy, the almonds were toasted exactly right, and the ultra-thing layer of dark chocolate on bottom was just delicate enough to add a hint of flavor without overpowering the whole thing. 

I ate all of it. The entire time I was telling my bf, ""Mmmph! Mmmm, mmbbbllgg!"" (Translation: ""Holy crap, this cake is delicious! You gotta try it! I don't care if you're full! Try a bite! Not this one, this one's my bite."") Seriously, this cake was PERFECTION! If I had to do it over, I'd just skip the burger place for lunch and go straight to the $8 cake slice. And what you should do right now is stop reading this and go get one too. You're welcome.",8GBBchIXlyiarcPilI59pg,0,0,4,OsXFSwlj957ynMEj3vtpTw

I went for breakfast and ordered the House Breakfast, which was great! It's an omelet with turkey bacon, grilled onions, grilled mushrooms, and cheese. It also comes with hash browns and toasted bread.

The staff was very attentive. The waiters checked on us multiple times, but it did take awhile for our food and drinks to come out which was a little frustrating. 

Other than that I highly recommend going here! I went two days in a row because I love the ambiance and location of this restaurant. Parking is a breeze as well. There's an underground parking garage, street parking, and valet. Plenty of options!

It is in a wonderfully situated corner in Tivoli, a charming faux village in Summerlin, right off the Summerlin Parkway and Rampart.  The cafe reminds you of a French bistro or cafe along the Seine.  The busyness is comforting, but not the disorganization, which is plied by the staff. The rudeness of the staff is very French, too! The pastries are nondescript, and the coffee is fine, but nothing to write home about. It would be nice if they had some fine and unusual products like Orangina. I think they might sometimes...then again, maybe not. It's hard to get a straight answer from the bored, contemptuous skinny minis at the cashier.  But it's okay for a morning coffee when you come to the Farmer's Market on a Saturday.

First is their food and drinks. You can go to Leone for a simple cup of coffee, a table full of brunch, great desserts and more. I can tell that the staff take a long time to prepare their food and drinks perfectly. If you are not satisfied with any of them, you can ask for a replacement. They will replace the item without a question.

Their service is amazing too. Leone has been one of my go-to coffee shops for about 3 years, and I haven't had a single bad experience yet. Their entire staff is very friendly. Everyone is there to ensure that you are happy. 

The atmosphere is great. Leone is like a European city within Las Vegas. The interior is very elegant, yet comfortable. I feel like I am in a different city whenever I go to Leone. My only complain is that they do not have enough outlets to plug in chargers; it's more of nitpicking though.

I got the Chicken caparese sandwich with balsamic glaze, the bacon, spinach cheddar quiche and a cup of the Leone Latte Especial. 

Sandwich is grilled panini style with a good crispy in each bite.  Flavors were good, decent and typical of any sandwich.  I got this served with the hash brown.  Potatoes shredded and browned with a tad of salt on top.  

The quiche was a bit too oily for my liking.  Good flavors and the crust edge is crisp and crunchy, just the way I like my quiche.  Filling was what was oily, probably because of the bacon and the fat not being rendered enough.  

The most memorable item for me was the Leone Latte Especial. A cup of espresso with steamed milk, cinnamon and honey.  My first sip, I was surprised how well these flavors worked with each other.  Usually when I drink my lattes, I don't like to stir it because of the fun designs made by the barista, but for this cup I should have because by the end of my drink, it was all honey on the bottom which was also a delicious surprise.  So it's really up to you if you want to stir or not.

I had this bakery bookmarked so I finally was able to come in and try it but the coffee machines had been turned off since they were closing.  

I know I shouldn't dare compare to bakeries in Italy where I spent three months but I have to say I was a little surprised that on my second visit here, the pastry selection is minimal:(  But I guess the star of the show is the coffee and the sweets are just a courtesy.

The coffee selection was impressive, I am dying to try the Nutella cup.

I did manage to grab a Tiramisu to go. It was fluffy, creamy, sweet, light and rich in flavor.  MMMM def. worth a try.

Service was friendly, decor upscale and French including chandeliers.

I've never had anything to bite here, I always get chocolate from Brasado and bring it here but I've had many of their drinks.  This review is for their drinks!  If you're a coffee lover you'll love this place.  

My friends favorite is Shot in the Dark (straight espresso in coffee), espresso, and americano.  I can't drink straight up hardcore coffee like her but when I do order here I like to get the expensive nutella cappuccino or caramel cappuccino.  Mmmm.  

Because there aren't many places to grub around Tivoli I can see why people frequently come by here.  One day I'll try to grab a bite but for now I only use this place to snack and sip on caffeine.",k4M43lXJuQMpQW65DTqzIQ,1,2,3,nqtDZ5LjIJAZvD8WhgS1cg

Parking is a breeze.  If you park underground, the escalator pops you up right in front of Leone's doors.  Service is very nice and attentive.  Prices are reasonable for quality.  Seating is extensive, both inside and out.  

I chose an item from the special board.  The ice blended coffee toffee.  I ordered, sat outside with a few mags, and it was politely delivered to me soon thereafter.  It was served in a large glass.  $4.  Absolutely delicious.  On a previous visit, I've had the joy of the nutella cappucino - also a big winner!!!

I know I say every week that I have a new favorite coffee shop, but this time I really mean it. This place is everything!

It is located in one of my favorite places, (Trivoli Village) if you've never been to this area its a must. It almost feels like you've stepped out of Las Vegas and traveled to a far off little city in Itay. Lights strung up guiding you up the cobblestone paved streets lined with quaint shops and eateries. You would lose track of time if it wasn't for the beautiful bell that rings for the hours.

In this little City within a city lies Leone Cafe. Perfect place to grab a cup of coffee and a quick breakfast to start the day.

Leone Latte Especiale- 5/5 A beautiful combination of rich coffee and delicate sweet honey. Definitely recommend.

Quiche- 5/5 Flakey golden crust, surrounding a fluffy flavorful quiche.

I normally prefer my own home brewed coffee at home (I LOVE my peculator) - unless I'm in Italy or if I'm rushing to work and don't have time to brew my own. 

Nevertheless, this is as close as you can get to good coffee in Las Vegas. And if you like to escape the ugly paper cups they give you at Starbucks, then you will definitely enjoy this place.",akEFRm7rqlxIANKyTlaTOg,3,2,4,IrYkUaDU7RnXsQKSAbOVpQ

4083988,2017-12-06,0,2SfSzEd3B7WimeZac23zhg,"I came here on a very windy Sunday morning with my dad. We were headed for a big day in the great outdoors and wanted some delicious coffee and pastries for the road. 
When we walked up to Leoné we noticed the place had a great area for outdoor seating, but no one was outside, which made us nervous, but we soon discovered it was the wind that drew everyone inside. The place was packed! It had that feel too like it was packed with regulars. 
When we were waiting in line a woman in front of us said, ""what are you ordering, I'm here all the time with my husband and friends, I will tell you if it's good!"" We told her we were just ordering coffees and pastries, she laughed and said, ""oh, I thought you were eating eating... I'm sure those are good too."" 
Positive patron review right out of the gate is a good sign which also encouraged us to grab a thing or two we wouldn't have probably tried without the rave review. 
FOOD: the house coffee was great and not too bitter. I had the almond milk vanilla latte (which kills me when it's too sweet, just a hint of vanilla is perfect), they nailed it. The blueberry muffin was light and fluffy with a slight crips on the top and the almond croissant was excellent! 
We also ordered the watermelon water which tasted like a summer garden (I will be back for that). 
The only reason this isn't 5stars is because I wasn't there to try their actual breakfast dishes which is their main bread and butter from what I can tell... but I would guess it's probably great too.",QsRE2JN6sF9svFNVpfqx9Q,1,1,4,0P-oytlXNCrD1qv5wdmLbQ

It was right upstairs from the parking garage in a cute, European-style cafe. You order your food from the cashiers, and they bring it to you at your table. There is both outside and inside seating. On this cold morning, we opted for inside. The ambiance and aesthetics were great. Loved it, especially since I am NOT a morning person. 

Anyway, so we ordered a few things. 

I ordered the Spaghetti Bolognese, which the cashier recommended. It came with two hefty-sized pesto breads. Those were delicious. The pasta, itself, was lacking some flavor, but it was good overall. The portion was a good amount. 

My boyfriend ordered the Panini Breakfast Muffin. He said it was only okay. It came with a bowl of fruit, which was fresh. 

He also ordered the chocolate cake, which was very good. It was extremely soft and moist. I have to say that this was the best thing that we had! 

I also ordered a orange mimosa. It was a bit sour for my taste, but still good. I don't think I would order it again though. It was $8 for a medium-sized flute. I should have probably opted for the $16 bottomless mimosa option, but I wasn't trying to get too crazy on a Wednesday morning.

The service was good. The staff seemed very friendly and willing to help us with our order. Since we were first-time guests, we had no idea what to try. The menu is pretty extensive, and it definitely all sounded worthy of trying. 

Overall, the food was good. The ambiance was very pleasing. It was a bit on the expensive side for breakfast, and the food wasn't outstanding. But, since it is up the road from my house, I think I will come back.",nrzswAPvMSjecJt8nK_BFQ,0,0,4,DCpf95KadwqaJZfAOGUVvQ

She then asked for my order and all that jazz, I ordered a iced coffee with hazelnut and my nugget got a hot cocoa. We paid and I looked at my receipt only to notice they charge an additional dollar for flavor! No bueno! We got our drinks and went to the play area. 

We sat and my son took a swig and was mortified! He got mad at me and told me the cocoa was really hot! I guess we are used to Starbucks where they do the childrens cocoa at a lower temp... I was kind of annoyed because I'm sure its not that difficult to adjust the temp of a drink : ( I took a drink of my iced coffee and was not satisfied; it had no hazelnut taste!

I noticed they get some pastries from manon, namely the Frazier cake(YUM) We ordered and sat down and waited to be served. Okay so it was night time so no caffeine for me I had an iced chai latte. I know all it is, is milk and flavoring over ice lol but there was barely any flavoring!!!! My mom order a white chocolate mocha with caramel added. It arrived lookin beautiful with a heart design so I could tell she was excited!! Well it tasted like a cappuccino. It would have been fine had she not ordered her specific white chocolate mocha with caramel added! So I being the nice daughter I am brought her drink back to the barista. I explained what my mom had ordered and told her maybe it was the wrong drink. I mean there was no other flavor besides espresso in this beautiful drink. She then took her coffee spoon(the long one used to make the drinks) and stirred it, mind you the drink came with a spoon I already thought of this route!! She said she put alot of whatever so it should be sweet. The barista intimidated me!! I told her I'll go see what mom says and before I completely turned she offered me a side of caramel. It helped fortunately but not enough to say Leone is my home :(  so many things rooted for this place to be amazing but the less then tasty drinks and the scary barista made me run for the hills.

My first time at Leone Cafe was a little strange. For some reason, the place totally smelled like I was in an airplane.

I guess it's a combination, but in any case, I didn't get that feeling on my second visit.

The smell of coffee filled my senses as I paced towards the cafe, carefully savoring every detail of Tivoli Village. You can't go wrong with its exquisite European touch and sophisticated vibe but I can't help but question the quality of their fruit smoothies.

$3.75 (tax included) for a small fruit smoothie isn't bad. Plus, you can add up to 3 flavors (including mango, strawberry, blueberry, banana, pineapple etc.) with either orange juice, apple juice or regular as its base.  I opted for mango-banana with a milk base and despite it sounding really healthy, not to mention, being made at a really classy location, it lacked a certain je ne sais quoi. There was just no wow factor to it. In fact, I believe I tasted way too much banana and almost no mango. My friend had a medium strawberry-banana smoothie and she didn't seem so enthusiastic about it as well. There's hope though because our other galpal couldn't stop raving about their yogurt (with fruits and granola). I don't exactly know how much it was and I tell ya, she had nothing but good things to say about it so you might want to try that out instead.

About Leone Cafe, very friendly staff, huge areas both inside & outside to sit & enjoy your beverage. None of us had any of the wonderful looking desserts or treats, but we all went through a few beverages. The Nutella Cappuccino seemed to big hit with the ladies. I liked The Americano. For the hardcore, Leone Cafe, does not have the best coffee or coffee based beverages in the world, but they do brew a decent cup. I also wish that their proportions were bigger, for the price. The main charm of this clean cafe, is the huge open seating area, where you & your friends can sit, relax, enjoy your refreshments & gab to your hearts content, without other people's conversations interrupting your own groups musings. The staff also, never makes you feel like they need your table for other customers..... no matter how long you stay, even if you don't all order refills.

Me personally I would give this cafe a very ""mature"" atmosphere. A lot of adults, people in suits and ties, and older folk seem to gather here. Unlike other cafes, you don't see many teenagers here. This place is also family orientated which I love.

4702395,2014-02-28,3,2SfSzEd3B7WimeZac23zhg,"I've enjoyed my three visits, however, my last visit in December was pretty terrible.

It feels like a real cafe: inviting furniture, the robust aroma of coffee beans, the wizzing, hissing, and grinding of various cafe machinery. It's a beautiful thing. Really great place to hang out or take a break from shopping.

I'm not a huge coffee drinker, but that doesn't mean I don't enjoy it. I've gotten the Nutella Cappuccino twice and the Pumpkin Spice Latte as well. I love the real mugs and the foam art. Plus, both drinks were tasty. Delicious coffee + cool cafe = wonderful experience.

I was told that Leoné Café served pastries from Patisserie Manon, which came highly recommended, so I was excited to check out their case. I tried the Fraisier (French cake filled with strawberries and crème pâtissière) during my first visit and it was so heavenly! Very delicate cake with delicious cream and strawberries. 

In December, the selection was not as nice. Actually, the quality seemed significantly lower. The ""fresh"" fruit topping the cakes were disgusting. It was obviously old and shouldn't have been in the case nor on sale. The pastries didn't seem to be of the same caliber as Patisserie Manon. Anyway, after terrible communication, obvious lack of focus, and substandard customer service from the 2-3 employees behind the counter, we chose the Chocolate Strawberry Cake and Carrot Cake along with our coffees. Both were dry and just bad.

I'm giving them three stars because as a coffee shop, it's really great. Just avoid the pastries!",TdYKJgSgY2GF_YJnwsi5yQ,5,6,3,1o4dZQszEUtL-w2xR1JaGA

Just discovered recently how great is the cappuccino here. Definitely like hazelnut flavored coffee. 
So, when you decide whether to get only coffee or something else too, Leone Cafe is the perfect place to try. It's located in the beautiful Tivoli Village, West side of Las Vegas.
Besides coffee, there are many different pastries and various entrees to choose from.
After entering into the restaurant, you get in the line to the cashiers, where the drinks and meals can be ordered, and paid for. Afterward, the cashier gives you a number, what you place on your chosen table, where you will be served by waiters or waitresses.
Pretty easy process!
I visited Leone Cafe twice last week, while I was doing business in Tivoli Village.
Both times I ordered Hazelnut Cappuccino (large) and Chocolate Croissant (warmed up), and my friend ordered a Grilled Salmon Salad. 
According to my friend, the salad wasn't too bad, but unfortunately not very good either.
I absolutely loved the cappuccino and the croissant! 
I'm sure I will be back to try other items from the menu! And of course to enjoy the amazing coffee again!",vvxIVr_OR6sHBzGPG9dRXg,5,2,4,6MdVLQP34U8JCyyr5QdQpw

There's seating inside and outside on the shaded patio to enjoy your libations while at Tivoli Village. A nice touch is by the sweeteners and creamers they keep a water vase with ice, cucumbers and lemon. I wonder how long that'll last before they take it away for all the people who will run in for a ""free"" drink and run out. 

They have the usual coffee drinks hot/ice, a bit of tea drinks and smoothies. I was hot and just needed something fresh so I got a basic iced tea (large $3). It was good, but standard tea, no special flavor to it.  

Other than drinks, they have some pastries, pretty desserts, sandwiches, quiches and salad. We saw a sole almond croissant ($4) so we grabbed that as our goal is to try it everywhere in the city. The BFs mom has a obsession to find this particular kind of croissant that doesn't exist but we will try anyways. It was good, but for $4 I wouldn't go for it again as there's a better croissant down the street at Manon. 

The asked for my name and everyone gets Jade wrong as ""Jane"" or ""Jay"" so I always spell it out and as I do it, point to my credit cards name as I'm handing it to them. I was standing there for a while as apparently I am ""Jean/Gene"" and took a while to sort out that was me.  When the girl hands my my tea, she just walks away....where's my croissant? I ask for it so she tells a girl near the desserts to box it up for us to-go. Later they flag me down because she ""couldn't find it"". I pointed at it in the counter and she goes ""oh I thought that was a beignet"". They clearly need to iron out a bit of their service since it's new.

Leone Café was created by coffee lovers for coffee lovers. 
The theme of the shop is based upon a traditional Italian coffee shop concept.

They have the fundamental Italian espresso-based drinks such as the Cappuccino, Breve, Americano, Macciatho etc. along with a new flare on fresh baked goods and specialty homemade breakfasts. 
The Nutella Cappuccino is a must, it combines the sweet, chocolaty taste of our favorite Italian hazelnut spread and the dreamy espresso. 
Lots of stuff to choose from the breakfast menu, they all looked fabulous. 
I chose the Flaming Omelette, it was very light yet rich in flavor, swift, but satisfying.

This is one of the elegant cafes I've been to in the valley, it felt very European with the brightly lit chandeliers and fancy tables. I couldn't help feel sophisticated and blend in within the ambiance that surrounded me, I just love the coffee culture.",bLExVDNKxXMjjZcx3YG36Q,2,4,5,j67A4UUAz6yj9ot2Yk0euA

The scenery is beautiful in the morning and grabbing a light or heavy breakfast/lunch here is exquisite. We've been here for awhile so it's only right to leave an amazing review! They have a pretty good range of drinks, bake goods, and food options. The prices are also reasonable as well. 

The cafe itself gives you a France atmosphere with beautiful scenery of Tivoili Village and it's quite relaxing to watch people walk by. They also allow pets to dine outside as well! There's seatings available inside as well as outside patio. It's a bit different then most cafe because you first wait in line and order then pay for your food then sit down and wait for it with a number. I find it when i come here to be very elegant and fancy with i guess you can say an older mature group of people dining and not many teenagers. It's a great spot for a casual date, meetings, or even studying! (There's free wifi!!)

The staffs here are friendly as well the only complaint i have is that sometimes there's a bunch of dirty tables so finding a spot can be rough sometimes. I love how attentive the staffs were, they checked up on us multiple times and also the owner is a lovely man! I always see him in the morning/afternoon and he's always happy and asking us how we are doing! Everyone is friendly and the food comes out pretty quick too. 

Everything here is so yummy! I've been trying a new dish every time i come here and it never disappoints! I'm really looking forward to trying their juices here next time as well and slowly but surely try all their dishes on the menu!

Favorites: 

Fruit waffles: Blueberry waffles with fresh fruits and nutella. The waffles are pretty big and this is a really filling dish, you'll love this if you like sweets for breakfast!

Champagne chicken berries salad: (MY FAVE) berries, walnuts, greens, blue cheese and chicken. The cheese really brings the entire dish together. All the flavors of the salad complimented each other and it's a bite of heaven every time. Also light but super filling!

Open face breakfast bagel: Cream cheese, eggs, turkey bacon, pico de gallo, spinach, cheese.. etc. This dish is fully loaded and all on top of a toasted bagel! 

Breakfast croissant: tomato, egg, bacon, cheese, and avocado all stuffed in a warm crispy croissant.",sI8d5Usaa_2OzUj6cpvPUQ,3,2,5,puJcCcjHZe58A5EXAwsBpg

They have a great selection of loose leaf teas, including a white and greens, and if you're sipping there, it is served in a tall French press, which means you get enough tea for two for a little over $3.

The coffee and tea is excellent the food is also good the ambiance is good as well it's just very crowded most of the time. They always play great music and it's a great place to go to people watch on the weekends during the farmers market or on holidays when it's cold outside and Tivoli village is decorated.
 I want very much to like this place a lot better and give it more stars.
 Also the chairs are really uncomfortable, and if you're tall expect a couple bruises on your knee from knocking it at the low tables.

3) service is great (you order at counter, pay, and the bring your order to you, and check in to see if you need anything)

Not so pro: 1) I sat on the patio at a corner table and I saw a desert roach crawl near and past my table - I get that these guys hang outside for most part but, it scared the crap out of me.

Let me start by saying I have really enjoyed this place for a long time and I believe I gave it a 5 star review in the past, but the last few months have gone down. I'm not sure if management has changed or what. I ended up getting the chicken guacamole wrap, and it was just awful, the chicken was hard and dried out, the guacamole was like baby food, the mushrooms were very cold like they had just been removed from the fridge and the whole thing was just not appetizing. I have had this wrap before and it was excellent the first time. I also had a side of fruit with my order and the bowl that is was put in was not washed well (this has happened a few times), my fruit was covered in a dish cleanser that I could taste after spitting out my first bite. I have also had many of their salads and again sometimes they are great and other times gross, ex. dried out cold chicken, missing ingredients, just not consistent.  The waiters/waitresses are friendly, but lately they don't come around as much and they don't ask if you'd like a refill on your coffee like they used to. When I go to the counter to ask for a refill to the barista area there's one guy who always has a major attitude to give refills, as if he is paying for the coffee out of his own pocket. It's a bit frustrating when I've spent so much money and tipped so well at this place.

Two faves to eat at Café Leone: 

the Champagne Chicken and Berries Salad,  Filled with fresh grilled chicken, strawberries, blueberries, raspberries and blackberries along with walnuts, bleu cheese and a delish dressing on dark (healthy) field greens.  I never get tired of this.

the roast beef sort of patty melt kind of sandwich.  The beef is so flavorful with their special sauce, carmelized onions, a little horseradish and more.  Love it when I want something hearty and comforting.

Today I had the California club sandwich with chips, fruit cup, lemonade and macaroons. Other visits I have had breakfast items and their ""famous"" Nutella latte. Everything I have had has been bland and over hyped. I asked for no cucumber and an extra side of aioli on my sandwich today and brought it home to hopefully enjoy. Well to my disappointment there was extra cucumber and almost no aioli. I had to put mayo on it so it wasn't horribly dry. There was a lot of meat which was surprising. There was almost no cheese or tomato. The chips were delicious but too thick. 

I moved onto the lemonade and which I was looking forward to because how can you mess up lemonade. Well it was not fresh squeezed or fresh anything. It was clearly some kid of powder and not good at all. The macaroons were the only thing that could have saved my lunch. They looked exactly how macaroons should so I was excited. One bite into it and I was not thrilled. I had lime and raspberry and they both tasted like chemicals. You couldn't tell the two apart! The last time I was here and had the Nutella latte I was disappointed because it didn't taste like anything! Very bland food and artificial tasting drinks and sweets. 

The service wasn't good either. The guy putting the order in was rushing everyone and obviously didn't put the orders in well. Everything took over 15 minutes to come out. I have already given this place too many chances and won't be back again.",GSTf4SKV1HjZBfWFapea0Q,1,0,1,wZM9zFD_QaPWj_0CqinjHA

5414609,2017-01-12,0,2SfSzEd3B7WimeZac23zhg,"I find myself dining here more and more often. Every time the folks visit we always go to Leone Cafe. Mainly because my Dad's wife is a difficult customer and they handle all her 'little' requests with a smile and go above and beyond. Aside from the friendly staff and great manager (owner?) who is always touching the tables, the food is just really good. You order at the counter and they bring the food out to your table. Prices are very reasonable for the portions and there is a large patio which is always busy in the warmer months. Oh and did I mention that it's also super kid friendly. 
I'm a huge fan of their salads, especially the Champagne Chicken Berry Salad and the Chinese Chicken Salad. They are huge and filled with tones of fresh fruit and sliced marinated grilled chicken. They come with 3 slices of toasted baguette too! So yummy. 
The coffees and teas and outstanding and I find their lattes to be far superior to Starbucks, especially the Chai Tea Latte. Yum! And the latte art is on point as well.",l7E5dQmzqg_X_oUI8x_88g,0,0,5,dSE2QZzkOpL8elbK7YPH1g
5430864,2013-07-12,2,2SfSzEd3B7WimeZac23zhg,"Needed to get out of the house after being cooped up inside all day and decided to go get a cocoa and play some scrabble with a friend.  While heading to Sambalatte, I checked yelp and realized that they were only open til 9pm (a mere 15 minutes from when my adventure had started) so I began looking for an alternative location with good reviews.  Behold, Leone Cafe! 4 solid stars and what seemed to be overwhelmingly positive reviews, and it was open until 10pm according to the great yelp, a true find.

But it was too good to be true.  We got there excited to try a new place and were informed that they were closing at 9... Fine, Yelp hours have been wrong before.  Then we ordered.  Per a previous yelpers suggestion I went with a small white hot chocolate, something I get often at Starbucks/Peet's/friggin every coffee shop on the planet.  The bf ordered a large tea because he likes watery leaves, fine, more power to him, give me the sugar.  And on a whim we got a tiramisu at the last minute right before she printed out the receipt.

While one barista made my cocoa, I was asked the following ""are you sure you don't want some chocolate in this, it's weird...""

""no, no, I just want a white hot chocolate"" I replied

After being handed my absurdly small drink I was informed that ""I tried that and it tastes really strange, you are weird."" THANKS barista, not that I needed your super insightful comments into my drink choices, but you are free to have your opinions.  

So we headed outside since they were closing to try and enjoy our snacks. Only to look at the receipt and realize that this 1 inch by 3inch tiramisu cost a whopping $6... I wish I could say that it knocked me off of my feet with its amazing flavors and depth and character.  But it was lukewarm to start (not the best beginning for any dairy based dessert) and with every bite I could just feel my super weird weirdy weirdness weirding the eff out over how angry I was at this place.

So I spent $13 for 16oz of water and a tea bag, a 6 oz cup of weird milk drink that tasted more of a bag of sugar than any kind of white chocolate, and an overpriced tiny tiramisu.  

Next time you need anything coffee or pastry related, go to Sambalatte where they won't insult you or rob you blind.  Get a nutella latte and some fabulous macarons.",vA_fpT2lwj0cSmZmhPQdOQ,1,0,1,ysjCckReADOHHTvS_POrHg

I got the ""white"" hot chocolate, which was very sweet and tasty. A friend raved over her chai latte. They have pastries and sandwiches in a very nice display, and serve hot breakfasts- yum.

Cafe Leone is just the place to do that- when you order coffee at the counter, you can chose ""for here"" option and your beverage gets delivered to your table. Then attentive staff that stands by whisks your empty mug away.

Drinks: By far thee best latte I've ever had. I used to get my lattes at Starbucks but they always make it so milky that I can hardly taste the espresso so I always resorted to an Americano. In Leone, however, their lattes have the perfect amount of milk that it doesn't drown out the espresso at all. Also, they have a wide variety of hot & cold drinks, including a Nutella cappuccino.

While busy, I enjoy that there are fewer people using this place as a mobile office for hours on end while nursing a short coffee like at chain coffee shops.

Cafe Leone offers a great place to sit outside and enjoy a cup of coffee or two. There is free wifi and plenty of room to sit outside. The seating area is mostly covered, so you can stay out of the sun which is nice.  The pastry is also about average as well. 

There's nothing that distinguishes Cafe Leone except the comfortable, ample seating outside and that's enough for me to frequent the place.

Bottom line - coffee is a 2 and atmosphere is a 4. Average 3.",R_uxlSD2MMkNwA8ers0DhQ,1,0,3,d2Kp1I-KRcrf7FW-W2KjXg
5740438,2017-02-24,0,2SfSzEd3B7WimeZac23zhg,"Three items to review:

1) A latte, solid but unspectacular. I'd get it again.
2) A pasta. Not particularly good. Fairly flat in flavor, and chicken looked and tasted as though it came out of a frozen sliced chicken package. Not egregiously expensive but also not something I care to ever have again.
3) Chocolate dome dessert. Too sweet. And too expensive at over $6. Wouldn't order it again.

On the plus side, the folks who work there are all nice and professional. But I don't think it's worth going to for anything other than the coffee beverages.",YE54kKTuqJJPNYWIKIpOEQ,1,1,3,AacOSe5E54Uq9QWMDlUo0w

You don't want to get to the counter and deal with the server who is impatient because you don't know what you want. The girls at the counter were not the most pleasant, although they tried to fake it.
Whenever we are in a line or waiting for a table I use Yelp to bring up the menu(if available). It just makes it easier. 
We did this here so we knew what we wanted, except the online menu and chalk board menu behind the register does not explain the side options. The girl at the register was annoyed that she had to explain the options and then repeat the options(sorry in a crowded dysfunctional layout I can not hear you).  Maybe they should not have a side door that has people waking in font of the line.
The food is good, as are the smoothies. Very good smoothies.
You have to find your own table. This can be a problem. We picked a table and the couple at the table next to it said they had that table also. We thought maybe a big group coming.  We changed tables and after we ate they where eating and the table we wanted was still open. I think they didn't want their view blocked(rude LV people).
The staff that moves around the dinning area are on point.  Very attentive to what you need.
It would be 4 stars if ownership could figure out how to get the flow to move better and monitor the tables. Pretty slow own the busing.",wgUYHGNoo0ulwwZpMox7dg,0,0,3,cA80Xk54mAKoW6bxXSMRag

This place is unlike any other in the Vegas area - so cute and cozy inside, and ""Parisian"" themed, according to my friend. Being from Las Vegas and now living near Seattle, I have come to really appreciate unique cafes, rather than your run of the mill coffee chain. 

I met some friends here late one night (30 minutes before the place closed, no less) and there was still several tables of people sitting around chatting, and the employees were still sweet and pleasant even though we were there so close to closing (we promised to be out of there quick!). Two of us had their hot chocolate (it was late and I didn't want caffeine) which was so rich and delicious, and the third had a Nutella latte, and said it was fabulous. This place is a much cuter alternative for a coffee date than any of the coffee chains that are everywhere in Vegas -  a must try!

How hard is it to toast a bagel without burning it.  But today I had it, My experience with my order was unbelievable my coffee was bitter then normal and the batista, argued with me that he added the correct amount of flavoring. I didnt feel like arguing, but he insisted on remaking my drink. Which was excellent customer service on his behalf. So I had time to wait for two drinks and my bagel still wasnt ready. Which I thought was odd!   When the barista gave me my bagel I inspected it, and it was burnt, and hard.  The waitress asked me if I didnt wanted it well done?  I was thrown off, usually well done bagels are acquired taste. I said I didn't order that, she asked me well how would I like it toasted.... again I was thrown off!  I said regular not burnt!  Not interested in eating a bagel hard as a rock!!!!   This alone pissed me off, I dont plan on coming back, the outcome of my experience,  was unnecessary,  and with the prices they charge you think they would be a little more courtesy.   So I rated this place with a two stars...

I love the outdoor seating area of Leone Cafe...I could sit there for hours, sipping a pot of a tea and writing letters/notecards.  The food on the other hand is pretty standard. Slightly overpriced but good sized portions. Service is efficient and friendly. 

I ordered the Chicken Alfredo Pasta and it was okay. Not bad...at least the pasta itself was cooked appropriately, but it wasn't that flavorful and it was really only saved by the fact that they provided red pepper flakes on the table. Meh, next time, I'll just stick with the tea. And maybe try a pastry because the desserts looked pretty tasty!",cQU8IWVEJYcklBJbW9CzdQ,2,4,3,t0xv5XF0gtckdBfCuWY0tg

What I have had is a lot of other things on the menu. So I'll start off with the good: the food here is all freshly made and you can taste it. It's located in Tivoli village so the view is fantastic. The pastries, if you go in the morning are to die for. The orange juice is top shelf. The bad: the food here isn't anything special. I've had the sandwiches, omelettes and bagels. They're good and if I'm at Leone I'll order them but they're nothing for me to go out of my way. My only major gripe is one that's close to my heart. They don't have regular bacon, only turkey bacon. That's completely unacceptable to me, because while I know turkey bacon is so much better for me, it's not real bacon and I don't play that. Having actual bacon for those who want it would probably met them an extra star because I can't in good conscience go into a restaurant knowing that they serve breakfast food, but no real bacon.
