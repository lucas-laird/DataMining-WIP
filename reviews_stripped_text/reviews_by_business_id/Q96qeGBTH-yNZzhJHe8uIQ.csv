I would not recommend this resturant.",lTqxeNOM6fN_NWBqaXHIqg,1,0,2,CE-q8SzxBDuYB0P2zxRATg

It was quick and when I took it home very delicious. The second time I brought myself and five others. The service is phenomenal and they are extremely hospitable.

The hostess/waitress knew me as soon as I came in and asked how we enjoyed our previous meal. 

After ordering,you get to choose up to 6 cold sides. These include choices like squid, bean sprouts, pickled cabbage, etc. 

If you're not used to some things on the menu, some item (like my noodle dish) come cold so just ask. 

Also, if you enjoy tea, this is one of the few restaurants that serve you whole leaf looseleaf at your table. Me being a tea geek was very lovely. 

Overall I am pleasantly surprised to find this little gem!",91VLvEvCmzGaQsanu1ERBA,1,0,5,CeA7d8RaCNhsZiEHw8AwLA

They get a steady stream of tour bus business, so they don't need to put effort into making decent food. Most Koreans who go to this place hate it. People who like it have no tastebuds. Go get some fast food instead.",4BCl9t23AHL0F4NFDpnAxA,0,0,1,CE3AH9egr1qjF3ZHBg31fw

We entered and were met with a very clean and welcoming environment. We were immediately greeted and seated.

My dad knew what he wanted already and ordered right away. I looked over the menu and decided upon my meal, and ordered when our water was brought out. 

I think they could have waited to start my dad's meal until both of us had ordered, as when they brought it out, parts of the meal were already cold. 

Dad ordered the spicy squid (his go-to meal), I ordered the ribs and seafood pancakes to share. 

For my taste, the squid was not only cold, but also a little undercooked. The pancakes were also undercooked for me, I like them crisp and not so moist. I am a big texture person, and being underdone just made it hard for me to eat it. Flavor was excellent, so we packed them to go and plan to toss them on the stove to reheat them (and cook them a little more). 

The flavor of each dish was wonderful, exactly what I am used to growing up frequenting Korean places, having visited Korea twice, and not to mention having a Korean mother. :) 

The side dishes were excellent as well. They brought oi kimchee (cucumber), regular napa kimchee, bean sprouts (my favorite), pickled radish, spiced fish cake and i think a seaweed based side.

Each of us got our own trays of each side, which was pretty cool. My dad said his bean sprouts tasted dirty, like they hadn't been rinsed enough. I tried his and didn't get the same taste. 

The service here is phenomenal. The ladies were attentive, friendly, and on top of it. We didn't have to wait for food, drink refills, to go boxes (which they packed for us) or the check.

Overall, we really enjoyed this place and both even mentioned we need to bring my mom here when she returns from Korea. 

The prices were pretty standard for Korean food, and on the verge of a little competitive. The kalbi ribs were $15.99, which is a bit cheaper than many other places, but the serving is also a little smaller (but not small enough to complain about). The seafood pancake was $12.99, and the squid I think was about $9.99 or so (I didn't look at that dish closely as i didn't order it).",sDlRFzGHzfpFHaxvJ1JtTg,4,0,5,2UONCRyR7W9W0UOhQB4-Fg
4125497,2011-05-05,0,Q96qeGBTH-yNZzhJHe8uIQ,"We loved this restaurant from about 1996-2006.  Around 2006, they closed their business to the public and only catered to tour buses.  They are now open again to the general public.  We went there for dinner tonight.  The chef/owner and waitress/daughter recognized us immediately!  We ordered the kalbi which was just as great as we had remembered.  The mandoo soup was also excellent.",P6Xt23CAYIUhbcvbMhTzsA,4,3,5,41Q0rWiASMaz8xDl8yv7Yg
5204215,2014-03-17,2,Q96qeGBTH-yNZzhJHe8uIQ,"I have no idea why there are so few reviews for this place. It's awesome! We came to the strip mall to eat at Tokyo Japanese restaurant, but it was closed. So we sauntered over to Lotus of Siam and they had a 2 hour wait. We then decided to see what the wait was like at Komol and it was merely half an hour, but we wanted to eat sooner rather than later. One of the guys in our group saw this place and my girlfriend was like ""What does Yelp say?"" So I looked it up and it was five stars, but only three reviews and the last one from 2012. We decided to try our luck and I have to say it was well worth it!

If you like Korean food you should definitely give this place a try!",5iOHz6pHmXi9SoB5qomRWQ,4,1,5,3Xnp7xVPp4wNbvWBnaUGrA
