Sat at the bar and was very impressed and intrigued by all their mixology tools and bar appliances. The bartenders were nice and engaged in conversation. When I first came in, they kind of had this 'pretentious mixology' look to them, probably the top hats but I stand corrected. 

Their salad, fish tacos, and homemade cookies w jar of milk stood out. Delicious!
Their cocktail menu is also very creative. Had a smoked whiskey skull container. The bar also makes their own syrups, some of them include cola and thyme. Need I saw more? Very, very impressive and creative place.

161548,2013-09-18,4,_hML_SleB40KkUrMHOZ_-Q,"Rx is the recently remodeled upstairs lounge for the old timer RM Seafood just inside Mandalay Place. The place was designed with steampunk in mind, but I think one too many items were value engineered out of the original design because it doesn't quite successfully portray that look in my opinion. There are a few neat elements inside the space, but it's a far cry from what I would envision if I heard someone call it a steampunk themed restaurant. The fake gears, empty beakers and slightly cool light fixtures hardly make it steampunk. The menu features many overpriced small bites as well as full meals, and don't forget to check out their overpriced drink menu on one of their iPads for mostly $14-16 cocktails that are extremely small.

We ordered two Johnny's Big Dry-Aged Burgers, which come with lettuce, house-made pickles, tomato jam and balsamic onions. Up until this point our waitress was fine, but when she asked if we wanted any sides with the two $18 burgers we just ordered, I asked (and assumed) if they came with fries. Her response was, ""it's a burger"" and gave us a very blank stare. Not quite the response I would have given, but ok. So we ordered one side of fries as this meal was already adding up pretty quickly. One of our burgers was ordered medium, and the other medium rare, so when they were brought out and placed in front of us without any noticeable markings we asked the server which was which and were presented with another semi-dickish response: ""I put the right one in the right spot"". Ok whatever. The bun was extremely dry, so dry in fact that we could tell as soon as we picked up our burgers. The tomato jam was non-existent, and the thousand island type sauce added another odd bitterness that wasn't quite great but also not incredibly prominent. I got the perception that the meat was just ok quality, and it could have very well been a premade patty based on its form, but because the patties are apparently made from dry-aged prime as opposed to ground beef, I'm not sure what to think. It was cooked well, close to the medium rare I ordered, but there was a bitter char flavor that was a bit too prominent when tasted on its own. The caramelized onions were a bit too crunchy and not cooked enough either. Overall this was a total fail, forget even comparing it to the one downstairs.

And to top it off, the fries sucked. They were close to those of In-N-Out, but not quite as good. Some were cooked well, but many were very undercooked and soggy. We then found out after we got our bill that these fries cost $9!!!! That is just f$@!ing ridiculous, I'm actually angry that I had to pay that much for fries, even given the larger portion you get.

And speaking of our bill let me jump back a bit. My fiancée liked her burger far less than I did; the overly dry bun caused her to initially remove the top portion and only eat half the bun, but she eventually went to just eating the toppings and patty with a fork and knife. Because of this she was forced to sample the full bitter flavor of the char that was on these patties, and it was too much for her. I didn't notice this flavor as much when it was mixed with my bun and various toppings, although I did catch a few bitter bites towards the end of mine when there wasn't much else left. After much nervous deliberation on her part, I told her to say something to our waitress and get a different meal.  Our waitress asked what was wrong and we explained the bitter char flavor and dry bun. She tried to claim it was because the patty was made with prime and not ground beef, so it had a different flavor we might not be used to. We tried to argue it wasn't that, but maybe an unclean grill or just the method it is cooked with, and she then countered that it could be the tomato jam, and that many people order without. We explained we've had tomato jam before and this certainly wasn't it. Whatever the explanation may be, in this instance the customer is always right, stop arguing weird details, apologize and take a new order.

In the end her burger and replacement salad were both taken care of, along with an additional $4 towards my burger, and the manager came over to assure us that the grill was very clean. Either way this was just way too expensive of a meal for what we got. If nothing was comped for this meal, it would have cost us $75 for two drinks, two burgers and one side of fries; or in other words far too much money for what you get. I don't care if this is a Strip location or not, places starting to charge $5+ to add 50 cents worth of potato to my already overpriced burger is getting absurd, and I will seriously start calling places out for it. Even with one burger removed, our replacement meal not being charged, and an additional $4 off this meal was still $57.29 before tip which is just insane. This burger sucked, this experience sucked, and we paid far too much for it.",0G9BcXSQscv_GnhlNwFfjw,9,2,1,5QvQNHnnqv81w7DxtuzaDg

The waitress tried to sell us 2nd portions of certain items as there were only 3 pieces for our party of 4.  After we ordered, the runner then told us for an upcharge, they would have put a 4th piece on the plate.

The ox tail croquettes were burned, the large lettuce leaves overwhelmed the pitifully small portion of Peking duck, the pot pie  balls were dry... you get the idea.

Thank goodness they gave us cookies at the end for my birthday, otherwise my party would have left hungry.

Ordered cappuccinos and got espressos.  They took them back and simply added foam on top, so we had cold espressos with foam. The food was OK, just not great - with one exception.

Everything was cooked so expertly and the flavors were so well thought out & complimented each other nicely. The staff was extremely friendly & our server was very knowledgeable about the menu. 

Appetizer- 
1. Angry Buffalo Oysters: chilled bleu cheese wafer & celery hearts. 
* These were such an awesome start to the meal. The bleu cheese wafer is made on an anti griddle so it's solid when it's served & melts in your mouth once it hits your tongue. So cool!!! The Buffalo sauce has a nice kick to it so better like spicy!! 

Entree- 
1. Braised Colorado Lamb Shank: Greek- style, toasted orzo, gremolata, ricotta salata & natural jus. 
* GET THIS!!! My mouth still waters when I even think about this dish. The lamb shank is so so tender and full of flavor. The orzo is perfectly cooked and also packed with flavor from the jus. Such a winner right here!
 
Dessert- 
1. Lychee Panna Cotta: a creamy lychee panna cotta with prickly pear purée, fresh kiwis, passionfruit sorbet & locally grown edible flowers.

The food was great, the steam punk setting was fun, but it was the service that really made this place stand out. The two bartenders, I think their names were Corey and Javier, made suggestions for both food and drink, and they were all amazing. We ended up ordering several of the food items off the happy hour menu and we were impressed with all of them. We loved the bacon wrapped bacon and eggs, and the chicken pot pie nuggets were delicious. We started off with martinis but ended up trying the smoked whiskey and cola based on Corey's suggestion. This drink is made in a glass skull with the smoke from wood chips. The presentation was a lot of fun and the drink was very original. We were on our way to a show so we only had time to order happy hour items. Next time we will make the time to get a full meal.

I had the fish of the day (halibut) which was excellent complex layers of flavor. Also ordered the Brussel sprouts (several of us ordered this dish) whoever accepted that produce should have be held accountable for the poor quality of the produce. No amount of cooking could have improved these vegetables (we sent them back) the sprouts were tough and woody.

Everything from the unique design of the restaurant to the attentive staff to the delicious food was excellent.  First, I must thank our terrific waitress, Marcella! She was a big reason why our experience was so fantastic.  She was polite, funny and engaging. She gave us a tour of the restaurant, encouraged us to take as many photos as we wanted and made sure our meal was as memorable as could be.  She never missed a beat and made us feel incredibly welcomed and important as diners.  Job well done.

The food was simply incredible.  We tried the chicken pot pie bites.  The fried fritters contained a thick chicken broth, peas, and seasonings and were out of this world.  We also tried the guacamole and duck fat chips.  I don't normally like guacamole but I found myself going back to it constantly.  For the entrees, my wife had the Peking duck lettuce wraps which contained perfectly cooked duck confit, and I had the basket of fried game hen.  Marcella eased my concerns about trying game hen for the first time and I'm glad she did.  It was delicious.  For dessert, we had the cookies (10 freshly baked cookies!) and milk and the Pie Americana.

He even introduced himself to my new wife when she arrived as 'the cupcake guy'. :)

Because it was our wedding reception Freddie took extra special care of us and had their awesome mixologist (and Bar Manager) Eric Smith (big shoutout as he is AMAZING) concoct two amazing cocktails especially for us! He named them the Time Traveller and the Steampowered Dragon Breath. They were both insanely good cocktails and we absolutely loved them!! (He even wrote down the ingredients for them afterwards for us to take with us). We look forward to returning to sample some more of Eric's work.

Because it was a themed wedding, we and all of our guests were dressed in costume and they had no problem with us taking photos out the front of the restaurant and inside it with our professional photographers. They were very accommodating and lovely and I can't recommend this restaurant and it's staff highly enough!

Freddie made it a fantastic evening, coupled with Eric's amazing cocktails. A BIG thankyou from myself and my wife for such a fantastic evening.",u-t_jHRJnnoIwuV9KXUX9Q,2,1,5,lBSY52uwnR3L_XVo5CLGiA

Service was just insanely slow. They seemed so understaffed, especially for a Saturday night. Everything - from getting drinks, getting food, getting the bill, and even getting the menu! - took forever. I don't think any food (or price) could justify this kind of service.

Food was a miss too. I'm not a price nazi at all. When I go to Vegas I know I am going to spend money and I don't care. But with this place, holy cow! Might be the biggest rip off in the casino. For what you get in taste and in portions, coupled with the service, I don't understand how anyone gets behind this place.

The one silver lining was that they had a really cool bar with truly creative and original concoctions, and had two guys tending it that made it obvious that they lived for good drinks. I didn't like my drink, but I'm blaming that on my own preferences and not the drink quality.",YlWRa8-cf9lDBdcOLbfAFA,1,0,1,LWpehJcn8VdEfrzKgONgoQ

After trying this new restaurant and that new restaurant it is impossible not to notice the similarities and grow a little bored.  So many dishes show up the same on many different menus, so how can we fail to compare?
My friend and I started with the inside out french onion grilled cheese and the chicken pot pie nuggets.  Both were pretty good.  The pot pie nuggets were very similar to the ones served at View Wine Bar.
I was excited to see Niman Ranch skirt steak as an entree.  This is a cut of beef I really enjoy.  I asked what it was served with since there was no further description on the menu.  She said it had micro herbs, so I also got the side of asparagus.
I was disappointed when my steak came drowned in sauce and wish the server had mentioned that.  I like skirt steak because of its flavor and thought they could have used a lighter hand with the sauce or it could have been under the steak.  It wasn't bad, it was just strong and used too judiciously.  
*Pet peeve alert* When servers mess up the food description.  I won't bore you with details, but sorry, I don't think arugula is an herb. Don't BS me.
The biggest disappointment was the dessert, probably the worst I have had in quite a while.  It was called Pie Americana and was pretty much put together as an apple crisp with a puff pastry twist as garnish.  Restaurant Sin: Putting a warm component (apple filling) in a cold dish.  How lazy can you be?  The apples were dry and the puff twist was stale.
I was especially disappointed because I remember having an outstanding dessert at RM Seafood last year and thought the desserts would be done to a similar standard, if more casual.    I mean, apple desserts are not hard to make taste good.  Yikes!
On a plus side, the decor is fantastic and service was very friendly even if there were some bumps with forgotten wine and such.",7HOTOydGS7wJYaJqNoDfeg,2,2,3,clJHFxKDx7kJED_fGu5Q3A

The atmosphere was wonderful, modern but classy with some nice touches such as the candle on the table. (See attached picture). I also loved the disco ball antelope heads in the wall. Made for a fun environment. 

My colleague ordered an iced tea and I had an old fashioned (see picture). Overall, the drinks were good, very large beverage menu to choose from (almost too large). My old fashioned was made with a lemon twist, was missing the cherry, and had wayyyyy too much ice (the small stuff that melts quickly) A little disappointing when pouring a premium bourbon.  

As for the food,  we were impressed here. I started with the pastrami sliders (see attached) and my colleague had the fish tacos in the taro root shells. Both were very good, however, the tacos seemed small on their presentation taco rack (obviously made for much larger tacos). 

My sliders were delicious and the pickles tasted like they were made in house, delicious. 

For our entrees, I had the lamb osso bucco and it was fantastic. I would have liked to have a little more room on the plate to make eating it easier, but the seared orzo and osso bucco was amazing. I would absolutely recommend. Many places over cook this until it is overly falling apart. Here it was done very well. 

My colleague had the barramundi and said it was very good. It looked to have a nice sear on it and he said the flavor was good. It looked a little dry to me, but he said it was good. 

For dessert, we actually skipped this course because they didn't really seem to be too imaginative or creative. 

The service was great. The waiter placed out napkins, the staff were quick with refills, and they did an excellent job of describing the items when dropped. My only suggestion to management is make sure the staff know the alcohols offered or can sell the drinks better than simply dropping the iPad menu. Our server asked if we would like a cocktail and I told her I wanted an old fashioned and she asked me what kind of bourbon I wanted and she couldn't give me a recommendation. 

Overall, I will be coming back. Nice calm, relaxed environment, good food and reasonable prices for the strip. Glad I stumbled upon this place. Would be a great date spot.",_uKYUSKd8pkwWo9rH3MsaA,0,0,4,pLcMIvkSOErzVLWYmR0xSA

The fondue came out first, and I'm not really sure what they gave us, but it had more in common with salt water taffy than melted cheese. Once we let our server know she profusely apologized and took it back to the kitchen. The manager came out and also apologized, and gave us several tasters of beer to try while we waited. The second time the fondue came out it was the proper texture, though honestly still not something to write home about (I believe it was recently taken off the menu in fact). The duck lettuce wraps, however, were far from disappointing. Perfectly cooked duck combined with the crunchy lettuce and orange sauce was an awesome combination.

As others have noted, the space itself is incredible, and well worth spending some time just looking around. There are some articles online that talk about the whole backstory of many of the items you can see and it's fun & interesting to read up before you go. Would have liked to see more victorian and less laboratory, but that's just personal taste. 

Everything here is incredibly artisanal. I'm sure you could get something normal, but why? From the cocktails (Smoked Whiskey & Cola, Jazz Hands, Catch 22), to the appetizers (we started with a mezze platter) to the small plates, everything was incredibly rich, incredibly well presented, incredibly delicious. Although meant for sharing, we each ended up ordering what we wanted, and although it wouldn't be enough for someone really hungry, the shared appetizer + small plate left us all stuffed. 

The service also rates a mention. This place is new, and our server was well-intentioned, but not well-trained. However, the overall service was very good. Attentive enough that they kept the water glasses filled, the drinks replenished and empty dishes removed, but not so attentive that you couldn't hold a conversation without interruption. I'm sure that as they get more experience, it will only get better. 

The one discordant note was the Top 10 music playing...surely there must be better music that could add to the theme experience?

I'm already a fan of Rick Moonen's, RM Seafood and was excited to find he opened a new place right above his signature restaurant!
I am not one to be sidetracked when en route to a night of shopping at Urban Outfitters, but I was lured over by the punk inspired gears on the mechanical archway. My friend is a museum curator and although she is not easily impressed,  she was also drawn in by the modern gothic design. 
Really cool space. 
 After a quick look at the menu we decided to venture in for a closer look. The friendly manager was even kind enough to give us a quick tour. The restaurant's Neo-Victorian theme was the perfect blend of science fiction meets fantasy. Felt like I was in a time machine! The entire staff was all decked out, too. Glad we ended up staying for a quick snack even though we already ate.  
The entire menu was quirky, fun and very innovative. Def lives up to owner Rick Moonen's progressive style. Top Chef worthy creative comfort foods. My friend ordered the Mac and cheese and hasn't stopped raving about it. Another guy at the bar was eating their version of spaghetti-o's made with squid rings!!

In terms of food: We got the chicken pot pie nuggets which were alright, but they were oddly salty on the outside when the salt was needed on the inside. The bacon wrapped bacon and egg was really good and needed to be eaten in one bite to get the best experience of it, but we're slightly too big for that. My osso buco Greek style was AMAZING and just what I wanted. The Mac and cheese was also fantastic and I loved that they had a wheel macaroni which you just never see in restaurants. 

In terms of service: our waiter and some of the other staff were very attentive but a little socially awkward. We were also sitting next to a table that seemed to be ordering like ballers so they were being doted on and it was super obvious that they took precedent.

Rx Boiler Room is the type of place where you tell them what you're looking for and they'll make you something to suit your taste.  I'm indecisive already, but give me carte blanche with the menu and I'm lost.  

At a place like this, I'm looking for something different than you can get elsewhere.  Maybe a new concoction that the bartenders are working on.  Unfortunately, in these cases, I usually just end up with the bartender's ""riff on a manhattan"" or something similar.  Don't get me wrong, I love a good manhattan but I can make one at home.  If I'm going to pay $20 for a drink, I want to try something interesting and different.

I know I'm a pain in the ass but our server didn't treat me like one, he tried his best to get me the unique cocktails I was seeking.  His positive attitude and enthusiasm were awesome and I could tell that he was up for the challenge.  Kudos to the bartender for going outside the box and making some original drinks.  One of them was truly impressive, I really enjoyed it despite normally disliking two of the three ingredients.  It was not something I would have chosen but it was very good.  It was exactly the kind of surprise I was looking for.

For food, we decided to share some apps and the cheese platter.  The appetizer portions were huge, big enough to share and/or have as a meal.  As for the cheese, I think there was about 6 oz of cheese total, about 2 oz for each one.  It was amazing.

Food was mediocre & ""nothing to write home about"" as stated by some of my party & the rest agreed. Our bill was screwed up at the end as well & rather than trying to get a bartender's attention we let it be as it wasn't too much money (under $5.)

This is an interesting, funky, steampunk restaurant by celebrity chef Rick Moonen. It is quite different that what I would have expected, especially at Mandalay Bay.

Happy hour is from 5-7PM daily. Their specials include select cocktails, wines, and appetizers.

Drinks are well made and they are served with a complimentary bowl of tortilla chips and salsa. 

The CHICKEN POT PIE NUGGETS are delicious, but skip the tiny, lackluster portion of ""DEVILS ON HORSEBACK"" (bacon wrapped dates). The NEW BEDFORD JUMBO SCALLOPS on the regular menu are some of the best ones I've had - perfectly cooked with a nice smoky flavor.

What I was most impressed with was the fantastic service offered by the bartenders. They are knowledgeable, warm, and know their craft well.

Moreover, service - is SLOW!! Don't come on an empty stomach because you'll be waiting..and waiting..and waiting for your meal.

Once it finally did arrive, I was disappointed. Pan fried chicken - tasted like burnt chicken and the portions are small. The lobster ravioli,( maybe Joey's has corrupted me with their STUFFED raviolis and amazing Alfredo sauce) was a major disappointment especially for the cost. The raviolis are small and stuff with IDK what! I say this because the so called lobster are small lobster pieces floating around the plate. The whole thing, is smothered in a Spicy Marinara sauce!! Totally ruined the plate.

In conclusion, take your money elsewhere.

Best Brussels sprouts I've ever had! Bacon wrapped, blue cheese dates were little savory delights!), but woefully awful service! Food that is this tasty deserves much better service; I feel so badly for the chef. Such a shame and disappointment! 

When a table of eight executives have a reservation at what is supposed to be a top restaurant, and are expecting to drop thousands on dinner and drinks, good service and a comfortable atmosphere are expected. 

What we received was terrible ambience; an 85° sweat box in a room so dark we needed our phone flashlights to read the menus, and very uncomfortable chairs. After asking for the air conditioner to be turned on, they set up a Dyson fan about 20 ft away that did little more than a child blowing air bursts in your face every 15 seconds. We were all sweating and yearning for more than a puff of warm air in every oscillation. 

Couple that with extremely poor service; a scatter-brained waitress incapable of remembering more than two things at once, and lag times between seeing said waitress of 30+ minutes, resulting in few people at the table receiving more than two drinks in over a three hour period. Not to mention, other wait staff rushing by our table and bumping the back of our chairs incessantly (major fine dining pet peeve of mine and a reason I usually ask to not be seated in the center of the room); and I was seated against a wall! I was also served my meal without utensils and had to wait 10 minutes after asking three times for a set, just so that I could eat. Most of us also had empty glasses the entire time, and the food came out only luke-warm in some cases.

Between being uncomfortably hot and highly under-serviced, we got out of there as quickly as the poor service would allow. We were looking for a quality place for serious relaxation and amazing foodie-level adventures, but we wound up with amazing food that was difficult to enjoy at the level it deserved because all else was severely lacking. We walked out having spent only one-third what we anticipated spending that night in RX Boiler Room! Bad service cost this restaurant more than they realize. In Vegas, especially at a nice hotel like Mandalay, this should be unacceptable. However, they literally lived up to their name - it felt like eating in an actual boiler room.

Five star food. One star service. Zero star ambience. Still shaking my head.

Note to chef: You may want to find a new gig where your excellent preparations are not over-shadowed by factors out of your control; you're too good at what you do.",KLX6I1nObmgkex8pbVMhEQ,12,10,3,dgmtyAXZV-uMnwRRqwPhUw

We arrived to a food display that wowed our prospects, and then proceeded to have passed hors d'oeuvres flow around the room for about 2 hours.

As a host, they helped me maximize our billing so none of our guarantee went to waste, and (since I was stuck at the front welcoming people) made sure I got some hors d'oeuvres to keep me from going hungry and delivered drinks through the night to keep me going.

We went on Friday night after looking for a place that could accommodate our large group of 16 and we were told it would be no problem as it was late in the evening and the place was empty except for two other tables.  The hostess was very attentive in getting two tables set up for our group and upon being seated we were greeted by a waitress that gave us a run down on the menu and drink selections.  We asked to have separate checks and were met with a roll of the eyes, but were told that this would be fine.  We proceeded to order drinks, then were asked for our starter order, followed by the dinner order.  Most of us were ordering just one item as our meal and then the wait began.  

It took 45 minutes to bring us our drinks and they arrived at the same time as the starter items, but we quickly realized that the starter items and other dinner items were arriving at the same time.  There were four guests in total that were left with nothing in front of them for dinner and when I asked the waitress if she could check on the last four items I was told, ""Let me explain to you how this works, the food on the table was starter selections and the food you are asking about is the dinner selection so that's why it's not here and will come out later."" I was left almost speechless by the rude and condescending response and had to point out to her that she had brought dinner items out to the people who told her they were eating starter items as their meal.  In a huff, I was told it would be out shortly and when I asked for a refill on water for table, I was met with a ""No, you can't have refills"" and laughter as the waitress walked away.   About 10 minutes later, we finally received three of the four missing dinner items and she had to admit that she didn't put in the order for the fourth item so we had one guest that was left waiting until most of the party was done eating before she received the salad she had ordered.
   
Now, I understand that Vegas can be busy and I understand that a large party can be more work or take a little longer, but when the restaurant is empty except for our party and two tables with two people I would not expect it to be too difficult to manage the service expectations.   

After receiving the last of the food and waiting for 15 minutes for the waitress to come back, we had to ask a different server to check on our bills.   We received the bills from a different server and found she had put the wrong orders on two of tabs, when asked to correct this our waitress came back and told us we were a handful and that the bills were what they were.
   
We all paid our bills which included the automatic 18% gratuity that we had expected to pay and felt that the service was so horrendous that the waitress should have received nothing except some lessons on food service manners.
   
As Vegas is a city that employees mostly individuals working for tips, I would hope that the restaurant would take a look at the people that work for them, as those individuals are a reflection on the business and the food was actually wonderful and I would have liked to rated them higher.  Based on our experience, I believe we figured out the reason why the restaurant was empty on a Friday night.",mLvG6Vbu5unMMwQoOpLinA,0,0,1,5AlRrYZbcPwFz1t7x82mIg

When our wait staff wasn't MIA, they inattentively placed plates and left the numerous empty glasses and dirty plates on the table. When the wait staff spilled half a glass of water (3 spills total) on my friend's plate, my friend cleaned it up with a napkin that was never replaced.

No music in the side room to top off the awkwardness.

After our meal was finished and $68 was automatically included for the shittiest service (New Yorkers and LA folks in the group) we approached the manager who was entirely dismissive and could not care less. But then again didn't seem to be a stranger to complaints.

Although our server was decently friendly and attentive, the food was somewhat of a letdown.

I decided to order the scallops along with a glass of Riesling. The Riesling was far too sweet and absolutely terrible - I felt too bad to actually send it back but had the server offered a small taste before pouring the whole glass, it would have definitely been rejected in lieu of another wine. The scallops were also disappointing; although seared well, they arrived at the table only lukewarm, and the overall flavour profile of the dish just didn't really work for me. As a main course, the dish was also rather small and could definitely have used something starchy like a small accompanying risotto. 

That being said, the service was decent and the interior has an interesting Victorian apothecary-esque theme. The drink menu is also on an iPad, which while cool, was actually a tad cumbersome, especially since the comparison and suggested pairing features weren't working too well.",ABm3ocOu7J6XzB9cYYUViQ,0,0,2,jlqS8c9Ma9RCIFKbUTS-LQ

The bartenders are top notch.  Friendly, knowledgeable, constantly experimenting to bring the best mixes, they obviously love their job.  I've tried a number of their experiments as well as the special cocktails off the menu and they've all been good.

Really I only have two complaints.  The southern friend game hen is now off the menu and the recipe for the Chicken Pot Pie bites keeps changing.  The first time I went over a year ago they were really good, the next time a few months later, not so much.  Still good, but not as good as they had been.

Located above the good ol RM Seafood (Mandalay Bay...would it hurt to put up some damn signs?) And i've waited way too long to write this review so lets just get to the food.

- Bucket of Crispy Fried Game Hen with Bleu Cheese Dip, Buffalo Sauce
The Buffalo sauce is damn good, the game hens themselves were crisp on the outside and juicy on the inside. Nice meaty pieces considering they're game hens and all. Also served with shaves of carrots and celery which is a nice touch in both presentation and...yeah i ate them too.

- Jumbo Asparagus Officinalis with Soft Cooked Desert Bloom Egg & Truffle Salt
So this is a side item but it's actually pretty damn amazing. The truffle salt was light, a bit too light for my tasting and the truffle was a bit underwhelming. The asparagus sure was jumbo and the serving size quite nicely. The soft cooked desert bloom egg is just that, the soft cooked (boiled? poached?) egg yolk that offers up it's rich fatty goodness to what ever you dip it in.

- Johnny's Big Dry-Aged Burger with Truffle Cheese, Lettuce, House-made Pickles & Tomato Jam Balsamic Onions
First of all i had this with the Truffle Cheese which gave the burger an AMAZING flavor. Secondly, i dont really like burgers much because they're pretty much a dime a dozen but it's difficult as hell to find a good burger let alone a GREAT burger. Last, for 18 dollars is this burger worth it...the answer is yes Yes OH GOD YES. I'd one of these every meal of the day if possible.

- Rx Guacamole with Duck Fat Chips
The guac is...pretty standard. The Duck Fat Chips...oh god if it wasnt so unhealthy i'd eat them along with Johnny's burger.

- Braised Oxtail Croquettes Dijonnaise with Lemon Aioli 
Mixed feelings about these croquettes. They are very tasty and have a lovely crunchy outside to gooey inside ratio but the individual pieces are so small it's hard to taste everything in just one bite. Well it was for me as everything described is being shared with others

- Moon N Doggies - Two Shrimp Corn Dogs, Cilantro Aioli & Asian Slaw
Didnt get a chance to taste the slaw but the moon doggies were quite nice. The shrimp wasnt too mushy from being ground up and still had some good texture. The cornbread batter was nice and light resulting in a crispy shell.

- Flight of Onion Rings - Smoked Ranch & BBQ Sauce 
this ""flight"" is actually very nicely served on a wire rack model of an airplane with the sauces tucked in the wings. quite an adorable presentation. Rings were good too.

- Lamb Osso Bucco Greek Style with Toasted Orzo, Germolata and Ricotta Salata Cheese 
Lamb wasnt as gamey as i was expecting but still quite tasty. Couldnt really taste the toastyness of the orzo but it went well with the greek style sauce. Not all the bones had marrow but of the ones that did....nice VERY nice

This is a solid 3.5 spot IMHO. 

Five stars for service. The team was ON POINT. High fives and tips for the bar staff, who made sure water glasses were stealthily filled and all questions were answered. 

Four stars for food. We hit happy hour and there are some deals to be had. Oysters at $2 ea and the Moon Doggie (seafood hot dog in a nice brioche bun with great toppings) were both solid. Didn't love the buffalo oysters, and wish we'd ordered the chicken pot pie nuggets and the house guac with big ass chips! 

Three stars for drinks. I ordered a rye old fashioned (Rittenhouse is the well and my preference) and found that they don't default to serving this drink over a solid cube of ice. It is an option (hand cut and formed in one of those expensive Japanese molds at $3 extra!), but they didn't build the cocktail over this, so it was over diluted. In today's world, a bar with a cocktail program really needs to step it up and offer the right ice and make drinks properly if they want to command the $15-$18 price point.

I recently went there with my girlfriend and some friends, and we were definitely impressed with the outstanding food, excellent service, and of course, the cool decor. Time travelers would feel at home here.

Even before entering this stylish restaurant, the retro-futuristic theme was evident. There's a really cool sculpture that stretches up the sides and over the top of the entrance. It's made of repurposed items like gears, tools, sewing machines, and old-school motorcycle seat pans. Inside Rx Boiler Room are many cool decorations including a plush Victorian room, a sweet Octopus wearing a metal helmet, and an apothacary wall filled with various vials of colored liquids. It was odd that we were the only patrons dressed in Steampunk finery, but we got lots of compliments from the staff as well as a 10% discount for dressing Steampunk.

Our server was fantastic! Not only was he knowledgeable, but he also made us feel right at home and attended to our every need. Every suggestion he made, from tasty drinks to delicious dishes, was a hit. I started with the Pizzazzerac coctail with absinthe, bourbon, and Grand Marnier (it was delicious) and my girlfriend had the Gibroni-Negroni, which was also very good.

We began our culinary tour with the Bacon-Wrapped Bacon-n-Egg. It's a delicious amuse-bouche that has bacon-wrapped pork belly and a quail egg on brioche toast. My girlfriend and I shared the Citrus-Braised Veal Cheeks for our entree, which was incredibly tender and extremely decadent! Our friends had the Lamb Osso Bucco and the Pan-Fried Game Hen and Waffles. The Osso Bucco was also tender and delicious, but the Game Hen and Waffles was my favorite entree! Instead of deep fried chicken, it features grilled chicken and perfectly cooked waffles with a citrus maple sauce that adds complexity and great flavor! We ended the meal with a deconstructed apple pie a la mode. I loved it because unlike most apple pies, it doesn't have large chunks of apples and there was plenty of crust and cinnamon crumble.

Walked up, received a greeting with a smile, got seated right away. Decor and vibe in the restaurant was interesting, I would describe it as a cross between a more modern Ivy League library, meets rock & roll ultra lounge with a little bit of House of Blues mixed. Our server was very knowledgeable about the food and drinks on the menu and she had an upbeat stylish Goth vibe going on, she did a great job. Food presentation was very good and everything tasted really good. Even the Bus Person was right on top of making sure that water was topped off and tableware cleared at the right times.

Loved the Mario went down the wrong pipe, whiskey coke and they had some cocktail with coffee ice cubes.  Went there with 7-8 people and everyone loved their drinks as well.

My husband and I made this our first dinner in Vegas when I met up with him during the Vegas leg of his tour, so naturally, the expectations were pretty high. 

Checking in and seating were easy and I was very impressed with the look and attitude the restaurant conveyed. Love the tone and decor ! Very steam punk, victorian, industrial. 

Service was unfortunately, very lackluster to say the least and I'll go into that later. 

We ordered the chicken pot pie nuggets, duck confit poutine, rib eye, coffee rubbed flat iron steak.  Everything we had, with exception to the coffee rubbed steak which was just OK, slightly better than average but nothing that would beckon  a return.

I ordered a cocktail that wasn't too great but that was my improper choice. My hubby got himself a soda and a water. Not once did anyone come to offer a refill of either. He emptied both early on and  multiple people came back to us several times but nope, not one refill of either of his drinks. He had to drink mine! 

It wasn't a huge ordeal but enough to be noticed from a $$$ establishment.

Our server, Tyler, was very knowledgeable and made great recommendations--and he also seemed to really enjoy his job, which is always a bonus. The table side-mixed cocktails were delicious, and we adored our personal bartender, but of course I've forgotten her name. You simply must try the ""bacon fried bacon"" appetizer, even if, like me, that didn't sound appealing at all to you. It is not the greasy salty mess you might expect. It is just a mouthful of wonderful. We enjoyed the cocktails (The Fleur de lis was our favorite) and the appetizers a little more than the entrees, but that is probably due mostly to the fun factor. The crab-stuffed chicken special was presented beautifully but let's face it... it was still chicken. It was our least favorite. The buffalo burger is full of flavor and big enough to share; the tater tots are just too sinful for words. And I am not a tater tot fan. That's how much I trusted Tyler. 

Keep this in mind as an option if you're going to a show over at the MGM Grand Garden. Instead of dealing with the mess of the MGM, we parked at Mandalay and had our pre-show ""party"" here, then headed over for the concert. It's a quick cab ride if you're really in a rush (which we were), or an easy walk--especially if you utilize the tram from MB to Excaliber, then cross over.",bJE0sN7zwzi1q1QoVru6ZA,2,1,5,vUvjgySkC3-f7A9TJhfaOA

We all shared the bacon wrapped eggs which many reviewers suggested and did not disappoint. Delicate and bold in flavor at the same time, it was a wonderful way to start our meal. 

I had a delicious meal of game hen and waffles served in a citrus maple syrup.

The duck poutine with a quail egg was straight up awesome, I mean some really distinct flavors going on with this dish.  The cheese curds were more like a tater tot with cheese in the middle and they were a nice alternative to fries or curds.  I'm not usually a big duck fan, but this was prepared right and with the quail egg and that au jus type sauce they have mixed in it was a really impressive start to the meal.  Everything worked together and was made perfectly.  I had the lamb shank for my entree and it was also VERY good! Literally fall off the bone, which lamb should definitely be and a huge portion to boot.  Items are marked as a la carte, but think twice, mine came with rice and given the size as well as an appetizer, a side would have been too much.

I opted for an off the menu drink, I was feeling something hot... I asked for a bourbon with some kind of jalapeno or habanero bitters and the bar tender dealt me a solid drink.  I can say it was a little weak with the bourbon, good but could have used a little more kick.

I cant quite remember which four meats were included but they were all yummy, especially the ham-melted in my mouth!  A small jar of pickled veggies was included and i enjoyed them as well.

   For main course, our two children (ages 8 and 2) each got the macaroni and cheese.  The mac and cheese was not neccessarily kid friendly (meaning it didnt come from a blue box) but it was tasty, made with a combo of cheeses and served in a little crock.  My girlfriend and her father ordered the sturgeon and i have to admit i was a little jealous when it arrived at the table-the presentation was beautiful.  I did not taste but am told that it was really good and my daughter made a few bites of it disappear so fast we were looking around thinking she had dropped it.  My gf's brother had some lobster bolognese (cant remember the name, sorry!) which looked good but i did not taste.  His wife ordered the skirt steak- YUM.  Very tasty, fairly large portion, good choice.  She did remark that it was odd no starch was included on the plate but i dont think a lack of potatos is a deal breaker.  And finally, i ordered the shrimp and grits.  My original thought was to order the squid-e-o's but i chose this dish in case my daughter wasnt happy with her food as she loves shrimp. I wish i had stayed with my first choice.  Not because the food wasnt good, i had never really had grits before and they were tasty. And shrimp is shrimp, hard to mess it up.  In fact, my food was very good, BUT i can not stop thinking about ""what could have been"". Sounds silly, but i really was looking forward to trying the squid-e-o's, so much so that we may have to make a special trip just to try it.

We ordered drinks, our waiter took that order and spent another 20 minutes trying to get them to our table. (The bar was empty, why the lag here folks?) Then one of us ordered a very expensive bottle of wine, so the waiter went to go ""find"" it. That took almost 30 minutes. There we sat waiting for one bottle of wine. They ended up not having it, so the manager gave us two free bottles. Nice right? 

Food: Pretty dang good. I would've give the food alone 5 stars because it was very good. Nothing was overcooked or undercooked or took too long, but the waiter took a long time to bring it out to us. I am not sure if it was his first day or what. I asked the manager since there was 10 of us, if could we get another waiter or perhaps a 2nd one? He said he would take care of it, but really...nothing improved. That part kind of sucked. The manager was very nice though...

Lastly, remember that very expensive bottle of wine we ordered and didn't get? Yep, they charged us for it. $125 for something we never got. Nice right?

The manager took that off and we were on our way.

She came more to the table to talk about how she could split the check up than she actually did checking on our drinks or food.  Apparently they have an ""old computer"" (her words) and it makes it difficult for them to split checks. Even after we asked her to do what's easiest for her, and she suggested that we just tell her how much to put on what card, she was still stressed out about it.  I think the irony of this is that their drink menu is on an iPad. Why don't you fix the computer that you actually need rather than some drink menu that really can just be on paper. Pretty ridiculous to me. 

Not only was the service bad but the food was mediocre. I got the chicken pot pie nuggets and they were really good.

I came here this past weekend with my girlfriend to try something new. We were enticed by the pictures on Yelp. We were not disappointed.

The only thing that we didn't really like about the place was the table and chair setup inside. Some tables had a mix of  awesome and comfy chairs with a mix of small ugly cheap ones. It looks like they ran out of money on chairs and just threw those in there. The other thing they could improve on is table placement. There was one table right next to the kitchen. Where employees were constantly coming and going. I think if this place had booths and separation from the other tables, the vibe and ambiance would have been cooler. 

The food! This is where this place shines!

We ordered:

Bacon/egg bites - So good!

Stuffed Dates - Amazing!

Beet salad (Special of the night) - Awesome! They should keep it on the menu

Meat and Cheese Board (we got two goat cheeses and a Brie) - they did this so perfect! I loved how on the cheese board they offered nuts, grapes, berries, apples, honey, and jam! Best meat and cheese board I've had in a long time!! They should add more flavored jams! Amazing!

Grandma's meatball - I can't believe how good this was! This was one of the best meatballs and sauce I've ever had at a restaurant. And it's not even an Italian restaurant! I'm obsessed with how good this was.

Lamb Shank - fall off the bone. So good!

Scallops - amazing sauce! Cooked perfectly

Lobster Ravioli - Good, just not my favorite. Tons of meat which was great - the sauce was spicy. I think they were going for a lobster Fra Diablo. I appreciate the attempt, just not a fan of the sauce. 

Tiramisu - Really good

Coke-a-Cola cake - wow, great flavor! I was pleasantly surprised by this.


Drinks were very over priced. Caution.

2499401,2013-08-13,0,_hML_SleB40KkUrMHOZ_-Q,"I am STUNNED by the high rating of this place. My friends and I came here for a late dinner on Friday night. We were seated after about 10 min. We had a large group of about 12 people. The restaurant was pretty empty. We got a really big table. The dining room looked really neat. Our waitress greeted us nicely. She showed us how to use the drink menu.  They had a really cool selection of drinks. They were innovative but pricey. I got the rum cocktail (forgot the name); it was really good. The drink was strong but the flavor was really great.

We ordered quite a few things from the menu. The food took forever. They messed up on 1/4th of our orders. It was just one HOT MESS. The food was not worth the wait. By the time our food came, everyone was in a bad mood. The food was not awful but not great either. The kitchen needs to pay a little more attention to what they're doing. It made no sense to us why they were messing up so badly on a slow day. Leaving bits of  duck bone in the duck lettuce wraps is a big no-no. The experience left us with very little to smile about. 

The only dish that I was really impressed with was the green tea panna cotta. It was such a great refreshing dessert. I loved the textures of the toppings, and the li hing mui worked so well with the matcha flavors. This is probably the only thing I'd recommend at the RX boiler room. 

It really sucked that we had to pay a huge gratuity bc of the size of the party. The service just turned awful by the end of our night. We were clearly frustrated, and the staff didn't handle this frustration very well. They looked just as pissed off at us as we were at them. They offered nothing to appease us. Instead, some of my very frustrated friends had to ask them if they were going to do anything about what happened. They brought out like half a dozen of small cookies, but it just felt really forced and a little too late. Everyone in our party left in a foul mood that night. It really put a damper on the start of our Vegas trip.

Definitely not coming back here. There is no shortage of amazing food in Vegas. RX Boiler Room needs to step it up or else they'll be off the strip in no time.",WA6BO2vP9eWjcfWRDEPZGA,8,0,1,nV2SK07qu6KHJCMk_Zqf1Q

I got the milk and cookies which are served up fresh and hot on a slate with a little carafe of milk.  Adorable.

Rx Boiler Room catches and keeps your interest from the aesthetically pleasing decor to the last lick of your dessert spoon (because trust me, you will stay for dessert- and this is coming from someone who never gets dinner, drinks and dessert all at the same place.)

SERVICE: 

-I wouldn't have had this unforgettable experience if it weren't for ANDREW. Seriously, I'm not kidding, best customer service I received in my life. Welcoming, patient and attentive, this man also has a palate for delicious food. Everything he recommended,  my friend and I devoured (in hopefully the most ladylike way possible.)
-There are several people who always checked on us to see if we were okay without making us feel rushed or stuffy.
-My glass of water was ALWAYS full no matter how much I drank. They're ninjas; they manage to fill it up without me looking. 
-Everything was paced well from seating to serving. Timing is everything. Rx Boiler Room has timing. Therefore, Rx Boiler Room is everything.  

FOOD:
Everything ranges from savory to sweet with a hint of spice. Literally, I have never tasted anything of such a combination of flavors. Other restaurants are ""too little"" or ""too much"" of something. Rx Boiler Room is on point. Purely delectable.

-Rx Fish Tacos in Taro Root Shells
(Crunchy taro root tacos filled with a fresh ceviche-like stuffing with a slight grapefruit sweetness.)
-Peking Duck Lettuce Wraps
(Warm and juicy, this duck is the best I've had. The lettuce gives a nice coolness to it and the plum sauce sweetens it just a tad.)
-Mahalo Matcha Panna Cotta 
(A delicious fusion of Hawaiian, Japanese, Spanish, and Italian flavors, this dessert is absolutely divine. Consists of a sorbet, cookie and flan... just eat it. It's not as crazy sweet as it sounds but it keeps you coming back for more.)

DRINKS:
-Luna Rossa
My favorite drink in Vegas. Just. Drink. It.

INTERIOR:
-Clean
-Inviting and warm ambience 
-Fun, quirky, yet, classy steam punk theme

I usually never eat at the strip ever but Rx Boiler Room is an exception because of their great food, atmosphere, service, and unique takes on classic dishes. If you're a steampunker like me then this restaurant is the best place in the world you could eat because everything from the decor to the food to the shows on tv are all steampunk oriented. Even the waiters and waitresses are all decked out in steampunk garb. The food while pricey is always cooked to perfection and is also 100% the best quality every single time I eat here. The drinks are to die for though they are quite expensive so I would be prepared before ordering a cocktail. 

   Now I know what you're wondering, why the 4 star rating and not 5? Well i'm going to tell you, so I came here a few nights ago to celebrate an accomplishment I had made in my college class. I wanted a nice cocktail and to just sit down and relax. The bar was totally empty except for 2 people. After sitting down at the bar for a good 10 minutes I was greeted by an extremely rude bartender who seemed more interested in being snarky and rude than she did in taking my order. I had realized that I left my phone in my car so I ran downstairs to go get it really fast and returned to order my drink. I had been no more than 5 minutes when the bartender handed me my menu. She looked at me and said in the rudest snarkiest manner ""Are you going to drink now or what? You ready?!?"". I was taken aback by the comment and for a second thought she was kidding until she kept repeatedly  giving me the stink face. I finally just settled with a Rum and Coke and let it go and chocked it up to it being late and resolved to enjoy my drink. I sat there for a good 7-8 minutes again waiting for her to make my drink but she went back to talking to the other two people who were sitting at the bar like I was invisible. Finally she made my drink halfheartedly and I drank it and left. The drink was fine and it doesn't ruin my experience because this is a great place with amazing people but the bartender was just rude. This was the only bad experience i've ever had at this place and I come here very often.

The drinks: fun as hell. Professor Fockblocker killed it and it was GREY in color. Like 50 shades of delicious. The fruity drink for 2 done table side was delicious even if wife did squirm when bartender said ""egg whites"".

The food: we ordered so much and couldn't finish it. That never happens with us, maybe we tried to be less piggy in front of guests.

Chicken pot pie nuggets: fried. Hot. Creamy. Gravy. How could it be bad?
Cheese platter: 5 mounds of cheese. All perfect. Honey a great accompaniment.
Brussels sprouts: shredded and roasted with lots of nuts. Came so late in meal that we didn't really eat them.
Mac and cheese: made with wagon wheels macaroni jalapeños and bacon that is always a perfect combination. 
duck cold feet poutine (hahaha auto correct: Duck Confit): duck gravy lots of duck meat placed on pillowy delicious tater tots and dabbled with salty cheese curds. I chose to eat most of this and give up other choices. I will come here every time for this while wife is at Paul Mitchell.
Cookies: these were no longer on the menu but my wife asked for them and they made them. They came in the middle of the meal and they were gone before we even finished our entrées.
House Smoked mozzarella fried cheese sticks: The cold smoke was absolutely amazing in that fried crunchy deliciousness. I was sad that I actually had to share.
Big Ass Chips and Guacamole: them some big ass chips and they were damn good.

There was another group of the same size seated near us who seemed to receive better service in some areas. We started out ordering drinks and appetizers about 15 minute after being seated. Our drinks weren't delivered for 25 minutes, and the appetizers nearly 10 minutes after that. Beverages really should not take that long! We had requested our server a few times in between this time frame and he didn't appear to take our entree order until 8:45. We were missing one appetizer and had to continually remind him as well. The entrees finally arrived about 35 minutes later, and the missing appetizer after that. Kindly, they at least removed that appetizer from the bill. Receiving the bill was another long wait, but we were able to use the Yelp check-in of 10% off which we had to remind our server of twice. 

The saving grace was the food. I ordered the Pan Roasted Chicken. This was a succulent boneless breast of chicken with a wing attached, served atop wilted spinach and creamy red quinoa. On top of all of this was a marsala mushroom sauce. The dish had a ton of flavor and the creamy red quinoa was really the star for me. The mushrooms and wilted spinach balanced out the creaminess of the other elements. I wanted to like this restaurant because we all enjoyed our food.

We each ordered a cocktail (spiced pear for her, smoked whiskey with housemade cola for me) and three small plates to share. My drink was a bit sweeter than I like, possibly because the cola had very little carbonation, but it was very tasty nonetheless. 

We ordered the charcuterie board, chicken pot pie nuggets, and duck confit poutine topped with a sunny side up egg for an extra $2. The charcuterie was very good: prosciutto di Parma, capicola, and a very smoky pancetta served with grilled bread, mustard, pickled vegetables, and perhaps the best tomato jam I've ever tasted. I wasn't overly thrilled with the pot pie nuggets; I guess I was expecting actual chunks of chicken inside. The flavor was good, however, and they were hotter than napalm when delivered to the table. Thankfully both our food runner and waiter advised us to be careful. The duck confit poutine was served over Rick Moonen's incredible tater tots, which have to be among the best on this planet.

Loved the decor, the old dark wood with the fluffy couches and chairs.  We thought we were in for a treat.  The wine list came on an iPad, but there was not a lot of information about the wines.  We finally settled on a Cabernet and asked for a decanter.  That was when we got a blank look from the server.  She must have asked the manager because he came to our table and said ""We have a decanter, we just have to find it"".  Ok,  Im willing to concede that maybe this place doesn't usually serve wine that needs to be decanted very often.  Our server was mostly non existent for most of the night.  That was surprising because the place was mostly empty.   The appetizers were good,  we had the bacon w/ quail eggs, pot pie chicken nuggets and guacamole. Everyone at the table thought the appetizers were great.  Several of us ordered the filet, mostly cooked medium to medium rare, all 3 were cooked well done.   This happens, I know, you can always send it back.  But when your are paying $42 for a filet alone, you expect them to at least cook it right.  There was absolutely no flavor to the filets at all.  We ordered some sides and they were disappointing.  The Brussel Sprouts had some sour aftertaste that had nothing to do with Brussel Sprouts, the Asparagus was completely bland.  For a restaurant  that has prices like these, the food should be better.  I would highly recommend folks to skip this place.

We were not disappointed in Boiler Room. The service was great, the environment was fun, industrial without being heavy and definitely a nice place to dine at night. There was not a large crowd, but I don't think we went until later and night. The music was at a perfect volume, and I liked that the restaurant was a little more edgy compared to its predecessor. 

After flipping through the menu, my husband settled for the appetizer portion of the Duck Lettuce Wraps, and the waitress (the moment I said I was gluten free)suggested the lobster pasta but made with zucchini pasta. You know...a mandolined zucchini instead of pasta. Low carb and delicious? Sign me up!

My husband's lettuce wraps left him wanting more. Savory, not greasy, delicious and just what he wanted them to be. My pasta was great. Maybe a little more salt and pepper and a hit of cheese would have helped just a bit, but it's not like I'm complaining here. I ate most of the dish while my husband finished the rest. We both could have eaten it all over again, not because the portions were too small but because the quality of food was so high and the taste was delicious.

You will not be disappointed going to RX Boiler Room.",-WCWlsVGhxaLQMfpKuuKhw,2,2,5,w1UoAC9lIANpZGTkse2kdw
2942997,2013-08-12,1,_hML_SleB40KkUrMHOZ_-Q,"We were excited to try this new restaurant. Tried the chicken pot pie nuggets, they had a nice thin crisp but the insides were half empty so they were a meh.

The Inside out French Onion Grilled Cheese Cheese Sandwich was tasty and the Onion soup laced with wine was good.

The slow cooked egg on the jumbo asparagus seemed undercooked and slightly
raw. The whites were slightly undercooked and runny. The yolk was not velvety as I am sure the chef intended. The asparagus were nice fresh and crisp but I didn't enjoy the undercooked egg on it, as it was just asparagus in a pool of liquid that didn't coat the asparagus. I've eaten slow cooked eggs before and missed that velvety consistency. 

The VERY BEST OUTSTANDING thing I tried were the fish tacos. They were so delicious and layered with flavors and spices on clever thin crisp taro root shells. But the problem was they were so tiny, more tiny than street tacos maybe only a little over an inch long. But they were $4.00 each so you spend $12.00 for Super Great Tacos that are only slightly larger than amuse bouche sized. The tacos we received were just too small for $12.00 so I feel that is a meh.

Cheese plate was OK but uninspired. Some of the grapes had rotten spots. While not fully rotten they were too far from fresh to be on the plate.  A little concern and observation from the kitchen should have caught this.

We brought the grape issue to someone's attention in a nice way asking for nothing in return, and were told someone would come out to speak with us. We waited and waited then got the check and then paid the check. Nobody ever came out.

I would have given three stars but since nobody came out to speak to us. Price point is a factor too.

Wine selection by the glass is limited $14. - $25. a glass 

Cocktails that I looked at ran $14.00 - $17.00 a glass",V-BbqKqO8anwplGRx9Q5aQ,5,3,2,C_-rW5-tJae_WB1mmukCaQ
2946090,2013-07-10,0,_hML_SleB40KkUrMHOZ_-Q,"I really wanted to like this place; when my travel companions and I heard about it we were excited to check it out, but unfortunately we all left underwhelmed.

First, the pros: the service was pretty good - slow at times, but attentive and friendly, and the chef stopped by our table to make sure everything was going well. They seem eager to get feedback, which is a big part of the reason I'm leaving a review. The drinks (we went late and only for cocktails) were also creative and pretty good (more on the safe side than really daring, but we certainly enjoyed them). I won't be commenting at all on food except to say that we'd already had dinner and were stuffed, but there were a few things I saw on the menu that I would've loved to try. I was tickled to see milk and fresh-baked cookies on there; it's a fantastic idea I haven't seen before.

But here's the thing: My friends and I are used to high-end cocktail bars/restaurants in Chicago like the Barrelhouse Flat and Gilt Bar, and we all felt that as far as theming goes, this place could have taken some a page out of the rustic industrial stylebook that's very popular right now in other cities. (And being as we all work in the video games or costuming industries, we would have liked to see a little more real Victorian flavor instead of the corset-and-goggles stuff that fans of the genre tend to hate.) Things like decorating with real vintage glassware (which is readily available) instead of brand new lab glass and playing music that's a bit more classic than Icona Pop (doesn't have to be Victorian... some Ink Spots or even Johnny Cash would do just fine) would take the gimmick and turn it into real atmosphere. And we understand that it's Vegas, but the uniforms felt pretty Halloweeny. There were a lot of nice touches to the decor (loved the furniture and especially the antique piano), but it could definitely use a few tweaks; there were just certain things that were conspicuously out of place and very distracting.

The prices were the other thing that left us balking. We expect to pay a lot for cocktails in Vegas, even compared to cities like Chicago and NYC, but one of our friends received a sixteen dollar drink that came in a rocks glass and was literally more crushed ice than liquid, a problem that I've never encountered at a good cocktail bar. The other cocktails were fine, but when my wife ordered a hot earl grey tea, it turned out to be SEVEN dollars, and thus the bill for us for two cocktails, an iced tea, and a hot tea turned out to be fifty bucks. We regularly spend twice that much at bars, and we'd just had dinner at Joel Robuchon the night before and paid twenty dollars for water; we're not cheap and we generally know what we're getting into. But seven dollars for hot tea is just absurd in a place like this - and the 4.50 for the glass of iced tea was already pushing it. It is NOT the prices overall that are the problem; the food menu looked pretty standard and the cocktail and beer prices were all right for the market. But gouging people on little things like non-alcoholic beverages is a good way to annoy them and leave them with a sour taste in their mouths.

We come to Vegas every year and love it, but we'd also love to see the Strip gain some more restaurants and lounges that are original and focus more on real atmosphere than Disneyland-style gimmicks and bartenders who are more looks than know-how. This place is brand new and could easily work out some kinks and be really great. I'm pretty sure that experiencing the food could easily have changed our opinion for the better, but as a lounge we did find it lacking.",4BNZy5RTlw5PY3OkFdHGEA,1,0,3,fsA5QgIg_58Cl1f2lnIEWA

Cool decor (temperature when we first sat down was way too warm); adequate service; pretty good, but not totally awesome cuisine. Overpriced cocktails & entrees. Salmon was tasty & so were the ribs...but again, not Wow!

Steampunk? Uh, I have more steampunk going on in my bathroom than this place does in it's entirety. The decor here was quickly slapped together with cheap materials.  Some brilliant designer said (I'm sure) to RM ""let's do a steampunk theme!"" {Fantastic!}, I'm sure he replied with the gusto that all ""celebrity"" chefs possess. So then said designer takes RM's money and goes to the equivalent of a steampunk Ikea catalogue and orders a bunch of rubbish in one fell swoop. The result? Half-assedness.

Gears and machinery are, last I checked, typically metal. Not here, from what I saw it was mostly wood...and cheap at that. You can't fake wood to look like actual metal. Look up at the ceiling, through your monocle, you'll see what I'm talking about. Glance above the entranceway, past your period-correct mustache, at the scaffold-like display you walk under; it's laughable.  If you're going to go this route with this type of theme you aught to do it correctly or risk being labeled a poser, poseur's. 

Oh, they have fancy concoctions; you may have heard them referred to as craft cocktails, pricey ones at that...I alluded to this above, prior to my design rant. For 45$ those two drinks should kick ass, take names and smack me in my mouth so hard that my roustabout stovepipe hat falls to the floor faster than one can say Penny-farthing. But, they did not. 

Service: Have you had fantastic service from a newb at Applebee's? Then you'd be impressed. I was not.",UQB87Neb-M6xbxT6hi9rcw,6,4,2,Fwy2TE8DhDQbTkiDHwEDzw

Sat in the back near the stage, and was very pleasantly surprised the live music was NOT blaringly loud.

Loved the music with dinner.  Our friends were impressed that we took them to such a nice place.  (We hadn't been there before so we touted it as a nice, steampunk bar.  Little did we know that it's really a restaurant WITH a bar.)

Everything we ordered was Fantastic! 
-We shared the mac n cheese.  It was creamy and cheesy.  It was good, but not knock-your-socks-off good.
-The Mezza Platter was excellent! The taramasalata was phenomenal.  Don't think... Don't ask... just try it. Be adventurous. (if you're not allergic to fish)
-I had the Chopped Vegetable & Organic Greens with Shrimp.  I'm actually craving this salad right now as I write.  Simple, fresh and oh-so-yummy.
-Husband had the salmon special... tender and flavorful.
-Friends had the pastrami sliders, buffalo burger and inside out French onion grilled cheese... all of which looked amazing.... and they said it was too.

Service was spot-on.  They were there when we needed them as if they knew somehow.  Otherwise, they left us alone to enjoy each other's company and the music.

A gal came by before we were done eating to say there would be a magician later on, but we didn't stick around long enough to see that. (Next time.)

I sat at the bar and I was delighted to learn I was there during Happy Hour (their HH is great). The atmosphere/decor has an eclectic feel with lighting that was quite dim creating an intimate feel.

From the same colleague's recommendation I went with their Chicken Pot Pie Nuggets (with Natural Jus, Peas, and Carrots), Bacon-N-Eggs (with Brioche Toast, Tomato Jam, and Sunny Side Quail Egg), and their Duck Confit Poutine (with Moonen Tater Tots, Cheddar Cheese Curds, and Bordelaise sauce).

Both the Bacon Wrapped Bacon-N-Eggs and Duck Confit Poutine were exceptional and an absolute joy to eat. Between these two I'm not sure which one I loved more. The Bacon Wrapped Bacon-N-Eggs were amazing bites of sheer flavor and the Duck Confit Poutine was so damn good - this coming from a duck and a poutine snob. The duck was juicy and crispy at the same time and wasn't over salted as is often the case with duck. The cheese curds and taters were great and the magnificent Bordelaise sauce tied everything together perfectly.

The Chicken Pot Pie Nuggets on the other hand were good, but not as mind blowing as the other two dishes. I also got a glass whiskey and was thankful to my bartender for his generous pour.

Atmosphere: Perfect. Admittedly, we're both very into steampunk, industrial sort of looks, and this place pulled it off beautifully, from the decorations to the uniforms.

Drinks: I got ""Some Like it Hot,"" which is comprised of Ford's gin, Solerno blood orange liqueur, honey syrup, lemon, habanero shrub bitters, sierra nevada pale ale, smoked paprika-pink Himalayan salt. It was a unique taste, and I sucked it down. (I love me some foods/drinks with a kick.

She got ""How Many Licks"" on the server's recommendation, comprised of raisin-infused Hennessy Black cognac, house-made plum-vanilla bean shrub, disaronno amaretto, lemon, sauternes wine, fever-free soda water, grated nutmeg, cognac-soaked raisins. She really enjoyed it ... and again, a very unique flavor (tasted like ... as you'd assume ... raisins).

Food: We got (forgive me, I forget some of the names) shrimp corndogs, chicken pot pie nuggets, and inside-out French onion grilled cheese sandwiches. All three were awesome. We both adored the sandwiches, and our opinions were flipped on the corndogs vs nuggets. (I loved the corndogs, she loved the nuggets, and we were both just OK with the other.)

Downsides: A little expensive, and the serving staff was a bit *too* attentive (they were almost vultures, secretly and awkwardly spying on us to make sure we didn't need anything, and a different person would come by our table every few minutes to ask how everything was). Those are small complaints, to be sure, and regarding the staff ... it's been open for FIVE DAYS as of this post, and they're still getting their sea legs; given that, I think they did an excellent job.

Inside Out French Onion Grilled Cheese: last item to come out and we were super full but still yummy. A little on the rich side and may not order again.

We went in with a large party that while all the food was going to be on one check, the drinks were going to be split between 8-10 people. For most restaurants this would have been a problem but for the RX Boiler Room they treated it like it was no big deal. Their hostesses made sure that the waitresses knew the situation and when we explained how much we loved the lobby area with the tables and couches, told us we could stay in the couch and lobby area which made it easy for the group to get up and talk to various people as our party grew to more than 13 (I lost count at some point). So a big huge thank you to the staff - most restaurants wouldn't have been happy, but you wouldn't have known it was an issue at all for the staff of the RX Boiler Room. I should say we went in on a Sunday night, so had we descended on them on a busier night like Saturday or Sunday they may have been less enthusiastic. 


Our party was there mostly to enjoy the ambiance of being in a Steampunk (that's a genre of science fiction that borrows from the Victorian Age which was the age of Steam for it's look and themes), but  we were all blown away by the service and the quality of the food and drinks.  We must have ordered at least one of every side dish and small plate. While everything was good, the favorites were the chicken pot pie nuggets, the inside out french onion soup,  and you would have thought we were little kids in corsets, top hats, and goggles when the cookies and milk came. 

Drinks are $10-12 so it is not inexpensive to drink there,but the drinks are creative and interesting and the staff is great on advising regarding your choices.  Food is fairly reasonable, especially for strip prices and a few appetizers/small plates really dose work well for my husband and I. 

I have some minor knocks on the place: 

They have a slide show of Steampunk art, but no credit is given to the artists who made the work. Whoever did their slideshow should go back in and put in artist name and website/tumblr/blog link in the lower right corner.  

I had heard drinks came in beakers and didn't see any drinks served in science type glass ware.  Maybe we didn't order the right drinks?  It was kinda a bummer, but nothing major. 

I wanted to go around and give all the waitstaff hats or fascinators, depending on gender.  It was one missing fashion piece to cap off the look. That said, they were all attentive servers and absolutely at the top of their game.

3206049,2014-03-07,1,_hML_SleB40KkUrMHOZ_-Q,"One word to describe this place: amazing! I don't know what other people are talking about with the service but we had an excellent server named Fred who took care of us all night, as well as the manager who checked in on our meal twice and other staff who brought the food and water. Everyone was so attentive and friendly.

The decor was beautiful as well. I wouldn't say it is steam punk as others have mentioned but more like London Gothic/eclectic with the red drapes and various curios around. The bar decor reminds me of an apothecary with all the Erlenmeyer flasks. 

And of course the food. My boyfriend and I started with the Moonen seafood sausage dogs that Rick Moonen made in a quickfire on Top Chef Masters. We were so excited to try them since we are big fans of the show and they did not disappoint! The sausage is actually quite hearty and perfectly complemented by the sauerkraut and potato chips sprinkled on top for some crunch. For the main course I had the seafood shepherd's pie which was so delicious. There was tons of scallops, shrimp, and king crab as well as carrots and peas in a yummy sauce with mashed potatoes on top. My boyfriend had the bucket of game hen. They were chicken wings but had the most succulent, moist meat and a super crispy seasoned breading. We didn't get to try any of the cocktails or dessert because we were feeling pretty broke by the end of the meal but we will definitely be back to eat next time we're in Vegas!",08Mi5YofPJaM_8Vo3TmG3Q,2,1,5,69fNnrQmT2S9Zwc6fYJCXg
3250298,2018-06-29,0,_hML_SleB40KkUrMHOZ_-Q,"First off I loved the decor and ambiance of this restaurant. It had a quirky steam punk type of vibe. I came here for a dinner with some coworkers and they were an eccentric bunch to say the least. They made lots of requests that may have been a bit odd for the staff but the staff handled all the requests graciously and made accommodations for everyone. The manager stopped by our table a few times and was very friendly. We did end up having a bit of a hiccup. Someone did find a rubber band in their plate, it was probably the rubber band that held together the asparagus or something. We did bring it up to our server who was extremely apologetic and the manager did come over apologize profusely and comp the meal as well as some dessert to make up for the kitchen mishap. Besides that, the common consensus at the table was that the food was quite delicious. For appetizers we ordered the cheese platter, the chicken pot pie nuggets and the meatball. I loved the chicken pot pie nuggets. As my main entree I ordered the stuffed jumbo shrimp which are stuffed with crabmeat and served with orzo. SO.  GOOD.  I was so stuffed with the appetizers that I could not finish my entree and I had no fridge in my hotel room so I couldn't save any food. I still get a little weepy thinking of the food that I had to leave behind....
Easy break down here is 4 stars for the food and ambiance and the extra star is definitely for the service. From the hostess, to our servers and the manager, they were all excellent.",zRP8ABvF9gClPWH4eiuAYQ,0,0,5,VSe9lMwYEJDqceWIl5lC9Q

We were sat in front of the Dyson fan and the room was almost empty so we moved ourselves a table over.  We waited a long time for our drinks and had to mention it to the manager when he came by to say hi.  Our waiter was a nice person but not very good.  He never acknowledged the delay with the drinks.   I wanted a baked potato since I saw the remains of one go by,  but when I ordered it, they said they were out of them which is weird cause not many people were there. I know that is not a reason for the low rating, but it's all part of my downward spiral here.  Food was not paced out.  They brought our dinner while we were still having our appetizer. I ordered the New York steak medium and it was pretty tough and rare.  The first bite of the steak was medium which is when I said everything was okay when they asked but really rare after that and I couldn't eat it.  The food came lukewarm which is surprising since again, there weren't that many other people there when we ordered so not sure what happened.    I was dying for the manager to come back and ask us again how we were doing.  When our waiter came back towards the end and asked how the food was, I mentioned the steak was too rare so I couldn't eat it, and he said oh, and just took my plate.  With that much food left, no one asked if we wanted a box or anything.  For 50.00 for a steak, I might have wanted to take it home and cook it. But, I really just wanted to leave as everything was so wrong and I guess I expected too much because of the chef.

3363103,2015-09-09,0,_hML_SleB40KkUrMHOZ_-Q,"Amazing! So this is a high end restaurant in Vegas. There were 4 of us and we had apps, mains and dessert. Bill was $350 with tip. Not bad. Our server was Laura. She was fantastic.

We we're going to order just the pot pie nuggets for the app and she recommended the bacon wrapped bacon. We were game, so we ordered both. Both apps were unique and so tasty. I'm not a big fan of pork belly (too fatty for me), but the bacon wrapped bacon was delicious. I did not feel the sliminess of the fat. The pot pie nuggets we fantastic. So much so, that I plan to try to replicate them at home. We'll see how that works out. 

We also ordered a couple of the cocktails. They were a little too sweet for our taste. Hubby's had the beer and they were fine with it.

I had the salmon, hubby had the scallops and our friends had the short ribs and lamb (a recommend from Laura). Everything was fantastic. Luckily we're not shy, so I got to taste everything. I LOVE salmon, so I was very happy with my choice. I think the scallop dish was a little small and underwhelming, but the hubby liked it. I'm not a big fan of lamb, but I was a little jealous I did not order it. If I would have ordered the scallops, I would have been down right pissed. The short ribs were good, but not memorable. 

We also ordered the tater tot and mac and cheese. The tater tots were so unique and very flavorful. I wish I would have eaten more tater tots and skipped dessert. I can't comment on the mac and cheese, as I didn't taste it (I don't like cheese, I know weird). Everyone who tried it said it was great. 

We ordered the tiramisu and bread pudding. The tiramisu was recommend by a diner leaving the restaurant and she said it was a must try, so we did. I'm married to an Italian and I've eaten at his grandma's house (she's straight off the boat from Italy), so in my opinion, it was average. Also, I'm not a fan of bread pudding, so again, it was okay. 

Would i go back? Absolutely, but i'd probably order everything off the small plate and sides menu and skip the entrees and desert.

If you can request Laura, she is absolutely fantastic at her job!",wgvwoZZNrO8MaSWltH63vA,0,0,5,UvSlP4eGECTPC2CvBrsukA

I had the best long Island iced tea I've ever had and something they called Pomme Blanc... A rich scotch-based martini with lemon that I can't begin to describe.

3503812,2013-08-25,1,_hML_SleB40KkUrMHOZ_-Q,"I'm perfectly ok with giving Rick Moonen one star.   I know this place is new.  I would love to go back in a year and re-review.

So, on to the long short of it...

This place is cute and (dare I say) whimsical in décor but sexy at the same time.   Weird.  Anyway, the menu is 100% comfort food.   They indeed fry and throw cheese on items here without hesitation.   Here's what I tried enough of to review:

Bacon Wrapped Bacon and Egg - 3 perfect little bites great balance of flavor.

Inside out French Onion Grilled Cheese - Ooie Gooie cheesy deliciousness combining by 2 favorite things onions and cheese!

Bucket of Crispy Fried Game Hen - Ok, here is the reason for my one star.  This was the greasiest, flattest chicken that I have ever tasted.   It was, in one word, awful.  It is accompanied by a massive clump of shaved celery and carrots on top of the basket...wtf do I do with those?!? I'm eating with my hands here.  It comes in a diner style wire basket and you get no plate which was only slightly annoying after I tasted the thing.  I absolutely regret getting this.

Johnny's Big Dry Aged Burger - This was delicious and as an onion lover, I completely appreciated the added flavor of the Balsamic onions in each bite.  But, its a burger...so yah.

Mahalo Matcha Panna Cotta - Matcha Panna Cotta good...pineapples ok, but the addition of the passion fruit sorbet was just weird.  I don't feel like this combination worked well together at all.  A bite of all 3 at once, let my mouth very confused.  The hunks of macadamia nut tuile...just made things worse.

Peach Cobbler - I'm not sure if this was good or my dessert was so bad, I was happy to taste something that at least worked as one harmonious dish.

Supporting my decision for 1 star, plain and simple is the fact that this place is WAY...WAY overpriced.   I feel like I'm paying for the Moonen name...which is fine, but when this isn't paired with Moonen quality.  I find myself full of regret that I ever stepped foot in this place.  If you insist on trying... get some small bites and some cocktails.  Save yourself the money and the frustration.  Also, keep in mind that they still don't have a Happy Hour in place so give it a couple of months.",ZZc-pFlOH85eRoUqbtz2Nw,2,1,1,il2tnzalqp30m9kMV_WH0A
3509292,2013-08-11,1,_hML_SleB40KkUrMHOZ_-Q,"What didn't we order? I swear, we must have ordered 1 of everything on the menu!
There were 8 of us and we got seated in the chandelier room. We were the first party to ever sit there, which sounds cool, but the place was only open for 8 days, lol.
Everyone ordered what they wanted and we all just shared everything. The cheese platters was delicious. The Mediterranean platter with humus and tsisiki sauce and that was GREAT! I loved that one so much. One thing keeping it from 5 stars, we ordered the only kale caesar salad and it hardly had any kale in it. That was disappointing. The name of the salad was ALL KALE.......The drinks were good, but do expect to pay about $15 on average for one. 

Rick himself came over and talked to us for a bit, AND took a pic of us as the first party in the chandelier room and uploaded to his Instagram account. That was cool! We had a fun time and everyone really enjoyed everything. Some items were definitely bigger hits than others, but there was nothing that everyone didn't like, so that's good.

3519456,2013-08-09,1,_hML_SleB40KkUrMHOZ_-Q,"I'm all for the gastropub fad sweeping through the city, especially with the transformation of the upstairs of RM Seafood to Rx Boiler Room. The whole steampunk motif is cool although it looks like they spent more time updating the entry and lounge area than the main dining room. The theme could have been pushed a little more throughout the restaurant. It is Vegas, so taking it over the top would have been fitting.

It's one of the better gastropubs in town and while there were some dishes that missed the mark, others were stellar. The best of the bunch was the bucket of crispy game hen ($16). Its large portion size makes it one of the better deals in the restaurant and the well seasoned, light, crispy, peppery exterior and tender, fall-off-the-bone meat could challenge for the best fried chicken in town.

Another excellent dish was the Maine lobster roll ($24). Not much was changed from a traditional version of the dish and maybe that's what makes it so good. It's simple and delicious. The only drawbacks are that there wasn't enough lobster meat and it was slightly overdressed.

I'm a fan of their braised oxtail croquettes ($9). The savory and rich beef had a texture similar to a brisket and the sauce added just the right amount of acidity. Another beef dish -- the grilled Niman Ranch skirt steak ($24) -- was small, but perfectly seasoned. Accompanying the steak were house-made tater tots with a light and airy interior that made them one of the highlights of the night. The mac and cheese ($14) was pretty awesome too. The pinwheel pasta was fitting with the gear and steampunk motif of the restaurant and the use of five different cheeses will have your tastebuds doing cartwheels.

Other dishes we tried included a fairly standard Rx guacamole ($8) that wasn't nearly as delicious as the duck fat chips it came with. The chicken pot pie nuggets ($8) were just... meh... The heavy and thick exterior didn't help at all. Rx steak-n-eggs ($24) will probably disappoint most just because the cost-to-size ratio is hard to ignore. It's a small portion that had a lot going on -- too many flavors and textures that muted what was probably some quality beef.

Let's hope they get enough business to keep this place open. When we were there on a Friday night it was dead. The location isn't ideal for attracting diners and if you park in the Mandalay Bay garage it's a long haul. The best way to get here is to valet at Mandalay Place (between Mandalay Bay and Luxor) and take the escalator up to the shops and dining area.",C2C0GPKvzWWnP57Os9eQ0w,7,3,4,vFffGB0LbI4BaXcZJMuZIQ

However I would be lying to you if I didn't say that it was the menu that really captured my attention more than my curiosity.  

ATMOSPHERE: 5 out of 5 Stars

As you walk through the metal archway the ambiance of the restaurant takes over.  Burnt red walls adorned with flowing red drapes surround the leather riveted chairs, hardwood tables and staff members dressed in Steampunk attire; creating a unique, yet pleasant feeling of ambiguity as to what will come next.  I truly felt that this wasn't just going to be a meal, it was going to be an experience. 

FOOD: 4 out of 5 Stars

The menu was elevated Contemporary American and offered a broad range of choices in categories like: Small Bites (Tapas or Appetizers), Boards & Jars, Garden (Salads), Land (Meats), Ocean (Seafood), Trimmings (Sides) and Sweetness (Desserts).  I have a weakness for Duck Confit Poutine, when I see it on a menu, I have to order it.  I also asked for Rx Guacamole with Big Ass Chips and Braised Colorado Lamb Shank. 

The guacamole came out first and they were not kidding about the big ass chips. Unlike a traditional guacamole and tortilla chips, this was served with full sized, thinly sliced russet potatoes. The guacamole was obviously freshly made with big chunks of avocado, red onion and fresh cilantro. The poutine was next. I should tell you that this also was not a typical poutine, as the french fries were replaced with house made tots.  That in itself really made the dish, but the copious amounts of duck confit put it over the top. This was without a doubt the highlight of the meal.  The lamb was served over a bed of toasted orzo and was a considerable portion size, the only negative comment I could make was that it could have used another half hour of braising; otherwise it was delicious. 

SERVICE: 5 out of 5 Stars

Our server was Rachel, who mentioned early on that she was new and had only been there a month.  She quickly introduced herself and explained the concept of the restaurant. She also reviewed the drink menu and made a number of suggestions based on my likes and dislikes on top of that she routinely checked back to ensure everything was going smoothly. Her bright and personable attitude was a wonderful addition to the ambiance of the restaurant.

PRICE: 3 out of 5 Stars

This is Las Vegas, nothing is cheap.  If I were to compare this to other restaurants offering same plates, it would fall in line. However, with that being said, just because your neighbor over charges, doesn't mean that you should over charge as well. Two appetizers, two entrees and three cocktails totaled $142. 56 (before tip), anywhere outside of Vegas this meal would have been less than $100. 

OVERALL EXPERIENCE: 4 Stars

The décor, the ambiance, the food and the service really made this an experience that was truly unique. Would I return to the Rx Boiler Room in the future?

We talked at length about various spirits and cocktails, and after starting with cocktails on the menu we switched to whatever he felt like making.

Rick Moonen was a genuinely cool guy that did a meet and great at our table!  Cool and down to earth and a people person doing a good job at sustainable seafood offerings.  We had a tasting menu - but some of the items are on the menu.  Highly reco the Bacon wrapped Bacon N Egg appetizer.  Its a brilliant little morsel (at least on the tasting menu) that truly IS breakfast in a bite! Umami yumminess!  

The tuna tataki was scrumptious and beautiful! Third course was the Grilled North Salmon which was delicious.  I'm not a huge salmon fan, but I felt like i was eating a white fish - not fishy tasting at all. Fourth course of a braised lamb shank ragu which was beyond good.  I could have just had that on all on my own, but thankfully my husband helped finish that off b/c he loves lamb so much.  

The only miss was the dessert of the citrus berry torte.  It could have been smaller - i was so stuffed after the first 4 courses that I didn't need a big piece, and quite frankly I feel like it was not fresh.  Something more simple/smaller would be awesome, but overall...I highly recommend this restaurant in Mandalay (on top of RM - his signature restaurant which is UBER super awesome - was there for a company event last year)!

3758602,2013-12-30,4,_hML_SleB40KkUrMHOZ_-Q,"I'm one of the many folks who never had an opportunity to eat at the upstairs restaurant of RM Seafood, which was very fancy and more upscale than the casual vibe from the downstairs restraurant which I've visited a few times.  But now that Rick Moonen has re-imagined the spot as a steampunk inspired tapas gastropub which is fittingly named, Rx Boiler Room,  I thought it would be worth a try since it's a more casual spot now.  I love what they've done with the place with the steampunk look.

Since their slogan is ""The alchemy of food & drink"", I figured that it would only be right to try at least one of their specialty cocktails.  On their iPad cocktail menu (http://bit.ly/1h8Y1Ru), they all looked and sounded pretty cool.

Smoked Whiskey & Cola -- http://bit.ly/1fsH0RI
George Dickel Tennessee Whiskey, House made Cola Syrup, Bittercube Cherrybark Vanilla Bitters, Fever Tree Soda Water, & Smoked Cherrywood Chips
They call this Jack & Coke's much cooler cousin, and by simply looking at their presentation I can definitely see why.  Let's face it, I only really bought this drink just so I can see the Smoking Skull for the Smoked Whiskey.  It was badass!!  The drink was pretty good though and went well with my meal.

I made a late dinner reservation at Rx Boiler Room at 10pm on a Friday night.  I think one thing that makes this place shine is that it's open really late on the weekends till 2am.  The only thing that was regretting about that late reservation was because it was my second dinner that night and I came in only 50% hungry.  But thankfully Rx Boiler Room's menu has a very diverse selection of plates that can satisfy any type of appetite with a whole array of small plates and some very large plates as well that include thick cut steaks and seafood.  So naturally, I ordered some of their popular small plates that I've seen pics of on yelp that looked and sounded the most interesting.

Rx Fish Tacos in Taro Root Shells -- http://bit.ly/191AwKs
Kampachi Tartare with Grapefruit
Basically they're mini ceviche tacos.  Pretty pricey, but every bite was so good!

Bacon Wrapped Bacon-N-Egg --  http://bit.ly/1c2r1ev
Brioche Toast, Tomato Jam, and Sunny Side Quail Egg.
This is probably their most popular plate and it's pretty obvious why.  I mean it doesn't get any better than bacon wrapped pork belly topped with a quail egg on sweet toasted brioche.  It's ridiculously good!

Chicken Pot Pie Nuggets -- http://bit.ly/191Asup
Tempura Fried filled with Natural Jus and Peas-N-Carrots
I think this is one of their more creative entrees.  No sauce needed with these nuggets because it's all inside!

I ordered a good amount of food and I found myself pretty full after having all these small plates.  If I wasn't so full, I probably would've tried their take on the famous cronut, or coughnut, as its spelled on their menu.

So even though I only tried just a small sample of what Rx Boiler Room had to offer, it was definitely enough to make a fan out of me.  I could probably see myself coming here more often than RM Seafood because it's easily more accessible and inviting with it's casual approach and up my alley as a gastropub with a steampunk setting, great creative food, and interesting cocktails.",F_5_UNX-wrAFCXuAkBZRDw,8,4,5,K6dN-G2dRjacaD2mQ_bSoQ

I had duck l'orange lettuce wraps and they were delicious - flavorful with lots of interesting toppings and a large portion.  Three of us wolfed down two orders of tater tots, which were the tastiest tater tots we've ever eaten.

Started with their chicken pot pies (which were actually perfect, $14-ish). Reminded me of those chewy dim sum dishes with the starchy skin and soft fillings, except with pot pie. Delicious. 

Also had their meze platter ($14-ish?), but I found their babaganoush and the taramasalata over salted. The tzatziki sauce was actually quite refreshing and I liked the stringy bits of shredded cucumber. Again, if everything was seasoned correctly, I would have enjoyed it immensely. 

Then shared their greens and vegetable salad...I had to return the salad. The dressing was again, overkilled with salt/soy sauce. Asked for them to prepare the salad again but the dressing on the side. Hubby kept eating...but he did agree there was a lot of salt. 

Shared brussel sprouts ($9) and bone in rib eye steak ($60+). Fortunately, everything came out perfect for this part of dinner. Ordered with au jus (+$3)

Finished with the cola cake with berry sorbet. Dense and chocolatey, but I found it a touch dry. 

Had a cocktail and 3 glasses of wine ($50-ish). Total was about $200 total, pre tip.

First, although there were plenty of tables and booths, we were stuck at a 4-top (2 of us) right at the kitchen door. Bad enough, but wait staff kept going behind my chair (which was 12"" from the wall) when there was a 3' wide path opposite...seriously? It took 20 minutes to get our drink order...another 10 for us to order wine and food...and then 30 minutes before either came out. We ordered the pot-pie poppers....we're told they were super hot (cold...even the serving dish was barely warm). 

I had the duck lettuce wraps (was the duck supposed to be cold?) and my wife had the Jumbo Stuffed Shrimp (the shrimp themselves were ok, but the carb was a gooey paste that had an off smell). Avoid this place at all costs.

3912285,2014-11-29,1,_hML_SleB40KkUrMHOZ_-Q,"Everything about this place (except my main course) was awesome. 

Atmosphere - Obviously, its decorated in quasi steampunk fashion- they didn't go overboard, so it feels more natural than sitting in an overly themed restaurant. It's a little dark inside, which is great. Combined with some recessed booths and curtains, it felt sort of like a speakeasy. After we ordered our apps, we noticed two musicians setting up some equipment behind us on the ""stage"" area. I was initially upset that we'd be sitting so close to live music, but was pleasantly surprised. One musician played a saxophone, and the other a guitar. They played very softly, and it just totally added to the ambiance of this place. 

Service - Our host, server, and server assistant were very nice, and attentive. A+ for them! 

Food - This place deserves nation recognition for successfully making chicken pot pie bites. Yes, you heard me right: CHICKEN. POT. PIE. BITES. Here I was, thinking mac and cheese bites were the pinnacle of comfort food-turned appetizer. Id come back here every day if I could. They somehow were able to get chicken, peas, carrots, and that signature chicken pot pie gravy into a bite sized miracle. They should team up with Trader Joe's. 

If all I got was the chicken pot pie bites, I would've given this place 5 stars. Unfortunately, I also got the chicken and waffles (Im a comfort food kinda guy, can you tell?). And now that I think of it, it wasn't even chicken, it was ""game hen."" It was honestly, bad. The waffle was the thinnest waffle ever. It was more like a pizzelle. By the time my meal got to me, the citrus/maple glaze made them pretty soggy. You also got what I believe was two breasts, and two wings. My own personal preference with chicken and waffles is a boneless breast (its easier to cut pieces of chicken without bone). It just ended up being difficult to eat... the logistics of cutting up boned chicken and waffle. And not for nothing, but traditional chicken would've been better on this dish (as would a traditional waffle). 

Entertainment - I am unsure if this is just a weekend thing or not, but we had a magician come over to our table while waiting for our apps to come out. Like the musicians, I immediately rolled my eyes. The magician performed maybe 4 card tricks, and was at our table for a little over 5 minutes. It was actually one of my favorite things about this place! He was friendly, funny, and did not stay at our table for long. Perfect for Vegas. 

I really enjoyed this place, and would highly recommend this place to future patrons. On top of good food (lets just forget about that chick and waffle incident), good atmosphere and service, the prices for everything were very reasonable (even cheap for Vegas).",_VpHzhXenhrjlOeeCNRpCg,2,1,4,n4XwtOrIV7SWPr7K1-BNgg

That being said, I was there with a group so we didn't order from the regular menu. Our appetizer was a quail egg and toast corner thing. It didn't taste bad, but it was HUGE since we were told to eat it in one bite. So I can say I've had quail egg. But I would not do that again.

I then got to pick between a salad (caesar, maybe) and shrimp cocktail. I opted for the shrimp, and they were the best oxymoron ever - ENORMOUS cocktail was more like it :D And delicious too. 

For my entree, I could have chosen beef (which I'd had for lunch), salmon (I usually get the seafood - not sure why I didn't this time) or the chicken, which was my choice. I really don't know why I picked the chicken. It tastes like...chicken. The glaze was good, but there wasn't much of it compared to the big piece of chicken. And I promise, that is not where the missing star from my rating went. I know I picked it. But I expected fabulous things after the whiskey and just looking around the room. 
Okay, maybe that is where the other star went. I was a bit disappointed.

For dessert we had a cute little plate with a piece of key lime dessert, a flourless chocolate cake, and something vanilla and gooey. I don't think anyone finished the pudding-ish gooey vanilla stuff. A few people didn't like the flourless chocolate cake, but I polished off the chocolate and the key lime. 

Overall, I would visit again if the people I was with wanted to, but it wouldn't be my first pick with so many options so close.",p2WzI1eXcleCPUbbwJIBUg,1,0,4,Bqc_naztIozyXSChGA_xSg

Last night was KNPR night at Cirque's Michael Jackson One. m I looked at the menu and found that there was enough here for her to eat.  Eating tapas portions is great because you can try different things without getting something you're not particularly fond of.

We were quickly brought the iced teas we ordered and then we ordered the following from the Dips and Bites section of the menu:  For me--chicken liver pâté with a port wine jelly on top.  It was delicious and something I can enjoy because Andrea wouldn't even touch the glass if I paid her to do it, even double dared!  

We also got an order of Inside Out French Onion Grilled Cheese and an order of Chicken Pot Pie Nuggets.  The cheese sandwich has three kinds of cheese and the caramelized onions from onion soup in the sandwich.  The ""soup"" is a small metal container of the au jus from onion soup.  The Chicken Pot Pie bites are wonderful!  Small, deep fried tater tot shaped goodness with peas and carrots inside the nuggets.  Boy, were they good!  That about did it for normal food so it was on to dessert.

Andrea got their Peach cobbler and our server warned her it wasn't a standard peach cobbler but had cinnamon ice cream with... At that point, Andrea stopped her and said, ""I'll have that!""  Just say cinnamon and it will be good.  I ordered the greent tea panna cotta that had small bits of fruit and pieces of macadamia nuts on top.  It was also very, very good.

Now about the service, Chef Moonen, whoever did the hiring and the training for your new restaurant deserves a raise!  Everyone, whether they were associated with our table or not, was king, polite, and had a pleasant smile and were very accommodating.  Our server, Alex, was a pure delight.  She knew the menu inside out, knew how to describe the food, recommended some things, and was a very efficient and pleasant server.  The runner who brought the food was also smiling and friendly.  

When we were leaving, I saw an elevator and I asked if it was for use by the general public.  One of their staff said of course and called the elevator for us.  It saved a number of steps to the other side of the Mandalay Place Shops and we exited right outside the casino.  

One final mention about Alex.  She had on this red bustier type top and short shorts!  I almost asked her if I could take her photo, but that would have almost been an outrageous request for obvious reasons.  She was a delight, visually and professionally.  If you read this, Alex, let me know if it's OK for next time!  Chef Moonen, the person who hired should get a raise.  Hint, hint!

The menu looks like a deliberate attempt to remix everything you can think of, while maintaining the looks of edible food. Between the 6 of us, we thought the food was uneven and the taste didn't meet the expectation we had about the place.

I had ordered an order of fish tacos, which unfortunately is equivalent to 1/6 of an iphone 5 and rudely small. While the menu did say small plates, the portion size of the tacos and the fish itself is laughable. The Peking Duck lettuce wrap was something new for me, in that I never had that combination. The Peking Duck itself is pretty decent, but the sauce is overly sweet and they come with two sad looking strings of red onions and green onions for you. They should have 10x the pickled onions and rid of the sauce.

Overall we enjoyed the meal, but mainly because it was one of our last nights in Vegas and Rx Boiler Room provided an unique experience. Unfortunately if you're just in it for the food & drinks, I'd recommend elsewhere.

4086638,2014-05-28,0,_hML_SleB40KkUrMHOZ_-Q,"We went out of our way to come here for dinner based on the reviews. (It's way down the strip) We were in Las Vegas in over Valentine's Day/President's Day weekend. As a party of two on a Saturday night, we were in the minority, as most of the other tables were much larger groups. The big group in our section may have contributed to the problem, but I think a restaurant like this should be able to handle it.

Basically everything went wrong. First round of drinks took 20 minutes to come out, one of the more popular entrees wasn't available, our appetizer never came out, the kitchen gave one of our entrees to another table, and after all that, the registers went offline, so we couldn't use our card to pay. I ended up going into the casino to find an ATM to pay in cash.

Our waiter tried to make all of it up to us throughout dinner with a different appetizer on the house, a free round, and apologizing a lot. It wasn't his fault specifically and we were polite the whole time, but it was probably in the top five worst dinners I have had at a restaurant. The food and drinks that we did have were only mediocre to boot.",UIbP6C8oXsXhMbqIKuDyCw,4,1,1,kWQO3uorLbjsaGBQrmWBrw

Between our party we had a combination of the appetizer sampler for 2 (fish tacos, bacon wrapped bacon & eggs, chicken pot pie nuggets) all were good, the chicken pot pie nuggets were lacking something in flavor , maybe salt? For entrees we had the crispy fried game hen and shrimp and grits while the other half of our party ordered the niman skirt steak, again all were ok, nothing memorable with the exception of the bacon wrapped bacon & egg appetizer.   About midway through our meal, we finally received our sides ( that we had to ask about) of zucchini and mac and cheese.  The dessert options included freshly baked cookies and milk or trio of sorbets.  The cookies were good, again nothing I couldn't have baked in my own oven at home.  When our check came we were surprised to see all the extra fees we were not aware of: restaurant week charity donation as well as the appetizer upcharge.  I've been doing research on the restaurant week menus and never noticed an upcharge fee on the online menu, the physical menu nor were we told at the time of order, they also changed the price from the website from $40 to $50.

Then another significant wait for iced teas! They looked great but we couldn't eat them because we did not have plates. Our waiter walked by several times before we could flag him down. I started to eat using my left hand as the plate. Not exactly fine dining. We had to flag down again to get clean silverware after the appetizer and again after waiting 10 minutes for iced tea to be refilled. Come on guys- I had better service at fuckin chuck e cheese! 

The main course the fiancé had the Guinness beef, I ordered the scallops. When they came his looked like a meal and mine was 3 scallops on 1/8th cup of purée.

The inside wasn't very bright - it was slightly dark and atmospheric with just enough mood lighting. There was plenty of seating up front, at the bar, and back in the dining area. The booth we sat in was plush and comfortable. It even had velvet curtains we could draw back and enclose ourselves in. I flat out loved the interior and I loved the food/drinks even more. 

After being seated, our waiter, Bryce, came out to offer us water and tell us about the special of the evening. I had a few questions about the cocktails and Bryce was amazing. He was extremely knowledgeable and helped me narrow down my choices to two drinks. I told him I wanted to try the poutine and asked which cocktail went better with that dish. He told me the Poire Drakkar would pair nicely and it did. The drink was extremely unique and very tasty. It was spicy and aromatic and every sip was delicious. It was especially delicious after taking a bite of poutine. 

I am a huge fan of poutine and their take on poutine is what really drew me in. I really wanted to try the Duck Confit Poutine and I am so glad I did! The dish was large enough to share but I really didn't want to share. Instead of fries, it comes with house made tater tots topped with cheddar curds, crispy duck, and bordelaise sauce. The duck was extremely flavorful and delightfully crispy. The sauce was the perfect accompaniment and amount. Every bite was heaven.

We made a reservation for 745 pm, but due to a hair malfunction on my part, we were running about 10 minutes late. We called them to make sure they could still seat us and they said everything was all good. We finally get to the restaurant and it wasn't busy at all. Probably about 4 other parties there. What annoyed me was that even with the place being empty, they sat us at this small ass table right next to another couple. For reals??? I know you are trying to rotate server sections, but come on! Right next to someone?? The whole time I was listening to the other couple's convo too!! I could have asked for another table but I didn't want to be a b*atch about it. 

Ok time for food. Whenever they brought your dish to the table, they explained the dish so you know what was in it. It was a nice touch but I just didn't feel like hearing it since I was so hungry. 

Apps:
-Mini fish tacos: crispy taro shell with raw fish, salsa and a dab of guacamole. They were a one-bit taco. Good seasoning on the fish and the shell was crispy. 
-chips and guacamole: big, thin and crispy potato chips. I liked the chips a lot better than the guacamole. This was just ok.

Main dishes:
-Cornish game hen and waffles: two thin waffles held together by cheese. Sounds weird but it was really good with the honey glaze the dish was served with. The chicken was ok, but I wasn't fond of it being in the honey glaze. Chicken shouldn't be that sweet. 
-salmon and cous cous. The salmon was cooked to perfection. Flaky and moist and flavored nicely. The cous cous was amazing! Awesome seasoning and it came with pieces of octopus. 

Dessert:
Peach cobbler with ice cream: I would say pass on this. Ice cream melted quickly so it was this big goopy mess
-tiramisu with coffee ice cream: moist and not too sweet, just like tiramisu is supposed to taste.

Like I said I was pretty annoyed that they sat us right next to someone else so it just put a whole damper on my dinner to begin with. Our server was nice, but I used to serve back in the day and it just felt plastic. It took forever for our desserts to arrive, so by the time they did come, I was pretty restless and wanted to just leave. They do have a rewards program for locals where you can save 10% for every visit just by giving your email.

During our wedding weekend we made three different trips to this locations. The first night my groom and I went in for drinks and the bartenders were running around with their heads cut off and we didn't know how was serving us. Oddly enough, it was dead in there. Maybe three other people at the bar and two tables? We decided to go back for dinner only to be greeted rudely by the young hostess, who told us just to go to the bar. So we decided to eat elsewhere, seeing how we wanted to be seated for dinner.

The last trip, I told the very friendly bartenders my concerns about the hostess the night before. I wasn't looking for an apology, but based on the cocktails we had the first night, the location and style of this place, it should be packed. We got a few drinks, all amazing and grabbed a few small bites, poutine and Mac and cheese, even more amazing.  To my surprise the bartender wanted to redeem the hostess' bad manners and offered us a complementary dessert which were dry ice macaroons? They were an experience in themselves and one of the coolest things ever. Hard to describe. (Put it in your mouth, blow dry ice smoke out, and tastes like cotton candy.)

It's really a neato swanky kinda place, but also has a very approachable feel to it and I really like that quality. Rarely can a place be that nice while also being so inviting, and I think Rx Boiler Room pulls it off gracefully.

I was there last night and I ran into some friend who'd had some of the appetizers and they were raving about them so now I'm REALLY fascinated.

The Steam Punk/Jules Verne-esque decor has a feel that makes you wanna grab a glass of brandy, light an old pipe and listen to stories of the high seas. It's got a very comfortable feel and the people that work there are friendly and very professional.

But Rx Boiler Room came highly recommended so we decided to give it a shot.  The restaurant has an interesting steam-punky, New Orleans Voodoo lounge vibe to it.  As we walked up to the host stand a waiter was talking to the girls at the counter and he did this little goofy kind of dance step that I mimicked back to him that got a laugh out of all of them.  He told the hostess, ""Put these guys in my section.""  So we were off and running.

They have quite the interesting drink list that comes to you via an iPad.  Very cool to be able to see what each drink looks like before you order.  I went with the Poire Dakkar which consists of, Hennessy Black, Pimms #1 Liqueur, Curry-Pear Shrub, Honey Syrup, Lemon Juice, Baked Apple Bitters, Black Walnut Bitters, Black Pepper.  There must be some egg white in the mixture as well as the drink had this cool little foam cap on the top.  The drink was excellent.  Very refreshing and sweet.

For an appetizer we went with the bacon wrapped pork belly with quail egg.  What could be better than bacon wrapped bacon.  This was excellent.  The quail egg really seemed to cut through the saltiness of the bacon and give the bite a nice creamy texture.  For dinner I ordered the Chicken Parmigian and the wife chose the Guinness braised beef short rib.  I mistakenly assumed that the chicken parm would be breast meat as it is most times I've ordered but apparently chef Moonen likes to go with thigh meat.  Unfortunately I don't like dark meat so I was a bit dissapointed when the plate arrived.  But lucky for me my wife was willing to swap dishes with me so I ended up eating her short rib.  I had also ordered a side of mashed potatoes that sadly went to waste as the short rib came with mashed potatoes.

The short rib was very good but the wife wasn't too impressed with the chicken parm.

For dessert we decided to try the ice cream tasting game as it sounded like fun.  We got all of the flavors but one, Raspberry Mint.  C'mon man putting 2 flavors together in one is a bit of a cheat.  The funny thing is that my wife said that she tasted mint in that one.  I didn't get mint at all.

They were deslicious (and piping hot!) but could use some more filling. The dough was thick and too filling. I ended up opening the last 3 or so and scooping out the yummy pie filling.",8J5gkxtQPyZcG_JFzqgQUw,2,1,4,dcoIGFe2iL32PrDrcgDEPw

4588804,2017-08-15,0,_hML_SleB40KkUrMHOZ_-Q,"Came here for happy hour which is on weekdays between 4-7pm.

Environment: the restaurant has a cool apothecary-ish old American yet speak easy feel to it. The set up is very unique with the table seating pretty sporadically placed in rooms, a bar area, in addition to a lounge area. It looks like they can seat some large parties in some of the rooms, but it also makes a cool spot to meet up with a friend for some drinks after work.

Service: we were seated pretty quickly. Although we had to sit in the lounge for the happy hour deal, the waiters were great and really made sure we received our food and drinks quickly. The bartender was also really nice, he apologized to me for bringing out my drink a bit later because they needed to grab some ingredients. It wasn't a long wait, but I did appreciate their concern with making sure I have a good time.

Food and drinks: 
I had the Trinidad sour and my friends got the blue moos. All the drinks were delicious; strong and not too sweet. They were all easy to drink. 

As for entrees, I chose mostly from the happy hour deal. The pot pie nuggets were okay, it was a bit doughy like a donut. The guacamole comes with these large chips. They give you a good amount of guacamole and you can tell they used fresh avocados. The bacon wrapped bacon and egg is just the perfect bite. I would recommend it to everyone. It had a perfectly cooked egg on top of a bacon sitting on a soft yet toasty brioche. Yummy! 
I also ordered some off the main menu also. The duck pouting with tater tots is good as well especially with an egg on top. The tots are unique, it had more of a dark crust that was more of a potato ball. I also had a side of mac and cheese. Super delicious, they used a medallion shaped macaroons that was in warm melted cheese and baked to form the crust on top. Actually really delicious! 

Overall, I really enjoyed spending time with my friends here. It is a great spot to socialize and munch on small entrees. I would say the price is a bit expensive, but it is a restaurant on the strip.",6n3aU2lfldd5w4kP15OqpA,2,2,4,Vk1Rhz88fhb4ixfG5zUOvQ

4607805,2014-03-10,0,_hML_SleB40KkUrMHOZ_-Q,"Thoughts:

Nice decor.  Movies on the wall between the bar & main dining room a nice touch. Something to look at everywhere you looked.

Menu on website not the same as menu used in restaurant.  Would have ordered short ribs that were on website menu; however this entree was not on menu we were given in the restaurant.

SO frustrating when a restaurant is out of a menu item or they no longer carry something they list!  The shandy listed on the beer menu was no longer available and the server stated the kitchen had ran out of the chicken & waffles entree.  The beverage menu is on an iPad; it can't be that hard to take something off electronically.  As for an unavailable entree, the hostess should have said something when she handed us the menus, IMO.

Food quality was good.  Enjoyed the lamb osso buco very much.  Appreciated the extra chips with the guacamole.  Beware - guacamole is spicy.

The inside-out French onion grilled cheese was, literally, four bites of food.  Imagine one slice of bread cut in half; made into a half grilled cheese sandwich, then cut in half again.  The two sandwich pieces were served with a small bowl of some kind of dipping sauce; and no one explained what it was.

On this restaurant's website, the copy states that portions are ideal for a shared dining experience.  I disagree; portions were small.

Minor service issues; we didn't get small plates when appetizers were served; and could have used small plates for the vegetable side dish we ordered for the table.   Osso buco was served in a tagine and I used the under plate for my vegetables.  Busser was faster than the server when we needed anything.  

They serve Pepsi products; just the basics.  No Mountain Dew and no root beer.

Overall, just OK.  I would try The Boiler Room again, but I'd ask when I was seated if all menu items were available.",bvnu6ts51ICEPI0p3HMm8g,0,0,3,rCOuKM_MUUK4OWmbk-37Og

4669095,2013-07-09,0,_hML_SleB40KkUrMHOZ_-Q,"I was SUPER excited to check this place out when I saw the signs for a new restaurant in Mandalay Shoppes.  Rick Moonen's restaurants don't disappoint and I was fired up for something aside from fancy-shmans seafood.  This place has a VERY cool theme - I love the decor, LOVE LOVE the uniforms (each server wearing something unique), and the overall vibe.

Here's the breakdown:
The drinks were very inventive and although not every one we tried knocked our socks off, there were a few gems.
1/2 star for a cool drink menu

Food:
Chick pot pie nuggets 3.5/5 - there were great conceptually, but a little bland.
French Onion Dip Sandwich - 1/5 - the sandwich was very bland and oddly, needed salt or something simple to fix it.  I was hoping the au jus would do the trick,but even the au jus was bland. :(
Fried Oxtail - 2/5 - again, great concept...but unlike the french dip, this was SUPER salty.  Texture was great, but it was way too salty to enjoy.
Mac and Cheese - 7/5!! If nothing else, you MUST go here for the mac and cheese.  Really delicious - crunchy on top, perfect creaminess, perfect texture.  YUM.
1/2 star for the Mac and Cheese alone, 1/2 for the creativity of the menu.

Service:
Adorable hostesses, great outfits.
The server was...well, um...not amazing.  We ordered drinks and some appies, and the appies arrived BEFORE our drinks.  ...What?  Then, during the first round, she asked if we wanted to order anything else, we said - we're good for a few minutes...and then she took the menus.  ...What?  We were a group of 4 people and had only order two appies thus far.  Weird.
So, after a few minutes, we get another menu and again order drinks and more appies...and AGAIN, the food came first.  SO very odd.
The saving grace was that the ""apprentice"" who served our water was FAB.  We got all our food and drink recommendations from her and would probably go back just because she was so good.
1/2 star for the service - thanks to the ""apprentice.""

One Fun Surprise:
Rick Moonen stopped by our table to ask how everything was.  That is awesome.  The guy has a whole host of restaurants in Vegas, so I love that personal touch...of course, it was the second day they were open, so it makes sense.  Still, I love that he took the time to make that impact.
1 Star for Rick Moonen.

Overall:
This is a new restaurant - they're clearly still working out the kinks.  I'd go back on a date or something if I was in the area.  I'd like to give this place 6 months to figure things out and then try again - or at the least, grab appies upstairs and do dinner at RM Seafood downstairs.",ABrS2sgtZA1hSH3YTmNFPA,9,0,3,Zh9pvHHcdBtIAKHFXoB0Yg

Duck Confit Poutine w/ Local Egg ($18): Moonen tater tots, cheddar cheese curds, and bordelaise. The tots were great by themselves and I really liked the duck confit. There was not nearly enough curds though. Not the most impressive poutine, but a good ""loaded fries"" dish.

As for the drinks, let me tell you I met a true artist.  Ngoc behind the bar was one gifted mixologist (her martini stencils on her nails should have been a giveaway) who knows her stuff.  I told her that I wasted a gin martini but wasn't quite in the mood for my go-to Bombay Sapphire and she whipped up one humdinger of a Fords 'tini for me that was scrumptious. 

Dinner didn't disappoint either.

So-so. Not eager to come back.

Excited to be dining at Rick Moonen's restaurant,  we made a reservation for 8:30 on 10/21/15. We were seated promptly but had to wait a while for a waiter - who didn't even introduce himself - to show up.  
I was curious about the cocktails and had a few questions but the waiter doesn't have an in depth knowledge on them. Husband ordered a Hard Root Beer and liked it.

Started with Bacon Wrapped Quail Egg ($12). Love the overall taste, but didn't like the hard brioche toast.
Both Lamb Shank ($34) and Braised Short Ribs ($38) are excellent when they were hot, but the Shank gets dry as it cools and the risotto gets watery. The Mashed potatoes  ($8) is simply divine. A saving grace - It is smooth and creamy. Shallots and capers provided extra texture.

Lastly, when we ordered the steak to be medium rare plus the waitress asked how we wanted that cooked. And I said we want it cooked medium rare plus... which she proceeded to ask us to describe the amount of red/pink we were going for. I told her the chef should know what medium rare plus is and she continued on saying the chefs want to know what that entailed.

Decor: B+
Steampunk deluxe. Well done - lots of velvet, copper, etc. So....the female servers have to wear fairly elaborate get ups that include bondage-y leather belts with 590 buckles but the dudes wear pants & a vest? In the spirit of fairness, can we get them crazy codpieces like the dude in the Cameo video or something?

Menu: B
About half shareable small plates and 1/2 entrees. Reasonable (for Vegas) prices. They would call it ""modern comfort food"" and I would call it ""trying a little too hard"". 

Presentation: A
Everything is beautifully plated & presented. Lots of care taken to make sure the good is visually appealing. 

Actual Food Taste: C-
I tried 6 of the small plates and they ranged from ""pretty good"" to ""meh"". The best thing was the chicken pot pie bites, followed by the tuna tacos (FYI, basically a Tostito made in to a ""taco shell""). On the lighter side, the asparagus was amazing but the poached egg really didn't add anything. The Brussels sprouts were pretty ""meh"" - undercooked for the most part. 

Service: D+
Our server was nice but things took forever - unacceptable considering they were about 15% full. A glass of wine took 15-20 minutes to reach the table & we weren't checked back on for refills.

Drinks: C
So they have this elaborate cocktail cart where they make you drinks table side (cocktails only). So one of our group ordered one & it was quite a show...droppers if this & that, lots of mixing & shaking. Unfortunately the drink tasted like that violet chewing gum. 

Overall: C

5022998,2013-07-30,1,_hML_SleB40KkUrMHOZ_-Q,"Rx Boiler Room was high on the fiancée and my list to try while in Vegas.  We'd previously dined with my parents at RM Seafood and had a very memorable meal in the upstairs fine dining space that Rx Boiler Room replaced.  We'd also previously sampled craft cocktails conceived by Nathan Greene, Rx Boiler Room's lead bartender, when he was behind the bar at Vanguard Lounge.  Needless to say, we had high expectations for the food and drink in their new setting.  

We arrived right when the doors opened since we had tickets to the 7:30 Zumanity show, but wanted to have a light dinner beforehand.  We were met by one of the friendly,  attractive, young, corset-wearing hostesses who guided us to the lounge after stating our preference to sit at the bar.  Much has already been written about the steampunk aesthetic of the place, let me just say I get it and enjoyed the casual and whimsical approach it takes with regards to its food and drink.  If anything, it also means plenty of corset-wearing hostesses, servers and bartenders.  

We started off with drinks.  I had the Smoked Whiskey and Coke.  I liked the use of visually appealing, cleverly repurposed use of an empty Crystal Skull vodka bottle to be the vessel for smoking the George Dickel whiskey.  The Dickel picked up the cherry wood smoke, but was not overpowered by it.  The smoked whiskey was nicely balanced with the not overly sweet house made cola.  It was my kind of whiskey drink!  We split orders of the Braised Oxtail Croquettes Dijonnaise ($9), Rx Fish Tacos in Taro Root Shells ($12), and the Shellfish Shepherd's Pie ($30).  Croquettes were perfectly fried to a golden brown without a hint of greasiness.  The braised oxtail inside was rich, meaty, and savory.  Although they were served with a tasty lemon aioli, they truly didn't need any additional adornment.  Given Chef Moonen's expertise with sustainable seafood, it was a no-brainer for us to have something from the sea.  Three taro root taco shells were filled with a noticeably fresh Kampachi tartare garnished with grapefruit.  While the tacos were a delicious appetizer, they were fairly small.  The Shepherd's Pie was a much more appealing, aquatic spin on a classic dish, containing a generous amount of exceedingly fresh sea scallops, King crab, shrimp and topped with chive whipped potatoes.  Every spoonful scooped from beneath the relatively thin layer of potatoes came up filled with perfectly cooked shellfish.  

Our experience was made complete when Chef Moonen stopped by to ask how we were enjoying our meal.  In any restaurant, especially one from a celebrity chef, it's always good to know that the chef is actually in the house.  Chef Moonen was a gracious host and his passion for what he does shines through in the outstanding food and drink.  Rx Boiler Room is a worthy successor to the great restaurant it replaced.  It's not a cheap night out, but I felt we got what we paid for.  4.5 stars.",le3Xn9Mheb1hNxWurF7RSw,6,2,5,2xM_OVDZNC8p0UURlKYVRA

Inside Out French Onion Grilled Cheese - pretty much same as above. I wasn't thrilled but enjoyed it. 3.5/5

Bacon Wrapped Bacon & Egg - awesome!!!... my favorite plate of night. Got this off server recommendation and it did not disappoint. Very cool presentation... server recommended doing in one bite but was a little big to do that.. tried.. and failed. LOL Still a fun dish and would order again and again. 5/5

 Buffalo Burger - maybe it's me & my untrained palette but I did not like this at all. Probably the wrong thing to order looking back. Should have read the menu more. The flavors didn't go well for me and I ended up throwing half of this away. I'm sure there are people that love this but for me... meh. 1/5

18 Hour Citrus Braised Veal Cheeks - really, really tasty. Great flavor & cooked perfect. Worth $34? That can be debated... I don't have anything to base that price off of. Never ordered Braised Veal Cheeks before... would have like to see more meat at that price though. 4.5/5

Cookies & Milk - ummmm... it's hard to go wrong when you are serving fresh, hot cookies. The chocolate chip were delicious but could have used few more chocolate chips. Outside of that it was great. 4.5/5

To be clear, I'm not a fan of the Disneyesque décor which makes you the thing that looks out of place.

The Boiler Room is a craft cocktail lounge meaning, it's not the beer, neat scotch, or wine kind of place.  Complex, new creations and reinvented, turn of the century cocktails containing multiple liquors, house made infusions, and oils dominate the unique drink offerings.   Tried a few, won't go into them individually, suffice it to say, they are excellent.   It's like drinking a dish.  You can taste the evolving flavor on the palate even after the sip is long gone.  Impressive.

The food hit the mark.  The ""Bacon Wrapped Bacon-N-Egg"", quirky, difficult to eat but once you stuff it in your mouth, it's like breakfast in a big bite.  Sitting on a piece of toasted brioche is a bacon wraps a cube of pork belly topped with a fried quail egg, tomato jam and guacamole.

The shrimp corndogs, not bad.  Sweet corndog batter coating slightly over cooked jumbo shrimp topped with a vibrant cilantro aioli.  Good flavor, a little excessive on the aioli that leaves a greasy feel in the mouth.

The smoked gravlax are excellent.  Cucumbers, fresh dill, red onion and pieces of gravlax (cured salmon) are placed in a dish with a dome filled with hardwood smoke.  Sensory dining as the smoke tickles your nose before you taste the mild bitterness it has imparted throughout the entire dish.  Excellent texture, just plain fun.

Finally, ""Squid-E-Os with Spicy Merguez Meatballs"".  A surprise from a disturbing sounding dish.  Tender cooked squid rings sit atop a squid ink / tomato sauce whose oceanic flavor is counter balanced by spicy, earthy meat balls.  It works and is good eats.

Servers are well trained and friendly.  No problems when describing the unusual offerings.

Keep an open mind.  Experiment.  Well worth a visit.",oeAhRa8yFa9jtrhaHnOyxQ,28,22,4,mn8DCXeDj92iwLWWMKNVTQ

I can't believe I had not noticed this place and I visit Mandalay Bay Shoppes often.

The drinks are quite impressive and expensive about $13-$22 a drink, I feel its justified based on the location and what goes into making it.  
For example, I got the Smoked Whiskey & Cola consists of a double shot of 12 year aged George Dickel Tennessee Whiskey, house made cola and vanilla bitters. Tastes a 1000x better than any Jack & Coke I've tried and packs a wallop of a punch after only drinking two glasses. 

The food is equally pretty delicious, the Duck Comfit, tater tots Poutine and the Four Cheese Mac I can eat that all day.
The inside decor is very victorian-esqe and steam punk it provides a casual, cozy, relaxing atmosphere.

The service was outstanding, I chatted with Cory one of the bartenders working that night. He's a very friendly and knowledgeable guy. In fact, I tested his skills by asking him if he could make me a custom drink based on a recent episode of Jimmy Fallon The Tonight Show. It involved tequila, jalapenos, orange bitters and syrup. Not only did he make it, but he improvised and made it taste better. I appreciated him for doing that and it solidified the experience, so I'll definitely recommend this place to my friends.",bLExVDNKxXMjjZcx3YG36Q,1,2,5,w-QB7qbywKicff7oP438ew

Let me start off saying that the food was not BAD.  It just was not notable in MY eyes, and it felt EXPENSIVE.  And I didn't even pick up the tab this time!

First example, Moonen Tater Tots ($9).  Overpriced for the portion size...I think there were 9 or 10 tater tots in there??  That is about $1 a tater tot...and no, it's not drenched in truffle oil or accompanied by a fancy aioli.  The taste was just ok...not very memorable.

Braised Oxtail Croquettes Dijionnaise ($12). Looks like a mozzarella stick, but it's filled with oxtail and potato. It was good, just not liking my ""bang for the buck"" here.  

Chicken Pot Pie Nuggets ($11): Natural Jus with Peas and Carrots. These were interesting...good, different, but not great.  I want something to stand out!!  We aren't eating at Applebees...or spending Applebees money.

Johnny's Dry Aged Burger ($18). I asked for double portion of Truffle Cheese, but it was NOT very truffle like and tasted DRY like a goat's cheese/brie...which I don't like at all. Sad, because it ruined my burger.  Maybe if I had only one cheese, it would have been more tolerable, just don't compare this to Todd English's Olives Truffle Cheese Burger for instance...not the same burger or cheese...not even the same ballpark.

The desserts were good, Pie Americana ($9): Apple Compote. Puff Pastry, Vanilla Ice Cream and Walnuts. Fancy apple pie, good flavor here...and the Mahalo Matcha Panna Cotta ($10): Green Tea Panna Cotta, Macadamia Nut Tuile, and Passion Fruit Sorbet. Good combination of flavors, but again, nothing really stood OUT to me, and it still felt a little overpriced.

Seems like I am the minority here...everyone else seems to like this place.  But I have no reason why I would go back and spend the cheddar.

2) if you sit in the dining room and are a couple, do NOT sit in a booth - they're tiny, and neither of us is overweight.
3) The fondue was good, but the presentation was low class
4) we tried to drink more, but had the least attentive and slowest waiter in the world (and no it wasn't busy)
5) our fondue was only half done before our entres arrived
6) the chef is known for seafood.  I ordered a salad and added shrimp to it.  The shrimp was literally defrosted from a supermarket bag of pre-cooked shrimp and added on my salad
7)the chef is known for seafood, so my boyfriend ordered the lobster pot pie special for $65.   There was less than a tail in there - it should have been called the undercooked potato pie with a hint of lobster

Menu creativity and execution made our visit a very great experience. Also, they present the menu on an iPad - ohhhhhh schmancyyyyy! We didn't get a chance to order any food but the drinks were pretty darn expensive. Of course it was expected, it's Vegas. I will say this - I rather pay $15 for these delicious little concoctions rather than $15 for a RedBull/Vodka at the club.

The atmosphere alone makes this place worth checking. It has a steam punk sort of theme throughout, and the waitress and hostess attire compliments the decor very well. It is a very inviting style that doesn't make you feel overwhelmed and compliments both the casual and fancy patrons. 

You can review all their cocktails, beers and wines on the ipad they give when you go in which gives you info on ingredients, origin, proof, etc. I could have easily spent two hours in this place just looking through all the different cocktails they make.

We made an online reservation via OpenTable and had no issues with seating or adding another person a couple hours before our Saturday reservation at 7pm. We were seated in the front of their restaurant at a very large table. Each of the chairs were unique, padded and dramatic. 

The menu situation was a bit weird as you look at drinks on an iPad, but don't order from them and then dinner is on a regular paper menu. Maybe this is a new technology they are working in but not quite done with yet? Drinks all sounded very interesting, they even have a ""Potion Cart"" as I have deemed it, where a woman will come to your table and create a concoction of your choosing in front of you. The drinks all included specific bitters and ingredients, that in my opinion didn't drink well. 

The food items were all very interesting takes on comfort food items like chicken pot pie bites or inside out french onion grilled cheese. Again, in my opinion, I felt each of these missed the mark. Whether it was missing an item or overly greasy. As to be expected, items were also expensive and small.

We arrived to find an almost empty restaurant at 9 PM on a friday night - a telltale sign - but I was excited to check out this steampunk-themed restaurant that I long to visit. I noticed that the place has a few gear motifs here and there and a few really cool and exotic sculptures. Besides that, it was just an open space with tables and chairs. Already, I felt disappointed. 

But the real disappointment came when our food arrived. There were four of us and we ordered the bacon wrapped bacon and egg, oxtail sticks, chicken pot pie nuggets, cheese charcuterie, mac n cheese and potato fries. Our whole party liked the oxtail and the bacon wrapped bacon n egg but we could not get over the fact that these mediocre items were costing us almost 5 times the costs if we were to get these items elsewhere. 

I don't feel right paying $9 for a bucket of fries that tasted exactly like fries at McDonalds. Or paying $14 for a tiny bowl of mediocre mac n cheese. 

If only their drinks were better to make up for the terrible eating experience but that would be asking too much of the Rx Boiler Room, as I ordered the Some like it hot cocktail and was terribly disappointed at this drink as well.

In a city built on risks, renovation, and occasionally ripping things down if only to rebuild it was to the nearly year-old Rx Boiler Room that myself and two friends turned for dinner on Saturday night and although widely acclaimed for its modernized mashup of comfort food and mixology our experience at Rick Moonen's rebranded former fine dining space proved a mixed one at best.  Self described as ""Steampunk"" with clever details such as a wall of poisons and potions juxtaposing dark woods, gears, and gloss as an alt-indie soundtrack played overhead it was just minutes after our 7:00pm reservation that we arrived at the shopping center space and quickly led to a table at the back it would not be long before the first of two servers arrived, the duo sharing a penchant for eavesdropping and interruption with shaky pacing and presentations equally prevalent throughout the night.  Obviously targeting a younger demographic than Moonen's stronghold of sustainable seafood downstairs it was in no shortage of creative cocktails to pair with the menu's imaginative bites that our decision process progressed and with friends browsing the Ipad for a quartet of $15 drinks while I curated the course of cuisine the meal that followed could best be described as ""clever"" - the drinks trending towards sweet while plates overall proved tasty despite being overcomplicated without any true benefit from the excess technique.  Starting with a trio of sharables before progressing to things more substantial it was with disappointing cured meats alongside the restaurant's pot pie nuggets and signature bacon n' eggs that our dining began and although both of the later would prove amusing, if not particularly great, the stars of the show would only arrive next - the rings of squid tender with a tinge of acid amidst spicy meatballs while the fowl featured impeccably crisp skin over roasted, juicy flesh.  Not particularly enthralled by the selection of sweets but wanting to give the pastry kitchen a fair shake it was finally in two American classics that we partook and with the deconstructed pie entirely underwhelming while the cookies would have taken actual effort to botch the bill was simply dropped off - the first time of the evening that our server was without an offhand or clever remark, though perhaps an appropriate pairing to the decidedly dull desserts.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,6,1,3,wXVeJ7bxJbNnc4_-g-kwOQ

5312927,2017-04-08,31,_hML_SleB40KkUrMHOZ_-Q,"We opted to stay another day on a recent trip to Vegas, and we chose a room at the Luxor - which was a mistake.  It has really gotten run-down, but on the upside we got to experience a couple of restaurants in this immediate area that we may not have tried in the past when staying at our more posh hotels.

Rx Boiler Room was born from Rick Moonen, a Vegas legend and CIA graduate who created the much hyped RM Seafood at Mandalay.  With him behind this place, we had to give it a try.

It was late at night and we just wanted to sit at the bar and have a drink and maybe an appetizer or two.  We ordered the ""Chicken Pot Pie Nuggets"" based on reviews.  Although it's a great idea, we found they lacked overall seasoning.  A little more salt and they would have been perfect.

We also ordered the ""Bacon Wrapped Bacon-N-Egg"" which is a mind-blowing treat.  Just get it!  It not only looked amazing but tasted amazing.  I could eat this stuff all day.

Normally I would deduct a star for the seasoning on the first appetizer, but what truly elevated this place to 5-star status was one particular bartender:  Corbin.  Our initial female bartender (sorry, can't remember her name) had a very lackluster demeanor.

We would have normally just had one drink and left, but once Corbin (who looks and reminds me of the actor Chris Pratt from Guardians of the Galaxy) replaced her we were treated to a well, ""tour-de-force"" of enthusiasm and dedication to the craft.  He made the best Old Fashioned I had ever had and also gave me a couple of free sips of other bourbons.  His knowledge and love of whiskey and their accoutrements (bitters, etc) was fantastic and sheer  entertainment.  All other bartenders should take a class from him.

Next time we are in Vegas we'll make a pit-stop to Rx Boiler Room to try more food and definitely more drink ;)",07gdGKMkho4maba0lQyoQQ,31,27,5,-ptLdcvK0-JFnuD87nqYTQ

5319895,2013-08-22,4,_hML_SleB40KkUrMHOZ_-Q,"So, Rick Moonen decided to get rid of RM Seafood's 2nd floor and turn that space to Rx Boiler Room - a gastropub version of RM so it's a totally different vibe.  Dimly lit, velvety seats and curtains, leatherette tables and servers strutting in corsets. Rick Moonen going to our table and chatting with us.

There's one menu item I didn't fall in love with from RM and that's his lobster roll and I was surprised to see it on Rx's menu - I stayed away from that. They have an interesting drink menu but I can't really remember the drink names because they're soooo long like the Mario (something) Wrong Warp (something).  I wanted to try it but my attention span went out the door upon reading the name. 

We tried chicken pot pie nuggets, inside out French onion grilled cheese, bacon-wrapped bacon n egg, braised oxtail croquettes Dijonnaise, Moonen tater tots, Johnny's big dry-aged burger.  For dessert, we had the matcha panna cotta and the pie Americana.

Chicken Pot Pie Nuggets:
Fried pot pie balls with carrots, peas, chicken bits and a bit of soup inside.  It's like the Western version (fried and fatty) of xiaolongbao (Chinese steamed soup dumplings). Great idea but the nuggets could use a bit more soup in them. 3/5

Inside Out French Onion Grilled Cheese:
Provolone, parmesan and gruyere in the crispy sammie sliced diagonally topped with pickles and served with a warm, slightly onion-y beefstock dip. French onion soup meets grilled cheese, basically. 4/5

Bacon-Wrapped Bacon n Egg:
Toasted brioche with tomato jam, thick piece of bacon topped with a sunny side up quail egg, sprinkled with black sesame and chives with pea mousse on the side. My favorite dish of the evening...and quite possibly of any of Rick Moonen's creative ideas thus far.  I'm not even a fan of runny egg yolks...or egg yolks, period! But I imagined how they painstakingly cracked each tiny quail egg and fried them - I appreciate the patience that went into making this lovely dish. You got textures (crunchy, fatty, creamy) and flavors that compliment each other. There were 3 of us and a baby at the table and I ate 2 out of 3 (sorry, unfortunate person who didn't get to try one. You snooze, you lose). I had to do it. 5/5

Braised Oxtail Croquettes Dijonnaise:
As the name implies...Dijon + mayonnaise = Dijonnaise. Two of my least favorite things combined to create something that actually wasn't bad. The croquettes were more like fried mozzarella sticks in appearance but had savory and mildly sweet oxtail.  Dip it in lemon aioli...oh my! 5/5

Moonen Tater Tots and Johnny's Big Dry-Aged Burger:
Shawn got a medium rare burger (what a shocker!) with double the truffle cheese so I got tater tots (comes with ketchup and tartar sauce) to go with it. The tots tasted better dipped in tartar sauce. The burger was very messy to eat.  It has pickles, lettuce, tomato jam, Balsamic onions and your choice of cheese from the cheese plate (truffle, fontina, brie, cheddar or bleu). The cheese that was added onto the burger didn't taste truffle-y at all and was more like brie...double brie isn't that good. 3/5

Mahalo Matcha Panna Cotta:
Matcha green tea panna cotta in a generous serving topped with macadamia nut tuile, li-hung mui pineapples and passionfruit sorbet. Loved this dessert an it was worth skipping the gym for. Creamy mild green tea panna cotta and tart passionfruit sorbet. 5/5

Pie Americana:
Classic apple pie re-imagined served with vanilla ice cream and walnuts. 4/5

These are your basic comfort food items. Anyone knows how to make these dishes and most restaurants have them.  But what's brilliant is reinventing the same dishes and making them seem interesting. I'm still hoping they could re-invent their lobster rolls though.  Service was good although there was some sort of confusion...with the complimentary bread which we didn't get.",tH0uKD-vNwMoEc3Xk3Cbdg,8,7,4,GonwgBJ1B9AvSWbkr9V8GA
5327564,2017-05-06,1,_hML_SleB40KkUrMHOZ_-Q,"This was our first time dining here, and it definitely wasn't the best experience. First off we are locals, so when you dine on the strip you expect a certain quality of service. That's why there is so much competition among restaurants in Vegas. 

The first thing that we disliked is even though we made a reservation, they sat us in the bar area. It was crowded, loud, and not very intimate for date night when they have an entire secluded dining area in the back. I guess we weren't special enough for that.

We had no complaints about the food. We had a three course meal, including the poutine, rigatoni, scallops, and the tasting game for dessert and all was very good.

The worst part of our experience was the service. It took about 10 minutes for our waiter to come over to our table initially, and his lack of attentiveness the whole night was a bummer. We ran out of water, I asked for more and he never filled up. I finished my glass of wine and he never offered me another. With their wine averaging about $15 a glass you would think they would want to push to sell multiple glasses. Same thing with my husband's coke. We ordered a side of Brussel sprouts that never came. 

I think if we had a better waiter I could give this place a solid 4 stars. We might try this place again but definitely with someone else serving us.",KcgEGB9RX6ZJssFEVuZPow,2,1,3,nGjsmW6Wc3Klytp6KWr24w
5360607,2014-04-12,0,_hML_SleB40KkUrMHOZ_-Q,"I'm all for celebrity chef restaurants, and I gotta say, this one clearly showed the potential of ""drop my jaw"" awe! Sadly, this wasn't the case. We tried our best to ""fall in love"" with it, but their menu fell short of our expectations. At best, their appetizers and desserts were ""off-the-charts"" rocking it with taste and presentation. You must, must, MUST try the bacon-wrapped bacon n eggs! Everything tastes better with bacon, so how about a pork belly wrapped in bacon with a sunny-side quail egg to top it off? Excellent! For dessert, their Pie Americana, deconstructed apple pie made of fresh apple compote, with a puff pastry on the side, vanilla ice cream, and walnuts, was an absolute favorite! I think, by far, it's the best apple pie I've had in a while!

Now for the hard part, reviews on their entrees. We had the Farm Raised Barramundi and the Pan Fried Game Hen & Waffles, a play on ""chicken n waffles."" The fish was just ""okay,"" maybe because I'm not used to ""farm-raised"" fish of recent. But the green beans almandine with lemon brown butter made up for the lack of fresh taste from the fish. See? Our effort to ""fall in love"" with it... As for the game hen, wow! It really lacked some sort of seasoning...it needed salt, really. There was no taste. And their waffles were inconsistent, one waffle piece had more taste to it than the other piece. That was strange.

Of course, the best part was their impeccable service. I loved their staff who patiently helped us. We were with our two children, not a typical family joint, so yes, we felt a little unnerved not wanting to disrupt the non-family patrons' dining experience along the way. The staff made us feel sooo welcome, waiting on us and our every need, and always concerning themselves with making sure we had a pleasurable dining experience with them.

I always say that service trumps menu, this being the case at Rx Boiler Room. To the staff, THANK YOU. We love Rick Moonen's advocacy for sustainability in his culinary world of seafood. With that said, we're hoping this passion he has will run deep into oiling the cogs and gears of his comfort food menu here at the Boiler Room. We will definitely be coming back.",xozBOvi6cWO_p1OdteF9zw,1,1,3,JeitPKD6bR-9R2er6zF5Lg
5374136,2013-09-09,2,_hML_SleB40KkUrMHOZ_-Q,"How have I not written my review for this place? My bad. I have been here twice. It was a hit and miss situation. The first time was much better than the second. The first time was with a large group of friends around the grand opening. Th second time was for Restaurant Week. 

With the former, it was a group of eight starting off with cocktails at the bar. The attention to service was what impressed me the most. When we were all present, the hostess came to get us and carried out drinks on trays. It was a nice touch. I am more than capable of carrying my drink from the bar to my table, but it was appreciated. 

The food was spectacular minus a few glitches such as the all kale caesar being dominated by romaine. The second time, they rectified that problem. With the party of eight, we pretty much tried everything. The steak and tator tots, oxtail croquettes, chicken pot pie nuggets, osso bucco with orzo were my favorite items. The fried game hen with their locally sourced organic honey was delicious, too. Everything was enjoyable from start to finish.

The second time was a little more chaotic. The food came out lukewarm to cool on some of the items. We were all hungry, so we let it slide. The appetizer for two could have used a little more substance. It was not enough compared to the larger salads. The entrees were definitely generous. I was stuffed at this point. Once the desserts came around I was done for. The fresh baked cookies with milk was ridiculous in sheer volume. The three granita dessert was nice, but lacked a cohesiveness. Almond and coffee made sense. Almond and watermelon was not bad. Yet trying to figure out how coffee and watermelon worked one after the other didn't pan out. 

The beverage program here is solid and I enjoyed the concoctions they put out. They have added to their list since the first time. I would definitely go back again.",N3oNEwh0qgPqPP3Em6wJXw,8,4,4,0uXBFmmNdMkFfjZP25FfhA

So I have been to the Rx Boiler Room twice. The first time was with a large group of friends right around when it had just opened. We met Rick Moonen and his wife and tried almost everything on the menu. Had great service and great food. The place was hopping too. The steampunk theme is really cool, you want to just hang out. and have some weird cocktails. 4 STAR experience.
The second time, we had family in town and thought it'd be a fun place to take them. It was a Friday night around 7 and the place was surprisingly dead but the music was really loud, so don't expect to hold a decent conversation here. I tried to order one of their specialty drinks but were out of one of the ingredients...BOO! We ordered some apps and large plates. The thing I was most excited about getting again were the Chicken Pot Pie Nuggets. They were good, but something was different, I think it's the outside coating, they just didn't make me crave them again like they did the first time. We ate all of our food, it was good,...but just not as good as that first time. The service was so-so. 3 STAR experience. I'd tell you what we got and tell you how it was but I don't feel like it's worth my time or yours.
If you have to go, get a drink and maybe one app, snap some pictures. Then get out of there, Mandalay Bay is full of better places to eat.

Drinks: alluringly novel, but pretty weak.

5529750,2013-07-20,12,_hML_SleB40KkUrMHOZ_-Q,"Seems like pubs done by celebrity chefs are all the rage now.  I think it was a smart idea by Rick Moonen to change the upstairs of RM Seafood to this.  It's a really cool space with interesting furniture and displays.  I have no idea what steampunk is though.  I can only imagine Joey Ramone in a sauna.  

We chose to sit at the bar to chat it up with the bartenders and get their opinions on drinks etc.  It was also a treat to see them make some of these concoctions.  I know quite a few Yelpers that love the whiskey and this should be a spot to check out.  I will definitely try the smoked whiskey next time.  Check out some of the other people's pics.  

My wife wasn't into any of the specialty cocktails and opted for the appletini (ha fn ha).  But they used actual apple instead of that Pucker BS so it tasted as legit as an appletini could.  I went with some long titled cocktail called ""Mario Warped the something something"" which featured egg white, tequila and thyme.  It tasted like a margarita made by a mad scientist.  I also had a bottle of an Austrian lemon beer I'd never had before which was super refreshing.  

The chicken liver pate was just OK.  One of the bartenders tried to build up the fact that the pate was ""like in this totally cool jar"".  That'd be interesting if Thomas Keller hadn't already been doing that up the street at Bouchon since they opened.  I prefer duck liver pate any day of the week.  I'd skip this.  

Interesting idea with the inside out French onion grilled cheese but I feel like it totally missed the mark on both ends.  I'd rather have an excellent grilled cheese sandwich or a robust and cheesy French onion soup than this combo.  This is a skip too.

We both really liked the Lamb Osso Bucco Greek style.  Two gloriously tender shanks of lamb with orzo on the bottom that was swimming in the lamb juice.  Anthony M's picture of it is way better than mine.

Shockingly the best thing we had was dessert.  2 of the bartenders kept raving and raving about the green tea panna cotta with pineapple and macadamia nut cookie. It was definitely all that.     

I am rounding up on Rx Boiler Room.  It was more like 3.683712 stars but I think some of the dishes we passed on this first go around will be things I look forward to trying soon.

5601714,2013-11-19,1,_hML_SleB40KkUrMHOZ_-Q,"Actual rating 4.5. Venue and cocktails bump up the rating.

For a Saturday evening the No1DP and I wanted to do a ""dinner and show"" date Vegas style. For us, this meant either fine dining or upscale casual with a named chef. He already booked the show way in advance and left me in charge of planning dinner. As the show we were going to was a fun show in New York-New York, I didn't want to go anywhere too extravagant. 

VENUE
1) Chef Rick Moonen is well known for his seafood restaurant ""rm seafood"" in the lower level. This is his take on comfort food in large and small plates made to be shared.
2) Restaurant is decorated in Victorian period steampunk-style. Prominent features are that the women are dressed in bustiers, which the No1DP noted to be different for each waitress. This was confirmed, letting the waitress express herself while conforming to dress code. Furniture pieces were appropriate to the time. Sofa was comfy.
3) A cocktail program managed by the talented Eric Smith, who kinda looks like the current Doctor with glasses.

SERVICE: Staff took care of us. Waiters attended to us, bussers served our food and I had a little chat with Eric himself. 

DRINKS: Cocktail menu is served on an iPad. No1DP noticed that you can e-mail your orders. I hope he used this feature for the wines as I am having a total brain fart for not remembering the exact wines we had. I tend to do this for restaurants with notable cocktail menus as I tend to pay attention to the cocktails more :/

No1DP got the Smoked Whiskey and Cola ($15). The whiskey is smoked to order with cherrywood chips. The cola is a housemade concoction with various spices as to not make the coke too sweet and enhance the smokiness of the whiskey. No1DP never had anything like this before and enjoyed his drink.

I got the Mario Took the Wrong Pipe ($14). I actually had a talk with Eric about this particular drink. Caipirinhas are one of my most favorite cocktails and I was impressed on his method of using cachaça - mixing it with curaçao, egg whites and extra virgin olive oil to make the drink a lot more smooth than the caipirinha and still have that burst of citrus each sip. Finally cachaça is used in a cocktail other than a caipirinha!

For our dishes No1DP got an oaked Chardonnay and I got a Cabernet. Wine parings were sufficient, the tannins went well with our quite savory dishes. 

FOOD
Rx Fish Tacos in Taro Root Shells ($12): The kampachi is done as a ceviche and the ""taco"" shell is delicate enough that the taco could fall apart mid-bite and the fish flavors and textures can shine through.

Lamb Osso Bucco Greek Style ($28): I've had veal osso bucco in the traditional Italian style and I like this interpretation better. The lamb is braised so that the meat is tender and falls off the bone. The meat is covered in its own juices and the orzo soaks these juices nicely. There were two pieces of lamb cut perfectly for sharing. 

Lobster Bolognaise ($38): Pasta was perciatelli. Lobster and pasta were also prepared to be shared. I could still taste the lobster even with the bolognaise sauce. No1DP notes that the pasta was just a tad too chewy.

Moonen Tater Tots ($9): Big tater tots that were crisp on the outside and soft on the inside. Potatoes were not greasy. Decent, but might pick another side next time.

Cookies & Milk ($9): Made to order chocolate chip and peanut butter cookies. Milk poured nicely as it had a higher cream content. Outside was crisp so cookie didn't fall apart but center was moist and chewy. Cookies were rich yet lost some of its richness and moistness the next day.

The No1DP and I had such a great time that we ended up being a little late to our show. We noticed that the restaurant was empty for a Saturday night and hope that this restaurant will still exist the following year. The cocktails bridge the gap between the comfort food and the Victorian steampunk theme; while the cocktails can survive without the restaurant, the restaurant cannot survive without the cocktails. If the restaurant does close I hope that Eric's cocktails can survive in some other form.",7gNtYzygF7dB8e7k1mWdjA,8,4,5,pdwqurLdr7_-BwD3eufEPg
5626290,2014-10-04,2,_hML_SleB40KkUrMHOZ_-Q,"My friends and I had a poor first experience at Rx Boiler Room last night. We arrived around 10:15pm looking for dinner. The restaurant was mostly empty except for a couple of bar patrons, 2 or 3 four tops and a party of 12 (or so) in the back. 

We were a party of 7, and it took the hostess a few minutes to figure out where to seat us.  The table selected needed to he cleaned so we waited a few minutes for that to happen. This was the first of several red flags for the night as it was over 5 minutes for the staff to clean and set the table 

After seating we ordered a round of drinks, water and some appetizers. The drinks arrived in 10 minutes, apps arrived in 15 minutes, and the waiter came around to get out dinner drink order. 

We had to ask for appetizer plates. Twice. Eventually they arrived. 

Another 10 minutes elapsed while the waiter informed a member if our party that her light beer wasn't available. Strange that they have Miller Lite and Bud Light but no Coors Light? Anyway, drink order was still incomplete as I was asked three times about which beer I had ordered (Innis and Gunn, off the menu). 

The food was decent. Not outstanding for the price, but acceptable. 

Approaching 45 minutes since our arrival, still no 2nd round and we hadn't ordered dinner. We made the decision to leave and a member of our party approached the manager.

The manager apologized (ok) and then proceeded to claim no knowledge of a problem (hmm), blame us for not saying something sooner (not ok), and then had the temerity to ask us to give his restaurant another try. FAIL. 

Sorry, mate. The manager should know what's going on. When he sees apps on the table, menus still on the table, no app plates, no drinks and it's been a while... He should stop by and ask if we are ok.  Instead he didn't engage, and as a result he lost is as customers. 
And I'm sharing our poor experience with other Yelpers in hopes that you won't suffer as we did. 

Epilogue: We walked to another restaurant in Mandalay Place, arriving a few minutes after 11. Within minutes we were seated, our drink order was promptly filled and food was quickly served. We finished, happily full, at 11:45.  Rx Boiler Room, take that as a lesson on how to serve customers.",fXmahab5lpMsExNBecqgDA,3,1,2,pmWLAwJ3Dh16Byzvou94Ug
5675583,2013-08-28,6,_hML_SleB40KkUrMHOZ_-Q,"DEAR RICK MOONEN: PLEASE HIRE SERVERS WHO HAVE PREVIOUS RESTAURANT EXPERIENCE AND NOT JUST BECAUSE THEY LOOK GOOD IN A CORSET!!

This would easily be a 4 or even 5 star review if it weren't for the horrible service we received while dining at Rx Boiler Room during restaurant week.

The space itself is awesome.  It's located upstairs in the Shops at Mandalay Place, so if you are going just to the restaurant, I suggest parking in the shops valet (on Luxor side).  It was easy to find....

The decor is beautiful!  I love all of the different seating/table types and the dimly lit dining room.  I did think it was strange that you have to go through the bar to reach the dining room, but whatever.  

The first thing about the service that I found strange was that the hostess who sat us didn't give us menus. She just took us to the table and told us our server would be with us shortly.  At that time, there was only 1 other table seated, and another hostess sat a table next to us a few minutes later (still waiting for the menus).  Then, the server comes out and approaches the other table first.  She gives them menus and then comes to us.  We had to specifically ask for the RW menu, which probably took 10 minutes.  Now, I specifically notated my reservation online that we were going there for RW, so it was a bit confusing that she almost didn't even know what that meant.  It literally took FOREVER to get those menus, which I thought that they should have been giving out standard with their regular menus.  

The only reason this is even a 3 star review is because the food was so good.  I am 100% positive that our server has never waited a table in her life, because she was so totally clueless.  Although she was very nice, she was very slow and had to be asked for refills numerous times and even forgot my drink order.

So, it was $50.13 per person for a 3 course meal.  Here is what we ordered:

1st Course: Choice of appetizer

My friend and I shared the appetizer sampler, which included the taro root fish tacos, the bacon wrapped bacon and egg and the chicken pot pie nuggets.  All were really good, but I think the bacon wrapped bacon and egg was my favorite.  It was brioche toast, topped with pork belly, tomato jam and a sunny side up quail egg.  My egg was over cooked, but still very tasty and the pork belly was really delicious.  Although the fish tacos were tasty, there wasn't really much in the way of fish.  There was 1 little speck of hamachi tuna, but overall it was good.  I am on the fence about the chicken pot pie nuggets.  They tasted exactly like they should, and had plenty of filling, but I just think that the outside crust was a little too hard.  It was weird deciding how to eat it - should I pick it up? Should I try the fork (did this and failed)?  

My Mom ordered the All Kale Caesar, which was a surprisingly large salad and really good!  I would definitely order that if I went back, and we decided that she got the best ""bang for her buck"" in the appetizer department.

2nd Course: Choice of Entree

I had the Grilled Niman Ranch skirt steak, medium rare.  This was served with Moonen's Tots (on the menu they are Moonen Mash Croquettes) and a small salad of greens and tomatoes with a vinagrette.  The steak was really good, and cooked perfectly.  Whatever marinade they use was a bit sweet and paired perfectly with the smokiness of the grill they use.  For the tots, I was not that impressed.  I am a bit obsessed with tots and not sure these were a favorite of mine, although they were good.  There were more like fried mashed potatoes... and the ""tartar sauce"" that was supposed to be served under them was basically non-existent.  The salad was a salad.  I thought it was a strange accompaniment and should be replaced with some other vegetable. It was not creative and definitely did not flow with the rest of the plate.

My Mom ordered the Bucket of Crispy Fried Game Hen, which came with Mac + Cheese x 5.  I ended up being very jealous of her selection because it was SO delicious!  I've had game hens before, but never fried, and now I know what I've been missing out on!  These were like chicken wings, very crispy and served with buffalo sauce and ranch for dipping (neither was used).  And the mac n cheese was really tasty as well.  The other diners said it would be in their top 5, but I disagree, although it was very good.

3rd Course: Dessert

There were only 2 options, and we all ordered fresh baked cookies with milk.  The presentation was awesome - there were about 8 or so cookies on a big wood slab, with an empty glass and a small bottle of milk.  Although the cookies were warm (there were chocolate chip and peanut butter), I highly doubt they were ""fresh baked.""  

Food wise, everything was good. Our server could use some work and time management skills. Considering she forgot our cocktails all together....",rKkpHJkJ27xOwnhy_bMkvA,10,5,3,NuxS7cLpU2r0eUafSGs1Rg
5677373,2014-01-23,0,_hML_SleB40KkUrMHOZ_-Q,"My boyfriend and I stopped in for a drink before our reservations downstairs and we both fell in love the with it. A sexy, industrial vibe mixed in with a splash of Rat Pack old school class. 

The service was very fun and interactive. We watched bartenders put on a show making creative wacky drinks including one that had smoked burbon in a glass skull. 

The food was great! We shared a bunch of small plates including the chicken pot pie nuggets (my favorite), the bacon-n-egg, the tater tots and the crispy fried game hen.

Here is where the evening went from great to spectacular. After we finished our array of amazing food we still wanted something small to eat, so we started talking to the bartender. He said there was a special of that Rick Moonen was making for the evening of oysters with cucumber spheres created with molecular gastronomy. Now, I am always up for trying new things and am intrigued with the blending of science and food so we ordered them. Then about ten minutes later they were hand delivered by Rick Moonen himself! What a treat, we talked to him about his Top Chef Masters appearance and told him we were fans. Then he and the bartender created a custom gin drink to go along with the oysters. I have never liked gin or oysters but they were both unforgettable. The oysters were buttery and smooth with no fishy taste at all. The drink was spicy and floral and complimented the oysters just perfectly. Just goes to show that a great chef can elevate any food to be out of this world.

Each one was a good portion.  The bites had enough chew and the inside was creamy, tasty, and delicious.  It is what the name says it is.  The Rx Guac was served with large potato chips.  Chips were done right so that you could dip/spread the guac on it without breaking.  The guac to me was nothing special.  Last but certainly not least, the poutine.  My favorite of the bunch.  Nice big pieces of  duck confit.  Very tasty.  The Bordelaise sauce and the fried egg took it over the top.  Not a big tot fan but I pounded it.  Very nice combo of flavors.

I thought we also ordered the Bacon Wrapped Bacon-N-Egg but I guess I didn't convey that well enough.  Oh well, the three were perfect for the both us.  I was beyond satisfaction.  Next time I'll make sure to get it.  

All in all, go eat here if you're in the Luxor or Mandalay Bay.",cgQd4Xs3Y8uTGHz-gjLEGQ,1,0,4,6CrvN4xfmyvfkyLVT2XeJg
5838043,2016-10-13,2,_hML_SleB40KkUrMHOZ_-Q,"I had already enjoyed my best YEE sit-down meal thus far at Rx Boiler Room.  But this time I was able to experience and enjoy the steampunk ambiance of this fine dining venue with friends as a regular diner might.  

We opened seated in a Victorian-style half-booth with Devils on Horseback, fine Bacon-Wrapped Dates cooked to juicy perfection; along with excellent, slightly spicy Grandma's Meatballs, and Pot Pie Nuggets that tasted just like a tiny Chicken Pot Pie held in the hand.  This trio of apps was followed by a very good, large Caesar's Salad with Anchovies.  At place settings there was an interesting mix of half tall glasses and half short glasses, for an interesting effect.

My dinner continued with great large Stuffed Jumbo Shrimps, which were filled with crab; top-drawer Steamed Brussel Sprouts; an excellent Baked Potato; and fine Orzo.  Service was exemplary yet unobtrusive.

Excellent smooth Vanilla Creme Brulee with Cherries & Brandy Sauce and good Devil's Chocolate Bread Pudding with Cherries & Creme Anglaise completed a most memorable dinner, although the Whipped Cream on top was not very sweet.",s2o_JsABvrZVm_T03qrBUw,4,11,5,Ci4BDqUlSSqLiQjmVRTEKw
5838659,2013-07-25,0,_hML_SleB40KkUrMHOZ_-Q,"First thing to note: I sent the restaurant a pm on their Facebook page and got no response, so now I'll review publicly.
My husband and I went there for our first wedding anniversary dinner. Drinks, apps, and food were good. Service seemed not quite up to par for Las Vegas. 
- our booth was super bright - the light fixture was right in my face, after apps came, we noticed a dial on the wall and adjusted our own lighting, would have been a nice thing for the server to pay attention to and offer to adjust. 
-I wasn't sold on the steam punk theme, could be even better/more over the top
-waitstaff kept spilling water everywhere trying to refill our glasses. Get them pitchers they can actually pour water out of and not dump all over the table.
- my seafood shepherd's pie had a lifetime supply of mashed potatoes on top and they weren't great mashed potatoes. I scraped off more than half and left on the plate, I didn't want to fill up on potatoes when there was great crab and lobster below.

-DESSERT (which no other reviewers seem to have ordered) was horrible. First we ordered the cookies and milk, the menu would make you think that you would receive warm fresh baked cookies, not the case. These cookies were awful, almost tasted like they were gluten free, I would have preferred chips ahoy and nutter butters. The waiter asked if something was wrong with the dessert, and we said ""these cookies are terrible"" so he suggested we choose something else, we went with our second choice Rocky Road pudding. That was also terrible, if I wanted instant pudding, I'd whip up the stuff I have in my pantry at home. We saw the chef walking around, but he did not come speak to us, and after we sent food back - you'd think he'd stop by and see what they could do differently. Next time, I would probably go back to Rx for quick drinks/bar apps, and RM for dinner (they have great food AND desserts downstairs)",uiXRB-A-B6XOQzSUNNH_hg,1,0,3,tkcBrkmKjDXWRjj1hvHOCQ

The server was super helpful when it came to food choices and even helped us with picture tricks on how to make the Skull bottle look better in our photos (LOL.. loved him for this). The food was honestly, TO DIE FOR. From the oysters, to our main dishes, the flavors were complimented each other and the textures were well balanced.

This place did not disappoint. Located in the Mandalay Bay casino shoppes, it's the perfect combination of steampunk cool. The vibe is super chill and the food is delicious!
Don't skip on the bacon wrapped pork belly with quail egg. Best little bite ever. Also their buffalo oysters were amazing!
I got the braised short rib for dinner. And every bite was fantastic. Perfect balance of flavors and literally #nokniferequired tenderness. 
My friend got the scallops which were equally as delicious.
I highly recommend!!!",XO_YHR1tjMSzsN_HypnukA,2,0,5,NPUmaGangoW4MPQEy6M8vA

I've eaten here 2 or 3 times, and service and food have always been spectacular! I got the sustainable ""True North"" salmon and Hubbie got the surf and turf sliders because he wasn't very hungry. My husband and I don't typically order salmon in restaurants because cooking salmon is one of my specialties! I think the server talked me into it, and boy am I glad he did! So out of this world good. Hubbie loved his sliders, too. Tried a few desserts, but they change these out frequently so I won't waste your time telling you to try a specific one. 

The last time I was leaving here I saw HUBERT FRICKIN' KELLER eating here. If he chooses to eat here than I really don't know what else there is to say!",5uwsIgJFakD6AJ_wji6ThA,2,2,5,XE9YkY07P5FFkiL9vek7dA

Our server, Andrew recommended the bacon wrapped bacon and we are so glad we took him up ok it. We did order the inside out French onion soup grilled cheese which were just ok. I am a French onion soup snob and thought I could have pulled that one off better. Still good though. 

Entrees were good portions - the skirt steak was enough for two people in my opinion. Very tasty topped with a Korean glaze and micro greens. 

Wish I tried a specialty cocktail and left room for the cookies and milk!",M7Vvr7cDuSUJfmDiNLPXuw,1,1,4,B_WV5J_XpgFvb2D4n6Znwg
5960209,2014-07-15,5,_hML_SleB40KkUrMHOZ_-Q,"My friends were in town and after enjoying ourselves at Michael Jackson One, we decided to find a place that was closeby for dinner. I was stumped until I remembered RX Boiler Room. I have been to RM Seafood a few times and my visits have always been hit or miss, so I wasn't sure what to expect. 

My friend has a five year old and our server was great about it. She went out of her way to find my friend's daughter a paper and pen to keep her busy. We really appreciated everything she did to accommodate us. Service was incredible, I would rate it 5 stars for the service.

As far as the food, it was solid, but nothing amazing. My mom and I decided to share the chicken pot pie nuggets and osso bucco with orzo. The nuggets were good and moist, but lacked any excitement. They had a good texture, but I had hoped for something more. The osso bucco was tasty and spicy and the lamb was fall off the bone and tasty. The dish had great kick. I tried some of their Mac n cheese and it was cheesy and delicious.

None of the food blew me away but it was solid and reasonably priced for a strip restaurant. The restaurant has a cool vibe, although it was pretty empty when  we arrived on a Monday around 8:30pm. 

I'd come back again if I was in the area and needed a quick bite.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,6,7,3,H7byccWFIupHjFzYJ29PJg

FIRST time was last year had a wonderful and romantic evening so good that we KNEW when we planned our trip back to Vegas we would definitely be going here for another special Romantic evening.  Well this was not the case this time our HOSTESS took us to our table we sat down the bus boy introduced himself poured us water. I LOOKED DOWN TO FIND MY PLACE  WAS DIRTY FROM PRYOR PATRONS SPILLING SOMETHING ON IT. After that we prodceeded to sit there unnoticed for 41 minutes the wait staff and the night MANager walked by several times without as much as a hey we will be with you shortly. We were sat with a drink menu but not a real menu. As we sat there observing the staff walk around waiting on a select few tables we witness another couple get up and leave due to lack of service. After the coUPLE left the TABLE, we witnessed the busboy pick up the gentlemans napkin THAT THE GENTLEMAN HAD WIPED HIS MOUTH ON AND THE BUSBOY PROCEEDED TO fold it back it UP AND stick it back into the napkin ring and place IT BACK ON THE TABLE FOR THE NEXT PATRONS.  After 41 MInutes my husband got up went to find the manager and ask if THERE was a reason for the service being so slow,  the manager SAID THAT HE WOULD HAVE TO ASK HIS TEAM MEMBERS AND PROCEEDED TO OFFER US DRINKS THAT WE SAID THAT WE HADNT WANTED WHAT WE WANTED WAS TO BE RECOGIZED AS PATRONS AND HE RUSHED TO GET MENUS BUT AT THIS POINT IT WAS TO LATE, OUR TIME WAS OBVIOUSLY NOT IMPORTANT TO THEM EITHER WAS THE FACT THAT WE WE'RE REPEAT COSTUMERS.
