My issue is with the juices... $11.25 for fresh pressed pesticides.  You cannot charge that much for a juice made with conventional (NON organic) produce and position yourself as a health conscious restaurant catering to that clientele.  People who can afford a $12 juice are smart enough to care where this guy sources his ingredients from.  Also worth noting that the meat is not organic either, so the whole concept is a little off for me.",dEgO4_n8thLMbG1dKfFMHg,4,1,3,2YazjPNZPXaQqAS1sP0MGQ

First of all, we were told that we just had to order thru the tablet on the table. So I pretty much had not much chance to ask about allergy. I ordered the grilled steak sandwich, the menu on the tablet said the bread is whole wheat bread, so I was OK with the description, but there was nowhere I could note that I wanted my steak well done. So I had to go to the cashier counter and told the guy about my need. And my husband ordered a chicken wrap. After some wait, my steak sandwich came first. And I noticed there were whole seeds on and in the bread. So I paged for someone thru the tablet to ask and confirm. Turned out they were really whole flaxseeds, which I am allergic to. Besides the bread was big and there were a minute amount of steak. So the staff person asked me if I want to change the bread to a wrap. At that point, I was worried not knowing if there is anything I would be allergic to in the wrap, so I asked if I can have the brioche bread instead. So the guy took my plate to the kitchen, and then came back to take care of our bill first with a mobile device. I was a bit unhappy about how he handled it, it was as if I would sneak away after I made a request of changing bread. I saw everyone pay after finishing the meal, why would we have to pay before we even had any bite in our mouth? I didn't want to argue with him as I don't want any spitting on our food. So I paid and still were ""forced"" to pay tip right away before we had eaten anything (he stood right next to me watching me signing the receipt. Later on, the sandwich came and I was even more upset, as the brioche was smaller than the flaxseed wheat bread, they couldn't fit all those steak meat in and took away some. And remember what I said earlier, there were very minute amount of meat to begin with, so taking away some making it as if there was not much left. I didn't want to bother to ask and just finish it, and in the back of my head, I was hoping that no one had spotted on it just because I asked for changing the bread. My husband was upset about my sandwich too. And my husband said there was not much chicken in his wrap either. Anyway, this meal was not just and the meat portion was very unreasonable. It wasn't worth to pay any tip at all for such kind of business, we can hardly call that as service, when most of the time was interacting with the tablet. We will never go back and would not recommend at all!",gm8nNoA3uB4In5o_Hxpq3g,2,1,1,7bX9PcyUznsV6BYlZ503Bw

While Kray's menu definitely caters to many different diet preferences (vegan, gluten) they fall a little short on sugar free options and there lies my challenge --probably why I haven't been there in a few months even though it's around the corner.

So today I was krayving their breakfast wrap and decided to go with the determination of customizing something on the menu to what would fit with my diet -- and I did it! And it was my most delicious and satisfying meal there yet!

So here is my suggestion to Krayvings - I was able to customize the heck out of your STEAK BREAKFAST BOWL to what turned out to be: Sweet potato hash, mixed veggies, egg whites, avocado, chimichurri and your AMAZING SALSA - all the other stuff on the side because it didn't change the price.  You have several great bowl options that are customizable so why not just make a ""Build a Bowl""?

Also, I would get a smoothie if I could swap out juice base for almond milk, and fruits that are lower glycemic (berries).

Love your menu, please consider some low sugar / low carb options - thanks!",0qka5xnvBpBm7ZfGsU9oCg,1,1,5,2v7g3Cc_mcvFGgAvefsEtQ

487017,2017-03-16,1,JcFyuyo0Rt6gDiVZ9yJ3VQ,"Maybe had we gone another time we would have had a better experience, but our first time to this restaurant left me with a pretty bad impression. 

Since we had never been to Krayvings before, we were a little bit confused upon entering. It wasn't entirely clear whether we were supposed to seat ourselves and order from the tablets on the table, or to order up at the counter. There were only 2 other people dining at the time, so I tried to make eye contact with a staff member, to no avail; no one greeted us at all, actually. My husband and I decided to seat ourselves, and ultimately I walked up to the counter and asked for help. A staff member came to our table and explained the tablet situation. I also grabbed a paper menu because I thought it would be easier to look through. It didn't take me long to realize that although very similar, the paper menu and the tablet did not reflect all of the same items. So we wound up using both to choose our dishes, and used the tablet to place our order.

About 10 minutes later, our food was brought out. My husband had swapped a side salad for sweet potato hash on the tablet, but the side salad was brought out instead. He reminded the food runner, and she did bring out the correct dish.

The food was fine, but severely overpriced. We ate just about everything on our plates since soup, salad and a sandwich cost $35. We sat for a bit after we finished eating, and when no one came by to bus our table (again, we weren't sure of the protocol), we located a trash can and decided that we'd clean it up ourselves. I picked up the stack of plates and bowls, and almost immediately upon standing, what was left in the tomato soup bowl went crashing to the floor sending tomato soup splattering everywhere. I immediately got on my hands and knees and began sopping it up with napkins. My husband grabbed another bunch while I did my best to clean the mess off of the floor, the adjacent table and myself. Meanwhile, multiple members of the staff literally walked around me while I cleaned the floor. Not one person offered help; not one person grabbed a mop; not one person said a word. So there I knelt, in the middle of this restaurant, sopping tomato soup off the floor with dozens of paper napkins while the staff completely ignored me and the entire situation. It was all actually quite embarrassing.

Once I'd finished cleaning the floor (to the best of my ability using only napkins), we got in line to pay. We stood there for over 8 minutes, and all the while, not one person addressed the now sticky mess of remnant tomato soup on the floor. We got to the register and the cashier gave us our total. When we asked about the chocolate chip cookies that we never received (but were still on our bill), she told us that she didn't have any. After a very awkward pause, she asked us if we'd like her to remove them from our bill. Well, we certainly didn't want to pay for an item that they didn't even have in stock! Finally, after I'd signed my receipt, I kindly reminded the cashier that there was a spill that should probably be addressed. At which point, she points to me and hollers across the restaurant ""They had a spill! Can you mop it up?!"" to one of the staff members that carefully stepped around me while I was cleaning the floor earlier. I'm pretty sure he already knew about it, though. Needless to say, we're in no hurry to visit again.

If you're looking to grub on something healthy or just grab a smoothie it looks like they got it covered. The location is great, especially since it's really close to red rock canyon. The only reason for the 2 star review was the service. We ordered 2 salmon burgers and 2 large shakes. The prices were higher than your usual wraps or burgers but I guess it's all because of the quality of food. We got our salmon burger right away and one of the shakes. It took about 30 mins and 3 follow ups to get the second shake. There weren't that many people and there were 3 servers. About 4 people got their drinks before us and about 3 of them had their orders wrong. By the time we got the 2nd drink, we were almost done with our meal. It's a shame because the food was really good but with the price I'm paying, I don't think I'll be back to get that type of service. They did try to compensate by giving a free drink after handing the 2nd drink but I don't think there were no care or sincerity in their side (they weren't rude or anything, just didn't give a f**k). The fact that we had to keep reminding them with the order and kept forgetting it was the deal breaker.

The first time was frustrating because they force you to order off of their iPads, which takes longer than ordering through a person at any other sandwich spot. You have to scroll through all of the items, which at the time had no pictures, and click into each item to read the description. The smoothies are under the drinks menu, and instead of an easy list with descriptions, again you have to look at the pictures, about 6 per page, and keep clicking 'more' until you find one of interest, and then click into it for the description. Once you finally find what you want and you order, you have no idea whether or not it was successfully submitted. You wait for a while and someone brings you a bill. Again, seems like a waste of employee time compared to other places. That visit we had to go back up to the counter to get our drinks and silverware since no one brought them out after we ordered from our table. All in all a confusing process. The food was okay, though I got a vegetable wrap which was basically all kale, a couple garbanzo beans and very few tiny chunks of sweet potatoes. The green smoothie was not very good, and I order green smoothies frequently and love them.

The second visit was meant to be a quick to go order. Since their menu is not online I went in. I again was forced to order from a table and just check the to go option. We saw about ten meals waiting to be distributed, but utter confusion from the staff as to where they were supposed to go and what each dish was, so the meals sat there for quite a while. While that was going on a customer asked to add two bars to his order while he was paying, but the cashier had to ring them up separately as a new order again through the iPad on a table. Just all seems like such a waste of time. The protein bowl that I got was good though, and a decent amount of food for the price. The experience is what will make me steer clear of this place, at least until I can call in an order, in hopes of making it a better experience.",nd4PcPfCEl8zYa4-8AYm5w,2,0,2,QO6U0gyBuuFhwRm_FBf4DA

The service here is excellent. For a fast casual type of place, the staff are super kind, and they regularly check in on you. 

The cafe would be a nice place to hang out in summer. In January, it was cold on the inside and much too cold for me to sit outside. 

As for the food, I ordered the chicken caesar wrap. I enjoyed it. There was plenty of dressing, and the chicken was well cooked. The side salad really wasn't necessary, given that I was eating a salad already inside a tortilla. 

My only issue is the price. It's a little bit on the expensive side for a quick lunch. I wouldn't come here regularly as a result.

None. Never. Every single time I've been here, which has been more than 5-6 times now, nobody greets you. Forget about getting service if you order online and try to pick up. I've waited more than 5 minutes on 2 occasions and nobody even came up to the counter to see if I needed help. Not only that, they charged me twice on one pick up order and it took about 30 min when I came back to get a refund on it. I had to show the ""supervisor"" my bank statement and online receipt that said it was already paid for AND sent her a copy of it all so she can show the owners. This is for a 20 dollar order. Seriously, I'm not trying to scam them out of 20 dollars. This time, I come 30in after ordering like they suggest and they haven't even started on the order. I can clearly see them shuffling through their order log looking all stupefied. The manager comes and makes it seem like I messed up because ""there was a confusion on the order."" Only when he realized that I was writing a review did he come and apologize and offer a drink.  I work in the industry as most people in Las Vegas do, and service will always trump the product.

Went in with the BF for lunch- Heather was super sweet and friendly, and seated us immediately and showed us how to work the tablets to place our order. 
Shared the shrimp bowl and the kale and beet salad (added steak). I preferred the bowl, which was layered with quinoa (brown rice was another menu option), veggies, and shrimp, with a lemon sauce and mint. Initial impression was that the dish was very watery, but it had good flavor to it.  the lemon flavor and the mint/basil in the bottom of the dish worked well together. Flavor was light and borderline bland- saw many guys around the dining room dousing their food in hot sauce, seems to be an issue for many dishes.
The salad was okay: considering the word ""beet"" was used in the name, i expected a slightly more plentiful portion of it. Salad also consisted of apple and walnut,  we added on steak for an extra $4 charge. Steak itself was dry and overcooked, portion wasn't worth $4. Salad also came with an interesting herbal dressing, but there was very little of it, rendering this salad fairly dry, which is why it wasn't as liked as the bowl above.

Pricing overall was relatively fair, $10 per dish including our add-ons, but the salad was disappointing. This place seemed to be marketed more towards vegans/vegetarians, but really, most restaurants have salads and wraps and the occasional tofu dish that they can access- I hope they add a few more adventurous dishes to the menu once they settle in.

Might come back to try other options like the BLT chop salad or wrap, or maybe a sandwich, but overall I was a little underwhelmed.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,5,5,3,4ixd7lW8MPLu9VplJGIErA

My first time was an evening visit and I don't remember all of the staff by name, I only remember Eddie, but they were all nice. We ordered out and for there only being a three or so other tables being served, I thought our order took kind of long to complete. We ordered a smoothie for someone back home and they made that first and gave it to us so it wasn't in the best smoothie shape by the time we got it home. We ordered two different sandwiches, a burger, and a kids grilled chicken with veggies. Everything was quite tasty, we all ready enjoyed what we had so much so we decided it deserved another visit sometime despite the prices. 

Our second visit was during a late afternoon. Again we ordered takeout and it took a while but the place was also busy at that time. Staff was a completely different group but still very nice. I had the same sandwich but this time it wasn't as tasty and the bread was a little burnt when they toasted it so it tore the roof of my mouth up...bummer. It's a pet peeve of mine when the food is inconsistent even with different chefs. But my kid enjoyed her pizza so I was happy.

Our third time I ordered the same sandwich lol I had to test the consistency again and unfortunately I've come to the conclusion that maybe the night crew has the better chef. My kid didn't like her Mac and cheese she said it wasn't cheesy...the watery cheese didn't stick to the noodles, it was just a soup at the bottom of the bowl. I tried it and understood, especially since she's growing up on Velveeta haha. 
The juice I ordered was alright, I only consumed half of it before it was tossed. 
 
I don't like their self serve drink selection. They have sodas, lemon water and tea. All fine things for older kids & up, but not one option for my 5 year....she doesn't want lemon water, she doesn't drink sodas or tea. She had no option for a drink.

For more dressing because her salad was also ""dry"". The salmon on her salad looked appetizing and I don't like seafood. But again mostly spring mix with a few pistachios and whatever else was listed on her salad. 

My sandwich was a lot smaller than the picture online.  The picture are close up and make it look huge.  The only thing huge was the super thick bun which was a little dry and stale. We were there near closing on a weekend so that could account for the staleness of the bun.

They have gluten free bun and tortilla option for their sandwiches and wraps. HOWEVER you have to order off of an iPad type tablet which is confusing and takes much longer than just ordering from an employee. And the gluten free bun option was not available on the sandwich we wanted to order. We notified the employees of this and they made us wait while they attempted to add the option to their electronic system. The whole ordeal took like 15min I wish someone would have just taken our order we were trying to get something quick before our drive back to CA! My aunt had the same problem trying to order a gluten free bun. The staff told her to select the gf tortilla option but they would put it on a bun. When our food came out it was on a tortilla but we didn't have time to ask them to correct it.
My mom got the Krayvings club and the bite I took of it was pretty delicious. The green apple slice was a nice touch and they give you a good amount of meat! The side salad is just lettuce and salad dressing.
I ordered a juice, carrot celery lemon and ginger. I order this same thing at nekter all the time and the sweetness of the carrot makes it really delicious however it turned out awful here! The lemon was over powering and I did not taste the ginger or carrot at all! This was probably partly my fault bc I tried to customize my own drink instead of sticking with the immune + juice that includes orange and the employee was nice enough to remake it for me. I asked to leave out the lemon the second time and it was still disappointing. The juice looked slightly orange but I couldn't taste the carrot or ginger.
Overall, I was disappointed with the service and the amount of time it took us to order.

The food is pretty tasty.  The wraps remind of of California Chicken Cafe.  Sauces are flavorful.  The portions are solid.  Our recommendations:

BBQ chicken wrap.  Throw some sricha sauce and it tastes even better
Chinese chicken wrap.  Tasty
Chicken bowl with quinua.  This is a pretty sizable portion.  Very difficult to scarf down a ton of quinua lol.  Beef bowl is pretty decent as well.

1779316,2014-03-14,1,JcFyuyo0Rt6gDiVZ9yJ3VQ,"Krayvings Yelp Review

My wife and I came in for lunch at 11 am for the grand opening.

ATMOSPHERE
Not crowded, with a comfortable amount of people already at lunch; picking up as we were leaving at 1230.
Casual cafe dining, open floor plan, no booths, outdoor seating available
Spread steel chairs and rectangular tables with wooden tops, each table seats two, but the tables can easily be pushed together for larger groups
Vaulted ceilings
Mellow, up beat music like John Mayer or John Mellencamp

ORDERING
Done through a tablet touch screen at each table
Menus are separated by breakfast, greens (salad), wraps, bread (sandwiches), sides, dessert, drinks, bowls (soup), and grab and go (chips, cookies, pastries).
After you select your food, you have the option of customizing your order (adding/reducing ingredients).  Keep in mind that adding options will probably increase the meal cost while reducing or removing options will likely keep the price the same.
The tablets have a Call Server button in the upper right hand corner that will bring your attendant over.
All food and drinks are brought to you by the server.

FOOD
We had the BLT wrap, krayvings veggie wrap, and breakfast bacon, egg, rice wrap.  Each wrap also had a small green salad with dressing included.  All very tasty and fresh.  Salads were crisp and crunchy with slightly sweet and tangy dressing.  
Final bill came out to around $24, including tax, but not tip.
Food is served on brown butcher paper on an aluminum plate.  Flatware and drinking cups are all ECO product plastic, made from plants and bio-degradable & compostable.

CUSTOMER RECOMMENDATIONS
Enjoy browsing through the tablet menu.  Krayvings has many different dishes with a wide variety of customization options.  Take time to enjoy the atmosphere and food.

RESTARUANT RECOMMENDATIONS
Place label stickers on tablets similar to ones on tables to simplify matching tablets to tables.  The tablet at our table didn't work initially so we swapped tablets with a different table; making things confusing because we would receive orders for tables that probably had the tablet linked to our physical table.

Wait for all the orders at one table to be finished before bringing the bills.  Because we had two separate orders, there was some confusion on what our total bill would be.  I can see customers potential taking advantage of this by making multiple orders, but only paying for one bill.

There isn't any direct feedback about whether your server has gotten the Call Servers notification because most of the servers were waiting by the kitchen and drinks to bring out food.  One option is to give small vibrating pagers to each server, that when someone presses the Call Server button, the table number pops up on the pager.

FINAL THOUGHTS
Krayvings is likely to rapidly rise in popularity due to its convenient location between the 215 loop, Red Rock Casino, and Red Rock Canyon.  The food is delicious and healthy.  They will likely overcome the slight tricks with launch and use of tablets for ordering.  My wife and I are likely to eat there again as we enjoy going hiking in Red Rock Canyon and taking friends to new places to eat.",Bg88oZgN1P0A7s27XQpsSA,2,0,3,FZh9Q_nEIuCmBEE9elHKxQ

We find ourselves here about once a month for lunch or dinner and like to enjoy our food outside on the patio when the weather allows. For us it's the healthiest restaurant close to home so when we are feeling like a ""fit day"" we jog down here, eat a healthy meal, then jog home.

The website describes itself as ""the healthiest and final spot before you enter Red Rock Canyon and the first spot to get rehydrated after a long day of hiking, biking, or sightseeing""  and as such this restaurant offers super healthy meals with super fresh ingredients and pack their plates with protein whenever possible. They have an impressive menu of fresh fruit and vegetable juices and smoothies to go along with your wellness friendly entr√©e.

As a vegetarian, I always order the Tofu Protein Plate with quinoa. It's served with a sesame teriyaki sauce, sesame seeds, and fresh vegetables. The vegetables are only lightly cooked, which I usually dislike, but with this dish are actually tasty. With this restaurant being as health-centric as they are in my mind the under cooked vegetables are intentional to retain nutrient properties of the food.

For the past handful of visits my husband has ordered the Steak Caesar Salad. Though caesar salad is traditionally served with chicken, he says the steak is cooked perfectly and delicious and actually pairs well with the rest of the salad.

Ordered a ""B12"" juice for us and a bison burger patty for the dog. The B12 juice was made from apple, lime, ginger, kale, and orange and was really tasty.  I'd definitely get it again.  The bison burger appeared to be moist and juicy for the dog.

Ordered the chopped BLT salad. Worried that the creamy dressing would be heavy, but it was a light dressing, similar to what they offer at Red Velvet Cafe. Great taste and reduced guilt because it didn't seem ""mayonnaisey"" as I like to say. Salad was both yummy and filling. If you're an iced tea lover like me, try their peach iced tea (brewed, unsweetened).

Hubby ordered the club sandwich, which he said was good. Apple slices give a nice twist to the traditional club.

I had the bison burger and it was one of the best burgers I have ever had! It was juicy and flavorful and the burger had nothing on it but carmelized onions, lettuce and tomato. Sometimes sauce is not the boss! My burger came with a small side salad with some kind of vinaigrette on it that was very light and tasty. My friend had the kale and beet salad with chicken which she seemed to really enjoy. We were going to try the guilt-free chocolate smoothie which is made with nutella, greek yogurt, honey, almond butter, and chocolate almond milk, but we decided to save that for our next visit. Doesn't it sound soo good though?? 

I LOVE the ordering system here. All around the restaurant and at each table are tablets that have pictures of all the items on the menu. You just press what you want to order, and then you can customize it to your liking. Note, the tablet does not include descriptions of items, so it's best to grab a paper menu as well so you can read what each sandwich/wrap/salad contains. Once you know what you want, you press order and that sends the order to the kitchen to be prepared. Then shortly after you order, someone comes by to collect payment and not long after that they bring out the food. Such a cool concept! I will be back to try some of the other selections they have on the menu.

2073992,2014-09-09,1,JcFyuyo0Rt6gDiVZ9yJ3VQ,"After reading tons of great reviews from this joint, we decided to give this place a try despite of having LYFE Kitchen right around my neighborhood.  Being situated near Red Rock Casino at the northwest side of town, it actually took a good 45 minute drive so I probably won't see myself going here as much.  This establishment, however, would be a great pit stop for those who often hike at Red Rock Canyon due to its location.

Concept is quite similar to any typical healthy restaurants throughout the valley that serve great alternatives for greasy mediocre food.  Only complaint was the lack of seasoning!!  I don't know if it were just the tofu bowl I ordered, but the dish seemed like a bunch of steamed vegetables begging for dressing/sauce to give it some flavor; took about a quarter of Sriracha bottle and several dashes of Tabasco to make it somewhat palatable.

One awesome detail about this place: tablets on each table as the ordering mechanism.  I thought it was dope how the menu includes an image of each item and even allows everybody to customize their own dish.  Downside, however, was that it took us fifteen minutes more than what it should've taken just to get our food ordered.

Overall, Krayvings is a great place especially for those who prefer healthy eating.  Great ambiance and superb customer service.  Will definitely give this place another try in the near future.",6jQIcIkPbztzZ3rq0NNclg,4,2,3,r9aen66S86LcXHTfXYOERg

2137002,2016-02-03,1,JcFyuyo0Rt6gDiVZ9yJ3VQ,"I was super excited to try Krayvings since there's not many ""health food restaurants"" around town. Even though it was still 15 minutes from my house I figured I would try it.

Finding it was a bit difficult, has a super small sign by another large restaurant so just look out for it!

When we came in we were greated by a nice employee who showed us how to order (on a tablet) and was extremely nice and helpful! I liked this because we could take our time figuring out what we wanted to eat and didn't feel rushed at all. However, it was a bit confusing while ordering hoping that our changes and add-ons went through correctly and for one of our meals, it did not. Which wasn't a big deal so we didn't ask to change it. 

My boyfriend got the steak caesar wrap with the side salad. Hardly any steak, which didn't have much flavor and it was mostly lettuce. The ""side salad"" was just some greens with a dressing. You would think for a health food place they could have made the side salad just a little more ... va va voom.

I got the turkey burger which was full of flavor. I opted for the sweet potato mash (an extra $2) and it was very good. However, I noticed that the brioche bun was grilled in butter. What!? First off, I figured the turkey burger would come on a healthier bun and definitely NOT grilled with butter. 

For a place that advertises HEALTHY FOOD, I expected that everything would be healthy and I wouldn't have to worry about getting a non-healthy option.

They also do not provide nutrition guides so you CAN make sure that your food is in fact, healthy and low calorie or whatever it is that you're aiming for with your health needs.

Cool idea and atmosphere but the place definitely needs some changes if it wants to ensure healthy foods with great flavors.",eICyvIE-ZaXqn9Z2vCVT3A,1,0,3,Am6lGWiFJRDGLN17HUYLOQ

Talk about great healthy options on the menu. I know lot  of yelpers have passion for Skinnyfats. Really from the minute walked in, looking at the decor, the chalkboard menu style on the walls (some nice little hand artwork on it too), really health conscious menu, the nice portion size, and screamed Skinnyfats. 

I ordered the  sesame chicken wrap and blueberry muffin. As soon as you walk in see all the pastries in the display and they looked really really good. I started with the blueberry muffin that enjoyed. I was nice moist, hot, and right amount of blueberry in every bite. The sesame chicken wrap was awesome. Usually not high on wraps but the sesame chicken wrap not only was it hearty, but each component really complimented one another (from the chicken, nice orange segments, cucumbers, sesame seeds, carrots, friend won ton strips, and lettuce all tossed in some kind of asian dressing) so much flavor in every bite. It was so REFRESHING after brick workout out at the Lake. I wanted too order another wrap! Oh almost forgot about the salad on the side was nice too and again nice size portion. 

The ordering system found interesting or not too often literally ordered off a touch screen. Not too fool you thinking not humans. LOL!!

On this visit, I had the ahi poke salad (new!) and it was yummy. I also recommend the Skinny juice if you want something tangy and refreshing.  The cool thing about Krayvings is that there is a tablet on each table, which lets you customize and electronically order your meal. The downside to this ordering method is that you have to share the tablet or take turns with it.

My love and I came in for lunch and took the opportunity to share a Salmon Wrap, Sweet Potato & Kale Wrap, and a bowl of Chili. The Chili was forgettable enough that we finished half and the remaining half has sat in our fridge untouched for a few days now. The Salmon Wrap was fine.

I wasn't expecting much from this wrap, but it hit the spot and salvaged an otherwise below average experience.

The waffle has the option of being gluten free, if that gives you any idea of the type of place this is.

One thing to point out about Krayvings is that you order from a tablet at your table (triggering any germophobia I might harbor), but then you pay at the cash register at the end of the counter? ...

While he decided to splurge on in-n-out the day prior while I took the role of envious on-looker, I got to choose the following day's lunch spot. Using my trusty Yelp App, I looked for something healthy in the Summerlin area. Krayvings popped up. I can't believe I've never heard of this place, especially considering my in-laws live across the street. We walked in around 1pm and were greeted by a sweet server who proceeded to explain how to order off of the ipad. 

What a wonderful system!! I have many friends who have dietary restrictions, and instead of ingredients getting lost in translation, they would be able to pick and choose exactly what they wanted to add or exclude and send it directly to the kitchen. We would also avoid the eye-roll of servers from being ""picky"" as some like to call it. We sat out on the patio and enjoyed wonderful, healthy, and delicous food on a beautiful day. My son chose the tofu bowl which had zucchini, yellow squash, onion, and tofu over a bed of quinoa. It was HUGE and he seriously almost finished the entire thing! He's a little beast when it comes to eating tofu and I'm happy I could get such healthy food for him on the go. 

I ordered the baby kale and sweet potato salad with grilled chicken instead of shrimp. I also opted for the lemon vinegarette rather than balsalmic. This was a gorgeous, light salad with rainbows of veggies and sweet potato. I wish there was more sweet potato (which you can add on the ipad!) and that they were cooked more consistently. However, overall, this was a great salad that filled me up. We also shared a small melon juice which was so good, especially with the tang at the end from the lemon. Upon check-out, I saw the tray of oversize chocolate chip cookies which my son convinced me to purchase. It was also delicious. The total for our meal was a bit on the pricey side, but that's usually what happens when you dine at a healthy restaurant. I would love to know where the ingredients are purchased from, and if they're organic as they're not specified on the menu. I guess I'll have to ask next time I'm there.

Overall the food is very good.

I love the turkey burgers and some of the wraps are off the charts, like the steak Caesar wrap. 

The fresh juices are good but they keep trying to put ice in them which is not cool as it further dilutes the juice. 

But here is what pains me every time I go in this place and quite frankly has stopped  me from going in a few times. 

If you go in to place a to go order (which I do quite often) they try to push you to order through an iPad type device.

It is a complete pain in the ass! For example you can't modify the turkey burger to have it without a bun or to make sure your juice is made without ice in it, or to add turkey sausage to their delicious breakfast wrap. 

I don't understand is a to go customer less important than a regular customer and doesn't deserve personalized service?

I was always a fan of Krayvings, but my first few visits I wasn't into the ipad ordering system. I decided to customize my meal this morning and it truly does add to the experience. The touchscreen gives you plenty of great options, especially if you're particular with your diet.

I went for the Bison Burger minus the brioche bun (which I'm sure is great) and added fontine cheese, spicy aoli, and egg- lettuce wrap style. First bite was a ""damn that's good!"" moment. The meat was perfectly seasoned and juicy with a delicious outer char. The carmelized onions brought it home big time.

So I talked my wife to goto your reasturant on a Sunday night. Not busy at all. We also had our kids. First time in a long time we experienced the bring out the children's food before the adults food. Don't do that unless you ask or are asked. We end up with two kids who want to go and I can not enjoy my meal. 
Once I realized that out food had not been made yet I was watching the chefs cook.
My item a Turkey sausage power bowl with quinoa two poached eggs and chimchuri sauce (sounds good right?) gets placed under the heat lamps. I think ok waiting on my wife's food a 3 egg omelet with feta, broccoli, spinach and avocado. 
As a side note your reasturant has a great idea for ordering via the tablet. My wife's omelet was not supposed to have tomatoes. We took it off via the app and the guy who helped us get settled came out and confirmed my wife's order the old fashioned way.
Omelet came out with tomatoes. Arty the guy who confirmed the order must have caught it, but wasn't remade the cook picked off the tomatoes.
Last complaint is you may want to buy a liquid egg because a 3 egg omelet is not going as far as it used to.
The only redeeming quality of your staff was Arty? Had the omelet remade by the looks of it via an argument with the chef.
Back to my order finally got it nice and cold. I should have sent it back but by this time I was just ready to kill the kids.
Get it together Krayvings. You have a great concept, looks like good quality food but an epic bad night.

Good Luck

Him: The food is awesome. The steak inside the burrito (wrap) was flavorful. I like sous vide (!) steak best, then Krayvings', then other restaurants'. It's that good. The BBQ chicken wrap had a BBQ sauce that was better than just ordinary BBQ (it was a creamy BBQ), and the salad is crispy and the chicken was good too because it was moisturized [sic] and not dry. I had the pineapple mojitos juice and loved it because it was nice and refreshing and good for drinking in the summer. You can really taste pineapple and mint!

Sometimes I wish I had the willpower to do so but I can't cut out all the bad fatty, fried, greasy, salty, sugary food that I love so much. But even so, Kravings is new and sometimes a good healthy meal really hits the spot.

Krayving's is pretty new to the area and if you're inside the actual Albertson's center, you might miss it. For whatever reason, the sign on the inside, above their building, is extremely small. They are located in the far SW corner of the shopping center in between Toro's & John Cutter. 

When you walk in, it almost looks like a Panera/Zupas type ordering system but it's far from it. The staff was extremely nice and asked if it was our first time. It was, so they walked us over to a table and explained how it works. There's a tablet at every table in which you can pick what you want to eat, customize it and then send the order to the kitchen. While it's not the smoothest system, it's far better than other table systems I've seen at places like Genghis Grill.

I ordered a steak protein bowl and substituted the quinoa for brown rice. The steak was cooked well and nicely seasoned. The rice was thoroughly cooked and they loaded the bowl with crisp, fresh veggies. My only complaint was lack of seasoning throughout the rest of the bowl. It might be something to do with nutritional value but I felt like only the steak itself had been seasoned so I had to add some salt and pepper for taste.

They frequently forget to add the items that are supposed to come with it, and just overall it hasn't been good. I tried giving them more chances, but now the last three times in a row my order hasn't come out right including the time they hard poached the egg that you are supposed to be able to break over the top. We then had to wait 5+ minutes for new eggs while everything else got cold. The final straw came last night. We ordered two bowls to go, add avocado to each bowl. They made the bowls and then forgot to make the eggs for one of them so we ended up having to wait even longer than usual. When we got home, we discovered they only gave us avocado for one, even though we paid for two, and they didn't even bother to include the chimichurri.

I've been here twice and went off Yelp tips and ordered the BBQ chicken wrap.  It's also listed on their menu as a best seller. It's $10.80 for the wrap and it comes with a side salad.  I think that's a fair price.  The honey BBQ sauce is not overwelming as I could taste all the ingredients with each bite.  The black beans and avocado are a nice touch.  First time I ordered at the counter.  Second time I used Eat24 which saved me $2 off my order.  It's a useful app but it does take a little longer to prepare your order if utilizing it.

I normally stick to the tofu which is grilled and served on top of perfectly steamed veggies and quinoa with a light teriyaki on the side.  (I rarely even use that!)   Last time I tried the shrimp as protein and OMG!  fresh, perfectly cooked shrimp and a delicious peanut sauce... and I'm not a fan of peanut sauce at all.

So far everything I have tried has been great, healthy and reasonable prices.
The only thing that is just *slightly* disappointing is the green juice I would order anywhere is super citrusy.  Tastes like mostly lime juice.  I like a much denser green juice with a hard core amount of greens.   It's not bad, just not my preference.

Came here for lunch one day prior to our hike at Red Rock, it's conveniently located on Charleston on the way to the park. We ordered a salad and a hummus sandwich. The iPad ordering system is very cool, but takes a bit of time to get used to, also the payment is taken manually by the restaurant staff. The service was a bit lacking overall. You obviously have to get your own drinks and utensils. Staff only brings you the food. There was also not enough tables or seats inside the restaurant. 

The salad and the sandwich were both ok, mediocre in taste and presentation, it was a rather small salad and it cost more than $10, definitely more expensive than some of the comparable restaurants in the area. We also each got a fruit smoothie with came in a very small cup, and cost $7 each, the same thing and same size costs $4 at Jamba Juice. Definitely a bit of a cult following and snob appear to cater to the snooty folks in Summerlin.

3860797,2015-07-27,0,JcFyuyo0Rt6gDiVZ9yJ3VQ,"First impressions can count for a lot. For me it might be my last. I brought my out of town family here to try something new. Upon walking in I was looked at by one employee who said nothing from behind the counter until I asked if they had a menu. He asked if I'd been there before and then told me to have a seat at any table with an Ipad. I did so and he offered no further instruction or assistance so I got the gist and began to look through their electronic menu, which as an Android and Apple App and graphic designer I can say is not very intuitive at all, I placed and order and sent it to the kitchen. I waited patiently. Very patiently. We assumed or drinks would be delivered to us as with most restaurants but here that is not the case. You actually have to go and and grab your own cup and drink from the fountain after you place your order so after waiting 20 minutes for our food to arrive, parched, we asked about our drinks, which usually come before your meal, only then did someone think to mention that to us. Perturbed at how long our order took them on such a slow evening in the restaurant I ravenously started in to my tofu teriyaki bowl. It was delicious. Although it was cold. Yes. Cold in most spots like it had been microwaved. I complained and waited. I received my bowl within just a few short minutes. I politely made a formal complaint to the host about the whole experience and said the food was great but they really need to work on their service. After that we got our bill, now I can't say I didn't expect but wouldn't everyone agree with me that most places will take off at least a drink or two but especially an ill prepared meal off the tab? Well not in this case. The apology for their lackluster service was as lackluster and the bill was full charge. I was so turned off by this place that I will not be going out of my way again for it not suggesting it to anyone else. Maybe I got the night shift people on a slow week day that through them off but that's no excuse. Try harder guys.",qRU7nYMJIV05lpKQq4jVjw,0,0,2,nzIdUelq_v_HWnzjuVEG2Q

3885234,2014-10-25,1,JcFyuyo0Rt6gDiVZ9yJ3VQ,"A different type of atmosphere at this place. The restaurant utilizes iPads to order, rather than servers and it still gives you a chance to personalize your order. If you change a couple of things, someone will still come over to confirm. Personally, I really liked this part of the restaurant.

Food: both times I came here I got a tofu bowl. I really liked the taste. The tofu vegetables, and sauce really meshed well. The bowls range from 8-13 depending on what type of protein you pick. You also have the option to add other things to it, like eggs. I got an egg the second time I came but I don't think it made much difference to the taste.

Juices; the juices here seem pretty popular. They are on the pricier side though. A medium is about $7 and a large is 10-11 I think. I decided to try the zen. I liked the taste, it was pretty addicting. I don't think I'd come here for juice though. 

Atmosphere: the restaurant is pretty chill. Some people come here to work on their laptops, after workout snack, lunch with the family, there's just a pretty wide range demographic. It's definitely a good place to come to with friends, you never feel rushed to leave. There's a lot of seating inside and also some outside seating.

You can also place orders to go at the counter-did I mention they serve up breakfast too?  A little glass shelf shows up some baked goods-the lemon poppy muffin is fabulous.

I've been to this place a few times before and the food has always been very good. I placed a takeout order a few weeks back and requested no Serrano peppers on BBQ wrap. When I got home we discovered finely chopped serranos in the wrap which resulted in my wife being unable to eat the wrap due to the heat of the peppers. I called and let the restaurant know of the mess up. The employee was very nice and apologized and assured me she would write my name down for a free wrap to make up for the mistake. I went in today to take advantage of my free wrap. I ordered, told the employee that I had a free wrap, she smiled said ok and took my order. As I'm waiting the owner comes and introduces himself. I'm thinking he's come to find out what happened and I'm thinking to myself this is good customer service! Come to find out he lets me known whoever I spoke with didn't write my name down in ""the book"" and unless I can show some proof of who I spoke with he would not honor my free wrap. He then proceeded to question my motivation and ask if I had some proof of my visit three weeks ago... Without proof no free sand.... Point of this whole story is this is a horrible way to treat a customer much less a customer whose order you screwed up on.. Not only do you screw up but then you accuse me of lying about it... And this is coming from the owner of the establishment! I hope it was worth it you've lost a customer for life and I will make sure my office NEVER orders lunch from your establishment !

This is not often my nature to change my ratings, but I feel like Krayvings is deserving of the additional star and a top shelf rating on Yelp for the following reasons (in addition to the points noted on my original review):

1) I feel like this staff and their team is a cohesive, happy, friendly, family unit.  They seem to like what they do.  They seem to enjoy working together.  The customer service and fun hospitality delivered by their young, hip staff has become sharper since my patronage.  They are down to earth in a way that is open, direct and refreshing.  When you like where you work, when you believe in your product, when you have been properly trained...it all shows in customer service and is reflective in the customer experience. 

2) They refer to you by name and are quick to make sure a new comer understands the niche of the I-Pad ordering process.  They want to you feel comfortable and welcome in their restaurant model.  It feels like family.  It feels laid back.  It feels young, fresh, cool and calm.  Grab them if you do not understand how to order, for they do truly want you to feel welcome.  

3) Consistency!  Every tofu wrap, every fresh blended juice, every steamed side of broccoli has been consistent to a fault absolutely every single visit.  My hats off to the culinary team, for this speaks wonders about the custom, made to order items coming out of their kitchen. 

Krayvings, I appreciate your service, I crave your clean food and I feel like a valued customer.  Thank you!",QGtuYyH2w_R1r-X5BGmgzw,5,4,5,-d-ANQRa85wpnGSuIJR-XQ

Places like tropical smoothie were great, but becoming really redundant tasting food, we decided to give Krayving a go. 

Heading over to the other side of the 215 on Charleston we dropped into Krayving as a healthy alternative to the usual stuff we grab. With a nice indoor seating area I was a little unsure if we stepped into a college campus cafe or a bizarro Starbucks.

Each table had a Laptop attached to order your food. Being able to add subtract and make your own order was a nice surprise. Images on the iPad were also a sweet little touch that was unexpected. 

So seating ourselves and browsing through the menu I ordered the BBQ chicken salad with my son having the grilled cheese and sliced apples from the Kids Menu. The salads was pretty dam good!!! 

My order came out in what looked like a biodegradable plate with biodegradable fork. I don't think I've seen this anywhere except the container park downtown.

The Roasted Beet & Walnut had a nice crunch from the veggies and crispy green apple. It complimented the sweetness of the beets. I'm not usually thrilled by beets, but this wrap changed my mind. I'm on team beet from now on! The BBQ chicken, on the other hand was the fan favorite though. The chicken was nicely grilled, avocado, with all the fixins.. how can you go wrong?

To begin with something positive, the ingredients are good, lots of healthy options, the juices were great.

HOWEVER, I also want to make it clear that this was for a group take out order of 7 dishes and had to give them some room for error. 

We had some struggles calling in our order so maybe I would recommend to go in and order in person. There are a lot of great options for everyone, however, 3 of our orders were either completely wrong or missing an important component of the meal. My coworker and I ordered salmon with brown rice, were told there were no saut√©ed vegetables or sauce so we had to sub so we asked to just get the brown rice with teriyaki sauce for the salmon. When we opened our boxes, we both had salmon with bbq sauce on it, quinoa and the saut√©ed vegetables they said they didn't have. The other item we had a mess up on was a breakfast steak meal but it was missing eggs even though eggs were in the description. Besides that, the people who ordered wraps, sandwiches and salad were happy with their order. 

The ingredients seemed fresh and I'd definitely give this place another shot but only if I was dining in and not taking out. It wasn't amazing but it's a good spot to get a lighter meal or a drink!",RnTfhTi7VVEAMzlBXKvDsw,1,0,3,KmxpVmx_2zZblzfmLfkuTQ

The food here makes you feel good.  Feel good about choosing to eat well.  Feel good that your hard work out deserves a reward.  Feel good that most of the nutrient rich plated here are under $12.

The fusion flavors here ( e.g. teriyaki soy, chimichurri ) makes eating superfoods like kale and quinoa less out of spite to your own stomach and more like a great tasting meal you look forward to eat.

My favorite here is the breakfast steak protein plate: medium rare steak cubes, 2 poached eggs, fresh onions, cucumber, squash, mushroom, and kale.  I prefer to sub out the quinoa for an extra serving of veggies and ask for the chimichurri sauce on the side for even less carbs.",1y1T-gONnhnC68JlR6RNgA,0,0,5,4lPW6iB731gbE6TiHHJntA

Looked like someone just threw a fist full of lettuce I to a tray. Food shows no care in preparation or originality and is very poorly executed.

When people think healthy food, they think salads and granola bars (which is actually not that good for you because store-bought granola bars are super high in sugar)...UGGGHHHH!!! Healthy shouldn't mean bland, boring, sad, and cardboard-tasting food. It is letting the natural delicious flavors and textures from each ingredient to shine without having to hide them in salt or sugar.

They have offerings for those that eat vegetarian, spicy, high protein, or gluten-free diets. Sure, they have salads but they have more than just that. Freshly-squeezed juices, protein smoothies, plates high in protein, wraps, sandwiches, burgers, and sweet treats. They also have items for kids if you have some of those. Don't know what you want? They have menu recommendations (best seller, staff favorite, and kid choice award). Whatever your goal is or whatever your diet creed is - they have something for you. Mine would be to consume 2500-3000 calories/day (from healthy sources) just to maintain weight, and I could easily do that if I spent a whole day eating here.

Your choice of proteins include: shrimp, salmon, tofu, chicken, turkey, bison, poached egg, and steak. I've tried their sandwiches and all-day breakfast. But my favorites are...

Steak & Egg Protein Plate:
Grilled steak, poached eggs, quinoa, basil, red onions, chimichurri, mushrooms, and veggies. DELISH! You get the herby taste from the basil, crunch from the carrots and zucchini, creaminess from the yolk (poached egg). Lots of flavors and nutrients. 5/5

Mediterranean Turkey:
Turkey, roasted red pepper, grapes, avocado, lettuce, cucumber, and yogurt sauce on whole wheat bread, and served with a side salad. At first, I was leery about having grapes in my sandwich because that's the kind of stuff I did when I was little and grossed people out including myself. But mmm mmm mmm mmm mmm...this sandwich is darn good! 5/5

Banana Split Protein Smoothie:
I like making my own protein smoothies in the morning because I get to add all my favorite things in there. This smoothie is similar to what I make. It has NUTELLA, strawberries, banana, chocolate almond milk, and kefir (ok, I don't use kefir at home but I think I should). It's sweet and a bit tart. Amazing! 5/5

I also love the fact that you can just seat yourself and each table includes a tablet where you can order yourself and they bring the food to your table. 

Another thing that I like about this place is that they're super dog friendly and have a patio for you and your pup!

Definitely put your number in for the rewards system to stock up points (every 5 points you can get a free juice or smoothie!) and even get emails of their daily deal which includes BOGO or half off items! I take advantage of this deal like 2-3 times a week!

Right up my alley on the menu was the Salmon with Brown Rice and Veggies.  Coconut Sauce on the side as a sub for the BBQ that comes with it.  ($12.00)    I took a big chance--ordering Salmon in a place that I have never been to but the  Salmon was excellent.

Next day, after more cycling and exploring and some shopping in Summerlin, it was time for dinner. Where to go?  I looked at other places on Yelp, and guess where I went?  Back to Krayvings again!  Not sure it was legal to dine in the same restaurant 2 days in a row in Nevada, but I entered, did not say anything, just ordered, and they did not say anything either,--so I was safe.

Guess what I ordered this time?

Yup!   Salmon with Brown Rice and Veggies with Coconut sauce on the side.

Salmon was excellent.

Service is Summerlin friendly=friendly.
Quick delivery to table--approx 15 minutes.
Bathroom was clean.
Tables clean.
Serve yourself water very good and cold.
Car Parking easy and free.
Bike parking easy in the back of store.
Store has a positive vibe.
Value=very good.

Wish list to owner--Brown rice was good, but the not the best I have ever had--experiment with ones that retain their moisture and flavor a bit more.  Usually found in Asian restaurants. A great brown rice enhances the taste of the fish even more.  

I will be back here next time in Summerlin--hopefully soon.

There are teas, smoothies, salads, sandwiches, wraps, bowls, and pastries to choose from on the menu that is an athlete's dream; there are  protein options here!  I opted for the Steak Superfood Protein Bowl with vegetables and quinoa instead of brown rice.  My friend had the Chicken Superfood Protein Bowl with quinoa, too.  Unfortunately, they had just run out of quinoa and it would be at least 20 minutes before a new batch was ready, so we opted for the brown rice.  Our server offered us free dessert, juice, or a smoothie to compensate for the inconvenience, but nerds that we are, we declined.  The orders took longer than we both thought they should, but I'll chalk that up to this being a new place and give them the benefit of the doubt.  Our bowls had about 5 ounces of meat each, plus at least a cup of brown rice.  The rice was a little soggy for my taste, but the steak was good.

I started out with just a juice as I was talking with a client of mine and just needed something to drink while we finished our conversation. It was really well balanced and wasn't overpowering with beet flavor like other juices I've had. It felt like it really got my metabolism going, but that also could have been the smells coming from the kitchen while I met with the client.

The chili was really good, spicy but not over the top and the bison was super lean so the chili wasn't super oily or greasy. It was really hot when I got it so I had to let it cool a bit, but once I did I couldn't stop eating it.

The Salmon Protein Bowl was perfect. The fish was cooked perfectly and the BBQ sauce paired really well with the fish, quinoa and the veggies. I will definitely get that again next time.

The shots were surprisingly delicious. Usually wheatgrass shots are bitter and leave your mouth tasting like a freshly mowed lawn, but Krayvings shot is sweet and left my mouth tasting great.  The Ginger shot was excellent, a tad on the spicy side since there was cayenne pepper added to it, but so good and worth the heat.

I rate the wrap a 4/5 only because the dressing could have been a little more flavorful for me. The side salad that came in my to go box was only romaine lettuce so it wasn't anything special. Overall, I would return here again.",-5ye1ya0wRQhNRF9NfQ1fA,0,0,4,BwTGE2hfmaEjEtVciVJrQg

I am the #1 Fan of Krayvings! If I lived closer I would eat here every day. They have so many wonderful qualities, great staff, clean establishment but most important is the great food quality and flavor!

I enjoy so many of their fresh menu items, turkey burger, chipotle chicken sandwich, bbq chicken wrap, go green smoothie, sweet potato & beat wrap, chinese chicken salad, protein plates etc.

I enjoy their daily specials and incentive program because I am frugal (cheap) and love great quality delicious food!

I definitely recommend eating here and then signing up for their email thing and then eating here a whole lot more.  My favorite things are the wraps and the rice bowls. And the 'guilt-free' chocolate shake. And of course a cookie for dessert.  The flavored water is a nice touch- I hope they never stop doing that!!!,tsxr7e75Emy9J0klUE8UYQ,0,1,5,tjkIA7q9-VZYhNsxYvA8rw

The wrap consist of chicken, kalamata olives, feta, a salad mix with a lite tzatiki dressing. The flavors were excellent. The smoothie was yummy too. Most of all, the service was impeccable.

I sat down with my friend and we both ordered the BBQ wrap. It's came quickly and was very ""thick"" they are not greedy with their food. The manager Paul came and checked on us. He was very nice.

5926132,2018-01-14,0,JcFyuyo0Rt6gDiVZ9yJ3VQ,I absolutely love this place. Found it a few years ago as I was headed down Charleston after a morning hike at Red Rock. When I want a healthy-ish option or after a morning hike I love coming here. My FAVORITE dish is the Steak Caesar Wrap and comes with a side salad! It's so good. I've had friends try other things but I'm happy  with the Steak wrap. The chicken is good too. Join the rewards program and sign up with your email. They do deals through out the week! There's tables inside and outside. Staff is always nice and the owner is very friendly! If you enjoy smoothies they have a list of options. Defiantly give it a try!

It's delicious! It consists of egg whites, avocado, onions, sweet potato, some type of green salsa, sour cream, and I added bacon. It also comes with a side of salsa. It's very filling and extremely healthy minus my fatal attraction to bacon. Looking at the menu I can see there will be more favorites! I also love the fact that this place seems to be family owned and the food quality is fantastic. Lastly the price is great too!",xcdT5GxG7oGEWEBH4uM-Cw,1,1,5,RbyWJdjysFtlkbyV7pHrTg
5959246,2014-11-11,3,JcFyuyo0Rt6gDiVZ9yJ3VQ,"Looking for a healthy and quick option in the area, I ended up at Krayvings. For whatever reason, it took me a while to figure out where it was located inside the strip mall. It's located next to John Cutter's, for the record.

Once inside it was a little tricky figuring out the ordering process. I stood behind someone in line at the counter and then guy working the register wasn't very forthcoming with helping us out. You order at the touchscreen and then go to the register to pay for your order. I'm all for technology, but this seemed somewhat inefficient.

My grilled chicken and quinoa bowl was ready and I was out the door quickly with my to go order. The food was decent, but the chicken was on the dry side. I'd likely choose a different protein on my next visit.

We ordered based on recommendations from someone who may have been the owner.  We ordered the chicken strawberry salad, a chicken wrap, kids mac n' cheese, and kid's pizza.  EVERYTHING WAS AWESOME!  The salad was large and topped with so much chicken and strawberries, which paired well with the dressing that came on the side.  I tore into the chicken wrap; loved some of the black beans in the wrap.  The mac n' cheese was also delicious and green apple wedges were a nice touch.  The pizza was really good!  It was on a flat bread with a tangy sauce and plenty of cheese.  We were also invited to try the chinese chicken salad, which was out of the world good!  The chocolate banana smoothie was such a treat, thank you!!  Love the brewed ice tea!
