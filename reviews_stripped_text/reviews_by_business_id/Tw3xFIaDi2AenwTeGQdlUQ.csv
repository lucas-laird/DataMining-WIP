I had high expectations for this restaurant since they first opened and I must say they were met. So I had came here with my sister for dinner and so we were nicely greeted by the hostess Rebecca. She was very professional and friendly. Next we were seated and were instantly greeted by the busser for our drinks and then our server. Our server was great and very attentive always coming to check up on us. I definitely appreciate him coming back to check on us frequently and refilling our drinks. We ordered the honey walnut and coconut shrimp, which were both really good but I enjoyed the honey walnut shrimp more. It was cooked just right and very tasty. So I had the general tso chicken and the flavor was perfect but the chicken was a little too crisp like burnt like. I also had fried rice with it and that was delicious. Lastly we had some mango cake and it was yummy too bad we couldn't finish it all. Overall my experience was great the staff was very genuine and catering to our needs. I would definitely recommend to check them out for yourself because they are worth trying out.

1669243,2018-02-15,0,Tw3xFIaDi2AenwTeGQdlUQ,"The hotel 's description and story of this new restaurant is far more inspired than the menu. Their execution of very standard Chinese dishes failed at all levels. The two of us ordered 2 appetizers and 4 dishes assume no we would take leftovers home. 
Appetizers ordered were Coconut Shrimp, 4 large shrimp with so much coconut batter that were sickening sweet and served with a sweet sauce, and Lettuce wraps that were a distant cousin to the P. F. Chang's signature dish. It's sad when the lettuce is the best part of this dish and filling tasted of chicken that had sat in the kitchen a day or two too long. 
Main course's were the Curry Chicken Clay Pot, the only curry I have ever eaten that had absolutely no flavor. The Orange Peel Beef must have been the first dish completed and sat under the heat lamps as I burnt my fingers on the plate. The beef had no sauce and no orange peel, but was garnished with chopped tomatoes. The Chicken Pad Thai had the same old tasting chicken used in the lettuce wraps, tough rice noodles, and a cheap pad Thai sauce. It was garnished with lime and fresh bean sprouts but no chopped peanuts. The Honey Walnut Shrimp was a doughy mess of under-cooked batter with a hunt to find the actual shrimp. The sauce was a train wreak of pineapple, walnuts, and I believe mayo but I wouldn't bet the farm on that. 
We did speak to the manager who offered to bring us something else but with their batting average was so poor that after these 6 dishes we were in no mood for further disappointment. The first time we didn't even bother to take the left-overs home. 
In the end she offered to take two dishes off the check and bring us a free dessert which we declined both and paid the entire bill in full 
Overall we felt they were trying to use cheap ingredients and a chef trained at one of your finer Mcdonalds to execute a simple and tired menu of nothing special, and doing a very poor job of it.  

I think the response to my review was a joke. You answered the same thing to another review two months earlier to try it again to gauge the improvement. It was terrible when we ate there two months later so how bad must it have been before??  I would rather eat a hot dog upstairs at the movie theatre concession stand. 
I wasn't looking for a 5-star experience but I wasn't expecting a meal where the white rice, water, and lettuce where the most flavorful part of the dinner.",5BKDI_g6egkvr82GzJw8vA,0,0,1,bpqqAZ-blxd8swFyLiLcOw

We started with the chili garlic edamame to snack on. Very good. I added a low sodium soy to soak up more of the chili garlic. We ordered a few appetizers for the table but I specifically wanted to try the chicken lettuce wraps. I don't eat chicken so asked if it could be made vegetarian. Yes!  And it was delicious!  The only suggestion would be to serve with wider leafs of lettuce for easy wrapping. Not that big of a deal as I thoroughly enjoyed the dish!  For my entree, I ordered black bean prawns. I don't normally eat everything on my plate but couldn't stop on this dish.  The flavor was that perfect comfort food combination.

The service is great and it better be as we were the only table at 5:30PM on a Friday. (There's your sign). We were informed that there were no egg rolls (what this is an Asian place right?). No egg rolls on Earth or just in this place?  Well it was just in that place as there delivery was messed up......wait for it....wait for it....for two weeks. Clearly their kitchen is incapable of making an egg roll. I have seen 12 year olds make them on television. Really??  As we got our apps it was clear that the kitchen doesn't cook any of them as they were tasteless and 1000 degrees (a temperature only achieved in a microwave). My wife and I shared a meal with I'm sorry we did as the black pepper steak was more fat that meat. How do you turn a 12 ounce streak into an app?  Buy it here...there was 6 oz tops that you could chew.  Don't know what it is about Suncoast but they should fire their leasing manager and hire a high schooler as they could do a better job at planning restaurants and monitoring quality control for their guests.,vAY2UywhoxHMLDd_Espepg,0,0,1,wMGKiUQm2ES6u_pRCVzjVA

We ordered the hot & sour soup that was over done w corn starch - lacked any hint of sour & had nothing going for it - neither of us could take more that a few spoonfuls!
Next we ordered the chicken lettuce wraps - which should be called Chicken mush with bad pieces of lettuce!  Chicken is clearly frozen - mixed w mushrooms & other fillers - flavorless - more like a stuffing consistency - inedible !!  
We decided to cut our losses & go somewhere else for the rest of our dinner. 
Staff was pleasant - restaurant decor pleasant -

2857458,2018-01-23,0,Tw3xFIaDi2AenwTeGQdlUQ,"Service:
Stayed at the Suncoast hotel and thought this would be a nice and easy way to get some Asian food considering there's an option on the bottom of the menu that says 10% charge for take-out orders. So, I called down from my room and the hostess told me I could NOT place an order over the phone. When I got here, I was told to sit down because they don't take take-out orders. Confusing. I suggest everyone needs to get on the same page of whether you accept take-out orders or not. On the bright side, my food came out within 5-10 minutes. Also, if I had sat down to eat there, I could tell the service would have been fairly pleasant. The waiters seemed to be nice.

Food:
Ordered Pad Thai with chicken. The flavor was excellent, however, the noodles were undercooked. I'm hoping I just got a bad batch. I'd probably try one of the other dishes next time. 

If you're staying at the Suncoast, looking for satisfy an Asian food craving, and don't want to drive anywhere, this place will do the trick. I wouldn't go out of my way to go here though.",yQLzBzlg4_VAt2a8FQJDNA,0,1,3,7erMkvl_Q8O4Z79p9DO7ig

2993249,2017-11-19,0,Tw3xFIaDi2AenwTeGQdlUQ,"I was so happy that this place opened up near my house and I came here multiple times already. I can understand that they recently opened and they have kinks to work out. But the pho that we ordered today was the most disgusting pho I had the displeasure of eating. 

When I came last time, the pho tasted typical Vietnamese pho from a Vietnamese place. This time, however, was inedible as it tasted like it was just noodles and meat in a hot water that had no flavour and seasoning what so ever. When we complained to our server, he got the manager lady and we ended up replacing the pho with the Peng Zu soup. 

The Peng Zu soup was much better and atleast edible although it just tasted like salted chicken stock. I don't know if the soup is supposed to be the same broth as their wonton soup but the server told us the Peng Zu soup was like wor wonton soup so we were expecting wonton soup flavour but was slightly disappointed when it didn't taste like wonton soup. But still, it was pretty decent for what it was. Also we got a huge huge portion of the soup which I think they did it on purpose as a compensation. 

Another thing is that the manager(who I said was really nice in my older review) told us she will find out what happened to our pho from the kitchen but she never got back to us which I thought was pretty rude even though she went to the table next to us multiple times.  Besides that, our server was very nice and apologized for the pho everytime he came to check on our table. He also told us that the kitchen probably forgot to add salt and seasoning as the kitchen did a similar thing to their miso soup a couple days ago. 

This place has potential but until they fix their kitchen, I don't know about coming back here for a couple months. I recommend coming back when the kitchen gets its act together.",bmmgelxV1eBpWmT32F3xhA,0,0,2,p_nm_P3cv-YtlFKACeTaqg

Then, because of attending the cinema last night @ Suncoast, decided to try Peng Zu again.  How unfortunate we did so.  [I'm incl. both visits in this review.]

 The Moo Shoo was a disaster, consisting of a pile of ground pork in a way too sweet sauce, lots of crispy rice noodles & dried up white tortillas to fold around this mess, thereby falling apart all over the plate.  The chef kindly offered to replace them with hot ones.  The Curry Chicken Claypot was not the usual one gets in an Asian restaurant because no heat was under it & the portion was small (though a 3 out of a 5 in taste).  The Buddha's Delight was described as ""mixed Chinese vegetables"" but was merely bok choy (& the biggest piece needing a sharp knife to cut or couldn't be eaten), & 2 snow peas in a canned sauce.  I give it an ""argh.""  The chef was generous with ingredients in the Pho but the broth wasn't even the canned variety & instead a lightly colored water.  My partner's Kung Pao Chicken was ""okay"" he said, but had very little sauce & many hot red peppers (you can't specify here like at Thai restr.).  

Our experience has been that Chinese restaurants use more oil & salt than the Thai (which none of us need more of), & portions aren't as large.

As to service, the 1st time it was stellar & last night would have been if someone offered to refill our water glasses.  Would we return?  I see no reason.",kFFhw53ZEPoDo6okPU4eRg,2,0,1,TjngtoOk_J6mkpwrbGjecw

It had too much onions for me so I picked it aside and at the end of my meal, it looked like I only ate half. I recommend more noodles, more sauce, and more beef. Lastly, since we FINALLY got to try the place out, I decided to order their famous soup they advertise as #1 - Peng Zu soup. It was cooked nicely, but I think a tad too salty. If that's how the broth is supposed to be - then it was great in their own way. If I come back, I may have just their soup again. I was surprised to hear (from the service on the table over) that the restaurant was ""out of egg rolls"". It was 4:30! The restaurant had just opened! MAKE SOME FOR THAT TABLE!! ??",y8JpxvzSDXo-g1yh2slWoA,0,0,3,5bkrtAFqfqKVwO0_8IaI1w

Now waiting for the Peng Zu Special Soup ( I'm praying it's not as bad as what the reviewers have said) AND Seafood Claypot with steamed rice. My wife and I are sharing the two items...if this is a typical good Casino cheese need restaurant THAT should be plenty.....

.....just got the soup. Does not look  like the photo. Just a salty warm chicken broth with thick old pieces of commissary style Chinese roast pork....and, oh my, two huge, giant, barely warm pork won ton dumplings (eeeh), and monster chunks of floating bok choy.....the soup was probably originally hot but when they dumped in those cold old tasteless chunks of Chinese roast pork and golf ball sized very old pork dumplings it soaked up the heat...and that cost $12!!!

....our $19 tiny-tiny Seafood claypot arrived in A Soup Bowl....looking more like amateur seafood a la old frozen seafood prepared with Walmart canned chow mein product with black bean sauce added..... man oh man we are the only Asians in here.....and there are your typical suburban Caucasian diners.....please save your money and go to Chinatown for your $33!!!!

.....it's my fault I subjected my spouse to such crappy pseudo Chinese food...I read all the recent BAD reviews and thought perhaps they listened....replaced the cook or rethought their recipes....I was wrong.  Oh service staff were excellent so they got their tip....we didn't.",mYuaXH4LULtDUJQyEn4YDw,1,0,1,tRwIICKdkXPwcCjbQyGCAQ
