After Marisela M. won Nuestra Belleza Latina,  her love of family granted her the good fortune of helping her family open up this Salvadorean restaurant, so we drove 4 hrs to try some Salvadorean favorites in support of this diner, but this place missed the mark at all levels.  
The service was extremely slow.  They only had one server, and only one cook.  Several items that we asked for were out of stock, or not available due to refrigeration problems.  There was 5 of us, and the food was brought out in shifts,  not all together.  The prices they charge warrant better quality and quantity of their food offerings. The pupusas were extremely greasy and had very little spinach or loroco. The Central American sour cream looked like it had been watered down and had lots of salt added to cover it up. My fried eggs were rubbery, the fried sweet plantains were hard, and the casamiento (rice & beans) had no flavor.  And they don't have outdoor seating, unless you call sitting in a room that feels like a metal crate a patio. 
We won't be going back !",DRrkLwIW_06xboxC2_pXzw,0,0,1,FwbUxjiSX4dsPWNGf0FgzA

I don't think they are very clean and judging from what happened with me, they probably don't wash their hands.  My father had a shrimp cocktail and when it came out it was for pieces of shrimp and it was about $15! their empanadas are $8 for an order when i can get them at las pupusas restaurant for $3.

Pero en fin, me dispuse a mirar el menu el cual no tenia variedad d platillos, en ese instante decidi ir a comer a otro lugar, no sin antes pagar la ensalada q ya me habian dado; pero cuando le dije a la muchacha q si me la podia poner para llevar, me puso la bebida dond sirven el menudo y ni sikiera popote me dio. Tal vez lo hizo x el coraje d q no comi ahi, pero aun asi soy cliente del lugar xq consumi algo y merezco respeto. Por esa razón lugares como esos no crecen y se quedan en las sombras.

I can comment on how rude the owner of this restaurant is. Our football team was working with an adjacent business by holding a car wash fundraiser. He single handedly ruined our fundraiser by calling the police on a group of kids and their parents who were just trying to raise money so our players can have cleats, uniforms and a successful football season. In no way was our fundraiser negatively affecting his business, in fact, people were going in to his restaurant and buying his food. We moved our cars, made sure our kids were not blocking his doors and tried to be courteous so he could have a successful business day as well. Like I said, I can't comment on his food but there are several Salvadorian restaurants in this town, so please choose to eat at another, for the simply fact that this man does no believe in charity, community, team work, or cooperation.
