They have a really awesome online ordering site that's way quicker than trying to call anything in.  

I have a pretty picky 9 year old and she will eat these sandwiches.  They are straightforward and good without a lot of frills.  I really like that they aren't downing in mayo like a lot of other sandwich chains.

After opening the bag, the sandwich was wrong. We asked for wheat bread, and was given the regular roll. I know, I know, you're thinking this doesn't sound like a big deal, but when you have braces, like I do, the bread type is important. I can't eat the hard roll. 

Now, I'm fairly pissed off. I want my dinner, it took forever to get, and now, it's wrong. So I call, and ask for a supervisor, and my call was given to Darius. He was very flippant, and didn't really care that my order was wrong.

I asked them not to put mayo on my sandwich because I'm allergic they slathered my sandwich all over the bread and meat in mayo! I took it back and asked for a refund due to the disgusting odor turned my stomach, they said no refunds, they would make me the sandwich again and repeatly I asked them not to, and they did it anyway. My advice to anyone stuck here trying to get a fast meal, don't go in here unless you want to see your lunch in reverse!! I believe they put the mayo on my sandwich on purpose, because when I came back in there the cashier turned her back to me. 


Updated review: Everything that you stated here is completely untrue I'm not into getting into an argument with someone that worked at the establishment however you are being untruthful. I did not order the meatball sub my teenagedaughter requested it, shows how much you were paying attention to the clients order. I am sorry that you were upset with my review but maybe you should keep your store clean and not ignore what the customer is ordering. I had not finished paying when I asked for  no mayo, I was specific about that because I'm allergic. Another lie that you told. I understand keeping the store clean by mopping, but not while the food is being made this makes the restaurant smell terrible, and the person mopping did it next to where the food was being made. You offer free card yes, but I'm so turned off from this restaurant and I will never return. The choices are scarce but that is not the reason I will not be returning, this location I highly doubt has an A+ rating reading the reviews here I agree!

I've ordered from here maybe 7-10 times total. The first 4 or 5 times went off without a hitch, the other 3-4 times they refused to deliver because I'm outside of their radius all of a sudden?

I cant remember exactly but I know I placed a successful order in between all of this on accident forgetting about the incident months ago.  

My house is 1.6 miles away. I drove there and timed myself. 4 minutes. I can jog there in 15 minutes. I can ride a bike there in 6 minutes. At my work I order from a Jimmy John's ALL THE TIME that is 1.7 miles away. 

The most recent time I was informed their radius had increased recently. So.... how am I still excluded? And worst of all my dad and girlfriend have placed successful orders recently not knowing my experiences. 

I get the radius, I mean a policy is a policy. But why all the inconsistency, why did you deliver sandwiches to my house to begin with? And why on earth did you call my house 5 minutes after placing an order to tell me that you wouldn't deliver my sandwich? That's bad customer service. 

And worst of all they're completely unapologetic about rendering service before, and refusing to do so now. I even offered a $10 tip to the driver to go the extra 20 seconds or whatever I'm beyond the radius. 

I just don't get it. I get the policy, I don't get the inconsistency. Very unprofessional.",5Q3J19sYxOMqXtQklNo50g,0,0,2,OZ1hFO8Fh0f6HqBdlvB72A

This Jimmy John's location is brand new and located on the SE the corner of Craig & Jones. If you're familiar with the area, the shopping center also has a Panda Express, Dunkin' Donuts and a few other shops. The JJ's is on the far east part of the complex in a newly renovated building, and as of right now they are the only business open in that building. 

The inside of this JJ's is quite a bit different from other locations I've been into. Like most of the other stores, they have the open kitchen area, but this JJ's has a pretty big open dining area as well. When you walk in, you'll find a few booths to your right hand side and some community, bar style seating on your left. One of the coolest things about this location is they've also got a drive-thru! 

I've always been a fan of JJ's and the sandwiches at this new location were just as good as any other one I've been too. I prefer their thick sliced 7-grain bread over the French bread and it was super fresh. Their meat has great flavor, I love that they use real bacon and I was even more excited to see they offer sprouts at this location. Not sure what it is, but some fresh sprouts really set off a sandwich. Other traditional toppings like lettuce, tomato and cucumber were all fresh and tasty. The only big complaint I have food wise is that they only offer Dijon mustard, so if you prefer yellow mustard, you'll be getting packets on the side.

I have eaten here twice since they opened, both of which were pickup orders. It's great they offer online ordering and if you have a group of people or want to order for the office, they have a really nice group ordering system. On my first order, they messed up a sandwich and forget ingredients, not a huge deal but a bit of bummer. When you order, everything is broken down and printed so how they managed to mess up is beyond me. The second order was perfect though and they seem to be doing just fine for having only been open less then a week. I'll definitely be a repeat customer and this is a great location so I imagine they'll do really well here.",QqRSNjWhfUFv1ZU0OnYKZQ,3,2,4,dLhELgC0c9s7Q-omsK72fw

This location has a drive-thru making stopping by for a quick bite even more convenient and freaky fast than the locations without one. The employees working were upbeat and helpful. 

#12 Beach Club ($6.50) - I ordered this on 7 grain bread. The sandwich has turkey, provolone cheese, avocado spread, cucumber, lettuce, tomato and mayo. When I first started eating this sandwich years ago it came with sprouts and then a year or so ago they did away with the sprouts. Now the sandwich still comes with lettuce, but sprouts are available in the store again as an option. The turkey lacked flavor to me and reminded me of the last few times I ordered this sandwich and didn't like it much. The bread and veggies were fresh and tasty though. I ended up taking the turkey off and just eating the sandwich veggie style and enjoyed it. They offer a veggie sammie that comes with everything this one has minus the meat, so I'd probably order that if I made my way back. The sandwich is enough to fill me, but my hubby has to order 2 sandwiches when getting it on the French roll to get full.

Their sandwiches are fresh and service is friendly and quick. Tonight was extra nice because they forgot to deliver my daughters pickle (she loves pickles). We called and made them aware of it, we didn't make a big deal and we told them not to send the delivery guy out again just for a pickle. Monica was very nice and told us they will get it to us on our next visit. About 15 minutes later I hear a knock at the door, it was the delivery guy with our pickle. He said he couldn't not bring it. I felt bad because I did not have money downstairs with me to give him an extra tip so I figured maybe if I write a review thanking him again maybe he would see it. My daughter was happy to have her pickle :)

I'd like to say the servers behind the counter were very nice but Jimmy John's does not give you the option of heating meat.  I had never been here before so I did not know that!  I am pregnant so I had to leave without anything because you can not eat lunchmeat unless it is thoroughly heated to get rid of any possibilities of listeria.  (Listeria can cause miscarriages and mostly pregnant or elderly are prone to listeria.)  Anyways, I was very disappointed because I was hungry!  I can't believe they can't heat meat.

My suggestion would be to send new drivers with ""senior"" drivers to show them where some of these harder to find buildings are. This should minimize instances like these in the future. 
Older- (I like the food, but they have hired new drivers and twice now, the driver has gotten lost coming out here. I tried to give more specific instructions this time but it didn't work, they still ended up somewhere else. My past two deliveries have taken about 45 minutes. They used to arrive in ten. Someone there needs to tell the new drivers where to go when they're in question. I work in a call center so I can't answer the phone when the drivers are lost.
