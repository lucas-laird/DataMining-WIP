297363,2015-10-19,0,gom1QA1JiSCsE_lhCYjz0A,"Some co-workers of mine are absolutely ga-ga over this place.  After three visits, I can't understand why.

The food is decent but not the best.  My gripe is that there's only one cook, even during the lunch rush.  That means a very long wait for your food.  I am allowed a one hour lunch break but I don't like wasting 55 minutes of it waiting for my food.  That means having to drive like a southern Californian to get back to work on time, even if work is just down the road.

I have noticed the name change, but I'm not sure if their way of doing things has changed.",uTPNvBKY490_t9Ay3bFaww,1,1,1,wCcHk0BXVXVAUVeRBqVSGA

But to my surprise, the food was delicious.  I had the fajita combo with rice and beans.  It all had better flavor than any big name Mexican restaurant I had ever been to.

1873235,2015-06-21,0,gom1QA1JiSCsE_lhCYjz0A,"We may have found our new quick Mexican food place. I personally like this place far better than Roberto's. 

The menu comes they basic Mexican food groups and the portions are larger than I expected. 

Hubby had the shredded beef chimichanga and I had the carne asada nachos. We both ordered ours with some changes (no cheese inside the chimichanga and sour cream and avocado sauce on the side for his and mine). 

We visited the salsa bar while waiting for our food and we ended up trying all of the salsas. I also loaded up on limes and jalapenos. 

Our food came out in a reasonable amount of time. And it was delicious. We ended up sharing my nachos and we still didn't finish all of them. 

We're definitely coming back to try other stuff on the menu...can't wait!",Wc_YLaw7CHOeVDKHy0kdmg,3,0,5,xicElPoVhydl8GkIQVyjRg

The second time was better. I ordered the carne asada burrito, the hubby got the chimichanga again and this time instead of wings, fingers the kids. Overall the food is good and fresh. I would go back again.",lIOyrvz8M0eLD56Op2s30Q,2,1,4,Ktpd2S5lCS4AIanZ0Ti5Aw

4764546,2015-08-08,1,gom1QA1JiSCsE_lhCYjz0A,"Starting with the good. The cashier/server was nice. The menu didn't mention my chicken burrito would have rice in it. I told the cashier, because I hate rice, and he apologized promptly and offered to remake it, which he did, really fast.

The restaurant was clean, as far as I could see. I felt comfortable eating there and the menu provided variety, which I love. Also, the prices were decent for the amount of food we received.

Now to the not so good things. I ordered the chicken nachos and they were not good at all. The chicken was room temperature (it was a chilly room), the cheese was too loose, the sour cream was runny and the chips were too thick for my taste.

I ordered the chicken burrito and it was a nice size but I didn't like the fact that the majority of the filling was beans. I didn't have a lot of chicken at all. I do have to admit, I liked it better than anything else I tried though.

I ordered a Mini Monster Shrimp Taco also. Although I didn't eat it, it looked awesome. My friend ate it and she enjoyed it. She said that it was better than the other items she tried.

Now, because we were very hungry when we arrived, we also purchased chips and salsa as we waited for our food. We were not aware, nor did the cashier tell us, chips and salsa came included with both the taco and the burrito we ordered. Consequently, we ended up with three servings of chips.

Spending 2 dollars on extra chips would not have been the end of the world, if I had something to pair the chips with. The salsas were terrible, to say the least. They were sitting across the room in a little self serve area and they looked horrible. They were all just runny and dingy looking.

Nevertheless, I tasted all three they had to offer. Two of them were very hot and disgusting. I dipped one chip and almost passed out. The taste was horrible and the flavor was worse. I was reluctant to taste the last one so my friend did. She liked it, so I tried it, and it wasn't terrible, but it wasn't delicious either.

To sum up my experience, I would say I didn't like the place and I won't be going back to be tortured.",trO6aQpnXxRXqIyKQ_ryrQ,2,2,2,0uq9xYeZeTGHGokdZNed4w

My first time in I did the two cheese enchilada combo and a carnitas street taco. While the rice and beans had virtually no flavor, the enchiladas were tasty. The highlight was definitely the carnitas street taco. I had been thinking about that carnitas over the weekend, so I returned for lunch yesterday. I had the carnitas burrito which was really tasty! I am looking forward to giving the rest of the menu a try! :)",LHHq-2XWGvNhcICF30JCkA,0,1,4,Pov-ktJKGUO3RlBfpwl7ew

5855619,2015-09-28,0,gom1QA1JiSCsE_lhCYjz0A,This place is now  El Nopal Mexican Grill. I had the Burrito with Carne Asada.  Turned out to be a bean and rice burrito with a little meat. The GF had the chicken fajitas  and they were smothered in tomato sauce.  Picture and the discripiton did not say anything about tomato sauce.Green sauce on the salsa bar and guacamole have way to much cilantro in them. You don't taste anything else. Over all the meal was not very good. I think we will stick with Saborr down the street.,7PD0EuTfz4S-F7L73XkheQ,1,1,1,ptSoi_0MuQW2aB9n9rQ_0A
