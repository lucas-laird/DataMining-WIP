Ordered General Tso's chicken...it's my standard for how good the chef is...excellently done. The vegetable chow mein was tasty but the noodles were over cooked. The mu shu chicken rivals what PF Chang used to serve, so I now have my place for getting mu shu.  Just make sure you review your order with the waitress before you let her go. They were very accommodating and checked a few time to make sure everything was ok. The reason for the three stars is because ambience is non existent. So go for the food and take home the leftovers...or order carry out. It'll be worth it.",gYauBXTFvIqR881KFGULaA,0,0,3,b1o9HzU1wDMhZ3zEF9k4Dw

The server( May) was so unfriendly to us that should of been a clue. Seated us and the menu was a old plastic pic frame with the lunch specials. 
Decided to order the Chicken Low Mein comes with a small soup, rice and Chicken Low Mein. They  were ok. But the Chicken Low Mein had the nastiest over cooked noodles I have ever eaten in my life. Rice was ok could of been better. My husband didn't touch his plate and left the whole meal. 
So I said to May these noodles are nasty over cooked and she tried to explain to me that American people like those noodles kind of racist. So put the nasty noodles on the lunch menu and order the other noodles from the regular menu.
Trust me  take your $ and have a decent meal some where else. The place is out dated reminded me of the Chinese restaurants in New Jersey 25 years ago. I didn't expect my $ back but the food was disgusting and the service unacceptable.",cLsMp8eo7iKOhu4Q60rxJg,1,0,1,r2Oe9M9zmyGpHDsb0_NuZQ

The two regular female servers always give great service and it's nice to see the chinese cook come out to see his customers enjoying the food he prepared.

Yesterday we ordered our favorites Soft Kau Gee Mein, Beef Chow Funn with Black Bean Sauce, Crispy Kau Gee, and my daughter ordered Stuffed Duck. Everything got out to us in a reasonable time, but the Stuffed Duck didnt come out so I reminded them, we had Stuffed Duck too. They kept saying, ""Coming, Coming."" We were almost done with everything and it's been 20 minutes and the duck finally comes to the table. So my twin daughters were already trying to shred the skin from the duck and put some on their plate. I pulled the bowl towards me and tried to shred a thick piece of duck, but it wouldn't shred. I tried to cut it with the fork, but it wouldn't cut. I touched the duck, and it was frozen. I took it back to the host and told her the duck is cold, ""Here take it."" Now this is what upset me, several minutes later they bring the duck back out in the same bowl and put it right in front of me while I finish up the rice. I told them,""I don't want it, you gave me frozen food and you bring it right back."" I left immediately, I will never go back as they tried to fix the issue by giving me the same frozen duck in the same serving bowl.

The center still had a heart beat. I requested the dish to be taken back. When I received the new dish it was the same dish but with a few pieces taken out and slightly stirred around. Like it had been picked threw and just covered with a little more sauce. I was grossed out. I went to the bottom of the plate and STILL RAW.  Asked again for the dish to be taken back. This time when it came to us it was the same but the whole plate had been just thrown into the microwave. I did not touch it any more and I was still AWFUL plate of twice NUKED and sifted through chicken. DISGUSTING!!! It truly ruined my day. Then the check came and I was still expected to pay for the RAW TWICE NUKED GINGER CHICKEN. The waitress agreed it was really raw and explained that the chicken they used today was bigger. Ya so if you know that cook it longer DUH. I was so pissed I paid my bill and left. I was heart broken that a place I usually frequent had done me wrong.

The fried rice tastes like it was infused with used motor oil. I am convinced that the general's chicken is just deep fried chicken sauteed in ketchup. It really tastes of ketchup and ketchup only. The hot and sour soup is just, well, nasty. Something in it literally tastes foul or off. The egg rolls, now I know they are deep fried, but this is like they fried it, then soaked it in a bowl of cold fryer grease until the delivery driver showed up.

My buddy ordered the curry chicken, celery and carrot garnish was meager, the chicken, not all that exciting.

We had the Beef with Vegetable Chow Mein ($9.95), Wonton Soup ($6.95), and General Tsao's Chicken ($9.99). The wonton soup was good. The Chow Mein was ok but Im glad they ask your preference if you want the sauce on the side (dry style) or wet. The chicken was best thing we ate.

We've already been there many times and taken out a couple of times before I've been yelping so needless to say, we like going there.

We were welcomed with a bunch of ""hawaiian"" stuffs...signs that said ""Aloha"" and pictures of hula dancers (for all you Hawaiian Locals, it was Kim Taylor Reece pitures).  The staff was friendly and told us that the owner used to have a restaurant called ""Wo Fat"" in Hawaii but has moved here many years ago.  Unfortunately, I've never gone to the one in Hawaii.

Anyways, we ordered the house noodles with cake noodles (yum!), shinchoy (chinese sour cabbage) with beef, and cold ginger chicken.  We were very happy with the food.  We've also tried the orange chicken, lemon chicken, soft gau gee mein (house noodles with steamed gau gee), crispy gau gee, and kau yuk (these were on separate occasions , of course) and it was yummy!  

It definitely has a ""hawaiian spin"" as Lindsey S. describes and we were not disappointed at all.  Funny thing I've noticed is that every time we go there, there is always someone that is there who is from Hawaii.  I guess the ""pidgin"" and the hawaiian bracelets are dead give-aways!

The only reason I gave them 4 stars is that the restroom is ""eh"" okay.  If you don't have to go...don't.  If you have to...then don't expect anything grand!

The location maybe difficult to find as it is sort of a hole in the wall type of restaurant.  It's not very large so seating is limited of it gets busy. Very basic dining area and feels very old due to the furniture and tables they chose.

So, after my dad's urn was entombed at the Veteran's Memorial Cemetery, the family ended up at Wo Fat for lunch - because that's what he would have done if he were still around. 

Inexpensive and decent food. 

That's why he liked it and that's what I experienced at lunch that day. Pretty good service as well. I'm not sure if it was because they recognized my mom who would have always been with my dad - or if it's the norm however, the server was attentive, friendly and overall, pretty good. 

As for the food - we basically just ordered the menu. One thing about my family is that we not only like to eat, but we CAN eat. I tried and didn't mind every dish we ordered with the exception of the egg drop soup. I wasn't a fan of the soup and I normally like hot soups when it's hot out.

I cut into a few of the chicken pieces and they were raw pink inside. Gross, not to mention dangerous. I called them and told the lady who answered that my chicken was raw. She said to come back and they would give me another order. So Hubby goes back and brings the raw one so they could see it. She tells him that it's not raw, it's supposed to be like that ( huh?) and that it was the sauce that made it look pink (huh?) So he comes home with a new order and they had put the sauce on the side. The sauce was cold and the chicken blah.

We live on the east side of town and there isn't an abundance of great Asian food over here.  When I found the Wo Fat, I was so happy!

While they are a bit pricy and don't deliver (grrrrrr, if they did, I'd be tempted to go five star), they are delicious.  I'm not sure what other reviewers mean by ""Hawaiian-style Chinese"" food, as I've only been to Hawaii once, but I have been to China a number of times and this is about as close as I've gotten outside of the Chinatown area.  The food is always hot, veggies are crisp, meat is juicy.  Their egg flower soup is the perfect way to round out a depressing day.  Portions are very generous and while enough food to make a family happy can run about $50 for dinner, I don't feel like I've been cheated.  There is always food leftover for lunches.

I've eaten my way through a good portion of the menu and like everything that I've tried.  I always go back to the standards - beef with broccoli, sweet and sour, etc.  Those are the things that make me happy :)

The lunch specials are great - but I don't often get a chance to have lunch there.  That is the only time I've ever dined in, as I live rather close.  Aside from that, get take out & enjoy!",utS9ZAswZZx3QkegS_25SA,1,1,4,JTvtfFjiYJpbuAgRzMHRlA

You might not see the Chairman of Iron Chef America in this place, because he's too busy playing Wo Fat on CBS, and no, this place isn't named after Steve McGarrett arch nemesis, but it does serve Hawaiian Sun drinks, and they make a killer crispy kau gee min with cake noodles!    

Wo Fat is located on the northwest corner of Desert Inn and Sandhill,and shares the parking  lot with the Marketon supermarket.  This little restaurant serves up Cantonese culinary style food with a little Aloha, and will make any local braddah or sistah feel less homesick for our old school Chinese fix.

Just like Meat Jun in Hawaii; Cake Noodles is pretty much a Hawaiian style dish, and if you mention this term to any other Chinese restaurant in Las Vegas, they would have no idea what you're talking about.   It's similar to Hong Kong style noodle, but thicker in structure, but has the same crispy outside texture as HK style noodles.    This type of noodle goes well with Beef Broccoli, Oyster sauce Chicken (I wish they made the Hilo style version of this), and of course crispy Kau gee min.   Also their cold ginger chicken pretty killer too.  Wo Fat also has a bunch of $5.99 Lunch and Dinner specials.

One thing, I really wish Wo Fat made some steamed rice cakes, and I wouldn't have to make a run to Los Angeles of them.  There only one place in Las Vegas that does it, and I'm not into paying 3.00 for 3 very small pieces.  Hint, hint Wo Fat...make it, and you will sellout on a daily basis.  It's pretty easy to store in the refrigerator and a little steamer would make it come alive.   Just do it, Please!",ePWsbOWDTJcgIus-BFuKpg,11,2,4,bQDbyCZfL4wXfu23tsC27A

But once in a while won't kill you I don't think. And we haven't had this in decades.

Most dishes were under $10.00 but as you can see from the pictures I posted, it's not a huge amount that you get. If you order several dishes like we did (total of 4), then the portion sizes will be okay.

All in all, a tasty and affordable meal. We were able to take home the leftovers for tomorrow's lunch or dinner. I especially enjoyed the Crispy Kau Chee Mein which brought back memories of Hawaii.

We started with the crispy au au chee (Crispy pork dumplings). They were very meaty and were fried to a bubbly light crisp.

I tried the cold ginger chicken in onion sauce. I was surprised that this dish was served warm and not cold. Once you peel off the chicken skin and remove it from the bone THIS IS KILLER GOOD CHICKEN! Deeply flavorful and moist. Not over seasoned the chicken flavor comes threw, just DELICIOUS. The portion they gave me was very large and I had enough leftover for two large dinners.

I wanted to try the hard to come by CAKE NOODLES. My server spoke English but I had a hard time understanding her and I accidentally ordered a meal of chicken cake noodles instead of just adding on cake noodles for $1.25. Anyway the cake noodles are really delicious. They remind me of ramen but are more firm and have much more flavor like wheat. The noodles seemed slightly pan fried with crisp ends and even were more delicious on the crispy ends. What ever kind of chicken dish she ordered for me was also delicious. It was chunks of flavorful tender yummy dark meat chicken.

My husband had Szechuan Shrimp. The shrimp were cooked well and this dish was FIERY HOT as it should be.

Mmmmm the minute chicken came noodle was so good. They separated the sauce so the cake noodle would to get soggy on the drive home. The only thing I was disappointed in was that it seemed like there was more cake noodle than chicken & veggie, but other than that it was delicious. 

The Chinese broccoli was the bomb. Not too soggy and not too hard. Just perfect crispness. 

The appetizer was alright. The BBQ pork had sesame seed on it which is alright but since I don't like it and wasn't expecting it I had to scrape it all off but it was still good. The only thing I didn't like was the gau gee. There was barely any meat and was only skin.

Another person in our group pulled up Wo Fat on Yelp and said it had the highest star rating that was closest to where we were, so off we went.

This place is quite run down and the service was cold, not mean or anything, just everyone working here seemed super serious.  At least they took care of business, took our order quickly, and said it would take about 15 minutes.  

We ordered 3 items from their menu:  Kung Pao Chicken, Beef Chow Fun with Black Bean Sauce, and Beef Moo Shu.

Kung Pao Chicken -  It was just okay, and I didn't see any of the red chili peppers that I'm normally used to seeing with this dish.  It was also incredibly spicy and they used too much white pepper.  It was too over-powering for everyone.

Beef Chow Fun with Black Bean Sauce - One of my favorite dishes in general, and it was the best of the 3 dishes we ordered here.  The noodles were tasty, as was the sauce.  The cut of meat was okay; it sufficed for what this place is.

Beef Moo Shu - These were the smallest rolled up Moo Shu that I've ever seen.  They gave us 4 of them, so that was a plus, but the outer part of the Moo Shu was thick and had an odd flavor that I still can't put my hand on.  I say ""nay"" to this weird-looking and odd-tasting Moo Shu.   

There's no way the food here is worthy of 4 or 5 stars, it's good enough if you're craving Chinese fast food and it's served with icy service, but I won't be coming back here again.  I travel to Vegas more often now so I'll be trying other spots.",yij-diFydhKcbLT441cxgg,46,42,3,Bp_acSrTB-sWyyqfJZRA8A

Nelson and Sylvia Q. had been here before, so they suggested some of the dishes that we ordered.  I can't say there was a loser in the bunch but I liked some better than others.

The spicy shrimp were good but they weren't spicy.  There were some jalapeño slices on top but there was no  spiciness to the shrimp themselves.  The crispy Gau gee was a winner!  What great flavor in that fried goodness.  We mixed the Chinese mustard with soy and dipped the Gau gee in that.  Great!  The pressed Almond duck was another winner.  I love duck and this was great!  The Kow yuk - pork belly - was very good and was not as sweet as the look of the sauce suggested.  Putting a thick slab of the pork belly in a bao and eating was very tasty.

4702255,2014-01-11,1,S5FTckOpSK0_Ma4c18ZEgg,"I was determined to visit Wo Fat because of its Hawaiian-style Chinese cuisine. For that reason, it wasn't difficult to convince my family to come with me. We all loved and constantly crave the Chinese dishes from our past. Although I have come to love the Chinese cuisine offered in Las Vegas, it's just not the same. Anyway, the real reason I wanted to come? Four words: Crispy Gau Gee Mein. We ALWAYS ordered it at our favorite Chinese restaurant in Hawaii and it's been over a decade since I've had it! 

It was quite the drive for us (as is most places) and we were starving by the time we arrived. It's a small restaurant with just 3-4 large round tables and approximately 10 small booths. Fortunately, one of the large groups were leaving, so we didn't need to wait long for a table (there's really no where to wait except outside).

With five of us dining, we shared Lo Mein, Shrimp & Broccoli in Black Bean Sauce, Chicken Chow Mein, Combination Fried Rice, Kung Pao Chicken, Mapu Tofu, and two orders of Crispy Gau Gee Mein (substituted with Cake Noodles). All the dishes, with the exception of the Lo Mein (I didn't try it) and Crispy Gau Gee Mein, were only okay. The Chow Mein and Kung Pao Chicken were terrible. The Fried Rice has a very distinct flavor that really took me back to my youth, however, the quality left something to be desired. The Black Bean Shrimp and Tofu dishes were better than the rest of the group, but nothing great. 

The Crispy Gau Gee Mein, on the other hand, YUM. The Gau Gee is perfect..exactly how I remember eating it in Hawaii!! Crispy exterior with delicious, moist pork interior. So good. The vegetables, gravy, and noodles were harmonious. It's a popular dish and I absolutely recommend it. Although, it is a damn shame that it doesn't just come with cake noodles since that's the best way to eat this dish (don't forget the additional charge).

Oddly, the rice wasn't very tasty either. My favorite part of receiving steamed rice at Chinese restaurants is the delicious, fragrant Jasmine rice. Their rice seemed like it was just a long grain white rice, but my parents thought it was an inferior Jasmine rice. Either way, not yummy and disappointing.

Service was nothing spectacular and there were young children running in and out of the kitchen. Not very professional or sanitary. Nevertheless, we all thoroughly enjoyed the Crispy Gau Gee Mein, but it was unanimous that a second visit would be unlikely.

The rice was under cooked, the gravy tasted watered down, and the bean sprouts tasted like they just were just poured out of the can.  I fix better egg foo yung then this place.

5042181,2014-05-25,0,S5FTckOpSK0_Ma4c18ZEgg,"Skimming through my Facebook news feed was a very effective way to get this place on my radar. One of my high school classmates checked into this place and captioned it with, ""Hawaiian Style Chinese food."" From that point on, I was sold. It wasn't too far from my house and my body was telling me it was time to eat. As I researched this place on my Yelp app, I realized that this place sold cake noodles, a dish reminiscent of my childhood days. Boy was I excited.

This place is located on the corner of  Desert Inn and Sandhill, which means from the 95, you'll have to take Flamingo or the Boulder cutoff and travel down Sandhill. This restaurant sits in a shopping center full of mediocre businesses, not too exciting of a location. When you enter, you think very outdated. Booths and round tables with lazy Susans tell you this place needs a renovation and fast! What calmed my initial nerves was the fact that they do their best to hold the Chinese traditions AND seem to cater to the Hawaiian population. Hawaiian drinks, signs with ""Aloha"" and ""Mahalo"" display their windows and counters. Did I really hit the jackpot?? When talking with the employees, the young lady said her uncle has a Wo Fat restaurant in Honolulu and this is another location. The staff was super nice. Even though I ordered my food to go, she still offered water to me. The food also came very quickly. Speaking of which, here's what I got:

Crispy Gau Chee Mein with cake noodles for around $10: THE REASON that brought me here and the reason that will keep me coming back! As a base you have the delicious cake noodles that remind me of my childhood. Crispy noodles cut into cake squares, topped with Gau Chee, oyster sauce and lots of different flavors and textures: char siu pork, shrimp, chicken, broccoli, Chinese peas, water chestnuts and mushrooms. WOW, what an array of flavors! So delicious and something I highly recommend! The cake noodle managed to maintain is crispiness, even with the oyster sauce. I was in heaven.

Kow Yok for $9.25: Kind of weird that they spell it like this. In Hawaii, it's referred to as Kau Yuk. Whatever the spelling, it's basically pork belly cooked and flavored with a fermented red bean curd. PLEASE BE ADVISED, this is a super marbleized dish. The fat can be very over powering for many, so don't order it if you're not into that. For me, it's what I grew up with! The flavor was just right. The pork had a good combination of fat/meat ratio. 

Crispy Gau Chee order (6) for $6.25: Another form of spelling I'm not used to. In Hawaii it's Cripsy Gau Gee. Basically pork stuffed won ton rectangles and deep fried, served with a spicy mustard and soy dipping sauce. This was ON POINT! Perfectly cook, super crispy and the port was flavored well. Add in the mustard sauce and you've got a side dish fit for a king! You definitely have to try this if you come!

Oyster Chicken for $8.95: Roasted chicken topped with an oyster flavored sauce. I thought the sauce was great and really helped to enhance this dish. My only gripe about this dish was the cut of chicken. It's Chinese style and cut like a roasted duck dish, meaning the cut bones and all. Although this is a Chinese restaurant, I don't necessarily think it's a Hawaiian style dish. What I'm used to is boneless, breaded and fried chicken with the oyster sauce drizzle. The flavor was good, but for some reason I wasn't as crazy about this dish as I was about the others. 

FINALLY! A Chinese restaurant that reminds me of home! There are a lot of Chinese joints in Las Vegas, none like this. The cake noodles alone are reason to come back. Add the crispy gau chee and I've officially found my new favorite joint! On my next visit, I'm getting the cold ginger chicken. I can't wait for that day to come.

Ive spent a lot of time in Hawaii with family and the food there is different. Everything is island style and wo fat is just that. Island style chinese food. Lunch specials are pretty good with decent portions. I love the cau gee and the oyster sauce chicken. Whole crispy chicken smothered in a savory oyster sauce. Other go to items are cold ginger chicken a local favorite in Hawaii. This last visit we ordered the Mongolian beef which usually I like but I wasn't a fan of it here.

The reason I would come back here :

Pressed Almond Duck. This was VERY good. It is served boneless and has lots of flavor combined with the slightly sweet almond topping. The highlight of my meal!

Beef Chow Funn in Black Bean Sauce. This was pretty good! Tender beef with a nice flavorful noodle and sauce. Yum :)

Spicy Shrimp in Shell aka Salt & Pepper Shrimp. These were what you would expect, just not spicy at all. Good version of this dish. 

Kow Yuk (Pork Belly) served with Bao. This was tender and flavorful, but not sweet or sour like the color may suggest. It was good but did not impress me as much as my lunch mates. 

Crispy Kau Chee. Filled with a meat combination...similar to a crispy wonton of sorts.  Not bad.

Crispy Kau Chee Mein with Pork, Shrimp & Veggies. This was ok. Decent flavor but it was not extraordinary.

I decided to piece meal it, and in hindsight, ordering the family dinner might have been slightly cheaper. Regardless, I ordered the General Tso's Chicken, Shrimp Fried Rice, and Chow Mein Combination. 

The food was decent. The Generals Chicken was alittle different than I expected and had a thick bright red glaze. The glaze also had a ""ketchup like"" smell to it when I first opened the box. Thankfully it didn't taste like ketchup, rather the sweet orangy-ness of any other General's Chicken, with a bright spicy flavor. The shrimp fried rice was your basic SFR, with plenty of egg, veggies and sprouts. Not much shrimp, and it was the small 20-30 type of shrimp and they tasted watery, as if to suggest it was previously frozen. The combo noodles had pork and chicken as well as the aforementioned shrimp with a sweet gingery flavor.
It was a fairly decent experience, and it reminded me a lot of the old Cheng's Express on south rainbow. The service was pretty lackluster. The lady had a weird attitude problem, even another customer asked if she was ok. She also rushed me through my order, which caused me to forget I wanted Orange chicken. I don't know if it means anything to her, but that's 10 additional dollars I would have spent. I don't know if she was at the end of a long shift, but it wasn't the best experience. When she handed me my food she was a lot nicer, and smiled even. All in all, I'd come back to this spot. It's the only one like it I've found around here.

Having heard things both interesting and exciting about Wo Fat and its Hawaiian influenced Chinese cuisine but not yet able to coax a large enough group to make the visit worthwhile it was with great fortune that following donuts I not only managed to gather five co-diners to experience the small East side restaurant, but that two of the folks involved were already familiar with not only Wo Fat from a prior visit, but also the restaurant's style from their years in Hawaii.  Located in a less than ideal location and not particularly attractive from the outside or within it should suffice to say that a visit to Wo Fat is based more on the food than the ambiance but with service friendly and efficient throughout the off-hour it was with tea and water that the meal began, soon to be followed by a half dozen menu selections - most novel, all well prepared, and a few truly outstanding.  Sampling far and wide with suggestions from everyone including our server it was with plethoric portion that each dish arrived and with both the pork and shrimp stuffed kau gee as well as the beef chow funn excellent while cake noodles and shrimp were commendable if not memorable it was in the pork and the duck that the meal truly shined - the former a complex sort of mild char sui with more aromatics and less sugar proving irresistible on soft bao while the later was simply divine, a tender confit of duck beneath crackling almond paste that added just a touch of sweetness for a mere $9.95.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,2,1,4,0oh2SAZ1qIFH0zt0ysK1bg

There is no question that the physical restaurant is in need of a major comfort makeover ... but I've come for the flavors, spices, and combinations thereof that I overlook minor discomforts.  

The Sunday evening we visited the restaurant it was packed with mostly large parties of extended Hawiian families.  It was loud, crying children, balmy laughter and unthrolled conversations; just what a ""family"" Chinese restaurant should sound like. Not even sure we were below maxium seating compacity. 

Take care when ordering normally spicy dishes to express your desire level of heat.  Recommend you order to side of caution; Chef was a little heavy handed.

My seafood cake noodle had sauce that I swear was microwaved - cold on the edges but piping hot in the center and GELATINOUS! Well what the heck is the point of driving all the way out here for gross food?! AND I ordered my food stating that we don't eat pork. They bring me fried rice with pork char siu. When I ask the server what it is (thinking MAYBE it's chicken char siu?) she said, ""It's pork. Just eat it."" WTF?! You bet they got a tip that equaled their more crappy than usual service.

5722912,2018-05-26,0,S5FTckOpSK0_Ma4c18ZEgg,Yum! Haven't had Chinese food in a while but it's kind of my in-laws thing. We drove in from AZ to meet them and on our way to hotel stopped at this restaurant. The place was empty but your typical looking Chinese place. Sat down and ordered a bunch of food. Everything from pork with green beans to beef broccoli and ginger chicken. Of course they ordered way to much food but everything was great and flavorful. I'm so glad they wanted to eat here but it's someplace that they frequent while in town. Next time we're in town we'll stop by!! No pictures as the kids were hungry and I had to make plates and get sum bites in while I could.,_ztetpb3iXrlo24E9pVH8A,0,0,5,MP7wStScPyCsAPOM4KSjdg

It's a total hole in the wall and far from my house but it really is the only option for Hawaii style Chinese food. I've always eaten in because it's so far, but unlike others I've always had good service. 

We were there specifically to try the pressed almond duck - finely shredded duck meat pressed together, coated with cornstarch and fried. Garnished w almonds and sweet sour sauce on the side. It was a lot of duck for $10. Not something I would have to order again but it was very good.

 Also tried deep fried garlic pork ribs, which weren't very good - meat was tough and garlic was burnt. Looked better than it tasted. And had to go with our usual crispy gau gee mein w cake noodle. Great as always -huge portion w lots of goodies and 4 big fatty crispy gau gee (like big big pork won ton)",dsaj_eA71FvpUh49zzKcGA,1,1,4,2NOoUmxN-93tJLKcQcusQA

The must haves include, crispy kau gee, stuffed duck, and cake noodle with anything.  If you have a bigger party or if you want to take home some food, the ong choy with harm ha and pork and the kau yuk are classic.",GF-UBIwA0gEcUbAkve6s3A,2,1,4,uu19R0u0eo7CwyCkMHwHog

It was always the place to go after church, when family visited and when you crave certain foods and don't know what it's called, you come here cause you know it will be here lol. 

 I live about a half hour away from here and I will drive here for good and affordable Chinese food!! This place is like home to me!!

The crispy kau chee mein is my all time favorite, alongside with the spicy pork chops! I recommend this place, it's a cute hole in the wall restaurant that has been here for years!",CO-hrvV8pwxWufDqgtVrdw,2,1,5,IqaxH9nPMMyiLffVpSj6fA
5836658,2014-07-03,0,S5FTckOpSK0_Ma4c18ZEgg,"After a failed hunt for manapua, a friend suggested that maybe I check out Wo Fat since it was basically on my way home. It took me a little while to find it because I didn't exactly know where I was going. 
When I went in, there were several large groups seated but I knew I was going to get my order to-go, so I stepped right up to the counter. I ordered the minute chicken with cake noodle because I hadn't had any good cake noodle since leaving Hawaii in January because I couldn't find any. The manapua would have to wait till another day. 
The ordering process was easy. Then came the long wait. And I mean LONG. You would think something with a name like minute chicken wouldn't take very long. But it was almost half an hour before I got my order. There wasn't a place for you to wait for a take-out order, so I basically stood on the side near the restrooms pretty much staring at the blown up articles they had on the walls. 
Once I got home, I realized that I needed to put the sauce on the noodles, which I thought was a good thing. (Even if I do like the sauce making the noodles soft and mushy.) I let it sit for a little while and went to do something else. When I went back to my food, I saw that it really wasn't a very big portion for the $10 I paid. It barely covered the bottom of a styrofoam container. It was a little disappointing. But the food wasn't bad. It was tasty and the cake noodle was similar to ones I've had previously. 
I don't think I'll be going back anytime soon, though. It wasn't worth the price I paid and I think I could have gotten more for my money somewhere else. But at least I got cake noodle. That was the one bright spot.",BeDfEK3qeIdnmwjnGFa8xg,1,0,3,dlAWCha9s6sWBZTMKHjh0Q

702.451.6656
3700 E. Desert Inn Road    

Quite possibly our favorite Chinese restaurant here in Las Vegas.  For months, we searched for a good down-to-earth Mom & Pop Chinese restaurant that was no-nonsense and un-pretentious.  We figured we would have to search away from the strip and boy, were we right.  This is about as AWAY from the strip as you can get.    Located on the far east side of Desert Inn, Almost at Boulder Highway, we willingly drive all the way from Durango to here to get our Chinese Comfort Food-Fix.

Everything that we have tried on the menu is excellent, but the true gems are the House Specialty dishes that are up on the wall by the entryway.  I highly suggest the Baked Pork Chops in spicy salt, the Hong Kong Style Chow Mein and the secret dish Kau-Yu (Spelling?)  Which are tender BBQ Pork belly with Rice flour buns to wrap them in.

Dishes average from the $6 -$9 range with some special dishes above that, so it's very  very affordable.

Personal Note.
This little gem is HIGHLY recommended not just for the great food, but for the very friendly staff as well.   It's gotten to the point where we walk in and the Baked Pork Chops are already being cooked and it's just a matter of what new things we want to try on the menu.",j3Xr0XifJTb43Hdmue8b9A,1,0,5,AFA5hoqeD85_2BgNGXrJHw
5915249,2013-02-25,0,S5FTckOpSK0_Ma4c18ZEgg,"Finally Hawaiian Chinese food! 
What exactly is Hawaiian Chinese food you ask? It's Cantonese food from Hawaii. It's nothing crazy just the Chinese food we grew up with in the islands. Wo Fat boasts many local favorites like crispy gau gee, cold ginger chicken, kau yuk, manapua and most importantly cake noodles!  Sadly I'd explode if I ordered all the fore mentioned goodness on this trip so I just stuck to the gau gee, oyster chicken cake noodles and roast duck. (Hey don't judge I gotta watch my figure!) 

Anyhow,
The crispy gau gee was on point! It tasted fresh (cooked in clean oil!) and had lots of meat stuffing. They didn't skimp on filling these bad boys! Thank god I was beginning to lose hope that gau gee was a lost item item doomed to never orderdom because of the consistent let downs. This place restored my faith that gau gee is still worth ordering.
 The oyster chicken cake noodles were just how I remember they were prepared at Mui Kwai in Hawaii; crunchy fried noodles covered in oyster chicken, bok choy and gravy. So simple but so good.This dish didn't stand a chance against me. I killed it before a single noodle had a chance to go soggy. Winnahs in my book!
The roast duck was a little different than what I am used to but it was ono (delicious) nevertheless. The duck came out plated wet with sauce. I am used to getting it straight from the hanging hook in the window, chopped and straight to the plate and not all sauced up. I'm not complaining about it but it just was not what I was expecting. 

There is nothing fancy about the food here, it's just good Chinese ""soul food"" just like how we remember Chinese food to be in Hawaii. This notion alone plucks at the strings of stomach and my heart and will have me coming back anytime I'm jonsing for Hawaiian Chinese food.",E_Ts8j758tpiAZknHR7k4g,5,3,4,6clF8qpM9ID0NxtLaNeiVg
