124326,2012-10-19,0,Vg1C_1eqwIwkZLIXGMTW3g,"I've heard about it for years, but I somehow never made it to the Crown & Anchor British Pub until a couple weeks ago. It's always high on a lot my friend's lists of dive bars along with Frankie's Tiki Room, the Double Down, etc, but those recommendations are typically more for drinks and overall ambiance than food. This is why I was particularly skeptical about this one, even with a few friends swearing by it. Needless to say, I ate it and was more than surprised.

The pub is located on the east side of Tropicana in an iffy area of town, but you're not coming here for the class. The interior is decked out with British-inspired street signs, posters of boats and the like, with the waitresses wearing skimpy kilt outfits. There's also an outdoor patio which I've heard is dog friendly. I was fully expecting an overly loud, smoky bar scene that would have made eating a bit unsavory, but it was surprisingly quiet on the Saturday night we were there. The menu features all sorts of traditional British dishes that I've heard are hard to find at other locations around town. This is all good, but I only really care about burgers for the sake of this review so I'll have to try some of that other wacky stuff on my next visit.

The British Burger on their menu comes with a  1/2 pound patty, bacon, lettuce and tomato and choice of a few cheeses. My burger had great char flavor upon first bite, which carried all the way through. It was cooked a bit more than medium-rare but I was ok with it due to the overall great flavor. It was greasy for the first half, dried up a bit in the second half but was still ok because of the flavor. My bacon wasn't quite as cooked as I would have liked, but it still had decent flavor. The thin onions were good but I still pulled them off as to not overpower the great flavor I was experiencing. The lettuce and tomato were fresh, although the tomato was a little sparse, and the swiss cheese was melted and good as well. The bun was soft, gooey and delicious, and was very well proportioned to meat. Overall this was an excellent burger that I wasn't expecting at all.

While I typically don't care for them, my steak fries were actually really good; they were cooked well for the most part but there were a few soggy ones in there.  My side pickle slices were good too; they never made it onto my burger but I still ate them. At $9.25 with fries this is very reasonably priced; combine that with a beer or three and you're in for a good time. If you're looking for a unique local pub with plenty of drink and food options definitely stop by the Crown & Anchor.",0G9BcXSQscv_GnhlNwFfjw,1,0,4,aSKLTc4myTnCxxcJ5dLlBA

A couple buddies and me sat at the bar and the bartender came over and informed us that sunday was 1$ PBR night. Well I was looking forward to a Stella or a Bass, but dam, 1 dollar pbr. So I had a couple of those, we also had some of the homemade potato chips and an order of wings.  The potato chips were really thin and broke easily in the curry which could of had a little more flavor.  The wings were decent, kind of your average bar wings. I'd have to give a low rating on the food, but honestly we only tried those two things and nothing off their traditional menu. I will definitely be back to try those becuase the bartender was really nice. He got our orders right, engaged in a bit of small talk, was able to answer questions I had about their happy hour and offered a sample of Bombadier when I asked what kind of beer it was, having never seen it before. 

The decor is pretty standard, pictures and UK beer decals. They have a little cove for darts and what sounded like a billards table upstairs. They have a board with all their sports offerings, and special events like karaoke and trivia.

However, after eating and waiting for the bill to arrive my friends noticed a HUGE cockroach on my shirt that had come out from the dark recesses of under the table to say hello.

Martini was delivered with no olives and I caught the waitress and told her no olives.

Later I told her that in the future when a martini is served, the olives stay in the drink on the pick.  Guess she didn't serve many martinis.  But I digress.  We started with the garlic mushrooms and a Stilton cheese & crackers plate.  The cheese was good, but the mushrooms were so good we were fighting over them.  I could have made a meal just of those mushrooms.  BF had fish & chips, which he said were good, but not the best ever.  I had lamb stew in Yorkshire pudding, which I thought was fabulous.

301393,2015-04-30,0,Vg1C_1eqwIwkZLIXGMTW3g,"I was looking for a place away from all the overpriced places on the Strip and I had a hankering for fish and chips. Driving down E. Tropicana I saw the Crown and Anchor and it looked like just the place. 
The ambience is just what you'd expect except for the gambling machines that dominate the bar. Oh well , it is Vegas after all. I was greeted and seated immediately and the service remained very good throughout my meal.
The menu looked very tempting and included all of the standard British pub fair. I was very tempted to try the Steak and Mushroom pie, but I was there for the Fish and Chips.
The meal came out very quickly and looked delicious. The fish was maybe haddock and was well cooked, moist and flakey. However the batter had a bitter taste; maybe old oil or maybe aluminized baking powder in the batter, which I'm sensitive to. It was  not overwhelming, but enough that I would not order it again. The chips were great (which maybe points to the batter rater than the oil) and the included peas, well they were peas.
I gave  them a 3, but if I rated then strictly on this  meal it would have been lower. I do have a feeling a different night or a different entre may have been much better. I may give them another shot next time I am in Vegas, maybe the Steak and Mushroom pie  next time",elqme6NdbZ4XxhuTvkxp5Q,1,0,3,dvdqQVtnY5RJfwnPaVmang

330186,2008-03-15,1,Vg1C_1eqwIwkZLIXGMTW3g,"I am a huge fan of C&A, but I have to give it three stars for one major reason--time.  If you are looking to have great  times without dedicating your entire evening to the cause (well, at one place at least!), Crown & Anchor is not for you.  It WILL take you two hours to get three rounds of drinks on a good night.  Err, while I'm at it, I may as well mention parking as well.  I have only lucked out twice with parking at this place, and that was only because I pulled up as someone was pulling out.  On several occasions, my friends and I have parked at Metro across the street or Sherman-Williams and walked over.  Their parking lot is kind of hazardous, anyway.  It's very tight and really difficult to maneuver around in if you get stuck in a sticky place.

But now that I got THAT out of the way (I'm sorry C&A, for I do love you so!), let's get to the goodies.  My friends and I love this place for every reason you could love a pub.  Crown is super cozy and completely raucous at the same time!  When you walk in, you will see people from all walks: older groups enjoy it, the UNLV crowd is pretty big, business people head there after work, and clubbers hit it up for the predancetimebuzz.

Some one mentioned the old wood, and wax, and it takes me back to my Nana Wendy's house.  I sit down and look at the menu and see my family's traditional ""home-cooked"" foods--shepherd's pie, bangers and hash, scotch eggs, cod and chips, curries--for even though I'm from the South, my father and his family are British!

The imported beers list gives a nice sample of the many great UK (and I mean all the countries involved, not just GB) beers, with plenty on tap.  If you're feeling adventurous, the bartender and *some* of the wait staff are very knowledgeable and will happily recommend something to quench what you're thirstin' fer.  

If sitting around outside with a smoke, a beer, and a group of friends at a great pub isn't enough excitement for you, inside they have darts, video poker, and several televisions for your pubbing pleasure.  They also frequently host events aimed at the UNLV crowd, like the British Comedy bash, music, and more.  Hello AbFab costume!!",ScAkGG5VXHNpnMYsGtaadg,2,1,3,ub2jXqQ7wt_VQknt_YcIWQ

335616,2007-06-18,0,Vg1C_1eqwIwkZLIXGMTW3g,"This pub is a Vegas classic. I remember my dad telling me stories when he attended UNLV, and now I have found myself creating my own memories here. Don't come for the food, come here for the drinks. They have so many beers on tap, they have made it into a game. If you decide you want to keep coming back (because you won't finish all in one sitting) then ask for a beer card. There are approximately thirty beers on the card, and you get a stamp for every one you try. The only stipulation is that you cannot try a beer twice. It has to be thirty different beers. I made the mistake of mixing light ales with dark lagers with who knows what else one night to try to fill up my card, and it ended in, well, a mess, if you will. Anyway, it is such a fun place to be (we chose Tuesday nights for our weekly get together) and after dining hours settle, it gets a bit louder, and livelier. Crown and Anchor is the best place around UNLV for groups to get together in a casual atmosphere for fun conversations and drinking. Be careful though. You can get tipsy pretty fast, and nobody wants an accident to happen. We always designate a driver (which always seems to be the party pooper since they cant join in on the debauchery, hehe) and the police always seem to be about. Crown and Anchor is so much fun, but have good fun, be safe!

Recommended drink: The beers on the card. Have your server recommend an order, don't just choose or you will end up in the bathroom all night!

From the cozy pub atmosphere to the selection of drafts available, this is a great place to have a date, hang out with a group of friends, or just chill by yourself.  You can even sit out on the patio and bring your pup!  

There are 30 beers and ciders on tap and the majority of the selection is great. *Cough cough Miller cough*  Sorry, excuse me.  My personal favorite is Blackthorn Cider.  If you're feeling adventurous you can ask them about their ""Down the Hatch"" club. (Hint: you get a prize for trying all the drafts.  I've got 29 more to go).  

The seats at the bar fill quickly, but there are some tables nearby.  The smoke isn't too bad, but then again, I haven't been there when it's really crowded.  Please don't hate me if you inhale a pack of cigarettes on a Friday night.  And while the bartenders are attentive, they aren't super friendly.  I'm going to go ahead and say it's because they are uncomfortable in the ridiculous outfits they have to wear.

You can order from the menu at the bar which might be a good idea if you plan on having more than a couple pints.  Being British food it's not vegetarian friendly, so keep that in mind, my veg friends.  My husband has ordered the Chip Butty which is literally a French fry sandwich.  He likes it and I like to pick at his leftover chips.  They do offer a veggie burger but I just don't feel right eating it in a pub.  For the non-vegetarians, expect Fish and Chips, Bangers and Mash, and various meat pies.

Please be aware that they have lots of rules about what kind of alcohol you can drink at the bar/restaurant/patio.  

Definitely a fun place to stop for a drink!  And it's right next to Pinball Hall of Fame- bonus!

Nikki Jo's Ladies Restroom Review:
While it's clean, I don't like this restroom due to the creep-factor.  They leave the window open (I'm guessing for circulation) but it opens up right next to the employee outdoor break area.  I didn't have luck closing it but that's probably more due to the fact that I was a spazz and had a couple ciders already.  Instead, I covered it up as best as I could with my purse.  Regardless of whether or not it's closed, there is only a lace curtain covering the window ready for any perv to look through.  Not cool.",ELfzWgdf64VBLi5z1ECItw,9,5,4,kQYvjCUZ7icJd35Mbk-86w

It's a nice, relaxing atmosphere, and you can play pool in a quiet second floor game room if you would rather not be at the bar. It does get pretty crowded on weekend evenings, but the service, food, and beer are still good.  They have a sufficient selection of beers with an emphasis on British beers (obviously, considering it's a British pub; however, if you're a beer snob looking for a wider selection of beer and microbrews then you should go to the Freakin' Frog around the corner). 

The negatives for this place are that they have a very small parking lot that often can't accommodate all of their guests, and they are right next to a very dangerous intersection: I've witnessed two car accidents in less than half of a year.  Also, there's no easy way to get here without driving.  The whole point of pubs is that you shouldn't have to drive!

The final, fantastic thing about this place is that it's the only pub I know of in Las Vegas where dogs are allowed (on the outdoor patio, of course)!  I have yet to come across any misbehaving dogs - and fingers crossed it stays that way so they don't get banned!",oG6zUYCWKUy46G6foXnMdA,3,3,4,LcvtsQZTjYznnm069zLyxg

Bianca has horrible customer service.
I asked her for a menu, she asked me to wait for just a moment.
So I stepped back and waited.
But then she started talking to another server, taking her time.
So I asked her if I should just ask someone else, since she was busy.
She rudely told me that she would get it and acted as if it was a privilege to have her help me out (like why was I even asking her for a menu??? I guess she doesn't consider it part of her job??????)
Definitely ruined the night for me.
Not coming back.
At that point I had already ordered a glass of wine, I gave up on ordering food because I didn't want to give my hard earned money to someone so horrid.
We came in with a medium sized group of girls and we were ignored until we flagged a server down.
I don't know if Bianca is really her real name or if she gave me a fake name, but she was wearing a red plaid skirt with a black top with black hair. Super skinny, around 5'2.
Try to get a different server if you get her.
She continued to act as if she was doing me a favor by finally getting me a menu AFTER I told her I wouldn't be needing it anymore (she handed it to me with a ""there, are you happy now?"" kind of attitude).
This review is all over the place because of how mad this girl made me. I literally could not stop shaking with how horrid her customer service was.
Obviously the manager should either have a more rigorous training/hiring process or learn how to fire employees that hurt your business (as I'm sure I'm not the first one swearing never to return due to her rude ass).

EDIT: Hello Richard, thank you so much for replying, it really does make me feel much better to know that you even bothered to read my review. This situation occurred on December 16, 2015 at around 9:50pm on karaoke night.

I've tried the scotch egg, sausage roll and fish and chips when I have gone there (3 times, so far), and they are spot on - none of this fake ""We'll CALL it a pub and give the silly Yanks what they *think* is ""British"" food, which is really just American food"" mentality of so many pseudo English/Irish/whateverish ""pubs"" - this is the real deal - or as real as customs will allow.

You must try the fish and chips - get them with mushy peas, because that's good!

The other thing I've loved about this pub is that you never see any kids there - as a child-free person, this is refreshing and so much more enjoyable than wondering if little Bratleigh will yell, scream, cry, run around and basically ruin everyone else's dinner - Bratleigh's somewhere else - GOD SAVE THE QUEEN!!!

They even have this promotion going on where they give you a punch card and you get it punched once for every country you buy a pint from. After 30 punches you get a t-shirt. They neglected to tell me that it needn't be in one night. I am unsure if I got the t-shirt. 

I have been here several times other than that faithfull night. I have enjoyed breakfast, simple but solid english breakfast. Lunch and diner were top notch. The bangers and mashare at least as good as my usualpub on Maui. 

The kicker is the waitstaff. They always make you feel like a regular. The service at either the tables, the patio, and the bar rivals some of the better establishments on the strip. The naughty schoolgirl thing never hurts either.

I think to enjoy this place you need to be  A) in college and B) have never been to any other pub. Ever.

First off, I expect a pub to serve more than just beer and wine at the bar. To get hard alcohol (ie. Whiskey in my case) you have to sit in the dining area and order food.  Someone cheaped out on a real liquor license and just doesn't care at this point.

Second, the fish + chips I've tried twice here and its completely lackluster. Not worth the hype. It tastes frozen. The chips were mealy, both times. Very middle of the road. Maybe they had a better chef or food distributor a while back when it got voted #1 in Vegas, but there's far better elsewhere.

The jukebox was a little bit crap too. I heard the Police greatest hits for a little too long. Then it was followed by 1990's euro trash techno. Very blah.

On the upside: great atmosphere, great room, nice pool tables. If you're a major beer drinker, then you'll love it. The whiskey drinker in me was disappointed by their liquor policy.",LkcrdEk9-SOBbLXt0-Mvwg,0,1,2,5WHCY5i3tG3bcLLJA7tDGA

Several people started asking him to put the game audio on. He kept making that fingers rubbing together money signal like we needed to pay him.

My boyfriend mentions how he saw a roach crawling up the stairwell. I got gross out at the thought of it but shrugged it off. 

As we continued to wait, I felt something land on my right shoulder and my immediate reaction was to quickly brush it off. I asked my boyfriend if it was a roach and the look on his face answered my question. 

The roach fell from the ceiling and landed on my shoulder! Either it came from upstairs or was crawling on the ceiling, I don't know for sure. We moved to a different table and the waitress brought our drinks and asked if we saw another cricket, we told her what happened and she looked horrified. She apologized and told us that they spray the place once every two weeks. I told her it was okay. When she left I saw two more roaches. One crawling on the wall behind my boyfriend and one underneath the table next to us, barely alive.

All the seats were full at the bar, but there was no one in the little restaurant area aside from the group outside and a few other people just chatting, not eating at a table not too far from where we decided to sit.

First off, we couldn't find someone to seat us which is why we just decided to find an area ourselves. Trying to get one of the waitresses' attention was another thing as well. 
They were darting so fast to the group outside that they completely disregarded us. 
Eventually, someone in our group just decided to try to get her attention because she was so flustered at the fact that we had been waiting so long and the only table that appeared to have ordered anything was a group outside.

I ended up ordering the Mozzarella sticks while everyone else got chicken fingers and/or curry.

Our meal took a good while. At least, it felt like it. We burned through so many conversations that I began to wonder if our server had gotten our order out.

She finally came around and brought us our food. Keep in mind that during this whole time, everyone at the table had already gotten through their drinks and she had walked past us quite a handful of times and not once even asked us if we wanted any other drinks.

Mozzarella sticks were the BOMB.com. 
The guys liked the chicken fingers, however, the curry order was wrong. It was ordered without chicken but had so much of it that our friend wasn't happy with it at all.

We finished our food (except the curry plate) and still had to wait for our server to even check up on us.
The service on a scale of 1-10 was at a 3 for me.
I completely understand that she was checking up constantly on the group outside, being that they were a larger group, but if I had known she wouldn't have shown us the same courtesy, I would've opted to go to another pub or bar instead.
Treat your customers right. All we wanted was to just be checked up on and offered drinks. It wouldn't have been anything complicated. What's annoying to me is that she preferred to give another group good service, but couldn't even provide us with basic service. How are you so sure we wouldn't have left a great tip for you just for checking up on us as you were darting by? Instead, we were ignored. 
The fact that it wasn't even busy, let alone she wasn't the only server there is just the icing on top of it all.

I'm not sure the food is worth coming back for.
In all honesty, I'm the type of person who if I go to a cool bar/pub/restaurant/etc. I always share it with people and bring them back with me.
My first experience was mediocre. Pretty disappointing.

Some of the food is quite authentic (sausage roll, all-day breakfast), and I tend to focus on this. It's quite good at being quite like stuff from England. Especially the bacon and sausage. 

Sadly the pies offered are pot-pies rather than having a full-crust. And the chips are frozen rather than fresh cut or even better twice-cooked.

Crown and Anchor showed up so we decided to give it a try. We came in on Monday night for the all you can eat. First off they need to update their prices online, for the amounts are different. To get on with the story though we walked right in and were able to sit down immediately which was nice. The waitress was at our table within 2 min or so and we ordered beverages and our food right away. My friends water was there within 3-5min or so, my coke however took almost 20 min to show up. After that it took another 20 min for our fish (keep in mind this was AYCE so the fish should be ready quick. After getting our fish, i kid you not it was 40 min before our waitress even stopped back needless to say we had been waiting and trying to ask her for fish for 20min at least. We talk to her and fish is there then somehow within only 5 min. It was then another 20 before we see her again and ask for our check. For anyone that took the time to read this, i really hope that we were an exception and nobody else goes through this. The service as a whole sucked. The people on either side sucked (relationship fighting, and a guy talking in a terrible British accent). In whole dinner took around 2 hours.

From the quizzical looks I get when I wear my Cesc Fabregas Arsenal jersey in public, to the ""huh?"" I get from bartenders at other bars when I ask if they can put a soccer match on, being a soccer fan is sometimes like being the red-headed stepchild.

Which is why I love this place so much.  Simply put, this is the best British Pub I have ever been to.  It isn't a big bar by most standards, but it's very homely and it just feels warm to be inside.  They have pool, darts and foosball for those interested in bar games.  They do have video poker like in most bars these days, but this is a bar better for socializing or watching a match than playing poker.  

I just got back today from watching Arsenal play Barcelona in a UEFA Champions League match, and while the place was pretty empty when I got there 20 minutes before match time, practically all the seats were taken by kickoff.  The British Burger I ordered was absolutely delicious, and next time I must try the fish and chips.  Even though it was noonish, the people watching the match were rowdy and fun, and despite the intensity of a hugely important match were for the most part friendly.  While the fans are passionate and intense, you probably don't have to worry about brawls breaking out.

The only bad thing I can say about this place is that the parking lot of quite small and cramped.  If you're going here to watch a match, be sure to get there early, as it fills pretty fast, particularly if it's a popular club or country playing (I.E. Manchester United, Chelsea, Liverpool, Arsenal or England's National Team).  Besides, the smaller lot probably encourages designated driving, so you can experience those many beers and get home safely :)

-Authentic British pub decor

They have a wide variety of beers to choose from, as well as hard liquor. However, you have to remember that you cannot order hard liquor at the bar, only beer.

For an appetizer, my party shared a ""Giant Yorkshire Pudding"".  My mother had a British boyfriend when I was young and she made him Yorkshire pudding. This one was better than some I've had, but not as good as ""Mom used to make"". But since those weren't authentically ""Authentic"" it's tough to deduct points for it.  They got cold quick, but that was probably because of the ""Giantness"" 

Probably the best Scotch Eggs I've ever had are here. And you can get them cold OR warm (I personally recommend warm).

I also had the Fish and Chips (Since I was going for ""The Classic"" British Style) and they were good.  Just one fish, but it was a pretty big fillet, so no complaints.

We finished it off with Sticky Toffee Pudding which was great!

Through all of this, the ONE waitress kept on top of a pretty busy place.  Considering she was the only one waiting tables her performance was extraordinary. Though as an understandable side effect, service was a bit slow and a member of the party never got the coffee she ordered with the Pudding.

The beer is good and plentiful; although they did run out of St George Ale just before St Georges day (that's what i call bad planning!) and the selection covers most of the known world; why they even have some luke warm gnats piss that the yanks know as beer! (Lol I'm gonna get lunched now!! ;p ) 

The best thing is on Mondays they do ALL YOU CAN EAT FISH AND CHIPS, OK so it doesn't come with mushy peas, but it's a damn good representation of the dish, and they do use cod (none of that haddock b@llocks here my friends.) 

The appetisers are a little odd, sausage roll, chip butty and scotch eggs to name a few; for those of you who think this is standard faire will be sadly mistaken. A scotch egg and sausage roll is used for picnicking and the chip butty is a cheap student dinner. A true British appetiser or starter is...prawn cocktail with Marie rose sauce, Heinz cream of tomato soup, stuffed garlic mushrooms and pate on toast (not all together of course!!), the main dishes are more authentic, i can recommend the steak and mushroom pie and the roast dinner on Sundays ONLY!!

The whole time he looked like an angry mess that was about to blow up on somebody. We had to track him down for water refills and he was so annoyed every time we called him. Dude, if you hate your job so much why are you working in customer service? And to whoever manages this dump you really need to train your employees on how to assist customers with a bit of respect and a damn smile.

After 10 minutes we finally got our shots. After some time sitting and catching up, I walked up to the bar to place an order for a happy-hour British Burger. After asking me what I wanted, he interrupted me to say ""hold on I got like seven other orders"" and I waited and waited. Finally, he took my order and just seemed annoyed with me. Annoyed when I told him I wanted extra pickles... Annoyed when I told him I wanted cheese. Just annoyed. Clearly Brian wasn't aware that we were...

My proximity suggested I pay my first visit to Crown & Anchor on Trop. On the bucket-list since lots of Yelp colleagues have been praising the dining there. If the graveyard cook is on-point, then dinner certainly going to measure up.

I ordered ""the graveyard burger."" That's just $5.95 for a 8-ounce, cheesed-up, baconed-up, tasting-of-charcoal, juicy piece of meat, with a side of pretty-crispy steak fries. Yeah - this WAS a good idea! 

Jason, the bartender attending, offered up intelligent convo before & after my plate. Much more than other graveyard mixologists often muster.

Since I am not big on either drinking or sports, to me this space would be about the food. 

But if I urged to tap a Guinness Stout (my beer of choice when I do imbibe) ... here would certainly be a good spot for it.

Only a few stools were being warmed, not surprisingly at this time-of-morning. But, according to Jason, if you want to party with college students at 1am ... or if you want to slip away from the nearby Strip to take in a live Euro soccer game at 7am with your team's jersey & some pub-grub ... this venue also qualifies well.

Me, I'll be back at some point to take in the dinner menu. The burger sold it. And I found out there is an AYCE Fish-n-Chips deal, 5pm-midnight on Mondays. 

Ummm. AYCE. My favorite culinary monogram.

Oh, it's a British pub concept throughout. But you already knew that.

UPDATE: I've been back to test the AYCE Fish-n-Chips deal. Not too exciting actually. One plank, then the refills one plank each. Not near as tasty/crispy/greasy as found the Village Pubs.

Eggs were cooked properly, although I wish our plates had been served a little hotter. Overall, another great meal at Crown & Anchor on Trop.

I have been going to crown for about 10 years and haven't been there in 2 years until today. I talked about how awesome the fish and chips were and it was just mediocre and missing a filet. Honestly, I only got one filet that was a greased up hunk of cod with frozen french fries severed along with frozen rare peas for $13. Then my wife had cottage pie and it tasted like ground beef without seasoning in cheap gravy topped with basic mash potatoes and different well done frozen peas. Honestly the peas were two different colors on our two plates. I would go back to drink but not to eat until they get there stuff together again.

Service with a flash, but definitely not IN a flash, waiting 5 minutes and still not even taking a drink order? 

I'm sure my husband (along with all the others) really don't mind the show, and honestly, I'm not totally offended, its just not necessary. Showing my husband and I your cooch won't get you better tips, wrong venue for this. Even if I had the body for it, I would never be willing to wear their ""uniform"". 

I've been here before and noticed the skirts were low, dut I don't remember seeing so much butt flesh. Maybe I just wasn't paying as much attention?

Both the hubs and I ordered the fish and chips. We didn't notice until after our meal that Monday's (when we went) are all you can eat fish and chips. I guess that's why the server asked if we'd like another order of fish, but it wasn't made clear that it was a special. Partly our bad for not checking the specials, but also poor service for not informing your customers of the special. 

I wasn't overly impressed. The steak fries were decent, though not cooked enough for me. I like a little bit of crunch in my fries, not a mouth full of mush. I guess they thought they'd make up for it in my fish? My first piece of fish was SOOOOO overcooked that there was no resemblance of actual fish in about half of the piece. All the meat was so crispy, I seriously thought it was all breading - until I took a closer look. I could have complained and asked for another piece of fish... had we had anything that resembled service. 

I guess I would probably go back sometime to see if anything has changed (I enjoyed the chicken curry the last time I was there - ages ago)... but it's not high on my list of places to spend my hard earned money.",sDlRFzGHzfpFHaxvJ1JtTg,2,3,2,lp2RTVbOzKinF-sy1kalIA

Now, Vegas doesn't have a perfect pub.  The main problem in our city is that every pub ruins its ambiance by installing those damn video poker machines in the bar.  And part of the greatness of a pub is a spacious wooden bar (uncluttered by anything except empty pints). So in Vegas, we already start a star down (try resting your elbow on the bar with those blocky video poker machines in the way).

But when you lower the bar for Vegas, Crown & Anchor is an excellent choice.  They have a solid selection of British, Irish and American beers and a decent whiskey collection.  Add in a nice dart board and a solid crowd of good-humored patrons.  Head there for a big soccer match or rugby match and you'll find a nice batch of rowdy fans yelling at a television.  It's comfortable and fun, with tasty fried food and drinks.  What you'd expect from a good pub.

And there are some advantages to drinking in a Vegas pub.  Like all successful Vegas businesses, Crown & Anchor has perfected the art of hiring sexy wait staff.  The staff is very easy on the eyes and a vast improvement from the brown teeth and rolly-polly figure you'd find in jolly ol' England.",wOSHvuJEJflUEesNLno51A,2,2,4,OVwoHGkW5uGNXK0NBy3ORw

2023400,2015-10-12,0,Vg1C_1eqwIwkZLIXGMTW3g,"For years me and family members have driven past here and have always wanted to try the experience. I pretty much guessed beforehand going into this that the place would be a little divey since after all it's a pub, however I wasn't prepared for how my meal here went. Walking up to the entrance you see their patio area for pets which I think is a cute idea but then seeing the grass having huge divots and holes with standing water in them going stagnant made me feel like I would never want my dog to visit here. Then came walking inside. We waited to be seated since there is a sign kindly requesting you wait to be helped, well waiting we did, then waiting some more & some more which felt strange since there was only maybe 10 other guests there tops. The hostess was kind, I was surprised to see how hiked up her skirt was but again I thought ""well this is a pub in Las Vegas"" so I wasn't upset. She was kind enough to take our drink orders and return with them a short time later, when she came back she took our meal orders: bangers & mash and fish & chips. We then waited a long time to see the hostess/waitress again it was about 40 minutes for our food, which wouldn't have been a big deal if the food we got back was hot and appetizing. The bangers & beans were Luke warm and the mash was cold with cold gravy where it's more like meat flavored jello than gravy. The fish & chips were okay in the sense that yes it's fried and a huge piece of fish but I wasn't expecting it to be soaked in oil when I received it and the side of peas appeared fine until I watched a small fly crawl out of them and fly away. Trying to make the best of it with my guest we decided to have the food be taken away and we dared enough to try dessert which was probably the only thing we did enjoy. The things I failed to mention through out this review is that while sitting there the entire time we really took in how filthy the place is with holes in the wall, dirty light switches and scuffs everywhere and creaky filthy floors & A LOT of spider webs everywhere A LOT. The tables are spaced out about 2 ft apart which wasn't a big deal, but my prior mention of the hostesses uniform made it uncomfortable when she bent over to fix up the table next to us which was also odd considering the place setting I was seated at was already dirty from someone else eating on it. I think the worst part of all was leaving their one way parking lot and seeing the back door being held wide open with a rope, immediately all of my food handling knowledge & certifications kicked into high gear knowing that open doors are a EXTREME no no because it allows pests of all kinds directly in. All & all its not a place I would go back to and it made me feel awful that I actually invited someone to join me without checking it beforehand, I won't be returning & nothing could make me desire too. So much more happened but I'm done talking about it. I dined in on 10/10/15 around 2:45pm",d-r2DiqbY3cR-GI2F13vAw,0,0,1,0Gs-wUJSrwzTMs-kE5zcAw

The service is always friendly and fairly attentive. Parking can be tight when it's crowded. The bar area is nice. The restaurant area is ho-hum, but not cramped.

They have karaoke one night of the week, trivia one night of the week, etc. So there's always something going on here. While close to UNLV, it's definitely not too much of a college crowd.

The only thing was I left smelling like cigarette smoke and it lingered. Other then that I was super satisfied with everything. Good old local spot that is also a cool attraction for visitors. Price were decent and the accents of the servers are on point!

We came over on a late Wednesday night and got seating right away. Walking in a small hallway with then English flag swagging in the entrance instantly transport you to a drunken good time in a pub in England. There is a small bar low ceilings and lots of wood work.

The waitress mostly all wore red plaided skirts. The menu was completely fitting but I don't remember if they offered Beef Wellingtons if so I would've been all over it.

Never the less I had my old English (Old-fashion)and the Scotch Egg aka a hard boiled egg encased in a meat. I ordered it warm but it is also served cold but I'm not sure how that would taste, the server suggested not to order cold unless you actually grew up eating it that way. The egg soaked up all the good flavor of the meat and the ground tender meatball type casing was so good. 

The Fish and chips were yummy flaky batter and fries were just thick cut was fresh warm and crispy skin with soft potato inside. The mash and gravy served with the herb chicken was so tasty. 

I will be back for sure to try everything else like the flaky crust beef and mushroom pie and lamb stew and Yorkshire pudding omg looks so bomb.

Service was A BIT SLOW, and they were NOT that busy.  However, this seems to be a recurring factor in Vegas.  No one seems to move.  Maybe it is just that I am from the NYC area and like things promptly.

I must admit I really do look forward to the chip butty they do (which is basically fries on a buttered roll), great at 6am whilst watching a game!  The rest of the food I've had there is ok, nothing special...haven't tried the fish n chips but as with pretty much anywhere Stateside, the chips aren't 'chip shop' chips, more like 'steak fries'.

The TVs they have for the 'footy' are kinda crap though, especially in the room on the way to the patio, very poor.  Speaking of the patio, I do miss being home in England and having a pint in the sunshine, so this really does hit the spot!

As with a lot of bars in Vegas, I find the service isn't the best, kinda slow as the bar staff of course want to take care of their gaming customers first.  I guess I find it too English at times, especially when there's a big boxing fight in town, it's full of Brits singing shite songs and being obnoxious, something I don't miss about living in England!

They have plenty of beers on tap or in bottles, and offer a full menu worth of food.  The food is British pub style, so don't expect an abundance of spice or anything healthy on the menu, but it is what it is.  I go here for the atmosphere, it's what a great hangout pub should be.  It can get a bit loud when they have their DJ's making it difficult to chat with anyone more than one seat down, but during it's quieter hours (before 10 pm) I think it's the perfect place to have a drink and settle in, maybe play a round of darts or pool with the posse.

The waitresses here aren't the most helpful. They don't seem too knowledgeable when it comes to knowing whether or not they have certain brews on draught or if they have ginger beer, etc. They also take too long to ask if you need help. Poor service!!!

There also seemed to be some odd ""rules"" here about where they could and couldn't serve alcoholic beverages. They said it had something to do with their liquor license but it sounded like some BS to us.

Well, let's just say we stopped by their this afternoon for a wee bit o'food coming back from McCarran and oh my was I disappointed.  

Now, there is no doubt they have an excellent selection of draught beers and I quite enjoyed my Belgian wheat beer, but sad to say, the Mrs, had an ice tea and she had to get a Sprite, because the tea tasted like water, yuck!

Anyway on to the food.  Again like another poster mentioned, the fish & chips were just kind of sad.  I mean here we are sitting in the middle of supposedly  Her Majesty's finest establishment expecting British excellence and the fish seemed like something that had been bought at a Costco.  

OK, you are right, this is the middle of the Mojave Desert and there ain't no friggin' ocean anywhere near here, but come on, I have had better frozen fish at lots of places that are far from the sea.

Now on to my Ploughman's Lunch.  Oh, how I do like a Ploughman's plate, and to tell the truth they did do a wee bit better here than they do with the fish.  But the bread was dry and almost stale, and  the cheddar cheese tasted like something you'd buy at a supermarket.  Now the Stilton was a nice piece of cheese, though not the best bleu cheese I have had but not the worst either.  The tomato was fresh, but I was a bit expecting the beets to be pickled but they were just cold cooked beat slices.

Service was fine, though nothing spectacular.  The young lass who served us did a good job, but she didn't provide excellent service, it was just kind of a step above adequate.

Again, I really wanted to like the place.  The atmosphere is cool in a corny kind of a way.

This pub has character. Although it has not been opened for long ( I think I saw something that said 1980s or 90s), it feels like its been around for a very long time.

The dining room is very small and when its at capacity you'll have to wait for a table.  Your best bet is to get a seat at the bar.  At the time of my visit, the waitresses were a bit overwhelmed.  We told the waitress that we'd wait for a table at the bar.  I guess she forgot about us because she sat a party that came though the door before sitting us who were waiting; so, we just opted for sitting at the bar.  

The bar tender on the other hand, was super nice.  He ended taking our order and noticing that our food had not come out, compensated our wait with a beer.

Of note is the locals and their understated like for the video poker.  Keep an eye on them, its fun to watch them play.

Let's start with the pasty that one of the diners had. I can't comment truthfully on this because the pasties that I've had all my life living in Michigan are made differently but these were still good. So I'm just partial to the different way of making them.  Have to admit they were large and well-made with a generous amount of mashed potatoes and brown gravy.  Forgot to mention we started with a cup of their incredibly delicious creamed cabbage and Stilton soup. Wow! 

The rest of us had their much touted fish and chips and that I can tell you I've had many,many times in many,  many places but these were exceptionally good.
One very large,  thick piece of perfectly done, fresh Icelandic cod lightly breaded-and one was enough. One diner and I substituted the fries for onion rings which we both loved.  The fish and chips come with a generous portion of peas... Very English indeed.
Service was outstanding from the minute we walked in until the minute we left. Our waitress Jessica was not only very friendly and outgoing but treated us like guests in her home.  We definitely will go back and we hope we get Jessica again.

3087736,2017-06-02,0,Vg1C_1eqwIwkZLIXGMTW3g,"This is definitely the best bar in the area. It has a ton of British charm, European and domestic beers, awesome British food, jukebox, darts, patio, trivia night... What more could you ask for? We usually only come here for trivia night on Thursdays but I've also brought my dog to the patio when it's not too hot out. I always get the Hoegaarden because there aren't many places in town that have it on draft. Chips (french fries) and curry sauce are also a must to snack on. I've had the cornish pastie a few times and it's a delicious and filling meal. I ordered the steak and mushroom pie the last time I was in but I still prefer the cornish pastie. It's wrapped up like a hot pocket vs. inside a deep dish covered in flaky crust. The steak and mushroom pie was a lot runnier and I prefer having flaky crust in every bite vs. more filling.
 I've also been to the all you can eat fish and chips on Mondays. They give you a huge piece of fish to start and after that they give you smaller pieces, but it's definitely enough food.  

The inside is built like a tavern or wooden cabin. The bar layout is a little strange with a seating area in front of the bar that can only be accessed from one direction. There's a dining room, outdoor patio, and dart area. There are also two staircases that go to upstairs lofts. I've gone up the stairs above the dining room (more dining) but I've never been to the side above the dart area. Are there pool tables up there? I never see anyone up there. So mysterious... 

Trivia night is a little deceiving if you've been to any other trivia nights in town. It runs from 9-10 and it consists of only 10 questions. You get a $50 bar tab if you win. It's a casual activity to partake in over a few beers and a late dinner. The one thing that seems to throw everyone off at Crown is that they don't serve shots or any liquor at the bar. The sign on the chalkboard says you must be at a table with food, though the bartenders explain it as you just have to be at a table outside of the bar area and they will bring the liquor over to you. 

The Crown and Anchor is a solid bar with friendly staff, great beer selection, and delicious British food. Everyone seems to have a good time and it's not incredibly smoky and antisocial like most every other neighborhood bar. It does seem to attract a lot of foreign tourists which is interesting because it's not super close to the Strip and there aren't other bars in the area to bar hop to. It makes it fun though as you can strike up a conversation with a lot of cool people.",rYPjqZO89ABei1fsZBSUbA,3,0,5,PwL-VSt8Lf6YJ-2FnBQyqw

I really don't appreciate you attacking me personally and using my name in your review! I am not a degenerate and I don't care for your roid rage comment. You see I recognize your picture and I realize that customers get jealous of the way I look and feel the need to knock me with their roid rage comments, but I understand. Maybe the next time we run into each other you can explain the roid rage and degenerate comment! Look forward to seeing you.

PREVIOUS REVIEW:It literally pains me to give a 2 star review but our service the past 4ish times have been utterly unacceptable. We tend to stay clear from the bar because the bartender Rob is such a degenerate mess. He is constantly gambling, slamming the machines, and going on a full roid rage. He's even broken machines before by slamming his fists on them after losing. All while bartending mind you. 

So we choose to sit in the restaurant area. I'm not sure why the waitresses just can't get it together,  but waiting 20+ minutes for a side of BBQ sauce, then another 20+ minutes for our bill is rediculous. Don't even get me started on how long the drinks take.. tonight was an utter disaster. The ending was the cherry on top to a horrible experience  when the waitress disappeared with our credit card. When we couldn't find her I went to a tall blonde waitress and asked if she could possibly locate our credit card so we could leave. Before I even got the chance to finish my sentence she cut me off and said ""do you just want to talk to a manager?"" I said no, I just wanted to pay our bill. She stormed off and we never saw her again. Our waitress eventually came back but this turned into an almost 30 minute ordeal. 

Like I said it pains me to give such a bad review, the food is amazing (especially the fish n chips) and they have a great beer selection and we've been going to this bar for years.

It wasn't until my junior year that I went with a few friends to have a drink at this quaint littler tavern, and oh my God was I surprised.

On the outside it seems like a sleepy little pub on the outskirts of London, but on the inside is anything but.  The Establishment is divided into two main sections: a dining room and the bar area.  My friends and I decided to get a bit to eat first and participate in drunken debauchery afterword (Just Kidding (*Wink)).  

The dining room had the best of both worlds; the look and feel of an authentic British pub, with four huge Widescreen TVs on each corner of the room, blaring out endless sports center highlights from the day.  The waitresses were dressed in skimpy little outfits and actually knew some of the girls on a personal level from school.  The service was great, but not excellent.  They were very nice to me and my buddies, probably because we were friends, but the service could improve if the hosts and waitresses would treat the other patron with the same level of costumer service.

The best part about his restaurant was the food.  I had Fish and Chips and I have to say that they were the best damn Fish and Chips I have ever had period.  I have been      here many time since then and I swear the food gets better every time.  They also have a huge selection of assorted British beers which I have to admit is pretty damn awesome.

If you're like me and don't like peas, you can have them get you some extra fries instead at no extra charge.

All of the menu items are tasty and moderately priced. The fish and chips is fluffy and crusted with a batter that isn't too heavy. Getting a burger with Stilton cheese on it is worth the visit alone. Unless you really like chips(fries) I would recommend the Crown Crisps, they are homemade potato chips and are super addictive.
 I had never tried kidneys before, but the steak and kidney pie is delicious. Expect to spend around $30-$40 for two, and a little more if one is drinking.

Speaking of drinking, they have a full bar and 30 beers on tap. Ranging from lagers to IPAs, to the dark beers and even some ciders. About the only thing that would make it better is if they would put Strongbow on draft, currently they only have it in a bottle... which is a vastly subpar way to drink Strongbow.

Service has always been on point every time I've come here. Lesley is one of the best bartenders around, pouring alcohol for all of one's needs. If you choose to dine at a table and are lucky enough to get Catherine as your server, then you'll be getting some of the best service in Vegas.

But if you ever get the chance to make it to the Crown during the World Cup (especially for a match between England and the US like we had just this past summer), you will have definitely have an experience you won't soon forget.

The atmosphere in the place at 4am was better than any place in the U.S. anytime of day for (insert lame sport here). Chants were being sung. Taunting was taking place from table to table, just before friendly handshakes and rounds being bought for one another. The greatest part of that night/morning had to be at about 7am. We stumbled outside to see the sun up already. Down the parking lot a bit there were 4 British guys. One of which was completely obliterated, yet still felt he could do a jumping spin kick into his friends face. He proceeds to pull down his pants to his knickers. Leaving his black socks on mind you.

It can be difficult at times in a big city to find local hangouts, however I fortunately have a UK mate living here who had already sussed the place out and found it up to his British pub standards. Better yet, as I was staying at the Embassy Suites by UNLV I could easily stroll over and avoid driving.

The C&R is basically everything you want in a local pub with an excellent pub atmosphere, a great selection of beers, imported and domestic and a decent pub menu. My friend went for the curry on chips and I played it safe w/ a curry on rice. Although the curry is not quite London or Adelaide fare, none-the-less the dish was more than adequate (I settled for chicken as lamb or seafood were not available), all things considered. 

I would also prefer to have optionally mild, medium, hot or flaming arse curries served rather than the rather less than mild version served. Additionally a variety of curries such as seafood, lamb and veggie would be a nice touch.

With UNLV so close by a curry night would not be out of the question. I was present for an Adelaide pub's (The Exeter) introduction of curry night in 2000, c.f. http://adelaide.citysearch.com.au/restaurants/viewContent/1119945819643/1137463277210, an event that remains wildly popular to this day.

For an appetizer, I got a sausage roll, a spiced sausage wrapped and baked in a flaky pastry.  The sausage came sliced and was accompanied by a dish of mustard sauce that was excellent.  It really gave the sausage a nice flavor although it was good without the mustard.

For the mains, all three of us got steak and kidney pie.  This was a first for me and I enjoyed it a lot.  The steak cubes were very tender and the kidney had a very smooth texture and was quite flavorful.  The pie was topped by a flaky crust and it was piping hot.  (Sweeney Todd fans will get that).  With the pie comes mashed potatoes and gravy and a healthy serving of peas.  It turns out to be a large and filling meal.

  My husband is of Scottish heritage and wanted to check out British pubs. I found the Crown and Anchor on Tropicana Ave. Reckon we struck solid gold!!!!!!  
  It was everything we could have wanted from the atmosphere to the pub grub. I had always wanted to try the Yorkshire pudding and was very happy to see it on the menu and with 2 sides of sauces no less! We were so satisfied, we returned again later that week! A regular haunt if we do move there. 
  The wait staff were fantastically nice and helpful. Our server was Tracy, and she was great! The prices were very good for the quality and portions of the food. We tried many sides, the stuffed potato skins, the fish and chips, the stilton cheese platter, the yorkshire pudding and kept looking at what others around us were ordering.  They have quite a large pub food menu to choose from. 
  We sat next to four people visiting from England, and they said they loved it and  had been there countless times before, when visiting Las Vegas. It WILL definitely be one of our favorite pub/restaurants in Las Vegas!

Once we got there we realized something horrifying:  the air conditioner was BARELY on!  Then to make matters even worse NOBODY took our order for a good TEN MINUTES while we sat there (yes, I DID keep track, thank you!)...

So why the HELL would I give such a lame place four stars?  Probably 4.5 to be exact?  Because C&A is just what I miss about London and definitely lived up to high expectations!

Decor is wild.  Definitely reminded me of the drunken stumbles around Notting Hill during World Cup '06.  It felt VERY pub-esque and I loved it so much.  Beer selection is...  eh?  Well let's just say that if you love them English-style beers then you're in heaven.  It was hard to break from the black and tans (especially for hopheads like my brother and myself) so we didn't -- which was fine.  LOTS of weekly specials...  Kind of makes me wish I was either a UNLV student or a casino industry worker.  Or that at least I lived around here to make it out for their occasional food and drink specials.  Or at least to be able to enjoy soccer (sorry, but there is already another sport in this country called 'football' ... TM Justin Timberlake @ the ESPYs) on the numerous TVs.  But the food, jeez, the FOOD!!!

Fish and chips.  Cod was fried EXACTLY the way we love it -- and my bro and I BOTH agreed that it's way better than the Olde Ship's (British pub-ish place here in Orange County) fish.  Thin, crispy outside, flaky yumminess of fish on the inside.  Tartar sauce was perfect.  Fries were perfect.  We chose to throw most of the peas into my chicken curry.  Speaking of which...  chicken curry!  Kind of what I expected -- not spicy, good flavor -- but soooo much food!  I chose to order it on the rice since my brother already had chips.  Good call.  Perfect consistency in the potatoes, LOVED the mushrooms, chunks of chicken were a good size.  It was just SO FILLING!

The night's ultimate experience, however, came in the form of an impromptu ""Today's Special"" dessert:  the sticky toffee pudding was proudly displayed on the night's chalkboard.  Sooo...  what were we to do?  And DEAR GAWD did we make an excellent decision.  The toffee sauce is TO DIE FOR.  I absolutely despise raisins but I stuffed them in my mouth as far as this culinary sinfulness was concerned.  Bread pudding-ish + buttery toffee moat + whipped cream + raisins = one of the most delightful sweets I'd EVER had in my life!

We were so stuffed we couldn't even order another beer.  We were so food comatose that we had to get back to the Tropicana and take a nap before going out for the *night*...  And even though the service was HELLA slow (to use the parlance of our times), and the beer selection is essentially the LAST straw for a hophead, and it took the bar forever to call our return taxi...  I give C&A a proud 4.5 stars, especially since I fell in love with London a couple years ago and this joint is the closest thing to London for me :)",l-fe24FmqxPW1i0Jaii3ZA,2,1,4,Hpf0JggHQSeeUH6fYz-9-Q

However after I started attending UNLV a few years ago, I rediscovered the place after realizing it was so close to the campus.  

I would highly recommend the Steak and Mushroom pie, and you definitely can't go wrong with the fish and chips either.  The staff are very friendly, I'm always seated quickly, and the wait for food usually isn't too long.  Most recently, Jess was my waitress and she was very friendly and attentive.  I'm a serviceman, but unfortunately they don't offer military discounts, something that I would appreciate seeing.  However, they do offer discounts for UNLV personnel which I take advantage of.  The ambience is casual and a little old fashioned (which I like), and it makes for a great stop at just about any time of day or night.  The music usually isn't too loud, so your not struggling to carry on a conversation with the person next to you.  I also enjoy looking at the Naval-oriented artwork and decoration on the walls and ceiling, it only adds to the authenticity of the pub.

My first visit was for the U.S.-England game it was an awesome experience.  Even though the U.S. fans were out numbered a bit we represented.  Besides a couple cheeky remarks everyone got along wonderfully.  

Second visit to C&A was for the the U.S.-Algeria game, and unless you are a hermit we all know what happen that game.  Epicness happened.  When Donovan scored that goal it was absolute bedlam.  It is was one of the greatest moments of my life.  What a great feeling to celebrate something like that with your fellow countrymen and women.  But just like the England game all I had was beer.

I came here a few times when I was in college at UNLV (back in the day, I remember how small it was- small parking lot too- and that it was busting at the seams- another location opened near Chinatown BTW). Our most recent visit was when a good friend was moving to another state- it's her favorite bar. I didn't eat- it was a little too late for me. A couple of our friends did and their food looked good. I did sample a few fries. We had a couple drinks while remembering all the good times. The server was really nice and came around often, checking on us. Since it was wednesday night, it was karaoke night- which made it more fun- it's great hearing people perform- some people are so animated. We hung out for a few hours. There was a good crowd but it wasn't as crowded as it would be on a weekend, I imagine. 

I am interested in trying the fish and chips sometime, since I hear that it is a specialty of theirs- being an authentic British pub and all. The atmosphere is rich dark woods and heavy furniture (chairs). It is a little dark inside too.

For example, one time when I ordered a Black and Tan, the waitress came by and apologized for it taking so long. Then she sold out the bartender and told me that he didn't even know how to make one! Made fun of him for having trouble with googling it. Very awkward. Another time our waitress seemed to be mad that a friend had gotten his first drink at the bar. She never ever asked him if he wanted another drink when his glass was empty, even after I pointed it out to her that he would like to order something. 

Full disclosure: I hate English food so the sheppard pie I got here, I was not a fan. I just don't like English food. I don't really hold it against them because I don't think I am the best judge of this type of food.

Crown & Anchor is located down the street from UNLV. The outside is well lit and easy to find. At the bar, you can only order beer. The pool table and darts are also located on the bar side. But in the separate dining area, you can order food and spirits. This is due to their grandfathered liquor license. Not a big deal for me, but it just sucks when your party is eating in the dining area, everyone has to migrate over to the other side if they want to play darts. They also have karaoke on Wednesday nights. If it wasn't for the place being a little smokey, this would have gotten 5 stars from me.

As for the food, everything we have tried has been delicious. My favorite thing so far has been the fish and chips. The fish is flaky and moist with a nice crunchy breading. The French fries are hot and crispy. And you know how I know the food is good here? I usually hate peas, like literally hate peas. The fish and chips come with a side of peas and they are freaking delicious! They aren't mushy at all. I ate the whole bowl.

I ordered the fish and chips, which came with baked beans and ""fresh"" peas, and my friend ordered a lamb stew with yorkshire pudding.  Sounds tasty, huh?  Keep reading...  

Well, the fish was NOT seasoned at all.  Although the crust was crunchy, the cod fillet was drenched in grease.  Next, the baked beans were flavorless and obviously canned.  Finally,  my peas tasted like they were once frozen, but they had an old, dry and starchy taste.  They, too were not seasoned at all.  In the end, if you like fried fish, I would recommend FRESHLY prepared Long John SIlvers to this...OR even visiting the ""hole in the wall"" in Northtown called Marios Market (MLK/Lake Mead).  The catfish there is AMAZING and made with love.

Now, my friend ordered the lamb stew prepared in a yorkshire pudding bowl.  Would you believe the stew was NOT lamb, but BEEF (my friend is a trained chef...he knows!)  ANYONE who eats lamb can recognise its distinctive, slightly gamey flavor).   And when it arrived at the table in the yorkshire pudding bowl, the stew was cool inside the bowl...as if the ""chef"" hadn't microwaved it long enough.  Really?!  How long had THAT been sitting around!  Even the yorkshire pudding was soggy and old, like it was made a few days ago.

So, when we informed the waitress that the stew contained beef instead of lamb, she trotted off, frustrated, and returned 15 minutes later and said...""Yep...the chef says it's lamb.  YOU can SAY it's beef all day long...but I'M TELLING you it's lamb.""  When I asked her if she had ever eaten lamb before, she responded ""No...I don't like stuff like that.  But the chef told me the stew was made with lamb.""  Hmmm.

The waitress then grew rude and condescending, as if she was exasperated by our inquiries.  At least she replaced my friend's ""lamb"" stew with a dry, overcooked steak sandwich, which was again unseasoned.  Some ""chef"" they have at the Crown & Anchor, huh?!

What's most disappointing about my experience at the Crown & Anchor British Pub was that I'd been wanting to visit this place for some time now.  I love fish and chips, and I've seen theirs touted as being so delicious.  Hogwash!  They must be paying people to post those comments.

4488948,2009-08-10,0,Vg1C_1eqwIwkZLIXGMTW3g,"I would probably give this place between a 3.5 stars and a 4.0.

Food: I had an avocado and turkey sandwich that came with French fries. I thought the avocado was fine, but the bread was a bit dry. I would have preferred less fries and instead maybe a cold slaw side or some salad side accompanying it. 3.0 for the food.

Beer: Both my friend and I had the summer ale. I have to say that it was pretty good. I forgot to ask them if they brewed it themselves, but this pub has an extensive list of beer including imports. The summer ale is a special and it included a dose of citrus. Pretty good light beer. I normally don't drink and even I thought this was refreshing.

Service: Our waitress was very friendly. She also invited my friend and I to the quiz night going on that evening even though we did not go to it. The outfits at this pub are pretty cute- note very short plaided skirts. The food was brought out relatively fast along with the beer.

Parking: Ample parking in a private lot (free).

Payment: Takes credit card.

Location: It's off strip and pretty close to the freeway. One can probably take a cab here or drive here if you have a car.

Overall, the pub was pretty friendly and our waitress was awesome. The food was okay, but the beer made up for it. I also filled out a survey with comments and it will be entered for a $25 gift card to the pub.",h9GVLf7Crm4kNuLFBDnEIw,1,1,4,JlAzLDm5eVRS7P1hTZakpA
4518008,2016-04-06,0,Vg1C_1eqwIwkZLIXGMTW3g,"I liked this place. We wanted a proper British-style roast dinner for Easter and this fit the bill. We got there just after noon on Sunday and had the place to ourselves (I know, we are bad people to go to a bar on Easter, but it is Vegas, so...).

The food was pretty good, although the lamb was very fatty and the beef was a bit overcooked. The veggies (peas and carrots) were cooked very well. Hot but slightly crunchy - no overbuild mush here. The mashed potatoes were real and the gravy was brown and rich. I question whether we got yorkshire pudding or a popover as it didn't have any beef flavoring, which was expected based on how it should be cooked. Regardless, it was pretty tasty.

I know several reviewers complained about the service, but we had no problem at all. Sure, we were in an empty bar, but I can't discount the service we got because of that. If I had any complaint about the place is that it had a bit of a grimy (not well cleaned) feel to it. Again though, I bet if the other bars we frequented in Vegas were brightly lit I am sure I would have felt the same. 

I would certainly come back here again as they had great beers on tap and their prices were great.

4714743,2015-07-25,1,Vg1C_1eqwIwkZLIXGMTW3g,"It has been quite awhile since we have eaten here. Even though the food was always good we never liked the fact that they didn't have a true non smoking section. The restaurant is non smoking but is adjacent to a bar where smoking is allowed and there is no separation between the two. If I can smell it and need to shower when I get home than it is not non smoking in my book. That is not my complaint however, I knew what I was getting into there. My complaint is about the service.

We waited a longer than acceptable time to order. We were all pretty hungry and some of us ordered the pies which we are aware take longer than the average entr√©e so we ordered a cup of soup in addition. Our server was either absent or darting by so fast we couldn't get her attention between when we ordered and our food came out. Several of our drinks were dry and those of us who ordered soup were wondering if it had been forgotten. In addition a couple of us wanted to order something from the bar but gave up on that idea. The soup did came out with the entrees and when I commented that I had expected it quite awhile ago the server just said that the kitchen put everything out at one time.

Now I am not na√Øve or self centered enough to think that they made a special pot of soup for me so I am not sure what was so difficult about ladling it into a cup, or more importantly why she didn't check on it when it didn't come up very shortly after the order had been placed. I was not expecting a grand gesture but a simple apology would have sufficed. To add to that our glasses sat empty until my husband stood up and called her back and requested refills.

The food itself was pretty good. The stilton and cabbage soup is excellent and the steak and mushroom pie is very tasty if not a little sparse on filling, especially for the price. The mashed potatoes were the one bleak spot of the dinner, not even warm and hardened as if they had sat out for too long. So overall, pricey for what it is and service seems to be pretty spotty. Not enough to entice me back to contend with the smoking aspect.",pfMmuVgggj14f9bb16IwXw,1,0,2,S-kEqc0UIW7h0kC6djVojQ

Service was unbearably slow, although my friends assured me this usually isn't the case so I'll take their word for it.

For both food and beer, the portions are giant. You definitely get your money's worth. I liked the variety of British food, but just wanted some chicken wings. Like I said, huge portion size and number. I had a good 8-9 wings. I was a little disappointed that the sauce came on the side, although it was just hot sauce (and also ranch).

The beer selection is great for me, because I am a big fan of British beers.  This might be the only place in the city that has Bombardier Ale on tap.  The food is very good, and the prices are reasonable.

The problems: 

The prices on beer seem to have gone up quite a bit over the last couple of year.  This used to be a good place to come for a couple of $5 drinks, but on the last couple of visits I payed close to $14 for two beers.  Their Happy Hour prices are a little cheaper, but not much.

I really hate to mention this, but there is a roach problem here.  If you sit outside, you're going to see a ton of roaches.  That's not such a big deal, but I have also had the same problem when sitting at the bar.  If you are coming here to eat, I would HIGHLY recommend that you sit at a table in the restaurant part of the room.  I have only eaten food on the bar-top twice, and both times there were roaches crawling around on the condiment bottles and near my food.

I initially ordered the steak and mushroom pie, I had it sent away since they felt the need to only put two pieces of steak in the entire pie.

It was noted by my other companions that it looked like I was eating a baked potato with how much batter I was digging through just to eat some fish.

We usually visit with friends, family and anybody else we can find to bring along! It's a great atmosphere and worth paying a little extra for the imported draughts! As I'm a British and a US citizen, living in Las Vegas, we thought it would be a nice start to the day as the race started at 8:15am here.

I tried calling the pub three times before arriving to check if you were showing the race on TV, but the telephone went to the answering machine each time. We arrived around 25 minutes before the race and asked a Mexican bartender working there if you would be showing the Grand National. She immediately replied ""Yes, of course!"". Without hesitation, we bought a pint and sat down looking the menu over for some breakfast!

Several minutes passed and all the main televisions were still only displaying the Man U and Newcastle football game. We'd all but missed the pre-race commentary and race line-up, I finally had to asked what time she would be turning the TV over. She said ""I'll change it in just a minute"" and walked away. Five minutes before the race started (and after asking the cleaner/repair chap also because the bartender had disappeared on us), the bartender came over to our table and said ""You wanted the Chelsea game?"". I don't believe for one instant that she comprehended what I had asked before purchasing drinks. I told her that ""we came to see The Grand National"". She seemed confused and asked somebody else working there. Another lady in her early 30s came over and asked what we wanted. When I told her, she said something to the effect of ""I don't understand, what's The Grand National?"" having no idea what we were referring to.

We were very disappointed. Not only did we miss the race (we arrived in plenty of time so that we'd have other options if it was not shown there), but we were lied to. We sat there feeling like idiots with drinks to accompany, quite frankly, nothing! It was also sad to hear that, in a British Pub, none of the workers currently working had any idea what a near two-century-old race even was!! So if you wondered why somebody left full drinks on the table, that was us. As regular customers, I think we will take our patronage elsewhere.

Because we were dousing it in ranch dressing and hot sauce, of course it tasted fabulous.  But take away all of that, and I wasn't so sure there was so much flavor in the chicken or batter itself.  Bummer.  They do a fine job though giving it to you on the crispy crunchy end, and we like crispy crunchy things! 

They do have a pretty extensive beer on tap selection, which is always impressive.  I'm a pear cider kind of girl for now...

They have various specials from late night craving deals to specialties of the day.  And who doesn't love a place that's open 24 hours?

I'm on a mission to find tastier chicken wings that this!  Bring it!

Update! 10/08/07 - I'm 1/3 of the way through my ""Down The Hatch!"" card!  Yay!  What the heck is that?!  They have this frequent beer drinker card and when you drink 30 of their beers, you get a free gift.  The BF is on card #3 already and is a proud owner of a Crown and Anchor T-shirt and Crown and Anchor soccer shirt.  (I'm hoping for the baby doll tee myself.)  They have some cool bartenders working here and a pool table upstairs as well.  We brought out of town guests and they loved the place!  I think they had live music the past Saturday.  We got there a bit too late and saw them putting their equipment away.  Yay for live music! And there's all you can eat fish and chips on Monday nights and happy hours from 3 pm to 6 pm!  Another cool thing is that they are showing football (soccer) games on the TV, and if you come by really late at night, they'll still have games on!

Sidenote:  They even offer a free shuttle pickup service! Wow!",rt3PC7WCgCKsoufmQJELfw,3,2,3,14p1WtCPkFjITHwdDnBYzA

Went inside stood at the desk and waited a long time. I was about to give up when the bartender acknowledged me. I then noticed the cocktail waitress was in deep conversation with someone at the bar while I waited. The beef dip was plain. Light in protein. The au-jus was good but too salty. The chips were good.

5476686,2012-08-20,7,Vg1C_1eqwIwkZLIXGMTW3g,"I would like to make this clear from the start, we have eaten here a few times and the food is pretty good, as a Brit living in Vegas there are times I get the craving for some good old British food, today was one of those days.

On one of our trips to the UK I introduce the wife to the British Carvery, to give you an idea take a look here : http://www.tobycarvery.co.uk/carvery/

Now, as these are non existent in Vegas, we are left with places that serve a traditional British Sunday Dinner, right, Crown and Anchor it is.

The service is always good here, the wait staff are always friendly and quick....... And let's be honest here, whoever came up with their uniforms, you deserve a medal.

But it is the food we are interested in.

The wife went for the Sunday Dinner with roast beef, I had the Sunday dinner with lamb and beef, both dishes are served with Yorkshire pudding, veg and A roast potato (more on those in a minute), along with this my wife ordered a small house salad.

After a while we had pretty much given up on the salad, no big deal, these things do happen. however, when are meals came out, they each had a house salad on the plate, along with the meat, potatoes, veg, Yorkshire pudding and gravy.....

A pet peeve of mine is when waitstaff know that something isn't right, how a house salad, with gravy even makes it out of the kitchen is beyond me (unless this is the way the owners want it, in which case....WOW).

Anyways, a quick recovery by the lady serving us, my salad which I did not order is gone and my wife has a nice house salad on the side, which would have been better served before the meal came out, but ok, on to the meal itself.

Is it a ""traditional British Sunday dinner"", well yeah it is, in the same way that as a McDonald's 1/4 pounder is a gourmet burger, all the pieces are correct, it looks right, but there is just something missing.

So let us dissect the meal :

The meats were good, maybe a little thinly sliced, but that happens to be the way I like them, so I was happy, however, putting beef gravy on to lamb just destroys any taste to the meat, if you are going to offer both meats, it's actually better to serve the gravy on the side and let the customer mess it up.

The Yorkshire pudding was good, this is something that normally causes all kinds of issues to those not raised with the darn things, but they were good.

Veg is veg, enough said and ignored.

Now for the real crime on this dish, the roast potato.....This is going to be long, it is a story and a rant.

The Great British Roast Potato, a food that when done right makes a Brit smile and a non Brit wish they had been born a Brit, sounds like exaggeration huh ? 

A couple of years ago we were lucky enough to host the family Christmas dinner here, it seemed like half of California showed up, the women folk worked their wonders on the veg, the father in law worked on turkey and prime rib.

Over in a corner of the kitchen the Brit who married into the family was hiding in a cloud of steam, gently giggling to himself, these poor Americans had no idea what was about to hit them. A bag of potatoes had been boiled, cut in half and were now being gently rocked back and forth in a colander.

The women were looking at the wife wondering, WTF did you go and marry this guy for ? And why won't he answer any questions about what he is cooking ?

45 minutes before we are due to eat, the potatoes are placed in the oven, set at 325, basting in a bath of melted lard and drippings. After 15 minutes the oven door is quickly opened, the potatoes are quickly covered with the oil, 15 minutes later the door is again opened and the potatoes are turned over.

So 45 minutes pass, what comes out is a potato that is golden brown on the outside with a crispness to it while inside the potato is light and fluffy.... And totally ignored by everyone ! Heretics !

That is until the father in law becomes brave and decides to try one of these strange things his new son in law has produced.... Or it could of been his daughter kicking him under the table while not so subtly nodding at the bowl of potatoes, but he tries one, then ever so slowly reaches over and grabs the bowl and shovels a bunch of them on to his plate, the family is shocked, the strange new food is a hit with the old man, the Brit sits back with a little smile on his face.

Now the reason for that long story is...... If you are going to serve roast potatoes serve roast potatoes, not two little bits of potato that if I had to guess came out of a bag frozen, were quickly thrown through some oil and then put on a plate and served.

Yes doing it right is time consuming, yes it can be a bit of a pain, but if a chain in the UK can do it day in and day out serving thousands of meals a day,there is no reason why a little restaurant cannot get such an important part of the meal right.
For this reason and this reason alone they get marked down, is that mean, well no it's not.",5XKjVehgGzb5dJocdI-36Q,8,1,2,8TQraBk2Zy6uew0-Rgj8iA

I ordered as-is and found the dish to be quite kicking. The medium-sized chicken cuts were doused with a thin yellow sauce. The sauce is what made the dish kick. Unable to figure out whether what made it kick outside of any curry taste, I was baffled and prayed that my stomach wouldn't hurt later. It didn't. The dish, while seemingly small for the famished, ended up being very filling. Complemented by chicken tenders, I was very full and quite happy.

This go around, we ordered the AYCE Fish & Chips and hoped for a filling meal. For over two hours we were at Crown & Anchor, we received our first PIECE of fish, granted, the one piece per plate was fairly substantial. However, it was still just one piece.

This pub was a staple when I was in my 20s... we'd drink, eat, throw darts, and enjoy trivia nights here. And the fish and chips were awesome!

Fast forward to many years later, a friend suggested we grab dinner here while killing some time in the neighborhood, waiting to pick our kids up from an event. Of course, I was down to go, and was looking forward to the fish and chips! The pub was very smoky and dingy, the way I remembered it. To me that's part of the atmosphere though... it's a pub! Out of nine of us there that  night, two of us ordered the fish and chips. 

Out comes a dish that I didn't quite remember... peas, check. Chips... check. Decent looking fish... NOPE. There was one piece of large, heavily breaded, greasy fish, shaped like a brick. I took a bite, and thought, hmm... I don't know if I should be eating this. I only ended up taking a couple more bites after that, and unfortunately my friend who ordered it as well ate the whole thing.

Fast forward to later that night, we both got violently ill... at almost the exact same time. Everyone else we are with were fine, but the two of us were in for a painful, uncomfortable, sleepless night. Unfortunately, 48 hours later we are both still having gastrointestinal issues (I'll spare you the details), which is making us both nervous. My friend is thinking of calling the county to file a formal complaint.

We were also going to be watching the US world cup game against Germany, and we found out after the fact that C&A had made the Thrillist list for top 10 places to watch soccer in the US.  While it was a little warm, the atmosphere did not disappoint.

My friends and I sat up a little upstairs nook to watch the game.  We all ordered the chicken fingers before the kitchen closed, as they were grilling burgers for the crowd that day.

They had a lot of comfort food that I remember from my youth.  Couldn't make up my mind on an app so I tried a Sausage roll and a Yorkshire Pudding.  The latter was very dry as if it had been cooked a few days ago and just warmed up.

I had a Blackthorn draft with Blackcurrent (originally asked for Ribena, but waitress had no idea what this was).

Can't remember exactly what my buddy ordered, I think it was some sort of stew.  I went with a Banger buddy (sausage sandwich) with chips.  All in all, not bad.  I wouldn't be rushing back here any time soon.

As a plus we were entertained by the two LVPD police officers who were dining next to us.

This place is a unique establishment, which, in Las Vegas, is an achievement. This place has so many draws. For example, the food is absolutely authentic British pub fare. It's the best in town. 

The staff. What can I say? From the plaid skirts to the flirty service, the help is definitely easy on the eyes. And ladies, don't despair, because every male bartender is huge ( I believe a prerequisite for male employment is the ability to bench a Volkswagen). 

Crown and Anchor issues to its patrons a challenge. Whosoever can drink all 30 beers available on tap will receive a free Crown and Anchor T shirt in commemoration of their drunken prowess. It repeats up to four times for different swag. 

And did I mention Pub Quiz?  

Once weekly, on Thursday evenings, teams compete in an impossibly difficult trivia challenge, wherein teams are asked ten very difficult questions, spanning a breadth of topics. Thehighest scoring team receives a 50 dollar bar tab to be used at their next visit. It's competitive, free, and a blast. Highly recommended.
