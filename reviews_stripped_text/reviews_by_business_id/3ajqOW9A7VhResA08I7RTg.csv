We had dinner at the Hash House a Go Go on Thursday April 25th. Our waiter was a male, one of the persons in our party of 3 ordered a coffee and the waiter brought her out a cold coffee of old coffee to our table and told us that a new batch would be ready in 8 minutes, a half hour later we needed to track him down and ask him for the coffee. When we ordered our food I asked if could get sauteed onions on my hamburger our waiter replied I could ask the chef but he will not do it, we were all thinking are you kidding us your chef will not Saute onions for a burger, sounds like this chef needs another job to us.  We then were anticipating hot biscuits delivered to the table like last year, instead we each got a cold, old and very hard biscuits, no butter etc. delivered to the table to accompany them. This restaurant does not seem to feel the need to care anymore. Our food arrived, it was fair at best, and we did not see our waiter until he delivered our check. We were very disappointed that he did not bother to check in with and see how are food was or take the dishes off the table. I was tempted to bus the table myself. Based on our service and the attitude of the chef we will not be back.",qbfNIsfQUjYgBm6RT-PPqw,1,0,2,kT8vs0MhK5GlxyMPwkfv2g

Hostess gave us a pager and said it would be 30-45 minutes. Not a problem, I said and asked how far the range was and was told to stay on the main floor and not to leave the casino and it would work. After over an hour I returned to see how much longer our wait was going to be. Come to find out the hostess had forgotten about us and had skipped us. Not a problem l, you were busy, that's understandable. We get seated and I try to order orange juice, only to be informed that they're out of orange juice. How, on a busy Friday morning are you already out of orange juice? Oh well. We order our meals, a basic and apple cinnamon flapjack with whipped cream. Oh, now you're also out of sausage and bacon? Well that eliminates a good portion of your menu. After being seated for about 5 minutes 3 booths near us were seated. Yet somehow all 3 ordered orange juice and got it. Before my husband and I even got our drinks. After waiting for 45 minutes for our food to finally arrive, my potatoes are cold, my husbands pancakes have 4 paper thin slices of apples that are nearly blackened from being burned and there's no whipped cream. I try to ask for a side of hollandaise sauce since there is a section on the menu for eggs Benedict, but much to my surprise and chagrin I am informed that there is no hollandaise sauce in the restaurant. After we attempt to eat and decide it's not worth the hassle and ask for he check we still have to wait an additional 20 minutes for an incorrect check. Needless to say we were not impressed nor will we ever recommend this location which is a shame considering every other hash house a go go I have been to (multiple locations in Las Vegas and the Chicago location) I have never had such horrendous food not service",rhXDYTy6qeqIZ9BtJpguyw,0,0,1,5ELKW3MzADz7mrdYMSwXcg

The fried angel hair pasta that comes with every entree was just silly too...I don't know if it was just poorly executed...has anyone else ever seen sticks of fried angel hair pasta with dinner?

This place specializes in huge portions of mediocre food.

Your love of this place probably depends on how you judge restaurants. If you like the the theme of huge portions at low prices, it's a fun place to try.

BUT, if you are a true foodie and you are looking for flavor, quality, or something that will make you lick your lips with satisfaction, this place just will not do the trick. Nothing here tastes bad, per se. But nothing tastes truly delicious or has you wanting to go back for more.

237606,2014-08-14,0,3ajqOW9A7VhResA08I7RTg,"This place is okay. Not anything spectacular, by any means. I've eaten here twice, once I had the mushroom cheeseburger and the second time, today, I had breakfast there. 

The Stuffed Cheeseburger: The first time I went there I had the stuffed mushroom and swiss burger and it was alright. From the name, I assumed the actual patty was stuffed with mushrooms and swiss but it was actually stuffed between two patties. The burger was huge and they cooked it well done, just like I asked for but it lacked seasoning. The patty desperately needed salt; it was very bland. The mushrooms were slightly salted, could've used more but were still actually really good. The condiments were perfect, the fries were good and the burger was HUGE. 

Breakfast: they offer a breakfast dish called The Basic which include two eggs cooked to your liking, sausage or bacon (two pieces of either, we picked pork sausage), potatoes (crispy or mashed), toast or biscuit and assorted fruit. I didn't really care about the fruit or the toast or biscuit so I just ordered sausage, two eggs, and potatoes a la carte. It was a couple of dollars more, but at least I didn't have to settle for something I didn't want. The eggs were pretty good, but I would've liked the white to be set a little bit more. The two sausages tasted good but they were very pale and almost looked undercooked. I should've asked them to cook them until they were dark. As for the crispy potatoes, I guess I kind of expected more of a hash brown/latke kind of fried but it wasn't, they were more like fried chunks and they were still very tasty, salted well and the portion size was good. My boyfriend ordered the basic, with two over easy eggs, wheat toast, mashed potatoes and sausage (he asked for them to be cooked well, almost burnt so it would be crispy). He liked it; his eggs were cooked perfectly, the sausage was delicious (I know because I tasted a bite of his; they were WAY better than mine which seemed barely cooked and not seared at all), he seemed to enjoy his toast but they completely forgot the fruit. He thought the mashed potatoes were alright but a little tough.

Overall, the food here wasn't bad. Breakfast was definitely better than lunch. Breakfast wasn't great for a place that specializes in breakfast. Compared to Denny's, it was like double the price for the same quality. I would return for breakfast but not for lunch, not for a burger at least. I'm sure there are MUCH better burgers around.",ABt6wlmgY2PSN6uMl6QLag,0,0,3,BYqiUsQlcmK2Hqh7xKG9iQ

(Several) Friends highly recommended HHAGG for the perfect hangover cure. After a late night out it was just the ticket to recovery. Funky fresh options and excellent service. Bloodies are on point at 20oz and you can keep the cup if you want.

Sage Fried Chicken anything for your fried hangover fix. Waffles, Bene or the country classic which is what I had with maple reduction (bomb!!!!) and mashed potatoes---HUGE!

For a lighter option the skillet with sun dried tomatoes, artichokes and spinach was lovely and definitely easier on the stomach but still ---HUGE!

Service was on point and helpful. Walked in at 10am on a Sunday and got a table for 2 immediately. I'm sure the locations on the strip would have longer wait times but the food came out quickly after we ordered it and we were back out within the hour.

IF YOU EXPECT TO PAY FOR GREAT FOOD PLUS SERVICE...  THIS LOCATION IS NOT THE ONE TO EAT AT!

I'll start off by saying the food is GREAT!  HOWEVER, the sole reason for the 1 star is for the service, or should I say the lack of service!  
Let me start by summarizing the volume of business that I witnessed, since one may be quick to assume that it was busy. 
-Upon arrival and walking to our table in the back of the restaurant, there were only a total of 4 tables sat up front and in our section, 2 more tables finishing up. 
-Once we were seated, it took our server over 10 minutes to greet us just for our drink orders.  
-Once we were ready to order, I bring it to our server's attention, and my exact words ""my son is allergic to shellfish, can you please note that when putting in our order"".  Instead of agreeing, our server, REBECCA, decides to ask numerous questions and give us a hard time about it!
-After I order is placed, we do not see Rebecca again, until after our food was delivered by members of management!
-It takes 45 minutes to get our food delivered to the table.  Our order: 2 chicken benny's, a ranchero benny, a regular breakfast platter, a chicken salad, and kid pancake combo.
-Not only did it take our food forever to come out, but our food was delivered in increments of every 5 minutes.  Whatever happened to serving an entire table all at once?!?! 
-I had to ask the manager serving our to look for our server so I can place an alcohol order.  He complies, instead of offering to take my order for me. Once I finally ordered my drink, I take notice that she IMMEDIATELY, NOT STEP TO THE BACK TO PUT MY DRINK ORDER, but IMMEDIATELY goes to a table next to us where her other co-workers are eating. IN THE CUSTOMER DINING AREA, and proceeds to EAT with them, instead of putting in my drink order first!  After five minutes of eating, Rebecca, our server, takes notice that I am looking at her, and she steps to the side, to which I believe to place my drink order, and then comes over to us stating ""I'm still waiting on your drink order, I don't know what is taking so long"", after I had witnessed her go straight to the ""employee lunch table"" first.  
-My wife asks for something very minimal- extra napkins...  Rebecca, our server, does not come back with napkins after 5 minutes.  Instead we had to get up and ""interrupt"" the other servers eating and ask for napkins.  
-My question is: since when do servers eat in the customer dining area as a group?  Every restaurant I've worked at or managed has a specific dining area for the employees!

TERRIBLE, TERRIBLE, CUSTOMER SERVICE EXPERIENCE!!!

I apologize, but did I mention at least the food was good?  Too bad the service negates the quality of the food they serve.",gkq8eRnGCSSdW7LRKZR6Jw,0,0,1,CbwNFt3Vmd7RLwuwO5JBzw

We went in for brunch at around 10AM and there was no wait for 6 people. Our server was quick and answered all of our questions about the menu. Before we knew it our order was in and food was on the table. The huge plus about this place, besides the fast service, was the portions. You can easily share an entree between two people (and probably still have leftovers). Unfortunately the food did not wow me as I had hoped it would.

Hearing so much about the sage fried chicken and waffles I didn't even need to look at the menu to know what I wanted. Maybe the cook was having an off day or maybe this location was not the right one to try, but what arrived was less than noteworthy. The sage gave the chicken breading a unique flavor unfortunately once I cut into the chicken (which I believe was a boned thigh) all of the breading fell off the chicken making it a big skin, syrup, mess with flavorless chicken. The waffles had strips of actual bacon in them which would have been pretty awesome if the bacon was cooked a bit more.

Nothing really memorable here and no raves from our group.  Next time I'm in Vegas I might go back, to try something else at a different location.

One person ordered the chicken pot pie (at which point the server asked ""Do you know how big that is!?)... actually it was enough for all four of us!

826560,2015-11-28,0,3ajqOW9A7VhResA08I7RTg,"LV native now, and was 1st year I decided I needed a cooking break on turkey day. I realize nothing is as good as homemade on Thanksgiving, but went in with an open mind, given this restaurant's positive reviews. Made an unnecessary reservation, as the place was virtually empty when we arrived, which was lucky, as whoever took my reservation only hours earlier, didn't write it down.

The waitress arrived quickly and took our order quick as well, as we were all decided we would order the turkey dinner. She was a little off putting, as in not friendly, which I would later realize the reason, we we were arriving at end of her shift on Thanksgiving.

It took no more than 5-10 minutes to receive our plates. Looked decent, but tasted not so decent. The turkey and stuffing were moist, but there was probably about an ounce of gravy on the potatoes. I asked the food runner if we could have more, and she rolled her eyes and said ""I'll have to check with the kitchen."" She brought back for three of us about one more ounce of gravy to share. The mashed potatoes served with dinner were like bricks that seemed to be sitting the entire day, were not warm, and lacked any flavoring such as milk and butter. Vegetables served were carrots, green beans and a small ear of corn. The corn was cooked properly, but the carrots and green beans were virtually raw, and the carrots were so tough I couldn't cut with a knife. None of the vegetables arrived with butter or any seasoning, just plain and hard; reminded me of my kids' school lunches! The dinner was to come with cranberry sauce, which it did in a tiny ramekin usually seen in restaurants that put ketchup in for fries. There was approximately one tablespoon each. Given my kids love cranberry sauce, I forfeited my tablespoon so they could each have an extra 1/2 tablespoon; what a joke. 

For dessert we ordered pumpkin cheesecake and pumpkin bread pudding. When I ordered dessert, the waitress indicated she was ""going to get out of here,"" and I believe the bartender was going to finish up our table. She brought us the check, my tab was approximately $80, and although the food was sub-par and she wasn't the friendliest, I gave her a 20% tip. She was never seen again.

Meanwhile, our pumpkin cheesecake arrived immediately from a food runner. My kids and I had a few bites, but it didn't taste like cheesecake to me. Rather, it had a strong taste of cool whip in the filling. My two little sweet freaks didn't touch it yesterday in the fridge at home, and I'll toss it today. After waiting 30 minutes for anyone to pass by to get their attention, I managed to get two hosts' attention. Our bread pudding was missing in action, and at about the 40th minute the food runner returned with the bread pudding. I told her no way, wasn't paying for it, as I just told the host 10 minutes prior same, and was waiting for the manager to return my bread pudding money. He did ultimately run a new check canceling the dessert charges and apologizing for our waitress taking off before ensuring our dessert was delivered. Obviously, we were forgotten about. He gave us the bread pudding, but no one has touched it in the fridge. 

The entire experience and food were subpar, and given this restaurant's reviews, I had high hopes, and a crummy buffet would have been a far better option for the price. Because of this experience, we will never dine at this chain again.",zDJFspqbyWbfiCZOJvp48g,0,0,2,flRSZORHcqB-OvoAyY63fw

Hash House A Go Go will cost you a little more, but the combination of huge portions and great tasting food will satisfy you.  
I had the Corned Beef House Hash...which was quite delicious.  Although huge, I was able to put most of it away.  Of course I walked around for a couple of hours feeling quite stuffed.  You can tell just by the look and taste that everything is prepared fresh...no canned stuff here.
My brother had the sage fried chicken benedict dish...which he raved about.  It was even larger than my plate and he couldn't finish.
My mom had a basic breakfast of eggs scrambled, biscuit, hash brown potatoes, and bacon.  This was too large for her and she couldn't finish either.
One thing that you have to try if you come here is the Watermelon/Kiwi Lemonade.  I didn't order it, but had a taste of my brothers...it was delicious and quite refreshing.
This location is convenient if you are staying downtown as it is located in the Plaza hotel lobby area.  There was no significant wait to eat here(we waited about 10 minutes for a table), but we went on a Monday about 9AM or so...so could be different on weekends or at different times.

Everything in the menu is pretty much $15+, which can be a little pricey for breakfast food.

I work at a hotel and used to work at a restaurant, so I understand this industry, but what we experienced was so beyond ""bad"" service I'm at a loss for words. I originally wanted just to send the owners an email, but I couldn't find any contact info...Then I thought that others with food allergies need to know. I want to point out that I'm not looking for anything from management, I just want other gluten free travelers to know about my experience here. 

I have Celiac Disease, so if I eat anything with wheat in it I get really sick. Before we even got sat we asked the manager that was on duty if they had anything gluten free that I could eat. He said ""Yes of course. Everything is made to order so you should be able to find something."" Perfect! So we were seated. Our waitress came over and took our drink order. I asked her what she recommended that was gluten free and her response was ""Uhhh...umm...we don't have anything gluten free."" From there it was back and forth with her and the manager we talked to earlier. All I really wanted was an egg, bacon, and some hash browns. The manager said the hash browns come pre-packaged and seasoned (what happened everything made to order?) and would have to check on the label. When he came back he said they were gluten free. Then the server came back and I told her what I wanted and she said  ""No, he is wrong. They aren't gluten free."" I have never had an issue with ANY restaurant I've been to about trying to find out if I can have something gluten free. If they don't that's fine and I'll find a safe place for me to eat. But the lack of communication between management and the servers was the worst I've ever experienced. I was to the point of tears and had to embarrassingly ask where the restroom was so I could pull myself together. After that we never saw our waitress again. I could tell she was upset with us, but really? She never came back by to see if everything was okay or offer refill on coffee. We saw her chatting it up with the table behind us. We waited for nearly 10 minutes before she came back to give us our check. When we did finally see her she threw it on the table without even looking at us or saying a word. I have never felt more humiliated in my life! There are SO many great restaurants in the area, this one isn't worth the headache (and tears) for people with food allergies. We won't be back.",T8tHkBW0lvK8V_2R7c8Eeg,2,0,1,qESFv8ZgpyBdLq0VBbK2Bg

I ordered the HH Original Eggs Benedict.  Presentation was dramatic, as usual, but the food was disappointing.  Bed of mashed potatoes were good but nothing remarkable.  Tasted like a homemade mash with little or no cream/butter and skins left on.  Then on top of that were two halves of a biscuit.  Bottom half was hard as a hockey puck.  I was about to call the waiter over to take it back but then I cut into the top half, and it was soft.  No intention of eating all those carbs, so let it go.  Tomato was under ripe and spinach leaves were cold and crispy.  Eggs were poached perfectly. Bacon was thin and just okay.   ""Red pepper cream"" poured over the top was uninspired.  

My companion ordered the smoked salmon egg white scramble with fresh fruit.  Strawberries were pink and white.  Not red.  Not ripe at all.  Pineapple was good.  She enjoyed the hash, but I thought it smelled horrible.  I don't like strong fish scents, especially for breakfast.

First of all, I never made any comment on why my food was the only one on the table.

I ordered some kind of Fried Chicken with a biscuit. Neither one fo was impressed. After we left we both thought wow that was horrible especially when I think our bill was $48....Of course we had 2 Bloody Mary's. My friend said it was good. I had never had one so i ordered it.

This one is located in the Plaza hotel downtown but this time around, for whatever reason, it wasn't all that thrilling.  Perhaps because it was the one meal in LV on this trip that I decided to take the trashiness of the food down a level?  At around 10 AM we did have to put our name on a waiting list but it only took about 5 or 10 minutes before I got a text telling us to head back to the host.  

The waitress and staff were kind and definitely kept our water and coffee full.  No problems there.  Mom and I split the Healthy Start with spinach, mushrooms and onions and a side order of Biscuit and Gravy for $5 (to offset being TOO healthy, you understand)!  The other half of our party ordered the Crab Benedict.  They brought out the Healthy Start but when they found out they had mis-keyed a Benedict with Fried Chicken instead of Crab, they corrected it within minutes!  Great service, no question.  

The issue was really the food.  It was just good, not great.  To the point that we didn't order anything decadent which is kind of the point of eating at Hash House A Go Go, the two people who ordered the Benedict didn't have anything much to say and one of them could only eat a little because the sauce was too spicy for her.  We did have the biscuit and gravy but it was also just okay.  Nothing great.

In the Plaza, the big hotel / convention center at the corner of Fremont & Main, you can find a pretty standard looking casino, but the eateries in there are far from standard.  The Hash House is a strange Southern/farm-themed restaurant that serves up biscuits and 'hash' skillet scrambles, as well as Southern-style breakfast (chicken & waffles) and comfort food.
I went here for breakfast, service was good.  They wouldn't do a turkey substitution on my scramble (I got the jalapeno/chorizo version and thought it tasted pleasantly like a breakfast taco), but the serving was generous and the flavor was good.

I'd give it a thumbs up, especially for a morning-after breakfast.  If you're looking for a low-fat snack before yoga though, give it a miss.",l-1g7hDc1bS1xjtyxY79hw,2,0,4,jl1srAqN3NzVrZzzW4GGhw

I am not the type to talk bad on a place.. that is ofcourse until they treat the customer like crap... which is the experience I just had at the Plaza Casino Hash house.  They entice casino patrons to eat there by offering discount coupons upon checkin... then find every excuse not to fulfill them.  We had a four top wait 10 minutes just to be sat (at the front hostess stand) The short haired african american girl that worked at 5pm 1/9/2012 likes to talk more than work. Then we waited for another 5-10 minutes just to get a server and put in the drink orders.  At 515 pm... they then stated that our 10 dollar coupon would not be honored.. even though we clearly were there before the 5pm cutoff... the server even remembered us from a previous visit... and should have known that we are excellent tippers!! What an idiot... I hope you enjoyed your tip that we deducted the ten bux from!!!! Bahahahhahaahhahahahaha (pause for deep breath) hahahahahahahahahaahahahahaa!!!!.

I will never be back, and will be spreading the word to everyone who considers this Downtown Vegas Hash House  location.

Glad we went to this location instead of Linq location on the strip. We were seated and greeted right away and given our drinks within five minutes. The tea/fresh lemonade is very good!

As for meals, we were naive about the sizes. We can usually eat Cheesecake Factory meals in 1-2 sittings, but these bad boys could feed a family of four(seriously, the bowl of my chicken pot pie was a family-sized serving bowl). Hubby and I both ordered a side salad, which were both the size of 3-4 side salads elsewhere. Could easily be split by 2-4 people, as an FYI. Hubby loved his mixed greens salad with macadamia nuts and said it was unique and the sweet vinaigrette complimentary. My Caesar salad was pretty basic with only four croutons and an over-abundance of manufactured parm cheese. Would have liked more crunch or additions of tomatoes/cucumbers. The four small corn croutons had a stale taste and odd texture. Get a different salad. 

Our son liked his cheese quesadilla(which was very big) and the ""fruit garnish"" is a slice of orange and cantaloupe. Hubby loved his sage chicken and waffles. The chicken was moist, crispy, and well-flavored white meat. The waffles were fluffy yet crisp. He had a second meal from his leftovers. 

My chicken pot pie tastes similar to chicken and biscuits. They first put down what looks like a huge cracker hat and then fill it with a creamy chicken stew. Lots of veggies, which were fresh and great. Some were undercooked and hard (potatoes and carrots) but it was otherwise tasty. Nothing super unique about the taste of the dish aside from the hat...err...crust. It was delicious, crisp and flaky but a nice chew inside. I would imagine that I will get four meals out of this dish.

1998343,2013-01-19,1,3ajqOW9A7VhResA08I7RTg,"They say Go Big or Go Home, but Hash House offers everyone the chance to Go Big and Go Bland.

This place offers fun dishes, massive plates, and very little flavor.  They sell themselves as a Midwestern-American eatery.  And the menu is piled up with ginormous plates of meat and carbs in various forms (chicken and waffles, giant burger, chicken and brie sandwich, etc).  The tv show ""Man v. Food"" helped put this restaurant on the map based on the host's love of the ""Chicken Benedict""--which consists of a layer of mashed potatoes with a biscuit, fried chicken, bacon, cheese, spinach, and eggs.  It's huge!  It's famous!  It's okay.  

Every which way you turn on this menu is a dish that should be the greatest thing you've tasted--I mean there's nothing ""light"" on the menu.  But despite all the carbs and butter and fat on the menu, most dishes are simply decent.  The burger -- flavorless ground beef.  The Chicken Benedict -- surprisingly bland.  The egg scrambles -- fresh, but surprisingly plain.  I seriously want to introduce the kitchen to salt and spices.

I've eaten here several times because of friend's supposed love of the menu, but I just don't get it.  The restaurant lures customers in with the promise of indulging in ""meat and potatoes"" piled high.  They've got the quantity right, but the flavor is sadly lacking.

Bottom line: Hash House is worth a visit as a culinary curiosity.  But the lack of flavor will prevent most customers from repeat visits.",wOSHvuJEJflUEesNLno51A,6,1,2,aQ1-F6WVe1YbB_iG7LZAqg

When their plates came out, it was a giant portion garnished with even more food. My salad came out and it was so sad and mediocre, the toppings didn't even cover the lettuce! It didn't even have bacon on it. So I had to order a side of bacon for my meal which was extra. Today I looked up their menu and the salad was supposed to have bacon.

The menu itself is not very big. For drinks we both decided on the mango iced tea. It was decent but I don't think I'd order it again. I decided to go with the bacon, avocado, cheddar burger, my three favorite ingredients combined, I couldn't resist.

The bloody mary was great, was fresh and had plenty of spice.

Half of the table, at the recommendation of Man Vs. Food, got the fried chicken benedict.  This is the ultimate heavy hangover food and, although they could've dialed down the spice in the sauce, was tasty.

The other half of the table tried the chicken and waffles, which were a bit disappointing: the chicken was a bit dry, and the waffles, despite having bacon in the middle, were just ok.  

It was a bit expensive though.  Breakfast for 5 (not everyone got a drink) for $100.

We had to chase down the hosted who then reminded the waiter about our table. 20 minutes after arriving, he shows up with a lame excuse about not knowing we were in his section although he took every order to our left and right. 

Then while waiting for our food, a major fight broke out in the kitchen. I'm not just talking punches, the table closest to the kitchen said someone got cut. A horde of security guards arrived and yellow-taped everything in the kitchen. Then they escorted the bus-boy out. The same guy that had bussed the table to our left (did I mention that they had arrived AFTER us!)

After the free show, our food arrived; one plate at a time. The waiter insisted the kitchen was delayed after the fight and judging from the yellow tape we gave them the benefit of the doubt. 

Then my salad came with bacon, which wasn't on their menu description and to which I have an unfortunate allergy for. So, I had to wait some more for a fresh salad. However, when it arrived, it was amazing. The biscuit melted in your mouth, the salad was crispy and fresh. At our table, we had a couple of dishes. The fried chicken was amazing, the waffles and French toast were favorites, and the ingredients in everything were very fresh. Come hungry though, the portions are NO JOKE!

We were annoyed with the service (they get minus stars; below 0) but the food was top-notch (5+). So average it out to a 2 star experience. Would we come again? I don't know.... maybe we would order out... But might just avoid them all together, at least for a while.

I had the meatloaf, and regret to say I couldn't finish it. It was the best meatloaf I've had, but enough to feed a little-league team. I did crafts with the rosemary spear and spaghetti pieces as an added bonus. The side veggies--carrots & green beans were tasty and well cooked. The meatloaf sits on top of pan-fried mashed potatoes and is smothered in gravy. I loved it. 
The other dish was the sage/bacon chicken & waffles. Also too much for one; it arrived with ample, moist (""real"") fried chicken, bacon in the waffles and a few strands of green onions. The chicken & bacon were finished, but a waffle or two didn't fit. Judged: very good. 
Be careful what and how much you order. The mains are splittable from what we saw. 
Great beer list with several varieties rated 90%+ on the beer sites. The soundtrack on the house system even played the Pixies and other 90s indie rock.

Not the delicacy of the, well anything. You'll never hear anyone praise the chef. And you'll probably be looking at someone who the word ""Sansabelt"" is usually proceeded by, ""where are the..?"" I'll just say it, this place is for fat people who are probably cheap but think they're too good to go to a buffet. Or their too lazy to make the eight trips back and forth to get the same amount of food you'll get on one entree here. Or too embarrassed. 

My uh food was ostensibly an egg Benedict. I think Benedict Cumberbatch was buried somewhere between the potato farm and the layers of some weird cheese pancake that was covered in the exact same chipotle they serve at ISIS training camps to get new recruits to hate infidels. ""Eat so you can taste the hell that is the American Southwest! Death to America!"" I totally would understand after eating this. 

Wait. There's more! It's 110 in the shade but the chef/menu committee decided to remind us that somewhere it's Christmas. How? You ask. By impaling a 7ft Norwegian pine smack dab in the middle of my food. And probably poor Benedict Cumberbatch buried in the goo. Who does that? Why? Norway should revoke the visas of anyone currently terrorizing their pine forests. Have some national pride. Don't let Hash House ruin people's memories of your...hmm...ok, you have nothing. 

But I digress. This gawdawful concoction had so many levels of early 21 st century cliches that it should be cited as non ada compliant as there's no elevator to get from top to bottom. Did I mention the tree in the middle of it all? Oh. I did. The ""gravy""... Chipotle is not to be used on non combatants according to the Geneva convention. That's been standard since the war in Grenada. If Rumsfeld should be on trial the person who created this time culinary bomb ought to be in the docket right next to him. Hell, I'd spend the night with Dick Cheney and his mean straight daughter rather than eat this again. 

Oh yeah. There's chicken in here somewhere but I never got near it. After a portion of potatoes that could have saved half of Ireland during the famine I was too full to get poor Benedict Cumberbatch to move over to let me power up the ol' chainsaw and cut off a piece of the  Flintstone size buzzards breast.

Second morning in Vegas, ordered ""The Basic"" with eggs over medium , bacon, griddled mashed potatoes, biscuit & side of gravy.

Breakfast came out with cubed potatoes & when I pointed it out, the runner promptly brought out a side of the smashers...not very griddled but whatever, they were delicious.

Biscuit was a little dry so I was glad I had the gravy for dunking. It also came with marmalade which was pretty tasty.

Breakfast was decent & more than I could eat...this being HHAGG and all.

Dinner the next night was Sage Fried Chicken & Waffles
(Two sage fried chicken breasts with hardwood smoked bacon waffle tower, hot maple reduction and fried leeks)

Chicken was tender & juicy with a nice fried crust. It's not boneless...in case that's a make or break for you.

The waffles had a crispy crunch with a fluffy center and BACON!) but needed more syrup, which I got right away upon on request. The syrup reduction tasted more like teriyaki...I wasn't a fan of that or the leeks but that's just me.

Again, too much to eat.

For both meals service wasn't too attentive. They kind of just take your order, check back once shortly after food is served, let you eat your meal then drop off the check. Not a deal breaker for a casino hotel restaurant.

All in all both meals were tasty but I think the main appeal of HHAGG is the huge portions & I'm more of a nibbler. Large servings & buffets are lost on me.

After much deliberation of the many wonderful-sounding breakfast items, I went for the item they tout as their best-known item, and the one that was featured on Man V.

It consists of a HUGE sage fried chicken breast, fresh spinach, hardwood smoked bacon, tomato, mozzarella, chipotle cream and scrambled eggs, served on a bed of mashed potatoes and a split biscuit. Eyeing the portions of the other dishes - the biscuits and gravy are insanely huge - I knew I was in for a challenge. 

This thing was RIDICULOUSLY HUGE - see the picture I included. And everything was, for the most part, excellent. However, I really couldn't taste the sage in the fried chicken all that much. Everything gets piled together and mushed together after a few bites. Also, the biscuits were a bit hard and there wasn't enough sauce for them soften up, so they were mostly discarded. 

Still, I ate about 90% of the plate, and promptly put myself into a food coma. My plans to go over to the Nugget for poker were delayed by a slight nap and digestion period.

3. When she finally returned with waters I asked what types of vodkas she had, she didn't know, my date literally got up and walked to the bar to check it out, because waiting for her would have taken to long. 
 
3. I asked for extra olives in my BLT Bloody Mary, was told no because there was no way to charge for it.... I didn't really think my request was to out of line but moving on. 

4. Received my Bloody Mary, asked for worchestire sauce, she replied, ooo I don't know if I can get that.... Again... What?!?!?

7. My food came out cold. At this point I knew my date was already at wits end so I decided not to say anything else. But it wasn't even like sort of warm, it was cold. 

8. When we mentioned our dissatisfaction to the manager he kind of seemed lost and confused. He did offer to comp two bloody Mary's (which we later had to have removed from the bill because our waitress charged us for them) 

9. Our waitress never even came by to check if everything came out well after our food was delivered. 

10. I unfortunately did not get the food runners name. But he was the ONLY part of this visit that was a positive experience, when he brought out the food he was happy energetic asked if we needed anything else, he also cleared our plates when we were finished. And I had asked him for the manager he actually came back to the table to tell me he notified the manager, and came back a second time to double check the manager came by. (With no disrespect, he was the African American food runner for the morning shift on 11/16/2013, he would make a great waiter)

Scramble eggs with bacon, avocado and Swiss cheese with crispy potato: They literally mean SCRAMBLE. Everything was just toss together. I like my food neatly separated. And it's not like I ordered an omelette. The crispy potato was soggy with no Flavor what so ever.
Hash Smoked Salmon with sunnyside up eggs with crispy potato: The smoked smoke has such a lite tip of smoke, the potato was the same soggy and flavorless. 

When it comes to food I devour my plate like a wild animal with a piece of meat. But at this place I only took a few bites and didn't want to eat anymore.

We both didn't care for the meals and ate very little. They did only charge us for one entree and gave us half price deserts which was nice. The crazy thing was o brought the meatloaf home and even my dogs wouldn't eat it .

all i needed for a satisfying breakfast was a hot cup of coffee and their french toast, which was actually delicious and not too huge of a portion. thankfully, they did not overkill the french toast as they did with the others' meals.

I've come to learn that this ""chain"" originated in San Diego. Hash House is all over Vegas, but we enjoy visiting the Plaza location. If you happen to be in Reno, Chicago or Orlando, you too can enjoy their outrageous portions.

My youngest son nearly fainted when he saw the size of his pancake on a previous visit. And hands down, our favorite menu item is the Fried Green Tomato Stack. Sadly, it's seasonal and was unavailable this visit. However, we have never been disappointed by our selections.

This past weekend, we decided to make Hash House our last dinner in Vegas. We even ordered (and shared) the Hammered Pork Tenderloin. It features two giant deep fried pork tenderloins and some amazing smashed potatoes. Not to be out done, the Blue Crab Cake appetizer was deliciously moist and generous.

One of my friend's ordered Andy's Sage Fried chicken which is one the menu favorites items, and he never got any fried chicken with it! Wtf?! We told the server twice and he still never got his fried chicken....

Another friend ordered eggs benedict without bacon, because she is a vegetarian and after sending it back twice, we figured the 3rd time would be the charm and guess what it still had bacon on it.

Oh and a 3rd friend ordered a house hash as well and asked for no cheese on it, and they brought it out with a shitload of cheese on it *sigh* 

We asked for those 2 meals to be removed from the bill, and even that took another half an hour to get taken care of.

anyway, the bf and i ordered the sage fried chicken benedict. i had this at the san diego location and it was pretty good. the bf hadnt had it before, so we decided to split it since i wasnt that hungry anyway. the waitress says ""that will be a $2.50 charge to split it... or you can get a side order of something if you want..."" so i look over the menu and all the side orders were $4.50. maybe if i was hungry, i might have just ordered a side of fries or something but i knew i wasnt gonna eat much so we just decided to suck it up and pay the $2.50. i should have just not said anything to begin with and just ate off the bfs plate. oh well. you win some you lose some. this benedict came with a chipotle sauce on top instead of the usual hollandaise sauce which was a bit spicy. personally i think the dish tastes better with the original sauce. 

my cousin got the meatloaf sandwich, which was a huge sandwich in between 2 or 3 inch slices of bread. the meatloaf was actually pretty bland. my other cousin got the sage fried chicken, eggs, smashed potatoes and biscuit. i forgot what its called, but it was basically like the benedict but without the sauce on top. my cousin asked for a side of gravy and the waitress again said there would be a charge. no thanks. 

a friend got the fried chicken sandwich, which was the sage fried chicken in between the same 2-3 inch slices of bread. he said it was good. it came with a side of fries which i tasted and thought it was pretty salty. another friend got a regular breakfast plate of eggs, smashed potatoes, ham and biscuit. 

i wanted to try the chicken and waffles since it has slices of bacon within the waffle. but they stop serving the chicken and waffles at 11PM. boo. oh well, its okay though because more than one person after wards said that the waffles arent that good anyway. 

overall i was disappointed. i wont be back and i dont recommend it.",a5aAfojhrYjlTdwi3-cFAg,3,1,1,ysAgNdI5nrz6WzIGv2YzFg

Bacon! Stuffed into a WAFFLE! Can you imagine that?

The service is slow, but it's understandable. At the time we arrived to eat here, our waitress was serving 7 tables in the early morning. She can alternate between Spanish and English (she's Caucasian), and had some unruly tables full of grumpy, whiney old people to deal with. 7 tops is ALOT of people to feed. So we had to give her credit for keeping her cool under pressure.

The atmosphere inside, versus outside the Plaza casino was just as significant as The Griffin bar on 6th street and Fremont. You have your shady fuckers bumming around and looking for change outside the casino (Fremont happens to be a major place for bums to mill about, and also is the drop off point for newly released inmates from the Clark County and City jails at the Golden Nugget valet), and then you got the more sociable folks coming inside to eat.

Let me start by saying that my wife and I are huge Hash House fans. We go to the West Sahara location regularly and have been to to the M Resort location as well and never had a bad experience. I wish I could say the same for our one trip the the new Plaza Hash House. The food was as great as it is at the other locations, but the service was very poor. There wasn't a friendly face in the restaurant, our meals were not served at the same time (lunches for the 5 of us arrived over about a 15 minute span) and it took nearly 20 minutes to get our check after our plates were taken away. The couple that was with us enjoyed their meal, but were so put off by the service that they said they probably wouldn't return. We assured them that the other locations didn't operate like the Plaza location. And no, I'm not a hyper-sensitive Yelper. I worked in the service industry for years and I understand the difference between a busy establishment where people are busting their butts and maybe it causes me to wait a few extra minutes. I have no problem with that. This restaurant was about half full and there was a lot of standing around going on. Hopefully the owner of this location will take some of these reviews about the poor service to heart and make some changes. I hate to say it, but my guess is that the employees of this Hash House are from the Culinary Union which for me would answer a lot of questions.",q2b4pAo_6tP7jNFKI5Hztw,2,1,2,U7EtpebFG3kNbAtTB4bu6A

My experience here was based on this, and I left completely satisfied and beyond full. If you're a party of 6 or more, you may have problems getting a table, so do consider the bar, especially if you want a beer. The selection is varied, the bartender knowledgeable. 

Obviously with a name like Hash House, the lure - and the top items on the menu - will be the hashes. These are huge, served in iron skillet-pans. They aren't your traditional hashes with the meats and potatoes nicely cut into small cubes. This is more like pulled meat with whatever else is included, on top of a pile of home fries, usually with 2 eggs and a jumbo biscuit with a large sprig of rosemary growing out of it for garnish and optional flavor. One person in our group opted for pancakes instead, and he was told not to order quite as many as he wanted - and rightly so. The pancakes were larger than the plate, probably larger than a Frisbee.

We stayed at the Golden Nugget in Downtown Vegas so Hash House a Go Go was an easy 5 minute walk. Not 100% sure what the parking situation is here, but most hotels have Valet, and I think they have there own lot somewhere down the street. 

On this trip I order the Sage Fried Chicken. Again, huge portion. The sage really came through on the chicken and the sauce was amazing. The chicken was fried, with a great crisp on the outside, but not greasy. It was placed on a bed of egg and bacon, which was followed by an enormous pile of hash potatoes, on top of two home made biscuits. The potatoes are great but there is way too much of them, and the biscuits are fantastic. Unfortunately the biscuits are stuck under the pile of potatoes so in order to eat them with the chicken you have to rescue them from the bottom of the plate. 

My Fiancee ordered the French Toast. One order comes with three huge pieces of French Toast topped with a caramelized banana and pecans. She ate one and a half pieces of French Toast before calling it quits. Overall she loved it and would order it again after trying a few more things first. 

I found the menu hard to read because it was wayyyy too cluttered. Also, we were there on a Wednesday at 11am with basically no body in the restaurant and the service was kinda spotty. We got seated right away but it took a while for someone to get a coffee order. We then had to get a busser to ask our waitress for a refill.

Well two 6 seater tables opened up and no one said anything to us until we asked and were told that we would be paying two separate checks one for our drinks at the bar and another from anything we ordered after we moved to the table so we just stayed. Then my wife was trying to order the HH Big Quesadilla and she wanted it without jalapeños because she's allergic and the waitress flat out said no. Then she asked for a Texas Ranchero and again she said no and she said it's because it's in the sauce. I asked well can we get a sauce without  jalapeños and her answer was ""Uh...no.""

I've always heard great things about this place and wanted to experience all the feels of this restaurant!

I went up to the host desk and there were two people there, one host on the phone, and the other just staring at her. After a few minutes of not being acknowledged I had to interrupt and ask if there was a wait.

The young gentleman apologized and told me the wait was going to be about 10-15 min. He did offer a seat at the bar, and since it was my first time, I wanted to full table experience.

After 20 minutes, I was seated.

While I was outside waiting, I noticed there were many people waiting to be seated, but while I was lead to my table, the dining rooms didn't look busy at all...perhaps they were understaffed today. 

The waiter I had was a nice guy but didn't bother to introduce himself. I knew what I wanted and placed my order and my ice tea came out pretty quickly.

Not too long after, my steak and eggs arrived. The plating of my food looked like a piece of art work, very colorful and very appealing.

The steak was cooked to my liking, medium rare, but I felt the steak was very thin. 

The grilled mashed potatoes were good, though a very huge portion. 

My eggs were perfect! Sunny side has always been my favorite. 

The biscuit was pretty huge, just shy of the size of a baseball. Served with marmalade and some fresh fruit tied it all together.

The whole experience all together was ok. Nothing stood out as a WOW experience.

The food, as pretty as it looked on the plate, didn't have any flavor. The dining experience from beginning to end wasn't a story worthy experience. 

The waiter and the hosts don't engage any of the customers.

Three stars is a fare gauge of my first time HH experience. 

The prices are a little more higher than any other diner but it's worth paying for if the food is fantastic and the experience is high level, not mediocre.

Place was crowded so we waited ten mins which wasn't bad. The host was loud but in a good way. Smiled a lot while she took us to our table. We were put in a booth along the outside of the restaurant. We were next to this glass that separated us from the casino. Worst part was how gross it was. Finger prints, mouth prints and food splatter all over it. I wanted to post a pic with this review but I really don't like those types of pictures on my Yelp. Honestly though we went early so we know t wasn't all from that day and with the amount caked on we knew it was sitting there for DAYSSSS. Maybe make it side work or a daily cleaning ritual because no guest should sit next to that while they are eating.

Our server I wish I remembered her name but she had glasses and blonde hair. Very sweet girl. A little quick to take our order. Other then that better service experience at this location than the other one. The coffees took forever which I know she probably doesn't make. It was the Caramel Latte and s'mores latte. For $9 the s'mores one MAY have been worth it but the caramel one wasn't. It was overly sweet and barely tasted anything coffee in mine unlike the other one. So kinda not worth it and had like 4 sips ""/ pretty expensive four sips lol.

The banana French toast was good. The way the cook the banana in the skin was rad. Smear the banana on the French toast with a little syrup and it's amazing. The quesadilla we had was mediocre at best. Barely any avocado in it though I paid extra for it. The cheese over powered the eggs. The tortilla part was hard and not soft so I can tell it was sitting in the window longer than the French toast.

Being in the eclectic people watching mecca of the west (also known as Fremont Street in Las Vegas) we settled on checking out the newly remodeled Plaza Hotel, and our first foray into the quirky ""Hash House a Go Go"" which just opened recently.

After getting welcomed and seated we both decided to feast on this big, bad sandwich:

""INDIANA FAVORITES

Big O'crispy hand hammered pork tenderloin sandwich
With onion, pickles & of course ketchup on a whole wheat bun served with your choice of side. You'll think you're back in Indiana!""

So when Tommy our server came to take the order, we rolled with it.

Except I made a fatal food service customer error.

I asked if I could have some *lettuce* added to the above.

See, as a former Hoosier, I grew up with pork tenderloin sandwiches. The staple of VFW Post lunches, greasy all night diners, and fairs & festivals. Except, as the HH description notes, it is not served with the 'traditional' IN combination of lettuce, tomato, and mayo. Understanding this, I figured I would compromise, and make just a minor deviation.

""Can I get lettuce added to mine also please?"", I asked.

*pause*

Tommy: ""you want lettuce on yours also. Uh, well, I can add it, except it would come as a side, so it will come as a ""side item"", and its an additional upcharge for $2.00. Did you want me to do that?""

Me: (silence while mentally calculating how two leafs of iceberg lettuce retails out to $2.00 in food service). ""Um, no that's okay, I can't justify that"".

Good thing I didn't ask for tomato and/or mayo then.

The meal came out and as described, the hammered tenderloin was HUGE. Mind you, this is how it is depicted.

Mine appeared a bit differently: Less fanfare in the presentation. Which was still okay. With no pickle. The thing is HUGE. And wasn't too bad taste wise.

Tommy was a great server. Brought a refill of drink out before less than 1/4 remaining- always a gold standard. Pronounced my last name on debit card spot on, which can be difficult. 

Tommy also said ""I checked with the manager about the lettuce and she said that they could not do it without charging extra... which I don't agree with personally"".

So all in all, this particular server is on top of his game. The food was decent, yet not remarkable. And my bill for the sandwiches, soda, lemonade and the fries? A staggering $39.00 for lunch with no adult beverages.

That's right. Kind of a pricey lunch for what you get, however I guess the portion size makes up for it.

With that said, the fact that you cannot make a simple addition like iceberg lettuce is the reason I will not go back to HH in Las Vegas. I can buy an entire head of lettuce for about 99 cents. I understand restaurants making profit, and certainly addition or substitutions can cost more. 50 cents extra? no problem, I guess. I come from an area where tomato is a seasonal item and can actually cost more off season (i.e. 'deluxe' on a burger). I guess for the same price I should have ordered the hamburger which comes 'deluxe' instead.

My point to the review/rant is that customers in restaurants often do need to make substitutions or changes out of dietary concerns, and I get that. However the server discussing it with the manager and her standing firm on that kind of a request for such a simple item is a bit out of line. I can get lettuce on by $1.29 BK double cheeseburger for nothing, because it is an inexpensive item. An upscale restaurant needs to have *some* flexibility to its policy on adding ""vegetables"" as a side item. Had I ordered a ""side of lettuce"", then I would expect to be charged more for it because that is known as a salad. I should have asked to trade for the pickle I never got on the sandwich instead and called it even.

I don't make a policy out of speaking to managers. The last time I did so (calmly and as we left) it led to a fight in the relationship, and I don't need that hassle either. So what is one to do?

Vote with my money.

And that is why I will not be back to Hash House A Go Go.",6uqguP6sSxcGrcjQtRob0g,6,2,1,ArvbgXnCZ3cthrri5dzoUw

For dinner, I had the griddled cheese and he had the stuffed burger. They were HUGE, we were not able to finish them. Delicious though, and our waitress was very nice. We tipped her a little extra. I also tried their strawberry lemonade margarita and it was AMAZING.

Breakfast was a little more disappointing, but not because of the food. I had the pancake combo and he had the chicken and waffles. Also huge portions, but at least we (well, me at least) were able to finish them. I also tried the kiwi watermelon lemonade which was also amazing.

The portions are huge and the food isn't served on regular plates, it's served on platters. My husband and I both got the farm benedicts. He got the pork tenderloin and i got the sage fried chicken. The sage fried chicken benedict, starting from bottom to top-- spinach leaves, a split biscuit, griddled mashed potatoes, sliced tomato, bacon, fried chicken breast, griddled mozz cheese, scrambled eggs, and chipoltle cream sauce! It sounds odd but it's to die for. I don't think we even made a dent in the food it was so large. Two people can definitely split one meal, maybe even three people. I also had the old school hot chocolate which was topped with 4 huge marshmellows and chocolate sauce. Very good. The service was great and they gave you plenty of time to order. Everything looked so good it was hard to decide. The prices were excellent too especially for a Vegas restaurant in a hotel. For the amount of food we got, 15 dollars per benedict was very good.

Our first attempt to hit the restaurant failed miserably, as we attempted to eat at the location on the strip around lunchtime and the wait was well over an hour. A few days later, we stopped by the location inside the Plaza on Freemont and the wait was a reasonable 15 minutes. (As an aside, I love the system they have. As soon as you put your name down, you get a text saying you're in the system. And then when your table is ready, you get another text. It's amazing.)

Obviously, I just had to order a hash, so I went with the Corned Beef (""Corned Beef, red onions and swiss cheese""). It arrived pretty quickly and it was enormous. The tender meat was slathered in cheese and onions and was, of course, quite irresistible, while the two sunny-side-up eggs were cooked perfectly. The dish was also accompanied by a soft-baseball-sized biscuit and a cup of homemade peach jam. (That jam is amazing, by the way. It basically tastes like a peach pie in jam form.)

My only real complain here is that the food was not hot when it arrived to the table. It had clearly been sitting under a heating lamp for a few minutes and that's a shame.",iRQ_YKpCBdaCwvc2X8_3NQ,2,0,4,pG7QQgmYIQjGnXYwt5wFVA

The coffee was piping hot and the level never was allowed to hit the bottom.  I really enjoyed my basic breakfast.  My husband got an apple pancake and the thing was huge.  Even he could not finish it and he is usually the one who finished my plate when we go out.  Now that is a lot of food.

The food was a solid four stars. It was really good and a little different.

The service was three stars. As in many Las Vegas eateries, they just don't seem to pay that much attention to customers.

Th kicker, though, was the parking. You pay $5 for the Plaza self-park as you enter the lot. Then you get your ticket validated by your food server, who tells you to take it to the booth for a refund of your parking fees. There are no further instructions - or signs - telling you that it isn't the parking lot booth where you paid. No, it's the cashier booth in the casino. So that's three stops to get your parking fee returned.

To begin with, I was sat in a booth that did not allow high chairs, apperantly it is a fire hasard to have a high chair slightly blocking a passage way... so then why was a sat here??? We were moved to a different booth, In which the crapiest server I've had in a long time was stationed, Mandi. 

We sat for about 10 minutes before mandy greeted us, by the time she finally came by I was ready to order. I asked for an Avacado burger and my gf had the brown sugar banana pancakes. To drink, we both had water. 

Mandi brought out our waters NO STRAW. Don't you just hate that lol. I would have loved to asked Mandi for straws but she was no where to be found. So I sipped straw-less. 

25 long minutes later, she finally shows up and lets us know she will find out what is taking so long with our order. She comes back to the table food and all. Makes me wonder if the food was ready before hand and she just then got around to checking. 

The food was amazing, it was worth the wait, my Avacado burger was yummy and HUGE. My gf's banana panckaes were so good too! The food is why this place even has 3 stars from me.

I'm always a sucker for the chicken and waffles - the chicken is wicked tender and moist, and I love the fried leeks all over the plate.
This time we tried the sausage and biscuits too, and they were ""almost Texas-good"", said my American-born husband.

The shake was presented beautifully and full of all the creamy, fatty goodness you would expect. The pancake was very large with bits of Snickers throughout. The sausages were flavored well and balanced out the sweetness of the pancake. The eggs were hearty to round things out.

4394803,2016-07-02,0,3ajqOW9A7VhResA08I7RTg,"Hash House A Go Go was a convenient spot for my family and I to have lunch at due to the fact that it is located right in the entrance of the Plaza Hotel and Casino. We hopped off our long flight and decided to grab a quick bite to eat after checking in at the hotel. My brother had been to this establishment before and actually recommended it to me, so I was actually really excited to have lunch here.

The restaurant definitely gets a star for their friendly staff. Our waitress there patiently took our orders and brought us everything we asked for in a timely manner. She had a cheery attitude and overall, made me feel much less stressed after my long travels. Later that night, I also came back to drop in to the bar to order that Watermelon Cocktail that the hotel had advertised on every wall. The bartender was also friendly and helped me out with my drinks quickly.
They do some pretty cool drinks and that warrants another star. During that lunch break I ordered a banana latte, which was fantastic. The warmth and general sweetness gave me a sense of nostalgia and made me feel like I was home. The Watermelon Cocktail that I got later on was also very good. Not too sweet and not too sour. Overall I was very happy with those.

Unfortunately, I was not that impressed with my meal. I ordered a mushroom burger and fries. I love mushrooms--usually I'll eat anything that it's smothered in--however, my burger tasted like it was lacking some flavor. I can't put my finger on what it was missing, but it just seemed sort of soggy and bland. The fries were great though and that really lightening the whole plate.
The atmosphere was as you could expect from a hotel lobby restaurant. The entire place was flooded with that strange smell that floats throughout the Plaza Hotel, almost like old cologne mixed in with the trademark Las Vegas cigarette smoke.

All in all, I'll probably dip back in for a drink or two if I'm ever in the Fremont Street area again, but I'll hit up a different place for lunch.",30XIQOD7ee05X8FK9rO2vw,0,0,2,u6V5NUOy_9J6PLs6JubiEw

If you like big breakfast and don't mind paying $15 to $25 per person for it, this place will make you very happy.  Service was good, food was good.

So why only 2 stars?  It's not you, it's me.  Personally, I'm not really into going out for breakfast, and when I do, I often get non-breakfast food and I'd rather go someplace inexpensive. When I splash this kind of cabbage around a restaurant, it's because I am getting dinner, and when I eat this quantity of food before 6pm I feel like crap for the rest of the day.  For these reasons, this place wasn't for me.  There are plenty of affordable breakfast options within a 2 block radius of 1 Main Street.  

The cheapest thing I found on the menu with any amount of protein - and by any I don't mean very much - was the bacon waffle at about $9.  It was good for what it was, but I wasn't really into it.  With coffee, tax, and tip that's like $14 for breakfast, for something I wouldn't otherwise have ordered.  I didn't see anything else I wanted for under $10, which is my hard breakfast limit.

Others in my party seemed very satisfied with their monstrous plates of chorizo and eggs, etc.  and their bacon bloody maries.  Some of them got a waffle on the side as well.  Rolling in coffee, cocktails, tax, and tip, I think most of them were spending around $25 to 35 each by the time they walked out of there.

Next time, I'll opt for the Cafe Cortez coffee shop or the Main Street Station buffet.",uFoLXDuKKbM6knOiQedVzw,0,0,2,cDVUNyVnGfFlRxER8fiKqA

Last week my friends and I finally went to Las Vegas for a week vacation and made it a point to eat here... and it was the BEST meal we had the whole trip!

The size of the plates alone took up 1/4 of the table.  The amount of food you get is absolutely ridiculous.  Plus the honey biscuits they give you... OMG they have to be a pound apiece.  

I had the famous chicken and waffles and almost had an orgasm at the table.  The waffles had bacon cooked into them and the fried chicken was perfection.  It had real maple syrup on it too, not that fake crap. 

 My friends got meatloaf and stuffed hamburgers.  All you heard during dinner was ""Ohhh my god this is soooo goooood!"".  

Our waiter was awesome and gave us the souvenir drink glasses for free.  I wanted to try the bacon bloody mary but my tummy was telling me NO!!!!

The prices were more reasonable then I thought they would be.   For 2 people to eat like pigs and bring more than half the food home, along with drinks, was only $37.  

After dinner we waddled back to our hotel and laid in the hot tub for a few hours to digest.  Then after a few hours of drinking and gambling, we ate our leftovers and they were even better!  LOL

We had the meatloaf, which was really good. It was so big me and my wife split it, and I was actually full afterwards. I wish more restaurants would serve portions like this.

Our service was not that great. Our waiter took our order, then we never saw him again until I asked another worker for our check. Some other staff member brought our food. No one ever came to ask how everything was ever. But other staff were around, and they were helpful if you flagged them down.

I gotta admit, the fried chicken was good. As good as some fried chicken places in LA. So there isn't a really huge surprise. And the fact that cooking fried chicken at home tastes as good... doesn't really justify the reputation this restaurant holds.
After the delicious fried chicken, the rest of the story was bland. Mashed potatoes were worse than most places, especially a dish holding a $17 head. Similar to the raw spinach, the raw tomatoes were both bland and lazy. And the tomatoes were especially hard. The bacon was over cooked and old, and added a horrible texture to the dish. 

The large size of this chain restaurant may be contributing to their descending taste.

Service

Restrooms 
Since this restaurant is inside of the casino you must use the casino restrooms when you exit will be on your left hand side next to subway 

Decor
Restaurants is decorated like a barn you can see pictures of farm animals and will find barley on your table 

Drinks
I was amazed at the grand selection of drinks they have a lot of great alcoholic drinks and non alcoholic drinks from chocolate smores not chocolate to bloody Maury pay 15 bucks and you get to keep a neat hashtogogo cup

Get ready to share the portions here are huge.
They still manage to decorate the plate with the huge portions. Everything was delicious.
I went with a group of friends we all ordered plates to share we ordered following
chicken and waffles 
Snickers pancake
French toast 
Chicken Benedict 
Roasted chicken

I know no other way to do this, than to split Hash House A Go Go into two reviews.

Review 1: solid 4 stars... maybe even five for the food.
Whenever we visit Vegas we eat at Hash House, usually multiple times.  Their fried chicken is the stuff of dreams, and their BLT Blood Mary holds a special place in my heart.  Seriously get that Bloody Mary.  It's a meal in itself.  And the chicken and waffles.... there's bacon in those waffles.  Inside of them.  It's a breakfast miracle!

Review 2: 1 star... service.
Can I even give service a star when it doesn't even exists at this place?  I image their training manual reads something the the effect of ""screw it, I'm drunk"".  Now here's your block t-shit, get out there kid!  I honestly do not know how my order is ever taken, and how the heck my food ever makes it to the table,  I believe the kitchen staff must have excellent hearing and have devised a way to cut the floor staff out of the process all together because anything these guys touch goes to crap.  Did you want another beverage?  Well, assuming you ever get the first one, too bad!  You will never see that server again! Someone else will drop off your food and run away from the table.  What's that? only half of your table got their food? Here's the check!

You know the kind that would give you an instant migraine. That is not Hash House A Go Go's fault but the smell is there and makes it hard for this one to be as appetizing as the rest.

I've been fortunate enough to the check out the M Resort location, I suggested we go and try the Plaza hotel location.

The look is very consistent to the south location.  You have table tops, you have booths.  Lots of wood and metal lining the tables and walls.  Tables have grains in vases.  It's exactly what they advertise:  Twisted Farm Food (and Decor).  I decided to sit at the bar and was helped by Mandy (blonde bartender).  She was nice and super timely.

For brunch, we started with mimosas for $6.95 each.  Served with an orange slice, this drink contains orange juice with lots of pulp, so be advised.  Not a problem for me, but I know some folks don't like pulp.  It still did the trick!  For my meal, I had the popular Sage Fried Chicken and Waffles for $16.95.  This dish was lined with bacon waffles with two huge breast pieces of Sage Fried chicken, accompanied with fried leaks, hot maple caramel reduction and a sprig of rosemary.  The chicken was amazing!  Super juicy for a breast, the batter was crunchy and seasoned very well!  Home run for me :)  another home run was the bacon waffles.  There's not just bits of bacon, but entire strips of bacon!  The syrup was on point, thick and sweet and really enhanced the overall flavor!!  What I didn't like was the fried leaks.  They were everywhere and made the plate look super sloppy.  Thank goodness they were edible because they kept getting in all bite.  Little irritating but not a huge deal.  What was a huge deal for me was the fact that my cousin's dish came out and I waiting more than 5 minutes until my dish came out.  I understand her dish was just a scramble, however, they should be aware of ticket times so the entire party gets their meals at once.  

Other than that, I would still return to this place.  What I've learned about Hash House is that it's affordable and really packed with flavor.  The crowds of people that wait for a table, no matter the location, is proof that this place rocks!

It's across the plaza and a good location and portions are huge!

Cons: 
The price, and depends on what you get.

Food Experience:
I was expecting something better when I ordered the HH special Benedict. It was not that great when I realized its sauce, mash potatoes on top that with large biscuits two thick slices of tomato, a sunny side up egg and more sauce. It was alright honestly.

Conclusion:
Overall don't go here if you're not gonna get the chicken and waffles. It's a brunch/breakfast joint as well. It's worth it at least once to see such large portions.",EXUypc_YLsWfVGtSFOPyIQ,0,0,3,D6ooujbH8pV-bnUggGXLGw

This place was packed during both times that I have been there for breakfast.  Even though they were packed; the bartenders (I sat at the bar since it was so packed) and waitresses were extremely friendly!

Even if you come in STARVING; I don't see how you can finish one of their ""Benedicts"".  They've become some of the best meals that I've ever had for breakfast.  This time, I tried their Blue Crab Benedict.  Let me tell you something...These guys DO NOT CHINCH on the crab!!! I got 2 really large crab cakes that were smothered in some of the most complex and delicious sauces and ingredients you could find while eating out.  

While waiting for breakfast (this food is freshly cooked, so you'll wait a bit), I knocked back a perfectly made Bloody Mary at their bar.  This didn't have any store bought cheapo mix..It's their own mix and it's one of the best I've had.  

Since the bar had great TV's, I ended up spending the ENTIRE DAY there!! I'm not kidding!  I watched 2 NFL playoff games, and was surrounded by nothing but friendly people as I bought bucket after bucket of beer (5 for $14)!

This place is one of two GREAT restaurants; not only in Downtown; but in Vegas PERIOD!  The food, and the Plaza Hotel are both huge reasons why Downtown Vegas is getting better each year.",4zjP4hB8SuO1eidapzk4Vg,1,0,5,kwQT-VGKvi06kX9WeJIGow

The table was so wobbly are water spilled like five times. Again was it good food yes it was good food. Was there enough for us to both share and yes it was. Did I feel uncomfortable there yes absolutely I did feel uncomfortable. I felt like they were like hurry up and Order and get out.

Once we were seated we were greeted by a super friendly lady who was very helpful.  Service seemed quick for how busy they are and we really enjoyed our food.

Highlights: Large portions, quick service, good food, pleasant service

Lowlights: Nitro Cold Brew coffee is a hard PASS. Don't do it... tasted watery and bland.  While I enjoyed my food they should really post the food they are going to add to the plate on the menu. I hate red and green peppers and made sure this was not listed anywhere on the menu. but when the food came out they garnished the entire plate with diced red and green pepper. I had to eat around it since it was already in the sauce.

5114366,2012-03-10,1,3ajqOW9A7VhResA08I7RTg,"Three Stars because:

1. The portions here are HUGE. Literally they can feed you for two meals. 
2. My boyfriend and I got seated in the booth next to Barry Bond's and Neil Patrick Harris' photos.
3. No wait, we were seated right away - we went at noon
4. When I asked for a small plate, they gave me a nice huge serving plate
5. Food is pretty good and displayed nicely

Cons:
1. Parking sucks around here. We parked at Las Vegas Club and paid five dollars. But then again downtown Las Vegas doesn't have free parking. 
2. The waitresses were really pushy. They were really just trying to get us to order and rushing us to leave. It was down time too. Almost no one was there. Rude in my opinion.

Okay. So I had trouble making up the list of Pros and Cons, but overall I give this place three stars. Would I go back? Not for a while, but I would if I had no where else to go. Maybe it's because we went to a not so popular Hash House A Go Go in Vegas.

My boyfriend and I ordered two dishes. At first we were originally getting just the Man vs. Food Favorite (Andy's Sage Fried Chicken Benedict), but then we saw people order the burgers and had to try one so we ordered the Fresh Mushroom and Swiss 1lb Burger.

Fresh Mushroom and Swiss Burger: The burger was actually kind of small. I didn't get any sides with it, but overall I'd give it 3.5. I've had better burgers. This one was just blah. I guess what got me was mushrooms, I love eating mushrooms, but this burger barely had any in it. It consisted of two meat patties, barely any mushroom, and one slice of melted swiss cheese. And in the end it only tasted like a burger I could get at any fast food store. 

Andy's Sage Fried Chicken Benedict: Overall it was good. The portion is humongous! My boyfriend and I could not finish it, but if you like CARBS, you'll enjoy this. It had bacon, mashed potatoes, scrambled eggs, biscuits, very little spinach, fried chicken, and some spicy sauce to finish. I have to say it was pretty good. It definitely had that spice to it! Overall I would give it 4. It's pretty unique, but you should eat it all. Don't eat leftovers of it, it sucks. 

Tip: You should wear elastic waist pants because food portions are huge. You'll definitely feel it after eating a meal.",6ImN7CLRvsDnrAx6DF4nIw,0,1,3,Rs0lHgQI3_HF1iGO3XKy8Q

I had the sundried tomato/goats cheese/basil scramble which tasted great and fresh, and came with a side of potatoes and a biscuit. The size of the meal actually wasn't huge, which I actually prefer as the size of meals in the US can be a little scary for a foreigner!

5164609,2014-06-23,0,3ajqOW9A7VhResA08I7RTg,"Hash House A Go Go in the Plaza is a family friendly diner with portions meant for sumo wrestlers and competitive eaters.  The food pile is truly a spectacle in a place where quantity seems more important than quality.

We tried the Fried Chicken and Bacon Waffles, the Andy's Sage Fried Chicken Benedict, and a House Salad.  

The Fried Chicken and Waffles was average.  The chicken was crispy enough, but wasn't juicy and didn't have a lot of seasoning.  The waffles didn't have a bacon-y flavor, we wished they had just given us some strips of bacon instead.

The Fried Chicken Benedict was like three separate dishes piled into one--literally stacked right on top of each other.  One dish would be fried chicken and mashed potatoes, another would be a biscuit with gravy, and the last would be an eggs and bacon scramble with spinach, tomato, and mozzarella.  With all that on one plate you can't really distinguish one flavor from another, but you can make every bite different.

The House Salad was the standard bag mix of iceberg lettuce, nothing special.

This place is just ridiculous...in a good way.  We've eaten at this and other locations several times on various Vegas visits and it's always good.

I wasn't really that hungry so I intended to take half back to the hotel to eat later, but when I pointed out the bone to the waitress she took the food away and got the manager.  He took off 1/2 the price of the entree (which was well over $20) which was fine, had I had more than 3 bites before it was taken away.  So, I paid about $12 for about $4 worth of food.

Crappy experience, but all the others have been great, so I'll chock it up to an off-day.

Moi! It's eggs and meat and bread and starches. Every lovely food group that I've ever loved all on one plate.

I had the corned beef house hash. It was by far one of the greatest meals ever and an unexpected breakfast dish. It had a huge portion of corned beef topped with some Swiss cheese.  I've never been a Swiss fan as I think the aftertaste of it is quite outputting, but with the saltiness of the beef, the cheese worked well and was mighty tasty. There was also a huge helping of potatoes, your choice of two eggs, and a biscuit. All in all, it was enough for two meals for me. I'm one of those people that usually can't finish a normal sized portion, let alone a breakfast big enough for a caveman BUT since there wasn't a fridge in the room, I forced myself to eat it all and walk around with my pants un-buttoned for the day.

Snicker's Flapjack

Already having visited the location on Sahara along with those within the (then) Imperial Palace as well as the Rio, it was with a full compliment of family that breakfast was ordered amidst the spacious confines of Hash House a Go-Go at the Plaza, but with substantial delays and subpar service marring this rendition of the San Diwego import the overall experience was less memorable than all had hoped for, though the ""Twisted Farm Food"" was largely just as good.

Known for its enormous portions and perhaps even more famous in Las Vegas than at home in the Golden State, it was first to a substantial wait for a table despite the restaurant being almost 2/3 empty that we stood at the podium after arriving at 8:30, another protracted delay to follow as servers seemed completely lost as to who was responsible for which table, then further complicated  by a similar wait for both food as well as drinks.

Not one to suffer such annoyances well, particularly after an early rise and nearly twelve-mile early morning run, it was finally after wondering aloud why such a delay was taking place that coffee was refilled and plates began to trickle forth, the benedict still fifteen minutes away with a steaming block of bread pudding oddly arriving first.

Previously impressed by the molten brownie topped in chocolate, caramel, and nuts with ice cream slowly forming a pool of creamy vanilla sauce, it was after a few bites that attention was turned to the hubcap sized pancake studded in the similar flavors of Snickers that attention was turned, the buttermilk largely overwhelming the candybar when topped in butter and pure maple syrup brought from home while the French Toast was rich with the flavors of cinnamon and vanilla custard plus skin-on bananas, the presentation a bit slipshod though perhaps also the most ""down home.""

Always attuned to the presence of biscuits, those at Hash House a Go-Go of the larger, fluffier variety popular throughout the Midwest, it was alongside the signature chicken that a quartet of golden rounds was brought forth, each amongst the best in Sin City while the mountainous Benedict buried the one included beneath crispy well-seasoned bird and fresh vegetables, the addition of bacon, cheese, at least three eggs, and smoky cream sauce no doubt making the Man vs. Food Classic a dish best shared.

Offering more support than most for the sort of early morning gluttony through which  Hash House a Go-Go has made its name it may warrant further visits to determine precisely why the service was so awful during this visit to the one at the Plaza, but unless one is restricted by transportation the better bet would seem to be a trip to the locations with better service (and free parking) on Sahara, 24/7 in the Rio, or Stripside at The Linq.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,9,4,2,l0bVnKqF5UDXwJ2xEy6Hig

Okay, I heard this place was good and the portions were gigantic. I had to see for myself. 
I arrived on a Thursday shortly after 10a and the there a lot of people waiting. Thankfully Bar is ""FCFS"" so my friend & I got lucky right away. I ordered the chicken & waffle and it was delicious but way more than my petite stomach can hold. Food came quick and service was good at the bar. I observed the waiting list moved fairly quickly so don't be discouraged by the line. 
So this is a great place to share meals: chicken & waffle was 2 fried chicken breasts + 4 waffles so you can definitely share.

This particular location has a questionable? placement inside the plaza hotel and casino and is right in the corner of the downstairs, dragging in all the smoke smell and weirdos from outside. 

Normally their service is pretty standard, but this location I felt was significantly slower and the staff was rude. The bar staff area especially. We sat at the counter because there was a ridiculous line, and the bartender didn't even greet us for 10 minutes. The counter is not that big, and she had help. So coming from a person who worked in restaurants, she's just lazy and probably shouldn't be working a fast paced place that counts on regulars (as well as tourists) and not being friendly or curious to customers, also a necessity.

The food itself took FOREVER to come, we had plans to go on a helicopter tour and were almost late for our pick up because it took an hour and a half to be seated, be greeted, order, get our food and bother the staff to pay. Our food was not brought out at the same time, actually my dad got his food about 20 minutes before mine. He had a huge breakfast with eggs, potatoes, pancakes and meat, this took almost an hour for him to get. All I had was fresh fruits and oatmeal which for some reason took even longer then his food....???

Needless to say this was the worst experience I ever had at a hash house in my 6 years living in Las Vegas and I won't ever be back to this location. Even asking them for a to go box, or where my food was after an hour, or getting silverware for my meal was a hassle to them and they were rude about it.

My first impression was that the restaurant was dirty. The carpet looked old and the menus were a bit rough/worn out. It was also very HOT in the restaurant. Their air conditioning did not seem to be working properly. We had to ask to be moved to another section of the restaurant.

The prices were pretty standard for Vegas $10-20 for each meal. I ordered ""The Basic"" which came with sausage, toast, eggs and grits. All were pretty good. My sausage was very tender and flavorful. The grits were not bad, but not as good as we make them in Charleston!

My friend ordered the Farmer's Breakfast (?) which came with a MASSIVE pancake - one that we split. It was pretty good but I found it was tough to cut...a bit rubbery. Not fluffy.

I will say, our waitress was completely on her game - always quick with the refills, extra napkins, clearing plates and bringing the check. She was a star.

Staff: nice, friendly, courteous, and timely
Restaurant: average ambiance, clean, spacious
Prices: pretty good relative to other Vegas restaurants
Portion size: very large; good place to split a meal

The food itself it fine. A friend had the HH original benedict, which was huge and covered with red pepper cream instead of hollandaise sauce. There was a lot going on with that plate. It was OK. My husband had the basic. Eggs were cooked just fine, and the bacon was pretty ordinary. The biscuit was pretty dry and definitely needs a good amount of butter and/or preserves. I had the sundried tomato, goat cheese, and basil egg scramble. It was a nice flavor, with lots of sundried tomatoes, but I didn't see or taste any basil. Accompanying crispy potatoes were pretty bland, and accompanying fruit was a single slice of orange and a single slice of melon (I was expecting a bit more).

That being said, I didn't feel like I was completely ripped off after eating here.

We were seated fairly fast. But it seemed they gave us too small a table for 3 adults and one child. And knowing we had a toddler with us, it was not so kid friendly. Items all over the table, in reach of the high chair. 

My server was not so friendly, not so attentive and just wasn't on her game. But I told myself, it would be worth it. Everyone raves about this place. But I should have trusted my gut.If you start off with a poor server, then it can't get much better. 

The server kept rushing and rushing us. RUDE!!! So we ordered and per suggestion of the server, I ordered the Sage Fried Chicken Benedict. My husband ordered the Tractor Driver Combo. For my son, I ordered a grilled cheese off the kids meal.

Let's break it down.

Chicken Benedict = Dry, Bland and piled high with ""mashed"" potatoes. I quote ""mashed"" because right in the middle of my mashed potatoes were two whole potatoes that somehow were forgotten. The egg on my meal was dry and tasteless. They could have cooked it in the microwave because that is sure what it tasted like. The fried chicken was hard and dry as well. No seasoning to be found. 
The best part of my meal was the melted cheese all over the dish, in fact it was the only thing i found appetizing on my plate. The next best thing on my plate were the biscuits. They were pretty fresh and good. But they were not the ""highlighted"" or ""featured"" items on my dish. 

Grilled Cheese from kid's menu = Let's admit it. Most kids are picky. Their palletes are not developed and they love and enjoy simple things. So why in the heck is Hash House using thick cut, hearty bread on a kids grilled cheese i have no idea why. NOT KID FRIENDLY. So i asked the server if we could replace the fresh fruit that came with the grilled cheese with french fries. The answer was no and if I wanted fries, i would pay additional. Fine, whatever. I got to feed my son.

The fries came out and they were delicious. Hence why they get the one star. I ate more of the fries than I did my own meal.

Tractor Driver Combo = over cooked pancake, sausage was still pink in the middle. The eggs were okay. However severely over priced.

The whole time we were eating we kept smelling curry and could never quite figure out why. There is no curry on the menu from what I could see.

We will not return to Hash House A Go Go in the future ever. 

Just a friendly tip, none of the servers here seemed to helpful. They all milled around gossiping and talking.  One even told us we were in the thier way but we were seated at our table. I couldn't quite figure that one out.",U0WU9d6gpMNkO_tPXK58Sg,7,4,1,FePuThbr1l3rtNshkrG1ow

I tend not to eat anything I take home in a doggy-bag, so I probably would only go back if a friend was visiting and really wanted to give it a go, and wanted to share the meal.",Q1s8saWck0a5pGbi4Xe0cA,0,0,3,20AMP8apSBSyTFGzyry9jw

The menu is pretty big and their portions are huge. If you stop by for a happy hour you will save a lot of money on drinks.,wwKQ3KG83TB3va3rUfIbTg,1,0,5,_T0xxAx9ub8FyqBv5AKbXQ
