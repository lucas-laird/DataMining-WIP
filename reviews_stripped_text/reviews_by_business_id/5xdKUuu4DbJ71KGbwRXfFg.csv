I prefer this over monta because it's not as rich as the monta broth that hurts my stomach after I'm done, also monta is always packed from start to finish and is in the middle of chinatown. My only problem with this place is that its more expensive then monta. Montas ramen is about 6 or 7 dollars, this place charges 9 dollars for ramen and that's not including your extras. But it's right down the street from my job so I can't complain too much. Also you can choose your spicy level. All in all I definitely will be coming here like once a week.",dLgN7oX2ZpxnDffsiXPMzA,0,0,5,kFq8golf0KA8qgEu7I9v2A

They make the ramen noodles fresh and in-house  you choose from several choices of broths that come with standard fillings. From there, you can add many different ""sides"" to customize your bowl. It's well-priced and the food is absolutely delicious. My two-year-old even loved it! The only potential downfall is it's very small so big parties would be hard to accommodate, and I can see the wait would be really long in peak hours. So, my advice is to go early if you don't want to wait too long. I highly recommend Ramen Kobo!",-EdydGwbdaqcDFBpaMNYbQ,0,0,5,J04kHnvRw4JcFhC9JUnPwQ
31594,2016-07-30,0,5xdKUuu4DbJ71KGbwRXfFg,"Visiting Las Vegas with family. We had 4 adults and 5 kids (ages 3 to 11). I'm  from California and had traditional Japanese ramen. This is not traditional but I don't  think this was their intention. They make their noodles in house. The noodles taste good but is again not traditional ramen noodle..it is starchy. If anyone has tried Korean Chinese food, the noodles most resembles that. 

One can choose from a variety of broth and they come with a little bit of toppings. I wouldn't suggest adding extras unless you want an egg. I like spicy so I had spicy miso (medium spicyness). It was good and tasted like jampong. I ordered miso broth for my kids. This is where they miss the mark. Because the noodles were starchy,  their soup became thick and starchy. This least resembles Japnese ramen broth which is light in texture and flavorful. 

I also ordered a small wgg roe rice (see pic) which I enjoyed but also not traditionally Japanese. The egg roe they use is is a Korean egg roe which is salty. I still liked it. The rice with pork was a good optiom for kids.

The place is small. They had to split us.",c48eR08HG1V7vKhzVhc3QQ,0,0,3,kk2VUlbPYTqs_jOuMW8P8A

Normally I don't care to write a review even though I'm quite the noodle aficionado, but I was certainly compelled to as I was quite disappointed to find out your restaurant was closed when I made it a point to take time out of my day and to drive over to your location specifically to try you folks out at 3pm - just to find out you were closed. You most certainly should post your hours on Yelp so other reviewers are aware of your gap in hours, closing at 2:30pm just to reopen at 5pm. Or post it on the web since everyone has access to the Internet nowadays and that info would have been most helpful. Even though you have Monta Ramen and Monta Chaya under your belt, I would rethink the financial strength of this new business venture and the ingredients compromised if saving 2.5 hours out of your day helps your bottom line NOI. And hopefully I won't see this facility show up on Dirty Dining as well like Monta in the past. And so considering you are promoting the grand opening of your restaurant, this is certainly a easy way to lose business and to lose a client like myself.",VMDB51Lz1Zer5QuN8FyPIg,1,0,1,ObYcNC1MjJYAhJysfLybEw

Anyway, the service was great and everyone was very friendly. The menu, while small, is still good as they at least offer fried rice in place of more traditional appetizers. Usually ramen fills me up so I don't always go for appetizers anyway so its not a big deal to me. That said, I think it would be greatly appreciated if they expanded their menu a bit. Not going to knock it for lack of gyoza.

The food was great! I got the shoyu ramen as I like lighter ramen in the summer months and it really hits the spot. Very similar to Monta's style of ramen. And you can even see the noodle machine working. Freshly made noodles are always a good sign.

Not sure why so many people are complaining about the size of this place, its an average sized ramen shop, why would you bring a large party? All the decent shops in Chinatown are similar size as well.

The menu is very simple and straightforward so nothing confusing on there! I ordered the Tonkotsu broth (came with black mushrooms, chives, bean sprouts, ground beef, pork shashu and bamboo shoots but I omitted the bamboo) with Hot spice level.

We didn't have to wait too long for our food, maybe 15 minutes before it came out. The broth was quite creamy, and since I enjoy spicy, the Hot level had a nice kick but not anything crazy for me. My favorite part were the noodles! They were nice and thin, and I could tell they were handmade.

622710,2017-08-18,0,5xdKUuu4DbJ71KGbwRXfFg,"Just walked out of this ""four-star"" ramen place with my friend and are we glad we have a place to vent and will explain why here: First, the broth was okay. Noodle (whatever and however you have going on behind the window near the entrance) was nothing special. Servants are very polite to some degree some might get annoyed and call them fake. Funny to see the cooks were Hispanics and tried to greet customers in Japanese with a heavy accent (this does not factor into our rating). Hear this: our ramen soups had no eggs and only one thin piece of pork. Are you kidding us!? This is America where we are not as tiny as some of you and we don't pay adult prices to be served tiny kids meals!!! They served just about everything from chashu pork, fried garlic, black mushrooms, chives, ground pork, bamboo shoots, sesame oil, and shredded red pepper ultra small so you don't get enough and have to  pay more (close to $20 per bowl) to get more. Maybe we should be as STINGY as them but one star is the CHEAPEST I can give so there you have it. We don't see the value here at all. In fact, not even close. We have paid less and received a lot more (four ultra-thick porks and realistically maybe 20 times more than here) before. If you want the name of that restaurant, contact us and we'll gladly inform you which one it is). This restaurant is just way too STINGY and we will NO DOUBT NEVER BE BACK! Moving forward, we better turn off our phones now to save power (and money) as the lesson I learned eating at such a STINGY dining establishment.

This last visit I went for miso broth (pork and chicken) and I also added an egg and corn. My noodles were a little under cooked on top so I just mixed them to the bottom and that finished them off. They were fairly busy so I think that's why the noodles were ready all the way through but it wasn't really a problem. Service was good when we sat but we did have to wait a while for the check even with our dishes having been cleared already.

677874,2016-10-18,0,5xdKUuu4DbJ71KGbwRXfFg,"Before this I used to go to Monta Ramen when visiting family in LV.

The only type of ramen I eat is Tonkotsu broth based. This place now ranks right under my #1 ramen spot which is tied between the Ajisen Ramen chain (because of the Ajisen Special ramen with spice bow) and Tampopo Ramen in Tempe, AZ.

First of all, they make their noodles in-house just like at Tampopo, and have one of the limited number of noodle making machines in the USA as well, I have only seen 3, Tampopo in Tempe AZ, Underground Ramen in SF, and this one, so it's always exciting. As expected, the noodles were top notch, and the broth was only below the best by the slightest of margins.

The thing that put this place at 5 stars for me was the fried pork belly that I ordered with my side of fried rice, O.M.G!!! That was soooooo good.  I requested that it's be crispy and it did not disappoint. Order fried rice with a  side of crispy pork belly when you go.

In conclusion, I love this place and will not be going back to Monta when I am in LV, just because Ramen KoBo is now on my list of not only faves in LV but top in my list overall.",ckmkpROcN8Rn1wx2Ap-9sA,3,0,5,qe7180oG291pYcLtw_j2rg

Both times had excellent flavor of ramen. Well-seasoned, miso and tonkatsu broth soups was extremely flavorful! Noodles were thin and it was the perfect portion. 

Service was attentive. Food came out fairly quick. The only couple things that stops me giving this 4 stars is the fact that my bowl came out lukewarm to barely warm. My extra chashu was also cold in my soup. I'm talking like freshly sliced and pulled from the fridge type of cold. I figured whatever, it's still freaking delicious, it's also really, really busy on a weekend an hour before closing. 

The next day, I'm still craving ramen, so my friend and I go in and we order. I get a miso broth with mild spiciness, extra chashu, and nori. Same thing happens, chashu is less cold (still feels it was refrigerated) this time and ramen broth is still just warm, not hot. Like it's been sitting out for a while.
 
Both times, the pork chashu was just so-so, kind of flavorless. I'm not going to get a third time. Soft boiled eggs I had in my ramen both times were good, flavorful, perfectly made. 

I know I could have said something, but I didn't want to be known as ""that person"". I'm not a picky eater by any means either. The ramen is still amazing, service was fantastic, but I can't really overlook the  barely warm ramen. I don't need it scalding hot, just maybe a bit hotter like ramen should be. I'm still definitely coming back, and maybe I caught them on another off night. Or maybe a customer complained that the ramen was too hot before? I still recommend this place as a good casual eat, but I don't know about taking someone that's a bit more pickier than I am.

I ordered the tonkatsu ramen and pork belly bowl. The ramen was excellent. The noodles are made fresh in-house. You can actually see this in action right before you walk into the main entrance. The broth was not salty. This was very appetizing since all of the ramen spots I've tried in town are too salty to the point where I am unable to finish the soup. You can easily distinguish the fresh tasting noodles. It was very smooth and the texture was perfect. This bowl was the first ramen bowl that I have ever finished. I only got the half bowl of the pork belly. It was served over rice. The belly was sliced very thin with just the right amount of seasoning. The rice used is the sushi grade quality. Tender with a hint of sweetness. All the condiments were neatly arranged. I also like that they still have napkin dispensers at arm's reach. Prices are very reasonable.

They should eat monta's and theirs side by side and do some tweaking.  Like mine was the miso one and it still lacked salt.

Although the place was small, I was quite impressed with how well the staff was at handling the seating situation. I've never seen anyone wait longer than ten minutes!

Right when you walk in and get seated, the server says something in Japanese... not sure what, I'm assuming it's along the lines of ""New meat coming thru.."" lol or more like ""Welcome our guests.."" and then the entire staff responds back in Japanese with a welcome! I'm not sure, but it's pretty cool.
So you order a ramen bowl by the broth & all the bowls come with the same things. You can take things out & then add things for an additional price. They also have a spiciness level... so if you're not into spice at all I would stick to original.

Our friends ordered their favorite shoyu ramen bowl & added a few things. My husband & wanted to stay close to home just ordered a pork tonkotsu (pork broth) ramen & I got the miso (pork & chicken broth) ramen. They also got their own pork belly bowls, but hubby & I decided to share.

I have to say the broth was rich, the noodles were fresh (they make them in-house), & it was pretty delicious. I loved the pork belly bowl though because it was super fatty & the taste was light but extremely yummy.... the fatty goodness from the fried pork belly soaked thru the rice & mmmm, it was delicious.

1230231,2017-11-22,1,5xdKUuu4DbJ71KGbwRXfFg,"Ramen KoBo is a small noodle joint with a significant wait time during prime lunch hours. We waited as a party of four for Saturday lunch for about 20-25 minutes before being seated. The service was great and friendly, so let's cut right to the ramen. We had the tonkatsu and miso ramen plus a small rice bowl with salmon roe. Everything was delicious. The tonkatsu broth is on point! I added black garlic oil for an additional $1.00 which made the broth a lot more earthy and savory. It is an intense flavor so I wouldn't recommend for those who prefer a lighter broth. You can add extra toppings for additional cost to what they already provide. The noodles had a great texture. BEWARE the spice level - I asked for mild and it felt like medium to me - if unsure you should just ask for the hot sauce on the side.

The only suggestion I would make is to give one more slice of meat for the standard ramen bowl. One thin slice is a bit stingy. But the rest of the food is great and if you like noodles (and don't care too much about meat) you will enjoy this place.",oEqB6qGiV2K3q8g2A8rfYA,3,2,4,DYFobsEg8hOec95pqGRlXQ

We met up at 1230 and instantly got a table. The store itself is small, length wise, similar to Monta in seating capacity. Decor is nice and simple, with long wooden boards oriented vertically  lined up the wall for a nice high feeling. Different from the usual Monta decor. Also, they make their own ramen, in house, in the glass room, facing the exterior of the restaurant ! Mmm love fresh noodles ! I dont care if its pasta or la mien or ramen or udon. So good ! This is the main reason why i came to try this place ! 

Service was quick and friendly. We were asked our drink orders as soon as we sat down, by 2 different people, in a spread of like 10 seconds. Lol 

We had waited for our late friend before we had ordered our food. 

----------------------------------------------------

Their menu is very simple. If anything, its identical to Monta's except with the choice of a spicy level. 

1. Pick Your Broth - Shoyu Ramen (Chicken Broth), Tonkotsu Ramen (Pork Broth), Miso Ramen (Pork & Chicken Broth), and Vege Ramen (Vegetable Broth). All priced at $8.95. 

Shoyu, Tonkotsu, and Miso Ramen comes with 1 slice of Chashu Pork, Fried Garlic, Kikurage Black mushrooms, Bamboo Shoots, Fresh Green Chives, Ground Pork, Sesame Oil, and Shredded Red Pepper. 

Vege Ramen comes with Fried Onion, Shredded Green Onion, Tofu, Spinach, Corn, Ginger, and Fresh Green Chives. 

2. Pick Your Spicy Level. Original, Mild, Medium, Hot, Fire. 

3. Pick Your EXTRA Topping (Prices Vary) - Chashu pork/chicken, Ground pork/chicken, Spicy Fish Roe (Mentaiko), Kikurage Black Mushroom, Shredded Green Onion, Soft Boiled Egg (Nitamago), Mustard Green (Takana), Spinach, Kimchi, Bamboo Shoots, Nira Chive, Roasted Seaweed (Nori), Black Garlic Oil, Bean Sprouts (Moyashi), Corn, Butter, and EXTRA NOODLE. 

Also the usual side dishes available. Fried Rice, Kimchi Fried Rice, Pork Belly Bowl, Chashu Bowl, and Mini Mentaiko Bowl. 

----------------------------------------------------

I had ordered the Tonkotsu Ramen, FIRE, with a soft boiled egg. Normally if this was for dinner or something, id probably get extra noodles too, but i just woke up maybe an hour or so prior to this, so my stomach is like meh xD haha can't eat that much. 

Fairly quick to deliver the food, after the table next too us got theirs. 

Noodles are unique to this location. If you had ever had Monta previously, its more towards thick than thin. But not too thick. So in between the two. Noodles cooked very well. Al dente. Perfect chewiness. Best part of the meal ! I want more ! but i was full. xD 

Broth is flavorful but still pretty heavy, like the usual tonkotsu. FIRE spicy level adds a pretty good kick to it all. 

Fried garlic is something new. Though its more like a roasted garlic vs a fried garlic. But i cant complain since i LOVE garlic. Had to throw in another spoonful of garlic anyway hehe :P 

At Monta, you'd normally receive i believe 2-3 slices of chashu pork. But at Kobo, you get 1 slice of chashu pork, but in return, you get a small mound of ground pork. Not too bad. Their chashu pork seems pretty similar to their sister locations. Fatty xD Ground pork not overcooked and rough. Fairly decent. 

Nitamago was cooked nicely. Maybe a little over a perfect soft boiled. Still has a nice golden, rich, and creamy yolk. 

Aside from the normal toppings, the chives was a nice touch. I am a HUGE fan of chives and love anything with them. 

Overall, not bad. Close convenient location for the people who live in the SW or a teasing/torture style for those who walk out of the EOS gym. Nice to have more options now in the area.

While your waiting you do get to watch the noodles being made which is really cool. 

It didn't take long to get a spot at the bar since there were just two of us. The ramen was amazing, we both ordered Veggie Ramen and added egg, mushroom & bean sprouts. Our order came very quickly & it was soooo good! Perfect for a chilly windy Vegas night.

Luckily from the texture of the noodles, it does seem freshly made (ahead of time).

Another disappointment was the taste of the broth.  We ordered miso and tonkasu and it both fell short. Not to mention we also asked for spicy and it wasn't as spicy as we imagined 3 pepper signs to be.

First time having chives in Ramen rather than scallions??? Cha Shui was sliced super thin. Also add ons toppings were around $1-1.50, more than average ramen joints around town.

First, the ramen. I ordered tonkotsu ramen, with extra noodles and black garlic oil on the side. At first glance, the bowl was aesthetically pleasing, and looking at it will make you hungry. The first thing I tasted was the stock. This stock was light and on the creamier side of pork bone soup. My only gripe with this is that the stock was a bit too light. All the toppings overpowered the broth and stood out too much. Any addition of the black garlic oil along with my second round of noodles overpowered the bowl completely. The noodles, however, were great: excellent bite out of the bowl, not too tough, not too soft. The noodles made much of the ramen eating experience.

Service was pretty nice. The lady at the front guided us to our seats and a young man took our orders. Our waters were refilled at a reasonable pace, food came out quick, and the staff was friendly.

As an appetizer they offer a small and regular sized pork belly bowl which is my favorite thing on the menu. The size of the pork belly is perfect on top of a bed of rice and topped off with chopped green onions.

As a few others have stated, I've been to, and will keep frequenting the other Monta locations but this one has to work on a few things. 

In my opinion two major components in ramen make it work... Noodles and soup. Noodles here are thinner than the other two Monta shops and in my opinion not as good.  They were soft and had no texture imho. It may have been an off day but the other two Monta shops don't have off days with their noodles. Soup was decent but much less flavorful and had lots of floating fat chunks which the other two shops don't. I don't think it's a flavor thing, instead maybe rushing the process of the broth. 

My mild miso came with bean sprouts which I never ordered, and after taking them out my server noticed and made a comment about me not liking them... Sorry but I didn't order bean sprouts, but was definitely charged for it. Weird. Minor mistake but left a bad taste in my mouth...could've been the chunks of fat 

If you're going to mention you're a part of the Monta family, understand you'll be held to high standards. Those standards have not been met at this location just yet.",6FHHrEdx8Gnq4f3rBSc5PQ,1,0,3,yxDdheoYl3UxopZdeVLhUw

Very small restaurant and you get hit by cold air every time the door opens. 

The menu is very much ""Build-your-own""  You can choose the broth, spice level and and extra ingredients. 

I felt it was slightly expensive as I added a soft boiled egg and extra pork and my total was over $13. My gf did the same and added shaved green onion so hers came out over $14. 

I ordered the pork broth, chashu pork and egg and medium spice and it was very good. They handmake their own noodles which you can see through a window as you walk through the entrance. 

Only reason it doesn't get 4 stars is the price. I could get close to the same thing for $5 cheaper.",UXd56jH3f76kppekXqui9g,0,0,3,WzwmxNnu9_cWaTCpMPPwgw

Went for a weekend dinner, sat at the bar since the tables were full.  Had the miso ramen & a side of fried rice.  

The Miso Ramen was OK.  It lacked depth in the flavor.  The house made noodles were the straight variety, so it wasn't able to pick up lots of the broth like a wavy noodle would.  Overall, was just OK.  Not as expected.

Was able to taste the Tonkatsu Ramen.  The broth had more depth, but didn't knock my socks off.  Just OK.

The fried rice lacked pizzazz. Was just content.  Another OK vote.

I used to love this place all due to their delicious pork chashu, which was creamy, full of flavor, and would fall apart at the attempt of picking it up with the chopsticks. 

However, during my last 2 visits this month, the pork chashu was served cold, as if they just pulled it out of their fridge. The broth is hot and the meat is cold? (Wut?) Not only that, but it is now very tough and flavorless as well, almost to the point of needing other utensils to cut it.

I asked the servers what changed and they said nothing but I've been here enough to recognize the difference. I probably won't return.",8_rJiOn2SNC_HtstUgzBjw,0,0,3,HQJKAiF8_zhxCO31xUh_dQ

We tried the kimchi fried rice with pork belly on top and this was delicious! The fried rice was better than the ramen. 

I tried the Miso ramen spicy level mild and it had a nice kick to it. What I don't like is that it does not come with egg while places like Sora include egg with the ramen. The broth was ok, I have had better broth. Another thing I don't like is that our ramen came with 1 tiny piece of Chasu, they want to charge for egg and extra Chasu while other places give you decent portion of Chasu without having to order extra! They also don't have any appetizers like gyoza, you can only get ramen and fried rice. 

The restaurant is small and tight, people bumped into me while I was seated at the bar area. The parking is also pretty small, cars were waiting in line and fighting for spots. I would not mind all this if the ramen was amazing but it was not. Will go elsewhere for ramen without all the hassle.

I wish I left my order all original to give it a more equal comparison to other Vegas ramen. Instead I got too excited and ordered the tonkatsu with black garlic oil and spice level hot. This ramen joint is about the spice level so be a bit adventurous with your spice level. It isn't as spicy as I thought it would be but I have been told that my level of spicy is pretty much lava. Next time I will get spice level fire. Mind this, you can ask for chili on the side if you want to be cautious. The chili they use has a good kick that hits you in the back of the throat but it does go away fairly quickly. It's not smokey the way some dried chili oils are. Kobo's chili is a ground dried chili with oil rather than an oil with dried chili bits in it. This allows the chili oil to not overpower or sit on top of the broth. Normally the oil will add extra fat/heaviness to the already rich tonkatsu broth but it doesn't. I would recommend people to add on extra chashu. You only get one slice in the regular order but the extra comes with 4 slices. The noodles are a little thicker since they are homemade. It's good and you can taste the freshness BUT I am a thin ramen noodle kind of girl. 
Let's compare Kobo to two other ramen places: Moko and Monta. Kobo is definitely way better than Moko. It's plain and simple that Kobo's flavor is just taste better. I have tried Moko on many occasions and it's not bad. Kobo's broth surpasses Moko's broth. Now compared to Monta, Kobo is just a step behind. Yes Kobo is the product of Monta, but the only reason for my opinion is the noodles. Like I said before, I am a thin noodle person. I prefer the snap of the thin noodles rather than the softer homemade noodles. Both broths are fantastic. The chashu is fantastic. Service is great. Just because I prefer Monta's noodles does not mean I hate Kobo. This was my first visit but not the last. Definitely my new ramen place. 

Added note: the parking is soooooooooooo much better than Monta's parking lot. I have changed dinner plans before when Monta didn't have any parking in the parking lot or side streets.",Qqvt9tENw_qvSdeDM3ifoQ,0,0,4,0Eo1WNQEBwLkDgBjL_iVSA

2267329,2016-06-07,1,5xdKUuu4DbJ71KGbwRXfFg,"Convenient location with ample parking space! Definitely a plus when compared to Monta on Spring Mountain. :)

I went around lunch on opening day, so there was no wait and we were seated right away. The place is nice and small, like a lot of ramen places in town. You are greeted by everyone once you walk in, and to the right, you can see the workers making fresh noodles! Since this restaurant faces West, I'd hate to be making noodles with the sun blazing in my eyes.

We were asked what we wanted to drink shortly after sitting down (Got our usual water with lemon). The waiter had to check if they had lemon slices. xD I don't blame them, since it IS their opening day, and still pretty early on, so I'm guessing they are still trying to figure things out. They didn't have any :( But hopefully they will in the future.

We had a party of 4, and I had the original shoyu ramen (no spicy) with nitamago. Each both of ramen (minus the vege ramen) comes with chashu pork, fried garlic, kikurage black mushrooms, bamboo shoots, fresh green chives, ground pork, sesame oil, and shredded red pepper. The broth was fatty and flavorful; a perfect five stars. The fresh homemade ramen - that's what makes this review a 4 star. It's not that the ramen was bad, it's just not really to my liking. I'm more of a fan of the thick noodles from Monta, which has a completely different texture. Also, even after soaking the noodles in the broth for a while, it still tasted a bit bland. On the other hand, the chashu pork had a great fat to meat ratio, and they actually had a whole clove of fried garlic in my broth. Yum. =] Also, the nitamago was cooked to soft-boiled perfection. Gotta love that runny yolk! The black mushrooms, bamboo shoots, fresh green chives, ground pork, etc are as expected. No complaints there.

I also got to try the broth of the Miso ramen with Hot spicy (level three spicy of four). There was a kick to it, but it faded quickly and didn't linger like a lot of other spicy foods. So even if you can't handle spicy like me, you should be okay with a level one or two spicy.

I'll be back to try the other broths as well as the rice. Keep it up!",RoDHuFS54UO8uw8Xw9Wk3Q,1,1,4,ei-10e8JsLUBt9JZkW4dzw

They make their noodles fresh. I like thicker chewy noodles but theirs are not bad at all. I like how you can pick your spice level. I always get the miso ramen with egg at medium spice. Perfect for a cold day.

2345211,2017-09-07,0,5xdKUuu4DbJ71KGbwRXfFg,"Location: The place is located one block from Rhodes Ranch, in the same plaza with the EOS gym, right next to Cafe Rio. There are plenty of parking spaces in the back if you happen to come on a busy day. 

Decor: the restaurant is on the smaller size side. They have about 8 tables and bar. If you are in a hurry and don't have to sit at a large table,'I'd recommend to sit at the bar since you will have a better chance to sit on a busy day. All around is Japanese style ramen like in Tokyo. It's an open cooking space where you can see how they prep your meal. This is one of a good thing, you know they will be clean when someone is watching, haha. 
Simple artistic decor and oh, the bathroom is clean. 

Menu/ ingredients: once you walked into the restaurant, there is a noodle maker machine on side. All of their noodles are handmade at the location. With the exception of Tsukeme style ramen (soup on the side) which what I usually order since I believe those are ready to cook ones. It's probably due to different process required when it comes to yellow noodle. Tsukemen is more chewy compared to regular ramen noodle. I also ordered their house fried rice, very tasty and has pork belly in it! Yummm. Must try! 

Service: Their service is always good and fast. They always make sure the have enough employees to cover all tables. But I can see the space is a challenge especially when it's super busy and they are trying to bus table and then deliver soups in that small hallway. 

Price: a little higher compared to Monta in Chinatown. Portion is bigger though. And only mushroom, bamboo shoot, 2 slices of pork and green onion are included. Everything else are extras. 

RecommendAtion: Tsukemen is my favorite! Love hpw you can adjust your spicy level and add extra toppings. I would recommend to include some of the extras. Eggs should be included in the price since one bowl is already $9-10. 

Overall, I am satisfied and will be back. If they include more extra items in the price, then I will be back more often.",XU-JR0vGW1_O5GmNwZ0bfQ,1,0,5,ONCIRjtGH9H8y3asIcCGJg

Other choices are Tonkatsu Ramen (pork broth), Miso Ramen (pork & chicken broth) and Vege Ramen in vegetable broth/toppings. 

The toppings, ramen noodle and the reddish colored soup all tasted awesome. Full of flavor but not salty. The noodle is how I expected a homemade noddle would be. I would definitely come back and try the other toppings and soup types.

I love that they are open a little later than other restaurants in the area and honestly being down the street from me helps. If this place was 10 minutes further away would I have gone so often? Honestly no. The noodles and broth are above average but not amazing. I love spicy food, but ""fire"" varies each time I go. For example, I've had it where I would rate it a medium all the way to fire. I thought that it was just me, but another party asked the same thing one night. They were told that it depends on the peppers. All of the staff is very friendly. I love the concentrated menu, but not serving gyoza is odd to me. (Not that I'm a ramen expert, but it seems to be standard at most other places.)

My biggest concern right now is that they don't seem to balance to go orders and in house orders well. Today, I got there during a to go rush, so I waited 25 minutes for my soup. Most of the time it is around 10-15 minutes. My guest said that it may have been the time of day, but I watched 13 to go soups go in a row before ours was made.

This girl version of a bachelor, really enjoys her take-out food and this place tastes just as good when you're dining in as it does in a huge bowl being eaten on my couch. My only issue is time and time again we have a disconnect in ordering and some extra topping I added is typically missing. When I'm there they are really good about bringing it out to me quickly, but when I get home there is nothing sadder than adding all your fixings and you realize that your Nitamago (soft boiled egg) is missing. The eggs aren't the only things that are extra when you go there though... Yes, I am referring to myself as extra.

Extra (definition found on Urban Dictionary)

Doing the absolute damn most, for no reason.

My order in order:
1.) Broth
-Miso Ramen (pork & chicken broth)
2.) Spicy Level
-Medium, even though sometimes medium feels a bit more on the hot side
3.) Extra Toppings
-Nitamago (soft boil egg), for something soft in texture
-Bamboo Shoots, for something crunchy in texture
-Spinach, for something green
-Corn, because I love corn in everything
-Butter, because carbs

The real secret to amazing ramen is you MUST add the Black Garlic Oil, because my ramen can never have too much sodium. I'd get it on the side though, so you can add to your liking.",RE3rs-sETuqKtNGDcC8fqw,0,0,4,x4zZdu55i7-d-zl95pPUvQ

Let's be realistic here, a can of Coke does not cost $1.25. At Monta (same owner) it's only $1. It's .25 cents more but that .25 shows a lot. Very easy menu to me so I love that. Not too many options so you're not stuck for 20 minutes trying to pick what you want which is awesome because you turn over tables faster. They don't have gyoza. This is the first ramen place that doesn't have gyoza on the menu. I got the chashu bowl and asked for it with extra sauce. The server said okay and my man ordered the pork belly bowl with extra sauce. They came back without sauce and were so dry. The pork was dry and my chashu was really delicious. Just too try. Apparently they don't come with sauce. Then don't say okay? I understand that it's their second day but that's so obnoxious. Learn the menu before opening.

As for the food, I've tried the Tonkotsu and the Miso. Both were flavorful and in my opinion, was served with a good ratio of broth to noodles. The noodles are made fresh of which you have the opportunity to watch as they are being made while you wait to be seated. The meat portion is rather small and have to pay more if you would like to add extra toppings. This will bump up the base price of the ramen another $1.50 to $2.50 for each item you add on.

As someone who loves spicy food, I eat my ramen with the level fire all the time. If you can handle really spicy food then fire will be nothing to you. I also love how flavorful and fresh their ramen is. Every time it comes out, it's always super hot and fresh, never lukewarm or anything like that. 

Service is also very nice. The place can get busy but even then, the servers try their best to check up on you, refill your water, etc.

The only problem with this place is that you can not substitute what you take out from your ramen for more of something else. You can only add extra which will cost about an extra $2 for each topping. I don't like bean sprouts or ground beef in my ramen so I always sub it for an egg and more chashu since you only get one piece. My bowl ends up being around $14.

2956065,2017-12-07,3,5xdKUuu4DbJ71KGbwRXfFg,"I'd be pressed to say that the ramen here is even better than ramen you eat in Japan. Seriously!

Ramen KoBo is by the same makers of Monta Ramen and you can really see the similarities from the dinky dining area to the limited but extremely well executed options on the menu. Fancy seeing the noodles made in person? The kitchen area is open alongside an end which is divided by glass and you can see the chefs and cooks spinning up flour with their hands to make the noodles.

I love this place for two reasons: first reason. EDM all day, everyday. And I'm not just talking about the generic big room stuff. No, this place was blasting oldies but goodies like Tritonal's Now or Never and new tunes (as of 12/7) like Illenium, Borgeous and more. Whoever decided to play edm, GOOD edm here, kudos to you.

Ok for my second reason, the menu items like I mentioned is limited but it is very good. I had the miso ramen with extra pork and an order of the boiled eggs. But one little thing that made a WORLD of a difference for me here...you can adjust the spiciness here. If you're a spicy food lover like me, this is a game changer. Seriously, I never knew miso ramen tasted this good when you make it spicy (going for the hottest one next time).

Not only that, but the broth is not so fattening and you can clearly see how smooth it is once you are nearly done with your bowl. When all your noodles and veggies and things have been eaten away, your broth will either have fat bubbles floating around or it'll be clear. All clear here.

I ordered a mild miso ramen with butter.

The ramen in general was good. The broth was a bit salty and too rich for my liking. I would skip the butter next time. The chashu was soft. I wish they added more bamboo shoots and bean sprouts

There's room for improvement but this place is still new.

We were all so confused and annourf because we were all talking and getting interrupted by the SAME question. It's like they didn't believe us about only getting one can of coke.

We started with chicken steam buns, I could eat 10 of them they were so tasty! Perfect bun, crispy chicken light dressing.

For the ramen I opted for the vegetarian option while hubby went with pork and added ground chicken. Even at opposite ends of the spectrum these bowls were equally balanced, savory and most importantly everything was fresh. Next time I think I'll add black garlic.

Both my boyfriend and I experienced the same problem with our bowl of ramen. The biggest problem was the broth, the heart of ramen is the broth, it was more like miso soup, it definitely lacked a real broth taste. The broth contained very little meat and was not prepared properly. Our eggs were cold, our pork slices were cold, and the fact that they add ground pork (cheapest meat you could add) which makes the dish completely undesirable. There is a ramen joint not too far from Ramen KoBo that offers 2 slices of beef, 2 slices of pork, one huge ox tail, an egg, and two seaweed wraps for less than the price we paid for at KoBo. The straw that broke the camels back was paying $3 for both of us to enjoy a cold egg (smh). This should already be included in our ramen bowls. We both definitely do not plan on ever returning. We gave it a shot and it definitely did not meet our expectations.",HjVwzhQWoGv0tOSh0tWvWg,1,1,1,XMz3daJBPB733xrmvHxfXQ

This place is TINY but when I see tiny it means it's a smart business plan since they are using the space to the fullest. The place is simply decorated which is good when it's small. They can maybe fit about 25 people MAX!!

The service is always fast & quick. This place is probably not like the most romantic place, more of like a quick meal & out.

-PORK BELLY BOWL $5.95 - it's simple & plain & I love it. Thin slices of PORK just cooked & topped onto a bowl of rice w/ salt & pepper & sesame oil. Topped off w/ scallions
 
-SHOYU SPICY RAMEN $8.95 - there has to be a bunch of MSG in this soup base because I freaken can't stop craving the damn soup! I'm not much of a ramen person since I prefer to just make ramen at home for convenience but the soup here I just love.

-MINI MENTAIKO BOWL $3.95 - I love MENTAIKO w/ some warm rice & a whole bunch of scallions w/ thinly sliced nor I. There's also some sesame oil on the side for you to add for yourself.

-KIMCHI FRIED RICE $3.95 - I would say this is like most mild kimchi fried rice I have had yet.

All in all I love the soup & the mini bowls... nothing super exciting but it's convenient for a quick bite when you just want something simple. Plus I work close by.",x-8ZMKKNycT3782Kqf9loA,4,4,4,VePAZXFrPnirdqBGDsbR0A

3332808,2017-01-04,0,5xdKUuu4DbJ71KGbwRXfFg,"I returned to my quest to find the greatest ramen in Las Vegas this week. The specialty that I noticed at Ramen KoBo was the spice level. I love spicy so I naturally had to go fire for the level. I then went with my go to tonkatsu and added some spicy roe as I'd never seen that as a topping option. 

Price is the same as anywhere else in Vegas. I feel that the chefs have all just called each other up and set a price to $9 with additional topping prices varying. 

The soup itself was the spiciest broth I have ever had - fantastic. My eyes and nose were running which is what I hope for when ordering top spice level. The noodles weren't that great compared to other ramen spots and the chasu, though good, was portioned very small. The roe were quite a nice addition so I'm glad I added that in. It gave the dish a nice extra layer. This ramen also included some ground prom which I didn't notice at first but was good since it made me feel less ripped off meatwise by the lack of chasu. This ramen was smaller than most with less noodles as your typical Vegas ramen front. I actually like that better because it seems that most places waste the entire bowl on noodles and less on extras whereas KoBo puts more spirit into the variety of toppings. 

KoBo is the best spot in town for a spicy broth. It will fill you up but won't get you bloated. They have salmon roe which I liked but the noodles weren't the greatest. Overall it filled my ramen craving and would be my #1 destination if I'm looking to burn my stomach on tonkatsu ramen.",JaqcCU3nxReTW2cBLHounA,0,0,4,e3Lmh0M3WZqRhH7EQ72NoQ

The consistency of the ramen leaves much to be desired. I usually go with spicy but depending on the day the amount of spice will wildly fluctuate as will the amount of sliced pork you get. I really do love this place but it is a bit expensive for ramen. Other places will give you a few add-ons as part of the price of ramen but at Kobo you pay for anything extra. A bowl of ramen with 2-4 extras will run you $14-$16. If you order your food togo its usually done in 3-5 minutes depending on how busy they are.,LCvRa_NJNYFy-pdd_Fe6VQ,0,0,4,lgxK1AvbuV_2wNOe6Ns9ug

3) Mushrooms - Good texture. 

Now, this all sounds great to start but we are missing one vital component to ramen: THE BROTH. The broth had absolutely ZERO flavor. There was no salt on the table for me to add. As I started looking around I could see that everyone was adding everything they could to this broth. You need chili paste, garlic, soy sauce, etc. It is simply not worth it.

I arrived around 12:30 pm and it wasn't busy inside. There were only about 10 customers inside.  The interior was nice and I took a seat at their bar.  I like to see the cook's skill in preparing the ramen.  But to my surprise all the cooks and waiter were Hispanics with the exception of the hostess who was Asian female.  Stepping into a Japanese ramen joint, I expected that the cook(s) would be Japanese.  Maybe I am just too traditional.  So, even though I was skeptical, I was interested to see how authentic they could prepare the ramen bowl.  I only order their Tonkotsu ramen as I wasn't all that hungry.  I must say that I wasn't impressed.  For $8.95 + tax, you get one small piece of char siu in the bowl and no ajitsuku tamago (egg). The broth was nothing special as it was not rich and creamy. The presentation was just meh.  

I wasn't too happy that I could not pay with a credit card as I had to spend over $10 to use a credit card.  When I left, no one said one word to me.  No bye, no thank you!?! This place is so not typical of a Japanese ramen joint, where their staff are usually very polite and thankful.  My verdict, I definitely will not be going back to this place.

Despite craving ramen in the Vegas summer heat, this one here has a simple make your own ramen menu along with ready to order dishes. The flavors are more to my liking than I would say maybe Monta and Jinya combined. It's definitely a running up to Ramen Sora but it might just win for me since the miso with mild flavoring opened up the taste buds really well. You could add more if you want but it was the amount of flavors I needed. On the side I had chasu pork buns I believe which needed more flavor and chasu but the main idea of this review is definitely the ramen. I love the environment, it has the feel of what a ramen should should be and you can watch them make handmade noodles so you know the quality of the noodles are always fresh. It is a little far for me since I'm centered in the spring mountain area but the drive is worth it if you want a good ramen fix.",RE7r7p2KgS6HCc4opVZLCw,0,0,4,W1qFPv0H1t7aw9wsJ3WyvQ

3499907,2017-04-17,0,5xdKUuu4DbJ71KGbwRXfFg,"I recently discovered this place which is only 3 minutes away from me. Their pictures looks great, actual food not so much. Especially spicy level HOT is nothing but super greasy. My favorite ramen places are near China town, so I don't like driving there all the time. I ate at this place for 4 times. The last time I ate there, I could sense they aren't happy with me most probably because I only tip around 18% up to over 20%. If you guys eat at Japanese restaurants, you'll know they are very welcoming, and everyone greets when customers are leaving, unless it's not an open kitchen. In this case, they have open kitchen. They greet people leaving the restaurant. I was not greeted at all last time, when I was walking out, two people was at the counter, only a waiter behind me greeted me. I went there earlier tonight, I already walked up near the kitchen where all the tables are at, they aren't busy, restaurant was more than half vacant. No one greeted me and the chefs were all standing there watching me, one fat guy looked pissed off at me the entire time, one lady was emotionless, one guy kind of smiled a little bit when I did. I've been standing there like an idiot, looking back and forth at these guys made me felt very uncomfortable, especially the fat guy, like dude, seriously?! That's how a 7 years old girl would act like if you get her mad. It was too uncomfortable for the way they were judging me, so I left. On the check, it lists how much to tip for 15%, 18%, and 20%. If you give the option to tipping, and I have been tipping within the tipping range, why have to be an jerk? I never tipped under 15%, even if I have, it is an acceptable tip. I like to leave changes so my bill adds up to full dollar. Looks like to me, the servers gossips to everyone there. Most of the Japanese people I met or seen are extremely polite, however all the chefs at ramen kobo are not Japanese, not all servers are Japanese either. I've never had this kind of uncomfortable experience in my life. I wonder if any customers have watched their reactions, WOW.... I would feel embarrassed for them. All the other Japanese restaurants I go to, the service are always consistent and super friendly. I was surprised with these people. I will never ever go there again. BTW, one of their server's breath is so disgusting! When he's standing next to me, I could smell his breath!
I read a three star review few comments below me, looks like this place's really got real shitty people, they are extremely rude. It's very uncommon in Japanese restaurants, it's jaw dropping for me. Very shitty place, most likely cheaper labor. What's your most expensive item? $10? LOL ramen kobo, you guys win on every level.",Br6lUvq5B9cF7MqPFnVQlw,0,0,1,iILRh-1BGNQX8yMutDqT3A

We decided to order to go and the process was really simple submitting the order on the iPad they have at the counter and took about 20 minutes for us to receive our food due to how busy they were. Everything was packaged very well.

Be careful with how hot you go. I warned my Grandma to get medium instead of hot just to be safe but she insisted and even though she really enjoyed it, it was a little too spicy for her. I was super excited to try this place because of the good reviews and with how crowded it was made me think I was going to love it.

Came here on Wednesday at around 11:45 am, right after they opened. There were already about 10 people eating (wow!).
I was exited to try their gravy like thick creamy Tonkotsu broth ramen. I ordered it mild. With extra chicken chashu(char siu), green onion and seaweed paper.
When it came out, I saw red spicy oil floating in my soup. I specifically told the waitress I wanted it mild... so I told her I ordered it mild. She tells me ""Oh, we have spicy oil right next to our soup pot, so we usually put a little in. I can bring you plain broth on the side so you can put it in your bowl."" WTH!! If I was sensitive to spicy, I would've sent it back. (Luckily I was a spicy food lover)
Tip... If you are sensitive to spicy food, tell them you want it ""plain"" instead of ""mild"". Their mild is like spice level 3 out of 10. 
Usually Tonkotsu ramen comes with straight al dente noodles in decent ramen shops but theirs come with freshly made non straight noodles. I could tell their noodles were very fresh. I enjoyed it. 
Though the soup was a little spicy, it was tasty and flavorful. I was expecting the soup to be much thicker but they probably over diluted my soup with hot water.  For some reason, my chicken chachu was ice cold like they just took it out from the fridge. I don't know if it was supposed to be cold?? but would've been better if it was warm or hot. 
Location is convenient right off 215 but if I want Tonkotsu ramen, I would go to Monta.

It was pretty busy when I came here but the wait was surprisingly short.

I ordered the medium spicy miso ramen (should have gotten hot/fire). I didn't add any other toppings because I thought they were on the pricey side. Most of them are $1+. I thought the broth and the stuff it came with is comparable to the spicy ramen from Ramen Sora (ground meat, bamboo, etc). The broth is super thick and heavy, but delicious.

The staff was really friendly but once they brought out our check, I felt really rushed.

Was a little surprised that they didn't have any appetizers on their menu. Usually Gyoza is a staple at ramen restaurants even in Japan. It's always nice to munch on Gyoza while you wait for your ramen. Luckily, the wait for ramen was really short. The ramen came out quickly and piping hot. I ordered the Tonkotsu ramen with soft boiled egg. The broth in itself was very flavorful though a little too thick in consistency for my liking. They only give one piece of chashu which was a little odd because most ramen restaurants give you a couple slices at least. The noodles were very good. They weren't too soft nor too hard. Love that they make them fresh in house. I also ordered a side of kimchi and it's the kind of Japanese style kimchi that I love so I gobbled that all up. They put on their menu that they include bamboo shoots in their ramen but they're very thinly sliced and sparse. I usually like the thick slices bamboo shoots in my ramen. 

Overall, Ramen Kobo wasn't bad. The service was very good and it's a good place to grab a quick bite to eat. Was the ramen my favorite? No, but I will bring my mom in when she comes to town to give it a try and see what she thinks.

I got the miso ramen. The broth was very flavorful and full bodied, the noodles were perfectly chewy and al dente, and all the toppings were delicious. One thing that I missed though was a lack of vegetables and more toppings. You can add extra toppings, but they were a little pricey and I expected a little more to come with my bowl, especially for the price. 

I ended up getting the original spice level because I can't take spicy food, but my friends got medium-hot level and they were all suffering greatly.

I was happy there was another ramen shop in our area of town, and couldnt wait for this place to open when I saw it was coming a few months back. When I called in I had to repeat myself about 4 times to the person taking the order. I understood though, as it was around the 6pm dinner rush. When I got there to pick up the food, there was no parking, so I had to drive around 3 times to actually get a spot. When I walked in there was no one at the hostess stand, except for a lady placing an order on an ipad. A sever came over and asked me "" If I needed anything?"", and I said yes, Im here to pick up an order. She walked away towards the kitchen for what I thought was my food, Even though there were 2 bags of orders on the counter directly behind her. Instead of looking for my food, she went to grab orders for people that were sat down. Someone came out of the back to the hostess stand about 2-3 minutes later and asked me what I needed... Again. I tell her, the first server came back and started to try and help me but ended up giving my food to another customer that walked in. Then she took it back and gave it to me and I paid.. The guy got upset.. even though I was there first.. and called me an a-hole as I walked out. To summarize, they are disorganized. 

The food was not what I had expected. I ordered the tonkotsu Spice level 4.. broth was like salted creamy water. The chashu I ordered was almost all fat, and you have to pay extra for sprouts and egg. My wife and son ordered the shoyu ramen, they were not impressed. We also got a small order of the fried rice that everyone has reviewed so much, and spoke so highly about... It had a distinct fishy taste to it. My son is sort of a 4 year old ramen aficionado. The kid loves it and is very vocal about what he likes and doesnt like about it. I have to go with his instincts and agree this is not some place I would recommend. Maybe if we all ordered something different, or we ate there it might be better. After the first time I dont know if I care to try that out.",qVj7JaSwDgDBkDyxhwBTBQ,1,0,1,Z_6Y77qumU-l2By5j0Qa7A

The restaurant is a bit small so make sure you don't come during peak hours. There wasn't a wait when we got there right when it opened at 5 pm, but when we left there were people outside patiently waiting for their table. The food here was delicious, which is what I expected since they're part of the Monta Ramen group! I would definitely come back for the Ramen. 

FOOD: We had the Tonkatsu Ramen, which was phenomenal! The noodles were perfect. The soup was tasty and not too salty. I picked a medium spice level, so make The Chashu Pork was soft, tender and fatty. 

We also got the Kim Chi fried rice that was also yummy. I read other reviews saying it was a must-try, but I wouldn't consider this the highlight of the restaurant. I believe this place deserves a bravo for their Ramen! 

PRICE: Everything was less than $10. The bill for three of us was $40. It's a great value for delicious food. 

SERVICE: The service was great. Everyone was efficient and fast! When we asked the server for her opinion of the food, she recommended yummy dishes and was honest about the items she didn't recommend. The food arrived within a timely manner as well. 

Overall, it was a great experience and I rate this place 4 out of 5 stars. I would come back here to try the other ramen soups!

4006057,2016-06-11,13,5xdKUuu4DbJ71KGbwRXfFg,"Ramen KoBo (Translated to Ramen Factory) is a new ramen shop that recently opened in the Southwest of Vegas near Ikea. Ramen Kobo being owned by Mon Restaurant Group, I had expected a higher quality considering their other successful shops like Monta and Monzo.

Ramen Kobo is a small shop with mainly bar seating to overlook their open kitchen, then 5-6 tables along the wall. Servers were extremely attentive but there was one cook in particular who looked pissed off and didn't want to be there. I would look up and see him giving me an ice-cold glare and I had noticed he was eavesdropping to our conversation the entire time which I did not feel comfortable. My personal suggestion is to avoid their bar seating. 

I got to try their tonkotsu ramen and veggie ramen. Both were subpar in my opinion. Ramen were on the al dente side. 

Tonkotsu: Extremely light, flavorless broth. If you took a sip of their broth blindfolded, you might guess that their broth is hot water with salt. Chashu was just one paper-thin slice of fat with no meat on it. Bean sprouts were under-cooked and made me feel icky. 2/5

Veggie: Broth was still bland but better than tonkotsu. Two slices of fried tofu to substitute the chashu but these tofu will make you feel like you are biting into a dish washing sponge. I would still recommend veggie ramen over tonkotsu. 2.5/5

Overall a very disappointing experience. They just opened so I'm sure they are still working out their kinks but I don't see myself coming back here again.",mEzc6LeTNiQgIVsq3poMbg,17,9,2,Ho4jeHc-aLv5KCP8gmZNHA

The ramen was good. It was a little thin and light for me. I like heavy milky ramen but that's a personal preference. I did do spicy with the ramen and it made it taste like a Coconut curry soup dish that is Thai and Laotian. The pork belly was okay and the broth itself was good.

The appetizers they offer are good to me though. My assumption with KoBo is that they are greeted towards an eat and leave type of establishment. They have a simple menu with a handful of appetizers and you just order, eat, and leave.

I give them kudos for staying open late for late diners. If I'm in the area I'll stop in for a ramen craving, but not driving across town. Solid place.",pZ6P_1V-bTSoYG1fg1TXzw,0,0,3,b3ZtH2V-vk-4gZCOJZkiLw

4122639,2017-10-30,0,5xdKUuu4DbJ71KGbwRXfFg,"Being a sister shop to Monta Ramen, I honestly came here with low expectations the first time I visited. Boy, was I so glad to be wrong!

Location: This is located in the southwest part of town next to Cafe Rio. When entering, you are able to see workers making fresh batches of noodles. However, the shop is very small. Aside from around 10 seats at the bar, there are only around 5 other tables in the rest of the shop. It is very tight with not much room to move around. They only seat full parties so be wary if you are bringing a big group. It will take a while to finally be seated. There is almost always a wait during peak hours, but I have never waited more than 20 minutes for a party of 2-3 because of how fast everything is.

Menu: The menu is short and sweet. You just choose your broth, spice level, and extra toppings you may want to add. All bowls of ramen come with Chashu pork, Kikurage black mushrooms, bamboo shoots, green chives, ground pork, sesame oil, and shredded red pepper. There are also other dishes to eat like the pork belly bowl and kimchi fried rice.

Food: Be careful about the spice! The mild spice already has some kick to it, so be wary of the spice level you choose. Broth is rich and has a lot of flavor, but is not nauseatingly fatty. The noodles are very thick and capture the taste of the broth very well. There is also a decent amount of ground pork and a huge slab of chashu. There is enough where you have some with almost every bite, but does not overpower the dish itself. The portions are very big for a price of around $10 without any add-ins. Thankfully, adding additional ingredients are for a reasonable price & I always leave the shop feeling very satisfied and full. I've been dying to try their non-ramen dishes, but I always end up opting for ramen last minute. Hopefully soon, I could break this curse and finally give them a try!

Service: Workers are very nice, prompt and accommodating. Food comes out fast and I don't think they have ever gotten my order wrong from the many times I've visited. I never felt rushed or pressured to leave, though they do a great job at ensuring wait times are not horrendous.

The quality of the ramen and the genuinely kind workers are what convince me to frequently make the 30 minute drive from where I live to eat at Ramen Kobo.

This isn't really a long sit-down spot, more of an on-the-go lunch spot or somewhere to stop for a quick dinner. They serve canned teas, sodas, as well as draft and I believe bottled beer.

After trying it though, I would say don't waste your time.  The ramen is decent, but it is nowhere near the level of quality I expect from the Monta family.
The worst offense is the broth.  Whether it's tonkotsu, shoyu, or miso, they all have little floating bits of pork/chicken fat swimming in the bowl that are nauseating to say the least.  At Monta, you can tell they take the time to prepare the broth by boiling the bone marrow, which results in a creamy and consistent texture and flavor.  I feel like Ramen Kobo is simply cutting corners by adding extra fat to an otherwise unexceptional broth.
I give it two stars because the noodles and toppings were all great, but the broth ruined it for me and my girlfriend.

I've been to many ramen joints all of town who claim that they have spicy noodles, some even offer you a scale. But the highest portion of the scale is never actually spicy. I don't even have the highest spice tolerance, but most places just don't it. The next time I come here, I'll probably just order it hot. Unless I'm hungover and miserable of course because fire at this place would be the perfect cure.

The noodles were pretty damn awesome. They make them in house, and you can even watch them make them in a machine that's windowed off at the front. Sadly, our set of noodles in our ramen were overlooked, but the batch of extra noodles were al dente and had a great spongy quality. I'm going to give them the benefit of the doubt on the original set. Hopefully, it was a fluke.

The broth was fantastic. Along with the aforementioned spice, it was packed with flavor and all around excellent.

My partner even had the vegetable broth, and I usually dislike those greatly. Jinya has been the only place in town with decent vegetable broth. However, this wasn't just decent. It was actually excellent. I would not mind eating it at all.

One small gripe, besides the first batch of over cooked noodles, the Asahi mugs are tiny. They're worth the price, but they just feel tiny like I'm not actually getting a full beer. The ounces might be there, but they seem and feel small.

I had the Miso Ramen, medium heat level with extra chashu pork and added corn and green onion. It was so good.

It's a little disappointing that they don't have gyoza as an option. I ate the tonkotsu ramen medium spicy. The first time I went it was almost too spicy to finish, but the other times was just enough spice. The broth has good flavor, not too light, but almost creamy. You have to add things that come already at other places, like the egg, and it only comes with one small piece of chashu pork. The noodles are made in house, and they are probably the best thing about this place. I don't recommend taking it Togo though, it doesn't hold up as well as you'd think.

One of the unique quirks about this place is that you can see the ramen noodles being made right in front of you in the waiting area. Love that set up!

Yep, the ramen here is on point. I haven't had anything but ramen so I can't comment on the rest of the menu but I do enjoy all the ramen here. My favorite is the tonkotsu. Unlike some other ramen places, the broth is flavorful yet not too strong or heavy in the sodium taste. 

Service has been great from my experiences. The restaurant is pretty small so don't feel odd if you sit close to the table next to you - it may happen especially when the place gets busy. They have a bar area available along with some tables.

One thing I do dislike about this place: add-ons prices. Most other ramen places I've been to include an egg free of charge. Here it is $1 or something. It's also $1 to add seaweed they provide one piece.

4621854,2018-05-28,0,5xdKUuu4DbJ71KGbwRXfFg,"Introducing a brand new west side ramen house are the creators of Monta Ramen. Monta being the last review I wrote I was a bit excited, sort of, to see if this would be any different. To my satisfaction it truly was a delightful experience.
It's in a plaza off of Durango not very far from the brand new Ikea store that was built. True to form , it was busy with people waiting, and a list for you to put your name on, but that's pretty standard in every Ramen House; at least any worth dining at.
 An Original side note from anywhere else; they are also a noodle-making factory. As you wait in the front when you sign in, you can look through the glass and watch the gentleman/his machine and lots of fresh noodles.
The restaurant was very clean, with everything open on display, so you'd be able to tell exactly how organized and clean they really are. Even the bathrooms, that's right,  it gets five stars across the board.
As always I ordered a medium Spicy Miso Ramen with nothing extra so I could give you a review on exactly how it tasted as it came. All I can tell you in one word is DELICIOUS!!!! I enjoyed the broth much more than I did before and the fusion of flavors was very palatable.
Just like Monta I love their Kimchi Fried Rice , but it was much milder than I expected.  
My boyfriend and I shared the pork bowl which is always a favorite for us. Kobo's pork belly was lighter is color, just like if you were to prepare it at home. Where as what I'm used to, it is darker brown like a barbecue type pork, regardless it was very very good.
Ramen Kobo is definitely not bland in flavor, as all of their spices mesh into a delightful symphony in your mouth. Begging you to sing another song. It's a very Quaint restaurant, though I've never been to a large one. Size didn't take away from their character, as all of their friendly staff, made it so pleasant to dine there. I truly enjoyed the food and they experience and I would definitely rate it higher than Monta Ramen. 
I vote five stars for Ramen Kobo and thank them for such a wonderful dining experience. It's my pleasure to recommend Kobo's to anyone on the west side and even if you're not, you won't be disappointed....",U_5vWkiifPrb05Z3XIWeEA,0,0,4,XgEDesKwApK6XbJXULv3XA

4661965,2016-06-26,0,5xdKUuu4DbJ71KGbwRXfFg,"I moved out to Vegas a few months ago and have been trying different ramen restaurants. Ramen KoBo is by far the tastiest one I've been to. 

FOOD: 
Any place that makes their own noodles fresh in the restaurant is already ahead of the game but the broth is what actually matters. I ordered the spicy tonkatsu ramen which comes with one slice of cha shu, ground pork, mushrooms, bamboo shoots, and bean sprouts. For an extra $1.50, I added an egg, which still blows my mind that ramen places will charge extra for that (minus 1 start for that). I'm used to the egg being included. Anyway, for spicy lovers who like the kick of chili but still want their taste buds, medium is perfect. Not only did I eat all the noodles, but also drank all the broth. 

QUALITY:
You can't beat homemade noodles. And the broth was exactly what it needed to be. I can see how some people might complain about the saltiness but flavor of the broth is still delicious. 

PRICE:
It's about $9 for a bowl of ramen and extra ingredients range from $1.50 to $3.00. They also have sides for about $5-6, and beer within the $2 range (pretty affordable)!

CUSTOMER SERVICE: 
Friendly staff. Two girls came to check on me periodically and refilled my water. 

ENVIRONMENT:
This place is somewhat tiny so I can see it getting packed during dinner hours. There is a ramen bar and dining table area.

Since I'm currently doing this whole plant-based lifestyle, I opted for the vegetarian bowl with vegetable broth and added black mushroom ($1) and mustard greens ($1.50). Seems a little excessive to charge $1.50 for 8 leaves of greens, but whatever, it was my choice.

My bowl came out and the first thing I noticed is that it was very oily broth. Again, I've never been to a ramen place so I have no idea if that's normal or not...but I wasn't stoked about it. The dish was delicious, I ordered level 3/4 for spiciness and that was perfect for me. The noodles were excellent, the flavors were fantastic, but I wish it had been less oily. I went from feeling healthy about my choice to feeling like I need to do some extra cardio this afternoon. 

One other note - the vegetable bowl was the only option for vegetarians/vegans. All the rice dishes have meat and/or egg in them. This isn't a huge deal because the main dishes are the ramen, but just a heads up if you are a plant-based eater.",ABrS2sgtZA1hSH3YTmNFPA,1,1,4,tUOD_OVDx0wj9Al2wYo6Kw

When Omoide opened, they lived up to the hype. After all, it was one of the first ramen spots to open in Southwest. And so when word came on the street that Monta (who made it on Travel Channel) decided to expand its location, it was over. My life was complete.

And how disappointed I was.
Came here twice, about 3 weeks apart which was enough to say that I would not be coming back. Actually, should not have even come the second time. 
On a non-busy weekday, I stood by the seating area for 10 minutes. Tables and bar area non filled. Host/Server did not actually even acknowledge me and had her head working on some check by the computer. It was not until 2 guys walked in that she looked up and saw us and thought we were together as one party. 

I ordered the Tonkotsu Shoyu Ramen. This time, I thought, I would be smart and just order extra Chashu since the first time there was only one fatty piece. Kobo is smart. Since they want you to pay for additional toppings, my logic was that if I paid for extra chashu- perhaps there would be more chance of better chashu. I paid $2.50 for 4 pieces of fat, essentially.

How is it that the SAME ramen restaurant can have two completely different chashus? Did not particularly favor the tiny portion of ground beef inside either.  Given, the noodles are made freshly in-house. Other than that, the ramen is terrible. 

I will make that drive to Jinya or Monta Ramen on the other side of town.

4744390,2016-10-31,4,5xdKUuu4DbJ71KGbwRXfFg,"Probably more of a 3.5 star rating, I'm a fan of Kobo's noodles and broths, but the sometimes cold (and stingy) chashu and nitamago can really dampen the experience.

My understanding is that Ramen Kobo is somehow affiliated with Monta Ramen, being opened by the same team of people.  Although Monta was one of the original ramen spots in Vegas, I stopped going because I wasn't a fan of their thin noodles or their super salty broths.  Both of those things are fixed for me at Ramen Kobo, where you can see them make their thick, chewy noodles and add in some spice to your tonkotsu, shoyu, miso, or vege broths.  My favorite has been the miso ramen with mild spicyness, which seems to prove that I'm a big wuss when it comes to spice...anything higher than mild and I'm quite sure I won't be enjoying my ramen.

The few things that I'm not a fan of are sort of big things when it comes to a good bowl of ramen.  By default, a bowl only comes with one slice of chashu.  You can add more for $2.50, but then that turns your $8.95 bowl of ramen into an $11.45 bowl of ramen.  Also by default, your bowl does not come with any egg, but you can add one nitamago for $1.50, turning your already $11.45 bowl of ramen into a $12.95 bowl of ramen.  These things might seem nitpicky because I'm choosing to add these ingredients, but other shops in town offer these things for $7-$10 by default, no need to add them.  There have also been several times where the added chashu and egg are cold, as if they came straight from the refrigerator and were tossed on top of my ramen right before being served; no bueno.

Overall an upgrade from the original Monta Ramen, as well as a decent ramen spot in a part of town that didn't have any ramen spots before.",lsZlV02ZdqEzR-qILdT7Cw,9,6,3,BJ2YE4E8TDjJEfAKQPOp0g

The restaurant is fairly small, so don't bring giant groups to this place or else you'll have to wait awhile. Also, just a note: they only seat full parties and the waiting area is always pretty cramped. But my wait was actually fairly quick, considering we had a party of 8. Our waiter was friendly; he was also efficient as he got our waters right away and he took our orders without hesitation. 

I ended up getting a mild Miso Ramen. I'll let you know right now, this was not mild. I'm usually good with spice/spices, but this place was a little too much for me. I would recommend choosing a spiciness level one below you think if you're like me and THINK you can handle spiciness. Even though the ramen was a bit too spicy, I could still taste the depth and flavor of the ramen. It was salty, smooth, and everything I could ask for in a ramen broth. 

The noodles were the best part of the dish though. Handmade right in the restaurant, the noodles were long and cooked to perfection. Other places tend to overcook the noodles, making them limp and soggy, but not this place. Since they were cut bigger than usual, they had a good bite to it, and they absorbed the flavors of the broth very well. 

The preset combination disappointed me though. It had the typical ingredients: chashu pork, fried garlic, black mushrooms, chives, ground pork, bamboo shoots, sesame oil, and shredded red pepper. But my problem was that it wasn't enough. And if you want to add extra ingredients, go for it! But expect to pay upwards of $15 to $20 for your ramen. That's a little steep for ramen if you ask me.

Overall, this place is great. From the fresh handmade noodles to the flavorful broth, Ramen Kobo knows ramen and knows it well. Just be warned that the ramen is SPICY and the extra ingredients will definitely rack up your bill!",jVmVkhZ8NX0eGk5DhSeNUA,6,2,4,7dmWaFIUlADNWKtYAUJGNg

I decided to take my family here since they love ramen and this place was really good.
Walked in and got seated within 5 minutes. 
We all ordered the same thing the tonkatsu ramen.
When it came mine had no pork in it. I kindly asked the waiter named Rachel and she then proceeded to the kitchen. She then told her other coworker which he rolled his eyes. Hey not my mistake it was theirs. She brings it and I was kind of surprised because it was only a single thin slice. I guess I'm use to other ramen places where they put 2. My sister made a remark "" oh so small"". The waitress over heard and came to our table saying 
"" only comes with 1 piece"" weird because she was eavesdropping.
I also forgot to tell them no veggies in mine or my sister's. But that was my mistake. No problem so I picked them out. The same waitress proceeded to our table once again and said "" next time order no veggies so you're not picking everything out"" in a very rude manner. 
Is she out of her mind? Talking to a customer like that. I work in customer and food. I wouldn't dare talk like that. We were all pretty taken back by her rude comments. Her and her coworker would not stop dogging our table and talking about us.
Clearly In a different language (Chinese) 
The whole time my family felt uncomfortable. Not to mention they never checked up on us once.  She was also arguing with the chefs in the kitchen. Not only could we hear her but other customers turned their attention to them.

1.  They have a vegan ramen that the daughter states is out of this world.  I also tasted it and the broth was fantastic. I find it hard to get a really good broth for a vegan or vegetarian style ramen, however, this was excellent.

2.  Besides the vegan choice, we had a Shoyu Ramen and a tonkatsu ramen.  I had extra mustard greens with my Shoyu Ramen and also had it original.

3.  The noodles were excellent and homemade and fresh.  The broth, was very delicate with bits of oil floating from the bone broth and from the chashu pork that was in the ramen.  The pork was very tender and fall apart moist.  Loved it.  The noodles themselves were firm and had a great texture.  Perfect amount of vegetables to round out this tasty ramen.

I will be back to try more spicier versions of their dishes.  I wanted to be able to taste the broth without be hidden by the spices.

Down to the food...I ordered the chicken broth ramen, mild with an extra egg. The broth is so delicious! I never had ramen like this! Everything about the bowl was heavenly. From the daily made scratch noodles, the meat, the bamboo shoots, just everything together gave the soup the perfect bite and flavor. I never cleaned my bowl like that, not even when I eat pho!

The place is small and thin, with the small bar counter up against the kitchen like a ramen house should be. Best ramen houses are holes in the wall. This is just a nicely interior decorated hole in the wall. Greeted at the door by multiple people. Served our drinks and waited on very quickly. It is close to closing and not packed, so I'd hope for that. But it's never guaranteed. Everybody was very nice. I started typing this review after we put in our order, and we just got the order. Fast. Ordered tonkatsu ramen with egg, medium heat. Let's see how it tastes... 
Delicious. Broth is nice and thick, slightly fatty--like it should be. Pork melts in your mouth. Noodles--since they're freshly made here, they're springy and delicious. Egg is done perfectly. Everything about it is great. They use garlic chives, and didn't skimp with just green onion. The medium is quite spicy. And my husband and I both love spicy. So for the person who had mild and felt it wasn't spicy, there must be a large jump between mild and medium. But that's normal for most Asian cuisine. Portion is great. 
Rachel and Maru came around multiple times to give us more of our drinks, and make sure we were happy.
Highly recommend this place. First great ramen place outside of Chinatown. And it's near my house!!! Score!!!!",FF7C0VL0O2uueB16aY2sSA,2,3,5,EX3HNYaSeFA_R8nX1WYV6Q

""You said, when it's hot outside, you need to eat hot, spicy food so you sweat and..."" I trail off poorly holding back smug laughter.

Ramen KoBo, the newest offshoot of Monta Ramen.  Same great broths, same great noodles, same great toppings.  The  key difference, spicing up your ramen is encouraged.  Oh and noodles are made by machine, on site.  It has no bearing on the quality of the finished product.

Note:  this location is small owing to the walled off ""fish bowl"" where you can watch ramen being made.  Expect a wait.

Ordering is simple: choose a broth, pick a spice level, add extra toppings (bowls already have a single piece of chashu, seasoned mushrooms, bamboo shoots, and chives).

As with all Monta's, solid broths.  The tonkotsu stands out for their excellent extraction of in your pork flavor balanced with dashi and garlic, finishing with umame notes.  Gelatinous and palate coating.  Seriously, leave this alone.  The miso on the other hand is perfect for spicing up.  All broths contain MSG.  

Heat is achieved through chili oil and ground chilies.  The spice, even at fire, doesn't drown but compliments the flavor of the broth by adding a chili sweetness and aroma.  Thai food lovers, fire = level three of five.
 
As already mentioned, solid noodles, cooked toothsome (unless you specify otherwise).  Tender and flavorful chashu with minimal fat.

Though pricier than Monta, a basic bowl is $9, with added chashu and nitamago (soft boiled seasoned egg), $13.  Still a good value.",oeAhRa8yFa9jtrhaHnOyxQ,24,24,4,TadJVQrxAcDUBZgN1KJkSg

We are so used to Ramen houses being so salty, I specifically requested less salt and was happy to find they accommodated! 

The broth was creamy, but not too thick and was delish. I ordered one non spicy for the kids and they shared a bowl (being 5 and 8) and it was perfect.

The noodles are made fresh in house and that was the next best part. They were chewy and had great texture.

The menu is pretty similar to Monta except for optional levels of spiciness, 1 piece of pork Chasu instead of 2 but we get ground pork as the other protein instead, comes with bean sprouts, and a higher price tag. 

I went there the second day it opened and ordered my go-to ramen, the Tonkatsu Ramen, original level of spiciness, and I added an egg with an additional charge. The ramen turned out bland so I was disappointed and the egg was just like a tasteless hard-boiled egg. The soup base had pieces of the Tonkatsu oil-like ingredients floating around --- it looked it they did not boiled the broth enough for the ingredients to blend in. 

However, I gave this place another try the week after. I ordered a Shoyu Ramen with no options added as well as the Kimchi Fried Rice. The Kimchi Fried Rice is just as good as the one in Monta and the Shoyo Ramen was delicious! I don't know if it's because they heard feedback from customers about the broth being too bland and fixed it or it's simply because it's a different ramen but it was very well done. 

This is not the end of the review --- the third week, I did try the Miso Ramen and thought it didn't taste bland but it wasn't groundbreaking neither. I would go to this place just for the Shoyo Ramen and the fried rice.",95xLmZcOEUl1VWp_ERmTFA,0,0,4,3Ru7xbBGBCfSxk0hsjRzMw

There are five levels of spices: original, mild, medium, hot, and fire. I'm a bit of a wimp when it comes to spices so medium was too hot for me the first time; however, mild has always been just right. 

I don't eat red meat so it is always a struggle finding a ramen place that offers poultry or vegetable based broth; however, Ramen KoBo offers both! In addition, I like to add the extra topping of ground chicken with nori (roasted seaweed) with a seasoned egg.

The place is newer and more modern looking than what I'm used to at Monta and there was even a noodle flattening and cutting machine in operation.  Kinda cool!  Like a field eating trip all in one!  

In taking to the waiter, the place is a totally different ramen style than Monta.  Not sure why he was emphasizing it is so different but it was tasty.  Had the ""standard"" and ""mild"" tonkotsu pork broth.  Really rich flavor but there is a difference between the standard and ""mild-medium-hot-fiery"".  For one, the taste is not just spicier but the flavor is different too.  Also the broth is a red color not the dark eggshell color.  

I liked them both and the fried rice is the same goodness.  Kind of a lot of starch for one sitting but hard to pick which bite to take next!

The other thing that was pretty cool was their electronic menu at the front counter.  Cool gadget and would be cooler if you could place your orders that way too.  Mostly locals here and prices were reasonable.

They add ground beef, green onion, and a clove of garlic in their soups which the other locations do not do, I think it is a nice touch.

I went twice since they opened first time I got the Miso ramen original, and the second time I got the Shoyu ramen mild.

I really have no complaints about this place and on top of that, they have chicken here so I am not stuck with pork (I don't eat pork). They have levels of spice to their broth starting from no spicy to FIRE. I stick with the ""medium"" level and that is already pretty spicy to me. From hearing other people order and hearing my friends order, a lot of people get ""mild"" spice so I would start with that level first. Their broth is so tasty and their noodles are good as well. They actually hand make their noodles so maybe that plays a role as to why it's so good haha. Their service is also good, the waiters are always so nice and on top of that it's quick. It's also not too expensive, it's probably around the same price as other ramen places so if you want good quality ramen, please try this place!",rYnHybeEX8U22M3waYztLg,1,1,5,wJWLGd7Lz7SX6gj_T_PQJw

It's been awhile since I've been to Monta, but the noodles here are fresh made and are definitely al dente when they arrive.  The noodles remind me of a compromise between the thin and wavy noodles at Monta.  Broth is similar to Monta tonkatsu broth and very thick and rich.  The pork seems the same, extremely fatty and tender.

5518156,2016-10-09,6,5xdKUuu4DbJ71KGbwRXfFg,"There's this plethora of happiness inside of me knowing that such a solid ramen shop is (somewhat) close to me. Well at least, closer than all the ones at Spring Mountain. 

Here lies Ramen KoBo, sister to Monta Ramen, and a small, petite, homemade ramen noodle shop. As others have already mentioned, their noodles are always made in fresh batches, so you don't have to worry about that funky, stiff chewiness you get at some ramen places when you know they don't serve their ingredients fresh. 

The ramen itself is solid. I personally like my miso with a lot of sodium, as it's already unhealthful in the first place. I think if that's what you are looking for, a heavy broth similar to that of Ramen Sora, then you will find that here. One thing in particular that I found unique was that they added ground pork to the ramen bowl. Never seen that before, but that's just me. 

I do believe that the toppings are more on the overpriced side. Every topping is a dollar or more, and I'm used to seeing it and 75 cents or less. I'd also be much more pleased with my time here if they had a larger appetizer menu to choose from. I usually like to start off with some takoyaki or gyoza, and it was a shame to see that they didn't have either of the two. Although, I did like their kimchi fried rice; it was very flavorful in comparison to what I get sometimes at Monta. 

I know that seating is very limited at this location. I'll be bold to suggest that seating should be even more limited. When you walk inside, you know that of course, the establishment is very small itself. However, it doesn't mean that one should cram as many tables inside as one possibly can. I would've enjoyed my meal much more, without having to hear every single word of the conversation next to me, and feeling as if the couples in my vicinity were breathing right beside my neck. I had to move to the bar area in order to feel relaxed once again. 

Albeit this place has its downsides, the ramen itself, I feel, is a good enough reason to come back here, especially when I'm too lazy to drive all the way to Chinatown.",9E_LCRdvbhUAEgXa8VpGYg,8,7,4,QzhIyrLOQ39E40CJWf3OuQ
5521100,2016-10-29,1,5xdKUuu4DbJ71KGbwRXfFg,"VISUAL AESTHETIC: 4/5
Location can be crucial for restaurants and in this case, Ramen KoBo is tucked away. Fortunately, It is well seen but the road to enter the shopping center it is located in, is in all honesty, awful due to the proximity being so close to the freeway; cars are running fast and the roads are large and difficult to cross.

The interior is very modern with wooden paneling and matching tables and chairs. The lights are chain hung and include a line of studio bulbs which keep the venue well lit but with a warm tone. The bar area can seat quite a few patrons and is spacious despite the small size of the restaurant itself. It's very pleasing to the eye, with the black framing very clean. The decor is classic to that of most Japanese restaurants, with banners hung above the bar area. 

FOOD: 4.8/5
The noodles here are fresh made, with a large glass window to see the process. There is a machine that essentially flattens the dough and slices it up into portions. Because of this, the noodles are chewy and have a great buoyant texture. 

The way the menu is situated makes it very easy to read and pick the type of broth you would like, how spicy, and any extra toppings that you would want with your ramen which includes adding a portion of noodles. 

I ordered the shoyu (chicken broth) which tends to be hotter. In the case of soup, it keeps the ramen at a nice temperature without cooking through the vegetables. The ramen comes with bamboo shoots, chaysu pork, ground meat, chili slices, and other typical vegetable ingredients. They were all fresh and still contained a light crunch which was pleasant. I also added a soft boiled egg. The extra toppings can cost anywhere from .50 to 2.50. 

I also ordered the chaise fried rice. Ramen KoBo generally has some of the best made chaysu I have come across in Las Vegas, very tender and not try at all. The marinade is delicious but not overpowering that it would ruin the quality taste of meat. The fried rice's presentation was a bit scattered, but tasted good with the chopped ingredients still intact enough to have a variety of texture with the rice.

SERVICE: 5/5
The service was excellent, with the waiters and waitresses attentive to our table. I overheard the servers actually helping out certain individuals when menu items were questioned as well. Overall, everyone was friendly, well adjusted to their surroundings in the case that the restaurant is small and can be hard to maneuver around in, and attentive to the customers.

OVERALL EXPERIENCE: 4.9/5
Honestly, I have been to this location before and was disappointed in how salty the broth was. However today the taste was perfect, not too salty or bland and I was very pleased with the overall taste, service, and of course, the cute Halloween decorations. Ramen restaurants have become abundant in Las Vegas, and with that, competitive advantage is important. This location is supposed to be a sister of Monta, and I was not fond of that location's ramen. However, KoBo has impressed me with today's service. I will definitely be back soon.",zn1klNeNLrk0XE1vF_l00A,5,2,5,42-tjwfX65ogL4M04pewtw

5529400,2016-07-28,75,5xdKUuu4DbJ71KGbwRXfFg,"Most Vegas residents aren't familiar with the Japanese chain known as Tenkaippin Ramen, but if you are, Ramen Kobo's tonkotsu broth is practically a dead ringer.  They totally nailed the unique, thick, gravy-like pork broth that made me feel I could've been at one.  There are a ton of people that love this, but I am not one of them.  Despite the noodles being decent and that one meager slice of pork chashu (don't bother with the chashu chicken) tasting good, this simply did not give me the ""kimochi"" I was looking for.    

For those that dislike the amount of sodium usually associated with Japanese ramen, both the tonkotsu and the light shoyu broth should please.  That 5000 mg aftertaste many experience often won't happen here.  I felt obligated to add spice, since it was something they push here, but it didn't improve much for me.  Order it on the side and do what your heart tells you.  Mine told me not to use it.  

It was strange that gyoza wasn't on the menu.  I asked and also overheard two of the neighboring tables ask as well.  Why not just give the people what they want?

In the end, it's better than Omoide, but not as good as Sora or Jinya.  One and done.

5556362,2017-12-08,1,5xdKUuu4DbJ71KGbwRXfFg,"I was SO excited to try their vegan ramen but sadly, it was kind of a disappointment. 

We came on Saturday right when they opened and we were surprised that people were already outside the door waiting in line and thought this place must have some tasty ramen! We were seated right away and liked the design of the place - there was a ramen bar and the tables are pretty close to one another so heads up that you'll be getting comfy with other parties next to you lol. 

The menu also include fried rice bowls and the various toppings you can add to your ramen. The vegan ramen sounded so promising, especially after all the great reviews but now I'm thinking maybe it's cause they just opened for the day that the broth didn't get to settle? I'm not sure but it was SO watered down, to the point that I honestly thought I was just eating ramen in hot water. I had to add more salt and some soy sauce and even hot sauce to try to make the meal more enjoyable, but nothing worked. Our friend ordered the chicken ramen and also wasn't satisfied; there was just something about our broths that made the experience an unsatisfying one. 

We did enjoy the small bowl of fried rice but believe me when I say, it was definitely small lol.

Similar to Monta, it's fairly small without a ton of seating (4-5 tables to sit families of 4, and bar seating), and I've only had to wait at most maybe 30 minutes. 

Friendly customer service. 4 different soup bases: shoyu (chicken), tonkotsu (pork), miso (chicken + pork), and a vegetarian bowl. They all come with a decent amount of toppings, and you can also ask for extra toppings. You can pick how spicy you want your broth: not spicy, mild, medium, and hot. As for their extra dishes, I've only had their Pork Belly Bowl so far, and it was amazing! Delicious, salty pork belly on top of garlic rice.

It's small & cozy and reminds me of a type of restaurant you would see in San Francisco. It offers an open kitchen layout and clean, contemporary feel with wood & metal material throughout. There is a small room upfront where the noodles are made. Unfortunately I have yet to experience this but hopefully one day soon. 
Now onto the good stuff...the food! Reminder: I was never a true fan of ramen until I came here. I have now dined in twice and take out once. 2/3 times I have tried something different; the basic shoyu and today consisted of the miso. Their spice level has a little more kick than what you may be use to. I recommend sticking with mild and kicking it up yourself with the chili oil & powder they have. I am not a fan of the ground meat that is standard in the ramen. It's definitely a consistency thing but so much better without it. The noodles are indescribable and cooked al dente and have yet to experience anything other. 

The only problem I have...they do not deliver nor on post mates or uber eats! But then again ramen should be enjoyed at the restaurant. It's not the same experience when at home.

5578269,2016-10-06,3,5xdKUuu4DbJ71KGbwRXfFg,"First time there today. I've been waiting for a ""perfect"" weather to pair with ramen so I waited for our long summer to be over. First impression was nice, clean and modern as this is a new joint but the smell was off. The smell was overwhelmingly stale and oily. My culinary ""red-flag"" went up right away from that point. Lunch was fairly busy but luckily we sat at the bar right away. Before I sat tho, I went to the bathroom to wash my hands. Both men and women bathroom had signs that said the bathroom is closed for some work or something. WHAT?! This is a brand new place practically. But I saw that the women's bathroom was open and no one was nearby so I quickly washed my hands (of course, with door opened with my foot propping it open. Didn't want to ""scare"" any female patrons there you know!) Anyway, the hallway floor was sticky which is a good sign that they don't have a good sanitary protocols. C'mon, they just opened the door like 30 mins before we were there. It shouldn't be that way. As I sat at the bar, the dirty hoods caught my eyes. Once again, this place being as new as it is, the hoods shouldn't be that dirty with oil and filth. Another sign...lack of proper sanitation and maintenance protocols. 

Next thing I noticed are the workers in the kitchen making the food doesn't seem to have much culinary training.I'm accustomed to and expect to see people behind the kitchen who knows about the food and have appreciation for the food they are making. I highly doubt any of the workers have any prior training in making ramen before they start working there. Their lack of professionalism and respect for the food they are making truly showed with the body language and filthy stuffs they were saying. Especially the heavy set guy was pretty vocal and non-stop talking fairly loud while making the noodle, I so wish he stopped talking to minimize spitting into the food. For that reason alone, I would not return to this place again since I felt the food isn't being made with proper sanitary standard. 

Our ramen took little longer than expected but not too bad. I ordered a medium miso and I thought it was quite spicy. My staffs agreed as one ordered hot (she normally order 8-9/10 at Thai restaurants) and the other ordered a medium miso too. Taste wise, I'd give 3 stars. The noodle, which they boast about making in-house with their own machine is nothing more than a show. Can we say Krispy Kreme??? It really didn't deliver anything extra. Portion is on the smaller size so I ordered a side of white rice. Sorry I ordered ""white"" rice, not stale ""yellow"" rice. Another let down!

The waitress was poorly trained or just don't know how to serve properly. I'd accept ""unfriendly"" but this older lady was on the ""rude"" side! 

Ramen is something I appreciate quite a bit. While being a rather simple dish, it's one of those things that's not only filling but emotionally ""hitting the spot"" type of food. Kobo is a prime example where a business person with no culinary training and no culinary appreciation for the food they deliver turns it into a ""factory"" to make money, not food! Their name is quite fitting...a FACTORY! Simply a place where they make things. No thanks kobo, I'll look for a place where they take pride in food they make, not just the $$$ they make!",U98mZaQAsHXym6FyhGCZdA,0,0,1,CqgFPLhbYK_j27uD9pfN6g

Which is a huge bonus because it's near my house, so I don't have to travel far for Ramen this fall. The base soup is layered with flavor.

It's quick it's delicious everything is fresh. Las Vegas has maybe into a Ramen lover.

Its this one server that everybody is complaining about who has the worst costumer service of all  the entire staff here. Shes loud and doesnt let you finish when ordering your food. Its like she will finish your order for you. What happen to listening to costumer 1st before you open your mouth. We love their ramen but we just have to deal with her everytime.

5889373,2018-05-30,0,5xdKUuu4DbJ71KGbwRXfFg,This is an update.  I was there with my girlfriend and this time i ordered the tonkatsu ramen with ground chicken spice level eight with extra chili oil and extra noodle.  She had the pork belly rice and kimchee fried rice and I was blown away.  We both agreed that jinya ramen has their ramen beat just by a little but I will say that it is still a five.  The ramen was nice and hot and with the extra ramen noodles I was still able to make a small bowl for her too.  Kimchee fried rice was almost on par as Komex kimchee fried rice but it was still really good.  The porkbelly bowl with rice was the best i have tasted in the valley.

5915252,2017-02-07,4,5xdKUuu4DbJ71KGbwRXfFg,"I was really excited when I saw this place open up! It's awesome and refreshing to see a place that makes noodles in house vs using the soulless mass produced noodles from country XXX.

I came in here one night about an hour before closing. The place was still banging and full of patrons. From the looks at the podium there was a mad wait list at one point. I was Flying solo I took a seat at the countertop. I actually enjoy sitting at the countertop as you can watch the ""magic"" happen. I was a little perturbed that the wait staff was more concerned about taking care of their closing tasks vs waiting on guests. I had to watch the wait staff team walk past me several times before I was able to get my order in. 

The noodle making stuff had been shut down for the day so that bummed me out.. I guess it's bad luck to make noddles in the dark. 

The ramen was a bit on the small side however proportionate for the price. I did feel that my original order was a little on this light side compared to my kaedama order. The first set of noodles were perfect. Just the right firmness and texture. The kaedama on the other hand was a bit overcooked and on the soggy side. 

The broth was nothing fancy decent but nothing to wow about. 

My visit here was a miss .. maybe it was the timing or maybe this is how it is here.. not sure.. the jury is still out.. 

Till then the choice is yours..",E_Ts8j758tpiAZknHR7k4g,4,1,3,q_VPpJPb54OfVDJaF18nYw
5915356,2017-07-14,0,5xdKUuu4DbJ71KGbwRXfFg,I highley highly recommend you try this place for your selves. You will be satisfied.  The ramen noodles are fresh and the brooth so flavorful.,X9VeCgccP2kbm3tkdKqx8g,0,0,5,tQOgYqowEQbuEg1U_yhpkw
5928885,2016-06-20,8,5xdKUuu4DbJ71KGbwRXfFg,"I have eaten a lot of ramen in my life, but this place was pretty horrible! We were excited to see that a ramen place was opening closer to home. When I read that this was created by the Monta team, I expected the same delicious food and had high expectations. Unfortunately, this was absolutely nothing like Monta.

The restaurant is super tiny and I felt uncomfortable being very close to the table next to us. I ordered the original Shoyu Ramen without any extra toppings. It's cool that they make their own noodles, but honestly there was nothing special about it. They were too thick for my liking and would definitely prefer the noodles that are served at Monta. The Shoyu broth was disgusting! There was no flavor at all and I honestly felt like I was eating noodles in a bowl of plain hot water. The one piece of Chasu was 100% fat and most of the ground pork sank to the bottom of the bowl, making it hard to eat. Just Eww. I hate to say this, but I think a $0.25 instant ramen from the grocery store would have been better than this!! They also screwed up on the spice levels for others at our table. My husband ordered mild, but he said it was pretty spicy. Our friend ordered hot, but it turned out to be on the mild side. 

I am giving two stars because the staff was attentive, refilled our drinks quickly and took empty plates away as needed. I understand that they are new and still getting their act together, but I will not be back. The drive to Chinatown is worth it for good tasting ramen!",FOoN3DJzDUnl4EAQaTJIGg,10,4,2,Xs3ePUOEtITfvBXeR9ynPQ
5942066,2018-04-27,0,5xdKUuu4DbJ71KGbwRXfFg,"Miso ramen medium spicy is real good better than nyc ramen places.

5947380,2017-03-06,3,5xdKUuu4DbJ71KGbwRXfFg,"Mhm! This place is definitely a great addition to the Monta family. We decided to check out this restaurant based off a recommendation and were happy we did! 

I ordered the Tonkotsu Ramen with medium spicy and a soft-boiled egg. The appetizer menu was fairly limited, but they did offer four different ramen broths, a huge variety of toppings ($$) and the standard pork belly and chasu bowls.

Advice: If you're a huge meat eater, order additional chasu. If you want an egg, get it. Need extra carbs? Get it! Your ramen bowl, even with the additional toppings, will still cost you less than a Bay Area ramen restaurant ;)

Pros:
- Spice! Mhm. If you're looking to add a kick to your ramen, this place delivers.
- Ground Pork was super flavorful.
- Noodles were chewy! 
- Clean restaurant

Cons:
- Service was slow for a non-busy time.
- Broth was a little too light for me. If I'm getting Tonkotsu, I sort of expect a super creamy and rich soup.
- Only one chasu slice offered, but maybe that was a good thing. It's delicious, but super fatty!

Overall, this place was decent and I'd come again. I still prefer Monta Chaya or Monta Ramen over this place. For about two people, we paid $25ish with tip and tax.",VFr6lODPXmakSm4BFebKww,4,3,4,-8cYaHdvy4E6FMCLB0guVQ
5954493,2016-12-30,2,5xdKUuu4DbJ71KGbwRXfFg,"If you love Monta then there's no way for you to not like Ramen Kobo. The place is small just like Monta so be prepared to wait. We only had to wait for 15 minutes which was not too bad. The service is little to none. They seat and take your order and they don't come back until you are ready for your check. 

I ordered my favorite which is the tonkatsu with the soft boiled egg. The soup and noodles were on point like always. The broth was super flavorful and the noodles were yummy. I don't know if this is becoming a trend with noodle places but the soft boiled egg is cold and precooked before hand. Am I the only one turned off by this? I dunno, I just like how it used to be freshly made in most places. They have red ginger and garlic you can add to the ramen which makes it more flavorful. 

Definitely will come back since it's so close to home. Try the ramen spicy! It tastes great both ways depending on what you're feeling.",ZsjuEgOdvx9l5GKZdtwYIw,4,2,4,N1od7l9QCdMSvit2p5X1jA
5968890,2017-07-28,0,5xdKUuu4DbJ71KGbwRXfFg,"An authentic local ramen bar I can rely on for all my ramen needs! Being my 5th visit, I thought it was due time for one of these. I usually get the Tonkotsu mild, or medium - spicy (depending on how daring I am that day), kimchi rice and Asahi. 

Each time I visit I feel welcomed and never rushed. Service is prompt and dishes come out in a timely manner. Most ramen bars I've been to, servers are either new and can't handle stress very well... or aren't new and could care less about hitting the bare minimum of service. I feel like this spot hits all their points making it a pleasant experience.

I give it 4 stars only because I prefer having freshly boiled and yolk-y egg, but it's always cold in my ramen each time I go.. Anyway, try it yourself!",7Q-t0oocfqY_KZztAbfG-A,0,0,4,erpFAoFs3EuHQnrlVFN6ww
5978905,2017-02-09,0,5xdKUuu4DbJ71KGbwRXfFg,"I just moved to the southwest side of town and have really been enjoying the food options over here. Okay, so I will probably be blasted for this, but I can't stand pho. Yeah, every time one of my friends hears this, they insist that I just haven't tried THEIR favorite spot. Ugh...five attempts later, I still don't like it. I was hesitant to try ramen, thinking it was just another name for pho. Besides, when I think of ramen, I think of the messy $.29 packets my kids love. However, I wasn't feeling good one day and decided I needed some soup. I looked at the menu, and it seemed like there was a chance I wouldn't hate it. Well, I found that not only do I not hate, but I actually LOVE it, and I love Ramen KoBo. I've tried the chicken and the pork and just prefer the chicken. I add egg to mine, and I love it spicy. I discovered this place a month ago, and I've been known to eat here twice a week or more. It is a small place and can get busy, so you might have to wait. However, it's really worth it! Also, they're open late, which works for me when I forget to eat dinner and suddenly find that it is after 9pm.",u5r53zerLzYfDymhtmZlUA,0,0,5,ChJjXFEe5RH7o3t2M7BM1w
