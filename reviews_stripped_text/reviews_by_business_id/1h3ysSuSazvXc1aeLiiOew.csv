Also, absolutely nothing to complain about food or service wise. Great job!",jAazHTXIY8MtCUWEMNbPJg,0,0,4,EeUNaPZw6y7iTUiquGr7WA

Subway did launch an app to order in advance then come pick up when things are ready. I don't frequent to subway when I'm in the city. But since I'm out I Vegas for work, you'd think the quickest place to get food with a sandwich spot. WRONG.

At the Mandalay Bay, there's only this one food court with 4 businesses; Johnny Rockets, Nathan, Pan Asian Express and Subway. There needs to be another food court! It was an hour of a wait for subway and all stalls had long lines. Service was alright, it's a food court. They fulfilled all requests that were asked. Just the wait if ridiculous. Maybe next time I'll try their app and see if it's any better than physically waiting on line


AVOID THE FOOD COURT IF YOU CAN DURING PEAK LUNCH HOURS!",AXeS7cKHfvzifuK_VEKKog,0,2,2,eZ6kExEw29xnc3LkIuZ-sQ

We waited and 45 minutes passed and the guy was nowhere to be found. Turns out he was sitting at the tables in the food court, on his phone. If you have to close the register from the night before and it's 3:15am, why didn't you do that at 12:00am? Like, did this guy decide to take a break while he was ""restarting"" the register.

Kinda disappointed but we won't let that ruin our weekend in Las Vegas.",QFYqAk8n5Z1O3t7zwjA7Hg,1,0,1,kAYnguBAJ2Ovzz5s49fMcQ

Was turned away by security saying that the food court was closed. When I questioned about the 24hrs they replied ""I don't know if they're done prepping"". What exactly do they need to prep for if they're ""Open 24hrs""?? SO glad I wasted my time walking the mile from the casino floor to the food court for nothing. Maybe time to change that 24hr sign, eh??",ZhAPe3GMJqdjuYhiOqVX2w,0,0,1,Zh8Ng0Ug_7NhnjHfmF_ihQ

Anyhow, since this Subway is inside the Mandalay Bay Hotel (near the Shark Reef) their price is higher then near home. I was happy to find them. 
Ordered 2 one feet breakfast sandwiches, a milk, an OJ for $25. Not bad compared to cafe's 1 one omelette costs about $18.",n0ZZtaPtiZBjlz8pWnIkzw,0,0,4,oz6BHmLoll6I7cUIhd_Baw

I was staying at the Four Seasons Hotel a few weeks ago and I ventured out for a quick pre-dinner snack for my sister and me. It seriously took me about 45 minutes to just go downstairs and find Subway LOL. All the signs in the casino was confusing AF.

I eventually got my 6 inch spicy Italian. It was good and the girl working there was nice and friendly.",zvQ7B3KZuFOX7pYLsOxhpA,23,12,3,LUJ-AvadpAvHUPFo_9mDkw
