Watermelon Basil Alcoholic Drink - this was delicious a bit sweet but I enjoy sweet!

Lemonade- they use sparkling water and simple syrup, one child liked it one didn't

Caesar Salad- it had a slight sour taste, large portion definitely  enough to share

Macaroni and Cheese - cheesy goodness

Mashed Potatoes - My husband loved this, I prefer lumpiness

Brussel Sprouts- these were great, nice and tender with bits of bacon

Lemon Chicken - Not a very large portion, well seasoned and not dry

Short Ribs - No need for a knife they fell lff the bone and the sauce was great. My 8 year old ordered this and finished his plate

Lobster- steamed and then grilled, a tad dry, didn't enjoy the sauce they provided on the side. Good enough to order again.

Bone in Ribeye- they char their steaks so if you don't like it sure specify when you order or you will be unhappy. Pretty average compared to Ruth Chris, Mortons and DelFriscos

Margo our waitress made the meal. We all enjoyed our food, wish we had room for dessert. Service was impeccable and we will be back.

O.M.G! 

Amazing from start to finish. I purchased the Travelzoo voucher and it was totally worth it. $115 for $122 worth food. Look for it.

All the food was delicious. The poppers they give you at the start....well I can't really describe them. Just so good. 

I couldn't have alcohol at the time so the bartender made a mean virgin mojito. I had 2! 

I must admit, we did struggle to use our voucher up. So the waiter just kept bringing us more food. He definitely earned 5 stars.

Filet 10oz and asparagus - Perfect! Also got a side of chimichurri sauce 
Kobe Filet with green beans - Melts in your mouth! Oh my goodness my husband was in love. He also got the peppercorn sauce with added some heat flavor.

First the bread was below par. At least not my taste. That can be forgiven.

The filet mingnon was overcooked! That is a sin. Told the waiter about. He took it back,. Manager never showed up. Had to seek her after I paid for my wine. 

Them the manager had the odacity to tell me that she took care of me by not charging me for the steak and baked potato ( which I didn't to get to try). I told her if she wanted to take care of me she would not charge me for the wine. She declined.

They asked us if we were celebrating anything, and we told them it was an anniversary. The kitchen and staff were awesome in that they gave us two flutes of champagne and a duck pate appetizer on the house. Totally unexpected, but a very nice gesture.  We ordered a burrata appetizer and had the popovers. Both were good, but very filling so we had limited space left for the entrees.  Both of us ordering the bone-in ribeye probably didn't help, but the steaks came out perfectly medium rare.  They came with a pat of melting herb butter, roasted garlic clove, and a small bone marrow with accompanying small spoon....delish! We had the truffle mash potatoes and the roasted brussel sprouts.  While both sides were thankfully small, the potatoes were on the meh side, but the brussel sprouts were quite good.  We both had a wine by the glass with our meal.

139633,2016-04-02,0,07AZL5XenCQ_-op_onKLdw,"I went for an experience that everyone seems to want, to eat at a Gordon Ramsay restaurant. What better one for dinner than the one being competed for this season on Hell's Kitchen. 

Service was ok, somewhat attentive but not ordering the extras such as bottled water or wine seems to annoy the server. The pop overs were awesome, let's say that was where the experience climaxed.

The wedge salad was pretty good too, as was the steak civiche. Now let's talk about the main courses. I ordered a 10 ounce filet and forgot to add a sauce, did it need it..nope but no reminder ask from the server. That was odd.

The scallops, we're full of flavor but they seem to cope with each other. Don't get me wrong, great flavors but so many it took from the dish. I hear the great chef talk about too many flavors and was surprised. The sides were truffle mash and stuffed mushroom caps. The mash looked horrible. Brown soup. Yes a mash consistency but not appealing and the caps were good but dark brown and well not visually appealing either. 

So if you go, expect to pay for the experience and the food is descent but not what I would expect watching the critiques from Chef Ramsay.",j9HZUjJkR0DYTZTLAqt7UQ,2,0,3,T6QM0CXeAURidLoPLJoUGQ

384463,2014-07-02,2,07AZL5XenCQ_-op_onKLdw,"I see all of these positive reviews and my group of three, well, we won't be back to this location.  And it wasn't because of the food or the complimentary dessert bites because the food was indeed savory.  It was because of the waiter that serviced our table.  He was snooty and flat out rude.  My companions both ordered steak, it is after all a steakhouse and they received wonderfully prepared steaks that were quite large.  In fact large enough that you could take half of a piece home.  My husband and I shared one.  That is what got us ""on the bad side"" of the waiter.  But the truth is, neither of us could have eaten an entire steak ourselves.  And because I wasn't ordering my own meal, I was not entitled to water refills.  That's right you heard me, our waiter (not the busboy) would not refill my water glass when he filled my husband's glass and his colleague's glass.  In fact, the waiter would not acknowledge my presence whatsoever.  As a result he had 3 very unhappy, unsatisfied customers that felt he did not deserve a tip.   The bus boy was my personal waiter and we did tip him privately and the hostesses were polite and kind.  The three of us vowed not to return.  Next time we'll walk over to Paris and try Gordon Ramsey Steak as we know the steak will be just as good but perhaps the manager does a better job ensuring how his customers are treated by his staff.

Oh, and just so you know, the steaks were $50 a piece, if you wanted potatoes you paid an additional $10, if you wanted vegetables, you had to pay an additional $15.  If you do not order dessert the chef will send out a spoon-sized bite of dessert to top off the orders (in our case we received two, but that's fine by husband doesn't do sweets).  That was a classy touch, but I am sure it is meant to encourage you to change your mind and order dessert.  Had we received better service we would have ordered two desserts, one for myself and one for my husband's colleague.  We spent over $160 on dinner and had very little customer service at the table (the waiter seemed to be avoiding us altogether) So it goes to show, how the waiter treats the customer does impact how much the party is willing to spend and whether they will return or recommend to friends.  In our case, the recommendations are to avoid BLT Steak at Ballys!",BdQE52ErOrkzaBWexvl6UQ,5,2,2,ZP3A0QTuXB_Q504IBAUbVA

Not sure if this was a fluke but everything from the server to the manager to the steak and sides were horrible!  For a $55+ dollar steak, you expect it to be cooked well.  Word to the wise, if you want a medium well steak tell them medium, for a medium steak tell them medium rare.  Someone in my party made the mistake of telling them medium and was brought out a well done steak...no pink and WAY overlooked. Also don't bother getting the $60 bone-in rib eye...the cut of the meat was awful!  It was way too chewy.  They seriously need to fire their butcher...or the chef that doesn't know how to cook steak at a steakhouse.

Also if you want chargrilled, inedible mushrooms then BLT is your place!  We expressed to the manager our concerns and promptly (15 minutes later) they brought out another bowl of inedible mushrooms.  We didn't see the manager again until the very end...never came back to check on us which is odd since he knew we weren't pleased with our meals. I'd almost give him a pass, but the restaurant was not even half full.

My husband and I celebrated our 5 year wedding anniversary at BLT Steak Ballys Las Vegas on Saturday, June 24, 2017. We purchased a $115 voucher from Travel Zoo; which was worth $210 dining credit. Our total after using the voucher plus taxes and gratuitywas $60. The next day we checked our bank and was charged two different amounts totaling $381.05. If you add this amount to how much we paid for the voucher, it cost us a grand total of $496.05 for dinner for two. We've contacted the restaurant twice and they claim to have only charged us $60. They're only willing to refund the $60 to us. They blame it on our bank and told us to dispute with our bank. This overcharge should have never happened. No customer should have to deal with this issue. Now I'm left with calling my bank, the restaurant and travel zoo to resolve this issue. There are plenty other restaurants in Las Vegas.

Monday is a quiet night in the restaurant business so I figured let's do it.   Staff was nice, but for a high end steak joint what a disappointment!  No drinks ordered, no appetizer.  Had their ""signature"" popovers, which were over baked (Hard outside and not fluffy inside like they should be).  Well, we looked forward to our steaks.  Wife ordered a filet, I ordered a bone in rib eye. We made small talk for 20 minutes.  Then 30 minutes.  Then an hour.   FINALLY a full 1 1/2 hours later we got the steaks.  Both were ordered med.  rare.  Wife's was fine, mine was close to raw.  Let's say very rare.  Asked to have it cooked more.  Manager comes back in 10 minutes with a medium cooked steak.  Let's see, 1 1/2 hours for the first steak (Very rare) , 10 minutes for the second (Medium).  Something doesn't compute?   When we got home I researched out the company phone number in NY.   Contact is normally via email on their website.   I was pi$$ed and wanted to vent.  Young woman said a ""director"" will call me.  Nada, no call.   They obviously don't care about customer retention or brand loyalty.   Lots of restaurant choices in Vegas so they obviously don't count on return customers.   Won't go back.

I decided I wanted to go back to BLT for my birthday dinner this past Tuesday; we have been to BLT three times this past year alone.  I don't know if the recent CET bankruptcy has anything to do with it, but the service and food have taken a huge downturn.  The service was poor - we were left sitting for extended periods of time with absolutely zero attention from anyone.  This was unusual as in all of our past visits, the waiters and bussers were all over the tables and made you feel very special.  As CET Diamond, we received the complimentary appetizers, which have definitely been downsized since this past May.  My special birthday dinner was the Maine Lobster entree - WOW - can't believe they called that an entree.  The shells were huge, but the lobster meat was MAYBE the size of 2 crawfish.  My husband's short ribs (his go to at BLT) were also downsized and extremely fatty.  The side dishes were a joke; $11 for green beans (which was a personal portion), his mashed potatoes were served in a ramiken (about 3/4 cup) for $11!  

I gave the extra star for the popovers - which remained as they were.

992422,2014-05-07,5,07AZL5XenCQ_-op_onKLdw,"I was fortunate to receive an invite to BLT Steak, the newest restaurant at Bally's Las Vegas. Our table for four wasn't quite ready for us, so we grabbed a drink at the bar. Our bartender happily suggested one of their signature cocktails with basil and watermelon. It was mighty refreshing, slightly sweet and herbaceaous. I enjoyed it, but the overall crowd pleaser was their take on the Long Island Iced Tea. It was refreshing, with some bite. Just what I like in a cocktail. In addition to cocktails, they offer top shelf liquors, bottled beers and varied selection of wine. Prices range $8-$15 for most libations.

Once seated we were given an amuse bouche of pate and jelly, with toasts. It was a lovely presentation, but a bit rich. Later came the popovers that just might have made BLT famous. These monsters are light and airy, simply perfect with a pat of butter and pinch of salt. The egginess couldn't help but remind our group of Yorkshire pudding.

The menu offers seafood and poultry, but you must try the steaks ($20-$60). They are aged (mostly dry), broiled and finished with herb butter. We had the filet and bone in NY strip. Both had beautiful crust and were cooked to a perfect medium rare. More juicy and tender than you might expect. They offer sauces to accompany the steaks for a few bucks, but we agreed we liked the steaks on their own best. Though, the horseradish that came with the three mustards was the favorite. We also had the 2 pound lobster which had a lovely presentation, great flavor, it was delicate and tender; the trouble was there wasn't enough meat to it.

The sides ($10-$13) were heavy on taters, you could have them six different ways. We opted to try a variety, we shared onion rings, potato skins, hen of the woods mushroom, and caramelized brussels sprouts. We found the sides, with the exception of the brussels sprouts - now, those were delicious - to be the weakest link of the meal. We thought they were too basic, we expected a twist that would elevate your traditional onion ring or potato skin, but nope they fell flat.

Dessert ($10) was really decadent! Portions are large and good for sharing. We had the crepe souffle, warm chocolate tart, peanut butter chocolate mousse and mini doughnuts. The passion fruit sauce on the crepe would've been better served as a drizzle. It was cloying and overpowering. The tart was more of a lava cake, but the pistachio ice cream was wonderful. The PB and chocolate mousse was rich and heavenly, though, I didn't care for the banana ice cream pairing. The doughnuts were light and similar to churros and I really enjoyed the coffee ice cream.

Overall, it was a great meal. The staff, while warm and welcoming, still have kinks to work out, but in time they should be operating a well run ship. Rumor has it, the Sterling Brunch will return.",ZsUSGU1-L1ImomLZjXxxTg,13,5,4,P_WsJEgnY0I_RJPzoAXs5A

1037313,2014-06-07,0,07AZL5XenCQ_-op_onKLdw,"This is our second time going to a BLT Steak, and may end up being my last. Don't get me wrong, this place makes a decent meal. But for the prices they charge, I don't see the value.

Our trip to Hawaii a few years ago ended with a above-average dinner at BLT Steak. I found the STEAK was the most disappointing part of the meal, and that our server enhanced our experience with offers and explanations of different sauces to try with our meats.

On our recent trip to Vegas, my girlfriend wanted to go back as she had such great memories from Hawaii. Our dinner was nice, but more of the same. We were seated to a quiet, half-empty restaurant and immediately helped out by our server. I wanted to look over the wine list but found a lot of their wine prices were definitely high. Thus I wanted to wait until i had decided on my meal.

The chef sent out complimentary liver pate with a crostini which was tasty and appreciated. Being just the two of us though, I felt bad not eating much of it as we had made room for steak and only steak.

Then the popovers came out. The popovers are delicious and never disappointing. I enjoy that they even share their recipe with you to take home for the brave few who want to try and repeat such success. We got two monsteorus popovers and shamefully ate 1 3/4 of them.

The meal was nice, though it did not have some of the same options they had in hawaii. We settled for a Filet, a parm-herb crusted veal chop, and a truffle mash. The girlfriend enjoyed the filet very much, suggesting it was better than the last steak we had in Hawaii. But she also craved one of the sauces but couldn't remember which one it was. She asked the server, who brought out a peppercorn sauce. It ended up not being the one she had liked but by that point it didn't matter.

My veal chop was nice, but having my first veal chop, it was not at all that I expected. I take responsibility for that, it just seemed very fatty (not tender meat but fat). The real drawback was the parm-herb crust which was so thick and strong I didn't get much flavor for the veal. I cut and chewed and tore at this thing before I finally gave up. Half the parm-herb crust ended up scraped off.

We both enjoyed the truffle mash, sharing it was the perfect choice. It was whipped to an almost cream-like state which was a little strange but it had such a tremendous flavor.

All in all, we got our $170 check for our two entrees, two glasses of wine, side of taters and a $2 charge for the sauce we didn't like (which caught us off guard). Their menu had two prices for everything, adjusting for those with player cards, i believe. Because of all the numbers and the different colors it was hard to figure out what was what, and for the $200 we ended up dropping on this meal I can assure you I wasn't impressed for the money spent. The girlfriend will likely be back but I think this was in turn my last visit to a BLT Steak for some time.",DAE2pI34GCz2oCzEqa4W7Q,0,0,3,MDn6SCihPyLDNf5ChAdVig

Servers were friendly enough but didn't really leave us any impression. We ordered about 4 appetizer dishes; the taste and the presentation were just at average. Most deep fried items had that old oil taste as I was dining at a Chinese restaurant. Steaks were ordered at medium rare but they all turned out to be straight up raw and red.

1099925,2015-03-24,0,07AZL5XenCQ_-op_onKLdw,"My colleague and I were staying at the Paris Hotel over the week of March Madness. After watching some of the tournament games at the Ballys sports book we met up with his brother, walked by BLT, and decided to stop in for dinner before going out.

Dinner started with the complimentary duck liver spread and popovers, which I thought were both terrific. I then ordered their asparagus cream soup which I was told was somewhere between a cup and a bowl, our table ordered a few appetizers: onion rings, mashed potatoes, creamed spinach, and for my main meal I ordered a chicken dish. My colleague ordered a different chicken dish and his brother ordered fish.

The soup came out and it was nowhere near a cup and much bigger than a bowl...too much in my opinion but OK, I appreciate the large portions and I can always stop. The soup was good. It had good flavor but was not as creamy as I would have expected.

Next came the main course and appetizers. First the appetizers: the onion rings were  a soggy, oil saturated disaster. I could only eat one before my body begged me to think twice before continuing lest I end up collapsed in a gutter on the strip in dire need of a triple bypass. The Mashed potatoes and spinach were good but when I tell you the portions were small I am not kidding. The size of a Gerber baby food jar and that is not an exaggeration. I'm an average sized guy, 5'10"" 160lb, and there was no way I was leaving that place satisfied even if I ate everything on the table.

Next came the chicken. The first thing I thought when I saw the portion size was, ""how nice of them, they sent out some complimentary chicken wings."" Wrong...that was my dinner. There were two pathetic pieces of chicken sitting in a cast iron baking dish. One wing and one leg. Size-wise these would not have made the cut at Hooters. Both had a nice char on the outside and looked OK so I dug in. 

Well, it is a very good thing the waitress gave me a heavy, serrated steak knife to cut into them because otherwise I would not have stood a chance. It only took one reluctant bite before I had to call it quits. I had ordered chicken and they obviously made a mistake and served me the Petrified Chicken Jerky that I did not remember seeing on the menu. Waitress please!

This is where a ""two-star"" meal becomes a ""get-me-the-hell-out-of-here"" star meal and easily the worst dining experience I have ever had in Las Vegas. After explaining to our waitress that there was no way I could eat this meal and showing her how badly over-cooked and inedible it was she apologized and told me she would speak with the manager. A few minutes later she came back and informed me that they would be taking 10% off our check and also taking off the one drink my colleagues brother ordered. I told her that I ate 0% of my entree so it would stand to reason that I should pay for 0% of the entree. My colleague's brother also could not eat his fish because it was rife with bones. Regardless, 10% and that was that. Supposedly there was nothing she could do about that. The order must have come down from great Caeser himself.

Whatever. Since cost was not something we were going to haggle over we just paid our bill and left. On our way out we ran into the manager and he causally asked, ""so gentlemen, how was your meal?"" Well we let him know. It was obvious that he had no idea what had happened and was beside himself and very apologetic. I'm not sure how I felt about that since the waitress claimed that she spoke to the manager (maybe a different manager). Either way there was an obvious disconnect between the waitress, management, and the kitchen. That's a ""high-level"" red flag for me and tells me the place is poorly run.

Now I used to manage a fairly large restaurant myself and I fully understand and expect a kitchen to have an occasional off night. And every once in a while I also expect that I will catch a restaurant on an off night. It's OK, it happens. No need to go running off and writing nasty reviews on Yelp. This place is a steak house and I'm sure (at least I hope) that their steaks are better than their chicken and fish so I will not hang them completely on the food however unacceptable it was.

But, and this is a big one for me, when you are having a bad night and your guests are sending inedible food back to the kitchen you need to step up, accept responsibility and do your best to make it right. This did not happen in this situation and I'm not sure that it does in general at this establishment.

One thing about Vegas is that it is known for the quality of the dining experience. I've had mostly top-level experiences at every restaurant I've been to in Vegas. This was bad...really bad....from beginning to end. Easily below Vegas standards and I can almost guarantee you that any other restaurant you choose would be better.",VVPToklKnJCaN98CcQPjww,0,0,1,g8yCewVj8xWtoDAlMx94vA

1176858,2016-11-16,0,07AZL5XenCQ_-op_onKLdw,"If you want a popover - fine! If you want a steak - go somewhere else. I was tempted to leave it only one star but we have to have leeway for more terrible restaurants, thought that is hard to imagine. 
The main complaint: the steak was not quite warm and certainly never got hotter. They serve the steak in what appears to be a cast iron skillet. One would imagine that this could keep the meat at a desirable eating temperature, but not if it was not warmed initially, nor the steak was hot when placed in the skillet. When serving, they place a dab of butter on the steak and ours was so cool that the butter never fully melted, just got limp a bit. 
Next, they promote the steak as being prime - I sincerely doubt it. Aside from the sinew running through it, a good portion of it, the fat layer on the outside was much too large. Now, Prime connotes a certain degree of fat, that is what makes it prime, but that is fat that is in the meat, marbling, not a half inch or more around the outside that did nothing to enhance the taste or flavor.
It was Saturday night,and they were not busy - with good reason!. There is a discount coupon available at Tix4tonight that will save you 30% (on the food only - shortsighted) and it is still not worth it. The oysters were good, and with the discount reasonable. 
I could go on and complain about the service, the creamed spinach and there were some good points, but so over weighed by the bad, that I will not go there - nor should you. .",vpTNzBGb-S9bRJua6tv7bA,0,0,2,osOA5dXG2SkTVMOIZw1ztg

I've had the filet mignon at Ruth's Chris, Mortons, Smith and Wallensky, McCormick and Schmicks, The Palm.. you get the idea. I've been to all of them and I always order the filet. The filet at BLT is by far the best I have ever had. It was so tender and flavorful, I can't wait to go back to BLT at Bally's in Las Vegas.
To start I had the bacon. I thought it was strange to order bacon for an appetizer but I did no wrong. It was like eating a steak but it was bacon!! It was so good and lean and tasty I wish I could get this bacon on a daily basis.  I might have a heartattack at some point if I did but I would die happy. Almost forgot.. As we sat down the waiter brought an amuse bouche which was a duck mousse pate with crackers. It was really nice but my highlight was the bread at the beginning. What a surprise! They call it ""poppers"". It was like eating a croissant but with a hint of cheese. I know when a restaurant is good and will be a great experience when the bread at the beginning is delicious. Let's just say everything else after the bread was just getting better. I don't know how but it did. I was so excited after ordering dessert (apple pie) I couldn't help calling a couple of people to tell them how amazing dinner at BLT was. When the bill arrived our server brought a small free dessert like a chocolate chip brownie bite. I tried one and even that was decadent. 
The price at BLT might be a bit expensive (worth every penny) but you do get an little freebie at the beginning and at the end.

When you're in vegas, you don't want to sit around waiting to order, waiting for the food, waiting for the check. It puts a real damper on the whole experience. 

On to the food:
liver jelly amuse bouche- Pretty tasty and fun for those that rarely go near liver.

Popovers - Delicious. I could eat these all day. hot and fresh, butter and salt to top it off make it divine.

fresh vegetable salad - Great flavor, and nice portion size. I didn't know what was in the salad, and was pleasantly surprised to see plenty of pieces of avocado and big chunks of feta. The dressing tasted fresh and was delightful. It was a nice item to have before a big hunk of steak.

Filet mignon - Just OK. I got it medium rare, and it was cooked to that temperature. The outside of the steak was really good, with a nice tasty crust. However, the inside was too tough and chewy for filet. I want the steak to be extremely tender at these prices. Ruth's Chris beats this every time, hands down.  I also got the red wine sauce for $2 with the steak. it's lame to me they charge you $2 for a sauce when you're paying $60 for a steak, but whatever, it was still tasty. I recommend the sauce to add a little something to the filet experience.

Bone-in ribeye - my friend had this and was not pleased at all. He is a big steak eater, and said it was overcooked and not very good. I didn't try it, but that was his two cents.

1282978,2014-10-11,0,07AZL5XenCQ_-op_onKLdw,"Dinner at BLT Steakhouse in Bally's was very good. On a scale of 1 - 10 I would give it about an 8.5.

The Service - Top notch service. Everyone was very friendly and very helpful. At no time were we having to wait for something. The hostess was especially nice.

The Environment - Beautiful restaurant, dark and romantic. A little on the noisy side, but nothing that was an issue.

The Appetizers - I had the Spinach Salad which was spectacular and my wife had the Caesar Salad which she said was very good. They also bring you Cheese Popovers that are extraordinary. The popovers even come with a little card that has the recipe. Nice touch. Prior to the popovers, the waiter brought a little taste from the kitchen, which was a duck liver mousse with a jelly topping. The mousse was amazing.

The Entree - I had the Filet, which was cooked perfectly, but the flavoring was nothing to write home about. It was good, but not great. My wife had the Tuna Tartare as her entree and she loved it. She said it was the best she's ever had.

The Drinks - I had a Johnny Walker and Soda and it was STRONG!!!!

We did not have dessert, too full, but the dessert selection was good.

Overall the restaurant was very good. I'm a big steak fan, but I like bolder flavors, so I would probably not order a steak next time we come, but my wife will definitely order the tuna again.",8qsmYLq50FrvChuNrJbLEw,0,0,5,4cacDTk9bmMbv6nhRLBSqQ

1292728,2017-10-19,0,07AZL5XenCQ_-op_onKLdw,"Being from Texas, we were a little aprehensive about going to a steakhouse in Las Vegas.  Almost immediately, our aprehension disapeared and turned into excitement.  The restaurant was very nice and elegant.  It was a little dark at first but our eyes adjusted quickly and it became apparant that BLT takes pride in their restaurant.  We spent the next few minutes admiring the decor and layout.

We were greeted by Leslie and Conrad (a great team I might add), and the experience just got better.  Conrad went to filling drinks while Leslie took the time to explain the menu and make suggestions (with no pressure).  All we can say is....WOW!  These two made an amazing team and really took care of us; and to be honest, even if the food was just good - because of them we would still come back.

Now to the food, they started us out with a couple popovers, then followed by pâté.  Shortly after that we had our mixed drinks (Old Cuban's, which are kind of like a hybrid between a Mojito and a Long Island, very good!).  The popovers were nothing short of amazing (and they give you the recipe!) and the pâté made me want to move in.  I know it sounds bad but I wouldn't let go of the dish it came in until it was clean (no REALLY).  Next, we split a delicious salad, while still being pampared by Leslie and Conrad.  Finally came the steak (the Porterhouse for 2). 

It was perfectly cooked (medium is our preference) and already sliced for sharing.  We also got two sides, truffle potatoes and stuffed mushrooms, both are a must!  At the first bite, we were hooked!  After all that food, we still finished all 36 mouthwatering ounces.  For dessert, we were too full so they brought us two amazing little brownies that satisfied our dessert cravings.

We cannot recommend BLT Steak enough!  It is already on our return list for next time we are in Las Vegas.",dIWD89dHoC_rmnjNw5m3eQ,2,0,5,4ZgI8a0tD83mv6nm3Cuq_g

Ordered the Travelzoo deal.  This is a steal, basically 50% cost, for $420 worth of food/drinks.  We had four of us and had a hard time spending $420, without buying a bottle of wine.  It is enough for drinks, apps, salads, dinners, desserts for everyone (two of us did share a porterhouse).  All in all, the food was solid.  Nothing was super amazing or life changing, but everything was as expected for a steakhouse at that price point.  I did not leave disappointed.  I am not sure I would have paid full price for the meal, as I think there could be better meals for less cost, but with the deal it was great.  The popovers are famous and for good reason.  I could get full off of those alone.  I would probably give 3 stars for the porterhouse, as it was actually a little cold when we got it (like it had been sitting), even though it was on a ""hot plate"".

To start, we got amazing bread and butter and duck liver pate.  Not sure what it was actually called but was very smooth and tasty.  Cocktails were also great, had two old Cubans and mojitos.  They were strong and the different flavored stood out.

For our entree each couple shared their signature steak - a rib eye on a cast iron with garlic, butter, and thyme.  We also shared the lobster and a few sides.  Presentation was great, the only reason this place doesn't get the 5th star is because the steak was flavorful but was slightly tough and not as marbled as I would have hoped.  Still a darn good steak but I expected (and hoped) it would be perfect.  The only other reason is that it did not seem like a 2lb lobster.  There was not enough meat in it at all - each of us had one good bite and it was gone.

Excellent amuse, great pop overs and great salad too but when it came to the porter house it was terrible! I'm a chef and have worked in several high end steak houses as the broiler chef. This porter house $96 would have never been served at any establishment I have ever been to or worked for. The steak was cut before it was cooked because the waiter forgot to ring it in so they cheated and it came out terrible. We told the waiter nicely and he told his manager. We waited and ate around the raw (not rare, raw) meat while waiting. We had a show to get to and couldn't wait another 30 minutes for another steak.He came over 20 minutes later and gave us a 20 percent discount? We didn't even eat 20 percent of the steak!

The popovers were pretty good--hot bread is always welcome. We ordered the intimidating 36 oz porterhouse and lamb chops both medium rare. Unfortunately the porterhouse arrived blue rare while the lamb chops arrived rare. The sides were a joke. At $12 at other steakhouses, a side is usually pretty generous, but the stuffed mushrooms were tiny and only came with 5 and were honestly kind of gross. The truffle mashed potatoes had oil leaking from them, was overseasoned in a tiny cast iron pot, maybe half a cup of mash.

Service was good and the wine selection was nice.  Omar is definitely the jewel of this place.

Supposedly everyone loves the popovers, I wasn't impressed at all.  They tasted burnt and salty.  The duck liver mousse was good though.  I lied to my friend so he would try it.  If we weren't in public I think he would have spit it out!

My friend was disappointed because they don't serve prime rib but he managed and was happy with his steak.  My filet was salty and not the best meat for what they charged.  I didn't even finish it and I love red meat.

Drew loved his steak and the bone marrow.  The side dishes were good too.  Try the Brussels sprouts with bacon and honey.  So good!  The Mac and cheese was good, which isn't on the main menu.

That was literally the same word I said every time I took a bite of my short rib!!!!! 
I have never experienced such fabulous flavors all coming together to create the perfect short rib. 
My husband had the filet mignon and said it was the best he has ever had!!
Everything is a la cart so we also added the whipped mashed potatoes.
And your meal will come with a homemade pop overs. (Included in your meal). They are just like your remember having from your mother if you've had popovers before.......Soft- buttery and big! They bring you a jar of sea salt to top it off with. interesting taste to an already fabulous pop over!!!

My short rib was $42 his filet mignon was $62 and the potatoes were another $12. More or less.... we also shared banana ice cream for dessert and it was $10! Everything was absolutely fabulous I can hardly wait to go back to Vegas and indulge in what I consider to be the best steakhouse in Vegas.... even though I was full after the meal I suggested we go back and eat there on our last day in Vegas. That's how good it was.!!!
This restaurant is located inside of Bally's towards the back where it connects to Paris with the shops! 
Reservations highly recommended and dress is Business casual.
The wait staff service -was impeccable.
Eager to please.

Let me start by saying we came to BLT with a Travel Zoo certificate ~  upon check in the host asked for the certificate. We were seated and our server, Leon greets our table, confirms the Travel Zoo, then says don't concern yourselves with the restrictions just order whatever you'd like and the TZ certificate will apply! That was a great way to start our dining experience for sure!
  We all started with cocktails, 2 martinis, a Jameson rocks & for me a Manhattan....... Mine was EXCELLENT SERVED ICEY COLD W/ a splash of cherry juice = PERFECTION!!! The Toni's came with Blue Cheese olives always a nice touch.
    The filet (10 oz) the smallest available unless you want Kobe.... Just DEEELISSH, cooked medium was tasty not over seasoned you know seared on the outside and beautiful pinkish red on the inside. 
     A nice change of pace are the Humongous muffins they serve before dinner instead of bread ~ these things are served hot out of the oven & are FAB!! We ordered traditional sides loaded baked potatoes, green beans & asparagus ~ all were prepared al Dente except the potatoes & with a touch of butter.

Three of us had the 10 oz filet and one had the bone in strip, all with different levels of ""doneness.""  Every single steak was cooked to perfection and so tender!  I am super picky about how my beef is prepared.  Recently graduated from well done to medium well, knowing that most chefs usually do a medium when preparing my order.  It was medium well, and we all were amazed at how simply flavorful it was.  There are several different choices for sauces.  We either ordered the red wine sauce or the peppercorn sauce.  I loved the peppercorn sauce.  Thought it wes the perfect compliment.  To start I had the butternut squash soup which was delicious.  The sommelier picked out a beautiful Malbec - a 2013 Luca.  She was awesome, and took her time answering questions and doing some teaching.  She was really sweet!  As everything is a la cart, we each ordered a different side: loaded baked potato, mac and cheese, potato skins, and green beans. Everyone was very happy wtth their choices.  We were too full for dessert, unfortuately.
Let's talk about our waiter, ok?  Leon was freaking AMAZING!  He helped make the meal even better.  Attentive without being overbearing.  My best friend and 2 daughters were with me, and he put up with us in great form, joining in on our fun while we were still keeping it classy.  He bought my 2 daughters shots, the birthday girl a cute little dessert (tiny brownie bites) with a candle, and brought the 4 of us each a glass of champagne.  You would be so lucky to be seated in his section.  He truly looked like he was enjoying every minute of his job with all his tables.

Had plans to take nine customers to dinner at another steakhouse on the strip the next night, but was told by coworkers that they had been there the night before and were not impressed.  So...... I switched our Tuesday reservation to BLT after enjoying a great steak on Monday night. We started out with ""Popovers""  Most of the group had one, while I passed on the bread.  After looking at everyone else eating this stuff, I broke down and grabbed one.  I will say that it was an experience that I will never forget! :)  I next had a Caesar Salad which was huge.  Delicious and just the right amount of dressing, not over bearing.  I had the New York Strip (for the second night in a row), which was perfectly cooked medium rare along with some really crispy green beans.  I am a steak sauce kind of guy, but the melting butter on the top of the steak made my desire for A-1 (or the BLT sauce) completely unnecessary. Most of us ate steak, although one had the Sea Bass.  Everyone was impressed. If you are a wine drinker, you will love their wine list.  We drank plenty of red and white, enough to Impress Brenda and Eddie and Billy Joel.  The dinner staff at BLT was amazing.  I made sure to get all of their names because I was so impressed and didn't want to not acknowledge their awesomeness.  Our waiter, Mario and Busser, Jamie were constantly there to check on us and keep our glasses full.  It seemed like they always knew when we needed something and they timed it perfectly.

1531217,2015-08-06,11,07AZL5XenCQ_-op_onKLdw,"In a word: incredible. I wasn't expecting much from this steakhouse, tucked away in Bally's without a celebrity chef or known brand. But they really, really deliver. Cozy atmosphere, excellently executed menu, top-notch service.

POPOVERS: A fun version of the usual free bread service, these are delightfully airy with a crisp exterior. They're served with fresh Vermont butter and salt, and you even receive a small card with the recipe. I'll just come back instead of trying to make these myself.
DUCK LIVER PATE: A complimentary dish served to every table, this was served in a small jam jar with two small slices of bread. I like how the richness of the pate was balanced with the sweet jelly on top. An indulgent start to the meal that raised my expectations for the kitchen. 
STEAK TARTARE: It's not the best version I've had on the Strip, but it is delicious! A traditional preparation, plated with nicely crisp country bread, this is a great starter if you don't mind a  steak app before a steak dinner.
BURRATA: A heap of deliciously creamy yet mild mozzarella, surrounded with toy box tomatoes and accented with basil seed vinaigrette and basil leaves. Save your popovers to devour this. Add a touch of the salt from the butter, too.
ROASTED BEETS: Everyone has this on their menu these days, but BLT's comes as a salad with apple, french green beans, gorgonzola, and walnuts. BF called this the best version he's had.
BONE-IN RIB EYE: This was heaven. Cooked and served in cast-iron, it has a thick crust and was cooked perfectly to medium-rare. The fatty bites right next to the bone are the best part, and this is served with the marrow, a tempura-fried onion ring, and a whole roasted garlic bulb. Easily one of the best steaks I've had, and at a shareable 22oz and a wallet-friendly price. After taking the first bite, BF and I knew we would be coming back.
GRILLED LOBSTER: This is a $20 supplemental, and well worth it. Generous portion, served atop the steak, sweet and tender. I'm usually not much of a lobster fan, but I'm glad we decided to add this on.
TRUFFLE MASHED POTATOES: Despite all the rave reviews, this didn't go over so well with us. We like truffle-accented dishes, and we like potatoes, but something about this dish just didn't work. Good, smooth texture but it's the only thing on the table we didn't finish.
MANCHEGO WHITE GRITS: Wow. After leaving the south, it's been difficult to find great grits. Well, here they are, perfectly accented with a tasty green chile relish. I couldn't have asked for better.
BROWNIE BITES: We were too full to order an actual dessert, but were presented with this complimentary plate, and it's perfectly sized for just a hint of sweetness after the meal. 

I feel like I can't fully express what a great find this is- apparently others are catching on, because the dining room was packed on a casual Wednesday evening. I recommend making a reservation if you plan to drop in during dinner hours. 

Snag a Groupon while they're still up ($100 credit for $70), the discount is appealing but totally unnecessary to make me return- the food alone is enough to make this a strong and frequent recommendation when seeking a nice steak dinner on the Strip.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,17,11,5,6jpp6kXWZRQ4VuiIDBiZBw

1749031,2018-01-24,0,07AZL5XenCQ_-op_onKLdw,"Excellent food, excellent service.  Pleasantly surprised having known about this a la carte steakhouse for many years.  

Pretty flawless experience.  My mom and I had a hundred dollar credit.    No one could dine with us and we are light eaters.  Decided to splurge at the steakhouse.   The steaks were a bit pricey even for a la carte, but the filet was a large 10 oz only, so we ordered one and split it w a side of mashed potatoes and the Mac n cheese.  We also ordered the spinach bacon salad.  

We were presented with a compliments of the house bite size appetizer and then was presented with a charcuterie plate of four meats and a duck pate for our diamond status.  We were not expecting this and would have saved for desert instead of sides and salads.  But very good and very nice.   I didn't like the duck pate at all.  I am sure it was very nice though.  Lol.  

Steak was excellent, albeit we ordered medium and it was very medium rare (which made me happy anyway, not the mother).   

The sides were both very tasty, although on the small side for $12.  If we were not light eaters, they were not sharable, which is entirely too pricey.   Mashed and Mac are just mashed and Mac after all.  

The only main criticism would be the salad it was a fail.  It needs removed from menu.  The Flavors were not there, the dressing was nonexistent.  The flavors came from the very good, but bulky and almost jerky like chewy inch squares of bacon and the also very good when you had some blue cheese.   However, eating some jerky bacon before a nice steak kind of defeats the purpose of a smooth steak.  We had decided we had entirely too much food anyway and had them box it for my husband.  It was edible, but paired poorly and executed poorly.  

Ahh, forgot the popovers.  We were also served two huge hot and fresh popovers before the salad.   

Drinks were filled continuously, yet no staff were overbearing.  Plates were cleared and table was kept timely and throughout.   

Honestly, for a very good quality meal and a lot of meal we were at $100 for two people.  Although again we ordered one entree by design.   We would never eat two steaks and still brought half of one home for my husband.  I would actually recommend or return to this steakhouse again if needing to entertain or a special occasion.",WIu4IqktLQ6Qm46L5r5Baw,1,1,5,L3P2l8bH3YngLrI4XzRXSg

In all honestly, if i hadn't paid with the voucher and instead ponied up full price for this meal i would have been pissed. First off, when i go to a steakhouse that charges nearly 60 dollars for their top cuts, then it had BETTER be sublime. This one was not. I had the supposed 28 day dry aged bone in ribeye. It was too fatty, too bland, and NOT worth the 60 dollar price tag. Are you kidding me? Anyone here that tells you that simply has no idea what they are taking about. And they certainly don't know a great steak when they taste one. Geesh. I have eaten at some of the best steakhouses in town, and this place (at least as far as the steak) falls way short.

Service: almost as soon as we sat down we were greeted by a server, Hugo. He was so warm and friendly and welcoming, you wanted to make him your friend for life. What a nice man. And the service stayed at that level throughout the meal. The food Runners, the Busboys, and Hugo, all did an excellent job.
Food: Hugo came to the table and explained that the travel deal coupon was good for anything on the menu up to $416. We could get appetizers entrees desserts and alcohol. If we went over by a little bit they would surcharges by that amount only. Nice!!
The meal started with to passouts - a plate with pate and some bread slices and four humongous gruyere popovers. I am not a fan of pate but I can vouch for the popovers. Wow, were they good! 
To start the  meal, we decided to share the tuna tartare, the grilled bacon, and the Lobster Cobb salad. The tuna tartare comes with house made very delicate potato chips. Spectacular! The Lobster Cobb was a little bit light on the lobster but also was extremely tasty. The grilled bacon was a little on the salty side but I found it to be excellent. As an entrée my wife and I each got the bone in ribeye. One of our friends got the rack of lamb. Each of us found their choice of entree to be outstanding. We ordered the ribeye medium and it came perfectly cooked. One minor disappointment with the meal was the side dish of Hen of the Woods mushrooms. I found that to be rather Bland. We finish the meal with to share desserts. The praline sundae and the s'mores mousse. Delish. The only other minor disappointment with the meal was the decaf coffee which was thin and watery.
Ambiance: the only reason this wonderful dining experience didn't get 5 stars. The restaurant needs seriously updated decorating.

I made note of it when I made my reservation on OpenTable, the hostess asked for it, and our server took the time to explain how it worked. 

The service we received was impeccable.  We never once had an empty glass of wine or water.  Our server took the time to answer any and all questions. We were checked in on several times.  We were never rushed.  If this review was strictly for service, it would be 5 stars. Unfortunately, it's not.  

The ""compliments of the chef"" duck pâté was delicious, the shining star of the meal for me.  The popovers are served with salt and unsalted butter, and they are gigantic - much too much bread before a big meal.  Crusty on the outside, chewy on the inside.  I enjoyed them, my husband did not. The burrrata & tomato was delicious though the basil seed vinaigrette was tasteless.   The smoked bacon appetizer was very good, and a great sized portion, though the chimichurri sauce quickly became overwhelming.  The mashed potato side was extremely bland, and it's laughable that this is a sharing size.  It came out in a ramekin.  

The steaks.  We each ordered the NY Strip.  There is no place on earth that a $60, aged steak, should require me to saw my way through it with force.  I should not have to eat baby sized bites because it's impossible to chew.  I should not require sauce to make it edible.  These steaks were an absolute disgrace.   We had no intention of finishing the meal, and were too full on apps, and irritated, to even bother with sending them back - because yes, both steaks were terrible, which leads me to believe this is not an isolated event.

At least 3 times when I very politely asked for something (a side sauce, remove the extra wineglass, get a to go box), I was told with a straight face 'NO.' 'WHY?'  I was just shocked. Never have I had this even at McDonald's. then he followed with 'of course you can' as if it were funny. 

I came here for a fine dining experience, not to banter or entertain you at my expense.  

You barely attended to us, you ignored stacks of empty dishes on our table. If you were remotely competent I might have overlooked the attitude. 

As CET diamond I received complimentary appetizers from another waiter, who also jokingly pushed back when I nicely asked for a to go box.  This must be going around the staff.  I told him I already got the humor from the first guy so he backed down, though I still had to justify for 2 minutes on why I needed a box.

I take it this is some form of passive aggressive stress relief to treat customers like sh*t, jokingly tell them 'NO' when you are asked to do something?! I'm not laughing.  

Save your attitude and poor humor, it's unprofessional and we don't have time for it. 

Customers get few opportunities to come out for a good experience. My time is valuable and this isn't exactly pocket change.  You just ruined my night.

1988350,2016-12-05,0,07AZL5XenCQ_-op_onKLdw,"Wow. Everything I had was delicious and worth every penny... dollar. 

In town for friend's bachelor party weekend, while most of the time was buffets, and tourist spots. The best man, Arnold, decided on one night to have a formal celebration dinner for our friend. 

The staff was friendly, very informative, and made us feel welcomed. The gruyere popover breads were oven fresh, and tasty. A bread with a nice crisp crust, and steaming soft center, perfect by itself or dollop of butter.  We asked for more.

All our sides were great, and we shared the likes of mushroom caps, and creamed spinach.  I ended up choosing the truffle mashed potatoes, which are runnier than the average person is use to. This is not your KFC potatoes. This was flavorful. The grilled asparagus was lightly seasoned, but done well.

Most of the guys opted for the usual big cuts of steaks like the 22 oz rib eye, and the porterhouse which were all very good.  I've had fine dining, and great meals all over the world, yet some how never had waygu/kobe beef before, which happen to be on the menu. A little on the pricey side, in comparison to the other cuts, but hey, you only live once. For about $50, I got 12 oz of pure heaven. To be fair the guys made fun of me as I had the smallest cut of meat of everyone. I told them I would give them a small piece, but then they'd each owe me $5 if it wasn't the best steak they've had. Easiest money ever! The steak was properly cooked, seasoned with salt, pepper, and served with a dab of butter. It practically melted with each bite. 

I don't remember most of the rest of the weekend. This dinner is an exemption of what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas.",RnUlqwdkAHBYQU6xyMTJFw,1,0,5,u91rn-VQCaMCeq7NZHXjYg
1991418,2016-04-13,11,07AZL5XenCQ_-op_onKLdw,"I will never make the mistake of returning to this restaurant. And by never, I truly mean NEVER.

Got in on a Saturday and snagged a 7:30 reservation. My party arrived at 7:25 to check in, and we still had to wait a good 10 minutes before being sat down. Because we had to be at the Aria by 9, we figured a solid hour or hour-and-fifteen dinner would be enough, but boy, were we wrong. 

Though we were presented with pate and crostinis to start (""compliments of the house"") and some delicious, fresh-baked popovers, it took at least 15 minutes for our order to be written down, which I personally found ridiculous since we knew right off the bat what we wanted to eat. So, let's get to the bad, the awful, and then the worst.

Bad:
1) Drinks took FOREVER to arrive. And by drinks we mean some sodas, a lemonade, one beer and one glass of wine. We had to ask where our drinks were. Seriously?! Also, they don't serve lemonade, but the waiter eventually brought a lemonade to my sister-in-law. Apparently he grabbed it from the restaurant next door...?
2) The waiter avoided us like the plague, which we found insulting. If I'm paying $60 for a cut of steak, you better show me $60 service!

Awful:
1) Literally everyone in the restaurant was eating except us. People who sat down after us were serviced quickly; people in shorts, flip-flops and sweats were getting their food left and right. Yet the well-dressed table of five with smiling faces couldn't catch a glance!
2) We flagged the manager down after 45 minutes of waiting to let him know what was up. He tried calming us down, but when he promised the food would be out in ""5, 10 minutes"" and it didn't happen, we felt bamboozled. That, and HUNGRY AF.

Worst:
1) We were there for an hour and ten minutes and NOTHING HAPPENED. We left starving, angry and ready to complain.
2) We decided to never come back.

Hey, BLT Steak, thanks for ruining our night. Nothing like leaving a an expensive restaurant starving your face off.",fF7__2E4T7H601qkf3_kPQ,3,2,1,tOr9O6Ssapn_W-8SWcmJaQ
1995997,2017-01-14,1,07AZL5XenCQ_-op_onKLdw,"Asked front desk at Bally's where to go for dinner he suggests BLT steak and tells us the chef was the last winner of Hell's Kitchen which we are fans of especially Gordon I love him he reminds me of my father that died recently .  We thought we were going to have a great experience.  It started off ok.  Our bartender wasn't the friendliest guy.  I asked what they had for reds and he turned around without a word grabbed a menu then slapped it in front of me.  So far weird but the signature BLT drink with the dried orange was so good and I thought things would get better when we got a table.  When they brought us to our table we passed by several very open areas scattered with people comfortably enjoying their meals.  We were sat against the wall next to the kitchen sandwiched between 4 other tables maybe 18 inches away from each other if we were lucky.  My husband told me next day that that actually put him in bad mood which is funny because I was also really bothered by that but I kept it to myself thinking it would get better.

It keeps getting worse.  Waitress Margo I Think was nice enough but she didn't care.  She didn't seem to care about anything nor have much knowledge about anything.  She kinda blew off each question I asked her like I asked if the tabouleh was really minty and she said oh no it's not minty at all and I felt like I had to inform her that traditionally it had mint in it it seemed to me like she played it off as if she already knew but I believe she was clueless because it was like ya ya I don't care uh huh how can I get out  of here.  It made me so uncomfortable that I started apologizing that I asked a couple questions.  Then my husband makes 3 attempts to be friendly and ask her how this or that is and she clearly didn't care and couldn't wait to get out of there.  I said to him each time she doesn't care.  He got mad at me because I kept saying that but he can't help himself to keep trying which is killing me to watch.  So he tries to tell her the pop overs aren't that great to me they are very eggie not very cheesy tasting at all they are like chocolate eclair without the chocolate.  She says ok and walks away.  Maybe she didn't hear him?  She acted like she did.  She spoke English as first language.  My husband did say there were so many people unnecessarily packed next to each other that he had trouble hearing me.  My husband suggested I get the scallops with tabouleh because it's a chalkboard special of night.  I got 2 and 1/2 scallops not really big but on small side of large with maybe 1/2 cup tabouleh.  Scallops were over cooked at least half of the deformed 1/2 scallop was and the tabouleh was just ok the lobster bisque was very tasty but by the time I got to the 2 pieces of lobster claw they were saltier than I would have expected, chewy and definitely over cooked.  The wedge salad was pretty average not something you would expect to come out of Hell's Kitchen.  1 bite of that salad and the waitresses attitude and I just wanted to leave.  She makes mistake of dropping off the 2.6 scallops for the special price of $45 and asks me how things are as I am staring at my plate in Complete disbelief.  Had she been nice and engaged or acted like she cared I might not have been so upset but I pretty much lost it on her and told her that she ruined our night with her attitude and on top of that I said are you serious?  If  had known it was $50 for 2 scallops I never would have ordered it,  if you want to start your night off on the wrong foot and pay lots for nothing then you need to go to this place.",cQRyu8xRKfTCG5AwbS1lxg,5,0,2,-zEZnLTrUr1onQS9EVGIoQ

Now, I don't necessarily hate this place but the food was meh. My family and I ordered the oysters, tuna tartar, crab legs, rib eye, filet mignon, onion rings, lobster, and green beans. 

Oysters - I'm not a big oyster fan but the one oyster I did have tasted fresh and was good. My parents love oysters and they dug this dish so that's safe enough to say that the oysters here are good quality. 

Tuna Tartar - Fresh fish and great sauce. Awesome. 

Crab Legs - Not as meaty as I thought they'd be, they were seriously lacking. 

Onion Rings - These were terrible. Not crispy at all, they were borderline soft and mushy. I don't know what was going on when they made these, but the taste of soft batter and hot oil made me feel sick. 

Rib Eye - I don't know why, but my steak was literally charred. I understand when you cook steak it's supposed to have marks on it, but this was unbelievable, all I was tasting was burned leather. 

Filet Mignon - Good cause it wasn't as charred as the rib eye. 

Lobster - Easily the best. Great tasting, fresh, and meaty. 

Green Beans - Typical green beans you'd find at any steak restaurant. They're okay. 

The service was good, the price is about what you'd expect at any steakhouse, and the restaurant is kept clean and tidy. The ambiance is good and there is a romantic atmosphere to the dimly lit restaurant floor. This place has its hits and misses and averages out to a decent place to get dinner.

2181112,2015-02-05,1,07AZL5XenCQ_-op_onKLdw,"Was excited to try the heavily advertised BLT Steak while I was in Las Vegas and splurge on a great dinner.  I sat at the bar and ordered dinner.  After reviewing the menu I found the WAGYU ribeye to be quite tempting - even though it was $91.  I had a great WAGYU ribeye in Houston about a year ago and it was the best steak of my life.  I figured why not go for it - Wagyu is not in that many restaurants.

Of course I ordered the steak medium-rare because you don't want to overcook a Wagyu!  It came out in a nice presentation in a small cast-iron pan.  Immediately I noticed that this steak was very thin - probably about 3/4"" in thickness which alerted me that it would be easy to overcook.

Sure enough, when I cut into it the temperature was MEDIUM - one level beyond medium-rare.  I was ok with that but this piece of meat was not rich, succulent and full of great wagyu flavor which I expected.  It was completely underwhelming.  It was not tough but it was not 'butter-knife' tender like a great wagyu.  The steak was comparable in my judgement to a visit to a local Texas Roadhouse or Longhorn.  

Overall, I don't mind paying the total check $125 (steak, one drink, one side of potatoes) but I expect this to really deliver FULL SATISFACTION.  I really would tell the management of BLT that they should consider removing this item from their menu as it is a complete liability.  

Last note of interest:  I heard the bartender recommending to other customers his choice of steaks - he said he was a ribeye lover but did NOT recommend the Wagyu or Prime ribeyes but rather a bone-in New York strip.  That made me worried but I had already ordered.......",qJwc6VUOttRB0W5qhFo5wg,1,1,1,YUkImPesEtzAJvFi8_fkuQ

We were the first customers to be seated early on a Saturday evening. BLT Steak has a modern steakhouse feel-dark woods, comfortable seats, soft lighting-and is tucked away in the back corner of Bally's, which cuts down on casino noise. 

Service was excellent. Our server cheerfully answered all of our questions, and we had a lot of them. Although she barely looked old enough to drink, she made a great wine recommendation. Portion sizes were fairly generous, save for the grilled branzino I had that was pretty tiny. Salads are big enough for 2 people to share. The ""famous"" popovers are also large and quite filling, so keep that in mind. Other than the size of my entrée, the only other criticism of the food was my husband's bone-in strip was a little over seasoned...but it must not have been too bad because he still ate the whole thing!

Prices-especially for drinks-are expensive but on par with comparable steakhouses on the Strip.

They first serve you bread with pate, then their popovers which was nice and fluffy in the inside, but I tried not to eat so much to save room for our oysters and medium rare bone-in rib eye. 

My hubby and I have recently got into eating oysters and we decided to order a dozen. Six from the west coast and 6 from the east coast? I don't know much about oysters but our waiter was helpful to educate me on the difference. One was small, salty and a little sweet and the other type was bigger and more briney. O.m.g. We have tried oysters at a buffet once and our local taco shop, BUT these were such a treat! It was SO good and actually see the difference between the ones we have tried before. The day after we tried Paris Restaurant's oysters and the oysters were small and cost $10 more at Paris. BLT was def much better. 

Bone-in ribeye: after reading reviews, I agree that it was a little too charred bc at one point I did spit out. Other than that, we requested medium rare and they cooked it perfectly. The meat was big, flavorful, and juicy (thatswhatshesaid). I saved it and ate it for lunch today and it was still good haha. The steak also comes with a side of bone marrow.

    We ran into bltSteak on accident. We happened to be there and we were hungry. So we thought ""this place is good as any, why not?"" And on we went. We were wrong. This place is way better than most. This place is a diamond hiding in plain sight. The setting was great, the staff was top notch. And the food was everything you could hope for in a proper steak house. We had 1 salad, 2 steaks, a side of mac n cheese with a water. It was $175.

Wasn't sure about this place at first it is in the same spot as the old Sterling Steakhouse at Ballys. Love the new updated decor. Right away when we sat down we were offered charcuterie
platter, foie gras with jam and toast & cheese bread  with garlic and truffle on the house for 7 star members. 
Then the popovers with greyer cheese toasted on top was so yummy!!! We ordered lobster & avocado salad, blue cheese wedge , 2 bone in ribeyes medium rare seared to perfection it came with bone marrow & roasted garlic, well done onion rings, steak tartar! 
Second visit we ordered the same with added roasted beet, apple & goat cheese salad, chicken & dumpling soup and dessert you must try banana creme pie & also their passion fruit creme brûlée is to die for! 
On our second visit the  steaks came out cold so the manager in charge apologized made us all new sides & 2 cooked to perfection medium rare bone in ribeye! Definitely recommend this place can't wait to try their Sunday brunch !!",WgbocVhRcRXHwVyi9kfI4w,0,1,5,P-ohzPZG0MUE7F5qSalk4g

So, we did speak to the manager, Lawrence and ended up being pleased with the way he handled the situation. The server Leon, was great. He wasn't overly attentive with his good timing and had a good sense of humor. The food was delicious, we ordered seared scallops, Caesar salad, green beans, lobster mash, Mac and cheese, a steak, and lobster. Even the popovers were great!

We came on a Sunday night before it got crowded and I'm glad we did. I can see how it gets crazy given it's inside Bally's. We were seated after a few minutes of waiting in the bar. The service here is 5 star and we love that. 

As for the food, the popovers live up to the hype - no doubt! We had the grilled/smoked bacon, the tuna tartare, and the french onion soup as starters. We were also gifted with a small plate of pate' and crackers. It was delicious! The bacon is a must for those that love bacon. The husband had the rib eye and I had the bone-in NY strip. Husband's steak came with bone marrow and a bulb of roasted garlic! GIMME THOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOSE!! He was quickly stripped of both.

Dessert was divine. We had the banana pudding with a pecan crust and we were gifted with 2 small brownie bites. Both were heavenly - that little brownie bite was as rich as a huge slice of chocolate cake!

The quality of the beef is definitely prime and they are cooked to perfection. That said, both steaks were in desperate need of salt. We're huge fans of Ruth's Chris and are constantly looking for an equivalent and although we enjoyed BLT, the steaks just don't compare. Would we return?

However, a gal that was newer on bar was amazing, saved the night and resumed our confidence to order (She gets 5 stars).

Enjoyed them all. Especially the blackberry mule.
Food coming out to others looked amazing - burgers, steaks, onion rings in tower form.
I hope this new, friendly, female bartender stays on here. She was super grateful for her job and and saved our visit by doing it well with a smile. I hope she got our $$ tip but likely not, sadly.

They gave us complimentary bread and duck liver mousse with crostinis. I'm not much of a bread person but the duck liver was perfect. Wished they gave more crostinis.

As for the food, here's what I ordered/got to try:

- Oysters - OMG super fresh!

- Manchego Grits - Not bad. I probably could have done without it.

- Truffle Mashed Potatoes - A bit more watery than your average mashed potatoes but SO flavorful.

- Brussel Sprouts - Crispy goodness

- Creamed Spinach - Not the best I've had

- Ribeye Steak - A M A Z I N G! Came with bone marrow too.

Everyone got a complimentary chocolate truffle at the end. Topped everything off just right. We were all stuffed to say the least and had some delicious leftovers for later when we got drunk munchies. Highly recommended!",DLB8lVPf4L0Vm4VzgcGOXQ,5,4,5,q8heT-px2Lw2Xp0J-4TC_w

My wife had lobster Cobb and the lobster was as fresh and sweet as can be. I had the bone in ribeye which was delicious. Also had stuffed mushroom side which was tremendous. Banana cream pie for dessert very good. Only thing I didn't care for is what so many other reviews rave about- the bone marrow. Actually I'm being polite (was gross) but hey personal taste I guess. Decor was nothing special. And venue (the old and tired Ballys casino) is not worthy of a high quality restaurant like this. Neither of the aforementioned complaints merits deducting a star.

Hugo was our server for the evening and he was great along with all the managers who stopped by our table to make sure everything was super-de-duper.

Drinks:
Watermelon Basil which is what I was going to order (Ketel, Cointreau, Muddled Watermelon and Basil).

Hugo recommended the Got My Mojo Workin': I wasn't crazy about the thought of Ginger Green Tea in it but it was delicious! (I ordered two!)

The Cool Woodford was NOT our cup of tea but then again we aren't really bourbon drinkers - it was QUITE strong! 

Chef Compliments:
Duck Liver Pate with Port Jelly was salty and not bad tasting. 

Popover bread with Gruyere cheese wasn't the best for either of us but interesting with the cheese baked right in the bread. I did like the crispiness of the bread with the light cheese taste, butter and sprinkled salt. 

Salad:
Lobster Salad was SO good! Like SOOO good!! Big pieces of lobster in a Cobb style salad with crispy bacon, half a soft boiled egg, crispy onion straws, different types of lettuce and a delicious house made 
Buttermilk Ranch dressing - this could actually be a light meal or almost too much as a starter salad because of all the goodies in it! Just pick out all the lobster and other good stuff and leave the lettuce behind... I MOST DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THIS SALAD!

Bibb Salad w/Manchego cheese, beets and a Mustard Vinaigrette was tasty as well - better for a starter for dinner and less filling than the Lobster salad.

Mains:
2lb Lobster from Maine: poached AND grilled to retain its juciness. I love seafood and this was juicy and delish! I MOST DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THIS ENTRÉE! I pretty much ate it ALL all by myself!

Waygu Rib eye: Ordered medium rare was cooked perfectly. The flavor was very good, crispiness on the outside but chewey and flavorful. A little salty for me, but some people enjoy theirs more on the salty side.

Desserts/After dinner drinks: 
Crepe Soufflé: passion fruit, fluffiness, sweetness, tartness and with the burnt sugar to boot! 

Warm Chocolate Tart w/ pistachio ice cream: Ummm I LOOOVED the pistachio ice cream!! The tart itself was a little bitter for me, I'm more of a milk chocolate type of gal but it was moist and rich on the inside.
 
Grand Café: Friend loved it.

Moscato D'Asti!!! Sweet and delicious!

Chamomile tea w/honey as if I wasn't already in a food coma, this will really help put me to sleep!

Everything was delicious and service was excellent from every staff member on the floor.",Rdt-JiAN7Qlw3dJ7UVdNtw,14,12,4,frMFtby6aeYZX_CN7Nsctw

To start they bring you their famous Gruyere popovers, hot from the oven with room temperature butter and sea salt for the perfect crusty bite!  A plus was a wallet sized recipe was included :-). 

He had the spinach salad, with delicious maytag blue cheese and bacon (spelled YUMMY).  I had the Bibb lettuce salad with mustard dressing. Shoe string bits of manchego cheese along with paper thin slices of raw beets and radish. One bite tasted like possible fennel, I wished for more of that flavor. The mustard dressing did not have as much bite as I like. The salads are quite large and I think next time we'll split the spinach.  

There are no steak options less than 10oz which is a bit much for me.  I got the filet, he got the wagyu flat iron. Definitely go for the wagyu next time. They offer sauces, I got peppercorn, he got bernaise. We both preferred the flavor of the steaks alone. The peppercorn was slightly sweet and off putting. The bernaise was rich and overtook the steak rub. 

Now about the sides....oh my Lord God, thank you for the creation of Brussel sprouts and butternut squash. They were both divine. Butternut squash is prepared as a smooth purée with brown sugar. Brussel sprouts are sautéed with onion, bacon (aka yummy) and drizzled lightly with honey. Honestly I could have had entree sized portions of these two items and would have been delighted. They are both a must try if you see them on the menu. We sadly had to skip dessert as we had to make it to a comedy show (Tony Baker is hilarious).

The food quality was very poor. My filet mignon and my son's bone in rib eye were cold when served. My steak was tough to cut. My baked potato was cold and had the texture of having been cooked in a microwave not an oven. My fully loaded toppings did not melt into my baked potato. 
The tuna and steak tartare were good as well as the creamed spinach. The stuffed mushrooms and popovers were ok. Both seemed to be over cooked. 
To top it off I had asked for a birthday acknowledgement; the waiter didn't bring anything until I asked for desert and then he said he took the desert off my bill. Really I didn't want singing or anything like that but may a candle in the desert.

The peanut butter-ish flavor was unappealing and the chocolate didn't help much. We left half of it uneaten, and that is almost unheard of for me and a dessert. The wedding soup was something non-traditional and it was very good. The bone in prime rib was good but I'd try something else if I went again. The filet was tender and tasty.

There was something beneath the jelly which looks like peanut butter but tastes nothing like it. Perhaps it was almond butter? There was a complimentary bread that was nice and steamy when you broke it open. One of the best breads I have had at a restaurant.

I ordered the 10 oz filet mignon cooked medium rare. Very juicy and great with the added butter. The chef also provided complimentary dessert. Brownie bites. So much complimentary appetizers and sweets that I didn't even order any. I am a stuffed animal now.

We would've loved another round of drinks, but were never even given the opportunity to order another. At one point during our meal, he actually stood over on the other side of our table and stared at us eating talking to himself of what he needed to do next.

We thoroughly enjoyed the tartar but they give you chips to eat the tartar with and very few of them. Slightly disappointed. 
I ordered the lamb chops because they sounded yummy. Boy oh boy i was very happy with my choice. Great flavor! I ordered a side of asparagus which was cooked perfectly. They were nice and crunchy. 
My friend ordered steak. The NY strip with bone in. He said it was fab!
The truffle mash-potatoes were not as good as i thought they would be. My other friend's steak was not worth the price but i forget what she ordered. 
The staff was attentive. If you leave to powder your nose, the cloth napkin will quickly be snatched up and refolded for your return. They also sweep off the crumbs from place setting for each course served. Kinda tedious if you ask me. 
So food overall was good. However i would never go back. The prices were high and you don't get sides with your meal.",RUIXYHZYs84rvhiQ5b30Eg,0,0,4,jNL-dhOXZbL4rUakiaFcAQ

They explained when ordering that the steaks are served with a distinct char, which made me nervous, but this was truly some of the best steak I have had!  They start the meal with popovers, which were excellent, they serve it with the recipe so you can attempt to make at home.  We started our meal with the crab cakes which had the perfect crab to bread ratio.  With the mains we had onion rings (big, crisp and the perfect coating) mashed potato (creamy) and the brussels sprouts (mixed with bacon).  Dessert was a delicious piece of banana cream pie, with a thick crunchy graham and nut crust and the filling had big chunks of banana.

For most, this would be the grand finally...alas, BLT performed an E-Street band worthy encore of whipped butter and a tin full to the bone of salty excellence (salt).  Once this triad of flavors hit the taste buds a rather unique biological reaction happens in the form of a slight moan & your eyes gravitating towards the back of your head in what can only be described as pure ecstasy...
Once you regain consciousness you are elated to find out the experience has just begun for there is still the main course yet to come.  What awaits behind door number two is what the gods call heaven on earth, if you consider your heaven a perfectly cooked bone-in strip with a char so immaculate I'd slap my mamma if I weren't certain she'd retaliate guns blazin....  I was able to tackle the beast with my sharp cunning as an individual...along with my trusty cattle prod, Betsy, should the event turn sour....

I received ok service, not bad enough to knock a point off, but the waiter seemed uninterested especially since I didn't order wine. But I know service isn't the only thing. 

I received a pop over that I didn't order, my guess for use in promotion. But it was a pleasant surprise. The bread melted in my mouth. I wanted more, but knowing my stomach, had to save some room. I even received the recipe on a card to take home. 

I ordered the port wine braised riblets with a side of mac and cheese. The mac and cheese came in a skillet and used a white cheddar sauce. It was excellent. The riblets came out in a huge skillet pot filled with sauce and the hunk of meat in the middle. The meat just melted, I mean melted like chocolate on a 90 degree day,  in my mouth. It was seasoned perfectly and so tender.  

After my amazing meal, I got to meet Hell's Kitchen winner and new Head Chef Ariel, only three days into her job. She seems truly confident in her work and team and after eating that meal, I told her to keep going forward because it was awesome. 

The price is what you would expect from vegas. Entrees are in the 40-55 range. But the quality of food is worth every penny.

Next came the BLT popovers, a kind of bread that I'm told is famous. It was pretty good and was served with butter and sea salt. We ordered the wedge salad. It came with enough of a portion for two and was very good, not the best I've had, in fact, I would say Austin's in Texas station is one of the best wedges in Vegas, but very good nonetheless. I ordered my favorite cut, the one which I judge all steakhouses, the bone-in ribeye, medium rare. This steak was awesome!!! I've been to nearly every steakhouse in Vegas and this one is definitely one of the top I've had. The critic, my wife, ordered the king crab legs. We actually share everything so most of the time she picks what I eat as well. The legs were delicious; sweet, moist, succulent. She was impressed by both the steak and the crab legs. Not so much the popover bread, which is weird because the bread is usually her favorite part. For sides we ordered the fries with cilantro mayonnaise and the potato skins. I know, lots of potato. I alway have leftovers for my daughter and she is obsessed with fries, so, I order them. They were really good though. The potato skins were very good. To end the meal we chose the banana cream pie. This was not what I expected, it was amazing!!! From the crust made with graham and nuts to the fresh bananas inside, both my wife and I were very impressed. And it is large! Enough for us both plus a huge chunk for the kid at home. Our server was Leon, assisted by many, and was very great. This was one of my Groupon meals as well and he was very great about it.

2804755,2016-09-04,0,07AZL5XenCQ_-op_onKLdw,"Wanted to do something nice with Boyfriend for my birthday dinner, so we decided we would try our very first official fancy pants American Steakhouse.  We were staying at Flamingo and didn't want to travel far, so this worked.  We called in the morning, they mentioned they were pretty open, but made reservations for 8pm anyway.  

The decor was more modern than I thought it would be, and brighter than I thought.  And the tables were slightly close together--we could perfectly hear our neighbor's conversations, and noticed every time they stared our direction.  A little more privacy would've been nice.  We eventually were also neighbored next to a boisterous bachelor party, but, whatever, it's Vegas.  

After trying to get some insider info from our server, Leon, (see below) we decided on starting with raw oysters and we each ordered the 22oz bone in ribeye with a side each of Mac and cheese and truffle mashed potatoes.  We also ordered a dirty martini and a glass of Riesling. We were pleasantly surprised at the beautiful popovers we had and the amuse bouche  (a lovely, light duck pate with croutons) was so so good.

All the food was tasty, and cooked to perfection.  I ordered my steak 'black and blue' and it was exactly that.  The herbed butter on top was heavenly, and I would've loved more of it.  The steak itself was tender, with good flavor, nice marbling, thick cut, lovely crust... And the truffle mash was the highlight of our night.  

For dessert we ordered the strawberry rhubarb cheesecake, and they stuck a candle in it for my birthday.  They also brought out two bonus brownie bits, that were standard. Boyfriend loved the cheesecake. 

Our server, Leon, was perfectly nice and tried his best to be accommodating.  A couple of things-- we had mentioned this was our first steakhouse and asked some questions about the meat and he gave me a recommendation based on my tastes.  I also asked about the sides, and such...He gave me text-book information about the items, but honestly I just wanted a ""go with [this item], it's seriously the bomb"" or ""you really don't want to miss out on this"".  I left feeling I should've tried other things instead of what I ordered.  He went above and beyond when he brought me a taste of the wine I was thinking of ordering (and thank goodness he did, I hated the wine) and asked the kitchen if they could allow us to order just half a dozen of raw little neck clams (they were running low so the kitchen said no, we'd have to order the whole seafood tower) and thanked us for coming in.  But service all in all was very very slow.  Lulls in the meal were long and plentiful.  The whole meal was pushing 2 hours, and it was definitely mostly waiting time.  

On the whole, the place is good, the food is worth a visit, but I'm not sure I'd come back.  Having to spend that much on a meal ($250 tax and tip included), I expected at tad bit more, but was a little disappointed.",lvLg3Ys6yjversrHA5rB3Q,0,0,4,5XtzA9AGXdSkWDfZjYFDPA
2807782,2016-04-12,0,07AZL5XenCQ_-op_onKLdw,"Las Vegas.  Is there anyplace with a higher concentration of first class steakhouses?  Well, yeah, actually there is - Buenos Aires.  But that's so far to go, and why bother when for only about half the price of a ticket to Argentina you can go to BLT Steak?  (Okay, that's a slight exaggeration, but BLT Steak is kind of pricey.)  

Looking back over my Yelp reviews, I notice that my five-star ratings tend to go to places that serve a great steak.  I didn't plan it that way.  I guess I just love a great steak.  Well, BLT has them.  My bone in rib eye was fabulous, and my wife loved her filet.  My rib eye came with bone marrow on the side and I ordered a delicious Bearnaise from their selection of sauces to go with it.  Our side of potato skins was more than enough for two, and perfectly prepared.  I started with the Bay Scallops ""Rockefeller"" - a creative idea that was well executed.  My wife started with a wedge salad - a mundane idea that was also well executed.

I think attention to detail matters, and at BLT it was apparent immediately in the complimentary amuse bouche (a pâté) and the delicious popovers.  The bread plate is one of those little things that allows a restaurant to distinguish itself, and those popovers were certainly a creative way to do just that.  And they thoughtfully provided us with the recipe on a little card.

The room is warm and inviting, with soft lights and tables well-spaced for quiet conversation.  The bar had a big screen TV, visible from the dining room, which was a bit jarring, but I suppose you just can't get away from the screen these days.  Other than that, the ambiance was very nice.

The service was friendly and attentive.  Our server, Mario, was helpful on our questions and very quick with anything we requested.

One quibble - the drinks were a bit overpriced and not overly generous.  But, c'est la vie.  This is not a place to go if you're pinching pennies anyway.

Oh yeah, and by the way, sorry New York and Chicago but no - you don't have a higher concentration of great steakhouses.  I know you think you do but, as they say, ""Vegas, baby!""",ZmKGF8ZZUo16g2ISrz4ahw,0,0,5,Vny9Q3uSsuQKez7pQSP41w

The carrots were undercooked, truffle potatoes were runny and I had requested Horseradish Sauce which came out half way there the meal.

We had the French onion soup, wonderful and cheesy.

I was drinking an ice tea, annwaiter started again with more disrespect. I guess once wasn't enough. I then said politely "" we don't deserve your conversation"" he again could stop himself when my phone rang at the table. I quickly turn off ringer because I'm not one to talk with guests at the dinner table. Because I had to tell him if he made on more rude assalting comment I would shove this dinner up his ass, I couldn't see eating it because I felt he would have spit in it(or something)

It's ayce lobster, crabs, caviar, and other goodies!! We made reservations in advance, and Jamie (hostess) was sooo nice and sweet Since we were a large party, she put us in a private room. The service at BLT is excellent!!
So this place is not your typical buffet, they are all about quality not quantity. They have ayce lobster tails, king crab legs, stone crab legs, fresh-shucked oysters, prime rib, rack of lamb, filet mignon, sushi, omelette bar, and so on. They also have a separate menu you can order from (that's where the unlimited American Sturgeon Caviar is), which is still part of the brunch. Unlimited pours of Perrier-Jouët Champagne, mimosas, and bloody mary's!! Oh and my fave Gruyere cheese-flavored popovers from BLT Steakhouse!! I would sooo recommend this place, it is pricey but so worth every penny. If you have a ""total rewards"" card you get $5.00 each person.

We ordered potato skins and a soufflé crepe in passion fruit sauce.  At least 10 flavorful potato skins arrived.  The crepe was to die for decadent--possibly the best food I ate all week while there!  That alone would make me want to return!

She brought over complimentary popovers, their huge signature gruyere-laced Yorkshire pudding type things.  We found them to be too crusty (almost burned) on the outsde but we enjoyed picking out the cheesy-flaky innards.  and free was a nice touch.  It was a trendy place to hang out--and not too loud, we could converse.

The good news, the steak was cooked great, we had a bone-in rib eye with the bone marrow (which didn't really taste like anything). The main course didn't seem to be the ""bell of the ball"" it was more of the side dish compared to the Chef's specials that came out as appetizers. The duck liver was good and the pop-overs were great! The truffle mash was extremly salty and the mushrooms were salty and looked like a pile of mush. Anyways, we probably won't be back as we frequent las vegas.

2970651,2014-08-09,10,07AZL5XenCQ_-op_onKLdw,"I don't normally use profanity in my reviews, but ""Jiminy Jillikers Batman!"", that was an amazing meal! Hopefully the Yelp higher-ups don't see that and everything will be gravy baby! 

BLT Steak really blew me away during my visit. The ambiance is amazing considering this restaurant is located in the back area of Bally's Casino. I was surprised to see that BLT has an open concept location. I thought the slot machines and general white noise of the casino would bleed into the restaurant, but once you walk-in casual conversations and soft music is all you pretty much hear. 

The service was impeccable from the first glass of wine that was poured to the end of the dessert menu. Every time a food order was served it came with a brief explanation on how it was prepared and what exactly was on your plate from left to right. After each course, plates were promptly taken away and glasses were refilled, the table was cleaned, new silverware was placed down, and I was ready for the next foodie exploration. 

The food at BLT is amazing!  I didn't necessarily love everything I ate, but still respected the time and craftsmanship that went into it. For example, we were given a Duck Liver Mousse in a small mason jar with a sealed lid along with some sliced and toasted whole grain bread. This was compliments of the Chef and although the presentation was beautiful, this wasn't my favorite. Guess I'm not the ""Duck Liver Mousse"" type of guy. I also tried cheese and bacon crostinis with a sliced meat plate which consisted of sliced Chorizo, Sopressata and few other cured meats, I can't recall their names, but these were absolutely amazing. Great way to get my palate and tummy ready for business.

After the appetizers the main course arrived...Braised Short Ribs, Truffle Mashed Potatoes and grilled White Asparagus. This was a sexy looking meal, literally food porn right in front of my eyes; I felt naughty. The Braised Short Ribs came to the table in a cast iron cauldron and it was still simmering in it's own juices. These savory juices added an aroma to the table that made my dinner mates increasing jealous with every waft. I dug into this large portion of short ribs and was amazed at how easy they slid off the bone. I took my first bite and I swear the meat was dissolving before I even began to chew. To describe these as tender would be an understatement; buttery, smooth and delicious would be a good start. Then I got crazy and added the Truffle Mashed Potatoes to each bite of short ribs. I think I went into a full food orgasmic episode. I couldn't stop.  Every bite made me more and more excited. If you're not getting it, this meal was f**king amazing!

As I slowly started to come out of my food induced wet dream. I sat there and couldn't stop thinking about the meal that was presented to me. Holy smokes there's no possible way to fit any more food in me...""Would you like to see the dessert menu?"" our serve inquired. ""Yes, that would great!"", I exclaimed. I won't get into these sweet creamy details because my I might make a mess all over again. I'll just say, ""Banana Cream Pie"". Oh Yeah. 

This place is a must try whether you're a tourist or a local. Bring your father-in-law here and maybe he'll finally call you a man, and shake your hand.",i_DR3vdE73nVm2GlMbGpGA,12,7,5,vAreznDDTd6a1edIFkcnyg

3038949,2015-07-11,1,07AZL5XenCQ_-op_onKLdw,"Prior to my last visit to Vegas, I solicited my fellow Seattle Yelpers for dining advice - specifically, where to go for steaks. I was dissuaded from dining at this restaurant, and other places were recommended instead. However, I saw a Groupon deal for BLT and we didn't want to blow our whole budget on one meal during our visit, so I decided to give this place a try.

And we were SO glad we did!

From beginning to end, our experience here was A-1. The service was fabulous, our food was fabulous, the ambiance was lovely, and everything was great. As others have mentioned, the complementary appetizers were incredible: toast rounds with duck pate (I didn't have this but my hubby said it was divine), and we both swooned - SWOONED! - over the large, warm, soft gruyere popovers! OMG, these were the best ""breads"" we had ever had in our lives. We talked about it for days afterwards. (What a nice touch, too, to include the recipe for them! Like, in a million years, I could ever replicate these wonders...but still! Nice thought!). 

I had the tuna tartare and a side of asparagus. Both dishes were super. The asparagus' stalks were peeled so they appeared to be albino spears, and they were cooked and seasoned to absolute perfection. Hubby had a ribeye steak and I had a bit of it and omg it melted in my mouth. Medium rare and cooked to perfection and tender and moist and oh so flavorful. One of the best steaks I have ever had. (I forget what sides he had. We were so rapt with the steak). 

Too full for dessert but they brought us out some complimentary brownie bites. I had asked for some Earl Grey tea and they brought me out a tea cup and hot water and the ""sides"" of sugars and Splendas, but when the server came with the tea caddy, they didn't have Earl Grey! In fact, the selection of teas was quite limited. I was surprised they brought me all the tea fixin's when they didn't have the specific tea I had ordered. I politely refused any others (I only wanted my Earl Grey). This was the only ""issue"" with the whole meal - and it is a petty one at that. 

Even if we hadn't had the Groupon, we gladly would have paid full price for our meal. It was that good. Better than good. It was great!",NDhDMKqSiBc0L06jKlFnmg,2,3,5,VcemmcRXzZ2ZwY1skesFdg

Starting the meal, the complimentary popover was so fluffy delicious and salt and butter added that extra element. For my entree, I ordered the branzino and mac and cheese. The Branzino was perhaps the most delicious fish I've had at a restaurant with it being perfectly seasoned and deliciously crispy skin. Mac and cheese was good but, if there was a fault, I'd say it needed more bread crumbs on top. I wasnt able to finish the mac and cheese because of how filling it was (you could enjoy one order for 2+ people).

Service at the bar was wonderful. The bartender told me I was at the end of happy hour, half price drinks including wine, so I ordered a glass of wine. Bartender asked if I liked the glass and said he'd be more than happy to add another drink at happy hour price for me to enjoy later (since I was still, barely, in the HH window). There were several people working there and checking on me.

3075484,2015-10-15,2,07AZL5XenCQ_-op_onKLdw,"It's all about the sear. And BLT has done it to perfection. The rib eye is a 22 oz monster and is seared to perfection on all sides, leaving a soft, tender, and juicy core. Be warned - it is enormous, so save some space in your belly. Hold off on the tempting popover they serve you with butter and sea salt. Yes it is delicious but space consuming in your stomach.

Your steak deserves all the attention you can provide. Don't bother with the sauces - they provide you with a bone marrow and roasted garlic. It's all the flavor you need. Scoop some of that gooey heaven from the bone core and smear it on your steak. Or dredge your steak piece in the buttery pan they serve it in that is coated with bone marrow/garlic goodness. Perfection.

Don't make the mistake I did. Start eating from the bone - in. It's the most tender and flavorful. Because once you get to eating around 75% your belly will reach its max. Don't leave the best part on your plate.

Steak and red wine is all you need. Time to get behind the felt now - and throw some dice!",2stfGTDaZuqg0B7vUZ39_g,7,3,5,mNnyx9uljXW96Bf4uycVFw

Only reason it wasn't a 5 was because the server dropped the ball a bit at the end. We had coffee for dessert, he took our order, but forgot it.

The service seemed a little slow, otherwise I would have given five stars. I ordered a cocktail, the bees knees to begin. It was gin, lemon, honey, and egg whites for texture. It was delicious but took probably 10 minutes to come out, and the restaurant had maybe seven tables seated.
The staff was very accommodating as the first table we were seated at was next to a party of four very loud, and raunchy people. Seriously - the conversations they were screaming for all the restaurant to hear made me very uncomfortable. I couldn't even talk to my fiancé across the small table without yelling! The waitstaff reseated us in a different room, were extremely polite and understanding, we were very thankful for that. 
They brought out a complementary duck liver mousse with crostinis, it was to die for. Very creamy, a nice way to start the meal. They also brought out two popovers that were moist and fluffy. You could taste the egg and I devoured mine. They also attached a tag with recipe and instructions on how to make them at home. (Nice touch) 
I ordered the filet mignon, medium rare, with stuffed mushrooms as a side. I ordered a Cabernet to drink. My fiancé ordered the New York strip steak, medium rare, with a baked potato. 
My steak was perfectly cooked, the spices in the crust perfectly complimented the flavors of the filet. It was melt in your mouth delicious. The little stuffed mushrooms were tasty as well but I was so full I only ate two.

The popovers were, expectedly, warm, buttery and delicious. What we did not expect were the additional duck liver raspberry pate, mini-pizza slices and assorted meat plates that the chef sent over simply by being a Diamond Rewards card member. Good thing we forgot to order the Tuna Tartare that we had our eye on!

The 28 day-aged Ribeye did it disappoint. Perfectly marbled with gooey fat and lightly charred to make the spices dance in your mouth. It was a good thing we decided to taste the Short Ribs after the ribeye because, seriously, this dish is the star of the night. Melt in your mouth, fork tender, buttery ... Oh la la. Our server, David, was on the money when he said the short ribs were probably the best thing on the menu. I would visit BLT Steak again for this dish alone.

With no more room left for dessert, we were again pleasantly surprised when the chef sent over another two complimentary plates: peanut butter jelly and passion fruit pops + brownie bites. A fantastic end to a delightful culinary inclined night.",9d45b2HFZUTffGP3MwzNyQ,1,0,5,OWIeKXww6ac4hcj1t7YsLw

3433586,2014-09-03,0,07AZL5XenCQ_-op_onKLdw,"I have to say that this place was absolutely phenomenal! I would go back there in a heartbeat. I'm posting this a little late; my husband and I went there for dinner about 1 month ago at the end of July. This was our honeymoon and I am so happy that we got to experience this restaurant.

Firstly, the hostess was very very sweet and asked us if we were celebrating anything special. I said that it was our honeymoon and they treated us like gold. They seem to be very nice accommodating and customer friendly anyway so I have no doubt that they would have true that's just the same had it not been a special occasion.  The restaurant was very clean and decorated in a very modern and contemporary atmosphere. Our waiter was fabulous, explaining everything on the menu, going over all of the specials in cocktails explaining everything in detail. He was wonderful! 

Everything we ordered was awesome. To start, we got complimentary duck pate, which I've never had before but it was really good! After this course, they provided complimentary cheese popovers, which were again amazing. They also provided small recipe cards so you can make the pop overs at home if you wish. I thought this was a very nice touch and very classy. My husband and I shared the Porterhouse  for two, got a few sides, and also three dipping sauces to try. Again everything was delicious!  We picked everything clean!  Additionally, the cocktails were very good. My only criticism is that each cocktail was $14 each which, I know is Vegas, but still, a little expensive.  Naturally, we had to splurge on dessert and we weren't disappointed. So rich and delicious, each I believe were only $10, which seemed like a steal compared to everything else, haha. 

Howeve, my favorite part throughout the whole experience was watching the staff members throughout the evening. There seem to be multiple managers walking around, checking on customers, in addition to the incredibly efficient wait staff. I was very impressed that multiple folks came by to ask us how our meal was, how experience was, and knew that it was our honeymoon and congratulated us.  It made us feel really special and made the experience very personalized.  They also gave us a complimentary dessert which were too small chocolate bites because they knew it was our honeymoon and my husband's birthday was the day before. It was cute, small, and had a lit candle in it which was very nice.

We absolutely loved it and I wish that there was one near off in Boston! It would probably make us go broke!",GMhCq90wV2zlidFfIduTOA,1,0,5,EBr7PrCSb9Fv9GSZb_4YeQ
3449195,2017-04-17,2,07AZL5XenCQ_-op_onKLdw,"My boyfriend and I have been here many times and this is our favorite steakhouse in Vegas. We try to eat here everytime we go to Vegas if possible. 

Most recently, we went to Vegas to celebrate our anniversary and of course, this was the place to go. The prices are on par with other steakhouses, however, for the sides, they ARE small portions, so the sides are much more expensive than other places... but we rarely finish everything because they give you quite a few things in between. 

For those who like to saw a few bucks. They usually offer a Travel Zoo deal. That is how we initially discovered this place and we've been coming back since. The Travel Zoo is an amazing deal! You get over $200 worth of food for only $100... but my boyfriend and I always go crazy and we typically end up about $100 over... but it's all worth it! Don't be afraid to buy the Travel Zoo deal. It says 2 drinks, 2 apps, 2 entrees, etc for the deal. However, in reality, you can order whatever you want. They will just take off the value of the voucher at the end of the meal. 

We usually go for the bone in ribeye because it's sooo delicious! It's a huge cut and I personally never finish it! It's actually big enough to share, but my boyfriend loves the food here so much that he said that although we should share... he doesn't want to because he wants leftovers to eat again! 

It's $60 for a giant cut of bone in ribeye and it's cooked perfectly to your liking. It also comes with bone marrow. Other cuts vary in price, but the most expensive is waygu for $90+. This time, we each ordered a ribeye, plus we ordered a 2lb lobster to share. We ordered the lobster tail before to add to the steak, but a 2 lbs whole main lobster is a better deal! It was delicious, tasty, and big! They crack the meat from the claw so everything is super easy to eat. It came with a cognac sauce. For our sides, we ordered the creamed spinach and mac n cheese. Usually we order creamed spinach and truffle mashed potatoes, but we wanted to try a little something different. All the sides are good though. However, out of those, I would say the truffle mashed potatoes were my favorite. We did also try a side of their special menu, the pork belly with grits. I would have to say that I was disappointed with this... the grits were good, and I'm not a fan of grits. They were shaped and fried into triangular blocks and deep fried. That took it to another level and with the tomato sauce and pieces on top, it was delicious! I ordered this dish for the pork belly. That's what sold me... however, there was only 3 tiny and I mean tiny pieces of pork belly on it!! This dish just was not worth it unfortunately. For dessert, we went with the banana cream pie to share. It was a big slice! It was not overly sweet and I really loved the pecan nut crust. I loved the crunch it added to the dish! The pie was very refreshing and seemed to clean out our palate well after our meal. Every time we have been here, they give you duck liver pate to start. I always look forward to that because it's so light and delicious!! You get a handful of crispy bread to spread it on. It's a great way to start the meal. Next comes the popovers, which is one of their specialties. You MUST try it, break it open, spread on some butter, and sprinkle a little bit of the salt they give you! It's heavenly!! I have to stop myself from eating them all before the meal comes out because they are that good!! To end your meal, they also give you some small dessert bites. We were given little brownie bits. They were soft and chewy. A perfect addition to out banana cream pie!! Since we were celebrating our anniversary this time, they also gave us 2 glasses of champagne on the house to celebrate!

We love this steakhouse not only for the food, but also for the excellent service!! It has also been consistently good and the waiter really talks and jokes around with you. We have always had 5 star service here from start to finish each time. To find this place, walk towards the back of Bally's. It's past the Buca De Bupo and SEA. You do not hear any of the distractions of the slot machines and the ambiance is relaxing.

Husband had the veal chop which was a little bit of heaven!  We ordered the green beans and truffle mashed potatoes.  The potatoes were so light, creamy and truffles were so rich it was almost a sauce.

My friends and I were on a group birthday trip for all of us and decided to treat ourselves to an awesome meal. Based on reviews we thought this restaurant would be great. We were wrong. We expected to pay high prices and that everything would be a la cart. What we did not expect is that the quality of the food would be so low. I got a moscow mule to drink and it was horrible. Not made the correct way at all, you couldn't taste any ginger beer it tasted like sprite. When we ordered I got filet Mignon, medium rare. My friend got the braised short ribs, and my other friend got the rib eye There aren't many choices on the menu and all of the cuts of meat are huge. 
My steak was cooked OK, but the center was cold, and it lacked seasoning. The short ribs were mostly fat. My friend was digging to find actual meat. Her plate was filled with grease when she was done. And she probably got about a cup and a half worth of meat in total. The rib eye was cooked OK, but lacked flavor. All of the meat lacked flavor honestly. Ruth Chris costs less and tastes better. Needless to say we were dissapointed. Our waiter didn't even ask us once how our meal was, or if we were doing OK so we could complain to him (ours had an eye patch). I would NEVER return here or recommend it to ANYONE.

When we seated we were greeted by our waitress, Roxanne and another guy brought us some water. We ordered two glasses of wine and then we placed our appetizers order, a crab cake and a steak tartare. Right after we ordered, we were served a small plate with some bread. After I tasted I have to say that the bread was amazing, one of the best bread I've ever had in my life. It was baked with fresh gruyere cheese. Our appetizers were also delicious and very well presented. As entrees we ordered Sautéed Scottish Salmon and Grilled Ahi Tuna. Both dishes were cooked to perfection and very flavorful. For the salmon we choose a side of grilled asparagus and for the tuna we choose a side of stuffed mushrooms who were amazing. At the end we didn't have room for dessert but I'm sure their dessert choice was great too. Our waitress was very attentive and professional.

That said, I was thoroughly delighted by my experience at BLT. Our server, Hugo was clearly a fine dining veteran. His attentiveness, knowledge of the menu and affable demeanor was first rate. The manager, Casey, checked on us several times and we wanted for nothing throughout our meal.

As for the meal itself, we enjoyed warm cheese popovers, oysters on the half shell, a well-executed tuna poke and charcuterie. My medium-rare porterhouse steak was seared, broiled and properly rested. Dessert was decent, but I didn't consider it to be on par with the rest of the excellent meal. Nevertheless, I was thoroughly sated at that point.

Everyone was gushing over their meals. We ordered food writer, tuna tartare, and meet tartare and bacon for our appetizers. They were all perfect. They also brought us complementary bread popovers that are buttery and delicious. We each ordered different steaks and they were cooked
To perfection. One party ordered the Branzino but changed her mind and they replaced it immediately with her second choice which was a lobster salad which she loved. Portions are HUGE.

We literally was there for 2 hours. The steak takes at least 40 to 45 minutes which I understand was part of the wait. We waited for our  menu and our server, had to ask for refill of our water. We hardly saw our server except for when he took our order and brought our food.  He was quick getting me ketchup when asked though but overall service was horrible. 

We got the NY steak - medium well, which was salty.  Got two filet mignon - medium well but it came medium rare and well done.  The steak wasn't bad and was really great and tasted amazing even though it wasn't cooked the way we preferred it. The salmon was cooked just right and it was good. Recommend that. Our side items consists of French fries and came with a mayo type sauce which we didn't prefer, just asked the server for ketchup; the French fries weren't that great either, it tasted like the oil they cooked it in and the it'll needed to be changed. We also got the stuff mushroom, didn't prefer that either. We also got the Mac and cheese which I recommend, very cheesy and got a little crunch to it and also the truffle mashed was very good and recommend!

We both got the Filet with truffled mash and Brussel sprouts, all of which were amazing. Our servers were very friendly and attentive which added to the experience. It was the perfect mix between casual and dressy. I would definitely recommend this to anyone not looking to pay crazy amounts for a good steak.",r78ZyPUuPCO-SOhsvq382g,0,0,5,_cENACE1uQ06XSqF-MmBnQ
3581874,2017-02-20,2,07AZL5XenCQ_-op_onKLdw,"After attending a Yelp Elite event here last year, I have been craving BLT's incredible popovers ever since! They are the way to my heart! 

We checked in promptly for our reservation and were seated a few minutes later. I will have to say before I venture on to what we ordered and ate that the service here was really poor. We were inside the restaurant close to three hours because we were constantly waiting on our server. 

After being seated, we were served with waters and menus. We waited about ten minutes to put in a drink order and receive those delicious popovers. These things are what other bread baskets look up to. Big, warm, crusty, cheesy buns served with softened butter and an overly large sea salt canister that means business. 

Once these beauties arrived, we waited another ten minutes for our drinks. When they were delivered we asked our server to please take our order not knowing when we would see him again. 

We ordered the tuna tartare, the wedge salad, the filet mignon, bone-in rib eye, Brussels sprouts, loaded baked potato and banana cream pie. 

The tuna tartare was incredible. Served up with a soy lime dressing on fresh avocado and a side of potato chips, this dish is the perfect combination of sweet and tangy. I loved the unusual side of chips to eat this dish with. The tuna was fresh and the portion was just right. 

The wedge was also delicious, with a nice creamy blue cheese dressing, huge pieces of salty bacon and tasty tomatoes on a large portion of crisp lettuce. 

Our steaks were both cooked perfectly with a nice char on each and herb butter that doesn't make you wonder where the additional sauce is. You can order sauces of course, but we didn't as the purists that we are. Both steaks were seasoned well with salt and pepper and an even temperature all the way through. 

Our sides were sub par. I thought the Brussels sprouts were overly sweet and needed a little more cooking, the loaded potato was like any other and nothing made it stand out to me. 

The banana cream pie was not your typical and one of their most popular dishes. The crust is filled with walnuts and cinnamon, large slices of banana with a cream filling and homemade whip cream and caramel sauce! It was a nice way to end your meal without overly indulging on something really heavy. 

Back to our service, our plates and waters were never cleared or filled in a timely manner. Our appetizer dirty dishes sat there until our main course arrived. Our main dirty dishes sat there for thirty minutes once we were done. At one point a manger noticed and came over and cleared them for us. During the time we waited, we watched our server pass us several times and not come over. We finally flagged him down asking for our check because we had been sitting there so long without being noticed or helped. 

I know they were busy, but I hope that doesn't mean their service is always lacking. I love the food here but I can't spend three hours at a restaurant when a meal should take about half that. 

Needless to say, those popovers might have me coming back and grabbing a seat at their bar.",_8y-kAoK4BQ_MmzawRpQFw,4,3,3,GHczMSJ0IP92_Nj1w5eXEg

We arrived slightly early for our dinner reservation and were offered to wait in their little lounge area. After being seated we were quickly greeted by our waiter who was very friendly.

Before dinner they provided some bread with duck pate, which wasn't really my cup of tea. They also gave us two huge and very delicious  pop overs. I have always wanted to try pop overs so this was an awesome chance to do so. They even give you the recipe which is neat.

I hate to say it but I found the decor extremely plain with nothing really to admire. The music was also very bland. I know you are supposed to be there for the food but good music and beautiful design really add to a dining experience.

The steak was everything you would want in a steak. A nice little char on the outside, melts in your mouth and packed full of flavor. The side dishes are a bit on the smaller side but the steaks are so big that it's not like you won't get full. I also loved how all the toppings for the baked potato were separate and were a great amount. I always find myself having to ask for extra toppings while this time I did not.

This was definitely a wonderful way to celebrate our anniversary. I was slightly disappointed they didn't offer a little something for our celebration but we still enjoyed ourselves.",Km4XbIpy0_eDPaXnygfHcQ,2,1,4,HJkzPcYPnBNUNyJHg6jLwA

For the high price they charge we got small portions where the oysters were the size of a half dollar with barely any meat and the so called jumbo shrimp was medium size that was literally the same size as the lobster and the king crab leg was so skinny it looked like it was from somebodies leftovers (See photos).
The popover bread that came out was huge which gave me the  impression that the entree and sides will be the same. I ordered the veal chop, while the wife had the main lobster, the kids shared the braised short ribs and our friend had a steak. The waiter told us that the sides were big enough to share so we ordered mash potatoes, asparagus and wild mushrooms. When the food came out the veal chop and braised rib looked and tasted good but the lobster again was tiny along with the sides.

Service was above average but did not stand out. 

Ordered their signature cocktail, the BLT, and thought it was pretty good. For food I only ordered the bone-in ribeye. 

Before the steak came I was served ""the popper"" (bread) which I didn't try, however being a diamond member, I was also served the duck pâté, cheese bread, and charcuterie.

The duck pâté with bread was unbelievable and very bold and strong. The cheesebread was light and good as well, very good contrast to the bread and duck pâté. The charcuterie was as expected and didn't stand out.

For the main course I ordered the ribeye medium, but was given to me medium rare, so I sent it back to be cooked to order. I have to say the steak was over charred which someone else posted about ina previous review. The steak wasn't melt in your mouth as I would've expected being a USDA prime steak. It was a good steak, but the fat and the flavor (I had no sauce) was nothing to comment about. The bone marrow added flavor to the steak, however I could not comment about the butter which was melted and gone since I sent the steak back.

Overall, for being a restaurant known for its steak, it was nothing to rave about. I'd say I most likely won't be back to spend $65 on a ribeye steak   that I thought was average at best.",uaYX8_MzGaEl2q31ybX35Q,1,0,3,PkPZNxNJ0AbHO9q1pxW5WA

3987982,2016-06-12,0,07AZL5XenCQ_-op_onKLdw,"The week prior to going to Vegas I saw Travelzoo had a special for BLT steak.  $115...on the travelzoo it did say it had a bunch conditions to choose from like 2 appetizers,2 entrees, dessert with an up to value on each that totaled up to $208  I normally find those to be annoying but since I have been to BLT  restaurants, I found it to be a good value.  I was happy when I arrived to find out those conditions were thrown out and it was straight credit of $208. 

The wife had a large and meaty crab cake for an appetizer and I had the tuna tartae, tuna and avocado were fresh. A complimentary appetizer of duck pate with a jam (or jelly) was a welcome treat as well. Entree wise she had the branzino and I had the filet (medium) and an add-on of crab. She really enjoyed her branzino. My steak was cooked perfectly. 
Sides were hen of the woods mushrooms (this is a must order for me at any BLT with it on the menu) and  fingerling potatoes which were excellent. 

SIDENOTE: There is something about BLT that I just love their filet. I had ny strip one time that I did not really enjoy so I have stuck with Filet since then.

Wait staff was very friendly and provided great service. Any recommendations or explanation of an item she provided with great knowledge.

We had quite a few cocktails unfortunately I don't remember the name but mine had tequila and mezcal.

Personal Pet Peeve: This is why it 4 star and not 5.  I know this occurs at steakhouses often but I still don't like getting charged for steak sauces. It just seems like a nickel & dime type of thing when you are spending $100 a person imo.

At the end of the day our bill came to about $265 after tax & 20% tip.",EJkxVUSVxJ246ByENQ3_Ig,2,0,4,WbQWu2wZzBwgpzT3byrWeQ

I had one cocktail with dinner and that was delicious! It was a spicy margarita. Only a small kick to it but tasted fresh as hell! 
My steak came out sizzling and at the perfect temperature, medium. We got a couple sides, veggies and truffle mashed potatoes. Those potatoes were something else. All this awesome truffle flavor. Seriously you have to try them! My absolute favorite part of the meal is always dessert, because I always have room for dessert. LOL. I have to recommend trying the soufflé crepe.

My husband and I don't eat a ton of salt any more and this way beyond the normal savoriness of a steak. My co-worker however, did really enjoy his steak.

The onion rings were good but under seasoned (basically no seasoning). The burger was cooked to the right temp (med rate) but again lacked seasoning, and the protein while having a great texture was over whelmed by the bread, onion lettuce, etc. The bacon wasn't crisp and went entirely unnoticed until a piece fell out. The burger basically disintegrated due the juiciness of the burger and moisture of the veg. I ended up eating it with a fork, but didn't finish either.

4117478,2015-09-04,0,07AZL5XenCQ_-op_onKLdw,"This was just an ok experience. For the money, it was a disappointment and should have been much better.
We gave out group of 6, 2 hours and 15 minutes to dine before we had to see a show. The restaurant was less than half full when we arrived and we were seated promptly. Everything started nice and our server made some suggestions on food and drinks.
Our wine was excellent and everyone enjoyed their drinks. We started with the crab cake appetizer. It was very mussy and not crisp on the outside like it should have been. As soon as you touched it, it fell apart. Not the end of the world, but was hoping for better. The pop overs they serve are perfect.
Wedge salad: Average at best with very little dressing or blue cheese. I don't like a lot of dressing on my salad, but this was about a tablespoon for a fairly large salad. Average.
Still at this point while we were not wow'd, it wasn't terrible. This is where things stopped. Our server stopped coming over and we noticed several other tables had their dinners. It got to the point that we had to flag down a waiter and ask to have someone talk to us. A manager finally came over and we asked what happened to our food. He apologized and said he would check on it. By the time it came, we were now in a hurry to finish eating and go right to the show (luckily in the same hotel). When they brought our food they indicated it was our fault since one of our diners had requested a well done filet. I would never eat a steak this way, but I have reluctantly cooked them this way for friends. I do the same as BLT, butterfly them. They said it takes them 40-45 minutes to cook a 10 oz. butterflied filet. Really, in a 1500 degree oven you brag about? I guess I need to show them how to cook a steak.
The steaks were all perfect once we finally got them. Tried a filet and rib-eye (both medium rare) and no complaints what so ever. The meat was 5 star.
The manager offered to buy us desert on him, but at this point we just had time to run to the show. When we are spending over $100 per person for a meal, I expect something special. This was not any where near what I have experienced at similar restaurants.",FndPbo-G6XQzdpjmpjXotg,0,0,3,FaaAL97Y7uQKF_I57F_YQw
4120993,2017-07-31,6,07AZL5XenCQ_-op_onKLdw,"We are in Las Vegas for a convention this week, and it's a rare moment that we get to dine sans our amazing but boisterous kiddos, so chose BLT Steak after reading the great reviews. The hostess seating us was very nice. But our waiter Omar was another story. Note to restaurant: don't offer a Travelzoo coupon if your staff is going to treat us like garbage when we use them!!

We didn't know that we had to tell the hostess about the travelzoo so when we told our waiter before we even ordered, he immediately changed his tone. Then he lectured us about how we had to tell the hostess. While you can use it for anything you want, there are a few exceptions. Unfortunately wagyu is also not allowed which was one of the reasons why we chose to eat here. Oh well - but that's not the reason for the bad review.

As the waiter proceeded to take our order, he did ask if we had an allergy. We said no, but we have very strong preferences and dislikes, so please let us know if there are any strong flavors in food like wasabi, horseradish, onions, curry, etc. We then ordered two appetizers: the Tuna Tarter and the Steak Tarter - and asked if there was anything like that in them - he said no. Well, of course the Steak Tarter was swimming in a brown sauce suspension I asked him what it was and he said ""traditional garnishes"". I pressed further and he said ""mustard"". So apparently us listing every strong spicy flavor known to man didn't clue him in that he should have told us about mustard that wasn't listed as a flavor on the menu. Had to send that back, but the Tuna Tarter was excellent.

We also has amuse bouche of liver pate with some kind of gel with 2 small pieces of toast. Not great. Textures of runny pate with gel made it taste like snot. Don't really like starting off with that profile. Then popovers (which usually are my fav) were overcooked to a crisp and really dense inside. First time I didn't finish a popover.

Then came the entrees. We ordered a filet mignon and bone in ribeye. Both were good, but the ribeye was too lean and didn't have a cap on it. It was somehow trimmed to just the eye. Never had that issue at a steakhouse before. It did come with a small piece of marrow and garlic - which helped. Filet was good though.

Side dishes were comically small for $12 each. They are not sharing sides. We ordered the truffled mashed and seasonal special cauliflower. Cauliflower was disappointing. Just tastes like the ones I bake in an oven - there was no brown butter or lemon zest as described.

We then ordered the peanut butter chocolate mousse - which is not a mousse. It was so dense and hard that I almost needed a knife to cut through it. The bowl of sorbet was like they emptied an entire container into a bowl. Just really odd. Could have done with 1/2 the amount at 1/2 the price.

Drinks we had two mojitos and one wine spritzer. Asked for fruit in the spritzer but the bar doesn't have any - just garnishes like limes, orange slices, cherries. Odd, but okay.

But the real issue we had was service. The waiter never checked on us. I had an empty glass of water for over an hour. He was just literally throwing food on our table and walking away with no explanation of what anything is. No asking if the food was fine. At one point, he stepped on my foot when putting food down and didn't even apologize. I understand that maybe people don't tip right on a coupon or voucher, but we weren't those people. And to treat us like garbage was a really bad way to earn a tip. We did end up giving almost 15% tip because my husband doesn't really like giving less than that. But if it was up to me, it would have been a 0 - we've had better service at Denny's.

Another table near us also has a Travelzoo and that waiter was great to them. I wished we had him instead of Omar - who instead literally ruined our date night. I would not return to BLT Steak, and I do not recommend this restaurant until they train their staff properly.",8ogP7KWE-2SJ4VuNTTNPow,9,1,1,wKUH3v9lA04kHH2XbFZqPA

The GOOD:
The complimentary appetizers were good, toasted bread crisps with liver spread and their special bread popovers. The service and ambiance was wonderful. Romantically lit and not too loud. My cup was never empty that night and I drank a lot too. Staff were attentive.  

The BAD:
Each bite of my bone-in ribeye steak took me to salt city. Even the spare ribs were on the salty side. The steak was coarse as well, hard to chew. It wasn't dry but coarse/rubbery. Truffle mash potatoes was good but almost headed to salt city too. I was gagging by the end of my meal. When the manager came by to ask if the temperature of my steak was good, I said it was ok. but I also wanted to blow up and say wth I paid so much for this salty piece of steak. Idk if it was due to the butter on top or what but it was salty af. The bone marrow that came with it was good. 

2 stars for the good service and ambiance. I can eat a lot of almost anything, so I was surprised this expensive meal literally had me gagging.

4316480,2015-07-21,0,07AZL5XenCQ_-op_onKLdw,"Rib eye was great, the steak sauce was awful... one of the worse housemade steak sauces I've tasted.  Had this sweet tang to it... tasted like cheap bbq sauce.  Fortunately the steak had no need for steak sauce.  
Lobster was a bit on the mushy side but had good flavor.
The popovers were good but I dont understand this ""OMG best bread ever!"" claims.
The fries were very disappointing.  When you charge $10+ for sides they should be special and worthy of that price tag.  Envy's Parmesan truffle fries and Whiskey creamed corn come to mind immediately.  These fries were not special at all and I tasted stale cooking oil on them.  
The service was good but the waiter was overbearing with his push to get us to order drinks, appetizers, desserts.
Here is one such exchange we had:
Waitor: what would you like to drink?
Me: water is fine, thank you
Waitor: are you sure, we have some nice cocktails
Me: no thank you, Ive had enough alcohol already today
Waitor: well we also have some nice non-alchoholic drinks

The popovers were light and airy and a great change of pace to the run of the mill bread baskets you tend to see. I shared a salad with my dining companion after that and then it was the steaks. I had the 32 ounce porterhouse and they had the filet. The porterhouse was right up there with the best steaks I've ever had, tender, juicy and full of flavor. The filet was equally tender, but lacked a little of the flavor of the porterhouse and while that might be enough for some to bump it to 4 stars, the quality service coupled with one of the handful of best steaks I've ever had is enough for me to give 5 stars.",LwCLM9BjL3Z1L15gnp7MgA,1,0,5,r_wMtpua9tDTfdlH9i8jaw

We came for dinner last week for our early anniversary dinner.  It was recommended to us by our good friend.  

Pros:
The food was delicious & the steak I have ordered was on point!  Kudos to the Chief!  They did an amazing job!  
I can't praise enough about the servers, they were are all amazing.  From the beginning to the end.

Uncomfortable:
The restaurant manager came by our table to see if everything was ok.  I couldn't help but to stare at what was oblivious, her tatas!  Which was leaning over half of our table.  I felt so uncomfortable, and knowing that she asked a question waiting for a response.  My husband kind of stop what he was doing and just stared down.

I recommend the short ribs, plenty of meat that's braised in wine..yumm... and around $40 for the plate; sides are a la carte but, for example, one side of mashed potatoes is more than enough for two people, so if you're trying to keep it economical that's a good thing to remember.",cpz2a48-fkOrnogYU3B3qQ,0,0,5,ECBaL5oxfBQljikzTrLvXw

4419394,2015-12-31,2,07AZL5XenCQ_-op_onKLdw,"Excellent food and service.

We aren't usually fine diners (see other reviews) but once in a while you have to splurge.  I received an offer from Travelzoo and checked with the restaurant to verify which offer to get so that we could apply it to the following:
 22 oz USDA prime rib eye steak
 2 lb maine lobster
 sides of truffle mashed potatoes, creamed spinach, and mushrooms
2 glasses of wine, one riesling and one cabernet

Included the tastings of foie gras and popovers.  Everything was sublime.  Steak and lobster were both cooked properly and were served in the cast iron pans in which they presumably were cooked.

We were celebrating the Mrs. birthday and they surprised us with prosecco aperitifs on the house.

I'm sure the desserts are fabulous but we couldn't eat another bite after that orgy of decadence so we declined a dessert.  However our waitress did bring us 2 bites of brownie which were indeed something special.


Importantly, the staff seemed knowledgeable about the Travelzoo offer.  They have several offers and they told me which one to buy to ensure we could get the lobster.  Which I did.

Total for the above was about $230 including tax but not tip, and was way more rich food than we could deal with. I ate way more than is sensible, and we could easily have shared with another person or maybe two (although I don't think that would be within the constraints of the offer).  The eligible offer gave me $208 in credit for a pre-paid purchase price of $118 for 2 diners.  Not bad at all.  

The room is also really nice, comfortable, and elegant, without being stuffy or unnecessarily high-concept.  

In summary, this was an excellent restaurant that I would gladly eat at again without a coupon if I were in the market for a big splurge, which doesn't happen very often.  Or, if you are paying.",uFoLXDuKKbM6knOiQedVzw,5,1,5,EaYTiz4JDog6EjcLINAt1A

First, my friend had made a reservation and had arrived before me. When I got to the front desk and stated all of this, the 2 girls working ""couldn't find anything"" for about 5 min at which point I gave up and just walked into the restauran to find them on my own.

When I found my friends, they mentioned that they had ordered an appetizer already, but there were no drinks in sight. I was there about 10 min before the server, David, came by to take a drink order...which meant my friends had been waiting even longer for theirs. We ordered 3 wines and an ice tea. We mentioned the long wait for the appetizer and were told the kitchen was busy despite the fact that the restaurant was not full and my friend had ordered tartare. In my opinion, this just wasn't a good answer...just apologize & go check on it.

We got our wines, but the ice tea never came. We ordered salads, a crab cake appetizer, and a 2nd tartare. These took an equally long time and the crab cake was cold. Things were taking SO long that we didn't even bother ordering entrees because we had show tickets and we were afraid we would miss it.

Our server disappeared, and we finally waved down a busser in an attempt to ask for the check. This, of course, also took forever. We split the bill so I didn't get a full total, but a Caesar salad, a crab cake, and a glass of wine came to $52. NOT worth it by a mile!!!",4guhHcnzrximsz-DeEvskg,6,0,2,M_8HzPlLfLYE_okWLPv9-Q

Parking:  Dec 2017, it is free for the first hour.  4 hours to 24 hours is $10.

Check-In:  Welcomed by a friendly smile and check in was a breeze with my reservation.

Seating:  We were seated underneath the ""blackboard"" displayed today's special.  The sofa is not good for shorty (under 6ft).  I have to elevate myself in order to cut into my steak.  Note to self:  No sofa seating.  Another couple was seated next to us.  Immediately, the lady asked to switch seat with her tall husband.

Service:  Professional and knowledgeable

Food:
-Appetizer:  Tuna Tartare surprised me with its flavor at a Morden American Steakhouse.  I'd order it again.  I also order crab cake but my waitress did not hear my order.  So, we bypassed it.
-Comps:  Pâté is a good start with couple slices of crunchy bread. The popover is warm on arrival.  One pop per person  It was a good bake.  Sea salt and butter is it's company.
-Entrees:
NY Strip 16oz (Medium is Pink, Hot Center) is perfect for my normal medium rare but it is referred as the medium here.
Bone-In Ribeye 22oz (Medium Rare is Red, Warm Center)
Refer to the Steak Temp on the left-hand side of the menu.  It ranges from Blue (very red, cold center) to Well Done (no pink, hot center).
Sides:
Onion Rings is not the kind I liked.  It is not crispy on the outside and the onion is not very sweet.  But, the onion is fresh and crunchy on the inside.  I will pass this side next time.
Truffle Mashed (Potato) is heavenly smooth and infused with truffle.
Dessert:  Sundaes.  I am not a sundaes person but I wanted to try something different.  Again, it surprised me.  The sundaes come in a classic tall glass with a long spoon.  The ice cream quality is high and flavors are well paired with each other.  Each bite comes with a little surprise like a piece of chocolate, or a yummy crunchy piece of candy.  If all sundaes are like this one, I will be in love with sundaes all over again.

This is a quality restaurant inside Bally's.

Tips:
-Since parking is no longer free, I planned my day at and around Bally's.  We visited the Bodies exhibit at Bally's on the lower level.  Then, We walked across the bridge to Bellagio to see the water fountain, seasonal display.  By this time, it is about time for my dinner reservation here.  After dinner, we walked to Paris for a little more site seeing.  Instead of walking back to where we came from, we exit the Paris hotel & casino and walked on the strip and back into Bally's garage.
-I asked if I can take the menu home with me because I like the Angus Beef Chart reference on the back of the menu.  The waitress gladly gave me one to keep.",ERFbDSU0bg-dY6Pzgjl_Rg,0,0,4,4sxbI9qodPScqYBn3alwcQ

Service was amazing, from the waitress to the bus team to the servers. 

The bread pop overs the table received prior to our order were wonderful and so tasty I'd recommend this place just so you can experience them. 

My wife ordered the wedge salad and I had had the butternut squash soup. The wedge salad was perfect, served on a cold place as a salad should be. My soup looked good but tasted a bit sweeter than I prefer. I didn't say a word about it as it wasn't a bad soup, it was done they way he chef intended for it to be done but it wasn't they type I cared for. The service team saw I didn't eat any and asked if all was ok and I said I didn't care for it so they removed it from the bill. (Very thoughtful to proactively ask and take action when a patron isn't even making an issue)

We were a party of 4 and had salmon, filet, and ribeyes for dinner. Our food was properly cooked and tasted amazing. The table consensus was that the bone in ribeye was the best but once again all our entres were wonderful. 

For dessert we ordered ice cream, apple cobbler and the table was also given brownie and candy pops. All of which were the perfect way to end our best dinner of a 5 day stay in Vegas.

4628454,2017-09-08,0,07AZL5XenCQ_-op_onKLdw,"I'll tell you about my meal first, and add some additional context towards the end.

I dined at ""BLT"", located within Bally's, on the Las Vegas Strip, Labor Day weekend 2017. I ordered the Caesar Salad ($16.00), New York Steak ($58.00) and a Baked Potato ($12.00). For their complimentary bread service, I was provided a popover. (The restaurant's complete menu, with pricing, is available on their website.)

I am not a fan of ""Yorkshire Pudding"", but I now understand that a ""popover"" technically is a different product. (Yorkshire pudding incorporates beef drippings in the recipe, whereas popovers do not.) I found the popover to be very tasty, without the feature of pudding I dislike. 

I can't say that the Caesar salad tasted any better than one you might order at lower priced restaurant. But the texture was different:  the leaves were more tender. Upon inspection of the lettuce leaves, I suspect they are using baby Romaine lettuce (versus fully grown Romaine).  I also enjoyed the presentation. (Hopefully, my photo attaches.) It was a nice salad.

I usually don't buy New York steaks at the grocery. I find the cut tougher than I prefer. However, the menu stated that BLT's New York steak was aged 28 days--and the aging really makes a difference. Because of the aging, the beef was tender, but firm enough for you to enjoy the sensation of chewing. The aging process also infused the meat with just a hint of gaminess. I asked that the steak be cooked medium rare, and what I received was ""perfect"" in my eyes:  it was seared on the outside; the interior of the steak was hotter than warm, yet the color was still red; and the juices ran clear. A pat of herb butter was placed atop the steak as well. Overall, the steak was rich, savory and flavorful.

The baked potato is not the largest potato that I have been served in a la carte setting; however, it could sufficiently serve two people.

My original plan was to dine at a steak restaurant within the Paris resort, before attending a show. However, there was a wait--which surprised me, given the time of day I visited. Not wanting to be late for my show, I went to BLT (where I found there was no wait). 

So here's my bottom line:  BLT is not inexpensive. However, you will get a very good steak dinner, at a price less expensive than a restaurant affiliated with a marquee chef.

4646004,2017-08-08,1,07AZL5XenCQ_-op_onKLdw,"My husband and I ate here and it was the best meal I've ever had in Vegas! I wish there was a BLT Steak in Denver, because it would be my go-to place for special occasions. I've been to all the top steak houses around: Ruth's Chris, Cap Grill, Morton's, Del Friscos, etc. and BLT Steak tops them all! We started with salads: the caesar and the spinach with warm bacon dressing; both were amazing and we couldn't decide which was better. The martinis we sipped on had the most rockstar buttery blue cheese stuffed olives in them. The New York strip was cooked perfectly and melted in 
my mouth! The side we chose was Mac and cheese, which was gooey, rich, and absolutely heavenly! The stuffed mushrooms side dish was ok, a little dry and too earthy tasting in my opinion. I also want to give big props to the waitstaff, especially our waiter Sergio. He's been with the restaurant for decades and was spot-on with menu recommendations, as well as entertaining with his stories about favorite past celebrity guests and interesting Bally's history. Thanks again for a fabulous meal; in the future we'll always make BLT Steak a part of our Vegas visits!!",wWtRiyim2ZKMk8VGSxBosA,1,1,5,LEiZ7d4cTrPOYNExsv2iSQ
4653659,2017-02-02,3,07AZL5XenCQ_-op_onKLdw,"Consistently my favorite steakhouse in Vegas.  I would recommend making reservations a couple days in advance especially for peak dining times.  If you have a total rewards card they do accept it here.

The ambiance is classy without being pretentious and boasts an intimate/romantic vibe.  We arrived early and enjoyed a few glasses of wine from the bar in the waiting area.  Our server was Mario and I can't say enough good things about him but, he is definitely the best server I have had anywhere in the past 6 months.

For me the portion size of the filet with a few sides was enough for my friend and I to split, especially after the popovers they bring to the table.  They have an extensive wine list with a selection for every dish.

Popovers:  Served with butter and sea salt.  Be careful these are dangerously good and you will fill up fast.  This time they gave us a little recipe card with them so I will definitely try to recreate them at home.

Duck Liver Pate:  This came out compliments of the chef.  I am normally not a fan since it's usually so gamy but, it wasn't here.  It was smooth, creamy and mild in flavor. 

Ceaser Salad:  The salad was good but, I felt the dressing lacked the bold and robust flavor that it had on previous visits.

Filet: Juicy, flavorful, tender and cooked to the exact temperature we requested.  The pad of butter on top really gives it that something extra and I always order the blue cheese sauce on the side because it's a must have.

Veal Chop:  I am not a fan of veal however, I took the opportunity to take a bite of my friends.  It was a perfect medium, juicy and very lean.  If I wasn't such a steak fan I would probably order this next time.

Sides: 
Mashed Potatoes: So creamy and bordering on the edge of runny but, flavorful.
Stuffed Mushroom Caps: Hearty flavored filling and the mushroom caps were done without being mushy. 
Hen of the Woods Mushrooms: A perfect accompaniment to the flavor of the steak and a large portion size. 

Dessert: We chose the almond joy dessert off of the daily specials list and we were not disappointed with the artistry, creativity or flavors.  Mario also brought out a small brownie bite for all of us and even though I liked the almond joy better they were moist and well executed.

You can go elsewhere and pay a lot more for lackluster service and overpriced steaks on the strip that don't taste as good as this place but, I prefer consistency in every way.",ATK1ItQDQsHD5IG3sUGNnw,6,6,5,cGjbqERDM6cK0cC44Vb_xw

Only the Crab cakes left something to be desired (too much cake, not enough crab for $16). The highlight of BLT though is the steaks. Our group had Fillets and bone in Ribeye and everyone said it was one of the better, if not best steaks they could remember having. The side items are all A la carte, with the Mac n Cheese and Brussels sprouts being the best. Not huge portions, but enough for everyone to get a forkful. Booze pricing was good for Vegas = $8 Beers & $12 Call brand with a healthy shot.

Our waiter, Duff, was an absolute pro. He knew that menu inside and out. He was able to give us great recommendations on the wine list and food menu. He made everything sound so delicious that we wanted to order the whole menu! Just a phenomenal job. 

Now for the food... They started us off with a little amuse Bouche. It was duck liver mousse with jelly. I don't like liver at all but I gave it a try and wow it was good. My favorite thing was the popovers they brought instead of your typical loaf of bread. The flavor and texture were great and they even give you a card with the recipe! Sharing is caring! 

My fiancé got the Caesar salad which was great. He got the NY strip steak which was huge and I got my go to Filet Mignon. The steak was good but not the best I've had. Good flavor but it was only warm not piping hot even though it was served on a cast iron plate. I ordered it medium rare and it was perfectly cooked. It paired nicely with their plump asparagus and delicious Mac & cheese. I guess I was a little disappointed in the steak, but everything else was great.

4737375,2016-06-05,0,07AZL5XenCQ_-op_onKLdw,"I asked what she was hungry for, and she wanted stuffed mushrooms.  A quick search on Yelp turned up this establishment, reviews were good, restaurant was within view from the hotel, so...

BLT Steak is located in the Bally Casino. Apparently the acronym BLT is for Bistro Laurent Tourondel.  Laurent Tourondel being the Executive Chef/ owner of BLT with multiple locations in the US and around the world.

We sat at the bar, in some very comfortable chairs.  Very comfortable!

After our drinks were served, complimentary fresh baked popovers w/Gruyere cheese were brought out. Just two words, unique and excellent! A bit of butter, a little wine ... could have called it a meal at that point.

Stuffed mushroom cap appetizer was next, and packed with flavor.  Maybe a tad overcooked, but to be fair, the reduction in moisture actually intensified the flavor. Not a huge deal as all four of the caps were eaten; I'll take credit for three of them!

Bone in New York Strip was brought out medium rare as requested. The steak had excellent flavor, with a wonderful char on it. But, I don't think I'm being too picky to say, a $61 steak should be way more tender, shouldn't be chewy!

Service at the bar was excellent, with three different people making our experience a very good one.

We split the steak and mushroom side, and along with four drinks, a $150 bill was dropped. Not something you do every day, so overall, it was worth it.

Kinda goes without saying, but there are endless restaurants to eat at in Vegas, but we both agreed the atmosphere, food and service would definitely cause us to return.",fR71JY0G1jPsncawehuBKw,1,1,5,xgcsSQRHnewKUuQB-gO-jA

4763699,2016-03-01,1,07AZL5XenCQ_-op_onKLdw,"This place was exceptional. I am knocking it down a star because it seemed that every wine we ordered was out f stock. Kind of a random occurrence because they had a really extensive list that could cater to anyone's taste. I do have to say that the General Manager apologized profusely each time he said they were out of a particular wine, but he did suggest another wine which was actually a great pairing to what we ordered and suited both of our tastes. Kudos for him for knowing his stuff! Also knocking down a star because once we were seated it took 10-15 minutes for our server to come over. Once he introduced himself, he was very helpful and friendly. 

The amuse bouche was a pate... I don't remember what kind, but have you ever seen someone who doesn't eat meat break out a little redneck and try to lick the bowl clean? It was incredible. Wow. I want to get in the bowl of that deliciousness. 

We had the tuna tartare for our appetizer. I always order this fan favorite if I see it on the menu and I was not disappointed in their take on this dish. Try this if you like tuna!

My other half had the NY Strip and ordered it medium rare. This restaurant nails it on the head for cooking their steaks perfectly! Although he claims that he wishes he ordered it rare instead, it was thoroughly enjoyed. I had a bite and found it a tad too salty, but what can you expect from an aged steak? And in my opinion he should have ordered the steak rare (or blue, yes they do that here yay!), it is his own dang fault.

I had the Grilled Branzino. Having never tried this before, I was intimidated. I don't know why. This meal completely surpassed my expectations. It was incredible. I was finished with my fish before he could finish his steak!

On the side we ordered the mac-n-cheese. Overall it was good, but I have to say it wasn't mixed well so a few bites were extremely salty. The truffle mashed potatoes were everything I hoped and dreamed. I would order both again and just make sure to stir thoroughly next time.

I don't know that I would return as there are so many other steak house options, but I would recommend.",w47K60hE7QOiCqPB1lKHDw,1,2,4,LtX2FhtffJm_X7f4buyVcQ

For the main course, we shared an insanely good 12 ounce Wagyu ribeye. When. you eat the fat and it dissolves into the best gravy you've ever had, then you know it was $92 well-spent.

Servers were very attentive throughout making sure we had everything we needed and offered suggestions that always hit the mark. Started with a duck liver pate thing and it was phenomenal. As you will probably read over an over again in other reviews the popovers are easily one of my favorite uses of bread ever, they are light and rich and have great eggy goodness perfectly complemented with the sweet cream and sea salt. My buddies had the special steak with truffle butter and I had the bone-in Ribeye. All three steaks were perfectly cooked and had incredible flavor. On a whim I ordered the blue cheese sauce on the side because it sounded good, but the steak was so tasty I didn't really use it. It seemed like a waste to cover up that great steak flavor with a sauce that wasn't necessary.

Amuse Bouche of duck liver pate. Not my fave but then again not a live pate fan

Appetizer was Burrata toy box tomatoes and fresh mozzarella (this is on my top ten favorite things I've ever eaten) the tomatoes were unlike any I'd ever had before. Sweet and tart at same time. It was addictive. 

My spouse  and I then split the Lobster Cobb which was more than enough for two and relishes. 

I ordered petite filet with potato skins which was great but a tiny bit dry even tho it was cooked perfectly. Needed butter. I was to full to eat potatoes by this time which is probably why I thought my steak was just pretty darn good lol. I'd still say everything was perfect. 

Hubby had bone in ribeye and bone marrow as well as a potato baked. He devoured it. Medium rare and perfect. 

I didn't want dessert. Ok I'm lying of course I wanted dessert I'm on vacation :). If it's on the menu and you don't order it then shame on you. Seriously your loss. Best dessert of my life. Banana cream pie. Hmmm really you ask?  Yes really. Pecan crusted banana cream pie. I dream of this pie.

This was my second time here and this time we had the porter house for two. It was really good especially the filet side so tender no teeth needed. The best side was on the seasonal menu which has the corn with lobster and jalepeno that was so good. The creamed spinach was ok. 

When you sit down they give you pop overs made with milk and Gruyere cheese it's good but will fill you up. Then they give you complementary pate with crustini and some sliced chucuteri. So don't over do it on the appetizers you'll get full before the main course and won't enjoy the steak. 

Just a tip any high end restaurant in Las Vegas you don't need to dress up if you go to the bar, they have the full menu. 
I was able to get into BLT wearing shorts and shirt. I'm sure they rather have you dress  business casual but basically if you can afford it they take your business.

But I would give the effort to talk everyone into a different venue all factors considered.  When determining my overall rating, I asked myself if I would choose this over Ruth's Chris up the street at Harrah's, and the answer was ""no"".   

We were seated at a table with a distant view of the big specials board to the rear of the main dining room.  On my left were a bunch of douches in tank tops and shorts, while on the far right was a very casual date where the guy was sporting flip flops...with socks on!  The group of four straight ahead placed a Fat Tuesday's yard drink on the table as if it were a wedding reception centerpiece.  Classy!  I regretted not wearing my best pizza sauce stained wifebeater and fluorescent green breakaway track pants.  

If brought to the table blindfolded, I wouldn't have argued had I been told this was Grand Lux Cafe.  It was only by the time our lobster cobb salad was served that I noticed the left section of the restaurant, which seemed much more secluded and dimly lit.  If I am to spend as I would at any other steakhouse on the strip, the joint should play the part.  I wouldn't celebrate an anniversary here.  

One may think twice about ordering that starchy side dish after they bring out the complimentary carbs.   BLT's signature popover was a delicious detour from the traditional roll and butter.   The exterior featured a delightful burnt cheese top which I went for first before getting into the soft, doughy, croissant-like center.  I want to dive into a huge ball pit full of these and eat my way out.  
  
As expected, the rare porterhouse was the best part of dinner.   It was very thick, sufficiently juicy, and the herb butter enhanced the overall flavor nicely.  The outer charred crust complemented the cool bloody center of each piece and made for an enjoyable chew.  It bordered on a ""Pittsburgh style"" steak which I quite like when done right.  3.75 stars for the meat.

Both sides of creamed spinach and mashed potatoes lacked in temperature and were sent back upon first taste.  Our super friendly server, Leslie, was very apologetic.  The manager, Tammy, took my wife's glass of wine off the bill as compensation which was cool of them.  It was unfortunate that the re-cooked sides didn't arrive until we were pretty close to wrapping up the meal. 

One and most likely done.  I like when eating a steak on the strip feels victorious.  So much so that I want to march out with the t-bone held up high like it were the Olympic torch and Chariots of Fire music is playing.  I didn't feel anywhere close to that here.",8DEyKVyplnOcSKx39vatbg,83,72,3,GwngxUANrttLu7u4Tt3Chg

We decided to eat here around 530pm, before our show.  All tables were reserved, but there was seating at the bar.

The bar is at the front of the restaurant.

After we ordered our cocktails, they served their Signature Poppers. This bread was so airy, warm and delicious, and had gruyere cheese baked in.  This has to be the best bread I've had in my life. Add a little butter, and it melts in your mouth. 

I ordered their Tuna Tartar appetizer,  which was not just delicious, but amazing presentation.  Tuna on top of avocado, and served with crisps.

We split a Lobster Cobb Salad, which had large Lobster Claws.  Nice tasting salad, and large enough to split for 2 people.

After getting full from the bread, appetizer and salad, we awaited our 28 day aged New York Strip Steak, and ordered a side of cream spinach.  Steak was cooked perfected, and flavor was excellent. 

Sides are not included with the Steak, but you may not need it because their poppers (bread) can fill you up.

Warm Poppers - Complimentary
Tuna Tartar - $20
Lobster Cobb Salad - $24
New York Strip 16oz - $63
Creamed Spinach - $12

Total with cocktails - $145

Dress Code 
Casual, ok to wear jeans, but I wouldn't wear swimsuits to this establishment.

I also got a baked potato which was the size of a small football. They must be growing these is some of abandoned nuclear test sites nearby. Total meal price: $90

The steak was $64, which I was ok, with thinking it would be a 4-5 star meal.  Sadly I was underwhelmed once I got that piece of meat back up to my room.  

The char on the steak was wayyyy too thick and crusty, it overpowered the beautiful natural taste of the rib eye.  I was really surprised and disappointed.  I had not eaten all day and ate a few bites, but just tossed the rest (my dog would be so pissed at me) .  I have had some really excellent steaks in Vegas and this was by far the worst and felt like a waste of money and my fantasy of devouring a beautiful steak in my hotel room after a long week of work.   

Maybe it was an off night, because the couple next to me as I waited ordered short ribs and had to send them back and were so bothered they did not want another. 

Also, lame no sides come with the steak.  Would not recommend. Sad!",DqvPZh-crUdz4vN4tuVw-Q,5,1,2,ECAaPdo8xB_tVahFWdWyUw

American Wagyu Rib eye 12oz at $92:
Amazing taste, juicy and very tender. You can definitely taste the quality of meat. Highly recommended in median-rare if you are a steak lover.

Bone in Rib eye 22oz at $55:
This one comes with bone marrow which is very tasty and flavorful.  

28-days Dry aged Bone-in NY 20oz at $61:
Nicely cooked for the central part, but I don't like the burned bitterness of the surface.

Filet Mignon 10oz at $56:  
Very thick piece, perfectly cooked to pink. 

Sides: Creamed spinach & Grilled asparagus $11 each, Baked potato (creamy, rich, and tasty) $9. Lobster bisque is great, too, but there is no lobster chunk. 

Passion Fruit crepe soufflés: Rich filling but with fresh taste of passion fruit sauce, a great dessert with generous size to share.

Alcohol: Highly recommend the watermelon basil, brilliant color with brisk mouth-feel.

Complimentary appetizer platter: dry-aged beef, prosciutto, salami with duck liver and honey dip is remarkable and with beautiful presentation. 

Complimentary desserts: lollipop cake and brownie, too bad that we were too full to finish them.",BFFDzZR0ixxD3azljG5ysA,4,2,5,dVGklzFxCl9WgPM0djvEtw

The Bad: Crazy prices.  Why charge separately for sides?

The Review: I'm not much for fine dining. I hate paying $60 for a puny dish with some nice presentation and ""umami"" flavor. However, I will dish out some $$$ on a quality steak. I was a bit apprehensive about coming to this place because I was worried we were underdressed (wrestling t-shirt and shorts) but you didn't sense a hint of condescension from any of the staff. I ordered the $60+ bone-in steak w/ marrow. My buddy ordered the same thing, I was a bit disappointed at how much marrow he got compared to mine.  The steak was juicy and the cream spinach was great.  They brought out a few items ""courtesy of the chef"" for us to try. The duck pate w/ crackers was really good, as was the brownie at the end.

My friend opted for the $92 Wagyu steak. It was smaller than our 22oz monsters at 16oz, but you could taste the difference in quality.  However was it really worth $92?  I don't know about that.

I was a bit disappointed that they charged for additional sides, especially after going to a place like House of Prime Rib in SF that just charges you for the cut of meat and everything else is included.  Other than that I'd definitely recommend folks looking for a quality steak to check out BLT Steak.",QYz5uE96fEV_hzEvq9TIqw,0,1,4,YHGX1Fz5Ex2B1mBcKqYQYg

Then we spent another 10 min standing there trying to keep the kids busy while they searched for the chairs. The waiter came back with only one saying they didn't have another. I gave him the idea of borrowing one from next door and luckily we got our two highchairs. After that inconvenience, the service and food were terrible. Both the bone-in ribeye and New York steaks were too tough. Had to send back the New York to have it cooked a little longer b/c our medium was too rare. Don't get the ""hen of the mushrooms.""

5935876,2017-04-05,4,07AZL5XenCQ_-op_onKLdw,"I came here for the reservation-only Sterling Brunch. My husband's favorite food happens to be from here--truffle mashed potatoes--and this is also probably his favorite place to eat. I was a tad skeptical at first, but if this place is good enough to book 2.5 months ahead of time, they might be on to something. They made sure to get a table with Duff--an incredibly friendly, eye-patch wearing, charismatic gentleman who never let our champagne glasses run dry and kept our tables clean and tidy the entire time we were there. 

The food was also great. I have never seen cocktail shrimp all jumbo sized and perfectly peeled, nor have I ever seen such consistency with ""buffet style"" medium rare steak. Every single dish had the quality as if I had ordered the individual entree at a regular restaurant. In fact, the only critique I'd give would be that the sushi was lacking and had way too much rice for the amount of fish, but the fish itself was incredibly fresh. 

The desserts are also itty bitty morsels of all kinds of sweets; I saw tiramisu, berry tart, lemon-raspberry tart, etc. Their chocolate strawberries are gigantic and absolutely amazing!

5948116,2015-08-18,1,07AZL5XenCQ_-op_onKLdw,"More like 2.5 stars.  Very expensive, even with a groupon that I got for 55.00( used a 20% off promo code) for 100.00 worth of food.  

My disclaimer is that I don't eat beef, however everyone else in my party does.  They did let us use 2 groupons( 1 per couple) so that was nice. 

My wife and female cousin both ordered filet, medium well.  They enjoyed that a lot.  Both said the steak was perfectly cooked and tender.  Male cousin got a NY strip and he also enjoyed that. In my opinion,  For the price of the steak, they should give you the sauce, not charge an extra 2.00( nickel and dime the customer).  The side dishes were advertised by the server as "" family style"".  Wrong, they are single serving size and pricey at 10.00 each.  My wife and I shared a baked potato, mac n cheese( just ok) and cream spinach.  Cousins had green beans, mashed potatoes( loaded with butter and cream) and baked.   

I was NOT a fan of the popovers nor was my wife because we dont like ""eggy"" tastes and those were very eggy tasting.    Speaking of eggs, I got the lobster cobb salad( 23.00).  The hard boiled egg was NOT hard boiled, I can't eat runny yolks and thats what I was served.  I asked for a hard cooked egg and was told they did not have any.  Also asked for croutons and was given stale toasted bread.  The salad had a few chunks of lobster, not that much.I'm not a fan of frisee' or radicchio and the salad was loaded with that.  It was not special and not worth the price.   

For desserts we had banana cream pie, that was very good, the best part of the meal.  My cousins had a peanut butter mouse.   It was their 20th anniversary and the restaurant gave them a small amount of champagne, not a free dessert or anything more.   Pretty chintzy. 

We skipped the duck pate because we're not fans.   

I doubt I'd be back, even with the groupon.  We had to pay an extra 28.00 and then left a 20.00 tip. ( just our portion)",FVeD1j9SeczVz-jZyPxBJg,2,1,3,ESWG0rQZJgE_DZUi8crqXQ
