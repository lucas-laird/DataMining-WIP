The food is always good and it tastes good too. As good as Chipolte and half the price, this is my go-to lunch spot near CSN.",4PAbEV_aep8BYVZPzVGrnw,0,0,4,KpAkJlqCowwT6lWXkNX-hg
148562,2013-07-28,0,WwBadFHFU-81RJAKtTgB_Q,I love their carne asada quezadilla which I drench in their green sauce. They also have a great variety of aguas frescas(I personally am a fan of their fresa agua). I have also tried the tostadas de ceviche(they make their own tostada) and tortas ahogadas. I have to say that I live close by so have come to know the owner who makes sure we get what we want and already knows the way we like our food. I try to go when I know she is working.,WSiKkU1tcd5noz8EbTad9A,1,0,4,Cc6lEtGbXoYkda9r-ESVKA

2687358,2011-06-22,0,WwBadFHFU-81RJAKtTgB_Q,"I'm a Vegetarian so I'm always happy when I see the word ""Veggie"" (in any language!) and the Vegetariano Burrito totally fit the script.  I came here after school one day with only a few dollars in my pocket hoping to find something that was a little cheaper than the $600.00 cookie they sell in the University cafeteria (I'm kidding about the price ...but seriously it's like this big *hand motion* and stupidly expensive...!)

Anyway.  
I was extremely happy to find this place a few blocks away.  I used to take classes at CSN (it's right across the street) so I can't believe I never noticed it before.  So I went inside and was extremely pleased with everything.  The place is clean and the staff speak English (always a plus ...though I do speak pretty fluent spanish so I guess it really doesn't matter lol.)  

The Vegetariano Burrito was extremely tasty.  It was BIG too,which I liked, especially for the price.  I'd reccomend it even for meat-eaters.

I've since come here almost weekly (or more) and they've always had my order quickly and never gotten it wrong.  Oh, and try the juices on the counter - their Horchata is very good, but I'm a big fan of the Naranjo myself!!  (They also have a TV with various Spanish soaps playing...if you want to stick around.)",2sE0UDX0j9h-dREZpssiSw,2,2,5,WVl0urDj6WzpqeLyioS4-Q

My boyfriend and I ordered 3 carne asada tacos and carne asada fries. The meat was tasteless...even when I drenched my taco in the red AND green sauce.

The carne asada fries was nothing worth mentioning. It was boring and tasteless.",9ks-80ZxeCZWNObzEbW4-Q,1,1,2,dJnzdF33R2uvOcBqTiEu_Q
3492192,2012-06-01,0,WwBadFHFU-81RJAKtTgB_Q,"I adored the fun jugs of aqua frescas along the front counter! So good.  In fact you can sample some before you decide on your favorite.  The food is really good.  In the event that you are craving some legit Mexican food this is no doubt my new fav.  I do have to say that the true test for me is the rice and beans.  AMAZING! They have some really tasty rice and beans here. I ordered the gordita combo w/ a carnita taco.  It was HUGE. The portions here are insane.  I love that.  I also was a little disappointed in the gordita because where I come from it's a homemade soft corn puff taco and this was a deep fried torta of some sort.  I was not familiar with it and it was not appetizing but the filling was great.  I just didn't eat the two deep fried saucers it came with and it was still very delish. The corn toritlla carnita taco w/ a full fix of toppings was so fat I could barely close it to eat. It was so good and filling!!!  I can't get over the value of the food here.  Its so affordable, delicious and the service is great.

The best part for me was the supersized $2 drink of aqua fresca!  The drink was supersized but called Regular and I think next time I'll get the bigger one because it was one of the best parts of the meal.  And in this desert heat you can't pass up an ultra refreshing fresa(strawberry) aqua fresca that you can enjoy long after the meal.",PtEQ6LrPT4qO5L7sno95Hw,0,0,4,fZISpPzWI3o8SUfHePMLZQ

I went with the tacos de pescado. The fish was tender and well prepared. But here's the kicker, the absolute best part wad the fresh lemonade. Seriously WOW. For the price you pay, the food portions are more then fair.",FTZyZbr1eF7s3Ss7uSLcXQ,0,0,4,kpihNDRboysq3a2LPja56A
3985195,2012-06-26,0,WwBadFHFU-81RJAKtTgB_Q,"So the food is good but the consistency sucks. I am working on a house nearby and stopped in for lunch got an order of tacos, the cashier asked if I wanted cilantro and onion, i also ordered cheese on the side, all was well. 
Later I went when I left my job site I stopped in the second time, they added hot sauce and salsa to my tacos, I'm allergic to tomatoes, so when I complained this cashier took my food back with much resistance and the presentation for the fixed food was less than desirable... It was basically labeled GTFO",z9MwKFs-CFzMQdwSOgHleA,0,0,3,puqvh4E5r4zHtx0ilyk14g

The tacos are great while everything else is pretty standard fare. The al pastor and carnitas are fantastic, but the carne asada was too fine in texture for me. They chop it so it's almost like a ground beef it's so small. The fish tacos are made with tilapia which in my opinion taste kind of like dirt. The thyme in the seasoning on it didn't help with that. The beans are rice are meh.

They have a good salsa bar with fresh citrus, spicy pickled carrots and cauliflower, your standard red and green sauces. But the highlight of the place is the frescos.

The juices they have available in the glass jugs up front are fantastically fresh and cold. Yes, they are stupid sweet, but during summer.. there are few things better than these sweet icy cold fresh fruit concoctions. Come for a couple tacos and the frescos!",Gap65780O9PI3Ui7Zj6Avw,1,1,3,ZehI5wGdwVLVVwzUnFZ5JQ
4360591,2012-06-09,0,WwBadFHFU-81RJAKtTgB_Q,"jamaica juice is so refreshing! I ordered their papas con carne, which is pretty much carne asada fries. The carne asada meat was so soft, no chewy parts at all, compared to Roberto's. You can't compare though because each it made differently. My brother ordered Chile Releno, which was served on a fancy clay plate!

We were very happy with our meals, price, and their service.",a7Oby4yiZ8wHKvu2zhoC5Q,0,0,5,HqZzVMz8nCSv3eWODpR19w
4371814,2011-06-13,0,WwBadFHFU-81RJAKtTgB_Q,"Awesome selection of food, very friendly service !!

I can tell this place is a lot more authentic compared to Chipotle or Robertos. They have fried fish head for crying out loud! Which is actually a popular dish at this place. It's right across from CSN Charleston campus, which is why when my friends and I are tired of Denny's or Tropical Smoothie, we go here instead. No matter what you order you HAVE TO try the different flavored juices they offer on the counter. I've tried Pineapple, Orange, and Watermelon. I stray away from Horchata since I've never really developed a liking for it :( Their watermelon was the BOMB! I kept coming back for refills! The first time I went here I got their enchiladas. The portion and sides of this dish never disappoints! 

I can't believe this place isn't that well-known. But seeing  Latino families come here on a daily basis tells me this place is legit. Being open 'til midnight also helps for those hangovers I guess lol!",YUzqKt7hmG5BkRykHeZ0gg,2,2,4,ElTKP4GHSHclODulgJBm3w
4387775,2012-07-08,0,WwBadFHFU-81RJAKtTgB_Q,I had the enchiladas which were absolutely disgusting. The sauce tasted like tomato paste with absolutely no flavor. The cheese was not melted on the inside and then they piled on the Oaxaca cheese which all combined was horrible. I had to go have them microwave my plate to melt it and still no good. Boyfriend ordered carnitas tacos which were ok and we ordered shredded beef taquitos which were covered in a cilantro sauce. The sauce just tasted like pulverized cilantro yuck!

I loved the taste of the soft taco it was tasty! I wasn't a big fan of the Carne Asada burrito because it was too salty for me and they put rice in the burrito .

5414182,2011-09-19,0,WwBadFHFU-81RJAKtTgB_Q,"I wanted to see why people like this place. Really? I got my order in Spanish and the TV had some obnoxious soap opera en Espanol so I had really high hopes for this place. Then I opened my box and was like WTF? You know it's not a good sign when you feel the grease in your mouth before you even touch your food.

 I ordered a chicken quesadilla and a taco with rice and beans. The quesadilla felt like it was prepared by a 10 year old white girl who decided to use her mother's left over grease from a week ago to experiament with cooking for the first time. The taco was whatever. My Bulgarian mother has made more authentic tacos than that. The beans were good, but if they fucked those up I'd be worried. They have them premade in cans. Sure, the portions were large, but what happened to quality over quantity? I blame my negative reviews due to my travels. If I had never traveled to Mexico or didn't seek out Mexican food frequently, I probably would have loved this place.

Oh also, customer service....forget it. Nobody smiles here. They're probably pissed they have to eat their own food on their lunch break though so that's why I give this place two stars.",mGSdRa7h7QbA_cy9aVcIGQ,1,0,2,kEq6xdLgfvu08m8__i3SiQ

While she didn't remember the name, we went inside and the cashier and her clearly had a friendly relationship because my friend followed up on her Thanksgiving plans. 

My friend ordered for me a chicken burrito.  I also had this crazy drink that was in large iced glass jars up front labeled by fruit names.  I got the orange, which was pretty tasty.

The burrito came with a bit of chips on the side.  I should have really just eaten half and saved the rest for later.  Instead, it was so good and we were chatting that I got 3/4 of the way through the burrito before I realized that I was too full to take another bit.

Besides chicken, the burrito had sauteed veggies, rice, and beans.  I would return and order for myself, but when someone offers to buy you lunch, you say yes.  The total bill was around $15 for two burritos and two drinks.",kWj6AdUtkvbzhdsqRifwLQ,0,0,4,BXPzeYvRVcRVGZCe7-XORg
