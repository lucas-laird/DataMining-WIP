511897,2010-09-25,0,Fyuotg1ShiQZLtV5Dmjakg,"Came here for lunch a few weeks ago. It was just okay.

The lunch specials for $6.99 seemed to be a good deal. I got the mongolian beef. It came with hot and sour soup, as well as fried rice, a spring roll, and wonton. The food was okay but nothing special.

I'd like to give this place another try, but my first and only experience was so underwhelming that I might not even bother.",WFVBNj0fdsfrzL-qkd83fg,2,1,2,sVtwbxsZMOoXz4m3w1015A

670209,2016-01-10,0,Fyuotg1ShiQZLtV5Dmjakg,"Avoid this place at all costs if you are going there for food! I can't write a review about the food as we never got ours. My wife and I stopped in to order food for our family and our extended family. After ordering through the bartender, the staff for the restaurant hadn't shown up yet even though it was 5:15, we were assured that the restaurant was opening at 5:30pm. The staff showed up and we thought all was good. At around 5:30 we saw a couple enter the restaurant. We saw them leave after eating in the restaurant at about 6:15 and we saw a to go delivery order at about the same time. The bartender seemed to not want to make eye contact with us as she could probably see our frustration. Finally after calling her over she said, "" I'm going to honest with you, the lady cook didn't show up and I have no idea when it's going to be ready."" Before this she had assured us that the cook was ""cooking his ass off"" to get our food out. If you have been in this town as long as I have, 1968, you know things have changed. This used to be a good local place for good Chinese food and good service. Now though I see it as more of a bar and less of a restaurant. In the time that it has taken me to type this we have gone to ""Chop Chop Wok"" an are driving home with hot food.",lf02lYKpUClKvlSFVBRIFQ,0,0,1,ke1Hg_Ak2zVfVZnAR8cihg

The crab rangoons were mini frozen from the grocery store...the scorpion bowl cost $10 and had no alcohol in it. WORST PLACE I HAVE EVER EATEN IN MY LIFE.

844310,2015-08-06,0,Fyuotg1ShiQZLtV5Dmjakg,"We called in for delivery. When the lady answered she just said ""hello!"" So at first we thought that we had called a residence. So we placed our order and before we could confirm the price or the estimated time of arrival, she said ""ok they'll be there soon bye!"" And hung up. An hour later our food arrived (we live 2 minutes away,ordering on a Thursday  ). Instantly once we opened our door the stinch of the food overwhelmed us. The orange chicken had juice dripping from the bag so I had to be careful to not get it on the carpet. The shrimp fried rice was the smell. Very fishy and rotten smell. So we tasted it, just to make sure that we weren't mistaking smell for something else...but nope. The nastiest thing I've ever tasted. Tasted like it had sat in the garbage for a day. My son was holding his nose through the house. We would have drove to our normal Chinese spot but I injured my leg and they don't deliver.I don't know if we just ate their on a bad day or trash day..$36 down the drain...we ended up eating cearal tonight.",TQoFVejycgcfLfoJ2_XOxQ,0,0,1,-b6pFzaWbg4C52uHM8GsCA

1352651,2014-02-12,0,Fyuotg1ShiQZLtV5Dmjakg,"Not a terrible experience, but here it goes.  No customers inside at 5:30pm when I arrived.  Hostess/Server had me pick my own seat.  No background music.  DÃ©cor was so-so, some stuff was themed, some not so much.  I ordered Crab Rangoon ($4.95 for 8) and Mongolian Beef dinner ($9.95 I think).  About this time one lady came out and started playing a piano in the middle of the dining room.  Not Asian-themed music, but whatever, some live music was somewhat entertaining.  She played 3 or 4 songs and was done...back to silence.  Crab Rangoons were good.  Mongolian Beef flavor was on point...beef was a little low quality, the kind that is slightly rubbery but easy to chew (sorry, it's hard to describe but I've experienced this from other places too).  While sitting there with no music I could overhear everything.  I overheard the Server speaking with another and explaining that they didn't have all the items on the menu so for them to tell her what they wanted and she would go find out if they had it or not...thought that to be a little off-setting for the customer.
The place is connected to a gaming bar/lounge area on the other side of a swing door so they offered a full bar for beverages, but you had the bar customers coming over in to the restaurant to use the restrooms so that would be a negative I felt.
Honestly, for the dine-in experience, I would probably choose somewhere else.  While sitting there I saw several people come in and pick up take-out orders.  I could definitely see myself doing take-out though.",naZhgyS1OJFvHhGUYQh9fQ,1,0,3,Zw50dAtra-lxFfPPo3nfoA

2109141,2012-01-16,1,Fyuotg1ShiQZLtV5Dmjakg,"I could barely give this empty, deserted restaurant one star. Because the steamed rice was edible, I decided to be fair. 

Not only was the hostess on her iPhone the entire time, but I'm pretty sure I could've made a better Chinese dish.

The Sesame Chicken was fried cutlets with a sauce dripped over. Not only were the pieces of chicken dry, but half of it did not have sauce on it. 

For a pretty basic meal, I'd say it's a no-go. Also, the hostess needs to put her iPhone away when the ONE guest is in the restaurant.",OmXSelfYlZs7L4uVywuluQ,1,2,1,kMn_SswsBDA8QrYNiONsBw

3283416,2011-05-31,0,Fyuotg1ShiQZLtV5Dmjakg,"I actually kind of liked this place. The decorations were simple, but that's not really a bad thing. The room sort of has this green theme going on, with the walls and seating. Some of the seating is a little old, but it's still comfortable.
There's a lounge next door/connected to the restaurant, and it was a little loud.They were apparently having some sort of private birthday party and were playing some rap music with a little too much bass. 
The price of my dish was really good for the quality. You have to try the mongolian beef! So tasty. The only thing I didn't really like was my hot and sour soup.It was nice and spicy but too thick. A little too much of the cornstarch or whatever for my taste. 
For the food and ambiance I can really only give it 3 stars, but because of the awesome waitress that I sat talking to while sipping a delicious (strong!) cocktail bumps it up to 4.",YJsjA7msCI4-Dh8_pDcSYQ,3,1,4,nU0dnEOcCbUaupYG2nwx3g

4677199,2010-08-20,1,Fyuotg1ShiQZLtV5Dmjakg,"I heard about this place a long time ago from my Indonesian friends. I love indonesian food, but unfortunately there is no Indonesian restaurants in town. When I heard about this place, I thought i have to check it out. Although it almost a half year ago, since I went there, i still clearly remember how lame is the food. 

When I went there, it was pretty slow, other than us probably only other 2 old couple having their dinner. Decorations of the place is kind of lame, you can see all the furniture is really old, they should probably change it. But, I don't care about furniture that much. I go to restaurants to eat and not to appreciate how good the decorations. I will leave the points for the decorations to other reviewer.

As soon as I got the menu, I right away turned to the Indonesian food section. My eyes were sparkling, I'm pretty sure I dropped a tear just looking at that menu.  Since my friend has no idea about indonesian food, I thought I'll let the server explain it to him. Unfortunately, the server had no idea either. She had never tried any of the food. After a minute or two the server finally recommended one of the dishes. Which was the beef with the coconut curry flavor. I thought I'll give it a try, since that one the server admitted it herself that she knows that one and she knows for sure that is a good dishes. I also ordered some salad and some shrimp dishes. 

Once we received our dishes, the beef looked not pleasant in the eyes at all. It looked almost like a mongolian beef with an old leftover gravy put on top of it. When I tried it. All you can taste is coconut milk, you can barely taste any other flavor. It was just horrible. As an indonesian and a human, I feel embarrassed if this is the kind of Indonesian food they serve to human beings. I know this is a chinese restaurant, but If you can't serve indonesian food, then don't put it on the menu! Maybe it was just a wrong day i went, maybe the chef was just not a regular chef that usually knows how to cook Indonesian dishes. 

But as my experience for the food, it was not good at all. Out of 3 dishes I ordered. 1 of them 0 star, 2 of them 1.5 star. Average 0.5 star.",aIZMN-Sn90rpxOUaXAxKaA,3,1,1,jQ26Vo1xLlBTqC2All_d8Q

There was about maybe 6-8 tables and a lot of couches, the chef or maybe it was the manager and the hostess looked to be asleep on the couches. The soda had no carbonation, the table we were sat at was dirty. There was chucks of food on the table cloth and I looked around at the other tables to see that we were sat at the only one that was gross. The menus were caked with dried up sauces and most of the menu items were crossed out with pencil. If you could afford new couches for your staff to lounge on then pay for new menus for your patrons.

The restaurant is quaint and seemed clean from what we could see.  They even had linen table clothes and napkins.  You don't see that too often.  I was surprised the place was not packed at dinner time.
