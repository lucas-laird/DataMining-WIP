Stopped by on Saturday for a lunch. They had no grilled chicken available! I know... things happen but when place call itself Peru Chicken and has no chicken available it's like hot dog stand with no hot dogs.

Ordered something called Tacu Tacu and plate of Antichuchos and potatoes with cheese sauce for app.

Tacu tacu consisted of huge pile of rice/beans mixture and small slab of grilled meat.  No veggies, no pickle... just that. Come on - work on presentation and quantities and you can probably charge $10 for that otherwise it's a fail.

Antichuchos - slices of meat on a stick with bland side of corn and undercooked potatoes.  Meat was OK. Sides weren't. 

Appetizer (I think it was called pappas a la huancaina) - 3 sad pieces of cold boiled  potato served on a styrofoam plate covered with cheesy sauce (cold as well) - $5 is way too much for it.",ifN4zDOzYHt3RxEKW6Rc0Q,4,3,2,Yj1g8H53L5F1rrfMok6S4Q

I personally had a Tallarin Saltado and a Lomo Saltado. Both which were excellent! I was most impressed by the speed and quality of the food. It got to our table very quick and didn't lose an ounce of quality.

It's a small place, so if you have a party for more than 4 people be prepared to wait unless you get lucky.

I'm also particularly picky on my Chica Morada but I thought this one passed the test. Nothing extraordinary but nice to have it's pretty remote from other Peruvian places.

For dessert, we had Picarones (Peruvian ""donuts"") and they were very good! Reminds me of an old vendor in Tumbes, Peru who cooked it the EXACT same way.

I'd highly recommend this restaurant. It's a unique place to take your friends or family. Our own family went here two days in a row and it was definably worth it.",K-Ckl9MtgNqjYEmpOFgUIQ,0,1,4,OVgneTvVggnF6WJyVzOhGA

We ordered a ""ceviche de pescado"" this was absolute favorite as I'm writing I'm craving it. It had a fresh taste, it smelled delicious, the fish was perfectly cooked with their secret recipe lime juice. The fish was cut in perfect pieces it was served in top of two fresh leaves of lettuce on the side of the plate two generous slices of sweet potato and ""canchita"" (similar in crunchiness to corn nuts but, at whole different level) on the other side of the plate a good size of choclo (corn on husk but the corn is gigantic). We also ordered a whole rotisserie chicken the seasoning was superb and the chicken was tender and juice we chose as sides white rice which was perfectly done as it was not mushy or flavorless for our second side we ordered French fries, my son loved them! They were made from real potatoes not frozen. The ahí sauce I wish they would sell it by buckets!!!! Spicy but so worth it. Also, if you go and order ceviche know that it is spicy but it's a good spicy. The place is clean, it is very small so be patient if you go in a group larger than 4 as tables might be taken. I'm honestly surprise that they are not bigger. Next time we are in Vegas this will be are must stop, I honestly rather eat here for my entire stay in Vegas than at any hotel restaurant or buffet.

1368067,2018-01-06,0,dlNMXG9-BWsPGom0_lCCNQ,"Peruvian food taste amazing! This location is somewhat hidden in the Piazza Napoli Center. It's in the area near the Cuba Café Tapas & Bar. When you enter the restaurant, there are at least 4 to 5 seating tables. Majority of the orders are for take-out. Fortunately it wasn't busy when I arrived. I was immediately seated by a nice lady and she was able to put in a special request for my order. 

I chose the Tacu Tacu con Pollo ($10.95) which is served as Peruvian Refried Beans and Rice with Rotisserie Chicken Breast, and it comes with a slice of tomato and lemon pickled red onions. If you enjoy rotisserie chicken, this place hits the spot. The chicken is well-seasoned and you can tell it's freshly cooked when the meat taste soft and tender. Chicken paired with the savory flavor of refried beans and rice makes this dish so tasty and delicious.

For dessert, I had Platano Frito ($2.00) which are Fried Plantains. I grew up eating fried bananas so it's not anything new to me. I just like bananas, particularly plantains. I know it taste good and it is sweet when they are fried. Also I tried the Picarones ($5.50) which are Pumpkin and Sweet Potato Doughnuts served with Honey Fruit. The doughnut is light, crunchy and soft, and I really like the sweet syrup that came with it.

As for the atmosphere, I like how they set the channel to MTV Tr3s. You have no idea how much I love Latin music! The song playing was ""Nuestra Cancion Pt. 2"" and it definitely set a fun and upbeat vibe. Good music, friendly and speedy service, and authentic flavor, this place is already on my top go-to for Best Peruvian Food. Also if you like taking home snacks and sweet treats, they do have wafer, cookie bars, and Panettone on the front counter.",dpvR4LYXr0CYHtHf8BeCKg,1,3,5,h35geOTaaxCqAtMoNe5viw

1438108,2018-04-30,0,dlNMXG9-BWsPGom0_lCCNQ,"Came here for the first time while I was in the area for some work recently. It was around noon when I had stopped by and it wasn't that busy. The restaurant is a small little place but super friendly staff. 

I had completely come here on a whim and didn't really look into what I should order. After a brief skim and looking at pictures, I had determined something green and something meat is good. LOL apparently, I had written a note on Yelp (that doesn't show on mobile) stating ""To Try: Pollo and Aji Verde"". Oops? 

In the end, I ended up ordering the ""Tallarin Verde Con Bisteck"". This is a fresh pesto linguine w/ steak and a half of a potato. Why I didn't end up ordering something chicken, I don't know. I think the pesto linguine sounded so good, that it trumped over any other order. XD Wonder if there's a pesto linguine with rotisserie chicken ?? They have whole chicken in a rotisserie oven but for some odd reason, just didn't feel like getting it. xD 

I wanted to eat this in the car as I drove home, but I didn't get any utensils. And unfortunately, couldn't find any in the car either. Had to wait until I completed my journey home before I had a fork. Almost contemplated eating with toothpicks but wasn't THAT desperate

So back to the ""Tallarin Verde Con Bisteck"". A good portion of the pesto linguine. I can't judge on the cook of the pasta because I had to wait so long but the flavor was good. It was like a normal pesto linguine pasta. The steak was a thin cut flank I believe. Nicely cooked and really tender. Knife not needed. I was asked what kind of sauce I wanted, either mild or hot. Of course, I would go for the hot. It was a spicy green sauce. The taste reminded me of this cilantro garlic sauce I make at home but with a spicy kick. It was pretty yummy to match with the steak. 

Overall, not a bad place. Need to prepare more next time on what to order. XD",Ksp1e9Dw0Jcog_ZBD3-45g,2,0,3,FOJY0eSa8Fh8mKKOXxeR2g

1690673,2018-01-07,2,dlNMXG9-BWsPGom0_lCCNQ,"One of my favorite parts of my travels from Peru was definitely the food. Before I met my husband, I never tried Peruvian food before and I'm always grateful that I married into such an awesome culture. 

With that being said, I have seen the rise of Peruvian eateries in Vegas and I have an itch to try them all. This time around, we came here to Peru Chicken. We ordered the pollo a la brasa (1/2 chicken) which is like a rotisserie style chicken. The combo came with rice and beans for the side, which I think is a nice change. Normally places will serve pollo a la brasa with a side of fries and salad. You also have that option here, but we thought we would switch it up. The chicken was juicy and the seasoning was on point. I'm not one who is crazy about eating the skin because it can sometimes be fatty and chewy, but the skin on this chicken is melted down beautifully and retained the seasoning well to make it super flavorful. The beans were also cooked and seasoned well. If you're not afraid to mix your food, I would totally recommend mixing the rice and beans.

The atmosphere itself is very authentic as well. Colorful decor, Latin music playing throughout, and the ovens were visible from the seating area so you can watch the chickens cook. I felt like I was in a restaurant in Peru.

I also really liked that this place sells Peruvian goodies like Doña Pepa and they also make alfajores and picarones AKA the best desserts ever! Not a lot of places in town that I've been to make picarones.

But they have two other green sauces too: one spicy, one creamy, both in large squirt bottles on the tables. Figure out which one you like and slather it on everything. The spice level of the darker green one tends to vary but the creamy sauce is tasty on anything.

2157957,2016-09-12,0,dlNMXG9-BWsPGom0_lCCNQ,"I was really craving some Peruvian chicken and hadn't had any in the 18 months that I've lived in Vegas so, as always, went to Yelp to find the best in the city. 

This place seemed to receive the highest views so I wanted to give it a shot. 

I went with the 1/4 chicken white, white rice and beans, plantains, and picarones for dessert. 

The chicken was good, not great. Tasty but not overly moist like I hoped for but had a nice dry rub that gave it good flavor. The rice was pretty dry. The beans were really good. In a tomato based paste vs. just being beans in a cup. The plantains were really nicely done as I expected them to be at a Peruvian place. 

The picarones were tasty. I saw the photo and knew I had to give them a try. They are basically sweet potato and dough, donut rings with a honey sauce drizzled on top. 

For all those things, I paid about $17 with tip. Wasn't cheap but not really expensive either. 

The service was 'ok'. I would say really good but the lady never thanked me for coming in. I always like to hear that. I walked out of the door slowly just to see if she would say something then- but nothing. It's a small place so she definitely saw me. 

I leave this place feeling like it was just an average experience. I'm not running back anytime soon but I give them 4 stars because 3.5 isn't an option.",zfP7JESA_WfKvNQzYJDa7g,0,5,4,GE9lE4Nb0R2MVfuvqo5RTw

Petra and I tested out her favorite dish, papa a la Huancaína. They provided so much of the tasty, mildly spiced cheese sauce that we were soaking it up with lettuce leaves after the warm potato slices were gone. A cup of chicha morada, a drink of boiled purple corn, fruits, and spices served cold was good, though it had less clove flavor than I'm used to. 

Pollo a la brasa is their specialty, so I took a half chicken to my husband for his lunch at work. It cost $9 and included two sides. I got rice and fries for him; beans and salad are also available if you're the Anticarb. It appeared to be a smaller bird, but the skin had an aromatic blend of seasonings and perfect caramelization. He enjoyed the flavor, especially with the mustardy yellow sauce. A spicy green ají sauce was also included.

Lunch specials are offered Monday through Friday from 11am to 3pm, and breakfast on the weekends features traditional dishes like tamales. Order your meal and pay at the counter.

But Perú Chicken is worth every minute of it.

This is my new go-to for reasonably priced & overly delicious roasted chicken. There are just the right amount of items to choose from on the menu. My favorite being the 1/2 chicken with rice & beans - and usually a side a fried yucca too. YUM. However, in the spirit of keto, this time I opted in for 1/2 chicken with a salad. The chicken was beautifully seasoned and perfectly cooked. There was once that I stopped by & my chicken was undercooked - I honestly just ate around that part. It was too good to stop eating. The portions are always generous and the food is always great!

Wait times can vary so I always try my best to call ahead. On my most recent trip, I called in a pick-up order (arrived 15 minutes later) and still had to wait for an additional 10 minutes. Granted, it was during lunch time and during the World Cup (which they featured in the restaurant).

Ever since Inka Si Senor on Maryland Parkway and Che Inka Chicken on Rainbow closed down, I've been on a search for legit Peruvian spots. Located in the same strip mall as Cuba Cafe on Tropicana. This family run business is a hole in the wall, but that's where you find some of the most tastiest bites around!

We entered the restaurant and the dining area was packed with people gettin' their FIFA on (12-15 people...I think about 16-18 people is the maximum capacity)The tables and counter area was full except for one spot.....a two top in the HALLWAY  on the way to the restrooms. At this point, we didn't care and we were hungry so we ordered up right away. We started off with a Chicken Tamale, and Wifey's favorite Papa A la Huancaina. The gentlemen brings a bottle of green sauce to our table, and I squirt it on to my first bite of the tamale, and in the process, scorch a few of my tastebuds only to find out that it was the more fiery Salsa de Huacatay. Luckly I was able to extinguish the inferno in my mouth with some tasty Inca Kola. The tamale was a bit on the dry side and stingy on the chicken, the papas were the better of the two apps with all that cheesy goodness.

It was also National Ceviche Day as Amanda M. had mentioned,(What a co-inky- dink!) and that is another dish I haven't had in a while, so we had planned on getting an order of the Ceviche de Pescado and their speciality, a 1/4 chicken with rice. The Ceviche is presented with a very generous portion of marinated sea bass(not sure if the fish selection changes), red onion, sweet potato, hominy(I think),  toasted corn, and lots of leche de tigre(the liquid that comes from marinating the fish with the lime juice) great flavors and textures in this dish.(Definitely making this one at home too!) The chicken arrived with a side of beans and Jasmine rice which was pretty dry, but that chicken was juicy and delicious. That Aji Verde though...I almost killed the entire bottle! Can't wait to get all the ingredients so I can have my own supply at home. I'd definitely return for the chicken, and hopefully save room for some of the desserts.  ALOHA!!!

Ceviche de pescado, le faltaba algo pero no puedo describirlo, quizas mas aji o no se. Choclo casi contado y la cancha estaba buena.
Arroz con pollo, era pollo verde y arroz. Thats it. Nada de sabor. Mi esposa pidio limon para ayudar a cocinar la salsa criolla porque estaba solo cortada y sin pasarla por agua fria.
Chaufa de pollo, la estrella de la noche. Bien sazonado, el aji verde le caia perfecto al chaufa. De ahi comimos todos.
Pan con chicharron y camote. Lo siento por todos los que vean esto, pero a mi me queda mucho mejor. Estaba seco el chancho y otra vez la cebolla. Mas limon por favor. 

Terminamos todo con los picarones. Estos estaban perfectos y su miel de higo estaba que me lo tomaria en te.

I have eaten Peruvian twice in LA but was looking for something good here.  I ordered at the counter and then sat at one of the 2 tops they have in this small restaurant.  Seating for 18--3 two tops and 3 four tops.

My order was for Tallarin verde con bistec, an order of fried plantains, and picarones for dessert.  With this, I had passion fruit for my beverage.

The order was brought in a timely manner.  The steak was nicely done and sliced thin and was accompanied by the pesto/basil thick spaghetti.  The hot green Peruvian sauce was great!  I almost put the bottle in my pocket to take with me.  The lighter sauce tasted good but had no kick.  The fried plantains were very good.  I've always liked them andPeru Chicken did not let me down.

The picarones for dessert were wonderful--too big of an order for one--but I don't like to waste food so I finished the whole amount.  Picarones are pumpkin and sweet potato doughnuts served with drizzled chancaca, a South American sweet sauce made with raw sugar and honey.  The picarones had been drizzled with the chancaca and there was much left at the bottom to dip the remaining pieces.

Service was very pleasant.  This is a mom and pop operation and they were both very pleasant.  This is a must return place if only for some more tallarin verde!",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,13,12,4,swTmLFqNNBbt88u0K8bZ7A

After a couple visits, I have some favorite orders: The Pollo con Arroz y Frijoles (Whole rotisserie chicken with rice and beans) and Arroz Chaufa (Fried Rice). The chicken is amazing and don't miss out on their housemade sauces! The yellow and green sauces have kick, so watch out! Six days a week, you'll get long-grain white rice, but on Saturdays, you get Arroz Verde (sometimes you have to ask for it, but make sure you do!) and you really, really want the Green Rice. It's so darn good that you'll be rather disappointed on the other days of the week. I looove the Fried Rice with beef. It's so, so flavorful. I almost always get an order of the Papas Fritas (Fries) as well because, well, FRIES.

I'm usually too full to get to dessert, but this time, I made sure to save some room. So, I finally tried the Picarones ($5.50), donuts made with pumpkin and sweet potato. It's served with Chancaca, a syrup made with panela, an unrefined cane sugar, plus orange peel, cloves, and star anise. Delicious and savory!

Salad is basic, consisting of what seems to be iceberg letuce, tomato slices, cucumber with a raspberry vinagerette dressing (overly oiley with less than enough raspberry).
Green, spicy sauce that reminds me of wasabi a little. Yellow sause is buttery and less viscous than green sause, also not spicy. Goes well with the chicken, especially the dry chicken, makes it more moist in the mouth.

I caught a quick glance of Peru Chicken out of the corner of my eye while driving in this part of town and decided to bookmark it for later. I'm actually glad that I did because this place really did not disappoint!

The interior is pretty small. It has a few seats for eating in, but can get a little crazy when the store is full.  

One of the entrees I ordered was the tallarin verde con bistec (which I pretty much butchered when I was saying it for my order LOL) which consisted of the green pesto noodles, slices of steak, and a mini potato spud.  

The steak was so soft and melt-in-your-mouth. I was pretty satisfied that these tender bits of meat were packed with savory flavor. They're cooked to perfection and will leave your tastebuds wanting more.  

The potato was small but it's a much needed, hearty carbohydrate that complimented the dish well. It was very soft, which is the perfect consistency to enjoy with the steak slices.

The tallarin noodles were pretty bomb, too! I didn't know that pesto pasta would be the perfect match with steak and potatoes! Green is my favorite color, so naturally I had to give this dish a try... The noodles were cooked perfectly. They were firm, but not undercooked and hard.

I also had the 1/4 chicken and their rice. The chicken was pretty amazing. It's cooked rotisserie style, so the flavors are all there. It wasn't dry on the inside, either. It was juicy and tender throughout the whole piece I was given. The rice (I'm guessing it's basmati rice since the grains were long and slender) wasn't mushy and wet, it was firm and very flavorful. I feel like you could eat this rice by itself because it's that good.

Don't be shy on the sauces! The lighter green of the two is creamy and will pair perfectly with pretty much anything you order (but goes best with the chicken, obviously). If you prefer a spicy kick to your food, go for the darker green sauce.

Inca Kola is sold here and it's the perfect beverage to have when eating this kind of chicken and sides (like plantains and yucca). It's basically liquid candy gold because it tastes like bubblegum and has a pretty color to it!

It's worth the trip here and I will definitely be a repeat customer for sure.",QtGXr3Y74fnWfdWpGJIldw,9,11,5,KueLP44d4IcOK3c_d5GxUQ

5679777,2017-05-12,1,dlNMXG9-BWsPGom0_lCCNQ,"I had the 1/4 rotisserie chicken with rice and beans and fried plantains. Hey it's rotisserie chicken, nothing amazing but it was pretty good and flavorful. A step up from grocery store rotisserie and flamed El pollo loco. The seasoning on the chicken wasn't very bold, didn't stand out at all. Used both the green and yellow sauces and they were absolutely delicious and made the entire meal. The basmati rice was alright until I used the sauces on it and it was great. Pricing was good. Service amazing. Very friendly people. Not a lot of seating, I was lucky to get the last table. It's a great alternative to fast food junk and the food came out just as fast. I'd go again if I was in the area and needed something somewhat healthy and fast. The plantains were ok, ive had better. But $2 for a plate of it-good values",IPlLcdNG426qOopHH4EwkQ,1,1,3,0FFSIG2jAWzJ2CIPq38TXw

The chicken is delicious and goes well with the sauces and everything we ordered was pretty damn good. This will definitely be my go to spot for chicken and rice. Only caveat, service is slow as molasses. Seriously, with how small this place is there is no reason for it to be that slow. What should have been a 30 minute lunch was made to be an hour due to the service. But don't let that deter you, just get it to go or set aside some extra time.",09Jn_afJxwZ20eukds1nxA,0,0,4,hxbM5EFpUmCyzRGZ0DkBjA

I loved the fact that the owner himself checked on us a couple times, making sure everything was good and we had what we needed. It shows he cares about his customers and in return his business gets supported.   Our waitress was on top of things too. We will definitely be back",X_liEerKb33-EogeagGqzQ,0,1,5,A_fsYRBntqruQVID1gDG4A

The chicken is seasoned to perfection.  I had the breasts which is usually the driest part and when my gf and I cut into the breast, it was juicy and had a pink lining showing that the chicken was smoked for a long period of time.  The anticuchos were perfect and even the fried plantains were creamy on the inside with a nice burnt crisp and caramelization on the out.  This is a must stop if you're in Vegas. Oh, and don't forget to pick up an order of the picarones.  They're Peruvian style donuts that are difficult to make and this place nailed it perfectly.",sQU2BnusfiSJN5M-ncS_Mw,2,1,5,Bx2S0B7fts-6mNHHVwsZ6A

We were not the only people to walk out.  

I would give a higher rating because one of the employees was super sweet (the other one was visibly mad when the first couple walked out and threw down the menus) but, again, there was no chicken at ""Peru Chicken.""",byV70bKT87SHgN0uRtow6w,0,0,1,gYaEMZbtHSiEziB4bjE98w

The staff were very helpful and friendly in telling us what was on the menu.  The food came quickly.

They do have a few different types if Inca Cola for those who like their chicken with a side of bubblegum.

We enjoyed it and will definitely be back to try something new.",shBEMbvhDv2spo1o4J29Yg,0,3,4,Rx9zhF5c6TrghfLd9IV2ug

Both had good flavors and in a really nice sized portion. It was at decent prices from $9-11. Not bad, really.

As soon as we walked in, we knew we were in a good spot because the joint was small with only a handful of tables - and there was soccer playing on the TV. If you see soccer on TV, that counts towards a seal of authenticity towards south american food. Just sayin'

We ordered peruvian chicken with rice and beans, as well as the chicken salad sandwich and the grilled pork sandwich. The chicken, not suprisingly, was delicious. Well marinated, flavorful, soft and tender. Delicious with the rice and beans. My tummy was beyond satisfied.",Rpulkl8mv12Qcmehmngx4A,0,0,5,LfIHJouHtopWqP0S2W0b9w

Ordenamos papa a la huancaina, anticuchos, ceviche, tamal, arroz chaufa, lomo saltado, de postre helado de lucuma y picarones...
Nuestros preferidos fueron el ceviche, el pescado muy fresco y lo dan con choclo peruano como debe ser. Los anticuchos tienen un sabor muy rico, al lomo le faltó un poquito de juguito pero buen sabor. Todo estuvo muy rico y todo económico y bien servido. 
Este será el lugar que siempre iré cada vez q este en Las Vegas. 
P.D. Tienen chocman!!!! En muchos restaurantes he encontrado diferentes chocolates pero nunca chocman!
Están a $1 compre 5 y mi tia igual, aunque a ella le dieron uno extra (me deben uno jajajajaja) 
Todo muy bueno, muy recomendado. 
La cuenta de la comida incluido 2 chichas y una inca salió alrededor de $80!!!!!!!!! La verdad nunca nos fijamos del precio y pensamos que iba a salir como 150$ jaja! Pero no!!!! Bueno, en pocas palabras, bueno, bonito y barato :D 
Gracias!!!!!",_wCWsMPJ--p7ge0bYxZSww,1,1,5,NXs5rJwgVMO_wDgnD37hMQ
