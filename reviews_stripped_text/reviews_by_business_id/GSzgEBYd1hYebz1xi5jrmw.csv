8266,2015-06-30,0,GSzgEBYd1hYebz1xi5jrmw,Called in a pizza the guy took my order over the phone and said it would be ready in 15 minutes. Walked into the store and the guy that took my order said that it wasn't ready that he couldn't find my order made me wait an extra 20 minutes for my pizza. Horrible service not reliable and didn't feel appreciated or welcomed at all.,zj8ulrRi68FGKLiv9rdmGg,2,0,1,g2K9Wfdn62EGPKi-vFbYHQ

I've had a few deliveries that took awhile longer than I anticipated, but lately it's been quick and easy with no problems.  Pizza arrives hot most of the time. I can only think of one time that my pizza arrived NOT the way I ordered it.  That will happen.  But for the most part, food is fast, tasty, hot upon arrival and the delivery drivers are super cheerful and friendly.",TnhTyk1qfJ8jL2bHpeTrhQ,1,0,5,MXPSlojNAgCGCXXety86Bg

Weekdays you can usually get a deal that competes with their competitor, sure it might be a dollar more, but its worth it.

But mainly, we tipped our driver $3 and went to get an additional $4 for him. When we walked back over with the money and handed it to him, he said ""I hope you know Jesus walks on water, and you don't."" He then grabbed the money and walked off. I don't know what point he was getting across but it definitely offended the guests in my house. I then called to let the manager know, and she did not seem to have a care in the world about what her employee had done either. I'm extremely bothered by the way this matter was handled!",EZucyarUrg6fvM2gPcLkIg,0,0,1,5lF9uYC_dPrWk3uqMj9mdQ

2241212,2014-03-25,1,GSzgEBYd1hYebz1xi5jrmw,"I discovered this Domino's Pizzas a while back tucked away inside a Sinclair/7-11 gas station and finally remembered to check it out. I placed an order online during the March Madness basketball games this weekend and was given a 14 min ETA. When I arrived at the store about 15 min later, my pizza was done as promised so I paid and was on my way back to continue watching basketball. 

I ordered a medium Honolulu Hawaiian pan pizza and the 1st thing I noticed when holding the box was that it was a little heavier than usual. When I opened the box I was pleased to find a pizza that was covered in a generous amount of toppings that put other pizza chains to shame. Well that explains why the box was so heavy! Overall the pizza was tasty although some parts of the crust could've used a few more min of cook time since it still tasted a little doughy

This location is smaller and inside a gas station so only carry-out is available, no deliveries. They are running a special where you can get menu items for $5.99 each (including medium 2 topping pizzas) as long as you order 2 or more from that list",zBi_JWB5uUdVuz3JLoAxGQ,1,1,4,Xc0ERXYwYjpzj_XAIktF1A

Although I couldn't give full 5 stars and that's not the store fault, its Dominos as a company. they would not allow a gift card purchase on the Dominos App. Still pizza is always tasty and delivery is always earlier than expected!",i5J6T_uHlnGATdZaDzhWcg,0,0,4,r3H_QqaJNDfoK7Vsn0EqMw
2618259,2015-09-07,1,GSzgEBYd1hYebz1xi5jrmw,"Placed a pick up order tonight for two medium pizzas. Pizzas were ready in about 15 minutes while I waited. I was pleasantly surprised by the tasty crust. The cornmeal and the buttery topping added to it is what made the difference. I know Domino's had worked diligently to change its flavor and guest perception of its product. They have certainly come along way in the crust department. Cheese is always a scarcity when you are pushing  low cost as your sales driver. 

Another surprise at this location is they have a dining room, small but serviceable if you want to enjoy your meal hot and fresh. This is rare for a primarily pizza delivery concept. 

Service here was average as expected.  Overall experience was good and pizza did the trick to feed the bellies of the fam. I might actually come back here again by the end of the year.",8fsZcLADFrPTbGrFqMACpg,2,1,3,dyEcXFXjpubEEwpASSr0CA

They are actually decent and if you get the pizza with different toppings, they are pretty good. But what i like about this store is that they have FAST delivery!! It takes them usually 30 mins to deliver, and I'm impressed with that! Come here for good pizza and fast delivery services!!",e-0zEgp_EK9oBbyQpyI71w,0,0,4,4TxpVdS9ktR78XXmGYDk1Q

The staff are very helpful with getting you great deals and providing exceptional customer service every time. 
Delivery typically takes 30 minutes, it arrives on time or early. 
The pizza is always fresh and they don't skimp on the toppings. 
This dominos has a dining area so you and your family, or friends can eat there.

Order looked like the cook realized ""Hey someone is actually going to eat this"" not just like it was thrown together to get it out of the way! Time was extremely fast. Driver ""Marc"" was actually personable and very nice. I could hang with this guy! And to my surprise I actually received the Marinara I ordered. This is a first for sure. Thank You guys!

4958840,2018-03-17,0,GSzgEBYd1hYebz1xi5jrmw,"The expectations for what you get at Dominos are fairly low. Their business model is high volume and solid value. (As long as you stick to the coupons and promotions.) 
Tonight I had a house full of kids,who until they are 25 will continue to think Domino's is great.  So I ordered a togo order on line, paid on line, went to go get my pizza. They were mobbed, i had to wait 5 minutes in the pick up line, so i left without checking the contents of the 4 stacked boxes.
Three out of 4 were correct, but there was no plain cheese. I called and was told they would remake me a plain pie. 
I get it, Friday night, 100s of orders, minimum wage employees, there are going to be errors.  What chaps me is that they seem so accustom to it.
It was 45 minutes from the time i got home the first time to the time i got back with the redo. Totally ruined the flow of dinner and my family time.
No apology, no offer to deliver the redo, no mention of it at all.
My recommendation is DiGorno. This location is a hot mess.",wHM4uoPAh02K-RrDjiThXg,0,0,2,PFpwjB0IH8Bw1IYpgjmaJQ

I opened the pasta which was nearly empty, over cooked and tini bits of chicken. The sandwich was was soggy, greasy and I cannot describe what it tasted like. Definitly not a philly cheese sandwich! I immediately called, Dasia answered.Said she asked manager Jesse. Claims Jesse said he made my meal and it was correct , and would not do anything for me. I said I'd love to send a pic. She continued to argue. She said she could make a new one with no guarantees as to when it could be delivered. I asked for the top manager . She would not divulge the name. I insisted in at least a credit in the pasta due to the lack thereof and disgrace. I have ordered this plenty from another location, I knew what to expect.

Always use the Domino's App because ordering makes it a lot easier and also if you get 10 pizzas, you get a free pizza! Ordered our usual to see how they would compare to the other location; a cheesesteak sandwich with extra meat, a medium pizza (special if you order a medium with 2 toppings), and the Specialty Chicken with bacon and mozzarella cheese with sweet barbecue sauce. Everything we ordered was made well! Not skimping on anything. Only reason I order extra meat in the cheesesteak because I do not like onions or green peppers!Still, a great sandwich and definitely would recommend this location!",i4eQXKpWn7E-SU0wDAHEMA,0,0,4,--84O1fH79hd-JTgpS4pkQ
