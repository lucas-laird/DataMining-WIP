Anyway, we happened to be there during the 08 summer Olympics and you would think some of those events would have been playing on the TVs, but again, not so.

I however was not able to get this wi-fi to work, I don't know if it was due to some configuration or firewall on my laptop or what.  But the directions they give to access it were not helpful, nor were any of the employees who acted like they didn't know what an internet was, so be forewarned.

I've been to the one in Anaheim a few times and had a pleasant experience. This one, eh not so much. We were seated in the one room that has tiny TVs in the corner, and our waitress had too many tables. The food however was delish! We had the tailgate sampler, there was food for days! Three of us shared it and still had some leftover. I don't recommend you go there for fine cuisine.

Q: How can you go wrong with this place?
A: You really can't. Delicious burgers. Televisions all over the place playing the ""big game"" and delicious burgers. Did I mention burgers? God, I love burgers.

Q: Isn't it a tad pricey?
A: Y'know, it's actually not *that* bad considering you're in Vegas. Sure, you can pop over to O'Shea's for a Dollar O'Hotdog but that's waaaaay far away if you're already down at New York New York.

Q: It's a bit smaller than I thought!
A: That's not a question but I agree. It was certainly smaller than the ESPN Zone at Downtown Disney in Anaheim, CA.

FYI ... This is a great spot to stop by for a quick bite during your quick trip into Las Vegas to see U2 and it'll fill you up long enough to not want anymore food when you have to turn around and drive back to San Diego the same night.",jjHcf6XWMU7LmOEeUc9dqA,1,1,4,HuI8etgpYnsScjdZzw3KTQ

I came here with a group of friends during my Vegas trip in the summer.  There were only 2 sports enthusiasts out of the 7 of us (I was not one of them).  The food is okay, I don't know why but I was expecting a little more from ESPN Zone.  I got a cheese steak sandwich & it came with a lot of meat, and a whole lot of cheese.. some mushrooms & onions, but all I could taste was a whole lot of cheese & some meat..I love cheese but this was too much...and it was the greasiest cheese steak I ever ate.  

Me & the other b-day girl were surprised with a Strawberry Shortcake each, & a ghetto ""b-day candle,"" which was a lighter that our waiter held up for us to blow out.  The dessert which was not complimentary, was definitely better than my entree.  

As I said, we came here for our sports enthusiast friends, so I wouldn't come back by choice; this place is probably just better for getting some drinks and appetizers to watch over a game, not an actual meal.

The food was actually not bad. But nothing spectacular. I usually list everything off but I'm not going to b/c that's all you really need to know. It's bar food. 

The service actually is not good. The waiter even gave my mother attitude when she asked him about a drink. He might not have heard her b/c the place is loud but attitude was not necessary. 

The TV at the table was pretty cool. They have all these different feeds and you can chose what you want to watch. We were however having some volume issues.
