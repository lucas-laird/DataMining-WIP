 I ordered a Guacamole Bacon Six - Dollar Burger small combo.  What I got was something like a burger with cheese and a slice of rubbery bacon.  It was not good, but was sustenance so it did its most base of jobs.  The taste however was not great, I should have waited the 20 minutes for a 1+ pound of tasty burrito...  Oh well.  

 AND - the paper towels were gone in their sad, pathetic excuse of a bathroom. No one likes washing hands and then having nothing but toilet paper or your jeans to dry your hands on.

 Listen to me -  go to Chipotle and save yourself the trouble of Carl's JR.  Not worth it.",dI1xL1mipCf4MXj9_BRcuw,0,0,2,-JNht6MAh-kKbSeJ_fIoOw

Actually, last time I went, I tried to convinve myself not to order the Chili Cheese Fries. About five minutes after I completed my order, I saw a picture of the fries and changed my mind. They are good. Got a shake too. Those pictures get me every time. I also liked the banana shake and the mint oreo shake.",bdxLZk_VKPMwv2H-SpjNoA,0,0,5,JAN8uMN3n2tE-nRduYcHnw

After eating all of the fine foods of Vegas, sometimes you just want to do a little low budg meal for lunch. We were starting to get hungry so we swung by CJ. We opted to try their new Big Carl, which was okay, but it will NEVER be a Big Mac. 

So, let me tell you about Jalapeño Woman. She must work around here and frequent the joint because she was chummy with the workers even though you could tell they couldn't stand her. Well, the line moves up a bit and she turns around and goes ballistic because SOMEONE took her JALAPEÑOS! Heaven forbid. 1. Who gets their condiments ready before even ordering? 2. Well, there's no 2 because 1 means you take them with you as you wait for your order.  Anyhow, every person that joined the line had to hear about it. And she even added that it was so disgusting because THEY don't know where HER hands have been. Really? I don't want to know why YOUR nasty ass hands are in the condiment bar then. GROSS! And she was just all around weird because she ordered a cheeseburger but she wanted it all completely separate so that she could put it together when she got back to work. *shaking head*

Once we get our order, which was 2 Big Carl Combos to our table, we're missing a burger. How do you forget a burger? I went to mention it to the guy, who was apologetic, but it was still a bit weird.

We were sitting next to two USPS carriers on their lunch and mid-meal the male carrier's cell phone rings and, loud enough for the whole place to hear, screams (in a non-joking way), ""WHAT THE F*#%^ DO YOU WANT?!"" He then makes mention of him being at lunch and hangs up. Ummmm... okay.

The place was relatively clean. It's the clientele that makes it a bit dirrrrrrrrty!",5zzP3HvPaGjtVYiIvRd6Mg,1,1,2,WmoNy6PcweeLDOyO2cpvrQ
