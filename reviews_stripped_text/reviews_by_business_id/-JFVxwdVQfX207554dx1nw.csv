I call in the order over the phone AND notified the girl that answered that I will be using a groupon- she said that's fine just present at the register at pick up. Upon picking up my order the girl now doesn't know how to ring it up so her coworker says oh we don't accept groupon. I said well isn't that something that should have been Disclosed when I placed my order and stated I had a groupon? His attitude was horrible - he didn't care if I left the food do to their mistake. I figured I was dealing with people that did not have basic education so I requested the manager. Well not to my surprise, he was even worse. He said all I can do is charge you for two drinks and give you one bowl free. The math came out to me paying double  what I would have originally. I paid for the two drinks and didn't even take the cups, it's the principle. I will never, nor my family, and I will inform co workers to not go here. This place is not worth my money.

1566458,2007-06-27,0,-JFVxwdVQfX207554dx1nw,"I went to Teriyaki Madness after a workout.  It's in the same shopping center/strip mall as my 24 Hour Fitness, so it's in a great location for those wanting to scarf down some protein and/or carbs.  I was kind of skeptical because it's not Samurai Sam's (the best teriyaki chicken bowl place on the planet imho) but the windows displayed those ""voted best in las vegas"" signs, so I figured I'd give it a whirl.

Service is what you would expect from the guy who's just there to work the register - pretty non-existent.  You just walk up to the counter, give your name, your order, pay and go sit down.  I got the chicken breast teriyaki bowl.  This comes with LOTS of chicken, steamed white rice and teriyaki sauce.   That's it.  I also picked up a bottle of Powerade Option, the availability of which was a pleasant surprise.  The total came to just over 8 bucks.  There was also the minor annoyance of a 35-cent surcharge to use my debit card.

After waiting what seemed like nearly 10 minutes for my order, I finally got a chance to eat.  First of all, they put next to no teriyaki sauce on my bowl.  Just barely enough to dampen the chicken.  I actually had to use soy sauce later on with my remaining rice the teriyaki was so scarce.  The chicken seemed genuinely cooked as the exterior was downright crispy during some bites.  But once you got down to business, it was quite rubbery.  Not good.

Odds and ends:  The place is relatively small.  Just a few tables surrounded by barstool/wall counter seating.  Plenty of reading material such as the Las Vegas Weekly to keep your mind occupied as the food is cooked.  Oh, and big ups to selling Powerade Option.  A con that's certainly not exclusive to Teriyaki Madness is those debit card receipts that ask you to put down a tip.  I feel guilty not giving one, even though it's for service that doesn't deserve it.  But I digress.

All in all, I'm sticking to Samurai Sam's for my teriyaki fix.  I wouldn't return to this place unless I was starving and the Subway next door was closed.",On_1ZwRgD2Ry0eoKYC29iQ,3,2,2,CuRpRvKas7A-gFh-b15bSA

This is probably my favorite location in town.  The staff is always friendly and helpful, and the food quality is consistently delicious.  And, of course, their signature teriyaki sauce is some sort of magical, legal drug that you can't get enough of.

Recently they've introduced a salmon teriyaki bowl for $8 or $9, and it's good!  I'm not sure if it's for a limited time or not, but whatever salmon they get is delicious - no funny tastes and a hearty portion.

You can also ask for your veggies on the side - they will put them in a nice little to-go container.  This is good if you order chicken katsu and don't want it to get soggy.

Paleo/watching your carbs?  Ask them to nix the rice and double up on veggies.  They're cool about that.",N5URmpyygDBSC_8UShI_6Q,3,2,4,QomsiXuVUZdcCUlVEjxhTA

I am in LOVE! This is it! THIS is what I've been looking for since I moved out to Las Vegas almost 7 years ago!

All of these other Teriyaki places I've been checking out have been alright, but nothing spectacular. Certainly nothing to warrant a repeat visit. That all changed a couple of hours ago!

This location is just south of Silverado Ranch Blvd on Maryland Parkway right in front of the 24 hours Fitness. After my workout today at that 24, I decided to finally check this place out, so I walked across the parking lot and walked inside. The place was on the smaller side and pretty close to fully occupied. Thats a good sign that they offer a good product. I placed my order for a Chicken Teriyaki bowl, they took my name, and I had a seat. Less than 5 minutes later I had my food.

And...WOW! Perfect! Alot of juicy, tasty meat over a solid bowl full of white rice with teriyaki sauce poured over it! YUMMY! Best part, no pesky veggies to get in the damn way! Hell yea! That bowl never stood a chance! 

Prices were incredibly reasonable. I will most certainly be back for multiple visits! Hell, I may even go back today! Damn that was good!

The macaroni salad however, was not, and I was quite disappointed. The coolness of the macaroni salad against the spicy of the chicken is my favorite part of the meal. Based on my most recent meal, this TM location doesn't know how to maintain a recipe. I spoke with a Mgr. named Jose who told me they hadn't changed the recipe but they did change the mayonnaise they use. To me it tasted like less mayo had been used and more celery had been added... whatever it was, it wasn't pleasing to my palate. After calling the location to inquire about a changed recipe, I understand why customers come here to vent.

Ordered presented coupon on phone from mobile app and they said they can't accept it and numerous people have been coming in with that coupon. Good customer service would first of all accepted the coupon they agreed to issue, second have it removed immediately from the mobile valpak add which you use on your phone and don't print and in the mean time post a sign at register identifying problem with not accepting coupon. It's like a retail store almost pulling a bait and switch, if you won't honor something you stop the production of it.

  Today, there was a girl at the counter who took my order.  The set up for their menu has recently changes and it threw me off a little bit.  I was feeling a bit adventurous and decided to get something ptjer than my usual. I asked the girl if the Plate came with Macaroni Salad and she said ""Yes"". So, I ordered the chicken katsu plate, she asked if I wanted white or brown rice, I said white rice of course. So I waited for my good and it too about 10 min for it to come out.  I didn't even check the order because I never had an issue with this place before. I got my good home and opened it up, no macaroni salad.  I was on my lunch hour and didn't have time to go back for the macaroni salad that she said came with the plate. 

This place used to be my favorite place, and o used to come here once a week. But it just seems to have lost it's way recently.",Yy0CAv2eIy-X1BDbtzXykQ,0,0,3,EoDJdjaCuNWHVd8atMGMmQ

Do not waste your money! Go across the street to McDonald's or anywhere else but here!,cb6PC0KrU9OFClNkPOGy8Q,0,0,1,XBH8RFljJNSYAIqez-ZZBQ

The person conducting the interview (we are assuming is the manager) was talking so loudly we could hear the entire thing no matter where we sat. He was asking some personal questions and talked about how, ""Training is only two days man you can do it, I mean come on? Come on?"" This was only part of it and didn't seem very professional. It made it hard to have a conversation. The employees working seemed almost scared... weird environment. When we asked questions about the menu we never really got a straight of helpful answer. Half way through the meal the ""manager"" pulled aside a guy who was being trained and started talking/yelling at the same volume about the different menu options. It just seems like there is a better way/place to handle this. The music was also not edited, we heard a few f words during our experience, not the most family friendly. The food was good but probably won't return to this location.",3N6bPrw9ureW5ONXysdtnQ,0,0,2,emEbmwpJoMpTWpGFH2ptrQ

Rice was saturated in sauce and beef was pretty fatty, but thankfully it was cut really thin so it wasn't that bad. Ok for quick meat/rice bowls on the go, I would say.",1yA117LUO9TJyeJxeKm8iA,0,0,3,5BppL1G_Jn7ZW5oRRRMF8w

I have always had a great experience with the cashiers and the service has been friendly in my opinion.,6NYDXzkyYW3O2zYjzPRMsg,1,1,4,sZL99fVzRyHmNf5oPjpFsA
