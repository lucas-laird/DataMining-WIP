270274,2017-01-18,0,R_LcZEX_Ua4JnC3CFg_ZmQ,Easily the best PT's location in Las Vegas! Sarena is the best bartender that you'll ever come by! She's literally the reason we always come to this bar because she's so personable and friendly with everyone that steps inside those doors! The bar is always kept in good condition and doesn't wreak of cigarettes like most of the other locations!,WsVXuGF4UmKevU0UaHCeBQ,1,1,5,8FE73pTzFSF1zu6OdW76-Q

I was still looking for a great option for breakfast and low and behold I found myself at PT's at Post Road and 215 (near Sunset, west of the 215).  I know that it was converted to a PT's not that long ago and this was my first visit.  We were instantly welcomed by Serena who gave us great service and friendly conversation during our visit.  We (2 people) ordered breakfast and were presented absolutely perfect plates of bacon, eggs, and omelet goodness by our cook, Kevin.  He later walked through the area after delivering another order and after we told him how good it was, he responding that he was just doing his job.  PT's has to wonderful employees with Sererna and Kevin.  And to top it off, PTs has breakfast specials!  What a deal! Serena and Kevin are the kind of staff that keep the customers coming back over and over.  Keep up the good work and this is my new go to place for breakfast!",hoPxifs-SpmdsoFPKhS-dg,2,1,5,lR4DYBvHVkNtO9IkQbSLsw
853130,2017-12-17,0,R_LcZEX_Ua4JnC3CFg_ZmQ,"So I was trying to find a customer Service email address online but can't find one so here it is. My boyfriend and I, along with a couple friend of ours (4 of us total) went here last night for the first time. The atmosphere was nice and Jodi was nice enough as well. We started ordering drinks and about 3 in we all realized our drinks were crazy weak, and asked the bartender (Jodi) to top us off, which she did. So we all order about one more drink each, still pretty disappointed in how weak the drinks had been originally. My boyfriend and his friend had each played about $10 a piece on the machines- no complimentary drinks. Then we get the bill and see that an automatic $16 gratuity was added. For a ""large party"". I didn't realize our party of 4 people could be considered large, not to mention each couple paid separately. On top of that, $16 is nearly 25% on a $67 tab which is ridiculous. We live so nearby but I can't imagine coming back for crazy overpriced service and Under poured drinks. So disappointed.",jiHXGBuZpwkQU-RA1-zoPw,0,0,1,90w_m3fplTNx35xKBOTS2Q

I always thought you play in the machines you get comped on drinks. I put in a couple of 20's and even bought nachos and my mom played in the machine as well, and still got charged for drinks. I asked the bartender why I wasn't  comped and she said because I wasn't playing max. I have never heard that BS before.

I went there with my wife for our anniversary, to do a Pant Night... I was very impressed with the overall experience. 

The reason they received 4 out of 5 Stars, was the fact that it's very difficult to get in and out of the parking lot. 

The bar tenders were great! Quick to serve, friendly, and very efficient! I was very impressed that they remembered my name very quickly! 

The layout of the bar was very cool! It's an open floor plan, with an outdoor balcony, and private area!

The bar was also very clean in all areas! I was especially impressed with the bathrooms.

The food was uniform to any other PT's. We ordered the Pretzel Bites... The only difference I noticed, was that my regular PT's is better at presentation. 

I would definitely go to this location again.",VNYmMD-TYQM0qXdrA_Omhg,1,0,4,Stl66LiuPBWEibKzgKkmPA
1960675,2017-06-27,0,R_LcZEX_Ua4JnC3CFg_ZmQ,"As I'm noticing from the reviews, I'm far from the only one that feels a little frustrated about the service that I received from this particular PT's Gold location. I have been to several other locations but have NEVER had such a bad experience. I went to this particular location on June 23rd with a friend and during that time (around 5:30- 6pm) it was surprisingly slow, not busy at all. We however, still received mediocre service, our waitress was far from attentive to taking our orders initially. My co-worker and I both ordered drinks at which time the bartender/waitress tasted both drinks using ""one straw"" which she flipped to taste.  I've been to SEVERAL bars, restaurants, etc., and NEVER has a ""trained bartender"" had to taste my drink, yet left that to me, the patron to confirm what if anything my drink needed or not. Not only is this not sanitary but unprofessional. If every bartender making drinks had to ""taste"" their own product, there would be a world of sick individuals from the spread of germs. Some of the better bars and restaurants that I've been to also ask which type of Vodka's preferred in the particular drink that I ordered. This was not asked by the waitress, which I get it is PT's Gold. Apparently there is justification for this by their standards. In no way should there be a wait for plain water if the place isn't busy. Not attentive at all. Lesson learned. If you want a quick drink, minus great service, this is the place for you. If you're perhaps used to quality this may not be the place for you. Not speaking of ALL PT's just this one. I've been to most here in Las Vegas. POOR service.",jWxj6Vs5xz1bL-bgzLvPQQ,2,0,1,WwLgNLw7d3aPE9akd_r13g
2241262,2014-02-07,0,R_LcZEX_Ua4JnC3CFg_ZmQ,"Stopped by for their grand opening last night and had a great night. Never been to a PT's before so I figured this was a perfect opportunity to check it out, even though it was far SW. Apparently this place used to be an O'Aces tavern, but you would've never guessed it because the inside looked brand new and was not smoky at all. We arrived at 7 pm, about an hour late for the event and it was already packed inside! So packed that it took a while to squeeze into the bar area to place drink orders. Eventually we were able to track down a waitress to take care of us the rest of the night, otherwise there would've been a lot of waiting at the bar!

They had a couple specials going on including $2 Stellas and $1 vodka or tequila shots...which were kinda gross, but hey it was only a buck! The gf had a couple of signature cocktails, which were full price but wasn't bad at $6-7.50 each. There were a couple of Stella girls promoting their beer and handing out gifts to people drinking Stellas. We got a Stella chalice glass and a bottle opener for pounding down Stella pints all night long.

The bar area is big, and there are non gaming seats for those that just want to have a drink or watch the game. There is also a small seating area to the right of the bar for dining and another dining area just to the left of the restrooms. Overall seems like a pretty nice place to hang, especially with the 2 pool tables and a small patio area with gas heaters, which is where we sat despite the light rain. The staff was friendly and fast once they actually got to you and I don't see it being as packed on normal nights here. 

They have happy hour from 5 to 7 PM and again later on in the evening, featuring 50% off drinks and pizzas, so I'll have to come back to check that out in the future!",zBi_JWB5uUdVuz3JLoAxGQ,2,1,5,hgUz8EktUgCzGqIb8omVMA

The food was excellent.  I had the French Dip.  My Mom had White chicken nuggets and tater tots and my sister had fish and chips.

Me and my co worker came here during happy hour, we both ordered lemon drop martinis and not once were we asked what type of vodka? Don't just assume someone wants the house vodka. One thing that threw me off about our bartender was the fact that she used a straw that went in her mouth to taste the drinks??? I've never seen a bartender test a drink like this before. Maybe this is something they practice at PT's? Anyway, I asked the lady what she did with the straw and she rudely responded ""Testing the drink"". Okay? This was so strange to me and the next morning I ended up with a sore throat and so did my co worker. On top of the unusual taste testing, the bartender was constantly on her phone texting and flirting with guys that were sitting on the other side of the bar. We asked for water and literally it took 20 minutes to get, did you go to a water well or something to get our water?

     Got a beer pretty quick, hence the two stars (Initial greet was quick). Feel like they are soo concerned with their switch over. 
     Most of staff kept skipping us- not even a look. Took 30 minutes & over half a beer to get a menu.
     Got better after the female bartenders left. Don't come right before switchover because I feel that the female bartenders can only concentrate on one thing at a time- smh.
     Later on the night, male bartender talks too much to one set of people. Ignores rest of the guest.

We were the only people there and the girl that served us was very nice. We have a family member in a nearby hospital so we decided to try this location. I ordered the omelette. It has 4 eggs and includes 2 toppings. You can add toppings at an additional cost. Egg whites are considered an additional filling which is kind of weird but I thought was worth the extra charge. The omelette and hash browns were very good. The coffee comes in a big cup and was pretty tasty too. The only downside is that it took quite a long time to get our food which was surprising since we were the only ones in the place.
