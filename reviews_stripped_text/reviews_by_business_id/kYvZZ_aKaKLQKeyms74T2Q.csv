Well,  unless you get the one ""grumpy"" waitress. We usually see her in during breakfast. Never smiles and seems to be upset she has to help us. This is not a one time ""Maybe she was having a bad day"" thing. She's always grumpy to us. This should not stop anyone from going here. Every other employee here is super nice and friendly. That's the only reason Grumpy is so noticeable. Who knows?  Maybe she just doesn't like the look of my face! Plus, you have to try the food here. The soups are amazing. Not just the small cup of fideo soup they bring before the entrée,  the dinner soups are the best. In fact, our family has never had a bad meal. Every time we go,  whatever we order is fantastic. The dining area and Restrooms are always clean. They even have live music. For an even better experience, try the table side guacamole or the flaming ice cream dessert. That's right, ""flaming!""  To sum up: One grumpy apple does not spoil the bunch. This outstanding restaurant gets Five well deserved stars!",SmuqmcoBmy2sYJmQF5yCZw,0,0,5,sI0Yxr-BTuRdVXSvmriQkQ

No need to ask for more chips/salsa/bean dip because they bring more before you are even done with what you have.

Another in our party got the Gallo al conaq (lemon and garlic), something I would have never ordered.as it sounded too simple.. but one bite changed that!

-Authentic Mexican food in a convenient area.
-Chips, salsa and sopa de fideo were great starters
-Camarones al mojo de ajo - excellent garlicky, buttery, lemony sauce and the shrimp were not overcooked (which many restaurants tend to do for some reason)
-Buey al Cilantro - steak was cooked medium and again this spicy green sauce was excellent
-Tasty margaritas - yes they push their margaritas with their house tequila, but they are worth it!

I cannot understand the 3/2/1 star reviews for this restaurant - it is a solid 4 as far as I'm concerned.

The steak fajita had almost no steak and was $19 for nothing.  The Red Snapper was quite good, but the sauce was as yucky as the salsa, bitter and not very spicy.

We were two adults and  3 kids. My wife and I ordered the Gallo mojo de ajo which is chicken with garlic gravy. The gravy has chunks of garlic which I love.  the chicken here is pounded thin which I like as well. The flour tortillas are thin and excellent and are served with the dish.

One of our kids split with us and two ordered of the kids menu. 

we also ordered the table side Guacamole. They come to the table and make it right there. They ask how spicy you want it. it was good.

802892,2014-01-03,1,kYvZZ_aKaKLQKeyms74T2Q,"Well where do I start? 

Service started out great. Even when the food was taking a bit long our waiter Noe came over and apologized and was very attentive. 

The food was ok. The pre-meal chips, beans and salsa had me excited about the meal. The margarita wasn't as strong as it should have been given it's large size but it was good. 

Our meal WAS going great until the large party arrived. This wasn't your average large party. No they brought little children approximately 8. Like between the ages of 2 and 6. Now I like children and can have patience when needed, within a certain limit. But when a child begins screaming, running and the parent is not even trying to control said child? But now remember I said children. At first it was just a little annoying, ""what's the sound interrupting my thoughts"" kind of annoying. But once you are aware of one screaming child it seems to amplify as the seconds go by. 

Interestingly enough we realized that the parties around us were starting to become annoyed. Then the wait staff, all fidgety and and looking annoyed yet too uncomfortable to say anything, avoiding eye contact with us as if hoping by ignoring the noise it would just stop. I began to channel my friend Brianna with the occasional ""stop it!"" getting a good laugh out of my fam but it wasn't enough to make us forget about the banshee noises coming from the other room. Needless to say I could take it no longer and asked our waiter to ask the manager to please say something. 

As I suspected they were too afraid to say anything. I can understand not wanting to upset a large group especially when most plates are over $10 as I have been a server and work in the service industry. However when you have children running from room to room and adults chasing them like they are wild chickens, you might want to attempt to control the situation. However the manager and Noe did come over to apologize and offer us free dessert. We couldn't be mad at him, after all you can't really control other people and their children. It wasn't his fault that they had no home training. He even bussed our table and hand delivered the dessert. 

Back to the food, I had the Cimichanga de Camarones (shrimp) and a cheese enchilada. The enchilada had more flavor than my chimichanga but deep fried tortilla...
My aunt had two tacos, one chicken and one beef. She said that they were missing ""the grease"" lol. She even put the spicy salsa on them to add extra flavor. 

My mom and sis had no complaints they had fajitas and a chicken dish.

Free dessert or not a spoon should always be offered with ice cream. Especially when it's yummy chocolate cake and vanilla! 

All in all we could have a great experience and should have been able to enjoy good food, drinks and conversation but unfortunately the evening was sullied by wild children and oblivious parents. We can't fault the manager on duty because the owners probably don't train proper etiquette on how to control potential bad situations. 

Would we return? Maybe but not anytime soon. There's too many options in this city and to be honest we've had better Mexican food. I'm looking forward to my leftovers (in front of the couch with no screaming children) though!",mK_hQ7bZ59wUY29-PKcB-w,0,0,3,HEIoG0SXqhHK6vU9K6_2DQ

All in all highly recommended, they do not get the five for a few reasons:

1) It was tough for me to find the address of this location. Internet Marketing please!

2) While the newer location is nice, it just doesn't have the feel of the Desert Inn location.

3) I have never been to Lindo and not heard at least one person be wished happy birthday by the staff. I haven't heard this at the new location.

I always get a frozen strawberry margarita & my boyfriend a coronarita.  So bomb.

When we're really hungry we start off with their ""QUESADILLA DE HARINA"" - flour tortilla with Monterrey jack cheese, sour cream, and guacamole ($7.25).

I get the ""FLAUTAS"" dinner - 6 fried rolled corn tortillas with beef, sour cream, and guacamole.  It also comes with rice and beans ($12.95).  

My boyfriend gets different things each time, but we have yet to order something that we did not like.

You get complimentary chips and salsa.  Their salsas are so good.

We came here a few months ago on my boyfriend's birthday.  Our server sent over the mariachi band.  They made my bf wear a sombrero as they played a song for him and then made him take a shot of tequila.  It was a really fun experience.

I have very specific restaurant settings were I feel drinks are in order - and this is one of them! I love their cadillac margarita's. I have such a difficult time in Vegas getting a margarita that is made right (i.e., not too sweet, not too sour). At Lindo Michoacan they know how to make a margarita. 

My favorite item on the menu, believe it or not, is the table-side guacamole. I know, it is just an appetizer - but it is the best appetizer! I used to have an avocado tree in my backyard growing up in Miami, so I miss avocados and love guacamole that is freshly made. I have had too many guacamole's that taste pasty or bland, but not here. They spice it up to your liking - so I have them dump in the bowl of onions & jalapeño's. They also have really awesome refried bean dip that comes with the chips. It is a perfect combination for a pre-dinner appetizer that mixes scrumptiously with my margarita and entrée later.

For entrées, I enjoy the chicken chimichanga, steak & shrimp fajitas, and fish street taco's. Some of the items are a little pricy. But, they serve all meals with Mexican soup and chips & salsa with refried beans. Many Mexican restaurants these days have been tacking on a separate fee for chips & salsa. So, I factor this in to the dining experience. Plus, I appreciate not being nickeled-and-dimed. When I start to feel like everything I want has a separate charge (e.g., sauces, chips, refill drink), I lose interest in the dining experience. 

The restaurant does have a Mariachi band that plays at night and walks about the restaurant.

1516605,2018-04-25,0,kYvZZ_aKaKLQKeyms74T2Q,"Having moved to Vegas last August, I was pretty sure I wasn't going to miss anything about LA. Well, turns out, I do miss several things about LA, but, number 1, hands down, is the Mexican food.

My wife and I came here several nights ago, and seriously, I'm still sad that THIS is considered the best Mexican food Vegas has to offer. We ordered several entree's, cause that's how we roll when we try new places, plus, we have food for a day or two more at home!

We ordered a combo plate that included a pork burrito, beef enchilada and a chicken taco. The carnitas plate. Street taco plate, and bacon wrapped shrimp.

The issue I have with ALL their food hands down, is that it was all just bland. From the beginning of the meal, the bean dip, blah. The salsa, blah. Then onto the entree's, just all flat. To the point where I started to get really sad. I love Mexican food, it's like my number 2 favorite cuisine, and I was sad because, THIS place is considered to be greatness. 

The chef/owner has the audacity to plaster his face all over the menu, which is all fine, but you better come correct with your flavors. You're not on Iron Chef, you're not chef Gordon Ramsay. If your picture is on every other page, I expect your food to be mind blowing. 

The best thing we had, was the carnitas, and again, not because of flavor, but because of how well it was cooked, temperature wise. It wasn't over or undercooked, as most places that serve carnitas fall under. It had nicely caramelized edges, but still moist. I just wish they had a pantry in the kitchen with herbs and spices.

This is all I'm saying to the owners/managers of this restaurant, please take a day trip to Los Angeles and head to a restaurant called Salsa and Beer, they have two locations. They have the BEST Mexican food, north of the border, and also, check out their pricing. Salsa and Beer is what I expected this place to be, but it wasn't even close.

If this is what Vegas has to offer as far as Mexican, I'm screwed. Also, it means there's a HUGE opening for someone to open a kick-ass Mexican restaurant, cause this ain't cutting it.

PS - My wife just brought something to my attention. With ALL the food we ordered, we didn't take a single thing home with us. As I mentioned earlier, we usually order multiple plates when going somewhere new, so that we can basically ""sample"" the restaurant. That being said, without even thinking about it, when our server came around and asked if we wanted to take anything, I instantly said no. If you know me, you know that's extremely unusual. I'll often even take things I wasn't impressed with home with me, in hopes of ""fixing"" them. 

Two stars for atmosphere, and their margaritas are good, I'd come back and just drink at the bar.

The best service came from the bus boys who circulate and clean our table and refill our drinks. The only friendly people we encountered that night. Chips and salsa: salsa had a nice kick to it but had zero flavor. Same with the bean dip. Nothing special, you can buy a better one in the chip section of your grocery store. I came here for handmade tortillas which are popular in San Diego so I guess my bar was set pretty high anyway. However these were probably the worst tortillas I've had. I would have rather had the ones that I buy from the grocery store. For one they are not fresh which they don't advertise so that's fine but they were super dry and just not good. The queso fundido was okay nothing special but very stingy with the chorizo. My partner got the Carnitas plate which he said was flavorless and dry. I got the beef fajitas which were also flavorless and dry. I literally ate three beef strips and could not stomach the rest. When I bite into the beef the inside is pure white because it is so overcooked, tough and ridiculously dry with a zero flavor. it went to waste because I took it home thinking I could make it better with some salsa and sour cream but it still tasted like rubber so it was a wasted meal. I guess I would understand more if their prices were lowered to accommodate for the non seasoned and over cooked food, however it is pretty pricey for the low quality that you get. I do not recommend this place if you like authentic flavorful Mexican food. And obviously if you're on a budget this is not the place to go. even going through the reviews I did not believe that a place could not have flavor and have so many reviews on how is overcooked and dry their meat is. But my initial thought was well who can mess up beef fajitas it's literally a stir fry. WRONG. I seriously cannot get over how bad it was. :( I wanted to like this place but I will not be returning.",xTimtxT3p1zKrtfP9JRuZA,0,0,1,pwDkaMH5iG-CdwrYHyLbQw

You're always offered the chips, beans and salsa. This time we received a 1/4 of the bowl full of  salsa (barely enough to dip your chips in), the beans were tepid, but the chips were great! We asked for more salsa and it was delivered directly from the fridge. The main course was equally disappointing. We both had the taco plates (beef and steak). The rice was molded on our plate (cafeteria style) along with bean puree vs. refried beans. The taco meat was completely void of taste. We added cold salsa and salt and pepper to the taco meat for some type of flavor enhancement. We are so disappointed, this was our favorite mexican food restaurant, and so convenient too. If your tying to reduce food costs, I get it, but don't serve premade ice-cold salsa and cafeteria molded rice.

There are still some things on the menu that are a bit bland, or a bit overdone in some particular aspect, but there are others that I've had many times in the past and not really enjoyed (there were just the least-bad option) that I have tried here recently and were quite improved. One specific example is the corn tortilla chicken quesadilla on the appetizer menu. There is a Spanish name for it that I can't remember but it has the word Masa in it. Because of the corn tortillas, you see. These things are now AWESOME. I get them every time I come.

The food is bland and uninspired.  The chips were great but the ""salsa"" was chipolte like flavored red sauce.  It tasted strong of smoke with a little heat to it.  The table side guacomole was not very tasty and even though we ordered it with everything included, it didnt seem to help.  The tacos were wrapped in an oily shell and the meat was barely seasoned.  When I ate them the oil from the shell coated my tounge and sapped  flavor from the rest of the dish.  There should have been a acid to combat the oiliness, a fresh salsa would have worked well.
The restaurant had 4 separate familys with kids and two were extremely loud and obnoxious with the parents ignoring their precious offspring so the whole restaurant could endure the piercing screams of the  children.

Well everyone knows that Starbucks serves the worst coffee on planet earth and charge outrageous prices for same yet they continue to pack customers in for no other reason than the coolness factor and name recognition.

The same goes for this restaurant. It's in a well-to-do area without a lot of eating establishments and the people go because it's convenient and they can afford to throw their money away. 

Hence, if you are looking for a loud, noisy, place with mediocre food that costs as much or more than eating on the strip, this is your place! 

From the worst salsa I have ever eaten in my life to the greasy chips, I told my wife then we should run, not walk out of there. The average plate costs $15-20, which is simply absurd for what you get ....bland food with a lot of breading and little meat at a cost that will allow you to go to much nicer restaurants for a cheaper price.

Simply unbelievable that this place is in business. And, just like Starbucks, it just goes to show that American standards have become increasingly low compared to other places in the world. Hence, we throw away our money and don't hold people/establishments accountable for their actions and, in fact, reward them for ripping us off just as we do our politicians.",ieF5HygMipxxReyxwKbbVQ,2,1,1,0Wxl5EBsRE-WFQzqcUlZvA

As other reviewers have said, the soup is delicious! It was probably my favorite part of the meal. The portions are pretty large, the chips/salsa was good and fresh.

Now the negatives - the flavor of the food is just okay. Compared to Cantina Laredo or the now closed Agave, it's a 5 out of 10. The chicken in my enchilada was a little dry. There was too much cheese in the chile relleno. I like cheese, but it overpowered the dish. The beef taco was a bit bland.

The whole experience was eh. The complimentary chips and dips were not a favorite. The chips tasted like it came straight from a bag at the grocery store and was bland. 

For the entree I got the carnitas plate with rice and beans and flour tortillas. I was disappointed with the whole thing. There were pieces of carnitas that was way overcooked and dry. My brother got a chicken dish that was covered in sauce. On its own, the chicken was rubbery and overcooked as well. 

Sadly I do not plan on returning. Service was decent in the beginning but when it came time to get the check, that took forever. To a point where I was becoming impatient. The only thing I really liked was the Mariachi band.",60skTN6p8SdQ2sGNKL0vRQ,0,0,2,cdWEz65XbMeb_HaQNUCdEA

Now I knew going in that they have a mariachi band , but sometimes it got so loud by our table that we found ourselves yelling in our conversation. on the plus side they have a huge menu , so many options to fish , chicken, vegetarian and your common Mexican food favorites. For my starter I chose the fideo soup, I love it with fresh lime squeezed in, its like a Mexican noodle soup with a tomato base. I grew a bit irritated for as long as it took for our waitress to get the lime i kept asking for. For dinner i chose the chili relleno with a beef taco combo plate which was very good, too much food with the rice and beans after munching on chips and salsa before dinner. I tried the Sangria which seemed too strong without much flavor, needless to say I have had better. My next drink was a bit better a margarita on the rocks , always a good choice. We decided to push it and have dessert , a caramel torte and also sopapillas which were my favorite sprinkled with honey they are like a square fried donut with cinnamon and sugar. SWEET!

2041551,2016-04-24,0,kYvZZ_aKaKLQKeyms74T2Q,"Short version: horrible service, inedible food and nonexistent management. 

And for those of you who are bored enough to read the long version, here we go! We came for dinner on a Saturday night after spending the whole day at the Highland Games and we were both starving. Thank goodness for the chips, salsa and small cup of soup cause I seriously would have been famished after we left. 

I ordered the Tia Esther, a grilled chicken dish with a sauce that was described as dried chilies, secret spices and blended with a touch of mayonnaise. I like grilled chicken, I like dried chilies, I like spices (secret or otherwise) and I like mayo...on paper it sounds like a good dish. On paper. I literally had three bites of the chicken. The second two bites were just to make sure I was tasting it correctly and my guy had a bite. It was seriously like taking a bite out of a salt lick. To the point that it was inedible. I almost never send back a dish or even complain. I usually convince myself it's my fault for picking a dish I didn't enjoy. This time I couldn't stay quiet. My boyfriend could barely even swallow the bite he had. 

We flagged down our server (since he never came to check on us after the plates hit the table) and explained what was wrong (at this point I was chalking it up to an accidental over salting incident) and he said he would have them remake it and package it to go. He wasn't apologetic or even kind about the situation. Twenty five minutes later he comes to the table drops the bag with my refire  in it on the table, throws the check on the table and disappears...never to return. First of all, if I had known it was going to take that long I would have said never mind, especially since we weren't able to flag him down until after my guy was done with his meal so we just sat there twiddling our thumbs. Secondly, don't be a turkey when someone is unhappy, especially when said person is almost in tears from guilt and apologizing to YOU for the inconvenience. 

So basically we paid $16 for a side of beans and rice and free chips and a small cup of free soup. I'm not a happy panda. 

If you think this sad tale is over, think again! I go to heat up my refired dish. Our server snarkily (I believe I just made that word up lol) pointed out that I must not like salty food so he did me a favor by packaging the sauce separately from the chicken. I'm the girl who asks for extra salt on my soft pretzels so that dog don't hunt bucko. I had high hopes that this batch would be better, I was still holding out hope that it was a mistake the first time, but lo and behold, the chicken was super salty, the sauce was super salty and together they were inedible again. I tried to do some kitchen magic by making a cream sauce to hide the chicken in and that didn't even help. 

We asked for a manager to stop by our table, he never showed. The only time I saw the manager he was joking and talking with employees. I'm extremely unhappy, not only about the food but by the service and lack of empathy. In the past we have had decent meals at this establishment, but not even the soup (which is the main draw for me) will bring me back unless management reaches out to us and offers an apology.",BDoSVFfwpGqluwxpIkFtRQ,2,0,1,RGpx-JgBTPiBqPZHwz3o5Q

We always get exceptional, superb service at both locations.  The staff always go above and beyond. They're very social. I haven't had a bad experience yet. The food is always good, the alcohol, even better. Their strawberry margaritas are mighty tasty.

I try to get a different dish each time I go, but top three are the chicken fajitas (come out sizzling hot), enchiladas suizas (made with cream cheese, you can't go wrong with cream cheese!), and their shrimp salad (tossed with lemon and avocados). You can't go wrong with those dishes. Tortillas are always fresh and handmade and come with some dishes, not all. 

Meanwhile you wait for your food, you can either order an appetizer or just stuff your face with the chips/beans/salsa that they put out for you. If you're going to go with an appetizer, the queso fundido is a must, lot's of cheesy goodness! You can opt to get it with green chile strips or chorizo, both are equally delicious.

So I was looking for a ""best of Las Vegas"" experience for her.  My family and I had previously been to the Desert Inn location and it was pretty good, so I thought this would be good too.  To be honest, I'm sorry I chose this restaurant.  It was ""ok"" but not the type of memorable experience I was hoping for.  The minuses:  One of my enchiladas had a cold spot in the middle.  The shredded chicken was dry and flavorless.  Someone in our party said that ""she could taste the margarita mix but not the tequila"" in the margarita.  The flan was too sweet, (yes, I know that dessert is supposed to be sweet, but it was so sweet that the rest of the flavors were overpowered.)

The service wasn't all that great.  After our table was cleared, I waited for a while and then went to go find the waiter to ask for a dessert menu.  Things like water refills and the check seemed to take a while, even though they didn't seem busy.  

Normally I would have scarcely noticed these things if it were just a casual dinner out, but under the circumstances, it mattered.  It was a weeknight and a bit late, so maybe that had something to do with it.

The pluses:  The tableside guacamole is a nice touch, even though the flavor was missing something.  Cilantro?  Also the food was not overly salty, which is often a problem with Mexican food.  And of course, sopapillas.  Sopapillas are always a plus.

First time I went here I had flown out to Las Vegas, from California, with my dad several years ago when we were looking at UNLV as a possible college for me to attend. On our last night in town our family friends who lived in Summerlin recommended we go to this restaurant as a send-off for me and my dad. What an awesome dinner we had and not to mention, consumed my first shot of tequila here! It also happened to be my 18th birthday and upon my father and friends telling the waiters this information, they swiftly retrieved a gigantic sombrero, snuck up behind me and plopped that hat right down over my head and then proceeded to throw a shot of tequila straight down my throat! Everyone at the table was shocked (Whether it was because I was only 18 and took it like a champ or that the waiters had no idea I was only 18)! We laughed for days after this and still do til this day. Such a fun night, amazing food, killer guacamole, and super attentive servers and waiters (; This may have been the deciding factor in me choosing UNLV later on. Who knows! Loved the restaurant. Still do. Visit every time I'm in town and recommend it to anyone looking for a little Mexican fix. Every location in Las Vegas is great and they are always consistent with their food! Thanks for the memories Lindo!!!! Can't wait to be back in your delicious presence again! How I fiend for you all the way from the Bay Area!",lKiY3RuBdhbFTII-v0TNBg,1,0,5,R940WC5GbABCp21nklq5Wg

I do like Lindo Michoacán ! However there are just too many places near by that are easier choices ! 
The location and parking of this place is perfect. 

There a couple things that keep me from coming here more often 

1. The number one reason  I tend to choose other places is .....the pricing of Lindo. They are a little too pricey for me. 

2. They have a large menu but it's almost too large and not only is it too large, they limit your options and almost force you to spend $12 or more no matter what. For example they have 1 side soup option which is Fideo soup . Everything else is offered as a main entree.... for example they have seafood soup entree, beef soup chicken soup etc . They don't offer cups just large bowls and the bowl of chicken soup we ordered was too large and far too expensive for the rubbery over cooked chicken that came in the chicken soup. A cup for $6 would have worked! 

3. Their chips and salsa were mediocre and the bean dip was and is never very tasty. 

4. The good thing about Lindo is they are not terrible as a matter of fact i enjoy going for brunch . They do have machines if you like to play and TVs at the bar , a good selection of seafood , good food and they do have good service !",Jy3MoHeefnYoUWNrWii_Ow,0,0,3,5J-kNUhSyayTA84qZ7FRAQ

I prefer hole-in-the-walls over high-priced faux.  Ordered the enchilada and taco but before the entree, I thought the tri-colored chips (red and blue) tasted heavily of food coloring and the salsa was terrible.

We always get the table-side guacamole, which i would recommend regulating the amount of ingredients the servers mix in.  Some of the servers just dump a whole bowl of onion, one of tomatoes, and another of jalapenos into the mix.  It should just be a touch of each of those.

I sat outside on our last visit and it was very pleasant.  Inside is a little more typical, but still nice. 

Food update:  I didn't like the Chile Verde as I found it too sour.  But I did have the Chile Relleno, and I recommend!  They use Pasilla Chiles (i'm purdy sure), and nice creamy cheese that mixes well with the enchilada sauce that its covered in.  The sauce is almost as good as mine! (almost.)

The waiter was rude, I asked for a small sauce of Habanero to go with my Chips and he rudely just said ""Someone will bring it out"". Asked on 2 other separate occasions still nothing just ignored. It was the Busser/Buss Boy who I asked that brought it over. Waiter was only seen 3 times. One to ask what we wanted to drink when we came in and to take drink order, second when dropping off the drinks and taking food order and last walking by quickly and asking if I wanted another Margarita. The Busser/Buss Boy practically served/waited on us. 

Personally the food here is a hit or miss as my son did not like his Chicken, my food was ok nothing spectacular today but I have had better on different days, so I will not knock the food it is good. 

But Customers or Patrons do NOT need to deal with rude Waiters or people going through shit in their lives, you are paid to wait on customers and as a reward you get a good tip for your service. Today the service was worth nothing but a waste of our time. Someone should promote the Busser/Buss Boy and Girls at this place and fire the Waiters because this is not a unique experience at this place but the norm it seems.

We all need to support local businesses that actually care for their customers in Las Vegas and my family does its best. Businesses need to do their best to put a smile on their customers faces and not leave them disgusted with service or lack thereof. I even had to call over the same Busser/Buss Boy to run my card as we were done and the rude Waiter was no where to be found still.

So take it from a long time customer, and I have to say I have had great experiences with many of the Bussers/Buss Girls and Guys there, always pleasant etc. Take my word for it, if your waiter would rather be somewhere else and does not get you what you asked for of disappears and is rude take your business elsewhere.",tdl5rlbignsLvKCsV_xTOw,1,0,1,spP8f7LOtO4Axuhp-Fxskw

It's got a great ambiance, a live musician playing the keyboard to Mexico's greatest hits (judging by my pal's enthusiasm for the songs), and delicious food.  At one point, some people even got up to dance the bachata - winner, winner, chicken dinner.

Pros:
Delicious food
""Mexican approved"" (and I mean ""Mexican from Mexico City,"" not, ""this one friend I have who is kind of tan and I think his last name is Garcia or something."")
Well-decorated
Good ambiance - great for groups or a romantic date - a rare combo!
Friendly and prompt service
The dude playing the keyboard had a good voice.  (If you have to listen to live music, it had better be pleasant, that's all I'm saying!)

Cons:
A little spend-y for a Mexican restaurant - I usually think of Mexican as cheap eats.
A little loud for first-date or similar chit-chat.
No ""mild"" salsa option at the table - I'd say it was medium, which is cool for me, but might not be everyone's bag.  Or bowl.  Or container of your choice.

The meat was tender but had absolutely no flavor, I tried the beans and rice, guacamole all the same Flavorless! Who has ever had refried beans they didn't like...

I have thrown away so much money in Vegas trying to find good Mexican food like back in the Oakland Bay Area. It's frustrating...I give up.
Anybody heard of Mexicali Rose in Oakland? That's the kind of flavor I'm looking for.

The presentation was good, the steak was sizzling, I thought it was more onions and peppers than anything.  They brought 2 small flour tortillas, there was no cheese and I had to ask for pico de galo, again this flavorless meal was $18.95.

I would advise anyone wanting Mexican food to try Javier's inside the Aria.  It's not old school authentic, but it is good if you don't mind paying a bit more.",0U-SpnLiJrGA3WfpMTlmzA,0,0,3,qnYbW58RTi5ApJiWq6poag

Stopped here at the insistence of a friend before we hit the strip to club and build our regrets. I was pleasantly pleased with the vegetarian options. I chose the Veggie Fajita plate and it was a huge portion of perfectly seasoned veggies (and not just like, broccoli in some salsa, actual squash, mushrooms, onions, etc that made a pretty decent dish). Beans were ok. Rice was bomb. Tortillas were obviously homemade. I wanted more, but did I need more? Absolutely not. 

Price was pretty fair, I think I paid about $15? Not including tip.  I'd come back but I think I'd do a burrito next time.",J7yrodx4X_ptycfYf7DsMA,3,1,3,NvMH8B811j0X6vYoN0KfxQ
2778867,2014-06-18,6,kYvZZ_aKaKLQKeyms74T2Q,"Man, I dont know what it is but lately I have been having bad experiences. Last place I went to had good food but bad service. Here I had both bad service and bad food. Im hoping the next place I go to I dont have bad anything. 

So me and the wifey come here on thursday around 9:15 pm for a late dinner. Since these guys close at 11, we were thinking we should get decent service and decent food as well.

What I got was the Carne Asada Plate ($18.95). It is a thinly cut of New York steak. Comes with refried beans, rice, guacamole, and flour tortillas. My wife got a Shredded Beef Enchilada ($4.50) off the a la carte menu.

Before our order comes out, we are given a basket of chips, bean dip, and salsa to munch on while we waited. I guess we were really hungry because we devoured it in like a minute. Like all other Mexican restaurants, I assumed these things were endless. As our server walked by a couple times to refill our drinks, he never refilled the the chips and dip. So maybe I was wrong about my assumption. Until I saw the next table get another batch. Hmmmm. Sad to say the chips and salsa were the only things with great flavor.

We get our main entrees and it looks delicious. But turns out the steak was bland. The only things that had any kind of flavor on my plate were the grilled jalapeno and small spoonful of guacamole. I had to dip the steak in what little left of the salsa that was provided with the chips. My wife's enchilada was ok but it was obvious that it was microwaved as evidenced by the some of the enchilada sauce surrounding the burrito was crusted. You know when any kind of sauce gets microwaved too long? Yup. Thats how parts of the sauce were. 

Service was just a tad below mediocre. I think the table next to us got chips and salsa refilled twice. Not to say that we could of ate that much as well but like I said before I was used to these places constantly refilling those things without hesitation. It also took a while for us to get our check and for the receipt to come back so I can sign it. 

So in closing, maybe we just came at the wrong time? Maybe we need to get to the original location off of Desert Inn? If we do, hopefully the food and service will be much better. Until then, im not sure if I want to come back to this particular location.

We went during dinner time on a weekend and there were lots of seats and tables available, so that's not a good sign, but hey never judge a book by its cover. We were seated very fast  and were given tortilla chips, salsa, and refried beans. My sister ordered the Carnitas while I ordered the Stephanie. Both our foods came out dry and even though the Stephanie is covered in sauce on the chicken, it was still really dry. The chips and dips did not taste like they were fresh or hand made. Our chips tasted like it came from a grocery store, same thing with the salsa. Service wasn't that great considering our server never asked if we wanted a refill on our drinks or if everything was good or if we wanted more chips and salsa.

Lindo Michoacan has definitely changed my mind! The restaurant itself is more sprawling than other restaurants and there's a lot of different types of seating (booths, patio area, long tables, etc.). Our servers/runners were on top of it and we were never left wanting chips, salsa, bean dip, water, etc. The chicken in my enchiladas was soft and flavorful and my fiance really enjoyed the fajitas he ordered. I preferred this place over Bonita Michoacan (they might be the same owners),  where I had a Groupon, but that location was farther from us and the parking wasn't ideal. I guess the fairer comparison is against Frank and Fina's Cocina, which is right around the corner. I would say I didn't enjoy the atmosphere as much at F&F and the staff there definitely catered to the regulars a bit more, so we had to wait awhile to get worker's attention on a lot of things.

All in all, until I find a better restaurant, Lindo Michoacan will be the go-to Mexican spot.",Y8adrWFzckrjuC11aAs9Og,3,3,4,-cB5LJnkyHExSLe26XYMog

A mariachi band played great music in the background and they had us dancing in our seats within minutes. =]

Our server, Oliver was very helpful and attentive. He brought us some chips, salsa, and bean dip. We also ordered Tamarindo juice and Jamaica juice. Both were delicious and not to sweat. We decided to start off with guacamole, which was brought immediately to the table. They prepared it right in front of us using fresh avocado, lime juice, cilantro, onions, and tomatoes. Oliver asked if we needed help with the menu and made his suggestions. Hubby finally decided on Buey al Cilantro and I ordered Toro a la Coca Cola. Both of us ordered our steaks medium rare and crossed our fingers. Surprisingly, for a place that claims to have amazing restaurants, Las Vegas falls short when preparing steaks properly. 

While we were waiting, we were served fideo soup, which is thin noodles in a tomato based soup. It was delicious and very savory. When the food came out, both of us were shocked at the huge servings! 

The Buey al Cilantro is a rib eye steak cooked with cilantro and spices, covered with verde (green) sauce! The steak was perfectly cooked, we were both thrilled. The steak also came with beans, rice, and your choice of corn or flour tortillas. 

The Toro a la Coca Cola is cooked in Coca Cola, garlic, dried red chiles, cloves, and secret ingredient. Yum! This steak was also perfectly cooked. The first bite was absolutely amazing. Their steak is tender, juicy, and wonderfully marinated. Their flour tortillas are huge and we had plenty of food to take home!

The employees are amazing. Even those who were not our servers came by and checked in on us. Our beverages were refilled constantly and was never below the halfway line.

Their fresh tableside guacamole is amazing and probably the best I've had in Vegas. I rate a Mexican restaurant by how well they make their guacamole and carne asada. Since this place gets both items very right all the time, it's easily one of my favorites.

If you come here, you have to know what to order. Don't go to a Mexican restaurant and order a simple burrito or quesadilla. There's really not much you can do with those items. They're going to taste the same almost everywhere. You might as well just stick with Del Taco or Taco Bell. See what everyone else is raving about on here and try those items instead.

Luckily it was only luke warm and didn't do much damage other than irritate me and soak my shorts. Despite that unfortunate beginning, we had a good time at Lindo.

I've only been to Mexico a few times and can't speak to the authenticity of the place. But, judging from it's location in Spring Valley (btw, thanks Misti for finally establishing the neighborhoods for Vegas Yelp, otherwise I would have thought this place was in Summerlin ; ) and the surrounding neighborhoods I'm guessing they cater to a gringo audience. Since I'm a gringo myself I don't mind.

The service was excellent. Our order was taken promptly, food came out quickly, water was refilled frequently, dishes were picked up right after we were done, and the waiter(s) stopped by often to check in on us.

The food was pretty good overall. I liked the chips, salsa and bean dip. The guacamole is made tableside to your desired level of spiciness and it was some of the best guac I've had in a long time. The amount was more than enough for the three of us and would have been good for four adults. We got an order of flautas (3 beef and 3 chicken). The beef was a little dry and not too flavorful. The chicken was tender and tasty -- definitely the better of the two. We  also got a beef tamale. It was oversauced and too mushy for my liking. My son had the cheese quesadilla, which he liked.

The atmosphere is great for families -- and there were a LOT of families there. One side of the restaurant had a mariachi band and the other side (near the bar) had a guy on keyboards singing. There was even a little ""dance"" area where kids were getting their groove on.

I mean, I know they serve beans as a side with your meal but as a dip for your chips? Weird.

I can't believe we paid 75$ for a dinner I could have got on the clearance shelf at smiths . The table side guacamole was bland . I don't understand how it is possible to screw up guacamole that us Made with"" fresh "" ingredients but apparently it very easy ! 

I got a three item combo , everything did not have good flavor . The chile relleno was covered in the same red tomato sauce as the chicken enchilada that has dry chicken meat . The beef taco was the best part of my meal and was comparable to Roberto's 

My husbands meal was the worst part of our whole experience . His beef dish wasn't edible as every few bites had so much fat I had to literally ask for a new napkin just to spit the meat I couldn't swallow into . Who serves meat like this at an establishment that is so well known ?!?! I have literally had better quality meat from don tortaco ! WhAt a disappointment ! 

The only thing I can say was good about our experience was the service , our sever was very attentive and it was not his fault a ""Mexican food "" place was serving food that should not have been approved by the FDA .",F7LhnDvi2t6B56iaPeNZHw,3,2,1,WjbXbauU9xtM7AdPKpFZ5Q

The traditional Lindo's Chips & Salsa is served here, complimentary.  It has the same fresh, awesome taste as the other locations.  Good start.

After browsing the menu for a little while, I settled on the Lunch Special #3 ""Tres"".....Beef Chimichanga.  I was going to order a Dos XX or a Pacifico, but since my friends were on lunch from work, I didn't want to throw it in their face that I can drink at lunch and they can't....so I abstained and had an Iced Tea.

The food came out pretty fast.  The Chimichanga comes with Rice, Beans, and Sour Cream & Guacamole on the side.  It was cooked just right.....the fried Tortilla was crispy, flaky, and not greasy.  The Beef was shredded and full of flavor.  I like to get their signature Salsa and pour it on top of the Chimichanga....because the Salsa packs a lot of heat and has that Smoky Chipotle flavor to it.  I mixed the Beans & Rice together and devoured the plate.

The service was excellent and everyone had a good time.  We spent an hour after lunch talking and catching up on stuff.....even though we settled our bill, the server ensured our glasses were full and that everyone was ok.  It's the signature service I've come to know and love about Lindo and his restaurants....glad to see it was the same here.

We both enjoyed our dishes.  I was surprised that my wife liked the almond in her dish.  She's generally been averse to such additions to food.  Imagine my surprise!  I enjoyed the cactus with my chicken.  Both dishes had good flavors of fresh ingredients.

For dessert, we had their chocolate cake with vanilla ice cream.  It was more than enough for two people. The cake was a round shaped and was filled with a liquid chocolate and was much like a lava cake.  The ice cream had caramel drizzled on top.

They have a live musician/singer, which is a really nice touch :)
The service is very fast and friendly.
My absolutely favorite dish here is the carnitas a la coca cola. The meat is really tender and super flavorful.
I also like their flautas.
And their complimentary fideo soup is so delicious!
Almost every time we come here, we're seated right away. Except for one time when we went on a Sat around 7:30 pm, it was super packed and we had to wait about 40 min to get a table. So you should make a reservation if you're going there on a Sat.
It gets pretty loud when they're busy (I hate loud restaurants).
The only reason I gave them 4 stars instead of 5 is because sometimes they get super busy & because their complimentary corn chips & salsa could be better. The chips are a little on the thick side, not light and crispy. And their salsa seems more like hot sauce than salsa (not tomato-y enough).
But their flour chip that comes as a garnish in your entree is delicious.
The food portions are a good amount for the price.
And I like how they have lollipops instead of boring mints.

The Summerlin location of this Las Vegas favorite is pricier than the rest.  All of the entrees are approx. $2-3 more than sister properties.  That said, the portions are more than fair.  Your dinner is likely to provide leftovers for an additional meal.  All the meals come with a tasty little cup of tomato fideo soup.  I would go just for this hot deelish little soup cup.  A house margarita is $10 - that's a bit steep for off strip.

On our most recent visit, we started with fresh guacamole.  It is fresh; and mixed up right at your table.  I dined on the coca cola carnitas.  The tender chunks of pork are coated in a rich, dark, flavorful sauce.  They will curb your craving for delicious pork!

While not quite as good as its sister locations, this is the closest one to me so I eat here often. The signature stellar Lindo service is here (really, how do they always manage to give 5 star service no matter the time of day) and the food is delicious. 

I love the queso here, it's basically a big plate of REAL melty cheese baked with charred poblano peppers and served with Lindo's delicious homemade flour tortillas! I love the tortillas here and I frequently eat my weight in them (bye bye low carb diet). The complimentary chips, salsa and bean dip is always a hit too. The food here is just delicious. You can't go wrong with many of the dishes (although sometimes the chicken quality in some of the specialty dishes is a little bit rubbery and ""off"" -- don't know why, but it has happened a couple of times at this location). I've never had an issue with the chicken quality in the chicken fajitas or with any of the seafood or beef dishes. The guacamole is worth getting, and they have yummy Diet Pepsi and fresh brewed iced tea. Again, the focus is on quality and service. 

The prices are higher than your average Mexican restaurant but I think it's worth it. This location runs incredible lunch deals and specials during the week, and the kitchen is fast so it's the perfect spot for a quick workday lunch. 

The hostesses will automatically try to seat you in the bar section of the restaurant if you are a party of just adults. There's an extra special atmosphere in this area on weeknights when a dude in a sparkly red shirt plays a synthesizer and sings pop songs in broken English. It's pretty rad and it's not too loud, which is nice. If you are looking for a quieter experience, ask to be seated in the other part of the restaurant. 

Note that the parking lot here is deceptive and is often overflowing with cars. Even if it appears packed, do not be discouraged and assume there's a wait -- go in anyway. I've never had to wait here even on a very busy Saturday night.",BQkC6RneYfvfG6wRe0hsvQ,9,5,4,zJlB9mYmk20pRMQ0NX5LDw

I remember the service was pretty awesome, but the poorest most profound thing I found wrong with this company was that the day we ordered our food, it was on discounted day and I didn't even know about it. We received our food and as I took the first bite, I had something in my teeth that felt odd or weird, as my wife looked at me and said maybe it's cheese, I then began pulling it out of my mouth and it was a long black hair which did not belong to me, because I shave my head and my wife's hair is brown and it was physically impossible to have her hair fall into my food cause she was sitting across from me when the waiter placed our food down. 

Once I noticed this, I immediately asked for the manager and both the waiter and manager were shocked and the manager actually had the nerve to ask me if the hair possibly belonged to me and or my wife, I laughed and had to ask are you kidding me my head is shaved and my wife's hair is brown not black, he then said we can remake your food and comp this meal. 

I said no to the manager and appreciated his comp, but I had lost my hunger after having that in my meal. I took one bite and had a long black hair in my food. Now other than this it was an alright place, but since then I won't and refuse to return, because not only did I walk out without a comp which I honestly didn't have to have, but the respect of the manager should have been there and he should of said your next meal for myself and my wife should of been comped. 

Normally in a situation like this I never complain I don't care about spending the money it was the fact I was asked is the hair mine lol or my wife's when food was just brought out.",Fr9OjCKLIKrV9zXoyrbSHg,0,0,2,Keapv6z0YBOCVZ9q6254GQ

I like getting my food/check/water/service .. everything prompt so thats why I didnt mind, (coming from an impatient person) while others maybe don't like getting rushed .. But overall, the food was great!! They start you off with unlimited nachos with hot/medium sauces. For drinks, we ordered the frozen Mango and Raspberry Margaritas .. which were good.

I came in around 5pm and the hostess sat us right by the speaker, I wanted to have dinner and a nice conversation  with my boyfriend not get a headache, maybe start the musicians a little later on like 8 or 9?  So we moved from the bar side to the main area, even with all the screaming kids it was still quieter than the band side.  That says something right there crying babies sound better than whoever was singing in the other room.  For my food I was really craving a chimichanga, a nice deep fried burrito usually with beans cheese and meat stuffed inside and melted cheese sour cream some sauce on top, yum.  What I got was a soft tortilla with just shredded chicken inside nothing else, and a bare top, nothing, no cheese, sauce, or even guacamole.  I should have went to Cafe Rio, Zabas or Chipotle it would have been cheaper.

My main dish was the Camarones Abuelito Timo. It was plump Gulf shrimp stuffed with cheese, peppers and wrapped in bacon and deep fried. It was good but not great because it was little bit too salty for me. I had to peel off some of the bacon to make it a little less salty. 

I saw that they had a Tres Leche Cake on their dessert menu but they ran out! We settled on a cheesecake that tasted similar to the Tres Leche but it wasn't my favorite. I'm not a big fan of cheesecake but it still tasted decent.",48vRThjhuhiSQINQ2KV8Sw,2,1,3,GiIOZJR5xSylt83fkBRZzw

The guacamole here is great. They have a certain way of doing it but you can feel free to make a suggestion about certain ingredients to cater to your liking. i let them do their thing and it never disappoints.

The food was great, we had a Chile Relleno/ Tamale combo. The Chile Relleno was really good. The pepper was cooked just right, nice and tender but not mushy. The stuffing in the Chile was delicious. The Tamale was great a beef tamale and I could just sit there and eat that all night.

We also ordered a Gallo al Mojo de Ajo. It was a chicken breast cooked in a garlic wine sauce. I cut up that chicken, tossed it in a flour tortilla with the rice, beans, and guacamole and I was happy. Also ordered a Tamale with that, I think that is going to be a permanent a la carte order from now on.

Up next was the Banderillas de Torro. Grilled Beef skewers with onion and green, red, and yellow peppers. A little tough on the meat but tons of flavor. Good stuff.

When we told him about the beans, he stood there and argued with 3 Hispanic women that the beans were fine, not burnt that that's how they are suppose to taste.   GROSS!!!!  We told him no.  No amount of salt would fix this.  He had an attitude that we did not deserve.   We proceeded to order our entrees at this point I was ready to leave sick of his attitude. However Out of town company was here so we tried to make the most of it.  The food came and was lacking flavor the chicken was dry.  The milanesa was tough.  We left, and said this place has gone down hill.  Either they changed cooks or sold the business.  No more Lindo in my families future.  This is sad because I have booked parties in the past, and was never put off by the food like Thursday 4/20/17.",ISFaBn0zmTVhhS9HQa9xJg,1,0,1,2U4sZmlxgq6EfQcI1pYw3A

I had a migraine so I slept most of the day. We stumbled in at closing time. My son explained it was my birthday as well as Mother's Day and that I had been sick all day. We were the only people in the restaurant so that was nice. I've been there with a migraine in the past when they had live music and it was torture. 

Our waiter was attentive and patient although it was obvious it had been a long day for him. I had a margarita-frozen which was just okay. We had this appetizer that I crave. I forget the name. Basically it looks like a shrimp burrito. It's fantastic. My daughter got a child's plate with a quesadilla and rice and beans. I got a combo plate with cheese enchilada, tostada and taco (I hate shredded beef) and rice and beans. My son got a #13 Combo with a burrito and enchilada which he promptly doused then bathed in ghost peppers and habanero sauces to the the shock and awe of the staff. They inquired as to his need of water or milk which he declined. Ghost peppers aren't hot enough for him. At this point, I think he would delight in chemical burns. He has a vast array of hot sauces at home. 

Our food was tasty and satisfying. I asked for cherry cheesecake for desert and they told me they were out. Then they found some squirreled away and made my day. The next thing I know, they bring out a sombrero, churro desert and a shot of tequila along with 3 free hot pink Mother's Day T-Shirts! They sing Happy Birthday Panchita and my son got the entire humiliating scenario on camera. The tequila was very smooth, I gotta get me somma that! It's Giro. Smoother even than Patron! 

It was a nice birthday/Mother's Day that my kids and I will always cherish. We will be back again and again.",zwo4S612wfakZodLQ8aMIQ,4,3,3,T7Jl1MOlPAjj0ygSIO_dAg

Arrived just after 5pm and there were already many others dining.
Service was outstanding - starting with the greeters at the door who made us sincerely feel welcomed .. 
Very extensive menu - having never been needed extra time to read through.  
Chips, salsa (very spicy!) and a bean dip to munch while deciding what to order.
La Buenona Margarita was very good - Husb had a Pacifico draft.
Dinner was absolutely delicious! 
Fideo Soup came first.  I had (7) Jumgo Gulf Shrimp in garlic  - without any guajillo peppers as I cannot tolerate spice - just the right serving of rice, beans and guacamole on the plate along with 3 fresh tortillas.  
Husb had Chili Verde and gave it two thumbs up as well.
Atmosphere is lively, but no obnoxiously loud so that we couldn't hear our conversation .. 
Several TV's displayed sports.
Bar had numerous patrons dining, watching sports and playing video (poker probably but didn't look)

They have good lunch specials for around $10 found on the back of the menu. They also have great Fideo soup. The shrimp cocktail is good as well.

Lindo Michoacan is the real deal. Though it is supposed to be ""gourmet"" food, the reality is that it straight-forward Mexican food. It is what most Mexicans eat at home, which is why it is a nostalgic place to go if you're Mexican. The food is well seasoned, and it is very similar to what you would get in Mexico. By this, I mean that the chef does not randomly use cumin and cilantro, like other places. I ordered the Milanesa, which was done to perfection, and the rice and beans that came as side dishes were perfect. My husband ordered the Carnitas, and they were also cooked very well, and perfectly seasoned. Before you are served entrees, you are treated with chips to dip in salsa and refried beans. The chips were sub-par (I would have expected freshly fried ""totopos""), but the salsa was excellent and not ketchup-y at all. The refried beans were also delicious, and had no hint of the often confusing cumin! We shared a Queso Fundido as an appetizer. It was very good, except for the tortillas. I would have expected home-made flour tortillas, but instead we got huge, burrito-style flour tortillas that almost put me off the entire meal. But, since the food was so good, I was willing to overlook this major detail. Further, you also get a cup of Fideo Soup, which is a Mexican noodle soup. It is a very simple dish, but so many get it wrong. This one was executed perfectly. Overall, the food is excellent and authentically Mexican.

This isn't a Speedy Gonzalez combo type of establishment. My husband finally selected a fried whole fish, which for around $15 was a great deal, and I went with the vegetarian enchiladas with green sauce. 

The whole fish was a sizeable tilapia that the husband thought was terrific, and it came with three sides. I was particularly happy that the veggie enchiladas weren't cheese, but actual sautéed vegetables. The tangy green sauce was the perfect complement. And, each of our dishes were under $15, so I felt like we were able to find some value options on the menu, especially given that each comes with a tasty cup of a simple fideo soup.

The fish tacos are decent, but nothing to write home about being overly dry, but not totally without flavor. I am used to an aioli or some sort of jalapeno mayo to help moisten the fish, so I just used the salsa instead. Maybe it's just how this place does tacos pescado???

There was something noticeably absent from both the salsa and the beans: salt.  The beans were incredibly bland.  I mixed the salsa and beans together and added salt, and this resulted in a much more flavorful appetizer.  

I wanted to try the salsa used in the pollo llora hoy, llora mañana, so the waiter brought a dish of it to the table.  My girlfriend and I quickly emptied the bowl onto our food.  By itself, it did not have too much flavor because it needed salt, but it was a nice addition to other food.  In this quantity, it had a kick but was not terribly scorching.  If it was served in the amount that can be found in the pollo llora hoy, llora mañana, I can imagine the heat would build up to an ass-kicking level.

Being a big fan of mole poblano, I ordered the pollo en mole.  I was hoping and praying that it would be made from scratch and not come out of a jar of Doña Maria.  Thankfully, it was from scratch and was quite good.  The chocolate was used to round out the flavors of the chiles not to make the mole sweet. It is definitely one of the best moles I have had in a US restaurant.  The pollo came with beans on the side, which like the bean dip, needed salt.

My girlfriend order the sopitos, half with carne asada and half with chorizo. She enjoyed them but needed to add salt.

The service was great.  The waitstaff was quick to fill up our drinks and bring us anything we needed.

Overall, I would eat there again, but  what prevents me from giving it 5 stars is the under seasoning.  In truth, such egregious under seasoning probably does not even deserve 4 stars.   I am not really into salty foods, even buying reduced-sodium products at the market, but salt is the building block of flavor and without it food is flavorless.  Here, it did not seem like the cooks used any.  At least there was salt at the table.",PQPWStuex31F8dxlVwnOSg,0,0,4,lPglKQ0kggomBHzefLhUCQ

Omar was a server..I think he needs to go back to making ""tents"" He could barely speak english and this must of been his 1-2 day on the job. Each thing he did, he needed to check with someone. He needed help taking our simple order. Simple order 2 Tacos and 2 Enchalidas. He couldn't seem to understand that all I wanted was 2 cheese enchilda's. He kept asking me if I wanted beef or chicken. Told him i wanted just cheese,onion and olives. After the second waiter explained it to him he seemed to finally understand. They serve you some chips,salsa and bean dip while your waiting for your order. It's ok, wish the chips were warm. They are very attenative about re-filling your beverage glass, as long as coffer or ice tea. Order arrives..Tacos...rock hard thick shell w/ dried shreded beef..I think the beef was cured in Death Valley. You also get some crispy spanish rice and re-fried beans, actually the same beans as in the bean dip with a spinkling of cheese. Enchaladas. A very garlickly sauce..All the cheese was on the outside, nothing inside..Onions and olives...none. Had to ask for them. When Omar returned he had the onions, but said they didn't have any olives. Which I found a bit strange because I saw them on a taco salad. They try to hustle you out as soon as possible. Removed the utinsils I didn't use from the table, before I was half way thru our meal. Removed the chips,salsa,bean dip when Omar presented us with our check. 
Spoke w/ the general manager before I left about our experience. He said he was sorry and would work with our server. But I have no doubt he was just blowing me off. Offered to comp me a future meal. Assured him that was not necessary as I had no intention of ever eating at one of their restaurants again. You'll get more bang for your buck, and better food if you go to Taco Bell...Order a platter meal..",DxQQUd-gbiMCzYznptFjog,0,0,1,yS7nIGoTNfHtqG5Ayv5ehw

As for the Entrees I always order Enchilada combo or Chicken Fajitas. Always great! And on birthdays it is so much fun! They put a sombrero on you, sing, give you a tequila shot (if you're of age) and dessert. The Churros are a must if you love sweets!

  The bad thing was with the food....My hubby had the Arrachera meat which was hard, dry and stiff he had a hard time even pulling it apart, his corn tortillas were not good, and the beans seemed to be from a can or something...I know my beans...Yes, I'm Mexican and a great cook according to every single person that has ever tasted my food..

  As for me, well I had the Carnitas platter with the flour tortillas....The carnitas were stiff, over fried pieces of pork meat, and dry also...So was I dissapointed  ""YES""...The good thing was the salsa had OK taste and the Flour Tortillas were GREAT I know they are hand made because I make some a few times a week at home myself.

So I gave 1 star for place being nice including the server, and the other for the salsa and tortillas....but ok...After paying 70 dlls for good flour tortillas and salsa ONLY...I figure I could have made my tortillas for about 2.00 at home and a good salsa for another 2.00.

HMMM...maybe I should think about opening a REAL AUTHENTIC Mexican restaurant myself. :-)",sixKHY3cvLIsXgFiHi2fBA,0,0,2,70IWd9C3bw8r7mxIvxTPGA

Decor is nice, authentic and the service was mediocre. Waiter was polite but it was one of those feelings like he was smiling his ass off through his teeth, hiding his horrible day and unhappiness. 

I'm not sure if this is a complaint but.. their menu selection made cheesecake factory's look like in-n-out's. Just.. Wayy too much. Strange that I'm talking about this but I had to tell the waiter about 4 times that I needed ""just another minute"". I ended up ordering a combination plate of a wet, enchilada style carnitas burrito, corn tamales and chile releteno. My friend ordered a chicken fajita plate. 

When I took a bite of my burrito, I felt as if they had microwaved something bought out of a supermarket. The temperature was way off, there were many parts of the inside that were barely room temperature. The tamale was bland, and the chile reletno was mediocre. My friends chicken fajita didn't even come out sizzling. He also said it was cold and the chicken was very dry. 

Would have gave a 2 star if the service was great and the prices were reasonable, but at almost $20 per person after tax and tip I was left extremely dissatisfied.

Maybe the other original location can do it right.",k-35KEBzHxuchfV8Y2WdjQ,1,1,2,UOfBE9-ZNKKloIPY-g1xSg

The place was deceptively far from the strip, via rideshare, which wouldn't have been an issue with great food. The food was decent but not at all great. There was live music and the singer was good. If you want atmosphere, good service and decent food this is an okay spot. But definitely not a ""must go"" when in Vegas place.",ftvjqsXDX2aTU5hXYAJUiA,0,0,3,wkkLk7SLvWQ7R1Tt04H72w
5959788,2012-01-23,0,kYvZZ_aKaKLQKeyms74T2Q,"I've been here on a few occasions. The interior of the restaurant is really dim, especially in the day time. You might need the light from your cell phone to light up the menu if you don't happen to have bat vision. Service is great. The moment we walked in the door, the hostess greeted us warmly and seated us at a table of our choosing. A moment later we were seated our waiter and busboy both came by to take our drink order and bring us chips, respectively. Our drinks never went empty and our server was always ready to fulfill all our requests. 

It's definitely not my favorite Mexican food in town, the spice level is definitely toned down and I wish the flavors were just a little more dynamic. I have ordered quite a few things off the menu and have never really been blown away flavor wise, but it's definitely solid. On this occasion, I ordered a shredded chicken burrito, which was huge for the price. It definitely needed more flavor, but it was still a pretty good meal. 

I'd be back, if I'm in the area again... I'll just make sure to ask for extra chile or spicier salsa on the side.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,6,5,3,98lSEWk70arcjfSglOP64w

For our entrees, I ordered the Tilapia with a sauce that our waiter recommended and my sister ordered a shrimp dish that had an orange-red sauce ( I can't remember the name) My tilapia cost about $15 and had no flavor. Very bland. The shrimp dish was over $20 and wasn't that great for the price. Also the shrimps were tiny. I thought this place was going to be good since it had so many great reviews but it wasn't. It's way too over priced. The quality, flavor, and price made me give this place a 2 out of 5 stars.",g3nGKMGb6GWKqLJ0uwBJvA,0,0,2,ZDDhm5kSeAz3XdlNS7CAVA
