4052,2014-05-27,0,W7DwXa_7LNmETFHSQJZ2Lg,"Went there for Mother's day,  party of 3 around 9pm. First time customers, we all did the AYCE. Sushi and side dishes came out pretty quick.  Side dishes were great,  sushi was good but I've had better. My son didn't care for the uni,  as it is one of his favorites. Just the quality and lack of taste wasn't up to par for him. He ordered one of the rolls with crunchies but it tasted stale. My husband who likes spicy sms hot couldn't handle the 911 roll. The spicy tuna was great but it was an even toss up of good and not so good rolls.
No sashimi (but most ayce don't have), No raw oysters (again usually you don't see that for ayce). That's okay I have my favorite spot where I get both in the ayce. 
I love sweets and the bonus is that you are not limited to one dessert only.  So I really enjoyed the lychee sorbet,  mochi ice cream and tempura ice cream.
The service was good, around enough to take orders and clear plates.  They just never offer refills,  even when our cup is empty we had to ask for the refills. 
I would go back,  but not a big deal if I don't make it.",3Pv_rjPLE7p6mALjtKKyDg,0,0,3,qJ7-xHGEjZXuqqqkDPvqkQ

As good as the sushi was, there were roaches crawling up the walls and the employees were aware of the roaches on the walls and stood idly by doing nothing. I call health hazard because now I wonder if those creepy critters actually got into the food and could potentially get customers sick.

Sushi chef was nice at saraha location. 
Their tuna was kind of weird texture but other then that food was good. 
I liked their masago roll, moon rool, and garlic edemame.
The reason I give them 2 stars is because the manager charged me for literary not eating a HALF OF A SPOON of RICE I almost wanted to laugh it wasn't even a whole one peice of sushi. He wasn't nice at all about it.

169295,2014-01-31,0,W7DwXa_7LNmETFHSQJZ2Lg,"One star for having roaches and poor service. 

First time trying out this location with my boyfriend. (He's tried the one on Maryland and loved it; we go to Goyemon -my favorite, on Decatur all the time).

Sat around for ten minutes at the bar before we ordered some rolls (AYCE of course). The rolls took a while to be made (very slow in comparison to all other AYCE sushi restaurants) especially considering how many customers were dining. It was just us, another couple, and one other lady. Luckily I eat pretty slow so I wasn't kept waiting too long between rolls. My boyfriend, however, really had to slow down his pace and did have to wait for new rolls. Btw, there were four sushi chefs working behind the bar. You definitely need to order as much as you can when you figure out what you want or else you will be waiting a while for your food to come. 

The server didn't come and take the drink order until after our food already came. Again, keep in mind that they made the rolls relatively slow (and we only made two nigiri and two half roll orders). So we were already eating by the time she brought our two waters. 

Skip to the end of the meal...after we order dessert we notice a baby roach crawling on the menu right in front of us on the bar. We didn't make a big deal (as gross as it was); my boyfriend just squished its guts out with his napkin. But to make matters worse, when we were brought our bill, they charged us for dinner instead of lunch. We brought it to their attention that we were already seated by 3:50 (dinner doesn't start until 4:00 and we weren't going to pay an extra $10 when we didn't even order any dinner specials -namely the green tea creme brûlée  which I love). The server then came back and informed us that their computer said that we came in at 4:10 and that's when I called bull. I specifically remembered looking at the clock when we got our waters and it was 4:07. Again, we waited forever for our drinks, and if we got the drinks at 4:07 then how the hell did we walk in and get seated at 4:10? They finally decided to CORRECT the bill from dinner to lunch, but our whole experience was already ruined at that point. Will definitely not be making a return to this restaurant.",olnTacPoKxP_uFRS-__4bQ,1,0,1,ZE7q1VAXG0gGI-gUf5Z0nQ

With that being said, I arrived early (which is unusual for me) although once there they would not allow me to get a table till our entire party was there. Which placed me sitting akwardly in front of the door in everyones way, rather than at the table. Not happy about this already. The sushi was not necessarily bad, although there was nothing fantastic about it either. All you can eat makes sense when you have a large party... When time to leave our checks were wrong and they could not straighten it out, so we just paid and left. I am just not at big fan! Most likely not going to go back. (Mainly because my regular sushi place is closer, cleaner, better quality of food, and more inviting.) Not to horrible but I don't suggest it. That's just my honest review.

315646,2014-08-04,0,W7DwXa_7LNmETFHSQJZ2Lg,"Sushi Mon have become our default sushi place. We always do ayce lunch and order a lot of nigiris. The fish were as fresh as you could hope for here in vegas -- comparable to goyemon (another favorite sushi place). Their rolls were good though none stands out -- but they will make you custom rolls which is great! Aside from our usual nigiris: super white tuna, yellow tail, salmon, eel, red snapper; we always order: frying jason, volcano, dragon roll, mussels, orgasmic salad and whatever else is on the daily special board. They have a more extensive (with grilled fish) dinner menu so its also worth going there for dinner but 808 sushi offers more grilled fish than sushi mon so thats where we go if we feel like having sushi/grilled fish for dinner.

Sushi Mon's service was great and friendly. We get our orders without noticing how long it has been... And we order a lot to get our money's worth! The flow of food coming our way was exceptional and they always refill our teas. The place is small enough that wait staff always see you if you're trying to get their attention.

We love the food and atmosphere, so we decided to go again on our 1st year wedding anniversary, last night.  We were seated at a table, since the sushi bar was full.  Once we were waited on, I noticed the waiter was sort of rushed to take our order.  After our first round, of the ""All you can eat"" deal, the waiter quickly came around and asked if we wanted dessert.  He kept rushing us by asking the same question each time he came back to our table.  Then shortly after he placed the bill on our table. And again, kept coming back to the table to check if we had paid the bill.  This all within 30min of being seated.  We understood there is a time limit, but found it quite rude to have the waiter continuously lifting up the bill to check if we had paid it.  After about 4x of this, I explained to the waiter we would pay at the register, he insisted on having us pay at the table bc they need to clear the table for the next guests.  Meanwhile my husband, still chewing his food, I asked the waiter if my husband could at least finish eating. The waiter then turned and walked away. We received a dismissive apology when we told the cashier we were rushed out of our table.  At least my husband finished his last bite, walking out the door I guess.  Worst. Service.

If you sit at the bar, there are little hooks for purses, which is nice.  There is nothing to complain about here.  The sushi is fantastic.",0_7U8zfCN-0QvTwW6Y3LUQ,0,0,4,kuHiVOZRy_VZC8jTELmSGg

The place itself is quite small, and features a sushi bar, several tables, and booths. The service here is just lovely; everyone--from the waiters to the sushi chefs--is both kind and courteous. Whenever I enter, I'm always politely greeted by nearly everyone who works there.

The All-You-Can-Eat special at Sushi Mon is probably the best I've seen in the entire Las Vegas valley. For around $25 per person, you can choose as many different types of sushi rolls as you'd like from menus with images of virtually every item available for your convenience. Every roll--cold or baked--is made and served in a timely manner. My personal favorites are the Caterpillar, Lasagna, and Pixie rolls!

The side-dishes offered at Sushi Mon are lovely, as well. They've got anything you might possibly desire, from tuna and octopus poké to cucumber and seaweed salad, miso soup, and baked mussels. One of their newest additions is the sashimi salad, which is simply to die for.

The dessert is, without saying, extraordinary. The green tea ice cream is a must, as are their various flavors of mochi. If you're looking for a quaint little place to have sushi or any other Japanese dishes, this is the place to be!",ylGrXqeg43VSVp0JtcFqqw,0,0,5,vO27pnn4fM4MCjh0NyraEw

The rolls are always delicious, and well made, especially when they're AYCE which at many places tends to be sloppy. My favorites are their takoyaki, baked green mussels, garlic tuna, super white tuna, red snapper, the Moon Roll, and the Ecstasy Roll.
A couple of small things I wish they could improve on are outside seating and a tiny bit more effort on sweeping. With the outside seating, it gets pretty busy some nights, and you can not sit unless your entire party is present. With the sweeping, the restaurant is pretty much always clean, but my boyfriend dropped a piece from his roll today and there was rice everywhere under his seat.

I  have him do an omakase-style meal of nigiri and the daily specials (which are all reliably great!), and eat until I can't anymore.
Soto is good at pacing so you can enjoy quite a few pieces of fish before unbuttoning your pants or admitting defeat, and is quite charming to make conversation with as you munch.

Stellar stand-outs: fresh scallop, garlic tuna, cajun albacore, tuna hand roll, ika with mint (totally crazy!), and the sea bass. Sides of mussels, miso, orgasm salad and/or sashimi salad are also good add-ons. 

I'm not too big on rolls here unless I'm ordering to-go, but the Lemon roll, Crispy Spicy Roll, and Moon roll are all good picks- they have quite an extensive menu organized by specials, fried rolls, and tempura rolls and most have pictures to accompany them.

For dessert, I tend to stick to the classic green tea ice cream which is never gritty or chalky, while my BF swears by their tempura ice cream (today's special flavor was chocolate-fudge), but they also have a green tea creme brulee on the dinner menu that I've been meaning to try.

All the staff here are incredibly friendly and genuine, but Chef Soto is my favorite. Even if he's not working, all the guys are willing to feed you the best quality and best tasting fish in town, served with a smile and a joke or two.

You must eat all rice or they charge you"" says the waitress. Who is ""they""? Lol 

Quality of cuts is not good as the sushi ""chef"" leaves the tough ""silver skin"" in the fish, making it disappetizing. Add the excessive rice clump to the mix and you get expensive gas station quality sushi.

1 star for the can of Febreeze in the bathroom.  Thank you ;)

Tip: You can easily dump their excess sushi by putting all of it into a napkin and flushing it into their toilet! Or load your mouth and spit it into the toilet, if you don't want to keep asking for napkins!)

Health: Kitchen has a moldy stink to it. You may want to give it a wiff while waiting for your table. You may change you dining plans afterwards. I didn't notice it until I went to dump my rice load.

When the 2nd order had been placed, our server returned 10min later & rudely questioned if we could even finish our order. This led to another 10min wait before receiving our food. I understand having to serve & accommodate other orders/customers, but the delivery of our food was a slow & drawn out process, especially when compared to the super quick food drops when we first sat down. Sushi that was supposed to be hot was cold, & the cold sushi was warm as if it had been sitting out. At this point we knew we were no longer wanted.

2071861,2016-01-20,13,W7DwXa_7LNmETFHSQJZ2Lg,"If I could eat sushi everyday for the rest of my life I would. Sushi Mon is a cute lil' sushi restaurant located on Sahara and Cimarron next to Nothing Bundt Cakes. I was being lazy one night and didn't want to dine in, so I got my food to go. Staff was friendly and my order came out quickly. I ordered three rolls:

Sushi Mon Lasagna
Pastel 
Domingo

One thing to note is that the sauces come on the side with to go orders. This is good because it gives me a chance to try the rolls naked. I loved the Domingo roll. It has tuna and avocado with jalapeño salsa on top and ponzu sauce. This roll was super tasty as is, but the addition of ponzu sauce upped the ante for me. I wouldn't hesitate to order this again.

The lasagna was a second favorite. This roll is very decadent. Cream cheese and scallops baked on top of a California roll and smothered in eel sauce. Soooo good and probably a billion calories a piece, but so worth it. I was hesitant the first time I ever tried a lasagna roll. Who knew cream cheese would be so good with fish? Not me. But it is amazing. This is a very rich roll so maybe try half if you have never had it before. 

The pastel was good as well but was my least favorite. It had shrimp and crab wrapped in soy paper, and shrimp and avocado on top. I omitted the cream cheese from this roll but it does come with it. After that lasagna roll I couldn't think about eating more cream cheese. Eel sauce and spicy mayo top this, but I felt like the sauces didn't add much to a pretty plain roll. 

While I sat and waited for my order I was offered water which I declined but thought was nice. Everyone I came across was nice and they even thanked me for waiting. I will be back for the AYCE- Lunch is $21.95 and dinner is $26.95.",JYcCYNWs8Ul6ewG5kCYW4Q,26,23,4,8_xhJ7pprCat12JqrgADsw

Nice salmon belly and yellowtail belly. Very buttery toro. Sushi rice in the nigiri was on the warm side, and loosely packed - and I appreciated that. All of the nigiri was prepared like this. Kazu-san's got skills!

I was also served a perfectly broiled Yellowtail Collar - medium rare. Delicious. The scallop sushi was very firm and fresh - the closest to live I've had in nigiri form. (Sushi Koma's scallop sushi is rather slimy+fishy in comparison.)

My new hand roll rule: Only order hand rolls one-at-a-time at the sushi bar *only* (to maintain a crispy nori cone). Makes all the difference. Your hand roll nori will become a soggy latex funnel if you let it sit for more than 20 seconds. Gobble it up as soon as it is made!

I am again a big fan of the 'new' Sushi Mon. Great service, little or no wait time, and a convenient location for West-siders.

Spider roll - (5pcs) Deep fried soft shell crab, crab meat, cucumber and avocado wrapped in soy paper with eel sauce $9.95- The soy paper was green so it looked interesting. The fried crab flavor was faint and almost tasted like shrimp tempura. I wouldn't say it's the best roll I've ever ate, it was basic and not memorable.

Volcano roll - (8pcs) California roll with yum yum sauce & scallop  $8.95 - it was smothered in yum yum mayo/eel sauce. I'm not complaining since I love that decadent stuff. 

Caterpillar roll - (8pcs) Eel and cucumber wrapped with sliced avocado & eel sauce $9.95 - one of the classics! It was good, the eel was fatty and I enjoyed it. But $10 is pretty pricy in my opinion. 

I think that they are overpriced for their presentation and what was offered to us. But businesses have to make their money somehow!",u_wqt9RshdZsoj8ikLqoEQ,3,1,3,9-pCMYWFjRI44H-qloiKuQ
2601336,2015-04-27,3,W7DwXa_7LNmETFHSQJZ2Lg,"This place has been here as long as I've been living in the area. It is located on Sahara just east of Durango inside a shopping complex. Had no issues parking and came at 1pm just a few hours after opening. 

After the disappointment at 808 tapas I've been craving some good sushi, especially an AYCE spot. In comes Sushi Mon, their AYCE is $21.95 and they give you 45 minutes to eat. 45 minutes may not seem like a lot but at the speed they make them in and how much you can order its more than enough time. 

I ordered some nigiri, salmon, squid, and cajun albacore along with 007 roll, JJ roll, pastel, and alaskan roll. It was all very delicious, service was super fast and very efficient. I was completely stuffed when I walked out and more than satisfied. 

Whats great about this place is if you really want to try something but don't want the 8 pieces, they let you get a half order's with 4 pieces, so you can really try a diverse selection rather than get stuffed on a few items. Remember anything you don't finish they charge you for so make sure your eyes aren't bigger than your stomach.

Get their frequent dining card, after the 10th AYCE you get one free, whats great is if your with someone and they get the AYCE it counts as two on your card so if you go with people that don't go often get credit for their meal. All in all I enjoyed my lunch, at dinner its 3 dollars more for their AYCE and they give you 15 more minutes for a total of 1 hour.",A8TRpa--43-mbig73xfhrA,8,6,4,LAoYIBjMBmVnxaLQFeqdkA

Normally the service is excellent, but tonight not even close.  After our 1st serving of the all you can eat deal the waiter asked if we were ready for desert, and ask three more times before we were finished.  We were reminded that our hour was up and we could make one final order.  I have no problem with this, but it was the first time that has happened.  While I was still chewing my food the waiter who had dropped our check on our table kept checking to see if we put our card out to pay, and we said we would pay at the counter and he said they needed the table.  So before I swallowed we just got up and paid.  I am terribly disappointed and most likely will not go back.

2697997,2015-02-10,8,W7DwXa_7LNmETFHSQJZ2Lg,"Oy. I don't even know where to start. My friends have gone to the Sushi Mon over on Maryland before, and one of them got pretty ill, but she gets sick pretty easily so I didn't necessarily think it was cause to boycott all Sushi Mon locations in the state. How wrong I was. 

I was here the other night on a date (his choice), and I was immediately underwhelmed by the super small interior, fishy smell, and the fact that they said the wait was 20 min but ended up being 35. We finally got seated at the bar and opted for the AYCE, which I normally never do, but seemed like a good idea so I could order some uni and salmon belly. I was slightly skeptical about the quality of the fish, but I've eaten a lot of gross things in my day and figured it couldn't be thaaat bad. 

Well, a few pieces of sushi into the meal, a beetle comes crawling across my plate. That's right, a BEETLE. I sprang into action and crushed that sucker with my napkin, as it became incredibly clear that my date was paralyzed by bugs. Too stunned and disgusted to fully comprehend what just happened, I was in the process of looking around for a server to tell them what I saw when ANOTHER BEETLE came crawling up from under the sushi bar and onto my plate. At this point I jumped up from my seat and my date's face was white, (I was grossed out but also found this whole scenario incredibly funny, and I felt really bad for him), and as small as the place was, no other diners really seemed aware that they were eating next to bugs, and what's more alarming is that the employees barely cared!! A busser came over to take my napkins with the bugs in them that I had already killed, mumbled out an apology, and went on his way. We had to then ask for the bill so we could get out of there, but that was it, no other apology, no comping of anything, we barely ate more than 4 pieces of nigiri and they still charged us for 2 AYCE meals. Absurd.

I always get the seaweed salad as a starter because of how fresh it tastes, and then basically any bit of sushi, nigiri, and side that they offer on the AYCE menu. I then finish off with one of their desserts such as the mochi ice cream, green tea ice cream, or litchi ice cream. Sometimes they are out of the strawberry mochi (which is my favorite) but I'm fine with getting their other flavors when that happens. While this place is kind of small, it is around the corner from my house so it is the one we always go to. I don't feel like the wait time for food is that bad; if you order several sushi dishes at once they bring the next out just as you finish off the last dish. Go as a group and all get the AYCE so you can share. Lastly, if you order an nigiri, don't forget to request their fresh wasabi to go with it!",dWsPTgY4oBizXe9mm7hGJA,0,0,5,FnLtfNO7MNmRWojRRCzYFQ

2852036,2014-06-03,1,W7DwXa_7LNmETFHSQJZ2Lg,"Sushi Mon is the sister restaurant to Goyemon, which is one of my favorites, so Sushi Mon is definitely a 5-star in my books as well!

Sushi Mon is on the West side of town, and my family and I love this place. We used to go about once a month to this location when we weren't going to Goyemon across town. We would go for either lunch ($21.95/person) or dinner ($26.95/dinner). Since the menus are essentially the same between the two, I want to call out a lot of the same reasons why we love Sushi Mon. 

Firstly, there are some advantages to going for dinner - 1) they serve salmon belly nigiri, which is way better than getting regular salmon nigiri and 2) you can get 1 order of uni (sea urchin) and 1 order of amaebi (sweet shrimp). Other than these two things, you can pretty much order everything else, including the AYCE dessert, during lunch. The major differences between Sushi Mon and Goyemon is that Goyemon has grilled fish items for dinner, as well as ramen after 11pm, so if you want those items, check out Goyemon instead.

Anyway, our typical order when we go for dinner at Sushi Mon includes the following items: 
1) nigiri - salmon belly, hamachi (yellowtail), saba (mackerel), super white tuna, uni (sea urchin), amaebi (sweet shrimp), snow crab meat, unagi (fresh water eel), and ikura (salmon roe)
2) rolls - Sexy Girl, Hurricane, Sushi Mon Style Lasagna
3) side dishes - steamed gyoza, yakitori, shrimp and vegetable tempura, sashimi salad, miso soup, baked green mussels, udon
4) dessert - lychee sorbet, green ice cream, strawberry mochi, green tea creme brûlée

Just like Goyemon - this is one of the easiest 5-star ratings I can give on Yelp. The only complaint I have about Sushi Mon is that the wait can be long as well, although we've noticed that the wait isn't as long as Goyemon. The restaurant is not all that big, and if you have a group bigger than 4, it can take about an hour to get seated. 

If you ever go to Las Vegas (and you are still reading this review), promise me you'll go to Sushi Mon or its sister restaurant, Goyemon. Ok? Cool, thanks!",9xppB_mrDBH3agQA8uLZOg,5,3,5,_BXQoeyMuz6baY6HU7uwEA

The tray, the cup, and the water on his head. He was soaked from head to toe and in tears.

Second, when something like this happens, I would have thought the manager would have come over to make sure my son was ok... Nope all we got was a sorry from the waiter and then he started to clean the water up. So I went back to the restrooms which were both taken at the time, waited there for a minute and just decided to take my son out to the car to change him and calm him down... Once again waiting for the manager to come up to us. So by the time I got to the car I was just livid. All I wanted to do was leave. I knew if I had stayed I would have ripped someone a new one. 

On the way home I called the manager and spoke to him. He was no help what so ever and was claiming that the reason he didn't walk up to us was because ""we were in the bathroom""... Which we weren't... And ""we walked outside""... Which he still could have came to check on us and make sure my sone was ok. Excuses excuses!

The sushi is made fresh to order, and it's all pretty incredible. I tried Uni and raw eel for the first time, and they were both a little different but overall very enjoyable. Their deep-fried rolls were savory and sweet, perfectly crunchy, and somehow still had beautifully raw tuna in the center. The nigiri were simply perfect, where I'm from a lot of the sushi places coat their fish in lemon juice to hide whether or not the fish is fresh, but there was nothing on their fish and it was very good.

I don't generally do desserts when I eat out, but I tried a taste of someone's lychee sorbet and I couldn't help but order some for myself. It was very smooth, and probably the only fruit-flavored frozen dessert that I'd EVER describe as decadent.

My experience today was far from those low reviews, if anything I'd say that the quality and service was probably one of the best I've had from any sushi place in a long time!!! My boyfriend and I did AYCE as usual, and at $27 we thought it was pretty pricy, but stayed anyway since it had been a year since we'd last been here. We love to order nigiri, so I'll try to remember everything: 

-tuna
-garlic tuna 
-tako
-salmon 
-blue fin toro 
-euro sea bass 
-poki
-ebi 
-yellowfin 
- 1/2 911 roll
- 1/2 a chi chi 
- 1/2 sexy girl 
- 1/2 crispy rice 

I can't go into detail describing every dish since it's all pretty self explanatory and the last 4 specialty rolls I forget what was in them :(  I will tell you this though, the quality of the fish was superb, especially the salmon belly and toro (it melted in your mouth!) but the best part was the quantity of fish!!! Some places they give you a huge chunk of rice with a thin later of fish... Not here, not this time! Thick ass pieces!! Excuse my language, I'm just that excited!!! And our chef, BEN, was super nice, explained every kind of fish, their delivery dates, and even made us some nice nigiri pieces that were not on the menu. This totally made the price well worth it, and the staff weren't awkward when we ordered half their inventory, like we usually do when we order sushi.  We also arrived right after the lunch menu, 4pm, so it was not crowded and noisy, and had all their attention!! 

Great place, friendly staff, superb service, and superior quality and quantity of fish. Shout out to Ben once again for the service!!!

Not as many choices as Goyemon. Appetizer items such as kama, gyoza, yakitori, and even takoyaki. But you won't find any udon or ramen, grilled pork, spicy tuna on rice crackers, etc. There is a blackboard with daily special however.

The quality of the fish is similar to Goyemon or any other AYCE sushi restaurant, not Sushi Dai, but definitely not shark chum. The service was above average, but sometimes the chefs were a little distracted with the tv or chatting with each other.

4037102,2015-09-15,1,W7DwXa_7LNmETFHSQJZ2Lg,"Summary: Disappointed

Cons:

-Probably the worst fish to rice ratio at an ayce sushi place I have been too. I have been to almost all of the ayce sushi place in orange county and only a handful of ayce sushi places in LA, but I have never seen a worse rice to rise ratio for both the nigri pieces and the rolls. Actually some of the rolls were ridiculous large, especially the 5 piece rolls. The biggest rolls I have ever seen. When the menu states that you will be charge for extra rice, and then the rolls comes out a gigantic and filled with rice. Should have taken a picture of this. 

-Service. Our server was new, but overall very nice and did the best he can. We asked him if we can get a spider hand roll and he wasn't sure. My biggest gripe is that we have a kid. Most AYCE places have a different price for kids. He failed to mention this. A kid that is 8 years old should not be charge the same price as an adult, if everybody is charged the same price the restaurant should let customers know. 

-From the rice to fish ratio, to not disclosing the price difference, can't help but feel a bit of disingenuous on part of the owner. At the very least it is a lack of disclosing information that could easily enhanced a customer's experience. 

Pros: The freshness and quality of the fish is above average in comparison to most of the ayce places I have been to. Too bad you only get to get a thin slice/small piece of it. If it wasn't for the quality of the fish, this place would really get one star.",qmMRjz66pR607eroBLFzUQ,2,0,2,DwGoXWZEMFWc8YqBpFgrrw

They have the same menu as before but the quality is different. I know you're thinking, how I can tell, but if you've gone to the same place for years and the fish doesn't taste the same, then I have to say the quality is different.

Peppers they were a buck seventy-five apiece not bad I was done eating my three orders of sushi - 3 small bites and I asked the lady for a to-go cup she told me I'm sorry we don't have to go cups I don't understand how I can pay for a drink and not take it that's not right I paid for all of my stuff alicart and it was not all you can eat there should be no reason why they shouldn't offer to go cup I don't think that is good service at all so I sat there and extra 30 minutes while I drink my drink and that time I stared at the check and realize they forgot to charge me for the drinks mind you I was upset that they didn't have a to-go cup I thought that was rude but I wanted to make sure that they didn't offer the drinks because if that was the case I had no right to complain about not having a to-go cup the lady said to me oh no she forgot to charge you so me being the nice person I am cuz I could have said that's your problem not mine I had her fix the bill to charge me for two drinks but seriously there was maybe four people in that shop and you forget to add the bill correctly I definitely will not be back and I will make sure the people know my opinion when it comes to Sushi Mon I will definitely be returning to Sushi 21 on Flamingo and Decatur it is worth the drive because apparently nothing close to me is halfway decent,JI7GWv4cUPT02AVsTVyBYA,1,0,1,aTP04Y9gQKyQK77MbEK0PQ

That irked be a little bit, because 1. how much can a one year old really eat and 2. I was feeding my child food that I had brought at that exact moment when they asked. 

Overall, the sushi quality was decent. Like other Yelpers have said the selection isn't as large as Goyemon, but the main thing was that the sushi quality was good and I actually did enjoy it. Halfway through the meal it realized one of the sushi chefs was a chef I knew from before.  Chef Tony is awesome! If I ever get a chance to sit at the bar I would want him to make my sushi.

I am not sure if it has actually gone up in price but it feels like it has and the value isn't as good as it used to be. 

The fish here is still pretty solid, there is a crispy rice and tuna roll that is probably the best thing we had there. Also the chefs don't seem to be as heavy handed with the yuzu which was one of my main complaints in the past. The one thing I didn't like was the Ahi Poke bowl. It used to be a nice starter of just fresh pieces, now it has a lot of other things in the bowl which I did not appreciate.

I have not had any major let downs from this place from past visits. I did go to Sushi Mon last night and a few nights before and both visit were pleasant. :)


Restaurant
A bit small but it is worth the wait if you go with a group. Price is a bit more than most places but worth every single penny. :) Family oriented and clean kind of. The restrooms did have a smell but what would you expect, people do their business in there. Lol 

Service
Is on point, my server was very friendly and suggested a few other food items that weren't listed on the menu. She also tended to my table before the food was done/finished so waiting for the next orders wouldn't take long to wait. 

Food
Nigiri was awesome. Came out quick and the salmon belly is mouth watering. You just have to ask since they do run out quickly. Lol The baked mussels are fresh unlike a few other places where they get precooked mussels. :(
Pork belly is good but not the best that I have tried at a sushi restaurant. They also do half orders on most of their rolls, so if your not to sure if you can finish just get half order or hand rolls.

Cons
They don't  serve fresh oysters and the
steamed gyoza was burt at the bottom of them :(

There have been more changes since I was last there. Now there is a new sushi counter. I liked the previous counter better than the new one. The motor for the refrigeration unit seems to give off a lot of heat towards the end of the counter. Not to mention the counter was filthy where I sat down.

I would also like to know why there are no Asian people working there anymore? This is an Asian restaurant, is it not? The other owner had Japanese sushi chefs. Now the new owner just hires anyone to roll up fish and rice. I'm not saying you have to be Japanese to make sushi, but come on man. Where is the authentic vibe that used to be here?

4765948,2018-06-24,1,W7DwXa_7LNmETFHSQJZ2Lg,"This place has changed so it deserves a new review.

First off, they eliminated fountain drinks in favor of $1.99 (or so) per CAN of soda/iced tea/etc. This move was clearly about the money cause you can get pretty thirsty with all that rice they add onto the sushi (yes, a nice amount of rice with a slightly less proportioned slice of fish). 

Then, they replaced my Sushi Mon card with a location limited Sushi Mon card without my permission (meaning if I had most of my stamps from the other Sushi Mon location, say for example, because I live closest there and I frequent that location the most, I can no longer go to that location with my stamp card I'm forced to go to the Sahara location as it says it's limited to that location only). 

I've been coming here for over 10 years (that's right), and sadly, I've watched it decline from what it once was when i would first go there. My friend and I were waiting 10 minutes till we received our 5 orders of salmon, while the table who was seated 10 minutes after we were seated got their order of 2 rolls within 10 minutes of being seated. This continued until I complained to the waiter, pointing out how full their table had gotten with food ordered from the sushi bar, in comparison to us who have only been served a small amount of items within a larger span of time. It made me pretty unhappy but after I pointed it out we magically began getting 3-4 other orders to our table within 15 mins , much like the table beside us. 

The one thing that their menu has that no other AYCE restaurant has is halibut. The quality of the fish is good, the service is lacking... still. 

It's also extremely annoying when you're at the bar and constantly having to remind the chefs what you ordered, it'd be nice if they gave you a paper to fill out cause it can be hard getting their attention. 


This was a review and a rant at my bad experience from the other week. But here's my overall summary:

There are usually two people who wait on you; one who takes your food order and one who does drinks and brings your stuff. The young guy we had was very nice and acknowledged us. The much older short lady was rude. Got forbid she takes your order, she rolls her eyes at you as if you are bothering that you're spending money.

- You can order half rolls with most of their specialty rolls, allowing you to try more without filling up too quickly

- When filling up quickly isn't a concern, they offer all you can eat, almost all day, for the price of about 2.5 specialty rolls

How's the food???  THAT'S what matters to me!!

Well, as you might have guessed seeing the 5 star review, it's better than good in my book.  It was surprisingly good actually!

I ordered about 15 different kinds of Nigiri.  Not ONE of them were disappointing!  All tasted fresh, but here are some noteworthy ones to touch on :

Uni : Very good Uni! Love the consistency...not watery/runny or overly salty!  I am SUPER particular when it comes to uni...it's the difference between thoroughly enjoying it, or slightly gagging on it at first taste.  Thankfully, it's the former.

Hotate : The Fresh Scallops were PERFECT! Super tender, melt in your mouth good! Buttery, with just a hint of citrus and wasabi of course...only thing I have found to rival it ANYWHERE is YG&S's LIVE counterpart!  And considering that it's not FAIR to compare it, this is the best I've found LOL :P

Amaebi : The sweet shrimp had a slight crunch to it, buttery taste, and smooth finish.  Great choice.  I did not receive the fried heads...you probably need to specify if you want them.

The Hamachi Kama was on the daily special...this is my most favorite part of the fish!  If you see it on the menu and don't mind diggin in for the good stuff, you gotta try the collar if you have been sleeping under a rock!  If you've had it before, you are gonna order it without reading this anyways LOL.

And for dessert, both the Chocolate Mousse and Green Tea Creme Brulee were on daily special.  If you see either on the menu, I would highly recommend both!  Chocolate mousse is a little thicker than their sister stores counterpart, but still that same great taste.  The creme brulee was perfect...strong green tea taste, and I love that crispy crust!

Service was very fast.  They were pretty slow on this Tuesday night, which got me worried about the quality I was to encounter, but I am glad it didn't affect my visit.  But because it was slow, my orders got taken promptly, food was prepared and served quickly, and I always had refills etc.

Only NEGATIVE thing I can think of...I got charged $3 for ""sharing"" with Little Foodie Dude.  He just turned two, and yes, he DOES have an appetite LOL, but it will mark forever in history as his first charge at an AYCE restaurant.  I'm not too mad though, considering he ate an entire order of Edamame, 4 pieces of unagi, ahi, salmon skin handroll etc lol.  He got his $3 worth :P

I hope it wasn't a fluke, but I much preferred my visit today than the last few times I have been to the Henderson location, as well as the G'monster himself!  All they need now is the Grilled Pork Belly and I'll never have to go back there again lol.

Keep it up Sushi-Mon...keep the ball rollin forward and never look back!

5198813,2014-03-05,1,W7DwXa_7LNmETFHSQJZ2Lg,"Sushi Mon has two locations in Vegas. This one here in Sahara, and another in Maryland Pkwy (South Vegas). The South Vegas location is the original. Both locations are one of the best AYCE Sushi joints in Vegas. Lunch AYCE is $21.95 and dinner is $26.95. You don't have to get AYCE and can just order like a normal restaurant. But I think the prices for the All you can eat is quite a good deal if you know what to order. The quality of fish is fresh and I never had a Nigiri or roll I didn't like.

Here's the Nigiri you can order in AYCE (not including the special rolls and appetizers you can also get. Each order is 2 pieces of Nigiri.) My favorites being: 1. Salmon ( A very fresh and clean tasting fish. I highly recommend this to first time sushi eaters as it doesn't have any fishy smell and is very smooth. My all time favorite.)
2. Yellowtail ( Classified as a ""Luxury fish"" Has a rich oily texture. The flesh is light red, A good piece of Yellowtail has very rich flavors. I used to go deep sea fishing for this with my late father. ) 
3. Halibut ( White meat of the sea, Hirame has a very light taste and is delicate. The meat has a soft and chewy texture and lots of flavor. Another fish I used to go deep sea fishing for. Quite an ugly fish if you ever catch one yourself. But one of my favorites by far.
4. Unagi (Grilled Fresh water Eel. Has a rich flavor and should be both crisp and tender. I recommend this fish at the end of the meal as the flavor is strong and may overwhelm your taste buds. You want to start off with the lighter tasting fish to fully enjoy the taste of Sushi.)

The sushi rolls are large and taste so good.  Not only do you get sushi rolls you also get hot food options like teriyaki chicken to shrimp tempura to steamed or fried gyoza.  There are cold salad options too.  The main ""rule"" here is that if you order it you better finish it as you will be charged additional for unfinished rolls.  They have a great half roll option so there should be no issues finishing what you order.  

The service is great and you don't wait long once you start ordering.  We placed our order and within 5 minutes our awesome sushi started rolling out.  The waitress was pleasant and didn't look at us like we were big ol pigs for ordering so much.

The gyoza was fresh with a great filling that included cabbage.  The teriyaki chicken wasn't the best, it's all up to how you like it prepared.  The sushi was on point and there were a ton of sushi rolls to choose from.  The JJ roll and the 007 roll were great and try the royal California roll too.  The supreme Alaska was full of tasty salmon.  Ohhhhh the spicy tuna is the perfect amount of spicy and the Cajun albacore nigiri is great!  Damn me!  I'm hungry for sushi again!!!

I went back to Sushi Mon on Monday, and after the service issues I had before, I was very nervous.

Let me just say that my faith has been restored.

The fish was still wonderful, as it always is, but the big improvment for me was the service.

We sat at the bar, and the place was packed.  Our chef was Tony, who was an absolute pleasure.  

We had servers stopping by filling up our water glasses, asking if we wanted anything off the menu with the AYCE.  Everyone was polite and VERY quick.  

No more waiting for 20 minutes for our check!  

Also, they finally updated the website and took down the All you can drink ad that was up there forever.

Its a good place for sushi and the prices are reasonable.))) this was my review a month ago. Two days ago my father went to pick up some rolls and sushi and the staff was very rude to him ( he had a stroke few years ago his speech is not perfect) they were very rude. The food on the other hand went from 9 - 3 real quick after the management changed.  Not fresh tasted bad ... the rolls were so bad it was like vending machine food. You can get better sushi n rolls from Smiths. such a let down.,HjNwbo4WpHOOpKo5YHgo4Q,1,0,2,tcXgOy5SJSlVxQpJ0QDpOQ

The chefs are always super friendly and are always asking if we'd like to order something else. 
The fish is always fresh--the yellowtail and salmon belly are the best. Also,  the appetizers are really great to. 
The AYCE includes appetizers and desserts and well.
They also have a punch card so after 10 purchases,  one of us will eat free.

5640976,2016-09-04,0,W7DwXa_7LNmETFHSQJZ2Lg,"For 5 years, Sushi Mon and sister restaurant Goyemon have been our go-to establishments for AYCE sushi, but unfortunately the quality continues to decline at both locations. About 1.5 yrs ago, they changed the unagi to a lesser quality and smaller portion. It's been downhill since then. At Sushi Mon recently, we had to send back the snow crab because it was starting to spoil and was inedible. They are serving salmon nigiri that includes sinews from the worst parts of the fish. Gone is the beautiful marbling of fat that should be seen with good quality salmon nigiri. The California role? Though this role blasphemes the very idea of traditional sushi, the one they served us should be a source of major embarrassment to any sushi chef. The uni thankfully was fresh and delicious. I know the quality of AYCE sushi can never match a la carte, but in this case, the AYCE sushi used to be much better. The price hasn't gone down, but now the quality has dipped so far that we've decided to start searching for a new favorite sushi spot, sorry to say.",PQAR1z013WjtH6bMl5295A,0,0,2,Fhiik-T74n7I6pIp8RSPDg

The appetizers we ordered was not as good as before. We ordered chicken skewered for my son .. it wasn't even fresh. It was below warm temperature. 

I come here every once in awhile and a lot of the host and servers changed.. I honestly miss the old workers.. the service tonight was a little bit disappointing.

The hostess or owner who was seating people made me so angry. Although we got there earlier than half of the people waiting, she refused to seat us. When I checked the waiting list, our names were on the top yet we weren't seated because the team of 7 who came after us. When ever there were empty seats in the bar, she didn't even ask us if we wished to take those seats. After three tables left and were empty, we still couldn't take those seats because the entire party of 7 weren't there. She continually waited for those people when their seating policy clearly states that the party won't be seated until the entire party is present. This experience was so disappointing and outrageous.

The wait staff is still excellent and efficient.  However all the talent as far as sushi chefs are gone.  I had to send rolls back cause they were made horribly and incorrect to the menu. Not to mention they were not that busy and took me nearly 30 min to get my first roll.  I am very displease with this place now.  I have them two stars cause the wait staff even commented that the sushi chefs are extremely slow and horrible and they didn't charge me for service because they know me as a loyal customer.   I will give them another chance but not for awhile.  Let me add that if they don't make a serious change it will sadly be the last.  Wish they would bring back the chef Michael he was one of the best.

5758137,2017-08-26,0,W7DwXa_7LNmETFHSQJZ2Lg,"I came here for lunch with a friend, we ordered all you can eat sushi, and requested lite rice. 
Hamachi was great.
Sexy girl was good.
Dragon roll,  the eel was like a leather shoe. (I'm not a dog, leather shoes aren't my thing)
Rainbow roll, the fish was disgusting. 

I asked the server to take the eel roll back prior to receiving the rainbow roll. I explained the eel being a little off, she gladly returned the dragon roll. 
Once we received the rainbow roll, (I could see the color was not what I though it could be.) my friend had a bite and didn't say much, I had a bite and the fish was awful. I looked at my friend and he is slowly spitting his bite into a napkin. 
We asked the server if she could take it back and asked for our bill. 
The server then brought the manager to our table and the manager advised me, ""if I eat one more piece, she won't charge me for the roll"" 
I declined her offer and we asked for the bill again. 
The bill came and she charged us for our all you can eat, and an additional charge for the rainbow roll. 

All together, the woman handled the situation poorly. 
I didn't eat the roll because it would make me sick, this is poor quality fish. 
The fact that this was a ""manager"" asked me to eat another piece of this god awful fish is asinine. 

We received our check with 2 all you can eat (which is expected and we are fine with) and additional charge for that rotting roll of fish.

I'm not a fan of the prices anymore and the sushi changed slightly.

There's a new place called Naka Sushi  on Lakemead next to Savers and this is my new place to go to. The actual owners are working everyday there and the chef was apparently from Sushi Mon (authentic Japanese guy), but left to start his own restaurant. I love his place. Tastes like Sushi Mon, but better. AYCE for one is 18 and 22 for dinner! My family and friends go to Naka Sushi all the time now instead of sushi mon.

I recommend eating at the sushi bar if it's just a party of two. Awesome service & you can directly place custom orders to the chef too. This is the only location that I know that you can tell them how many sushi rolls you want to have. If I want a 4 piece California role. Walla, done!
