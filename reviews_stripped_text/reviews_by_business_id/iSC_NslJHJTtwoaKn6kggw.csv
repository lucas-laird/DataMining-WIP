Well, today I felt like being different, especially since i got a coupon in the mail for a buy one get one free. 

the cashier couldnt understand my order and when i got home i realized it was completely wrong. Very annoyed I called the manager and he was extremely nice. He explained that the cook just followed orders and the cashier took the order wrong. He apologized multiple times and asked what he could do, to make the situation better. he even offered to comp my meal if i wanted to come back then, or if i wanted to come back the next day he would fix the problems for free. Awesome!

Its lovely to see customer service at its best, and even better when you get a coupon with it.",WaAOt_eG0_-yLpG3fI--3g,3,1,4,RC7H_Ozw-ovnF1u4abUjFw

Since I loved the burgers so much I decided to try other items on their menu and I have a few favorites there too! What is especially good about their menu is that it allow me to go low carb if I am watching them (seems it's always a struggle) and the breakfast bowl is great for keeping me satisfied, flavored just right and is most certainly on the low carb menu! So most mornings, I'll be stopping in for the low carb bowl and a large Diet Dr. Pepper!",FIk4lQQu1eTe2EpzQ4xhBA,1,1,5,dhgxX7iPZOLqCazUauWyYQ

So, I am not going to write a review of the food that I threw away...instead, I will write a review of the guy working the counter...He was simply great.   He had suggestions, he had a smile, he was articulate and he remembered my name when handing me my food.   Good job brother!",BVKJF0OYYy9uqOEmEL37bw,0,1,4,ULyLdEUpDYuMKChE56IAmg
