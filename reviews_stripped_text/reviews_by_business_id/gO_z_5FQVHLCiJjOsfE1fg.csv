I have frequented Texas de Brazil and gone to Fogo de Chau and this place comes in at the very bottom of the bunch. The salad bar has no labels on 80% of the items- so anyone with food alergies beware. Everything was overcooked (mushy or dry). The extra items you order for the table were no better. Greasy spinach. The fried bananas tasted like deep fried mystery items. And the meats. 2 standouts- beef ribs and Tritip. Everything else was bland or overcooked. And the meats didn't all come out unless requested- and seriously- who is requesting Chicken Hearts??? And at $100+ for two people, no value for the expense.",7lxEzQEcVTsuRebyA7hfhg,1,0,3,ioDAv--SGhSVzEX2Kdsa7g

First of all the customer service was impeccable amazing great can't ask for anything better they were always on point. Then the food came out and it was to die for and your plate was full can you just wanted more because it was so good.

32924,2011-10-06,1,gO_z_5FQVHLCiJjOsfE1fg,"I cried on my wedding day, and no, they were not tears of joy. I had dealt the entire time with Anna, who was in charge of event management. We agreed on all of the prices and everything was set in stone for my wedding reception. I gave her my credit card and asked her to charge the rest of my balance after I knew the final count. She responded to my email thanking me for giving her the credit card information and said she would charge my card. I was coming from Delaware so I wanted to take care of all of my payments before I arrived in Vegas so there wouldn't be any surprises. 

  All seemed to be going well during the reception. Everyone was having a good time and the waiters were attentive. All up until my brother comes up to me and tells me how they asked him for a credit card to pay. EXCUSE ME?? I went up to the manager and told him I paid Anna before I left. Oh, and where was Anna by the way? Not there of course. She didn't even show up to oversee anything. I told him I didn't bring my credit card with me. I thought all of this was already taken care of and my credit card info was in Anna's email. In the end, my parents had to give THEIR credit card info because I didn't bring mine stuffed in my dress (and mean, what did they think?) It was very upsetting and embarrasing. After emailing Anna the next day she tells me they don't normally charge your credit card until after the reception in case more people come than you plan. So why the hell didn't she tell me this?? Then I would bring my card with me!! The Dj ended up eating (and he was the only extra person we had) and of course we had no problem paying for him, but if they had just said that night ""We need (so and so) money for your DJ it would have been a hell of a lot easier than them saying ""We need thousands of dollars to pay for your entire reception party. It was very disorganized and handled completely incorrectly. And I still have yet to get a sincere apology out of anyone.     

    I regret having my reception there and wish I had gone with Pampas on the Strip or El Segundo Sol. Both had excellent communication and were very helpful. Honestly, even if it's a little more expensive it's worth going with somewhere on the Strip because after paying for transportation for all of your guests to get all the way to Via Brasil it evens out anyway! Also worth noting, we had our welcome party at La Salsa Cantina and it was EXCELLENT! Great service, the sweetest people to work with, and we had a blast! I even paid a little too much on my deposit because we had less people than I anticipated and it was refunded within a day. 

   Oh and one more thing...They still owe me $100! They had me down as having an extra guest that I didn't have. After emailing them 3 times to tell them this I don't feel it's worth my time, but just thought I would note that screw up too!        
  STAY AWAY!!",TE9nqlM1bUL6AfdS2Ote0A,6,0,1,cIvRGwneMopSPCb2hWiRfg

Since my boyfriend and I wanted to go on a fancy date we decided to give this place a shot since we did try Texas De Brazil and liked that place. Most of the people I have talked to about Via Brasil said it was way better, so why not try it.

Salad bar:
They had lobster bisque soup, white rice, salad, sauteed mushrooms, and yummy delicious items to choose from. (Beware: as tempting as it is don't go over board because you want to leave room in your tummy for some meat)

For all you meat lovers they have many different types of meats to eat. The Prime Rib and top sirloin was my favorite. Also, they do have Salmon, which I enjoyed. You also get to choose 3 sides to eat with your meat...we ordered the grilled asparagus, broccoli, and fried plantains.

The protein servers were all professional and well spaced out. I don't like it when they stack up on me at the table. The salad bar had a great selection of brunch favorites and classic Brazilian cuisine. The Mimosa girl was a great addition and was a joy to have table side. Waffle and omelet station was also a great addition. Though a temporary set up, it looked professional and the staff stationed there were neat and the waffle toppings were awesome. The bar and wine display are really nice and looks very upscale. The waterfall by the private banquet area is also a great touch of class.

I have only one criticism about this place. The main dining area does have too much of a cafeteria feel. It is too open and bright it loses something in the dining experience. Maybe a darker flooring and window treatments can tie it all in. 

Besides that, if you want a great table side experience with great staff and food then this place for brunch is a great option with a great price.",vHSm0P2ty5WXeCgjA2W6Cw,0,0,5,yWkWQqgIsK79ZtuRdGkKPA

82065,2014-09-03,2,gO_z_5FQVHLCiJjOsfE1fg,"2.2 stars.  Sorry, but no.  Excellent service of low quality, way over-salted food.  Salad bar had three kinds of lettuce but a very strange selection of other items.  I was trying to figure out just how to make a regular ol' salad with baby gerkins, radishes, and lettuce...is that a salad?  Not to me.  There weren't even any onions!  There were quite a few flies though.  Several were buzzing around the salad bar.  A few visited us over at our table, too.  Salmon and clams were very fishy smelling.  Even after drenching my seafood in lemon, I couldn't eat more than one bite of each due to the overwhelming fishiness.  
I feel bad fo the staff here.  They are trying very hard at this labor intensive set-up.  It's not their fault they have to serve such horrid crap but they do it with a smile.  $40 per person on this low quality for the Prime Rodizio is WAY over the top.  If they had more volume, they'd be able to turn the quality up and the price down.
I had a $15 gift card that I got in the mail, so we tried it.  Not worth it, even with the discount.  I am a foodie and regularly spend anywhere from $20-$200 per meal with no alcohol.  I can aslo handle McDonalds.  I could not handle Via Brasil.  I got a severe headache the next day, rare for me, which I believe is from the abundace of salt that I ate at Via Brasil.  Fortunatley, it went away after I guzzled lots of water.
I won't be able to go back to Via Brasil and I cannot recommend it.",qTllTILQ6JVifkO-5ezm2Q,4,2,2,UWq1IdPvI-um8BRItNDf6Q

89548,2016-09-30,0,gO_z_5FQVHLCiJjOsfE1fg,"My experience at Via Brasil was AWFUL. The service was slow and the food was nothing to write home about. You're better off going to Samba or Fogo de Chao where the service and food exceed Via Brasil's by far. This awful and regretful experience began as follows (this is a short version of what happened as I've omitted several other problems we experienced).  I had a fairly large party bringing in a fair amount of business into this unprofessional establishment.  When it came time to pay for the check, methods of payment were provided.  The waitress came back to my table and hand selected her choice of credit cards (neglecting the ones she didn't want to use) and OVERCHARGED each card by over $60 per card which EXCEEDED the check amount.  When I asked why she conducted the transaction this way she simply said, ""that's just what I was told."" I immediately asked her to correct the charges and provide correction for the wrong doing.  She came back twice still charging credit cards incorrectly.  To make matters worse, the manager lied and ended up charging me an unauthorized deposit.  The manager said the money would be placed back onto my credit card in 24 hours.  To this day, the money has yet to be refunded AND they charged an amount different from what was said would be charged.  The manager was rude, unprofessional and incompetent. She clearly doesn't know how to correct her wrongdoings so  she unprofessionally rushed my party out the door. This was by far the worse dining experience I've ever had.  If I were to rate this negative stars I would.  I highly advise anyone who is thinking of going to Via Brasil to avoid it and spend your money elsewhere. I would also urge the owner to fire the current manager who was present during our dining experience and hire a manager who is capable of handling and conducting him/herself in a professional and intelligent manner.",s4ApN5yAL5vxsdzgtcadSA,2,0,1,3p-Wu-cY35eTtDw7aCVdkw

Also, the facility is beautiful but the service is ""okay"" overall everyone is very nice but I was very disappointed the last time I was there.
On 11/7/14 (Friday night) I made reservations for my a birthday dinner for my boyfriend and his father... I called the day before making the reservation. Lets just say it was a process. I was put on hold for a moment after letting them know I needed to make a reservation, all fine and dandy right? A moment later a woman got on the phone with a very thick accent. As I was giving my information she could hardly understand what I was saying. I had to spell out every word. She started to get frustrated and I could tell so I asked if there was someone else I could talk to, she put me on hold without saying anything and another woman got on the phone. This lady spoke better English and the process sped up. Near the end of the conversation I let the second lady know that it was going to be a birthday celebration and specifically gave her the names of the two men. 
We arrived there early so decided to have a seat at the bar before dinner. The bartender was very nice and told the boys happy birthday after I had mentioned it. (2nd person I told) 
Then we went to our table and the dinner was very good as usual. After dinner they bring around a display of desserts that you can choose from. I thought maybe you have to pick a dessert then they put in a candle or something. I then loudly announced ""birthday boys what would you like"" as the waiter was standing next to our table. I casually said maybe some cheesecake? The waiter left & we were waiting for the celebration, instead the waiter brought the check which in total we spent over $300 and told us to have a good night...
As you can see there was no birthday celebration, candle, song, or anything of that nature.. VERY DISSAPOINTING.
When we were walking out my boyfriends mother and I approached the front desk person and let them know that we did not receive any birthday dedication and we were sadly disappointed seeing how I specifically made the reservations for this occasion and not to mention spend over 300 dollars!! 
She then said ""im sorry, next time""........
Next time?? We did not make a scene or call the manager but I know now not to use this place for celebration. The customer service overall was rough and I thought for a higher end steakhouse we would get some type of acknowledgement.",cWjqAwS705MVCstEKRRTlg,2,1,3,8ONhClCe1faTLuy70iDfiw

First off, it is a pretty fancy restaurant. My boyfriend made reservations for his mom's birthday and he told us that we needed to dress ""smart casual"" which was on the website or something. We were all like.. ""wtf is smart casual?"". Anyway, it definitely isn't a jeans and t-shirt type of restaurant. The atmosphere is very nice and they have some nice waterfall type thing. It wasn't too busy for a Saturday night but it the live jazz music really set the mood (versus the corny christmas music they played while the two musicians took a break I'm guessing).

I started off at the salad bar which isn't only limited to ""salad"". They had rice pilaf, beans, beef carpaccio, artichoke hearts, hearts of palm, ravioli, risotto, and more. Everything was delicious and I was quite excited to try the beef carpaccio since I have never before. Really good and the saltiness of the parmesan cheese made it more palatable, in my opinion. (I love raw fish but always iffy when it comes to raw meat)

The waiters come around with their sticks of meat. My favorite was the sirloin.. omg.. it was soooo juicy and delicious. The flank was tough, dry and had no flavor. The prime rib was excellent. I have never tried lamb before and boy, that was goooood. I didn't get the chicken but I did try the bacon wrapped turkey which was ah, okay. Nothing special. But boy, that sirloin was winnahhhs! I'll be dreaming about that for a long time!

For dessert we got passion fruit mousse (too rich and sweet for me), creme brule, and flan. I am not a dessert person whatsoever.. so to me.. it was all too rich and sweet. 

Service is beyond excellent. They are very polite and quick! Always a ""your welcome"" when saying thank you. We asked one of the guys (manager, I'm guessing -- he was wearing a suit) for the fish since we hadn't seen it yet, and not even one minute later, the salmon came around. The bf's sister asked for the dessert menu and again, the desert cart came around within just a few seconds! 

Overall, their food is awesome and their service is even more awesome. Since the bf and I are poor college students, we can't afford to eat here too often.. but I'm glad that we decided to take his mom here.. the experience was definitely worth the money!",DGDlpOVeUNEkBDYkJLvdBQ,2,2,4,BB-jzQeG-xgu_GA86s3r5g

Great customer service upon arrival as the hostess was able to get us in without a reservation. However, quickly took a turn with the misfortune of a negligent server. Took our drink order, water w/lemon, which he never brought. I had to ask another server to bring over. He followed up with very dry service once and asked if we needed anything else. I found myself pulling upon busers to assist for more water and bread basket. In fact, in closing of our meal, the buser is the one who asked if we wanted dessert as opposed to our servers closing of, ""all done?"" My daughter wanted to order a Shirley temple the entire course of our meal, sadly he never followed up after the water he never brought... Disappointing. The food however was enjoyable.

We had a reservation that I showed up 20 minutes early for but was sat an hour after our reservation time. Another party that had a ""3:30pm"" reservation arrived 20 minutes late and was sat before us. I understand it was a holiday but I do feel that management could have been a little more prepared and not made us wait so long. When we were finally taken over to a table, it was small, not fully setup and there were 7 seats for a party of 8. When we asked if we could use the small table next to us we got attitude and said it was reserved. I said we had a reservation too and have waited for an hour. The lady said ""oh so now you have 8 people"" very rudely. I said no, we always had 8!! Finally after a bunch of back and forth (which should have never been) we were able to pull the table over and add to our table. Maybe they could have comped one meal or the drinks for the inconvenience  but not even an apology, just attitude!

The plus, the meats were really good and the guys carving the meat were very friendly. Could have used more sides but our server was busy and understandably since it was a holiday. 

Maybe we will come back, just never ever again on a holiday. 

Management - take note, when you realize your guests are upset, don't respond with rudeness and attitudes. Offer a free drink or desert. Make up for the bad experience so that you will have return guests!",fC625WsMXBr2a4Ijl_gXPA,3,0,1,osdwmGrSrrAvqlJ9V2g7EA

Service - 5 stars. Drinks were served and refilled properly. Managers came to ask us for specific items we want and ensure they come out quickly. We did not have to wait. Plates were replaced often since there are more than 16 kinds of meats to enjoy.
Food - 5 stars. The steaks beats Sls, Lawrys many expensive steak houses on the strip and in the casinos such as Bellagio, Encore, Aria. I prefer this place over Texas the Brazil due to their very selective salad bar. You have to try the beef capaccio and many other items from the salad bar. Other steaks worth trying like NY, Tritip, Garlic steak, etc... they all come juicy, hot and delicious. I will never go to a regular steak house ever since their steaks will get cold half way due to the large steaks they serve. This is the inherent advantage of brazilian steak house.

Service and Food was Good, not a big deal, but one thing that make me do this Review was about how annoyed I was while eating.
The manager ( Ana ) was super annoying, we didn't have a chance to finish our salad and she was asking if we have any request for the meats.
All I wanted was to enjoy my wine and salad before starting the meats, but every 5 minutes she was on our table trying to get some request from us. Super pushy! Made me feel like she didn't want us to be there. She was annoying the other 4 tables next to mine with the same thing, asking REQUESTS. The Restaurant wasn't busy at all and one thing that I saw that grossed me out was, the same manager ( Ana ) made one of our meat servers clean the floor because he dropped some blood from the meat in the floor. Then she made him come back and serve us.
That for me was the end of the line! Health department should take a look at this. If she does this in the front of the house, can you imagine what goes on in the back?

I have visited many times and have had the wonderful and always perfect rodizio dinner, which is ridiculously beyond words and well worth the nominal price; I'm going to focus on another aspect of this paradise in the south Summerlin area of Las Vegas - their happy hour. 

SATISFACTION - It began with a group gathering reserved in their private room, and I was so impressed with the hospitality, service, food and prices that I decided to arrange with the owner a happy hour with a social group. 

Since then, I have held the same get-together there at least monthly, and I am a regular there on my own. Here is why:

TRY IT, YOU'LL LIKE IT - Every menu item (over 30) is specially priced during happy hour, which lasts longer than most ""bar"" happy hours: 5pm-close, Sun-Thu; 5pm-8pm, Fri-Sat. Everything I have tried is spectacular, and our members love the place, so we continue to return. The selection of food, spirits and wines from around the world and all this restaurant has to offer is a reflection of the owners, who are awesome, kindred people!

YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED - Dressy or casual (respect yourself). The list of what I have always enjoyed at Via Brasil Steakhouse is too immense to list. Here is the link to their website:  http://viabrasilsteakhouse.com/",epzqx1QrcKRKfICnWpGWdg,1,0,5,xHJqDJqNEKqj8_PNjnb-QQ

My faves were the beef ribs, garlic top sirloin and filet wrapped in bacon. I love the option to choose your sides, too (yucca fries were great). They also had servers going around with some type of baked mozzarella and hot garlic bread. 

The only thing that bothered me early on was the GM (the reason for 4 instead of 5 stars).I received a buy one get one free email for being part of the e-club. I gave my email when making the reservations. Apparently they wrote the email address incorrectly but the GM approached us at our table (as we were barely starting to eat our salads) accusing me of using someone else's coupon because my email wasn't in their database. I repeated my email address to make sure he had the right one but he didn't bother listening or double checking. So I said I can show the email on my phone and he immediately said I probably had someone forward it to me. After showing the email on my phone which was obviously sent to me directly, he realized they wrote the email wrong. He didn't really apologize for his mistake nor his approach. It made us feel uncomfortable but we chose to ignore it so we could enjoy our meal. Other than that, all the servers and front staff were very friendly. A sincere apology from the GM would have been nice.",pTm4TYjiGmgoX1gkiEvIJA,3,1,4,Q3TImRUbt14Q_6MBGpOdVw

We walked in without having any reservations and were greeted and seated right away. The hostess was super friendly and informative.

 Shortly after being seated we were greeted by our server. He had a charming personality and thoroughly explained how everything worked.

We then headed for the salad bar and they had so many wonderful choices. They had options between salad, appetizers, meats & cheeses, pasta, chicken, soup, and more. I got the Alfredo pasta, potato sald, seafood salad,  and bruschetta. My favorite thing was the seafood salad. It tasted so fresh and was just simply amazing. 

After eating the salad bar options, we then started the meat service. (We also had the Pao De Queijo brought to our table as soon as we sat down-which is bread with a cheese center). The meat was absolutely phenomenal and so many options. I got things like beef short ribs, grilled shrimp, lamb, new york, rib eye, filet wrapped in bacon, turkey wrapped in bacon, pork, Brazilian sausage, picanha, and there was so many more that I can't entirely remember. My favorites were definitely the turkey wrapped in bacon and the grilled shrimp. All of the meat was juicy and full of flavor. We also got some side dishes of friend bananas and sauteed mushrooms. They were incredible. 

Our server made sure to check in on us to see how everything was, made sure we always had water in our glasses, made sure we had certain meats brought to our table (and at the exact temperature we requested) and brought out our side dishes right away. The manager also personally stopped by and introduced herself and made sure everything was to our liking as well, she was so sweet. 

We finished off our meal with banana flambe, and it was just spectacular. 

For the price of the meal we got we received meats, side dishes, and we were able to eat from the salad bar all you can eat, it was definitely worth it. 

I will be returning multiple times cause everything passed my expectations. I also plan on booking a private event here in the near future as well. 

If you're a meat lover, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND checking this Brazilian steakhouse house out. You won't be disappointed",jCjyrQKb7Dbn8vkwCYs0YA,1,1,5,70f2RpyK8-Ud_VVit-Kn2A

Via Brasil offers good quality and provides great service. Have tried their Rodzilian dinner with beautiful salad bar and lovely meats, Sunday Brunch  (includes the same menu) and Happy Hour..  Beautiful room - more restful than the competition and very attentive service and friendly bartenders. . 

Happy Hour customers agree with me it's the best one in Las Vegas even with their recent price increases. .  Beer, wine, well drinks, mojitos and Capirinhas  range  from $4 - $6 dollars during HH.   HH Food is generally  small plates with some entree alternatiaves.   . Very large HH menu.  Some of my favorite dishes: Caesar Salad 4.50  (best in town and good portion) you can add chicken or steak to make it a meal.  Beef Carpaccio 6.50,  Asparagus Risotto  6.50 (large portion), They also have small portions of the steakhouse options which are yummy.  Restaurant has a lot of options for group events as well (Private dining room etc...)

This is a family run operation. The son and his wife manage this location and are always welcoming and friendly.  Friendly customers. This is my go to spot in Vegas.   Sign up for their email club and receive $25.00 off your first visit!",fL1pyN5aDrbINRe-DTrduA,3,2,4,TovybxVRgdcF2NR7eC3nBw

Everything was going fine till at the very end as I finishing up my final drink.  We ran individual tabs and I already paid my tab.  Apparently because I was one of the last to leave the table I was accosted by a Via Brasil employee about someone else in the group whom I did not personally know who did not pay her tab and the employee demanded me to pay her tab.  I told him I already paid mine and I shouldn't be penalized because of a deadbeat I didn't personally know.

I looked around and noticed everyone else in the group was gone.  I had no choice but to pay and I ended up doing so by slamming the money to pay for the deadbeat's tab on the table and I let them know that they were over the top on me and they don't care about potential future business they could have received from me.  I let the group leader know by email about the experience later that night and the next day she did meet me and paid me back, which was nice.  Over the next several days I called Via Brasil to speak with the owner to discuss my bad experience because the staff was so hard up about collecting the money from me even if I did not personally owe them that money...I was told each time the owner was not there and I left messages that went unreturned.

gal pals Susan and Justin went with me to eat at Via Brazil. We started by ordering a pitcher of PINEAPPLE SANGRIA. 
The glass was 9 bucks and the pitcher 23.00  didn't take a rocket scientist to figure out which one to order.  It was delicious, so tasty , remarkable white wine and fruit sangria that really went well with what was to come. 
Since I am a carnivore, and this is a carnivores dream- I have to say it was amazingly good. The salad bar had so many tasty items - I don't suggest filling up on these ... because the main attraction is the meat. 
and ohhhh the meat was soooo good. 
They start your meal with these little cheesy rolls .. they are like a hot chewy cheezit. YUM!
Then the salad bar... Parade of meat. 
Our server was completely awesome wish I could remember his name. 
We had a great time and even a fit of giggles from being so ECCLECTIC! 
Pricey so this is a once in awhile treat - but have to say it is worth every penny. I would go back just for the sangria... but the meal is so yummy I would HAVE to stick around for that too.

943491,2015-06-22,1,gO_z_5FQVHLCiJjOsfE1fg,"This is an update to a former review I had written. I have come to this restaurant at least six times with my family since our first visit.  Yesterday I took my husband there for Father's Day, what a huge disappointment..  We kept returning because the service was always so nice and of course the food is delish. But yesterday the service was nothing short of TERRIBLE. The waiter stopped by only a few times. That meat service was only coming around every so often. Not constant like before. They were rotating the pineapple around like crazy though... The meat service was VERY slow. We tried to order the sides (mashed potatoes, etc) and the server tried talking us out of it since he said the kitchen was taking forever to get them out. We ordered mashed potatoes, asparagus & fried bananas. We were brought out asparagus and mashed potatoes, no bananas. We did not get our sides until the end, after we were done. We were so fed up with the service that my husband asked for the check and wanted to leave. The meal took 1.5 - 2 hours (and not due to the fact that we wanted it to last that long) to get our slices of meat to fill our bellies.  The check was $160 for 4 people (brunch prices, we typically spend over $200 due to dinner prices) and we felt so ripped off. We expect a certain level of service when we pay that amount of money for a meal... not to mention it ruined my husband's Father's Day meal.  Don't think we will be returning.",Ll3tesKuGFKE86MiTzwVhw,2,0,1,0CYKrNO11P5W8pbXQTj0ig

1012634,2016-05-07,1,gO_z_5FQVHLCiJjOsfE1fg,"We came here for a paint night/happy hour event.  There was four of us in our group & this was our first and probably last time we will visit this place.  One of our friends ordered the chicken skewer appetizer and it was severely undercooked.  It came out half pink and white with pink juice dripping off the chicken.  Our friend thought the pink juice was from the sauce so she took a bite.  She tried chewing it but she ended up spitting it out cause she said there was something hard in the chicken making it inedible.  So she took another bite but ended up not being able to chew that piece either as she then realized it was still raw.  We flagged down the server who was beyond busy trying to accomodate our entire paint night group of around 40 guests by herself, which was ridiculous.  The server was notified and took the undercooked chicken back and our friend ordered some more bacon wrapped shrimp and fries which were both good but took quite awhile to get as was our drinks.  I ordered a white wine sangria, which was pretty good but took about 20 mins to get.  At the end of our paint night event the server brought us our bills and failed to take off the undercooked chicken skewer.  We brought it to her attention and she said ""oh, you wanted that off your bill?""....Uh YES since it was RAW & inedible!  So she said she would check with her manager.  She comes back with another server and let us know that the manager could not take it off since some of it had been eaten.  We all stood there dumb founded and informed her that two bites were taken however both bites had been spit out since they were raw.  Our friend then asks to speak w/ the manager.  The other gal that was w/ our server comes back and informs us that she was able to get the manager ""to bend"" and was able to get it removed from the bill.  WTF...""to bend"" to remove undercooked chicken that was inedible!!!  First off this entire experience was rather poor to begin with.  Clearly they were understaffed and management should know better than to have one server handle almost 40 guests by herself w/ one busser, hence the reason my freaking sangria took 20 mins to bring out.  Additionally the manager should've come out and apologize personally for the undercooked chicken, thats a health hazard & just plain nasty.  And lastly, the servers need to bring out itemized bills to all their guests, as we were all given just the credit card signature receipt only.  I had to ask for an itemized receipt.  Perhaps this business should invest in hiring qualified management instead of cutting corners by inadequately staffing the restaurant during peak times resulting in poor customer experiences.",pI_njybTKxqScZ0-60mI5Q,1,0,1,punEuoeNPeWzGbwSmwWGHw

1079030,2013-01-01,2,gO_z_5FQVHLCiJjOsfE1fg,"They only get 2 stars because the owner needs to learn some serious people skills! I have eaten there twice, the first time was on a week night and there were only about 8 tables seated. Everyone bent over backwards for us, which I expected because they had the time to do it. We liked it so much that we decided to book their New Year's Eve Party. We were 5 minutes late to our 10:30pm reservation and then stood for almost 10 minutes waiting to check in because a large party was standing in the entryway. The hostess (turned out to be the owner) saw us standing there and ignored us. When we finally got to check in she told us that they had given our table away so we now had to wait. After waiting 10 minutes I asked how much longer it was going to be because we had been told the food service stopped at midnight. I couldn't understand her answer because the DJ music was so loud. When I told her this she started screaming at me that I could stop yelling at her and that if we didn't like it we could walk out because she didn't need people like us. When I tried to explain that I was speaking loudly because of the music she cut me off and screamed at me some more. The other hostesses and guests were in shock. So I decided to ask her name. Her answer was that she was the owner and I could call her the owner or I could get out. Since there were no other options for dinner at that point I asked how long it was going to be and she said she had to find somewhere to ""put us"". We were finally seated last after she seated 6 groups that came in after us. We reached our table at 11:05 and then sat for another 5 minutes before anyone came to the table. There were at least 5 open tables in the section we were in so it was pretty clear there shouldn't have been a problem ""finding somewhere to put us"". The hostess who did seat us apologized repeatedly for her behavior and said she was sorry there was nothing she could do. It was clear from our conversation with her and other staff during the night that outbursts like this are a regular occurrence and the staff are used to trying to make it up to guests who do stay and eat. I guess it should have been a warning when I saw her grabbing party favors out of a guest's hand and yelling at the woman that she could only have 1 item per person. 
Our server was wonderful once he realized we were his table. However it was clear the staff bringing the meat around had no idea how to navigate a full restaurant. My plate was constantly empty and we spent half the night craning our necks trying to find the closest meat server. The salad bar was the usual which surprised me for a party that they were charging so much extra for. It is tiny compared to other Brazilian Steakhouses we have been to and both times they have hit a big pet peeve of mine. They put the salad dressing in front of the tray of salad so lettuce drops into it during the night. By the time we got to the salad bar the dressing was full of lettuce, which is a health code violation. It has happened both times we have eaten there, so it is clearly not something they care to keep neat. The meats were so salty that I had to ask for center cuts. And after being promised they were serving food until 1am, they stopped bringing meat around at midnight. They put out a dessert buffet at midnight. By 12:20 there were about 20 items left and they were all stale like they had sat out all day before being served. The worse part was they didn't have any more so several people didn't even get dessert which was included in the higher price for the party. We finally had to ask for more fried bananas. Once the server realized we hadn't gotten any dessert he brought us something from their regular menu. 
The last thing that bothered me was on the check. The check had been rung up under a different server's name. When I asked about it we were told that our server was the ""second"" on a team and the name was the ""leader"" of the team. I asked where the leader was, and was told she had already left the floor for the night. I thought it was tacky that I was expected to tip a ""team"" of servers when only one person had spoken to us all night. I am not talking about leaving the bussers and such out. I don't think someone who never even spoke to me should get a tip from me. Especially someone who has already gone home even though we are still seated. 
We won't be going back unless someone else is buying for certain. If you do go, make sure it is on a slow night so you get good service and pray you don't cross paths with the owner.",68wjznRnXzSSD2sQj2kN-w,2,1,2,yy_FIj_-tioqNRWbmNwuzw

It's not my first time there , so it's tough to impressive me but with such packed place the serving team was on top of their game. If there was an Olympic sport ""running with the meat skewers around people "" these guys would take gold!

The server said that he had medium well and medium filets on his skewer.  I ordered the medium well which at best medium rare.  There shouldn't be blood all over your plate after eating a medium well steak.  How does a steak house not be able to cook a steak properly? I tried one bite, but couldn't eat anymore.

The main reasons for my ranking was due to the price and the taste of the poultry items and salmon.  The bacon wrapped turkey was horrible...dry and overly salty.  I usually go by the mindset that anything wrapped in bacon is awesome, but that did not hold true for that item!  All the chicken items I tried did not impress and I made sure to pass on them the rest of the night.  The salmon with their mango sauce was ok , but the salmon was dry and didn't have much flavor either.  Now, the red meat options were amazing and well seasoned and prepared.  From the bacon wrapped fillet to the flank steak I could not get enough of the red meat items.  The wait staff was very good and constantly providing clean plates.  The salad bar was your standard Brazilian fare with nothing special, but for $45 a plate I would expect a more robust salad bar and better tasting poultry items.

I will start by saying that the two stars is simply for the food. They have really good food that is really authentic and homestyle Brazilian food which is hard to find in Las Vegas. 

We went to this restaurant a few times in the past few months and have not had the best service which is really a shame. We asked for a table for three. The restaurant was completely empty and had 3 tables seated. The hostess asked us to wait by the door for a few minutes to ""see if they had anything available."" We were a bit taken back since the entire place was empty, but patiently waited. About 15 minutes went by and the hostess just stood there staring out into space and wouldn't sit us for some reason. 

It was so frustrating that it seemed like they did not want our business. Being that we were so hungry we decided to just leave and drive 30 minutes to Texas de Brazil at Town Square. Totally worth it because they were super happy to help us and their service was phenomenal.

1289787,2011-05-24,3,gO_z_5FQVHLCiJjOsfE1fg,"I love me some churrascaria. I would like to take a brief break from this review to let you know how much, to the tune of ""I Gotta Feelin'"":

Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday (Do it!) 
Friday, Saturday, Saturday to Sunday, (Do it!) 
Get, get, get, get, get with us you know what we say, say 
Churrascaria every day, churrascaria every day.

Now that I've gotten that out of my system, let's get to the food. I went to this place with my cousin, Paolo D. and we yelped while we were eating. How cool are we? As a result, I have a pretty sweet record of what we ate and how much I liked it. So let's get it started (another BEP reference in 1 review. Score!)

Non-meat items that I thoroughly enjoyed:
- Asparagus risotto - rich, creamy, just wish it spread on the plate more
- Fried bananas were delicious and subtle in their sweetness
- Cheese rolls tasted great when they first came out. 
- Caesar salad was really good just add garlic oregano dressing. I love salad.

On to the main course (aka, things that I love):
- Chicken drumsticks were the first thing I had, really flavorful and I highly recommend them.
- The Seafood in the salad bar was in desperate need of salt. Good thing they have the salt and pepper shaker handy.
- Skirt steak was surprisingly amazing and tender
- Garlic steak was not tender but really flavorful
- Beef Ribs were delightfully fatty and tender
- Parmesan pork was dry but had a nice crust
- Service was very attentive

So this is where I get annoying and nit-picky (not to worry, this is still a 5-star review):
- The ""Brazilian Mashed potatoes"" were really fluffy. Almost too fluffly. They tasted instant to me, although I am sure they are not. Is it possible that you can make something so well that it gives the impression that it comes out of a box? Possibly.
- I wish they had fruit or something sweet to break up the heaviness of everything. And no, I am not going to pay for dessert after stuffing my face with 20 kinds of meat.
- Salmon was okay but the passion fruit vinaigrette really brought a nice break to the meal
- Bacon wrapped turkey was meh

Overall, I think you should go here.",UZd_TFUcSgO0gRzLPZ8eIg,3,4,5,HBW1-FHXw-Z0WZlbKQS6ew

Our first experience was for dinner a year and a half ago.  The salad bar was pretty good, but the meats were strictly ""meh.""  So many of the non-red meats were super salty.  
Yesterday we went for the Sunday brunch because we had an offer for a free pitcher of bloody marys or mimosas.  We ordered the bloody marys and they were delicious.    There are fewer choices of meats for the brunch, but all of them were very tasty and fresh.  My favorites were the top sirloin and the prime rib.  For sides we were served fried plantains and some very bland mashed potatoes.  I guess for the brunch you don't get to choose sides.  The salad bar was very nice.  They had caprese salad, which is always a plus for me.  Also, the caesar dressing was very good!  To start the meal you are offered your choice of cheese rolls, banana bread or zucchini bread.  We got a basket of cheese rolls and munched on them throughout the meal.  
My biggest complaint is that there was no dessert included in the brunch.  I didn't have a lot of room left, but it is always nice to finish off a good meal with a little something sweet, imo.  We had zucchini bread and banana bread for dessert, but they didn't quite do the trick.",MpV4QvAmbYdw_oPEgIavxw,2,1,3,r7G6sp_54AFqlC9sMqaErg
1448073,2017-06-05,8,gO_z_5FQVHLCiJjOsfE1fg,"I enjoy the multitudes of meat at a Brazilian steakhouse as much as the next guy, but personally prefer other options to Via Brasil. The pricing is reasonable for what is offered, and I appreciate that salad bar-only ($26) is an option (and it includes a few hot dishes), but the main choices are Prime ($40) or Sterling ($50, +$10 for 7 additional meats). Assorted sides are included but dessert and drinks are extra for each package, a la carte available with HH at the bar/lounge. Management and servers were very nice and came by frequently to check on us. Interior is dark and upscale, with a large private area available for groups; gameplay discount menu available ($20 min).

We opted for the Sterling dinner. Salad bar was okay, with chicken marsala and marinara mussels available in addition to cold items and soup. The meats were all fairly good, but I was somewhat annoyed that we had to specifically request some of the additional featured meats for our category. We were able to try the NY steak, grilled shrimp, and rib eye but had to request others like the lamb chops. I would have tried the lamb leg and salmon if they'd been offered but the menu outlining our selection was not on the table and frankly that should be handled by the server not my memory. Meat quality was fairly good, with the garlic steak and bacon-wrapped filet being standouts. but most options were on the tougher side. Sides of asparagus and fried yucca were solid.

1451379,2015-07-06,1,gO_z_5FQVHLCiJjOsfE1fg,"Superb service and mouthwatering choice meats at Via Brasil Steakhouse! I have been here several times. The restaurant is always clean and beautifully adorned with plants. The bar is located near windows with a great view. They have tables that are privately located for special occasions or centrally located near others and the cold bar. The cold bar is kept fresh and immaculate. The presentation is artistic - the chef's definitely take pride in their work!

I absolutely love their daily gazpacho. It is usually served in a small shot glass as a sweet sampling as they are generally made with a fresh seasonal fruit like cantaloupe or watermelon. I generally ask for a teacup to be sent to me tableside, so I can enjoy a bit more without taking five or more shot glasses. The cold bar has a hot section as well where they serve some seafood pastas and seafood soups. Their hot soups are very tasty. I don't partake in the pasta dishes since I am there for choice meats. 

I love the system typical of all local Brazilian restaurants that allows servers to know when you are ready for more meat. A circular color-coded yes/no card indicates when food should be offered or when servers should bypass the table. This allows the guest time to eat some of what they have before going back for more or from being bothered when full or not ready. It also allows the service to flow throughout the restaurant as serving staff carries choice meats that are hot and sometimes heavy.

The choice meats are broken into two categories of prices. There is something close to six select meats on the higher priced selection than the lower one. The price difference is $10.00, and it is worth the experience. Prior to service of meats, you can select from sauces and sides you'll want with your meal, and these are unlimited. I usually order sautéed mushrooms and the plantains. These are great choices.

I love the lamb chops, salmon, shrimp, and filet. They are my favorites! My favorites require more of the server's attention because most of these are not usually items that just make the rounds randomly. The lamb is cooked to order, so when you are ready, they will make it. The salmon is also typically not out often because it gets cold quick and is served on a wooden fire plate for flavor with a sweet sauce that makes it like a finishing selection to lead into dessert. I usually get the salmon last for that reason. The shrimp come out on a sizzling hot plate. The filet is well... a well seasoned choice meat. Although it is not meat, one item that is served is fresh hot mozzarella! I can be absolutely full and have a least two of these! This is a must try! 

What stands out among the other Brazilian restaurants in town are the service standards. The restaurant expectation is that any guest that gets up from his/her seat should come back to a folded napkin and their seat pushed back in if left out. I love the concept of dining and being treated like a valued guest. I wish more restaurants invested time in winning my patronage. Additionally, there is a managerially presents that is not obtrusive to guests. They use hand signals and eye contact to keep watch on staff and draw attention to details. This is excellent training because when a guest motions, the servers are more observant. I have dined in restaurants were eye contact and body language was ignored due to ignorant waiting staff, foreign customs, or poor training. This prompts guests to get out of their seat or call out in a restaurant - tacky.

My favorite server is Fidel. I usually ask for him when I visit. Although all the servers in this restaurant work seamlessly together, Fidel stands out among the rest. When I ask for something like my lamb chops, he puts that order in and checks back with me as to when I can expect them. When I am done, he asks if I want more. When I tell him I am ready for my Salmon, he goes to the kitchen for that as well. He makes sure my water is never less than half-full, he pushes and pulls my chair out when I get up or sit down, and he never seems to act as though he is rushed or bothered. He never makes me feel like I am eating the entire restaurant out of their lamb chops or shrimp. He truly makes me feel like I am his only guest. 

Definitely come to this restaurant hungry! Five-stars well deserved.",jY1shXf_LQVhSoUyoXqQRQ,6,5,5,jRIzOtB41e4BQZWv8IG9xA

They are supposed to be on the patio, but due to the heat and the fact they do not have misters, it was honored in the bar.  The bar area is very tight and in a short time, became very crowded.  We then discovered a Meet Up group was meeting there.  Eventually they did move the majority to the patio, in the brutal heat.  Our server became overwhelmed pretty quickly as it became apparent he was handling the patio.  I needed to ask about how an item had been prepared and it took awhile before he came back with an answer.  As time passed, our server no longer appeared.  We wanted to order more drinks and another appetizer.  We saw him coming in from the patio and waiting at the bar for the drinks he had to serve out there, a few times, and tried to catch his eye.  After 30 minutes, we gave up and decided just to just leave but we didn't even have our bill.  So after discussion, because we are honest people, we tried to figure out what we owed and left cash.  But one friend so other people moving to the table and was concerned about the cash.  And magically, the server appeared!  She told him we figured it out best we can.  I stopped at the hostess station and expressed our dissatisfaction but the young woman was slow in understanding our concerns and finally asked if we wanted to talk to the manager.  At that point, we just wanted to leave.  There were two issues: they shouldn't be hosting a Meet Up without enough room and servers and if they choose to do that, then the manager needs to swing through the bar occasionally and ensure that patrons are taken care of.  The server may have been new or not properly trained.  A good server would have made sure his other customers had been taken care of by someone else, if he couldn't.

1569533,2012-05-15,2,gO_z_5FQVHLCiJjOsfE1fg,"We did Mother's day brunch at Via Brasil. The experience of dealing with incompetent hostesses and a staff with no knowledge of a proper restaurant reservation system deserved 1 star. However, the experience consisting of the food and the waitstaff service (after waiting 50 minutes and then finally getting seated) was 5 stars. So to balance it out, my rating is at 4.

A little delay and backup of seating times on big holiday weekends is understandable. However, the Mother's day brunch reservation system was highly unorganized and every single party (whether a 2-top, 4, 6, or very large party 10+) waited on average one hour after their reservation time to be seated. Many people were very upset, some left, some (like us) stuck it out and the feeling was very chaotic.

That said, the waitstaff and the quality of the food really came to the rescue. Once you were actually seated it was business as expected. The quality of the food was outstanding and some of my favorites were the beef carpaccio and turkey wrapped in bacon.

I will also give management credit for giving us several gift cards and complimentary desserts as consideration for our extremely long wait.

I'm not sure if I have confidence in Via Brasil's reservation system to go back for a holiday weekend meal, but for a casual meal with family or friends, I absolutely would.",haSh72Q0MsQZUpWPeVgp0Q,2,2,4,0ZP7zsOqBOjC2iKdYrGdyA

At $45.99 per person I would rather give my money to Texas de Brazil any day.

I'm not a salad eater so I can't comment much on the salad bar but that I tried some meats and cheeses that were ok.

That is about enough time to  forget about my last meat hangover and prepare myself  for the next meat hangover.  I always have this dooming feeling that this place is going to shut down, because it was unprofitable due to me and my husband eating atleast 5 lbs of meat, EACH!

Despite being somewhat buffetish, I think the quality remains high and consistent. Frankly, I am very discriminant about what I eat from the ""buffet bar"", while it show freshness, chose wisely, most of it is just filler and distraction from the more expensive meat.  I do eat the beef or salmon carpaccio and sample the soup and hot appetizers... all decent.  However, a little plate of roughage doesn't hurt and can be a welcoming break from the continuous onslaught of hot sizzling meat coming your way.  The meat and variety is awesome especially if you desire red meats. 

I notice a few cost saving changes that I think make total sense.  The table side, side dishes are smaller portions but still you can order as many as you want and I am pretty sure if you finish and want more,  they will bring you more.  Shrimp cocktail at the buffet is composed of small shrimps, where as before they were large ones.  Now the large shrimp come tableside, which are brushed with a delicious garlic sauce.  I didn't see much of a raw seafood selection anymore. 

Service was ""good"" this time, but in the dozen and half  times I've been here, I've never had less that good service and more often than not it has been excellent and cordial.

P.S.  read the fine print. if you have the recent Groupon offer, be aware it is more like buy one meal at full price get one half off.   If there are two of you, you cannot use two coupons, but you can use two coupon If you have four people.

1704658,2017-10-28,0,gO_z_5FQVHLCiJjOsfE1fg,"I was debating whether I should go to pampas, texas, or Fogo.  I have coupon from Fogo amd Pampas.  I was not too impressed with Fogo when I went there for lunch last time. I was expecting to get $20 email signup coupon from Texas which I never got.  Based on reading reviews from yelp, I decide to go to Via as I don't like ""special"" treatment given by pampas when people use coupon (won't give you the high quality meat and cut). I got the $25 discount from Via right after I confirmed my email address.  I made the reservation online the night prior to my visit for Friday 5pm (they don't offer weekdays lunch, only dinner on weekdays). 

Based on how I was granted at the front door, I believe they expect you to make reservation for your visit.  We were lead to a table at the far end, I asked if we can sit closer to the salad bar.  We actually ended up sitting couple steps outside the kitchen where we got all the fresh cut.  I got the sterling dinner ($50 each). It was not busy when we arrived, we are the second table with the BBQ grill. We got all the attention we want, different meats pilled up on my plate.
I have tried everything except  BBQ Pork Ribs, Salmon, Brazilian Pork, and Chicken Hearts.

Conclusion:
- Services (I showed them the $25 coupon, and I told them it is my first time in their restaurant, I get special treatment, server and manager visited our tables multiple times to check if everything is ok, how is the food).  My husband does not eat pork, they make the filet without bacon for him and with bacon for me.  
- shrimp was offered without asking

Must try:  Beef Ribs, lamb chop (juicy and tender)
Great: Tri-tip, Filet, Prime Rib, shrimp, asparagus, fried banana (crunchy and not soared with oil).  
Good / try one first but don't stuff your face with them: Picanha, garlic steak, flank steak, turkey wrapped in bacon, chicken kabab (too sweet for my taste), sausage (taste like hot links)
OK: Ribeye - I had high hope for it since that is my favourite cut, however I do not like the seasoning (not sure if that's the sage/orgeno, too strong for me) I told the meat guy that ribeye is the only thing I am waiting for, he got right on it and brought the ribeye out and cook it in front of us (and ask us how well we like the meat).
OK to skip: chicken drumstick 
- I wish they offer dorma and grilled pineapple for sterling dinner. 

Tip: if you are looking for a certain cut of meat, let the meat server knows, they will bring them when it is ready (that's how I got the garlic steak and ribeye)",DFmYBlW29FaofQdOWlsnrg,0,1,5,oaJiVdi4ZgDI_zJH1uR7jA

I also liked the spaciousness of the restaurant and the tables not being too close together.  

The meats were okay but nothing special. My lamb chops were very small and very over done. The salad bar was also pretty small compared to the other places.

I found the constant upselling and pressure to buy drinks and dessert a little annoying.  It was okay at first but then became constant.  The assistant waiter and support staff was very good.

Finishing off with a Midori infused lemon zest ice cream was just overwhelming of lemon zest. Flavor is there but I would not recommend this unless you like eating lemon rind.

The Rodizio Prime, listed more meats than what was actually served. They kept serving the same three meats.  We asked our server to change one of the orders to the Prime because we had been waiting a long time for the salmon. The server didn't appologize. The manager spoke to us, who didn't seem to understand the frustration of her customers, nor cared that we were unsatified with the service. She was not friendly and for a bill that was over $500.00, was debating with us for a $10.00 reduction on the bill. They were not busy, so the lack of service was no excuse. The side dishes are all you can eat, but they never came around to ask us if we needed more. I was very embarrassed, because I recommend this resturant to our out of town quests, who actually paid for the dinner. I will not be returning, neither will the other quests in the party.

I feel that it is a great value for the money.  It comes out to about $60/adult, but that includes all you can eat steak, sides and salad bar.  I have spent more than that at Austin's or Morton's, but did not get the variety, because here you get a sampling of entres: steak of course, chicken, salmon or lamb.  All of it is delicious.

The salad bar is a little lacking in choices, I feel, but most of what they have is pretty good.

And I must say the service is awesome.  The wait staff is always on top of you seeing if you need more drinks, bread and, naturally, more meat!

I take the kids and they love it as well.  My 7 year old eats for $25 and my 5 year old eats for $7.  Again it is all they can eat (which in the case of the 5 year old isn't much).

They placed a 70$ deposit which was promised to be returned to her account which never happened and completely overcharged her by $275. After over an hour of waiting for the corrections to be made on our cards the manager finally made her way out and blamed her own server for charging everyone incorrectly. It was down right inconsiderate and poorly ran, you would think they would comp a meal or take something off however a thing.

When calling back a day later to have them correct the charge the host said there were busy and couldn't take our call. They are also RACIST, when calling back a 3rd time the person who picked up referred to our party as the ""big black polynesian family"" and was so rude.

Well balanced but not very pronounced in the passion fruit flavor. I tend to order drinks slightly on the sweeter side and this caught my attention because i have a soft spot for passion fruit. Had i payed attention and actually read the rest of the menu i would have ordered the Passion Fruit mojito.

We came from another nearby restaurant taking advantage of their happy hour and someone suggested that we hit up Via Brasil's since it's pretty close by so i didnt order very much.

Grabbed a Asparagus Risotto that was decent at best. It tasted more of a rice in a heavy sauce with some asparagus bits instead of an actual risotto.

Additionally while browsing the menu (regular menu not happy hour) the Brazilian style kale soup caught my eye and i ordered one of those. The broth was very bland and the sausages they threw in had no flavor at all. Also the kale was julienne so there was no big chunks of kale instead there was a huge mess of kale slivers. I was in the mood for a soup and this one didnt meet my expectations but then again who orders soup in a Brazilian style steak house?

I plan on coming back here in the near future. Since it was my first time here i didnt know i can order the same cuts of meat by the ounce and pay for it that way instead of doing the entire Brazilian steakhouse dining experience",7A7FOLZZKL0iokQVOAEbgA,2,1,4,nFT4RwXSFtYJ1u6XQjEFqA

The salad bar was horrible. The selection was small and they were removing hot foods as they were checking the temp of the water and the burners/warmers weren't working. I appreciate the fact they removed the food that wasn't being kept warm...it just further reduced the already minimal selection. 

The meats weren't well seasoned, sides of yucca and fried bananas were underwhelming. I ordered black beans and rice but my waitress never brought it out. I didn't even remind her as my wife and I didn't want to risk yet another poor tasting dish at that point. 

The only good tasting food was the sautéed shrimp. Save your money and go to Texas de Brazil or anywhere but here.",RDYIRJeko3RwnJnoAD1-dA,4,0,1,Bczakudo6iMyDIqw1nWqCQ

The space itself is nice. Very open with an understated, modern feel. Not too fancy, not too casual. The service is good. Not outstanding, but good.

I was here for brunch. Again, the prices are fab. Less than $25 for AYCE salad bar, meats, omelettes, benedicts, and waffles. And then an additional $15 for all you can drink bloody marys, mimosas, bellinis, etc. Needless to say, I filled up fast.

The salad bar is on the small side, but I liked that they also had hot offerings, incluidng a lobster bisque soup, steamed clams, and rigatoni alla vodka. The vodka sauce was quite delicious.

For the meats, there were numerous offerings. A couple were really good. Others were just ok. And others were eh, I'll just leave the rest of it sitting here on the my plate. Unlike some of the competitors, Via Brasil has warm pineapple, ham, chicken, turkey, etc. But the red meat is truly what it's all about - and it's what tastes the best IMHO.

If you somehow still manage to have room after all that food, there is also a dessert cart where you can select from an array of desserts, I had the cheesecake. The cheesecake itself was fine, but the berries were a bit too tart for my liking (and I love tart and sour things too). I'm not sure there's really a point to getting dessert here.

In the end, I'm still a bigger fan of a competitor place. But I can definitely see myself coming here again for brunch.",YMgZqBUAddmFErxLtCfK_w,0,1,3,cbOL295QTmlwXNnbuIVOzA

I walked into our house and walked straight into the bedroom (get your head out of the gutter!) where I had to take a nap until 8:00pm.  When I  woke up, I wondered ""what the hell happened?""  Meat Feast is what happened.

Yes, that is a true story.  Yes, as someone referred to it below as a ""food parade"" is true.  Did I love it?  Absolutely.

We had a group of 8 people.  I did not know what to expect about going there.  But the waiter explained everything to us. They have a salad bar thing- salad, pasta, etc. so I went over there and got a few things.  

And then the meat came. 

 It started at a slow pace and quickly picked up to where I had like 10 pieces of meat on my plate, but didn't want to pass up the meat guy when he came to the table.  Eventually, I had to turn my thing over so they didn't offer me any more meat.   And it was damn good meat.  I say meat, because I had so many different types, its very hard to remember all of it.

We have some friends that are Asian and from Hawaii and they asked about chicken hearts.  Within 10 minutes, the meat guy came to our table with chicken hearts.  (not something I would ever try again)  But how accommodating!  

Everyone was really nice and willing to answer any questions!

Recommendation: wear stretchy pants- you'll need it.

We've been there at least 3 maybe 4 times and the food is always fast, hot, abundant and incredibly delicious. The waitstaff is very friendly. And very attentive. On slower week nights, the staff will almost hover around you. Like the minute your glass is less than half full, here they come to fill it up. On our last visit we ordered the signature Brazilian drink the caipirinha, delicious by the way, and when the manager came around to check on us, she noticed our drinks were not being drunk, and asked if they were made to our satisfaction, the truth is with all the food; the amazing salad bar with its impressive variety & the yummy side dishes you get to choose from & the parade of seemingly endless meats served by friendly gauchos, the drinks got overlooked!! We forgot all about them!!! But major points for noticing that there may have been an issue with them. 

I know this isn't the only churrascaria in town. There are several to choose from. Texas De Brazil in town square, good. Same exact concept but different vibe. Very hustley & bustley. A very different pace than Via Brasil. And certainly not as friendly. And I once used the restroom there...to wash my hands before my meal. And it was not a good experience. Someone had some major issues in one of the stalls and I couldn't get the horror out of my mind all through dinner. There is also Fogo de Chao which I've never tried but can't imagine it to be better than Via Brasil. Via Brasil's location scores points too...not in a busy mall or on the strip. 
Great brunch & happy hour specials as well. If you like meat, this is your place!! And if you don't, you can order just the salad bar portion which has a good variety of hot food too! Last time they had steamed clams on the bar!!! Jackpot!!",qiA5QI85-A2WB5lKRlyCIQ,3,4,5,y3g14QZRi8UxJvefqYQoQg

We've been there a couple of times so this review is based on the few trips we've had so far. The first time we came for the AYCE, and their selection as well as quality was way below par compared to the other Brazilian steakhouses in town. Very little to choose from at the salad bar, and the taste was bland. The meats didn't taste very fresh and everything was super chewy and salty.

The next couple times we came for their bar menu with groups of 8 to 10 people. The food took over an hour to come out, and this last time it took an hour and a half for everybody to receive their meals.!!! There were only like four other tables with people so we couldn't understand why the kitchen was so slow. On top of that the pao de Cajo bread came out stone cold 2x and when they served them the third time they felt like they had been microwaved. The ""plain"" rice was insanely salty, The Churrasco steak was so salty and chewy I had to return it. The Angus sliders Were so dry they were not edible.

2071858,2014-10-13,6,gO_z_5FQVHLCiJjOsfE1fg,"Extremely disappointed with this place after our visit last Sunday for my grandmothers 75th birthday. There were 7 of us and we all ordered the Sterling dinner which is $49.99 per person. The Sterling, which is the more expensive choice, offers 21 meats including bacon wrapped filet, porterhouse, lamb, strip steak, etc. All the meat you can want plus unlimited sides and salad bar, sounds good right? WRONG! 

I'll start off with the salad bar. It was very tiny compared to its competitors. There was a small section of lettuce and toppers to make your own salad, some specialty cold cuts and cheeses, a few hot items and some cold salads. Blah. Nothing stood out, but obviously the salad bar is just a filler. Skip this if at all possible. 

The sides. They have a good selection, but again nothing really stood out and these are also fillers. We got the steak fries, which are not the thick fries they are actually skinny so I don't know why they call them steak fries, fried banana, mashed potatoes, yucca fries and sautéed mushrooms. All served with your meal, and unlimited.  

The ""rodzio"" style dinner left something to be desired. As I said we all got the Sterling dinner. Of the 21 meats on the menu, we may have tried 15 and that's because they did not offer the others. We were offered shrimp, garlic bread, and flank steak a ton of times, yet the expensive meats such as the filet were offered sparingly. When they finally brought the filet to the table everyone opted for some. It was wrapped in bacon which was hardly cooked, so it made the filet chewy and overly salty. Most took the bacon off. When they came around again we asked if they could make the filet without bacon, and they said sure and it would be 10 minutes. No problem. I am not joking when I say we did not get the filet for a good 40 minutes even after we talked to a manager who said she would get it out to us asap. She did mention that the filet had been offered to our table 3 times, which is interesting that they keep track of that. I guess to throw it back in your face when you complain? I'm sorry.. Is $50 a person not enough to warrant more than 3 trips to our table with the prime meats? Disgusting. 

Side note the place was not busy at all, we went Sunday night at 5:30 and there were maybe 8-10 tables so I am not sure what the deal was. Most of the meats we did get were good. I enjoyed the top sirloin and the filet without bacon. I can't look past the bad service and the fact we weren't offered all the meats that we paid for. Looking at their menu now, I never saw the lamb shank, pork ribs, tangy chicken, salmon, or Brazilian pork. They sat us at a big round table at the back of the restaurant in the corner, I kinda feel like we were just shoved off to the side and ignored. Oh and another thing is be prepared to eat in the dark. They have the lights down so low, you can't even tell which meat is which and what your eating. Super annoying. I get wanting to have ambiance, but they go a little too far. 

And finally the icing on the cake is that we told them it was grandma's birthday and wanted to get her a piece of cheesecake, her favorite dessert, and they brought caramel flan. What the hell! She doesn't even like flan. It's like they didn't care to accommodate any of our requests at all. We were paying for the dessert, although it should have been comped after spending $350, but they still couldn't get it right. Extremely, extremely disappointing. After expressing our concerns to the manager she did take $10 off everyone's dinner, which is the only why I gave them a star. But that won't save them. Texas DE Brazil from here on out.

First, they would not take my groupon, claiming that the Sunday before Valentine's Day was a holiday.  If they are going to have liberal interpretations of holidays, they need to put the exact dates on the groupon.  It's not like the groupon lasts forever, like restaurant.com certificates do.  Just figure out the dates for the period that the groupon is valid and put them on there.  Voila, problem solved.  In addition, they had the server give us the bad news.  The manager needs to step up and deal with those things, not leave it to the poor server.  I contacted Groupon and, fortunately, they gave me my money back.  Groupon is so nice about stuff like that.

Second, the service this time was slow and strange.  It took a while for our server to notice that we were out of drinks.  Meanwhile, the same guy kept coming by over and over and over again with lamb chops even though we had refused over and over and over again.  He was seriously acting like a zombie.  A zombie with lamb chops on a very sharp metal stick.

Third, at the end of this month they are adding an all-you-can-eat pasta option for $22.95.  I think this automatically makes this place less classy.  It also shows me that they are getting a little greedy because the food cost for pasta is so low.  It's going to be like a pricey Olive Garden with people running around with sharp metal sticks with meat on them.  Plus, if the servers can't handle drinks consistently, I'm not sure they can handle AYCE pasta.  Unless the pasta comes on sticks.  :) 

On the positive side, the salmon, which is served from a cart, was excellent.  Nicely cooked with a tasty mango sauce.  The man serving the salmon was really enthusiastic and nice.  He even remembered when he came back a second time that we had already had the salmon and appropriately asked if we'd like some more.  Also, the woman operating the dessert cart was super nice and helpful.

The BF said that all the meats were really good and not as tough as TDB's meats.  The salad bar had a little less selection in the vegetable area, but there was beef carpaccio (better than Brio's apparently), mussels, and other seafood selections not offered at TDB.  The passed meats included picanha, rib eye, flank steak, leg of lamb, rack of lamb, bacon wrapped turkey, chicken, baby back pork ribs, beef ribs, salmon, and Brazilian sausage (I couldn't stop laughing when the BF told the guy with the sausage how much he ""love[s] Brazilian sausage"").

The sides that the AYCE Rodizio dinner comes with are mashed potatoes, steamed vegetables, cheese rolls, cinnamon sugar bananas (yum), and others upon request (just ask your waiter) all included in the set price.  The only thing that wasn't included was dessert.

Before coming I visited their website and signed up for their weekly newsletter and received an e-mail for 20% off  their Rodizio dinner for up to 4 people - awesome, now we can do a double date with our friends.

The service here was really good.  Our water glasses were always filled, and they asked (before we had to ask) if we would like more Coke - a very rare experience.  We were looking for the lamb so we asked the flank steak guy and literally 1 minute after he left, the lamb dude showed up - amazing.  

Also they have a mini-Rodizio offering AYCE 5 meats (picanha, ribeye, lamb, turkey wrapped in bacon, and salmon) for only $18.95 (Available in the bar and patio area only).

If you are not familar with the concept these brazilian steakhouses are an all you eat motif with a salad bar and then meats on long skewers are brought to the table and you can have as much of them as you desire.

Most of the meats were hot (not all) and flavorful.  There was prime rib, steak, chicken, sausage and some I am probably forgetting.  They also include in the price all of the side dishes you want, served in a family style fashion, meaning enough for the whole table.  The sides were OK but not that special.

I actually found while the salad bar had many choices along with soup that making an old fashion salad was not an option.  But if the salad bar is your thing you are going here for the wrong reason and paying way too much.

We were celebrating a 60 year anniversary for my girlfriend's parent and they made us feel special and catered to the 80 year olds well.

My biggest complaint and one which really lasted with me was that the servers and our waiter while seeming polite were actually rude when it came to interrupting on-going conversations at the table.  None of the servers or the waiters seemed even remotely aware that when they come to the table with questions or food to say ""excuse me"" or wait until they were noticed and instead they proceeded to talk at us with no regard to what was going on at the table.  In some ways I am betting they see this as being attentive but if the same thing happened any other place it would have been classified as what it was, rude.

In my opinion and this is what Yelp is all about, the staff was poorly trained in this one area.  They were otherwise quite gracious.

One last issue and while it was only $7, we had purchased a restaurant.com certificate for $3 which was to cover the first $25 of the bill.  They informed us they were no longer accepting the certificates and offered us a $15 discount. How you can decide to cancel an offer we already paid for is beyond me and they tried to appease us but ended up cheating us out of a few dollars, just not cool.

For those who love beef and who can afford over $40 for dinner this place is still a great experience and be aware as others have written that unless you want to pay dearly for water be specific and ask for tap water.",Du9u6dXgWYubbnZuor1KqQ,1,0,3,qVnEeSwUzhtTjihPWZLcow

We came on a weekday when they first opened for the night. The meats were delicious, the salad bar was completely stocked and our server and his helper were great. He answered all of our questions, as I was also inquiring about the king crab legs for my kids; whom we wanted to bring at a later time. Our sides and sauces came out as ordered and they both would pop in from time to time to check in and see how we were doing and make small talk. 
Fast forward to the second time coming here. What a let down to say the very least! We came on a weekend, had reservations for 8:30 and brought our kids and daughter in law (a party of 6) after totally talking this place up. I was surprised to see that it was a ghost town for being the weekend. No problem tho. I figured we would just get exceptional service because they weren't busy at all...wrong!  First we got bum rushed the minute we sat down with like 3 waiters (or 1 and his 2 helpers?) the vibe we got right off the bat from them was, hurry up an order, eat, and get out. They were not friendly at all. In fact, the main waiter acted like he was in a rush, was super busy or was trying to get off early. We all ordered the sterling with 3 orders of the king crab legs and headed off to the salad bar...Which by the way was half empty, like they didn't bother to restock it. I thought paying these kinds of prices only to have the salad bar be pretty much empty?! Get back to the table and literally 4 meat guys are already standing by our table about to bum rush us like our servers did. None of them were friendly at all either. The meat this time, had no flavor or was super salty. We ordered sides and sauces and did not receive some of them. The only drinks they refilled was our waters, didn't bother to refill our sodas or tea (nor did they even ask if we wanted it refilled). The kicker, was when our 3 orders of ""supposed"" king crab legs came out. It was a complete joke! It was crab alright...but NOT king crab legs. They were the skinniest legs and smallest portions I've ever seen. When we questioned our waiter about it, he bought the manager over and even he looked embarrassed. Of course he wasn't going to say anything bad. He just stated, that's how they are and left. Knowing we were unhappy our servers attitudes got worse and they started rushing us even more. Like they wanted us to stop eating, pay and leave. By this time, that's exactly what we wanted to do. The food nor service was good at all. One of the servers got cocky and said, is there anything else or are you guys done? (While rolling his eyes at us) I told him, no that's it...but it would've been nice to get the sauces and sides that we asked you for. He straight turned around and left. When he came back, he plopped the check down on our table and put the sauce and side dish right in front of me and said here you go. Just like that, I couldn't believe it! Manager ended up coming back around, took our check and took off 2 of the orders of crab legs, which we thought was nice and reasonable. About to sign the check and cocky waiter is literally standing over me and mean mugging me. Word of advice, as a waiter, never ever stand over the person signing the check while giving them an attitude (especially after screwing with them), because you will more than likely get nothing for a tip! Funny thing is, we were still gonna tip too. Just not our normal 20+% but something. After that stunt...pshht forget it...He got nothing! 
Needless to say, we won't be back here again. Paying these kinds of prices, you expect to be treated decent, the food to be phenomenal, and to receive what you ordered. We got none of that our second time around unfortunately.",fYubasho7eQ5yU9jfT5ZNw,0,0,2,dEmM1nwta6EKbv2D2SIIiQ

I suppose my issue is the week before, we went to another Brazilian Restaurant in Summerlin and were blown away by the flavors there...a little (just a little) disappointed.

Here's my take on the place.
1. Really good salad bar. nice assortment. Would have liked to see more fruit on the line as it's a good pallet cleanser when you are switching from one cut of meat to another.
2. Our waiter was awesome. Polite and attentive.
3. We opted to get the Sterling Meal (more cuts of meat) - They tout 21. We didn't count, but it seemed to be the same 12 or so in the hour that we dined. This seems to be an overstatement. (3 stars...a-ok, right? - not a big complaint.)
4. Great wine menu.
5. The meats were bland. They do provide sauces - but a Brazilian steakhouse is supposed to be well seasoned.
6. Service will poorly timed. It's like a gaucho fire-drill at times. Way too fast with them almost lining up to serve each guest.

Again, this place is A-OK. Unfortunately, when you have a restaurant in a town where there are so many choices, you have to be more than just A-OK.",jrpqhsciB08u4agiYuzADA,1,0,3,hA-WFBPXJEAHQqTGDg8oKQ

The salad bar left a lot to be desired. The sticking point has been the service, which has been tediously slow, and inconceivably so.  The restaurant had plenty of empty tables for brunch. We finally gave up and set our credit card on the table.  The manager finally picked it up, our server then told us that was a problem with our bill, and proceeded to take another 15 minutes to try to bring us the check.  We ordered a bottle of wine and to brunch menu items. I don't understand how this creates a problem. Via Brasil, you seriously need to work on improving your service.

I found myself comparing this place to Texas de Brazil in Town Square all night long.  And here is my verdict....The salad bar at Texas de Brazil is better, fresher, tastier.  However, the meats at Via Brasil are superior to Texas.  The meats are not as fatty and just taste better.  My favorites were the prime rib, top sirloin and beef ribs.  Both atmospheres are very nice, clean, and beautiful.  Another observation I made was that the staff at Via (the waiters, the guys that cut the meat, the managers, hostess) were much more professional, courteous and all around nicer than the staff at Texas.  I really liked this place.  I went on a groupon so I ended up paying $50 for 2 people.",RKXOg4JVTsnJD3AA0k3RHw,0,0,5,NOZQRjDyPPIsnCNDC6QF7g

Now, the food: everything in the salad bar was delicious. The salads, the mushrooms, the pasta, the soup; excellent. Along with Fogo de chao, this salad bar is quite possibly the best in town. The meat...now, I am not a connoisseur of steak, but I could tell a difference in not only quality of the meat, but also the taste from other Brazilian steakhouses. The overall quality of the meat seemed lower than at other places; I felt it to be quite rough, even though I asked for medium cooked slices. By comparison, fogo, and even Fleming's, was very tender. It was okay at best in terms of quality. In terms of taste, I found the ribeye (sniffle) to be salty! The RIBEYE! I literally had to spit it out, it was that bad. The lamb was salty as well and it irritated me. The New York strip steak and filet mignon were dry...VERY dry. This saddened me even further :(

However, the top sirloin was amazing, I could eat that all day...

All in all, via is a good place to eat... But for the price, I don't think it's worth it; for $50+, fogo is the better choice.",JBG3yQOFlM45A-QzVDfGxw,2,0,4,10vafDQDU2dRv96e-LYryw
2738702,2017-12-26,1,gO_z_5FQVHLCiJjOsfE1fg,"So it's Christmas. I HATE posting bad reviews, it takes a lot for me to post them. But this placed earned this one. 

For the first time ever we decided to eat out as we didn't have any guests in town. We made dinner reservations for 7:15. We arrived at 7:00. The place was so packed people were crammed in every available space like a can of sardines. The hostess (a brunette) told us it would be about 15 minutes after our reservation as people were hanging out and they were clearing tables. Well we stood in the entry way with our 3 year old for over an hour. We watched person after person come in that had a reservation and they were all given the same exact line. There were two hostesses, I happened to hear the brunette hostess tell the blonde one the line to tell everyone. It went along the lines of ""we are waiting for people to leave but also clearing our empty tables. We will get you seated as soon as people clear out"" When the poor girl got asked literally every minute by a different person (not exaggerating) how long until they'd be seated or how many parties were in front of them, she nervously played with her tablet then delivered the line she was told to give. She clearly was under trained. I felt badly for her. And if her or her manger is reading this, you did great (hostess, NOT manager) and it's your manager that is to blame for putting you in that situation completely unprepared. Whatever you made tonight, wasn't enough. You couldn't have paid me enough to do your job. When I left I could see the tears in your eyes and I should have said more than Merry Christmas to you. 

We waited over an hour for our table to seat myself, my husband and our toddler. A lovely man with his family waited an entire hour longer than us. Well until we walked away. As we were enjoying our food, I looked to the hostess stand and saw this poor man and his son still waiting for a table while an empty table sat directly next  to us. It was so bothersome that I sent my husband to invite them to our table! It's Christmas for goodness sake. He told my husband he'd finally been given a table, they waited for 2.5 hours! Here's my major complaint. If you're going to take reservations, seat them at least somewhat close to their actual time. This was complete lack of planning, experience, or a thirst for greed. Regardless of which (or all three) someone made a MAJOR mistake and I suspect it will cost you a lot of bad reviews and future business. The only reason you didn't get 1 star is your wait staff was amazing. So to you, the owner and/or manger, you get one star for being incompetent. 

To the rest of the staff, 4 stars. It would be 5 if the people next to us hadn't waited literally 10 minutes for a plate so she could begin eating a meal she waited an hour and a half after her reservation to get. But don't worry, to make it up to the sweet ladies, WE bought their dinners. 

I doubt we will be back. Texas De Brazil will get our business from now on. Or any other Brazilian steak house in town. Your food is great, with the exception of the lobster bisque, it for the lack of a better term, sucks. 

Figure out how to take reservations you can handle. In the long run you'll make more money because you'll get return customers and positive reviews.",qGNl5O3N8_HxUVvltk7jvg,1,0,2,lcpfPHxgHemlhvl3WUGaOQ

They salad bar has a nice selection, the meats are nicely prepared and the side dishes are suitable. Really the only thing lacking for me was depth of flavor in the meat selection.

I love the ambiance of Via. It is dim but not dark. It is always very clean with unseated tables set for the next guest, never any dirty dishes sitting around.

The water wall adds a nice touch and the televisions in the bar area are never too loud, if you can hear them at all.

The salad bar is kept clean and stocked with many options to choose from. The Asparagus Risotto is my favorite but I haven't seen it the last few times we're been there.

It doesn't matter where in the restaurant you are sitting, the gentlemen (Gauchos) with the meats will come to you with all of their offerings!

They will carve a delicious portion of meat right off their skewer and directly onto your plate. All of the selections are hot and fresh.

Charles and the flank steak are my favorite, followed very closely by Rodrigo and the prime rib. 

There are so many tasty meats to choose from, the price for lunch or dinner is well worth it!

Be sure to try the signature Pichana (top sirloin), sliced rare to medium rare. So delicious!!

Carol is a delightful hostess and always has a warm smile and a friendly word for us.

Adam in the dining room is so warm and genuine.

We love all of the staff at Via Brasil, no matter how long it is between visits, we are always treated like family.

There is a reason we keep returning. It is not just the food but it is the staff!

Thank you for being so awesome to us and Charles, thank YOU for honoring my special request on Christmas. 

Regardless of how busy you are, you always seem to find time to bring me some melted mozzarella and I adore you for that.

Merry Christmas and a happy, safe, prosperous new year to all of our friends at Via Brasil! See you all again very soon!",1N6jrRkNvnbthfLN07Yn4A,0,0,5,oQXW4FdDMe-q-HrjEltnzQ
2778538,2016-10-23,3,gO_z_5FQVHLCiJjOsfE1fg,"Via Brasil is a carnivore's dream. Like other Brazilian steakhouses, you'll get plenty of cuts of meat from cows, chicken, lamb and more. I've driven by countless times but failed to visit until recently. Located at the corner of Charleston and Ft. Apache, the outside looks impressive, but the interior is even more so. It's large, open, and elegantly decorated.

If you want all-you-can-eat meat, there are two options. ""Prime"" is $39.99 and includes many basic items like garlic steak, BBQ baby back ribs, chicken breasts, drumsticks, flank steak, pork, and sausage. The higher end option is the ""Sterling"" for $49.99, which includes everything in the Prime option plus NY steak, lamb chops, leg of lamb, filet wrapped in bacon, salmon, and rib eye.

My favorites were the lamb chops, filet in bacon, grilled shrimp, trip-tip, and short ribs. 

For those that only want the salad bar, you can get that for $24.99. The salad bar has an impressive array of hot and cold dishes, although some turned out to be not so great. The beef carpaccio was under seasoned. Curry mussels were spicy and also felt gritty. The lobster bisque was creamy with rich flavors.

For dessert the creme brûlée was textbook perfect with a thick layer of sugar coating the top and creamy custard underneath.

It is a bit pricey (for two adults and one kid we spent well over $200), but if you're fond of Brazilian steakhouses, this one should be on your list.",C2C0GPKvzWWnP57Os9eQ0w,6,6,4,ZsIzKHf_IFxDXmtu-2Ph6w

With that's said, we went ahead and asked for our check as soon as we got our desert in hopes to get the check back sooner than later. We also noticed the table service was horrible, there was at least 3 to 4 tables that were empty for at least 30 mins or so. We started to wonder why they didnt clear the tables sooner as we saw the large crowd at the entrance waiting frustrated.

2837532,2011-11-14,6,gO_z_5FQVHLCiJjOsfE1fg,"If you've never been to a churrascaria or Brazilian steakhouse, your first experience will likely be 5 stars simply from the wow factor of unlimited sumptuous meat being carved table-side and the opulence of a lavish salad bar that could serve as a meal in itself.  Pretty much everything I say onward will likely be inconsequential.  However, if you've been around the block a time or two as I have and want the tale of the tape between two local heavyweights (Texas de Brazil(TDB) vs. Via Brasil(VB)) going at it for twelve rounds, let's get it on!

Round 1 (Ambience) 
This may come down to personal preference since there is definitely an upscale vibe with soothing waterfalls and romantic lighting upon entering VB, but not sure if I liked the feng shui of the salad bar in the middle without any partitioning of the tables into separate little rooms for added intimacy.  TDB definitely has a more upbeat vibe with a casual bar area where you can await guests and separate little rooms although definitely more crowded and noisy since it is more bustling with turnover of guests.   Winner: Push

Round 2 (Cheese bread)
If you took the most perfect cheese puff and turned it into bread form, this is pretty much the pinnacle of that transformation.  TDB has a slightly cheesier flavor, which gives it a slight edge.  Winner: TDB

Round 3 (Salad bar)
For first-timers (or as I like to call them, churrascarookies), you never want to overfill your plate on the salad bar, as tempting as it may be.  However, it's good to wet one's appetite on some items to balance the meat fest to come.  I felt the overall quality was superior in the salad bar at TDB since they offered lobster bisque and focused more on artisanal cheeses and light seafood/veggies options, whereas at VB, there was one too many pasta options like cheese ravioli and other pasta salads, which are like underhanded tactics to fill you up to limit your meat intake.  Winner: TDB

Round 4 (Beverages)
VB took a knockdown in this round since the waiter sat us down and presented us with options for water(still or sparkling?) and upon choosing still, he charged us for two bottles of some premium water at 7 bucks/bottle without clueing us in about the option for tap water since we assumed it was complementary.  They also failed to carry Antarctica Guarana, the most popular soda in Brazil and something I look forward to anytime I venture into a Brazilian restaurant.  TDB would never allow the water fiasco to occur and always carry my non-alcoholic beverage of choice.   Winner: TDB

Round 5 (Opening meats)
Surprisingly, VB opens with a baked salmon served with passion fruit/mango sauce....not what I expected but really good, and the table-side presentation was a nice touch.  Usually at TDB, they start you off with some non-premium beef wrapped in thick bacon or some heavy pork/chicken option.  Winner: VB

Round 6 (Lamb)
Leg of lamb was sufficiently juicy and came with a nice mint jelly, but TDB offers multiple cuts including the lamb chop, which was unavailable at VB.  Winner: TDB

Round 7 (Fowl)
VB definitely had some interesting options including chicken, duck, and chicken hearts (upon request), whereas TDB only has a single dry chicken option which I tend to pass over to allow more room for other meat options.  The chicken and duck were very succulent and tender, and well seasoned here.  Winner: VB

Round 8 (Brazilian sausage)
Like the cheese bread, fairly standard and not being a huge sausage connoisseur, I'm not the best judge on this one.  Winner: Push 

Round 9 (Side dishes)
Taking an intermission from the meats, I think VB offers some additional Brazilian sides like fried/boiled yucca root and sauteed turnip greens which have a more stir-fried crispy preparation compared to the stewed version in soul-food.  Traditional favorites such as fried bananas and mashed potatoes are present at both.  Winner: VB

Round 10 (Beef)
Maybe it was the pace of the meats brought to our table, but I felt that the overall quality of the beef cuts were superior at TDB since there were a few cuts that were overly dry and tough at VB although certain cuts were very tender/flavorful.  WInner: TDB

Round 11 (Service)
Waitstaff definitely more attentive at TDB and the pace of the meat parade was more even, so I didn't feel like I had to overcrowd my plate and lose track of which meat was which.  The TDB meat carvers also wear a uniform that gives them some more professional flare, which I appreciated.  WInner: TDB

Round 12 (Value)
Somewhat tied into service, the server initially took our groupon voucher at the beginning but conveniently left it off in our final bill until we reminded him.  Taking account the variety/quality of meats/salad bar, would have to give slight edge to TDB.    Winner: TDB

By decision,winner of this fight goes to Texas de Brazil,but don't count out Via Brasil in a rematch.  A new fierce challenger has recently arrived into town(Fogo de Chao), so a TKO may be in our midst!",syA7uYoDjohc7gWBWaEZmw,7,3,3,WLyrPUteUYd-3ifFl_WDgw

fat but I'm sure you could order it without the bacon) besides the picanha, it's the best thing in the menu!

The salad bar left a lot to be desired. The cuts of meat were very small compared to Texas de Brazil. The speed at which the meat was coming around was really slow. At one point we were all sitting there with empty plates waiting for someone to come around. The Filet Mignon was fatty. The side dishes were mediocre. The ambiance did not feel like other steakhouses.  Bottom line is, this place is worth maybe 19.99 NOT 50 bucks!  For 49.99 you are MUCH better off spending it at Texas de Brazil or Fogo de Chau.

2933030,2014-05-19,1,gO_z_5FQVHLCiJjOsfE1fg,"I try not to hand out 5 stars until I've consistently had a great experience. But this place is on track for the extra star, as based on our experience this weekend, the fella' and I will be back.

When trying to pick out where to eat, I could tell that steak was what was calling to my dinner partner. He picked out this place, and we went on a whim. So Saturday evening, no reservation, we just walk up to the booth and ask for a table. Gal doesn't bat an eye, and offers us a table immediately. She does pause to check and make sure we're okay with a high traffic area next to the buffet, but we aren't picky and it was next to a beautiful towering wine rack.  

Due to the odd location of our table, I think we were overlapped on our server, as we had two different guys coming by to check in and joke with us. They didn't overlap too much though and it just meant we had great service! 

I've never been to a Brazilian Steakhouse, so I can't compare with other places. But generally, the servers were super welcoming and informative, the salad bar average to good and ohmygosh the delicious meat just kept coming. They had certain items that kept swinging by, but the guys would also check in to see if we wanted to try anything specific off the menu. We had purchased the shorter list of meats, but we didn't even make it through the whole taster list. What I did try was delicious.

I didn't knock any stars off for this next bit. I know that I tend to be a perfectionist, so don't expect any place to completely satisfy me. But, just in case, here's my 'eh' list. 

=The salad bar had some delicious items. (Charcuterie board/endive goat cheese) But there was a lot of stuff that I didn't try because I didn't want to fill up on average looking stuff. Not bad looking at all, just higher end average. Of what I did try, the only eh was the Greek Salad roll thing , which was kind of odd. The meat was actually kind of an afterthought and sort of hamburger like in consistency. 

=The Brazilian Sausage: Compared to all of the delicious cuts of meat, it was kind of tough and not worth the room it took up in my stomach. I think if it were part of a breakfast meal or an appetizer in another style restaurant, it would be really good, so this one's just a major personal preference. I can see why it's on the menu, it's just not for me. 

= The chicken was just a hair on the dry side. This is being super nitpicky though, as it had great flavor. Like, I wish that we weren't so full so I could have had a full piece instead of splitting it with my fella'. 

Now that the 'eh' stuff is out of the way, the great list:

=The cuts of meat were tender, flavorful and even though we didn't bother getting any sauces, they stood well on their own. I especially loved the tri-tip, but everything we tried was a well made presentation of the cut. I enjoyed that they were easily able to give me medium rare and my fella' could get the disgustingly rare slices that he loves as we've had many struggles with those requests at lesser restaurants. Also, the bacon wrapped turkey is an unexpected treat, so even though it isn't a red meat, I'd highly recommend trying it. 

= The 'courtesy breads'/fired mozzarella, as well as the grilled mushrooms that we ordered as a side were tasty. I only regret that there is so much food I had a hard time eating more than a few bites of anything and tried so little from the side menu. 
 
=The Rigatoni Ala Vodka from the salad bar was spectacular. I love Vodka sauce and have had an 'eh' experience with a few higher end chain Italian place lately. My first bite was an entirely unexpected delight. I earnestly wished that I was just in an italian restaurant so I could devour a plate of the stuff, but sufficed with the token amount I'd procured to taste. 

= Service was amazing. I never lacked for food, water or attention. I also really loved the decor. Something about the large open space and pseudo-Greco Roman accents just vibed with me. Plus, in our little odd table, I felt like I had the whole place to myself and it was refreshing. 

=The dark Brazilian beer had a rich, full bodied taste. I was a little sceptical of a bottled beer, but I didn't regret choosing it over a glass of wine, as it had a great flavor that complimented the meats. 

=MMM! Passionfruit Mousse. It was the perfect end to the rich meal. Light, flavorful and it melted in my mouth. I was glad I had restrained myself from digging in so I could have a little space for a treat at the end.",DmiwQUy-U7ZzfX4oiQqQjQ,1,1,4,RweWAMQi1aCd9-q65qBPDg

We walked in, with out reservation. Although the dining room was pretty full they seated us right away. Right off the bat, the service was awesome! Start to finish, I have to say this may be some of the best service I have had in Las Vegas! We felt SO taken care of every minute!

The style of restaurant is a Brazilian steak house, where they carve endless delicious meat at your table. Much like the other 2 chain restaurants in the city, except this one is locally owned and run...If that kind of thing matters to you. Personally, any time I can support a local business I am all over it!  The dinner menu consists of two choices. Regular menu which is AYCE for $34.95 and the Deluxe Menu that is AYCE $49.95. The difference is the deluxe menu has premium cuts of meat, and seafood. We decided to go with the deluxe menu, and I am not sure I really knew which was which to be honest, everything was really good! I guess maybe if we had done the regular premium meat would have whisked on by? 

It was all really great! Mountains of meat, a few beverages and somehow managed to save room to split a dessert! The check total was $180 for the both, including tip and everything.

3024255,2010-05-13,3,gO_z_5FQVHLCiJjOsfE1fg,"Like a recent Yelper's review of Via Brasil, I dont give 5 star reviews often but Im thrilled when Im able to.  In my book, to earn 5 stars means a restaurant has mastered its niche.  That is, a hamburger stand could certainly earn 5 stars like a fine french dining experience.  Its all a mater of context.  That being said, Via Brasil is definitely a 5 star Palace of Food.  

I have eaten at plenty of Brazilian Churascarrias over the years and I can say Via Brasil takes the cake over all them.  I recently went on a weeknight with my nephew to celebrate a new job and we were immediately taken back by the amazing synthesis of upscale and casual in the same environment.  The restaurant is beautiful or being in a Summerlin strip mall.  They have their salad bar in the center of the restaurant and a small, but comfortable bar off to the side.  The restaurant is ringed by windows and while there isnt much a view, it does get beautiful colors and light during the sunset.  The staff immediately sat us, described how the restaurant worked and the fun began.

The first thing we were greeted with was this soft, warm cheese bread that was fantastic.  We then approached the salad bar and soon found out that salad is but a small component of the overall spread.  This ""salad"" bar had warm dishes as well like Ravioli, scalloped potatoes, stroganoff and a sort of seafood Ciappiono, all of which were delicious.  As for its cold selections, there were pasta salads, fresh mussels, beef carpaccio, caprese and a host of other amazing & fresh foods.  I had to be careful, otherwise I was going to get full just on the salad bar so I limited my intake although I could have easily just partook in the salad bar all evening.  In fact, I think its an option for around 20 bucks for those not inclined to enjoy the rodizio selections.  

After the fabulous salad bar, we began the meat parade.  Using a small disc thats green on one side and red on the other, we flipped it green and a constant delivery of protein was soon ambling its way over to our table on skewers where the waiters slice it off table side.  For a couple items, like the suckling pig and the salmon, they actually to table side carving off a cart.  The meats were amazing with special recognition going to the bacon wrapped turkey, salmon, garlic sirloin, parmesan pork loin and flank steak.  

As if the meats werent enough to chew on at this time, more waiters flooded our table with a selection of side dishes like mashed potatoes, fried plantains (bananas) and broccoli.  They have more sides like beans, rice and fried Yucca should you want them as well.  I cant recommend the fried Yucca enough as it was a perfect compliment to the meat.  Think of it as a less starchy, slightly sweeter steak french fry.   The total amount of meats that made it to our table was 16 and once you get through the whole roster they invite you to request any of them to come back out for more.  No mas for this guy...if I didnt have gout before, Im sure my body was one more bite away from developing it!

While there is a desert menu, I couldnt even think about it.  All I wanted to do was get home and throw on some elastic pants.  While I may have been in pain, it was a good pain and worth the effort.  The staff at VIa Brasil is top notch and took time to explain every dish for us and the preparation.  I found the prices to be reasonable for the Brazilian Churascarrian dining experience and especially for the quality.  Its essentially 40 bucks a person for the full shabangabang.  I cant wait to get back and explore their wine menu next time (nephew is under 21 so we decided to go the soda route) and I hear they have live music on the weekends!  It may take 2 months to digest all the food and once it is, you can definitely bet  I'll be back.

As a bonus:  its so refreshing to have a restaurant of this quality in the neighborhood without having to deal with a casino/resort!",9qjLfaAqMxgfqdtTlPwRUQ,8,2,5,HeitVf5b29joovZmh2pR5w

3068258,2012-09-03,1,gO_z_5FQVHLCiJjOsfE1fg,"So, my fellow yelpers - 

Both my hubby and I have a tradition - since we both have b-days in September, we usually will just go out to a nice dinner to celebrate ""our"" days.

Hubby suggested this place, after doing some research, and also hearing the word from co-workers. So in being a yelper, I of course came to yelp to check the overall rating. Then I happened to see the word 'buffet' in the description, and instantly had this nail going down the chalkboard kind of sensation. Stomach kind of lost its appetite a little, and I held my breath about what this meant - but being a good trooper - said nothing and just went along for the ride, figuring I'd at least give it a shot before saying anything.

Soooo, we pull into the plaza where this little gem is hidden, and I was taken back by the very fancy appearance of the building. And from the exterior looking in, I could see a little waterfall feature, so right away my mind was thinking - this is gonna be interesting!

Right upon entering the hostess was very pleasant and very happy to chat it up with my little one in a full blown conversation about her markers! (mind you my little one was the one having to show it off to begin with, but i give kudos to the hostess for entertaining my little one's need for discussing her markers)

Our hostess went and placed us right next to the waterfall, as my daughter kept talking about the waterfall behind the bar too, so we were very happy all around for seating.

Then came the onslaught of attention - really - i mean talk about being pampered little pooches - you name it, there it was! (I have been to some top rated restaurants (names will remain anonymous - not into bashing anyone here), and the service rendered tonight seems to just put some of those other restaurants to shame!!!!) A gal could get used to this kind of pampering for EVERYTHING! Back to the subject - the service. Let's put it this way - short of having a personal massage at the table to throw me into utter 9th heaven, I was well on my way heading there!

For those who have never dined here: you are assigned a table 'captain', whose sole job is to make sure your service is being met for all needs. He will explain to you how things work for the food. You get two cardboard chips, one side says ""no meat"", the other ""more meat"". You flip the chip according to wether you want meat or not. If you don't want it - there is the 'salad bar' you can visit, to get your delight of heaven: sauteed mushrooms, grilled portabellos, shrimp ceviche, lobster bisque, varieties of risotto, salad, fine cheeses, bruschetta, beef carpaccio, and a few other items.

Seriously though, service is impeccable. You drain your water cup, it is refilled before you know it (and sometimes without you even realizing it). Drop a napkin, a new one magically appears before you. If you even have a slightest bit of a question on your face, suddenly there is your 'captain' ready to assist you. These guys (and gals) are good! You finish your appetizer, they are ready to help clear your table to bring on your entree. 

If you wish to feast on the meat side - well then just flip your chip to ""more meat""! Then comes the never ending (unless you flip your chip) selection of meats! Prime Rib, Turkey, Sausage, Chicken, Lamb, Tri Tip, Sirloin. Here's a great part - you are given at your table setting a pair of tongs (originally thought it was for picking your own bread out of the basket, but nope was wrong), to help grasp the meat they are slicing for you off the oversized kabob sticks! (sorry best way to describe them). The meat is all roasted on large skewers in open flame, which is then brought from table to table, and you are served table side. All I can say is YUUUUUMMY!!!!

Oh and let's NOT forget the sides you can order as well!:

Grilled Asparagus (hate to admit, but these guys were a little on the scrawny side, no where's close to what you would see in the grocery stores) - smeared in  olive oil mixed with garlic. Hmmm. yummy!
Fried Bananas - cinnamon, sugar, and something else all nicely fried up! I recommend this towards your dessert end.
Yucca Fries (pretty tasty! Never had it before, but I liked it!)
There was more for sure, but can't remember them all at this point. My brain is clouded with all the good eats I had!

And juuuust when you think you can't stuff anything else into your bulging tummies - the DESSERT cart winds its way to you upon request! By this point my belly is bulging, my eyes are bulging, my brain is on heavenly overload, and yes I'm getting dessert by golly (special celebrations only come once a year!)!

I dove for the chocolate cake. My daughter picked out the blueberry cheesecake. Neither of us regretted our choices! (ok hubby had no input cuz we felt 2 deserts was best, and our little one was already pining for her blueberries (thanks to Dora the Explorer).) Trust me, YUMMMMMM. Yelp is telling me I'm out of space (NEED MORE SPACE DARNIT!!!) P.S. Kids under 5 are FREE! :)",iUds9-iyxd4PFW0jMh15TA,4,1,5,hAibvIEWmGuNPqjgVrlmXA

Proceed with caution on a few of these things because it's not made the normal way you may think because they Brasil way has a twist. For example the crab cake that they offered is prepared in a way that isn't necessarily the cake form most people are use to. The Caipirinha is Brazil's national cocktail which reminds most people of the mojito! I'll tell you what, It's no drink for the lightweights! This drink offers a nice punch so be prepared if you want to indulge in a few because they WILL sneak up on you!  Happy hour has a wide variety of finer foods and also some entrees.

This is hands down my favorite restaurant in Las Vegas, as you can see that I've been going there a lot.

Now, for you all that are questioning why is that Via Brazil have so many 5 star reviews, yet there are some random people out there that will rate it one star, please read with attention the following paragraph :)

As I have stated initially, Via Brazil is a classy, sophisticated, yet affordable Brazilian steakhouse. However, some people will try to take advantage of its ""all you can eat"" system, which allows you to pay a fee ""per person"" in order to take advantage of its rodizio. In Portuguese, we say ""mas que coisa de pobre em?"" Meaning that some people will try to take advantage of the system, by buying only one rodizio, while saying that his friends will ""only be having drinks."" Really? You come to a classy steakhouse with your girlfriend and friends and subject yourself to such situation, trying to share expansive meats with everyone in your table while paying for only one person? 

I think my message is clear here, this place is amazing, their foods and service are 5 stars, but sometimes business like this will get people trying to take advantage of their system. But they are a minority, as most people that go there are classy and educated people like you and me :)

Via Brazil is the best steakhouse in Las Vegas, period. They have the best happy hour in town, awarded many times for different magazines. In addition, I write because I feel like this is the right thing to do. Don't you think that if those people writing bad reviews really cared about creating a social media rating system that is truly accurate, they would at least be truthful in their statements? This is how we build an awesome Yelp community, by rating good place and helping bad places improve by writing reviews, taking pictures and being helpful! 

I write this because I love food, and Via Brazil is my favorite restaurant in the entire world. Luckily I work hard so that I can afford to pay for it and feed my wife, friends and family at Via Brazil when I wish too.

Finally, my tip for you who are new at Via Brazil follows:

- Start by eating some ""SALGADINHOS"" followed by a traditional ""CAIPIRINHA""

- Second, eat some ""PICANHA"" and ""FRAUDINHA""

- If you like sea food, they got you covered, their salad bar has the best ""LOBSTER BISQUE"" and steamed seafood. 

- If rodizio is just too much food for you, try their happy hour deals and I can guarantee to you that you won't be disappointed.

I hope you all enjoyed reading this review and please remember that if you are looking for a great night with great people and great food, then your night starts at Via Brazil Stakehouse! Remember to make reservations on special holidays like Valentine's Day because they do get really busy! Tell them you are going there because you read my review and maybe you get a free Caipirinha!

Upon reading some of the reviews (especially the review of David R), I decided not to be quiet any longer.  A person (that none of our group knew) ordered food and drink.  After finishing her food, she left without paying her bill.  None of us knew her.  One by one, our group members individually paid for our food/drinks.  One member stayed behind to finish watching a game.  He had given the waiter $20 and was expecting change only to be surrounded by a group of people demanding money for that person that skipped out without paying.  NONE OF US KNEW THAT PERSON.  He explained that he did not know the person.  The employees of the restaurant were literally holding him there encircling him - and threatening to have him arrested.  Finally he paid (out of fear) for a meal and drinks of a person he didn't even know and has never met.  The management did not return my phone call.  Not only did he lose money for this unknown person, the waiter didn't give his change back from the $20 (should have been around $8).  The restaurant should hold credit cards if they are fearful of people not paying.  They should not make someone pay for and UNKNOWN person's food.

The meat servers are always attentive about coming to your table with the meat skewers and ready to give you as many cuts of meat as you like. The staff at the bar is fun and friendly, and the management always stops by your table to ensure you are satisfied and have been taken care of.

But when you're ""CAMPING"" a table having an endless talk either take it to the bar or somewhere outside the dining area.
    Hence our experience X-mas dinner. I've visited Via Brasil plenty of times busy and slow to see the wonderful intelligent hostesses that worked that night do their magic (holiday and non-holiday);NOTE: these host specifically DO NOT GET POOLED TIPS manager Anna shared with me in the past, which still amazes me the loyalty these lady's have to the position. When overhearing them inform every guest ""we're waiting for tables to clear up..."" was NO JOKE. I traveled the dining rooms and viewed many tables Couched in their seats with No plates, No spec of food or drink and a checkbook pushed aside of their table acting as if there's no one else that's going to use their table after.
   When finally sat to our table with no rush from the hostess despite the commotion , we were greeted by our Server seconds later.  For the hardworking loyal staff of Via Brasil on delivery great service and accommodating our picky needs. And for the strong hostesses, sad I am to witness their spirits crushed by ungodly rude uncourteous people who refuse to understand/see the hardships of working in the rest. Hospitality field especially on holidays! Where's your Christmas spirit or human kindness?
 For the management/owners who rather than bending employees, stepped in to assist their team. ThAts where they were rather than wasting their time hearing your complaints of a problem that they are hands on solving. Shake it off and keep up the great work Via Brasil.

To those reading these rough reviews from people who expect their but to be kissed. Spare your judgement on regular days and stop by yourself. Experience REAL hospitality and customer service the way it should. Holidays are never easy. VBS isnt the only one with low reviews on a holiday.

Their salad bar was small, and didn't have much varieties like Texas de Brasil. This place has nice decor and pretty upscale.

MEAT EXPLOSION!

Yes, the meat here is excellent.  My favorites here are:
-Flank Steak
-Skirt Steak
-Bacon Wrapped Tenderloin
-Beef Ribs
-Prime Rib

There are lots more but those are my top favorite ones.

Do not be afraid to tell them what you like when you sit down.  The service is exceptional and they cater to your needs immediately and professionally.  I let them know right off the bat that I am there for the Flank and Skirt Steak.

The Salad bar is good, I love their roasted peppers, rice/black beans and ravioli. The standard side dishes for the ""rodizio"" are: Brocolli, GARLIC KNOTS (YUM), Fried Bananas, Mashed Potatoes and good ""sauces"" to put on the plethora of meat you will be consuming in MASS QUANTITIES.

I spent enough for another person to come join us for dinner!. The proce was not the issue, the fact this eatablishment charges for refills shows me they are more jnterested in padding thier pockets and just being greedy.

A few seconds later I was greeted by another staff member who explained how things worked. She didn't leave me the little red/green card however.  Finally after getting a replacement card, I turned it green. Within seconds, food started getting delivered to my table.

The rest of the staff was attentive to my needs by refilling drinks, getting replacement silverware, etc.

I was not impressed with the salad bar. The meat on the other hand was delicious!  

 It's unclear as to what the lunch pricing is. I was told $25. Then I was told $19.99. Then was told the price is going back to $25.  There should be some consistent pricing.  I was also charged $4.50 for a Coke. That's higher than what other places charge-even though you are offered free refills.

Anna Gomes, the Event Manager, is truly a dream to work with. Weddings are hard anyway, and it was even more complicated that I was planning from Chicago. But Anna was always very prompt and patient in responding to my barrage of emails. 

When I was heading to Vegas for my bachelorette party a few months before my wedding, she made time to personally meet with me and give me a tour of the restaurant. I took a huge leap of faith and booked this place without seeing it. From the pictures on Yelp and Facebook, I was pretty sure I knew what I was getting myself into, but there was always a nagging fear in the back of my mind that I had fallen for good advertising. Especially because the price was so cheap, I was worried that the restaurant would be cheap looking. Well, when I finally saw the venue, I was BLOWN AWAY by how beautiful it was. The pictures absolutely do no do it justice. The place is very elegant inside. I especially love the giant waterfall! 

The day of, everything was set up exactly how I had requested it, down to the color of the lights. Anything I asked for was immediately put into place. For example, I asked the guestbook table to be moved three different times (small bridezilla moment, I guess) and it was done immediately and without complaint each time. During the meal, my father mentioned to Anna that my sisters hadn't gotten the chance to try to filet mignon yet, so Anna personally went to the kitchen to find the servers with the filet mignon and led them to my sisters' table. Amazing! 

The food was incredible. My husband spent a couple years in Brazil and is very particular about Brazilian barbecue, and he was blown away by the quality of the meat and flavor. We all were! It was such a great dinner. The servers were constantly making their rounds, everyone ate until they were very satisfied. Dessert was delicious too! 

This is the perfect atmosphere for a wedding, people still can't stop telling me what a fun wedding it was! And the price was absolutely unbeatable. You only pay for food, there is no additional cost for reserving the rooms. Based on that, you would think they would try to hurry you along or squeeze you into a smaller space so there would be more room for restaurant guests, but that was absolutely not the case. The number of guests I had could have fit into the large party room, but Anna was worried it would be a tight fit, so she also gave us the adjoining space, for no additional cost! I truly felt like her main goal was to make sure I had a wonderful time. Take it from a bride on a budget, there is no better deal for a wedding. My husband said we can go back to celebrate our anniversary in Vegas and we'll definitely have our celebration anniversary dinner here.

As for the meats, I was lucky enough to sit near the kitchen and had first cuts right off the skewers!  I kept going back for garlic steak, prime rib and the house special.

They give each person there own round paper disc that you turn to green when you are ready for more meat and then you turn it to red until you are ready for more or are simply done eating. I was impressed by the fact that the side dishes were included with the meal. They had like 16 to choose from and you can pick as many as you like. That is a nice touch! They ask that you tell them your sides when you first get there so they can start preparing them. 

So I am not a vegetarian at all, but I don't eat a whole lot of meat. Tonight was my night to shine as the carnivore I am not. I absolutely succeeded! I first went to the salad bar. I wasn't impressed. There were a lot a seafood options which is great, but not for someone like me who doesn't eat seafood. I didn't feel there was a lot of options for a salad however the veggies they did offer were fresh and delicious. I put some ""Caprese Salad"" on my plate and that was actually very good. As we finished up our salad, the sides we ordered arrived. The ""White Rice"" paired nicely with the ""Sauteed Mushrooms"" and the ""Fried Banana"" was good. Then the meats started coming! I have to admit that the ""Top Sirloin"" known as ""Pichana"" that they claim is the star of the meal was not good at all. The meat was tough and flavorless. The ""NY Strip"", and ""Prime Rib"" were the same, tough meat and flavorless. Then came the ""Bacon Wrapped Turkey"" and THAT is delicious. I'm a huge fan of bacon and the bacon really added a nice flavor to the turkey. Then came the ""Garlic Filet and ""Bacon Wrapped Filet and these two are the star of the meal to me. The filet was so tender and flavorful. I like my meat cooked well done so the server took note of that and made sure to bring me pieces with no pink. I liked my meal, but can't see coming back and paying full price again. Maybe if it were a deal they had going on or something. The meat at first was not good, and the salad bar was not great. I know this isn't TDB, but I do have to compare it because they both have the ""churrascaria"" thing going on. And the salad bar at TDB is worth just eating that alone. The sides were decent, but I only enjoyed a few types of the meat so I'd rather spend the extra to have TDB. 

There is a Happy Hour here at Via Brasil Monday - Sunday from 5-8 pm in the patio/bar. Every Sunday they have a ""Sunday Brunch"" from 10 am - 2 pm and have different specials for the brunch so you might want to call and ask if there is a theme for that day. They have several options for events and banquets too.",Fv0e9RIV9jw5TX3ctA1WbA,35,28,3,SbcIDB9R_mL-yFwG56AcjA

The salad bar is fairly small, but all of the items on offer were fresh and tasty. Unlimited sides were a nice touch, although they were out of yucca fries by 6pm, so we didn't get any :-(.

We paid for the upgrade so that we could sample all of the meat. I think we only counted 7 or 8 different meats, and the shrimp and ribs only came out once, so not sure if it is worth the upcharge or not.

My only complaint is that they had a wedding reception going on when we were there, and the music was extremely loud. Loud enough that it fought with the dining room music, and sort of put a damper on our ability to have conversation. 

Despite the minor inconvenience, we will be back.",Clj5WdwsjRRBvN5byPvdlA,2,0,4,Vm-DqsTWKbCe5MsGti-X-g
3532911,2014-07-21,1,gO_z_5FQVHLCiJjOsfE1fg,"Our initial trip to this highly rated (Zagat) Churrascaria did not begin well when the greeter did not seat us immediately or even after 10 minutes despite the fact that we had a reservation.  Three parties who arrived after us were seated ahead of us. Explanation given was that they wanted to clear a nice table for us....hmmm.  A comped desert from the manager soothed our feelings however. 

These style of Brazilian steakhouses which have sprung up around the country in recent years charge about $40 -$50 for an endless serving of 20 or 30 different types of grilled beef, lamb, chicken and fish. You basically strap on your feed bag and let 'er rip.  Quality of the meat in these establishments is hit or miss and quantity comes before quality here.  Lots of sides are included.  The meal is actually pretty good if you contain yourself and select the different cuts of meat wisely. At Via Brazil, we liked the filet mignon wrapped in bacon, the NY strip, the chicken drumsticks, the beef ribs, the flank steak, and grilled asparagus.  Suggest you avoid the garlic steak and tri tip -- tough and chewy during our visit. Some of the meats were over seasoned -- too salty -- and the cooks need to have slightly gentler hands on their salt shakers. 

A salad bar is included and I would say it was average at best and inferior to what we have experienced at Fogo de Chao and Texas de Brazil, two competitor chains. The selection of cold and hot salads was not as varied and numerous as we have seen elsewhere. The selections they did have were tasty and fresh however. 

Our party of three ordered the Sterling meal and the Prime meal plus an ala carte salad and fish entree.  The Sterling meal costs an extra 10 dollars and there are premium meat selections (lamb chops, shrimp, NY strip) that come with it. In my opinion, worth it. 

A pretty good meal and pretty good table service and I recommend Via Brazil without reservation.  Decent value for a good meal, not perfect but a nice restaurant nonetheless.",9VUBm41ZyGrLo4seD7Iqgg,1,1,4,2vtV4KcgKLzZEJG6DeOmCQ

I got a coupon from Groupon so I took my son for two of their all you can eat dinners. I'm sure they have more dining options but I can't speak to them. The decor is classy but not stuffy. Overall I'd say its comfortable with a touch of elegance.

We were seated, given a quick once over on the way to dine (the stop/go button), the salad bar, the free sides, etc. From there we grabbed plates and dove into the salad bar. 

This isn't the usual buffet salad bar, not by a long shot. The quality of everything there stood out. I highly recommend loading up a separate plate with their grilled portobello mushrooms. These go so well with the meats to come that you'll want to have a plate there as a side.

Back at the table, the meat on a skweres started to arrive. They had salmon, beef ribs, top sirloin, skirt steak, lamb and I'm sure I'm missing one other. Different parts of each skewer were cooked to different temperatures so if you preferred medium rare and someone else at the table likes medium well, they can accomodate this without a problem. 

All of the meats were excellend but for me the best by far is the skirt steak. Be sure to save room feel free to request it, they go out of their way to be accomodating.

The only minor criticism is that my son felt the meats were a bit on the salty side. I didn't notice this but he's always been more sensitive than I to salt. 

Overall, highly recommended. At $45 it may be a bit pricy but if your a dedicated carnivor with a good appetite, you'll be glad you went.",bCglPCiltb6206DVttvvBw,0,0,4,7I5OtNAQqySPJdggL-jSrA

Here's my honest opinion:

The salad bar: 4.5 stars
The sides (bread/plantains/mashed potatoes): 4 stars
The beef/meat: 3.5 stars

I was left a bit disappointed with the meat.  Most of the meats too tough for my liking. 

Add that with the slow service -- I was left waiting for more options with a green card flipped over.  As a result of the waiting, me and my friends ended up eating the sides (and bread) and filled ourselves up.  

I was used to a Brazilian BBQ  like Fogo de Chao, where you get plenty of people serving you meat almost immediately when you flip your card over to green.

3747182,2013-04-16,0,gO_z_5FQVHLCiJjOsfE1fg,"pros...great place to actually celebrate thanksgiving in Las Vegas.  this was where me and 14 of my closest friends and family decided to spend thanksgiving dinner at.  and it was just great.  the place was not crowded, at least the time we were there.  and it is a pretty typical brazilian style meat house.  they advertise like 40 different cuts of meat to be had, but i only counted like 20 or something. great service and fun waiters that come around.  also a dessert cart as well.

if you have never been to one, then it is just a great way to try out this style of dining.  these are all you can eat affairs, and it would be best if you are not in a hurry.  as the time it will take you to actually digest your food will be days.  so once you sit this place has individual little cards, which allow the waiters to come around with different swords of meat.  so say the meat sword, yeah i know it sounds funny, but that's what it is.  so it comes around and the guy will ask you if you want that particular cut of meat, and if yes he places it onto your plate.  if not, no harm or foul.  then you eat, and then you wait for the next type of food on the sword.  and this happens over and over and over and over again.  

but in the case of my table, you are greatly pressured to eat whatever is being offered.  and along with that, there is the other matter of the caiperenas, which is like the brazilian equivalent of a mojito, with just a different type of alcohol.  and boy we are a rowdy bunch as we will try to bully you into eating a lot of food.  needless to say 3.5 hours later and a massive bill later, we were out of there.  and it was a great thanksgiving, beats anything that can happen at home.  just cause that would be a lot of meat to cook.  but i must say my favorite dish of the night was not a meat dish, but actually the grilled corn.  it was sweet and delicious like no other corn i have tasted.  

cons...not easy to find this place and it is a bit far from the strip.  but once you find it you will have a great time.  prices are high, but then it was an all you can eat and thanksgiving as well.  so come prepared by not eating all day and the day before as well, just to get your moneys worth.  dessert was a bit of a let down, but i guess by the time we were done, there wasn't much room left in the stomach for it.  and be wary of our table, as we tend to get loud and rowdy.  and make sure that my wife is not inebriated, as she has a vicious potty mouth that is loud and obnoxious as well.",f7pbQuon-3GbyNbzcNSQdQ,1,0,4,-PXXJDoQuAzX8qjasTrEXA

Worst mistake! 
Not only did they overbook & fell way behind, long over an hour in seating, but the Lead Hostess played favoritism in seating some customers that had reservations 15mins later than us until the hard working (clearing tables) Manager approached her & asked why ""John wasn't seated yet, you have to seat him now"".
He should have switched places with her and made her clear & wipe tables!

Finally got seated over an hour an half late & then noticed there were numerous empty tables? 
What????

The advertisement made it seem like there would be a good selection of breakfast items at salad bar, omelet  station Etc.
No one was manning Omelete station.
Only one pan & burner sat there unlit until sometime later. No waffles till later, no pancakes. No pastries to speak of.
No sausage, only scrambled eggs & bacon.

Before making my reservations I was told of these various stations & that the Omelete station would prepare eggs to your liking, like over easy Etc.
Big disappointment!

The meat items were good as expected but that was the lunch part.

Near the end of our meal our waiter brought small side dish of plantains & mashed potatoes for 4 of us.
We were told the increased price of $37 would include a good selection of Desserts? 

Really Sad selection.
The increased priced also Did Not include any drinks!

If you want a real brunch and expect breakfast items, I would not go to Via Brazil.

If you don't care to eat a lot of meat but want a decent balance of breakfast & lunch items this is not the place to go for Brunch.
Not even for the regular price of $20.

I still tipped 20% & now, not sure why other than to help the innocent workers.
 
I would never go to another brunch here again, anytime, nor dinner on a holiday unless I see a big change in brunch menu & service along with less overbooking reservations.",7ks5gnxM_o4XEJK4j6QnoQ,0,0,2,lmvPcAqKyxP9ZGfbZZdbIA

Food is not great, I was really excited for the lobster bisque on the salad bar but it had no flavor, needed seasoning. The beef carpaccio was good and the goat cheese jalapeños were nice. They had some nice cheeses but the salad bar was generally underwhelming. 
We ordered the Sterling option which had 21 different meats and I don't even think we tried 15 of them. The leg of lamb had mint in it which was gross, lamb chops were dry, the other meats we did try were just ok, not overwhelmingly delicious to anything. 

Our server Gerardo was more focused on socializing and finishing up his closing duties. We waited what seemed like forever for different meats, we kept getting the same selections over and over, our sides took forever and when we ordered sauces for our meats they took a while and one of them came out in a styrofoam container.. really??? They couldn't find one clean ramekin to bring us our sauce in? That's ridiculous..and our server kept going over to another table and just chatting, i believe he knew then because the manager was over there for quite some time , and other food runners kept having to ask him what we needed.. I don't understand why he couldn't just get us what we needed..

I usually skimp over the salad bar, but the appetizers were really good. The spread had the perfect mix of charcuterie, salad, and vegetables. I enjoyed the crab ceviche, beef carpaccio, and the various assorted grilled items. But, in all seriousness, I was here for the meat, not the salad bar. 

Via Brasil jumps to the top of my list for one of the best Brazilian steakhouses for their meats. I loved that the skin of the chicken drumsticks were perfectly crispy. All of the beef (top sirloin, tri-tip) was perfectly medium-rare. One of my biggest gripes about Brazilian barbecue is how salty all their roasts are, but I found all the meats to be well-seasoned without being over-seasoned, especially the crusts. The flavors were amazing. Also, baked cheese? Love it! The cheese paired wonderfully with the meats. 

What didn't I like? The rotation of meats didn't come frequently enough and at one point we were at a standstill. There were no ribs, lamb, or fish offered that evening. The other disappointment was the cheesecake for dessert. They actually ran out and I got one of the last slices, but it was far from what they labeled ""NY cheesecake."" It was heavy and generic. I should've gone for the Brazilian doughnuts with ice cream. 

I'll end with a positive note. The tableside basket of cheese-baked bread balls were simply amazing. Single-most addictive item on the menu.",fgkJ6KUlrmbKyLDQervxsw,6,1,4,JaIGarlMBbss2-1vtU89Vw

Of course, we had to go rodizio-style, and I wanted to at least experience the dinner offerings.  So, we ended up getting a 2:15pm reservation for this place.  DEFINITELY worth the wait, since we got to choose from the full 16 types of meat (instead of 6).  Yes, the price was $36/person, but it was worth every penny.

Even though they gave us some broccoli, fried bananas, mashed potatoes, and cheese bread, I barely ate any of thee carbs, since I had to save room for the MEAT.

I did make sure to save room for the salad bar, since it included salmon with a passion fruit sauce, salad, peppers, portobello mushrooms, marinated mushrooms, caprese salad, meats/cheeses, beef carpaccio, chicken salad, seafood salad, etc.  I ate just a few small selections from the salad bar, since I was all about the meat.

OMG.  I was in heaven.  I tried anything and everything that was steak.  The Picahna (Top Sirloin) and Garlic Picahna were to die for.  So juicy and delicious.  They even had a different type of garlic steak, which was also good.  I also tried the Prime Rib, Lamb, and Flank Steak, but I mostly filled up on the Picahna and Garlic Picahna.  I'll admit, though, that the Flank Steak and Prime Rib were delicious, but my only objective was to eat Picahna. 

They also had garlic bread that was almost immediately snatched up after the server came out from the kitchen.  It tasted like it was garlic sourdough bread.  Whatever it was, delicious.

I didn't really want to bother eating the Pineapple and Ham, Ribs, Pork, Chicken, or Sausage, so I really can't comment on those.  By the time that the Salmon was brought out, I was just too stuffed.  Next time.  

I also saved some room for dessert, since I saw a couple of ladies pushing around a dessert cart (even though it was a little extra, it was worth it).  It was all over for me once I saw that they had tiramisu (among other things)...I just felt like they were taunting me with their dessert selection, since it seemed that they were pushing the cart around in front of me while I was enjoying my meat.  I did, however, have the tiramisu, and it was worth the wait/saved space.

The wait staff was great, although we did quite a bit of waiting before they refilled my water and before they brought out the check.  They did come by quite a few times to ask if we wanted more wine, though.  

I'll admit that when they came around, the staff was quite attentive.

We also received a $20 gift card to be used toward dinner.  

I would've probably given them 5 stars, except for the few gripes that I had about the service.

I can't wait to come back.",QiDtS54JwTGeH81c-a84WQ,0,0,4,ZMv3guUCZg-cKqhds6oenQ
3966744,2011-05-11,0,gO_z_5FQVHLCiJjOsfE1fg,"Wow!  What a great meal! The waiter comes to your table with a bread basket with several doughnut hole shaped buns.  They are Brazilian cheese buns dusted with parmesan cheese.  There were excellent!

I started with the salad bar and took items sparingly.  I tried the cold, sliced portabello muchrooms, one tomato caprese, asparagus risotto, two small artichoke heart halves, and two large shrimps and a piece of fish from their hot seafood mixture.  This was the extent of my salad bar foray as I didn't want to fill up on salad.  It would be a great dinner in itself.

I turned the coaster to the green side meaning bring on the meat.  Before they started that, a waiter brought three dishes to the table - one with 3 fried plantains, another with mashed potatoes, and a third with green beans with garlic.  These were my vegetables to go with my meat.  A lot of food to accompany a lot of food.

I didn't try all the meats as I was filling up before they had a chance to bring everything to my table.  I liked the small sausage, the first meat I tasted and it was excellent.  Beautiful seasoning.  Then I had two thin slices of rare prime rib which was excellent also.  I had both the chicken breast wrapped in bacon and the tenderloin wrapped in bacon.  Both were very good.  The seasonings were perfect.  I am a salt user extraordinaire, but I salted nothing except the mashed potatoes and green beans.  I had the garlic picanha (top sirloin) and it was superb!!  I also had one slice of beef rib which is sliced from a rack of rib (large--not baby back) and served on a separate small plate. 

Since there were only two tables occupied in the restaurant, there weren't several guys walking around distributing meat like rodizio restaurants.  Two guys were tasked with the serving.  I didn't get the pork loin and I forgot Tony's mentioning of chicken hearts--damn, damn, damn.  Well, something to look forward to next time.

After all this, I did hold back so I could try some dessert.  I had a slice of peanut butter, chocolate chip cheesecake.  Oh yeah--great!

Service was impecable.  My iced tea was refilled often, staff was always around to answer questions or see if you needed something.  I was greeted at the door by a delightful young lady and she also bid me a kind, smiling farewell!

The place is very nicely done.  I love the wine rack that goes almost to the ceiling.  I could see the super ladder inside to extend and reach the highest shelves.

This is a great deal with a Groupon.  The Groupon was $21.  The regular price for the rodizio is $42.95.  I'm not sure I'd be back for the full price, but the Groupon certainly makes it a great deal.  Come on Groupon--let's get anohter Via Brasil.  And you know, I'll probably go back and pay the full price if one of my friends from out of town who loves rodizio comes to Las Vegas.  We'll go together!",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,8,5,5,FsNjCGkneX1KmqJdOdgPbw

The quality of meat was just OK, and the taste was not too flavorful as I would have imagined it to be. 

The service though was good.  They were courteous, and quick to serve the meat.  But, it took an hour and a half before any salmon came out.  The skirt steak was too thick, and I like it better a little crispy on the outside.  The ribs were good, but the top sirloin was kind of flavor-less.  The bacon wrapped turkey and bacon wrapped tenderloin was good of course because anything wrapped in bacon is good. LOL.

I had to use the typical A1 steak house with a little bit of tabasco to add some flavor and spice.  The salad bar was just OK too.  I enjoyed the portobello mushrooms, and seafood.  But other than that, the salad bar was just OK.  

Overall experiences was just OK.  Fancy place, romantic atmosphere, great two person band, but the food did not impress me much.  

The cappacino and tiramisu helped to replace the flavorless-ness of the food.

The guys serving up the meat actually ask if there is any specific meat you want to try and brings it out as soon as it's ready, straight to your table! Ask for the chicken hearts - it was great! Since it's less crowded, the meat comes around a lot quicker (I went for dinner on a Friday). Lobster Bisque from the salad bar was delicious with actual bits of lobster. My cup of ice tea and water never went empty. Lots of hot food options included if too much meat makes you sick.

Came here on a Tuesday evening and met with my buddy.  I was dressed down because I eat better when I feel more relaxed.  I made it a point to eat everything on the menu and I told our host/server that.  Certain items on the menu have to be requested.  The salmon and passion fruit sauce was so good.  I enjoyed every piece of yummy protein and they still have the best salad bar evaarrrr.  I really enjoyed the prime rib also w/a side of horseradish.  The cheeseball bread cleared my taste buds/pallets each time.  

After that, we saved room for dessert and they brought the cart around.  I got a passion fruit mousse and my friend got creme brulee.  After paying for the meal and leaving a $30 tip we stayed and caught up a lil bit longer.  I saw the salmon cart go around and had to get another piece.  =]

The lamb was juicy tender and cooked to medium rare just how I like it thinking about that that is how all the meat is perfect in my mind much more flavorful than texas de brazil.  The only drawback about via Brasilia is the salad bar it is pretty small and just not as much stuff as I expected.

4014333,2012-03-22,2,gO_z_5FQVHLCiJjOsfE1fg,"Holy crap, I hit 100 reviews on my last review and didn't even notice??  And I did my 100th reveiw on some sub-par establishment?  Shame on me!  To make up for it, my 101st review is on someplace stellar!

Via Brasil is on point!  Really a very good place to have a protein-filled dinner!  Calories?  Who cares!  With over 14 types of meat to choose from and a stocked salad bar with over 30 hot and cold items to choose from, you're gonna wanna get a taste of everything Via Brasil has to offer!

We started our meal with their warm Brazilian cheese buns which were gooey and tasty.  Our server also showed us that with each meal besides the all-you-can-eat salad bar and the meat, we also had unlimited choices of any of their side dishes that came from the kitchen.  I can't remember the entire sides menu but we ordered:

-Sweet potato fries
-Collard greens
-Fried bananas 

We placed our sides order in before we were escorted to the salad bar.  This was another treat.  It seems Via Brasil is on par with Texas de Brazil on salad bar selections, and there was many high quality items to choose from:

-Caesar salad 
-Grilled peppers
-Marinated portobello mushrooms
-Hearts of Palm
-Caprese salad (pretty good, creamy)
-Seafood salad
-Fine cheeses

Along with the salad bar are six hot dishes that are offered, on this day we tried:

-Mushroom risotto
-Fish in lemon butter sauce
-Rice & beans

All the salad bar items we sampled were fresh and pretty good.  I love a good salad with marinated fresh grilled veggies, brings on a sense of balance before you attack the meat like a t-rex!  Via Brasil's beans were super good, I loved the smoky flavor with the addition of the hamhock in the mix.  I had two bowls!  The only thing I missed from Via Brasil's salad bar versus Texas de Brazil's (and I should be ashamed in saying this) is that at Texas they have California Roll sushi on the line.  'Faux-shi'...for shame!  I dunno, I guess I just like having the option of eating it if I want to!

Shortly after we got our salads our side dishes arrived.  I enjoyed the tart of the collard greens, and both the sweet potato fries and fried bananas were good.  We finally flipped our little marker to green and off we were to the meat races!  We sampled just about everything on Via Brasil's menu that night:

-Garlic picanha
-Sausage
-Flank steak
-Tenderloin wrapped in Bacon
-Beef Ribs
-Prime Rib
-Leg of Lamb
-Salmon
-Chicken drumsticks
-Chicken hearts

Just about everything was excellent!  I noticed that Via Brasil uses a bit less salt than the folks at Texas which made the flavor of their meats a bit more appealing to my palette.  I loved the garlic picanha and their flank steak, juicy and tender.  The prime rib was great, just be sure to ask for a thicker cut!  The beef ribs were very good with their house BBQ sauce, I was eating part of a slab like Fred Flintstone!  The leg of lamb was not 'lamby' at all.  I had a small issue with the salmon, it was on the dry side.  But the surprise of the night was the chicken hearts, man were those good!  Reminds you of a Japanese izakaya because of that grilled flavor.  We almost ate an entire stake of these ourselves!  I am no stranger to exotic food!  Give it a shot and try it...you just might like it!

And don't forget to ask your server to bring their chimichurri sauce for your table!  It's a must for your meat!  The mix of olive oil, garlic, lemon, parsley and other herbs gives your meat that punch of flavor which will ignite your taste buds.  Super good!  

Via Brasil also does offer various dessert choices but after the meat attack we went through we were too full to order anything, I'm thinking maybe next time?  And yes, there will probably be a next time.

Service was very good here, our server was attentive, kept our glasses full, and answered any questions we had about the salad bar or the types of meat they served.  And don't forget to join Via Brasil's e-club!  You receive news on special events and promotions, as well as possible BOGO coupons on your birthday or anniversary!  Always a plus in my book to save that dough!

I missed the old Makino that used to be in this space, but Via Brasil has done a great job taking over.  We left happy with joyous memories, and our bellies full of food.  Food that alas, will force me to work twice as hard in the gym to burn these meaty calories off.  Uh...I work out!!",QCtHk02W_Asu2LFfdmGQDA,4,1,5,e2HFhCLcJulBnk1_MiDo_Q

Many many many choices. Big happy hour menu. We had calamari, lobster bisque, asparagus lemon risotto, Brazilian cheese rolls, and a sampler of fried goodies including meatballs and shrimp empanadas. We also sampled red sangria, passion fruit mojito, caiphirina and wine. And topped it all off with chocolate mousse. 

$54 for 4 cocktails and loads of food with leftovers to take home. Everything was delish. The fried items were slightly indistinguishable from one another but tasty nonetheless. Calamari was cooked perfectly with two yummy dipping sauces. Bisque was salty, rich and dreamy. The cheese rolls are especially delightful soaked in the aforementioned bisque. Chocolate mousse was rich and creamy. 

We had a lovely cushioned sofa and table on the patio. The service was great. Very friendly and over attentive.

(I couldn't try it this time as I was by myself). The only ""critque""/suggestion I would have would be for their fresh squeezed juices, they are $3.99 a piece, no free refills, with this being said I believe management should look into offering an option of a carafe (if everyone is drinking same juice) for a few dollars less than the total amount of glasses served from it. (Let's say a carafe serves 3 glasses, they could charge $10 instead of $12) in addition I feel they should do a bottomless juice option where you could switch between the different juices maybe offer that up at $12.

Dear Adam Gomes, General Manager, Via Brasil Steakhouse,  Las Vegas, Nevada  8917

I have been a customer at your restaurant for many years and my wife and I, frequent your establishment at least four times a year for dinner in addition, at least that many times and enjoy your Happy Hour.
I thought I should reach out and contact you before I post my commentary on my experience at your restaurant on New Year's Eve.
I was contacted by your representative a few days before New Year's Eve and I was instructed that payment was required in advance in order to secure our 9:30 PM reservation. I was also told that a higher than normal price will be charged.  I was fine with that and agreed to pay in advance. I was told that you were serving dinner, at a lower price to other patrons that were served earlier that evening and for those that wished to attend for NYE, would be served in a party atmosphere with music, desert bar and a champagne toast.
Per the request of your representative, I arrived at your restaurant just after 9:30 PM.  I want told I had to wait for a table.  I was not pleased I had to wait to be seated even though I pre-paid for a reservation at your request. You did not accommodate me upon my arrival as expected. I was not seated until around 10:10 PM!  Your service and planning worked to collect payment in advance but you did not provide the service you demanded advance payment for!
You usual sumptuous salad buffet was lacking in some of your normal variety and, even more disappointing, was the fact that many of the dishes remained empty.
The music that was played by your DJ entertainer was not matched with the demographics and age of your clientele that was in attendance.  It was an obvious and blatant error and was further evidenced by that lack of your customers on the dance floor.  How anyone as a professional can be so far off, is beyond belief.  This should have been recognized and immediately corrected.  Nobody seemed to be in charge and more importantly, nobody seemed to care.
At this point in time, I feel like I need to find another restaurant to take my steady stream of business to.
As a courtesy, I wanted to voice my experience to you in advance of posting this on any social sites.
Hopefully you will learn from this horrible failure that evening and make changes in the future.

I wrote to Adam Gomes and his obnoxious wife, Anna, on two separate occasions in order to elicit some response.  They never responded and that only indicates that they do not care about customer relations!  I will NEVER eat here again!
I suggest you do the same!  They don't care about their customers!  There are too many other great restaurants nearby.",jk_jaNf4FEkh51mQWdGQrQ,6,1,1,Kq0r1FSOEa7YTbXwvNgXOg

I've been to almost all the Brazilian steakhouses in Las Vegas.  Via Brasil is one of my favorites. I don't eat at authentic Churrascarias too often.  That's because I never seem to get my money's worth. But if I could, I would eat at a place like this on the daily.  If you haven't been to a Churrascaria before, then you're missing out on an all-you-can-eat meat treat.  Carnivores are welcome.  

There's three options when dining here; the Sterling Dinner (21 meat options), Prime Dinner (14 meat options), or Rodizo Brunch.  The salad bar also includes soups, cheese, bread, and pastas.  The salad bar is part of the meal, but don't recommend spending your calories here.  Save yourself for the meat.  Servers will be by every couple of minutes with different types of meat as long as you have the puck with the green side up.  I tend to have a strategy when I dine at places like this. I will usually get a very small sample of each meat.  Once I find my favorite, it's on like Donkey Kong.  I will go after my favorites and at Via Brasil, those favorites include the garlic steak, tri-tip, tangy chicken, turkey, and sausage.  The restaurant will also prepare the meat the way you like it.  I didn't have any complaints with the meats that I had. Everything that I had was good.  As for the service, it's close to ""as good as it gets"".  Overall, I recommend Via Brasil.

The food was amazing and the service was outstanding. The servers come around consistently with different meats on a stick and accouterments and my plate was never empty. Who likes meat on a stick? This girl.

The only complaint I have is that they garnish everything at the salad bar with green onions. Every single dish, including the lobster bisque, is sprinkled with nasty green onions. Not everyone cares for the taste of raw onions, so maybe just put them on the side for people who want them? Garnishing dishes with green onions is lazy and unimaginative. Just sayin'.",wFL2RrJvTsOVRU6gnRd2WQ,1,2,4,vedtVPYEzbbVvF8xu-u5Zg

It's Valentine's day...I get that but if you take a reservation and call it a reservation, you should be in a position of managing your restaurant in such a way that your customers' tables are ready and available for them at the reserved time.  Especially if that time is a 9 pm reservation because according to Open Table at the time the ""reservation"" was made, it was the earliest time available for a party of 2. AND especially since Via Brasil called me to confirm the reservation yesterday afternoon. 

Upon arriving (15 min early, I might add) we discovered several other seemingly disgruntled couples standing outside of the restaurant. We walked in to check in for our 9 pm ""reservation"" and were told that ""unfortunately"" they were running behind and were only just seating people with 8 pm reservations meaning that our 9 pm reservation would actually be sat closer to 10 pm. 

So, the reservation wasn't really a reservation...it was call ahead seating booked through Open Table? For Valentine's dinner?  Riiiight. 

So, thank you Via Brasil...you actually did us a huge favor. Rather than waiting until nearly 10 pm to eat in your obnoxiously loud and crowded restaurant, we went across the street to Honey Salt and were sat right away.  We had an amazing meal for probably half the cost of what we would have paid at your restaurant. Funny thing about Honey Salt...they recognized the couples eat out at a nice restaurant for Valentine's Day and actually brought in extra tables to accommodate more patrons...GENIUS! Bonus points...they handed out roses to the ladies. Honey Salt is our new fave joint near our house.

Crabcake- 2 Stars. It was not the traditional flavors so I was thrown off. 

Beef slider- 5 Stars. I mean, I'm gonna go back and just order three of these and stuff my face because it was THAT AMAZING.

This place is amazing, classy and very good food wise. My husband is half Brazilian and so we had a great experience there. Our waiter a very nice young man and kept checking on us. The serving was great, I had the feeling because 90% of our group was Brazilian we had the sort of ""special service"". But even when our cards displayed 'no meat' they still came around. The waiters were nice, and me not having been to a Brazilian Steakhouse before, when I asked what the meat was, they explained. We had a lot of talk with the waiter, because part of our group also came from Holland, and he talked with us and it was all a good time. 
I had two glasses of Chardonnay and it was a very good white wine, very soft and fruity. 
The meat was amazing, I recommend you try the chicken hearts when you dine there, they are pure heaven. They have a lot of good stuff there, my advice is just try it out! At the salad bar I had gotten some cheese, and what I thought was meat, but it turned out the be cheese as well. It looked a bit red/purple-ish.

Pretty much everything here is good. My favs were the turkey wrapped in bacon and the filet wrapped in bacon. There's 16 different things that they bring around. I got to try 14 out of the 16. Didn't get a chance to taste the chicken breast and the salmon. But trust me, our stomachs weren't missing the last 2 items. It was pretty much at max capacity about 15 minutes BEFORE we stopped eating!

You also have access to a salad bar that includes items with shrimp and lobster bisque. The lobster bisque was a bit watery to my liking, but I can't complain since it's free! At the beginning of your meal, you also get bread cheese balls (YUM!) and brocolli and mashed potatoes. I would recommend eating only 1 cheeseball and skipping the veggies. You will thank me for it later when your stomach is maxed out and you've only tried 10 of the 16 meats :)

Did I mention that they have IMPECABBLE service? Everyone from the sommelier, the water boy, the waiters, and the roving meat holders were incredibly attentive and accomodating. And it's not like we were high rollers either. We were your regular run of the mill folks. But they treated us just like we were VIPs.

FOOD: 
Caipirinha's (Kiwi and Strawberry) $5 each - their kiwi flavored sugar can liquor is so good!  The Caipirinha is Brazil's famous drink and I love it!! Its sweet and super strong.  I really liked the two separate flavors and it didn't hide the kick that you get lol My only problem I had with the Strawberry was that I would have loved if they strained the strawberry bits out.  Its kind of hard to drink when every two seconds I have to clear the straw.  

Chicken Tenders $5 - The chicken tenders are tender and moist ^_^ they make good tenders lol And they come with a side of Yucca Fries which I love.  I am a great lover of french fries and every time I have Yucca fries, I wonder how come other restaurants cant make them too!

Brazilian Fish and Chips $4.50 - The fish was extremely moist and flakes really easily which is a good thing.  My only issue with this is that it has a fishy taste to it which makes me wonder how fresh it is. 

Brushetta $3.50 - You get four piece of brushetta topped with feta, tomato, and top with lemon dressing.  Its pretty good and the size of each brushetta is pretty large when most restaurant serve you something pretty small.  The only thing that could make this really good was that they need to toast the bread.  I love bread, I love bread that i just eat straight up with their crunch exterior and super soft chew interior... their brushetta was that but its not very stable when you're trying to lift it up to take a big bite when the lemon dressing is soaking through.  

Sausage & Yucca $5 - Yucca fries are the bomb! When we place this order, i thought were were going to get these chubby little sausages (no idea why i thought that lol) but what we got instead small little sausage slices (about size of nickels) that were sauteed crispy.  The flavor was good but was surprise that the form they came in.  Whats really good is if you take the slice sausages from this place and put them on the brushetta lol


SERVICE:
The staff are very attentive ^_^ Since there wasnt any cocktail tables or bar stool open, they had set up two of their patio table behind the bar (small corner hidden behind the waterfall bar).  I think because we sat in this corner, we got better service lol cause the waitresses had to always remember to stop by. 

Anna, one of the owners and event planner, walks the restaurant and the bar area and checks on the guests as well.  She is actually the reason why my fiance and I booked our wedding dinner at their restaurant.  

The table next to us (the only other patio one in our little corner lol) had 3 guests that got their food quite quick but was missing their Caesars Chicken Salad (which looked pretty good and the size was large which I must remember to try next time).  The waitress apologized for the delay as there was a mix up in the kitchen and brought the salad ASAP.  Anna came by and offered them complimentary dessert for their delay on their one order.  I thought that was pretty nice since the guests didnt really seem to mind and that Anna was so quick to hear about it.

Via Brasil has amazing service and warm hospitality.  I have always felt that the energy is very frenzied at Texas de Brazil--they are always very crowded and interested in turning over tables. 

Via Brasil never stopped trying to feed us and constantly made sure our experience was positive.  They pay attention to fine details.  For example, they periodically bring you a clean plate to start over with when you have meat scraps littering your plate.  

The meat quality is excellent and the servers always tell you that if you aren't ready for a meat they have, they will be sure to bring it back around later.  Additionally, one person at my table wanted one last piece of filet at the end, and they fired up a fresh skewer of them, just for him.

We went without a reservation, which was refreshing.

Then of course there are all the meats that they come around with carving table side and everything is all you can eat. BONUS you can also add on unlimited mimosas, bellinis and blood marys for $18.99 (I think a la carte the drinks are around $8).

Our party was somewhat staggered, with some joining later than others and I believe we were there for almost 4 hours with everything said and done.

Let me begin first by saying I don't think VB is a bad place to eat. In fact, I think it's a very nice restaurant with very nice wait staff (including bussers, hostess, waiters, everyone!). On both of my visits I was pleased as punch with the service and the arrival of the meats/cheese bread/condiments/beverages. 

However, on my second visit some of the magic wore off from the first visit. I went here for a birthday dinner with my fiance. On a Saturday night I made a reservation, expecting the place to be busy, but it definitely was not. Kind of a plus for us, except for the fact they sat us out in the middle of the floor. I was kinda disappointed with the seating and hoping we could have been seated in a more secluded part of the restaurant, but it was okay...

As for food. The meats were okay, minus the salmon, which was delicious. I tend to skip the sausages and chicken-type meats when I come to a Brazilian steakhouse. I must say though, I think all of the meats were overly-salty. Cooked well? Yes. But just salty. I went through three glasses of water.

The salad bar I think is okay, but not as good as Texas de Brazil.

The restaurant is really beautiful, and there is a long, but very narrow, outdoor patio.  Of course it was too cold to be eating outside, but I wonder how this would work with the Brazilian rodizio concept.  I imagine it would be more trouble than its worth.

We really liked the salad bar, with its huge assortment of items, most of them pretty tasty, and I tried very hard not to pig out.  But with such a vast assortment, even a minuscule tasting of everything adds up to a substantial portion.

The meats, though, left a lot to be desired.  The first one served to us was the turkey (or was it chicken?) wrapped in bacon.  It was so salty that I couldn't eat it, and it wasn't just the bacon;  I took that off, but the salt permeated all through the meat.  The rest of the meats were mostly tough, oversalted, and lacking any flavor, except for the beef ribs, which were really good.

Service was difficult; it was hard to get a waiter's attention, but this could be attributed to the group set-up.  I wouldn't downgrade the restaurant because of this, since it may not be totally valid.

This wasn't the first Brazilian rodizio restaurant we've been to, so we have others to compare it to.  It's fine for the money, and we'll likely come back.  But first we'll try some of the competition in town, which seems to be growing weekly!",m-BZLIIh5PCAKnzH0qj_0Q,2,1,3,dBCeiojPbS06RMzDLwetbQ

Anna was amazing and helpful from the very beginning and was extremely accomodating towards our every need. Anna let us bring in decorations from the night before the event and said they would set up for us the day of the wedding as long as we explained how we wanted everything set up, so we didnt have to stress over it because it is ""your special day"" as she said. They also have hookups for audio/video from a laptop for music etc plus decorative lighting for the walls. All the waiters and bussers were on top of their game that night especially Felipe. He constantly asked if we missed any of the meats or needed more sides. We had a two hour open bar and he definitely made sure we had enough to drink. Even though I had a drink already he let me know the open bar was about to end and if I wanted another Long Island, im in Vegas so how could I say no to free liqour?

First of all the service here is phenomenal. The servers are super attentive and friendly. They made constant checks to see if their was anything we needed.

The food is also amazing too! We shared the Caesar salad, beef carpaccio and one of the steak dishes. Each was very flavorful and just the right portion size. You also can't beat the HH pricing. The total for all that food as well as three drinks was about $40 with tip. You can't go wrong there.

Via Brasil has two different menu options and does not include dessert in either. It was odd to pay more to make sure that you could have every type of meat that came by.
We had 6:30 reservations and arrived almost a half an hour early to sit in the bar for a bit before the rest of the party showed up. It was impossible to put a drink order in at the bar. In the 30 minutes we were there, the bartender apologized several times and finally just told us that we would probably be at our table before she would be able to get us a drink. Again, it was just odd. 
The salad bar had a lot of different options and was pretty fresh. I had to laugh at the ""clams""....when you open the serving dish labeled clams you are greeted with a pile of clam shells and not a clam in sight. The server was friendly and the meat was well prepared.

4557163,2010-05-03,1,gO_z_5FQVHLCiJjOsfE1fg,"I've gone to this place a number of times now, and wow. Just wow. Unless you're a vegetarian, this place is amazing.

If you've never gone to a Brazilian steakhouse before, it's quite an experience. It's all you can eat and you are given a card that's green on one side and red on the other. If you want them to bring more, then green side up. If you're full or just want to take a break, red side up. Of the 18 different meats on the menu, almost all are carried around on what can best be described as mini swords. If the waiter sees your card is green side up, he/she will stop, slice you off as much as you want, and then make way for the next waiter. A few of the bigger items, like beef ribs and salmon, are brought around on a cart, but the same principles apply. The service style is called ""rodizio.""

I've found that the skirt steak, top sirloin, and leg of lamb are the best, but it's entirely subjective. Most of the steaks have a similar seasoning, which has a slight salty taste, but everything is very good. 

The best way to approach this massive intake is to focus on the meats first, then finish off with the salad bar, because let's be real here...you aren't going to get your money's worth if you do it the other way around. The salad bar is well stocked with dishes ranging from meat and seafood entrees to various veggies to appetizer-ish items. They usually have calamari salad and hearts of palm, so I'm always satisfied. 

The drinks at this place are top notch too. There is a respectable wine selection and an assortment of Brazilian drinks, both alcoholic and non-alcoholic. The two worth mentioning are the guarana and caipirinha. The first is a soda that tastes like Red Bull, and the second is the national drink of Brazil. I was expecting the second to be more of a, well...drink, but it turns out it's just straight liquor with a splash of lime juice and sugar. It's got a really good flavor, however, it'll definitely wake you up if you're aren't expecting something so strong. 

The dessert cart merits a look before you decide to call it a night. I'm sort of a tiramisu pig, and theirs is worth trying. I won't say it's the best I've ever had, but I also have impossibly high standards in this field. Theirs is, without a doubt, more than good enough to warrant ordering again. They have creme brulee, cakes, mousses, and a few others too. Come to think of it, their desserts are pretty much what you would expect at an Italian restaurant. 

I would rate this place as one of my favorite restaurants in all of Las Vegas, but I can't really go there too often since it's a little cost-prohibitive. Dinner for two with drinks and dessert will run you about $120 after tax and tip. That said, they do offer some specials that will appeal to more budget-conscious diners. Mon-Thurs from 5-7, they have a limited (meaning only 5 meats without the salad bar) all you can eat special for $18.95 per person, served in the bar area and patio only. They offer the same special on Sat and Sun from noon to 5:00 as well, so you don't really have an excuse not to try this place.  

Make sure Via Brasil is on your radar for your next special occasion. You won't be disappointed.",hAn8Y_EWYxOSUnaZt72h4w,6,2,5,ROwYG39MYjczSKt6Bxbsgg

4580670,2016-06-09,0,gO_z_5FQVHLCiJjOsfE1fg,"Amazing, simply amazing!  Worth the price and the drive.  The salad bar is filled with great selections, and the meat is prepared to perfection, no matter how well done you desire it.  Service was very attentive, and came to the table frequently.  A great place to go for a quality meal to celebrate, or take a date, or even just have a nice personal dinner.  

So tonight I was looking at Brazilian Steakhouses on Yelp, and another reviewer mentioned this place.  I live on the other side of the valley, so I was a little hesitant to make the 30 minute drive when I have a couple of places on my side of town.  Well as soon as I took my first bites, I knew it was worth the drive.

The salad bar had a few different dishes in addition to the standard Brazilian Steakhouse fare.  That being said, after a quick trip around it, I didn't grab much, after all, I'm here for the meats.  

As soon as I sat down from the salad bar trip, I was greeted by the gauchos who brought me several kinds of steak, pork shoulder, and turkey wrapped in bacon.  While I like my meat more on the well done side, there were cuts for every preference.  Once I made it known to the gauchos that I liked the meat more well done, every time they approached my table they offered me the well done portions.  

My server was constantly present refilling my beverage and asking if he could get me side dishes,  Unlike the other places I've visited, here you have to request your sides, but they're included in the price.  They have several options and of course they're all unlimited.  

As it said on their menu there are a couple of things you have to ask for, if you would like to have them, including chicken hearts.  From the first trip I took to a Brazilian Steakhouse, I learned to like the chicken hearts, so I made sure to request them.  When they came, they were plentiful and flavorful.  

The only suggestion I have is for them to leave a menu or list of the meats so you know which ones are upcoming, and when to not fill up.  

The atmosphere was great, the gauchos and servers were very attentive, and most importantly the food was flavorful and delicious.  Well worth the cost, and the drive from anywhere in the Vegas Valley.  

With the prices and the drive it is unlikely this is a weekly destination, but I'll definitely be back for special occasions.  It's also a great place to come when you just feel like celebrating a Wednesday night off (or whatever night you feel.)",iN5505977Li8XYZ3FnzWJQ,2,1,5,EKFnNd7PPWNdEmPWy3wsNg

I was impressed that the manager continued to circle and make sure that we got to try everything we wanted. She made sure to send servers over if there was anything we wanted to try. 

We hit the salad bar first. I wasn't really impressed. I probably would not just do the salad bar, personally I don't think you can compare their salad bar to Texas De Brazil. Not nearly as many options and the food felt kind of picked over and lackluster. 

The meat was great. Well seasoned and delicious. I loved the cooked mozzarella! For dessert we shared three kinds. An incorrect dessert was sent, but the server did take it back and bring out the correct one. The creme brulee was just ok, the crust wasn't fired enough. The panacotta was delicious! The donuts were ok.

4610117,2014-01-01,1,gO_z_5FQVHLCiJjOsfE1fg,"Horrible start to our New Years Eve 2014. Took nearly 50 minutes to get seated after our reservation time. We finally had to point out a table that had been sitting empty for over 20 mins to the host team. One of the main hostesses just rolled her eyes at the other hostess for not seeing it. We were finally seated at 11:10pm. We watched as one other lonely couple also waited as long as us because the hostess gave away their reservation. We witnessed ""cousins of a waiter"" (a party of over 15 people) getting sat without a reservation long before us. We gazed at three empty tables in the bar- which would've suited us fine- but nobody was smart enough to come up with an easy solution. All we really wanted to do was sit down and eat and enjoy time with our friends that were visiting. Where was management in all of this? I started to feel sorry for the staff, all of whom seemed entirely overwhelmed and tossed to the wolves.
A staff member told us that the Manager was too busy waiting on tables and leaving other waiters high and dry with very few tables on this incredibly busy evening. A manager never checked in with us at all the entire night, even after we expressed our dissatisfaction to our server- Girardo. He did the best he could and was pleasant enough. 
The food was okay but the $80 fixed price NYE meal was a big joke, and I would not recommend it to others. The sides were pathetic. The top sirloin was very good. The whole experience was rushed, which was unfortunate as we were trying to spend a nice evening out with out-of-town guests. We had to rush and get everything we wanted from the salad bar before they took it all away right before midnight and changed to desserts. One of my friend's is a vegetarian, so she was counting on another trip up but before we knew it it had been whisked away.
Very hard to justify a $360 bill for four people after the bad start to our dining experience. Over half the restaurant brought their children and they were all running wild all night long. I understand that some families want to be together on NYE, but would you let them go crazy like that on a normal visit to Via Brasil? The music was entirely too loud, we couldn't hear each other at the table. All in all, we couldn't wait to get out of this place and never come back. Definitely leaving Via Brasil in 2013.

4620223,2010-09-16,0,gO_z_5FQVHLCiJjOsfE1fg,"I was recently having a conversation with some people about this place. For some reason, we were also talking about Groupons. I said that if a Groupon ever came up for Via Brasil, I'm jumping on it. Lo and behold, a Groupon appears days later. It was a sign.

I'm pretty sure Via Brasil takes up the space that was formerly (and quite briefly) a Makino's. It's a nice, large, and elegantly decorated restaurant. As soon as you step inside, you know you're in for a culinary treat.

After you're seated, they explain the red/green system - green of course meaning that you're ready for meat! My card stayed green for most of the night. To put it succinctly, Via Brasil serves up some of the most amazing cuts of meat I've ever eaten. Sure there were some items that weren't quite up to par, but most of it was absolutely awesome. To be honest, it's all quite a blur. They just kept coming and coming and coming. And I just kept saying yes yes yes!

Surprisingly, I didn't enjoy the bacon-wrapped tenderloin that much. It was the weirdest and most unexpected thing. I actually thought the bacon got in the way of the flavor! On the other end of the spectrum, the last cut I received was some sort of garlic-infused meat. Looking at their web site, I think it is the ""Noble Cut of Picanha in Garlic."" Wow. I was full by that point, but that didn't stop me from getting a second cut. It was the perfect ending.

If I ever go back, I think I know what strategy I would employ. I noticed that the cuts of meat I enjoyed most were light and very much on the rare side. The cuts I didn't enjoy as much tended to be dense, which caused them to be not as tender and way more filling.

Oh I should mention the salad bar. You might think one would ignore it. The reality is, you need something on your plate to balance out that meat. It's really much more than just a salad bar and the choices are mostly delicious, but definitely use that only as a complement to the meat. You are here for the meat!

One thing I didn't realize is that dessert is not included. I couldn't resist getting some of their Tiramisu. It was pretty good, but not sure it was worth the extra $8. I know it's a silly thing to mention since the Rodizio meal is $43, but it's good to know.

This place is very much in the vein of Fogo de Chao in Los Angeles and other major cities.   Our visit occurred during Carnaval season and as a result we had a great time with all the dancers they brought in and all the beads and decorations at the tables.  It was a very festive atmosphere the night we ate dinner here.   

The biggest piece of advice I can give about this place to newbies is ""don't eat for a day prior to going.""  Cuz, you are going to want to gorge yourself on all the yummy meats.   Everywhere you turn there is a waiter carving up some kind of yummy morsal of meat.  If you haven't been to one of these meat fests, the general idea is that you sit and waiters bring meat to your table and carve off what you would like to try.   They keep coming until you tell them to stop. When you are seated each person is given a set of green and red cards.  You put the green card out when you are ready to eat and you put the red card out when your pants can take no more. 

With chicken, beef, pork and more, you simply can't go hungry.  If you need some veggies they have the greens covered in a large salad bar which you can visit to your hearts content.   The food was really enjoyable and I would go again.    If you make it out of this place hungry then surely hell has frozen over.

Luke warm and bland lobster bisque, cheese selection limited, Brazilian rice and beans also only luke warm.  Mussels, clams and chicken were hot and very good.

Servers are trained to offer chicken and pork products REPEATEDLY  before bringing top sirloin, flank steak and tough tri-tip.  Small shrimp were also offered.  Side dishes were served three times before WE had to ask for other items which are included on the Sterling menu.  

Clever:  fill 'em up with the cheap stuff so they are too full to consume the expensive meats.  Not so clever at all.

Which featured menu items were never voluntarily offered and did we have to ask for?   lamb chops, prime rib, ribeye steak, salmon.  One serving of each meat received, never a morsel of the salmon.

4766632,2009-08-08,0,gO_z_5FQVHLCiJjOsfE1fg,"Via Brasil is a Brazilian churrascaria that is pretty far off the strip.  Unless money is no object, I wouldn't recommend travelling by taxi. Odds are your taxi ride will cost more than the meal itself.  If you are sick of the buffets and looking for a meat coma, this is the place.

Walking in, we felt we came under-dressed as the place had an upscale feel to it.  A nice place to go when you are all dressed-up  But Monday night seemed pretty slow and the few people there were all casually dressed.

Salad bar had some interesting items such as carpaccio.  The quality of all the skewer meats we tried was excellent.  Every piece we tried was flavorful and amazingly tender.  While there are 18 choices offered on the menu, we maybe saw maybe 12 of those 18 rotating through (but again, that may have been due to it being a weeknight).

18 styles of meat offered on the menu:
pork ribs
pork loin
ribeye
salmon
sausage
chicken drumsticks
lamb chops
turkey with bacon
skirt steak
suckling pig
picanha (top sirloin)
chicken breast
flank steak
beef ribs
garlic picanha
tenderloin in bacon
leg of lamb
prime rib

Desserts were top-notch as well.  I had the creme brulee which was a fairly large order and was probably one of the best I've ever tasted.  My friend had the coconut flan and that was an excellent choice as well.  Save room for dessert if you can.

Service was excellent (on the weeknight).  Skewers came by quickly and waiters came by frequently to refill drinks and ask if we needed anything.

Highly recommended.",0sx5TdONSzMazJh33xgI6g,7,1,5,LyyrCpDjdIXR4ZmWZbBibQ

4869545,2010-04-07,1,gO_z_5FQVHLCiJjOsfE1fg,"Recently, my family of 4 (my wife, two kids-9 & 6, myself) celebrated my wife's birthday at Via Brasil.  She had been there once before, but this was the first visit for the rest of us.  I had trepidations from reading so many comments about how ""formal"" it was, and how it was not good for children.  Both of those comments could not be farther from what we experienced!

When I made reservations online, I clearly indicated that we would have two young children, maybe just to see if the restaurant would give some indication of their reaction...but within 10 minutes, I got a phone call to confirm the request and welcoming our children to dine with us.  At that time, I also mentioned that it was my wife's birthday, and they graciously said they would ""do something"" as a surprise.  Yes, I know this is becoming perhaps an all-too-familiar 'perk' for restaurants as well as many diners (to have to hear Happy Birthday chanted several times during their meal!).

The decor is upscale and suggests the kind of place with some snoot appeal, where people may come to be seen, but let's face it, this is a suburban restaurant, and what restaurant would risk alienating the down-to-earth folks with an overly haughty attitude these days?  Via Brasil gets it just right in that the 'hardware' is upscale and formal, but the staff and service is engaging and friendly, without any pretentiousness whatsoever.

When we arrived, I immediately noticed many parties with children...although I couldn't help but note that they all seemed to be seated in the front section of the restaurant, and that maybe the staff was consciously trying to keep the back part of the large open dining area somewhat kid-free and quiet.  It didn't matter to us - the entire dining room is beautiful, and the food is the same regardless of what GPS cell your table is in!

As for the food, I rated it 4 stars and not 5 just because there were some items that were not quite as superlative as others.  Everything happened as others have mentioned:  you sit for a short while, order drinks, and build up a little more anticipation, but then it's a bee-line to the buffet, which had more variety than the average casino/hotel buffet.  Salads, soups, and various hot dishes (stroganoff, a curry dish, a risotto, seafood paella, etc.), along with appetizers that were presented well and tasted great (carpaccio, asparagus,  etc.).  NOTE:  The captain had come over shortly after we were seated to let me know that our 9-year old would be given a very reduced price for the entire meal (around $15, I think), and she would be able to eat anything she wanted (all meats, etc.), and that our 6-year old would not be charged at all.  While I don't know if that's their standard policy, I felt that was more than fair, and certainly goes a long way to encourage ""family dining"" at this restaurant from time to time.  The waitstaff was great in handling our children, too, always stopping at each one of them to see if they, too, wanted to try whatever cut of meat they were offering on each round.

Even as we were coming back with full plates of appetizers, freshly grilled meats were being 'walked' around the tables, and the noshing (if one can 'nosh' on meats!) started right away.  Before we knew what hit us, we had cuts and slices of so many different types of meats...and most of it was excellent.  All of the beef offerings (rib eye, picanha, flank steak, garlic picanha, and the prime rib; we passed on the ribs because they were too huge and wouldn't fit on our plates at the time) were fantastic.  My wife enjoyed the lamb chops immensely, though I wish we had stuck around for the leg of lamb to make its rounds.  The other offerings - turkey, pork, and salmon - were a little hit-or-miss, probably because I prefer my meats less 'garnished', and these were typically crusted or sprinkled with parmesan or wrapped in bacon.  Actually, I enjoyed the salmon, though many may find its smoked flavoring a little washed out and bland, and its texture a little pasty instead of flaky (imagine cooked small roe!).  The sausage didn't do anything for me...but then again, I'm not a sausage fan.

Before we knew it, almost 2 hours had elapsed, which is saying a lot when dining with 2 children!  They had sampled quite a few meats, too, and while it may not become their favorite restaurant, I think the ""bigness"" of the experience kept them from becoming restless, and they both said they enjoyed VBS.

I'm running out of room here..so I'll just say LEAVE ROOM FOR DESSERT!  They also remembered my quick comment about my wife's birthday, and delivered birthday wishes as requested!  Definitely a place to consider for all occasions, but do plan on spending a good deal of time and money (around $150 for the entire experience, even with the generous discounts for the kids, and we aren't wine drinkers).  I hope this place stays around a while!!",xuSHcXE_3IXoRyg5LObSpA,2,1,4,Xw9TdXYaltP25vP7zcidew

Unbelievable. Not only was there plenty of deliciousness at the salad bar, they were happy to modify side dishes and were extra careful to let me know if anything anyone else ordered had dairy. Brazilians favor olive oil to butter, so this didn't effect my choices too much. 

If you're vegetarian or vegan, or have an allergy, this place sure goes the extra mile to accommodate you.

When we got sat it wasn't the most desirable table, come to find out it was amazing. We were right next to the Salad Bar. Wasn't bothered by others going to it.

Our server was amazing. We had the 25.00 off coupon, and it was applied no questions asked. She recommended drinks that were amazing. When you get some of them, you are in shock how small they are.... Trust me take a drink. They have a punch, yet still very well balanced. Our server asked if she could surprise us with a round. Let me tell you, the drink was amazing. It was Passion Fruit, Mango, X-Rated... amazing. Just ask they will know.

THE MEAT: All of it tasted great. Though we only saw two different kinds of meat that were exclusive on the Sterling Menu. Though if you ask, they will get it out to you. Huge plus. Everything was exactly what you asked. If they noticed you eat your meat more well done they will try to get some more of your taste out. 

Salad Bar: great selection. The whole time I was there, there was someone changing out plates, even if they weren't empty. They stayed in top of it. I just wished they had the Muscles on the hit plates. Though it just shows how they rotate what they have. 

In all it was an amazing experience. The only thing is the front of the house staff, as in the host stand, and such. Need better communication. It seemed they were the only ones running around with their head cut off. Still polite though. You have Open Table use it. More so with how large your restaurant is.

Even the salad bar items were top notch and had more than just the typical carb fillers. I took small portions of mozzarella, mushrooms and roasted peppers as my sides and sampled a couple of the ""hot"" items like asparagus risotto and coconut chicken (both excellent).

I tried most of the meats, bowing out at times because the service was almost too fast! I could barely keep up, having to temporarily flip my coaster to ""red"" to avoid plate overload. Everything I tried was tender, flavorful and served up hot and fresh from the skewer. Definitely bring your appetite and a lot of cash- this restaurant is not cheap. Bill for two, with tip, easily topped $100 AFTER the $50 Groupon certificate. Worth every dime. I wish I could have crammed down more than two bites of flan and a small Cappuccino for dessert.

5073408,2017-12-18,0,gO_z_5FQVHLCiJjOsfE1fg,"I have a confession.  Guilty pleasure be damned.  

I am a steak snob.  

Chicago is famous for several things, but alongside the famous deep dish pizzas are their wet aged steaks.  Beef has been a passion ever since at age 8, my brother and I, being as the latchkey kids typical of those times (nod to Stranger Things), we would come home and raid the fridge.  On this occasion, we found a steak.  Dad loved to cook steak.  He'd sear them perfectly - you'd know because he'd tell my brother and I to grab a towel and start fanning so the smoke detector wouldn't go off.  This particular specimen was a huge slab of chuck roast frozen stiff.  Who knew about defrosting or marinating or any of that - we certainly didn't - all we were certain of was that we were so starved we couldn't bear to wait for Mom or Dad to come home.  We thought we knew.  I knew how to turn on an oven.  And ketchup was good on fries so, in you go.  Forty-five minutes later, dad arrives and smells the kitchen asking if we were cooking something.  Of course we said no.  He found the steak in the trash, where we tossed it.  It was foul.  That's when dad dared not spare the rod.

I discovered churrascarias in the early 2000's starting with Fogo de Chao  and another soon after that was owned by White Sox coach Ozzie Guillen.  This turned into a summer of steak, once dating a girl by taking her on a whirlwind foodie tour on all the churrascarias we could find.  We didn't care - we were still in our 20's and our metabolisms were still on overdrive.  

Needless to say, churrascarias are MY thing.  Fast forward 10 years to Vegas.  My wife and I tried nearly all the churrascarias in town.  The chains.  The ones off strip.  Some good, some bad, some whose quality at first encounter was a shadow of their former glory.

Today, my friends.  We found the best churrascaria ever.  Ever.

Why?  Because their Sunday brunch includes the full on churrascaria menu, but also breakfast.  Yes! Omelette stations and waffles!  The maple syrup (it was national maple syrup day earlier this week) was the real deal.  The kind that refuses mightily to leave the ladle and have to be coaxed gently into each crevice.  But I digress.  Unapologetically, I love waffles.

The salad bar has a decent lobster bisque and they also offer clams, much to my wife's delight.  She also loved the white rice and black beans, which is cooked with a pork or bacon in the traditional Spanish style.

The meats are standard top sirloin picanha, garlic steak, ham, roasted pineapple (delish), beef rib.  The difference is that they are seasoned and cooked just right.  What I mean by that is that the chef has preserved the taste of the beef unique to the cut without overpowering the flavor with spices.  This is the way a churrascaria should be - each and every time.

Mea maxima mea culpa for the lengthy preamble.  I highly recommend and would go so far as saying this is a Las Vegas Best.",Fzk6lQcLZrCQWHDF1uLyJA,1,0,5,nPMM7x3K_Qy0xm214KafQQ

Pinot Grigio and Pinot noir not on the happy hour. Ordered Pinot anyway and it was old.  Looked at the happy hour bar menu and they had filet mignon sliders priced HH price 4.75 or reg price 2 for 8. Wth!!  Prices were like that throughout menu??? So we had 2 drinks and 2 sliders for 46.

Their specialty is the picanha (or House Sirloin). Its tender slices will melt-in-your-mouth. Another personal favorite is the tangy chicken. 

I've never seen a salad bar that has fresh lobster bisque or watermelon topped with diced jicama. The little bites of Brazilian bread are delectable dipped in the bisque! 

Try the caipirinha--a Brazilian cocktail--but sip it slowly as it's nearly straight alcohol. The light refreshing taste can fool you! 

Sunday Brunch features a good selection of their most popular meats, along with a ""made-to-order"" omelette and waffle bar and the gourmet salad bar. The mimosas delightfully round out the brunch. 

For tourists, Via Brasil is worth the cab trip off of the Strip to see what else Vegas has to offer. For locals, it's a slice of heaven!",NPmKodK-FMd7jsql8E9Tbg,1,1,5,AgcwrCDd5cicYNnMLzuoag

Delicious!! Great wine selections too! The meat of course was varied in selection, perfectly seasoned, dripping with juices, tender as all hell, and some of it is wrapped in bacon.

5122958,2016-10-23,5,gO_z_5FQVHLCiJjOsfE1fg,"I usually hit Fogo de Chao when they hit me with 50% deals to my inbox and because of that, I truly forgot how good this place is.

Since I've hit every Brazilian place in town I'll point out the pros and cons of deciding on this place vs. heading elsewhere further down below...

THE OFFERING:
They give you two dinner options. One is $39.99 for 85% of the menu. The other is $49.99 and you get to add on unlimited rack of lamb, shrimp, filet mignon, table side cut ribeye, salmon, etc. Since it's main competition is Fogo de Chao and Texas de Brasil which are both $49.99, we all decided to do the premium dinner anyway and get the full experience (note, Pampas and Bertollucci in town are garbage. AVOID).

PROS:
-Excellent quality meat, very tender and flavorful. Better than Fogo and way better than that Pampas dump, about as good as Texas de Brasil (town square).
-Great service, they're friendly, you tell them what you want, they'll bring it cooked exactly how you like it, even if the entire table likes it's meat cooked differently.
-Beef carpaccio on the salad bar! -was very good and all you can eat. No other place has this.
-Lobster bisque on the bar was excellent, actually better than the bisque at sterling brunch.
-Grilled shrimp had a nice scampi flavor and they are generous with it as they come around.
-Fried, melted mozzarella with oregano, takes me back to the beach in Rio. Delicious and no other churrascaria in town offers this as well. It's good! A must try...
-The atmosphere is nice and the tables are well separated so you feel like you have your own space as opposed to some of the madness at Texas de Brasil. I like the smaller dining room feel and private space.
-The rack of lamb was large and meaty, bigger than most and cooked perfectly.

CONS:
-The pao de queso (cheese bread) wasn't totally hot and fresh and fluffy like I'm used to. My advice is to limit yourself on this addicting, cheesy ball of dough anyway, so not a big deal.
-The banana that I requested them to bring at the end of the meal desperately needed more brown sugar and perhaps a little caramel and a touch of cream. It wasn't sweet like the ones at Texas de Brasil.
-The accompanying sauces are hard to find and should have their own place on the salad bar to grab. I had to ask for mint jelly, the Brazilian style orange colored traditional steak sauce was no where to be found. There wasn't any horseradish (I forgot to ask) and the chimichurri sauce (which was on the salad bar) had next to it such a tiny, yet deep condiment dish that all the good stuff settled to the bottom and it seemed I was dipping the meat into oil rather than being able to dig into that good green stuff. Advice for next time would be to ask for all 4 sauces up front before the meat parade starts your way.
-Seldom do they offer discounts like Fogo de Chao and the occasional ones I find for Texas de Brazil.

OVERALL:
The quality of meat, the grilled shrimp, the lobster bisque, the beef carpaccio and the melted mozzarella are what puts this place towards the very top of the Brazilian steakhouse Vegas cluster. I was very pleased with the service and food and we all walked out a perfectly happy, bloated mess.",r52bugu98l77gdqTnIJ2oQ,10,6,5,0wvtS33p2VmOD619XUlmZA

Hello beautiful unabashed protein fix!!
We were sat next to a wall and asked to be moved to a different table. They easily honored our request, even the Hostess helped us move our drinks to a center situated table. 
We all ordered the Sterling level. 
The cheesy rolls, pão de queijo ... ehh, I have certainly had much better. They were a bit too gummy and seriously under baked inside.
The salad bar, again...ehh. Much to be desired. As a ranch dressing fiend, it did taste housemade which was nice. But many items from the salad bar were overly and unnecessarily salty, imo. The beef carpaccio has two dabs of green olive puree, not sure why. I was told the lobster bisque was adequate, not great. 
Service -- really was very good. All of the servers, runners and the meat skewer guys were helpful, informative and stopped to check on us the entire evening in a not-so intrusive way. 
Looking at their menu posted online, we pretty much had every option at some point in the evening. Including leg of lamb -decent enough, baby lamb chops, sooo cute, but overcooked. Brazilian pork was moist if you asked not for the crispy part, melted mozz - all of the good parts of a pizza.
Sides were okay, mashed potatoes, asparagus, broccoli, mushrooms, fried bananas. The spinach was not completely wilted, perhaps that was a cost savings procedure? 
We all opted for dessert and espressos and cappuccino...passion fruit mousse - not my thing, but not terrible. Flan, no caramelized sugar sauce, but again not terrible. Chocolate mousse....slightly disappointing. It is one of my few dessert weaknesses...almost could not taste the pudding that was definitely whipped in.
In all, disappointed especially because of the proximity.

And please don't get me wrong, I will be brutally honest in this review, but this is only with the intention of helping the leadership team at this restaurant identify some disappointing shortcomings I saw during my last visit. 

As mentioned earlier, this restaurant has worked hard to become a really great churrasqueria in Las Vegas, but yesterday's visit left much to be desired. Let me explain. Hosting several family members for the holidays, I was torn as to what restaurant I could take them to so they could experience a ""wow"" dining experience, so I chose Via Brazil since they had previously earned my business with great service. In fact, Felipe (our usual waiter) is one of the friendliest and most welcoming waiter there.

Having said that, this visit was disastrous! It started with a long wait for meats to come to the table, then the waiters were slow, uninterested in serving us and borderline rude. For example, after trying to cut a piece of meat off the skewer onto my plate, a waiter spilled steak fat onto my shirt... No big deal as it was an accident. What really upset me was the waiter was completely unapologetic and only asked me if I wanted something to clean myself up with.  With an obvious YES as my response, he walked away for close to ten minutes and the sent a different waiter with a rag to clean up the mess. Really?! You spill food on a customer and this is your attitude?

The second disappointing mishap was their digital frequent diner program. I have been a member for a while but this time it seemed I annoyed the waiter when I asked him to credit me with the visit. In fact, he denied the free desert I had earned (despite there being no disclaimer on the promotion) and then proceeded to give my family members grief about using their frequent diner app because it was ""downloaded on the same day of the visit"". Are you telling me this restaurant spends money in a rewards program only to have its staff discourage diners from using it? That's a shame. 

Lastly, here are some other turn offs from the visit: dirty coffee cups, table was not bussed throughout the visit and waiters' appearance, service standards and demeanor left much to be desired.

       - The top four you must try, in order of deliciousness is Beef Ribs, Top Sirloin, Prime Rib, and the Grilled Salmon with Orange Creme Sauce.
       - The garlic steak and flank steak were good, but a little bland comparatively
       - The pork tenderloin with Parmesan cheese is another thing that you should try.
       - Ones to avoid taking up unnecessary room in your tummy for the good stuff would be the Chicken Drumstick, Leg of Lamb, Beef Tenderloin wrapped in Bacon, Turkey wrapped in Bacon.

              - French Fries/Onion Rings/Asparagus by request only.
       - Beef Ribs - So meaty, they cut you a piece off the bone. It's perfectly seasoned and is the only meat I had thirds of. It has just enough fat to melt in your mouth. 
       - Top Sirloin - My second favorite meat. However, the edge slices do tend to be a little salty. The inside slices are just right.
       - Prime Rib - Very moist. One of the juiciest pieces of meat I've ever had. No homo.
       - Grilled Salmon with Orange Creme Sauce - I usually hate cooked salmon, but the orange creme sauce was delicious. It must of been made with fresh oranges because it tasted like freshly squeezed orange juice, but as a creme.
       - Flank Steak - Juicy, but a little bland next to the other meats. 
       - Garlic Steak - Same as the flank, but with a garlic flavor.
       - Pork Tenderloin with Parmesan cheese - Thin layer of fried cheese around a normally bland meat. It was definitely something I didn't mind trying. 
       - Sausage
       - Beef Tenderloin and Turkey, both wrapped in Bacon - Mostly just tasted like bacon.
       - Leg of Lamb - A little dry, but it could of just been the piece I got.
       - Chicken drumstick
**Recommendations**
       - I would definitely recommend this place for a nice evening out or a special occasion. The price is a bit steep, but you're paying for food and an experience.",37S80IUIfb8yMsSwWWDsFA,1,1,4,yNPyWuvdKuBYYgBKWX37DQ

The brunch is phenomenal. With $17 all you can drink mimosas, bellinis, strawberry kir royales, mango champagne, white wine spritzers, and sangria. You cannot get a better deal. $6.50 is not a bad deal either, but you might as well go all in and enjoy yourself. 

The meat selection consisted of 9-10 different cuts of different animals. The picanha, garlic sirloin, prime rib, and pineapple were the group favorites. If the rodizio attendants don't come around regularly enough, you can ask the waiter to send them over.

The salad bar was where I found them to be weaker. I wish I could say that something stood out, but it was all relatively standard. The omelet and waffle bar does make up for it though.

But I just can't give it more than 2 stars when compared to other Rodizios, even other non-chain Rodizios.  

We were there at 4pm on a Saturday.  We were one of only a handful of tables.  The ambiance is pretty, spacious, even bordering on elegant.  The salad bar has a few standout items (beef carpacio, Greek salad, mushrooms)  But most wasn't.

I liked that there are a selection of items that are brought to the table upon request.  But again, what we tried was lacking.  The spinach as undercooked, the asparagus overcooked.  The cheese bread was too big and rather heard.  The bananas were under ripe and bitter.  The demi-glaze wasn't reduced enough and the mint jelly was overly gelatinzed.

We ordered the Sterling menu and there are supposed to be 21 meats.  We were there for almost 2 hours and only saw 11 meats.  The rib eye and shrimp were probably the only two stand outs.  Both flavorful and well cooked.  But the lamb chops were gristly, the leg of lamb was too gamy and we are huge lamb fans.  The salmon came with a wonderful sauce but was so overcooked.

Why not 5 stars then?

When you are paying $50 a plate. You don't really expect to be told that we are out of asparagus? Especially when Smith's is across the road.

Out of Brazilian sausage? You got to be kidding me. It is the part of the $50 plate. Why would you be out of it when you have it on the menu. Now if it was jack in the box, I would totally get it.

Furthermore, no manager came to ask us as to how we were doing? Or offer some compensation or apology for being out of the main menu dishes. Let me remind you, it was a party of 4 with drinks totaling more than $250 plus tip.

No effort was made to apologize for not having the menu items in stock. Now, if they were charging $20 a plate, they would have got 5 stars.

Happy hour is 5-8pm daily (on the patio, or at the bar), and it is pretty awesome.  There is a very good selection of appetizers for $5-6, and a lot of them are very, very tasty.  I've tried the sliders, empanadas, asparagus risotto, and beef carpaccio.  Everything was great, and  I can't wait to go back to try everything else.  The salads look delicious.
The $5-6 drink specials are great too.  They offer mojitos (classic, or muddled with fruit), and also caipirinhas.  The caipirinha is a pretty strong drink made with lime juice, sugar, and an alcohol made from sugar cane juice (tastes kind of like light rum).  You also have the option of having this with muddled fruit.  It's great with kiwi, and extra lime.

We only wanted iced tea and my 13 yr old wanted a coke . The waiter literally told us my sons coke would not be refillable unless we had the $48 alcohol wristbands for myself and husband.  Annoyed but we just agreed and went on with our time there . At the end we received the bill with 20% gratuity added in . Waiter didn't mention it of course . I asked on their FB page since when did they add automatic gratuity for 3 people ? I was asked to call Anna and told they do not auto gratuity 3 people . She was so nice  and apologetic . Told me she would speak to GM . Anna called back and said the GM wanted me to come in today at 4pm. I told her I had hurt my foot and it wasn't easy for me to drive but would have my husband take me . 
Went at 4pm to Speak to GM (assuming the owner ) . He was extremely defensive , rude , kept saying clearly I didn't want to tip the $55 I had tipped . He kept telling me that the auto gratuity was optional and only suggested . WHAT A LIE ! The bill total included the gratuity . Since when do you have the option to not pay your total bill due ? He then told me he would Speak to the server about the pushy attitude he had but that it was still just a suggested gratuity ?!? So , i asked why he asked me to come there when I live 20 min away when he wasn't trying to make the situation right , only arguing with me . He said I had no reason to come in ?!? This place is an absolute joke ! I only went in as they asked me to . 
He said he would give me back whatever part of the tip I wanted . Even proceeded to tell me that the waiter had brought me $55 change while I was at the restaurant ?? The bill was 265.00 .. I gave $280 .. how would he have brought me $55 in change. lol . The waiter never came back with any kind of change .
I ended up telling him quite frankly his customer service skills were shocking and I didn't come up there for free with my husband and kids in the car so I would just take my tip back  . Way to earn business . Been there many times with larger parties and will NEVER be back . 
Was warned by 2 former employees this guy was horrid but definitely saw that for myself now . 
*I was curious about the auto gratuity but My real complaint was only about being told to spend $48x2 people for my son to get refills on his drink . GM turned this into a tip issue and made me look cheap so fine I'll take my tip and give it to someone who wants my business . Thx !",fQ9owsz3ap05vrGrTLPa4Q,2,1,1,AQ5774Bj19baJRH2uaee3A

I absolutely loved their sauteed  spinach side, as well as their broccoli, asparagus, and mushrooms.

I really have not been happy with the Brazilian meat fest restaurants in this town so far, and I've tried to Texas de Brazil and Pampas, which were both pretty awful.  Via Brasil Steakhouse was not really impressive either, as I had a huge stomach ache after eating here, but not because of filling up so much.  

A lot of the meat was fairly tough and mostly not that flavorful to me.  However I did like the beef ribs, as they were cut off the bone and delicious.  The salad bar is decent, but if you come to a Brazilian steakhouse for the salad, I would go to Texas de Brazil first.  There's more variety for about the same price.

What makes this restaurant stand out however from other Brazilian steakhouses is the immense amount of sides you can order, which are all complimentary.  Normally, you get a few different sides and the rest is at the salad bar.  Here, there's tons including bananas, different vegetables, fries, and other potato fare.  Loved it!

The most redeeming part is the bartenders who even though they had a crowded bar tended to everyone promptly and had conversation. 

The hostesses weren't polite at all. We were sat 30 mins after our reservation, which overall isn't to bad considering other people were waiting over an hour past their reservation time with walking being seated before all of us. When asked an approximate wait the hostesses would immediately grab the phone and try to ignore the large mass of people with the same question. When asking for the manager, everyone was told ""she's to busy.""

After finally being sat we looked at the side order menu and when then told the only two available from the list were mashed potatoes and asparagus. The salad bar was very lacking. The bread was delivered with raw dough centers. The medium and medium rare meats has a leathery skin. The bacon wrapped filet had raw bacon where the meats touched on the skewer. The waiter was only seen twice in the hour we were seated. The meat servers while polite seemed to come all at once or not at all. The side dishes were a children's portion for a table of four and they would not bring more than one at a time. 

Overall. If you're looking for a nice decor for drinks at a bar I would recommend it with the courteous and excellent bartenders as a Brazilian steakhouse. Save your time and money and go elsewhere.",6apIAMezsfd0a1-iDstl6Q,1,0,1,g9HMpfVrjFqiBwy65KBH1Q

I know it tastes great, I know it is a somewhat unique way to dine, but I can never get past the 44 dollar or more price tag so when I received my father's day $29.99 coupon I had to go and take the whole family.  The salad bar was fresh and the lobster bisque was ok, if a little flat.  But we don't come here for the salad, so I turned my card up and said bring on the meat.  The favorites were the pork loin (surprisingly tender and flavorful), the lamb, the pork ribs, and the fillet wrapped in bacon.  The fails were the chicken and turkey which were dry and appeared overcooked.  Also the salmon was bland.  The rest of the meats included beef ribs, sirloin, strip steak, and sausage.  

They come around often and mostly ignore the button, asking you anyway.  The sides are not very good and you don't really need them as your salad bar should give you the illusion of eating something healthy.  Pace yourself and don't be afraid to say no or come back later.

Of note: Kids are 14.99.  Happy Hour is 5-8 pm daily and includes a selection of appetizers and drink specials.  Thursday night is locals night and women are 29.99 and men 39.99 plus the appetizer specials are for the entire restaurant.

Salad bar - Fogo's is bigger but the quality is same. Rice better at Via.
Caipirhina - Via wins for smoothness of this classic drink from Brazil.
Cheese bread - Fogo gets the nod for lighter and fluffier dough.
Meat - tie. You will prefer some cuts at one locale over another but it's a wash in the end
Side dishes - Fogo wins here. Via has no fried polenta and their fried bananas pale in comparison to the maduros at Fogo.
Desserts - too full, couldn't eat any at Via.

Bottom line: Fogo is still the standard but you will not be disappointed by Via and I wouldn't hesitate to go to Via again. Luv that Brazilian churrascaria.",PQAR1z013WjtH6bMl5295A,0,0,4,tG6vttllz_4-HRU5bGnwnQ

The meats that were brought around were all excellent, but we both especially loved the bacon wrapped turkey. The selections on the salad bar were extensive, varied, and everything we tried was delicious. The chimichurri sauce must be mentioned, and was bursting with flavor.

The food is disgusting how can anyone like this place? Oh because you can get a cheap brunch for $29 but you get what you pay for. 

They have zero business serving Brazilian meat. 

Their meat is flavorless and they obviously cook the meat super cold. The meats are never red nor pinkish they are always a dull brown. 

If you get the filet mignon eggs Benedict the hollandaise sauce taste of just lemon. The filet has zero seasoning. 

Their salad bar is even worse.  The cous cous over cooked, the soups just everything here is POOR QUALITY. 

I honestly feel like only older people enjoy this place because of the price and those who do not really have a refined pallet.

Yes they have a salad bar with a lot of nice items but vegetarians will never get full value out of this place.  With that said, I have been to other Brazilian places in town and this is probably the best.  It looks nice inside and the food quality is quite high.  The price, while ""high"" in a general sense, is pretty competitive within the Brazilian market.

So why not five stars?  To be sure my last visit was quite recent and quite good.  But, in the past, I have experienced some of the knocks others have noted.  Specifically, waiters that seem to walk right by my table while I sit there, sometimes for a long time, waiting for more meat.  Also - in the past I have also experienced a certain level of ""grief"" when trying to use a coupon that this place sent me!  If it's a problem, don't send it to me!  

Hopefully these things have been corrected, I did not experience them on my most recent visit I am glad to say, and I probably will be back in time.

The bar is to the left of the entrance and it's a great size. Good amount of seating and little tables around it as well. They opened the side on the restaurant next to the bar where you can feel the perfect spring breeze while enjoying appetizers and drinks. There is outside seating if you want to enjoy the outdoors. The salad bar was not too overwhelming. They had your salads, one type of soup, little bite size refreshing appetizers and some amazing chilies! We got the ""sterling"" which is $50.99 per person but you get all the meats on the menu. You can request some meats that you don't see coming out with your waiter and they'll make it for you in the back. Which I think is amazing! Fresh and ready for you in just a few minutes while the cutters come walking around giving you other choices of meats. They are super generous and all of the workers are so kind. We met one of the owners and she is great! Super sweet. My hubby's favorite meat was probably the beef short ribs and I think it was garlic steak. I love the shrimp, chicken hearts and the salmon. The best side was probably the fried bananas! The breading was perfectly done and it wasn't greasy at all. It's amazing! The bartender is awesome too.

Lobster bisque tasted like slurping butter.

5793370,2014-02-15,5,gO_z_5FQVHLCiJjOsfE1fg,"Ugh, Valentine's Day service! So many reasons to HATE this place. Here's why: 

Arrived in time for our dinner reservation at 9pm, only to be lied to constantly about the wait time. Wait time? With a reservation??? Apparently so. We hung out at the bar with a lot if other angry people with delayed reservations. Management came and went, never really providing much of an update and obviously had little concern for what was going on. We heard cuss words. Not very professional at all. 

Since we were seated about an hour late, the salad bar was beyond picked over. There wasn't much left and it was messy. 

The side dishes were skimpy. The spinach was salty. Other sides were ok but very small. 

The meat servers never seemed to make it to our table. They circled through the tables on the same pattern, and always ran out of meat just before our table. Awesome. In an hour, we had only been served meat three times. Wow. 

I checked in on Yelp, which offered a free dessert, only to be told that they would NOT honor the free check in coupon because it was a ""holiday"". Well....THEN WHY DO you HAVE a check in coupon?!?! The dessert we did have was disappointing (watery Tiramisu). 

We have been to all the Brazilian style steakhouses in Vegas, and loved it. Viva does NOT do Brazilian steakhouses justice. In fact, the poor service and bad food make the other steakhouses more appealing. Viva makes McDonalds look appealing. 

I can honestly say that we will NEVER be back and we will tell all our friends, family and coworkers about our horrible experience here. Cannot believe this restaurant will be in business much longer treating customers like this. HORRIBLE.",-95gDpECFDSjWEL1AIrkAA,7,3,1,mV49hbG5WwY5E26rbVloNg

For Easter, the salad bar and dessert section was disappointing. There were only 2 dessert options which neither tasted very good and the salad bar was small and minimal choices.

Brunch is 24.99 pp normally however I joined the on line e-club for free and was immediately sent via email an invite for 19.99 pp, hell yeah! FYI kids under 5 eat free. All you can eat/AYCE!

Wow, I came across this restaurant and brunch info by accident while browsing the web and I am sure glad I did!

The description of the brunch was mouth watering and I have been dreaming of going for four weeks now, was just waiting for a Sunday that my boyfriend did not work.

Complimentary drinks, fresh squeezed pineapple, strawberry and orange juice are available for $3.50 per glass.

They have a beautiful super fresh hot and cold Gourmet salad bar, that includes lobster bisque soup, bacon, sausage, hashed browns, cheese blintz,  and many homemade salads and a delicious ranch dressing! I really enjoyed the Caprese salad mmm yum and they have bottles of the best Olive oils around that you can use. My boyfriend really enjoyed the roasted peppers and eggplant. This is just listing a few as they have close to 35 items in their hot and cold gourmet salad bar!

Fresh omelet station, eggs benedict or eggs any style for your own creation made to order, and Belgium waffles made fresh as well!

You are given a rodizio marker for your table and when you want meat brought to your table you place it on the green side, and when you have had enough or are working on what you have then you flip it over to the red and they will not come to your table.

Mmmm yum they also give you a side of fresh mashed potatoes and some delicious fried bananas which were the best I have ever had in my life!!!!!!

They have a cart of fresh banana bread and another bread,  however once she said banana I knew I must have and did not hear what the other was. It was the best banana bread I have ever had the pleasure of eating! I had seconds on that for sure!

The brunch is rodizio style so there are 6 choices of meats coming around at all times to make the rounds to your table. They are generous and are constantly on the move making sure you are satisfied and have everything you need or could ever want! 

List of meats cut table side. Top sirloin, tenderloin wrapped in bacon, turkey wrapped in bacon, prime rib, chicken drumsticks, smoked ham and pineapple. Keep in mind this selection is only for brunch, their dinner service has closer to 16 meats. 

The bacon wrapped turkey was an explosion of flavor all up in my mouth! The prime rib was delicious and melted in my mouth like butta!

The service was Amazing, everyone on staff catering to our every need, refills of iced tea galore, my glass never even had the chance to get half full at any point! 

They cleared plates, brought plates, folded our napkins back up every time we left the table, they were on it! This restaurant for sure values and appreciates their customers!

Heather was an Amazing Server by the way, her smile and sweet, helpful, knowledgeable personality was refreshing. If I owned a restaurant I would love to have her on my staff!

This was a real treat for my sweetie and I also was my first time for rodizio style meat service it sure was a winner!

We will be back because I know I will be dreaming about this place and be itching to get back really soon!

The best service ever in all of my dining experiences I swear! I told my boyfriend that I feel like a Queen totally treated like royalty in every way! They totally spoiled us with anything and everything, I am still Amazed and super happy with our experience.

5916635,2017-10-08,1,gO_z_5FQVHLCiJjOsfE1fg,This place is okay considering being a consistent customer to Brazilian steakhouses. Much rather spend it at FogoDe Chao than anywhere else here in town. Over this one and over Texas . Service is kinda boring here staff have no smiles no expressions on them. Just flat out boring. Meats okay kept getting burnt while asking medium well. Save your bucks for fogo they treat you better than anyone,SaCb2s1SnXuOgG6OCMLurQ,2,0,3,yTkApo0N8L7vAeffzNPpdg

Have always wanted to try Via Brasil Steakhouse, since it is so close to home, and with the Groupon promotion it was a no brainer.

Their self-serve salad bar is excellent.  The variety of food and the taste was outstanding, even though it is not the main reason for visiting Via Brasil, it was a nice treat and helps break up the all-meat-fest.

I enjoyed almost all the BBQ meats that was served by the waiter. But I really like the sausage, the lamb, chicken hearts (not on the menu, but you can ask for it, as it is one of the things served in this kind of restaurant in Brazil). I didn't care for the baked salmon, even though the passion fruit sauce that was served with it was good).  But you should definitely pace yourself and try everything and find out what you like and ask for more if you still have room in your tummy.

The servers were all very friendly as they make their round with whatever they bring out from the kitchen and identifying what it is so you don't have to guess. 

If you have room for dessert after your meal, they have a dessert cart to help visually entice you for some after meal sweets.  I tried their Coconut Flan, and thought it was good.  I liked the creamy richness and the coconut flavor.

As a nice restaurant in Summerlin, they probably should have more customers, but when I went they weren't too busy.  So making a same day reservation just hours ahead was not an issue for me.  I spoke to the manager and he told me they were getting more business with the Groupon promotion (and they just recently ran another Groupon offer) so the strategy is working.

Anyway, because of the awesome service from the waiter to the manger, and the good food I will definitely be back.  And having more Groupon to use will keep my tummy and wallet on my future visits. 

Decor: 5/5  The self-serve salad bar was nicely decorated and kept clean.  The restaurant was sophisticatedly (is that a word?) decorated.
Food: 4/5  Overall I am very pleased with it.  
Service:  5/5  Servers were friendly.  The manager that made the rounds and speaking to the guests was genuinely friendly.
Location:  Great for locals living in the SW, but will be too far of a trip if coming from the Strip via a cab.
Price: 4/5  Definitely take advantage of Groupon or other offers when available.
Ambiance: 5/5  Very classy and upscale, yet very relaxing as well.",RQlnSCjuqMnhR3Qk6j4KoA,3,1,5,8Dcs3gwgRa6q3hzVYv29gQ

Since then, every time I go to Vegas I MUST eat at Via Brazil. The Brazilian Barbecue is the best. They also have a huge and diverse salad buffet. For happy hour I definitely recommend the traditional caipirinha and the salgadinhos! It was delicious. Can't wait for my next visit to Vegas end of February.",l9NHoTsyR6Ue3ids6I-_NA,1,1,5,dswFX02TChcBcbOUWkPlFA

The food was amazing.  The meats kept coming and I didn't want to turn the card to red.  I tried about everything they had.  The salad bar and sides were also nice, offering great accompaniments to the meats.

For dessert we had the bananas flambe.  This was the BEST dessert I have ever had anywhere.  Trust me, you HAVE to get this at some point.  The presentation and taste of this is on a different level.

Overall, the people, atmosphere and food make this a place I want to go to again and again.  Also, I am anxious for the brunch which seems great",ilq8Zjr_YLbyL-AhMRReZQ,1,0,5,dctC2ob3mxDtKnJitUrONA
5948326,2015-06-01,0,gO_z_5FQVHLCiJjOsfE1fg,"We've been semi regulars at Via Brasil for about 5 years.  Everything has always been PERFECT. This visit was for my wife's 40th birthday; I told them why were coming when I made the reservation.  The restaurant was about half full when we arrived right on time for our reservation.  The hostess welcomed us, and wished my wife a happy birthday.  The service, as usual, was spot on.  The head waiter checked on us on a regular basis, making sure we had everything we wanted/needed.  The wait staff refilled our drinks without being asked to do so, and despite what others have said, the ""premium"" meats came by on a VERY regular basis.  The meal is definitely a splurge, but WELL WORTH IT!!!",myAlEECVOc5vOyFO_EIQKw,1,0,5,DUNgvp3uNfhriEdBWScjEg

Save up and come hungry I think you'll enjoy it.",OPSX06huwVlM40REfyiZrQ,0,0,5,5wMOR8yVVr1dcP_-s1F0bw
