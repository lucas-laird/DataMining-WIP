Their prices are definitely higher than most of the competition, but they do offer a discount on all to-go drinks.  And lets be real, some of the other tea houses in the area are just plain creepy.  The menu is extensive (over 10 pages of tea) and the atmosphere is nice.  This place is very clean- major bonus points, especially if you've frequented some of their local competition.  Tea Station is always packed, especially at night since they are open late.  My favs are their passion fruit green tea with boba, or the iced mixed fruit tea (although this one is super sweet).  My husband likes their fruit slushes.  This is a great place to get work done during the day (free wifi) or meet friends at night.  It is very popular for takeout drinks, in fact I always see 5-0 popping in here for their late night boba fix.  Service is reasonably friendly but definitely on the slow side, especially during busy times.  I would not recommend the food (their squid balls were inedible and smelled like a mixture of hot garbage and the ocean, though perhaps they are an acquired taste!).  I recommend this place based on their atmosphere, tea, and the fact that they are open late.  This is definitely more of a traditional tea house than your average take-out boba shop.",dEgO4_n8thLMbG1dKfFMHg,1,1,4,duvPONn-Lv2sK8m7nCqm_Q

We came in, were seated and ordered our food. Everything was fine and we were getting ready to order boba teas and out of nowhere our waitress forced us out of our table for a new party that had just walked in the door seconds prior. We were left standing with no where to go and still wanting to order more. I mean, really?! Who does that??

Whatever happened to first come first serve? That's apparently not a thing here and I am outraged that as a LONGTIME paying customer. We have continued to choose this place over all the others because of the fun atmosphere and great memories we have made there. But thank you to the random waitress with horrible people skills that ruined it for us.

If you want to get the best tea in Las Vegas, this is the place. I tried various teas and they were all good, but the tapioca milk tea is by far the best. If you order teas for to-go, you will get 15% off the price. One tapioca milk or milk green tea will be free when you've purchased 10 to-go drinks in total.

FOOD:
I don't care for their food. I've had lunch at this place a couple of times with different friends, but none of us liked any of the food.

SERVICE:
Not so impressive. If you want to chit-chat with your friends for a couple of hours, this place is good because they don't bother you at all. But if you need a regular attentive customer service, you almost always have to ask for service. Without knowing that, one time we had to wait for 15 minutes for a waitress to bring a check.

I ordered the Fried Squid Balls and the Tea Flavored Deluxe Taiwanese Angel Hair with Iced Green Tea. For desert I had the Mango Shaved Ice, (I was waffling between that and the Strawberry Shaved Ice).

The Squid Balls were easy to eat, I expected them to be a lot more chewy than they were, an excellent choice.

The Angle Hair soup had just enough spice to be flavorful with out burning your mouth, another excellent choice. 

The green tea was very good with a strong flavor of jasmine (I love jasmine tea). The large green tea is just right, not something you are going to guzzle down, you want to savor the flavor.

The Mango Shaved Ice is huge, large enough to share, admittedly it is mostly shaved ice; however, on a hot day like today, shaved ice is just the right desert. There are bite sized chunks of mango and cream on is dish. Next time I will be going after the Strawberry Shaved Ice.

Tea station is great, a tad pricey on some of the items but nothing horrible.

On the bright side the selections of tea's are very impressive. If you are feeling daring then try a rose milk tea (my personal favorite, I warn you it's an acquired taste) or a sweet fruit tea (with or without boba). Or if you want traditional, then theres always the milk tea, or jasmine. 

What's great is you can opt. out of having boba in your drink and theres always that hot or cold option.

The food (meals or snacks) are good (dumplings, takoyaki, and etc.) and the desserts are really awesome. (MUST TRY THE HONEY TOAST). 

My favorite part about Tea Station would have to be how it's like a nice café on the inside. If you want to sit down and hang out with a cup of hot/cold boba or maybe a plate of honey toast, nothing will feel rushed. 

Or if you're an 'on the go' type of person they have a convenient to go area. Although you still have to park and enter the café.",F6nqIdCn1AKJaZ_R3OAiKw,0,0,4,hlzZHRmR1dIpV1rWP4kGHg

Service, as everyone else on here seems to agree, is HORRIBLE!! I don't know why I even bother tipping (when eat in) anymore.  I usually tip a very small % because the service is THAT bad.  Now that I think about it, they charge over $6 for a large drink (!!!!) and add so much ice, I shouldn't have to tip.  If I ever go back and actually sit down to enjoy my drink, I will not be leaving a tip. 

And another thing that have intrigued me for a long time is that, every time we go get a beverage to go (I order the same thing every time), they charge me differently.  I don't get it.  How can the same drink be priced differently each time?  My boyfriend thinks it's because he's non-Asian and they think they can rip him off because he's white.  I don't know how true that is but it is quite strange, don't you think?",kjAuBSOpzK2LjMbQr5GzXQ,0,0,1,VeQ7SqNdUJz1cgyo5_7Xqg

She orded some type of strawberry dessert drink that smelled AMAZING! Unfortunately, they put too much strawberry syrup and also made too much of it. The attendant brought it to the table overflowing/spilling and acted like it was no big deal. Umm okay, I guess, we'll deal with it. I ordered a pot of passion fruit tea. It was super delicious!  I ordered the large, thinking the medium wouldn't be enough, but I was wrong. I couldn't even finish the large.  

The staff wasn't outright rude, but not the friendliest either. It's funny how they ignore you as if you don't exist, even when you're right in front of their face! You have to force engagement, even if it's as simple as requesting a minor item. But then again, it is China town and many establishments are a little biased (especially if you don't have someone of Asian descent with you). Sounds like I'm being biased too, but I speak from experience. And I'm not the only person who shares this opinion of China town. Which is why I don't voluntarily visit this area (that and sanitary reasons too).

Will I come back? Yes, but not voluntarily.  Should you visit? Sure, the passion fruit tea was yummy. Experience it for yourself and formulate your own opinion. It's worth a visit.",ka8Pk_MXUXNmPy9kPaO43w,0,0,3,OyAm7SgWrbGgaYK3NvTRnQ

Make sure you double check your order with whoever is taking it.

Honestly, I'm not much of tea drinker and the food on this menu was well out of my comfort zone, but I was looking to try new things.  Squid jerky was definetly a new thing to try.

It's been awhile since I'd eaten seafood, so the taste of the squid in my mouth took some getting used to...as well that it was jerky so I couldn't eat it quickly or swallow...the taste had to linger in my mouth for quite awhile.

This business is located just underneath the popular Ichiza sushi restaurant, our first choice for this evening, but with an hour wait, we chose to go to Tea Planet instead.  The smells were excellent when we walked in though I can't quite say what it was; it was quite sweet.  Many young adults or older kids were sitting around playing card games and drinking tea or consuming some type of rice-based food.  

The menu is primarily tea in many forms, from hot to cold, mixed and plain.  The food is almost an afterthought, yet what you get when you order something from the menu is a complete meal.  I ordered the squid jerky as an appetizer (or not, heh) for $4.00, my Spiced Pork Slices were $7.00 and came with sticky rice, onions and greens.  It was an interesting meal that I cannot say I totally enjoyed, but did not hate, either.

The tea was way too sweet but I could drink it.  My friends drink seemed a lot more enticing with boba and plum in her tea.  Next time I may want to try one of those instead.  The prices on the menu are all quite reasonable.

Randomly me and my fiance decided to go eat lunch at TS and as we were eating a Chinese woman comes in.  I'm not sure if something was wrong with her but she came into the store asking casually but a little loud if they are hiring.  One of the younger staff proceeded proceeded had to say no and once the lady left ALL of the staff started making fun of her in their language and you could kinda hint what they were talking about cause they were laughing saying ""Hello I'm. Chinese) blah blah blah""  and laughing forever about it.  Im not a fan of, behavior like that and find that disrespectful. Not just that but the service sucks. After being seated we wait forever just to get our drinks..  Or even be asked what we want.  Last time I was there I asked for water and my fiance asked for Thai tea and our food.  They came with everything but my water and didn't even care to notice.  I ordered pho,  the House phone with rice noodles. Most disgusting pho I ever had.

I appreciated finding this place after moving here from Hawaii where I had to leave my favorite tea place on earth (Tea Boss!). If you have tea blends that they don't offer, don't even try to ask if they could replicate a similar blend. They'll look at you confused like you're an alien and say ""No."" With a blank stare. 

FOOD: 1 star.  I usually come here after having dinner somewhere else nearby. The first and last time I order food- I had the peanut butter toast which to no exaggeration, burned my mouth, melted my fork and knife and was burned around the edges.  Obviously cooking is way too long and too high of a heat. I was disappointed and in obvious pain and confused as to why the heat was so high.  All I could ask was whyyyyyy, but when I wanted to ask someone about it, they were ignoring me.  The part that I did eat that wasn't burnt and I regained feeling in my mouth again, was okay- but I mean it's peanut butter on Asian toast. 

SERVICE: -10 stars. Customer service is nonexistent.  I feel it's just that the teens that work here are hella young, weren't trained, the establishment doesn't make customer service a priority anyway, and because English is obviously a second language, you may want to make extra extra sure that they understand what you're trying to order because I've seen several other patrons get stuff they didn't order because of miscommunication. Luckily for Tea Station, the patrons were accommodating and took whatever
they were given.

After waiting another 15+ minutes out comes the pork dish. He said ""the food quality is very important to us and I will give you this instead for free"". Throughout this whole process I just smile, shake my head and leave with a smile. I check my account the next day and see the transaction still processing, so I decided to check back the next day. The next day I see the transaction finalized there for the full amount. The short ribs cost more than the pork and I even tipped you $5 on a to go order. Don't say you're going to do something and not do it. Maybe instead of just caring about ""food quality"" work on customer service. Pork dish was mediocre at best let alone the rice being hard.

The rice has some ground pork on top. It didn't have much meaningful flavor. The tea flavored pork chop was the standout of the meal. Nicely fried, and resonating with flavor. Portion size is excellent for what they charge.

The milk tea was instantly forgettable. Might come back to try some of their more popular ones, like matcha ice cream milk tea.

Parking stinks, over-priced, and service/structure is confusing.  The only thing I think I like is the amount of seating space but if you are getting something to go, it's very frustrating because you don't have an area to wait.  People kept running into me and I was confuse to where to get my drink.  Had I not stand in front of the station where the servers picked up drinks, I would have never gotten my drink...and I had to ask if it was my drink.  The server looked very doubtful that it was my drink because I did not have a reciept for the drink.  I had to get the girl who took my drink to let him know it was my drink.  What was even funnier was that the staff that were making drinks were bad mouthing one of the customer about where he was standing while waiting for his drinks in Mandarin.  I don't believe the customer understood Mandarin bc what they were saying wasn't pleasant.  
It's not a bad place but if you have the patience to drive in circles around the building looking for a parking space, then this is the place for you...if you like having people running into you, either seated or standing waiting for your to go order drinks, this is the place...and if you like to over pay for a drink...ding ding ding, bingo, this is the place.

Popcorn chicken: 5 stars- this dish in comparison to other boba places is more expensive but the quality of this snack food is one of the best. If you're looking for popcorn chicken tea station does it right.

The food and service here is maybe just a little above average.  My table smelled like dirty washcloths.... Eww.  Tea Station is a franchise, and the other locations in the San Gabriel Valley area are better, overall.  The drinks at this location are pretty good though.  And you usually can't go wrong with the Sweet Butter Toast here - Yum!  Remember to ask for extra sweet butter!  :D  

RECOMMENDATIONS / TIPS:  Stay away from the Chicken Curry - it's definitely subpar (at least the one time I tried it here) - it's overcooked, looks (and tastes) like TV dinner food (or leftovers) - gross.  ALSO, come during lunch instead because their lunch specials include a reduced-priced milk-tea drink of your choice.   

DETAILS - DETAILS - DETAILS:
-----------------------------------------------
Atmosphere:
Even with just one dining area, there's hardly ever a wait.  People come here for some fast and authentic Taiwanese food and the atmosphere reflects that.  It's a no frills place that serves up drinks to-go and meals for those who want a place to sit when it's hot (summer) or freezing cold (winter) outside.  

Service:
Like most Chinese restaurants or eateries, my biggest complaint is when the food arrives.  If you have a party of 5 or more, don't count on eating at the same time, because they serve you the food as it comes out for your table.  And there always seems to be the one lagging entrée, appetizer, drink or dish that prevents me from having a completely satisfying meal.  The servers are sometimes ""shy"" and neglect to say ""hello"" or ""thank you.""

Food Quality / Selection:
The food here is just average.  Depending on what you order, you may get ""above average!""  LOL  The portions are generous enough for the ""Asian"" diet, but may not be enough for others, so consider ordering appetizers as well - perhaps the Sweet Butter Toast and Fried Tofu.   If you order their Dumplings, be prepared to have it be the last entrée served up because of the time it takes to steam them.   

Pricing/Value/Convenience:
Overall, I would say that this restaurant has a good value for simple, fast, authentic Chinese food in Las Vegas.   I find myself coming back every time I come to Vegas because of the value.  It's well priced and the food is comparable.  And although I think I will venture out to other restaurants in ""Chinatown"" in Vegas, I would probably return here for at least the milk-tea drinks, still probably the best in town.",p7t4IzmW66ctUauZeOKahg,0,0,2,JIp81-J3zAXk6Bej-qSMtA

So it compels me to say that they need to work on their customer service. Never have I ever been told by a server to take throw away my own trash before leaving the premises. I didn't bring my outside food, or drink or outside trash. I was a paying customer, drinking their drinks, using their own straws and leaving their straw wrappers on the table.

The boba is made wonderfully. Not too chewy and not too hard. Tea drinks are also legit. Just the right amount of bitterness with a hint of fruit. Shaved ice is alright. Not the best since the ice isn't really that smooth.. kind of chunky and sometimes they overload on the syrup and what not.

They do have some snacks which I guess are okay. The sweet toast is alright and so are the fried taro balls. Everything else is what you would find at other boba places like: french fries, fried chicken etc. They also have meals which are not the best in the world.  Wouldn't not come here for legit chinese food.

Let me ask you this; if a group orders a bunch of different drinks, wouldn't it be common sense to label the cups so that they know which is which? When we asked her which drinks were which, she took a ""guess"" and then told us ""why don't you just sip each cup and then you will know"" - I've never had anyone tell me that at a Tea Station and trust me, i've been to plenty. 

I will gladly donate a box of sharpies for them to write down the names if needed.

Four months ago my general attitude of this place was pretty much 'burn it down and build a new one' now it's 'hmm...didnt i use to hate this place? oh well...'

So yeah staff is MUCH more attentive to customers despite being full or being empty. 

They no longer have decks of playing cards available for loan nor a lot of places to plug in electronics for juice but the free wifi isnt too bad.

Been coming here enough to establish a few favorites:

Mixed Fruit Tea (hot/cold)
When it's served hot it could be a little on the sweet side, and the 'omg my mouth is burning but i dont want to spit because it kinda tastes good but holy crap this is causing me lots of pain' type of hot. A nice little perk is if you finish the tea you can open the little pot up and have at the pieces of fruit used to flavor your tea
Served cold with boba and you got yourself a treat. 

Ginger Logan Tea (hot)
Got it when i was feeling sick during the winter months. Very mellow soothing tea that tastes a bit like honeydew melon. Again you can open up the pot at eat the re-hydrated logans inside.

Instant Beef flavored Noodle with Egg and Ham
It's instant noodle with a fried egg and a slice of thin processed ham. It's 5.50. Who in the right mind would pay 5.50 for instant noodles with cheap enhancements. Normally i wouldnt but i cant identify what brand of instant noodle and the cheap enhancements just make it taste so damn good...Will keep ordering only to replenish my occasional craving for sodium.

Honorable Mentions:

Spicy Chicken Wings
Yeah 'spicy' is an understatement...Are they really spicy? if you're used to eating Korean food and sucking crawfish and shrimp heads at Hot&Juicy then no these wings are as spicy as a glass of milk. Still they're seasoned nicely and juicy on the inside while lightly crisp on the outside.

Been there, Yelp'ed it, Possibly Never Again:

Fried Wontons
Bland, Not a lot of flavor, nothing special

Teriyaki Chicken
Where to start...Chicken had grill marks but very little grilled flavor, also very little teriyaki flavor. The rice and the teriyaki sauce didnt go well together. The rice was too moist and instead of soak in to the sauce it just blanded the sauce up. Looked good in the picture but i'll grab the instant noodle next time

Tea flavored Japanese Style Ramen
Yeah...didnt taste like tea at all...Broth tasted heavily of pickled bamboo which also floats around in the soup. Priced higher and larger serving compared to the instant noodle with egg and ham but didnt tastes as good.

Spicy Fried Chicken
Another case where 'spicy' is an understatement. The pieces lack consistency. One will be big, meaty, and juicy on the inside, another will be too small and dried out but crunchy, and there's a bunch of others that float in the middle. The breading is a little to heavy and not seasoned enough.",7A7FOLZZKL0iokQVOAEbgA,1,1,4,Gw218sCJ53sUDr2cILEopg

Butter Toast and a side scoop of Vanilla Ice Cream: If you like Butter and Vanilla Ice Cream, then you might just find yourself a new habit!.. A fat slice of Toast that tasted like a sugar crusted bar of butter! The slice of toast came warm and with the cold ice cream.. 'Ahhh'.... (Kinda reminded me of the Lava Cake from Chart House or at Morton's..) Just melted in my mouth.. I felt pretty guilty eating this but it was worth the sugar fix or butter fix?! 

Watermelon Juice with Boba: I had a tough time choosing a drink since they had so many combinations to choose from. I noticed a chalkboard hanging on the wall with their special items written on it. I saw watermelon, I love watermelon, especially during the blazing summer heat! I thought it was the most refreshing choice, I just added boba. Fresh, tasted like sticking a straw into an actual watermelon! and the boba itself had the right chew and sweetness. A nice choice to cool yourself down!

The time of day i was there was not busy at all but the employees seems pre occupied with each other. Its quicker to walk to the counter and order what you want then it is to sit and wait for them to take your order it seems. Other than that the food and drinks are awesome. I tried the yogurt green tea with boba and it was interesting and good! Not something ive ever found back home in hawaii. I think this place would do well in hawaii. The tea chicken katsu was another interesting thing but def good and somethingi havnt heard of.

The inside is gleaming, very modern-esque with tables and booths on the floor, tea and sets availble.  Tea Station is actually a chain with this being the only one in Vegas.  

Onto the tea! 

So I like the milk teas a lot.  They're not SUPER sweet but they're rich, tasteful and I enjoy it without the actual ""boba"" in it.  The syrup teas are all very sugary and sweet so if it's your first time, I recommend an almond tea with a few boba so you can try it.   I would try around at different tea houses on Spring Mountain because one or two of them actually made them with fresh ingredients and not artificial syrups.  

They also have tea flavored snacks and hot treats such as the soups and takoyaki (WOOOO TAKOYAKI!).  Beware, takoyaki is HOT in the center even if the exterior seems cool.  The fried Tofu is also nom nom nom, but remember: this place is meant for snacks and comfort food.  Go get a meal elsewhere but having a quick bite here is more appropriate.

You can take your Boba tea to go for a discounted price as well.

I do not find the night crew to be anywhere near on par with the day crew.  The day staff is pleasant, talkative, and cheerful.

Boba is ""slimy, yet satisfying"" -- (c) Timon, Disney's Lion King.

First off, I'll warn you that parking is the biggest problem. When a place gets real popular, parking is always a battle! Parking tip: Right next to Tea Station, behind the east side wall, is Harbor Palace (stay tunes for a review!), is some parking and you can walk right on over to Tea Station no problem! Once you've won the battle of parking, you'll walk in and often times, especially after 8pm, the tables are taken and crowded-- exactly what happens when I wear skinny jeans: TIGHT! They offer a discount of 30% off when you take your drinks to go (good business move and idea!) so take advantage of it if you don't have a party to entertain. Take your drinks and take a stroll on the strip that isn't too far away from Tea Station. If you decide to ignore the 30% discount and stay, grab a deck of cards to entertain yourself while the Asian ""baristas"" throw your drink together.

I came here a few times and a few bad experiences with the service. The waiter tends to get your order wrong if you don't explain clearly what you want or point to the menu.  Should I fail this place in my book if I've grown numb to the bad service I get here sometimes? I'm not the only who's said the same thing, but then again the drinks are the best boba drinks I've tasted here in Las Vegas. Sigh... What a love/hate relationship! What am I talking about again?! Oh yes, Tea Station! Here's a list of my favorite drinks and dishes served! Stick with this list (that will keep growing) and you can't go wrong! Try:

*fried taro balls
*hot taro milk tea
*hot honey black tea
*honeydew ice with rainbow jelly
*pork chops and rice!

Note: Taro is like the potato of the tropics. It has a starchy consistency with a different distinct flavor. Trust me! You'll like it.

My review of this place is long overdue after countless times of going here.  Honestly, I think the only reason I'm not giving them 2-stars is because the cafe serves its purpose; you get in, sit, get your tea (or if you're craving for street food, by all means, have at it), and then you get out.

It's very convenient to get your drink to go, and they give somewhat prompt service.  But their service when it comes to sit-in is horrendous.

Along with the trash-talking in Mandarin about customers, they're pretty deficient on the hospitality department.

Short story- one time I went there and our bill came to around $15.  We gave her $25 since we had big bills.  It does NOT make sense to keep the change.  $10 tip?  Are you kidding me?  We had to ask her for the change and when she gave it to us, it was short a couple dollars and cents.  We left no tip.

(Just so you know me a bit better, I tend not to tip ONLY if the service is ridiculous.  I've never NOT given any tip because of bad food, that's something we risk as customers.  But in a city where the tip percentage is among the highest in the nation, I believe that the tip should be a reflection of the establishment's hospitality.

I got the Pork Stew with Rice. The flavor was somewhat bland, and it had way more pork fat than meat itself. This reminded me of an extreme knockoff version of the Vietnamese dish ""Thit Kho"" (Vietnamese Braised Pork and Eggs).

My friend got the tea-flavored Chicken Teriyaki. It was super salty, just like my friend's feelings after spending $9+ for it! 

Matcha Milk Tea with Ice Cream: Got it because of the hype. Very light matcha flavor. 

Royal Milk Tea with Boba: Rich and had a lot of flavor. Boba was soft. Would recommend. 

Overall, the food plates were definitely not worth $9+; we could have spent those elsewhere. In addition to the iffy food, service was not up to par as well. We did not have any silverware once we got our food, so we had to get the attention of a different waiter.

the mango snow ice is also very good. nice at tangy. made from fresh fruit of course!

the spiced fried chicken, (is not spicy), its pretty good, its seasoned well and has a nice crunch, nice small size, and cheap snack.

the pork chop fried rice was pretty good. i think the one place i like better than here is sinbala in so cal, but its pretty good here. 

portion size is pretty good. you get rice with ground pork on top, a big piece of deep fried pork chop (seasoned well), pickled cabbage, egg, and this other cabbage type thing. nice and filling. 

i also had the green dumplings, very cute presentation of green and white skinned dumplings, they taste the same (whether its green or white).

the hot teas are brought to you in a clear glass tea kettle on a tray. all the other boba drinks come to you in huge glass glasses (think like those beer glasses w/ handle, if you get the large size).

service was good, the girls working there are cute and nice.

i've been going to tea station for years now.....from l.a. to vegas.
i've always liked them, the food is decent and the boba is good.
i never had a problem with this location until recently.

i had some friends in town.
after dinner one night, we all decided to get some boba and tea station was the obvious choice at midnight.
there were about 8 of us so when we walked in we needed to put 2 tables together.
we looked over at the 5 employees standing by the counter doing nothing and noticed a young girl named, ling ling, staring at us.
so, we kindly asked if it was ok to put the tables together and she shrugged her shoulders and looked at us with complete disgust.
no matter, we put the tables together and sat down.

then, ling ling came to our table and stood there with pen in hand waiting for us to order without uttering a single word.
we ordered a bunch of stuff for the entire table including each person's individual drink order.
it just so happened that someone in our party wasn't very familiar with boba drinks so had a few questions.
unfortunately, ling ling wasn't having it that night.
she began to raise her voice and became increasingly agitated.
our questions confused her and she didn't know the answer to any of them.
that's really not our fault, is it?
you work there...you should be able to answer simple questions about the products you offer.
she had to call over another server to help and even he had no clue what he was doing.
blind leading the blind.

so, we finally get our stuff.
as i prepare to dig in, the napkin i so carefully placed on my lap fell onto the floor.
i reach down to grab it and what do i see but a lovely cockroach eying me.
GROSS!!!
look, i know vegas has a cockroach problem.
i get it.
but, c'mon, hire a f'n exterminator!
geebus cripes!!!
clearly, i lost my appetite.
i proceeded to inform someone that their little pet escaped from its cage and nobody cared.

we ordered a few shaved ice dishes for the table and with 8 people, there's never enough condensed milk.
we tried to get someone's attention but everyone was ignoring us as they stood around doing nothing so i walked up to the 5 of them and asked for ""condensed milk"".
ling ling looked at me and said, ""what?""
so i repeated myself, ""we'd like more condensed milk please"".
she looked at me with such confusion so i looked to someone else standing around and repeated myself again hoping that someone would understand what i was saying.
finally, someone translated my request to her.
she then turned to me and yelled, ""IT'S CALLED SWEET MILK!""
so i calmly said to her, ""no, honey, it's actually called condensed milk but i'm not going to sit here and argue with you.  just bring it to our table and check your attitude before you do so.  you, my dear, are SO RUDE!""
obviously, they sent someone else to our table with the condensed milk.

we finished, paid and left.
no tip.

what's funny is that my friend is good friends with the owner of the franchise.
she's notified them of the problems at this location.
apparently they are well aware of the issues as they peruse yelp frequently.
unfortunately, they have yet to do anything to fix it.

i will never, ever, ever go back to tea station again and would not recommend them to anyone.

However, I'm not too sure what happened but in my most recent trip to Vegas, we were so excited to get our milk tea. I told my friends about this place so they were all excited to give it a try. As soon as we got up to the door, the workers opened it and started bringing their tables and chairs outside, we weren't even greeted or told politely when the store would open. The worker just blatantly and rudely told us that they are closed. Since we wanted the milk tea so bad, we waited outside in our car until they opened at 11am. Let's just say... my friends weren't satisfied.

The man who was working was very rude and giving us attitude (not too sure if it was on purpose or if that was just his fob accent). Their milk tea was extremely sweet. We all drank less than 1/3 of our drinks and thew it away.

The boba is a little pricier than other cafes around the area, but they're served in large glass mugs instead of plastic cups, which is nice. I believe a mug of boba milk tea was $5. 

They also have a full menu of food options, including both snacks and full meals. The food pricing is very reasonable and most entrees are around $8-$12. I had the tea flavored pork stew which surprisingly was a much larger portion than I had imagined. The pork was served with a tea egg, bowl of rice, soup and some pickled veggies. The pork was well marinated and the fat was soft and chewy. Overall it was good.

My main issue was this place is the lack of service.

My friend is convinced they are back to their old ways but I disagree - I think it was an honest mistake. They caught the error an fixed it before we left. ""But it's the principle!"" Yeah, yeah whatever.

Even when their service was bad this was still a solid, staple boba place in my life since I was in high school.

However, the majority of the boba places in Vegas close around 9 and Tea Station was the only place that was opened, so we flocked there.

THE DETAILS: Located around China Town I believe. It was really easy to find and so was parking. The shop was pretty narrow, but there was quite a lot of seating area. The decor was standard, nothing special stood out to me. There was a wall with lots of tea displayed that caught my attention though. It's open later than the rest of the other boba places, so that's a plus. The workers are friendly. The prices for the drinks are overpriced to me. $10 for two drinks. 

THE DRINK: I didn't want to drink anything heavy like milk tea, so I ordered something on the lighter side.

--Iced Chrysanthemum tea: Okay, so this might be my fault because I asked for Chrysanthemum tea without sweetener, so it was very, very bitter. I'm used to the bitter taste of tea and I actually enjoy it, but this tea was so bad. I've had unsweetened chrysanthemum tea before and it did not taste like what I received from here. I still drank it because it was refreshing nonetheless, but it wasn't as good as I thought it would be.

THE END? I took a sip of my friend's regular milk tea and I thought it was alright; I probably wouldn't return though. Unless of course, I'm with my mom, it's 11 at night, and I'm not at the club.",4th-MvaVtul61irYo6wrVQ,0,0,2,4VsbWXHGEy1O0RVe98uo3g

A story: My bf were doubling dating with my sis and her bf. After dinner, we decided to come here. Everyone was stuffed, so my sister and I each ordered hot tea. We just wanted to relax and talk. The place was not busy at all. There were many open tables. The guy serving us said that if we wanted to dine in, each of us had to order something that was 4 dollars or more!! Seriously?! What kind of policy is that?? I go to this place so much and have never heard of such a thing. Long story short, we ended up ordering more things because I wanted the tea! lol But he was very rude to us after I tried telling him I never heard of  that rule before.

My friend's and I decided to get boba after having pho nearby. We all frequent different boba places pretty often, and had been to Tea Station before. 
We walked in to no greeting, which is normal, and went up to order to-go. After flipping through the menu briefly, we settled on a small and large Thai tea, a slush, and fried taro balls. Total came out to $23....or did it? 
The server brought out the Thai teas, then the slush shortly thereafter. After waiting another 10 minutes and the fried taro balls not showing up, we finally asked the server how long it would be until they did. He responded with, ""I put taro balls in your boba. Not fried taro balls."" I explained that it was supposed to be the fried taro ball food item and not an add on into the drink. You would think that's a simple misunderstanding that can be taken care of, right? WRONG. When I told him it should have been the fried taro he answered back extremely matter-of-factly, ""well did you SAY, ""FRIED"" taro ball? I don't THINK so..."" now... this isn't my first rodeo. I know the difference between fried taro balls and taro added into your drink. Knowing I for sure asked for FRIED taro balls, I didn't want to make a big deal out of it, so told him he must not have understood, and we could just get the fried taro balls since I had already been charged for them. He said I had not been charged. I told him my total was $23, so I had to have been charged for them. Apparently not because he started naming the prices of our drinks. $7.51 FOR A LARGE THAI TEA. $6 SOMETHING FOR A SMALL. WHAT?! I have NEVER been charged that much for Thai tea anywhere, ever. Even when I know for a fact it's been brewed properly and not just some powder. You can get alcoholic drinks on the strip for less than that! 
Anyway... he had a smug look on his face as soon as we told him about the fried taro balls, or a lack thereof, as if to say, ""gotcha!""

As for the attitude - I place my order and as he's taking it down, for one of the drinks, I state ""no Boba"" which he confirms and even crosses out on his order pad.

Luckily, I don't speak the language he spoke with the person who made the order because I'm sure it wasn't polite with regards to me - but as long as they didn't spit (or worse) in my drink, I'm good.

Drinks/Boba: (average / above average compared to the majority of boba shops I've tried in Vegas. The boba is always cooked properly, plus, the boba doesn't taste like dishwater!! Yay) 

1. Ma cha ice cream green milk tea (whew that's a long one) is the bizzness!! Cold, creamy perfection for 100 degree Vegas summer nights. It was my favorite and I slurped it down quick. Flavor rating: 5/5

2. Thai iced tea with boba - not exactly an authentic thai iced tea, but it had a nice and light thai tea flavor. It was sweet, but not over bearing. Flavor rating: 3/5

3. Coconut Milk Tea with boba - I really enjoyed the refreshing and light coconut flavor, plus It wasn't overly sweet. It's one of my favorite dessert drinks after dinner because it's not too heavy or filling. Flavor rating: 5/5

4. Iced Honey Green Tea - the tea flavor wasn't too strong or bold like I typically prefer, but the overall flavor was refreshing and enjoyable. They were also light handed with the honey, so it was not too sweet. I would probably ask them to add more honey next time and adjust it to my taste. Flavor rating: 3/5

The best thing is that you can adjust the sweetness of all of your drinks. You can have them make your drink with more or less sweetness when you place your order.",u_wqt9RshdZsoj8ikLqoEQ,13,12,4,6vUsIlYx8HR6yuPFRBy7FA

It has lot of pieces of strawberries and apples, and its nice and sweet in a fruity sort of way.  The smoothie version, which I think is better, reminds me of Tropical Smoothie or Jamba Juice, but better!  

The service is always awesome here.  The girls are friendly and always willing to help you make a decision (the menu is huge!).  I haven't had the food, but there are quite a few dishes here that at least look yummy, particularly the soups.

But I got no greetings or anything. The people who worked there just kinda stared at me and noticed my existence but didn't approach me or anything. There was about 2 workers, I wanna say. One of them was helping other customers and the other one was kinda wandering off or something. Anyhow, I just stood there and then kinda looked through the menu, but I felt rude doing that so I stopped and just waited until they greeted me.

She put a menu in front of me and just said, ""ok let me know when you're ready.""
Because the customer service was already ehh, I already didn't wanna order something, but I decided to anyways. Seconds later, she came back and I told her my order which was Thai tea with boba and while she put in my order, she rudely asked what size I wanted and I didn't hear her, so she repeated herself and I was like, ""I guess a medium?"" I didn't know how big or small their drinks are... Gosh, then I went to pay and she was like, ""you're paying in cash right?"" And I said, ""no, I only have debit. Sorry. I don't have cash on me.""

I was just, I didn't know what to do, so I said that it was fine, I don't have to buy it, it's ok. Then she said, ""it's $5 and (something) cents,"" grabbed my card, and said to me in such a rudely manner, ""I will only do this for you once, but not again, not next time."" Pleeease! There will be no next time. Oh gosh and then literally her and her coworker started speaking another language, and I can clearly tell they were talking about me... -_- They were completely looking at me and just talking out loud obnoxiously.

  It's been quite some time since I last visited Tea Station.  So long in fact that I got the name wrong while I was looking for it on Yelp to review.  Tea Planet is what I typed out for some reason.  Any who...

Pros:
  Pretty good selection of flavors. 
  Chill ambiance
  Quick service
  Outdoor seating
  Friendly crowds
  Open late

Cons:
  Parking sucks. (Chinatown..what do you expect)
  If you hate the smell of smoke, don't sit outside... It's smoker's delight.
  Did I mention Parking sucks?

Verdict:
  A pretty chill place.  It seems like they are always busy.  I went here after dining at Kaya Sushi for some milk tea with some out-of-towners.  I really liked the ambiance  Everyone there (staff and customers included) seemed to have a very down-to-earth attitude.  Sitting outside at night, I was able to enjoy the nice breeze coupled with the warm temperature... perfect during this time of year.  They are open late too, so if you are looking for some late night tea, don't rule out this place.

Tips:
  If you are struggling to find parking.  Just post in one spot.  People are always leaving.  Nevertheless, the parking situation is a hassle.
  This place doesn't close til 2 am (at least the night I was there).  The crowd is pretty loud.  Lots of younger people.  It was a fun night.

Before I start my review- the customer service here is different. It's not a typical american style waiting. You'll need to wave down an employee if you need something after you've ordered. Its really easy, just make eye-contact and use a hand motion to bring them over. WOW! Crazy how that works, right? Otherwise they don't want to bother their customers too much by asking if they need anything while they're busy eating or talking.

Anyways~ To the review.
The tea here is always pretty dope, I LOVE their lavender milk tea, fell in love with it my first day. They have good food, its not super gourmet or anything- keep in mind they specialize in TEA and this is a social spot. I love the squid jerky here, and they have some good takoyaki too. Let it cool for a minute or so when they set it on your table. They can be hot. I also like their Tea-boiled eggs and their fried chicken. I haven't had a chance to try their noodles yet, so no comment on those. Bathrooms are decent.

I really wasn't fond of the hot taro milk tea at all. It was ridiculously sweet. I felt like I gained 10 pounds just drinking it and it left a horrible after taste. I wouldn't get it again. I did like Donald's iced lavender tea though. It was refreshing and had a wonderful floral taste. If I ever come back, I'll probably stick to tea without milk because they seem to overdo it on the powder and sugar.",AuvaQaRHBowFaFtoEMqkVg,0,0,3,dK1cKtLVNW_xhpYYVwfgtg

For those who are unfamiliar with Tea Station...it is famous chain of taiwanese drinks and snacks. My friends and I already had lunch at the plaza's Anime Ramen so we were too full to try any of their food; however, we still left room for some aromatic milk teas.

I ordered a hot wintermelon tea (without pearls)! 1) because I was curious as to how a vegetable tea would taste like and 2) my friend highly recommended it. It was absolutely DELICIOUS and I must say,  I am hooked! I've always noticed that it is only available in authentic specialty chinese tea cafes, so it is relatively hard to find in franchises like quickly's, q-cup and tapioca express. I'm sure their other drinks (hot and cold) are just as good. For those of you who have never experienced it before, I think it is worth trying, because its flavor is very unique and deep.

And it seems like that's the case for most people here too. I've also come several times just to pick up an order I've called in or to wait while my car is being fixed up the street. 

I've been to Kung Fu Tea, Volcano Tea, and even the one in the Chinatown Mall on the first floor (forgot their name sorry!) And I always come back to Tea Station because of the large seating area, bright lighting inside, not smelling overly like fried foods, and the overall variety of food and drinks they have here. Oh and an important thing, I like the texture of the boba here the best! I wish they offered small boba though :( Where in Vegas is small boba?? 

Let's talk about service. It doesn't exactly exist, as most places in Chinatown. I would normally take off a star for how amazing they seem to be at hiding but I'm a little slack on the Chinatown places, so 4 stars it is just for the atmosphere, snacks and drinks.

The go-to drinks (I always get them with boba): 
-Current favorites:  Hot Black Passion Tea & Rose Milk Tea 
-Hot Lavender Milk Tea 
-Mango/Coconut/Lychee Slush 
-Strawberry Pudding 

The go-to snacks:
-Takoyaki (Octopus Balls)
-Taiwanese Sausage 
-Fried Spicy Chicken
All three of these are salty and flavorful. Ultimate junky snack food lol 
& I seriously hate Honey Toast in general cause it's just a huge block of bread with honey and butter butttt it smells good, and the friends all love it here, so you may want to try it.
Also, if you love sweet stuff and Mango, get their Mango shaved ice when it's in season. The Mango is so soft and juicy and sweet and they aren't stingy with the Mango either!

Some tips:
-Feel free to adjust the sweetness! They normally come pretty sweet so if you like less sweetness,  just tell them less sweet.
-Always bring cash! You have to spend $10 minimum  to use card.
-If you need assistance, don't be shy, flag someone down. They won't come to you otherwise lol 
-If you like Hot drinks, order the large and it comes in this gigantic cute bowl that's easily sharable for 2 people.

However, what disgusted me was my mom's drink. She ordered the passion fruit slushy with boba, but the boba turned hard and light brown because the drink was so cold. I suggest you to not order boba with a cold drink as the boba will turn hard very quickly.
There is wifi, but it's very difficult to connect to it because it's so weak. The employees are friendly, but take a while to get their attention to order something.

This place is also good when you're in the mood for tea and free wi-fi. It's true that their prices are higher than your average tea/boba shop, but spending a few more dollars to get a tasty drink along with free wi-fi is worth it. 

Their menu features an extensive collection of tea and other drinks, along with tea-inspired appetizers and dishes such as tea-infused eel and tea-flavored noodle soup. They also have shaved ice desserts that look perfect for a hot summer day. I want to come back to try one of the Hot Healthy Drinks because they look so darn healthy (not to mention the serving bowl looks cool). 

After reviewing the menu, I opted for the Iced Honey Green Tea on my most recent visit. My first initial sip left me disappointed- the tea was way too sweet- but after drinking more of it, I began to like it more. I've also tried the Iced Hibiscus Spice Tea- a pretty red colored tea that is lemony yet sweet- and the Iced Barley Powder Milk Tea w/ boba (I like the taste of the barley milk tea, but I prefer Volcano Tea's boba). Their hot teas are good as well. On one visit, I tried the Fried Spicy Chicken (located on the Tea Snacks page), which was pretty tasty.

Sometimes they are understaffed, but I prefer to go in the daytime when it's not too busy because parking can get pretty terrible. There's also the option of getting a couple drinks to go. If you come with a group, they do expect most of your group to buy something. I also believe there is a $10 credit card minimum (before tip), so if you don't plan on spending that much be sure to bring cash. This place is also fairly overpriced for both food and drinks. We've tried a couple of the small food dishes, but I don't believe they are worth the price you pay.

Regardless of all this, we've returned time and time again because they do make great drinks! I've been to multiple similar restaurants and have not found many that make perfectly flavorful and frothy Thai Tea as the one I buy at Tea Station. I've also tried at least 15 different drinks here (iced tea, hot tea, snow ice, etc.) and have yet to feel disappointed.

So in summary, I would suggest that you only come here for drinks and try your best to avoid busy hours. But I really don't think this place is as bad as many of these reviews make it out to be. As a side note, I've actually been to a Tea Station in California where the restaurant had a much better setup and improved customer service.

Our order was taken in a standard fashion with no line at the register, I ordered a milk tea with boba minus ice (the most standard or drinks) and a passionfruit green tea half sugar. 

20 MINUTES LATER, the entire place was packed (with annoyed Asians) due to the lack of drink production, and we finally received the passion fruit green tea. Why we stayed that long in the first place is a mystery, possibly attributed to my catching up on Scramble with Friends games. While asking for a status update on the drinks the employees merely noted they were coming, even though they were not.

We waited another ten minutes and my milk tea was finally produced. We left in an angered hurry at this point and once out the door I noticed that my large milk tea had but ten boba balls or so.

But then again, you might not want to sit down because it'll take them forever to come to your table. And then when you come to your table they're really rude. I always feel rushed to order. They don't explain things well. 

I'm not the one to complain. I have a lot of patience. Takes a lot to put me over the edge. Kudos to you, Tea Station. You have done just that.",1EvZSNmhYmyPIElblCeMdA,1,1,1,3eqFdGAP9WpRf97n891V9g

I came by here before driving back to LA for a drink to take for the road.  They had a ""monthly promo"" special, which was $3.50 for iced milk tea or iced green milk tea with boba (medium size).

I told the girl that I wanted just the green milk tea WITHOUT boba and she told me it was going to be more expensive.  I asked her how much and it was $.50 more without boba.  That didn't make any sense to me.  Why in hell would it be more expensive for more tea? I would figure boba would be more expensive than having another 25% more tea in my cup.  I know tea, milk and sugar is NOT that expensive.  The company needs to rethink that out before telling customers that.  It's just plain retarded.

I caved in and just got the monthly special but I wasn't too happy about it.  I usually don't care for the boba and just want some milk tea to drink.  I would go back but only if I really craving some decent milk tea in the area.",OyuZfwvIJWeOvgB7LzzIYw,1,0,2,dE6tNb8MkeOYuM6nG21sYg

Plum sweet potato fries - cooked perfectly and tasted buttery and amazing, I didn't think I'd like the weird pink plum powder, (say that shit 3 times fast! Fuckin A.) But it was actually pretty good.

Beef ramen - my bf had a mind shattering life changing experience when I pointed out that there was tongue in it...but other than that he enjoyed the broth and noodles.

Pro:

-It is open late as... I don't even know maybe 3am? 
-Offers extensive choices of beverages and limited entrees
-Board games and cards are present
-Orders usually come out pretty quick

Con: 

-$$$ (i.e. $5.75 for a large iced (insert flavor) tea that is 1/2 ice... ice cold man)
-Service is really inconsistent, sometimes its okay, and sometimes you'll probably hate them
- Parking here sucks. I recommend parking at the Chinatown plaza next door and walking over. 
- Skip the food, you'll thank me.
- Doesn't really promote social loitering. Must spend x amount per x length of stay

- Don't come here with intentions of studying, it won't happen.

You come in, and you expect it to be a very fun place to go. I'm just glad that it stays away from creating an internet cafe concept, with less computers, and more social engagement. The way the place is decorated, and the furniture settings really invite that social atmosphere. Expect to see many customers playing cards, chess, checkers, or laughing and talking over boba or tea.

Another great thing is that they offer free wifi. A perfect place to for a study group or even to do homework or papers on your own. If you want a place to study that provides choices either than coffees or lattes. I'd say this would be that place.

My personal favorite is their Taro Boba. I've gone to many boba places and their Taro Boba just never tastes the way Tea Station's does. It just never compares. Tea Station's Taro Boba is just so smooth and rich with that Taro flavor. I would usually grab a small snack to go with my drink, and expect it to either be the squid balls or the sweet buttered toast. 

Sweet buttered toast is fluffy, sweet, and light. Expect it to be filling, but the simple concoction of this treat is such an ingenious concept! Toast with sugar and butter? It's amazing.

If you want a more meaty and salty snack. Definitely the squid balls if you're adventurous and down for the seafood snacks! Its tasy with that seafood flavor, but eat expecting that it might be imitation seafood or artificial seafood because the texture sort of feels that way.

You and I were pretty good friends when we started to get to know each other, but then like an abusive ex gf, you started showing your bad points really quickly. I have been going to this place for months but after sampling other boba tea places around the area, I now know there are better places where customers are actually treated with respect. Why do I have to bring up respect when talking about a cafe? Because it has all to do with service. Or lack thereof in this case. 

There are two wait staff members here, a boy and a girl, who always seem to be giving not only me but other customers a hard time when ordering drinks. I even experimented different ways to order drinks (Pointing to the drinks on the drink counter, speaking slowly and enunciating each word, learning Taiwanese (Okay, maybe not the last one but I might as well have)) to lower the aggravation or pissy meter off of these wait staff members. Nothing works. They will often get annoyed or angry that you can't get your order right the first time. I have worked front of the house in cafes before larger than this establishment and I have not once showed signs the level of discontent or disrespect these guys show. It's gotten from me being embarrassed thinking I made a mistake to being embarrassed that they don't know how to do customer service. Probably the only constructive criticism I can say is to retrain these two wait members or get a touch screen so you can punch in your own orders to save time, money, and customers. 

But enough of the bad, the good is that their drinks are consistently good and there are some very good helpful members of their team like the older pudgy guy who usually mixes the drinks or the young short girl who always seem happy to have a job.

I would give this place one star if it wasn't for the consistency of their food and drinks. Remember, people will go out to eat at places with good food and drink but they will only comeback if there is good service to match.

My advice? Why take the abuse? Try Volcano Tea House or Fresh Cup down the street. At least they won't chastise you for messing up your order or nag you on it.",2_v3cWaTjauIeQH2bOWa2A,0,0,2,rRlXAC7BEp7p9tlNPtxpcA

The service is kind of hit-or-miss with how friendly and attentive your server is. Sometimes they're quick to take your order and bring you your item, other times you have to call the server over before you can place your order, especially if they're busy. The place is usually pretty steady in its number of patrons per night; on a weeknight, the place is 70-80% full, and on weekends, sometimes groups have to hang out for a bit outside before being able to find a place to sit.

Some of the most popular items are the shaved ice, the snow ice (taro, or purple yam, is my favorite), and the regular boba milk tea. They're pretty quick to get them out to you too, especially if they have more than one person making the drinks.

Their food isn't bad; we usually stick to the appetizer items so that the group can each try some of everything. I've had their eel on rice before, as well as their marinated chicken, but they're nothing too spectacular. I would suggest eating somewhere else and then coming to Tea Station to hang out afterwards, rather than eating here.

One last thing: Bring cash; it's easier. There's a minimum $10 charge for cards, so save yourself the issues.",Tc5A5a5fDpPt8stps6cAHQ,1,1,4,i6hZ4A2_lDm5xDlkSTowUg

I swear the menu is larger than the Cheesecake Factory's.  They must have every possible permutation of tea or boba drink at this joint.  Unfortunately, I never really venture past the tried and true here.  Perhaps it's because I have no idea what some of those things are (what exactly is grassy jelly?)  Too bad, because I could come here every day for months and never have the same drink twice.  

My favorite is the plain old iced honey green tea.  It's never too sweet and it's always got that nice stiff green tea flavor with tannins to boot.  I could probably live off this stuff.

I do love to come here and hang out.  On my most recent visit, a friend and I plopped ourselves in a booth, ordered a couple drinks and chatted.  No one even so much as bothered us and if we wanted something, we just waved someone down.  They did eventually ask us to pay, rather than just dropping a check off, which kind of surprised me until I realized it was past 3am.  We had been there for 5 hours and never felt any pressure to leave that whole time.

One of these days I will have to order a desert.  Some of those concoctions look pretty tasty.  Oh, now which one?",9aHS1o9JVm04buXN9PgE4Q,2,2,4,OXRGdOSyrwMcHaUcalHIkw

One major reason that this is not my go-to boba spot is because of their bad service. It's completely lacking here. Non-existent. Zero. Personally, I feel a good service makes the experience better. 

My typical visit here usually starts out with me walking in, getting ignored for 5-10 mins,  then when lucky enough to make eye contact with one of the worker, they come up to me with death glare and ask ""what you want""

Another reason why I don't come here too often is because of its inconvenient location and price. This plaza consist of some good eatery meaning it's hard to find a parking space especially at night. It's also close to the strip = lots of tourists + overpriced. Getting some boba drink and light snacks, you are looking at about $20 easily. 

On a brighter note, their drinks are decent in my opinion. I have tried a couple of drinks and my favorites are their rose milk tea (one of the most popular drinks here) and jasmine milk tea. Teas are aromatic and leaves a slight bitterness after each sip which I enjoy. Drinks are on the sweeter side but does get better as ice melts and dilutes the sweetness.

I also like how they are open late. Late night boba craving is real sometimes so I appreciate that they are open past 11pm on week days. Tea Station is not my #1 spot for boba but I will visit once in a while.",mEzc6LeTNiQgIVsq3poMbg,7,5,2,gDBakGbJmqVjYctviCt_Cg

The menu hasn't changed much since.  But everything on the menu is delicious.  I like the strawberry ice dish.  The red bean ice dish is common as I see it get thrown from the kitchen and onto customers tables constantly.

Don't expect a full dining experience.  They certainly do have dishes to satisfy an appetite but we always come here just to snack and drink.  I always try something new (with boba) and they all come out delicious.  

Back in the day, you could have hours of conversation and they would never pressure you to ""go on and get the hell out of here"".  And to this day, they still don't.  We would play cards or whatever on the tables and they were completely fine with it.  The place is always clean, and it should be because tables and seats fill up fast!

When it comes to paying, beware that you need to at least purchase $10 in order to use your card.  If you bought 1 drink w/boba, it won't hurt to buy 2 more and give me both.  =D",k4M43lXJuQMpQW65DTqzIQ,0,0,4,WBES9d1K42cpVn6n7sem6Q

Every time we drive by here on Spring Mountain there is a constant flux of folks in and out of Tea Station.  Like, always busy!  We had been there once before a long time ago and I think we bought a boba or 2.  This time around we decided to have dinner here with some family from out of town.  

When we came in, tables were fairly full but we managed to find an open spot with hardly any wait.  From the looks of it most of the patrons were just getting drinks, only some were getting food.  Was that a sign?  Ehhh.....

The menu is pretty (of course) so most everything looks appetizing.  Getting the food?  I hate to say, their presentation could use some sprucing up.  Some of the food items we ordered:

*Tea Flavored Dumplings
*Fried Wontons
*Tea Flavored Spiced Pork Chop
*Tea Flavored Marinated Chicken
*Tea Flavored Beef Stew (house specialty - forgot a picture)

The Tea Flavored Dumplings were good, lots of hot liquid inside and yep...tastes of tea.  Fried Wontons were pretty standard.  My major gripe was with the entrees.  They all very much looked the same...all very...bleh.  Like so plain!  You kinda eat with your eyes first and what I got at first was we all had the same dish.  

My daughter (or my niece, I can't remember) had the Tea Flavored Beef Stew and said it was actually very good - rich sauce, very tender meat.  The wifey and I had the Tea Flavored Spiced Pork Chop and the Tea Flavored Marinated Chicken.  At first we could hardly notice the difference!  I was expecting it to come out like in their menu - rice in a bowl, pickles in another separate tray, and the main entrée on a plate to itself.  But each entrée came on one plate!  I really didn't like my pickled veggies mixing with my rice, made it a bit runny.  The pork had good flavor, you could really taste the tea it was marinating in.  It had nice crunch too from being fried.  The marinated chicken was just OK, you could taste the tea as well but it overpowered the light tasting chicken.  In the end the pork and the chicken tasted the same.  Both dishes weren't bad but for the price?  I could have gone elsewhere to have a decent meal.  I think each entrée set us back over $13 each?  Nah, I ain't down for that.

My favorite thing of the night was of course, the drink!  That Macha Ice Cream Milk Green Tea was super tasty!  Luckily we got it in a large, I nearly finished it by myself!  It was a perfect combination of tea and ice cream - smooth, cool & refreshing.  But again...kinda pricey.  However I would buy this drink again.

Overall Tea Station was just OK though, I'd come back here again but I'm gonna lean towards just drinks.  If I want food I'll probably just visit the other million places to eat on Spring Mountain!",QCtHk02W_Asu2LFfdmGQDA,7,5,3,1BmqyBCZOf5-DtD9LTJ9Cw

But, their service is horrible - absolutely rude and condescending.  If you are able to make out what they are saying . . . I don't speak Chinese so perhaps that's on me, but I didn't realize that's what it took.  There were two females at the counter when we walked up and one just looked at us (yes, we were clothed, yes, we were clean, and yes, we smiled when we walked in) and the other said, ""what u like?""  Whoa, wait a minute!  The bartender kept looking at me, but never smiled and never offered to help, much less mutter a ""hello"".  Bad day or not, I have a very low tolerance for rude customer service people, it is your job to be nice and polite, wash dishes otherwise!! 

I had a Green Tea Boba Tea and my daughters and their friend had strawberry and passion fruit snow ice, that also was tasty and they said it was yummy.  I am pretty sure fresh fruit is used as the mango snow ice is deemed 'seasonal' and it wasn't available as that is typically a summer fruit.  My tea was good, but not enough to bring me back to bad service.  There's no excuse, there are many other tea houses in the area.

I thought ""that sound's great! I'll ask for a large Dragonwell Green Tea with ICE instead of having it hot.""

I leaned in to let the woman working at the counter know I was ready and pointed to the Dragonwell Green Tea and said: ""I would like a large-sized Dragonwell Green Tea, Iced please.""

Now, it took me a few moments to finish that sentence because as I said ""large"" the woman said ""no!"" and i awkwardly finished the sentence asking the question. her reply was.

""Hot ONRLY"" very agitated about my question, I said ""Oh! I'm sorry let me continue to look.""

Now I had to stand there awkwardly and find something to order because my first instinct was to just walk the heck out and not give my money to them.

I settled on the Brown Sugar iced tea, and when I did I said ""I'm ready."" and she looked at me and said ""No!""

She had a reciept in her hand and yelled at one of the other employees and handed off the receipt to the victim as I stood there perplexed. Was I not going to be allowed to order now because I wanted iced hot tea? why did she say no? questions I was asking myself...

After the handoff she said ""OK."" and I placed my order and paid. 30 seconds later out of the station it came and I got the heck out of there.

TIP: ask for half sugar. The boba drinks here are super sweet. I went with a friend who frequents this spot and he knew to ask for 1/2 sugar. It was still very very sweet. Can't imagine what they taste like with full sugar.",tnSVm_tdM5zthKgmGF5d1A,1,0,4,6yNwMfCMgBwfppVgGR_Q6A

LOL I think its a way better name than Tea Station. If you didn't know this is a chain Boba, they also have locations in California. 

Boba: 4/5 I love their variety of boba's and styles they make it in. I love getting the passion fruit jelly ice because it just looks WILD. My boyfriend prefers the honey dew slush. I also like their hot boba's during the winter I love getting hot boba milk tea. It replaces my usual hot cocoa fix. I wish they did more natural fruit drinks rather than powdered boba's 

Food: 4/5 I've tried their sweet butter toast, Taiwanese sausages, Fried spicy chicken, & their tea flavored beef stew noodle. So  I've tried a couple things, they promote tea flavored foods but idk I don't really taste much tea but okay. The sweet butter toast is very sweet trust me! With a sweet tooth I couldn't even finish it. Taiwanese sausages are sweet pretty good, the fried spicy chicken wasn't as great as most places I've tried so that was disappointing because I love fried spicy chicken with my boba. The tea flavored beef stew noodle, isn't really special.  

Happy hour: 2/5 Pretty good happy hour from 3-5pm $2.50-$3.50 drinks. Keep in mine none of the specialty drinks more like boba milk tea or boba milk green tea. So not much variety in their happy hour. 

Price: 3/5 decent price range from $3-$7 a drink depending on size and the way you like your boba, from cold. hot, slush, smoothie etc.

Parking: 3/5 Depending on the time you go, parking for this place can be hell. From dinner hours to late the parking lot can be full and you'll be forced to park at the china town plaza and walk a bit of distance.",iS4NVHLQDt1IzmmMKqwy5A,0,1,3,rogyFrEj-6cr1F6_lc_1WQ

It almost took 40 minutes for them to acknowledge us and put utensils and placemats on our table and probably another 40 for them to take our order.

Now it's just a place I go to when I need a hang out spot or a place to meet up with friends because it's not too busy and cause my friends just want their boba fix. The drinks are pretty average! Nothing too special honestly... :-( the only real good thing that I like here is the matcha milk tea w/ ice cream & boba! I'd definitely recommend this to any matcha lovers cause the drink gives you the right amount of the matcha flavor and even if you're not a fan, you'll still find it really savory (Ive let friends who are not fans of the flavor try it & they loved it LOL). It's actually their number one seller and it stays true to that. But that's probably it. The idea of having tea based foods intrigued me when I first heard about it. Noodle dishes don't stand out too much. I haven't tried many of the other foods here though so I'm not saying that the food sucks too lol. If you eat here, I definitely recommend trying their takoyaki balls though! Just make sure to not eat them right away or you'll burn you're tongue LOL the tea flavored fried chicken rolls are actually pretty good too.
Service is a hit or miss. It all just depends on who the cashier or server is. It is a bit traditional and sometimes engaging in conversations and asking questions about the menu is hard but that's really inevitable since like I said, it's a more traditional boba shop rather than more hip & americanized  ones like let's say kft or chewy boba. Giving this place three stars because only a couple of the drinks and food here are good and because sometimes the service is terrible (rude workers) and sometimes the service is somewhat decent. Not hating on the workers but a lot of the times, they're really not friendly or welcoming :'(

The best Boba Joint back then was Tea Planet, as the place known as Tea Station is now called. 

What makes a good Tapioca Tea Room? A wide selection of Teas, with or without the Tapioca Balls. A good selection of snacks... and the Tea Station provides an ample selection of snacks to outright meals. And an ambiance that is not aimed at the teen-age crowd - the decor will tell you when you walk into Tea Station that you don't have to be a teen-ager to frequent this establishment. In fact, you don't even have to order Tapioca Teas. There is bench seating against the right wall as you enter that runs the entire length of the establishment... with handsome teak tables and chairs that further define seating spaces. Very classy and nice atmosphere.

My favorite Tea with Tapioca is either the Green Milk Tea or the Green Milk Tea with Honey... both with Tapioca balls.

My favorite snacks are...
   Tea Boiled Egg
   Chinese Sausages
   Fried Tofu
   Bean Cake

   Braised Pork with Preserved Vegetables
   Instant Ramen with 1 Egg
   Picked Ground Pork with Rice
   
Why doesn't my kids like Boba anymore? They're in their mid-20s now and they've graduated (with their friends) to finer eating establishments. The main reason they give is that the crowd at the Tea Station is mainly non-Asian now... to them it has been taken over by a different crowd.

After five years of not having a Tapioca Tea from the Tea Station... it seems to me it has definitely changed. I ordered a Green Milk Tea with Tapioca from there right after dinner at Ichiza upstairs from the Tea Station. The wait-staff seems a little older, and a little less friendly. Of course, they could have been mad that there were only two persons waiting on a 70% filled establishment - In the past there could be up to four persons waiting on customers. There is also a rule at all the Tea Stations that a person can't sit at any of the tables without ordering a snack or meal... ridiculous! The crowd is getting a little older also... the age of the crowd on a weekday at 11pm seemed to be more in their late 30s than the predominantly teen-age, college-age crowd back when I lived in Las Vegas. But the ethnicity of the people there at that time of night contradicted what my kids said about the declining Asian audience... over 70% of the people there at 11pm were Asian.

One thing hasn't changed, though - the Tea is as good as ever.",K5FrmVM70cJDbMiZ9ywMag,1,1,4,trIKjxn11A7QIwUoqEIQ9Q

Located in Chinatown, the place is apparently a hot spot for the college Asian crowd on my visits on Saturday nights. Parking is atrocious. Tea Station is located in a two-story plaza with several businesses with limited parking. On a crowded Saturday night, expect to circle the perimeter to find that elusive parking spot. Service is so-so and a bit rushed. As for payment, it's annoying how there's a minimum to use your card. Ugh. 

Drinks are good and food is average. It really depends how familiar you are with tea and other items. I love taro and their hot taro milk tea (without the boba) is simply, going back to 90's slang, the bomb. I like their ginger and jasmin tea. It's a bit strong, though. Prices are a bit high for some damn tea. I always buy the smallest portion available. Food isn't good enough to be recommended, so stick to drinks. 

Lastly, I have an issue with their bench seating against the wall. Maybe it's me and my bony ass, but it's extremely uncomfortable and hard. They put cushions to mitigate the problem, but it's doesn't work. Bruised behinds aside, it's an alright to place to have a convo with your bff or loved one.

I really like the tea they have here. I usually always get the mixed fruit tea, which is a mix of different fruits steeped to flavor your beverage. The tea is really good and comes out piping hot, so it kinda forces you to spend some time there. The place is cool, and they serve things other than tea. They have boba, shaved ice-type things, and other things I haven't gotten around to trying yet. Plus, the prices are right, though I dislike that I have to spend $20 or more to use plastic.

now here is the best part, they are open to 2am everyday, 365 days a year. including any major holidays. That is such an awesome trait for a restaurant to have. And on top of that they do not alter their prices just because it is a holiday, and I guess that keeps the people coming.


Ok enough about that, they also serve food as well, little snacks to go with the boba drinks, but they also serve actual food. It is not the greatest but for a late night dinner or snack it does the job.

5 stars for their tea selection and staff knowledge of teas. I fell absolutely in love with the honey ginseng tea. If you're sick, have a sore throat or flu... I highly recommend this tea! It goes down smoothly and clears up your sinuses. They offer a large selection of iced and hot teas (pot or cup) and bobas, the quality is good and flavors are delicious. There is something for everybody. 

Now on to the food... good selection (they've expanded their food menu), but prices are pretty steep for Asian food at a tea spot. The dishes and appetizers can stand to be $1-2 lower. Although the portions are generous and the presentation is lovely, in the end it is off-the-strip Asian food and the prices can be shocking to most locals. Needless to say, the food can range from good to great. After all, it's one of the only places in Vegas that offers green tea noodles (yum!) and their rice dishes come with complimentary side dishes (Korean-style). We definitely enjoyed our meals... hearty and plentiful. 

Aaaaand the service... AHH! The horrible service! The workers are nice, but not experienced. No sense of multi-tasking, forgot a few things we ordered... I had to get up and chase someone down for a refill on our waters. Whenever we needed ANYTHING, it took way too long for anyone to approach and deliver.

At Tea Station, the flavor & amount of sugar overpowers the tea taste (which probably isn't good for you health-wise haha) which is why I find their boba sooooo addicting. If you're looking for boba that HAS more of a tea taste, I suggest Volcano Tea instead.

One thing I dislike is the service. I always order my drink to-go and the waitresses never smile, never greet you, and always have a blank face on... When I pay with cash most of the time they automatically assume the rest is their tip, which you should NEVER do. Because they assume that I owe them something after paying almost $7 dollars for a 16-18 oz. drink ON TOP OF the girls turning around and speaking a different language to their co-workers most likely trash-talking, I probably shouldn't leave a tip. But I do anyways.

The thing is, it's been such a long time since I last went, I don't really remember what it is. But it's something that has stuck in my mind for years and I avoided the place like the plague. Was it bad service? Reading other people's reviews, that could be it.

Anyway, I finally returned this evening to hang out with a friend. We didn't order anything demanding - just a couple of drinks. The waitress took our order quickly, the drinks came out in good time, and then they left us alone as we talked for a couple of hours. When it was time to leave, it was easy enough to flag the waitress down, get the check, and be on our way.

Other people have mentioned that their service has vastly improved. I'll second that. It certainly was fast, accurate, and then invisible when we didn't need them. I'll still choose other boba places during the day when everything is open, but if you need a late night fix or just a chill late night hangout spot, Tea Station is a solid choice.",YwaKGmRNnSa3R3N4Hf9jLw,1,0,3,FvDTxhUsiIlJiGqNSDXJPA

My other 2 friends had a hot rose tea and green tea boba respectively and boy did they look just as yummy. 

Other independently owned cafes (sambalatte, holly's cuppa etc) were starting to wrap it up by 8:30pm and we were left with the more commercial chains until I realized my galpal was driving right back to the West side of town so I decided to just bring up Tea Station. 

Considering it was my first time to actually sit down and enjoy the environment, I was pretty fixated at the little frames hung on the walls with miniature tea holders, not to mention -- they had me at 'Free Wifi'! My only criticism was the service. I wish our waitresses had more knowledge about what was on their menu since there aren't any descriptions underneath item names.

Tea Station only really sacrifices in service and price. Its an Asian establishment, so I'm not expecting much in service to begin with. The waitress may forget your boba straws, not be attentive, or seem like they don't want to talk to you.

This is probably the most expensive boba place in town, with some drinks starting at $5 for medium! The appetizer can easily go up to $6 or $7, so not a cheap after lunch or dinner meal. 

However, the teas is what really set this place apart. There is a more apparent tea taste than the other boba places in town and the ingredients just taste better.  I've only ordered the coconut jelly, it comes with an scoop of ice cream on top. Ordering it will make everyone around the table envious of you. The menu # is C66. The others around the table order stuff from lychee to taro to mango. All meeting their approval in the taste department.

It was a fun atmosphere where friends could hang out and enjoy boba drinks and snacks. As time went on, I found myself spending less time in boba tea shops and I suppose, drinking it less as well. Now that I'm into boba tea again, so many shops have popped up and you don't have to visit Chinatown anymore for it.

My visit was prompted by convenience. It was a few minutes after opening and the shop was empty. My intention was to order at the counter, but the girl asked if I was sitting down, so I said, ""Yeah, sure!"" and was signaled to sit at a table. She brought me a table mat and a menu to peruse. I was meeting friends for lunch, so I was simply interested in a boba drink. I figured I had some time to kill, so why not sit and enjoy a cup (especially since they serve your drinks in glassware). It's a large menu with the usual variety of teas. When I was ready to order, another gentleman arrived at my table and when I asked for boba, he said, ""Oh, the boba isn't ready. Do you want other toppings?"" I was in disbelief. ""Uhh.. No... I only wanted boba... ummm.. When will the boba be ready?"" ""30 minutes."" I thought about it, but realized that if their 30 minutes didn't really mean 30 minutes, I may not have enough time to wait, so I perused the menu briefly and settled on the tea without boba.

My Large Iced Honey Milk Green Tea arrived in a plastic to-go cup (what was the point of dining in?) with a silly straw. I took one sip and immediately regretted every step that brought me here. It was so gross. I don't know if boba usually masks the subpar tea or if it's been that long since my last visit, but I just couldn't drink it. I ended up leaving shortly after receiving the drink because my lunch plans changed, so I walked up to the counter to pay. I thought I misheard the server when he told me the total was SEVEN DOLLARS. A large milk tea (without boba or toppings) cost $7.02 (including tax)! NO. No no no. Nooooo.

NO BOBA.
CRAPPY TEA.
SEVEN DOLLARS.
WTF.

I am sad to have wasted that money. Also, damn that stupid silly straw - its design is horrible as the straw points horizontally and drips tea EVERYWHERE. Of course, I did not consider this faulty design until it spilled all over my purse and clothing.

We ordered shaved ice with 4 toppings + condensed milk: boba, pudding, red bean, lychee jelly.  What we got (after a long wait on a relatively empty weeknight) was a total letdown.  I'll start with the good - a pretty big pile of ice with a decent dollop of red bean paste.  The rest was awful.  About two tbsp of boba...not kidding...less than what you usually get in a drink.  The pudding was inexplicably cut into small pieces and arranged around the rim of the bowl - it was like they tried to cover up being cheap by trying to distract us with some wannabe David Copperfield optical illusion.  Lychee jelly, which is in small bits already, looked like it was cut in half.  The whole arrangement was topped off with a few miserable strands / squirts of condensed milk, maybe about a tbsp.

All for nearly 7 bucks with subpar service to boot.  ARE YOU KIDDING ME????  Hey, TS Las Vegas, do us all a favor and Yelp search ""shaved ice, Los Angeles"" and take a look some of the photos.

They like to act dumb, don't even understand well, seems like they don't even know their most basic items and they talk in their language in front of customers. Almost like you owe it to them that you are in their establishment (REALLY... Such a privilege.) 

We first ordered a large tea to share but they said we HAVE to order $4/person which i don't get, i feel almost like im at a club and I had to pay for a fee. We were in a relatively good mood so fine we just gave in and ordered another large one so we can get our tea with little cups to share. So we sat down and got our order (ummm they gave it to us in a TO GO cup, FAIL.) and notice it didn't come with cups so we asked for it and they said it was $1 each. WTH?!? Why did we even order a second one in the first place? As if paying overpriced milk tea wasn't enough, they just had to get their point across that they wanted to rip you off. (OK OK Tea Station, we get it!) The lady probably sensed we were getting annoyed so she gave us a small bowl for our drink. They can give us a small rice bowl container and not a cup? Does not make sense at all that it cracks me up! Only reason to go here is when it's past 11 and it's the only boba place that is open but thats about it. 

The lady said they charge extra per cup if you did not order food (then c'mon why name it TEA STATION? Shouldve named it Rice Station or something) I dont know?

Being a Taiwanese person, I'm pretty critical about boba since boba was invented in Taiwan. Tea planet does has decent tea but their boba is alright. Sometimes it is over cooked like most boba places. Not a fan of their food either. 

Don't expect any services here. Basically they take your order and give you your drinks/food, that's the last time you will see them.

The reviews on here about the ass backward customer service are absolutely correct. I walk up to the To Go counter and a douche kabob of an employee walks over and just stares at me with a pad. I'm just like ""ok hi I'll take a medium boba milk tea with grass jelly please."" And then he says ""you got cash??"" 

Uh..is it me or does it now feel like I am in the middle of some drug deal? And why does it matter if I have cash? 

Me, ""errrrrr...I just have a credit card and three bucks."" 

Douche Kabob, ""yeaaaaaa it's a $10 minimum (points to sign)"" 

Me, ""dude, I'm not going to order ten dollars worth of your stuff so that I can just use a credit card. I just want a drink."" 

Douche Kabob, ""sorry I can't do anything then."" 

Me, ""well I'll go somewhere else then (walks out)"" 

Some advice to the Douche Kabobs of Tea Station: if you are going to run a business based on drinks which run about 4 dollars on average...maybe you should consider joining the rest of America and allow paying customers to use their credit cards with no minimum. Because you look like jackasses otherwise and now, instead of a glowingly positive review, there's another negative one about your store on the internet for public consumption.",YxvqxOutaFpWPVJS_RUkAA,4,0,1,_FvVQ1NoBtUhMYsvv1IkMQ

Seeing Tea Planet all the time after my many jaunts to Ichiza, it was my first time in.  This place is always popping in the late evenings, and it's no exception on a weekday night.

We grabbed a table by the window and perused the menu.  It took us all awhile to order since we didn't know where to start.  After getting our orders in, we were able to get a deck of cards so we can be part of the crowd.  The BF and I shared a large Mango Snow Ice ($6.25) with no tapioca.  Good stuff, mostly because it tasted like mango puree.  Our other friends order the Chrysanthemum tea, which came with two tea cups, a medium Lychee Snow Ice with tapioca ($4.75), and a Iced Black Tea.  When ordering the black tea, the waiter asked if he wanted it hot or cold, and he opted for cold.  He didn't expect it to be sweetened though.  It ended up being okay in the end, but took him by surprise when he tasted the sweetness.

To grub on, we ordered Fried Spicy Chicken ($4.50) which is deep fried with basil.  The BF and I like to grub on this from various boba places that offer it.  We also tried the Fried Tofu ($4.50), which is pretty basic and comes with hot sauce.  But decent when you want fried junk.  We tried ordering the Taiwanese Pork Pacman ($6.50), but the waiter strongly discouraged us from ordering it.  We ended up with the Fried Squid Balls ($4.50), which is exactly what it is, squid balls!  (Not those kind of balls, duh!)  Food is pretty pricey when you look it over, but you're really here for their beverages.  They also serve random things like Chicken Alfredo Pasta ($7.50) and Squid Jerky ($4.50). 

The cool thing about this place is that you can chill and hang out.  You can grab a deck of cards and just have a good time.  (Apparently we were having too much fun though 'cuz they told us to quiet down.)  You'll find people of all ethnic backgrounds here as well, which I always think is a cool thing.

Service is just okay.  They never cleared our table, so we had to put the plates on the shelf next to us.  We were there for a good couple of hours too and ordered throughout our stay, so that's probably why they allowed our loud selves to stick around.  

Overall, I do like places that allow you to hang out and play cards.  Serving some cool beverages and good snack foods to share always makes it a decent place to kick it!

Sidenote: $3 minimum per person.

Anyway, I normally get the smoothie type of drink with boba.  Taro's my fav.  Blech!  I could taste the powder... and it was way too icy chunky tasting.  We also go the Red Bean (expecting it to taste like Red Bean ice cream).  Tasted like straight up beans.

The food and drink here is consistently decent. The slushes are just the right amount of sweet for me. The boba is nice and chewy with just a little hint of sweetness. I've had the mango shaved ice and green bean shaved ice as well. Both of which were really tasty.

The aspect they're really docked down on for me is the service. The workers are really inattentive to their customers when you're sitting down at a table. They don't check up on you, and sometimes you have to flag them down just to put in your order. If you're just ordering to go, they can be pretty speedy even when they're busy. But if you're sitting down, don't come in expecting they're going to be catering to you.

Oh, and the parking situation is pretty cramped. If you know you're going during peak times, you should park in the next lot over where the 99 Ranch Market is and walk over.",9zHTbCbKILrUn59wW5QeIA,2,1,4,5CkoXyXemH3T_TdWC18gjg

Tea Station is more of a tea house than any tea shop i've been to; they serve all types of leaf/loose teas and sell alot of their own tea leaves to take home. We had:

Shaved ice: good
Boba Milk Tea: REALLY GOOD. Best boba I've had! QQ, as they would say in Taiwanese; perfectly chewy and al dente. Most places make them either too hard, or overcook them/leave them out too long and they get mushy. Tea Station's boba was really QQ and had great flavor; in Taiwan after they cook the boba, they'll mix it with some brown sugar and sometimes honey; they definitely did that here too and it was sooo good!
Mango Black Tea: Pretty good, but a little too sweet. 

I'm actually a little bummed that the boba was so good, knowing that I won't be able to have such good boba until I go back to Vegas or Taiwan. Boba tea in LA didn't even compare. Sigh... And of all places to find great boba...",5wVLW7EhvHaKoYy3tRhfrg,2,0,5,kIXnjg2p-DB9qFiKf71keA

Then, she told us that if we are unsure about what we want then she'll go ahead and take the person after us first (which I was okay with) but in the back of my mind I felt rushed.

I ordered a Passion Fruit smoothie with boba and my friend got a Strawberry smoothie with boba. 
We got our drinks and sat at their outside table. Our boba were really frozen! It was hard to drink our tea with the boba being like that. From my experiences with bobas they are chewable not hard like ice! With the price we paid, I honestly do not think that it was worth it.

I ordered a honeydew melon snow ice with boba for my hubby and a rose milk tea with boba for me.  Both were mediums.  The boba were good, but I felt for almost 5 dollars for a medium they could use real fruit instead of powder.  Second the service was not very good.  Well, actually the service was good for me but I think not that good for a couple of Caucasian ladies that walked in after me.  The waitress got very impatient with them because they wanted to know if they used real fruit or not and so just kept talking about how annoying they were in Chinese.

Yes, it is worth mentioning and Im sure there is a consensus in the feeling.  So why would I bother dwelling on it like everyone else?

Whenever I find myself in Vegas I always crave the pork chops from this place.  I could care less about anything else on the menu honestly.  Last time I was there it was under the menu as ""M10 Tea Flavored Pork Chops"".  As far as my experiences have gone with this dish, it was never a small portion.  The crusted, deep fried chop is usual a decent sized cut.  The chop is always cooked through, but not dry and overdone.  Juicy with a good amount of pork fatty goodness.  It sits on a bed of an about even ratio-ed rice portion with a meat mash blanketed by an over easy egg.  Theres also three sides accompanied on the dish that never seem to be the same.  It seems more of the luck of the draw, what sides they feel like preparing that day.  Thats pretty much the only inconsistencies they have with the plate.  Which is fine because Im sure they see those three sides the same way I see them as....filler.

The black balls were warm, soft and chewy. The flavor on the Thai tea was just right. It's about $5 for a medium and about $6.25 for a large milk tea but a certain person hooked me up since it was my first time at Tea Station.

5320633,2011-10-08,0,n_K2xa_nqzUqaUJa0S_5tQ,"Tea Station, aka Tea Planet (does anyone else call it that besides my friends and I? ) is very well known in Las Vegas ever since the early 2000's. If you've never been there or you're a tourist in Vegas, it's definitely the place to go if you want to meet locals, especially the Asians. It's where we Asians flock at night time, and where the business people meet during the day. You get people of all ethnicity coming here too to buy ""boba"" since it's located in the heart of Chinatown. Due to it's name and longstanding reputation in Cali.. many people who aren't familiar with the other cheaper ""boba"" places in Las Vegas will come to TP just to drop $6 + tax for a simple drink. 

Honestly, I DO NOT understand how it became so popular or why, but for the super expensive price you pay just to get boba made from powder and service that is dirt poor.. TP is definitely not worth it!
Perhaps because it's located in a very busy complex (thanks to Ichiza upstairs, Kaya & Zizzy bar next door) the place is just always full of people..However, if you really look at it closely, not everyone orders drinks.. it's just a place to go hang out and crowd around...pretty much loiter, making it busy all the time. 

But in reality, Tea Planet is expensive, overpriced, and the service there is HORRIBLE. Majority of their drinks start off at $5+ tax for a medium, even though nothing is fresh but powdered.. their large drinks is $6+ tax.. Finger foods such as spicy chicken and what not is $5 + tax for a small plate, and a meal is $8.99 and up.. Some of their noodle bowls go up to $12.00 +tax.. Everything there is overpriced, and the portions are skimpy. Don't be fooled by their ""tea flavored"" prefixes on the menus.. There's no tea flavor in any of it. On top of that, they occasionally raise their prices up and their portions seems to get smaller and smaller over time. 

The other day, I met up with friends there and order my usual Royal Milk Tea in a pot. The ""pot"" is supposed to be their size medium at $5 + tax ( their ""urn"" is the large size) .. when I ordered it using the size names they wrote on their menu, my waitress had no idea what the eff I was talking about. She kept asking me what size I wanted and I kept repeating the pot. They only have pot and urn on the menus, how was I supposed to know the size. She should know because she works there but sure enough, she didn't. Everyone I talk to has something bad to say about the girls that serve there. Not only are they slow, but their attitude is so bitchy, especially when they mess up your drinks and you tell them to remake it. Overall, for the price you pay, service is just horrible. And since they bring out the drinks to you, it's customary to tip them too. Not worth it at all for bad service.",3HXyXpdkH1rNAEEaSxQucw,1,0,2,82XFHNuAQSwXT8Ff8ztnyg

My +1 and I decided to have a seat and enjoy our boba after a long day of work but the hostess completely ignored our existence for 15 minuts, she was just standing there avoiding eye contact.
When she finally acknolege us and take our order it took 15 more minut for our two green tea to come out.
Then 20 minuts to get our check after asking for it and it came out wrong...can you say ""annoying?!!""
Plus the place was sooo load, it gave me a headache when I just wanted to relax...

Also we politely asked her for the wifi password but she just said ""I don't know"" and walked away from us with a very pissed face on.

They have a different prices for dine in and take out. I like the taste of there drinks, but I have two complaints. One, their boba is a hit or miss. When they are fresh, this place is delicious, but it is the opposite when you get the bottom of the container remnants. Sometimes it was so difficult to chew that my friends and I would use them as ammunition in our parking lot wars. Maybe I should not be complaining because we got a drink and entertainment for the night. My second issue is how expensive they are. Compared to all the other tea shops around, they are by far the most expensive. 

I like that they do not use too much syrup to mask their teas, but that can backfire when the tea has been sitting around for too long and become bitter. It has happened on a few occasions, but overall their green and black tea are strong and not watered down. 

The taro slush is my drink of choice and of course one of the more high in calorie drinks. It is rich, creamy and everything bad for you.",N3oNEwh0qgPqPP3Em6wJXw,3,0,2,t59y1EGuze9hPFvVyKbqhQ

I only quote-unquoted that because most times I don't order any boba or I have the lover eat the bobas for me. I'm so strange, but, there is someone out there who can relate! This is a tea station, though. Tea is what I got. 

Nothing hot. Just a large iced lychee green tea. Before I get to my green tea, they do have quite the menu when it comes.to tea. Not only do they serve tea drinks, but they serve food items that can accompany your tea or just eaten as is. Cool part, they have food on their menu where tea is incorporated. So for example, ramen? Then the soup would be made from tea. I've always wanted to stop, sit, and eat such items. Just haven't been able to get that time. 

Anyway, their tea is super potent. Some boba shops offer your iced teas and the caffeine intake does.nothing for you. Every single time i have ordered my lychee green tea and upon finishing it...I'm literally Ready to run a 50k, and I start talking with way too much excitement. A drink I recommend you trying if you too want to crack out. Lol.

Anyway, service wise is about 2 stars from me. But doesn't really matter because I go in-I go out...all business. There are a good amount of seating for a tea joint. You could also get away with bringing in an umbrella stroller as long as it isn't busy. 
Oh, warning...weekends, especially at night, the parking sucks. They have all these shops in one building with insufficient parking. You either can keep.waiting, or park in the parking lots.next to it.

If you're looking to try your same ole but in a new environment...wouldn't hurt to enter this place to have a try, especially if you are a tea finatic and would like to try food infused with tea...go at it.

I also live close enough to LA to drive up whenever I crave good old Asian food. So those who gave this place 4 stars, don't hold my rating against me just because I am spoiled. 

4 stars for the tea, 2 stars for the food, our total bill was $60 for 4, so one star for price (given the quality of the food). I would definitely pay more for better quality. 

We ordered: 
1. Tea flavored pork chop -- greasy, fatty, and didn't taste fresh. The rice was not cooked well either, I can make perfectly fluffy white rice with my eyes closed (w/ a rice cooker of course), so I have low tolerance for bad rice. Also, the sour cabbage that typically comes with pork chop rice would have been a nice touch....the veggies that came didn't taste good. 

2. Slow-cooked Pork -- not good. Again, fatty and greasy. 

3. Lavender Milk Tea with Boboa: VERY GOOD! 

4. Rose Milk tea with Boboa: not too shabby 

5. iced Green Tea: good 

Again, using Las Vegas standards, this establishment probably warrants higher rating given the lack of boboa places. I just wish the empty calories I consumed was for better tasting food.

Bubble tea: I got Lychee and the sweetness was absolutely overpowering. It was so bad, I wished they had just dumped some water in there to thin it out. I also tried strawberry and that was also too sweet. Bleh!

Boba: At first, I was delighted. The texture was great, not overly chewy or too soft. The subtle flavor was also present. BUT as the minutes passed, the boba started to freeze and instead of that black translucent color, I got light brown boba! I couldn't even bite through those freakin frozen balls. Argh! 

$$$$: Are they freakin out of their minds?? This stuff was not worth a quarter of the price! They are not realistic at all. It's not even on the strip, but they charge more for a drink than an entire meal I could get in the same complex.

Service: This was the last straw! I'm usually very patient, since I also work in customer service, but the waitress just blew me off when I asked for the bill. Doubly Bleh and Argh!

I will never stop by this place again. Okay, I'm sure they have other drinks that may be tasty, but I put a huge emphasis on customer service. Tea Station, you have lost me as a customer forever!!",nOqKDzu8dLHGJWg3VpTg1A,2,0,1,ImLI8IhwExQsNjr5EKwhnA

I first came to this Tea Station on a Vegas outing with the boys.  One of them had a crush on a worker here and we were all forced to join in on the ride.  Seeing that there's a minimum for card purchases, we were all advised to bring cash.  Not a bad little tip!  While I find their prices to be a bit high for bubble tea, they mike a delicious Rose Milk Green Tea and a Royal Milk Tea.  There's no way around it.  It's the perfect amount of sweetness and flavoring.  I haven't tried much of their food or any other drinks but it's still a pretty delicious cup of tea.

They have a pretty extensive menu compared to any boba tea houses I've been to and they sell a lot of tea.  Parking can be challenging but hey, it's Chinatown.

As a fan of matcha, I got the matcha ice cream milk green tea (C1) and it was just absolutely wonderful. I could barely stop drinking it and finished really fast. I got the pearls, but it's hard to please me regarding tapioca balls so I'd pass on that next time.

I'm not really into teas, so this review would have to be towards service and what I do see. 

Yes, they may have good drinks, but their boba is a little bit more on the pricey side. I feel like people go here because it's the ""cool"" thing to do. It's a perk that they're open late, but they get extremely busy at times. And even when it's not busy, service still sucks. People like to come here and just sit for hours to talk or play games, so sometimes it takes a while if you wanna sit in.

The last experience was a horrible one. We came in with a large party of about 10 people. We waited for a table and when we finally got one 30 minutes later, the dude who served us just told us to sit down, put the menus on the table, and walked away. That was the last we saw of him. It took about 45 minutes for us to realize they weren't going to take our order... So we left. Mind you, during that whole time I would look at him to take our order and he kept on saying, hold on with his hand gestures, and would continue on talking to another worker behind the counter. Throughout this time he would also serve other people, and people who sat after us, and still had yet to take our order. We all said forget it and left. And he stared at us as we walked out. Right after he walked to the table and grabbed the menus. Sucks cause we were all super hungry and wanted to try some food AND boba! It's as if he didn't even care to get our business. 

If I could, I would have given it 2 stars. But I added one more because their strawberry slush is good, from what I used to know. Now, I just pass this place whenever I'm in China town. There are a bunch of other boba places that are just as good with better prices and much better service who care about their customers.

Service is usually good, but can sometimes be rather poor if you end up with a rude server that is most likely a mainland China transplant.

the snacks I have tried have mostly been good (Sweet butter toast, tea boiled eggs, Tea flavored fried spicy chicken-can also be prepared non-spicy).

5926181,2008-08-16,6,n_K2xa_nqzUqaUJa0S_5tQ,"6 years ago, we did the American FOB thang and flew to Las Vegas to see the Taiwanese and Hong Kong R&B sensation version of J-Lo at the shitty Mandalay Bay Events Center (at ticket prices that would make U2, The Cure, and Radiohead blush), I suppose you can call her C-Lee, or stage name Coco Lee (real name ahem....Ferren Lee, gotta love Hong Kongers who try to get too creative with English names). 

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coco_Lee

(the pic in the link is old btw, you can probably find some more recent material on youtube if you want an idea).

Coco is 100% Chinese, speaks fluent English having spent much time in the US since age 10 (attended UC Irvine at some point) yet somehow through vocal training can belt out (in her prime which has sadly past) a voice that almost sounds like Mo Town, and somehow managed to develop some serious badonkadonk that looked like it came straight outta Puerto Rico. 

So we sat down for the whole show, and Coco had to work on the crowd, most of whom were older A$Ns and younger AZNs who came from more conservative families and didn't seem to have a clue as to how to behave at pop concerts, and needed cues from the pop $en$ation herself that she needed more encouragement from the audience via louder screams, or some AZN announcer trying to work the crowd again at the end of the first set for an encore (when the reverse is true at western rock concerts, the audience automatically goes buck wild for encores without cues). At some point we were a bit worn out and jaded at this pseudo imported A$N pop concert experience and how lame it turned out to be (where half of the songs had no live band backing, and one song was lip sync'd to the studio album playing in the background, sorry Coco ain't Janet Jackson who in her prime sang AND danced) and immediately thought about where we could unwind from the madness (or lack thereof).

So Tea Planet came into play. We knew about this place as TP (not toilet paper) is actually Tsing Shong Xiao Dzan, aka Tea Station Cafe. It is also owned by the same group or family who operates a chain of them across Southern California (and two locations in Nor Cal, Fremont and Newark) with them mainly stationed by the location by San Gabriel Square on Valley. (SGV).

We had no set of wheels of our own, so we cabbed it here within less than 10 minutes. 

Don't remember too much about this place, except the menu mirrors the Tea Stations in Southern California, but not quite the same quality and vibe. My iced mixed fruit tea was overly sweetened (was my favorite drink at the Southern Cal TS). I suppose this location is better than the one in Nor Cal Newark, decent and passable and for sure way better than Quickbux or some other tapioca tea joint. Then again I'm a bit biased as I'm a fan of Ten Ren, straight outta Taiwan.

In the words of a friend, TAIWAN ROCs! (Republic of China lolz).

And Coco's a$$ got really big when we saw her again at the Shoreline in Mountain View CA  September 07 (actually we were there for opener Alex To, former druggie who at 40 going towards 50, still kicked a shitload of ass, like a stripper working overtime for that dollar). F******K still the same schtick from her about ""I'm so nervous I need some encouragement"", ""are y'all cuh-rayzee AZN muckafuthas ready to par-tay? Lemme hear ya scuh-reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeem b*tches!""

At least Tea Planet and Ten Ren are much less predictable than a Co Co show. $ave your money and get some OG Tea $tation sippage.",DS0Idr2XDhz5e7ZfSy0dYA,9,7,3,wyr2EkFswf2SSXHqiAv5aA

Nice clean and quiet restaurant/tea shop...waitresses were surprised when I spoke in mandarin...the chrysanthemum tea came out watered down and the crystal jello (aiyu) tasted different, but when you're in vegas and desperate for boba, that's perfectly acceptable to me.

On my last visits customer service was always a more in the negative side, not too friendly, they were completely confused as to why I would want a spoon when my cup was still filled with leftover toppings from my drink. 

I did enjoy the rose milk tea, it had a strong floral scent. 
The other drinks that I had included the jasmine milk tea and an Oreo one also, both were too sweet for my liking. 

In the end the only reason I'd go back is because they're open later than other teashops, not for their drinks or service.",EEroldbqNNjuSf2pZw5kYg,0,0,1,bR5zIDpM_ftjKvgDKJ69mw

I just can't get over how expensive this place is. Not saying it's not worth it, because their creations are good. I just have a hard time paying $7-8 for a drink (off the strip) when I could buy one for half the price at most other places...that are just as good, if not better.

I have been to many of the places in this chain of stores. I'm actually originally from around the area that this company was started and headquartered, so I'm quite familiar with this place. 

The atmostphere in Tea Station is nice. Cool, hip, relaxed. I actually enjoy quite a few of their tea soaked foods as well. They aren't extraordinary, but they offer a solid product in their own right.

Aside from the price, this place is a great place to sit and hang with friends. Just be prepared, you will most likely have to beg the servers for their attention or else, just order at the counter. Service can be pretty slow.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,1,0,3,GJCr6SXkYvzWQrh4rLzmEA
5969594,2016-03-27,0,n_K2xa_nqzUqaUJa0S_5tQ,"One of my favorite spots in Chinatown as I've been here with both a group of friends and my GF.  The fact that they're open pretty late is nice if you have a craving for tea.

Most recent trip included a pot of Jasmine Blossom Tea, Takoyaki, Wonton soup and honey toast.  The tea itself was awesome, very floral but not too strong (they refill the pot with hot water for free if you let them know).  The takoyaki was good, pretty standard and the wonton soup came in a big bowl so we shared one bowl.  The honey toast was not to sweet which I like but you can at least taste the honey and the butter on the toast.

The waiters here won't blow you away with their service but if you keep their attention during your visit, you'll be taken care of just fine.  I recommend this place if you want some good food with tea or just tea itself, but don't bring a party of 10 because this place won't have room for you.",PIqY8tBBbRIWmdpW7EFEUw,1,0,4,4NNgCgkNLsTJ1ZU86ELosw

The price is a little high for boba/appetizers, but it's decent being in Las Vegas (I'm willing to splurge like a tourist, I guess.) Their royal milk tea (Earl Grey) is the best I've had in a long while.  Boba texture is close to perfection.  Service is decent.

They are also open really late..., staff was fairly friendly...  they didn't want to make my coconut boba tea withouth milk,( as many other places have done for me).

They are serious about their tea not in a way where we all have to kneel down on pillows and get served through traditional service past down by their forefathers but serious in that tea is in everything they do including the food on their menu.

Our group of six ordered milk tea, fruit tea and the old standard of Thai tea.  Everyone opted for boba and nothing disappointed.  We began the visit sort of cramped at a table not really made for six.  Seating is somewhat limited but being that we didn't order yet, the waitress motioned to me when a booth came available for my group to move there.  Way to be customer service centric.  All the waitresses had very pleasant personalities and the tea was fantastic.  I regularly frequent this tea house and will continue to.",OLd25x0N_CgF5053Iqs8xA,0,0,4,E8irCwY5Ih8BTT2IOIsbIw
