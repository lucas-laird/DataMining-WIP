Was it worth the wait?

Hell No.

Curly fries were chewy, greasy and cold.

Chicken sandwiches ... Way over fried and old oil. 

Scary to say the Taco Bell next door would have been a better option.

Oh, and over $14 for this with a small drink. 

Won't make this mistake again.",US5TnFHzeZLWHgwzArQJrw,0,0,2,6G55ojN_TeTPd_2dG-u1eg

2212314,2017-09-30,1,RMIZvXChyfDWzWbNOK0l9Q,"Boy oh boy was I having an egg craving! I pulled into Jack in the Box intent on buying a bucket of eggs. 3 sides of scrambled eggs and a side of sausage made for an awesome breakfast and it was only $2.38. 

I tried the same thing with McDonald's eggs and they tasted like some kind of fake egg filler substance. J in the B eggs taste like real scrambled eggs. 

I asked them to put it all in the same container, and my eggs picked up the yummy sausage taste too. Ever since I've been running 2 miles every morning, skipping breakfast is not an option. I'm hungry! This is GOOD, cheap and filling. I'm a fan.",IamJ-OX89_P-i-xkknwpPA,4,1,5,8oMNgVf9z2z7I46FZV5-DA
2611724,2016-01-09,0,RMIZvXChyfDWzWbNOK0l9Q,"Came here at 8pm on a Friday night. The service was great and it wasn't packed or crowded. The restaurant was super clean. Like way cleaner than any other fast food restaurant. As based on the other reviews, I didn't have a bad experience with service and had quite the opposite experience. Quiche the cashier was quick and efficient and spoke clearly. She got my order and I paid in less than 30sec. I mean what else can you ask for?? Then while my friends and I waited for our sourdough Jack, buttery Jack, home style ranch chicken, chipotle chicken sandwich. We got drinks at the custom Coca Cola machine with more than 20+ drink combos. Fun fun fun! 
And Ang3L- food distributor-as per lack of better words called our order and gave us as many sauces as we wanted. Great experience. 
I can see how people would say it was divey and sketchy but it is in a good area!! Drive thru is open  24hour and the dining area is open until 12 midnight.
I mean come on people this is fast food!
The only reason I couldn't give it a perfect fast food experience is because they didn't give us ANY napkins!",kwS_MjOUs1Jd_4X7B5t2yQ,1,2,4,MTu5wp3FTlKh5GuUaJgZGQ

Good was good, we got the 2/$1.00 tacos and curly fries but other than that nothing big. The place was clean though but just the horrible customer service was very unnecessary.",rqb5abV146wcU-Z7JxfEIQ,1,2,2,t9doPdWKLzupFvbbEU5y7Q

I don't know if you're having a bad day, either you're tired or whatever the case maybe don't have that type of attitude please.",d-MOYLroNWxCHiJL8MdXZQ,0,0,1,OceGRurCgb9qeIB748LPrA
2768103,2016-11-29,1,RMIZvXChyfDWzWbNOK0l9Q,"I went to Jack-in-the-Box just to use my Apple Pay, and to get a spicy chicken sandwich. They don't except Apple Pay, at least not in the drive-through. Their food is mediocre, that's why it's somewhat cheap. But for the price of just the premium sandwiches, they really are, almost, as big as how it portrays in the pictures. 
I like how this last time when I went they were really quick to get my food and order. Once a lady gave me both of the shakes I ordered Even though I only had money for one shake. 
Usually the outside exterior of the store turns me off, because there's always a lot of kids in the afternoon, and a lot of hanging out in the evening. But the staff really puts the customer ahead of the commotion That might be going on outside.",e3T9PP79lQCfu5luDoJDIw,0,1,3,CcN1AT_hu5U12a_z8gdaXA

4329410,2018-01-06,0,RMIZvXChyfDWzWbNOK0l9Q,"Rudest drive thru person by the name of Shauntreya. Not sure why she felt the need to stare at me meanly and be rude but her behavior will have me going to one of the many other fast food restaurants in the area. If she worked for me I'd fire her for such a bad attitude. The other ladies that have waited on me in the past have been so pleasant. The guy that took my order was pleasant but not Shauntreya. She has a huge chip on her shoulder about something. 

The food was disappointing too. Come on Jack In the Box buy large tomatoes instead of giving me three Roma tomato slices on my spicy chicken sandwich. Why bother asking for a side of Ranch if they are not going to give it to me. She literally just glared at me. What a waste of money. 

Entire visit from food to the horrible drive thru lady was a disappointment.",Ct25jCAjdFEaq_uzgZ_M6A,0,0,1,s7qf_SxM634U83nKtXOTaQ

I pulled up to the drive thru, and all the person said is ""hello"" - I said ""hello? How are you?"" I got a ""what do you want?""  - ok for starters, that is not exactly how things should go. I got my order placed and pulled up to the window. I gave her my card, she ran it then instead of handing it back she put it somewhere where I couldn't see, and started handing out my order. When I asked for my card back she got very PISSED at me and went to fling it at me. I grabbed it and gave it to my husband. She then said ""you don't need to snatch"". I said ""excuse me? Oh can you please wipe off that drink? "" she closed the window right in my face when I asked for a manager. I finally got one to come to the window, she apparently was a shift leader, this girl was right behind her and started talking over me then started yelling at me. Wow! I asked for the managers name, Tom. And her name , Quiche. I did the online survey, sorry I gave you a low score there as well. My husband, my daughter and I got just simply BLOWN AWAY. How on earth this Quiche girl is a shift leader is a miracle- yelling at customers ? Just plain being extremely RUDE?? I thought she was going to come out the window!

We went there and ordered a simple crap breakfast, eggs burnt, hash browns cold coffee taste like water when my wife went to the counter the supervisor or manager whatever she was just tried to explain how good it was, they remade the eggs and were still overcooked, she tried to explain they were pre made. SO WHAT make the new eggs. We got a refund for the nasty breakfast trash and left, only thing okay was the OJ. Customer service was a negative 5. what a disaster of a place, sad state of service, you should be ashamed of yourself, stop blaming the customer, smile and try to correct it not explain why your a disaster. What a joke. CLOSE if you don't want to take care of your guests, the person's name who was POOR at customer service and rude was ALEIZZA. Get rid of her she was RUDE and a negative employee.
