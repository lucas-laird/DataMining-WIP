2823,2008-11-01,0,B7XwqO9Lbzq-VtOiRobfCg,"Incredible burgers!  LBS is located inside the Red Rock Casino and features all organic ingredients (even the ketchup is organic!).  It makes everything, including buns, patties, pickles, and fries, in house.  The buns are soft and so fresh.  The burgers are juicy and cooked perfectly.  The fries, that come with a special fry sauce, are crisp and delicious.

LBS is great because it provides great choices to customize your burgers.  The LBS burger sauce is just slightly sweet (akin to a steak sauce) which some of you may not like.  But you have a variety of sauces you can substitute on your burger, including a horseradish one.  Yum!  There are also varieties of cheeses and toppings that ensures everyone will leave happy.  Definitely the best burger I've had in Vegas.",X-IK7d1JIKVPWhgeiPO3pA,1,0,5,RG023nZP9d0v24ASw95wqA

We went on a Sunday afternoon so the place was somewhat dead we were told that there would be a 20 minute wait.  There was 6 visible tables that were empty but had dirty dishes left on them from the previous customers and nobody was bothering to clean them off.  When we were finally seated we had to wait about 10 minutes before our waiter came up to take our drink orders with his hands full of dirty dishes from another table(YUK!) We ordered an appetizer as well as 2 burgers and an order of sliders we were told that our only option for buns were white as they were all out of the other buns.  Our appetizer & burgers all arrived at the same time delievered by a food runner who dropped the food and took off leaving us no silverware or napkins or plates for the appetizer.  We finally had to get our own silverware and napkins from the wait station since nobody ever came back including our waiter.  The food was OK ,nothing special at all I have had better at a fast food joint.   At the end of our meal we had to hunt down the waiter to get our check and to pay our tab.  And those 6 tables that were sitting there dirty when we walked in were still sitting there dirty when we left.  Considering how dead this place was at the time we were there the customer service and cleanliness of this place should have been excellent.  So my overall review would be EXTREMELY POOR SERVICE and poor quality of food we definately will not be returning to LBS",MVT3xRMHj2SMN4MTHfGTrA,2,0,1,SDOli3yaZSGfx6hucsdxhQ

161546,2011-11-26,0,B7XwqO9Lbzq-VtOiRobfCg,"Trying to knock off as many requests from readers as I can, I recently ventured to Red Rock to check out LBS who touts themselves as ""the best burger in Las Vegas."" I've heard many positive comments about this burger, and I was quite nervous coming into it since it was in a casino location. With the opportunity for them to be lazy and overpriced, they didn't disappoint, but some very important questions arose.

Located directly off the casino floor amongst a few other restaurants, LBS has a pretty open, plain, unassuming interior. I guess they're trying for the Texas/American theme with the bull horns, license plates on the ceiling, and paint peeling off the brick walls. I made the mistake of going during Monday night football, if you don't like your dinner interrupted by some jackass from the local radio station pulling names out of a hat for Twilight DVD's, pick a different night.
What I love about the menus is how many burgers you get to choose from, they really feature all their pre-made options, the do-it-yourself portion is really a side note. This is a bit different than a lot of the more recent burger ventures out there, and more than welcome. There are also sliders, salads and a few different shakes; none of which I tried on this trip.

To keep things simple I went with the 'Classic' so I could easily sample the meat and basic toppings. Cooked almost as ordered, my medium-rare burger had great flavor, the meat was tasty and had a slight peppery flavor to it that I've noticed with more than a few burgers lately. The pickles had strong flavor along with the other fresh toppings and were all quite good. The bun was a little on the stiff side, but I found myself ok with it through the course of the meal. Overall I was very impressed with the flavor and was happy with the results.

The part that threw me was the fries; supposedly 'fresh cut', they were just not good. It's always very difficult to fall in love with a great burger when the fries you're presented with suck. I know this is a burger blog, but the fries are an extremely important part of a burger meal, and these really took away from it. They weren't awful, they just weren't that great. I feel like a lot of places are getting very lazy with their fries and that's a problem. And before anyone complains, I must point out how many people love In-N-Out but hate their fries. Am I right?

At $11.95 for my burger, I don't think it was too high, especially for a casino location. The meat was great, and the burger was very tasty. That price even includes fries, so by the time you add a drink you're only around $14-15 which is still almost in the crappy Five Guys or Smashburger territory, but with way better flavor. LBS is definitely worth the trip to Red Rock, let's just get them to work on their fries a bit and I might give them a higher score.",0G9BcXSQscv_GnhlNwFfjw,1,0,3,eE7aTB0VWTTF8ujxMWrOXg

346067,2012-06-12,2,B7XwqO9Lbzq-VtOiRobfCg,"Since I'm a vegetarian, I don't usually frequent burger establishments.....with the lack of beef in my diet and all.  But occasionally the mood strikes me for a veggie patty slathered with all sorts of unhealthiness.  And a milkshake.  So when I was in the area, my husband I decided to make a stop at LBS.

I enjoyed the look of the restaurant and our server was very friendly.  My husband and I both ordered the veggie burger minus the healthy stuff, plus BBQ sauce, onion rings, and cheese.  And a milkshake.

The milkshake was good, but not awe-inspiring like the one I had at Holstein's (sister restaurant to LBS).  The burger appeared healthy- I could see whole peas and lentils in it- but it was all trickery.  They deep fried that bad boy until it was dripping in grease.  Ok, I can't say for sure it was deep fried but it was so greasy I just assumed that it was.

The shoestring fries were the best part of the meal.  I just love me some super thin fries covered in garlic and parmesan.

I would almost consider three-stars for LBS, but the price and indigestion from the grease kept me from doing it.",ELfzWgdf64VBLi5z1ECItw,0,0,2,vF2EiJyKnh83YzfRVgO1YA

It took 50 minutes to get our food. Some of the orders were wrong but we were now running even more late and were starving. 

Granted there we were a large group of 10 but people that came in after us got their food and left long before we got ours. We asked to speak to the manager and the waitress said he was busy. 10 more minutes pass. We asked the waitress what was going on and she said they only had one fryer. There were only 3 people who had fries at our table! When we asked what was taking so long the manager said there was some problems with the grill. At least they could have told us that when we said we needed to rush. We would have gone elsewhere!

386145,2013-04-14,0,B7XwqO9Lbzq-VtOiRobfCg,"I had high hopes for this place, but was disappointed by a few things. My wife got the regular burger and I got the organic turkey burger.

First, their regular white buns tasted sweet and cinnamon-like. It was as if they put a burger between two donuts. Once the burger was taken off the bun the meat tasted good but a burger shouldn't be eaten like that unless you are intentionally on some low-carb kick.

I got the organic turkey burger on a wheat bun. I must say it was pretty decent, the turkey was juicy and actually a bit fatty, which is good for turkey since it tends to be flavorless.

The fries were OK, a bit on the greasy/tasteless side. Wasn't a fan.

The waiter was very friendly though and our service time was quick. Also, the place was very clean which is a plus. With so many restaurant choices in Vegas and other burger places I probably wouldn't return, but if I did I would get a burger on a wheat bun.",Td_ONQQFhfa2U0tmvzaRWA,0,0,3,QlEn2R46JLrORvCCtUn78A

We go here every-so-often.  The burgers are, well, burgers.  They are definitely not bad, but not out-of-this-wold-amazing, either.  I really like the casual atmosphere and it's a great place to watch football and eat.  The staff has always been outstanding.  The servers, hosts, and bussers are very friendly, helpful, and the service is quick.  This kind of service has been my experience every time I have been here.  

This is an odd observation, but really the only detracting feature about LBS is the booths. Literally the seats themselves.  You will get swallowed up in them, and they make dining kind of an odd experience of eating while trying to balance on a stability ball with a large feather pillow on top.  A child's booster seat is more like a roller coaster!

If you are looking for a decent burger and the usual sides in a casual atmosphere with great servers, LBS is it - sit at a table, though.

I opted for the Bacon N Eggs. This is a huge burger paired with a mountain of shoestring fries. And at it this price, in a casino, it's A LOT of food. The burger was juicy and very tasty. With a fried egg, bacon, LBS special sauce, and spicy mustard in addition to lettuce, tomato, & cheese, this sandwich was almost too much. But it was so good I had to finish it.

The service was friendly and fast for a Friday night. Our bartender was on top of her game and made me an outstanding Old Fashioned. I'll definitely be back here to try some of the other burgers and have a few cocktails while I'm at it.",lALW6UN3fU2DRaiMzH9kMg,1,1,4,gIKa6PC06btaZpha4kgi6Q

An up-beat food server promptly addressed our table, took our drink order, and expeditiously returned with two glasses of water.  Soon after, our cocktails arrived.

We started off with an order of spicy chicken wings.  When presented, the eight jumbo wings were still steaming from being pulled from the frier.  The spicy/tangy aroma of buffalo wing sauce filled the air.  

The wings were crispy on the outside, but extremely moist on the inside.  We lathered them up with ranch (originally served with bleu cheese) and devoured them.

Our entrees included the Plain Jane and the Seared Ahi Salad.  The burger was ordered well and was very tasty.  The bun was not overwhelming and the spicy mustard gave it great taste.

The Ahi salad looked good.  I did not taste it, but the other guest in my party enjoyed it, except for the fact that it was lightly sprinkled with green onions, which was not in the description.

683170,2011-03-30,0,B7XwqO9Lbzq-VtOiRobfCg,"After a long day of doing things you wouldn't want your grandchildren to find out about, what day in Vegas wouldn't be complete without a tasty burger?  I visited LBS Burger on a whim and found it to be well worth a try.

This joint is located inside the Red Rock Casino, which is a lovely and upscale haunt.  As such, the burgers here are a little bit on the pricey side, starting at $10 and moving up to around $15 for the specialty ones.  Not that you'll mind once you sink your teeth into them, though.

I had no trouble with the wait time for a seat, but the wait time between ordering and receiving the food did seem above-average.  After checking my watch a few times the food arrived.  I chose the Smokehouse burger for $10.95 and was served a burger that seemed to be twice as large as its bun.  This made for some fun eating.  The flavor was outstanding though, and the burger itself was as juicy as they come.  The bacon was crisp without being overdone, the barbecue sauce was thick and rich, and the lettuce was present without interfering with my enjoyment.

One word of caution:  The meat here seems to be cooked a little on the rare side.  I recommend countering this by ordering ""one degree up"" from what you normally order.  So if you're a medium-rare type of soul, make it just medium this time.  If you like it medium-well, go ahead and be bold and order it well-done.  Those I talked to agreed that the meat here is pinker than they'd ordered...and then went on to say that it was so good they hardly cared.

The staff was accommodating and friendly.  The bartender doubles as waitress during off-peak hours which can make her fairly busy, but the one I had was lovely and helpful.  I found the seats to be amusing, as they sink fairly deeply when you sit upon them, resulting in the table being nearly at eye-level until you adjust yourself.  The decor is reminiscent of late 19th Century stockyards, with brick accents and butchery tools on the wall, and an Old West-style bar.  Little touches like this keep the place interesting as you await the food that will soon win you over.",w4Hgf7xlrDxNPTdC-J3CCw,0,0,4,8_Mkw4lc1g3HtZ1ri_AYzA

I planned a couple nights stay at Red Rock and decided to finally try LBS.

My friend and I were seated right away even though the place was rather busy being Friday night. I ordered the smokehouse burger with potato twisters. I seem to remember specifying the burger be medium well. I could only eat half of the burger even though I had not eaten since breakfast. The burger just seemed to be too greasy. The bottom bun looked and tasted like it had been dipped in the grease trap.

About 4 hours later while at the concert I start to get the cold sweats and start shivering. The prior evening I had seen the movie Bridemaids, so I could not get the scene after the Brazilian BBQ out of my head. My stomach was in full rejection mode and luckily for me I had not been drinking alcohol otherwise their would have been a different ending... literally.

Well the intestinal distress finally cleared up after 2 days in a fetal position.

On a positive note make sure you try the potato twisters, which would really be good if they server them covered in garlic and grated parmesan.

So I've been wanting to try LBS since it opened a while ago, but today was the first time I had a chance to get to go. First off, when they say ""Be careful, our booths are kinda low,"" they're not kidding. They're comfy, but you need a grappling hook to get out, especially after the food.

There's a Yelp bonus, if you check in you get free ""Twisters."" These are twisted homemade potato chips. It's really good, but it's a meal-ruiner. Appetize with caution.

I thought the food was very good. I got a barbecue-style burger (BBQ sauce, onion rings, bacon, etc) and it was really tasty. Good sauce. Went for the whole wheat bun, and it wasn't all that soft, but it wasn't terrible. Elite Emily went for the El Caliente. I'm not saying the food was bad; it was actually quite good, but we had fallen prey to the appetizer, so half of the burger came home with me.

Accoutrements: Skinny fries. Meh. The onion rings were quite good. No room for dessert, though.

It was good overall, and nothing to scoff at. However, if you can make it to the Strip, I still think Holstein's at The Cosmopolitan or Burger Bar at Mandalay Bay is better. But if you're in the West End or Summerlin and don't feel like driving to the Strip, this is a good option.

My ""go-to"" burgers are the Steak burger  and the bacon and egg burger:

Steak Burger ( $13.50) - pepper crusted burger, swiss cheese shrooms and creamy horseradish sauce

Bacon & egg ($11.95) - burger, fried egg, smoked bacon. white cheddar, etc

Interestingly, their ""perfect burger"" is pretty much the same as the ""pub burger"" at Public House ( their sister restaurant on the strip at Venetian/Palazzo ) yet it cost almost $6 less at LBS.

They consistently cook the burger to my liking.

I'm  big fan of the twister option for my side - basically their potato chips that come in a huge mound and i'm told the mound is from one potato - that's one big frickin' potato people ! 

Decent draft beer options.

Personally, i think the shakes are pricey for what you get but i'm not a big fan of a shake/malt with a burger.

Service is inconsistent but not to the point it affects the meal.

They have a great happy hour between 2-6pm.  Several burgers are priced at $7.77 and $4 pints ( along with a few other deals )

The patty itself is a bit squishy, even when ordered well done, but that's to be expected and it's not so squishy that it's spilling all over your hands. The taste, however, is amazing and that's what counts.

Fried cheese curds are always a hit with my group. The potato twisters are tasty too. A plateful of fried, herbed potato tumbleweeds. What could be bad?

This was my second visit to LBS and the first one was a good experience, but I learned to return to restaurants before I write reviews, and I'm glad I did!

The restaurant both times was not busy (a bad sign). The first visit we went for the firecracker shrimp appitizer and it was great! 

The first time I ordered a cheese burger it was good but a bit to heavy so the second time I went for the regular ol' burger. It amazed me both times they asked about temperature because I thought it was law that burgers require a certain temp. Either way I ordered med well and my partner med. Both were well done (why did they bother asking?).

We had one server FINALLY come over for our drink order after 15 minutes and us staring down the staff gossiping and talking about partying near the order station. Strike one!

My beau is a ""plain Jim"" but a burger freak! So plain it was ordered meat and bun nothing else. As usual, he was asked about onions and condiments! Oh goodness! He ALWAYS specifies ""plain just the meat and bun, nothing else"".  Strike two!

My burger was good upon arrival, even though it was just a simple burger with no special requests. So I'm thinking-Okay, maybe they will recover? WRONG!

My beau's burger arrives with condiments scraped off the bun. Wait, did I mention that he despises condiments??? So he sends back the burger, the burger returns to him with now seared condiments on the burger. 

At this point were pressed to get to our movie, but it still takes nearly 10 min. before someone comes by to check on things even though it's obvious one of us hasn't touched a bite. Finally, I call over a hostess and we asked for our bill. She notices that one of our meals is hardly touched and asked if we need a box as well. At that point my boyfriend politely asked for the bill again and informed her it was the worst burger place he had ever been to.

As soon as we sat down, we noticed a few similarities to Holstein's, like the ""Bamboozled Shakes"" which are milk shakes with alcohol mixed it.

My husband and I ordered the spinach-artichoke dip as an appetizer. IT tasted great, but the portion was too big. I ended up getting the Captain Hook, which was a burger with crispy beer battered atlantic cod instead of beef.  It was great, except for the gigantic bun that it was served in.  My husband ordered the Perfect Burger, but said it was not-so perfect. He ordered it Medium and it was overcooked.  The Onion Marmalade and Roasted Tomatoes were unrecognizable and were overpowering.  After he removed the onions and the tomoatoes, the burger was decent enough to finish.  Again, the bun was way too big.  The only thing that saved that burger was the smoked bacon, LBS BBQ sauce, and herb mayo.

Will be here again for sure, on a day that I'm up to have a high carb load and not care about eating white potatoes and processed cheese food substitutes or whatever it is on those Irish Nachos. Delicious. 

The boothes, by the way, are AWFUL. Way too low, and too close to the tables. They seem to know this already and acknowledge it by asking as soon as you're seated at a booth ""If you're uncomfortable with the booth or they're too low, we are more than happy to move you to a table. Enjoy your meal!"" I got that when we were seated, and heard the two booths adjacent to me get the same info when they were seated.

I encourage you to give this place a shot, most of the reason I give them 4 stars instead of 5 has to do with special dietary preference (Paleo) and the boothes. If you get a table instead and don't care about the same things I care about with regards to food, you'll probably have an excellent meal!",7hnwrH20r6IiJOAlNOPgcw,1,0,4,qrn1xPxTgD8dC-E2f_D53g

First of I enjoyed the ambiance and found the booths to be very comfortable.  The bartender came to take our order to assist the server who was with someone else.

There were some good drink and lunch specials.  Be sure to ask about them.

We ordered up an alcoholic pumpkin pie shake and a nifty pineapple upside down cocktail along with some cheese kurds.  Delicious!  They also have  a check in deal where you get a huge plate of the house potato chips with dipping sauces when you talk about Yelp.

I ordered up the ""Perfect"" burger which came with a perfectly cooked patty some bacon and other tasty sauces on it.  I regretted that decision when I tasked the GF's ""Billy Burger""  it was a turkey patty covered with bacon stuffing and cranberry sauce.

 for entree i had the usual perfect burger,  which is SOOOO good.  gruyere cheese and good bacon just makes the burger sing!
other entrees at the table were the california chicken sandwich, a cobb salad (that rivals the cobb salad at the four seasons verandah!!!) and steakhouse burger, and 2 kids slider entrees.
everything was great,  service was super freindly and fun.  our beer and soda glasses never went empty! we had a party of 6 with 2 kids and they were more than accomidating,  great family place or a cool place to hand out

If you have a larger group like we did (there were 5 of us), you can usually expect to have to wait for a table -- our wait was 45 minutes.  But it gave us time to work up our appetites :)

I think the burgers here are pretty good -- they're HUGE! My favorite is the smokehouse burger, smothered in BBQ sauce, cheese, onion rings and bacon.  I tried the turkey burger, which was super moist, and got a wheat bun (it's nice to have a choice).  Fries are decent (not as good as Smashburger though, I'll admit) and the burgers are served with a very generous amount of fries on the side.  For $12, you definitely get a lot of food!

Our server was really friendly and attentive and our food came exactly as ordered, which was great because when I say no pickles, I really mean NO pickles :) 

Overall, this place is a good choice when you're in the mood for a burger; they have some unique burgers on the menu and a variety of non-burger items as well.

---------FOOD REVIEW-------
If you don't want to gorge, go with the mini-burger/sliders.  The sampler had a tuna, turkey and beef slider.  I have to say it totally surpassed my expectations.  Each slider had a aioli sauce, seasoned, mayo, condiments, what have you, that complimented the meat perfectly.  I was permitted a bite of the Longhorn burger and put my life in danger by taking, without permission, a PACMAN-sized second bite.

----------SERVICE RANT BELOW---------
Our ""hostess"" must have demonstrated the innate skill to fog up a mirror two inches from her face with glazed over eyes and was probably hired on the spot by some idiot.  The place was about 1/3 full and adequately staffed--they got that part right...  The wait was beyond a mere oversight.  We were being ignored... plain & simple.

The actual server was good to go, but whomever was running the place sucked like a sucka-fish and probably lives in an aquarium too.   A different male and female server then ours were, conservatively, spending 80% of their shift standing by the bar like they were on a date.  So what?  They could have been talking about what positions they were going to try out on each other for all I care.  Heck, they could have been hittin' it right then and there!  --good for them.  The problem was the residual effect.  Since they only graced the patrons with a couple of cameo appearances, the result was our server was working the room by herself--helping everyone.  That meant we thought we were gonna wait for the 2012 Mayan Calendar Alien Armageddon before the bill came.

I do love their bench seats that seem to sink like quick sand and the rustic/tavern feel makes for an inviting kinda classy haven.

""Snacks"":

Zucchini Fries with roasted red pepper aioli dip: thick finger sticks of breaded zucchini was okay and typical. The dip was interesting.

Potato Twisters with fry sauce (& ""Cardiac Style"" version - comes with chili and cheese): These are Awesome and Intimidating! It comes in a tower of a thin sprial of potato thats been gently fried. These can easily be shared by 3-4 people. Ask to have it ""Cardiac Style"" and they pour chili and cheese on top, it's Pretty darn tasty!

Hand-Cut French Fries with fry sauce: better than average, sauce is great, resembles some sort of thousand island/ranch sauce?..

Sweet Potato Fries with fry sauce: not that sweet, not that tasty either.. A little boring to me..

Buttermilk Onion Rings with fry sauce: Their onion rings here are a Must! They are nearly Perfect! The breading is key!

""LBS Burgers"":

* The Burger Patties in each of the following burgers weren't for light eaters, at least 1/3lb of Juiciness. Buns are big as well, proportioned well with everything else and tasted quite good. 

Plain Jane: lettuce, tomato, red onion, pickles, lbs burger sauce + spicy mustard = 2.5/5 Stars, Plain Jane.. Need I say more

Bacon N' Eggs: fried egg, smoked bacon, white cheddar, lettuce, tomato, red onion, lbs burger sauce + spicy mustard = 3.5/5 Stars, I'm a sucker for eggs and burger!

Frenchie: brie cheese, grilled mushroom, lettuce, alfalfa sprouts + horseradish cream = 3/5 Stars, I love Brie cheese and its not available at most burger joints!

Smokehouse: white cheddar, bbq sauce, smoked bacon, lettuce, tomato, onion rings + pickles = 3.5/5 Stars, classic 'Western BBQ' burger

""Signature"" - The Perfect Burger: all natural beef, gruyere cheese, herb mayo, smoked bacon, lbs burger sauce, frissee oven roasted tomato + red onion marmalade = 2.5/5 Stars, too many things going on that didn't blend well to me..

Everytime I've dined here, I never get that 4 or 5 Star Factor from their Burgers.. Always been just short of something??..Flavor wise.

2006482,2011-01-23,0,B7XwqO9Lbzq-VtOiRobfCg,"I've been to LBS a handful of times and its a pretty good burger place.

However, last night we went and it was about a 30 minute wait for our group of 4 (typical for a Friday night, so no problem) but after we placed our order, with the ditsy waitress, it seemed to take about an hour.  On top of which, she messed up our drinks and forgot our drinks on more than one occasion.  She also messed up my burger order.  I only asked for no LBS sauce!  When she saw that it had it on there, she offered to re-fire the burger, which I declined and she then said it was the kitchens fault not hers.  I wish I caught her name because she was annoying and horrible.

That was only one occasion out of like 5.

The following are some of the things we have had in the past:

Apps:
-Potato Twisters: gourmet potato chips is the best way to describe it.  It comes with their ""fry sauce"" which is chipotle ranch.
- Fried Cheesekurds: the only reason we had this was at the recommendation of our server.  Don't do it.

Burgers:
- Bleu Burger: Bleu cheese, Smoked Bacon, Grilled Onion, Herb Mayo, Lettuce, Tomato & Pickles.
My husband loves bleu cheese and he says that it is really good.  He is very picky and changes the onions to crispy onions and no lettuce, tomato or pickles.
- Sampler Plate of the 3 sliders: Beef, Turkey and Ahi Tuna.  The beef is the best.  Turkey was a little dry, but it comes with mayo, sprouts and cucumber, which is a good mix.  Ahi Tuna was good with the mayo, slaw and teriyaki sauce.
- Do it Yourself Burgers: pick however you want your burger made.  Can't get better than that.

The buns for their burgers are delicious.  They are soft and have great flavor.  It's like the perfect bun for a burger.

Their fries and sweet potato fries are really good.  The fry sauce is good with the fries.

They have something called LBS sauce = their ketchup.

Next time I really want to try a shake.  They look yummy!

Their cocktails are a bit expensive.  I ordered a cosmo for $10.50 and it came in a tiny glass.  It really should have been no more than $5.00.  They have good beers that always taste good with the burgers.

2206255,2010-08-17,3,B7XwqO9Lbzq-VtOiRobfCg,"This is a review of their happy hour.

The Skinny: turkey sliders delivers one hot bird injection but its still hard to overlook the so-so sauces and toppings  (3.5), service: great for a burger joint (5), value: pretty good for a happy hour - 2 plates of sliders, salad, diet coke, a side of fries and fried zucchini = $22 excluding tip (4).

My hubby and I were eager to come try their happy hour where the appys, salads and sliders are 50% OFF. Our server was great, taking the time to explain the specials, refilling our drinks and making sure we were well taken care of. I'm not sure what his name was except his shirt said ""Junior"" on it. Shout out for being an awesome server!

We tried their fried zucchini, french fries, salad, a order of turkey and beef sliders. Most of the items were well prepared but my main problem was the mediocre sauce pairings. 

The zucchini were nice and crisp with a good cornmeal type coating. However the slightly spicy sauce was not that great. A nice ranch dressing would have been better.

The salad was a pretty standard balsamic vinegar salad with pretty good ingredients - my only complaint was the slight over mealy tomatoes. 

French fries were okay while they were hot and retained some crispness. However, once they cooled, they became soggy and slightly greasy very quickly. The special fries sauce was bland and not that interesting.

Now on to the sliders: both sliders had a good patty to bun ratio. With regards to toppings, just wished they had grilled/fried onions as an option. 

The turkey sliders had a lovely juiciness to them. (Literally, one big bird injection in the mouth... heh heh heh) However, despite the wonderful texture of the patty, it was definitely underseasoned. The accompanying herb mayo didn't help either - bland upon bland. Not to mention the toppings of cucumber and alfalfa sprouts cannot stand up to a warm patty (the cucumber once warm becomes slimy, the alfalfa becomes wilted).

The beef sliders were okay not great. The patty was not nearly as juicy as the turkey burger but was better seasoned. The ""LBS"" sauce was a little smokey ketchup - nothing special. Again, the burger could have used a better topping than just a pickle and the aforementioned sauce.

I can't help but compare this place with the newly opened Yardhouse's sliders and happy hour specials. I would say if you took into account the service, the ambience and the wait times, I would definitely favour LBS over Yardhouse for happy hour.",h9RUaaHa5kcQKqtJ-sgS0Q,4,4,3,J22kl4WaCvR7vt-JmLo34g

Cool decor. The burgers are so tasty. My boyfriend had the Steakhouse burger and he said it's the best burger he's ever had. He was going crazy over it. I had the Plain Jane and it was very good. I LOVED the pretzels and the zucchini fries. 

It's a little pricey, about $12 for a burger. It cost about $100 for 4 of us. (That's including 3 cocktails.) But, you get used to the prices in Vegas and this was so tasty, and the place had a cool, fun vibe that I really enjoyed.

The reviews for LBS were so extreme on either end.  Some people hated it.  Some people loved it.  I went with an open mind, but was more prepared for mediocrity.  It was like going to a movie you expect to suck only to be pleasantly surprised.  I thought the burger was slightly above average and would rate it at 3.5.  The sliders were TINY.  I could eat all 3 in probably 3 bites.  But they had some decent flavor as well.  All in all, if you're at the Red Rock and craving a burger, I would recommend this place.  You can find better burgers in Vegas, but this one is good enough if you're in Summerlin and want a decent burger.

3006377,2011-05-09,0,B7XwqO9Lbzq-VtOiRobfCg,"If you're looking for a good burger, this is the place to eat. I've been to LBS a couple times with my boyfriend and, although the service was a little slow the first time, it was friendly and the food was great.

Atmosphere: Very laid back. Not too loud. There are a few televisions which generally have sports on. The ceiling is done in license plates as are sections of the wall. The booths are cushy and leather and line one side of the restaurant while there are tables down the center and the bar is to the left as one walks in. The waitstaff sports shirts that look like they've been lifted from truckers.

Food: The place is known for their twister which is like a Godzilla-sized ribbon of connected potato chip. It comes with a creamy, slightly spicy dip which really brings the flavor to the party. After appetizers, you have your choice of burger - build your own or choose one of the predefined combinations. LBS certainly doesn't slouch on the flavor combinations. Last visit, I had the Frenchie which comes with horseradish, wild mushrooms, sprouts, and brie. You can also get your burgers in turkey or veggie if beef isn't your style. I asked for mine medium more on the pink side and that is exactly what I received. The fanciness of the food is an interesting and unexpected counterpoint to the ambience, but both are done well. The only potential gripe I might have is the portion sizes are ridiculous, I can never finish what I order and the price runs between $11-15 for a burger and fries. They do have sweet potato fries though and I'm a sucker for those. The only way they could be better is if they had the maple bacon sauce from Yardhouse for dipping.

Overall, this is a solid place. If the portions were a little more reasonable or a little less expensive and if their hours weren't wonky (they tend to close early), it would have been a 5 for me. Really, I'd even bump it to 4 1/2 if I could. Definitely worth the trip.",bWzl8y3rE_l9QdEOQMFvew,0,0,4,iztZqaT7PnE-f6hESPS1tA

3014582,2010-02-18,0,B7XwqO9Lbzq-VtOiRobfCg,"We heard about it on the Fox5 news one morning and decided to give it a shot. we haven't been to the Burger Bar at Mandalay yet and wanted to see what the newer place had to offer first. Since the news team gave this place rave reviews, we figured it would be worth the trip to Red Rock Casinos to try it out.

We walked in and noticed this interesting decor comprised of dark wood floors and black furniture. The light fixtures are nouveau and very clean, and the ceiling is made of license plates. It's quite an interesting place to eat, and we were excited to see the menu.

They keep it simple, with one suggestion of burger called ""The Perfect Burger"", as well as other options and a build-your-own burger. They jokingly have a ""Wish"" burger for $125 dollars consisting of ""a bun and wishing you had some meat"". Very clever. The appetizers are true to a burger shop: chicken wings, onion rings, fries, and other goodies. They have milkshakes and service simple desserts of cupcakes, pie, and cheesecake.

I ordered their perfect burger as is, going with my server's suggestion of ""a little pink"". Their meat is 21 day dry aged beef patties, although it doesn't state what type of meat it is. I assume by the taste and texture it was sirloin.

Unfortunately the appetizers came out the same time as our meal, so we didn't finish out potato twister, which is a bunch of potato chips fried together in one clump. It's a potato version of monkey bread, and quite amusing to eat. Their fry sauce is nice and has just enough heat and sweetness. The burger is 1/2 pounds, so if you are a light eater, better order one for two people. At a price tag of 15.95, it is worth the money because the meat itself is juicier and tastes very good. You can tell the meat is prime.

Here's the sad part--the perfect burger comes with a lot of toppings, so if you are one to eat a burger for the flavor of the meat, do not order this. The guyere cheese is good, the applewood smoked bacon cooked perfect, and the onion relish is slightly sweet and smoky. It overpowered everything the meat has to offer, and when you are out to eat a dry-aged prime beef patty, you don't want the extras to drown the taste of the meat itself. Although it's a good burger, it was too much for my tastebuds and the meat was lost in the relish and cheese. I ended up pulling the patty out and eating it by itself to enjoy that dry aged goodness.

We also ordered chicken fingers that were refried. I know most people cannot tell, but I can, and the refrying dried out one of the strips and took out a good part of its coating--and they still served it to us.

We took a doggie bag to look nice, but threw it out immediately outside of the restaurant. It wasn't worth the 60 dollar price tag for lunch.

Fair food, good tasting patty, but with the fixings and that house sauce, it's murders the beef--and that beef is the reason why you pay 15 dollars a burger.

If you are the type to love the meat, don't eat anything but a plain patty inbetween their egg bun. If you like those neat toppings, it's a place for you. I hate to say this, but as a lover of red meat, this place made me sad. I feel that they don't know just how great they have it with their prime beef patties, and I feel like they don't appreciate their customers because their decor says it all--posh. If I wasn't dressed the way that I was, I may have received better service.

I'll pay 15 dollars for a great burger, but not here. Not at LBS ever again.

But you should try it for the experience",o68A_3bAJTge-ioGXHdxKA,1,0,2,mA5NhtzY1WZcthezqmYGGQ

The bartenders here also take their craft serious, even inventing some of their own signature drinks. The one thing I wish they served here was a reasonable fish or steak dinner.

Items ordered:

- Potato Twisters:  It was fun to see a huge pile of carby-goodness.  A bit of a smokey taste.  If you like a softer version of kettle chips, this one is for you. 

- Southwest Chicken Salad:  Nothing spectacular.  The lettuce which composed most of the salad was a bit bitter.  It would've been better if more of the ""other"" items listed on the menu were present.

- Mini burger sampler:  
The turkey burger was tastiest of all 3 (IMO).
Beef burger was standard for a sit down restaurant.  
Ahi burger didn't have enough ahi.  It was two thin slices.  So, you were biting mostly into bread.  

- Captain Hook Burger (Fried Cod):  The crust was very salty, but the crispiness of the fish was excellent. I didn't care for the sweet relish.

- Iced Tea:  perfect.... freshly brewed 


Service:  very slow (They need to hire a runner to deliver the food to the tables... especially since they sold over 1000 GroupOn deals.)

Price:  Pricier than Smash Burger for about the same quality just nicer ambiance

Ambiance:  A fun place to go on a casual date.  Cute decor (contemporary cowboy?)  The booths are great for really tall people.  For short people like me, it felt like I saw sinking in the seat and had to sit up to reach the table.   

I would only go back for the turkey burger & the shoe string fries, but I'd have to get some kind of deal because their prices are just more than many of the other restaurants around town.",vY-tZRltKhp4AZN3yEr10w,1,0,2,SIEpzEMezFA9dyNFTUaiDA

3257823,2012-02-27,3,B7XwqO9Lbzq-VtOiRobfCg,"Where do I start?

First of all I've waited over a week for LBS Burger to get back to me on this issue to fairly give them to resolve this issue but I have heard nothing.  They have no email on their website and the phone number that they have to reach them is always busy.  I contacted then on facebook and got an acknowledgement that it would be forwarded on, but never heard back.   We wanted to make sure that the issue, a person, was gone so we could maybe come back sometime as regular patrons.  Now I am leaving my honest review of actual events that occurred during our last visit.   I am leaving names out of this review.

First of all, our family used to absolutely love this place.  Usually LBS Burger is a place where my family went and we always had good service and food.  However, last time we visited was far from what we expected.

We arrived at LBS Burger at 8:35pm to celebrate a special occasion.  We were promptly seated at approximately 8:40pm in the back of the restaurant.  It was a party of 5, with two adults and three children.  Our first encounter with our server - bald young adult with black earlobe rings (who was later identified by the General Manager) was less than pleasant off the bat.  He greeted us with a non-energetic and non-professional and ""What's up?"" for our drink orders.  We brushed it off.

We ordered a water, a diet coke and three root beers for our children.  A few minutes later, our food order was taken.  We proceeded to receive our drinks and eat our appetizers: potato twisters and fried cheese curds.  We had requested extra sauce for the potato twisters but did not receive it.

We quickly ran out of drinks and sauce and we tried to get the attention of our server for over 20 minutes.  We pleaded for help from a red haired server who seemed less than interested and then we finally went caught the person from the front desk that seats people when he was seating a new table.

Our server continued to ignore us and the desk person which was standing by our table trying to flag him down.  It was blatantly obvious that it was done on purpose.  When we finally got our server back, we again ask for drinks and refills.

His response ""Alriiight, alriiight, alriiiight"" - like we were old friends, but we are not.  He takes the two cups from my children and my wife hands helpfully hands him the third cup. He proceeds to rudely snatch it from her and walk away. Which completely caught  us off guard.  At this point it had been over 30 minutes since we initially needed drinks.

I had had enough from this point.  I found the manager to complain and ask for a new server.  While this was happening our server found his way from the back of the restaurant (where the kitchen and our table was) to the front where I was and stared me down and shoved into my shoulder with his shoulder as he walked pass.  Right in front of the manager!

The manager sent the server to the back and apologized to me as the server went to the back of the restaurant while I was still at the front.    While the server was walking to the back again he said to my wife and children ""F**k you!""

My wife decided it was time for us to leave and we did promptly.  Again, the manager was apologetic and gave me his card and told me he was going to take care of the server with HR as soon as he could.  The time on my watch now was 9:30pm - it kind of wasted our night out.

The worst part was running back to our vehicle from the restaurant - not knowing where the server was.  We were actually fearing for our lives at this point until we could leave the Casino property.

It was very inappropriate with the bad service that we received from the server and the fact that he aggressively snatched a cup from my wife, then proceeded to AGGRESSIVELY TOUCH A CUSTOMER - shove into me with his shoulder while staring me down and then curse at my family at the table.  I tried to contact LBS Burger to follow up and make sure that this employee was dealt with appropriately, but they have been silent.

Never again.

Ambience is strange. The staff seems a bit punker/ hardcore but the actual decoration seems more country western/ frontier oriented. It's not particularly nice looking inside but don't judge a book by its cover.

They do have an excellent beer selection if you happen to be a beer snob like me. Some fine choices like Delirium Tremens, Chimay, and Duvel can be ordered at the bar although they're hardly cheap.  I had a Duvel to compliment my burger.

The fries were decent but hardly different from the shoestring fries you can find at any Yardhouse. They did however, come with a delectable little sauce (aioli I think?). It's better than ketchup.

The burgers themselves were as good as I could have hoped. I ordered the Caliente on wheat-- it was served over pepperjack cheese, slathered in chipotle mayo and topped with sliced jalapenos. As far as spicy burgers go, this is the best I've ever tasted--- better than the one I had at Fukuburger. The beef itself was perfectly cooked to medium rare and was just dripping with deliciousness. This is probably the best burger I've eaten to date in Las Vegas. whlie my spicy burger was nothing new to the burger world, my girlfriends order was a real gem that I think anyone should try. The Caprese comes with leafy greens, pesto, and mozarella cheese, all squeezed into a ciabatta bun. It made for a very unique burger eating experience that proved to be surprisingly delicious.

All the burgers are huge and delicious. The sweet potato fries are also a must. What prompted me to write this review after my last visit wasn't the food but the service. The last time I was at Red Rock Casino we actually ate at Hachi next door to LBS. but had to get a takeout order of chicken tenders for our son who wouldn't eat anything at Hachi. The hostesses at LBS were so nice that when our order was ready they walked it over to us at Hachi. The manager even gave our kid a free cup of milk later. The staff over there is incredibly friendly and LBS is a great place to go with or without kids.,C2C0GPKvzWWnP57Os9eQ0w,3,1,4,y6MDd_bNsG3dMaM4Ia1z-g

Wouldn't it be great if everything the Red Rock had to offer was as great as Yardhouse? Unfortunately, this is not the case. 

Take LBS - a rather high priced burger joint that doesn't have that great of burgers. The burgers are not bad, they definitely go down well. But at $12 to $13 for a burger, I expect better.

Now I will applaud their Potato Twisters - they're one HOT side. The fresh-cut curly chips with sliced jalapenos and fry sauce will curl your 'pota-toes'.

Everything I had there was extremely delicious, and I could not think of a place with a better burger off the top of my head. The staff was pretty friendly and courteous, and the wait was short and we received our food very quickly. One small note, bring a sweater. It can get pretty cold in there with the steel tables and the booth seats are not very comfortable. But whatever, on to the food. 

My friend and I each ordered a burger with sweet potato fries, but it didn't really matter after we had scarfed down half of the Spicy Potato Twisters. I am an extreme chili head and this was the perfect aide to my addiction. It is covered in this amazing ghost chili sauce that is HOT! but not deathly hot. And the flavor with the nacho cheese is almost orgasmic (sorry, I just really like spicy food). We ended up taking about half of these home (which were instantly demolished by my dad). The heat was still lingering by the time we got our burgers, so we had to cool down for a bit to enjoy the taste of what was to come.

The Burgers ($11 and $13, I believe):
- The Longhorn: My friend got this pulled pork and coleslaw burger. I would usually never get this type of burger, as I am not a fan of pulled pork, but this was indeed something great. I felt like a real cowboy eating this smokey deliciousness. If this is your style of burger, this would be a great addition to your selection.
- The Perfect Burger: When the heat from the twisters finally subsided and I got to enjoy my own burger, I was immediately sent back to a heavenly place. The red onion marmalade on this burger just catapulted it to the best burger I have had in recent memory. I ordered mine ""medium rare"" and you could see the juices just dripping down the burger when I pressed down mixing with the beautiful Gruyere cheese. 

The price is fair for the quality of food you are receiving at this place. It really shows that the chefs take time and attention when creating your dishes. If we did not order the Bailey's Oreo Shake (+$11), our bill would have come to around $40 with all the substitutions of the fries (+$2.50/ea.) and adding the ghost pepper salsa (+$3) to the potato twisters (which were free when checking in to Yelp). 

I really wish this place would get locations away from Summerlin. It is such a far drive from my side of town in Southwest Vegas. I hope they open one up in the M Resort (I would be there every day).

Had the standard fries, which were hot ,crispy and seasoned just right.

Unfortunately the service wasn't that good. Even though it was fairly empty, hostess wasn't that happy giving me a booth. Service was very slow, but friendly.

Atmosphere was a relaxing change from the hectic casino. But the booth seat was too low, especially compared to the table (and I'm 6').

I sat at the bar as usual and ordered my usual drink: ice tea.  They did not have a special happy hour menu.  Instead, it was 50% off all appetizers, salds, and burgers (except the ""build your own burger"" option).  I hoped they had sweet potato fries appetizer, but alas no.  Instead, I opted for the onion rings, southwest chicken salad, and slider sampler (one beef, turkey, and ahi tuna slider).  The food took awhile to come out, but the bartender was good at keeping my ice filled, in spite of a rather full bar.

When the food finally arrived, the portions were decent, especially at the happy hour prices!  The beef slider was a bit dry, but the turkey and ahi tuna sliders were delicious!  The onion rings were a bit salty, but otherwise good.  The best dish, however, was the southwest salad.  It was prepared just the way I like: not too much dressing.  You could actually taste the ingredients such as the romaine and cilantro and not just the dressing.  The salad also had a nice spicey kick at the end.  Very nicely done.  I left stuffed and ice tea logged and the damage was only $20 with tax and tip!  Definitely a happy hour worth revisiting!  

BTW, as I left I saw a sign for an eating challenge: a 6 patty burger with hot peppers and fries that you havve 60 minutes to finish.  Something to keep in mind for all you big eaters out there!",gqpnDoFx42U5NdtejYfKOg,2,0,4,PQa5nmfabeRNH_GsK2MZ5A

First off this place is pricey. I mean for a burger to pay $15 it better knock my socks off. Also they want you to pay $7 for beer? I'm from Utah where we have to pay higher prices because they tax the hell out of it but it still is rarely as expensive as it was here. Total bill for two burgers and two beers was $52. Was it worth it? Yes and no but mostly no. 

We started with the fried pickles that were very good. For my burger I went with the perfect burger my wife the classic. We liked them both. I say LIKED because it wasn't anything mind blowing. Good yes but not great. The potato twisters were the best thing we had here so be sure to get those. They are basically home made potato chips and they give you a mountain of them. 

Overall it was a good experience. But the value just isn't there for me. Good but not really memorable food priced as great food drops the rating for LBS in my book.",k0MzpdtOO9vJktXjYbGxSQ,0,0,2,fRH_ZuQMP835--ajfiYMqQ

LBS delivered on the burgers - good quality meat cooked right, freshly made buns, several cheese choices (Gruyère - yum!), good produce and condiments. The ""fresh cut"" fries were just ok, but the onion rings were outstanding. Add in a full bar, and LBS really cooked.

Now as to the gimmick - everyone named Johnny or Junior or whatever, over-thought-out decor - I was unimpressed. I'm sure the idea was to roll this out across all Station properties, but I think if they just kept the menu and reconsidered how the gimmick played out, they might have a hit chain instead.

For now, considering LBS is inside the Red Rock, patrons have a choice between a very good $3.50 Fatburger and $9.00+ burger at LBS. Is the $7 (plus tip) worth the better sit-down experience? In this case, I think so.",eRbrl47hjvCWeMTnkntI3w,0,0,3,TZBYL2VfntT1aAk4d1qqlA

Fat Girl Friendly: YES! 
tables, ample booths & sturdy seating

Drinks: Wide selection of hand crafted cocktails and shots. Plus as an upscale sports bar, they have a good selection of beer, both on tap and bottled. BUT, for me, where they shine is in their Bloody Mary menu. By far my favorite in all of Vegas. And if you could see my FB Bloody Mary album you'd know I've tried them everywhere. 
My personal favorite is the Something About Cucumber. Made with muddled cucumber and agave nectar, it is about as perfect as I've ever found a Bloody Mary. My manwhore likes the Pork N Mary which is made with Black Grouse (a scotch) Southern Comfort lime & garnished with bacon. In fact before we hit the tables/slots we stop and get 2 Bloody's to go. they are that good.

Food: The appetizers are typical sports bar food. Irish Nachos (cross cut potatoes with sour cream, cheese etc melted over them) mini pretzels (our favorite), Buffalo Chicken Dip are all good choices and are great for sharing. 
But lets get to their main reason for being called LBS in the 1st place. 
Burgers: After many tries, we have settled on our favorites. 
The Perfect Burger: cooked to perfection and then garnished with an onion marmalade that will make you wanna slap your mama. No really I do think my sons hit me (with love) on the shoulder and say ""That's a dayam good burger"" 
The Caprese: Just what it implies. Perfectly cooked burger garnished with a beefsteak tomato & buffalo mozzarella, drizzled with EVOO & an aged balsamic. 

The UP UP side of this is that you can have a beef burger OR a turkey burger OR a house made Vegan patty which is by far the best vegan burger I've ever had. 

Staff is very friendly and the entire place is surrounded by walls & ceilings of old license plates giving it a modernized retro feel.

My burgers were a bit dry, but the highlight of the lunch was the zuchinni fries! I remember not liking the potato crisps last time, so I am really glad I went with the zuchinni. It was not over cooked and still crispy! Yummy deliciousness. I didn't try my husband's burger, but I would assume it was delicious since it was gone by the end of the meal. 

Lunch came out to be about 35 bucks? Was it worth $35 bucks, probably not but the Groupon helped. Service was ok, lacking in the beginning but it was better at the end.

They have several side options, from regular fries, to sweet potato fries, to homemade chips. They each come with their fry sauce, which seems like some sort of spicy ranch. It is pretty good. 

It does lose a star because there is only two ways to get your meat cooked: pink, or no pink. There is no ""a little pink"" option.",wkHDQZMITEePnBKlzFcnRg,1,0,4,n1NAeXM5a8FyAm2heNS_dg

4573118,2010-11-03,0,B7XwqO9Lbzq-VtOiRobfCg,"LBS Burger is a great addition to the burger community of Las Vegas. The biggest attractions of this place are definitely the aged meat and ambiance.

First, LBS Burger looks like an irish pub combined with a steampunk man cave, VERY AWESOME. The tables against the wall are close to plush leather and add to the awesome, dark lit, classic rock ambiance. I sort of feel at home with the decor and staff...reminiscent of the Hard Rock moniker of ""love all, serve all"" with the fellow tattooed and pierced.

Next, the burgers get my vote for best in Las Vegas. The aged beef takes the burger over the threshold from great to outstanding. Burgers taste like an aged steak: light earthiness, soft bite, and the burger buns are fluffy. I suggest ordering a bacon bleu cheese burger with onion rings, perfect mix of savory and sweet. Also try the adult milkshakes, very awesome.

Service is friendly, quick, and pointed my party in the right direction when it came to suggestions.

I definitely recommend this place to EVERYONE!! Please check this place out simply for the look of the place, stay for the burgers, and it helps that they have Yelp specials constantly.",YDkC5VVT8s9NlIZtAr8NUA,1,1,5,OEyZVcY-5sJmd-mC_D464A

It seems to be the only moderately priced restaurant in Red Rock (one that isn't fast food but isn't $30+ for entrees).  I had the sampler plate of sliders and a plate of onion rings.  Buddy had the Smokehouse burger and fries.  Ok, so I know sliders are supposed to be small but these sliders were miniscule.  I could finish one in about two medium sized bites.  Seriously.  If I really tried, I could've maybe fit an entire one in my mouth.  And no matter what others may say, my mouth is not that big.   :P  So I had to pace myself and take tiny bites because I didn't want to be done before my friend was even a quarter of the way through her burger.  

Taste:
Sampler plate of sliders - C+  
- Beef: Best of the three.  A good combination of patty, sauce, and grilled onion.
- Turkey: Normally I love turkey burgers.  This one was just meh.  The meat was overcooked and too dry so it was hard to taste anything else.
- Ahi Tuna: Interesting to taste it in a burger form.  The big bun outweighed delicate tuna.  Could barely taste the tuna.

Onion rings - B+
Perfectly crisp.  Just a tiny bit greasy.  Portion was huge compared to the sliders.

Smokehouse burger - A-
Friend LOVED it.  Finished the entire thing.  Might be the most I've seen her eat.  Ever.

Fries - B
Her burger came with fries which I had the pleasure of stealing.  Good fries.  But not particularly memorable.

Service - C-
Even though the restaurant was practically empty everything took a really long time.  Our waiter seemed distracted and was not very attentive.

If I ever go back I'll order a proper burger and try the warm pretzel sticks.  Who can resist pretzel dipped in cheese???",vkTlI0k3HqS1axQS1z8whg,2,1,3,7GpF8_6p_O9JclwhIOpziQ

Issue 1: We asked for a booth, but we literally SANK into it. My 6'2 boyfriend looked like a child sitting across from me because he was sitting so low. We promptly asked to be moved to a table. This was WEIRD. Don't you think they would fix the booths, or make the tables lower, or SOMETHING? 

Issue 2: We asked for our burgers to be medium. To me that means a little pink... when our burgers arrived both were definitely medium rare, and VERY pink. We were fine with them, but it's definitely not what we ordered. 

Issue 3: My man orders the potato twists (or whatever they are called on the menu) - we were never told what they were, so we both assumed they were curly fries. Definitely not - more like curly potato chips. They were good, but he ended up eating all MY fries cause that's what he really wanted. On the plus side, we didn't pay for these cause we ""checked in"" and they were comped. 

Issue 4: The final bill was a little more than we expected. For burgers, I'd expect to pay around $30ish... we walked out paying $54 (NO alcohol, including tip). For $54, I could have gone some place nicer.

Great Things about this place:

The burgers had GREAT flavor, and unique options. You can order any burger chicken, beef, or vegetarian, which is a nice option. They have sweet potato fries which are my FAVORITE, and the fry sauce rocked.

I really liked the Potato Twisters though! It was a huge portion, big enough for 3-4 to share. We couldn't finish it actually, so all the Yelpers did during the bowling UYE afterwards lol. Good flavor here too...wish they had a fry sauce or something to dip them in vs ketchup though.

It was a very large burger (seemed to be in the 1/3rd pound to 1/2 pound neighborhood) and fairly priced at $9. Their cheese options blew me away! I got brie on my burger and they weren't stingy at all.. my burger was covered in melty gooey brie.. I was in heaven. They also included sprouts at no extra cost - a nice touch. The bun was soft and delicious!! They had a nice array of sauces to choose from, too, but the brie and juicy burger required no sauce . Skinny fries were great.

We ordered it the usual medium rare but that's not what we got. They were closing in 30 minutes when we got there so we just sucked it up and ate the burger anyway. We also got the potato twisters because I love these things. They're like homemade potato chips...crisp and hot.  We also got a virgin Chunky Monkey shake (bananas, peanut butter malt) - too sweet.

The service was ok. This is 3-3.5 stars in my book. It's ok and probably #10 out 10 on my best burger in Vegas list.",tH0uKD-vNwMoEc3Xk3Cbdg,2,2,3,Dz-5COypTBvmXF1n-Kv0Kg

5361321,2012-05-13,0,B7XwqO9Lbzq-VtOiRobfCg,"**Summary**
       - Plain - The burgers seemed plain and without any personality. The burger patties seemed flavorless and generic.
       - Overcooked - The wings and sliders seemed way over cooked. We had to add ketchup to the sliders to make them edible.
       - Decor - The decor was interesting. The walls and ceilings were plastered with license plates. The whole place had a rugged route 66 feeling.
**Ordered**
       - Warm Sourdough Pretzel Sticks - They were just bite sized pretzels. Warm and fluffy, but sub par compared to an actual pretzel place.
       - Buffalo Chicken Wings - Dry
       - Peanut Butter & Bacon Burger - It was the burger of the month so I tried it. Other than the peanut butter and bacon, there is nothing else on the burger. It was definitely interesting having the peanut butter, but other than that, it was beyond plain (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/B7XwqO9Lbzq-VtOiRobfCg?select=DDcAooDJx4quFJz-S0OHUA#DDcAooDJx4quFJz-S0OHUA).
       - Beef Sliders - The mini patties were way over cooked. They were just hockey pucks of dryness.
**Recommendations**
       - I wouldn't recommend this place. It seems like an overpriced burger join that has dry and boring burgers.",37S80IUIfb8yMsSwWWDsFA,1,1,2,QSw0ZLVOTCl-ZE-jfQpczg

Hostess was great, helped us out with our large last minute party.
Our waiter (Tomas), was attentive and did a good job.

Yelp check in offer rocked, the table swarmed the Potato Twisters, they were really good. I love fresh made chips, I'd go back just for those. I could do shots of their Fry Sauce.

I got the Perfect Burger, medium, it was good, cooked perfectly. I guess I was expecting more, it just didn't  Wow! me.  It seemed a little greasy. I loved the roasted tomato and herb mayo (of course). Subbed out the fries for the Onion Rings, they were big and crunchy, not greasy, the onion didn't pull out when you bite it, thats a big test that they passed with flying colors.
Everyone seemed to like their food, but no one did the "" MMMM! roll the eyes, this is sooo good"" move. So that tells me alot. I got to sample my friends Sweet Potato Fries, they were good, crisp, not soggy or greasy.

The service was slow and the burgers were dry.  We did get the free twister but it wasn't anything special.  Just tasted like overly dried chips.  My other half ordered a burger with egg in it and asked for well done on the egg---well...he took one bite and SPLASH...the yolk busted and went all over his shirt!  *Sigh*...so all in all we didn't like it.

The burger was delicious.  it was juicy and fresh.  The topping were very good. We asked for the burger to be on the rarer side of medium but it came out more on the well done side.  The Zucchini fries were ok.  Very greasy, but apparently they are healthier than fresh fries.  We were too late to try a shake as the kitchen closed.

I ordered the Longhorn Burger, but the party I went with had a good mix of burger types (we are not opposed to sharing bites).  Everything we had was absolutely delicious.  The wait was minimal on a Saturday night.  Our server was very friendly.  The ""bite for your buck"" is definitely on par (mound of fries).

I ordered the hot wings which were pretty good.  Nice little crunch.  I also had the sampler slider platter and was not impressed as I was last time with the burgers.  The tuna slider was good, although a little too much ""mayo"" from the slaw that came on top of it.  The beef slider was too dry and had little flavor.  The worst was the turkey slider, it just was awful.  I found it sad because I had the full size turkey burger and loved it, but this was just inedible for me.  I tried putting some veggies or something on it to give it more flavor but  I still couldn't finish it.  

My husband had the cheese curds which for me were disappointing but he liked them.  Good cheese curds are supposed to be with cheddar cheese (like the ones in Wisconsin),  but these were like mini mozzarella cheese sticks.

I don't typically order turkey burgers but I had just had a beef burger elsewhere and wanted something different.  The turkey burger did not disappoint.  I love the toppings on it - slaw, avocado, etc.  And the onion rings and waffle fries were delicious.  Nice and crispy.

Huge portions though so beware or you won't have room for your meal.  They have many creative burgers and the prices are reasonable.  Add to that the adult milkshakes and excellent preparation, this is a diamond in the rough.  The only thing keeping this from being 5 star is the atmosphere.

We showed up at LBS to grab dinner before the weezer show at red rock's pool. Arrived at 7 and were told it would be an hour wait for a party of 6. I recommend making a reservation even though its just a burger joint. They seem to just seat people at whatever table happens to be open. There was a party of 4 at a table for 6, party of 3 at one of the big booths, etc.

We finally heard our name called, then the hostess said give me a few minutes to get the table ready, so it was over 5 min waiting more. I found that really odd - to me, you shouldn't call for a table unless you're ready to seat them. 

I let the server know we were in a hurry, she said it's about 20 min for the kitchen to get orders out. So ok, I got the adult creamsicle milkshake $8.50 and the ""perfect burger"" - burger with bacon, gruyere, frisee, roasted tomato, onion marmalade, herb mayo and their LBS sauce $13.75

Milkshake took about 15 min to come out even though the bar didn't look that hectic, but it was worth the wait - tastes just like a creamsicle you hardly taste the alcohol. Burger came out 5 min later and although I wouldn't call it perfect, it was a damn good burger. Burger was juicy and cooked perfectly medium, bacon was pretty thick but the texture was wrong - rather hard and chewy, not crispy like bacon should be. The marmalade, LBS sauce and mayo overwhelmed the flavor of the burger itself, too many condiments also made it messy to eat. 

Onion rings and shoestring fries were average - onion ring was crispy but the inside was mushy like it was overcooked. Texture was almost like burger king's rings. Potato twister was good, but I was kind of surprised they were just potato chips. I assumed twister meant curly fries, but whatever. They were fresh potato chips, the twister aspect is to me a negative because anytime you went to pick up one chip, you had to break it off of a big cluster of chips. I did the check in offer for the free potato twister and the server brought us 2 orders since I didn't know someone else had ordered one too. Weird that she just assumed we wanted 2 instead of asking - it was way too much so we barely touched the 2nd order. 

The decor was cool and fun - I'm in love with the black lace windows. Cool light fixtures, an American flag made up of painted license plates on the ceiling. I don't know if the acoustics are funky, but that was easily the loudest restaurant I've ever been to. Its a smallish room but there was no obnoxiously loud table, just regular dinner conversation. I've never been to a restaurant where I had to nearly shout to someone only 1 person away from me. There was just a constant annoying buzz of the conversations going on at other tables, I kind of just gave on talking to anyone besides the people directly next and across from me.",dsaj_eA71FvpUh49zzKcGA,2,0,2,v3cHgG6G9OF4qJ1teDidlQ

Good for us!  So I was hungry for a burger and thought I would check this place out.  When I got to the restaurant it was full and lively. It had a good atmosphere and the staff seemed both laidback and friendly. In fact when I walked in I noticed a large steer head mounted to the wall. This in and of it self is not too shocking as it matches a the rustic western decor but, it was bright red and lit up. One has to wonder what are they trying to tell me... Nothing here but, steers and... good burgers I hope.

I opted to sit at the bar so I could turn around the meal quicker and the bartender (blonde female and I can't remember her name) was friendly and helpful. I decided to go with the steak-burger off their signature plates menu which was in the end a good choice.  The burger patty was big juicy and was crusted with peppercorns. It was topped off with mushrooms, swiss cheese, tomato, greens, red onion, and a horseradish sauce.  It tasted like a great steak and the horseradish sauce really came through. Funny enough the highlight came in after I took a few bites of the burger!  They serve fries with a dipping sauce on the side of all the burgers.  I have no idea what they put in the sauce but, it cant be legal.  Next time I am going to grab a regular burger and pour this all over it.  And ask for a second for my fries ;-) .

5821101,2013-06-21,2,B7XwqO9Lbzq-VtOiRobfCg,"This is a cool little burger joint located in the Red Rock Casino Resort & Spa. We were looking to find a somewhere to eat before our movie and stumbled upon this place.

The decor is nice and very ""American"". The ceiling is lined in white license plates and there's even an American flag hanging on the ceiling made out of license plates as well. All the servers are dressed in mechanic shirts and there's a huge, multi-colored steer hanging by the bar. You literally sink into the booths...they are super comfy. I dig it. 

I checked in on Foursquare (sssssh!) and received a free domestic beer with the purchase of an entree. I looked at their list and selected Sam Adams, however I was a little perturbed when the server said ""the coupon is only good for Bud Light"". Hmm, it doesn't say that on the coupon, but I wasn't gonna argue. Free is free.

We ordered the warm sourdough pretzel sticks and cheese fondue to start. Decent size for $6.50. They are exactly like P.T.'s pretzel bites but beat their $9 price. They were yummy and the cheese fondue was tasty. My man got the Spicy Potato Twisters. These were a steal for $5 because the portion was HUGE...I mean, bigger than his head (and that's big. lol). I don't care for spicy but he loved them. The ghost pepper chili sauce satisfied his constant need for heat. P.S. these were featured on the show ""Heat Seekers"" on the Food Network. Cool!

We then shared the ""Bacon & Egg"" burger because we had already consumed so much food. The burger was delicious and perfectly cooked. The bacon was crunchy and the egg wasn't runny (which I like). I am not a fan of their buns here though. They are really dense and take away from the flavor of everything else. I so wish they had Fuddrucker buns. Then this would be heaven on a plate. Regardless, at $11.95 this burger cost the same price as a Red Robin burger and I'd definitely choose this place over them! The white American cheese was a nice touch and their fries were plentiful. I liked the skin that they left on them!

Cool small burger joint, super decoration and friendly greeter. After the 30 minute wait we were seated. We were served 2 glasses of water which would be fine apart from there were 4 of us?? One beer, one Chardonnay and a soda were served about 7/8 minutes after order. One of my kids ordered a milk shake, it was excellent but took at least 15 minutes to arrive. My guess is they went outside to milk the cow, pasteurized the milk before putting it in the blender.
After 20 minutes the 2 kids meals arrived, chicken tenders and shoestring ( lukewarm ) fries. Another 10 minutes before the parents burgers arrived. I order the bacon/egg burger. Good not fantastic. Wifey had another burger (only burgers on menu) and had similar views.

Location:
Tucked away inside Red Rock, unless you were looking for it specifically, you would miss it completely. It may be just me but I try to avoid eating at places located inside the resorts. Parking is usually an issues and the price points are usually higher than if it was located outside on its own. Ok enough about why I dislike resort restaurants. 


Service:
Friendly staff on both trips here however I think the lack of customers each time contributed to the extra attention. Anyhow +1 for their attentiveness. We never had to flag anyone down nor ask for refills or service. Equally impressive on both visits the managers came by our booth to chat about the service and food. 


Food:
Holy moley this place is expensive! Most of the burgers are around the $12. I'm not cheap (don't judge because of the Groupon) but for that price I'd expect the burger to be made with Kobe Beef. I guess the value comes from the fancy toppings and the fact that it's inside the resort on the main floor. 

The first trip I had the Perfect Burger which was decent but didn't wow me. For me the gruyere cheese was a miss. The funky cheese was too much for me and overpowered the burger. 

On the second trip I had the Steakhouse. Nothing too fancy about this one just a dressed up burger.  

 
With all of the burger boutiques in town, this one is kind of a dark horse entry. The food is decent but with all of the competition in the area and the location inside Red Rock. If fancy American style burgers are your niche then this is the place for you.

Okay, bad, even sad, but true.  When I first ate here in 2010, it was the first time I saw burgers priced so steep.  Little did I know that supremely good quality burgers joints were coming hard, coming my way, and I was more ready than I knew.

AMBIANCE -- Dark, TV's with sports, brick, and grit -- you'll want to wear your running shoes, cowboy hat, and leather motorcycle jacket.  It's a cool hang, and isn't Vegas-y (that's really good, unless you're looking for it).  If it was a bigger place, it would be a bigger splash in Vegas and Summerlin, but because it isn't -- it's cozy.  It's an upscale, biker-bar, country-western saloon with football!

MENU & MY FAVORITES -- The burgers are massive (1/2 pound variety).  They range in price from $9.75 to $13.75.  I love the 2 most pricey ones: The ""Perfect Burger"" & the ""Steakhouse Burger"".
- Perfect: Beef, gruyere, bacon, herbed mayo, oven-roasted tomato, and a red-onion marmalade
- Steakhouse: Peppered crusted beef, grilled wild mushrooms, Swiss, oven-roasted tomato 

Accompany them with:
- Potato Twisters (gotta try these at least once, it's a potato-marvel -- one very long and continuous fry).
- For Wisconsin visitors, they have fried cheese curds!
- NOT the cheesy tator-tots (they are not carried any longer, I am mad.  They RULED the universe at one time, obviously, they've since been overthrown).
- The fries are also great, and the onion rings.  
- But if you have to pick only one, I'd pick the tots (but of course, they don't have them!  Managers...take note!)

HAPPY HOUR (3p-6p, M-F) -- $4 drafts and 50% off all apps, mmmm sliders! 

SERVICE -- friendly and casual, prompt and efficient.  Nice, too!

CONCLUSION -- While not the best burger, it's no doubt good.  I used to live just a few short blocks away, and NEVER went to LBS unless I had a business meeting at the hotel, or was there to drop in a few bucks. So, if you happen to be at Red Rock -- step on in.",ZIOCmdFaMIF56FR-nWr_2A,3,1,3,e8EVVUXNpzFHfEKq9MGa3Q

If you sit at the bar you can almost always count on having instant and impressive service, but both times I have sat at a table, the server was a C+ both times. 

The turkey burger is under seasoned, but the bleu burger was pretty darn good- can't go wrong with blue cheese and bacon on a burger! Not a fan of shoe string fries, but they were good for what they were. 

They do have a good selection of beers and surprisingly good wings, so if you just want to catch a game and have an app and a beer, not a bad place do to in Red Rock, but wouldn't travel there to do so.

Also whatever you do, DO NOT order a dirty martini here, awful!",FOFKuCoclgR0zAlVe7i1Zg,2,0,2,0NekPHj3L9IlQDkRubC_iw

We noticed a check-in offer and immediately started noshing on our free order of Twister Potatoes. These were fantastic, oily salty potatoes from heaven. If only they didn't totally ruin my appetite before my burger even came out. I ordered the Caliente with onion rings and my dining companion ordered his burger with the skinny fries, so that we could sample both options. I was big fan of my rings. Delicious. My burger was cooked perfectly and there was just the right amount of heat. I do wish that the patty was slightly less salty and that the bottom bun didn't get so soggy, which made it a little hard to eat with my hands. I ended up just eating my patty with a knife and fork, since I was already feeling super full from the Twisters. 

Definitely an ok burger and I'd recommend it if you're in the area, just don't make a special trip.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,2,1,3,cXPn6Ou3zMvaNtPId1mnWw

New order came promptly and were fresh. Didn't really love the western themed atmosphere but to each their own.,eectGb7-g_Xx7ftGqxr5bg,0,0,4,dxjJGlZKMn_t1TGeaJ_zqQ
