Limited seating, which fills up fast. A couple customers were literally just standing up around tables eating.

They do give you free chips with your meal and salsa, but the worst of all is getting chips from an employee who has been eating out of that same batch. *gross*

& because this is an airport Moe's, they do not have a salsa bar like others, so you have to ask for whichever salsa you want at the cash. (I like the freedom to look at the salsas and try out a few without having to bug the cashier).

AND why is airport food so damn expensive?  ESPECIALLY when it's not good.  I know now why as I was waiting for my flight back to SF, I saw so many people just settle with Burger King.  Smart people.  

I should have followed what these people were doing, but nope, went and ordered me a ""homewrecker"" (nice name...not)  but it was just a regular burrito with suprisingly sour cream AND guacamole.  And for about $11 bucks, which I guess isn't bad too.  To be honest, I came here because I thought I'd get full for the amount I spent.  And so I did.   

But there was something funky about this burrito.  The meat, which I got was steak, but it tasted sour.  I'm hoping it was lime juice or something that they cooked it with because it didn't seem very appetizing.  
Secondly, they got a new batch of guacamole, and believe me, I absolutely LOVE guacamole, but I wouldn't be over doing it for a burrito.  It needs just the right amount.  BUT instead, when I got my burrito I could feel the center being cold because there was so much in there.  And worst of all, the guacamole I got was turning brown.

It was filled with mediocre rice and beans and all the typical add-ons that you would find at a fast food place similar to Chipotle. The burrito also came with a pile of stale chips.

Service was slow because there was only one person working. So, she had to assemble the food and ring it up. It was pricey, of course, because you're trapped in the airport and don't have many options.",C2C0GPKvzWWnP57Os9eQ0w,2,0,2,j9ceR4URkHceNeEYmqbJdA

4703854,2014-10-17,1,fb3ygmKzuhQx-ONlUJimtg,"Let me do you a favor by saying, ""DO NOT EAT HERE!"" This has been, by far, my worst food experience ever. Granted, it is Mexican fast food but in all honesty, this makes Taco Bell look like Michelin rated restaurant. 

Let me tell you all the things that went terribly wrong...

- All of the food servers seemed like they wanted be somewhere else. I get it. Working in the food service industry, let alone fast food, is not everyone's ideal job. Again, I get it. I was there too. But to take it out on someone's order is not the way to go. Our server took every ingredient and practically threw them onto our plates. By the end it was a big sloppy mess. Which brings me to my next point. 

-I got the burrito bowl and it was practically a soup. Since our server was throwing our plates together, she didn't drain out the extra liquid from the veggies/pico de gallo. I had about an inch of liquid at the bottom of my bowl. That's a big no no.

- The ice machine was broken. Ok, not a huge deal but this was not the only thing broken.

- Apparently their grill was ""broken"" so we couldn't order the quesadillas. But lo and behold, minutes later, it starts working again for other customers. I get that sometimes things are out of the employees control but seeing as this was not the only thing wrong with this place, I was not happy. 

- The food was just not good. Maybe it was because the ingredients didn't seem fresh or because it wasn't prepared properly but, as I stated before, I would rather go to Taco Bell a thousand times over this place just based on their food. 

Overall, this place was a big NO. How they manage to stay here based on the feedback customers have gave is beyond me. I've never been to a Moe's before this and because of the horrible experience I've had here, I doubt I will ever go to another Moe's again.",rvA_xFJ7NFbmaXvwIkTNsQ,5,0,1,xidrWFhxJLk0RxvNmB6N1g

The burrito was big and all the condiments looked fresh. Okay, not the most AMAZING burrito ever, but let me reiterate... For airport food it was excellent!

p.s. And this is just a little quirk of my own, but I don't like when one item gets all bunched up in one position of my burrito... I like things to be evenly spread out. They need to work on that here.",L0oB-SV1j5dDqv-mT5CbUA,1,1,4,8rwxW1SGL9vhaf5QbyK33w

Then with a red face I began scooping nachos and cheese off the ground. Some nice guy with brochures came over and sacrificed some paper to help me scoop my nachos and then an allegiant employee came and helped too!

We stood there for at least 2-3 minutes before they acknowledged us, we were the only ones in line. The guy that took our order had no idea what a Billy Barou was... odd, since its been on their menu forever as far as we know, including the menu right there in front of him. While he was making my homewrecker, I guess he hadn't quite mastered the moes technique for getting guacamole and sour cream into a burrito and I ended up with one huge glob of sour cream and one glob of guacamole and hte rest of the burrito had none. He didn't really seem to know what he was doing and none of the other employees seemed like they were trying to help.

The ingrediants were definitely not up to what I think Moes standards would be. The rice was dry, the steak seemed like it had been under a heat lamp, and the chips were not that good.
