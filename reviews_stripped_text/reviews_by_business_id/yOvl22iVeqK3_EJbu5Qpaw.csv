They are making their employees write down their customer's driver license number on the receipt for any customer spending more than $25 and paying with a debit card. They say it is to protect our privacy. Really? How does me having to give you my driver license number protect me? Just look at it and make sure it's me, there is no reason you need to write down my personal information! What happens when you lose that receipt with my personal information on it. I will NEVER return to that McDonald's store #20903 or any other McDonald's location that requires me to give them my personal information.

573732,2017-06-17,1,yOvl22iVeqK3_EJbu5Qpaw,"It's McDonald's. I'm not asking for much, just three simple things. Fresh fries, no hair in my food and the restaurant to be open as advertised. However the only thing I consistently get from this McDonald's is aggravation. The fries are not consistently fresh and are often fried twice and stale. Almost every time I get some kind of sandwich at this location I get a hair, as if it is part of the recipe and I'm just not catching on. I have come by twice after a closing shift at my job to find a completely closed store, yet they advertise a 24 hour drive-thru all over the building. Your store is NOT 24 hours if it is closed at 3 am. I could have saved a bit of time and gas if I had not been under the impression that I can get a quick meal from this store at any time of day. I will now just head to Jack in the Box. It is pretty much the same, except with less hair and reliable hours.",-Q2RjGHUw0dDixtL3OV2Ig,0,0,1,YpcgeXZh14c-njz7A2GI7g

2634665,2015-10-02,3,yOvl22iVeqK3_EJbu5Qpaw,"Rating a McDonald's should include some inherent rules in my opinion. Much like a review written for a big bank, large retail chain, or gas station, the review should not be a critique of the corporate culture, the overall products or menu items (unless said items are regionalized and vary), or the stigma attached by the overall public opinion regarding said establishment. The review should concentrate on the individual establishment being reviewed, including food preparation, staff friendliness and competence, and overall experience. My reviews of these types of establishments always pertains specifically to the particular venue being reviewed and never includes overall opinions of the chain as a whole. 

This McDonald's is a locally owned franchise operated by a local businessman that can often be seen wearing his woven McDonald's Oxford shirt, working the walk up counter inside the restaurant. That right there is a positive point. When the owner experiences the day to day operations on the ground level, he has a better understanding of the customer experience and can continually coach and develop his team to further satisfy his customers and achieve repeat business. 

When driving my daughter to school each morning, time permitting, we stop by this McDonald's and pick up a coffee and or CinnaMelts on the way to school. The staff is exceptionally friendly, engaging, and have the ability to make things right when a situation occurs that obviously inconveniences the guests. No one in drive thru likes being asked to park in the ""Priority Parking"" to wait for their food. This McDonald's owner has alleviated some of that annoyance by offering little things like a coupon for a free fries or drink when you return as an apology for waiting. Sometimes, when instead of being asked to park, the employee has just offered a free large drink or free apple pies at the window due to the extended wait time. This is s very nice gesture that is not usually seen at other McDonald's. 

There are some cons though:

1. They often forget to include plastic silverware in your bag when you order CinnaMelts. My daughter has had to use a tire pressure gauge as a fork a few times when they forget and we don't have time to go back. 

2. Though this location still does the great promotion of ""any size soft drink for $1"" they removed regular coffee from that list for some reason. Of all drinks, I would think regular coffee could be one that stays $1 for any size. 

3. Despite the $1 for any size drink offer, when you order a combo meal, the drink is a medium. I would think they would ask what size you would like since the ala carte pricing is the same for all sizes. But if you want a large with your combo, I believe there is an upcharge. 

4. Using Apple Pay at the drive thru isn't set up for efficiency. The drive thru employee has to lift this huge device outside of the window to have you point your iPhone at it. This seems like it should be alleviated by attaching a device to the windowsill or something so it's not so cumbersome to both the employee and the patron. 

The cons aside, this is a very well run McDonald's with an exceptionally friendly staff, especially in the morning shift. I can't help but strongly recommend this McDonald's to all NLV locals.",xEbCNG-3GTw-OxFusnVP9g,8,9,4,p0NBoTaLunFcphJHDv0nJw
2713569,2015-05-02,1,yOvl22iVeqK3_EJbu5Qpaw,"What is this?!  Cashier running drive thru sounds drunk and gives wrong change.  Kids standing at the pick up window IN THE DRIVE THRU eating their food chatting it up while the people in CARS which is WHAT THE DRIVE THRU IS MADE FOR sit and wait while our food probably gets cold.  I've had enough time waiting here to be able to write this, proofread it, make changes, and still waiting!!!  Kids eating at the drive thru window really?  With no car or bike or anything just walking right up?  It's 2am and you got a bunch of 14 year olds standing in the drive thru.  Chatting it up, eating French fries as I sit here.  Guy behind me is mad, threw his truck in park just now for the second time.  This is absolutely ridiculous.  There's a line of cars completely around the building and all I'm hearing is sorry over and over.  I was even able to signup for an account just to write this review, while still sitting in the drive thru.  Now I'm at the window and the girl is clueless as to what my order is and thinks it's funny.  And also explains the kids at the window obviously her little friends, who are now sitting on the floor around the corner dropping F bombs in full surround sound with my 4 year old in the car.  I would swear I'm on a hidden camera show right now.  And you wonder why nobody takes your $15 minimum wage seriously.  This is exactly why.  They're all on something, hanging out with their friends when there's work to do, laughing and smiling while saying sorry for the wait...  Wow.  Will be calling Todd tomorrow.

This place suuuucks. If asked to pull forward to park to wait for your food, Don't do it. They'll forget about you. And then you go inside and your food is set off to the side.

The store was clean and the food fresh. There is a play area if you plan on dining in- be warned that it can get noisy. The parking near the drive thru is a bit tight so be cautious. I really enjoyed my interactions with the staff because they were friendly and they seemed to take pride in their job.

I've been here numerous times, as it is convenient and an easy way to grab a quick meal or pretty good iced coffee. Usually there is a lenghty line at the drive through, but it always seems to go quick. Our lastest visit was no exception. After getting a sample of the Mighty Wings earlier in the day, I had made up my mind early to grab some for dinner. I was simply amazed, as they were much better than I could ever have imagined. A three piece will cost you three bucks, but they get less expensive as you buy in bigger quantity. When we got to the window, we were asked to pull off to the side, as the wings were not done yet. We waited only a short time before our wings came out hot and fresh. We were given a coupon for a free order of fries on our next visit, as a result of having to wait. They have offered a coupon every time we have had to wait, which cannot be said for other establishments. I would highly recommend the Mighty Wings and give high praise to my local Mickey D's for the fast, friendly service during the dinner rush.",18xIAA444UuAWwEWiPCW-A,3,4,4,9Wj_gv01udcD6CdaRkHdEw

Instead, I pull up and no answer. Two cars are now behind me so reversing out of the drive thru is not an option. After waiting for several minutes, I decided to pull around to see if they're even open. Two cars are waiting and I'm able to pull up to the first window. No one in sight.

He apologized for the wait and took my order. Then the waiting game starts. 15 minutes later, I pull up to the window, to see an older man, on his cell phone, speaking Spanish. He isn't facing me but simply staring at a screen while on his phone. He mumbles, something to the extent of sorry for the wait and continues his conversation on the phone without even looking at me. I ask him, ""Really sir, 15 minutes to get my food?"" He doesn't acknowledge me and walks away continuing his conversation on the phone. He returns and hands me my food shortly and still doesn't acknowledge me or my statement. He just kept staring at the screen, talking on the phone in Spanish as if, me, the customer, was an inconvenience for him tonight.
