797233,2017-08-05,0,TyikKXcjTFmhyFizuaU_FA,This place is funny. Stopped at 8pm to get a bacon burger and was told they were out of bacon. Fine. Asked for a double whopper with a dr. Pepper. Was told they were out of dr. Pepper. I asked them what they had and he said everything.,hh-E46QijnPiLhS6CD3rVw,0,0,1,RmDKZ27cWYCH__zCxCr2Tg
1258087,2013-06-11,0,TyikKXcjTFmhyFizuaU_FA,"So excited about a major fast-food chain having a good veggie burger!  Presenting the MorningStar farms veggie patty, not the yucky fake-beef tasting patties, ahem, Boca, such as Fat Burger and sever other places serve. A little over-cooked (hard around the edges) but I'm so psyched that I can grab something on-the-go that is standard on the menu.  
Kudos to BK for leading the industry in offering VEGETABLE patty sandwiches on-the-go.",h5bp8gnhYGF23GIlvMyQ1A,2,1,4,j5vxi3ZabtTYInTab5MXYw

The only thing to keep in mind is that the late night shift is a bit slow, even when you're the only one in the Drive Thru. I've sat there for a good 20 minutes before waiting for 1 burger.",QGxqWdgZLPzdzu30DhhDog,0,0,3,4M-C3WXDME-3LcRCXXvjWA

We went back today because we couldn't go back yesterday to get the sandwich they missed. Also bought a whopper and we asked for no onion. They gave us a whopper with just ketchup. Seriously?!

1982298,2013-09-10,0,TyikKXcjTFmhyFizuaU_FA,This was as bad as it gets.  I waited in the drive through that evening for 5 minutes before driving up to the window.  I assumed there was something wrong with the speaker or mike.  When I got to the window there was 2 guys chatting with each other and very loud music playing inside.  I sat there for about 3 minutes while being completely ignored.  I finally left.  I promise I will never go through that drive through again.,3nFTpnd1gGRR6Tj0G5mQ1w,0,0,1,HX4RqcWIq-o9FghvrJwabA

A double cheeseburger, fish sandwich, chicken sandwich Jr, fries, onion rings and the chicken fries we wanted to try -- all were terrible, meaning they must have sat a good hour before I drove up. I only live in the next block and everything was cold and hard when I put it on the table. Onion rings were good though. 

Owners/Franchisees listen up.  Your employees are not doing your business justice.

2558409,2018-01-15,0,TyikKXcjTFmhyFizuaU_FA,"If it were possible to give less than 1 star, I would do it. I ordered carry-out, 2 double cheeseburgers plain. The lady at the register repeated my order back to me and I paid and received my receipt. 

i stood back and waited for 12 minutes, ( I timed this with my cell phone ) and still had no order yet. Finally after taking care of 2 more customers who came in after I did, she handed me a bag and told me that my order was ready.  I sat down at a table to look at the burgers and instead of my order, I received 2 double hamburgers with everything.

I took the burgers back to the counter and told her that she gave me the wrong items. She looked confused and took the burgers and threw them in the trash and asked me what my original order was. I told her 2 double cheeseburgers plain!!! And asked if she needed to see my receipt.

At this time, a male employee who was working the drive-thru came over and yelled my order to the staff in the back.  This time, I did receive the requested burgers, but upon checking again to make sure the order was correct, the patties were noticeably smaller than the original burgers that I had been given by mistake in the first place.
If management cares about this store, they really need to do some serious training!  Btw, I managed a store for 8 years back in the 80's so I know how things are supposed to go! I have contacted the customer response site and am awaiting a reply from the manager, after which I want a face-to-face meeting with management to discuss this and other improper actions that I observed going on!",S2YDmBxG7NUUrYDErMf1LQ,1,0,1,X_y3Xob_DfDbnYWjKOACOw

4147602,2012-07-03,0,TyikKXcjTFmhyFizuaU_FA,"What a poor experience I had at the BK location.  I admit that I am not the biggest supporter of the King.  I am more of a McD's guy myself.  But when BK has something that catches my eye like a special sale or a new item, I check it out.  This is what happened the other day.  They were offering the Original Chicken Sandwich for just $1.04.  The price was right but the food was all wrong.  The chicken was over cooked and taste burnt.  It had become chewy after sitting under the heat lamps for a while.  The lettuce was barely there and very wilted.  The mayo was and the verge of being bad.  I had to add pickle relish to the sandwich to make it edible.  And my disapointment does not end there.  I also ordered the new sweet potato fries.  Horrible.  I only ate them becauase they cost $1.89 and I am not in the habit of throwing that down the drain.  The fries were over cooked, soggy, and chewey and rather tastless.  Just sort of starchy.  They could have used a little salt which, coming from me, says a lot.  I rarely require salt on anything.  I have been to this BK location before and I'll likely come back again based on nothing more than convenience.  It is close and sometimes a Whopper or a double cheese burger sounds good.  It is far from being my first choice.",eOIMO2wT_WbNqmavhnCRxw,0,1,2,49mmcwdj88fsal_aHCWc5A
4435063,2011-11-01,3,TyikKXcjTFmhyFizuaU_FA,"One time while I was here while ordering inside, the cashier stopped taking my friends order while he was talking, just to answer her cell phone and spoke for a good 90 seconds.  

Even after his jaw dropped, she didn't break character and acted like it wasn't a big deal.

Luckily I don't expect any customer service going here, I just thought that was hysterical when it happened.  Overall though, very consistent, I love the food (well, it's a good value), and they are fast.

No real problems here, A-OK in my book.  Just make sure none of the workers have to make a call or have a call coming in.",UER4m0CBVgcFlVbMqhCvCg,1,0,3,2BAfzLPwiYHNW2aN14aO2A
