The one thing I do love to eat there is the stuffed pizza. I get an all-meat one with everything inside and dipping sauce on the side. If you are feeling like you want something not healthy or just in the mood for Italian food and her shopping in the mall then this is a quick fix for you. but I would not compare it to authentic pizza restaurants.,XP4LO2s6tEWM_VM2FTws9Q,0,0,3,m0Y7pqkPbFPZwzpf5UKKBQ

Who walks away right in the middle of taking an order to answer a phone call?!?  And then the guy that came out of the back gave me attitude because I he barely spoke English and couldn't understand me when I was forced to repeat my order.

She suggested I get the pizza and two sides special for 19.99 wish I would have.  I went with pizza only for 14.99. Time to pick up 15 minutes later my 2 year old grand daughter is hungry she wants Mac/Cheese that cost additional 4.00.... Oops!!! I should of listened Lol. Well kids ate it all the large cheese pizza and the baby she loved the mac& cheese. Great that you can bring this into the bowling alley!!",_3_4iBgr1JBjBsdwKD2zlg,1,1,5,0_AaD0DM0hTyVVShtLVP8g

Food is overpriced, i ordered Pizza, Spaghetti and meatballs, and a side of Macarroni, all of it lacked taste. Would not recommend this place and I certainly will not eat here again.",B1HwKlUdFwWgxAedkBFRvA,1,0,1,ghND7oA7jVbcGnlg7mwG5A

I was already at Santa Fe Casino so thought I'd give them a try.  I will be speaking to the Manager of the casino to ask him if he as actually tried this place as all the other restaurants are very good in Santa Fe.  Don't try Villa Pizza....save yourself!,lP1NFl346BQCRW40FOehew,2,0,1,mlpd_u5vo5IeIC9HhYWOEw

What made Villa pizza stand out was the exceptional service provided. 5 stars for the young man who went out of his way to make my family and I feel important. :)",yG54IqtNP6bJkFhFF9Jo4A,0,1,5,VyQcaQz71wVxqfKZaPfeVg
