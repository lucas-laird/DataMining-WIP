I usually get the chicken nachos (I ask for no hot salsa), they are amazing and the portions are very generous. Also, their Sandia agua fresca is the best I've ever had!",pcA1OAR30sMQFgl_7YWOpQ,1,2,5,b-KNtAaWnZHilwVenPcNag

I am pretty picky when it comes to tacos because I'm not really a fan but the tacos at Los Torritos Express is amazing! It taste like home made mexican food which is incomparable. I love their nachos too. The food here is fresh made, I would know because I work in a restaurant and I can compare which is frozen and old to the ones that are cooked fresh. The service is amazing and the cashiers, Natalie and sometimes mikey are so nice and helpful when I first came there to order. They are very knowledgable and friendly. It's just amazing and I recommend everybody to come by here because this is the place to be for good authentic mexican food!",o97JR6icB1eBJa9_zZiT1A,2,3,5,rgmdabjzHUG3uqShOMsLxA

But alas the days were passing and no Mexican food yet. Yelp to the rescue! Had to take other friends back to the airport so we decided to stop in for lunch on the way there.  Good quality Mexican food, super fast, and friendly service. My friend liked it so much she had to order a burrito to go for the plane.  Later that night, after spending some time on Freemont street, we started having tacos on the brain, so we actually stopped in with a local that had never eaten there at 3am hoping to find them open. It wasn't to be, but first thing the next morning we knew tacos would be on the agenda for the day. I had told the guy working that we would probably be back, so I wasn't surprised to be greeted with a friendly smile. Fortunately (unfortunately) I wasn't hungover so you'll have to make your own decision if this is good food for a hangover  But the tacos were on point....again! And although our friend that grew up here knows of lots of Mexican restaurants, it didn't stop her from having a huge smile and doing lots of nodding while she grinded her wet asada burrito. So it took vacationers to add another great restaurant to her local stops. I'm just  sad we didn't discover this place sooner in our trip & that I didn't order a burrito to go for the plane...
I know there is not a lack of Mexican food in the area,  but I definitely plan to stop back in next time I'm in Vegas.",RwBaoFqqheEGiZiZkymSoA,1,2,5,yEG05y1p3Wk7CG72b1Co1Q
5223221,2015-08-22,0,GH5gbLHw05toW6ePNIUzTw,I Agree with Edgar... Best Mexican food in town! I love this place! I love burritos and tacos. And believe me.... I've been to many different places. And this is by far my number one place to go! Service is fast and they treat you with much respect! Food is delicious and well Prepared. I always order before I leave the house and it's always ready by the time I arrive. Very convenient for me since I live about a mile away. I'm always recommending to my friends and family when they come visit and they all love it! You won't be disappointed. Trust me! It's inside the Sinclair gas station which is an odd location but it works! I can grab my beers and tacos to go all in one place! Love it!,PNBBzfxfqcf-fOLvUPMzqw,0,1,5,oAQqnYm_oNGWt6VSZpnCbA
