People complaining about the price...where do you think you are?  Vegas hasn't had cheap food for a long time.  Would give it 3.5 stars but that wasn't an option.  Salads are overdone with dressing so get it on the side.  Chicken sandwich was pretty good, fries were pretty good.  Happy hour drinks at the bar only but, they are cheap (not a lot of alcohol).  Artichoke dip was pretty good.  Music is a bit loud but not overwhelming.",Biv9xEYCMOhI0fWpvCO8hQ,0,0,3,4qu6l3wFVZ_eQH8e1xWf5A

This location however - horrific. We were seated fairly quickly because nobody was there and that was the end of something that could have been great. It was about 8 when we went and it felt as if it was 90 degrees inside. I ordered a drink, and they put way too much mint in it I was literally drinking mint with every sip. Server took it back and I just asked for water. Server, don't remember his name, he was very quiet and didn't give us the service I've been given at other locations. He didn't check on us after serving the food. 

The food, salty. I got the chicken fried chicken as I always do, and it was just so salty. My boyfriend got some seafood and it immediately made him run to the restroom. My boyfriend also knocked down his drink by accident and I told another server, since mine was nowhere to find, and it took them literally 20 minutes to help us wipe it down.

I've been to the one in Downtown Disney and my biggest complaint there was the service staff.
Against my better judgement, I chose to give the company a second chance and went to the one in Las Vegas for a celebration dinner.

Absolutely HORRIBLE.
The service was slower than a snail.
I mean there were no more than 4 tables in this place (and mind you this was around dinner time) and our server was hardly ever around. We hardly saw any service staff.
She took way too long to greet us, so we ordered waters and decided to go downstairs for the cheap margaritas across the hall. No one told us we couldn't bring them back in. (Not that there was anyone around) Once we got our waters. She walked away before we could order appetizers. Even that took 25+ mins for them to arrive.
Towards the end of our meals our server announced a different server was taking over the table.
When this guys brought the check, things were on the wrong tabs.
It was a mess.

1003069,2018-02-18,1,UFthIIorkchiGj_5ThZ1Uw,"This new location is such a huge disappointment. Gone is the cool fish tank, the bar with the zebra and giraffe stools, the awesome rain effects, the large store, and many of the animals. This space is so much smaller. Many of the animals look worn, and the eyes are falling apart. 
It's also not as easy to get to. You have to walk through most of the mall to get there, go outside and up an escalator, and then go back inside.
The menu has changes as well. The yummy tomato soup is gone. I ordered the flatbread pizza, and it wasn't the wood fired as before. It looked and tasted like a frozen pizza, not even DiGiorno quality. My niece ordered an ice cream sandwich for desert, I think they must have bought a box from Walmart. 
Family of 5 was $154, which I wouldn't have minded because you are paying for the experience. However, nothing about this was special or fun. There wasn't much to walk around and see, the new place is super small. Maybe a third of the size of the previous location.

Big mistake....Here I go....First thing that rubbed me wrong....we made it clear we wanted our sour cream with our appetizer....our server forgets the sour cream. He finally realizes and runs to grab it AFTER we had already finished our appetizer where the sour cream was needed. Then the server says he had to go get the sour cream separately as that was the only way he can do it without charging us.  Did he really think we would care about being charged extra for sour cream or was he just saying that because he forgot? We all make mistakes, own up man. Say u forgot, if u did, who cares. That was Strike 1. The  manager comes by and asks us how we were doing ...I say great. We are not one to complain. Whatever no big deal. After a few minutes the runner drops off our burgers and fries and we noticed they didn't have ketchup on the table. Wth. So we patiently waited for our server to return so we can ask for ketchup.....he didn't return and our burger and fries were getting cold so I made my husband walk to their service well and ask for a bottle of ketchup. That was Strike 2. The server finally returns....""how's everything?"" Great I reply as I think to myself ""It's ok...no big deal let's keep the kids happy and make this a happy family dinner"".  30 minutes pass, we finish our meal and server comes by and yadda yadda ask if we want dessert whatever. No thanks just the check please. As we wait for our check, my 2 year old son chokes on a tortilla chip and started coughing and coughing and then vomits on himself. Sigh. We don't have any napkins so I once again  tell my husband and daughter to run and ask someone for some napkins so I can clean up my son and the mess. While my son sits there in his own puke my husband and daughter comes back empty handed with no napkins as they were told they will send someone out to clean for us. Strike 3. I tell my daughter to just grab the damn napkins off the empty set up tables next to us. I wiped and cleaned up the seats and table and my son. Our bill never came. By this time I'm livid. A porter finally arrived with a huge dish bucket and asked What needed to be cleaned. LMFAO I CLEANED IT UP ALREADY???? We get up to leave, as we weren't going to wait anymore. The server was still MIA with our bill. We go to the front host and ask if they can pull up our bill so we can pay as we were livid and leaving!!! They ask what's wrong ? Who's our server. Yadda yadda. Whatever. The same manager comes out and asks what's wrong...ha! What difference does it make??? I told the manager...how I don't like to complain as I'm in the same industry but this was just plain ridiculous. She made it a point to say she did ask us how we were doing before and I should of said something if I was not happy. Lol!!!!! She asked us the first 15 minutes we were there. She wasn't there for any of the other problems we had. Our server wasn't a bad guy. I'm sure he tried his best. Assuming he was busy was why he couldn't get back to us when he was needed. Ok. If we have to run around and ask for shit....then that's just plain silly. If my kid choked and threw up we shouldn't have to sit and wait for help. We should of immediately been helped. Napkins rags whatever. The server finally met us at the host desk and gave us our bill and we felt bad for him to have to see us angry and talking to a manager. I did thank him for his service but I'm still aggravated I had to wait for him for literally everything. It shouldn't have to be like that and if he has too many tables than he can handle then he needs to let them know as customer service is sacrificed when you can't be there to help us. It was not pretty and I was not happy in the end. We could of just walked out on our bill and no one would of even known. That's the crazy part.

The Vegas location used to be in the MGM, and now it is hidden away in an offshoot mall near Planet Hollywood. There wasn't much foot traffic, and we got a seat right away.

First off, it reminded me of Denver's Casa Bonita--but not in a good way. Lots of small rooms with fake jungle greenery and mechanical animals blaring away in the background. Too bad there were no waterfalls or cliff divers to take our minds off the food.

I'm not a food snob, but my meal was WAY overcooked. I had the Parilla Yucatan plate off their seasonal menu: bacon-wrapped shrimp, grilled chicken topped with cheese, and mahi mahi topped with mango salsa. The seasoning was great, but the proteins were as tough as burlap. Nowhere near worth the $22 price tag.

My friends ordered mozzarella sticks, a cup of clam chowder, fried shrimp, and the jungle steak and shrimp. They seemed pretty pleased, but the food looked pretty pedestrian to me. And even though we didn't have any alcoholic drinks, the meal was over $100.

1305637,2016-08-09,0,UFthIIorkchiGj_5ThZ1Uw,"Having been to the Rainforest Cafe, when it was at the MGM grand in Vegas, I was very excited to eat at this restaurant again with my boyfriend and its new location at the Planet Hollywood hotel and casino, however our dining experience was horrible. We got seated out on the balcony, overlooking the strip and a server came over with whom we ordered our drinks. We then got our drinks 15 minutes later which we tried to remain patient over. Thinking that it was a simple mistake of the staff running behind we then ordered our food and waited nearly an entire hour before getting it. I couldn't believe the wait for our food was so long since it was 9:30 at night and the restaurant was not even busy. During this time that we were waiting multiple servers walked by us without ever asking if we needed refills on the drinks that were brought nearly 40 minutes before. We were both getting really hungry and eventually had to pull a server aside (no one was checking on our table) to ask how much longer it would be. We were informed that someone had dropped a plate of food and therefore we would have to wait longer for it to be remade. I understand mistakes happen but, we weren't even told this until around 40 minutes of waiting. As more time went by we felt like we were, quite frankly, forgotten. With the restaurant not being anywhere close to full this made no sense to us. About 15 minutes later we FINALLY got our food which was cold. It was disappointing to us because we had waited so long for our food and because the entrees at this restaurant are not inexpensive. As soon as our plates were placed on the table the server said, ""okay, enjoy"". This would've been fine but, we hadn't even been brought napkins and silverware. Since we didn't see any server in sight we had to get up and get silverware for ourselves. We had issues then getting our check and to-go boxes. The entire experience was extremely disappointing because I know the Rainforest Cafe is able to deliver good service, from their previous location but, this was anything but good service.

I was told they could not do a substitutuion fro this meal. So, I ordered the double cooked chicken with the rice. What a HORRIBLE meal! The chicken had absolutely no flavor, none. No salt, no pepper. The gravey they give you had some taste but not enough to help. The mashed potatoes were ok, but they needed some flavor. They were, esentially plain potatoes. The rice was the worst! Not cooked well, very under done and the beans were also not cooked well making the dish gummy, BLECH!

I asked the server for a to go box, figuring I would try to make it paletable in my room, then got up to go to the ladies room. When I came back my table had been cleaned! The server looked at me with this look of horror on his face. He ran to get the manager and I explained to her what had happened with this meal.

Here's the deal. I have been to the old rainforest cafe in Vegas and the locations in Atlantic city,FL and NYC. There all pretty solid. I recommend bringing kids here. The ambiance is truly what you are paying for. The kids will love it. We had no children with our group. Just big children lol. 

The staff was very nice and accommodating. The service did take a bit. But there was a miss hap on our part with the ordering and a few people drank too much at the pool. So there was some confusing moments. Luckily there was a fish tank and one of my friends spent 15 mins starring at the fish. Kinda saved the evening. 

The food is just like chain style food. Chicken dishes burgers. The appetizers are where it is at in my opinion. I just ordered a chicken quesadilla. It was good. The drinks are funky and different a lot of tropical themed drinks. Hence the name lol. I do think the food is good but pricy for what you receive. 

The mistake we made was ordering a lot of drinks here. The drinks were expensive. Between the 12 of us. Food and drinks. It was just over $100 a person. It's not bad. But for $100 a person I would have rather done a pre fix dinner at a staleskhouse or a higher end eatery. And have drinks there. But your really paying for the experience and atmosphere here.

I was the only one that got my sad soggy little island Caesar salad $7. No else got their food yet. Then slowly we got nachos and then that's it! No ones drink even came yet.

But my daughters grilled cheese was not superb.  She enjoyed it, ate it as any 3 year old would devour a grilled cheese. Unfortunately when she pulled it apart the cheese inside was still cold and unmelted.  The bread was toasted to perfection, but no heat made it to the inside.  There was no need to return the grilled cheese since she loved it anyway.

We ended the night with their large chocolate volcano, which naturally was amazing.",5VHWTXocEYwxoJe0vG1BJA,1,0,4,itLfieLCFAqRjt67KfOkpw

I made reservations 24hrs in advance for my party, who ever I spoke to on the phone was a great help and they even took a note saying I was celebrating my mothers birthday.. As we arrived we where greeted by the very happy hostess which was another good start. But when it came to ordering our waiter never gave us his name, took our order and left. He never returned until a good 40 minutes later to get our refills. When he came back he dropped our drinks off and left. He never came to check on us while waiting for our food or came to tell us that the kitchen was behind. We waited a little longer then an hour to get our dinner, that arrived at 8:20. We didn't order appetizers and half of our party where children, so the orders where pretty easy and small. After we got our food we ate and talked. Waited around for the check, assuming the waiter would do a birthday celebration like they did for the other 10 tables being served, he never did. Why ask if I'm celebrating anything if you aren't even going to acknowledge when we are there, why we came in the first place? The manager I happened to speak with after my dinner was extremely apologetic and told me she would have a talk with her employee, she also said that she saw the note on my ticket for a birthday and doesn't understand why he didn't celebrate for us.  I spent over 100$ for dinner and the customer service was the worst I ever had. Another problem I had was with the bussers walking around clueless with plates of food. Not knowing where they were going.

If you like fruity sweet cocktails this is place for you.  HH specials are $6-$8 apps and $3-$5 drinks.

Strawberry Mojito and Blue Nile are also good choices.  I usually tell them to keep the glass.  I have enough at home to open my own gift shop.  This was my first time at the new location in Planet Hollywood.  Bar area is smaller and I was bummed to see that they don't have the animal leg bar stools anymore.  Those were my favorite.

I couldn't believe her.

It's difficult for me to justify paying $$$ for food that is completely overpriced and just meh. I have no problem paying $$$ for amazing food. Rainforest is just OVERPRICED!!! It's a tourist trap. The group we were with ordered the Icee special souvenir cups...these were $8.99 each!!! Holy crap. We only got one. It was the same price as their kids meal.

I was scanning the menu and forgot how expensive this place is. Chicken dishes were $19.99 and up. Salads started at $16.99. Appetizers were pricey as hell. Couldn't get over the menu prices. 

The kids got pizza and mac & cheese. The presentation was cute with junior food trays which reminded me of cafeteria food or prison food. Ha. Cute presentation. The kids meals are expensive at $8.99 and comes with free soda. My kids only get soda at special events like weddings or parties. I made an exception today since we were with friends. 

I shared the appetizer sampler with my friend and ordered a veggie flatbread for myself. This was pretty good and the crust was nice and soft but I wish the crust was thinner.

At the end of the day, I wouldn't voluntarily choose to dine at Rainforest Cafe unless it was for a special party or with friends who chose this spot.

We finally get the servers attention to get refills on drinks and she doesn't even take the dirty plates from our table. Dinner has finally gotten to the table(now that it's been over 2 hours that we have been in this place) my sister order a burger and it was so dry and tasted like dirt, my mom ordered fish and chips she could almost knock on the table with the fish....my nephew got kids shrimp and Idk what to say about that it was just bad. The whole dinner was ridiculous. Some other waiter comes to the table to ask if we needed anything in which we tell him about the burger and the fish. He brings the Manger Cathy over to the table and she says that she will take it off of our bill. Now this whole time our server never once came back to see if everything was ok nor did she ever mention her name. Now in the beginning I mentioned we had a birthday.....yea what wtf for???? They went and sang to many other tables but never our! Biggest disappointment ever. It  was as if Cathy the Manger didn't even care that our experience was bad. From the wait time to be seated to the wait for someone to take our drink order from the time they took our order to getting our food to the horrible food that came to our table. Can't believe we paid $200 for that bs.",UH8m5wZkqDx7k01sv-TX3g,1,0,1,zHfY_A4GSifSiUp9_G2_-A

Also you don't have to walk through a casino to get to it so you don't smell like a cigarette by the time you get there. The show is much better at this location because it's smaller and you can actually feel like you're in a rain forest and a storm without seeing tourists walking by with their luggage. The animals are obviously new and there's different animals than the old location at MGM. The patio is the best part because it has the best view of the strip than anywhere.

There is a large variety of food and drinks on the menu. I ordered the spicy korean chicken. I asked for less peppers in an effort to have it not as spicy. Overall the meal was good but the sauce was very strong and there was a ton of rice that became a little soggy due to the sauce being on the bottom of the bowl.

My boyfriend and I ordered two mixed drinks in the souvenir glass. I thought that the drink was good but it could have used more alcohol in it. We skipped out on appetizers and went straight for the entrees. I had the coconut shrimp, which comes with coleslaw and a side, while my boyfriend had the chicken parm, which comes with pasta and a piece of garlic bread. I thought my entree was just ok, the dish wasn't very flavorful. My boyfriend liked his chicken parm but said that the garlic bread was very hard. Our check came to $80 plus a $17 tip, which I thought was very high for two souvenir drinks and two entrees. I think the food leaves a lot to be desired. However, the server was great, and I really enjoyed the atmosphere. Since we ordered the souvenir drinks, our server told us to bring the copy of our check to the downstairs shop area to redeem. The cashier was nowhere to be found so we had to ask a server who happened to be down there for assistance. Eventually the cashier came back downstairs and gave us our glasses.

So we arrived at just before 11. They gave breakfast menus because they do not serve lunch until 11. When the server came for the drink order (at least 15 minutes after we were seated) we asked for the lunch menus. At that point it is 10:56. He tells us it's too early for lunch. I asked if we could wait the four minutes. He sends a host with the menus but never comes back. At 11:16 he walks by, says the kitchen is still preparing to serve lunch and keeps walking hurriedly. Another 15 minutes go by, it's 11:30 and he brings another waitress (Lupe) over and says his shift is over and she'll be our server. So, that is why he ignored us for over half an hour. He didn't want a table at the end of his shift and he was busy doing side work as I saw him with a tray of condiments.

I had Informed hostess and the first waiter that I needed to discuss food allergies with the chef. This is supposed to be common for this restaurant. No chef came. When Lupe is finally ready to take our order I tell her and we have to wait some more time for her to bring someone. By the time our order was being actually taken we had been there almost an hour!

So let me start by saying it's pretty cool everything looks great no more fish tanks. 

The place was empty. Most likely because no one knows it m over and it's possibly the hardest place to locate. I think the holy grail would be easier to find bits outside on the very end on Harmon and lvblvd. At street level it's hard to find.  

Once you find the place assuming you ever do its rain forest just in a smaller package. Staff are friendly and inviting. 

We were seated pretty quick due to the lack of customers. We got our drink orders and food orders pretty quick. Food was ""ok"" my kids got the pizza which they ate all of. I got the awesome sampler it was more like ok sampler but wasn't bad but at 18.99 I expected more. My wife got the rasta pasta again 18.99 We expect more, my dad got the flat iron steak combo. He says the ship was great had to send the steak back because it was rare and he wanted medium, then he got it back they took is sauce. 

I do have to point out the staff was really great and friendly, everyone that passed us enter acted with our boys which is awesome. The manager came out she was fantastic. 

I would recommend trying it out but I think they need to drop the prices a bit.  It's not Disneyland so you can't charge these prices.",uJ7xdV3rgKPM0ufyZn7Lfw,1,0,3,4UW-7EwH-SJf9ntIAkOICA

First and foremost, Rainforest is geared towards kids and the young at heart. It's not a romantic place to bring a date unless she's into animals roaring every now and then and kids running around.

This new location next to Planet Hollywood seems smaller than their old location at the MGM but still as cool(according to my daughter). Food wise, it's to be expected, nothing special and expensive. Although, the two people in the group who ordered salads were pretty impressed with their food. I had the clam chowder and it was not bad. There was not much in my tiny bowl, a little salty but at least there were clams in there. The kids enjoyed their food and had a lot of fun.

Our server was awesome too. He was pretty busy but very accommodating. If it was not too cold, it would have been nice to sit in their patio/balcony, overlooking the strip.

Here's a tip for those who are planning to go there....DO NOT park at Planet Hollywood and go through Miracle Mile. It's a looooooong walk. Park at Cosmopolitan and take the bridge or pay $5 at the parking lot across the street and take the bridge.

Also going up the elevator to get to the pedestrian bridge... ran into a security guard escorting a totally drugged out guy that looked like he was about the heave.  Not exactly what I wanted my kids to see.

So we get there.  There is about a 30 minute wait.  With two restless kids this is tough.  When we finally get seated... half the restaurant is empty!!!  Why the wait?  They were short-staffed, and the kitchen was backed up.  After ordering, food was up after about another 30 minutes.

The food was actually pretty good.  I ordered a grilled chicken sandwich which was excellent.  The fries also good.  Kids meals were decent.  We also ordered some kind of avocado burger which was also pretty good.

The prices though were crazy.  I'm not sure if it was because it was located on the strip, or if it was just because it is a Rainforest Cafe.  The decor is neat... for the first 10 minutes, then it feels mundane.  Between the prices, the wait time, the location... I think I will pass the next time.  There are easier and more convenient places to eat.",7ZSjntRADa_sV8vbTk_j5g,2,0,2,BstPPeE_DJhgxvuM6glTsA

I will say that the management should look into the cleanliness practices of the staff, I ordered a club sandwich and a side of vegetables...nothing risky about that being undercooked, so maybe that is something that could be investigated further?

When you walk in, it feels super crowded with all the gift shop items. There's not a clear sign on how to get to the restaurant. Walking up those stairs feels a bit tight.

Two in my party ordered burgers. The meat was dried out and overcooked. The buns also tasted like they sat under a heat lamp for way too long. For a $250 meal, we were not satisfied at all.

We arrived late on a Monday and went upstairs. The hostess was gone and a few different employees assured us she'd be back shortly. She did come back a few minutes later and was incredibly friendly! We were seated and waited. And waited. And waited. And waited. 

Eventually, someone stops by to ask if we've had our drink orders taken and we advised them that no, we haven't, and we just wanted dessert. The guy comes back a few minutes later and we order the dessert my boyfriend was insistent about, an ice cream sandwich, and a bowl of ice cream. 

And then we waited. For an insanely long time. 

Eventually we got our desserts (and my daughter was sung happy birthday, which made her day so that was nice). My boyfriend and I split the monstrosity that he ordered and - unsurprisingly - it was not very good. The brownies were cold and tasted a bit stale and the ice cream was a bit frost bitten. 

At the end of the meal our server said something about our gift card having a zero balance but we didn't really understand what he was talking about as our receipt showed that our gift card balance was $25. The total cost for our dessert was over $20 so we tipped them up to $25 and left hoping to never return. 

Kids enjoyed it and have plotted our return next time we visit.... but I'm hoping we can talk them into something higher quality and delicious.",82ZQbN0EZHt6nNaj_TRuMw,2,0,2,kuAc0Q2aER5i10ae19m_Dw

 We ordered, a chef did come out but only after we requested it, and went over the options. Kayden ordered the hot dog and fruit. What was brought out was chicken strips which DO have milk, but when pointed out it was traded quickly, accidents happen.
 The food was ok. I got the Shrimp Platter, two of the three styles of Shrimp were just meh.
They sang to the birthday peeps and gave them cupcakes, no dairy free option for dessert at all.  :(
Then we went down to pay. The glass they offered me wasn't the kids glass it was a glass for adults. I explained to the cashier who called a manager. No biggie. Then the manager swooped out. She was abrasive from the get go, and cranky that I made a mistake. I kept telling her it was ok, I just wanted the glass for Kayden. She informed me I DIDNT PAY FOR IT! I finally told her to refund the money for the wrong glass, I'd buy the right one! She snapped that the glass is ONLY $1.50 and stared at me. I told her I'd ale the $1.50, and where would I buy the elephant glass with a straw for the child who is now crying because he was told he got to take a cup home.
Another half hour and finally she walks me to a bar and tells the bartender I need to order a
Kids smoothie. She leaves to get the cup. Still being a grouchy Cword.
 I told my grandson we would find a cup somewhere where the people didn't yell at little boys and we walked, no cup.
 Seriously this ruined the night. All the fun we had been having was hard to remember as we walked back down.

We weren't disappointed for a Rainforest. While the menu has been paired back over the years and some favorites are gone, we like the atmosphere. The MGM location was second only to Chicago for me, this new location is sparse and almost desolate and too small. On with the food. 

I had the Pastalaya with Caribbean Rice and my wife had a BBQ chicken breast with mushrooms and melted cheese. 

The Pastalaya was very good even though the spicy Creole sauce was a little too thick. The andouille sausage was spicy, the chicken and shrimp were tender. 

My wife's chicken was tender. The topping was a good with the melted slice of cheese. 

All in all, it was what we expected. Too bad that the restaurants at many of the Landry spots have become predictable, less interesting and more formulaic....chicken, ribs, burgers, shrimp, steaks, etc. Change the name and the menus are 90% overlap.

My husband took care of the rest of the order and I got busy with entertaining the kids while we are waiting. It passed another half on hour and no pizza or any of the appetizers or lunch. The waitress came who seems to be nice but embarrass about the whole situation, and explained that the manager forgot to put the order through, and the food should get to the table shorty. I was very frustrated and I couldn't understand why they can not be more professional and caring when they see kids on the table. After 45 minuets the appetizer got to the table, cold and soggy, 10 minutes later the manager came with my sons pizza with a very bad attitude and his explanation was that my husband asked him to bring the appetizer first before anything else. I looked at him sarcastically and mentioned to him that I personally asked you to bring the kids meal first, so stop lying. The quality of the food was zero and everything wad either uncooked or cold and tasteless. My kids couldn't eat the food which they wait for it more than one hour. We all got up and ready to leave that nightmare restaurant while almost all plates where untouched. The manager was so so rude and a big time layer. They only thing that I was happy about was that my husband didn't leave any tips for them, just paid the bill and got out. Will never ever go back there anymore, and do not recommend to anyone.",UbD88cs8BpuENVQQFHz32w,0,0,1,SxBm1fug8IEG-mIkN3iTUg

The food was horrible though.  $18 for nachos that were very skimpy portions, tasted like they were heated in a microwave with stale chips, and our daughter had to ask for salsa to go with them.  My husband has an avocado burger that wasn't very good either.  My grandson and I split the Hawaiian Kahula pork and ribs.  The ribs were very fatty, but the kahlua pork was the best I have ever had, but there was only a small scoop of it.  They served macaroni salad and rice with it so we paid $26 for a very expensive macaroni and rice dish.  The host was friendly, but we were trying to surprise our grandson with the animals and when he seated us he said have you been here before?  When we said yes he said okay so you know about the thunder and lightening and animals moving!  Spoiled the surprise for our grandson!",lex0WaQ3yVhhRmvL2Ln2mQ,0,0,1,2CW0aSg18uFWBASN4ODT3w

This review covers their 2016/2017 New Years Eve party ONLY.  The location was perfect for watching the fireworks. The restaurant was not over sold so there were no lines at the buffet  or bar.  The entertainment was a hoot (shout out to Dustin Balloon guy & Michael the Magician). Also their female manager spent the night hustling and making sure the party ran smoothly. This was one of the few rocking parties on the strip that would could bring your children to.  We will definitely go back next year!",4A4OhZN_qTUHYiZHLmZSxw,0,0,5,k_YdTTL5aYJpwGuTOUL8kA

5866489,2016-06-05,0,UFthIIorkchiGj_5ThZ1Uw,"First time at this particular rainforest cafe. Been to others in California and the one that used to be at MGM. If the weather is right, the outdoor patio is the way to go. I came here for my daughters graduation. Nice clear warm day and the view from outside was great. Most come for the animatronics inside with the thunder and lightning. Your coming for the atmosphere not for 5 star food. Obviously food is themed to the restaurant. Your not going to get a Zagat rated steak or seafood. I got the bacon burger and it was made to my specifications. It was good. Service was ok. All in all, food is overpriced but your on the strip so it makes sense. Won't be back anytime soon but not because of a poor experience, but because I live here and you play here.",kvtutnLD2al2-Kk8K7SNmA,0,0,3,F3Iq-Je6tMnnJWWKw_OvOQ
5903718,2017-08-29,1,UFthIIorkchiGj_5ThZ1Uw,"I insisted on bringing the family here for dinner while on vacation in Las Vegas. Last time we ate here several years ago, the rain forest cafe was located in MGM. We stayed at MGM and walked down to the Rain Forest Cafe at Planet Hollywood. We were promptly greeted and taken to our seats. We requested a booth and that request was met. I was surprised that the restaurant was so empty. When it was at MGM, it was packed. Anyway, our server was totally on point and everything was perfect. All of the food was brought out cooked to perfection. The ambiance was a little off, though. I guess I just expected a crowd.  This restaurant is a lot smaller than the previous location at MGM and way smaller than the Anaheim location.",07LwIrV7HwG5ncJSi26tRg,3,1,4,Rt8mC3GHVyQMJrG7Vd1-RA

The service is always excellent! Parking is free. It's a pain to get to the restaurant. Like a 20 min walk from when you park.",gHwd-oOFlN22JA3spDxJgg,0,0,3,ost5s2bgOZ_vUJ6TydKMYQ
