Prices are very reasonable as well. And although I'm not a student, there's a sign that offers discounts if you show school ID. 

Wish we had one on the east coast!!!",n8Op1YFlU3AaNZHZNBr9WQ,0,0,5,3qL2l6q1qlb9e67JMwaWDw

They were parked at the Las Vegas Convention Center during a humongous event. Knowing there'd be a massive captive audience, Bowl of Heaven seized the opportunity to jack up the price of their North Shore Acai Bowl from $7 to &11.99. To be fair, I have no idea if there was a difference in size or ingredients to justify the $4.99 hike, but judging from pictures/menu board, I'm gonna venture to guess not. 

Organic Acai was blended with bananas, strawberries, blueberries, apple juice, & MAQ 7 (a ""superfruit"" from Chile), & topped with honey, organic granola (didn't care for texture or flavor), & bananas. I saw workers actually blending the mixture fresh, so there's that positive, but the flavor was so bland. As for the toppings, there was not nearly enough to eat the entire bowl with so when they were gone, I chucked the remaining tasteless smoothie-like base in the trash. 

Money wasted.",kZJWAY828P8QZTqVYzhTCg,7,5,2,SXT2GkzN-HNWFJtVbmABkA

An Acai Bowl looks like the aftermath of a beet and poi battle royale, with a banana being in the wrong place, at the wrong time. A delicious purple mix of sweet and creamy, almost sorbet like substance which the Bowl of Heaven 2 Go serves perfectly.

This healthy bus offers multiple styles of Acai Bowls. ""The North Shore"", which is the basic bowl consisting of strawberries, bananas, blueberries, and apple juice. The other option is for the more adventurous acai lover. The ""Popeye"", loaded with, you guessed it, spinach, strawberries, pineapple, fresh kale, blueberries and more of the stuff that any healthy eater loves. I opted for the for the first option and it was delicious, almost too good to be healthy. The creamy yet refreshing acai bowl paired with crunchy granola was a fantastic mix and me crawling up the wall with energy. Seriously, my energy level went through the roof. This might be the meth of fruity goodness... well meth in a good way, like Breaking Bad meth... anyway. They also offer acai smoothies and green juices for the person on the move. Yay for health! 

The crew that navigates this healthy bus o' fun is super friendly and very knowledgeable of the product. So feel free to ask one million questions, because they will have one millions answers. Unfortunately they are only at one location for the moment, the downtown farmers market from 11am - 3pm. I hear that's changing soon, with more food truck locations coming and brick and mortar store as well. So until then visit these awesome people and get your health on!",i_DR3vdE73nVm2GlMbGpGA,6,5,5,pVsP5J4vy1SWWvYoqGuAkw

I see the masticating juicer and blendtec blender sitting on a counter, but when I ordered off their menu I was directed to the fridge and told they don't make drinks here.",PzWBUzHIaIvqn4tS4nBNFw,0,1,1,Ccz6yHMmwGTlEgkEmspHZA
