886344,2016-07-21,0,i-LDatuEXFN3EDZK1sgllQ,"Simply put: I'll definitely be back again! When I go to a restaurant, what I look forward to the most is the food, followed by service, and ambiance, etc. Here, everything was great! The food is delicious. My wife is Colombian and the sancocho (traditional Colombian soup) and the empanadas, tastes exactly as my wife's grandma makes! Scrumptious! (If only my wife knew how to make it at home also... Ah dreams for one day ;)). The service was very attentive as well, with explanations and service as detailed as we were hoping for. The restaurant has different themed nights and when we were there it was flamenco night. The distinct clapping of the flamenco rhythm along with the Spanish guitar played live, hit you as soon as you stepped in through the front door, and the dancers, beautiful and strict with their movements, just as you would expect from this traditional dance. I look forward to seeing the other nights and getting some salsa classes they offer to improve my dancing too! Best of all (or at least of equal value) the price! I would say it was very fair. Especially considering it was a dinner with live entertainment. I went with my wife and her sister and for the three of us we spent less than $50 including tip! Oscar, the owner and chef, came to introduce himself to us at the end of our meal and to personally thank us for coming and ask how we liked everything. He answered some of our questions regarding gluten free menu and some other inquiries, and his hospitality was a pleasant addition to our overall evening. Thank you Oscar and team, we will definitely be back soon!",lRgvU7IuBDOo2y6plcuPJA,0,2,5,qDlfRmZ5Nge8eNMwxYq87Q

And Wifey ordered the sangria. Let me tell you my aunty would make jugo de maracuya when I was a kid and it's been my favorite. I was surprised to find they make it fresh here!! So delicious! So anyway we ordered the lomo saltado and the paella valenciana and to start off the empanadas and bacon wrapped dates. What a treat our appetizers were amazing. I will warn you normally paella takes a while to make so order it as soon as you get there, if you know thats what your having (it's well worth the wait!) we used to go to Lima Limon for the lomo saltado put we will definitely be coming here instead! Also the best paella in town! My hats off to chef Oscar, well done sir.",lcTLJjoKoF_0j9NVzaDsBA,1,0,5,NRT9Bf8v4kd07zv1p_scPw

The Arepas were so satisfying, the perfect combination of sweet and salty. They were luscious and soft with a perfect crispy exterior. 

The bread pudding was some of the best I've had. It wasn't too sweet but was drenched in gooey, delicious sauce and was packed with pieces of crisp, fresh apple. You definitely need to try it.

Aroma is a little hard to spot since they don't have a permanent sign yet but it's worth looking for. Delicious!",_uO9Uo2GpxgjxG-FPezEhw,0,2,5,nhuaRxn0LeZtWq8Y85Jexg
1854388,2016-11-13,1,i-LDatuEXFN3EDZK1sgllQ,"I have been here three times, always early afternoon. Food is good and Oscar is very friendly. The problem all three times was the music! It is random Pandora type music playing. One song latin, one nice current pop song, but everytime I have been there rap songs come on often! These are explicit, unedited songs! They say f#ck, and $h!t, and N word repeatedly. I can understand this happening once and someone realizing this and correcting it, but when it has happened all three times it shows how oblivious they are to the ambience! I cannot eat at places, nor bring family to places, that play that kind of music and not even care! Why would you have rap music at this kind of restaurant anyway? Much less every single time I have been there! Because of this, I won't return!",y81tAoHCDF6_8wIzSYUMbg,0,0,2,rYfYIt9hFCzNl_2APnCnxA
1920798,2016-11-17,10,i-LDatuEXFN3EDZK1sgllQ,"Chef Oscar Sanchez is the King of Paella! The Valencia is packed with saffron-seasoned rice, many mussels and chunks of chicken, imported chorizo, fragrant garlic shrimp, and a savory sauce. The giant skillet meant to feed two was more than enough for three of us to share and the 30 minute wait went quickly. Request it a bit more done if you enjoy the crispy socarrat bottom, and pair this with the amazing Spanish emapanadas packed with unctuous stewed beef. It's an incredible meal we won't soon forget.

HEADS UP: If you're even remotely interested in this divine dish, get your ass to Aroma ASAP- they're closing at the end of the month and returning to a catering-only business. Oscar's paella will still be available by special order for delivery to your home or event, but call in advance as he books up fast for holidays.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,20,18,4,TQWYTxaLGnYxExVka0U6KQ

It was quiet and near closing time on a Sunday night which was great for us. Food was prepared quickly and we had the pleasure to meet and speak with chef Oscar. We ventured out of our comfort zones to try the black ink squid, which can be an acquired taste at first but easier to enjoy when chef says the ink is shipped from Spain, I would say it's a delicacy. He receives so many fresh produce from other countries, including the delicious peppers that were in our Lomo Saltado. Chef Oscar is very passionate about the art of cooking and you can tell he wants to improve in every way possible. He loves teaching children about eating healthy and customizes his dishes to be a delicious, healthy option.

4508023,2016-07-24,2,i-LDatuEXFN3EDZK1sgllQ,"We came for dinner on a Saturday about 7:00 PM and pretty much had the place to ourselves.
They were setting up the sound system for the night so maybe the party starts later in the evening at Aroma? I know they have dancers on some days.

I came for the food, not the music, but it was actually pretty nice to watch hispanic music videos and enjoy my authentic Spanish cuisine.

The Empanadas Colombianas were amazing, Steak Empanadas with a chipotle aioli and aji dipping sauce. (I could eat these all day long)
The Paella Valenciana is delicious!!! Shrimp, mussels, clams, calamari, chicken, chorizo, green peas, green beans, mushrooms, zucchini and squash. Flavor is out of this world!!!! (the left overs made for the most amazing breakfast the next day)
The Bandeja Palsa was also fabulous. Steak, pork belly, chorizo, rice, beans, fried plantain, fried egg and avocado. The steak was flavored so perfectly, not over cooked, and tender. Pork Belly and Chorizo were good too, but the star of the plate amid all of that meat,  was the rice and beans........ I couldn't get enough of it.

I highly recommend the paella. We had the negra paella made with squid ink. Rich, of the sea and executed perfectly.

Heck, even the salsa may have been the best I've ever had. Food aside, that isn't the only thing that makes this restaurant worth a visit. It's the service behind the meal that also made it exceptional. It's not every day where the chef personally comes out from behind the kitchen to have a conversation with you. Clearly, you can tell he has a passion for food and wants to do whatever he can to make your meal an enjoyable one. I've gone to restaurants where you get the paella that they made and that's that... No substitutes whatsoever and no custom orders. Anyhow, before I ramble on any further, I'll just end by saying that I've never given a review before and this place was just that good to motivate me into writing it.",-g0R4NFaVcB7X9nlKMB1bw,0,1,5,Qr65DqOgpzb-7_5k-705tg
