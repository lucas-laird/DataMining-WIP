711418,2015-03-29,1,aYfHXWNjLNUVoQa5CMA2jg,"We regularly make our own juices at home but while on vaca it's hard to find a place that can offer the same or even better. We found this place and we really impressed with the amount of juices they offer as well as nut milks and coffee specialties. The staff was really friendly and let us have samples of their juices. The young gentleman also suggested we try a sample of their bee happy nut milk and we are so glad he did. It tasted just like chocolate milk. All the ingredients are organic which is really important when it comes to juicing.
All the juices are already made and come in glass bottles that resemble old milk jugs. They do charge a dollar per bottle that is refunded when you bring them back clean.  Now I'm sure some people might feel that considering the cost of the juices it should be included but I think it's a great incentive to bring back the bottles so they can reuse them and therefore cause less waste. It would be a shame to see all those bottles being thrown out.  We were able to return all but one which we rinsed and brought home with us to reuse. With all the bad food we eat on vaca it's nice to have a place that can offer some much needed nutrition.

1018851,2014-07-27,0,aYfHXWNjLNUVoQa5CMA2jg,"Even though this place is all the way across town from where I live it is worth the drive every week to get cold pressed juices from here. 

The staff is always friendly and I remember that the first time here I was a bit
overwhelmed with all the selections they had.  The gentleman at the counter asked questions to see which juices I preferred and then gave me samples to try so we could narrow down the ones I wanted to leave with. 

I also learned that they give their juices a 4 day expiration from the time pressed even though the health department states that they may have a shelf life of 7 days. The greatest part is that all of the ingredients are organic. So the price point is perfect when you think about the quality of ingredients you are getting. Another plus is that when you bring back the bottle to them for recycling they give you a $1 credit to use. 

My favorite is the Bee WHealthy because I enjoy juices with more greens than fruits. Also, Bee Effective is delicious because they add coconut water to the greens which adds a sweet touch. It's so good that even the boyfriend drinks them and he never eats greens or fruits. I find this a perfect way to incorporate a healthy start to any day.",jOW3BGthCDL3l7Dd6AWZtA,3,3,5,QUI94iGwPcZbpbomP_vKdA

The staff are all really great. They help you select the right juice for you whether your just juicing for dieting, to help allergies or for healthy reason... They know their products very well.  You can sample the juices before you purchase which is a big plus. 

One of the owners I met was such a sweetie.  You can tell she loves what she does. Not to mention she gorgeous. She looks like a model. She pretty much sells her products just by standing there. 

What I love about their juice is that it doesn't have that grainy texture. Their nut-milks are perfectly smooth and subtle. I'm all about their nut-milks!  It's the best meal replacer for my busy schedule.

The bottles are a bit pricey but when you calculate the process, labor, especially love and care to make these flawless drinks you'll appreciate the prices more.

I did a 5 day cleanse. I am not normally the type to go that long on a diet like this without cheating but i actually made it thru the whole 5 days. The first 3 days were definitely the hardest but after that smooth sailing. I also work 7 days a week so I thought for sure I wouldn't have enough energy to do it but I was completely fine. I didn't feel hungry at all. I drank a juice every 2 hours because I work long days I wanted to stretch it out so I would be starving late at night. 

I did this cleanse to reboot my system. I have been having problems with my thyroid and I wanted to see if detoxing would help. It definitely did!!! I feel great and have a ton of energy!!! Very happy with the results. I really wasn't expecting to lose much weight doing this considering it was only 5 days but I actually lost 9lbs. Which I'm thrilled about.

That and the fact they seem to have over-refined their concept to the point it seems commercial. I don't know what it is, but it would feel even healthier if it felt like a more one-off place (which I believe it actually is). 

The staff is incredibly nice and the atmosphere relaxed. They serve organic espresso as well (awesome!). You can bring back your bottle for a small discount on your next juice purchase which helps swallow the price.

I appreciate the fact that they use high-quality ingredients and source from nearby California, and I especially love that their juices are bottled to take and enjoy over the next few days. Add in that they're raw, organic, non-HPP, and everything else Gwyneth Paltrow would approve of, and you've got a stellar product. 

I recently moved here from the Bay area and was unpleasantly surprised that so many places here in LV claim that they have juice, only to give me an overpriced rinky-dink plastic cup with a non-harmonious medley of fruits and veggies. I am sorely missing vendors like Juicer Heroes, Project Juice, and the ever-convenient Pressed.

I am so happy to find a company putting forth the quality of product that I expect when I am juicing. I will admit to being a little put off by pricing- which is $10+/bottle, higher even than trendy Cali prices, by a good 20%. They have a niche product though, and their portions are slightly larger. I will definitely be taking advantage of their bottle-return discounts though. I would like to be able to pull up nutritional info on each particular juice online, as it is not posted on the bottle itself: their website also is well-designed and informative, just as they are in-store. 

Overall: service is friendly, space is attractively decorated, and the product itself is high-quality. I hope to see more local companies picking up the slack and providing more options that are on par with the standard set here at Juice Standard! I hope they add some sort of loyalty program for frequent juicers as they settle in- I love a liquid lunch but I can't swing $300/month for it.

I absolutely love all of their juices, and they have a VERY friendly and knowledgable staff.

I've stopped in several times, but thought it might be time to drop them some Yelp love because they are a locally owned business that loves their local customers.

Each time that I've stopped in, I've had different questions, symptoms...and whatnot. The staff is always down to answer any questions. Go ahead. Try to stump them.

They're all well-trained and friendly. The juices are fresh, and tasty. Pricing is on-par with most other cold-pressed spots, and when your return your bottles, you get a buck off for each return.

If you are adventurous and seeking thrills, try the wellness or flu shots. They are spicy, but after a couple days of regular doses (is that the right phrase?), you'll feel like a million bucks.

Word on the street is that they might be opening a spot in Green Valley. I'm never over there, but for those of you that are...that should bode well for you.",Wi0VgIrbb8vqU6weyVw6tg,4,3,5,GM8ZgFvoCjZdZKylqe0IvA

1674311,2014-03-21,2,aYfHXWNjLNUVoQa5CMA2jg,"I am so happy this juice bar opened up and right in my neighborhood. I came here during their soft opening and it seemed like they already had some regulars as I noticed them calling someone by name.

When I walked in, I immediately liked the look of the inside with the menu and the pamphlets, cute names of products, and helpful tips with juicing. The owners were very helpful and Marcella explained to me all about their juices, how they are made, and the benefits. I appreciated the taste test area because of course we all want to know what we are going to get.  I was interested in a 3 day juice cleanse but seeing that I have never juiced an entire day, I was not sure how I would respond or if I could handle it. I ended up only doing one day. 

The Magnificent- filtered water, raw cashew, agave, vanilla bean, and cinnamon. 
perfect at night time when you have been juicing all day. It felt like a treat and I don't know what it was but I was unable to finish it. I'm not sure if it was the juice overload or what did it. 

I also liked the Energized, the Love, and the one with cayenne pepper. I like the glass bottle packaging but can I say it does not do well with drinking straight out of the bottle, lots of spills. Maybe you are expected to pour it or use a straw. The small plastic bottles are much easier to drink right out of. 

I would like to try the juice cleanse again but probably when I don't have to work and can stay home. I appreciate the $1 off for bringing back the bottles. I wish they had some sort of loyalty card or system though because the cost is pretty high for me. 

I know Marcella mentioned the juices have a 4 day shelf life but I wonder if the date on top was the expiration date or the date made. My juices had different dates on top. 

In all I am happy a healthy place like this opened up near home where I can come get some good quality juice.",Apj8bnqWlnaiSu4YDl0wDA,3,4,5,dJTOzL5pFRgMZP6jwzvXyw

I came here & spent nearly $60 for juice! I then went to Yoshinoya & Krispy Kreme. Who am I fooling!?!? 

Ok let's move on because there's no helping me. This place really has it going on. It's very clean, very cute & the juice presentations are awesome. It definitely inspires one to get healthy even if that lasts for only an hour. 

I walked in & was immediately greeted by the nicest kid who is eager to sample me up & we had a lot of fun trying nearly everything. Sampling is the smartest thing ever because it really gets us in the mood to spend more money & I instantly knew what I could attempt to drink and what I absolutely couldn't. I love that he tried getting me in on the healthiest ones which I had a hard time swallowing. Grass isn't my favorite flavor. Some of these juices were way too hard core for me however I was pleasantly surprised that some of them tasted really good! So I went for it & splurged! They have so many great fresh ingredients such as apples, cucumbers, celery, lemons, kale, beets, Brazilian nuts, vanilla & so much more! 

My plan is to skip lunch & juice it up at work. We shall see how long I last before someone forces me to eat something because I'm extra mean when hangry.

Juicing at home can be messy and take a super long time so it is extremely convenient to just stop in and pick up a delicious jar of freshly squeeze juice. 

They offer a wide verity of flavors and they are so good. Try the tasting when you get a chance to sample some of the flavors so you know which ones you like. They run about $9 a bottle and when you bring the glass bottle back you get $1 back towards your next purchase.

I have had their wellness shot multiple times. It usually helps when you think you might be getting sick. 

I've also done their 3 day Standard Fast cleanse with the red and green juices and the cashew milk at the end of the day. The first day was a little bit of a struggle, I didn't think I'd make it through the rest of the days, but the next day I woke up feeling different. I was able to make it through no problem. They give you lots of support through the whole process. I had lots of questions about what I should eat after the cleanse. They were happy to answer any questions I had. 

My favorite juice is Bee chill - is the perfect blend of watermelon and cucumber with a splash of lemon. The perfect refreshing drink to have in the summer time. I usually can't put it down once I open it. I keep sipping it (trying to make it last as long as possible) until it's gone.

My first visit was around Nov. 2014. Before I actually decided to try the juices, I did some research on the company and  the benefits of organic juices. I was drawn to Jamie's story and how juicing has helped change her family's lifestyle. This was important to me because I needed a more convenient way to have breakfast or lunch since I am always on the go. 

As I walked in, I was immediately greeted by the workers.  Everyone was very welcoming and explained the different types of juices offered. On a biological perspective, I was thoroughly impressed by the knowledge the workers had on the juices (esp since I got my degree in biology). This only solidified that the workers are properly trained and genuinely care about educating customers to better their health. 

What's great about The Juice Standard is that they let you try every flavor ! I tried samples of different juices since I was interested in trying the 1-day cleanse. Some of the juices I was not too fond off - I felt that it is more of an acquired taste. However, the flavor I enjoyed the most is ""Bee Magnificent"" and decided to get a 16.9 fl oz bottle. 

Overall, I had a good experience and will definitely come back. On my next visit, I hope to meet both Jamie & Marcella! Can't wait to try their new location!

-Great Service

2302879,2017-05-10,1,aYfHXWNjLNUVoQa5CMA2jg,"I read reviews that this place was slow, but I was honestly shocked at how true that is. I literally felt like I was watching the girls working here do their work at 300fps. It was not that they weren't doing their work, they were constantly doing something. It was just the perception that their bodies moved at 1/5th the pace of employees at any other eatery I have ever been to. As I continued to ponder this mystery my hypothesis is that the average speed in the food industry is 90mph. Perhaps the slow down is just a normal rate of movement that I am not used to seeing at any nutrition establishment. I didn't take off any stars for that because I was not in a hurry but I thought it was worth mentioning in case someone was in a hurry. This place is chill and oozes those slow down and relax vibes. 

The inside of the Juice Standard is small and there isn't really any room to sit and stay unless you want to sit outside. Even then, there were only two tables outside the day I went. We got the ""bee invincible"" which is basically their version of bulletproof coffee. I would have preferred a standard bullet proof but it was good enough that I am already planning to come back for it. If you are craving a bullet proof coffee and don't want to make it at home, I suggest Grouchy Johns. They are too far from my house but they make one hell of a coffee when I am on that side of town. The ""bee invincible"" at the Juice Standard is a little watered down in comparison. 

I had their Mediterranean toast and wasn't thrilled but I loved their banana leathers! My new Sunday morning ritual will likely be bulletproof coffee and banana leathers. I'm okay if it takes a little longer than average.",JB4_tH5U_oN7Xl3MA4aeHw,2,3,4,fQcRnmON07LMWaepU66VxA

I found it by chance because I had just gotten off of a weekend of partying from my bachelorette party and needed to detox and reset my body.  There happened to be a Living Social coupon (different company) for a juice cleanse, so that's what originally sparked my interest.  I always rather support local business, so I yelped juice bars and came across this gem :)

Both owners were there and were so friendly and knowledgable.  Jamie gave us our sampling and explained what each juice does.  We decided to do a 3 day cleanse and it was pretty easy.  The amount, how many bottles a day you drink and the duration between each one I think was the trick.  I could've done more!  Next time, I'll probably do 5 days or maybe even 7.  All the juices tasted great, and I loved the ""suggested"" order of drinking them.  The magnificent, which was the cashew milk one, was so perfect to end the evening.

I highly recommend this place to anyone looking to reset, recharge or just wants to do something good for their body :)",Do66gRDqKA3czgHAbyCE_w,3,1,5,zDkhsclPrcOJUHYqE_mm1g

I'm not an at-home juicer, first of all, I don't possess the equipment nor do I have the motivation to create what they are making at The Juice Standard, high quality cold pressed juices.  

You're given 8 juices to drink per day, I never once felt hungry, shaky or even a headache. All the juices tasted great, my favorite was the magnificent.

High quality, organic cold pressed juices being served and so convinient for everyones busy lifestyle. I would love to try a 4+ day cleanse in the future. Make sure to follow them on IG, you will see how they create these healthy juices.

They don't make the juice right there in front of you, individually, like in Houston. But, they have several to choose from and they make them everyday so you're never hurting for a particular flavor. The bottles are large, at 16.9 oz and they are $9 each. Also, you will get a discount if you bring the bottles back.

We visited on Sunday about 30 minutes before closing time and weren't even greeted. The guy at the counter seemed unhappy to be there and should consider a different job perhaps. When we asked about their recommendations for their pressed juices they simply stated it depends on what you're looking for and simply listed The ingredients on the ones we were already  purchasing which I had already read myself. We left with a sour taste in our mouths and unfortunately it just put a damper on everything. Do not intend on returning to this location.

I had people staying at my house during my bachelorette party and didn't want to make them up with my VItamix. Instead, I snuck out of the house in the early morning and went to The Juice Standard for the first time. I got their Bee WHealthy and Bee Energized drinks to power me through the weekend, and thank god I did!

The two owners of the store are great people who are clearly passionate about what they're doing The workers here are very well-informed and will also let you sample anything you'd like to try. For the weeks leading to the wedding, it was just so much more convenient to pop in here and grab a few juices just in case we found ourselves not being health-conscious with our eating habits. 

Juices are a bit pricey, but their packaging is high-quality and keeps the juices really cold when transporting them. You can also earn some redemption dollars by giving back any used bottle ($1 off a future purchase for every bottle you return).

I wish I could give them 5 stars but I want to see some things improved. 

They have been out of a few juices about 3 times that I went, so about 10-15% of the time I have went they didn't have what I wanted. I still got several others but they lost money at least 3 times. 

The price is a little high, they should at least give you a stamp card or offer a discount when getting 3 or more juices or more than 30 juices a month like I have got many times. I don't think every juice should be priced the same, the simple ones with all apple base could easily be less it seems like. 

They should really try harder to get customers back in the door. The big name juice places offer discounts and sales so figure they would do something.

They used to give a $1 rebate for every bottle brought back but now they give nothing. They should at least give you .25c and not just remove it completely. I mean it gets people to come back to the shop, even if they give you 50 bottles at a time, that just shows how good of a customer they are.

The foods they offer are kinda weird, they bread thing is tasty but who wants bread at a healthy juice place, it's just odd to me. They also have a lot of desserts but not many food items that are good. 

The guy that works there has never said thank you even though I've tipped so many times, one time $4. Just rude and cold so I will never tip the this one guy again. He also never welcomes you when you walk in, you gotta just wait for others to be helped. Other employees have been great though and thankful but my gosh teach some better customer service. 

I could easily see myself updating to 5 star with a few changes. Mainly prices and customer service, but a few menu changes seem like a good idea. 

Located in 3 spots, in the Cosmo Casino, Fort Apache Rd, and one in Henderson. The casino location charges more which seems bad but I guess is standard, just figure the sales volume would keep them at the same price. 

I will be back for sure though, I've bought a lot of juice from them and overall pretty darn happy.

This is a great spot to fuel up after a a$$-whoopin' workout! Case and point? After a good a$$-whooping at Decibel Crossfit, I was beyond hungry and needed to refuel muy pronto!

The Juice Standard was the first thing that popped up on my Yelp App and I figured I'd
use the opportunity to delete a bookmark then seek out a lunch spot. Owners Jaime and Marcella are two blessings in disguise that bring a much needed product to Vegas, as we unfortunately live in a city where GMO, processed and HFC drink options are everywhere, and the Juice Standard is a very refreshing option.

Depending on what you are looking for, there are different combinations and blends to fit your needs, and there's even samples upfront for you to try before making a purchase. I tried a green one which was a little too grassy for me at that moment then a few more after that. I managed to settle on the Grateful and Excellent blends. 
After a few sips of the Grateful blend (I shared the Excellent blend with wifey the next day), I actually felt my hunger disappear! It probably has to do with the HPP process, and your body absorbs and retain the healthy nutrients quicker.

They also have juice cleansing packets if you choose to do so. Blends are $10-$11(16.9 ounces) with a four day shelf life(From the date processed) and a $1 deposit for every returned bottle. Give the Juice Standard a try and do your health a favor, ALOHA!!!

My husband's boss swears by this place, so I came one time to check it out.  I appreciate that they let you sample any of the juices on the menu, cuz juices can be a bit scary sometimes, you know?  And when you are paying around $12 for a bottle, you better make sure you like it.  I was surprised when the fellow behind the counter said, ""Do you want to try all of them?""  He was going to let me have like 15 samples.  I just tried the three that I was deciding between and went with a yummy and sweet one that had carrots, apples, and pineapple in it.

A few weeks later, after the holidays and I was feeling like a big fat bloated cow, I decided to do their 3-day juice cleanse.  They label every bottle for you so you know in which order to drink them and give you tips on how to get through the 3-day cleanse if you're a newbie like I was.  The cleanse went well and I felt a whole heck of a lot better afterwards.

I took a star off because they are a bit pricey.  I've gotten juices for cheaper at other places.  Also, in the cleanse, I wish there had been more variety.  Of the 8 drinks each day, 4 of them are green juices, so I got tired of constantly drinking those.  HOWEVER, I did do this cleanse during the winter when a lot of fruits/vegetables aren't available, so perhaps in the spring and summer they rotate in some other flavors.",QPREECpJrp8Dj3_TK22oqg,2,2,4,pjohG0uwa1UVw5443hVzag

I was beyond mesmerized by the incredible selection of delicious juices that taste like they've been crafted by a Michelin Star chef. Each juice is a delicious concoction that was created to meet every need from simple hydration, to glowing skin to liver cleansing. I also loved that they use glass bottles instead of plastic, I re-use my glass bottle by filling it up with snacks like almonds and keeping it healthy on-the-go. Also, they have a rewarding loyalty program where you get a $1 off your next juice if you return the bottle, what a thoughtful way to recycle!

I also love the fact that Jamie and Marcella ( owners) , kindly offer you a tasting menu where you get to try all of the juices prior to buying them ( most juice places in LA do NOT offer this option). They are incredibly knowledgeable about the ingredients, benefits of juicing and take their time to pick the right product for the results you are trying to achieve.

I did the 2 week cleanse and have never felt better! Their bottle sizes are designed perfectly to keep you full and satisfied. They are also very encouraging and always check on you to see how you're holding up during your cleanse to make sure you're not pushing your body overboard.

I opted to try their one day juice cleanse. The offer anything from a 1 day cleanse/ 3 day cleanse/ 4+ day cleanse.  Warning: Juice prices are on the high end here. They offer fresh cold pressed organic juice and it doesn't come cheap (understandably so...). I've always wanted to try a cleanse and purchased their prepackaged juice option (see photos). 

Overall, I loved their juices and enjoyed my one day cleanse. I did not do this to drop weight and do not believe that cleanses should be intended for that.

When we got home late afternoon, we noticed 4 of the juices expired that day, and we needed to drink them that evening (not thrilled).  We didn't get the chance to drink them all in time before they expired. 

We decided for us, we would prefer to go buy the juice that we intend to drink instantly. When we went back today, we brought the 12 bottles back, and just wanted 2 drinks.  They told us that they would take the 12 bottles ($12 off), but only give us $2 off this order, with a receipt showing an additional 10 bottles returned.  I explained that we only intend to buy drinks as we drink them, so we won't ever buy 12 at a time again.  They said ""that's fine, but we can't give you the discount"".

Bottom line:  they are willing to give a discount of $1 per bottle returned. But they will only do it bottle for bottle, meaning that they try to lock you in to buying bulk. I hate small businesses that hide behind bate-n-lock-in ""policy"" over common sense and putting the customer first.

The clerk was fantastic at explaining all the beverage choices that were available that I might enjoy, and he shared with me his favorites as well. 

On the cashiers information I tried the Matcha Latte. I was scared to try it since it is coffee based and green in color. It was very smooth with no after taste, and I was even expecting one. I guess the matcha green tea should of tipped me off that it would be green, but with it having espresso as well I was not sure. The açaí it the espresso latte was right on target too and really good for ones health. 

When I was paying for the matcha latte I was sort of drawn to some of there house drinks that come in these small looking glass milk type bottles. Which is so retro, after one drinks the juice then the bottle can be washed and reused with no deposit either. I tried the Bee Cosmopolitan flavor . It comes in a healthy pink color too. It tasted like lemon aid, with agave, beets, and lemon as some of the ingredients.

4050517,2014-03-11,13,aYfHXWNjLNUVoQa5CMA2jg,"Herr yea!  A local juice bar i'm down to support.  They bottle their juice at the store with locally farmed raw produce without HPP (High Pressure Processing).  HPP is just a method to extend shelf life, and from what i read it has very little effects in characteristic of molecular food compounds; taste, vitamins, and nutrients.  Hence why Juice Standards are super duper fresh, Bee!  Without the HPP they're also able to package their cold-press juice in glass bottles which you can return each for a $1 discount off your next purchased.  Bottles are $10 each for 16.9oz and there are many to choose from.  

I eat pretty bad since i have retarded hours [but mainly because you, f-nuts (i mean that in the nicest way possible) always yelp tasty looking spots] , so i've always try to include green juice in my daily intake when im on the go esp when i wake up on an empty stomach.  Thankfully i don't need all that fiber i'm missing out on, and other than that I don't really mess with any other root or fruit juice.  Personal choice.

So this store is really cool because when you walk in you can see huge cambros full of raw veggies through the glass refrigerator doors.  They do everything in house, not in the front i would think but in the back.  They just store some in the front along with ready to be purchased juice bottles or samples with the help of Jamie or Marcella who are both knowledgable about their products.  Today, I was able to pick out my fav green juice, Bee Love (Carrots, Celery, Parsley, Spinach) from them with Jamie's guidance. 

I've also picked up Bee Effective (Apple, Zucchini, Spinach, Swiss Chard, Radish, Celery, Romaine, Kale, Parsley, Coconut Water), and it says it contain tree nuts, but it's actually the coconut. 

And just because of allergy season I never got to try, but I got two bottles of the Bee True To You(Cucumber, Lemon, Ginger, Turmeric, Honey, Cayenne) which has some local Honey in it.  I doubt two bottles will have any effect of the outcome, but i still want to try anyways.  Tasted good but got a nice throat kick to it with it.

Juice Standard has an amazing thing going on.  I've only see a juice bar like this in cali, but these ladies have more confident in their own products which having me believing in them too.  And about once a week i'll need reassurance.  

Tip:  Savor your juice.  Swirling in your mouth is important part of digestive system.  Your saliva has Ptyalin, an enzyme that helps break down food and speed up chemical reaction so your body can retain more nutrient.",pDvDLpD7CiMlIebsDPCRSQ,17,13,5,_J_TmPBu1V5MHBS1crN8Ig

Some were amazing and some were ok. It depends on your choice of taste. She was very knowledgable on all the drinks. The juices break down to whats in it and what it is good for. They have certain memberships if your interested but I was just there for a bottle or two. I choose the ""abundant"" and the ""royal"" $11 a drink. One nutty and one fruity. I suggest you taste test before purchasing! It helps a lot more. The bottles are glass and if you bring back the glasses you save $1 on your next purchase. How sweet is that. I'll be back to purchase more drinks. They are kinda pricey but think of each drink as a healthy meal replacement.

She put down other juicing places claiming that they might have children and implied that that means they are probably dirty and you can get sick because the juices aren't pasteurized.  I thought this was supposed to be a positive place- I understand giving a friendly warning but it really came off as putting other juicing places down.  Say nothing rather then be negative.  Another time I paid cash, but she forgot to give me $1 off for my bottle and said she would give me the $1 off next time.  (She is the owner why not just open the register and give me the $1?)  Well next time she did not give me the $1 off, and of course it is $1 so I was not going to be that petty and ask for it!  Yet another time she lowered her voice dramatically and told me I need to wash the bottles out a little better next time.  Ok, no issues if she thinks they could have been rinsed out a bit more but the way she said it was just totally weird.  I will reiterate to you they were not that unclean or growing mold or fermenting and were rinsed out.  Another time I was introducing my friend to The Juice Standard and let her have one of my bottles for the $1 off, and the owner made us both feel like this was totally cheap of us and acted annoyed.  Another thing is when you pay with a credit card here the tablet has large tipping suggestions of different percentages and what the suggested tip would be.  If the owner is ringing you up and you are giving her your business it seems odd to my friends and I that she's asking for your business and tips.  I could be out of line here but it was just awkward when my girlfriend purchased a few days worth of a cleanse then felt obligated to pay more for gratuity because she didn't want to be a jerk and wasn't sure what the proper procedure here is.  She ended up paying an extra $18 for the cleanse for the gratuity.  There is a small box that states ""no tip"" but it is very small and if you check that box the owner remains mute about it but you can tell she is kinda peeved.  I had really liked the juices here and I do think they have great juices but the owner seems very neurotic and definitely drove my business away.  My girlfriends who also were going here agree with me and we are now getting our juices elsewhere.

4234257,2014-03-17,8,aYfHXWNjLNUVoQa5CMA2jg,"These ladies are pressing up the most delectable dietary delights in Las Vegas! It's a five star experience all the way to organic nirvana.

HPP means high pressure pressing. All USDA organic, non GMO. A lot of their produce is sourced from California, which means a smaller carbon footprint. Their bottling is either glass (all class) or plastic, and the plastic bottles are, of course, BPA free. What's not to love?

If that's not enough to entice you, the radiant ladies they have behind the counter (or the adorable Queen Bees that are wandering the floor this afternoon) are incredibly friendly AND knowledgable. Their concept goes beyond trendy. When they began to tell me about how certain vitamins will be absorbed 100% because of the pairings with other vegetables, and a mention of trace minerals (87 in BeWhealthy, if you're counting), I knew I had come to the right place! It's a breath of fresh air having nutrition that makes sense and does work for you, instead of just adding chia seed to everything and calling it healthy.

Their selection of smoothies are limited to a mere four, but they run the gamut of every avenue of nutrition you need. Fruit based, protein based, veggie based, and fat based (think coconut, avocado).

The space itself is gorgeous and inspiring, the branding and bottling is sexy, the juices are not only good for you, but specifically crafted to be delicious while beneficial to your health. Bee well!",Gap65780O9PI3Ui7Zj6Avw,21,11,5,LLBmqHxsDkm9pSSHLCE-hg

4257758,2015-04-25,0,aYfHXWNjLNUVoQa5CMA2jg,"Great, organic juices. Probably the best here in Vegas. I always feel food after getting juice here.

Sure, I wish they had the creativity of Function Juicery down the street, but at least here they use lower toxin, high nutrient ingredients which will knock your socks off!

Also a very cool looking little place. Matches the modern times of yoga and Range Rovers more than the hippy juice places of yore. :)

They also have a glass bottle recycling program here remiscent of Germany. Very cool. 

Glass is really the way to go. It is nontoxic, unlike the plastic used at poison juice places, and better for the planet, too. I have never understood putting awesome, healthy ingredients into an unhealthy bottle that leaches poison into juices. I am so very glad they understand that here at The JUICE Standard. Massive kudos!

Overall, this is a shop trying to and actually succeeding at doing just about everything right. 

I do have a couple of wishes, however.

The first thing I wish they had was self-serve, because like a or of people, I like to hold and look at the juices... Read the ingredients. Figure out what I like. 

Asking someone behind the counter for every little thing does inhibit sales to volume buyers like me somewhat. :) From the outset looking in, it looks like it has grab n' go case, but it's not. It could be. And it would be awesome.

Secondly, I wish they had some raw food options. Their juices are great. I bet their raw food would be, too!",nCX010DHtZkXf0vk-bQMVQ,1,1,5,nvvXUoJuWzcOvsSnZmv4RA

My first experience was with Tiana and she was extremely helpful. I truly appreciated her kindness, patience and knowledge. I loved that I could tell her what I was hoping to accomplish like healthy insides such as digestive track, good organs like liver, etc and she would always have wonderful recommendations. 

The best part about my experience was that I was literally able to sample EVERYTHING! that's such a big deal when you're spending anywhere from $9-$13 bucks a bottle, like she said, you want to make sure you're getting what YOU as the customer will enjoy. 

I ended up with several different flavors like Bee On Point, Bee Effective, Bee Chill and Bee Happy which were all delicious. When I returned the next day or two I was helped by another kind employee who unfortunately I didn't catch her name who was also a pleasure to interact with and she recommended their smoothies as well. 

I tried the Acai something which had fresh bananas, coconut flakes, pumpkin seeds and this heavenly granola. It was so scrumptious I went back 2 days in a row and have officially converted my husband thanks to the last employee's kindness who surprised me by making a sample for him to try so I wouldn't have to share mine.

4701413,2014-09-26,8,aYfHXWNjLNUVoQa5CMA2jg,"I was having severe abdominal pain for almost a week and even with a visit to urgent care, I couldn't figure out what was going on. A medical professional mentioned that it may be my gallbladder and prescribed me three medications that unfortunately didn't help! After having another attack, I took matters into my own hands and decided to research foods that naturally help your gallbladder and most importantly, avoid irritating it.

I found that vegetable juices like beet, cucumber, tender baby greens, swiss chard, dandelion greens, beet greens, celery, carrots, ginger, and tumeric are great for gallbladder health as well as organic grape and apple juices. Other helpful foods to add to juices: lemon, avocado, vinegar, berries, papaya, pears, and flax and hemp seeds/oils.

Therefore, I was on a mission to find organic, cold-pressed juices that utilized these foods and hoped it would heal me! The store is very easy to find, in fact, I had seen it while driving by on Ft. Apache. Access and parking is simple as well. I love the interior! The adorable bee and honeycomb theme complete with adorable packaging, matching wall art, and the amazing table re-purposed from a tree!

The staff was so friendly, helpful, and insisted on samples. I told him which juices intrigued me and why, so I honed in on Bee WHealthy and Bee On Point. After sampling the two, I chose Bee On Point that is comprised of cucumber, celery, carrot, apple, kale, beet, dandelion, radish, lemon, ginger, turmeric, and pepper (16.9 fl. oz. for $10.99). Neither of the juices really tickled my fancy in the flavor department, however, that truly doesn't bother me nor will it stop me from future consumption because I need to minimize sugar (even natural sugar) intake as much as possible and that's typically what makes juices taste better.

Anyway, the juice was great and filled me for three hours! That was enough time for me to finish what I needed to do for the day and get home for my next meal. The great news is that after just THREE days of eating and drinking the gallbladder-helpful foods, I was able to stop the attacks! It's really wonderful having access to a place like The Juice Standard to have truly healing products when you have health issues. It was honestly the only place I trusted to have something that wouldn't trigger another attack and I was very grateful for it. Your body will heal itself if you give it the right tools. 

FYI: You receive $1 off for each glass bottle returned! But the bottles are so nice, you might want to find a purpose for them at home. Also, keep in mind that these bottles are 99.9% juice which means you're getting the good stuff, not just water or miscellaneous fillers. Yay for cold-pressed!",TdYKJgSgY2GF_YJnwsi5yQ,24,16,4,QgwT5FKWpLB-Tkc3ReYEEw

1st off I love the packaging of the product. The glass bottles are great to reuse for home juicing, decorative use or for seasoning and spices.  They help keep the beverage colder longer.

Ok now to dive into the juices.  They offer a long menu of freshly juiced beverages to accommodate any taste bud. They have sweet, sour, spicey, refreshing, coffee or even protein smoothies for a quick healthy meal on the go. They offer an unlimited tasting menu so you know what you're getting and guaranteed to love your purchase. My favorite is the Bee Cosmopolitan which tastes like pink lemonade and the Bee Excellent which is a nut milk.  

In addition to their drinks, they also offer some food items, vegan friendly. My favorite is the Blueberry Vegan cheesecake. ABSOLUTELY delicious!!

4980315,2014-04-18,2,aYfHXWNjLNUVoQa5CMA2jg,Their juice cleanse really works. The first day was a little tough-by the end of the first day I had a headache and was nauseous all night. I took that as a definite sign that I was detoxing which is what I wanted. The second day was much easier and I felt a lot better- and by the morning of the third day I felt really good- I also felt like I could keep going on this fast easily for another day or two at least- but unfortunately I had a dinner I had to attend that night so technically I only did it 2.5 days. It helped get rid of my cravings for unhealthy food and I felt like my mind was much more clear. Would definitely recommend either a 1 day or 3 day cleanse- I think there is still a great benefit to just a 1 day cleanse- and once you get past the second day it's really easy to do a 3 day cleanse- if you don't start to get sick of juice by then. Lol I hope to do a 1 day cleanse weekly for a while- or a longer 3-5 day cleanse when I get back from an upcoming trip.

I was going to buy the 1 day cleanse ($60) but I didn't really enjoy 4/8 of their listings. I decided to just buy 5 full size drinks.

Bee on Point: very fresh!!
Bee Chill: my ideal of summer!
Bee Vibrant: really refreshing with a nice kick
Bee Positive: MY FAV 
Bee energized: definitely something I would drink daily (lemonade like)

I'm excited to come back here even though the prices are a bit expensive. but $1 off from bringing back the glass jars, hell yes!!",ZYn3ujBBAvWS1Tn7OQXnZQ,1,1,4,9NH0u6JzzyIwbsqZUw4a-g

I have a nut allergy so I can't drink all of their juices but they use a separate machine for the nut milks so I never have to worry about cross contamination. If you juice at all you will love this place. And if you are thinking about starting, this is the perfect place to get your juice on.",JY8zWgPoaQiFZD5B-0gIfQ,3,3,5,7YzyAXLx-QiojmTG1prmRg

5754937,2016-08-01,12,aYfHXWNjLNUVoQa5CMA2jg,"Hip hip hooray three times!  Local! Organic! Renewable! The Juice Standard (TJS) offers a gift program. In addition to gift cards, you can purchase pressed juice as a gift. I was one lucky recipient of a 6 bottle gift. I was surprised at my office with juices to refresh, replenish, and rejuvenate me. Such a wonderful surprise had me smiling and keeping me up with my day.

TJS is local, locally owned, focused on organic and seasonal produce, and promotes sustainability with a recycling program for the glass bottles. And glass is better! Say no to chemicals from plastic leached into your foods, plastic, especially #1, #3, #6, and #7, has been found to leach potential carcinogens and other chemicals into the bottled liquid. Thank you TJS for a focus on health and wellness in Las Vegas.",ssgRnGGXxigWTEXM-n92lg,18,17,5,nuZtuwUChqX5agEKZ0LLww

They make smoothies as well, otherwise, all juices are bottled with a date of expiration about 2 days from purchase. Given that it is $9 per bottle, I would recommend a different juice bar. I didn't think this place had anything extra to offer.",-5ye1ya0wRQhNRF9NfQ1fA,1,0,3,xyjZJXFlatyItWNlzVGXMQ

Their juices are just so pure and fresh - I absolutely love it there. Marcela (one of the owners) was super friendly.  They've got a huge selection and really something for everyone's taste. This will definitely be my ""go-to"" from now on. At the end of the cleanse I lost 4lbs of just yucky, bloated, sodium-filled nastiness and I feel back to normal now. It has definitely reset my button and I'm back on track and into my usual workout routines which I have way more energy for now. Thanks everyone!",BXj6WCf8yHe4RvI1QRq8Ng,2,2,5,YWgGagiKAIMXIsDNE__DzA

They all have great benefits and are enjoyable to drink because they taste delicious. I love how my skin glows days after drinking these cold pressed juices. BeeEffective is known to make your skin glow and although it does taste good (to me) you have to be open to having something more ""green"" tasting.",-kRQLEDxrEBVNXImyAt_ug,2,1,5,CeY1s1SnkUsmONhph3SX-Q

Not thick, very watery, and didn't have any taste to it. Maybe it wasn't one of the best options for me, but it sounded good. Hopefully I'll be in the area next time to try out some juices.
