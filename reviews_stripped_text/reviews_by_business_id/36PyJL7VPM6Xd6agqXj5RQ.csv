The bowls cost $5.89 and are plenty to fill even those with a pretty big appetite. I haven't really tasted any of the combos but they are priced between $6-$7. The only thing I don't like about it is the location. Must eat when at the mall! We even drive there once in a blue moon just for the food.,VSIu9ZdH9zcwy6cZ4EHBrg,0,0,4,UBJcjVJEhuMvt2kBFc55ag
