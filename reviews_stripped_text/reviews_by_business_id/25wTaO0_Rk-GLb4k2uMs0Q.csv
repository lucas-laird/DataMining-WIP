10812,2010-02-16,1,25wTaO0_Rk-GLb4k2uMs0Q,"My husband and I were in Las Vegas for the weekend and decided to have some oysters at AquaKnox before Valentine's Day dinner.  This was our second time dining at this restaurant.  The first time was okay but overpriced.  We ordered a dozen oysters at the bar.  The oysters came out quickly and my husband was about to eat the first when both of us noted something black squirming in the oyster.  Upon closer inspection it was a black worm about a centimeter long.  It was moving very quickly so we called over the bartender to show him.  He did see it and took the oyster and quickly threw it away and left the rest of the oysters.  We let him know that we did not want the rest of the oysters and he then took them away.  He left the bar area for a few minutes (probably to let someone know what happened).  Upon his return, no apology, just asked if we wanted something else.  We didn't.  It probably took us about 15 minutes to finish our drinks.  During that time no apology from anyone at the restaurant.  On our way out I asked to see the manager to let him know what happened and he smiled and said he already knew.  We let him know that we at least expected an apology and he said that the bartender should have apologized.  He went over to the bartender and said something to him.  The bartender got irate and said first to us ""what do you want me to do, I didn't charge you for the oysters"".  He then said to his manager that he apologized 3 times.  A complete fabrication.  Not sure if I'm eating raw oysters anymore, but what I can say is that we will never return to AquaKnox.",XmTzI7o7LPd0v0-4zId1qw,2,1,1,Xstjg03qyi0XCZk0Wz-QOg

The service was really really slow.  We had a large group, 16 people, but it took over three hours.  The seats are really formal and the wait staff could not reach over the seats to get or pick up food, so they hit my chair every time.  

There are plenty of other restaurants in Vegas that are much better.",ZV4S6UFN8dQe2qdL9f92Hg,0,0,3,0F5Z3AaQ3kN9_CVO-O9CTg

The Good
Five Stars for the service - The service was impeccable! We have had, as good, but never better service in over thirty years eating in fine dining restaurants.

Five stars for my wife's dinner - My wife had the Georges Bank Scallops. She always orders scallops if they are on the menu. She said they were perfectly cooked and the accompanying sides were as tasty as those she had at Roy's and the SW Steakhouse in the Wynn.   

The Bad
Two stars for ambiance - They crammed as many tables and chairs into the space as possible. I am not a large person and I barely had enough room to move my chair back to get in and out. The tables and chairs on each side of the walkways to allow diners into and out of the restaurant and the wait staff room to get around the restaurant were very close to each other. I could have easily leaned over and touch the chair next to me across the walkway. The music was too loud for a fine dining restaurant.

Two stars for my dinner. I had the AquaKnox Fish Soup. The John Dory was overcooked, one of the clams and one of the oysters were no bigger than the nail on my little finger and the lobster was overcooked and very tiny. I have had perfectly cooked and a much larger lobster tails in a similar dish at Roy's and even Red Lobster! A real shame because the broth was to die for.

Two stars for menu variety and creativity - I had a very difficult time finding a starter to go with my Fish Soup. Almost every starter contained some element in the Fish Soup so I just ordered the boring Romaine Salad and my wife did the same. The menu is uninspired and insipid. The appetizer ""Special"" was steamed crab legs with drawn butter. I wonder how long it took them to develop that dish! Anyone can buy crab legs from the grocery store, warm them and melt butter on the side. When we go out to eat in a fine dining restaurant we expect the only problem with the menu to be too many interesting and enticing choices, not too few! Check out the online menus for the Chart House and Roy's, both upscale seafood restaurants also in Las Vegas, for examples of truly inspired and creative offerings.

The Bottom Line
Two stars for a disappointing experience and a case of ""Buyer's and Eater's Remorse""! If you are a local in Las Vegas, much better choices are The Chart House in the Golden Nugget and Roy's - a short eight minute drive to Flamingo Road from the Venetian. Either restaurant has far more convenient valet or self parking.   If you are from out of town and without a car, the extra expense for a cab ride to either restaurant is advised.",NSYXrTgfKHBWgtQxYtzkMw,0,0,2,5Abu0ldfQkgPLmkmk3AjxA

75895,2013-05-01,0,25wTaO0_Rk-GLb4k2uMs0Q,"The AquaKnox is located in the Venetian area.  We had a party of three.  The first thing we noticed was that the waiters work in a pair, which was interesting.  We ordered a bottle of wine recommended by our waiters, which worked well with the food and was decently priced.  We started off with an amuse bouche, which was basically a bite sized caprese salad, which was delicious, but not particularly all that creative.  We split the platter as an appetizer, which was a ridiculous amount of food.  Had we had just the platter and dessert, all of us would have left happy and full.  There were oysters, crab, mussels, shrimp, lobster, oyster shooters, and we got the other crab upsell.  I would say that the shrimp ceviche was really disappointing as the shrimp was rubbery and there wasn't a lot of flavor.  The stone crab however was delicious.  I got the lobster stuffed with crab and holy crap was that a huge lobster -- at least a 2.5 pounder.  Next time, I'm definitely going to ask how big it is.  It however didn't go to waste as I just took it home and ate it as lunch the next day (as an aside: I asked them to crack everything and they told me they did.  The claws were kinda cracked, but kinda half assed so I had to leave a lot of meat in the claw because I couldn't get to it at work).  My father had the prawns which were tasty and my husband had the yellowfin which was also delicious.  I'm not really sure if the dining experience really merited the price, but the seafood was definitely very fresh.  I guess I felt they relied very heavily on the top quality nature of their seafood instead of any real creativity in the cooking and flavoring.  Oherwise, as top notch of a dining experience that you can get in Vegas.",DNFX44rLbZCGlOPkEGzboQ,1,0,4,JDyQL3uOyz6WtMss1lQU6g

The service was seamless & just flowed very nicely. Everyone was very cordial & polite, as well as hilarious & earthy. Our server kept us entertained the entire evening. 

The food was impeccable! First they start you out with a salmon pate type thing & breadsticks. My mouth is watering just thinking about it. Then we ordered a lobster bisque, which very silky & flavorful- THE GREATEST LOBSTER BISQUE EVER! After that we had a seafood platter of oysters on the half shell, prawns, lobster, ceviche & shooters- really a great deal for $80, serving 2 people. Our main courses were so delicious, we had to conquer them- despite how full we were from the previous courses. I got the John Dory which was server recommended & I am so happy I listened. Very versatile piece of fish; crunchy, savory, sweet. It was served over a lobster succatash, who doesn't like their food being served over lobster?! Last, but certainly not least- DESSERT!

(sucks)  However, the server told us that he can't split the tickets for us.  So, one person had to pay for everything, and the other people would pay to that particular person.  This was very annoying because we each had to make a copy of the receipt, and initial our names by what we ordered.  This whole process took a long time, and a couple of people sitting next to us started to make condescending comments toward us.

This place was definitely one of the highlights of my weekend Vegas trip with the boyfriend.  Actually, it's one of the best fine dining experience that I've ever had!!! The food was absolutely AMAZING and the service was excellent !! 

Upon arriving at the restaurant, we were promptly seated at the booths, and I'm glad we were, because the area's really quite romantic. The decor is just beautiful and the whole vibe of the restaurant was just great. Lovee the blue drapes that were hanging down from above. 

After placing our order, the waitress brought out a vase of breadsticks, along with smoked salmon sauce. The smoked salmon was really, really delicious. After finishing the breadsticks I just  had to finish the rest of the salmon. yummy. 

We ordered the seafood plateau ($80), an appetizer  consisting of shrimp, raw clams, 6 raw oysters, oyster shooters, and lobster. ALL of the items were extremely fresh and delicious, especially the oysters, the clams, and the lobster. I also like the fact that the cocktail sauce had horseradish in it to give the overall thing an extra kick. Delicious. After the slowly enjoying each and every item on the plate, we were pretty happy and satisfied with the meal, but the best was yet to come!

Next came the house salad ($11). It's a nice and simple dish that was arranged quite nicely on the plates.and was quite refreshing to have after the seafood appetizer.  

As an entree, we had the surf and turf, which was split between the two of us. I was quite surprised at how much food they gave us. We each had our own little steak (4 oz or a maybe little more?) and lobster (bf got the tail and I the claws). I must say... the steak's probably the second best I've ever had [after the bf's. but his steak can't be beat ;) Tender AND flavorful!!!  ] . The meat was nicely seasoned and just melted in our mouths. The lobster was equally amazing, if not better than the steak ! I thought that it was nice that they brought out a nice little contraption that kept the butter warm for us. But yes. The food was just sooo good...  and I was sooo happy when I was eating the entree haha. (We also ordered champagne, so that probably contributed to my overly happy state at the time as well. Oh, wine bottles are half off on Sunday! )

After the meal, we were pretty darn satisfied, so we didn't order dessert. They brought us some little butter cookies, and I thought that was a nice gesture from them. 

The food's definitely not wallet friendly (total came out to 250, exc tax), but it's definitely something you need to try at least once when you're in Vegas. I will be back !!!! hopefully. After I do some gambling and make more moneys =)

I had the most fabulous and relaxing experience. I said experience. It wasn't just how flavorful and fresh the seafood was. I'm from Hawaii and we have the one of the best seafood dishes here, however this restaurant (and awesome chef) truly created a beautiful and orgasimic-euphoric dish. 

PROS:
1. Surf and turf. The stuffed lobster was perfect! I rarely eat steak because it doesn't taste appealing. BUT this was so amazing and I understood why people love steak! Haha. 

2. The seafood stew-cipionnio was the best ever broth. The seafood was bountiful and tender. I ordered it without the couscous. 

3. Most of all, the server was personable, but professional. He was so accommodating and respected our space as we took our time, laughed, and enjoyed the whole experience. The waters were always filled. The wait staff was smiling, friendly, and very attentive. 

4. Make a reservation for around 5:30pm. Why? Most kitchens are ready and eager to start cooking. Anytime after 6:30pm, usually kitchens are slammed. The noise level was quiet and we weren't rushed.

This serene, and comfortable restaurant is sandwiched between many other fine dining restaurants, from French (Pinot Brasserie), whimsical and creative American cuisine (David Burke), to Emeril (Delmonico Steakhouse). Their prized seafood, flown in daily, is 80% of the dinner menu, also, boasts an expansive, wine list. The menu includes signature dishes, such as, the seafood plateau (enough for two).  The plateau includes, 3 mussels, 3 clams, 3 prawns, 2 crab claws, 6 oysters on a half shell, 2 oyster ponzu shooters, and a small dish of shrimp ceviche (side note: massive dish, prawns were shrimp, ponzu shooters were too sweet and might be a lil on the spicy side for the general public). The presentations of the John Dory with lobster stuccotash and sweet corn broth and Jumbo Louisana Prawns on a bed of curried forbidden black rice were aesthetically appealing, but a tad under-seasoned. Again, very fresh seafood. Dessert; Pear Frangipane with Vanilla ice cream and caramel sauce, garnished with a pear chip and a Mint Chocolate Cake with mint ice cream and a chocolate sauce, garnished with chocolate flutes, once again, aesthetically pleasing, although, the ice cream somewhere other than on top of the cake. The service was a roller coaster. Our server, somewhat disappeared and another server/food runner took over and saved her. Otherwise, a great dining experience.

Here are a few of the dishes i highly recommend:

To start, I would definitely order the seafood trio. It consists of shrimp cocktail, Maine lobster cocktail, and blue crab cocktail with the house mustard sauce.  All three were delicious, but the blue crab was AMAZING! It was juicy & full of flavor. I would return just to have that crab! We also had a pot of clams (I can't remember the actual name of the dish) which was equally as delicious and flavorful.

As entrees we had the filet mignon and the John Dory. Again, both were great, but the John Dory was seriously superb. I'm usually a Chilean sea bass type of person, but I was pleasantly surprised by its great flavor. It was cooked to perfection - tender and juicy. This will definitely be my entree of choice if I get the chance to dine here again.

We did have dessert, which was very tasty, but I'm since not huge on dessert, many of them taste similar to me and thus don't really stand out. I will say, however, that their banana cake is probably the best I've ever had.

So, would I return? YES! Do I highly recommend? YES! In addition to excellent food, the staff was extremely friendly, not pretentious, and very knowledgable.

This review is actually just for the bar which I visited twice on last weeks trip, but I did have the pleasure to dine with Aquaknox this time last year.

I'm actually allergic to fin-fish (swimming fish as opposed to shell fish) so I'm probably not the guy to write a dining review.  The bar service is great and our waitress was spicy, friendly and on the ball.  There was definitely energy in the area but it was not too loud and at one point someone in our party got a little rowdy and other guests noticed/.  Not bad, just a sign that you can carry on a civilized conversation without straining your voice.

My recollections of last years meal are positive and the service at the bar this year was exceptional enough that I would definitely recommend this establishment whether you are on vacation with loved ones or friends; or on your way back from walking the Sands Expo floor with clients or co-workers.

The complimentary bread was very hard, day old bread? Probably the worst bread I have ever had a restaurant. Wait..the food got a lot better after that. 

I tried the peach, tomoate and mozzarella salad. The cheese was the softest mozzarella I have ever had, very creamy consistency. The gave just enough for the salad. The salad was different beacuse of the peaches. I think I would have liked it more if it had been more traditional without the peaches though.

My date had the lobster bisque. There was hardly any lobster bits in it, but the soup had a nice flavor.

For the main course, I had the rib cap steak. It was a smaller cut, 8oz. It was served with crispy thin onion rings, mashed potatoes and a sauce. I really liked eating the steak with the onion. The steak was really prepared and very tender. I had asked for medium rare and my date had asked his steak to be medium. They brought out bought at medium. The did quickly replace mine though. I figured they must have had another medium rare one that had just been completed?

For dessert we had the Belgian Chocolate Smores. The dessert is very rich, I could only eat half of it. The marshmellows were made of a paste instead of an actually marshmellow, which I think would have worked better. The paste was pretty firm. 

The service was nice, there s a waiter and a food runner/water replinsher that helped alot. We say him way more than our waiter. The chef and manager both stopped by briefly to ask how things were.

Overall, we had a good experience. I don't think I will be back as there are many other restaurants in Vegas that I would like to try. If you want steak you must go to Gordon Ramsey's STEAK in the Paris hotel!!",5sSy0cGq2SbDx4hYHdHRtw,2,2,3,rUkjw5-dMG3djU7P696wRQ

We made the reservations Saturday afternoon and they were able to accomodate us, for that night, so I was hesitant about this place.  Labor day weekend, Saturday night, and not booked? what gives? 

Well I was pleasantly surprised.  The place is unassuming from outside (located in the Venetian) but inside is tastefully decorated.  I loved all the soothing blue colors they used throughout. 

We were seated promptly and our server was stellar.  You could tell he was experienced and swiftly took our drink orders.  I heard him make some suggestions for wine as well as signature dishes to try.  

I decided to splurge on myself and ordered the crab stuffed lobster.  Now I've had lobster at chain restaurants, as well as fine dining establishments, but the lobster they brought out was the biggest I'd ever seen.  It was sliced in half exposing all of the wonderful meat, crab stuffing and served with drawn butter.  It was pure indulgence.  

The lobster was tender and sweet and the crab stuffing was savory and flavored well.  And then, dunking it all into the melted butter! It  was  too much for my taste buds! Needless to say, I was glad I decided to splurge because it was a well spent $70.  Oh yeah, there were vegetables served on the side, but clearly the lobster was the star.  

I did hear a few comments about the roasted chicken being too salty but overall, I think everyone else enjoyed their meals.  Honestly, I was too busy enjoying my lobster to even care.",xTiBmcHwiG5hZIO70gu5TA,0,0,4,MhSv9HK98Je_xVutUTR3gw

My family and I are frequent diners along the Las Vegas strip and we've had our share of fine dining (Joel Robuchon, Picasso, Le Cirque, N9NE steakhouse, Eiffel Tower, etc.) and not once has Aquaknox disappointed us! I also lived in San Francisco/Bay Area for 5 years and nothing has compared to the quality of food or service that this restaurant provides!

Aquaknox's level of service is unparalleled. With the advent of their new manager, Min, we are always being taken care of and leave satisfied beyond our heart's content. One evening, my mother had requested for a pina colada, but it was not on their menu as they did not have a blender. My mom had no problem requesting for another drink, yet Min personally ran to neighboring restaurants to find a blender. For years, this has been our go-to seafood place (not to mention our favorite restaurant) when we're looking for a fancier-than-normal-kind-of-night.

- Steamed mussels (request for extra bread!)
- Lobster cocktail w/ citrus garlic aioli
- Sweet shrimp and lump crab salad
- Lobster bisque (you can smell its heavenly essence from across the table)
- Filet mignon / Surf n Turf
- Pacific prawns on couscous with lobster cream
- Red Snapper on truffle potato puree

That's not usually a great sign but the restaurant itself is pretty and we all like seafood. I personally ordered two appetizers as an entree, the foie gras and the mussels. Most of my friends ordered the scallops and a few had other fishes.

The foie gras was quite strange. It was very tough and gamey. They should just take that one off the menu. The mussels were pretty good. A good size and the thai sauce and rice were done well.

My friends had no complaints about the scallops or fish but said it was nothing spectaulor for the price. They more had complaints about feeling rushed. Our server and the busboys were a little too pushy with trying to remove plates and bring the check.

One of my freeloading meals - one of the few joys of the grind.

I can now say i've eaten at every restaurant at the Venetian ( though i still haven't done reviews on a few of them  - for example, Valentino - no pics, no review ! ) 

The overall impression of AquaKnox - nice.  It ain't stunning/earth-shattering, but it's solid and if i was in the seafood mood and on the northern side of the Strip  and not looking/affording over the top ( as in Bartolotta ) - this is the place to hit.

I tried the Lobster Bisque ( pic added ) 

And the whole , fresh fish of the day ( pic added ) - to be honest - i can't remember the name but i was told it had a similar taste/texture to sea bass ... and it did .  Kinda surprised that they didn't de-bone it at the table (  i think the prices justified such a service ) but it was fairly easy to separate the meat from the bones .

Surprsingly, I didn't  have dessert - a usual pleasure  again, when it's on another person's expense account - so i have no opinion on the desserts.

The seafood cocktails were about 3 oz each of shrimp(around U30) with a bit of spice, lobster and crab.  I had a hard time differentiating the two, and there was more than acceptable amount of shell in them, and not that fresh tasting either.

Would not ever eat here again.

My girlfriend I came here for dinner on Monday, 6/1/15.  I had made a reservation and made note that it was our Anniversary.  The hostess even called earlier in the day to confirm the reservation and confirm that it was an anniversary and that she would make sure they did something special for us.  Nothing special every happened....so that was kinda disappointing.  

We arrived and were seated promptly in a circular booth thing which was nice.  I'll agree with some other reviews that say the decor and ambiance is a little cheesy.  It is.  It's kinda Ikea-meets-modern-asian-fusion-vibe.  Everything just looks kinda cheap.  

Anyway,  we were promptly greeted by the server (Miller) and he gave us some time to look over the menus.  When he came back he answered any questions we had.  He was very thorough and very helpful.  

Drinks:
She got some rosemary gin thing.  I got an Old Fashioned.  Both were pretty average cocktails.  Nothing Spectacular. But they were good.  

We then ordered some appetizers:
Octopus Carpacchio and Little Neck Clams.  Both were pretty darn good.  The butter sauce on the clams could be enjoyed on it's own haha.  So good.  

Ordered more drinks:
We decided to get wine this time.  As we were looking at the list, the Sommelier noticed and stopped by the provide some recommendations.  He was honest and not trying to sell the most expensive wine, he was going based upon our likes/dislikes.  We ordered a two different wines and they were great selections.  

Entrees:  
She got the Butterfish, I got a Filet.  Both were great.  The Butterfish was pretty amazing.  Texture and flavor were perfect.  

Dessert:  
Banana Cream Pie and Creme Br√ªl√©e.  They were both good desserts.  Interesting presentation on the Banana Cream Pie.  

My girl was curious about Absinthe, so the server gave her a little taste.  That was nice of him to do.  

We got the check, paid and left.  

I was kinda disappointed that there was ""nothing special"" for an anniversary.  Why would the hostess bother to say ""we will do something special for you"" if there was nothing special.  My girlfriend even asked ""did you tell them it was our anniversary?"" I said, ""yup, but i guess they didn't want to do anything.""

We were seated in a lovely booth with high ceiling and cascading curtains. It was a bit drafty, so we moved to the booth next door. The booths were romantic and private, compared to the other tables.  

Our servers, Mark and Zack, were attentive and approachable, not pretentious at all. Just a couple of nice guys who actually care about our dining experience. We didn't like the breadsticks but the dip they brought with it was delightful. We ordered a dozen fresh oysters, consisting of 3 varieties (Shigoku, Miyagi, and Gold Creek) and 3 sauces. They were super fresh and went down so easy with Prosecco, we ordered another dozen of the Shigoku Oysters, which were even tastier and slightly larger than Kumamoto Oysters. After two dozen superb oysters, we felt we had reached Oyster Nirvana. 

We ordered a Romaine Heart of Lettuce to share. It was a generous helping even with the split. The lettuce was crisp and the Caesar dressing was spot on.  Then Zack surprised us with two small crab cakes which was compliments of the Chef. They blew our minds away! We would definitely order those again and again.

We ordered both the Steamed Mussels and Steamed Little Neck Clams to share. The Mussels were definitely the tastier of the two, even better than the mussels at Bouchon. You could taste the freshness in each bite. My Hubby loved the mussel broth so much he practically made a meal out of dipping the crispy buttered bread into the Chardonnay Herbed Butter broth. 

By the time the Grilled Whole Branzino came, we were quite full already. It was a bit under-salted, but nothing a bit of sea salt could not fix.  Again, they split it into two nice plates for us and we devoured every last morsel.

My wife and I were treated like we were 16 at a prom dinner. Started with the irritation after we ordered oysters, he offered zero information about them so I asked our sever  where are they from - his reply was ""I am not sure... "" and then told us where he thought they might be from but was annoyed at the question. Next up drinks, my wife ordered a white wine by the glass and they have two symbols, one a half full glass another a full glass. He informed me the full one obviously meant 9 oz. I asked for the beer list and he told me about the 3 choices on draft and then said and we have a ton of bottled beers and asked what I like, and I said pilsner or on the lighter side, after an awkward pause he offered no further explanation or  choices do I asked about the bottles and said well those are Millers, bud, etc. it's hard to imagine a 4 dollar sign vegas restaurant only has bud and Miller. He then told us we need to order now because the food is made to order- we did upon his advise and we had our food within 10 min of ordering- the whole experience was 50 min total- for once we were not trying to eat fast and wanted to sit and enjoy a long meal. The last straw was when trying to order a salad, I ordered barramundi entree and he said how about a salad with that so I said sure what are my options- he plopped the menu on my plate and pointed to the salad category. In general the attitude was unappreciated from a higher end restaurant. The replacement server was excellent and we had no further dealings with Miller for the rest of the night. Food was fairly tasty but there are countless other alternatives. We have tried the next door restaurant delmonicos and Le cirque and liked both much better.

Update: the general manager of the restaurant reached out to apologize and ask for a second chance- I am impressed to the attention to postings and while I was not intending to gain anything I appreciate the offer to have my wife and return.

The plus was that they knew ahead of time that it was my husband's birthday and a late anniversary trip. So they greeted us with that in mind. It was just the two of us and we're both big seafood people. To start, he had the Steam Greenlip Mussels and I had the Lobster Bisque Soup...they were so delicious. 

We enjoyed every bite of our starters and the portions were perfect. The lobster bisque was nice and rich and creamy without being heavy. It was good enough to want to come back - and that's considering there are restaurants at every corner on the strip, and even within the Venetian. 

The Mussels were yummy. We're fans of curry so the aroma and spice were superb. To give it to you straight, they were bomb. Both appetizers were bomb. 

Our entrees consisted of the Ora King Salmon and the New Bedford Scallops. I had the scallops, so my review will be much more detailed than the salmon. The scallops come with squid ink pasta that is perfectly cooked. Initially, I wanted to devour the pasta, but slicing a piece of scallop paired perfectly. There were many different pieces to my dish and the flavors worked for me, I loved it. I couldn't finish the plate though, and ended up taking a scallop and some of the other pieces of the dish and took it back up to our hotel. My husband did not finish his either - but he did say it was delicious. I had a bite, and from what I could tell, it tasted great.

Since it was my husband's birthday they came out with a surprise complementary dessert for us. They were two macarons with a pink yougurty drink. It reminded me of the little bottles of Korean yogurt drinks.

On my last trip to Vegas my friend, the birthday girl, decided to have her birthday dinner at Aquaknox.  Finally given the chance to try the cuisine, I have to admit that I was not very impressed.  The Sommelier was moderately helpful in the end but during the process of selecting a wine she continuously suggested wines that were clearly out of the price range we were looking.  (I hate when Sommeliers do that.  I'm not going for the $180 bottle of wine tonight, thanks).  In the end she was able to produce two bottles of a nice chardonnay not on the menu.  

The butter lettuce and herb salad was good, the dressing was nice and light and the salad was a good size.  The shrimp cocktail, however, was not as good.  It was literally downed in cocktail sauce.  I'm the kind of girl that likes to dip (my husband on the other hand likes to smother) and I didn't appreciate the pint of cocktail sauce on my shrimp.

It is fish that I can live without, but I do like shrimp, crab and lobster. Fitting with that, I and my business travel companion shared the Seafood Trio appetizer: sweet shrimp, lobster and jumbo crab served with AquaKnox cocktail sauce. The name is rather misleading as only the shrimp comes with the cocktail sauce. Each of the three meats comes plated with its own unique sauce. Of the three, though I liked them all, the crab was my least favorite. 

I ordered their Bone-In Ribeye, though the menu online shows ""Bisteca (32 oz. Prime Double Cut Porterhouse)."" I cannot say if that is new to the menu or if the ribeye is instead. What I can tell you is that the competition in my search for the best steak in Las Vegas just got a little tougher. The ribeye came over root vegetables. I feel bad saying that the ribeye at AquaKnox is one of the best steaks in 'Vegas if it is not even an option anymore. I cannot speak to the porterhouse, though I would be tempted to try a ""serves two"" steak alone! 

The prices were not outrageous, though I had expected them to be. Most main dishes were around $30. If you need to find it, the restaurant is located outside the Blue Man Group Theatre. 

AquaKnox has not converted me to the ways of seafood, but through steak they have helped me recommend this restaurant to you.

A few of the cocktails on the menu were trying too hard to be unique. I started with some sort of spice-laden old fashioned which was brimming with fruit and other froo froo ingredients, but switched to a manhattan and was fine. (It was the first old fashioned my girlfriend has liked, so they were successful in making it a girly drink.) The Riesling I had with dinner was not the best either. 

But on to the food. 

We started with the raw oyster selection, which was excellent, very fresh. The Alaskan king crab leg appetizer, served chilled with a little bit of lemon and Tabasco was amazing, we should have ordered the larger portion. 

The John Dory was the highlight for me, and the scallops in a blood orange sauce were for my girlfriend. The scallops were a bit firm for me, but still very flavorful.",dEjGsJ5H1vk0E0DAI4LLFw,4,1,5,0BLqInS1f7QBijNJfFTVkQ
1943266,2008-02-22,1,25wTaO0_Rk-GLb4k2uMs0Q,"What clouded the experience was the idiot that was serving us.  

Not sure if it was his first week on the job, but he missed an ENTIRE course and was condescending when we asked for only ONE of the crab claws.  

Verbatim on WHY he missed the salad course:
""The order (sheet)  was all funky, so I scratched it out and wrote a new one.""

YES, you read right, he said, FUNKY in a white tablecloth restaurant.  

I guess he didn't learn to COPY things in elementary school.

He didn't apologize for his screw up.  ARGH!!!!  

And WE had to give him ideas on how to alleviate HIS mistake.  He screwed up, he should fix it, and COMP something.  He suggested that we skip the course, b/c even if we heated our main courses it would compromise the quality.  OKAY....but we still want our damn salads, it takes FIVE minutes to throw a salad together, and we already waited FIVE minutes for him to notice that we didn't touch our food.  

Our main courses were already lukewarm.  God.  RECOGINIZE foolio.  

Hence, to save his dumb ass, he was on top of things for the rest of the meal, to the point of annoying.  I hate that.  

FREEBIE: Breadsticks, super yum, they were dusted with black pepper and the dip was smoked salmon pate.  FAB.  

Things to order: 
Scallops, very good, they were HUMONGOUS!!!  The combined net weight was probably more than a 10 ounce steak.  Meaty, tender & flavorful.  

To skip:
-Trio was alright, not delicate, the sauces covered up the crab, tuna, and lobster flavors.  The lobster was rubbery.
-Red snapper, bland, and tough.  DRY.  

Was the wait for the salads worth it?  Not really.  It was the Caesar and the Bibb...

The last FREEBIE.  Mmmm...they were little triangles of brownie bites with chocolate rice crisps.  So save your $$$ and don't order dessert.

We were sat in the center of the restaurant against the railing, ask for a booth, overall the ambiance was better than most of the restaurants in the Venetian and the Palazzo.",53bZ_EsXH71L7iFs5MP9_w,2,1,3,e5G_rV32pQQ0PMVvFPIw5A

1953754,2007-11-04,0,25wTaO0_Rk-GLb4k2uMs0Q,"I went to Las Vegas for the weekend and I was craving for a good seafood restaurant.  I'm glad I chose Aquaknox. I enjoyed the decor of the restaurant with its underwater-like environment. I also saw the owner chef, Tom Moloney, walking around the dining room every once in a while. I think it was kinda refreshing considering not many of the owner celeb chefs work in their kitchens anymore. 

For my meal I chose the crab cake, lobster bisque, pan-seared grouper, and the interpretation on s'mores with peanut butter ice cream. There was an amuse of peppery bread sticks and smoked trout dip. Nothing too special but something nice to snack on at the beginning of the meal. The crab cake was good but since it was labeled ""jumbo lump"" you would actually see lump crab meat. I mean it was nothing but crab but the integrity of the lump was gone in the making of it. The lobster bisque itself was of total lobster essence with a few nuggets of lobster meat and a dollop of creme fraiche and caviar. The lobster was slightly chewy but, what the hell, it's lobster so I ate it with great gratification. The grouper was delicious as it was sitting on top of a bed of soba noodles, baby bok choy, and little shiitake mushrooms and all surrounded in a sea of lobster broth. The glaze on the grouper was sweet and a bite of spice from the sriracha in the glaze. Finally, the ""s'mores"" dessert was a chocolate mousse with graham cracker cookie bottom surrounded by milk chocolate and topped with marshamallow and accompanied with a small scoop of peanut butter ice cream. Very satisfying and a nice ending to a great meal.

Service I must say was very attentive, especially by the secondary waiter. The primary waiter who took my order was nice but was rarely seen after that. It looked like he was attending the bigger parties in his area. It was fine because the secondary waiter filled my water on time, asked me if I wanted a second helping of the smoked trout dip, asked if everything was OK with my meal, replaced my silverware at the appropriate times, and took my dessert order. So kudos to the secondary waiter.

My experience at Aquaknox was well worth it. I would definitely go back there if I had a craving for some great, fresh seafood with attentive service.",V0Kg9fkgfoCNvYpNJcv0Ng,0,0,4,Hwpk6gvgI-eyo5FyekDNOA

Wife and I wanted to discover some new foods in Vegas, so the plan was to order things I wouldn't normally order. We also expected some over-the-top service and experiences. AquaKnox delivered on all of it, hands down. Please note, we're not really foodies, but we like great flavors and food, and we know good service...

From the first moment walking into AquaKnox we knew we were seeing something orders of magnitude better than our dinner the night before (at Canaletto). The service was impeccable. We ordered our meal and the sommelier came by to offer her recommendations -- she offered a great wine for dinner that was really excellent. As one would expect in a great establishment, the wine was kept chilled near the table, and we were frequently checked on and our wine was never low...

Our dining experience began with a really great amuse-bouche, delivered with the first pour of the wine. The single bit was a nice start!  For an appetizer, I started with the squash blossom appetizer, holding true to my ""I wouldn't normally order this, but what the hell"" approach for this trip. Wow. It was like experience the ultimate spring garden - the baby greens, pea shoots, delicately fried squash blossoms were all incredible. Perfectly dressed.  The best appetizer I have ever had.

For an entr√©e, I chose the whole sea bass and a side of the corn succotash (with edamame). The fish was perfectly cooked and very tasty, and the skin was incredibly crispy.  I found myself rationing the skin to enjoy it with every bite. The succotash was over the top good -- clearly nothing I had had the privilege of enjoying growing up!

For desert, I had the pumpkin cheesecake -- clearly nothing I would normally have gotten. Clearly I would have been depriving myself. The ginger caramel and spiced orange ice cream was an amazing compliment to the rich pumpkin cheesecake.

The meal ended with another single bite of chocolate and a refreshing lemon vodka.

From start to finish, AquaKnox single handedly delivered what we had hoped Vegas would deliver on. The service throughout was incredible and the food was always great and mind-blowing at times (wow, that appetizer).

AquaKnox was the first place we came to, and we decided to just hop in and give it a shot. Wow. Could be the best restaurant we ate at the entire trip.
We were informed it would be about 5 minutes for our table to be ready, as it was pretty full, so we were sat at the bar. We were immediately helped by the bartender, and I ordered a sweet tea vodka / lemonade drink which was absolutely spectacular. The bartender was very friendly and gave us some tips on where else to eat and drink in the area, and after a few minutes we were seated at our table.
Love the atmosphere of the restaurant. Blue lights and blue drapes surround everything, giving it a very ""Aqua"" feeling, light music playing, and although the majority of people were dressed very well, the place had an upscale, but very relaxed atmosphere.
Our server was spectacular. Very professional and courteous, attentive, and took care of all our needs. The appetizers were unbelievable- love the smoked salmon puree given to you at the start of the meal. I had a seared tuna plate with cous cous for a main meal- un-f'n-believable. Could possibly be the greatest tasting food I've ever had. So fresh and tasty, it was perfect. There were lots of different choices as far as main course meals- you can definitely find something to eat as long as you're into seafood, that's for sure.
Overall, VERY glad we stopped into this place to eat, it definitely set the tone for the AWESOME Vegas trip we were about to have. Fantastic food, fantastic service, fantastic setting, it doesn't get any better than this. If you're staying in the Venetian / Palazzo, make sure you stop here. If you're on the strip and looking for good seafood, make a point to stop in and eat. Definitely one of the best, and I WILL be back.",UY3x_8KhKlrqVSDE0QKV8A,0,0,5,RtgzP3tcpo0WHGxl77vAHw

Located in between the Venetian and palazzo.. 

A fabulous restaurant that ceased to amaze both Matt and I. 

Upon arrival, we already had existing reservations made the day off, we asked for a nice booth (they're big, round, and give more of a private area although along side of the restaurant)

As we were seated, the hostess was THE kindest and warming young lady.. that also placed my napkin on me gently and properly before handing me the menu. 

What I enjoyed a lot is the tag team servers we had. As a duo, these gentlemen gave us an unforgettable dining experience. I feel so bad for forgetting their names but I believe they were of the Filipino descent. But seriously, it's like they read each other's minds. We would request something from one guy and bam! The other guy pops up with it in literally like 2 seconds. 

Onto food....

We started with 1dz oysters - varying with 3 different kinds. And may I say it was DELISH. 

Followed by the entrees..
Scallops - ABSOLUTELY PERFECT. Deserves more than 5 stars. If the spaghetti squash or squid ink pasta mix up TJ texture along with the perfectly mixed sauce... I just don't even know. Scallops we're cooked medium rare and it was perfect. 

Matt ordered a fish, that comes (mostly) deboned paired with veggies, such as potatoes, spinach and something else. But the fish had an amazing freshness to it and a chili flavor. You can get the fish either headless or with the head (your preference) 

We also ordered a side of chef's choose of veggies which worked in our favor. We had a zucchini lightly coated with Panko crust and some cheese flavor. The combination of crunchy panko and a perfectly cooked zucchini?!? A party in our mouths. 

We had a few kamikaze shots from the bar as well and they were fresh and STRONG. 

We ended being way too full for dessert, but the chef was kind enough to have us try his peaches n cream paired with a cheesecake cookie.

We ordered a platter of 12 oysters for the table to start and then each ordered entrees: seared ahi tuna, scallops, and grilled whole fish.  The oysters (~$30) were the standout of the night: fresh, tender and perfectly briny, served with wedges of lemon and individually-sized bottles of Tabasco sauce.  Perfectly seared, slightly sweet scallops were served on a bed of sweet corn, mushrooms and chive-mashed potatoes.  The grilled fish was accompanied by wonderfully roasted cherry tomatoes which may have eclipsed the fish itself.  The seared ahi was technically perfectly, but the sauce was remarkably (overly?) strong and sweet.  Portion sizes were reasonable for a restaurant of this caliber and prices ran $35 - 40 per entree.  The birthday girl received, on the house, a lovely triangle of rich chocolate cake with a candle and a ""happy birthday"" engraved on a chocolate disk.  Finally, a small plate of complimentary rhombus-shaped chocolate squares finished the meal.

Aqua Knox also features an extensive wine list, off of which we ordered the Baileyana Chardonnay ($57), with the help of the sommelier who directed us toward our stated preference for something dry and oaky. 

Through the course of the evening we interacted with two waitresses and two sommeliers.  While all were pleasant, the upselling pressure  was immense.  We were continually directed toward wines more expensive than our preferred range and asked numerous times if we wanted to order more appetizers, salads, soups, and desserts.  Judging by our appearances (nicely dressed but very young) and our firm ""no""s to all extraneous offers, I would think our price point was clear.  I'm not particularly sensitive to upselling, but the amount of marketing here was enough to leave me with unfond memories.

Overall, exquisite food but not particularly unique nor a great value (although it's hard to imagine that any of the celebrity restaurants in Vegas could be considered a great value).  A solid pick though if you're looking for exceptionally fresh (flown in daily) and well-prepared seafood.",iky7OmQ2ALetFgIw0AsiMA,1,1,3,OALT6OFzkvcG_RbBw78ZHA

It was kind of embarrassing how much I ate but when it is so fresh, nicely displayed and served with the best cocktail sauce I have ever had...well what is one to do at that point? The cocktail sauce is a little heavy on the horseradish so it has some kick. Ooweeee! This place is definitely upscale and expensive. Don't bring your kids or cheap friends here for drinks and dinner. The ambiance is romantic but hip.

5th of all, 
I'm starting with dessert at the end. Imagine a tasting for every dish. My party of 3 enjoyed this ridiculous tasting of 9 gourmet ice cream flavors in its own. Some of which were the traditional, vanilla bean and mango passion, and then the untraditional- Thai iced tea, guiness, lychee, butterscotch. Chef from kitchen had fun by allowing us to guess flavors, and later coming out at the end to see what we came up with.

4th of all, for the steak lovers,
Glazed with green peppercorn sauce, the Prime ribeye(calf), folded to be seasoned inside and out. seared filet style for texture and juiciness sprinkled with Saba beans and baby carrots on a bed of potato corn pur√©e.  Ahh hosed with deliciousness.

3rd, seafood, yes their fort√©
How about that butter poached halibut in a bed of yellow tomato sauce. With eggplant caponata.

2nd,
Raw salmon seared with pumpernickel crust. Basil cream and basil blossom.  give me a break. I'm utterly in love with seafood more so. Stop. No. Don't stop.

1st of all, lobster bisque with caviar on top. Best 5,000 calories ever consumed(I'm over exaggerating on the calories) 

Bread sticks in a vase served with smoked fish mousse while we eagerly wait with our Shirley temps.

Primely, service is tops. These kids specialized in serving us very well, and describing each culinary dish as it was delivered. Mmm they know their stuff, it's obvious they do their kitchen homework. 

Note, 
We came for our best friend's bday and they treated her like a queen, so I highly recommend to spend your benjamin's at this place if you'd like to enjoy fine dining and freshest fish n primo meats.",DASkWfrV6kWHE_4xC7BkYQ,4,2,5,D6HRkoenqslS3lw9oK0rMg

You would think for about $7.50 a piece, they should taste AMAZING, but no. You can purchase better tasting seafood prepackaged at Costco or Safeway.

So not only was it extremely expensive, the food was completely unappetizing, flavorless and our group left HUNGRY.

Both my servers were great and checked on me often. When it came to the menu, I had a difficult time choosing, but settled on the lobster bisque, a glass of proseco, and their stuffed lobster (sold at market price).  Their lobster bisque was probably one of best I've had thus far and that is one of my favorite soups to order. It did not have large chunks of lobster as I have experienced previously at other places, but the flavoring was so creamy and delicious. My stuffed lobster came with asparagus spears and the lobster was cut in half so I didn't have to work too hard to get to the meat. I did not have enough room for sweets, but my server still brought me something light in celebration of my birthday. It was a petit creme puff and a peach yogurt drink.

we started off our dinner with some drinks; i got the dr. heidemanns-bergweiler riesling and my friend got blue moon. the riesling was definitely one of the best i've ever had. it was very light and not too sweet like other rieslings. 

for our appetizers, i got the pacific prawns which came with a horseradish cocktail sauce, and my friend got the hollander mussels in a chardonnay herb butter broth. i'm not a huge mussel or clam person, but the mussels were super tender and the broth was absolutely delicious. my appetizer came with about five pieces of big sized prawns and a side of the horseradish cocktail sauce. the prawns were super meaty and you can taste the freshness. 

for the main course, i got the mt. cook alpine king salmon which came with a fall vegetable ragout, micro sorrel, and suace buerre blanc. since again i was watching the amount of sauce and fat in my meal, i ordered my salmon without the sauce and replaced the ragout with a side of steamed veggies. the salmon was about 6 oz which was a great portion, and like the prawns, was super fresh, flaky, and moist. my friend got the georges bank scallops, which came with clack truffle creamed corn and applewood smoked bacon polenta. she's not a huge fan of polenta, so she ordered a side of french fries instead. the french fries were thin cut and yummy! i didn't try any of the scallops, since it was topped with truffle oil and i'm highly allergic to truffle oil. but my friend did say it was very fresh and delicious. 

besides the amazing and fresh food, the ambience and friendly staff were out of this world. our servers were jesse and tonya, and they were super friendly and helpful. make sure you ask for them if you ever decide to try this place! jesse was very accommodating to my requests, since i was watching my caloric intake, and made sure that i was comfortable with my dish and the ingredients that were going into it. additionally, the food was not as overpriced as one would expect it to be.

They have a private dining area sectioned off by a glass wall so it looks like diners are sitting inside a fish tank, which I thought was very cool. The atmosphere was relaxing and service proved that dining here was worth every penny.

Highlights off the dinner menu include jumbo lump crab cakes served over a bed of market vegetable relish and citrus aioli; seared fennel dusted ahi tuna; an upscale rendition of S'mores (yes ... but cleaner and no melty marshmallows all over your hands), ultra-smooth vanilla creme brulee, and a tasty, though not tart enough, lychee sorbet.",nfp5M3TiAeiq8ANwzrFuqQ,0,0,4,fZMwAqLzylpyQ2m4nNDY-w

When you charge a certain price, you expect a certainly level of freshness of the seafood and service.  This place lacks in both on the night that we visited.

Decor: 5/5
I really liked the look of this place... to the point that we were looking at hosting our wedding reception here but decided to check it out before requesting a proposal for our event.  Visually, I love it.

Cleanliness: 5/5
It was very clean.  No spotty silverware or glasses.  No random napkins under the table.  It's exactly what you would expect.

Food: 3/5
So the food was ""good"".  It's just not where it should have been for the price point.  We didn't get any bread.  I saw other tables with one, but we were never offered one. My fiance food it strange then was a bit upset when he saw another table with a bread basket.  The lobster bisque made you wonder what you were paying for and where the lobster was.  It's like a bad Scooby-Doo mystery.  My other complaint is around the fact that the seafood was really not all that fresh. I ordered the lobster dinner.  Many the local seafood places off of the Strip have fresher food. Many restaurants in the same range on the Strip have better quality seafood. I was really surprised by this with all of the accolades that they post on the website; however, if you see the plaques on the way to the restroom, they are from several years prior... and the food definitely tastes like it. (Correction: They were awarded in 2017.  Still baffling for me unless I just got a bad lobster. The service really has mad me quite grumpy. No excuse.  I should have fact checked this statement.)

Service: 1/5
I had the would have to say I've had the worst waitress that I have ever had in my entire life.  She took our order with a bit of a snotty attitude, and we didn't see her again until she dropped off the check and was looking for her tip. I couldn't tip her, and I always tip.  I ended up withdrawing cash in the casino and giving is to the assistant because I was told that if I put anything on the check that it would go to her. Not gonna happen!  Her assistant did the best he could but seemed new to this type of service.  He had such a willing, helpful attitude that it made you really lose sight of that... especially after dealing with the waitress staring at our table as she walked by but never actually saying anything to us.  I definitely got the impression that we were not welcome and/or wanted. I let the manager know my thoughts with examples when I left.

I would never host anything at this restaurant! It would be an embarrassment to have them deal with the service that we experienced.",PpaIA3DA_0Y_XpGHPxgjLg,0,0,2,TEx_RFWB9LXqFQ2C5Ba8uQ

We made a reservation through open Table on a Friday night . I actually had to call and change the reservation time twice and they accommodated me both times with no problem at all. I was surprised that when we arrived we were seated right away. 

Starters 

The Florida Pink Flamingo Ceviche: Lobster Roe, Lemon, Cilantro, shishito peppers & red chili tortilla strips. 
 Very Tasty! 

Truffle Burrata Salad came with 
Truffled Burrata shaved asparagus , summer squash, shaved heirloom baby carrots, fennel cream, dried shallots & top with some delicious sterlet caviar!

Crispy Kennebec French Fries 

I would actually recommend NOT ordering these. The waiter told us these were a ""must order"" and they were Definitely NOT a MUST ORDER. They were fresh but I go to inn n out burger all the time (who also makes their fries homemade) and they are very comparable. Very. So it wasn't necessary for me to order those. 

Entrees 

The Seared Sea Scallops were prepared with 
Fennel Pollen , wild mushrooms , crispy pancetta, romanesco crown, parsnip pur√©e and bee jus
It was unclear to me how this dish would turn out as I was unfamiliar with most of the ingredients.
I enjoy Scallops if they are cooked right, and they were. 
I noticed there were no mushrooms and broccoli instead. I would probably order something else next time however it was tasty ! 

We also had to go with the special on the Menu which were the  Alaskan King Crab Legs !  
( Served cracked chilled or hot)
These King Crab Legs were the real deal as I enjoyed every bite. I ordered mine chilled on ice which came with a mustard & cocktail sauce. If you like Alaskan King Can't go wrong with these. 

Next time I will order something with a little extra flavor like the Chilean Sea Bass or the Albacore 

The Service was really good ! We had one main server and a server helping him. The place wasn't too busy for a Friday night .

I don't drink but we had a party of 12 and those that had cocktails loved them. There was the LV-usual menu of house cocktails.  The bartender was accommodating, but when one of our party wanted a house specialty without an ingredient, the waitress came back and explained that the bartender felt the drink wouldn't be enjoyable and would she like something different? She would and she did. They were good.

I ordered an appetizer and then I asked the waiter for his opinion of a dish. He said that if I liked {my appetizer} then I would really like (his suggestion). OK, I'll try it. 

Wait staff is young and smart. Not too chatty, but if you engage them, they'll talk. Just the right amount. They were quick, accommodating and professional.

I had the lump crab cocktail and steak Oscar, both very excellant. I should have had the steak cooked more than medium, but that was my fault. I didn't mention it, but I think if I did, they would have helped me out. I got that vibe off them.

2596149,2015-12-11,0,25wTaO0_Rk-GLb4k2uMs0Q,"Excellent upscale restaurant for all yoExcellent upscale restaurant for all you seafood lovers! The seafood was excellent here, the land entrees, not so much! The blue theme of the restaurant really gives you the feeling of being underwater as you enter. We were offered booth or table seating and of course we chose to be nestled up in our own secluded booth--more comfortable and a lot more privacy! Here is a list of what we ordered:

-Crab cakes: Bomb diggity! Probably hands down the best crab cake I've ever tasted. Their crab cakes were chunky and you can see that they used real crab and no imitation crab meat. Perfect to the touch that when it enters into your mouth, you can still taste the texture and consistency of the crab. Yum! The tartar sauce it comes with adds the perfect balance to the crab cake. Usually, I'm not a huge fan of tartar sauce because it is way too strong for my taste, but this one was just right. I'm so happy I gave this one a try!

-Oysters: We ordered 6 oysters to start off our dinner with (2 small, 2 medium, and 2 large). The smallest ones from Washington were yummy. The medium and large ones from Washington and Virginia respectively tasted mushy like they were pregnant oysters. Definitely sticking to the smaller sizes from now on.

-Fois gras: Served with a bread pudding (which I found to be quite interesting because bread pudding is usually served for dessert), a slice of bacon, figs, and greens. This dish was a mix of too many flavors and textures. The fois gras tasted very gamey to me. The bread pudding just didn't belong. The figs were sweet and chewy. The bacon was the only part of the dish that tasted normal to me. We didn't even finish this dish. Not a dish I would order again.

-Sea Bass: Yum! Yum! Yum! This sea bass melts in your mouth the moment you eat it. So delicious! Came with chunks of lobster, corn, and edamame beans drenched in the sauce it came with. Very simple and pleasant to eat. 

-Bone-in-ribeye: Ribeye came sliced for you over a bed of mashed potatoes. The mashed potatoes outshined the ribeye for me unfortunately. The ribeye was drenched in the house sauce they supposedly ""drizzled"" over the meat. I think it would have tasted better if there was less sauce, so that I would have been able to taste the quality of the meat.

All in all, excellent restaurant! I would come again, but would definitely stick to ordering the seafood items here!",g_4zySOI_HisK5rG_2dw6Q,1,0,5,rh5iND6iF-PMNZZHFJFFRw

What I did not like was that the server was more concerned about 'selling' than my food interests. Upon ordering a significantly priced bottle of wine, he came back with a more expensive proprietary label bottle saying that I would probably like that better. Actually, I know my wine and ordered specifically to pair with my meal/my group's meal. When I asked why & what specific vineyard this wine came from- I stumped him into a babbling tangent with no specific answer.

In addition, they were really big on pushing their $80 seafood appetizer sampler. We were told that we should order that...""it's best for a table of four like this"". Really? We more than happily ordered ~ $100 in appetizers but, did not see the value in the mish-mash of items on the sampler.

I didn't feel like going on a mission to find authentic food outside the hotel and the place had just the right amount of people and volume for me to deal with (not too much, not too little). I took a seat at the bar and was helped by several very, very nice bartenders. It seems most bartenders in Vegas are a little on the jerky side, but this guy and girl were more along the lines of fine dining waiters than just bartenders.

My lite meal turned into a self made tasting menu of miyagi oysters, tuna tartar, and a butterleaf salad. One glass of white to start and one glass of red to finish. The oysters were awesome - served with a mignonette that made them pop. The tuna tartar had two sides to it - one was sliced and seared and the other was a true tartar. I would rather they just server a double of the tartar with some kind of eating vessel (like a fried wonton or something). The salad was pretty simple in ingredients, but it was perfect after the tuna and was presented in a beautiful blossom looking fashion. 

Tip included - about $120. Is that expensive? For burger king, ya. For a nice seafood restaurant in Vegas, not so much. That said, I did earn my ""High Rollers"" badge after checking in here on Yelp.",_scb0Wm-0SkBPLm0c-3Skg,3,2,4,75bV9g93MhuxmPIeDPmitw

Usually a restaurant will hit a home run in one or two of the categories but to knock it out of the park throughout each facet is very rare.  Our meal started with the Aqua Knox Plateau.  Lobster, oysters, prawns, mussels, ceviche, king crab and ponzu oyster shooters.  If i posted the picture, i think it would be the only picture needed to have you stop what you were doing and book immediately.  Too much to say as each item could have it's own paragraph.  To say the least, everything on the platter was fresh, ice cold, delicious and appetizing.  We were then treated with the King Salmon Tartare and Warm Octopus Carpaccio.  Both home runs.  Then we moved onto sharing the Butterfish, Whole Sea Bass and Fennel seared Albacore.  They didn't last long on the table. One of the most important facets of our dining experience is the wine pairing and our server was one of the most knowledgeable service staff we have had in a while.  I let him order the wine for us and didn't regret a single taste.  It's very rare in this trying economy to find a restaurant with service staff that take that amount of pride in cultivating their own palate to ensure a smooth and wonderful experience for the customer, just have to save kudos to that.  This server could have easily been the AGM and see a very bright future in his culinary career. Our meal finished with a dual dessert of cheesecake and flan and both were spectacular.

I ordered the infamous Lobster Bisque soup that everyone keeps talking about. And whoa....THAT BOWL WAS DELICIOUS!!!!!! Plus that small scoop of caviar on top of a crunchy bread stick a great additional as well. That was enough to get me half full.

My date suggested the Peruvian sea bass as our main dish. In the end, I was glad I agreed to his suggestion. I know fish is a healthy alternative. I normally drench my fish...or any type of seafood in lemon, peppers, sauces...all types of condiments. I like to mask that ""seafood-y taste."" But THIS sea bass did not need ANY of that. It was flavorful enough for me...and I'm big on flavoring. Also, what I really liked about this was the addition of mashed potatoes with a slight hint of crab meat.

Since most of our meals were pre-arranged catered events (we were in town for a convention), this became a rather difficult decision given our myriad restaurant options and only one night to dine out!  

In the end, my companion and I decided on Aquaknox.  We were both in the mood for seafood and some tasty cocktails.  I had been warned by other reviewers that the decor might be a bit cheesy (think 80s, Miami Vice, was what I remembered one reviewer wrote).  However, when we arrived there we were pleasantly surprised.  Surrounded by ""waterfalls"" on the windows and soft lights that changed from shades of green to blue, I actually felt a tranquil and calming influence instead of the modern, angular harshness that I had expected.  I ordered a Red Lotus martini and my companion had their signature Aquatini.  We found ourselves immediately relaxed.

We were both very happy with our appetizers and entrees.  The portions were perfect -- neither too big nor small, enough to satisfy my appetite without leaving me feeling too full.  My salad was loaded with ample servings of shrimp and crab.  The lobster bisque was delicious.  My grouper entree with the miso broth, soba noodles, shiitake mushrooms and bok choy was fresh and flavorful.  The scallops were seared to perfection.  

Above all, we were most impressed with the service.  We had about 4 waiters serving us throughout our meal.

I had the AquaKnox plateau and their crab claws tasted frozen that have been thawed out prior to opening.  Additionally,  the claws were not open/ cracked properly so I had difficulty getting to the crab meat.  They did not provide any utensil to de-shell the seafood.  Second,  the shrimp ceviche was bland. No flavor.  It was not worth $79. Third, the $53 AquaKnox fish soup was ""meh"". Average. My mom makes an amazing cioppino soup that'll knock your socks off compared to their fish soup.

My visit was a disappointment. I will not be back to AquaKnox unless they serve the fish soup with a golden spoon. 

Edited - Almost forgot about the dessert! It was the best part of the meal.  Apple pie donuts with vanilla ice cream was delicious. The minced apples inside each donuts made the dessert unforgettable. If you do decide to eat here,  be sure to save room for dessert as it's better than the main course.",8ktLyldH9JwNpD70-Ho2Tg,5,1,3,7H39FiRbWl1mUcl131Dd_g

My daughter and I started with the Tuna Tartare with Asian Pear infusion...delicious and so fresh it tasted like it had just landed on shore! Great combination of flavors. Anyway, onto an old classic, surf and turf...thought we'd give it a try. OMG, it was to die for! The filet was so tender you could cut it with a butter knife, and it was the perfect pink for med rare.  The stuffed Lobster (with crabmeat), was totally updated in flavor and delicious. Our server, Brad, described the Banana Cream Pie so well that we decided to give it a go...a wonderful decision on our part. It was the perfect flavor balance.

Came back for seconds on our last night in Vegas, we asked for our waiter from our previous trip who was amazing (Chris G). The staff including bartender that served us as they prepared our table, the front desk, even the ops manager made us feel amazing.

Today we ordered different items including a starter of lobster cocktail (amazing!) blue prawns, and finishing with a passion fruit chocolate marquis. Everything was cooked with care and had the most amazing flavors.

I asked the staff to pass on my gratitude to the chef. Jimmy the sous chef came out so we could talk, you can see the passion in his craft and he was very humble to hear about our great experience.

Lost the other star because the bar wasn't bussed. I sat at the bar waiting to meet clients around 7PM. There were dirty glasses and dirty plates.

I was in the mood for scallops, but after the waiter's incredibly convincing description of the shellfish platter, we opted for that as an appetizer, as well.  It was amazing... and this is coming from someone formerly (and still a little bit) afraid of removing the exoskeleton of crustaceans. He gave us an extra oyster shooter, too, since there were three of us and the platter was only designed for two. The bottle of red wine he suggested (I don't remember what it was, I was too enraptured with the seafood platter) went perfectly with the meal, too.

I agree with another reviewer who said the decor reminded them of South Beach.  I thought the same thing walking in with all the blues and whites. Very pretty and chic.

I was feeling kind of sick and can only vouch for the EXCELLENT lobster bisque and jumbo lump crab cocktail that I had. 

My boyfriend, on the other hand, had the Surf and Turf ""special"" which he said was very good...but much like any other steak and lobster he's had in other upscale restaurants. I guess the only thing special about it was the $85 price tag.

3021443,2009-01-19,3,25wTaO0_Rk-GLb4k2uMs0Q,"Man, I so wanted to like this restaurant.  I really did.  I needed an awesome seafood restaurant within the Venetian.  Instead I found it being rather mediocre... average at best, with some things being good and others being weak-to-bad.  And this is on two occasions to visit.

MENU OVERHYPE
I remember when I got to look at the menu for the first time, I licked my chops because the dishes looked fantastic.  For a seafood nut like myself, this looked like it was going to be heaven-on-earth.  But very consistently, the dishes were a disappointment.  It's as if the marketing hype of the menu was simply too hard for the kitchen to match.

ALL ABOUT SEAFOOD
I gave them a fair shot however.  When in a seafood restaurant, eat the seafood.  So I ignored the chicken & beef dishes and concentrated on the fish & crustaceans.  (Note these are dishes order over two dinners on two separate days)
-- Seafood Trio:  3/5 --- Mixed bag
-- Lobster Bisque:  2/5 --- Borderline Campbell's-worthy
-- Ahi Sashimi & Tartar:  3/5 --- Tuna was clearly refrigerated for a while
-- Crab stuffed lobster:  4/5 --- The only good thing during the dinner
-- Grilled Jumbo Prawns:  2/5 --- Lukewarm meat
-- Coconut Jumbo Prawns:  2/5  --- (Chef Special) WAY over-battered, more bread & coconut than shrimp
-- Alaskan King Crab Legs:  2/5   --- (Chef Special) Cold!  Unintentionally.  Sent this back to get reheated.

COLD FOOD?
Unfortunately, my feedback on virtually all the dishes that we were served was that either the dish was bland or it was straight served disturbingly luke warm.  Part of this could have to do with the fact that the service was consistently slow during both my visits.  I had to lasso a waiter during each visit - during a slow time during the day, mind you - to check on my wife's & my dishes.

WELL... IT'S EDIBLE, I GUESS:
Ultimately, however I'm not sure that it mattered.  I never found myself savoring any of the bites I ate.  I never found myself going, ""Mmm... that was goooood.""  I never thought, ""Where's that menu at?  I think I'd like to try something else on my next trip!""  No, I pretty much toward the end of the meal conceded, ""I'm not into really anything that's been served.  At all.""  That must be a record.  Usually at least one thing really stands out, and gets my juices flowing.  But not here.
...The exterior of this restaurant is very attractive and with all the water imagery, I would think it would drag in a pretty good customer base so I have to believe that it'll last a while no matter how weak the cuisine is.

CONCLUSION:
This isn't a place I'm going to go back to, no matter how pretty or convenient it is for being at the Venetian.  I value my dinners too much to put up with mediocre food.  For this kind of money, I still say that Rosewood Grille has the best lobster & crab.

It was early and we had spent a long day at the Las Vegas Convention Center.  We needed a good quiet quality (yet light) meal in the Venetian Hotel.  So as we strolled Restaurant Row we came upon Aquaknox.

We were seated at a nice quiet table with very comfortable chairs.  Mine was a bit broken needing some repair.  However, I was exhausted and had no desire to get up or say anything.  Spent some time sipping on an ice cold beefeater gin and tonic simply relaxing.

The Fish Soup as an entr√©e ($46) sounded like the perfect reward for a hard day.  2 of us chose the Fish Soup and one of us opted for the salmon.  Note:  Our waiter Hilton was wonderful.

The soup was delicious.  Huge New Zealand mussels in a lovely tomato broth with lobster, massive shrimp and clams.  Crusty pieces of garlic bread complemented this lovely concoction.  There was some kind of rise or quinoa in the soup.  It was a wonderful dish - bottom line.

For desert we split the ice cream trio.  There were three flavors yet only the cinnamon truly stood out.

Bottom line - great meal.  Will I eat here again?  Absolutely.  Nice to find good food in a strip hotel (finally).",u92jV0zgxyYBIcJdDbL7aA,1,0,4,iscWk2AB-FfzuZ34d0nDHA

We had a very hard time with their wine list... For the quality of food and being an upscale restaurant their wine list was mediocre...  We started off with ZD Reserve, which was an okay wine... But I can get that from BevMo for $45.00... Our second bottle was 2002 Far Niente which was better then ZD but still weren't very impressed.  
Another thing, the lobster was bit tough... We had hard time cutting the meat so one of the wait staff ended up cutting out the meat for us...  
Last thing, which is no big deal, but they ran out of Beluga caviar so they had to run to next door to get lower grade caviar...  :(  
If they had a better wine list, and we didn't have any issue with the lobster I would have given them 5 stars...   Also, it is bit pricey...  Our bill came out to $1,550.00 for party of 5...

  - Asked for more breadsticks and never got them

3334756,2015-02-10,0,25wTaO0_Rk-GLb4k2uMs0Q,"Another fabulous meal!
Aquaknox continues to provide a unique dinning experience. the menu is updated frequently enough so that each time we come into town there is a new treat to enjoy. We love the ""out of the box"" imagination of the new head chef, Deric Meininger. One of the taste sensations he created was an octopus carpaccio. Never has an octopus dreamed of being so tender! The creation process itself; cooking  the octopus and then allowing it to form as it cooled into the round that made the thin slices possible, genius. Chef loves fresh herbs, and used along with crisp  black olive bits, shallot, and a vinegarette that compliments rather than overwhelmed. Truly like nothing I have ever had and tender beyond belief.

Min Lee, our most gracious host, sat us in our favorite booth and as always the wait staff served impeccably.  BTW the booths are very romantic, just enough privacy to steal a kiss, but not so much that you feel cut off.

Husband loves the Aquaknox crab cakes so much that he ordered two as a main dish. We've had crab cakes in New England that paled when stacked next to these. Topped with lump crab, a creole remoulade and accompanied by a chayote carrot and daikon. 

I had welsh sea bass, perfectly deboned and served over fresh arugula tossed with squash and zucchini and peewee potatoes. Again chef Deric's love of fresh herbs gives this dish the right finish. Even the fish skin was an edible delight, and I normally  don't like that part.

The only restaurant that even comes close to Aquaknox in my heart is Osterica Gardenia in Venice Italy!  Suffice it to Say that I have never had a disappointing dish at Aquaknox. I cannot say the same for some of the overrated and underwhelming Rao....skip the at Caesars and head to Aquaknox instead. 

We paired our meal with a lovely Delaporate Sancerre, perfect compliment. Oh, and dessert! Try the banana cream pie. Nothing like this reinvention of a classic. From the caramelized sugar atop the fresh banana slices to the delicate lady fingers base, the banana cream and served alongside a scoop of chocolate grand mariner and chocolate sauce. The sommelier brought us a desert wine to try, and I wish I had writen down the name as it was very good and not cloyingly over sweet. 

We finished with a Warm Amaretto Cherry Milk served with brown sugar white chocolate swirl cookie.

First of all, the lobster bisque is fantastic and was the highlight of the meal.  It had a light amount of cream, wonderful lobster chunks and a dabble of caviar on top.  Probably some of the best bisque I have had in my life.  One member our party had the fish soup and raved about how fantastic it was.  I had the John Dory and it was really good.  It came prepared with a corn and fava bean relish which was light and tasty.  We were told that Aquaknox is known for its John Dory so we expected to be blown away.  It was really good, but not something to be ""known for.""  What really took this restaurant from four to three stars was that a couple in our group ordered the $68 surf and turf special.  It came out luke warm.  Our waiter took it straight back and cooked them new entrees and the manager apologized, so I have to compliment the service.  However, a $68 meal should never come out cold.

The decor is uber trendy and fun.  The wine list is extensive and the atmosphere has a great vibe.  Our service was spot on and our waiter answered all questions without hestitation...and with this group, there are always a lot of questions.

My wife and I both had a filet and stuffed lobster tail.  The lobster was perfectly cooked and very good.  Many places overcook lobster a little and it gets a tad dry, but this was cooked extremely well.  It was stuffed with crab, which was done well.

The filet was disappointing.  On the one hand, it was perfectly cooked and one of the most tender steaks I have had in a long time.  On the other hand, the flavor was very unfortunate.  It tasted like a pot roast, but not in a good way, and a bit more bland than a good pot roast.  Steak isn't supposed to taste like pot roast.  My wife added a bunch of salt and claimed it tasted better but still a lot to be desired.  It's a shame, because the steak had a lot of potential.  I'm not sure what kind of rub or whatever they put on it, but it was not an enjoyable flavor for a nice steak.  There was some kind of sauce that was pretty good, but not good enough to cover up the flavor of the steak.

We finished the meal with the apple strudel, with chai tea ice cream.  The dessert was first rate.  The ice cream was very memorable.  It made me forget about the steak.

The service was outstanding.  

Overall, if the steak had been up to par for an expensive steak and seafood restaurant, I would have given AquaKnox five stars and it would be on our short list of favorite restaurants on the strip, because everything else was at a five star level.  But for the price, the steak needed to be good.  It was not close.  It's a shame.

The food was just mediocre though. I had the romaine heart salad (blue cheese caesar) and crab cakes. I am picky about crab cakes and have very high expectations. I did appreciate the lack of filler but there just wasn't enough jumbo crab meat in them. Plus they had a weird buttery taste which I did not enjoy. The salad was a nice size and was good enough, but not great. It had a little too much dressing on it for my liking, so I would recommend getting it on the side. We also had two bottles of Chardonnay, but the name of the exact bottles we had escapes me. The wine list is extensive and has a variety of price points which was helpful especially in a group.

The greeting staff was very polite and nice, brought us to our table and quickly got a high chair for our 1 year old.  We were initially skeptical about it because it's a ""quiet"" restaurant, but they were actually very welcoming and accommodated us just fine.

Our server Jesse came, and he's easily one of the best servers we have seen.  He's very nice, humorous, and most importantly clear in explaining the menu.  Another thing we love about him was that he always checked on us at the right time, not so often that it became annoying, but at the same time whenever we needed something, he was right there.

We ordered the smoked fish trio appetizer, it was very light and fresh.  It was a very fun dish and we enjoyed it a lot.  We also ordered a lobster bisque, and Jesse was great in splitting the soup for us.  We often find lobster bisque from other restaurants on the salty / strong side, but to our surprise Aquaknox got it perfect.  A lot of lobster flavor, silky smooth, and very very creamy.  We loved it.

Also worth it to mention about the bread sticks wit that smoky salmon butter.  It's so good and specially, very different from the breads that we have tasted in other restaurants.

My wife ordered the red snapper, it was very moist and light.  With all the vege on top, mashed potato at the bottom, and also the lightly citrus sauce, it was a great combination.

I ordered the crab meat stuffed lobster, and it's simply awesome.  The portion was no joke at all, the claws were bigger than my hand!!!!!!!  I have had a lot of lobster in my life, but these were done spot on.  It's very tender, but you still get the lobster texture.  My wife is not a big lobster lover but she was truly amazed at the few bites she tried.  It's very moist with that citrus and smoky flavor.  The stuffing was also heavenly.  Basically the whole dish was nothing short of WOW.

We also ordered a side dish of sauteed spinach, it's very fresh and also done very well.

We intentionally booked at Caesar's so that we could eat at Mesa Grill, where I have had the best meals of my life. I called to make the reservation, and...Boom!...private party...not open.

Dagnabbit!

What to do? My wife loves seafood, so I Yelped seafood restaurants, and found great reviews for AquaKnox at the Venetian. Took a chance, and man, was it worth it! Simply the best service I have ever received at a Vegas upscale restaurant.

Our server (and assistant) constantly brought over little extras. For example, my wife had mentioned how good the corn and edamame succotash looked, but it didn't some with her entree.  Right after her main arrived, she was brought a dish of the succotash on the house. And it was incredible!

Here's the food breakdown:

We started with the Ahi tuna tartare. One of the best I've had. The Korean chili added the perfect amount of heat and the tiny pieces of crispy tempura and Asian pear brought great texture and a little crunch.

We followed with the lobster bisque. Um...drool...I mean...can't speak...still in catatonic stupor. 'Nuff said. We also had the butter lettuce and herb salad with champaign vinaigrette. Very fresh and balanced.

Mains: I had the scallops on corn puree and soft polenta. Seared perfectly, but the star of the plate was the mixture of the puree and polenta. And just for a neat little surprise, there were three pork cracklins in the center. Cleaned the plate and would have eaten more. My wife had the whole grilled sea bass. She loved it. It had a nice mesquite flavor and was perfectly cooked.

We ended with the banana cream pie with Guinness chocolate ice cream. The pie was unique and yummy. Not a traditional BCP. They layer ladyfingers throughout. What I liked most about it was that it wasn't overly sweet like a lot of BCP. The star of the dish, though, was the ice cream. When you paired a bite of pie with the ice cream, it was unreal. I could have eaten a whole pint.

As a nice closer, they brought over a delicious, cold digestif, with a small brownie.

Service - considerate & attentive, but not smothering. There were a few people attending to the table and I didn't have any issues. We had everything we needed and there was constant follow-up throughout the meal.

Food -  a seafood lover's heaven! They even have caviar. Stand out entrees were the fish soup with large portions of shellfish and a spicy broth; and the cashew crusted tuna. I am used to the standard pepper ahi tuna, so this dish was a unique, crunchier version of one of my fav fishes. 
* Save room because the desserts are just as memorable. The bread pudding is a popular one, but for something lighter I would recommend the orange champagne semi-freddo. Delish!

3717929,2013-01-01,1,25wTaO0_Rk-GLb4k2uMs0Q,"Food was excellent. Service was spot on. Nice atmosphere.

But two things that made for a bad taste in our mouths and tainted what should have been an excellent experience. My wife didn't want an appetizer, when we ordered there was some joking about me sharing my crab cake with her, waiter said he would bring an extra plate for her. Appetizer came out on two plates, two small crab cakes. Not sure if that is what I would have gotten  if I just said no to sharing. Anyway, bill came, charged an extra $4 for the privilege of sharing with my wife. What a rip-off. $22 for two bite sized crab cakes.

For dinner , I got the lobster with crab, when I was ordering I asked waiter if I got to choose the size or it just came as they had it. Was told I didn't get to choose the size, but it would be about 2 lbs. Lobster was maybe 1 1/4 tops. I get them from the market at home all the time, no way in hell that lobster was 2 lbs. $81 to boot, another rip-off.

Penny wise pound foolish strategy by this restaurant, meal was around $250, ripping us off for $4 and lying about the size of the lobster is not a good way to get people to come back and generates negative press for your restaurant. It taints the hotel also, would think twice about staying at the Venetian again now as I don't like being ripped off.

We were greeted by very friendly hostesses which was a good sign. They were all very kind and although we were quite casually dressed, they invited us in anyway. Bonus points for them. 

The restaurant is quite classy with white linens, a very modern feel, darker lighting and a really cool wine cooler that's a focal point in the front of the restaurant.

We were shown to our table and we were greeted by our waiters. They worked in tandem, which was quite cool as we were never thirsty or left wanting for anything. They brought out a wonderful amuse bouche that was spread over bread sticks. Very nice beginning and more than a bite so that was nice.

We decided to go all out and really enjoy this meal, so we each got appetizers. I got the crab cakes ($18) that were marinated with vegetable relish, citrus aioli, and petite mache.  They are smaller, but there was not any filling as it was all crab. Very nice change from those giant crab cakes that are 50% filler. Worth every bite. 

My girlfriend got the Lobster Bisque ($15). It contained Maine lobster, caviar, and creme fraiche. Wow. It was flavorful, with the creme cutting the richness a bit, but not too much. I never had bisque with caviar and it did add a nice little touch. 

Next up, the main dishes which we sort of shared. The Georges Bank Scallops ($34) included black truffle creamed corn, with apple-wood smoked bacon polenta. The scallops were perfectly seared and cooked properly. I haven't had one like this in ages, and it really brought back memories from eating them as a kid. The polenta was pretty tasty as well, but I liked it more than she did. 

The Wild Barramundi ($35) included a tasty chive potato puree, baby tomatoes, and was topped with an asparagus-wild mushroom vinaigrette. I liked it a lot. I didn't know what to expect from the texture, which is a more on the oily side. It worked for me. It was quite moist and flavorful. The potato puree was amazing and went so well with the fish. 

We had no room left after the meal so we skipped dessert. All in all, I would really recommend this restaurant for the friendly service, kind hostesses, great atmosphere and of course the food. If you're in town, definitely consider this place for a great seafood meal.",9kIcMeveJXxWGVOVdXyQyg,2,3,5,BpSR_aGLlSChqGrsz7zY9g
3791536,2018-01-25,0,25wTaO0_Rk-GLb4k2uMs0Q,"We came here for our anniversary and I know we hit the restaurant at the beginning of a dual-convention week and I know how hard that can be, but geez... This was not the experience we expected.

For starters, one of our servers, while pleasant, was very obviously sick. She had almost no voice and was sucking on a mentholated cough drop every time she attempted to talk to our table. She was as pleasant as she could be but it was obvious she was really ill. Not really what you want around your food when people are literally dying of the flu. Management: I know you're slammed but LET YOUR SERVERS GO HOME SICK WHEN THEY'RE SICK. Seriously. The other server on the team was fine but pretty aloof.

I further complicated things by coming in with a trio of allergies: milk, egg, and soy. My husband called ahead to make sure they could accommodate us because we didn't want to make a stink and the servers were kind enough to make note of this (it was clearly marked in our reservation, which is great) at the beginning of the evening.

I ordered a martini. It took awhile and arrived in a broken glass. I asked for a replacement. We had tap water; my glass sat empty most of the night because there was no one around to refill it.

Onto the food... I was a little disappointed that the servers acknowledged the allergies but didn't offer any suggestions as to which menu items were ""safe"" and which weren't or what, if any, adjustments could be made. I don't like to be that person who asks a hundred questions and the servers made it clear they were in a hurry so I just picked a few things and asked specifically about those.

We started with the seafood sampler tower. Everything was delicious. The oysters were beautifully fresh and expertly cleaned, the shrimp were large and juicy, the the cocktail sauce well-made, etc. Next came a butter lettuce salad with champagne vinaigrette - the dressing was fantastic. A simple salad and totally overpriced (hey, it's the strip!) but executed well. 

For our entree, we shared a strip steak that came with mashed potatoes, charred shishito peppers and green onions, and a madeira sauce. We asked if we could switch out the mashed potatoes for their Kennebec french fries due to the dairy allergy and were told that was fine. There was more than a half an hour between the salad and steak courses. WAY too long. When the steak finally arrived, they had split it for us (nice) and given all of the sides to my husband and just the half steak, a pepper, and onion to me. We asked about the fries and the server said we never ordered them. I mean, we had an entire conversation... but okay.

The steak was good but not great. It was cooked unevenly and clearly sat on the cooker too long on one side and not enough on the other so it was part almost rare and part medium well. That's no way to treat a $57 steak. Flavor was good though which is a major plus since I didn't have any sauce. The shishito and green onion were smoky and full of yum.

My absolute favorite part of the meal was the surprise dessert they brought out for our anniversary. It was presented with great flourish to my husband, with the server saying ""The chef sent you a surprise! You get a miniature milkshake and a petite donut"" then he turned to me and said ""And I got you a strawberry."" Epic. Thanks for the strawberry!

Look, I know allergies aren't easy to deal with and I don't expect the kitchen to pull something custom out just because I waltzed in but there was zero attempt to be helpful - that's fine in Denny's, I guess, but you expect more from a place with AquaKnox's reputation and price point. Beyond that, the service just wasn't up to par. There are a lot of places to eat in Vegas and although I had a great night with my husband, because he's awesome, we won't be back to AquaKnox. The sad part is, I don't think they care.",cB1pgndvG47P8XkeDa-7PQ,0,0,2,ezT2os5QQ7qsbw3ajRq90g

First impression:  very soothing colors in shades of blue, green and cream.  They have a really cool little private dining room with seating for about 4 or 5 inside a round glass wine display.  Imagine dining with bottles and bottles of wine surrounding you.  ;)  They have a few pretty water displays too.  

The restaurant was not very busy, but to be honest, Vegas itself seemed pretty empty this trip.  The economy perhaps?  Anyway, our waiter and busboy were both very pleasant and helpful.  We had three coupons for complimentary Aquatinis...don't mind if we do!  It was a very pretty drink, but a little too sweet for my taste.  

I split the beet salad with my sister.  It was served with a rather sweet dressing.  Thank goodness for the blue cheese crumbles which did a great job balancing out the sweetness.  I found several entrees on the menu that sounded really good, but I chose the grouper.  It was rice crusted and served over green tea-infused soba noodles.  As separates, everything was very tasty, but together it was a rather odd combo of flavors.  If I went back I would probably order the scallops like my dad or the John Dory like my mom and sister.

3972995,2014-12-21,8,25wTaO0_Rk-GLb4k2uMs0Q,"Four of us were invited by the GM of AquaKnox to dine there last night.  The idea was the chef would send out dishes to highlight the things they're doing at AquaKnox with the new executive chef.  We gathered at 5:30 and then spent over three hours enjoying good company, good conversation, and great food!  

For starters, we got an amuse-bouche of scallop ceviche.  Very nice start with some chopped scallop on a tortilla chip.

Next out was a trio of oysters.  One was an oyster shooter in a great liquid with a kick from hot sauce.  The server recommended we drink it all at once or we'd end up getting too much hot sauce at once.  We all listened.  The spiciness lingered for awhile.  Another oyster was their Oyster Rockefeller with crumb top.  It was very tasty.  Finally, there was an oyster from the Northwest with some house made salsa fresca.  Very nice.

Next up was foie gras with a carrot confit on a Nutella infused toast round.  The ingredients went together so well.  This is not on their current menu.  Foie gras is available as a topping for steak.  They're thinking of adding it to the menu.

Then came the AquaKnox fish soup.  The menu describes it as having Mediterranean tomato-saffron broth, Maine lobster, John Dory, mussels, clams, prawns, Sardinian couscous.  There was Ono in the soup last night and the tomato-saffron broth was superb!  The soup had  a rich spiciness to it and was accompanied by two toast points.

The next course was pan roasted Ono on an artichoke sauce with persimmon and some fingerling potato halves.  The fish was moist, rich, and was just incredibly good.

Up next was their take on surf and turf.  There were two sides to the dish--one with shrimp on couscous.  On the other side was a scallop on a bed of mushrooms over squash pur√©e.  Perfectly cooked with an excellent blend of flavors, this was another outstanding dish.

The next course was a sampling of three of their steaks.  The steaks are wet aged.  The slices were from their filet, ribeye, and NY strip.  The filet and strip were like butter they were so tender.  The ribeye was a bit tougher.  The trio was served with shishito peppers, cooked onions, and mashed potatoes.

Then came the dessert course.  We were presented with a dish with three dessert samples--Banana cream pie served with a caramelized banana slice, banana cream, and Guinness ice cream.  Another was their take on the classic s'mores.  It had browned marshmallow on chocolate with a graham crust.  Finally, the butterscotch bread pudding with brioche soaked in homemade butterscotch caramel.  Absolutely delicious.  As we were starting these, we were brought a serving of key lime pie with two cherries in glass looking candy.  The presentation was stunning.

Not quite done yet, we were brought cinnamon cayenne cookies and shooter style glasses of hot chocolate.  The cinnamon flavor was similar to candy cinnamon which gave a zing to the cookies.  To end, two of us had double espressos over ice and two had hot green tea.

Service was exemplary.  For each course, four servers came together and rounded the table and then placed the dishes in unison.  Excluding me, the group did small wine pairings with each course.  The sommelier expertly explained his selections and described the wines.  My dining partners enjoyed their pairings and I enjoyed my iced tea which was replaced with a fresh one without the need to ask.

A perfectly wonderful meal and I'm pleased to maintain the 5 star level I gave AquaKnox when I first reviewed them during Restaurant Week earlier this year.  A very memorable and filling meal.  Hence my 15 mile bike ride this morning.  Thanks to all those at AquaKnox for making this a perfect evening!",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,13,11,5,mOuOpsFpA0cauw7SrA7M-Q

I had the shrimp. Husband had the crab stuffed lobster tail. The portions are good. At the very least, you won't leave hungry. I felt like if I had read that there was going to be cheese in the couscous, I would never have ordered it. I don't know whose bright idea it is/was to put cheese with seafood, but it is by far one of the most disgusting combinations in my book. Having said that, I didn't eat the couscous. Understand that all that's left is the shrimp. Which were HUGE, but also not mind blowing as far as texture and taste. Maybe it would taste better with cheese? Maybe not. 

I had a taste of the crab stuffed lobster tail and well. It's lobster. It's good. The crab stuffing though...salty with...too much. Like. Why waste crab if you can't taste it? Also, beware ""market price"". Just saying. It was 100% not worth it. Even if it was lobster.

The meal was wrapped up with a complimentary...dessert? Pallette cleanser? It was strawberry milk with a white chocolate and cranberry cookie. Didn't quite take the taste of the exorbitant price out of my mouth though.

Dropped by for dinner when the hostesses mentioned a Halibut special: fresh halibut on top of lobster mash. The menu is not extensive, so it may not cater to some (or many) taste buds, but I'll be damned if that wasn't the most well-prepared halibut I've ever had. The dishes look simple, but I truly appreciate every bite, a subtle flavor that lingers on your palate the rest of the night. The complimentary white chocolates are icing on the cake.

4142784,2015-10-13,14,25wTaO0_Rk-GLb4k2uMs0Q,"Best. Seafood. Restaurant. EVER!

I really enjoyed my dining experience at AquaKnox.  I have actually wanted to try AquaKnox for years, but it took me 10 years to get over here.  What is wrong with me?! I've been missing out on this fabulous place for an entire decade.  Well, I finally remedied that problem and I am so glad I did.  My last dinner at AquaKnox ranks in my Top 10 dinners of my life!  

List of reasons to dine at AquaKnox:

1. Oh my goodness, this food is outstandingly brilliant.  We had a 7 course chef's tasting and my mind was blown after each dish.  I am not really an adventurous seafood eater, but I was at AquaKnox, so I went for it!  Every dish was so gorgeous that I had to try it immediately.  I tried so many new proteins, some of which I have never liked before, and loved every single bite!  

Every single dish was marvelous, but there were a few standouts.  My absolute favorite course was the duo plate of the Alaskan King Crab Cake and Lobster Bisque.  The Alaskan King Crab Cake was the best crab cake I have ever eaten.  I'm not even sure how the cakes hold together because it is mostly giant hunks of crab!  It is also served with a tasty apple slaw.  It was then paired with a delightful cup of Lobster Bisque that is served with a crostini topped with creme fraiche and caviar. Delish!  This soup had so many layers of flavor and was just enchanting to my senses.  This is definitely a most order dish!

My favorite entree was the Sablefish ""Butterfish."" This was my first time having this fish and it blew my mind.  It was served with a miso glaze on top of a corn puree with breaded eggplant on the side.  I found this to be so complex and interesting.  The fish itself was fantastic with the miso glaze.  The eggplant and corn added extra levels of flavor that were surprising, but really worked well together.

The most adventurous course was the Warm Octopus Carpaccio.  I'm not usually an octopus fan, but I really enjoyed it this time.  The citrus vinaigrette really complimented and bought out some great flavors.  Go figure, I do like octopus!

Of course no meal at a seafood resturant is complete without the classic Surf & Turf dish.  AquaKnox knocked this out of the park.  We had the Filet with a Brazilian Lobster Tail.  It is a classic, but was as fantastic! 

2. The customer service is top notch!  From the moment to get to the restaurant, you are pampered.  The service here is just amazing.  The servers are so friendly and helpful. They help you along the way to make sure you get exactly what you need and want.  They check on you regularly and you never have to ask for anything because they are a step ahead the entire meal.  I was lucky enough to have the service team of Jesse and Tonya.  If you are going to AquaKnox, I highly recommend you request their section.  You will not regret it!

3. The sommelier, Louis, and the wine! During our menu tasting, we also opted for the sommelier's choice wine pairing.  I know absolutely nothing about wine except that it is made out of grapes.  I am zero help with picking wine, so I was ecstatic to have such a brilliant sommelier to help us with some wonderful wines for each course.  I also really liked how Louis gave us so much information about the types of grapes used, as well as the region where the wine is produced.  Educational and delicious, how fun!  I wish I could remember them all so I could go buy some for myself.  

4. The desserts! We had 2 desserts.  We had a flourless chocolate cake, which was good. The coup de gr√¢ce was the butterscotch bread pudding.  Wow, wow, wow this dessert was spectacular! It was a thing of beauty, flavor explosion, and just all around yummy.  Just order it and bathe in it's beauty!

5. The restaurant is beautiful! The seats are comfortable, the color scheme is visually appealing, and it is just a pleasant place to be in.  It is really just a lovely place to go for a nice dinner.

It doesn't matter if you are a local or a tourist, you need to go experience this magnificent restaurant.  I promise you will love every moment as much as I did.  Bon appetit!",8DBH3BpLINfTAK_Up5BtUQ,22,18,5,YPq_8uer1xsrE4XtF62WJA

I've decided to stop being a silent lurker and start contributing to Yelp! :)

I'm going to start with Aquaknox, a little gem that I've been going to since its opening week.  I remember during its first few years there was never a need to make a reservation.  It pleases me to see that how its steadily grown.

A quick note about the decor - it's date-worthy in a more less-romantic more-chic type of way.  I like when the lights changes color and getting a table with a good view of the wine cellar is always a plus.

So, don't let the entire seafood look and feel fool you.  What's really good here is the ribeye.  Several years ago one waiter proudly boasted to us that they have ""the best Ribeye in Vegas"".  Now, I think Vegas has many fairly good steak houses.  SW, Prime, Fix, Boa, and now Cut comes to mind, but this guy was not exaggerating.  It is really really good even when you compare it to upper echelon steakhouses' ribeye.  From some of the reviews I read - it makes me shiver thinking they may not have that ribeye anymore.  I don't know - I was at Vegas two weekends ago and also a month and a half ago, but I didn't have the opportunity to stop by.  I'll be there for Christmas and maybe once in between - I'll definitely check it out once during those two visits.

Assuming it's still there - if you're looking to get a great ribeye that somewhere else would easily charge you much more for the same quality - this is a great place.  You can also get the ribeye with the surf and turf special, which lets you pick between either a crab-stuffed lobster tail or just a regular 'ol lobster tail.  Both are good, I prefer the non-stuffed lobster tail.  Nothing spectacular as far as lobster goes, but completes the meal just fine.  Beware though, from my experience getting the surf and turf ""special"" is identical as ordering both the lobster tail and the ribeye together.  As in, the price is just the two dishes put together.  Maybe save a buck.

Another awesome dish here is the scallops.  I don't remember if it's an entree or an appetizer, but if it's an entree, we order it and request it to be served like an appetizer.  It's large, tender, flavorful, and depending on the seasonal preparation it will have a nice matching secondary taste.

Crab cakes were pretty decent too.  Nothing too ""wow wow wow"" but serves as a good alternative appetizer when in a large party.

Overall, I've never had a bad experience dining at Aquaknox and I'm pretty sure I've been there at least 15-20 times over the years.  It's certainly one of the two restaurants I've frequented the most often @ Las Vegas and will continue to attract me until they somehow mysteriously decline (ala Postrio).

Service was the worst I have ever had. Group of 8. In an empty restaurant (should have been a clue) treated like an annoyance once we declined the waiter's suggestion $200 bottle of wine. Waiter made subtle comments about us splitting salads, and how normally people order full salads with dinner which is why our dinner was so delayed.  Once our waiter realized that we weren't going to have a $1,000 bill, it was the last we saw of him.  Just a few visits from the assistant waiter to refill water.  

Upon leaving we were visited by our waiter one last time to get a small tray of sweets on the house since ""none of you bothered to order dessert"".  Very nice of him to say.

Well because of the obvious name we had to order seafood. The seafood appetizer was pretty good. Filled with 4 different clams, oyster shooters, ceviche, jumbo shrimp cocktails, crab claws, lobster....Um you could probably stop here b/c by the end of this I was pretty stuffed.

I only tried two of the dishes ordered: Surf 'n' Turf and Wild Halibut. The halibut was good but not out of this world. At this point I was really stuffed so stomach realestate was becoming scarce and more selective. The surf 'n' turf was too salty (crab stuffed lobster) the filet was good but not the best I'd ever had.

My dinner at Aquaknox was one of the most delicious meals I have ever eaten. We started with the House Smoked Fish Plate (absolutely sublime) and the Seafood Trio appetizers (sweet shrimp, lobster and jumbo crab cocktails all with their own special sauces - YUM!!). Frickin amazing. Both of them. 

We moved on to the beet salad with horseradish vinaigrette and then I ordered the mesquite grilled Wild King Salmon and she ordered the sauteed John Dory with Lobster Succotash and Sweet Corn Broth. The salmon and the john dory were both cooked perfectly - medium rare, the sauces wonderful. As often happens, I liked her dish even better than mine! 

We ordered two desserts and only liked one of them, but that's because my friend doesn't like mousse and i don't like that kind of rich semisweet chocolate enough to have really  enjoyed the dessert. But the peach crumble dessert was awesome! 

The only reason why I am giving them 4 stars and not 5 is because the waiter seemed to have a great deal of trouble getting us a dry white wine to go with our meal. We tried one tasting at his suggestion and it was way too fruity and so we opted for another one he suggested, a Sauvignon Blanc from New Zealand, which (1) took too long to get to our table (there was some problem, and we had already gone through 1/2 our appetizers by the time it showed up at our table) and (2) was NOT DRY! it wasn't overly sweet but it certainly was not dry as we had asked. 

But by the 2nd glass it didn't matter and the frickin food was sooo goshdarn delicious that I still walked away happy as, well, a clam.",oSYYb0euspKfkcV0-xBKaA,2,3,4,nzHn2Lwb-BYhpAgPSnZtMQ

We enjoyed ourselves so much, we decided to come back to AquaKnox after the show. We enjoyed more unique cocktails paired with some great dishes to eat.

She choosen this restaurant because was highly recommended by her boss. We have been dining in so many fine dining restaurants in Las Vegas. We had to say this was the worse experience ever. Our reservation was at 8 15 pm. We received a call to confirm our reservation and she had mentioned that we'll be celebrating my b-
day and look forward to have us. So we showed up and got sat at the worse 
table in front of wine vault. The staff kept going in and out. The door was hitting my wife chair few times. Finally the front server Chris came to our table had mentioned that the servers who I had requested upon my reservation Tanya, Jesse or Mark were not available. So we had ordered some wine and bottled water then we ordered our meal. Finally we got our appetizer octopus with spicy sauce and lobster bisque. Food was dropped at the table with no explanations of the dish. I guess we have high expectation cause most fine dining restaurants that's what they do. The severs never checked back to see how was the appetizers till we were done. The water glasses were empty. Front server had no clue that we were drinking bottled water. Couldn't find our water so had to open another one. I get it if the restaurant was busy but it's not. There was no bread at the table. We didn't know that we have to ask for it. Finally we got our main course which is pretty good. Again servers never explain the dishes nor checked back till the end of the meal. We have heard the chocolate souffle was awesome so we told our server that we wanted one of those do we need to order ahead of time. He said no because it was not the traditional one. Then I said OK we'll try it. This conversation was take place when we ordered our meal. Well after we finished our main course getting ready to order desert, I had told our server that you guys were out of chocolate souffle because I heard one of your staff had told one of the server who were right behind me 15 minutes ago. Our server had no clue, he went in the kitchen to find out and it was true that they were out. So we ordered creme brulee. Took them quite sometime to bring it out. I don't know that your restaurant doesn't do b-day for your guests but at least say happy birthday. Nothing not a word. On top of that our server put our leftover in paper bag and didn't close the top really good so on the way back to our car the bag was soaking wet from the sauce and dripping all over myself. Normally we don't complaint if there is few little things but this was BAD from the beginning till the end. Especially if your staff kept saying welcome back cause we had asked for specific servers, they should be on top of the game.

The butternut squash and brussels sprouts perfectly paired with the scallops. My husband had the salmon with forbidden rice. His dish was also the perfect combination of flavors and possibly even better than my dish. For dessert I had the butterscotch bread pudding.

The seasonings on all of the dishes were either incredibly bland, reminiscent of bad diner food, or clashingly distasteful.

Well, that's what delirium does to you...your judgment gets all clouded.  This was my first meal during my long weekend in Vegas, and I was absolutely starving after a day of sun-worshipping.  We got to the restaurant around 10-ish Thursday night, and the place was pretty empty.  Yet, they still made us wait like 25 minutes at the bar.  Finally, once we were ravenous AND tipsy, they decided to seat us at one of the booths.  Very pretty decor, btw.  Aquaknox, you may have deceived my tipsy self into thinking I had a great meal here with your fancy decor and super-nice and attentive staff during that night (come to think of it, is there a restaurant in Vegas that DOESN""T have super-nice and attentive staff?)  However, I have been schooled in the ways of Vegas dining since, and I am no longer impressed.  
For my entree, I ordered the Seared Main Scallops with mushrooms, spaghetti squash, and some Asian-looking green vegetable in a cream sauce.  After finishing off the scallops and mushrooms, I poked at the rest of my entree.  Now, I like veggies, but the way they prepared it was a bit...underwhelming.  I also tried the Seared Ahi Tuna, which was cooked perfectly.  However, I nearly choked on the excess pepper that was on that tuna.  Dessert was phyllo with walnut ice cream in a caramel sauce.  Pretty presentation, but taste was nothing special.  You're basically paying for the ambience and service here (minus the long wait).  One last thing...do NOT try the Ginger Beer....blech.

Overall impression:  overpriced, mediocre drinks, and overly seasoned food (what are they trying to hide?)

Be warned of the prices, though.  The night we went the 2 lb. stuffed lobster was $96.00!  

I started with a clever appetizer of three seafood cocktails - crab, shrimp ceviche, and lobster.  Surprisingly filling and delicious, although I cared less for the crab.  One friend had to leave early to catch a show.  He had the lobster for his entr√©e and, though not worth $96.00, it was a beauty.  We were not as hungry as we thought so we split an order of foie gras, which was nothing short of orgasmic.  Perfectly seared and simply served with some frisee, I wanted more. So good that I pity the poor bastard who has never savored the unique culinary delight that a goose so generously gave its life for.

We also split a lobster tail, which was superb, served with drawn butter, grilled lemon, and two tasty spears of asparagus for each of us.  These small plates were perfect.

Our amazing servers, Jesse and Tonya, made the whole experience just that - an experience.  Turns out these cute kids are married, and they made us feel like we had been coming there for years.

They do have a Coconut Tofu curry dish for the vegetarian, which looked intriguing enough to almost order, but we opted for Oysters, John Dory, Crab-Stuffed Lobster, and a Filet.

The oysters are by the 1/2 dozen, and we received 2 different Pairs of New York varietals along with a pair from Prince Edwards. Very fresh, and a good mix of salinity and sweetness. 

The serving team progressed the meal with an Amuse Bouche of Albacore poke.

John Dory was served with a Corn Succotash, and was pan fried with a hint of heat. The Lobster was well cooked, stuffed with blue crab and stuffing mix. The claw was de-shelled and placed on the open body. The filet was about seven ounces and cooked to rare. Typical red wine reduction, but perfectly executed.

Prior to going, I was looking for a restaurant that would have a special private dining option available.  Valerie (private events from Aquaknox) contacted me right away and sold me on what Aquaknox had to offer.  I wanted to make this special for my bro-in-law who was being deployed.  Valerie was able to offer a special military discount of 15% off our total bill (awesome gesture) and recommended the wine tower to have our dinner.  She gave us multiple options for the tasting menu and I opted for the 5 course.  I read many reviews and was a little concern that it may be too little of food (4 dishes plus dessert), but boy was I wrong. Prior to our arrival date, Valerie kept in constant contact with me to go over the menu, menu design, and to just ensure that our dinner was going to be special.  This level of service continued on to the day of our event.
We arrived and was promptly escorted into the wine tower.  Since it was a Tuesday evening, the restaurant was not crowded, but I am still glad we decided on the Wine tower.  It made all feel special.  The tower itself is a tad chilly (but she had already warned me of that) but we were prepared.  There were people constantly serving us. Andrea was our captain for the evening, and was on top of everything and super friendly.  We started off we a toast (she recommended a sparkling wine over champagne to save us cost).  We had two non drinkers, so Min (assistant manager/mixologist) made them a really special drink (consisting of ginger beer and some other fruits).  They really really enjoyed it.  
The menu was printed on a card and got everyone excited.  We started off with oysters.  Great presentation and most importantly, great flavor.  Only small knock was that Andrea wasn't exactly sure which oysters were which (no big deal).  The first official course was a gazpacho.  This was the best that I have every had.  Very fresh and tasty.  The following 3 courses were duos of amazing stuff.  Crab cakes and Shrimp Salad.  The crab cakes were flavor full, but the shrimp salad was were it was at.  It consisted of 2 sweet shrimps, and a ton of lump crab meat.  This was topped off with micro greens.  Very very delicious.  Next was the fishes.  Barramundi/John Dory.  I was excited to try the John Dory.  But what made the dish was the lobster succotash below it.  Very nice dish.  The Barramundi was also very good with the mash potatoes.  We could have ended it there, but then came the surf and turf.  Filet was on point.  Perfectly cooked and nice flavor.  The prawns (2) were cooked on open flames and also had great flavor.  By now, we were totally stuffed and could barely consumed dessert (chocolate gelato/mousse combo).  Also throughout the evening, we kept asking Min to make us different cocktails.  He took pleasure in coming up with different things and explaining what he made.  I really appreciate all of his explanation and effort he put into it.  One of the girls asked about the ginger beer, he produced a new bottle and served us each a sample.  
All in all, service and food was spot on.  Aquaknox may not be the most famous restaurant in Vegas (or even in the Venetian), yet it should definitely not be overlooked.  I thought we got a great value (5 course turned into 9 courses) in the tasting menu.  Nothing was over the top but very tasty.  Flavors were not too complex for our simple palates.

 Jesse came out at the end, and brought us a wonderful dessert with banana milk and mousse bites. Lovely writing of happy anniversary in chocolate on the plate (special treatment )

I started the classic way with the Lobster Bisque Soup - it was superb. My colleague had the Greenlip Mussels  - when you have been to New Zealand you know them very well - they are bigger than the PEI mussels and the shells shimmer somehow green. As a main I had the Barramundi from down under. Just a great fish unfortunately you can't get it very often in the US. I closed my meal with a cheese plate.

They had reservations on open table, so I made on for 7:15pm. We called to see if they could push it back 15 minutes but we were told they had a few large parties and unfortunately could only do 7:15. When we got there on time, NO LARGE PARTIES TO BE SEEN!

Oh well, other than that, the service was great and food was impeccable. We even snuck in a small cake for our boss and they brought it out for us with a candle and cut it for us, free of charge. 

They have a small room in the blue circular tower you will see when you walk by. It's their wine cellar plus a private room for about 6-8 people. I would love to eat in there!

We ordered a few drinks and a few appetizers. 2 ahi tunas, steamed mussles and the crab cake. All of them-wow! The ahi was so fresh and actually very big for an appetizer. The crab cake wasn't mashed up crab, it was huge chunks of blue crab. The steamed mussels were in a delicious broth and also had a lot.

The chef even sent out a small tasting of crab and spinach on a cracker for us, also amazing! 

Everything looked so good that I had a hard time deciding what to get. The entire table wasn't sure! We ordered: scallops, seafood soup, seabass and ahi tuna dinner. Everyone said nothing but amazing things about their meal. I ordered the seabass and I wish the plate never ended. It came with a sweet corn on the bottom-wow. I think next time I will get the seafood soup, it was huge and you literally got to try it all. The broth was flavorful and light.

4893783,2008-01-01,0,25wTaO0_Rk-GLb4k2uMs0Q,"I choose Aquaknox for Christmas eve dinner with my parents and bf.  My sole criteria were: non-steak, seafood preferred, on the strip, reservation availability on opentable, and of course, positive yelp reviews.  

First off, the place did not look as impressive as I'd hoped.  My expectations were probably too high.  In the dining area, there wasn't any cool watery dcor, because that's only in the bar area.  We were seated somewhere in the middle of the room, and it felt very cramped, like all the tables were too close.  For one thing, the chairs were huge (although comfortable) taking up a lot of space, difficult to get in and out and move around.  Service wasn't as smooth as I expected, nor comfortable or inviting.  

For appetizers, I ordered lobster bisque for myself and crab cakes for the table.  I don't understand the hype about lobster bisque.  It was creamy, has the essence of lobster, little chunks of lobster, and so it hit all the right marks, but didn't amaze me.  Maybe three days of lobster had something to do with it as well.  The crab cakes were also perfectly done, but not above and beyond.  I think I'm also jaded with an overabundance of crab cakes in my diet.  For the main, I ordered the John Dory.  I loved the lobster succotash, although a little bit sweet.  Tasting around the table, there were scallops, jumbo prawns, and ahi tuna.  Everything was perfectly cooked, and each had very different, yet interesting sides.  The prawns were probably the largest I had ever seen.  The tuna was a turn off because of its overly strong tapenade topping.  

For dessert we had the crme brulee and sticky toffee pudding.  I scoffed at the brulee - I could make a better one at home.  It was too soft when served.  I enjoyed the toffee, since it was the first one I ever had.  The coffee came with chocolate almond biscotti, which I appreciated.

If you're watching Blue Man, it's a toss up between this and Delmonico's next door.

In the end, I just felt guilty for all the fresh fish having been flown in to Vegas.  This is the desert!  I'll stick to seafood in San Francisco.",vEoPutr3TvZDSDboQ0xWIA,4,1,3,LDDLQUAVFVjCIcAH-diulQ

My girlfriends and I started the evening with a cocktail from the bar: A Blue Martini (forgot the name). Delicious but sweet, so we switched to wine during dinner. The restaurant wasn't busy so it wasn't loud. I loved the interior. Very modern and warm. We picked a booth and it was perfect for three of us.....intimate and good for catching up on things. 

Anyway, Thank You fellow Yelpers for recommending the Maine Lobster Bisque! I loved it and savored every bite. The best lobster bisque I've ever eaten. A little rich but flavored perfectly, and topped with little clumps of lobster. Perfect! I also had the Sweet Shrimp and Lump Crab Salad and it was excellent as well. I'm not a big eater, so those two appetizer-sized dishes were a perfect dinner for me. 

Another must-have: Crab Stuffed Whole Maine Lobster! My friend ordered it and we helped her finish it. It's massive....The whole lobster comes out on a huge plate and you just stare at it! The lobster was so tasty that it didn't even need butter. 

Sorry no dessert recommendations. Too full!

Food:  4 stars
We started with a sampler of a dozen oysters on the half shell.  They were very fresh and very tasty.  We both had simple grilled fish (the special) over a nicely done risotto.  All in all, a solid meal as expected based on reputation and price point.

Wine:  5 stars
For the price point and the vibe of the resort we expected an extensive list, a well trained sommelier, and a tip toward Italian.  All was as expected and more so.  The sommelier, a young man named Scott, was well versed in his list and very personable.  We found a '01 Moccagatta Bric Balin Barbaresco, a very happy and unexpected joy!

Service:  2 stars
Maybe it was the lack of staff because of the season, but our waiter was simply not good enough for this price point.  Adequate is a failure in fine dining.

Ambiance:  4 stars

The BF and I decided to return on our last night in town and had an even better experience than our first visit - something I didn't think was possible. 

When you make reservations ask to sit in Chris Godfrey's section. He is a great server and made our time so much more enjoyable.  We had him the first time (two nights prior), and he remembered us. He wasn't overbearing, but made sure we were taken care of like VIPs. Even the manager recognized us! He arranged for us to get a special appetizer from Sous Chef James, who we later got to meet so we could personally compliment him. He earned it. 

This time around we dined on a crab cocktail, lobster bisque, delicious yellowtail sashimi, salmon for me, prawns for the BF, lobster mash potatoes (you can have them separate from the halibut dish!!!), pomegranate mojitos, and creme br√ªl√©e for dessert. Forget food baby - I had food twins!

For appetizer, we shared the clams. THEY WERE THE BEST PART OF DINNER. The clams were cooked just how I like them and the broth it comes in is ""to die for"". Don't forget to ask for extra bread for the broth, trust me you'll want it. I ordered the barramundi, and I must say that it was cooked to perfection. The potato puree was super smooth and tasted awesome with the light dressing on it. My boyfriend ordered some sort of shrimp dish, and he said that he liked it. Everything tasted fresh and flavorful.

We decided on not ordering dessert because we were too full, but they brought us a complimentary one anyway. They served us ""adult milk and cookies"". it came with a small fresh baked cookie and a shot glass filled with what I think was a mixture of milk, sugar, cinnamon, and rum. It was super yummy and was just the right sweetness.

All together I believe our bill was just over $90 for the two of us. 

I had a great experience at AquaKnox, but the reason I'm giving it 4 stars is because of the placement of the restaurant.

5094970,2015-01-01,16,25wTaO0_Rk-GLb4k2uMs0Q,"Simply put, one of the best new American seafood restaurants in Vegas today.

Keeping it real, skip the lounge that I have always recommended.  Menu changes no longer make it the place to grab a quick bite.  Opt for the comfortable, contemporary ambiance of the main dining room instead.  While the executive chef has changed, taking with him the best of the best, enough remains and new dishes added that still carry the cuisine.

In general, seafood is very fresh and always perfectly cooked.  Never any albumin on fillets.  No bouncing scallops or shrimp.

Top starters include an outstanding wild blue crab cake (very little filler, dusted in flour and fried crisp served with a chayote slaw and a gently spiced creole remoulade).  Very well balanced dish with great texture, sweetness paired with an acidic punch.  The Maine lobster louie also excellent with just cooked through, firm and sweet lobster with traditional veg (I'm not a bunny but this is good).  A kicked up, creamy 1,000 island dressing and heirloom tomatoes with greater acidity and lower sweetness truly compliment the lobster.

Mains are simple but perfectly executed.  A perfectly pan roasted, moist, Alaskan halibut pairs perfectly with the chili flavor of a piquillo pepper relish.  The fish soup outstanding.  A acidic tomato base, the hint of saffron and perfectly cooked chunks of lobster, firm john dory, tender PEIs, briny clams, and sweet prawns.   A porcini dusted, perfectly cooked moonfish served with a red wine reduction dashi sauce is incredible for it's complexity and depth of flavor.  Mushroom and fish?  It works with the earthiness adding an unexpected umame finish.  Finally, the Georges Bank Scallops with blood orange butter, amazing.  Perfectly seared and cooked just through.  Incredibly sweet.  The blood orange butter adding even more richness and acidity to brighten the dish further.  Yes there are sides but who cares.  The scallops are the focus.

Outstanding service.  Very friendly, efficient, and accommodating.  Some dishes were shared, portions divided and individually plated in the kitchen.  

Very good wine list heavily centered around whites that pair perfectly with their cuisine.  Vegas resort markup.

5141000,2009-08-23,3,25wTaO0_Rk-GLb4k2uMs0Q,"WARNING: Beware of the servers.

First, we ordered water. They served us bottled still water when we clearly did NOT order it. And I've always had servers ask still, sparkling, or tap. This server didn't even ask! And they kept refilling our cups without us asking and without letting us know how many bottles we've used so we ended up paying for many bottles of water. So I guess let them know if you want tap water instead of bottled water. I don't mind paying for bottled water if that's what I'm expecting to do but we didn't even know until the bill came.

For appetizers we ordered the Seafood Plateau but it was $79 and serves only TWO people. Granted it does come with a variety of items but our server suggested this appetizer for our group of 8 but failed to mention the price. So $79 times 4 plus our main entrees equals a hefty tip for him. That Bastard. 

But the food alone was delicious and fresh so if the service was better, then I would have given it 4 stars easily. But since they tried to sell us every expensive thing on the menu it deserves only one star. I will never return. I've never experienced this before at any other upscale establishment so I guess that's why I felt so cheated.

But if you do want to eat here then get the ponzu and sake oyster shooters. We had multiple shots.",mNxjE1iEFc_AKRcAmiLyoQ,4,2,1,M_PNB75hgmMM5t2OXueorA

We grabbed a drink at the bar prior to sitting down for our meal and a Makers Mark on the rocks was $12 (without tip).  That's the only price I'll mention, but figured it was a good indicator for anyone reading this review.

The meal was exquisite ... I'm from North Carolina, and frequent the beaches of NC/SC, so I know good seafood.  Being in Las Vegas, I was hesitant to visit an upscale seafood restaurant, but AquaKnox did not dissapoint.  I started off with a Lobster Bisque and had to do everything to not to pick it up and start licking the bowl.  As for my entree, I had the tuna (rare of course), and it was extremely good.  Because we were jet lagged and technically eating our dinner at 11pm, we were too tired to do dessert, so we called it a night.  

Quick and Dirty Review:

Atmosphere - Unique, but nothing too special (located within the corridor between Palazzo and Venetian hotels).
Food - Delicious ... pricey, but delicious
Service - Good service ... attentive and knowledgeable with the menu based on our appetite.

The plus (singular) was the lobster cocktail, notwithstanding the shell chips and pervasive claw meat.  

The negatives were after the trade show at 5pm in an empty bar my $7 Heineken took 10 minutes and the cocktail waitress had zero (0) clue what was going on and said ""sorry I'm busy"", and the place was empty.  For dinner our group of 18 had a head waiter who was cocky and arrogant.  I think he showed only a modicum of respect to who he thought was paying the bill.  The entree portions were really small.  From what I recall the scallop entree my co-worker had was three scallops and he ate them and sarcastically grinned at me.  My $36 fish had to be just 5 ounces, seriously, and due to the size of the group it was not warm on the surface just inside.  I really, REALLY like the Ca√±onita in Venetian and 5-starred after multiple visits, but Aqua-Knox has portion sizes weirder than it's name and our arrogant waiter must be a millionaire doing his job for fun.",fpNH1CqgDxavVh6Q73eA0A,2,1,2,XXHS3zAi1mOxfWtfBpeQ1w

My family and I are loyal seafood lovers so we couldn't resist reserving after seeing the reviews, and of course, we like to experience fine dining every once in a while. We at here on our first night in Vegas for the NYE weekend.

It's a very fancy and formal restaurant - it had a similar vibe to Nobu but maybe even higher class. The staff were so precise and made the whole dining experience memorable. They didn't miss a beat.

Food:

Appetizer: Lobster Bisque - best one I've ever had! I thought Mastro's in Malibu was the best but theirs puts Mastro's to shame! It was lighter in creaminess so it didn't overwhelm ones stomach. We also had King Crab legs. I usually would order this even though I love them because of all the work it takes to actually get to the meat, but as it turns out, they already cracked it for us so eating was easy and yummy!

Entree: Lobster, Filet Mignon, Grilled Salmon, Scallops - all very good but the Lobster was the best - duh!

Dessert: they had a special that night and my family split a triple chocolate mousse cake with ice cream. 

The presentation of each dish was very well thought out. I almost didn't want to eat it because it would tarnish it's beauty. In any case, we didn't find another restaurant that was as good as this even though we went to a couple more fine dining places later. AquaKnox is the best of the best in Las Vegas.

The apple salad closely resemble to what I had before in Thai restaurant. Kinda weird (but in a delightful way, hence the 4 stars review). Other main dishes were just as tasty.

I told him to just have at it at at table side. I wanted to watch how it was done. The seafood was very fresh and light. I loved the combo of the crab stuffed lobster. It was very flavorful. No need for drawn butter. The steak was cooked to my bf's specifications. The fish was delightful. It was citrisy and perfectly seasoned.

5279606,2014-12-23,5,25wTaO0_Rk-GLb4k2uMs0Q,"Invited to experience the skills of new Executive Chef Deric Meininger by Aquaknox General Manager Robert Menefee it was just after the restaurant's 5:30pm opening on Saturday that four friends sat down in the Forbes 4-Star establishment, and treated to a seven course tasting intended to showcase the newly crafted menu during one of Las Vegas' slowest weekends it is a wonder that the restaurant has flown under my radar for so long.

Owned by a restaurant group but lacking the marquee of much of The Venetian's celebrity chef offerings Aquaknox is the sort of restaurant many may walk past without even giving a second thought, yet much like Bartolotta at the Wynn those lucky enough to take the plunge are rewarded by refined environs, exemplary service, and the sort of seafood not commonly thought of in the middle of the desert, an opening amuse of raw dayboat scallops atop a crispy base both creamy and sweet while a follow-up oyster trio presented three varieties of briny bivalves in manners intended to highlight the best of each - the simple shooter especially impressive with a sweet start giving way to salinity before dissipating in a trail of heat.

Offered a complimentary wine pairing from which three of us opted for very small pours it was with course two of the tasting that the menu first veered from the ocean and spontaneously created to compliment an apricot and pear heavy Riesling a thick slice of liver shined, the caramelized exterior and smooth sapor finding surprising balance in cocoa tones reined in by the vegetal gastrique while crispy brioche and candied nuts added plenty of texture, the sorbet seemingly unnecessary to the plate but well placed when considering the wine.

Visited more than once by Chef Meininger, a quiet man despite recent stays in the kitchens of Gordon Ramsay, course three was the only item of the evening not of his own creation and considered a staple since the restaurant's inception the Aquaknox Fish Soup was every bit the signature it is billed to be, the spicy saffron broth bathing no less than a half-dozen varieties of seafood with pearls of fregula adding additional texture as top notes of pepper permeated the palate without overwhelming at all.

Again showing a deft hand with sea-life, both hearty and delicate, plates four and five featured fish, crustacean, as well as mollusk and with the meaty Wahoo delicately perched atop a rich ragout lightened by fruity chutney the ""surf and surf"" proved even more inspired as snappy prawns and a buttery scallop were each highlighted by their accoutrements, the former leaning slightly Mediterranean while the later took a more French approach - the finishing vinegar an especially welcomed addition atop the creamy squash base.

Taking a chance in finishing with beef it was with another trio that savories wound up and although the Ribeye proved a bit tougher than any of us would have preferred both the Filet and the Strip were fork tender and nicely seasoned, the flavor imbued by peppers and onions allowing the meat to stand up to the booming Cave Blend served alongside.

Once again intending to showcase the restaurant's best items it was to a triplet of tasters alongside one central plate that we were treated for dessert and with a delicious yet heavy Tawny guiding the way not a single item of the group was less than exemplary, the stunning key lime presentation as light as a cloud while banana cream pie was presented as a sort of Mille-Feuille, the bread pudding trending more like spongecake with rich butterscotch notes flooding the palate in each bite.

Undoubtedly receiving VIP treatment, but witnessing every table around us treated nearly the same, it was after a short tour of the restaurant that our meal would end and with espressos and teas served alongside a duo of sweet n' spicy mignardises it can only be said that Aquaknox more than exceeded expectations - a return visit for some a la carte options, the wood oven lobster, and a full-sized bread pudding inside the temperature controlled wine chamber almost inevitable to occur in the months to come.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,11,11,5,Vcno8uL99XFAmQEvu2skow

The atmosphere is very elegant, with a bit of a nautical twist. Each table adorned in white linen, and garnished with blue goblets & wine glasses. My boyfriend & I were celebrating an anniversary that evening, so we were ideally seated in a booth that was intimate, as well as comfortable. 

Service, unquestionably superior. I would expect nothing less from a restaurant of such high stature. Allen, our server- was very accommodating. He executed very wonderful suggestions, that MADE our experience. 

To start out, we got a vase full of long crispy bread sticks & a house smoked salmon dip. Let me tell you that if it weren't socially unacceptable...I would have licked the dish that the salmon dip came in, no problem. Needless to say, it was excellent, & I crave it daily. 

Next up to bat- Crab Cake & Lobster Bisque. Being a previous resident of New England & a connoisseur of food- I feel like a have a very firm palate when it comes to a few things, crab cakes & lobster bisque included. The Crab Cake was incredible, beautifully seasoned & served over a citrus flavored bed of corn relish. As for the Lobster Bisque, it wasn't too creamy- just perfect. It was really comforting & nostalgic to have some good New England food, without the 5 hour long flight. 

Seafood Plateau- Overwhelmingly fresh, standard assortment (oysters, oyster shooters, clams, mussels, lobster, crab claws, prawns). The ponzu oyster shooters...to die for! I was also a big fan of the champagne vinegar sauce that came with the oysters. Also, probably the biggest prawns I have ever seen. Very impressive! 

John Dory was my main course. Excellent suggestion from our server, Allen! Unlike any other fish I have ever had. It was sauteed on one side only, giving it an ambidextrous texture. I loved the crunch from the sauteed side, but the soft side exposed its sweetness, & also gave it a buttery finish. John Dory definitely tasted like fish, which was admirable to say the least. A lot of times, when seafood is over prepared, it loses that oceanic taste. Frankly, I would like my fish to taste like fish. The lobster succotash & sweet corn broth that it was served over was also delightful. It did a great job of complimenting the fish, without overshadowing it, with its bold flavors. 

Now, at this point- being a girl of 5'4""/95 lbs, I'm surprised that I wasn't already stuffed & in a food coma. But, there really is always room for dessert. Apple Tarte Tatin- sweet savory apple chunks, covered in caramel served beside a salted caramel ice cream. I thought the salted caramel ice cream to be very inventive & appropriate!!! Creme Brulee- my one true dessert staple. I enjoyed the vanilla beans that were tucked under the custard, it made for a very yummy last bite. 

Aquaknox was a great success! I look forward to making this our new go-to venue for seafood. The food exceeded my expectations, & the service was right on point.",4qPsVoJvyu_8cVnrXXxkJQ,1,2,5,RJNmkAX8YRNp72umqiUtOg

I discretely told the waiter the plan so he knows and for some reason he didn't get it and not only proceeded to be confused Very Loudly that other tables we're turning around to look at us.

There were only four courses, two of which were barely warm.  The crabcake was very fresh, but lacked the big chunks of crab that you should see at a nice seafood restaurant. It would have been better if it was hot. The truffled kabocha pumpkin gnocci was the only dish that impressed me. Again, not hot enough. For the entree, I expected to see lobster or crab as one of the options, after all it was New Years Eve in Vegas! Not so, I ended up eating chicken coq au vin, which was moist but I wanted something more gourmet than chicken. Beef was an option but I don't eat it. The dessert would have been good but it contained peanut butter, which I despise. A lot of people have peanut allergies, so I can't believe this was the only option they had. And they never even announced that it had peanut butter, they should have noted it on the menu. My gf did the wine pairing, she did not like most of the wines.

5387553,2012-09-17,1,25wTaO0_Rk-GLb4k2uMs0Q,"Absolutely delightful flavors and service.  We made reservations for a party of 6 during the last evening of Restaurant week.  Upon arrival we were warmly greeted and shown to our own private dining room with a single table for 6.  Immediately, they asked us if the music volume was ok and promptly lowered the volume to accommodate our enthusiastic conversations.  The inner decor was marine life focused with a tranquil and peaceful spa-like vibe, which greatly entertained our party, as one of the ladies is an avid diver.  

The first course consisted of a choice of the following delights: 
1) Lobster Bisque with Maine Lobster, Caviar, Creme Fraiche 
2) Crab Cakes with Marinated Vegetable Relish, Citrus Aioli, Petite Mache 
3) Halloumi & Watermelon with Shishito Peppers, Basalmic Vinegar 
4) Romaine Hearts & Treviso Pt. Reyes Blue Cheese Caesar

I opted for the crab cakes, which were excellent!  The citrus aioli totally made the dish.  I tasted the lobster bisque, which was also delish with delicate, but oh so rich creme fraiche.  The real winner of course #1 took me by surprise; the halloumi & watermelon salad.  Boyfriend ordered it because he is allergia a los mariscos (I know you all remember that phrase from Spanish 101 practice work!)  Back to the story, being the goat cheese-aholic that I am, I would have ordered this dish if I understood what halloumi was.  I will never make that mistake again!  Hailing from the Mediterranean island of Cyprus,  halloumi is a semi-hard, unripened brined cheese made from a mixture of goat and sheep milk, and sometimes also cow milk.  It has a high melting point, and often fried or grilled, with a strong savory bite, with a slightly creamy texture.  Mmmm mmmm gewd!

Before course #2 arrived, the manager spoiled our party with a 3 special treats, which he explained were some of his absolute favorite things on the menu.  
1) Smoked king salmon with pickled vegetables and buttery crunchy toasts  
2) NY littleneck clams with garlic & chili in white wine herb butter 
3) Hollander mussels in chardonnay herb butter broth.  
Honestly, this free little treat might have been the absolute best dishes to grace our table.  We were all politely sharing, but fighting our animal instinct to greedily ravage these dishes and lick the bottom of the bowls clean!

The second course consisted of a choice of the following indulgences:
1) Pacific White Prawns with Pearl Couscous, Lobster Cream, Cherry Tomatoes, Scampi Garlic Butter 
2) Prime Ribcap Steak Frites with Roasted Shallot Red Wine Glaze 
3) Mt. Cook Alpine King Salmon with Vegetable Ragout, Buerre Blanc 
4) Roasted Jidori Chicken - Celeriac Puree, Glazed Baby Carrots, Sauce Ver Jus
The whole party's orders were split between the prawns and the steak.  My only complaint is that I was torn between the salmon and prawns.  Having a less than stellar salmon experience the previous night led me to try the prawns.  All of the steaks were cooked to perfection.

The third course consisted of a choice of these treats:
Vanilla Bean Creme Brulee or Homemade Ice Cream Sundae
I think the entire table ordered and enjoyed the creme brulee, which was as delicious as it was beautiful.

Found this place while searching YELP and I'm so glad we did because it was FABULOUS! Everyone from the young woman at the front to the manager wished me a happy birthday and made us so comfortable that it was like being with friends. 

The real gems here were our waiter Jesse and his beautiful wife Tonya who took great care of us. I couldn't decide which dish to get and Jesse made some excellent recommendations! The surf and turf was out of this world. Our appetizers were amazing and my ""aquatini"" was so good that I drank 3 of them! 

Unfortunately we were so stuffed we ended up taking a lot of leftovers and were trying to figure out what to with them since we were seeing a show and Jesse was so great that he packed up everything and held it in the fridge for us until the show was over. 

To say they made my birthday amazing is putting it lightly. This restaurant had the best food I've ever had and the personal service made it spectacular! 

I would recommend them highly. It wasn't a stuffy environment, which is something I wanted to avoid, but it was still very classy. We had a nice private booth and were treated fabulous!",H74puWOIcKiLsuAl-RY4bQ,2,1,5,-89nVPELtZJtGKVYIJLq1w

5532861,2011-09-02,0,25wTaO0_Rk-GLb4k2uMs0Q,"I had dinner here and had a pretty good time! To start, instead of bread, they bring you these long crackers and a smoked salmon cream cheese dip, which was a really nice way to start the dinner. For appetizers we had a roasted beet, watermelon and blue cheese salad, as well as the smoked fish plate. The salad was really awesome. They key was getting a bit of everything on the fork and opening wide: super delicious. The smoked fish plate was alright, though not as good as the salad, and I ended up being more into the pickled veggies that came with the appetizer than the fish itself.

For entrees, we had the halibut and scallops. The fish was standard good, but the best part of the halibut dish was the marscopone mashed potatoes and tomatoes it came with. Really tasty. Was licking the plate with my fork. The scallops were also pretty good, seared on the outside and buttery on the inside though maybe a tad salty. Once again though, the sauce and accompaniments that came with the scallops were also quite good. We also got a side dish of vegetables, which I highly highly recommend, not just because the veggies taste good, but because you might want to actually eat something.

We got two desserts. The olive oil semolina cake with blue berry compote and orange basil sorbet just wasnt that good: the cake part got totally lost amid the strong flavors of the blueberry and sorbet. I guess its going for something subtle and interesting, but it didnt work. However, the flourless chocolate cake, a warm chocolaty concoction with a cup of caramel was super delicious. Definitely on the sweet side, but it had enough real chocolate and caramel flavor to balance the sweetness. Plus if you dont feel self conscious you can just drink the caramel from the little cup it comes in. Yum yum yum.

The service here is great, very attentive. The decor is also really nice, with some comfortable little booth seats.  Overall, I think we spent about 1.5-2 hours here, and had a good time. 

My only complaint about this place is that the amount of food you get is really really little. Even when it comes to the cheaper sides, like potatoes and tomatoes and veggies. I know Vegas is all about screwing you out of your money, but I feel here it was just too obvious. For example, the ""tomatoes"" that came with my halibut were 2 or 3 small cherry tomatoes. I would have also appreciated more of the potatoes. And of course the actually piece of halibut was pretty small. So yeah, it's pretty obvious they are holding back on the food to get you to order more. Even the lack of real bread speaks to that. Finally, the prices of course have the 20-30% ""vegas strip surcharge"", but I chose to ignore that in this review.",C9ZUpr7ct2oCi_nLEPHItw,0,0,4,n8s544uUMKkURkAAUQ9Y9A

I would still count this as a great place for a special dinner, but something was missing on our second visit (so rating 4 instead of 5 stars).  Highlights of the menu are some of the best Crab Cakes I've had, excellent Salmon and Butterscotch Bread Pudding.  The Salmon is cooked on the medium side (so if you want it more, be sure to mention something) and it's the best salmon I've ever had.  This place is huge and practically empty both times we went.

5601711,2013-11-22,1,25wTaO0_Rk-GLb4k2uMs0Q,"As the No1DP was staying at the Palazzo he passed by this restaurant a few times on his walk around the Venetian/Palazzo area and suggested this place as a possible dinner option. As we had wine as part of a ""happy hour event"" through the conference No1DP was attending, we talked to one of the line cooks about their menu and observed their open kitchen. Out of all the places we went to happy hour, this place impressed me enough to come back for dinner, so the No1DP promptly made dinner reservations later that night.

CONCEPT/VENUE: The Venetian/Palazzo's fine dining option with an emphasis on ""global water cuisine"". Fancy schmancy way of saying upscale seafood. 

At the entrance to the restaurant there is a water-encased walk-in wine cellar. We both thought that this would be a perfect way to showcase their premium wines as the wines themselves were ""hidden in plain sight"" by the waterfalls and enticing potential customers to come inside. As we went inside No1DP wondered how much it would take to eat inside the wine cellar as there was a table that could seat two. 

No1DP and I were placed in the booth area where other couples were present. The booths provide a place to people-watch other diners in the tables while having a little area to ourselves. It was also easy for bussers and waiters to pass by without saying anything.
 
SERVICE: Overall so-so. Service was good that silverware was replaced when a new dish was about to come out and that when you left your table, your napkin was remade for you. They were also quick to refill your wine glasses. The wait time between ordering our food and when the food actually came out was at least 20 minutes, and when the food finally came they gave No1DP the wrong dish, the Pacific Blue Prawns. We took a bite out of the prawns and thought it was good until No1DP realized that he ordered halibut. It took time to make another halibut and gave him a small salad for compensation as I ate my dish. No1DP liked his salad and the dressing. 

FOOD/DRINK
Wine was a low-oak Chardonnay, which was chosen because our dishes consisted of fish with hearty sauces. 

Amuse was a very small ""tuna salad"" of sorts with a mushroom on outside. Mushroom was firm and tuna was lightly seasoned.

Appetizer was a wild blue crab cake ($18): Chayote slaw, creole remoulade sauce. Crab cake was done perfectly as the crab fell apart after slicing it. Remoulade gave the crab a bit of spice and the vegetable medley on top sweetened the dish. 

My dish was a New Zealand john dory ($45): Lobster succotash, okra, wild mushrooms, sweet corn nage, black truffle. One of AquaKnox's signature dishes. The fish was soft, buttery and could easily be separated with a fork. Sauce was also delicious and went with the dish, made the fish a little more nutty. Sauce was heavy but not too heavy in that I could finish my dish. 

No1DP's real dish was a wild Alaskan halibut ($44): Lobster mashed potatoes, broccolini, piquillo pepper relish. I'm used to softer halibut and was a little disappointed in the texture, especially since I started realizing that I prefer fish with soft textures. No1DP did enjoy his fish as he's used to this type of texture for halibut and thought the sauce was delicious as well. 

Aside from the spotty service the No1DP and I enjoyed our experience here and I would recommend this place for fine dining/seafood if you want to stay in the Venetian area for dinner.",7gNtYzygF7dB8e7k1mWdjA,2,2,4,4jepFCyX_bndKd_LSMvKnQ

I've asked the servers what their dressing is and I couldn't quite get it out of him.  Nonetheless I'm going to try to replicate.  Its a misture of sesame oil, olive oil and a blend of citrus fruits (lime, lemon??).  

The prices aren't cheap.  That salad is 18 dollars.  Pretty high up there.  I've talked to others and some think they could charge 25-28 dollars for that salad and they would still buy it.  Most of the main courses are in the 30+ range.  Your bill can run up fast.

From the surprisingly complex Amuse Bouche of Mushroom & Mango Ceviche and the Alaskan King Crab appetizer to the first-class service by Jesse and Tonya, the night couldn't have been better.
I grew up in Alaska, so my standards for crab are high and the chef exceeded my expectations. I had the halibut, which in other less deft hands can be overcooked, but in this case, it was perfectly seasoned and mouth-watering. My friends, both who live far, far away from oceans, had the prawns and scallops and couldn't stop saying how it was the best seafood they had enjoyed in years.
I'd highly recommend the lobster mashed potatoes with thick, moist succulent chunks of lobster that doesn't overpower the potatoes.
I'd highly recommend this restaurant, especially if you can get a booth, which the manager Min made possible for us.

I happened to be there between 4pm and 7pm, when drinks containing Absolut vodka (among other possibilities) were buy one, get one.  So I scored two $13.00 martinis for the price of one!  Heaven!  What a steal in Las Vegas!  After the first martini, I realized I needed a snack in order to stand up without falling over.  My boyfriend and I decided to split the Seafood Trio.  Yum!  Truly this is one of the tastiest dishes I've *ever* had!  It was lump crab cake, sweet lobster and cocktail shrimp.  OMG!  It's something to dream about!  Service was great; prices were fair.

I've dined here twice- one intimate dinner, and one business dinner. This restaurant has the right seating and atmosphere for casual, romantic, and business meals. Different parts of the restaurant have different vibes and they seat you accordingly if you put in a note/request while reserving your table. Service is always super. 

Though everything I've tried here tastes amazing, there is one dish I recommend 1000% to everyone!! I just tasted it, and I literally think about this meal often and cant wait to have it again- it was that good!! 

AquaKnox Fish Soup - $53.00 (Jan 2017)
Description: Mediterranean tomato-saffron broth, pernod, maine lobster, mussels, clams, prawns, sardinian couscous.

I know it sounds like a hodge podge of all the seafood they could find... but don't worry. Its a bowl of pure amazingness served with a little crostini which was also crazy delicious. Go try it and tell me how much you love it ;)

Called in for reservations just in case and they said they would be able to seat us right away. Awesome! We got a nice private booth which made it seem like it was all planned. 

Wait staff were extremely polite and attentive. Chris was our main server and he also had a back up server to help. We started with steamed clams and seared foie gras. The broth for the clams was amazing and wanted to drink it straight. Foie gras was also delicious and on point. For our main dish my wife had a half crab stuffed lobster and King crab legs, and I had the Peruvian seabass. Nothing disappointed us at all and definitely hit the spot.

My family and I came to Las Vegas for my dad's 50th birthday. We originally had a dinner planned somewhere else but due to some people bailing we had to find somewhere else. A friend had recommended this restaurant. The staff was very polite and and sat us promptly. The menu was explained well and we were told of the nights specials. It wasn't until after we received our first round of drinks and appetizer that everything started to go downhill. The portion size is what I had expected and tasted really good but the service went right in the toilet. After our appetizer arrived my dad asked for a mexicana coffee. It took half an hour for that to arrive and nobody came back in between that time to ask anyone if they wanted drinks. When the waiter finally came back with the mexicana coffee he placed it in front of me,  not my dad. 15 minutes later we flagged him down to place another drink order. I asked for a mohito and my aunt asked for wine. The waiter took orders from half the table and took off without asking anyone else. He came back with two sangrias to which we told him we never ordered. The other end of the table never got a chance to order and actually had to walk across the hall to another store to get some wine and my mohito never showed up. Myself, my dad and my cousin's steak was not cooked how we asked for it. My cousin asked for well done to which he received charbroiled outside and red inside. I asked for medium rare and got rare. My dad asked for medium and got medium rare to rare. Throughout the night we had 4 different waiters serve us. Our collective overall experience was not good. I will not go here again nor will I recommend it to anyone else.",mnsYaluguazRpETGFoXxyQ,1,0,1,uLza7Mq6nHRz2ZDw3-dYqA

I took a customer here for dinner and it was top notch all the way. Our server was Zack and he did an amazing job explaining the menu, making suggestions and just making sure we were well taken care of.

We started with the 1 pound appetizer of king crab legs- warm with drawn butter. They were delicious albeit a bit pricey at $72.  I had the scallops which were perfectly prepared served over creamed corn and a cauliflower pur√©e. My client had filet mignon which she said was delicious.

We skipped dessert but we were brought a complementary amuse bouche of tuna (prior to our meal) and then a nice after dinner tasting of a pistachio tasting cocktail and a tiny pistachio flavored layer cake with custard.

Very pricy, classy place.  If you've got a client or date to impress, come to AquaKnox but be prepared to drop about $150 per person with a bottle of wine or about $100 without.",8B188riM26vd9B2uGqV3cg,3,2,5,z2n4DAd4OOO7qQbrEUE_pA

The atmosphere here is modern and refined; service was very good; and the food sublime.  We also found the waitstaff and kitchen to be very accommodating to special requests.  In our case French Fries were substituted for Butternut Puree, Mushroom, and Brussels Sprouts.  

For another starter following on the heels of a tasty amuse bouche of Chicken Salad with Piquillo Peppers on Focaccia, Pacific Prawns with horseradish-based Atomic Cocktail Sauce served on the side packed a cold, meaty, and spicy payload.  And a difficult to find King Crab Louie salad with shaved vegetables, Heirloom Tomatoes, Baby Iceberg Heart, and Green Goddess Dressing added to the cool gustatory vibe before the mains were brought to our table.  

Then we dined on excellent moist Roasted Welsh Seabass with Fingerling Potatoes and squash, and large New Bedford Scallops with hand-cut Kennebuck Fries.  Although we didn't order any dessert, we were each treated to a sweet Chocolate Hazelnut confection at meal's end.  

This is a place that takes pleasing its diners seriously.  Our server was solicitous of our needs, and I observed well-focused chefs working frenetically in the kitchen to quickly and correctly complete orders.

Calamari salad - friscee with a light panko calamari and dressing that was like a cake topper!
Chicken - I know at a place that does fish right -  but they know their chicken.  Hands down one of the best chicken dishes.  Crispy outside and juicy inside sitting on an artichoke/potato mash and a lemon butter sauce that I'm still dreaming about.
Scallops - cooked perfectly!
Salmon with the bacon, chard and chive sauce you will not be disappointed.
Roasted asparagus was a nice touch.  
Chocolate cake perfect ending -- except then they brought us carrot cake.  Frosting tasted like butter, only better.

2. Appetizer - Peach Caprese (delicious with a great blend of flavors...if only there was a little more avocado!)
3. Palate cleanser - Oyster! Free! (while I don't like oysters, the fact that it came with the meal was a pleasant surprise!)
4. Main - Prime Rib Cap Steak (cooked well, yummy onion rings, not the best steak ever, but well prepared)
5. Dessert - Belgium Choc Smores (MEHHHH, I was not a fan, but many of my fellow diners loved it)

Everyone who came to our table, be it to clear a dish or place a new one, greeted us with eye contact and ensured we enjoyed ourselves.  The sommelier was very knowledgeable and took time to explain aspects about the wine to us when we were unsure.

Some standouts from out from dinner were: 
-the oyster shooter, alcohol? yes. oysters? yes. together? double yes.
-heirloom tomato panzanella, it was drenched in vinaigretty (is that a word?) deliciousness
-seared yellow fin tuna, the fennel pollen gave it a nice earthy taste while to balance the subtle fishiness
-John Dory, just wonderful, it had a beautiful golden sear on the outside that tastes as wonderful as it looked

They have fresh seafood flown in daily.  The John Dory is their signature fish and it didn't disappoint.  It was a wonderful, elegant, seafood experience, albeit pricey.
