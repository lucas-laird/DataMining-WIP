The security was not the smartest bunch. The ID checkers let in SO many underage people, simply because they couldn't do math correctly. I am not really complaining, because I have underage friends, but still... it was kind of funny.

There were 2 guards in particular who were constantly checking Kalila for a 21+ wristband even after she had repeated showed it to him so many times.

The venue served its purpose and we had a good time, but that was thanks to the people who came out and our friends who produce the event. As far as I'm concerned the HRC was a good sized venue with annoying security (except for the guy next to the escalators downstairs -- he was cool).",_5i-gReOmEts7CLmnZXZ6A,1,0,2,zOzf6__iHnyGAktjIjDHbg

Everything else seemed to be the same as all the other HRC's.  The food rarely disappoints.  On this particular occasion, DH and I shared the appetizer sampler platter.  The emphasis on trying to sell merchandise to diners is a little annoying - and half the specialty drinks seem to be an automatic ""pay extra to keep the glass"" deal.   Not wanting to schlep a glass on the airplane, I selected one of the other drinks and it was disappointingly weak, yet expensive.  Should've just avoided the specialty menu and ordered some standard thing.

As for the music, it should've been called ""The Generally Fairly Mellow Rock Cafe"" - to us, a bit of a disappointment.  Maybe it's more rockin' late at night if the one in Tahoe is any guide.",chJ7qlfiI8swU-FiWHfL3w,0,0,3,rxECLgYn1FGs4i5m1XTNVA

567762,2013-07-23,0,1CR2ddUcjYYwRd5JLtiRrw,"We are in Vegas for the first time and naturally, we wanted to eat at Hard Rock Cafe. We  signed in OK, when our pager light up, we went up to the hostess stand expecting to be seated.  No, that was just to tell us to stand in a different spot. I have a hard time standing so I had given up my seat while waiting, If we knew we had to wait again, I would have stayed where I was!! Then we passed up several empty tables and booths to be seated in the back by the kitchen.  They then took forever before our waiter came over and another 30 minutes to get our sodas and lemonade. Then it was an hour before we got our food.  At one point, our waiter did come over and we were talking to him and the people at the next table called him and he turned around and waited on them.  We were mid sentence and he left us!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  That was so incredibly rude!!!!  Then when the other table left and they were cleaning off the table, the busboy stacked the glasses so high that the bottom glass shattered from the pressure.  There was glass all over and they only cleaned up part of it, my husband was trying to point out more glass and they obviously DID NOT like it being pointed out.  So he got up to go find the manager and told him what all was going on. He did come by our table for about 2 seconds and said he would go check on our food. That obviously upset the kitchen.  One son ordered a BBQ bacon burger and it was so dry and bland (no BBQ sauce on it and burger itself was dry and flavorless) that he could not eat.  I had the pulled pork sandwich and it also was dry! I only ate about a quarter of it. My other son is usually ravenous and eats anything. I gave him half of my sandwich and he only took 1 bite and said no thanks.  Anyway, that gives you an idea of what we thought of the food.  And the table with the broken glass, well we kept pointing out where more glass was and they finally finished cleaning BUT there was still more broken glass under the table.  I hope that whoever sits at that table with sandals on and cuts there foot sees this so they know it was pure negligence on the part of the restaurant!!!!",B2O97qGZc2pLzl08Y5LPGw,0,0,1,ynmYuM680F1mQ_uzKMyEJw

So they weren't very busy.  Our server was polite, but after ordering it took an hour to get our food.  I ordered the brisket sandwich.  The first bite was all fat, turned out the entire sandwich was all fat, and inedible.  My father in law order chicken nachos, no tomatoes (he can't eat them).  They came covered with tomatoes so he sent them back for the beef nachos, again stated no tomatoes to the same server.  When he finally got them, surprise, more tomatoes.  Combine that with messed up orders and undercooked burgers for the rest of our party, and we were pretty unhappy.  The server brought over the manager, Tim or Ted or something (medium build white guy with a shaved head).  At the table he was all ""right, of course, of course, I understand."". And offered us deserts on the houseto make up ffor the issues, so we ordered desert to try and salvage the experience.  He also promised to take the messed up items off the menu.  When we got the bill we found out they had charged us for everything, including the complimentary deserts, and took a flat $100 off the bill (original total of about $250).  When I confronted the manager one on one about the bill (the deserts we were charged for, and the flat $100,taken off), he became confrontational and said it wasn't his job to go through the check item by item and take things off.  When I offered to sit down with him and do it for him, he said ""if you want to go through item by item and argue over 14 cents, that's up to you."". He then assured me there was no one above him to speak to and walked off.  We paid our bill because we are not the type to walk out on a check, and our server got a $10 pitty tip.  I will never go back there, especially with guests from out of town, and I will never recommend it to anyone.

596377,2010-07-22,1,1CR2ddUcjYYwRd5JLtiRrw,"I went here with a group of friends because we were going to a concert there (Metal Elvis, meh). We weren't expecting much but were seduced by the convenience of eating at the same place as the show.

The first problem was that one person in our group made a reservation online, but they had no record of it when we got there, despite our having a confirmation number. So, we had to wait for a table.

The next problem is that the Mint Julep I had was probably 90% simple syrup. Truly an awful cocktail (not to mention that the waitress had no idea what kind of bourbon they had).

The service was slow. Some manager type came by and gave us some kind of locals only frequent member card. Not enough for everyone, mind you. Which was fine by me because I hate that kind of crap. Don't need another card to carry around.

The group shared a plate of nachos which were OK. Kind of hard to screw up corn chips and cheese, so kudos to the Hard Rock for that.

The special that night was a portabello mushroom sandwich, which seemed to be a reasonably healthy alternative to everything else on the menu. But it was so slathered in cheese and this obnoxious mayo concoction that it really was as much a greasy, drippy mess as any burger. Came with a salad but most of the ""vegetables"" were white, so that was a disappointment, let me tell you.

Has a the WOW factor for sure, yes is a tourist place, but its the Hard Rock what do you expect.
It has the clothes/retail store on the ground level and if you go up the stairs you have the cafe. 

I love Hard Rock stuff, T-shirts, mugs, key rings ect...The clothes and retail items aren't really that expensive, BUT go upstairs and be prepared.

I got a Sandwich and coke and my wife got chicken strips and fries with an ice T. lets just say filling up the Envoy was cheaper.

756545,2010-09-13,0,1CR2ddUcjYYwRd5JLtiRrw,"Gestern waren wir im Hard Rock Cafe direkt am Las Vegas Boulevard, um eine Mahlzeit zu uns zu nehmen. Nach den knapp 40 Grad Celsius, die draussen herrschten, war der klimatisierte Innenbereich wie ein kleiner Himmel für uns.
Der Kellner war zwar freundlich, machte aber den Eindruck, dass alles schnell gehen muss, damit die Plätze zügig an die nachkommenden Gäste weitervergeben werden können. Dieser Eindruck bestätigte sich, als er uns fragte ob wir noch etwas wünschen, wir nach der Rechnung verlangten, und er die Rechnung schon fertig dabei hatte.
Von der Atmosphäre her ist das Restaurant typisch Hard Rock Cafe: Laute Rockmusik, Star-Memorabilia an den Wänden und die typische Karte, die aus Burgern, Steaks und den üblichen Vorspeisen besteht. Man weiß halt, was man bekommt, wenn man ins Hard Rock Cafe geht.
Während meine Frau den 'Honey Citrus Grilled Chicken Salat' bestellt hatte, habe ich mir die 'Hickory Smoked BBQ Ribs' mit Pommes, Krautsalat und einem Bohnendip gegönnt. Beide Gerichte schmeckten hervorragend, leider waren die Rippchen nur lauwarm. Dafür war das Fleisch aber so zart, dass man es mit der Zunge zerdrücken konnte.
Zum Essen hatten wir noch ein 'Shock Top', eine amerikanische Biersorte, die ein belgisches Bier darstellen soll. War ganz ok, hatten uns aber ein wenig mehr davon versprochen.
Preistechnisch ist es im Hard Rock Cafe natürlich nicht ganz billig, mit der Rechnung bekamen wir allerdings einen 20%-Rabatt-Gutschein für den Shop und da wir da sowieso einkaufen wollten haben wir noch nebenbei 6$ gespart.",7rYTA0wXJuJ_XKReVR_gOQ,0,0,4,cJXm3FGsWPd3aWNLQMam7Q

They had some very cool memorabilia on the walls, just as we've all come to expect of the Hard Rock, except this time it appears that they put a lot more thought into the color schemes than what I've seen before.

When we said we were still waiting for our food,  he said he didnt ask to hear us complain. After asking about our food twice,  Anthony finally brought it and didnt apologize or comp a drink or anything. It left a really bad taste in my mouth.

1220228,2012-01-28,0,1CR2ddUcjYYwRd5JLtiRrw,"First, the food I had here was AMAZING.  My burger was SOOOOO good.  The problem was the service.

We went here for lunch on a weekday, probably around 11am (it was early and lunch had just started).  We were STARVING, which is why we were eating on the strip in the first place.

There were only three tables, including us.  The place was pretty much empty.

After being seated with menus, we were deserted.  We did not see another employee for at least 20 minutes, and when we managed to flag him down and ask where our server was (I mean, it's not like they were busy), he said that he'd go get our server.  It was a while later before the server finally showed up to take our order.

Again, we were starving.

After ordering, it happened all over again.  We thought that, surely, after leaving us with NO service after being seated they'd be attentive and get our order through fast.  (Still, only about three tables were seated, including us).  Boy were we wrong!  Our orders took FOR EVER.  A table that had arrived about ten minutes after us paid their bill and left about ten minutes before the food ever showed up.  I haven't experienced that kind of wait at any restaurant on a busy night on the strip ever.

After having to hunt down our food, we finally ate and our server apologized for the delay.  We were very dissatisfied and when he brought the bill he said he'd apply his employee discount to make up for the bad service, but that was all he could do.  His discount was 5%.  Meh.  It was pretty expensive anyway (being on the strip) and little that discount didn't really rectify much.  Also, I figure places like these usually have coupons or gift cards or something to give out in a situation like this and we didn't get anything like that.

The only reason this is two stars instead of one is that 1) the food was insane and 2) at least the server made some kind of tiny effort to acknowledge our bad experience by giving the slight discount.  But I still can't get what the delay was.  Maybe their server was also the chef.  And the hostess.  And the bartender.  And the janitor.  And the guy out front entertaining pedestrians...",C3ik6wTjTqQW4wpQRek53g,0,0,2,Vutih_VxC9tnop9KpAUHKA

I got level 3 which features a huge split level dining hall, full size bar and a small intimate stage for live acts at the back of the room. (see Chris Cornell above). The number of mouths this place can feed at a time is huge at more than 800 seats.  Just imagine the kitchen on a busy night!

The food is the same menu at any Hard Rock.  I got a bacon cheeseburger which was a lot better than expected, especially the bacon.  Pricing at 13 bucks is a little high but you are on the strip and at the best HRC ever built.  It would be nice if the drink menu included pricing.  It was relatively slow when I was there.  And since all the staff is new they are eager to please and clearly instructed to go for the upsell.

After the meal you can just roam around and that's where it gets really fun.  The path to the third floor restroom is lined with infamous and at times chilling news headlines of the deaths of Lennon, Elvis and both Kennedys.  On a lighter note, a special room is dedicated to wedding memorabilia.  Elvis and Priscilla, John and Yoko, Ike and Tina and my heart skipped a beat when I came across a signed acoustic from Kurt Cobain at the Kurt and Courtney section.  Another awesome moment was a drum set from White Zombie mounted on the wall as you go down the stairs.

Another thing that makes this place unique is all the interactive technology.  Lots of Microsoft Surface tables and a huge touchscreen wall where you can check out everything that's on site.

If this doesn't become the flagship HRC soon I will be shocked.  Anyone who loves music (anyone with a pulse) needs to grab a meal or drink here.",On_1ZwRgD2Ry0eoKYC29iQ,2,2,5,iFN6ZzXFzVtARkzkq9mT0Q

I only fly direct from NY to Vegas. When I land I like my first dinner to be all ready and set up. I stay at the cosmopolitan every time. But I love a good burger. In Vegas why not spoil your self to a burger?!  The night of when I land. My promoter told me about this hardtack deal.  I get the $25 per person deal at the hard rock. This includes.

VIP seating (no lines, priority seating)
VIP special menu
Beer is included 
Desert of my choice 


The best part is it's pre paid. there is indoor and outdoor seating so you can sit inside or outside. If you choose outside there is a great view of the strip.  I recommend sitting outside. 

I enjoy knowing my food and my guests meal is already paid for the first night in Vegas. From the cosmo I take a car to the hard rock. It's a bit of a walk. The staff is always top notch. I have never had bad service here. Last year I even used my $25 deal at the bar.  I still had great service. 

Overall I recommend this Hard Rock Cafe to anyone. The food is always consistent for a chain. The VIP is a nice additive. I have been very impressed with the service so far. I will continue to come for this deal when I land in Vegas!!",s6lIsLlPcjaHDhXxTV9kKQ,5,5,5,Z3coEwfDT4DCGqpABFcbTw

I went back to the host stand said that we have been waiting for that table that they just gave to somebody else. The server that was standing at the host stand at that moment gave me dirty looks like I was a moron.

Yelp's check-in & the ""cafe"" portion of Hard Rock Cafe were upstairs. With checking into YSB came voucher tickets for a free Bacardi Torched Cherry cocktail at the Hard Rock Cafe bar. Go to the bar for a free drink? Don't gotta ask me twice...

So, the girlfriend & I sidled up to the bar. Service was extremely friendly & we got our cocktails in a jiffy. While sipping our refreshingly free drinks, we noticed a small menu of items specifically for Yelp: Pork Belly Sliders, Braised Short Rib Tacos & Fried Stuffed Jalapenos.

I ordered all 3 to sample. Our food was taking a while, but our bartender went back to check it out & we had our order shortly after. The Tacos & the Jalapenos were excellent, flavorful, nicely spicy & were served with knockout delicious dipping sauces. Comparatively, the Pork Belly Sliders were a little bland.

All 3 dishes were tapa-sized, so there was room for dessert. We got the Caramel Xango. Oh. My. God! Now that alone was worth walking into the building for. Cheesecake wrapped in tortilla, deep-fried, & then served with whipped cream + caramel & strawberry sauces drizzled all over everything. Wow.

While chewing & sipping, we took in the Hard Rock ambiance. Lots of glass & steel with plenty music memorabilia throughout. It's pretty cool. For the most part the food was pretty good too & service was top notch.

We liked the Hard Rock at other places we've been (Orlando & San Francisco) so we figured we'd give it a try.
It's the usual high prices of Hard Rock (ouch!).
They take your picture before you can get a table. I really didn't appreciate this. We all looked like crap after a long day walking the Strip, and my daughter has some sensory issues that cause her to not like situations like that. I didn't like being forced into that. It would be nice if they *asked* if you wanted your picture, not corralled you into the picture station right after the hostess station. 
So after the picture taking, we then got hounded by our waiter to join some VIP club. No thanks, I'm here to eat. After we got hounded by the waiter, we got hounded by another girl who brought our pictures to our table and wanted us to buy them. Thanks but no thanks, they look awful and I'm dropping too much on dinner anyways. I really just wanted to be left alone to enjoy my meal, but I couldn't!
I do like the Hard Rock atmosphere, with the music & the memorabilia.

2308358,2012-09-16,4,1CR2ddUcjYYwRd5JLtiRrw,"This is a review of this Hard Rock as a concert venue only. 

Having not been to this location previously - I downloaded directions from the Hard Rock's website. The parking situation sounded tricky - and it was. The fact that the directions provided were incorrect didn't help. Parking for the venue is in the parking garage for the Showcase Mall - and costs 3.00 (cash only) to boot. Paying for parking is unheard of on The Strip! 

OK - so once we find the parking lot, pay and park - the elevator dumps you out on a side street. About a block away from the entrance. We started walking toward Las Vegas Blvd. and slowly realized that all these people waiting in line were waiting to get into the venue. This is where it gets silly. 

In order to get into the concert venue one needs to:
1. Wait outside in line in the desert heat.
2. Once you get past the first staggered security point - you're released by the security guard to walk down the public sidewalk (with everyone else that just happens to be strolling the strip unimpeded) to the entrance to the Hard Rock Store. You walk through the store - right through all the shoppers to three flights of steep stairs. All the while, there is nothing to keep random people that haven't waited in line from joining your group on the way (as one girl did - slipping into our group right behind us). So, lesson number one - only suckers wait in line...
3. It took about 45 minutes total to get into the venue - and we arrived at posted start time. Luckily, the show started late so we didn't miss any of the show.

Once we got inside, the venue actually wasn't bad. The sound was decent and although the place holds 1100 people - it still manages to feel intimate. In keeping with Hard Rock tradition - the artifacts and historical exhibits were well done and cool. Drinks are at Strip club price - $16.00 a round for a bourbon & coke and a Miller Light.

All I can say is, I've been a musician and an avid rock show attendee for three decades now - and I'm sorry - but it's obvious to me that they built the venue with no consideration as to how a large audience would actually access the performance space on the 3rd floor. This major planning fail kind of set the tone for the night unfortunately...

UPDATE: I received a few very nice messages from Hard Rock management - and they'll be working to address the entrance issues and are hoping to make this location into a premiere Las Vegas music venue.  I can't wait to see what they can work out.",KFWOn7x19RmrO6kzTJYmrQ,4,2,2,4P2U9CHqYlkHfLmOeOpxJw

Food: Disappointing to say the least.  Pulled pork sandwich was dry and the bbq sauce was too sweet and overpowering.  I also observed my other friends who did not finish their food, not a good sign given that it was lunch and we were hungry. 

Drinks: had a large sized mojito which is supposed to have at least 3 shots.  Tasted like there was no booze at all.  My friend who got the same drink absolutely concurred.  Not happy.

Service: combined with the 20% off Yelp coupon, the service was the saving grace points of our visit.

First of all the staff was just amazing, I don't remember ever being treated better at a restaurant! Every person we interacted with was very friendly and helpful, like above and beyond helpful! Our server was a bit off the wall to look at, but it appears they encourage it here and I think that is why everyone here seemed to really enjoy working for Hard Rock. 

I ordered a burger special which was basted in an IPO Bbq sauce, topped with a grilled pineapple, bacon, and some mango salsa. It was a half pound burger, and I was a bit worried about that, because they often end up being bland and dry, but their patty was very high quality and tasty, and cooked a perfect medium rare. My burger was awesome, and I would get it again in a heartbeat. 
I also got my burger with a side of bacon cheese fries which were delicious, the fries were crispy, the cheese was melty, and it was real bacon chopped up and fried to a crisp, no cheap bacon bits here. 

My wife ordered the smokehouse sandwich, which was a pulled chicken sandwich topped off with haystack onions, fried jalapeños, and a chipotle purée. She thought it was good but wished she had gotten the pork instead, as she isn't a huge fan of pulled chicken, and thought it was a BBQ chicken breast when she ordered it (her oversight in reading the menu) I had a bite or 2 and thought it was really good, the chicken was fresh and had a nice crisp to it, but was also tender, juicy and flavorful. 
I also ordered a ""Strawberry Basil Lemonade"" which was just delicious, and a godsend on such a hot day! Usually the default combo would be mint leaf, but wow basil is my new favorite lemonade additive!

I'm glad we stopped in here, and will make Hard Rock a regular stop from here on out, if I had one complaint it would be that their prices are pretty out of control, but then again what isn't in Vegas?",p_6-Q9uAqn3i8NLjudkJ1A,0,0,5,g7vs9KExzSzz1mbk8M1rLg

2629126,2017-01-17,2,1CR2ddUcjYYwRd5JLtiRrw,"I'm torn on this review because, in all fairness, our service was amazing, but the food was very lackluster. We arrived around 8:45 on a Saturday night with a party of 12 and were fortunately seated within 30 minutes-the restaurant was not crowded at all. That alone should probably say something. The reason my group picked this as a dinner spot was due to the number of picky eaters and unwillingness to stray too far from their hotel. This was 100% not my choice to eat dinner here, but with so many good reviews, I figured there might be something that was appealing.
After we were seated, our server brought us menus right away and drinks came quickly along with the nacho appetizers we ordered for the table. That part of the meal was fine-no complaints here. Nachos were run of the mill-not bad but nothing stellar. It turned out that I was glad these were ordered, because my actual meal was terrible.
I ordered the Veggie burger-on the menu it's clear this is not an ordinary veggie burger. It comes topped with ""roasted"" veggies-Portobello, zucchini, peppers and onions. On paper that sounded good but the execution was lacking. The veggies were flavorless, soggy and oily. The veggie patty itself didn't seem well cooked and had an odd taste to it. The fries it came with were okay-nothing that stood out-adequate but the disappointment in the veggie burger itself outweighed any goodness there.
I'm sure the kitsch value of this place has value to some people but for me this a waste of time, money and an opportunity to have a good meal after a long day of adventures in Vegas. Never again.",dgFZ18vo2cYPrQuIO700lA,4,2,2,eTPpflZnsnIuSNcOiJ3AQA

I had the potato skins and they were pretty good.  You know potato skins are hit and miss, sometimes delish and other times nasty, these were good, some of them better than others and a fair amount of toppings (cheese bacon and onions) on top, served with sour cream.  It hit the spot though.

I had a SOB Burger, which is a cheeseburger with guac and chipotle. It was kind of uninspiring as far as a burger goes - massive, but I felt like the chipotle flavor was played down. Also it fell apart after the first couple of bites - to be fair, I think they anticipated it, they gave me a big ass steak knife to go with it. The fries were really good.

Alcohol: I gave up drinking after the first two rounds, because my draft Newcastle Ale was 5.60. Don't drink on the Strip if you're a local, you will always be disappointed. The bartender was attentive to my needs and cashed me out quickly.

The Concert: The real reason to come here is that the third floor is a MASSIVE concert space. It's a really nice venue, and they've been booking really interesting gigs.

My boyfriend had never been to a Hard Rock Cafe and so we decided that compared to the other places on the strip this would be somewhat in our price range and we wouldn't get hassled since we look like weirdos.

The place is neat, the weird cyber interactive stuff is cool maybe all Hard Rocks have those now, I don't know but it was fun looking at the kind of memorobelia that appealed to us at our table.  It was also fun voting for the music that would be played next, but we kept getting beaten out.

The service was meh.  Stupid jokes from the waitress asking us what band we were in.  Yes, because obviously if we were in a band and playing in Las Vegas we'd totally be eating at the Hard Rock Cafe on the Strip... ugh.  Also, this was kind of annoying - my boyfriend's ID picture is really old when he was younger, chubbier, and just had his wisdom teeth out, so in a word he looks kinda bad.  He's aware of that.  The waitress I guess in an attempt to... I don't know make him feel better?  Went on and on and on about how she shouldn't even accept the ID because it looks nothing like him now and how's he's gotten way more attractive... wtf?

The food sucked, which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined.  My food was one degree above cold and my boyfriends food ended up making him sick.  The waitress never came back with condiments we asked for and we considered doing a runner because it was taking so long to get the check... and we were one of six occupied tables....

So all and all avoid this place if you can.  I've been to many a Hard Rock in my life, but this was the worst as far as food and service go.  One of the best as far as decor go.  Take it for what you will.",v9GwhTHWVtBMGyQVi14qEQ,2,0,2,4_yDrh4J28L9aUbWsyesAg
2782456,2014-07-28,0,1CR2ddUcjYYwRd5JLtiRrw,"My boyfriend and I were attending the Tuesday Blend that was held upstairs on the 3rd floor that's at the top of both the store and restaurant. We got to Tuesday Blend pretty darn early around 10 to where there were no people on the dance floor or anything, so I basically persuaded/pushed my boyfriend to go downstairs and go get some appetizers/food just to kill time and also because we never tried it.
So we went downstairs and the staff was so friendly. Passing through Hard Rock, the restaurant always looks nice on the outside, but actually sitting and being there was a lot nicer than I expected. I wanted to sit at the bar because I assume that's always the quickest service, but we actually got a window seat, which was perfect... better than the bar area and we just people watched. We got quick service with a nice waiter with funny and nice coworkers who all seemed to get along very well, which is good for them and the job itself.
Anyhow we ordered two burgers. I don't remember the name, but I believe my boyfriend got something mushroom(?) and I got something jalapeño(?), but it was so delicious. The meat was cooked perfect! The meat wasn't hard like some other restaurants and it didn't taste like it was right out of the freezer or anything. It tasted so fresh and so juicy.
Food was good. Customer service was cool. Environment/atmosphere was chill. Window seat was amazing. If we ever go to Tuesday Blend again, I wouldn't be surprised if we stopped by the restaurant again. :)",zzUlFuJ5HFNEm15o9YC9Qg,0,0,5,yZxqVZ5Rp-tONRZ1GyQAaQ

It's definitely a good place to check out a show, particularly if it's general admission, as ours was. 

There will be confusion when you arrive and try to decide where they woud possibly have a concert in this damned t-shirt shop. Fear not. Walk to the back of the t-shirt shop and go up the stairs. The line will form beginning at the top of those stairs at second floor level (the restaurant).

Once the ""doors"" open, you'll move up another flight to the 3rd floor venue.

If the show is 21+ you *must* have ID. Yes, even you, you old son of a bitch. Even you. There's a pretty intense search, then you're in.

I hope your fellow audience members are as chicken shit as ours were. Most of them lingered in the back by the bar and windows, leaving the entire floor open for the taking. We opted to take about 15 square feet touching the stage, right in front of the lead singer's microphone. We saw Psychedelic Furs this night. I posted a pic taken from our piece of land. Pretty darned impressive! I never thought I'd have Richard Butler sweat on me, but I'll be damned if that didn't happen.

The upstairs is very nice. There are huge windows near the bar, overlooking all the chaos outside.  The bar area is quite nice, although, in true bar fashion, the drinks are too expensive.  It was fairly dead in there (being a Sunday night) and the bartender was pretty cool. I had ordered a Vodka Cranberry, and it was waaay too expensive, but poured with Smirnoff.  Being a bit of a vodka snob, I asked the bartender how much is the different to pour Ketel One or Chopin.  It was $1.50; cool. Next drink I ordered, I'd get it that way.

So I turn to talk to my friends, and a few minutes later, the bartender brings me a new vodka cranberry, with Chopin to replace my original drink and wasn't charging me for the difference.  What a nice guy!  Later in the night he also gave one of the girls in our party a round of shots for us. They were terrible! But they were free =)

The area to watch the band/dance is spacious with a good amount of tables.  The band itself, Sin City Sinners, was good, as always. I have seen them a few times and they're full of energy and awesome hard rock!

As we stumbled down the stairs at the end of the night (be careful!), we stopped at a couple tabletop arcade style games and played for a while.  That was fun too!",-lh59ko3dxChBSZ9U7LfUw,3,3,4,ny00CoPAipr2DoJRwwFa5A

Most will probably not see the same menu that us Yelpers saw at the prices we saw, but I'll be blunt and say it was pretty much happy hour dishes at higher than usual prices. Yes, we are in Vegas, but if you are not going to be a buffet or fancy then you better be cheap.

Oh Hard Rock food, I have a 3 star feeling about you:

-=-Hickory Smoked Pork Belly Sliders-=- Too bready for the meat and flavor content. Pork Belly is so yummy when it leaks it's juices all over your bread. Wasn't the case here.

-=-Braised Short Rib Tacos-=- They weren't stuffed by any means, but I felt were the most tasty of the bunch. The bites into these were the most enjoyable I had for this meal.

-=-Nacho Mama Fried Jalapenos-=- These were a crispy surprise, but then again you dip anything in ranch and I'm a fan. Dip my napkin in ranch and I'd probably faint.

-=-Twisted Mac and Cheese-=- We ordered this outside of the Yelp menu. It was all tons of cheesy. For what it was, without meat additives (ignoring the chicken on top, doesn't count), it was a good blend, but was still missing something. Can't put a finger to it.

Oh Michael, so awesome you were as our server. You were 5 star awesome. The Yelp Elites were in town and you delivered. We'll be sure to post of our group photo here. I hope our other Yelp Elites were able to have the pleasure as well.",N6llta3D8IVSPQ2k_rvWbA,0,0,3,8eeEDXrAQlbAqc20kHgdAQ

First, upon stepping inside, there are about six screens which show Hard Rock Cafes in different cities of the world, live, allowing us to really watch what is happening in each of these venues, thousands of miles away.  I spent a few moments to watch diners in Beijing!  We went for drinks and for lunch, and while we were making our way to the bar/restaurant on the second floor, we spent time admiring outfitsworn by different pop icons which were diplayed in glass cases throughout. We also amused ourselves with the various interactive screens with music videos and interviews.  Once we sat down, we ordered tequila shots and some drinks.  They had the tequila we wanted and I had a really great mojito.  The food is the typical fare of Hard Rock Cafe...bar food, and some salads....I did, however, really enjoy my chicken salad.  Our server was super friendly and told us that they have live music on the third level every night and a DJ one night.  He then brought passes to get in without paying cover.  After that, we scored some rodeo gear from the Coors Girls, as the rodeo was passing though town and a cowboy was signing autographs. After lunch, we went to the balcony to check out the view, which overlooks the strip, across from the Monte Carlo.  Then, we went upstairs to check out the music club, though it was not open yet, as it was lunchtime.  The third level has an impressive circular bar and a full stage that reminds me of the House of Blues.

Hardly anyone was there when we went for brunch on a Sunday, so we were able to wander around the restaurant and look at the stuff to our heart's content.

We sat in one of the spacious booth seating across from the bar. Musician, Justin Carder had the crowd singing along with him while he performed famous cover songs from different artists. His voice was stunning! The noise level was also perfect which made it even much more enjoyable. There is no need to shout for anyone to hear you. ;) 

The modern bar area with talented mixologists, offers a scenic view of the strip with bar seating and lounge area. Patio dining is also available depending on the weather. On this trip, it was bbbbrrrr cold and windy.

Now let's talk food. I've been to several Hard Rock Cafes and have only experienced mediocre tasting dishes from their ""Authentic American Cuisine"" menu. But to each is own. We ordered the Jumbo Bruschetta classic for our appetizer, the Twisted Macaroni and Cheese with grilled chicken and the Carolina Pulled Pork sandwich. For a party of 4, it was plenty, but again, average in taste. On the other hand, our waitress Rachelle was outgoing and deserves kudos for her exemplary service!

After visiting M&M World and the World of Coca-cola, my wife, kid, and I stopped by the Hard Rock Cafe for lunch. It's an impressive looking place. Three stories. The first is the store, second is the restaurant, and third is the concert area.

The last time I ate at a Hard Rock Cafe was probably the late '90s (in Cancun). I wasn't impressed back then with the food and I wasn't expecting much this time around either. But, it was actually better than I had hoped.

The wife got a burger that wasn't on the menu. A beef patty topped with a portobello mushroom and haystack onions, along with some other stuff. Also came with a side salad. She liked it and it was enough food for two people. 

I got the BBQ bacon cheeseburger (topped with caramelized onions, crispy bacon, and cheddar cheese). It was juicy and tasty and the BBQ sauce had a sweet, smokey flavor to it. Not bad at all. I also had a margarita with pomegranate and some other fruity flavors (don't judge me... sure I occasionally drink fruity cocktails. I don't care what others think.) that was pretty good.

Our son got the chicken tenders. Three to an order with a large heap of fries. 

Our server was friendly and stopped by often to check on us. But wasn't overly intrusive. He even brought out a complimentary sundae for our kid after he found out it was his birthday.

There's a huge interactive wall just past the hostess stand and there's also a touchscreen at each booth with info about memorabilia, merchandise in their store, and a voting system for the next song that's played in the restaurant. It's a great idea, but the interface is clunky. Anyone who's ever used an iphone or android will probably find it to be a little primitive. Also, there was a huge disconnect between the song that the screen indicated was playing and the music that was piped through the sound system. I don't think it listed the correct song the whole time we were there.

Overall, this is a place that will attract only tourists looking for a relatively cheap, predictable meal (at least for the second floor dining area). The food was 3-star worthy, but I'm tossing in an extra star because of the good service.",C2C0GPKvzWWnP57Os9eQ0w,7,5,4,QaHq5nNqnz3uGz05uzYEqQ

To eat my wife had a barbecue combo. She loved the juicy-ness of her meal.

I enjoyed ""The Texan... Chipotle and hickory bar-b-que sauce, cheddar cheese, crispy jalapenos and crispy onions... everything is bigger in texas! go big & make it a 10oz. bar-b-que sandwich for an additional charge"" Yeah I made it the 10oz.

Yes I copied those descriptions from the menu.

Las Vegas Boulevard is famous for people dressing up like celebrities, Elvis, Hello Kitty, and various super heroes are very popular. Take a picture with them if you want, but these people usually ask for a cash tip .

As my wife and I exited The Hard Rock Cafe, I immediately noticed that four people were dressed like members of the rock band KISS. Ace Frehley immediately noticed my tee shirt and pointed at it.

It has been awhile since I have eaten at a Hard Rock and I have never eaten at this one on the strip. 

This particular visit was in June 2014.

The day was hot my friends...110+ but since I had just endured one of the coldest winters up in Canada (Temps of -50) I opted to sit on the patio...it was a good idea at first, but after about twenty minutes I was hurting and the water service was lacking.  That is the only reason for 3 stars, but it's Vegas for crying outloud and it should be just common sense to keep checking on the water even though I was drinking beers at the same time...I ended up only getting one water in all that time. 

The waitress who took my order was great at taking the original orders, but the follow through was lack luster. She brought me the original beer and water that I asked for, but then I never saw her again...not even to receive the bill. 

After waiting and waiting...(there were other patrons on the patio, but I seemed to be in the twilight zone) I had to go to the bathroom. So I went. When I came back, the big guy at the door was looking at me a little sternly and then the waitress came up to me...shes like, ""Oh there you are, we thought you took off"". I was like WTF, why would they say that...you don't come to the table to check on my food, refill my water or beer and then you act like I am a dasher! 

Needless to say the tip was about as stellar as the service. When I left I gave the guy a return glare. I should have talked to the manager, but I was honestly too perturbed to deal with excuses. 

TIP: If you want patrons to pay the bill, give them the bill, don't treat them like thieves when they go to the bathroom if you haven't given them a bill yet. 

It's Vegas, and I like the food there, which was great (Burger) but there are a lot of other places to go where they may treat you a little better. Once I paid the waitress said, ""I didn't think you would just take off"" to which I wanted to reply ""I didn't think you would be such a shitty waitress"" but I didn't because...well, I didn't think of it at the time :)

3842680,2012-03-08,0,1CR2ddUcjYYwRd5JLtiRrw,"I recently stayed at the Aria on a family trip to Las Vegas. I took my parents here for our last dinner. I think it was the best meal that we got our money while on The Strip.

Pros
-Our waitress was a superstar. She was ridiculously friendly and positive, even with my gloomy Asian father. She came to check up on us at least every 10 minutes, and never let our glasses get half empty. I don't give a lot of 20% tips, but I didn't need to think twice about this one.
-Entertainment at the table! We were seated at a booth, and attached to the wall was a touch-screen that let you could flip through musical memorabilia and look at anything from Britney Spears' waitress getup in her Crazy video to the local newspaper after Lennon's death.
-The music, of course! I feel pretty odd commenting on this obvious aspect, but the music was loud enough for me and not too loud for my parents.
-$4 for my Groupie Grind! Recommended to me by my waitress. Pina colada mix with mango and strawberry puree. MMMMmmmmm...Oh, for some odd reason there were no prices on the drink menu. I was surprised when I saw the check that my fabulous slushie was just $4 and my mom's fountain drink (I think she got Sierra Mist) was something like $3.50. Moral of the story: Treat yourself to a special drink!
-Beer battered Fish n Chips. I don't even like fish, but it was so darn crispy that we all stole some of mom's food.

Just OK:
-Cobb salad. A typical and ordinary Cobb salad. Enough to fill me up, but didn't leave me feeling overstuffed. IMO, a good dish if you're not famished and you want to leave a little room to try other foods. I was also eyeing the Anti-Cobb, so maybe I'll try that next time.

Cons:
-They make you take a picture with a drum set and guitars when you come in. Fun if you're going with friends, awkward when you're there with your already uncomfortable Asian parents.

Overall:
Great service, great atmosphere, good prices and generous portions. If you're stuck on The Strip, this is one of your better options for food.",dGMZdcbYbCeQpkP2ZaLB3g,0,0,5,A-M1t4xUG7rn9pw7j00MhQ

While it's impressive in theory, the more interesting and fun techie toy we found was just in the waiting area. It was a table top touch screen, reminiscent of the old pac-man tables often found in restaurants during the 80s/90s, but WAY MORE AWESOME... er, well, those were pretty sweet too. 

I'm drifting...

So the interactive rock wall has random images of memorabilia floating around which you can drag and touch click and enlarge... and is quite large, with basically 6 docking stations for 6 users to peruse the floating options. However, the table top touch screens had a search feature so you could choose whose junk you got to look at. We immediately searched for the Boss's items in the collection, enjoying the i-whatever type technology that allowed us to pinch and spread our fingers on the screen to zoom in and out and read old setlists and the like. 

Fun times for music geeks.

I believe these are the same kinds of screens we saw in the booths, but our table didn't have one to play with... so if you want to enjoy that part of the place, ask specifically to sit near one! 

Oh yeah and as far as the food went, it was fine, just as at all Hard Rocks, although I give extra props to the waitress who noticed me order my veggie burger without cheese and asked if I was vegan.

**Side note, vegans, don't plan to eat here. There's really nothing for you. That veggie burger had cheese in it, and I was so grateful that she let me know!!!

For those of you wondering, you can execute a review for the venue (Hard Rock Live as of 2013) for itself here: http://www.yelp.com/biz/hard-rock-live-las-vegas. 

The Hard Rock Cafe comprises three levels directly across from Monte Carlo's Diablo's Cantina on the strip. First floor is a merch store and box office (for HRL); second floor is the restaurant/bar; and, the third floor is a venue/bar known now as Hard Rock Live. There is memorabilia on all three floors. 

This review will strictly be for the restaurant -- being that I have never purchased any merch -- and, the venue has its own listing where one can leave a rating (mine: 3 ). So here goes ...

Food is just alright; and the view is nice if you get seated with one. I have had salads (monstrous in size); burgers (usually cooked to the incorrect specified temperature [charred like a motherfucker]); and, fries (just fries: nothing special). In fact, the entire restaurant can be summed up to just that: Nothing Special. 

Pro Tip: there is usually a coupon for money off of one's cheque in those Vegas2Go magazines found all around the strip corridor. They are small (brochure-sized) and red and white. - E",KtIh1kjkVESCqd2CCsQnhA,2,1,2,5cIP0UHVAaOexEisa1moZA

It was pretty cool to see the memorabilia and some of the crazy outfits celebrities have worn over the years, but I wasn't as blown away as I had expected.
 
The food was pretty good but the service was.. How do I put it... Weird? We were greeted by a younger waiter who we could tell was a little bit nervous. I guess he was in training and the lady training him was standing directly behind him. He was trying so hard but every so often she would correct him on the spot or offer us something he hadn't mentioned. We felt so bad for him because you could tell how hard he was trying and she made him look like he kept messing up. I felt so bad for the guy, that's not a good way to train employees in my opinion. After they leave the table she could have offered suggestions for improvement not correct him on the spot, that doesn't promote confidence. Before we were done eating the guy stopped by our table to say goodbye and that they were sending him home. The lady that was training him came over shortly afterward to say that he had to go home and it wasn't because of anything he did wrong. HOW AWKWARD!

4026449,2014-09-27,0,1CR2ddUcjYYwRd5JLtiRrw,"My buddies and I were looking for breakfast outside of our hotel after putting back a few drinks the night before. We were going to hit the Denny's on the Strip, but the line was absurdly long and we had to be somewhere later that morning, so we popped into the Hard Rock Cafe since we saw that they had a breakfast menu.

We went upstairs to the restaurant and were promptly seated out on the patio which has a great view of the Strip. It was another gorgeous day in Vegas and the sun was starting to really heat things up.

We started the meal off in a very manly way - mimosas and cocktails. I wasn't originally going to get a big breakfast, but the chicken and biscuits were too tempting. 

A short wait later, our food arrived and it was apparent that the kitchen just thought I had ordered a biscuits and gravy as my chicken was quite absent. After waving down a waiter, he said he would take it back to the kitchen and get the chicken. Unfortunately, fried chicken isn't the quickest thing to get done on the fly, so by the time my plate came back, my friends were already done eating. Our waitress was great though, and was actually getting ticked off that the food was taking so long to come back. 

When it did finally arrive, it looked quite good with a good-sized piece of chicken on two country gravy-slathered biscuits. The golden brown batter was nice and crunchy, although the boneless chicken breast had a texture suggesting that it came from a freezer. The gravy was rich and hearty but the biscuits weren't so much the dense but flaky texture of a good biscuit, but closer to that of cake. It was odd. Not bad, just odd.

My buddy whose birthday it was received a complimentary birthday sundae and a free glass as well, which was really cool, and the waitress knocked $5 off our bill for all the hassle. All in all, she was a champ.

The food was kinda meh, but its a great location and the front end service was spot on. Swing on by, just not for the  biscuits.",zyaQNsI73cLOKttvGnj4bw,0,0,3,cfMvhxkP8xXVGTPKDZqqqA
4051982,2010-07-25,0,1CR2ddUcjYYwRd5JLtiRrw,"I decided to give the Hard Rock Cafe another try, this time we just went in for dinner before going to a concert. I made a reservation for 6:30 and this time, we took a cab from our hotel so the lack of free, easy to access parking was a non-factor.

Upon arrival we headed up the escalator and was greated by a photographer. She handed me a guitar, we struck some rockstar poses while she snapped a couple shots. Then it was off to get seated.   Our hostess was friendly and tried to make small talk while she took us to our table. The eating area of the Hard Rock Cafe was almost identical to the club area, which is one floor up. The only differences I saw were the additional tables, and different memorabilia. 

Our waitress was friendly and we were able to place orders for drinks quickly after being seated. My husband decided to order the pulled pork and ribs combo plate, I had a sirloin steak. When we ordered, the waitress gave him a choice in the sauces for the pulled pork, he went with vinegar.

After placing our food order, someone came by with the photo that had been taken when we entered. $20 later we had a 5x7 in a simple, touristy frame and 2 smaller photos. Pretty gimmicky but a nice way to remember the evening.

Food was brought out promptly. Not too fast but fast enough. I tried a little of the pulled pork, I was glad my husband went with the vinegar based sauce. Very tasty. He seemed to really enjoy the ribs as well.  My steak was fine, nothing exceptional.  I really did like that it was served with snap peas though.

4090628,2015-04-10,2,1CR2ddUcjYYwRd5JLtiRrw,"I'll start by saying the service in Las Vegas restaurants (particularly on the Strip) seem to have one common theme - POOR SERVICE

The Hard Rock Cafe is no exception to this observation. 

I get it. You work in a tourist trap. You get mixed (good and bad) tips regardless of effort because you are serving people from different cultures and different tipping beliefs, but that shouldn't mean you just disappear. 

This week my girlfriend and I met up for lunch with a couple of friends that happened to also be visiting Vegas. We tried to get them to choose a non-chain, but they argued that they knew what to expect with a chain. Fine... Hard Rock it was. 

We walked in, walked up the stairs, put our name down. The place was basically empty since it was about 2:00 p.m., so we were seated in about 5 minutes. This is where the service begins and ends. 

We sat there with menus for 15 minutes (this is no exaggeration) . We flagged down several people and asked them if they could find a server for us, but instead they just kept walking by obnoxiously singing along with the music playing in the background (or in some cases, just shouting out lyrics to unrelated songs). I THINK the servers think this is 'entertaining', but I can tell you that none of us at our table were impressed - especially after waiting that long. 

Once the waiter arrived (sweating), he apologized profusely, feeding us with several disjunct reasons. We presented him with 2 for 1 drink cards that were distributed by the people standing in front of the restaurant. He seemed to be clueless as to their validity. He ran back to his manager and came back confirming the 'deal'. We were debating on whether or not this waiter was drunk, as he just seemed disconnected.

Anyway... We ordered our food. It was what you expect from any chain restaurant like this, fairly bland, generic, etc. If you are not familiar with Hard Rock Cafe, it is basically a TGIFriday or Chili's with a Rock-n-Roll theme (walls covered in rock memorabilia). Needless to say, you are paying for the ambiance and to look at the rock memorabilia, not the food. Once you wrap your head around that, the prices are... well... still too high for what you get.

I would suggest avoiding all of the 'sit-down' restaurants that have doors that open to the Strip. They have a non-stop line of customers coming in, so they know they don't need to work hard. As for the Hard Rock Cafe, I would just avoid it regardless of the country you are in. This is a relic from the 70s and 80s that just doesn't know when it is time to close the doors.",6yCPuw82xoJ75y1r47wH0g,3,0,1,qmkRyGDQ6EUeJmZTxeO7yg

The third floor venue is a bit of a hike for a lazy bum like me.  I took the stairs though there is an optional elevator.  I was concered how the concert was going to be pulled off given the nature of the act.  I saw GWAR, a group known for eleborate stage shows that saturate the audience, floor and surrounding areas with a red simulated blood and green slime.  I noticed when I walked in the memorabilia walls and support columns were wrapped in plastic sheets.  Smart move.  Security was tight upon entering.  Everybody had to take everything out of their pockets and get patted down and wanded.  It took a while (think busy airport) but I felt safe.  During the show security guards were taking down crowd surfing drunks.  It was entertaining.  Over all, the concert venue at the Hard Rock is like a bigger, cleaner and more modern looking version of the House of Blues at Mandalay Bay.  They have very similar set ups.  Down side of the eveing, the cheapest beer was PBR for $5.  That is a lot to pay for a pint of PBR.  That complaint aside, I had a great time for a great price (ticket cost).

The food is pretty consistent, and they have good options for those with dietary restrictions. 

As a local, I found the staff to be very accommodating to both locals and tourists. I witnessed the staff giving genuine recommendations to tourists, and joking around with the occasional local that stops by. 

Beyond the typical HRC experience, I've been very impressed with the concert venue on the top floor. I've seen both international acts and local acts in the concert hall. During concerts the venue is very intimate, and there is not a bad seat (mostly standing room, but you get the idea) in the house save the area behind the bar that overlooks the strip. 

The sound is good, not the best I've seen, but for the type of venue it is more than adequate. 

I look forward to concerts at the HRC because the parking is easy (just park in the Showcase mall, you have to pay, but it is worth it), and you can always see the band.

Host was very happy to change our tables - no fuss!!! Our server (Star of the whole experience) Ashley came and took our order for beverages.  She even helped us with couple of items in menu and recommeded sauc for my chicken - which happeded to be the best choice.  My daughter was bit upset for somereason and was crying.  Ashley took a note of that but didnt say anything.  Our food came and it was awesome except my daughter didn't like the Pizza she ordered.  She told Ashley when she came to check on us....She took the Pizza off of our check! At the end of our lunch, Ashley said that she has a surprise for my daughter and brought a cup of ice-cream!!! Put a big smile on her (my daughter's) face.... Ashley saved the day for us....She even took a pin (Disney pin) out of her pin belt and gifted to my daughter.  She went above and beyond to make our dining experience awesome and she did that.

The greeter asked how many in our party. I said 3 and they said ok we will put you in the back. Didn't understand why we were being buried in the back and I felt somewhat insulted. Not worried about it because I will never go here again. This is why I am writing this to make sure that none of my friends or fellow yelpers get hosed like I did. It gets better so please read on. 

Shortly after being seated our waiter Larry showed up and seemed very nice. My wife ordered a water, my daughter ordered a pink lemonade and I ordered a Guinness. Larry was slick with pressuring my wife to order a frozen drink. I noticed that on the menu you could ask the waiter about purchasing a pint glass or a hurricane glass for an additional fee. we were never offered if we even wanted to purchase the glasses. Larry decided that we needed them. When I ordered my meal I ordered The Texan. I ate the meal and it was not that bad. Larry was helpful and courteous. Then I got the bill and found that I was charged the 17.50 super sized price for the meal vs the 13.50 price that I noticed was on the menu. I didn't ask nor was I offered the super sized meal for the 17.50 price. Larry was slick again and had gotten over on me. I had not noticed anything at this point on the check. Larry tried to get us to have dessert but we passed on it. Larry had asked me to do a customer survey as he gets great feedback from his job. I assured him that I would give him feedback. He also sat at our table and tried to explain something else to us about a menu item that was not on our table. we declined to have it and Larry said I just had to tell you about it because I always forget.

This Larry guy basically got over on us and made us pay for things that we really didn't want. I could have gone back up stairs and made a scene but I figured I would just tell everyone what they did to me and hope that no one else gets taken. I WILL NEVER GO THERE AGAIN!!! I am sure that his company makes him do these things to people and this is why you must go down stairs to pay for your meal. They are a sneaky and they got me this once. Never again!!

4506899,2012-07-18,0,1CR2ddUcjYYwRd5JLtiRrw,"This place was a ghost town on a Saturday afternoon. At least, it seemed like it to me. Any other Hard Rock I've been to, it's a wait for a table. It looked like the balcony/patio seating was pretty busy, though, I will definitely check that out the next time I go.

We sat at the high-tops in the bar area and ordered a round of drinks while perusing the menu. We were both pretty hungry, but debated splitting a plate after looking over the prices. Now, Hard Rock has always been a pretty pricey eatery, but I guess when in Vegas you think, ""I could get like, two drinks for the price of that hamburger."" I ordered a bloody mary (gin) and my friend ordered a specialty drink that came in a souvenir glass. I knew before the check came that her drink would be at least $15. 

And I was right. My well gin bloody mary was about $7 while her floofy tanning-lotion reminiscent bath water cost her double. Here's a tip: never assume the server is trying to get you to order what they like best, they are trying to UPSELL. They will want to sell you the most expensive thing on the menu. 

Our server had a bit of an attitude when he messed up my bloody mary but hey, I used to be a server and I know I was within my rights. Fix it. I'm not drinking vodka. We left within about 20 minutes to find a cheaper place to eat.

One cool note, however, a manager was making rounds asking guests where they were from and taking msuic video requests. I requested Cinderella and my friend Journey and both were played prior to our departure. What a cool idea!

I would think that Hard Rock would be more.... Hard Rock. It seems like this place has gotten a little soft. Where's the rock'n'roll, the tattoos, the black hair, the leather and lace? Perhaps I need to come back at night, when the Disneyland families with their porkchop kids are safely tucked in to their beds at Circus Circus.",InLqIX5bb2M7H724adkYVg,0,0,3,odk89pWt60h-iyzsUvxODA

4620316,2010-11-20,6,1CR2ddUcjYYwRd5JLtiRrw,"HRC. No, not Hillary Rodham Clinton. Not Human Rights Campaign. Hard Rock Cafe!

I've been here on two occasions - once for the grand opening and again last weekend for the Motley Brews craft beer festival. I haven't had a chance to actually eat in the cafe yet, so this review is purely for the building as a venue.

It's actually a pretty impressive spot. The bottom floor is the gift shop. If you're a Hard Rock junkie, I'm sure you'll find something to take home with you. The second floor is where the actual cafe resides.  It has a nice size with a balcony that overlooks the strip. In the waiting area are Microsoft Surface tables where you can play around with music-related trivia and activities.

The third floor houses a small museum, a bar, and a stage area for small concerts. During the grand opening, I got to see Chris Cornell perform. This is also where the Motley Brews event occurred. It's a nice open space for these types of events. It also has a balcony overlooking the strip.

I think it's a little strange that we now have two Hard Rock Cafes and one Hotel in Vegas. I haven't been to the other cafe in about 17 years, but I can only imagine that this new one blows that one away. Then again, if you're a Hard Rock junkie (like a few people we met at the grand opening), you'll visit and appreciate both places.

Overall, this is a good addition to the strip.",YwaKGmRNnSa3R3N4Hf9jLw,4,4,4,U4rP8K1YkQwq55BF_c3Kug

The service was AWFUL. Just awful. We were seated in the middle of the room and while it was somewhat busy, we seemed to be sitting at the Invisible Table. It took forever to get menus or water. We sat and watched as all the other tables that were seated after us got service. Annoying. But we weren't angry yet.

A waitress from another table came by and asked if our waitress had helped us yet. We said no and she was nice enough to get things started (menus, water). Again it took forever to put our order in. They screwed it up--we asked for mayo and they never brought it. After waiting, I flagged down a bus boy and asked him.

The entire process took over an hour and a half. I finally flagged some random waiter down and asked for our bill.

We were asked to finish our yardsticks before we were seated, so he hung out with us before showing us to our table.  Being from Portland, we had to explain to him that the show ""Portlandia"" is based off of how Portland really is, versus just silly jokes.  And since Vegas is such a tourist spot, we totally dig being asked where we're from and the person that asked RELATING versus just saying, ""Cool"" or something else to the degree of ""we don't care, we're just paid to ask.""

Anyways, he seriously made our night. He was geniunely friendly, and just such a fun way to start off the meal.

The service was very attentive and friendly, I hope they are like that no matter the group size.

Honestly, I normally wouldn't come to a chain in Vegas.... but this was the Yelp Spring Break headquarters and we were enticed by the $10 lunch menu for us. Since we were checking in here anyway, we decided to check it out. 

- Hickory Smoked Pork Belly Sliders - They were decent, but the bread/filling ratio was off and I thought the pork was much much too sweet. Still tasty though. 
- Braised Short Rib Tacos - My favorite! Great combination of flavors, perfect short ribs, and the dipping sauces were a great match. 
- Nacho Mama Fried Jalapenos - We were warned they would be spicy, but they were overwhelmingly so! I loved the crispiness and the way they were loaded with cream cheese, but I can usually handle spicy and couldn't handle much more than a few bites of these. 
- Twisted Mac and Cheese - This wasn't on the Yelp menu, but who can resist mac and cheese? This one was a little different, with buffalo sauce added (which I wouldn't have been able to tell, had we not been told). It gave it an extra interesting little kick, and the dish was creamy, cheesy, and gooey, they way it should be. 

The dishes were more tapas style/samplers than the lunch specials advertised, but it was still cool to check out a place that none of us had been to. The free drink tickets from Yelp made it more than worthwhile too.... our Bacardi Torched Cherry cocktails were refreshing and strong. 

Michael was personable, hilarious, and enthusiastic. He really wanted us to enjoy our whole experience there, and he was beyond great. He gave some great drink recommendations to my drinking-partner-and-crime and I: their version of a Long Island and another SoCo-based sweet drink. Both highly recommended. 

Would I come back? Hard Rock was an excellent sponsor and host for our event, and a great atmosphere to get the party started. The fantastic service would bring me back, and also my discovery of the patio...... the front of the dining area is a huge, shaded patio with a view of the whole Strip and Bellagio fountains.

4960194,2012-10-30,1,1CR2ddUcjYYwRd5JLtiRrw,"Yes, there are now TWO Hard Rock Cafes in Vegas. The original Paradise/Harmon location (which is in front of the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino), and this one, which is on the Las Vegas Strip itself. 

If you are not familiar with the Hard Rock Cafe chain of restaurants, you have clearly been living under a rock for the past few decades. Essentially, they combine great food and tons of awesome musical memorabilia and the like on display. These places are a music fan's dream come true. 

The Hard Rock Cafe on the Strip is unique because it is set up in a 3-story arrangement. The first floor and main entrance is the gift shop. The second floor is the Hard Rock Cafe restaurant itself. And the third floor is a bar/concert venue. 

As far as the concert venue goes, this place is excellent. I went in here for the first time the other night to see Dio Disciples, and the size of the venue is just right. It is intimate, but still manages to fit a ton of music fans. Plus the sound quality is excellent. You can stand by the stage, or go to the bar or a table/chair to sit down, so you'll be well off either way. There is even a balcony with a kick-ass view of the Strip exterior.

Most of my complaints with the place stem from the entrance/location/lines for shows/etc. Being on the Las Vegas Strip, just getting to the associated Showcase Mall parking garage can be a challenge (it costs $3 to park in this garage, but it is far and above your best option.) Finding the garage is tricky because the signs directing you there are so small and easy to miss. Likewise, to get into the show, we had to wait in a line, and the line actually went up a flight of stairs. Traversing stairs is fine, but being forced to wait on them in a crowd for long periods of time is not pleasant. Also, expect the full ""being carded/pat down/metal detector"" treatment. 

But all things considered, once you find the parking garage and a show that you want to go to, or even if you're just wandering the Strip and want to shop and eat, this place is great. Definitely worth your time, whether you're a local or a tourist.",qnJEn88UBRXh8kTCggNOWQ,1,0,4,h2kXIlbT7zzopBOEKr8qYQ

Mit dem Hard-Rock-Café kann man nicht viel falsch machen... Wir waren zum Frühstück da und es fiel zumindest mir sehr schwer, etwas herauszusuchen, bei dem ich nicht ins Zuckerkoma falle oder platze. Wenig gibt es nicht.
Eine belgische Waffel mit Schlagsahne und Erdbeeren klingt lecker. Zum Kaffee. Aber nicht als erstes Mahl des Tages. Zumindest nicht für jemanden wie mich, der daheim in Deutschland gar nicht frühstückt. Ich entschied mich für ein Roggen-Sandwich mit dünnem Rindfleisch. Das war auch wahnsinnig lecker, die Hash Browns daneben waren für mich persönlich vollkommen überflüssig. Um uns kümmerten sich drei Kellnerinnen, die verblüffenderweise alle falsche Wimpern trugen und eine damit fast erschlugen. Trotz der noch frühen Tageszeit (ca. 9 Uhr, da schläft man in LV eigentlich noch seinen Rausch aus), hatten wir auf der Außenterrasse Livemusik, die Sängerin war klasse. Der Ausblick ist toll. 
Nur wenn man abends vorbei geht, finde ich es nervig. Aus Boxen plärrt die Musik es gibt extra einen DJ. Nur den Tontechniker hätte man auch noch investieren sollen, da alles völlig übersteuert und verzerrt klingt. Dabei stehen dann Mädels, die wie Cheerleader angezogen sind und animieren einen lauthals, ins Cafe zu kommen. Der Anblick der Außenfassade ist zumindest von der anderen Seite des Strips bei Nacht imponierend. Warum drei Sterne? Weil es ein Hard Rock Cafe ist, dass es überall sonstwo auch gibt :)

There's not too much that can go wrong when choosing a Hard Rock Cafe. We had breakfast there and personally, I had difficulties finding something in the menu that would not catapult me into a diabetic coma or makes me explode all over the place. Small portions don't exist here.
A Belgian waffle with whipped cream and strawberries sounds great - for an afternoon coffee. But not for the meal I begin my day with. At least for someone like me who always skips breakfast. I decided to take a rye sandwich with roast beef... It was really good, the hash browns as a side being completely unnecessary (I know, Americans luv it though). We had at least three waitresses caring for us, all of them astonishingly had false lashes which almost struck us dead :) Despite the early hour (about 9 am, you should usually sleep off your hangover in LV) we had live music on the balcony. The singer was awesome. The view is amazing.
Only if you pass by at night, I think it's rather annoying. Loud music blares from speakers, there's even a DJ. Why on earth didn't they invest in a sound engineer as well? Everything sounds distorted and overloaded. Next to the DJ are girls dressed as cheerleaders trying to whine you into entering the cafe. The view from the other side of the Strip on the facade is impressive at night. Why there's only 3 stars? Because it's a Hard Roc Cafe that you can find anywhere else :)",U9dEFm_cvhCEPe9i_TlnFw,1,0,3,DLiMnIvmujSGMZIv07R63A

So I was with a friend and knower this location was still open and around the corner from movie theater in which we were planning on going to after lunch. Missy was our server. She didn't really seem to care about my order and rushed me very quickly thru my very specific order. I do have dietary restrictions and those need to be requested not disrespected or ignored. I was in a pardy of 2 and asked to be seated outside. The furniture needs to be replaced cus it looks like the chairs are covered with bird poop. When ordering my cauliflower burger I specifically asked for everything on the side and raw. This means everything. Also when even asked for extra onions it was like a total inconvenience me god forbid that I asked what kind of fries it comes with. Just trying to communicate with her was a burden. The burger as pictured cam the way it did, and not together when trying to move it. When arrived the cheese was mysteriously melted and the look on my face was not good. If she cared at all she would have a nice it back before delivering food, but did not. I was disappointed and told running server who corrected the situation. When mentioned to Missy what was wrong she looked at me and said Oh good and walked away. My friend sitting across from me was dumbfounded at the odd answer. 
   The melted cheese looks so nasty like human waist and it was melted into burger, ripping the burger as pictured. I even mentioned I was not happy with the way the sandwich came out and told her the running is taking care of issue and got the odd answer. She's more like a truck driver and no customer service.

I've made plenty of trips to Vegas through my years but this was my 1st & 2nd time going to this Hard Rock Cafe within two days over this past weekend.

We had the pleasure of having some of the best bartenders Vegas has ever seen during our visit. We were greeted right away from the badazz himself, Kyle! What a great guy. A friend of ours wanted to by us a shot but did not know what to buy specifically. Kyle made a very unique suggestion which was a great one in my books. I have heard of this shot before in the past but never attempted to have it up until this past weekend. He suggested ""Dead Nazi's"". Yes, it's a real shot! After that great shot, we asked for another recommendation in which he was more than happy to do so. He suggested ""Sex with an alligator"" and yes, this is another true shot! Kyle had Woody set up this next shot with us which was a great addition to the very unique line of shots. Woody kicked A$$ as well and gave us some pointers about what we were having. These guys rock!

You may think I am making this all up but trust me I'm not. No one in Hollywood could make this up!

I apologize in advanced for not adding the blonde female bartender who I thought had an accent for some reason. She said she had a heavy tongue when it came to pronunciation. She was very dope and took care of us on day one of our visit. Rock on!!

I've been here before for a Yelp elite event and Motley Brews, but I caught a show ( ill.gates - church of bass) here recently. 

This HRC is one level retail, second a restaurant and the third floor is a music venue. I  like that it's a decent sized but still intimate. There's a large patio if you want some air as well which has a nice view of the whole strip. I am a old crab and in the back by the bar is a raised area with seating. I can't do this whole standing and squashed onto people type business anymore so when there is seating, I am way more happy. Sound is pretty good in here but depends on the setup can get loud in a small space. 

It was a fairly decent place for a beer fest, given that it wasn't too busy but this can be a clusterfuck if it was double the amount of people. 

Overall, good non club venue for music.

They seated us quickly which was nice since the place looked pretty busy for a tuesday afternoon.

I ordered the simple burger which was good, we got a LOT of fries as well, i couldnt finish my meal.

While I suggested we eat before the show, he wanted to come here in the wee hours for the evening energy!  This time, we returned with 2 friends!

I was excited to find that for a limited time they offered menu items from tons of other HRC so I tried the burger that came with pineapple and spam.  It was SO delicious and juicy and the spam was a perfect accent, not overpowering!  My son got his usual pulled pork sandwich, and my daughter her usual child's chicken strips (in the electric guitar plate).  Our friends got a few appetizers and a salad.  While I didn't taste theirs, they looked and smelled amazing!

Our  Three Thumb Review is two and a half thumbs up!  I loved the opportunity to share the evening with friends in a big comfy booth (But I gave it 1/2 a thumb less because our water disappeared after our order was taken.  It was kinda busy that night, but still...). My teen son loved the consistently delicious food and rockin' atmosphere. My tween daughter still thinks that HRC has the best kids menu for eating and for playing with!

The ambiance is outstanding, as is the sound system, but the quality of the food left quite a bit to be desired.  I visited with my wife.  She ordered a BBQ plate and I ordered the New York strip steak ($27.95).  While my wife's meal came out fine, mine was barely warm.  The mashed potatoes were cold and stiff, the gravy congealed and the green beans cold and hard.  I normally don't send food back because I've heard all of the horror stories, but I couldn't stand the thought of paying this much for a barely tolerable meal, so back it went.  I will say that the server and management were spot on though -- the server apparently notified the manager who came to my table to apologize and offered me a salad to keep me busy while waiting for a new meal.  When the 2nd meal arrived, it was much better.  The cut of beef was not quite as tender as I'd like for a N.Y. strip, but it had good flavor.  I just wish that there was an option for a baked potato rather than mashed potatoes, but alas - there were no baked potatoes to be found on the menu.  All in all, dinner came out to a little over $70 for two -- but the ambiance made up for what the food quality lacked.

We've been to a few, but yet, none have been able to stand up to those first original amazing nachos. So when we decided to drive up to Tahoe to go to the hard rock café there's only one thing on our minds, trying the nachos. When we got to the restaurant we checked out the menu and only found one, sadly, nacho option.

After discussing our dilemma with the waitress, she suggested that we add some shredded pork to our nacho order. We thought it over for about two seconds and decided that was a great idea. Our nachos came and they were great. Were they as great as though nachos we had in Las Vegas? No. But they were still really good and totally worth the drive.

you know, there is one sad aspect to this review, our waitress told us that in about six weeks the hard rock café found in Harrah's Lake Tahoe is going to be closing down. There are rumors that it's going to be moving over to the now Lake Tahoe hard rock hotel but even our waitress did not know if that was going to actually happen.

Our whole flight home we were throwing up and felt awful. I called the manager the next day to explain the issue but he was completely defensive saying no one else had that issue. Which is fine.

So I got my pin fix. 
What was a little disappointing was they didn't have the shot glass that we wanted.
Strange. 
Always thought the shot glasses and T-shirts were their best sellers? Maybe not.

I also stopped upstairs to the cafe at 11am to try and use my Yelp drink ticket. 
Going upstairs, the hostesses did not greet and it took a bit of time to find a server but I ended up talking to the bartender who, after asking, told me the tickets were invalid on Sunday. I guess that was my bad. 
I don't know if I just came too early on the lack of service but hopefully it will be better next time I'm in town.

This place brings me back to the days in high school when it was so cool to be seen wearing a HRC t-shirt.  Of course, growing up in WNY, Orlando is the most popular place that families seem to vacation, .... so it seemed that almost everyone owned an Orlando HRC T-shirt. And boxer shorts. We were so cool.

But not my BFF. She scored a Las Vegas one, and I was secretly jealous.

Fifteen plus years later, and I had to have lunch here for memory's sake. The restaurant is rather large, and was pretty crowded for a late Saturday afternoon. A friend and I scored bar seats, and within a minute or two had the bartenders attention. The holiday drink menu looked intriguing, but when I asked his recommendation, he said he wasn't too impressed and could make me a fantastic raspberry martini, after a few questions as to what type of drinks I enjoyed. It was delish.

Our entrees (pulled pork and chix mac & cheese) were delivered rather quickly. Sizeable, yet manageable portions, and very tasty.

Overall a very positive experience. Enjoyed chatting with our bartender about the local MTB scene, and will have to return for another matini. Will probably not be purchasing any more T-shirts though. The coolness factor has worn off.",pmLN-OB3RXZ1eGmp90yqVw,2,2,4,u41VBUE5jTmSkSf7SITODQ

My fiancee cashed in on her free cocktail, and we ordered the ten dollar specials. One was the Hickory Smoked Pork Belly Sliders(3) with Tomatillo Jam, Micro Cilantro and the other was the Braised Short Rib Tacos(3) with Frenso & Corn Slaw, Cilantro Lime Aoili. Both sounded pretty good.

The cocktail was super weak. I get Asian glow easily and this cocktail did nothing to me. Maybe because it was free? As for the sliders, I actually did enjoy them, though the jam was a bit on the sweet side. We just used some of the guacamole from the taco dish and it made the sliders amazing, haha. As for the tacos, they're just standard tacos. Not bad at all, but not amazing.

Service was a bit too... perky for my tastes. Waitress was definitely nice, but I can only handle so much bubbliness. Probably awesome if you're bringing a family here, though, so not factoring it into my rating.

The second time? I don't think I will ever go back.

Yes, she was nice and ok as a waitress I guess...but once it came to the bill, it said ""We added an 18% optional tip for your convenience"". The tip was going to be 25 dollars...we decided 15 would be good enough.

As we left, she ran after us saying we ""were a bit shy"" from the amount due, We gladly pointed out that the tip was optional, but it seems Ms. Amy was NOT happy about it. ""I aim for 20%"" That's fine, but you didn't get it. She got mad and said she needed to talk to the manager before we left. This got us very angry, because she treated us like thieves or something.  She then came back 10 mins later saying ""We can go"". Well, if I would have known she'd be pissy about a tip I'd have taken the tip back.",vaeMVd-ezal30ZsWN-OL-Q,7,0,2,2VabJykCiTDNNyjUaeRoiA

The staff is friendly and prices aren't horrible.  My only knock is that this place is obviously marketed towards tourists, based on it's location alone.  They don't really have their own parking, so if you are a local and going to a show, you could park at the Showcase Theater garage, or across the street at Monte Carlo.  Even the MGM garage isn't too far of a walk, but none are particularly convenient.

This Hard Rock really has the best Rock 'n' Roll Memorabilia! While we didnt check any out they have shows as well. If you in Vegas and any kind of a music fan, which I am sure you are, check out this Hard Rock.",ulHMcirOj_xRV9GkGV2HRA,1,0,5,z_Jme0RqR1XoEh6BnScuXg

Enjoyed my lunch very much at the bar, watching music rock videos of all eras.

The service was very pleasant too.

5837437,2012-05-30,2,1CR2ddUcjYYwRd5JLtiRrw,"Before standing at the ready to greet and assist fellow Yelpers registering for Spring Break, I enjoyed my first lunch inside the Hard Rock Cafe on The Strip.  It has less rock memorabilia on its walls than the HRC adjacent to the Hard Rock Hotel on Paradise, but is more elegant, plus features a dynamite second level patio overlooking other Strip properties, and a large third floor suitable for concerts.

But I was here to try the vaunted HRC hamburger, and was not let down by the 6 oz. Classic Burger with bacon and Cheddar Cheese added, and accompanying fries.  This was the small variety of burger, but it was large enough for me.  

Although it took awhile to get made medium rare as ordered, once my sandwich arrived it was a fine burger.  Deconstructing its contents, it consisted of cold pickle chips, a good slice of ripe red tomato, green leafy lettuce, Red Onion circles, a warm charbroiled hamburger patty, a soft bready bun, very tasty bacon, and nicely melted orange Cheddar Cheese.  The fries were neither thin nor fat, and tasted just fine with the juicy Bacon Cheeseburger.  Service was friendly and professional.

It was an enjoyable lunch in a very cool setting, and I look forward to a return visit.",s2o_JsABvrZVm_T03qrBUw,2,2,4,FKWt7f2YMRH9JmACzhxrJw

5930110,2010-02-05,0,1CR2ddUcjYYwRd5JLtiRrw,"I attended a hosted Las Vegas Meetings and Events Winter party here on the third level here last night. 

I was very impressed from the moment I walked in with how friendly the greeters/hostesses were to the servers and bartenders. On the strip sometimes it's hit or miss with encountering service people who actually act like they love their job. 

If you had the privilege of seeing the previous Hard Rock Cafe this one just blows the old one out of the water! Very spacious and spread out, on the third level which is where I spent my evening is a nice sized stage and dancing area, with tables around the outside rim if you wanted to sit and listen to the music. Upstairs (and on the 2nd level) they also have an outside patio overlooking the strip. Inside is typical bar and dinner seating, as well as a section of secluded lounge chairs. (They have these little loungey areas on the second level too.) The tables around the couches act as a touch computer screen where you can play videos and flip through photos all with the touch of your finger!

Since the event was hosted, I can't comment on cost or really the food, as they just had passed h'ordeuvres. Everything was fried, which is OK, but I know they were trying to feed the masses and those items were probably the cheapest. 

I tried the coconut shrimp, pot stickers and egg rolls, not much to say, they didn't have any flare or kick to them that would make them stand out from any other bar, but having eaten at Hard Rock's across the country I know they always do a solid American Cuisine- Love the there veggie burger! 

This would be a fun place to get a group together for a dinner party or birthday. Would definitely go back.",FOFKuCoclgR0zAlVe7i1Zg,1,2,4,MtAcX_0uPBXt8MZXRwrz0w

breakfast menu was pretty slim, maybe 5 or 6 options but the waitress said many of the normal menu items could be prepared if we asked. i ordered a standard breakfast for $10.85 - eggs, bacon, toast, and potatoes. everything was great minus the bacon - a crazy thick layer of pepper and salt covered it. totalllllly gross. bacon doesn't need seasoning! it's great on its own!

service was fine, food came out fast, and it was more reasonably priced than i expected. it's good if you're in a hurry to get on the road, but if you're not in a time crunch, i suggest heading over to the strip for an amazing brunch buffet instead.",xfOL8hHndEL7uJ-Pid9Cgg,2,1,3,OF9RiQfbecct9rY8ggpD9g
