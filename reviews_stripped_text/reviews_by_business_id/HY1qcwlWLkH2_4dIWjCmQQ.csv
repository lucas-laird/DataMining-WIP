The food has a lot of flavour. I went with the pad Thai and was not disappointed. The Thai tea tasted fresh.

Beef Jerky   B+  (not filet mignon, but sauce was absolutely amazing)
Basil Chicken A+ (Probably some of the best I've had, simple yet well done)
Yellow Curry with Shrimp  A (Shrimp were cooked just right)
Vegetarian Drunken Noodles B+  (Tofu was lacking, everything else excellent)

For Vegas, this is one of the few true Thai places that don't mix in other Asian influences.  Place only seats 14 people and most of the business that night was take out.

The restaurant is still building it's notoriety but let me tell you, it won't take long until the city comes around.

The service is great with friendly staff/chefs and the ordering process is quick and easy. Good for smaller groups or quick bite. We always have full bellies whenever we leave this place. Side note: If they offered frequent visit punch cards, we'd have a few lol

Whenever we go, I'd like to order their beef jerky (their sauce is DIVINE!) with sticky rice. We also like traditional Thai dishes so expect us feasting on Larb and Papaya Salad as well. So good!

The $6 Chicken Wings were spicy.  You are asked how hot you want them on a scale of 1 to 10.  I said 12.  It was a tolerable heat still able to taste the sweet honey on a well cooked wing.  More like drummets, 9 pieces was a good amount.

The $8 Tom Khai was very nice.  Lemon grass with coconut milk is such a good combination.  The chicken, although flat, was not a pleasant chew as I've come to know this dish.  Still tasteful.  Good to pour over rice.

Vegetable $7 Pad  See Eiw did not taste like any other Pad See Eiw I've had before.  Maybe  because this was the 1st time I've ordered a vegetable one instead of pork or chicken.  The taste was all right just not what I expected.  The noodles were good that's what makes this dish but the vegetables were a little over cooked.

$8 for the Ginger Garlic Pork was well worth it for this dish.  Love the garlic ginger taste combining the pork and vegetables.  This was put together nicely  and not over cooked.

To complete the order I added 2 $1.50 cokes and 1 $2.50 thai  ice tea.  Nobody took the thai ice tea so it was saved for the next day.  When we did decide to have it, in the late evening, it was still good.  And, that's an excellent price.

Overall I was happy with the meal.  It was delivered when everything was still hot.  It came in 35 minutes.  I also ordered this at 8:15pm, they close at 9pm, the lady was nice and pleasant taking my order.",h6aZg8OfwRnMVKloX7tBDA,19,18,4,GScNRiHpdrISbCbMaazvZQ
