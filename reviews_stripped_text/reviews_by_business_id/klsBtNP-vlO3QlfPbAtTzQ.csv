DB manager was TERRIBLE.  Who hired this guy to be a manager??????

The food was delicious and the waitress was amazing.  It's funny how one thing that goes wrong with a meal can say a lot about the establishment.  We ordered a sandwich to go and had placed it on the table with part of our party still chatting.  It was throw out when they cleaned the table and when we went to leave and take it we noticed it was gone.  We spoke to this manager about it and instead of seeing it was a legit grievance, he decided to tell us he would not replace or remove from the bill. When he finally decided to change his mind he had the kitchen make the worst half sandwich I've ever seen.  Terrible, very bad but he definitely showed us who's boss.  Thank you for eliminating this establishment from our morning after church outing Mr. Edwardo Rangel.",P3OMJLQg4c_gYLshya2bqg,1,0,1,0sFocXklA587BJGmCbseIQ

And the second thing I witnessed this guy doing he pick up the phone after it was ringing for what seemed like forever and said ""hi this is dennys on Craig we are on a 45 minute wait we are not doing to-go order and we do not do reservations"" and then hung right up on who ever was on the other end.

We roll up to this Denny's at about 3:30am.  I'll grant you, yes, it is 3:30am, I should wither my expectations.  Even with that in mind, I was still underwhelmed.  The big dip in this exp. was our server.  He was creepy, inattentive (hello, you have 2 tables, what's the deal?), and just plain awful.

My friends and I order our stuff- I got a slam burger (burger with egg and hashbrowns on it), and my friends get a lumber jack slam, and an ultimate omlette.  We started off with nacho cheese fries (they were chillie fries with sour cream and jalapenos basically).  When the order came up, they literally sat there for 5 minutes while our server proceeded to eat his own breakfast.

Our food comes out, maybe 15 minutes after that, and after we get our food, our server is gone for a good 20 minutes.  No follow up, no refills, just plain gone.  We seriously considered dine and dash after he was no where to be found for a good 10 minutes.

The kicker- their credit card machine was ""down"" so they only took cash.  Me thinks this guy was just pocketing the money.  Don't go to this Denny's late nite.

I asked again you can't substitute I'll pay the difference?? Again she said no I cannot without offering an alternative offering to out on the side.. a flat out no! I ended up asking for it on the side myself. My sister proceeds to place her order.. she asked for French toast was adamant on making sure the French toast wasn't soggy and asked for it to be extra pan fried.. she brought it out and was completely soggy did not apologize did not offer to bring out another.. we didn't get any refills.

The service wasn't bad, but the dishes are all super grimy. Every glass had a ring in it and the silverware was coated in a filmy substance, so that was thoroughly disgusting. After leaving cash (which included a generous tip) on the table, we sauntered out at a snail's pace and were paid no attention.

First of all, if we were trying to stiff you, don't you think we would have tried to leave a little faster? And second of all, he didn't even check to see if we had paid. I eat out VERY often and I don't appreciate being assumed to be somebody who would skip out on my bill. We definitely won't be back.

This visit fell short in many ways.  We were seated promptly, but that is where the promptness ended. 

We sat for quite a while before a server even came to the table to take drink orders. When she finally arrived, she was surprised that we wanted to order and wasn't prepared for that. When she brought the drinks out, she told the table next to us that they needed to exercise patience with her because she was brewing more coffee. Our coffee was cold and old and the $2.15 orange juice was much smaller than anticipated.

Although it took quite a while to get our meal, the food actually tasted OK and the country fried steak was in line with other Denny's locations. The downside here is that the food was cold just like the coffee was. 

You would think a Saturday morning at Denny's would feature piping hot coffee and quick hot meals. That was definitely not the case on this morning. Breakfast for two with coffee and orange juice for both was just south of $30. I think there are too many other breakfast options in the area for a return trip.",18xIAA444UuAWwEWiPCW-A,6,3,2,TbiJu9-_yTx8UhH0QdW1WQ

This morning Saturday, October 25th, 2014, myself and a group of 3 others visited your Denny's location in Las Vegas, NV at 12:20 am. (Address: 7071 W Craig Rd #101, Las Vegas, NV)

(12:20 AM) When walking in the door we were not greated, nor even aknoweledged. 

(12:30 AM) Only when another group of four walked in the door did the hostess come and take the group behind us to their table and left us standing at the doors.

(12:35 AM) We were finally asked the number of people in our group. At which time she said she would be back after clearing a table for us. 

(12:40 AM) We were seated and asked for our drink orders before we had our menus in hand. We asked her for waters so we could decide on drinks while she got the waters.

(1:15 AM) Another waitress, Irene, came by the table and asked us if we had ordered our drinks and we let her know we had asked for waters from the other girl and still had not recieved them 35 minutes since sitting down. She than took our drink orders - melted/watered down Iced coffee and said she would be back to get our meal order in a minute. And we did not get the waters we asked for 35 minutes before.

(1:30 AM) We stopped Irene to ask her if she could get us hot coffee instead because our previous mentioned Iced coffees were still sitting there full because they were very bad. She got us new coffees right then and again said she would be back to get our meal order in a minute.

(1:45 AM) She finally came to get our order taken. And, we told her that we needed a strawberry milkshake to go when we got our check in a styrophome cup.

(1:55 AM) Our food was made and left to sit in the plate warmer. Did not see either waitresses anywhere...

(2:15 AM) The cook comes out of the kitchen to take our plates out because they'd been up in the window for so long and not picken up - still no sign of the waitresses. He tries to hand them to the wrong table - who have been sitting there 30 minutes without their drinks even ordered.

(2:20 AM) Our food is placed on our table by the *no name tag* watress. The fries are cold. The toast is soggy. No drink re-fills and no water glasses still given. We asked for syrup and honey mustard.

(2:22 AM) She brought one honey mustard. And I asked again for syrup to which she scoffed and walked off..

(2:30 AM) Asked again for the other honey mustard and the syrup to which the *no name tag* replied: ""You are NEEDY."" than walked off and brought back only the syrup... Still no offers for drink refills on all of our empty cups.

(2:45 AM) We were all done eating. Drinks and plates all empty - besides the food we decided not to eat because it was too burnt or soggy or cold.

(3:00 AM) Irene came by and asked if we wanted our check. She than took our dirty plates and added them to the table behind ours stack of dirty plates from an hour before when the other table left.

(3:05 AM) Check was brought to the table and offered up our credit card to pay the bill.

(3:20 AM) Irene finally showed up with the paid check and credit card totalling $57.11 and asked for the tip part to be filled out and for it to be signed.

(3:22 AM) Irene came back to get the signed copy of the receipt and saw that she was left with a (generous -  in reference the service we received) 89 cent tip - making our total come to $58.00. She said ""I only get an 89 cent tip?"" to which I replied ""Yes, our service tonight between you and the other girl deserved that."" and she said, ""You think I was only worth 89 cents?"" and I said, ""Yes."" So she picked up the signed copy and the customer copy and stormed off..

(3:25 AM) We exited the door and left.",2hx2QhlFGOSPHEtYglgElA,3,0,1,G79mYOtlLeUZRdMysKaTlw

Denny's may not be a true retro-diner but I still get that diner feel from it.  From the stainless steel walls behind the bar to the 50's music I so dearly love.  And the food is not bad.  I don't believe food needs to be unique or gourmet to be good.  I ordered a mushroom swiss burger and it arrived at my table in just a few minutes.  It looked to be a hand formed patty.  It was not anything close to round and was falling apart a bit.  Perfect if you ask me.  It was like eating a home made burger.  It was big and filling.  My usual go-to if I find myself at Denny's.  Since it was Memorial Day and I was feeling good and relaxed, I ordered a hot fudge brownie a la mode.  Vanilla ice cream on it's own, no thank you.  But mix that scoop with some hot fudge and a warm brownie, aaaaahhhh.   So good.  

My service was good for the most part except for when my server disappeared for a few minutes.  No matter though, it gave me time to digest before ordering dessert.  When he was there he was very attentive and personable.  Being Memorial Day the restaurant was not at all busy.  The staff had no urgancy to get the customers in and out.  I was told I could stay as long as I wanted.  I never felt like cattle in a processing plant.  That is for sure.

Denny's has raised their prices a lot in recent years so it is not a go-to for a cheap sit-down experience anymore but it is still good.",eOIMO2wT_WbNqmavhnCRxw,3,2,4,gC1pjVjs9KJyr-hJPME9ZQ

Rueben is definately correct- they pocket the cash money.
unbelievable America. 

Here are the details:

So my husband, son, and I came in at 9pm on a Wednesday. We were the ONLY customers in the entire restaurant. I wasn't hungry and Jr. just ate.

We ordered : the sampler, an onion mushroom chop steak entree, an oreo shake, and a kids sundae. 

The waitress seemed nice enough.....making small talk.. complimenting about how cute my son was and how she had 5 kids(!) ...blah blah blah...

She said when we were ready she had our bill ready. 
We left a tip and went to pay.
!!! she said ""your total is 36.57"". !!
!! i was super shocked !!
! I paid her in 5's and 1's...and handed her the 37 bucks in loose cash. 
! she didn't even bother to re-count it and stuff it in the register without separating the cash.!
! I then said ""can i have the reciept"" (!)
and she started stuttering and stalled and talked BS. 
and i said "" it just seems like a lot when for the one entree we ordered.""
the BS waitress's excuses ""yeah it does"", ""the screen is cooperating"", ""i have to re-ring it"".. Whatever byotch just do whatever and gimme my reciept. 
So she finally prints it out and even points out our items.. and at the dam bottom it says $26.57!!
I confronted her and pointed out the total and  she automatically open the register and give me back my 10 when I started to  say "" It's 26 and I gave you 36""..she said 'oh, i owe you ten back"". (b4 even double-chking or counting anything)..man it was soooo scheme-ful!! 

To finally conclude my detailed yelp: the biyotch tried to stuff my 10 dollars in her own pocket. She knew what she was doing, what she said, and has obviously done this to many other customers. 
But she got caught. red handed. 

THATS SOOOO FREEAKKKEN SHADY SCHEMING WAITRESS!

Ugh I've never written a review let alone had such bad service that I had to write my first one. Such horrible service. Management, please train your servers to be better.",q7_X5bQdB2e6Ogp5XAVLsg,1,0,1,O_vZVyD1SwDlrBQEqsju8w

We both had Triple Bacon Samplers and the food was good. The new Lemon Rashberry was really good. The service was slow but I wasn't in hurry so, I didn't mind.",yfOThLCMhjoCn3AD8VmHoQ,1,0,3,My2g87fnJOUrNmgmg-DqBA

I was told by Irvin - (the general manager) they'd be ready on 10 minutes.. needless to say  - we were told there was NO ORDER PLACED upon arrival.. we waited 30 minutes for them to prepare a fresh batch of pancakes.. 

TODAY.. SAME THING!!! I call an order in with the same General Manager - IRVIN GREEN and he tells me the order will be ready in 10 minutes..  we get there and we are told there was NO ORDER PLACED.. 

This time, I decide to confront the manager who took my order he says - ""yeah, so what? -- your pancakes would have been cold if we made them when you called.""

Wow!",JK_cXmnGZVGOrXHf-0_z2A,1,0,1,wTHkgFUNfSvLqyqCDX3nyg

5993619,2018-03-08,0,klsBtNP-vlO3QlfPbAtTzQ,"The staff is doing the best they can with what they've got. I think the restaurant was a little understaffed to handle the steady pour of customers. My server was very polite, looked like he was working fast; however everything took a long time to get to me. As a result, the poached eggs I ordered cake out medium... regardless, I am giving the restaurant 4 stars because my bacon was crispy, English muffins were perfectly crunchy on the outside and chewy on the inside and like I said, the staff was extremely nice. I will probably prefer to drive a little further to get here than put up with the negative attitude that ""welcomes"" me at the Craig Rd. location...

Updating my previous review of 4 stars to 5 because I have been receiving consistently great service by Ray and his manager Marvin every time I visit this location. My #1 Denny's choice in Las Vegas for sure. On a side note, I would also like to thank the anonymous chefs in the back that help make this a 5 Star review! You guys are the best!",SSeOfQ3gronJEozm-FTMLg,0,0,5,GVkeGHjRHEC_28Yar_QCwA
