The person who was bringing food to the table clearly seemed unconvinced when I asked for a missing item --- just changed my mind and I am giving this place 2 stars. The location, not the brand. The restrooms were absolutely filthy! You think they would do a better job keeping the restrooms clean, but no. It was very challenging to take my son to the restroom.

Upon ordering the cashier was great, no complaints. She informed me that the Fuji apple chicken salad could only be made today with real apples as they had run out of the dried apples. I agreed that would be just fine. When I received my salad, the apple was cut in about 6 wedges, both ends of the stem included. It was thrown in the salad and was NOT done with any care. I had to pick them out. To top it off, I was given no dressing and had to go interrupt the workers that were mostly disinterested if I could get dressing. Additionally the place was a mess and a female employee at the pick up counter (customer side) was playing around with a coworker behind the counter so loud that it was quite annoying. Laughing and acting as though they were at the pool. 
So disappointed in this visit. I hope it was a fluke.",Dh-Le9sz5G0s25AGsSq7Nw,0,0,3,KGIemNiuzlBbpT72dFe7RA

Guy at the counter: is that for here or to go? 
Me: here. 
Him: do you have a Panera Bread card?
Me: No. 
Him: Want one?
Me: Suuuure! (Because of what I'd heard I thought I'd be back...why not?)
Him: Oh, we don't have any. 
Me: (still standing there smiling gormlessly in a pregnant pause having paid and been given my scone on a cheap plastic plate) Umm...a cappuccino?
Him: Oh, that's around the corner. (Why not tell me so as you hand me my scone?)

Around the corner. Woman makes two cappuccinos and takes them out to a table. I stand there smiling awaiting my capp. Guy asks if he can help me. Yup. I ordered a cappuccino. Oh, she will bring it out to your table (really? How would she even know it was mine?). Ok. Cool. 
A few minutes later the girl shouts ""cappuccino!"" I walk back to the counter to find that she had made it in a paper cup to go. Her dour expression made me think that if she smiled, her face would crack. I said it was for here. No apology, only a half-hearted offer to make another. Her tone conveyed apathy. I decided not to trouble her any further by asking her to correct the order. 

The decor is cheap and ugly. The piped music is hell-invokingly awful on a cheap sound system. The scone was kinda dry ('Bucks do a much yummier scone). Some of the service was mediocre, verging on unpleasant. Me no gusta. I can't think what the fuss about Panera Bread is, and this branch seems terribly out of place in amongst the nicer places this end of Boca. 

Maybe they just had an off day, and we can't know what people are going through, but simple smiles in the service industry can go a long way...they might even have made me consider returning despite the general unpleasantness of the monstrously decorated space, terrible sound system, baaaad music, and mediocre scone.

When I finally got to the register the sales associate read my order to me and it was incorrect, I explained the errors and said it no problem she would have it corrected right away and it would be up in a few minutes. 25 minuets later it still wasn't ready so I found the manager and asked her how much longer it would be? She checked and came back to tell me that they were just getting my soup ready and it would be right up....5 minutes later she walked passed me and saw that I was still there with no food and offered me a free pastry for the trouble which I declined.

Cafe prices for the food here. It's not a cheap place for a sandwich if you are comparing to a Subway, but the flavor and quality of food is as good as it gets in my opinion. I went to Panera TWICE (different locations) and food was served consistently. Cashiers know their menu and helped me choose my items. Paninis were crispy, warm, and loaded with chicken. YUMMY

I ordered Pick 2 which runs about $7.95 (I think). Choosing a ""Signature"" option will add $1 to the combo. French Onion soup and the Frontega Chicken, which is a signature option. Worth it. It's $1 cheaper than a lunch combo of sandwich and soup/salad at other places like Yard House anyway.

Some one said something then they opened 2 more. I ordered a ham and swiss half sandwich with a cop of chick noodle soup.  I asked for no onion or tomato. They gave me nothing on the sandwich. Bread, meat and cheese is all I got. The part that really pissed me off was waiting almost 20 minutes for my food as the lady behind me who ordered about 6 sandwiches and a few other items got her food first. Why would you make the person who ordered first with 2 items total wait longer than a large order? Crap service with over priced food.

Service is okay. Line seems to move slowly, and it's nice that they use the GPS beepers to bring the meal out to your exact table, but several tables go dirty after patrons clear their trash and leave- the place is set up to encourage people bussing their own tables, but they should still have staff around wiping down, and I didn't see this happening.

The most recent time I ordered a half Fuji chicken salad and called in, I was told it was a half salad so it would be done pretty quickly. I called at 11:52 and was told, it would be ready by 12:10. I got there at 12:25 and didn't see it on the pick up shelf. They probably forgot about the order because I've never had to wait that long to pick up a half salad from any panera, even when I'm dining in. A shift supervisor had to go make it, but she made it wrong. Seems like every time I try to say NO tomatoes, they always leave something else out as well.

The salad was supposed to have an arugula, kale, romaine mix but I only got romaine. The salad is also supposed to have Gorgonzola cheese but the salad didn't have that either. At least it didn't have tomatoes?

Lots and lots of it, it's twice the size of the one on Fort Apache and Tropicana. They also have an outside patio area for customers to use. 

I always get the You Pick Two deal which include any two from their soups, half a salad or half a sandwich. Depending on the salad or the sandwich, this deal will run you about $8-$10. I got their Spinach Power salad (mushrooms, egg, onions, bacon and spinach in an onion vinaigrette) and French Onion Soup with a side of bread. Portions were good and tasted delicious.

I dropped by for a quick lunch after a hair appt at the salon next door. I was starving. Took more than 15 minutes for a simple to-go order (no changes, completely on menu) of a turkey sandwich with an apple side and a bowl of broccoli cheddar soup with a baguette. And no, the store wasn't busy.

When I got home and opened the bag, I found a rotted apple - I'm talking visibly rotted, not just bruised, with an oozing spot and dents all over the rest of the fruit. So I sat that aside. Unwrapped the sandwich and it was sloppily assembled and WET. I mean the turkey was a sickly gray color and I could've wrung it out it was so soggy. It was disgusting and inedible and I fear very likely could've made me sick.

The soup and bread, if you're wondering, were fine but certainly nothing to write home about and definitely not worth the price.

I complained to Panera and they didn't even bother to apologize. Instead, they said they'd send me a ""treat"" which, after I questioned the further, was $10 on the Panera rewards card I don't even have. $10 towards a $20+ purchase of rotted food. Here's a hint: an apology for serving someone slop can go a long way. Pretend you care. It's the polite thing to do.

Panera has a lot to learn about customer service and food quality. I suggest some training for your staff and maybe a colorful chart detailing what an apple should look like. I mean, I should'n't have to tell you that turkey isn't meant to look like waterlogged insulation but hey, maybe your carelessness will cause an epidemic and the health dept will explain it to you in words you can understand - namely ""FAIL"".",cB1pgndvG47P8XkeDa-7PQ,0,0,1,5gbmEOoXZVbliKBeBtjP3Q

We needed a break from getting subs at different places and I chose to try something new.  This location opened recently.  It makes where I live about halfway between to Panera's but I decided to try this one.

Service was great at the counter, but the wait seemed long for the take out until I realized they had a number of people eating in who had ordered just before I got there.  I brought the sandwiches home and they were very good.  My wife had their Cuban chicken panini and I had the signature Steak and white cheddar.  They were both very good.  My panini had a fair kick from the horseradish spread on the sandwich.  With the sandwiches, I opted for the small bag of chips for each of us.

The order was packaged really nice in two small cardboard boxes.  My only complaint with this is there's really no way to tell which sandwich is which unless you peel back some of the bread to reveal the contents.  Some places put a numbered sticker on their sandwiches to match the items on your receipt.  The boxes at Panera have a place you could write the name.

Boca Park is always busy, so parking is usually an issue, but it's cleared up a lot since it opened last year. The food can be a little inconsistent at times. Everytime I've gotten an apple as my side, it feels like it's on it's last day, it's kinda mushy and just not very tasty. Once in a while, the lettuce doesn't seem super fresh either. But for the most part, everything I get is delicious. My favorite sandwich is the asiago roast beef, without horseradish, and I've never been disappointed. All of their soup is great, too. 
Sometimes the service is also inconsistent. One day a cashier will be very friendly, the next day they seem a little distracted and impatient, not necessarily rude though. The food does come out quick, which is great for my lunch breaks. Overall, I'm really happy with this location and come for lunch often!",XZ76qRWYPUq-rJSQ2S6iQQ,0,0,4,gbV1aL0T0zKiAT9pF5IM2A

Panera has become a regular a Mother-Daughter hangout spot over the past year even if it's a little out of our way. 

There's just something intimate about eating at a cute sandwich place with Mommy. It brings about good conversations and sets a good mood for the rest of the day. Like always, we choose the 'you pick two' option but frequently switch up our pairing. Yesterday, I ordered the Frontega Chicken Panini (chopped basil, chipotle sauce, red onions and chicken fillet on foccacia bread) with cheddar broccoli soup (my favorite) while mommy ordered the Turkey Breast Sandwich with French Onion Soup. On top of it, we shared a couple packets of chips to go with the meal.

Service was very fast despite a large crowd. Our orders arrived on our tables within 3-5 minutes of waiting. They provide their diners with an electronic table locator which helps staff navigate their way through the restaurant, finding customers who change seats. Water cups are free with ample supply of lemon slices and shaded outdoor seating is available for the warm spring months. There's jazz music playing in the background and blinds lowered for when the sun is high up during the afternoon hours. 

I don't remember a Panera experience where I didn't enjoy. Props also to the staff for being so patient with me and my bestie about a month back when we stayed for 3 hours or so making origami boxes for her sister-in-law. We are definitely coming back here more often in the near future.",QJMOgjRYeogK43kyfX6PKw,0,1,4,C7fyPp6D7_hWEI21p2xBBA

Once a dining staple, a quiet location in Northwest Ohio providing bottomless Coffee one of the primary drivers of a caffeine addiction unlikely to ever wane, Panera Bread has remained a place to relax and browse the internet as I've moved West through Phoenix and onto Las Vegas, a lackluster recent visit to Kneaders making me wonder just how the current baked goods at the Quick-causal mainstay compare.

Having at this point not eaten a bite at the restaurant in nearly nine years, but none-the-less memorizing their greetings and selections by way of the friendly clerks and longtime General Manager at the Bakery-Café just down the street, it was for an abbreviated Saturday Breakfast that parking was located during the Seasonal Art Walk and briefly perusing a selection of crafts that made me long for days back in the Midwest it was with far more deliberation that the freshly stocked shelves of Panera were investigated, a total of nine items ringing in at just over $20 and consumed, in parts, over the course of six hours traveling around town.

Laid out in a more open format than other Panera Bread stores in town, the high ceilings and divided sections plus an outdoor patio helpful for relocating in case of loud children, over-aggressive Air Conditioning or the Red Hat crowd, it was with items both boxed and plated that seating was found at a small banquet with one of the sparsely located electrical outlets, a soundtrack ranging from ChVrches to Tame Impala and TV on the Radio as the internet creeped along, Boca Park inexplicably having not yet upgraded to industry standard WiFi Speeds as of yet.

Focusing recently on ""going clean,"" an amusing phrase considering both my job and hobbies, a look at Panera's recent lineup includes several Autumnal Flavors looking to capitalize on ""Limited Time Only"" and ""Back by Popular Demand"" shenanigans, first bites of a 'Cinnamon Crunch' Snickerdoodle showing the soft Cookie to be no different than any other recipe, though the homogeneity from edge-to-edge made it generally underwhelming, the ""Gluten Conscious"" Monster and Triple Chocolate versions far more interesting as the first was punched up with everything from Nuts and Fruit to Chocolate with the latter particularly impressive by way of its chewiness and textural variance.

Knowing better than to take a chance on laminated options, the 'dough' pre-frozen and from a bag as witnessed at locations with a more open kitchen, Scones at Panera eat much more like the American dessert pastry than their crumbly British counterparts, the experience made even more 'Merica by the addition of over-the-top sweet toppings, the Wild Blueberry version eating much like a Blueberry Muffin elsewhere while others might as well be served as Cake slices, though the seasonal Caramel Apple Thumbprint really is quite delicious comforting when warmed up and eaten in the proper context.

Completely underwhelmed by the ""Cobblestone,"" a lumpy sort of Brioche Muffin that seems to play on concepts of Monkey Bread and Fritters without properly executing on either, the Pumpkin Muffie comes off strangely dry considering the typical moisture content of its supposed constituents, the Apple Crunch Muffin a far better overall experience with small bits of Streusel mixed into the batter along with a whole lot of Cinnamon and dehydrated Apple Chips.

TWO AND A HALF STARS:  Generally a nice place to study and browse the internet, free Coffee refills and a wide variety of sweeteners plus creams available, Panera Bread is nonetheless 'food for the masses' sold in a slightly prettier package, the current ""Clean"" campaign just window dressing for to justify high prices as calorie counts and taste of most items are no different than what one might find at any number of other chain restaurants.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,7,4,3,VioM24gIkJAqZkQPPV7cNg

5527282,2014-09-21,1,EMrghF81px-wnNqEYqA0Kw,"I am obsessed with Panera!! I always go to the Lake Mead and Tenaya location and get the ""Pick Two"": BBQ chicken flatbread, with chicken caesar salad, and an apple. I have always loved that combination and it's my favorite food... LITERALLY!!

Now, I go to the Boca Park location, as I was closer to it, and on my BBQ chicken flatbread, there were two pieces of chicken on a CHICKEN FLATBREAD, which made it more of a spinach and cheese flatbread. So I was already in shock when I ate it. 

Next, I go to eat my salad. At my normal location, they put the perfect amount of sauce and it's not too much nor too little. I go to Boca Park and it's way too much dressing and way too fishy! 

I was surprised my apple didn't have a worm in it. 

Overall, I'm not pleased and will only be attending my regular Panera, even if it means using a little extra gas.",-QvYBemvsPsOaEWQq_wdKQ,1,0,1,HLTWWvo6v2iYh8_cVDEp5g
5576253,2016-02-02,4,EMrghF81px-wnNqEYqA0Kw,"On a rainy day, a tomato soup is just what I'm craving! My friend and I were shopping all day and she told me she'd NEVER been to panera before so obviously I had to take her. 

This location is a beautiful and nice location because it's in boca park. There always seems to be a line when I go in but I don't mind it usually goes by relatively quickly. 

My food was out very quickly but for some reason my friends took a bit longer. Hmm. 

I got a delicious tomato soup on a rainy day. Yum! Hit the spot. I also tried their Mediterranean veggie sandwich for the first time. It was delicious! Highly recommended. I got it as a lettuce wrap though since I'm on a low carb diet right now. 

Pros: nice location, friendly staff, free wifi, noise level low 

Cons: sometimes too crowded, I always have a hard time finding parking at this location

This one is larger than most of the other Paneras and the staff is extra friendly.  Other than that, the menu is the same as all Paneras.

5587874,2016-10-27,0,EMrghF81px-wnNqEYqA0Kw,"Don't get me wrong, the staff is fairly nice in person and the food is always good, but they mess up my order a lot. I've had to get in the habit of looking through every single thing they put in my bag, because it seems if I don't, I get home and find something is missing. I'll call and tell them, because I want my money back for the item I didn't receive, and both times they have offered some sort of payback. 

First, they forgot a fruit cup, so they said they would give me a free one next time I came in. The person on the phone said they'd put my name on the manager's list. I go in and they have no idea what I'm talking about. They gave me an entree for free, which was totally great of them.

Second time, when I do rapid order pick up, I get there and have to wait around for 10 minutes before my order is even ready (even though I came in 5 minutes after it was set to be done) and rush out the door to get food home for me and my boyfriend and they forgot the dessert. I called again, they said they could give me two free desserts; again I was told that my name would be put on a list. Go in a little while later and, again, they have no clue what I'm talking about.

If another Panera were closer, I'd go to that one because I've never had this issue with another Panera. I understand mistakes happen, I worked in the food industry, but that doesn't make it any less annoying. So, just a reminder for everyone to check their bags if they do Rapid Pick Up at this location.",7_4gCcBja69AVQjX1XKxsg,0,0,2,l1r5M7vJAdLXEwQ8e8vNUQ

5800339,2013-03-24,1,EMrghF81px-wnNqEYqA0Kw,I visited this location on 3/8/2013. The experience was ok. It was my first time at Panera and the only reason I decided to go was because my pregnant wife wanted something simple. (I personally prefer Jason's Deli which just happens to be around the corner). We went and ordered the chipotle chicken sandwich and the roasted turkey artichoke sandwich along with a cheese and broccoli soup. The soup was great and the chipotle chicken sandwich was decent. However my wife did not have such a great experience as she had to literally order her sandwich 3 times before they somewhat got it right. There was also no customer service as she had to keep going to the cooking line herself to get the correct sandwich and take the wrong one back plenty of workers saw her going back and forth. It's not hard to miss a pregnant lady and not one worker offered to try and rectify the issue. I will not be returning to this establishment..,-onC-AjB6FVFY5PhZ9cpLQ,3,1,1,uEj11KdaVSlJkYCFOt4JTg

Please avoid- Thai wonton soup- this soup was disgusting - seriously they need to take this off the menu
The iced teas are always refreshing thankfully. Overall- will come back, but not a favorite of mine anymore, the manager was nice enough to give us a refund for that horrible soup, but this time I think I will stick to the classics, price wise this place is a bit expensive for semi-fast good...",UAO-fiRQl0Why09SjUaMjw,0,0,2,KI-EMS-ye542qhJRnsjGbQ
