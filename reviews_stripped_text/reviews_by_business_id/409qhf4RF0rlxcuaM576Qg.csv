859466,2014-11-06,0,409qhf4RF0rlxcuaM576Qg,"El Pollo Loco is my favorite fast food restaurant! I eat it at least four time a month and the service and food is usually top notch. Unfortunately, I can't say the same for this particular location! My 11-year-old son and 4-year-old daughter planned to go there since earlier in the morning. We went in on Tuesday, November 4, 2014 at around 2:00PM - a busy time, but no excuse for what we went through. I was fifth in line, but our turn came up fairly fast. We ordered the new family meal for $20, which includes their new version of manicotti; four corn tortillas rolled up into the shape of cigars, filled with melted cheese and topped with a slightly spicy red sauce! 

It took a good 15 minutes for the food to be ready and when we received it, the first thing we noticed was that the 8-pieces of chicken were so over-cooked that they were completely dry and some parts were so tough that they were completely inedible! But we were so hungry, we let it go and began to eat. Anyway, I was so looking forward to trying the new manicotti! It looked great and I went ahead to cut one in half with my fork to see how much melted cheese would be oozing out like in the picture, but....are you ready for this?!....all that was inside was a bunch of shredded cheese, not melted at all! And when I decided to touch it ever so gently to avoid burning my finger, it was ice-cold, literally! They forgot to cook it and served it raw! Now, I'm not one to complain too much, but this was rediculous! I took it back to the counter and showed it to the manager. Although they immediately began preparing a new order, there were no ""we're sorry,"" or any form of disciplinary action, like it was no big deal! Ten minutes later they brought out a new order to our table. But they replaced the four uncooked ones with only two new ones! Again, I went back to the counter, but this time the manager rolled his eyes at me like it was my fault! That pissed me off. By the time we sat down to eat, all the employees would eye us weird! You could tell that the word spread throughout and now I was a trouble customer to them. I will never go back to this location again and I urge corporate to make staff changes immediately!",vmMCdliw3qREe4rChe_jCg,1,0,1,fAFEXFTLNfBezgwoCCN71Q

They just opened and the place was PACKED.  I couldn't help but thinking that we would wait at least 20 minutes for our food. To my surprise, it came out in less than 10!  It was very, very quick.

Plenty of seating space.  Friendly empmloyees that come around asking if you need anything and they even come around with a tray when you're done eating with napkins, mints, toothpics, etc.

Its like a fast food restaurant with waitresses, but not really.

The food was awesome. I got the #7 Grilled Chicken Salad. It was awesome.  The mint-green dressing and the roasted corn on the salad was most memorable.

My friend got a Chicken Avacado Wrap and he thought it was good.

The drink choices are good.  They have the Low Calorie Lemonade from Minutemaid and then they also have CHERRY COKE!

I'll definately be coming back to this place soon.",dLrMDYQ9TwfodJxYLfaKDQ,1,1,5,vOkcMNBMpfRonxQ6dTZbrA

I are el pollo loco thru 2 pregnancies lol. I know a good one from a bad one.  The food here is good. 

The service on the other hand stinks. yes, that's the only word I can use to describe it that isn't inappropriate lol. The first time we came here they were rude in the drive thru and not so much at the window. The salads were really fresh tho and the food was yummy. 

Tonight, when I ordered the girl was kinda rude but, not too much. I know they were really busy and I understand that. I've been in the service industry since childhood ( my parents made us all work). Anyway, age hands me my drink, takes my $, gives me the change and slams the window shut. No Ty or good night  etc...

Then she's looking at me like I'm stupid because I'm still sitting in the drive thru. You know that "" WTH does she want look""? I know it lol!!! She finally opens the window and I say "" you didn't give me my food"". She literally bent over to look in my car like I was hiding it or something. Then, she turned away quickly she looked panicked. She never said one word. Not, sorry, my bad... Nothing at all. Then this lil jerk comes up dark hair glasses and hands me the bag. I ask for green sauce. He says I put the dressing in there. I said "" no green sauce"" he says ""you mean avocado salsa?"". Obviously, you know what I meant dip sh&t. I don't say it tho... I just think it. He hands me two tiny green sauces turns his back to me and starts conversing with his coworker. 

Where are your damn manners? I don't care how old you are. My daughters 11 and she knows to say please and thank you to everyone. I said "" thank you very much, have a good night"" and he turned towards me his back was to me the entire time and he said ""yeah bye"". 

My daughter went into the store. She had to use the restroom so, I gave her $ to buy a coke. I didn't want them to think that she's a free loader. I drove around to pick her up and she was so angry. Lol. She said "" omg they were so ride to me"" I said "" me too"". 

What can you do, right? Just write a review on yelp to let out your frustrations lol.

I went inside to ask for my money back. I explained 3-4 times that I had literally just left the drive thru. Over and over she said drive thru???

The chair legs were filthy from where a mop had been up against them, there was crud of some kind...food probably...on the window sills, glass doors had hand prints all over them, and there was standing water with some warning signs around it. Little things really, but it all added up.

Visit B:

The management and staff at this place has NO CLUE as to what they're doing. Either they're too young or need add'l training. Staff speaks to customers without 'Thank You's"", ""You're Welcome's"", or a damn smile, it's really not that hard to smile!

I went over for dinner around 6pm on a Friday night...the parking lot was packed.  I walked in and placed my order.   I started to look around and there were like 7 different clusters of people.....it seemed like some poor man's group therapy deal where a bunch of wackos met on Meet-Up.  Wackos can be cool but wth are they doing taking up the space in the restaurant?  Also, usually I have lunch and not dinner.  1000% different.  At dinner all the table were dirty and the place looked pretty bad.  Maybe they were waiting for the group therapy session to clear out.  But, the lunch crew runs a tight ship.  Kick out the weirdos and give me the lunch crew and I give this place 4 stars.",BzEf4f8nNYz3SCb_qA66DA,0,0,2,n6J0Dqs-k0u5-KRAPaa3ww
