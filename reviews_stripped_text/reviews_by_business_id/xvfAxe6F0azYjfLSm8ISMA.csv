59940,2013-04-13,0,xvfAxe6F0azYjfLSm8ISMA,"Went here last night for an anniversary dinner and were very disappointed with what we got for the price.  We arrived at 6pm and were promptly seated and the service was top notch if not a bit overboard (my water never got more than 1/2 full and as soon as i put my fork down they were there to clear my plate) to begin with, it slowed as the evening progressed. 

The bread with bruchetta was very good. The dinner rolls were hot from the oven and very chewy; and the bruchetta was very garlicky which I love and the EVOO was good quality. 

We split a gorgonzola and pear salad which was very good and possibly the highlight of the meal.

I am only giving two stars because the salad was the last place the food and the service were exceptional. The restaurant started to fill up and our waiter, Jose,  all but disappeared, in fact we had to ask the buser, Mirabel to find him several times. 

We split the Artichoke Franchese which was bland and soggy, such a disappointment since I love artichokes. The breading on the artichokes just tasted like bad breading at a dive bar with zero seasonings and there is no sauce included to drown the taste.

I ordered the Veal Limone which I had read was quite good. It is served with string beans and a side of pasta. The veal itself was cooked perfectly but it is drowning in a heavy butter sauce. The beans had no seasoning and were over cooked. I am not a fan of red sauce to begin with but the pasta was drenched in what tasted like a canned tomato sauce. 

My boyfriend ordered the rib eye topped with mushrooms which was cooked perfectly and he did enjoy it. Unfortunately he too had the same complaint as me in regards to the beans and pasta. 

When it came time to pay there was no one to be found, not even our overly attentive buser. When the buser finally got our waiter he brought us the wrong bill (which he blamed the buser for) and then we had to flag our buser down to get the issue fixed.",oisQ6O_uV70PhWLqaNhbIg,0,0,2,Q6QKwgQzodHuCt7efGTlIw

Oysters weren't that great, marinara sauce was ok at best, nothing special about the meatballs at all they were semi bland, chicken parm was ok nothing special, the bread and dipping sauce was good, service was excellent.

We will keep it simple. if the menu says Chicken Parmigiana with a side of pasta why does it come with green beans and pasta in a bowl that is watery? 
If a chicken breast will not cut with a fork and then the knife is even hard ...is that tender? 
If a server brings you a knife when you asks and reached across your plate to put it in the side it belongs instead of walking around it this right? 
If you order iced tea no lemon and it comes with Lemon 3 times, is that wrong.?
If My father in law is too polite to send his meal back because it is tough and just not good -- Ravioli... is that wrong.? 
Server was Average at best , His assistant was ... the best service was the bus person

Lasagna was ok, shrimp scampi ok, salmon lots of bones very small , veal was salty who serves string beans next to veal parmasian. presentation turned me off right away. overall meal not so great. desserts were better.  Overall very disappointed in the quality of the food. The sauce was the most awful bitter unseasoned out of the can pomadoro I have ever tasted .YUK If you are planning on a nice dinner out this would not be it. Overpriced for low quality food. Very disappointed. There is obviously no chef of any talent in the kitchen.  It seems to be run by short order cooks with no training. Italian food is really hard to screw up. Dinner was over $200.

Service was good and the restaurant was in no hurry to push us through our meal to claim our table.  We made reservations through Open Table as we had ""walked in"" earlier in our stay only to find there was nothing available for over an hour.  

They provide a nice bread basket with fresh ciabatta rolls and dipping sauce.  We enjoyed a nice Ceasar salad followed by pasta dishes.  The fettuccine Alfredo was excellent as was the linguine with clams in a white sauce.  This was accompanied by a nice Pinot Grigio.  We are not dessert eaters so I cannot address that issue although some of those going to other tables were visually enticing.  I am not sure what the previous complaints about the size of the salads as I though the size was appropriate for a first course.

We recently drove to Vegas to get married and spent a few days before and after the ceremony at the South Point Hotel. Disappointed with the Garden Buffet during our dinner on the first night, we decided to try an Italian restaurant the following day. 

We were greeted and seated fairly quickly and the service was friendly and efficient. The menu had a good selection of items available which were decently priced. The courses were timed well, not to quick and not too late. The staff was very accommodating. 

Further, as Club members, we were able to take advantage of free dessert with out entree order.

339962,2013-10-09,0,xvfAxe6F0azYjfLSm8ISMA,"Beyond Outstanding.TEN STARS, no kidding.  We had such a good experience here that I thought it was a fluke. Then we had another and another. Then we took a group to the hotel for a weekend...16 RSVP'd for dinner and 28 showed up. It was no problem. I was absolutely stunned how well, on a Saturday night, they were able to accommodate such a large group, and were clearly happy to do so.   Our waitstaff was amazing - they knew the menu and nuances of the wine list, inside and out. They were fast, efficient and didn't mind special requests even from a large group.  We fully expected to be served in sections and were pleasantly surprised when we were all served at the same time. Don Vito's is clearly very, very well managed. 

The atmosphere and acoustics are wonderful despite being inside a busy casino hotel.  The lighting is just petfect.  The bread is fresh baked and the marinated sun dried tomato bruschetta was flavorful and delicious. There is an extensive, reasonably priced wine list and full bar available.  We had the Lobster Milanese and Lasagna. Both were the best we have ever eaten, absolute perfection (...and I mean that...I travel extensively for work dining with clients who prefer 5 stars restaurants that include a Captain's wine list...).

The manager has visited our table each time we have dined here and we are pleased to have gotten to know this wonderful man professionally, and he is the consummate professional.

I will probably update this review as I keep reading it and saying, ""it's just not enough."" This is a restaurant we visit every single time we go to Vegas and we look forward to dining there when we stay at the Southpoint again!",uQiQK-NDC9_z3l-xQtLGcQ,1,0,5,Qgr-MpSglDJIRsDyfAqJOQ

532969,2013-12-31,0,xvfAxe6F0azYjfLSm8ISMA,"My mother and I made reservations for Don Vito's Christmas Dinner.  We went for the special Christmas menu and it was honestly the WORST dinning experience of my life.  I have never left a bad review for a restaurant before, so this is saying A LOT. 

I'd like to start out by saying that the service was fantastic, friendly and quick.  Everything else was disgusting.  

The wine they brought me was in a dirty, sticky, cloudy, finger printed glass. Bad way to start out but they were busy so I figured it was an oversight.

The appetizer Caesar salad was ""OK""  but way over dressed and not very fresh.  My mom ordered the eggplant & brie soup to start and it was actually pretty tasty.

The main problem was the entree. 
 
We both ordered the grilled Alaskan halibut with king crab.   It was described on the menu as being served with ""saffron dill sauce, cranberry & pine nut rice with artichokes and sautéed baby spinach.""  All for $37.
To begin, my mothers wasn't even served with the king crab.  The sauce had no dill, the artichokes were canned and the rice was just pain pilaf.  Again, it all tasted ""OK"", albeit bland.  

The WORST part was the fish.  IT was so DISGUSTING.  It was so tough and over cooked that it was inedible.  We would have needed a steak knife to cut it.  I have literally NEVER had a worse piece of fish in my life.  Neither of us could eat it.

Again, I have never left a bad review for a restaurant because I know it is not easy to run a restaurant and mistakes happen. However, I would have to say that this was the worst meal of my life... and it was on Christmas.",U8pXSZKQu25NoAnPBrUrmQ,0,0,1,Lsl0JrtFcoPePvsQrkn9iw

I was then over charged by almost 100.00 with no corrected receipt just a name and a promise. I hope my money has been returned. We will never go back to this sketchy so called Italian restaurant.!!,nvY5usxLXy7JNL5u0o-pPA,0,0,1,pTyjfhQHnqRzn48W9UGCLQ

955849,2010-02-16,0,xvfAxe6F0azYjfLSm8ISMA,"Very disappointed. Had been to Don Vitos a couple of years ago for a business dinner. Had remembered that it was enjoyable and the food had been good.
Went back this time with the family, for Valentines Day.
Venue is still attractive - especially the perimeter seating - intimate and done just right.
Big let down was the food and the service.
The staff seemed to rush the whole service. Insisted on taking the order right away. Whole meal service for 8 lasted about 35 mintues. Felt like we were being hustled out.
Anyway, now to the food ...
Bread seemed stale. They delivered piles of garlic relish - presumably to disguise the stale bread.
I ordered the Chicken Parmigiana - same thing I ordered the first time.
It was horrible. Looked like it had been heavily breaded days before, cooked at the same time and then frozen. The pieces were almost a perfect circle - odd for chicken - would have confused it for chicken rondolets! They heaped tomato sauce on the two pieces, sprinkled a tiny bit of mozzarella cheese on top and then obviously microwaved it.
When done right the chicken is cooked first - properly I might add then added to sauce and cheese and baked. Not the case here.
They have one side - penne pasta. It is hard to ruin pasta - Don Vitos managed to do it this time.  I am a fan of al dente pasta - only when it is fresh and warm. The pasta that I got was in a bowl, barely luke warm, edges of the pasta were dry and hard and a single blob of almost warm marinara sauce in the middle. All in all, the meal was a disaster - everybodey else at the table had issues with their meal as well.
A shame really. Perhaps reviews like mine will serve to inspire them to get back to the cooking I remembered them for.
I do not see myself going back anytime soon.
Would recommend a fantastic Italian restaurant down the street that we ate at a couple of nights before, Bootlegger. Awesome food, nice ambiance. best bet for great italian if you are down at that end of Las Vegas Boulevard.",N1OHFWHQ9YI3u4UHMW12iQ,0,0,1,5BwhmMsyW_HXDye8xdf_cw

Their garlic dipping oil and warm bread they give you to start is so delicious; we immediately, dug in.  However, we were all careful not to stuff ourselves silly. We had salad or soup to start the standout was the caprese ($10). Beautiful and tasty!

The crab stuffed halibut ($30) was offered on the Christmas menu. It was good, but not terribly special. I've had far better fish elsewhere.
 
The rest of the entrees varied from surf to turf and pasta: filet mignon ($30), veal parm ($28), sea bass ($30) and gnocchi ($17) were all enjoyed. The gnocchi was the crowd pleaser. Rich and dreamy.
 
Thanks to the coupon booklet given at hotel check-in we were able to all indulge in complimentary dessert. A canoli, tiramisu and cheesecake were had. All were scrumptious. Service was great throughout the meal.
 
We also had a bottle of wine and the total damage for five was $210. It was a pleasant surprise, Merry Christmas to us.",ZsUSGU1-L1ImomLZjXxxTg,3,0,4,NrbpMSxytN8Kql92umazAg

The farfalle with shrimp and scallops was heavenly. So happy one dish made the cut. Dessert - tortuffo was delicious however the strawberry sour cream custard was basically over cooked.

First of all, the service was great. The waiters I had really did a good job of making sure I was doing okay since I came alone. I had a nice glass of red wine and they provided me with a great bread basket with a small dish of garlicy bruschetta.

It was hard to decide what to order, but ultimately I went for a ravioli with walnuts and a penne ala vodka sauce. The meal started with a Caesar salad that I loved. The meal itself was only okay, I didn't love the walnut taste (though the waiter did warn me it was a bit sweet!).

1684460,2016-10-29,2,xvfAxe6F0azYjfLSm8ISMA,"AWFUL! I'll start with that. We were seated at our reservation time which was the only thing I can say positively about this place. When we walked in we were greeted kindly and promptly. We then witnessed what appeared to be a manager jokingly insulting another manager in front of us. Not good. As we were seated, I asked for a table. They have huge tables that seat 6 or more so we were forced to sit at a huge table. The server greeted us and started to pull the unoccupied chairs away from our table. No one around needed these chairs! What the heck was that for? 

After the moving situation was over, 2 different people brought bread and drinks. The server finally came back and took our order.

First course: Calamari-It was like chewing on rubber. Ate 2 pieces of the appetizer, YUCK. 

Second course: Caesar salad and pasta fagioli. Again YUCK! The salad was topped with a tasteless dressing and shredded parm cheese that was dry and hard. The soup was and odd color of dark brown resembling baby poo. I put my spoon in it and it looked like bean dip. I found one piece of pasta in there. I didn't even taste it because of its appearance. 

Third course: At this point, I was thinking there is no way they could screw up capellini pomodoro and shrimp scampi. WRONG! Again, YUCK. I wish I would have taken pictures. I added meatballs to the dish. They were mushy when I cut them open and I almost panicked after I took a bite because it was red inside! I turned the light on my phone to check, but it was cooked throughly. (Sigh of relief). I proceeded to try the capellini. It was drowning in meat sauce and super heavy. Why was there a meat sauce on this!? 
The dish is supposed to be light with fresh veggies. It so was not! 

Ok so on to the scampi. Imagine a beautifully plated dish of shrimp scampi with large shrimp, fresh veggies and spaghetti pasta. Now take that a pour a light brown, off colored sauce resembling the texture of mucus. So nasty. 
I can't even tell you that the bread appetizer was good. 

Now for payment. I had a comp and a coupon so this dining experience was not worth me fighting with management. If I was paying cash, my bill definitely would not exist because I would have sent it all back. The server gives me the bill with an almost halfway used comp and my coupon taken off the bill. Why would you use a coupon when the comp covers the bill? So, I go to the hostess, tell her and the manager what happened and this guy literally snatches the ticket from my hand in an angry manner and walks away. I kept calm because I already was about to lose my cool. Then, here comes the server to the hostess stand telling me that it didn't matter that coupon was used with this sour look on her face. The manager comes back and gives me my coupon and says, ""you are all taken care of now"". He then walks away. How rude!

I honestly like Southpoint for all of its amenities and offers they give. This experience was by far and away the most ridiculous experience in any restaurant I have ever been in. This restaurant really needs to do a major overhaul on staff training and service. Oh and for F**ks sake do something about the food!",nuOFlh6xoqikpLbhTbLf0Q,0,0,1,YhRIqniLj9C9jmaVAwfcXw

We started with the stuffed mushrooms.  They were tasty. I absolutely love mushrooms so I may be a little biased.  They're stuffed with sausage, spinach and cheese.  It's pretty much the perfect little appetizer for me.  

I ordered the Pacific Salmon Rios for my entree.  It's pan roasted with vegetables in a lemon basil pesto.  Each entree is served with salad and a side of penne pasta.  The penne was very plain and simple.  It didn't have much flavor so I didn't finish that.  

Ian was our waiter for the evening. His welcoming demeanor made for an enjoyable dining experience.  He was very attentive and we appreciated his friendly service.  I look forward to the next visit!",xhhE0txKwQtRzgQVVdKkvg,7,2,3,y0sdR0nFDhUIgx6huKlsqQ

Ambiance: Old-school Italian restaurant. There are booths around the periphery, and tables for 4 to 6 in the middle. The tables are all set very elegantly with tablecloths. Our waiter and busboy each were in a sport coat and vest. Very classy.
Service: Our busboy came by almost immediately to fill our water glasses and bring a basket of bread products. Our server, Michelle, came by shortly thereafter to get a drink order and answer questions about the menu. She was very warm and welcoming with a nice sense of humor. Throughout the evening, both she and the busboy were very attentive. Five star service.
Food: I ordered the Rigatoni Vito. This was a large portion of rigatoni with a very generous portion of sausage, lots of sliced peppers with a delicious red sauce (it is supposed to have olives also - but I had them left out). My buddy had rigatoni and meatballs in a red sauce. He asked for a lot of modifications to the way it would normally come. The chef was accommodating - my buddy was very happy with the outcome. Both entrees were delish. And portion size was more than either of us could finish (lunch for tomorrow!) The entree comes with choice of soup or salad. I chose the Caesar salad. Generous size dish for a dinner salad. Also delish. 
Value: The entrees were only $20 each. A very fair price (even inexpensive) for the level of ambiance and service and the quality of the food. I will definitely come back again.",GOTjwdXD6bNZ-_qjY7GYYw,1,0,5,w1rNvbKFytcNdVwV85eGmw

On the downside the extra-charge Ceaser salad was a joke with flavorless domestic parmesan and no hint of garlic or anchovies.  The sea bass was glazed in a wine-butter reduction that contributed only an oily mouth-feel that desparately cried out for some acidity. The server checked our satisfaction before the 1st forkful but disappeared by the time that a wedge of lemon would have rescued this dish.

I remember growing up in New Jersey- actually, it was Tony Soprano-land.  We had just moved to the US & 'going out' to eat meant going to the Arena Diner in Hackensack (I  checked, no reviews on Yelp!) where I discovered grilled cheese and ham sandwiches! But I digress.  In retrospect, sometimes I wonder about the various 'Don Vito-like' places that were in our neck of the woods, places we had never ventured that probably had  some *tasty* eats!!!!!

Back to my review: 
The service did not miss a beat, and the food was satisfying and well presented.  

To start: we had the 
Mozzarella Fritti
Breaded and fried with Marinara and Alfredo Sauces $5.95
& 
Stuffed Mushrooms
Mushrooms Stuffed with Sausage, Spinach and Italian Cheeses $6.95

While both appetizers were good, the stuffed mushrooms were flavorful and were an excellent start to our meal. 

The following were served with a side of Penne Pasta- In addition, a choice of Green Salad or Cup of Soup- I had the minestrone soup, which was piping hot. 
Veal Parmesan
Lightly Breaded and Oven Baked with Marinara Sauce & Mozzarella Cheese $21.95
My choice: Chicken Parmesan
Lightly Breaded and Oven Baked with Marinara Sauce and Mozzarella Cheese $15.95

My chicken parmesan was a generous portion of 2 chicken breasts lightly breaded and pan fried- perfectly balanced, without the dreaded sogginess. We opted  for the Tiramisu as dessert- when it arrived to our table, we were surprised that it was served in a tall martini glass (correct me if i am wrong, pics above) with a topping of fresh berries!!! Light and airy, with a nice hint of sweetness but not overloaded with liqueur, the only regret we had was that we didn't order ONE each! .. Apologies go out to my Host With the Mostest in Las Vegas (Heretofore to be referred to as: HWMLV) 

But then again... many more eating adventures await, so it was prob just as well. Or, at least, that's what my trainer said when she weighed me today. 

NOTE: Don't forget the Listerine.... the garlic factor is *super* high for us- (or maybe it was just what we ordered?)",hN2yDV75um9F1LiJnkvWJQ,5,4,5,AuYdmeI2kajg9bMhelZxNw

The attention to detail, the room and the service have been excellent every time I have dined here.  They have a nice variety of ( mostly Northern) Italian food. There are also a few very nice  non Italian dishes that seem influenced by the steakhouse next door.  The steaks and seafood are still exclusive to the room and a nice addition for groups where people in a party want something other than Italian food. 

I switch it up now and then but I like the Cappellini Pomodoro and Ravioli the best for my entree. The caprese  is a very large portion and has very nice flavor. The minestrone soup tastes very fresh  as well. 

For dessert I could almost pick blindly and really like  anything I pick since I've tried everything. My very favorite is Zabaglione & Fresh Berries. It is light, flavorful and a perfect way to end a nice meal with along with some Fernet-Branca or a chilled Sambuca. 

The only thing keeping this from a 5 star review is the marinara sauce and other red sauces are good but not great. They learn toward cream based which isn't my style.

Very reasonably priced with soup or salad thrown in with the main meals. I had the Rigatoni Vito which was excellent with an assortment of different peppers, olives, sausage and a spicy tomato sauce. Wife had the Gnocchi which was in a slightly different form than we are used to which was also great.

My wife is a vegetarian so it's also a plus that there's FOUR different things on the menu for her, as well as plenty to keep me (with my dislike of common Italian fare such as mushrooms) happy also.",U1XB9-3lh8Z3Eki6qU-v2g,1,1,5,sc0JdC6vPv-v8ReBeviY0Q
3249135,2013-02-18,0,xvfAxe6F0azYjfLSm8ISMA,"More accurately I'd give this restaurant 3.5 stars. I never thought I'd wish for fractions...

The service is great. I came here alone for my weekly antisocial mini-vacation and thoroughly enjoyed the experience. Everyone I talked to was extremely helpful and welcoming. Ambiance is pleasant--a large window separates the restaurant from the rest of the casino so I didn't hear the slot machines. The lighting and circular setup turn it into a tranquil bubble within the casino. 

Here is the breakdown in ratings for different menu items:

BREAD: 4 stars. They have a definite edge in the bread department because you get a little bowl of marinated garlic/bruschetta...I have never seen such a wonder! That shiz is good as hell. The bread itself is pretty good, but the goody bowl is the impressive part!

PASTA E FAGIOLI SOUP: 3.5 stars. Tasty lil bowl of soup. Nothing extravagant, but nice. 
 
CHICKEN ANGELO: 3.25 stars. I'm getting weird with fractions again. It's a good dish with a nice flavor and it was recommended by two of the staff members. Even though I liked it I couldn't help feeling there was something missing. I saved half the dish for later, which means it was good enough for me to take but it wasn't so good that I couldn't stop eating it. Maybe it didn't have MSG in it haha! That or it lacked an X-factor. 

TIRAMISU: 2 stars. I took this to-go and wasn't a fan. The ladyfingers were SOAKED in liqueur. They tasted gross to me. I avoided the soggy liqueur cake parts and just ate the creamy part which was just decent. I've had way better tiramisu. My waitress recommended this, which either means she loves liqueur and soggy cake or she just hasn't eaten as many tiramisus as me. It was a hot mess of a dessert. 

Because I had such a pleasant time here, there is a chance I will return. Plus--I really like Southpoint and it's close to my house. It is overpriced though, so I'm more likely to try other places first. ""Luxury eating"" expenses aren't supposed to be in my budget, and I could have gone to Chipotle 4 times for what I paid (including wine and a hearty tip). No regrets, but can't justify rushing back either!",I-SN6Xd16pQ_VlopT8ViaA,1,1,3,6VWHS_ZPsfAcPv-zEcHY1g

3400237,2013-11-14,3,xvfAxe6F0azYjfLSm8ISMA,"Service and ambience are both good. I find those are two things that the restaurants in the Southpoint do surprisingly well. I almost couldn't decide between a three or four star rating, but I decided to round up because I love their eggplant parmesan so much. 

I've been here three times, and each time it was great. Nothing worse than ordering something you loved before and getting a crappy version the next time. Bonus points for consistency. The eggplant is tender and layered with wonderful creamy ricotta filling, excellent marinara, and topped with a thick golden layer of bubbling mozzarella. $17 worth of heaven.

The bread basket is nice- two flavors of ciabatta rolls: plain and topped with sun dried tomatoes. It comes with a dish of garlic cloves and roasted peppers in oil, and if you get your pretty sister to bat her eyelashes at the waiter, you will also get butter, olive oil and balsamic vinegar. A yummy little bread buffet.

My sis loves the grilled shrimp appetizer. I found it just ok- tends to be overcooked and a little tough. (Which still beats undercooked and slimy). Shrimp are hard to get to that perfect doneness, but they ARE professionals.

Babygirl likes the Chicken Angelo, which I find good but not the best version I've ever had. Makes me nostalgic for the old Cosmo's Underground.

Dessert is kind of weak.( Not unexpected in an Italian restaurant- the only thing I usually like are cannolis anyway) . Little guy had the coconut sorbet, which was served in a real shell and garnished nicely, but frozen too hard and somewhat flavorless.

And speaking of flavorless, my biggest complaint is the salad course. It's kind of a Catch 22 : it's too small, and it doesn't taste very good. SO, you want a bigger salad, but not THAT salad. They call it caesar, but you can detect almost none of the wonderful pungent, earthy flavors it should have. It's just a little bowl of watery, flavorless. shredded lettuce. I'm thinking they cut down down the portions to avoid waste when they saw how much was being returned to the kitchen. But the problem was not that they were giving too much, but that nobody liked it. Get a clue, Don Vito's: enough people have complained about the salad, so fix it!
It's not that hard. And while you're at it, take that shrimp off the fire a minute earlier. 

Thank you.",-qj9ouN0bzMXz1vfEslG-A,2,2,4,71MaZE84mOyV8m_G0vx7ZA

3475921,2017-07-29,0,xvfAxe6F0azYjfLSm8ISMA,"Tried Don Vito's for the very first time and was disappointed.  Arrived at our reservation time of 7 pm and was seated in a booth.  The bus person brought us water and I noticed that the table was very shaky and I asked if the table could be secured.  He went to who I guess was the Manager and informed him of the shaky table and came to look, then moved our party of three to the very next table.

No apologies from the Manager.  Our Filipina waitress was informed that we had moved and graciously apologized and took our order of fried calamari, 2 different pastas, a soup, Caesars salad, and a lasagna.  The meal was not the quality that we had expected.  There was a pool of oil at the bottom of the bowl that the calamari was served on and the rest of the food was salty and seemed like it was just tossed together.  The Caesars salad was also salty and had way too much dressing that magnified the saltiness of the dish.

The food quality was poor and it's apparent that the chef didn't have his heart in it when he prepared it.  Only one third of the entire meal was eaten.  Also, the bus person who needs training in customer service was very aggressive in his attempts to remove dishes even though food was still on the plate.  The female waitress however, was very nice and professional.  Would not recommend this restaurant.",eFuUUaUaUDRn1p1koNjbqQ,0,0,2,hpvqNbgd-9i7iw_qsS16Dg

3577069,2018-03-11,0,xvfAxe6F0azYjfLSm8ISMA,"There's a reason this has gone from being rated 4.5 for a big portion of 2015 to being 3.0 for most of 2017 and now hovering around 3.5.

I went with a party of 4 on a Saturday night.  It was not terribly busy, maybe a little more than half full.  First off, our server was absolutely abysmal.  I forget her name but if I can figure it out I'll edit this review and include it.

I think we had been seated for 15 minutes before she even came over the first time.  By this point we were pretty much ready to order but we were in no rush (or so we thought).  She took drink orders then went to get them.  After an unusually long time she dropped them off and then, before we even had the opportunity to say we wanted to order she said ""I'll give you a little bit before I take your order"".   Our menus were closed by this point and she runs off again.  

A few minutes later she comes back and we start to order.  One of our party gets their appetizer order in, then another has a question about what is in a certain dish.  She doesn't know so she runs off to find out from the chef before taking any other orders.  A few minutes later she comes back and tells us and we finish our appetizer order.  She's about to run off and we stop her to say we're ready to order the entrees as well, so she takes that order.  When repeating it back it turns out she left off an entree so we have to correct that.

We get our appetizers fairly fast, but nobody was really impressed.  I got mozzarella fritti which is fried mozzarella in a marinara and alfredo sauce.  The mozzarella is disgusting.  It is super oozy, almost like the consistency of Kraft cheese if it was melted.  I've never had fried mozzarella this bad, even from store-bought frozen stuff.  Everyone in our party tried it and they all hated it.  Others in our group had fried calamari and they stated it was not crispy at all but soggy.  After that, we get soup. The soup was good, especially the pasta e fagioli. 

It takes a while but one of us notices a big tray with entrees on it and we're hoping it's ours.  Five minutes pass and the tray sits there until it's brought over to us.  

The penne pasta that everyone gets is served with marinara sauce, but underneath it's soaking in the water the pasta was cooked in.  I don't know anyone who would enjoy having that water there.  All the dishes look good, but one of our party got a steak and it was way overcooked -- it was well done but was supposed to be medium rare.  Not sure how that mistake gets made.  My steak was pretty good, but one of our party got chicken marsala and the chicken was super tiny.  

At the end of our meal we order dessert and it takes forever to come out.  Two of our party have to run to the airport to pick someone up and they are literally getting up to leave when the dessert arrives.  I thought the S'mores dessert was good but another in the party didn't like it.  The lime sorbet was fine.  We also got a chocolate layer cake which several of us agreed was disgusting.  It was ice cold and, thus, very hard.  Additionally it tasted like it was store bought.  The type of thing you would find at South Point's buffet or sold by the slice at the Wal-Mart bakery.  It's dressed up with some chocolate shavings but it was really not good.

All-in-all it took TWO HOURS from start to finish.  Even when we go to the steakhouse we generally tend to be in-and-out in about an hour.  The amount of time we spent here, the poor quality of the food, and the awful service leaves much to be desired.

I would not have tipped, but since the meal was comped others in the party picked up the tip so our server actually got her 15%.",ykWNHp1RXcmx6PYH921UrQ,0,0,1,lnHgz98Ro-7UAZJ-6VGfcA

Food: 

Course 1- Grilled shrimp appetizer. 3 large prawns that were seasoned well but overcooked. Oh well, i'd rather not get food poisoning. 
2- House salad with ranch. Huge portion (I got full at this point)
3- Osso Bucco. Tender, but dry. Risotto was soggy= FAIL. 
4- Tiramisu was about 95 percent whipped cream= FAIL. Was served in a white/milk chocolate bowl= WIN. Dense ladyfinger= FAIL. 2 out of 3 fails=major fail. 

I had a glass of moscato (delicious) and a tequila sunrise that was very heavy handed. Tasted like cheap tequila= FAIL 

Ambiance:

My husband and I were telling jokes that maybe the chicken got up and ran away. We didn't know what happened. When I told the waiter that the chicken was missing, he went in the back and asked the chef what happened. He had an extra piece of chicken sitting there. That was mine! The waiter brought it out and we ate it. In my opinion this whole dinner should have been comped and the manager should have come over and said how sorry he was, Times have sure changed. What happened to customer service? If I hadn't said anything I never would have gotten my chicken. I would just have had green beans and noodles. Are you kidding me?

3972392,2017-08-10,3,xvfAxe6F0azYjfLSm8ISMA,"I came to Don Vito's before a show at the South Point.  I had a reservation and was seated immediately in a very quiet restaurant with few customers at 5:15 PM.

I was brought an iced tea quickly and I asked the server a few questions before ordering.  Note that all entrées come with soup or salad.  Had I seen that I wouldn't have ordered an appetizer too but that was what I did.

First off, the bread service is quite nice but I like butter.  I was not a fan of their tomato, garlic, and olive oil sauce for putting on bread or for dipping.  It can be messy.  I'll say again, I like butter.  Next time I'll ask for butter instead. of the tomato garlic concoction.

I got the mozzarella fritti which consisted of two fried mozzarella triangles each the size of a half sandwich.  The two pieces rested on marinara and and Alfredo sauces.  This was quite good and a really nice start.

Then came the pasta e fagioli.  The server asked me if I wanted grated cheese and it was spooned onto the soup to my liking.  The soup had good flavor but it could have been hotter.  It was just above lukewarm.  Meanwhile, I was wiping my oily fingers in the napkin from the bread accompaniment.

The main course was homemade ravioli parma.  The menu describes it as, ""Hand Filled with Prosciutto, Sun Dried Tomato, and Ricotta Finished in a Vodka Sauce.""  The ravioli were as soft as could be and the ricotta was superb.  There was no sign of any prosciutto nor did it have the wonderful sun dried tomato taste I expected.  This dish also had grated cheese spooned on to my liking.

For dessert, I went with their cappuccino cheesecake which was outstanding.  The coffee flavor was very evident in the cheesecake.

Service was on point.  My iced tea was topped off several times.  There could have been a little longer time between courses but this varies with people.  Roxanne was my server and she did a fine job.",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,9,8,3,k9zc7hJpZuirUJKQjCSZdw

The sausage was very good and the sauce wasnt bad. I wouldnt order it again but it was ok. id give it a 3.5 stars. The salad that i recieved before the food was excellent. It was the best pre-dinner salad that ive probably had or atleast the best ive had in a very long time. Service was really good also.",6oJzbP6dqPYoaSuCNKaITw,0,0,3,B-igA6VT44ArS3Mnfb3mKQ

4613256,2015-03-31,0,xvfAxe6F0azYjfLSm8ISMA,"I celebrated my daughter's 21st birthday here last night. It was a very nice dining experience. Gian was our waiter. He was friendly, knowledgeable & attentive. He made some great menu & wine suggestions which I appreciated very much because I'm not an Italian food connoisseur nor am I wine expert..but I am an expert at drinking it! Lol

We started witg fresh bread & a ""bruschetta like tappenade"" ....Oh..it was soooo good! I've never had anything quite like it..The bruschetta was sweet,  surrounded by garlic cloves, full of flavor & slam dunked in a delicious flavored olive oil. I literally could have just eaten bread & sipped on pinot noir all evening & I would have been completely satisfied..speaking of pinot..I went with Ian's suggestion. I got a bottle of La Crema...Very delicious! My daughter agreed. A little sweet & fruity...I could taste a hint of cherry & possibly blackberry. I would order it again...We also received a very yummy Caesar salad. I enjoyed it very much.

I ordered Angelo chicken per Gian's suggestion. It was chicken breast with a white wine sauce with artichoke & mushroom. It was tasty but I wasn't blown away. It also came with string beans..I felt a bit more effort could have been put in these. They were just steamed with no seasoning. A little salt, pepper, onions, & maybe a few other things would have made them more interesting. It was a good meal overall though..Oh..& penne pasta with marinara sauce was also served with my meal. I don't really eat a lot of pasts but I tasted it & it was pretty good. My daughter ordered her favorite, spaghetti & meatballs. She loved it...I had a bite and I agree with her..very tasty! Homemade sauce for sure...

The finale was when Gian served me daughter a beautiful & delicious chocolate cake. He sent her off with some kind birthday wishes as well...I really appreciated it & so did my daughter. We devoured the cake! The chocolate shavings made it extra memorable as well as the presentation...it was served with class & the cake was put together well.

I did forget to mention that the restaurant itself is classy. The ambiance was very inviting. The restaurant is spacious & has dim lighting. I'm sure that a many of romantic dinners have been shared there. I'd definitely go back when I'm in the area. Don Vito s made my daughter's birthday memorable in the best way possible.

This is a very mixed review.   The bread was wonderful and fresh.  We ordered the chicken marsala.  Delicious chicken and sauce.  Very much enjoyed.  We also ordered the chicken parm.  Now the chicken was tender but the marinara sauce served with it was horrible.  It tasted like it came from a jar.  Think of Ragu or chef boy ardee or one of those brands. Not much effort put into the sauce at all. I could have doctored up better sauce at home.  The tuscan chicken was good.  Service was spotty.  We either received lots of attention or no one around.  It also took a while to get our food. So A-ok overall.....this could easily be a 4 star with some effort.  Not sure I would go back.

It's been awhile so we decided to go for Italian food here tonight. Servers were nice and attentive but the wait for the food was really long. On top of that the prices have gone up A LOT since we've been here. 

Lobster Milanese - Best Lobster Milanese I've had. Lobster tail is pounded then battered and fried nice and crispy. Served with soup or salad and penne pasta

Chicken Marsala - Good. Chicken is moist and sauce was perfectly seasoned served with broccolini, soup or salad, and penne pasta

Salmon - ok. Was a bit on the dryer side served with pesto on top and a side of broccolini, soup or salad, and penne pasta

Linguine and clams - good. Very big location with lots of clams

Skirt steak - ok. Comes with soup or salad and side of penne pasta

Best thing they have going for them here is the delicious garlic cloves and tomato balsamic oil that come with the complimentary bread and toasted crackers and the Lobster Milanese. If I ever craveddddddd the Lobster Milanese and the garlic dip that would probably be my only reason to come back here. That's a big maybe too since it went from being like $30 to now $45.

The ceasar salad was really good, and The en tree's were competitively priced in world of ""fine dining Italian"" which is all pretty cheap. The one thing that stopped Vito's from being one of the best Italians I've been to was the deserts. They were all relatively plain and the ones we ordered pretty much sucked. I suggest you stay away from the wild cherry ice cream for it was badly frost bitten and even if it wasn't it would be terrible. They're best desert is no doubt the tiramisu by looks and the hype the waiter gave it. 

The service was spot on besides that the waiter forgot our app and remembered it and admitted his fault instead of blaming it on the kitchen like most would do. He then immediately brought it out and even took it off the check which was really cool.

We didn't know where to go and my boyfriend suggested Don Vito's.  We had dinner here once before about five years ago and felt it was just okay at the time.  The only reason why we decided to come back here again was because it was around the corner from my step dad's house.

Normally, it's customary to have a reservation at Don Vito's, especially during Christmas Day.  When we got there, we were very lucky to have been seated by the hosts.  Either it was out of Christmas Day kindness or maybe because we got there at 4pm and not many people had made any reservations for that time.  What ever the reason, we're very happy we got seated.

The decor was very intimate and very elegant, matching with the service and host.  If I was to say some sort of constructive criticism, it would be to lighten it up a little bit.  The ambiance has a very romantic feel to it and I can imagine first dates, someone being proposed to, etc.  

We were immediately served with water and appetizer of bread with garlic and tomatoes with olive oil and balsamic vinegar.  The appetizer was definitely something worth remembering.  The taste was awesome and I could eat it all day if it was right in front of me every day.  For my main course, I ordered Eggplant Parmesan:  Lightly Breaded and Oven-Baked with Marinara Sauce, Mozzarella and Ricotta Cheeses.  It was very good and not too oily.  Sometimes this dish is prepared with too much olive oil and hard to eat.  I was very pleasant and chowed it all down.

My boyfriend ordered Cappellini Pomodoro:  Angel Hair Pasta with a Fresh Tomato & Basil Sauce.  This is very different to see because he's a very meaty kind of a person.  I wasn't sure if he was going to like it but he was so in love with it.  If he could marry it, he would.  The whole plate was emptied out, I was almost jealous I didn't order it.  My step dad ordered the Vegan Vito's:  Whole Wheat Penne Pasta, Fresh Vegetables.  He was also very pleased.  

In the end, all three of us were very impressed and hands down would want to come back for more.  More than likely we'll be back here for Christmas this year.",QeZmjeEefdJ3bdbAeIHfWA,2,2,5,oFBE7-Lst-tUeKGAR68Q3Q

We arrive and proceed to have some fun gambling, people watching, etc. Dinner time comes around on day two and we've planned to follow the advice of my parents-in-law and eat at Don Vito's.

We arrive at a much larger than expected casino and park in the parking garage.... right inside the entrance on the right is Don Vito's... very convenient so far!

It's a Sunday evening around 9:30 PM... not too busy at all. In fact, the place closes at 10PM so we're glad we got in when we did. The place has an old school charm to it, but it's not old fashioned. Tastefully decorated and well appointed. The staff is excellent... knowledgeable and personable. The waitresses' assistant goes out of his way to make sure we're taken care of. And I haven't even gotten to the food yet..

The food was excellent! We started with the Artichoke Franchese.. my wife wanted to compare it with her Nana's authentic Italian recipe. While 
it was pretty darned good, she said it didn't quite reach the level of her Nana's. The pasta fagioli soup was the best I've ever tasted.... flavorful, hearty, delicious! My wife enjoyed it just as much.

My main course was Seafood Diavolo on the recommendation of our waitress... it was either that or the Lobster Milanese. I think either would have been an excellent choice. The Seafood Diavolo was deliciously spicy and full of large plump shrimp and scallops, and huge pieces of lobster. My wife chose the Chicken Angelo... on her mother's recommendation, and with a little push from the waitress. She thoroughly enjoyed it as well.

Even though we were stuffed, we ended up ordering dessert... to go! Canoli and Creme Brulee... neither disappointed, even the day after.

The best part about this whole meal wasn't the delicious food or excellent service... it was the incredible value. This excellent meal with appetizer, soup, dinner and dessert was $65 for two.

I can't recommend Don Vito's strongly enough.. it's a little ways south of the Strip, but well worth the short drive.",zecq0D1C283rHNRKy2Ln9w,5,0,5,q77m8KGDSdeThcHM5MPqIQ

Near the end, the butter was a bit too oily. But it was a generous serving for $38.  I opted against the 16 oz ribeye steak which was the special since they broil (not grill) their steaks.  Pasts dishes were enjoyed by those that ordered them. Entrees come with salad or soup. The caeser salads were not well receiving - the dressing was too lemony.. cheap-ish.  All served with bread basket (bread not warm, though) and a roasted garlic/tomato spread. All in all, it was a good meal an a nice setting, but not over the top.

they had a rib eye steak was perfect cooked.  The rigatoni with sausage was yummy yum with a little kick in the sauce.  The lobster was just okay.  We enjoyed the Cesar salad with anchovies.

5373716,2011-11-21,0,xvfAxe6F0azYjfLSm8ISMA,"The South Point is the king of drawing in people. During a time of scaling back and living a more modest lifestyle, this casino invites guest in with meal specials and giveaways. They also have no problems with combining offers. My dad had received a cash value comp and had a two for one entree coupon and they accepted both. With them practically giving food away, how good could it be? Surprisingly enough, it was worth the full price they would be charging.

We started our meal with an order of Calamari Fritto. It was not the best I have ever had, but very generous. The batter was too doughy, leaving an odd finishing texture on the tentacle pieces. My dad had ordered the Medium Rare Veal Chop. Are you sure that came from a young cow? This bone in cut was enormous. The meat was tender with a thin sliver of fat to lock in all the flavor. Served on top of a bed of green beans with a side of sauteed onions, it was a feast. If that was not enough, it comes with pasta in marinara and a side salad or soup. My mom got the Cioppino, it was thickened with a little cream and had a copious amount of seafood. The stew had half a lobster tail, scallops, clams, mussels, large prawns, and calamari. Throwing in some linguine and it is a meal big enough for two. We shared it and there was still enough to take home. I got the Gnocchi, sub marinara instead of the regular cream sauce. The tomato base made for a fresher and lighter flavor. The potato pasta were fluffy and not as dense as I would expect for the size. I ended up packing this to go. Both of these last dishes come with a side salad or soup as well. 

After an enjoyable meal, the only complaint comes from the billing issue, but even that can be overlooked due to a delicious meal.",N3oNEwh0qgPqPP3Em6wJXw,0,0,4,dPZNkxz3vb9px66BjJlBgg

Not only was it more than enough for both of us, but it was delicious.  Their bread basked and roasted garlic tomato mix it comes with is also very good, even the Caesar was nice.

 Main dishes are large portioned but I wouldnt split a plate because they charge $10 for two people to share 1 meal. $10 is cheaper than any meal on the menu but id rather be adventurous and get two plates and try both dishes. And you can always take your leftovers home. Amazing dishes as far as what I ordered. My husband enjoyed his as well. 
( I had the chicken copa )

The cappuccino cheesecake is shareable size and served with fresh berries. Very elegant place. Yes its pricy 18 and up per plate but its an authentic italian restuarant. Its not olive garden. 

To quote someone elses review, yes going to steak and shake would be cheaper to feed a whole family. But the two are NOT comparable. A burger joint vs italian fine dining. So just know what youre willing to pay so you arent suprised when the bill comes. 

I would def come back again. Not to mention the service was fantastic.",sjKBOG3hJLsX_4lfcUNBdg,2,1,5,5l6GKjpT67AlQmGXouaUMA

I had the seafood pasta in the spicy tomato broth and the pasta was cooked perfectly al dente, and the seafood was perfect and flavorful.  Normally seafood in this type of dish is overcooked.  My husband had the ravioli and again, was cooked perfectly.  The tomato cream sauce tasted fresh.

Another highlight is the tomato / garlic relish they serve with the bread, fabulous.

While this may not compare to some of the high end italian places in town but we have never had a better prepared meal in town for the price.  The wines were also wonderful and decently priced.

Look for the South Point January mailer for a buy 1 meal get 1 free here, it makes this restaurant an even greater bargain.",PomQayG1WhMxeSl1zohAUA,3,3,5,cKlwL8_9gDPKdJodpbiKcg

I am sure wait staff might have been on an 'off' night (we all have had them).
When the business takes time to ask 'how to do better', I have to give them extra points.  We all need to learn from our mistakes.  I will give this place another try.

I wasn't very hungry so my wife and I decided to split the chicken parm and get soup, salad, and the stuffed mushrooms. I asked the waitress if she could split the entree in the back. She said they could but they would be an extra charge for the splitting.
