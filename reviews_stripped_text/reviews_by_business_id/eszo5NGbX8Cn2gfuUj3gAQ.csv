When they ask you mild or hot ask for the green sauce. Both the red and green sauce are homemade both are delicious but the green sauce is absolutely amazing!

I was introduced to Tacos El Compita #2 by a coworker and I have been addicted ever since. Mexican food is usually good if the spot is hood, and this place is no different. It's a hole in the wall but the food is tasty and cheap. They got the BEST carne asada, period. The Pastor is no slouch neither, real flavorful and saucy. I always get the 5 tacos for $5.25 and a Mexican Coke. They also got mulitas which are like open face tacos but they add cheese and another tortilla on top with avocado. You won't find that anywhere else around here.

I would probably eat here everyday if it was closer to my house. It's that good and I LOVE me some mexican food! Damn my mouth watering just thinkin bout it!",WptCfZ_h6pdnkBJx4ha8Aw,1,0,5,bK7Z3eOfAZYDee-yclhVpA
125381,2016-04-09,0,eszo5NGbX8Cn2gfuUj3gAQ,"I've been going to this place for about 5 years.  I come here for the Carne Asada Tacos with everything (red sauce, chopped onions, cilantro).  They are street taco style meaning the meat is placed on two small corn tortillas. The Carne Asada (grilled steak) is traditional and flavorful.

They made this place bigger over a year ago so you can sit inside and eat. You order at the counter and pick it up from the counter when it's ready.  I recommend bringing cash even though they have a visa/credit card sign on the glass door.  It used to be hit or miss if it works so I just bring cash. 

I've been to other taco places in Las Vegas and as far as street tacos go, this is my second favorite and it's not as expensive as other high end taco places. The salsa bar is the same as you would find in different taco chains in Las Vegas except here it is very fresh and well kept.  I highly recommend it.  Oh yes, my kids had Chicken Quesadillas.

Located right of the Summerlin Pkwy and Buffalo, this little place has a facade of no thrills but oh what a surprise you get. The menu is small but the food you receive is probably one of the best. The place has only a few tables and a bit of a funky smell, like it used to be a chinese take-out or something, but don't let that distract you. After ordering you notice that the service is extremely quick, like McDonald's quick, (I went on a Monday night around 8pm) and the little salsa bar with their different condiments is concise with pico de gallo, fresh cut wedges of limes, a green chile sauce, and a rich red chili sauce. I ordered the carne asada burrito and the five pack soft tacos with carnitas, carne asada, and lengua. All I decided to take them home to enjoy and what a surprise it was. Each and every one of the tacos were still soft and tender. The meats, no matter if it was the asada, carnitas, or lengua, had a slight roasted smoky flavor with a little kick. It didn't take me long to devour all the tacos. Next it was onto the carne asada burrito. All I can say is wow! Same great taste, smoky, juicy, and downright better than many of the other Mexican burrito joints in town. All I could do was nom, nom, nom!

So I came in to judge a bean burrito. That's it. I figure if a taco shop can't make a decent bean burrito then why trust them with such intricate creations as tacos or tortas (or God forbid, a quesadilla).

It was good. Real good. And unique. A little smaller than a Berto's bean, and a little looser and with white cheese instead of yellow, but good. The salsa bar is good for a un-gourmet shop. The red and green salsas have tons more flavor than other places, and tons less bacteria aswell thanks to the refrigerated holder. Who would've thought, keeping ready to eat foods at decent temperatures. Shocking!

The pico is good, and FREE! A little too much onion and the few tomatoes weren't quite ripe enough, but I'm not complaining. Not bad. 

Then the tacos came. 1.25 each for choice of meat. I did the Asada and Carnitas, and I'd do it all again, dammit! Little TJ street style tacos with just the right amount of seasoning on the meat. I'm serious, try a bite before you salt it up. 

These went great with the accoutrements. Perfectly paired. 

So for around $5 I had a great, tasty lunch. I might come back for dinner. 

...and somewhere off in the sunset, in a dry and dusty land, a chain taco shop is crying because they just lost their best customer- except on $1 chicken taco Wednesdays, por supuesto...",Gu-rR-zYcWo3mPPkUHXUrA,3,3,4,1qQbRFzmjrC5X1Zb8LYIAg
1182816,2010-10-08,0,eszo5NGbX8Cn2gfuUj3gAQ,"I stopped here with a friend who was familiar with the place and raved about their carne asada burritos.  The dine-in area is very small, and the few tables were not wiped cleaned.  Since it was a nice day we ordered our food to go and ate at a picnic table at a nearby park.  

As a sort of appetizer, we ordered a couple of mulitas.  These are kind of like little tortilla sandwiches that have cheese, onion, avocado, salsa, and the meat of your choice.  We got ours with BBQ pork (pastor).  They were awesome and just $1.50 each.

I try to avoid beef as much as possible so I ordered the mole poblano with chicken, which at $7.99 is one of the most expensive items on the menu.  However, when I saw my friend's burrito, it did look appetizing.  So appetizing, in fact, that I had to try a bite. It had been two or three years since I had a carne asada burrito, but I can't say I've ever tasted a better one.

As for my main dish, the chicken was covered with the mole sauce, and rice and beans were served on the side, along with some slices of fresh avacado.  It had also been awhile since I'd had mole and I was not disappointed.  It hit the spot.  

I know I'll be back here on a pretty regular basis -- whenever I want authentic, delicious Mexican food at a very affordable price.

The shame of it is that both of these problems are easy to avoid, the restroom by obvious means and the sewer gas problem by making a vent to the outside so the cooking ventilator does not cause undue low pressure in the facility.

When the guy told me the price of less than 4 bucks I thought to myself that I should have ordered another one. I was right. The tacos were small (i.e., think three-bite taco) but tasty. I was disappointed when I first saw them because they had a red sauce on them and I'm a green salsa type of girl. However, the sauce had a nice smoky flavor. Not my favorite tacos ever, but I think I'll give them another try.

They had a salsa bar with red and green salsa, pico de gallo, radishes, onion, lime, and pickled carrots. I got some of everything. However, I didn't end up eating the salsas because the tacos were already very flavorful. I only got like one piece of carrot because the container was about empty. I don't think the guy at the counter spoke a ton of English because when I told him the carrots were about empty he just smiled and nodded.",wc4XAA5pC3b1UgooSypHwA,2,2,3,NQEslkaHDcLcF9K_Mi7LwA

2662721,2015-04-22,20,eszo5NGbX8Cn2gfuUj3gAQ,"Not gonna lie, this place looked sketchy as heck from the outside and inside, but sometimes the dingiest hole in the walls offer up the best food and my fiancé and I were feeling adventurous enough to chance it. 

To our surprise, they offered up tasty and flavorful authentic Mexican cuisine. I also learned that they're actually a small chain: with 3 locations in Vegas (Charleston, Tropicana and this location on Westcliff) and there is also a location in Los Angeles that's poppin off popular sharing most of the same menu offerings.

Here's what we tried: 

* al pastor tacos - street style, mini soft taco, very flavorful, moist meat. 5/5

* carne asada tacos - street style, mini soft taco, great asada and charred flavor, but meat is a tad on the dry, chewy end. 3/5

* al pastor mulitas - it's like a mini quesadilla! Super cheesy with moist al pastor meat and a little bit of avocado sauce. I was shocked by how much flavor was stuffed in that little guy! 5/5

* mole chicken enchiladas - holy mole-y it was delicious! The mole sauce was very thick, slightly sweet and flavorful. Plus the shredded chicken inside was moist. The enchiladas came with a tiny side of rice and beans which were both average. I enjoyed the mole sauce and loved the savory sweet combination of flavor, but to some, they may find it too sweet. 5/5

* chile verde nachos - The chips are fried fresh and super crispy - my favorite part of this dish. The nachos are topped with moist and flavorful pork, guacamole, sour cream, pickled serranos, beans and lots of malty cheese. It's a serious meal in itself! 4/5

* salsa bar - all of your usual suspects: red hot sauce, salsa verde, pico de gallo, pickled jalapeños, lime, pickled oregano onions. My favorites were the salsa verde, pickled jalapeños and pickled onions. Unfortunately, nothing was very spicy. 3/5

Do not pass on the the horchata! They have the most delicious horchata I've tried yet! Bold flavor and not watered down like every other place. I see myself cruising by just for a cold, refreshing horchata since they are 5 min from home. This could be dangerous! 5/5

As you guessed, this place is cheap! My fiancé and I left stuffed with lots of leftovers for about $24 and change.",u_wqt9RshdZsoj8ikLqoEQ,24,23,4,-sRSxna_Z7wA2ky3txSqMw

2931839,2011-01-03,0,eszo5NGbX8Cn2gfuUj3gAQ,"Hidden behind a gas station in a run down strip mall, Tacos El Compita #2 does not make a strong first impression.  The restaurant itself feels a little run down with a very cramped space and a tiny amount of tables, which appear to only occasionally be wiped down.

Given all of that, Tacos El Compita #2 requires a leap of faith.  But give the place a chance and you will experience the best carne asada burrito in Las Vegas.  Yes.  The BEST.  Now, I don't give that title out lightly.  There are some good Latin places around this Valley, but this taqueria's cooking out does them all.

Why?  The secret is how the place cooks the meat for the burrito.  Rather than tossing the steak on a grill as orders come in, Tacos El Compita #2 keeps the steak mixed into a spicy soup.  Kept on a separate stove just below simmering, the steak has been stewing in a delicious, spicy tomato-based soup.  And when the sauce is drained off and the carne asada is placed alongside the rice, beans and cheese, it's over-the-top delicious and spicy and flavorful.  You will have to remind yourself that you're in a taqueria after you start eating because you just don't expect this level of flavor from a small hole in the wall.

Since I moved to Henderson, this place is about 40 minutes away from me.  But it doesn't matter.  We make the drive.  It's just that good.",WPNYp3IyJpOSJ4bhFbYAcw,6,6,5,hGwpYggqNUTMgJZzV8N-PA

2934886,2016-12-08,1,eszo5NGbX8Cn2gfuUj3gAQ,"I feel compelled to give ppl the yellow light on the chili verde nachos. I searched yelp for nachos because I was in the mood, and it led me to this place and a bunch of rave reviews for the CV nachos. 

I have no horror story. I just want to say they're not worth it and you'd literally have to pay me to eat them again. 

They looked kinda small when I first saw them, but, when I started eating, it was clear that three ppl could happily split this as an appetizer. 

The word that pops in my head when I attempt to describe the flavor is ""tangy"". I asked for light sour cream and, as the picture shows,  they didn't over do it. But all I remember flavor-wise is tanginess. There were small bits of pork in it (so small). This costs 8.46 tax included, and the other reviews kinda make it clear that you can get a lotta meat at this shop for $8 by other methods (tacos, burrito, plate, etc.). This is highway robbery compared  amount of meat you get on a $6 order of nachos at any other hole in the wall or fast food joint. Speaking of fries, these nachos have potato? in them. I should have taken a picture but I was so underwhelmed by the dish that I had no desire to. Small (but significantly larger than the pork bits), soft chunks of potato throughout the nachos. They weren't bad, but I just didn't understand why there were potatoes in my nachos. 

So yeah, if you come here, and want to try the chili verde nachos, maybe split it with two friends. Maybe, I'm the strange person and everybody else loves it, but, after eating them, I don't get it. Also another review mentioned spice. I'm not spice blind. I can handle very spicy food but I also appreciate the lil kick I get from a packet of fast food hot sauce. I remember no heat in this dish. It was just a whole plate of Why. Just my body asking why I was doing this. It didn't taste good, wasn't good for me, just eating it, trying to figure out why ppl liked it.",iG-V0nBbeD-pnIcquXH5YQ,3,1,2,rwvZ5_EcQMXuENOh9w7v1w

This is the second outlet of the original Tacos El Compita on Charleston and Jones  (http://www.yelp.com/biz/tacos-el-compita-las-vegas)

The food is just as authentic and good as the original.  It is much smaller then the original with less seats so if you go during lunch or dinner rush you may have to wait for a seat.  That contributed to the half-star deduction as well as the fact they do not have aguas frescas or fresh jalapenos both of which they have at the original location.

yuh yeah.

Taco El Compita is like Mexican spots in LA, offsetting appearance, shady business plaza, and smells like chlorine when you enter. Its going to take some guts to jump in and give it a try if you're used to spots like Baja Fresh or Qdoba. Once you're in though, YOU'RE IN... assuming that you like more authentic Mexican food and have no intentions of ordering carne asada fries. 

From my experience with the carnitas, carne asada , and pollo they are a bit spicy and kind of have a tomato taste. The tacos are tiny, but they are soft, have intense flavor, and only cost 12 pesos (1 USD)! The burrito however is not tiny, you could probably fit a Taco Bell grilled stuffed burrito in it. Anyways my carne asada burrito was filled with rice, beans, onions and well carne asada, none of that sour cream and guacamole nonsense. 

The salsa bar is pretty small, but definitely has all the essentials, pico di gallo, lime wedges, green salsa, and red salsa. Service was quick and prompt.

If it adds to anything I always see Hispanic customers here, so maybe they think its legit too. 

SMALL SMALL SMALL thing that bothers me though is that the menu board facing the cooks and not where the customers are facing.",kDGhswMrYIOaFJAViW_nCA,0,0,4,Q6RLmV9sJkm05w7UHvqdJQ

In each city I have lived I have found the best tacos in town, and then become a regular customer. 

When I moved to Vegas, I was admittedly nervous -- I can't live without good tacos and Vegas is big... it could take months to find the best. Luckily, it didn't. It took two weeks (and 3 great reviews from Latino friends) to find Tacos El Compita. 

 The food is fresh, authentic, flavorful and juicy! It is just greasy enough to be good  Mexican food, but not so much as to cause post-lunch regret. 

I recommend the mulitas, typically with carne asada, or some chicken tacos. (Be warned, the chicken tacos can be a bit spicy if you order them with everything ... but OH SO DELICIOUS).

I wanted to beat the lunch rush so I could get a table, so I got there around 11:30.....perfect timing.  I was the only non-Mexican patron in the restaurant (out of 12 people).

There are four 4 Top tables and one 2 Top table in the restaurant.  I snagged a 4 Top right in front of the counter and ordered a Carne Asada Burrito & a Carne Asada Taco.  Out of the corner of my eye I noticed a Jarritos Orange Soda in the cooler....of course I had to get one......sweetened with natural sugar & not HFCS, it's one of my fav's.

While I was waiting for my food, I went to the Salsa bar and prepared some Red (Hot), Green (Mild), and Pico de Gallo Salsa.  It's a small Salsa bar, but what it lacks in quantity it makes up in quality.  Then I no
ticed in the cooler an odd bottle that said ""Sangria"" on it.....What the Frijoles? (see pics)  So, I went to investigate.....turns out it's ""non-alcoholic"".....dammit, fools gold!  Who would drink that???  blech!

Within a few minutes my food was ready.  I went for the Taco first.....devoured it in 3 bites.....it was amazing!  The Carne Asada is marinaded with the same flavor I remember back in So Cal.....I think I found Taco Nirvana!  Then I went for the Burrito.....it's a nice size for $3.99, great value.  The Burrito didn't disappoint either!  It was amazing!  A quick note for the Gringos....if you order the Burrito with ""Everything"", it will already have Hot (Red) Salsa inside the Burrito....and it's pretty spicy, so if you're sensitive to that, tell them without salsa.  The Burrito had Carne Asada, Beans, Rice, Salsa, and Onions in it.....good proportions of all ingredients too.  Just like the Taco, the Asada's flavor was just right.

Overall, this place has just launched itself to the top of my Taco Shop list.  Thanks @Jennifer R for that review!

So I LOVE tacos and any Mexican food for that matter; they have GREAT food here! The price, quality, and quantity is ace! Everything was seasoned PERFECTLY! I got the muelitas and ordered some carne asada tacos for my son. I went to the salsa bar and was a little hesitant to get salsa (I'm a visual eater and this didnt look yummy) but I got some anyway along with some limes. I went and got my beloved horchata and was in heaven because it was a self serve!! I took one drink and seen cherubs!! It was def love! 

We got home and I salsa and limed up my muelitas and took a bite; I swear the earth stopped for like 5 seconds and I seen angels flying around!! PERFECT! Thank goodness I got the hot salsa because it was delish!!!! The muelita melted in my mouth and I was in love; I couldnt get enough! The carne asada, cheese, and avocado was totally mastered! My sons carne asada tacos were wonderful! We ate all the food up!

The place is pretty large and just a plain seating area. Remember! Youre going for the food, and not the ambiance!! I've been to super pricey restaurants and the food was hella shitty!

The tortillas was good but very greasy from the grill. The carne asada was over cooked and dried out...flavor was bland not what you would expect from a Mexican place! Greasy food is not something I like and this qualifies as greasy! I love spicy bold flavors and I was not impressed at all!

Great salsa bar that has, thank God, pico de gallo.  Most places just have the runny salsas - but I like the chunky pico de gallo.  Adds a lot of crispiness and freshness to any mexican food.

It looks a little shady for this particular area but not as bad some of the places on the east side or in North Las Vegas. The store front is very unassuming and a bit run-down. When you walk in, it's borderline hole-in-the-wall but clean for its age and condition. I love these places really. It usually means the food is good; this place did not disappoint.

I was greeted by a Hispanic woman behind the counter who thought I was Hispanic also, as she started speaking to me in Spanish. When I replied back in English, she did her best to communicate with me in English but it was difficult to understand through the thick Hispanic broken English. The cook jumped in the conversation to make sure I was ordering what I wanted. Another good sign this was going to be a good place to eat; it's authentic!

For this visit I went with three tacos; the asada, pastor, and pollo, along with a side of tortilla chips and 500ml made-in-Mexico Coca Cola served in a bottle (this means it was made with sugar, not the high fructose corn syrup). I came in at a quiet time too as I was the only customer in the restaurant. So that was good.

I picked my table and in a few minutes, my order was ready. The street-style tacos were served on a paper plate and the tortilla chips in a closed styrafoam container. I took my time eating each one. Very flavorful and delicious.
