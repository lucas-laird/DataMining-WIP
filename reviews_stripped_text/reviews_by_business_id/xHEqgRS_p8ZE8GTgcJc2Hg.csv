We only go because of the excellent customer service that we get, especially from Manuel and from the other staff as well. Our orders are always correct and the food is always hot.  A great location to visit..KUDOS to the staff!",BdltlS9pl8xKcMXfy2yL9Q,0,0,5,6yQrUJfSmpN4yO_CaK4unA

I was in a hurry that's why I picked this place instead of ordering with a real restaurant and it was a mistake.  The egg rolls were decent but price a little steep for fast food restaurant.  The teriyaki bowl was awful,  too salty I ate only few bites and had to throw it away. I won't go back.",Dznff28TRq2RB3Wbx42ufw,0,0,1,Y2pQIo3cgMrvgGYQ5t0Vfg

1562558,2014-10-08,0,xHEqgRS_p8ZE8GTgcJc2Hg,This jack in the box is horrible. Every time I go they mess something up and it's always something very simple. Last time I ordered a jumbo jack with cheese got home no cheese. So this time I think to myself I'll outsmart the jumbo jack guys and check to see if I got cheese and yep there's cheese phew. Get home and bam no kind of condiments on the burger what so ever. Please avoid this jack in the box.,5tUTA6cJE3zZgubfm-lA4Q,0,0,1,W7syO8dfsEhkx7-qx8A0xw
1976002,2010-11-21,4,xHEqgRS_p8ZE8GTgcJc2Hg,"this sucks that I have to write this sucky review because this is my neighborhood jack in the crack.  

drive thru: don't usually have a problem with the drive thru... [tho I did have an incident last year with one guy who got really anal about taking a coffee order after I had driven away from the squawk box.  after I had refused to drive back around.. and make another order [yes, per his instruction] I threatened to scrap my order all together for having the audacity to tell me to do so.  after my husband said his piece..  he finally agreed to add it to our order, before making a smart ass remark about 'the next time..'  I swear I was bout to go mcnugget mad on this  and put my fist through the window for that nonsense! 

I never saw him again.  he freaking acted like I forgot an order of 13 meals.  it was just coffee. it was just coffee dude.  I was dumbstruck because dumb asses rub off on me!  ugh.  best of luck in life buddy.  it is not that serious.

eating inside: hmph.. what can I say.  the employees are not geniuses... and it obvious.  there's like 2 ppl who understand what customer service is and the rest who didn't make it to that training. 

so 2 stars to those employees. 

we walked in one night for dinner.. and a girl was standing at the in between the counter and the kitchen.  it was jack in the box so we knew what we wanted and were ready to order as soon as we came in.  her rude ass I think was working drive thru this night.. so letting us know that someone else was gonna come out to help us was out of the question.  instead, she turned her pink underwear, big butt, low rider jean wearing ass and acted like we weren't there.  

after we told her we were ready to order, is when she called the other lady.. [a much older woman] who I'm
glad to say was apologetic and friendly... 

tables in this particular jack n the box could be better kept.. we had to ask the lady to wipe a table for us before we sat down. 

sigh..  I always hope that a neighborhood chain does justice.. but that's just one to many fails when it comes to customer service. idk who the he'll is hiring? mcdonalds maybe? but.. gaaaaah!  get it together!",Nw6Jza_cb0aqd4PT769Vzw,0,0,2,uCXzLPtopbbdKpzPZzKznA
2347090,2017-09-10,0,xHEqgRS_p8ZE8GTgcJc2Hg,"My two stars are for the nice kid that placed my order correctly and the manager who politely gave me my refund. The missing stars are because there was one car in the drive thru and no people in the restaurant when I walked in yet tables were dirty, food was slow and when my sandwich came out it was missing the cheese. I sent it back and it came back with two cold pieces of cheese. I seriously can't tell you the last time I asked for a refund on anything because I usually take it on the chin but this was about as pitiful as I've seen of a sandwich.

2768018,2017-10-27,0,xHEqgRS_p8ZE8GTgcJc2Hg,"This place is a fucking joke. You have the worst employees including the managers. The staff has no clue what they are doing and the managers barely speak English. I went through the drive thru on a Monday night at 8:30pm so it wasn't busy at all. The girl working the drive thru kept getting my order wrong (I believe her name is lasonna) anyways after multiple tries of her trying to comprehend the words I was saying (born and raised in Vegas, I have no accent at all) she tells me to pull-up to the window. At the window she ask me for money for the bill and I'm like you didn't take my order...remember???? I was beyond irritated by now. She finally took my order which took another 5 minutes and then I was told to pull in front even though there was no one behind me. Whatever I pull in front and 5 minutes later the guy walks out with our order. I start backing up my car and the 3 African American people start pounding on my window and yelling so I unroll the window to see what the hell they are doing and they accuse me of calling their daughter (drive thru girl) a bitch. I could think of a few choice words for this idiot that is more fitting than bitch. Her parents continue to yell at me and pound on my car (my 4 year old was sleeping in the back) so I took off and turned around and the two workers bitch 1 and bitch 2 were standing outside laughing. So here I sit trying to make a decision while I'm in a 2 ton vehicle and all of them are on foot, but I'm not about to catch a case on the bitches at jack in the box. I called the manager who barely spoke English and she hung up on me twice so I called in the morning and spoke with the manager that was worthless so I just went to the top to corporate. These fuckers are lucky I wasn't carrying and that I had my little boy in the car because those little bitches fucked with the wrong girl.",b_WoTIrJuaYl3bw19RhQ-g,0,0,1,DUsv7KiXeYqstxQfRnHIrg
3173943,2015-12-10,5,xHEqgRS_p8ZE8GTgcJc2Hg,"So the only things I like at Jack in the box is their Munchie meals and Milkshakes.  They are both very good and fill the fast food craving.  The stacked Grilled Cheeseburger is very nice and is a meal in itself.  The included tacos and pretty good but on the greasy side.  That makes them tasty but you can feel your arteries harden with each bite.  The included fries are the mix of standard and curly but you can choose either one if you have a preference.  We also had the Chicken Tater Melt which was surprisingly delicious.  
   The Munchie Meals are $6 after 9PM which is a great deal for the amount of food you get.  The Milkshakes are creamy and delicious.  With the yummy whipped cream they are a welcome sweet treat.  I don't eat at Jack's often but when I do it is always the fast food I love and expect.  Nothing fancy just quick and good.",6H4Zj-c7FqM9mCsXvwaEQw,13,12,4,7ZBSgqVFYARg7HA9yvr_UQ

They don't even use gloves and I too work in food and beverage and when handle food we have to always use gloves no matter what! One time I went there through the drive-thru this one girl wasn't wearing glove nor did she have her hair up, this other time this was at 4am one lady was handling the trash can and the she touched my food!

On 10/6/2016 at 12 14am I went through the drive thru and the guy working with dark curly hair was one of the nicest Customer service people I've dealt with in awhile.

We got home no desert. I went back after eating told them I didn't get my churros I had my receipt ready to prove my purchase. Charmaine and the night staff were so apologetic already knew my churro story. Had them hot and ready for me. Thanks guys!

9 out of 10 times you'll be asked to ""pull up front so they can bring it out to you"", even if there's no cars behind you.
Then you get to sit and wait until one of them feels like walking out to your car.
Maybe I'm getting old, but isn't a ""Drive Thru"" supposed to prevent  finding a parking spot and sitting and waiting idea?
