I just wanted to say that i felt it nessary to write about my experience in this specific sandwich shop. (as i love sandwiches) I have been to several of the Port of Subs locations around town and never have i had the experience i received at this location. The employees were very helpful with nutritional information and great knowledge of what to substitute certian ingredients to make it fit my dietary needs.  Both girls were friendly upbeat and seemed to enjoy their jobs. (which doesn't happen alot in fast food especially on a monday during lunch)
The only thing I wish Port of Subs had was more variety of breads.",PSLmhaUY28j2ErjwMEZOcA,0,0,5,Uhp7kuMcQenYTZwIc3EcyQ

I couldn't finish eating because the bleach was too strong. I am not visiting it again anytime soon.",IABFg0AfDK9UFWubFauOXw,0,0,2,u9KlK2BkyqF5ieSo1t39tg

Cucumbers migrate to sandwiches they weren't ordered on, parts of orders are missing. Twice was enough. I won't be ordering from here again.",lEPRpL_N_i6weRTSWsfcoQ,0,0,1,UQDKYlk_Y78oG91Hc1FtHA

We were very rudely greeted with a yell of ""Hey! We're closed! Online it says we're closed now,"" and we're herded out. Lies. Everything was still on. At least if you're going to lie so you can leave early don't act so horribly. Worst port of subs I've ever been to!",MyHy1bqpsrFp6qmImB7xmQ,0,0,1,8PbkWHOl3U3P2GpYAbS6rA

I like Port of Subs, so I'm happy to have a location near my neighborhood, however I wish the service were more consistent. Both my boyfriend and I have been skimped on veggies so many times, and it's really a frustrating issue when it happens on so many occasions. For me, a sandwich is more about the layers of vegetables and the delicious seasonings with a highlight of cheese, not the other way around, so when I'm offered a few measly slices of tomato it's a little insulting. 

I'm not a high-frequency customer because there's also banh mi and salads up the street, so I only find myself motivated to eat here once in awhile given the competition.",vpSruwUEfZw_TyaTDHEFDA,1,1,3,SRc6UlkKYGsZvaJSiGIyKw
2539615,2014-06-17,0,Z1kqDvTwye4524s7oXOBgQ,"This place is really good, I eat here once or twice a week because I work in the area. Its affordable and great fresh food. Its very clean, they mop like 3 times a day and the employees are the nicest of any place I've ever been. Ask for the ""UPS special"", its a breakfast wrap with egg, turkey sausage and sliced chicken with barbeque sauce and provalone. Its the best wrap you'll ever eat.",T5ZF-ZHOxUK7ww4k0-saJg,1,0,5,-5adnJ8UH9vwG8fqoSu-6w

We use all their services; delivery, internet pick-up and stop-in.  Fast delivery, GREAT pick-up, good stop-in. We always order online. The website is easy to use and gives all the options at the store with easy to select choices.  We do always go at night 

I also like the macaroni salad and I love the pickles. I wish I knew what kind of pickles or a similar pickle. I love them.",stwmplf-HrcoPatLN7_jAA,1,0,4,V5JFXQPZ6-rNKCzLtB3oGA
4817731,2014-01-19,1,Z1kqDvTwye4524s7oXOBgQ,This location stinks. Service is ridiculous. Girl behind the counter kept asking about the tattoos my husband and I have. Rather unprofessional and pretty rude. I'm not a fan of people who try to make small talk with me in the hopes that we have something in common. This location was also dirty. Never again. I will stick with Subway.,hilL60vuuh06sMxs6Ckkog,0,0,1,SuaIVPAxjyI96Nwnh3qySw

Damen welcomed me to port of subs, my sandwich was prefect and there was no wait. I will be returning. Thank you for taking a few extra minutes to make a good experience!",UWGAOyDe_vPB8E8bIubhRA,0,0,5,CfckX5dEYKGWRH3t2BkvyA

The customer service sucks, I ordered via eat24 and they apparently they dont carry half the chips they others do. And the person in charge was confrontational. Then because I am so close to the store they offered to exchange the chips, excuse me, where I am at isnt the point, you screwed up not me! I need to find out which ones this owner has so I can make sure not to visit his stores again. *update* and for the first time messed up my sandwich. This whole order was a nightmare!",Ido0RL0wDtbZB2eToWE4hg,0,0,1,rogZbVavpAmloiJUcAcD_A
5575376,2015-08-04,0,Z1kqDvTwye4524s7oXOBgQ,I would have given a higher score but due to the heavier set blonde with the blue tooth head set she wasn't pleasant and just kinda talked to who ever doesn't focus on the task at hand and was honestly rude towards the coworker this is my second time to a port of sub and food is pretty decent. Cleanliness of the store was so so. And men's restroom is broken and the women's is poor lit. So if it was a cleaner store with good employee service I would be giving 4-5 stars,yLQqSwepH9NkQjH4luKQug,0,0,3,oh4S9eO-YTQbfyEtAB-7FQ
