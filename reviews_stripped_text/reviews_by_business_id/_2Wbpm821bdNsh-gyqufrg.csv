We have never had bad El Pollo Loco anywhere but here.  Chicken is reheated, and many times they don't have mixed pieces at dinner time!! I have had to call ahead to make sure it's available and often times it's not.  ""Do you have breasts, thighs, wings?"" The say yes but they can't put a friggin' mixed box together!

I was confused, I just put my order in. So i asked for a manager, I was just confused as to why no voids were allowed. He exclaimed that corporate doesn't allow voids. So I then asked, then how do you void it out if someone says never mind I don't want it. He says that he'd have to call and ask his manager to void it out. That's just super weird and irritating to me. So, while I'm speaking to him about my concerns he asks me to move up so that the other folks can get their food..... How RUDE! Im still a customer with concerns, deal with me first, of be polite about it sheesh! 

Definitely calling corporate on this, because its STUPID

UPDATE: called to ask for corporates #, I was put on hold for 6 mins, the associate came back on the line and said to look on the receipt for corporates number. Smh",Yi2sBdWFBdHmoPmF-3Kr2g,0,0,1,TZXnyv1X4zsGOAP4psvaXQ

3044392,2014-07-01,0,_2Wbpm821bdNsh-gyqufrg,"I went there for lunch. 6/24/14  1:35 PM

The counter girl, Liz, was charming young lady, smiling, polite and a great example of customer service.

I had a the three piece combo, two breasts and a wing, mashed potatoes and corn on cob for sides, it comes with a small drink. $8.49. 

The service, at the counter, was great. If it was based on this, 4 stars.

The food was good. If it was based on this, 3 stars.

The restaurant was a mess. The ice dispenser on the soda machine had dumped all it's ice into the tray and onto the floor (it took awhile for that much ice to be dispensed). Since it's around a blind corner, I'm surprised no one was injured rounding the corner and slipping on the ice. It was a slip and fall suit, waiting to happen.  Every napkin dispenser in the place was empty. And there wasn't a clean table in the place, looked for the least dirty one. Did I mention it wasn't busy here?

What's the manager doing? Milling about smartly, behind the counter, basically accomplishing nothing, oblivious to everything going on around him. He's standing two feet away from two empty napkin dispensers, that were already open, with a new package of napkins next to them, did he fill them, no. Did he go into the restaurant to see the ice everywhere or the dirty tables, no. Whereas Liz was the epitamy of customer service, the manager was the antithesis of customer service. When a manager reaches the point they feel they are above their crew, no longer a part of the team, too good to assist with the work, disinterested in the condition of their store, they are no longer effective.

This is an unusual situation for me, where I would have given two more stars, had I used the drive-thru, instead of going into the store. My work truck is too big for the drive-thru, so that's not an option.

Okay, I'm done ranting. I just expect a place I'm eating at, to be clean. Possible exception a picnic, but even then I bring a clean blanket, if there's no table.",rAa-LxHwU8IP989kvMUJSA,0,0,1,gKTpHB5Ql6mxTtCyRRm_5g

I was offered for 2.50 more a mix.  So my way of thinking you're out of chicken which is your business and now want to charge more for something I don't want. In my opinion ignorant people work there.  I will never go back and will always use this example when I do my training sessions on what terrible customer service is.  

If you're out of something and you offer an alternative offer the price of what you're out of and maybe a discount from that to compensate.  I will never goto your restaurant ever again.  Good luck with keeping the rest of your customers happy.",NUupIHHIHFdywLk37Rob2Q,0,0,1,Ov-sxCtY-zLP7QFIbxRqXg

The crazy chicken never lets me down with their burritos and taco platters though. Plus their taco platters come with beans and rice! That pair alone makes me full. Their burritos are hoagy. The platters have 3 soft tacos. 

Careful how you order churros. One order has 2 churros so if you say ""2 churros"" you might get 4 sticks. Make it clear, sugar fiends. 

For you spicy lovers their jalapeno hot sauce is perdy good. I tried mixing it up with the pico; works well!",JQIZhoQB-Tg9hdBEj90m4g,46,40,3,wsZRzRHEWnpeDzZ0aE386A
3320890,2015-02-06,1,_2Wbpm821bdNsh-gyqufrg,"I have just encountered the worst service I have ever received in the entire time I have been a customer at El Pollo Loco and I plan on telling all my associates and family about it.  I am going to post this on your Facebook page and add it to Yelp.

My daughter and I decided to have El Pollo Loco for dinner, one of the few ""fast food"" places I eat, mainly because it is chicken and I can see it on grill cooking so I know exactly what I'm eating.  I usually order a 2pc dark with pinto beans and a salad. 

When we arrived at the drive through it was 6:37; there was a car backing out, I should have followed her.  At 6:39, I noticed a truck get in behind us, so we were stuck.  I looked at the clock it was 6:39 and the line was at a stand still.  I know that the service is not always quick during the dinner hour, but I didn't imagine that we would not pull out of he drive through until 7:11.

Each car in front of us took at least five (5) minutes to service and we were stuck, because once you are in the drive through line, you can't get ""out"" of the line.  

When at 7:02, we pulled up to the window; Brandon the window server was very casual and nonchalant.  He took our money and disappeared for six (6) minutes before he came back.  No apology for taking up more than 30 minutes of my time and when I stated to him that we were in line for over 30 minutes, he just laughed and said. ""Well, the car in front of you food totaled $78 (or 70 something).""  

Huh? What did that have to with why we all had to wait, while we are stuck in a drive through with no method of escape?

I checked my bag and noticed that I didn't have the pico de gallo that I asked for, that took an additional that took an additional three (3) minutes, hence the time was now 7:11 when we drove off.

Where was the MOD or the shift supervisor?  Why didn't somebody come out and explain that they were experiencing unexpected delays, they ran out of chicken, they were training a new crew? Something would have made the wait more understandable. 

Horrible customer service.  I have lived in Las Vegas for over 15 years and El Pollo Loco became one my favorites instantly and anybody who knows me will tell you that I eat there almost weekly.  

They have now lost a very loyal customer.

Thank you for your time.

That versatility is something I love about this place, especially bc most other fast food places fail in that regard. 

Having said that, this Pollo Loco has been somewhat inconsistent for me. There've been time where I've gotten food from them and it's been perfect EPL: good, moist chicken and delicious salsa.
