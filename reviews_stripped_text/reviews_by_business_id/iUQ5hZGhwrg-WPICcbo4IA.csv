761180,2017-04-24,0,iUQ5hZGhwrg-WPICcbo4IA,I ordered tapsilog - it was so raw and rubbery. If you're afraid to cook tapsilog the way it's supposed to be cooked - take it off the menu. You  have no business with it. The meat was tough even after I asked the fry chef to recook it and the eggs were old. I asked who the manager was and the cashier did not know who it was. Imagine that. Disappointed because I go to all the other kitchens and have great food .. grand opening ?? Better close it down .,MtJbCxnvFZVxzzTU7vrHyw,0,0,1,c5k7ZHqssOB-02YuJIQrCA

1030469,2016-09-23,3,iUQ5hZGhwrg-WPICcbo4IA,"This is probably my least favorite location thus far. I grew up eating at a Aloha Kitchen and I was super excited to see one open near me, however, I was disappointed that it's not as good as the other locations. They just opened recently so I do expect change for the better. Currently this place is just the restaurant, but soon there will be a bar and gaming.

My favorite thing about this place is that the food is fresh. Everything is made to order. I love coming here for all things Spam. Their spam musubi, their spam saimin soup, and especially their spam and eggs for breakfast. Their adobo fried rice is good choice if you'd like a big order. It is fried rice wrapped in eggs. Their salad isn't great, they use cheap lettuce so it's tasteless. Their macaroni is really good, I love to add it to my orde if they don't already come with it. Their lumpia is decent if you're craving it, but it can be over fried sometimes.

Their staff is friendly and they really pay attention to their customer's needs. I have to critique this place because they are new and I hope they can improve. Their food portions are very inconsistent. One day their is too much food for me to finish by myself and other days, there is literally nothing on my plate.  I love their recipes, but I think they need to uphold the standard that the other locations have left. Quality of cooking needs to be improved. I will be gladly returning to hope they take note of their customers demand.",LTCxnnAQGaGZPHZx4KbvGA,8,6,4,R-hSv69nXNmf-dIrVQVPHw

1320529,2016-12-07,1,iUQ5hZGhwrg-WPICcbo4IA,Didn't care for the teriyaki chicken plate. Having lived in Hawai'i for 12 years I know what it should taste like for the most part.  The chicken tasted like a combination between pork rinds and some kind of other meat. The chicken was overcooked and had way too much teriyaki sauce on it. The mixed vegetables was all mostly cabbage. If you want some good teriyaki chicken I suggest Ross J's Hawaiian or hell even Teriyaki Madness.,xvJ9PaGDXsaCginJ0NX-WA,0,0,2,4Nu2zSV2HDTsriGHJioy6Q

1404224,2016-08-25,9,iUQ5hZGhwrg-WPICcbo4IA,"Aloha Kitchen is a new Hawaiian restaurant that is located on the Southeast part of town close to the Green Valley area. This is part of a larger local franchise that has several well known locations around Vegas. They had recently opened and I wanted to check them out.

They are located on the corner of Maryland and Windmill, right off the 215 exit. The interior is really clean with booths and tables. They are in the process of being approved for gaming and a liquor license, so hopefully they will be allowed to get that, which would be interesting because that would be a first for me to see such a concept. They have the standard menu that all the Aloha Kitchen's have. I ordered the Kalbi combo and waited. They also gave me some free lumpia as their grand opening special.

Lumpia - the lumpia were hot and crispy. And they were not greasy at all. The meat filling was well seasoned, and I enjoyed the taste of them.

Kalbi Combo - I thought it was good. The Katsu was crispy, yet tender. The teriyaki was moist, and the Kalbi was cooked well. I thought the Kalbi was sliced a bit thin, and the rice and Mac salad were average, but overall, it was decent.

This is a good option if you are in the area and are digging some Hawaiian food. I thought the value was fair as well.",gtwM4ijo65AN4DvXdgCu_w,18,18,4,lUlRBqhVf4Iftii5fE44Ew
1508622,2017-05-02,0,iUQ5hZGhwrg-WPICcbo4IA,"My family and I were here for the Grand Opening. We came to watch our daughter dance. I convinced my wife to stay for dinner. We waited for over an hr for our food without being informed of the wait. In the process there was repeated accuracy mistakes made with missing items. I understood that there might be a long wait. But I wasn't prepared for the bad customer service we ended up receiving. You would think after voicing my experience that they would show some kind of customer service skills but it seemed they didn't care. I asked to speak to the manager about my experience and requested a refund. I even told the manager that I wouldn't be returning with my family. I told the manager that the meal should be free due to the bad service and experience. She left to speak to her manager and returned saying a refund is all she can do. You would think a restaurant that carries Aloha in their brand would practice good customer service but there is ""No Aloha Here"" I won't be returning and neither will my family. We roll deap 20 + people. I would recommend you to go to Island Flavor or Aloha Specialties for a great Aloha experience",ioPuRDaF7UqzZwoP3Lig2A,0,0,1,XmJWBWq_ZSEkgYq2GzUJ6w

I like how they always verify their address just to make sure you're calling your desired location. They're accurate on their ETA and my orders are always correct. 
Their Teriyaki Chicken Bowl is only $3.99 but the portion is perfect for small eaters. Enough to satisfy your lunch/dinner. Spam Musubi ($1.99) is a perfect snack/side and so is their Macaroni Salad ($1.99).

3432263,2018-06-23,0,iUQ5hZGhwrg-WPICcbo4IA,"I have been to the Charleston location for both Karaoke and lunch.  I do think the food here is okay.

My co-workers told me about this location.  The one co-worker is from HI.  Every HIn bbq restaurant I like, he doesn't.  And yet he says Aloha Kitchen is really good.  Again, we have different tastes and likes in food.

I have been craving a McDonald's HI breakfast which consists of either spam or Portuguese sausage, eggs and rice.  Unfortunately, that option is unavailable everywhere else.  Because Aloha Kitchen is 24-hours and it was on my way to work, I figured I would stop in to pickup musubis.

When I got there, I wasn't sure which door to go into and not realizing it, I walked into the bar.  Super dark in there.  But just in case its your kinda thing, they have machines around the bar for you to enjoy a plate of food and drinks.  

Since it was Friday and most people were out of the office today, I decided to buy a few extra for may co-workers.  I ordered 2 of each - spam musubis @ $2.75 while the Portuguese and teriyaki chicken musubis are $3 a piece.  

After hitting all the red lights getting to the office. I did the cordial thing which was to serve the musubis first and wouldn't you know it, the two chicken ones went first.  Now, I just thought that since Vegas is the 9th Island, that everyone has at least heard of a musubi.  Wrong! So I had to explain to two of my co-workers what it was. Ah, they didn't seem enthusiastic as my other co-worker who had just moved from HI. So I have know idea what they thought of it.  Hope they didn't throw it away. 

So I finally get to my desk and feast on the Portuguese musubi. I was surprised at the amount of rice that was in it.  It was the perfect amount, where normally, other establishments have way too much rice. And because of the well portioned amount, I was able to enjoy the flavor of the Portuguese sausage and the teriyaki sauce they drizzled on it.  It was so good and because I wasn't full on the rice,, I ate the spam musubi.  

It was so good that the one I was able to bring home to my husband, even he really enjoyed it.  My co-worker from HI, well, he's going to be sure to stop there tomorrow to pickup a couple for his wife and kids.

So that's it, I just wanted to rave about their musubis.  

I'll be making it a point to get up earlier to head to Aloha Kitchen for breakfast as often as I can.",leyNDNVu09Ldbg5ujPWMhQ,1,1,3,fB0eUA8P3OlB7EQdhutSNw

And it's true! 

Hawaiian food with a Filipino touch, it for real does not get any better. 
My go-to's? Definitely the Adobo & Fried rice omelette. DO NOT SKIP THIS. I've brought several friends here over the years and the ones who don't order it, and opt for something else taste my omelette and have instant regrets. ITS THE BEST THING OUT. 

Sure, if you're Filipino this is something that seems like a no-brainer at home. But look, if I'm hungover, or not...this forreal is the best meal to get hands down. 

Also, Banana Macadamia Nut pancakes. With a thick layer of Macadamia  Nut sauce that coats the cakes-- they're mildly sweet, buttery and amazing. I was actually here back in 2012 or '13, when they were first testing the recipe and they brought my group a stack to try (before it was on the menu) o0oOOuuUuuu Exluuuusive I know (;

I work graveyard and was trying to find a different spot to eat. I heard this AK was going to be 24hrs from the other AK on Decatur. Since I do like Hawaiian food and my co-worker is also from Hawaii we figured why not? 

After midnight we have to enter through the Bar side. Ok, no big deal. 
The cashier was friendly and greeted us. I believe her name is Paris. Hi Paris!
I ordered Oxtail soup.
Co-worker ordered Fried Rice Omelet.
Mine comes out first, Gigantic Bowl of Oxtail Soup and 2 scoops of rice. It was packed with flavor! Could really taste the ginger broth. Really good!
I was tearing up my first piece of oxtail. Bones to the side, as Paris walked by and asked if we needed anything I pulled out a piece of plastic from my soup bowl. I placed it down. And she was shocked. I wasn't really upset about that piece. It clearly was a piece of plastic from the vacuum sealed package. But when I pulled out another larger piece of plastic I started having second thoughts about the cooking staff. 
Now I know accidents happen but clearly this was just careless. 
Paris insisted they make a new one. And she also gave me a free spam musubi for my...troubles?
The second bowl was clear of distractions and had extra rice. 

This was more of an experience rather than a review. So just a word of caution. Look before you eat. 

Yes I'll be back to eat there..it's convenient and the food is good. Regardless of what happened. 

I'll update my Star rating after a few more visits.

I ordered BBQ pork for my mom, and it didn't look anything like pork, it looked like beef, and it didn't even have any BBQ sauce on it. My mom took it back, they just argued with her, never asked if they could make her something else, never asked if they could refund her, the cashier just stood there and argued with her. In my opinion that's pretty rude customer service. My mom didn't ask for the manager cause her mind was just blown because of how rude they were. I'm probably never ordering from here again. Whoever the Liza gal was recently deleted the comment off of my facebook post. If that's what they call BBQ pork, I'd rather not. Thanks.",PFs0_lUg6NlQvwdjnqZhUg,0,0,1,3ZZ0HvHrLYt7Ssibqlo-ng

It's even better to take homea and eat later after that long 4-5 hour drive.,p5RcabsU9DXQEDef9RiRlQ,3,3,5,ZR_s28dbUCF8cSPnKAtDpw
