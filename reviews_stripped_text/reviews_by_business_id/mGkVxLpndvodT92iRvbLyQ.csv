The most redeeming quality about this place is the outdoor patio with its great view of the mountains,  if you can deal with the playground next door.

Got the bruschetta flatbread $4.50. It was good however it was nothing like the menu described. Description: roasted tomatoes, basil, olive oil, garlic,& Parmesan. Reality: roasted tomatoes, chopped fresh tomato, hint of mozzarella, hint of basil & lots of red onions. I would have preferred to be as it was described on the menu but it was so cheap I did not complain. Service was good and the patio is dog friendly.

2140474,2015-06-18,0,mGkVxLpndvodT92iRvbLyQ,"I would certainly give Social Bistro and Wine Bar another shot, but my experience last night was overall ""just ok.""  This is probably closer to a 3.5 star review.

It started off well enough, a cozy restaurant located in Tivoli Village. We were greeted pleasantly, and seated promptly, and initially, our server was very prompt and pleasant, even helping us with wine selections and suggesting their ""wine flight"" to help us decide (with 1 oz pours at $1.50-$3.00 each, it was a good value). 

We came in for Restaurant Week; I got the $40 option, while my friend got the $50 one. They each came with 3 courses, with a portion of the price going to 3 Square.

On appetizers, I won. I really enjoyed the ""bang bang shrimp""- I honestly could have just eaten a huge plate of these tasty morsels. Good sized shrimp, the sauce was delicious. My friend didn't enjoy the lobster mac and cheese as much. While it was full of good sized lobster chunks, it was pretty bland, and she wasn't a fan of the Ritz crackers crumbled on top.

Main courses, she won by a nose. Although her filet was a bit overdone (medium is supposed to be pink, right?), it was nicely seasoned and had a good char. My salmon was fine, a little too mushy in the center, but a good size and the sauce was interesting.

 Dessert- we both had the blueberry bread pudding. She didn't care for it at all, but I enjoyed it. She thought the blueberries were too tart and almost sour, but I rarely meet a dessert that I don't like! 

The main issue was that after we received our appetizer, service slowed dramatically. We waited and waited for main courses and for desserts. A non-romantic dinner for 2 probably shouldn't take over 2 hours in my opinion. 

Once they work out the small kinks, Social will be a great addition to the restaurant scene at Tivoli Village.",lQGJcwX105k17081f6pulg,3,0,4,viQxAGJqyAvdLczzdqAiNg

3016569,2015-05-20,0,mGkVxLpndvodT92iRvbLyQ,"The Social Wine Bar is a new restaurant and wine bar in Tivoli Village and was a welcome takeover from the old ""Pizza Lounge"" that previously resided there. At first glance, the room looks identical to the old regime, which made me a bit nervous, but as you peel back the layers of this reimagined locale, you see the true changes of attitude, decor and menu that welcomed a skeptical soul. Ray greeted us at the bar and began our journey with water and menus that immediately reflected the change in ownership and ideals. 

We discovered, to our delight, that Tuesdays mean half-price wines by the bottle, and this includes ALL bottles on the menu.  That is a true change of pace from the norm. They have a wonderful wine list with many delicious Italian, Californian and Spanish varietals to choose from, and Ray is a wonderful tour guide to all choices. We selected an amazing Italian blend and a cheese board, which included fontina, a goat and sheep milk selection and a balsamic cheese, with red grapes and a fig chutney adorning the board. All three cheeses were delectable and well proportioned.  

For our main course, we shared the seared free-range chicken. It was the most delicious, well seasoned and juicy chicken I have had in Vegas. It comes with fresh-cut French fries that are absolutely killer.  The price-points on the appetizers, entrees and desserts are very reasonable and their pizzas, though we did not order one ourselves, looked very well made and topping-laden. This is a wonderful discovery and a welcome addition to a plaza that desperately needed a good ""go-to"" bistro-style restaurant.

3241632,2015-06-26,0,mGkVxLpndvodT92iRvbLyQ,"The Restaurant Week lunch menu was a 3 course affair. 2 choices of appetizers, 2 choices of entrees and 1 choice of desert. 
For an appetizer, I chose the Boom Boom Shrimp with Thai Chile Aoili. The dish had 6 large shrimp and the sauce had a mild amount of spice. The shrimp are served over chopped greens and thin crispy strips of pita type chips. A very savory dish.
The entree of choice was the Rosemary Chicken Sandwich with garlic aoili, mixed greens tomato and onion on a soft bun. The condiments were very tasty but the chicken was tough and not to my liking but not bad enough to send it back. 
Desert was the Blueberry Bread Pudding with lemon anglaise and whipped cream. I enjoyed the combination of flavors very much.
The restaurant  space was pretty much the same as the previous business. Hard surfaces with loud background music. We were seated next to a table of 6 and their conversation filled the area around us. There is patio dining which would be more conversation friendly but would be too hot on this day. There are table umbrellas but no misters. 
I believe Social Bistro is up against some stiff competition in Tivoli Village.",ywEB0MB_2U11NIGPs35pew,0,0,3,OfHisyaOVcU4UqDdjtVlGQ
3299073,2015-05-09,0,mGkVxLpndvodT92iRvbLyQ,"Five stars because I didn't actually want to go in, but left glad that I did. I was in a bad mood and was set on going somewhere else, but decided it wasn't worth the hassle when my fiance insisted. Its close proximity to the parking elevators and a large sign advertising a ""Social Hour"" were convincing as well. 
Once inside, I was mildly impressed by the decor, which was a lot of clean-lined tile and dark wood. While I thought it was nice, we elected to sit outside. There was a lot of patio space, but not much has been done with it yet.  Since the restaurant had only been open for two weeks, I am curious to see its transformation. 
Our waitress was very nice and seemed genuinely interested in making us comfortable. Everything was brought in a very timely manner. I had the house white wine, which was on Social Hour, was brought very quickly, and was very good. I saw that they had quite a few Goose Island beers on draft and several interesting cocktails, which I will have to come back for sometime. We ordered the Ahi Tuna Stack, the Brie & Fig Flatbread, and the Pulled-Pork Sliders. She told us we ordered the best things on the menu and by God she might have been right
. The Tuna Stack was incredible and probably my favorite. Tuna, avocado, mango.....  I actually asked for more wontons because it was so good.  The brie & fig flatbread was crispy for our entire meal and large enough for both of us to share. My fiance's pulled pork sliders were well-portioned (four sliders) and flavorful. The man orders sliders at pretty much every restaurant we've ever stepped foot in, so this is high praise. I even had leftovers, which is pretty neat for a happy/social hour special. 
We escaped paying less than $40 for the two of us and thoroughly enjoyed our food and time. Social exceeded our expectations and left me wanting more! Can't wait to go back!",1Hj6-ZB6vmKOk4QK9B0FdQ,0,0,5,P_p-EK2rlmdhY2Mjc6BhBw
3560476,2015-04-18,0,mGkVxLpndvodT92iRvbLyQ,"This review is for their Social Hour aka Happy Hour at the bar.  I was just bumming around Tivoli Village killing time before I had to head out for my massage appointment and saw this place where the pizza place used to be.  The sandwich board out front said they had ""social hour"" from 4 to 6 and since it was that time I decided to stop in.  The bar was straight across from the entry and I was quickly greeted as I had a seat and provided the menus.  The social hour specials were posted on a board right at the bar and after looking at their specialty cocktails and flatbreads that were on special I went for a Coming Up Roses and a brie and fig flatbread.  

My drink was prepared quickly and was delicious. My flatbread came out fairly quickly and was also quite good.  Now, sometimes places will have smaller portions of things when they have them as happy hour specials but that was not the case here.  The flatbread was full size so it was plenty for me since I wasn't all that hungry.  I finished my first drink and wanted to try the Menta Fresca but was unfortunately thwarted on that one because they did not have the watermelon to make it.  Being this was only their second night, some things are certainly forgivable so I went with the Social Spritzer.  This was also another very good cocktail.

Service was good, I was checked in with regularly, and the staff was very friendly.  Only a couple of other negatives along with the missing cocktail ingredient knock it down a star for me.  There were two ""social"" networks showing up on my wifi and they were both locked but when I asked if they had wifi and if so what the password was the server I asked did not know and never asked another person about it or came back to me on it.  The other was that the POS system was right at the end of the bar and the servers would gather there to discuss tables and get direction on how to adjust orders and all that other stuff that goes along with a new opening.  While nothing bad was said it was a bit distracting and other people may find it annoying if they were trying to have a conversation at the bar.  

All in all, I enjoyed the food and the drinks so I do plan to come back.  Their regular menu also has some thing that look good so I'll probably give that a shot next time.",HEaplFuRQF9ztUpAvr1bgA,3,0,4,SlUTei3Pq7ePmWrih9I9jQ

3970131,2015-06-26,6,mGkVxLpndvodT92iRvbLyQ,"*** Review is for Restaurant Week 2015 menu ***

I had heard of Social Bistro and Wine Bar shortly after it opened and the Restaurant Week menu appealed to me.  I was seated and given the menus.  When my server, Ray, appeared to take a drink order, I asked him for the Restaurant Week menu.  The iced tea I ordered was brogfuth promptly and I placed my order.

To start, I got the lobster mac and cheese.  It was not the traditional elbow macaroni but rather spiral pasta.  There was a fair amount of lobster in a creamy parmesan reggiano sauce and topped with extra grated cheese and some crumbs.  The pasta was steaming hot and the flavors were very good.

For the main course, I had to try the risotto with chicken.  The risotto was cooked perfectly.  There was a good amount of chicken in the dish and the portion was quite large, such that I almost asked for some to take home.  Almost is the key word.  I ended up eating the whole lot.

For dessert, I got the blueberry bread pudding with whipped cream.  This is a flavor of bread budding rarely seen so I had to try it.  I liked it very much.

Service was excellent.  There was spacing between courses giving me time to check my phone for messages, etc., and allowing me to enjoy dinner at a relaxed pace but not at a pace that would have had me tapping my foot wondering where my food was.  Ray refilled my iced tea without needing to ask and he was around to see how things were.

This was the first bright moment of Restaurant Week for me and I'm glad I put this on my to try list.",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,10,9,4,QKaA-HmC-KD75bQvHhxvWA

4110321,2015-06-18,0,mGkVxLpndvodT92iRvbLyQ,"Dined here last night for Restaurant week. I love trying new restaurants so this was our choice. 

I had their Menu B ($50) which I selected Lobster Mac n Cheese, 6oz Fillet, and Blueberry Bread Pudding. The Lobster Mac and Cheese was ok. For me, it wasn't very cheesy, as I love my mac and cheese to have a good balance of cheese to noodle. This had more noodle. What also threw me off was they had crushed Ritz Crackers on top of it instead of the usual breadcrumbs. It would have been fine, but there were still large chunks of cracker, as though they weren't crushed well enough. 

When ordering, I asked for my filet to be cooked medium, and when it arrived it was well. Aside from that, the flavors were amazing! It's crust was seasoned well and the meat itself was very tender and juicy. The waitress was helpful with selecting a wine to pair with my food. Here, they have a tasting where you can order small samples of different wines to taste ($1-$3) and then select one to order so you don't order something that you don't like (Love!).  This was great for me as I'm still a rookie wine drinker.

The service was a bit slower than normal, our reservation for two was at 7pm and we didn't leave until 9pm, but this could have been attributed to the fact that there was a large party there. Dessert came and I was less than impressed. To me, bread pudding should be  sweet and moist. What was presented was rather tart and a bit dry. Needless to say, I took two or three bites and left the rest. 

Overall, I liked the experience of trying a new restaurant. Would I go back? Maybe for happy hour.",Nbrtdj-ODs-UBCALhYg-AQ,2,0,3,_Bec5Z6zVdSMKtimYqJcBg

Lunch: $20.15
Donation Level: Silver Spoon ($4)

First
Boom Boom Shrimp: Tossed in a Thai chile aïoli (or ""sweet chili and spicy aïoli"" according to their regular menu), served on crispy wonton strips and shredded lettuce. The shrimp was large, plump, and juicy. The sauce was delicious. Fantastic dish! It's very similar to ""Bang Bang Shrimp"" that I've had around town, but delightfully not fried. Social Bistro is definitely making the best version.

Second
Grilled Rosemary Chicken Sandwich: Garlic aïoli, mixed greens, goat cheese, tomato, and red onion on ciabatta. The chicken was moist and very flavorful. Great sandwich.

Third
Blueberry Bread Pudding: Lemon anglaise and housemade whipped cream. Great dessert; I loved the lemon anglaise with the moist bread pudding.

Apple Crumble Tart: House vanilla ice cream. Nice tart; apples still had bite and tang, complemented the sweetness.

Ahi Tuna Stack ($12): Citrus, avocado, mango, cucumber, and crispy wontons. Beautiful presentation, but unfortunately, not very good. The ""citrus"" and mango overpowered the dish and that's all you could taste. It made the ahi seem like an afterthought. Perhaps more ahi and less of everything else would made this dish work.

Crispy Calamari ($12): Tempura Zucchini and Avocado and tomato aïoli. The calamari was decent, but the avocado was the star. Well-seasoned and delicious. I'd love a plate of tempura avocado! The tomato aïoli was tasty, too.

Social Spritzer ($12): Carpano Bianco vermouth, white peach, fresh lemon and sage, and Prosecco. Refreshing and sweet; the perfect summer cocktail! 

Food was decent with the Boom Boom Shrimp and Grilled Chicken Sandwich as highlights. Service was fantastic. Our server was delightful! The space is a nice place to hang out to grab a couple drinks and snacks.",TdYKJgSgY2GF_YJnwsi5yQ,3,1,3,Y6XtYdZZ7feLPhLi_kLYmA
