Visiting from out of town and our resort was papered with menus so we thought we would give it a try. Ordered a signature pizza- Allegra- which as listed on the menu- choice of cappicolo ham or Canadian bacon. I wanted the ham- but they didn't have- so I settled for the bacon. Also ordered a half bucket of wings and a Caesar salad. I was told the order would be delivered 50-60 mins. The ordered arrived after 68 mins which in itself isn't terrible, but the pizza was ice cold. I called back to Sofias and mentioned the order was late and cold and was made to feel that that is what I should have expected. They offered nothing in the way of an apology so I told them I was going to write this review. We proceeded to eat our meal. I will admit the taste of the pizza was ok- but it was missing the bacon it was supposed to have. The Caesar salad was chopped romaine with croutons- no evidence of any bacon or parmesan cheese- that's pretty thin for $6.95. The wings were the only thing that made the meal truly palatable, although we ordered mild and they were too hot for both my parents to eat- spicy that is- certainly not temperature. 
Over all- it there is availability to eat in at Sophie's and you could get it hot-might he a good experience. Until they purchase some delivery bags for their driver- I would suggest avoiding disappointment by ordering from a different establishment.",2xngkLuCB5kuIGISWOrlYQ,0,0,1,PUfebMjlEqg4YADz4uiFRQ

I was thinking ""oh they're probably just really busy I'll order online"" not only was the online process the most difficult ass backwards BS I've ever had to deal with, but it literally took me over a half hour just to TRY to find the same deals as on the flyer. NOW IM PISSED... so not only am I settling at this point but I get a warning that this is going to take 40/60 min...ok that's fine but it's less than 5 miles from my hotel. I ordered at 10:59....here comes 11:15 and so I decided to try to call them again. Ring ring ring...no answer just like before. THEN, I decided to respond to the email that says ""if you have any questions reply to this email"".... mailer daemon immediately afterward. Thank God they don't run credit cards on the website and only at the door or I'd be one frustrated hangry foodie. So it's now 12:30 and I still haven't received food nor any communication from Sofia's. Cut your losses and seriously find something better.

We have been supporting this local business for 3 years. In the past few months the food has gotten worse and worse as has the service. Tonite my husband went in and ordered a cheese pizza. After waiting 45 minutes he asked what was taking so long and he was given a pizza from off the top of the oven and a nasty remark to go with it. He also had walked to the convenience store beside this establishment while waiting. The smell of dope was so strong he couldn't stand it .....and it was coming from outside Sofias back door where several of their employees were congregated. When he got home with the pizza and we opened it we were appalled that they would serve a pizza like it! Burnt....a huge bubble the size of a saucer....barely edible to say the least. My son was very hungry after waiting an hour for the thing so he took a piece and promptly spit out his first bite as it was so burnt!! So off we go to retun the pizza.The first guy we spoke with was attempting to be helpful when all the sudden here come a silly short fellow with an accent spewing nasty remarks! Thankfully he says they have audio cameras because I fully plan on having the owner watch the video and listen to the child in a man's body that works for him, as he speaks rudely to us! Did my husband swear? yes Did he get angry? Yes but to be treated this way when we spend probably $800.00 here every 2 weeks is enough to make anyone mad! We will never go back and will urge everyone we know to stay away from here as well. Oh they offered to make another pizza.....hahahah not falling for that.... as he said ""so I can spit on it"" as he walked away.

Once a loyal Sophia's Pizza customer, I would get their combo pizza and horde it all for myself. One day, I got their combo pizza and something just wasn't right. I couldn't put my finger on it, but the taste of it made me feel ill. I didn't buy it again, but I didn't allow it deter me from purchasing from Sophia's. 

I detest fast food burgers (McDonalds, Burger King, etc), but real burgers made from restaurants, I like. I had to get two teeth pulled a couple of weeks ago and that made me very unhappy. So, the week before I got them pulled, it was nothing but Sophia burgers. I spent like over $100 on nothing but Sophia burgers--bacon doubles, cooked medium, light salt on the fries. 

Now riddle me this... at $8.99 a burger, how many burgers do you have to buy to spend over $100? In a WEEK? 

The last set of ""medium"" burgers I got from Sophia's were dark are charcoal briquets and just as hard. I couldn't believe it! After a week of succulent burgers, they send me this?? My husband said they looked as if they had been cooked in the microwave. More like seared in a volcano! They were completely inedible. And it's not just a matter of taste--no human being alive could eat that food. Then they tried to disguise them by smothering them in so much Mayo that the bread disintegrated! 

Yes, I complained about how bad these burgers were. They were awful! We had spent our money and couldn't even eat them! I've become quite the food snob, but even my husband--the human garbage disposal--threw his away! Nonetheless, a few days later, we still decided to give Sophia's another chance. I was going to call them and identify myself as the person who always ordered the bacon doubles from Grubhub so that they would be able to identify me as the lady who ""ordered $100 worth of burgers."" I mean, whenever I called the restaurant, she said, ""Grubhub"" before I even got the words out of my mouth, so I know she knew who I was. However, when I got to the Grubhub website, I was quite surprised. 

My account was flagged! Sophia's won't deliver to my address anymore!

So basically, instead of rectifying the fact that they sent me nasty, hard, inedible food THAT WAS NOT DELIVERED by the way--my husband picked it up--you refuse to deliver to me AT ALL now because I complained about that cardboard rawhide disguised as sustenance that you made me pay for. It's bad enough that I couldn't even eat the food, but now, you want to try to punish me for having the nerve--the unmitigated gall--to say something about it. 

Thank you. You did me a favor. I'll give my money to Johnny Vegas Grill. Much better burgers for the buck anyway. Have a nice day.",wHTwjMA88rUe0HSEFyZIsw,0,1,1,OYDSjra007oAOaXPmCS7qQ

The pizza itself has a very light flavor tomato sauce. The crust of the pizza is more fluffy then a hand tossed pizza. It tase like bread. I'm not sure what the cheese blend is but you put all that stuff together and the pizza just works. 

We mainly go to this place for the wings. Their wings are decent. The sauce on them are average which is not a bad thing.

I ordered online for delivery and I was stoked because it had been a long day and I was starving. How would you go wrong with a calzone and a pizza? Pretty wrong apparently.

First, I received a Pepperoni 1 Topping Calzone which was supposed to be a pepperoni 1 Topping Stromboli. I also received a 10"" pizza, which was supposed to be a 3 Toppings Calzone with pepperoni, pineapple, and jalapeños.

The order they wrote was short hand and I see that as the culprit of the mishap. Shorthand just ain't right when it's written wrong.
