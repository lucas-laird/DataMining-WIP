101303,2014-11-20,2,Olp6N3_CZFlqGuqrrb15bw,"Located in the same plaza as Ichiza and Tea Station, you'll find this small restaurant right next to Sushi Kaya. If the plaza is busy, I recommend parking next door where Harbor Palace is and just walk over.

Came in at about 730p and it was empty. We were the only people there at the time. Decor is a lot more fancier than expected but prices on the menu are fairly cheap.

What we ordered:
-Roti Canai: waiter told us this was his favorite. Get this for your appetizer. Very flavorful.
-Baby Oyster Omelette: watched a show where the host tried this so we needed to see for ourselves what it'd be like. Asked for it to be made crispy and well done. Honestly, oysters and eggs make a pretty good pair. It's accompanied with hoisin sauce halved with sweet chilli sauce.
-Nasi Lemak: a rice dish cooked in coconut milk with curried fish and beef. Comes with a side of boiled egg and cucumber.
-Char Kway Teow: pan fried rice noodles with shrimp and squid. It was very similar to chow fun.

They don't serve alcoholic beverages yet but was told they would in about a week. Overall, pretty good food and very affordable. This was my first time trying Malaysian food and it definitely will not be my last.",Ucn8yabLDIiDasbLkNy0Ng,5,3,4,jMw2UNqtKA6wQXvekymiDA

Wonton soup was awesome and one of the other soups with a brown base and chicken thighs was good too.

Scallion Ginger Chicken very tasty.  Nasi Lamak was good too.

Place was quiet on a Thursday night with the All You Can Eat joints around it.

Definitely worth going in for dinner.  Prices were reasonable and portions were good.",z-RSaObNcNBx84IbO9bknQ,1,1,5,VaBw0ncc-chlvNBUvOdl1g

1459632,2014-11-02,5,Olp6N3_CZFlqGuqrrb15bw,"Having been to the original location many times, I decided to check out their second store that just opened less than a month ago. I was a fanboy of their first location, and so far, the new location is ok, just ok.

The new location is located about 2 blocks south of the original. It is located in a popular shopping mall, but in a place that once housed a Vietnamese take out, an anime ramen, and a continental noodle shop. Let's hope that these guys can last a bit longer.

The interior is nice and reminds me of the dark woods used at the original spot. The service was OK, but a little unpolished. More time and familiarity with the restaurant would definitely help the service out.

Ordered the captains noodles and beef with scallions. I was brought out 2 dishes but they were wrong. There was a bit of confusion it looks like between the front and back. After returning them, I was brought out the right dishes in a reasonable amount of time.

For some reason, I thought that the captains noodles were pretty much the same as the original, except that the sauce seemed more loose here, whereas at the first location, I thought the sauce was more thick. The beef and scallion dish was OK too. I liked the beef, and the crunch of the green onions provided a nice contrast to the beef. What threw me off were the minced garlic pieces in the dish. The garlic tasted like the pre-chopped garlic that comes in those jars at the supermarket. It didn't have that fresh taste.

Everything was OK here, but I thought the cooking is definitely better at the original location. And with both locations being in pretty close proximity to each other, I think you can guess which one I'll be going back to.",gtwM4ijo65AN4DvXdgCu_w,10,7,3,zN7cvTgg5kg1w6M2fQbkrg
1537722,2015-02-02,0,Olp6N3_CZFlqGuqrrb15bw,"Food: Different flavor profiles, could not remember the food we had when I had a vacation in Kuala Lumpur when I was younger but the taste was ok. Expected to be more like Filipino, since its within the region but its completely different. Probably due to different influences. Coconut milk with tinge of dried crab taste is pervasive. We had the rendang, my wife's rendang expectations were different from what they offered, she didnt like it. The satay beef sizzling plate was ok, the fried rice with coconut milk was ok. For me I don't have any good reference to tell if the food is of good quality or not, the observations on the flavors are solely based on subjective flavor preference.

Location: Chinatown , they took over the now defunct anime ramen.

Restrooms: Restroom was really clean.",pcynTq-0cvM1fEW0oBVyww,0,0,3,YN0Qkue0KUO4LkZ1ug_GKg
2010580,2014-09-14,1,Olp6N3_CZFlqGuqrrb15bw,"Island Malaysian has opened their second location in the space that used to be World Noodle- stopped by last night wanting a hot, spicy soup with noodles and seafood to help me beat this illness but found it had been reopened as a new place. Let the server know I was feeling under the weather and what kind of dish I had originally been seeking, and they were able to accommodate and customized a dish! 

 Seafood tom yum mee hoon is closest to what I got: thick noodles and plenty of seafood (crab, octopus, and overcooked shrimp) all doused in a medium-spice curry sauce with tons of flavor. Really enjoyed my meal, and at $10 including tip it was a steal!

Interior is more upscale than expected. Menu at this location is smaller than the original but keeps the mainstays like satay and roti, but majority of menu is noodles, soups, and rices. They must have just opened, as they had no other customers while I was there and exterior has both the old signage for World Noodle and the new temporary signage for Island Malaysian.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,4,2,4,GglJO7V9EU1yk1mfczZUZQ

Fans of the original location should be ecstatic at the convenience of the new location ONE whole, entire mile closer to the freeway! Wow! That would be something special?...if only you could park in the overcrowded shopping center famous for Ichiza.

The food seems to be on par with the original location. 
Roti Canai is still wonderful!
We also enjoy:

I have no idea if this location will stay in business. They are usually dead inside. The interior isn't warm and welcoming. There is limited parking in the plaza. The original location is right up the street. Aside from their Groupons I can't think of a reason to go here instead of the other location.

Malaysia is one of the most diverse countries in Asia. As a result there are several Malaysian dishes that have the same name as dishes from other regions...sometimes they are very similar...other times their is a Malaysian twist. I've found that lots of people are more familiar with Malaysian food than they otherwise might think because of this.",A5A34ixb-yy6nwL42iZsnw,6,5,3,ghwPEXM7IOyKN9UvX-xrJQ
2590264,2015-02-16,0,Olp6N3_CZFlqGuqrrb15bw,"I've heard of many great foods from Malaysia from a well known traveler in Asia and decided to try a few things I remembered from one of his episodes.

Ambiance: 3/5
It didn't feel authentic as the decor is pretty much football team flags and 3 flags from the country. However it was very relaxing with the soft lighting and comfortable chairs.

Food: 4/5
Roti Canai is one of the well known dishes from the country and so I decided to try it. it's nice as an appetizer which is what it is, but it wasn't at all what I was expecting. The dish was good, however I thought there would be more than a flat bread and dipping sauce.

Basil chicken was amazing! I'm glad this one came out first because it had flat rice noodle just like the dish Tha came second. So much flavor was packed into this dish I couldn't even begin to discover the powering flavor other than basil. 

Flat fried rice noodle with shrimp was a bit bland and the shrimp were not cleaned properly however had a nice bright orange color and not over cooked which is always appreciated. 

Service: 4/5
I rushed in after my massage upstairs at Master Spa not knowing what time Malaysia Island closed. And I'll usually read reviews before entering an establishment. I got in around 925 and my order was in at 930. I then saw they closed at 10pm and it made some sense why I was rushed to order as soon as I sat down. The gentleman was nice and made a few suggestions,  but I didn't get much time to view the entire menu as I assume he wanted my order in asap.  

I'll be back to try more delicious dishes from here.

4048099,2015-07-19,0,Olp6N3_CZFlqGuqrrb15bw,"***Disclaimer: this review is for the second location of island malaysian cuisine,  which is also known as Island Malaysian Cuisine #2. 

Here we go. Me and my friend joe go to restaurants and try them out. We were talking about island malaysian cuisine and we are on our way to it. As we are driving down spring mtn, we spotted island malaysian cuisine where anime Ramen was before...we were confused. At least I was. I was reminiscing when the location was pretty maid cafe, and the last known restaurant on the location was world cafe. So when I saw island malaysian cuisine, I was pretty confused coz I thought it was located by swish, cafe teaze, and kaba curry. We decided to check it out. Turns out, it is island malaysian cuisine #2. So, here we go.

We came in and we were greeted by 2 employees. One is notably the server, and the other was the cook. We were greeted with the normal hi and welcome, but what surprised me the most is when they asked, are you here for the sushi? To which we both said no, we are actually here for the malaysian food. The server gave us 2 regular menus and a picture menu. Picture menu helped out a lot with decisions since I don't understand Malay. Looked through the pictures and we decided for curry beef stew with rice and my friend went for beef rendang. But before that, we also ordered curry puff and roti canai for appetizers. 

As for drinks, most asian restaurants would have thai tea or thai coffee in the drink menu, and sadly island malaysian cuisine #2 didn't have thai tea or coffee. They do, however, have fresh coconut and malaysian tea and coffee. I love fresh coconut juice, but I have to try malaysian tea since I've never tried one before. To sum up this drink, it is nothing like thai coffee, which is good. It has a different after taste and not as sweet as thai tea. Maybe it's because I'm so used to thai tea, but I would pick thai tea over malaysian tea. And also...no refills on the malaysian tea, just like any thai tea. Story of my life. 

The first thing that came was the roti canai. Roti canai was great. Perfectly seasoned, just a tinge of spiciness which mixes good with the bread it comes with.  The curry sauce was flavorful. Chicken cutlets was good. I thought we are off to a great start. Then our main entree came. Beef rendang and beef curry stew. I didn't get the beef rendang so I don't know how it was, but with the beef curry stew that I got, it was so-so. The curry we had that came with the roti canai was better. The beef curry stew, from the lack of better word, was watered down. It didn't have the robust taste that I was looking for. The beef cutlets in it was a little chewy, but not too bad. I asked my friend what he thought of his beef rendang, and surprisingly, he said the same thing. It didn't have the robust taste of a curry, that it's watered down. So both entrees was a let down. We were still hopeful for the curry puffs, which came last. I don't know why an appetizer comes AFTER the main entree, you have to ask them coz my guess is as good as yours.  So the curry puffs came. It was fresh, still hot to touch so we let it cool down a bit. My friend couldn't wait any longer that he broke one open to let it cool down faster. I asked for his verdict, he said it was too dry, and again, does not have the oomph that a curry would normally have. 

Overall, island malaysian cuisine #2 was not bad, and it wasn't good either. And just remember, this is the second restaurant location. The original one that we were supposed to go to was over on spring mtn in between decatur and Lindell by swish, kaba curry, and cafe teaze. Island malaysian cuisine #2 is over on the China town right by sushi Kaya and ichiza.

Now, with that said, would I go to the original location of island cuisine? Probably not, only because of the experience at island malaysian cuisine #2.  Is the original location better than #2? Probably so, but I wouldn't know since a lot of yelpers are raving about it. Would I try and change my mind and try out the original location? Maybe, but I wouldn't go out of my way. Would I recommend island malaysian cuisine #2 to my friends? No, I'd recommend them to try the original location since the original location has better reviews.

In conclusion, if you want a good curry puff (or pan), go to zen curry. I'm saying this because when I think of curry bread, I think of curry sauce oozing out of it. Zen curry, even though sauce isn't oozing out of the bread, still has enough sauce in the curry pan and the flavors mix in just right with the bread. The curry puff in island malaysian cuisine was dry and didn't have much flavor to it. They put too much potato in the mix that the sauce didn't mix in well. The 2 thing that I thought was good with island malaysian cuisine #2 were the roti canai and the service. Both employees war cordial, not too over anxious about how we are doing, and came for drink refills on time...too bad there was no refill for my drink.",aLsqrrHPvfJcLIgmf72rfA,0,0,1,RJuc0G5Ywfuro3-HmcuKuw
