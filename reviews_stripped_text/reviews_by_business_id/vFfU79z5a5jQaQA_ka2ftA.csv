34441,2017-02-27,0,vFfU79z5a5jQaQA_ka2ftA,Went in for lunch today and the entrance kind of throws you off because you can't really tell it's an entrance. We went into the bar side and we were not greeted and there was no one tending the bar. We walked around to check out the decor in the lounge area and no one ever approached us for a menu or anything. We quietly left and ate at the Butcher Block next door. Unsure this place will last due to the previous service comments listed by other people but I sure hope it makes changes fast. Tons of potential and I would love to go back to have a better experience.,UcFoRUIwSZQwIN_0IFr2TQ,1,0,2,4yhmuYFYoXaEeuGdpagktQ

You will see three or four bartenders behind the bar and still wait 20 minutes for a drink and someone to take your order.  All the female bartenders are super friendly but I've noticed the two male grave bartenders are more concerned with looking at the computer screen then customer service.,7gvelHp96yS9q9jyk41YPg,0,0,3,AGDsxNcILEi249V57uhXzA

303589,2017-06-02,1,vFfU79z5a5jQaQA_ka2ftA,"It's been about a year since we've last eaten here. The last time we came, it was pretty dead,  which was strike one. My husband had two Heineken's during the course of our meal, he order a last round, and the waitress brought a Heineken Lite. She also recommended some pretty bad appetizers, which was strike three, but we gave her a pass. Came back tonight to give it another try. Place was pretty busy, and we were happy to see the crowd. Hard to find a good busy spot up north. 
Seated ourselves and was not thrilled about the twenty something behind me puffing on what seemed like two at a time,  but dealt with it. Took 
about 10 minutes for Sarah, our waitress to come over. My husband and I each ordered a drink. Sarah asked us each for ID. Now I like to believe I don't look my age, but I am going to be SIXTY this month, so, although flattered by the request, I was a bit flabbergasted when Sarah said she could not serve me, because I didn't have my ID on me. I asked to speak to the manager, and she blathered on about how, ""now that I know you don't have ID on you, I can lose my job if I serve you"" Really???? I live in New York, but have a house in LV. We have been up and down the Las Vegas strip this week, and NOT ONE bartender has asked us for ID. After we left Distill, we went to eat at another restaurant nearby. Amazingly, we were not asked for ID when we ordered a bottle of wine. We spent over $100 in this other establishment. Distill, your loss!",mCtE_kpm8jcfYasLS0_04A,3,0,1,sHSCtUOZv1TdsK_HZEJb8A

The unfortunate part of this, I like sitting at the bar and the bartenders that work most weekdays are lacking in personality and definitely lack in paying attention to the patrons they aren't friends with. I was in there on 3/6 about 7pm and if it wasn't for Amber (I think that's her name) I probably wouldnt have gotten a drink and just left, it appears she is the only one that wants to work and serve customers while the other 2 that were there, some guy and another young lady with a sleeve of tattoos on her left arm were playing on her phone with their backs to everyone. They would even walk by, see my glass empty and not even ask if I wanted another let alone food. Amber was cover all corners of the bar and any time she saw my glass empty she would apologize for not being more attentive and get another one for me, I can understand her not being able to pay just attention to just me and the people I was with due to the fact she was covering the bar for the other 2 not working. If they are sharing tips, it's a shame cause I do tip well and I did that night but they don't deserve a dime of that.",Ol3HYVkBc_VckMRhK1o9Ag,3,0,2,tEcyINr5dh9kR5Vu58rO8Q

My first time in there I hit keno jackpots that accumulated up to $5400. Then I tried their bombass menu,  which was more like upper end cuisine instead of bar food. Their burgers rock, as well as any entree they create on a daily basis, and the service is definitely above stellar. With Karyn, Nicole, Yvette, and Mike  behind the bar, as well as the infamous manager Erin, all know how to keep the drinks and fun flowin'. Pop in and check it out for yourself, and if the parking is packed on the bar level, just head down to the parking garage below and find plenty of ample spots to park your ride safely.

He took our drink orders and spoke to us for a few minutes. Off to a good start. Then our waitress comes to take our order. We start with the fried pickles. For $9 I expected more than the very small order we received. (Less than half of what we get down the street for $3 less). Ordered lunch .. we were asked if we wanted fries, sweet fries, or onion rings with sandwiches. We were not informed that both onion rings and sweet fries were an additional $1. We would have still paid it.. but would have been nice to be informed while ordering. When our food was brought to us.. I asked for a refill of my soda. 10 minutes later.. waitress had not been back... finally who I can only assume was a manager came by and I flagged her down to explain  I had asked for refill and never received. She was quick to go get my refill. Finally waitress comes back.. we ask for the check. It took a long while (at this point we were the only customers in the restaurant side). Glad we paid with cash... since she never came back to collect check in case we paid with credit card. Food was just ok. Prices were a bit high ... but would have been acceptable with great customer service. Sad to say we probably won't be back anytime soon!",t1TM0s1zK3LI1v6veglTjQ,1,0,2,EqD-PLUVLRRhbgRMRvq7Yg

We grab the first seats we find which happen to be corner seats at the bar. After about 10 minutes a waitress comes up to us (Pacific Island looking with tattoo on her forearm). She SPECIFICALLY ASKED me and my friend if either of us had to been to the bar? We both tell her no it's our first time. She let's out a shrill and welcomes us to the bar. We order our first round of drinks and when she arrives with those we order food as well. About 15 - 20 minutes later she brings us the food. (The food was really great and no complaints at all). We had finished our first drinks in the middle of eating and had to stop eating for about 10 minutes for her just to come back. When she finally arrives , in the middle of ordering my second drink she completely stops me mid sentence to yell goodbye to someone leaving............ at this point I was done with her and this bar. Needing a cigarette, I ask her if they sell. She tells me there's a vending machine but takes cash only. Remembering she's failed thus far , I take a chance and go look at the vending machine .......... sure enough takes debit/credit cards. 

I wouldn't be so harsh if she hadn't gone out of her way to ask if it was our first time there ............ she knew we were new so you would think make a good impression.

The only time he even said anything to him was after after I ordered my drink. He tried soliciting for their rewards card and also only spoke to me. When he took our food order, only me. On top of it, he was the slowest bartender I've ever seen. Took forever to get our drinks and it wasn't busy. He poured the draft beer with no head and just the let the keg run and run until it came off. 

For the food, we ordered chicken chipotle nachos. The chicken was so bad we both spit it out. It tasted really old. We didn't even eat it and asked for our check. Bartender said nothing.

The greens were fresh, cucumber strips, tomatoes, roasted peppers and won ton strips. The fish looked and tasted very good. The wasabi dressing was light, and did not overpower. My husband had the short ribs and fried mash potatoes, wow it was good! His came with a salad. The food tasted homemade and not from processed ingredients.

I live 3 miles from this location and was hoping to find another go-to lunch spot I could be a regular at. I forgot my ID so I sat in the restaurant. No biggie, I prefer to eat smoke free. The only problem was that it took a bit for anyone to realize I was there. Again, no biggie at this point so I ordered drinks and all is good.

For an appetizers I tried an order of  pretzel bites which look amazing from the start but were a quick let down. The mustard was alright but the cheese is the same stuff you would get at the gas station and it was cold by the time it was served to us.

I ordered a side salad that came with the wrong dressing. I ordered Blue Cheese but got Caesar. It looked beautiful but It took the waitress so long to return to our table I never got the right dressing and ended up asking them to take it off our bill. Sadly I had nothing to review there .

I also ordered a half order of Biskets and Garvey and the Jalapeno Popper Burger. The B&G were a 2/5 stars. The garvey seemed like it was from a jar with some cut up sausage added to make it seem made from scratch. And last the burger was raw in the middle.

When I lived in Henderson I used to frequent a similar spot that the same people also own named ""Remedies"" and always had an amazing time, amazing Food, Service, Etc. I was immediately put off when after several, and I mean close to 10 visits, to this establishment I found the gaming to pay out far less than many other spots nearby such as Timbers and copper keg. Subsequently I was able to justify my visits here based on the quality and complexity of the menu. That along with the great customer service that I received from George, a barback here, has kept me returning though I'm starting to question if I will continue to come. They have a late night bartender, a larger middle-aged Caucasian fellow with a goatee, that seems to take the fun out of every visit. His demeanor is smug, dismissive, and condescending at best. It literally takes this guy 10 minutes to bring me a drink every time I visit and he acts like it is as laborious as digging holes in the hot sun to do so. I had incredibly high hopes for this establishment prior to and upon its opening, if only based on my proximity, but I feel like this one individual has nearly single-handedly taken that wind out of my sails. I hope this ""could be great"" establishment chooses to staff better in the future and perhaps finds it necessary to promote people like George from barback to bartender and demote people like this guy out into the parking lot.

I left a bunch of food on my plate, and the waiter didn't ask what was going on or anything.

The french toast seemed to be pretty good, and the biscuits and grave suffered the same fate.  Biscuits were hard, and the gravy was nothing to write home about,  the pancakes around the table had the same problem..  People complained they were very chewy.  

I had a rewards card with Distill,  and when I put it on the table, the lady asked if I wanted to add points to my card,  I simply replied, ""No"".

My boyfriend and I arrived at Distill at 11:30 pm. We had to get our own menus after realizing that we had been sitting for nearly 10 minutes without so much as a greeting, despite the fact that the waitress is walking back and forth and actually seeing us. After another 5 minutes,  a large group of guys 5 FEET AWAY from us got up to leave, and the same waitress came and rearranged the seats they were sitting in. Still not greeting us. (Nice.)

 Another group of guys came in at that moment and sat down in the exact area she was arranging. She proceeded to greet and flirt with them for another 5 minutes before taking their drink order and offering menus. Once she finishes, she just now saunters up to us and says ""So I see you've got menus, did someone take your drink order?"" 

Srsly?

 It's now 11:58 and this is the first time anyone has spoken to us. I actually had enough time to sit here and write this review and my existence still wasn't acknowledged until just now. 

We've declined to order and probably won't be back until this place either increases their staff (size and quality) or teaches their waitresses how to multi-task and understand that flirting for your tip isn't always going to pan out the way you think it will.",mMPyPwJQITYj1sdOD0gnKw,16,4,1,J26R_7xRQ13dctlpqfgNoQ

As we were leaving she was still trying to figure out how to make a certain shot for other patrons, same shot she'd been working on for a good 10 min.

The decor is really nice and the restaurant is clean and well kept. The bar and restaurant are totally separate which is nice because I'd rather eat in a quieter setting. It was happy hour, so we tried the filet mignon sliders minus the onion. They were delicious and even came with fries. For dinner I got the Chipotle Chicken Nachos minus the beans and my husband was clearly starving because he went with the ham and eggs and an order of French toast. My nachos were loaded with meat, and it was shredded and juicy. The salsa was fresh and had a great flavor as well. I ate until I was stuffed. My husband devoured everything except his hash browns. His recommendation would be to ask for your hash browns extra crispy, but that's really a matter of preference. Our server was Holly and she was great. She was very attentive and had a great, kind personality. We signed up for their reward program and we'll definitely be back! Next time I plan to try the salmon.

When the waitress stopped by to ask how everything was I let her know and she was very nice about it and put in a replacement order of wings for me. By that time I didn't really feel like eating anything anymore (got the wings to go and ate later, they were pretty good!)

3613529,2017-02-13,0,vFfU79z5a5jQaQA_ka2ftA,"Hubby and I had been driving past this place for months waiting for it to open. We had heard many good reviews about the food at the other Distill locations in the area so we were intrigued when we learned one would be opening near us. 

We gave it a couple of weeks after opening before deciding to give it a try for dinner. We planned to go on a Friday after work around 4:30 pm thinking we could beat the dinner crowd. Boy were we wrong! Upon pulling into the parking lot on the upper level, we could see right off the bat that virtually all parking spots were taken. We managed to find an open one and grabbed it. Once inside the bar, it was packed!!! It is pretty spacious inside though, but there was a not a seat to be had in the bar area, so we headed into the smoke-free restaurant area where there were about 6 available tables. 

Seating is seat yourself, so we grabbed a table. After about 5 minutes of sitting there, a server came by with menus and took our drink order. We ordered the pretzel bites for an appetizer, hubs ordered the Santa Fe turkey sandwich and Peach D'Lite and I ordered the braised short ribs and a Distiller's Delight. 

The drinks from the bar were a little pricey, but they tasted great! 

The pretzel bites came with a cheese dipping sauce and a mustard dipping sauce. I could've just eaten those for dinner... well I kind of did...more on that later! The pretzels were hot and soft but the outer portion was just firm enough and not overly salted either. Loved them.

My husband really liked his sandwich, but I wish I could have said the same for me liking my braised ribs. Though the plate looked like it just came out of the kitchen, upon tasting it, it appeared to either have been sitting out or the meat hadn't been heated enough. When I tasted mine, the meat was just... room temperature. I politely asked the server who checked on us if they could reheat mine a little more which she gladly and apologetically did. Another server came back out with my plate which I am assuming was microwaved because he had another plate under the original so as not to get burned. He apologized for the dish as well. Wasn't their fault, but I tasted it again and though it had been bumped up in the warmth a little, it just did not do it for me. I really wanted to like it because I love braised short ribs, but I think reheating it in the microwave actually toughened the meat. Hence....I ended up eating most of the pretzel bites for dinner and heading to Taco Bell after for 2 taco Supremes. 

In summary, I might give this place another chance maybe in several months, but if I do come back, it'll just be for appetizers and beer during Happy Hour. The specialty cocktails, though delicious, were a bit pricey for me and not sure I want to shell out the money again for a failed entrée. Or maybe next time I stick with a sandwich...not much chance of those going wrong. At least my husband liked his meal. The servers were great though too!

Sat for 10-15 minutes as the staff ignored us but were quick to pick up checks from people leaving. This place is tiny mind you (dining room) so there is really no excuse for the neglect.  Never even saw or was presented with a menu. Left without anyone to tell our ordeal because there was no staff in the room at that time. Not going back and will advise everyone we know to do the same. Really no upside since the food is average, parking is atrocious, and staff is terrible. If I were the owner I'd be ashamed.

3901487,2017-02-16,12,vFfU79z5a5jQaQA_ka2ftA,"I often have to remind myself while eating dinner here that I'm dining at a bar, because you would never believe it to be true by taste alone. 

We had a super bummer experience during their soft opening, but gave them another shot and I am so very glad we did. We've eaten here four times now and they've never once let us down. The staff are incredibly friendly, and make it feel less like a transaction, but more of a conversation. Regardless of whether you sit at the bar, the dining area, or the smoke-free restaurant room - you are taken care of. 

We're steadily making it through the entire menu, but here are some thoughts. 

Appetizers: Get the Turkey Stuffing Balls. These little morsels of fried perfection are Thanksgiving in a bite, with the most delicious cranberry gelee you've ever experienced. The nachos are....nachos - but made with housemade tortilla chips which make them a bit better. The fried mashed potato balls are fun! Perfectly salted with melty cheese inside - and the smashed potatoes still have their skins, so once you crunch into it's perfectly fried shell, you're in carb-heaven.

Soups: Tomato Basil - if this is on the menu then you don't need to worry about anything else. My tastebuds dream of this soup weekly. The broth is perfectly seasoned with fresh herbs and feature finely diced tomatoes which make it impossible to not giggle with excitement about. Chicken Noodle - imagine Campbells chicken noodle, but no preservatives, boosted flavor, actual chicken, and no sodium overdose. It's mmm mmm good. Chicken Tortilla - whooooo this one has a kick. Black beans and shredded chicken in a delicious, spicy broth. I added some saltines to this to take down the heat, and I didn't want the bowl to end. 

Dessert: I've only had one, and it was the brownie sundae I shared with the husband on valentine's day. This was awesome! I'm not usually a fan of this type of thing, but who can say no to a warm, fudgy fresh brownie with a huge scoop of french vanilla ice cream and whipped cream all drizzled with chocolate and caramel sauces? Not me, #obvi.

- Beef Tips. GET THEM. Perfectly seared, gravy on point, honey drizzled carrots on top of a delicious mashed potato? UM, YES. 
- Fish & Chips. I've had better. Beer battered, a bit dry, but tasty none-the-less. 
-Fried Chicken & a Biscuit. Holy crap. This is amazing. Two drums and a boneless breast freshly battered and fried, PERFECTLY seasoned. Potato medley was sweet, rustic and red under a delightful bed of bacon-speckled spinach...and let's not forget about the buttermilk biscuit. hot damn. Oh yeah, and it's all drizzled with honey. GAHHHHH!!!
- Philly Cheesesteak was everything you hope it will be - a beautifully balanced sandwich to serve all of your East Coast needs with ease. This was served with sweet potato fries - a great choice. 
- French Dip. I was not ready for this. It was my husband's meal the night I got the Beef Tips, and I almost wrestled him for a second bit. This beautiful beast lingers on my tastebuds still to this day. I will have you again, oh yes - I will. 

Our friend got the burger with the cheese in the middle. He's that one friend that searches the world over for the perfect burger and will never be satisfied. He friggin' LOVED this burger. ...so there's that. 

The drink selection is great. I've enjoyed the Pinot Noir and Cab - my husband has been making his way through the whiskey creations. The first night we asked for an Old Fashioned and the bar tender referred to her drink list and then made him an Old Grandad - which is definitely not what he wanted - but he's since ordered it again, so apprently it went well. 

The placement of bar taps is confusing and a bit frustrating, as the bar staff are super friendly and it's impossible to hold a conversation with them in your direct eyeline. 

The decor is great. It's bold and defining without being obnoxious. Thumbs up. :)

Congrats, Distill! You opened up less than a mile from our home, and blow us away everytime - so now you're stuck with us!",uYlzvshOSWCTwNLFBELTug,24,18,5,CY7LLUAVBP9QphBJpD0eNA

Every time I've had lunch here I am always greeted w professionalism and courtesy. The food is typical of a bar type place but always fresh, hot and crispy. I recommend the burgers! Pretty generous and always cooked to my preference. There are some pool tables that I've actually used a few times w my friends. Pro sizes and very level. The atmosphere can get a tad Smokey as they smoke at the bar but the ventilation is always in check. The main reason for my 5 star review is because I actually met the chef today. His name is Chef Charles. Super nice guy. Very attentive and considerate. He obviously runs his crew very well. I saw him speak to a few employees w a lot of respect and it's apparent they respect him too. The restrooms are immaculate!

It's out of the way to really travel to but allows those in the close vicinities to hang out without having to leave their comfort zone. 
I love the vibe of the bar. Awesome decor, TV's everywhere - there are actually four TV's put together to make a huge one! There is a variety of seating - you can sit at the bar, couches, cool armchairs, high tables; booth or row type of seating... so many options! Oh and there is a pool table, in case you don't want to sit at all :)
There is also a restaurant, if you're not feeling the bar despite the flexibility. 
Food and drinks are awesome. I really enjoyed the senorita, strong and goes down easy. So much so that I had three when I only planed to have one... isn't that always the plan?
I find the wings and fries here to be spectacular! Definitely in my top 3 favorite wings in Vegas. How amazing is it to have it close to my house?!?! The calamari, pretzel bites, fried mozzarella, and seared ahi tune were all great as well. The mozzarella comes in half moons rather than sticks. Really yummy! I haven't tried their burgers yet but that is on the list. Their breakfast looks good as well, going to try that as well at some point :)

Anyway, after laying low for awhile I made my way back into this bar(no one recognized me, success!) and it's turned into one of my favorite places-for graveyard shift. No bar is a real bar unless it's open 24 hours.

The food is great. Though I don't really set any high standard for bar food, but this place serves some of the best food than any of the bars in town. More then just a selection of nachos/burgers, they have breakfast and entree meals as well.

Pool tables. That's all.

I will admit though, I have been to this bar various times of the day and night, and the only time it deserves this 5-star rating is the graveyard shift. I'm sure the service is better at this time simply because there aren't that many customers, but holy shit the day and swing shift workers. Those bartenders are absolutely terrible.

The only reason this place is getting 2 stars is because of the pot roast egg rolls which came with gravy and horseradish (which wasn't spicy). These eggs rolls were delicious, tender AND crunchy. Nevertheless, the atmosphere in this place feels a bit bougie for saying a local bar. It didn't feel local, it felt strippy--as in on the strip.

First off, the restaurant is 100% separate from the bar, so no smoke, whatsoever. It's in a glassed off area with about 12 - 15 tables. There's been one other couple there each time we've gone. This means fast service by the very friendly waitress (Christina), including refills of drinks (sodas/coffee). 
The food is what brought us back. Wow! So tasty! Steak and eggs could be done poorly, but here it's perfect. Biscuit was a little ""cakey"", very thick, and the gravy didn't have oomph. That can be forgiven because of the tasty, flavorful French toast: not dry but just the right amount of moisture. 
For lunch, we've had fish tacos and a Kale salad.
Well done. The fish was big hunks of unbreaded deliciousness. The side of onion rings were 100% perfect! The salad had the right amount of texture and tastiness.

Since this place is new, it shows. Everything is clean and shiny. The restrooms look like something out of Better Homes and Gardens. They're exquisite with new tile and fixtures.

We were apprehensive about this place, since it's a bar, with smoking, but our hopes and dreams have been answered! Here is a 100% no-smokey place with fabulous food, wonderful service, and we haven't even got to the booze, yet!

Service: 1 star

Upon arriving at this fairly new local bar at 10:15pm, my friend and I sat at the bar and ordered a beer each. After sitting for about 15 minutes waiting for the bartender to come around to ask if we would like to order food, we simply asked a server for a menu. We decided on an appetizer and 2 entrees. 

After deciding on the items we wanted to order, still no bartender came by to take our order. Finally I believe the manager (male in a black button down short sleeve shirt comes walking by) and notices that we would like to order. He asked what would we like and places our order. He came back to try and make small talk asking if it was our first time visiting (probably assuming that at this point we were a little irritated). 

About 10 minutes later the appetizer arrived. After sitting for about 5 minutes no bartender came by to offer napkins, plates, or cutlery. About 3 minutes later the 2 entrees arrived. We felt bad asking the food runner for the items that the bartender should have brought or asked us if we would like. 

We finished up eating and after we were done with our drinks, one of the bartenders came buy to offer another drink. We would have for sure ordered another, but because of the non existent service, We'd rather go to another bar and spend our money on the service there. 

My friend had asked for a water, and the bartender directly turned around and picked up his cellphone and started texting on it. We both personally work in the industry and this by far was the rudest thing a person at the work place could do. I'm sorry but you are at work for a reason, to work! If you feel like you need to be on your phone more than assisting paying customers, then maybe you should work for A cell phone company. Eventually he received his water after the guy was finished with his txt. 

We really wanted to like this bar being that the food was great and it's close to home! I really like supporting local bars, however when you can find better servers and bartenders at chain restaurants it really tells a lot about this bar. 

I will say that being that there are not many local bars in the area, this distilled has it made. However, Once other local bars such as PTs gets ahold of a demand in this area, paying customers will not put up with bad service.",zFAzl90ZPw1foibICO2Ifw,4,0,1,FZtZRVlZiwPfFX1pZ9OzYw

Basic Las Vegas bar with basic bar food that they don't even let you know what they have or don't have. Order a southwest hamburger. You get a bun and patty. Oh yeah by the way we are out of all of that other stuff. Trash. The whole place just throw it away. For this experience you're just as good off going to your run down PT's down the street..

When you walk through the front door, you are met with the option of going into the bar area, or choosing to dine in the Restaurant only area. We decided on the latter as it was more of what we were in the mood for. The sound from the bar does not carry over to the restaurant, which for us was a nice touch.

Distill has a pretty large menu and has just about anything you can imagine. They also offer a very fair priced happy hour menu as well. For dinner, Karen ordered the Grilled Cheese with Brisket sandwich which came with a side (she went with onion rings). She also ordered a side salad which was bigger than you would expect. For me, I ordered off of their 24/7 breakfast menu, an 8 oz NY steak & eggs to be specific. My meal also came with the choice of toast and a decent size serving of hash browns. 

Overall, the food was really good along with the service. There are plenty of TV's in the bar area and 2 large screens in the restaurant area. This is a great addition to the NW part of Las Vegas and I know we will visit again.",Wai-fQ4YouL7Rys6k3MpkA,1,1,5,p59yyYga4vYod1A2GSchwA

I found an empty spot at the bar and ordered while waiting for one to open up. 

I had the Fat Boy burger, with bacon, cheddar, avocado and fries. I ordered it medium rare and it came mostly rare. The bottom of the bun was close to burnt too. Since I was in a hurry and it didn't taste awful, I didn't send it back. I did mention to one of the employees at the bar that the bun was burnt, and she looked at it and confirmed. I received no offer to send it back or an apology. Not a good sign for a new business! The employees were friendly overall. I had a draft beer, a Stone pale ale, which is a quality choice to have on draft. 

If you're a gamer, they offer $10 in play after playing $20 for joining the slot club. I not only got that $10 but $5 for the instant bonus game (Lotto Bucks) and another $10 for I have no idea what. For my $20 buy in, I got an extra $25 in free play. Not bad! A guy next to me hit $500 playing video poker. Too many people were smoking, and yes that is to be expected. The price you pay for free food! 

I didn't see any advertising for their loyalty card, although there may have been something on the happy hour menu- I didn't look at that.
