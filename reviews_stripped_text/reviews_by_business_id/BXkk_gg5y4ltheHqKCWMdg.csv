Obviously not for your everyday grilled cheese (although i have used it that way and it turns out great) but this cheese is more suited for a cheese and wine night.  Perfect when you want to impress those omni's who ""could never give up cheese.""",jlrWJWT_3TgDKBfWnhrdRA,1,1,5,UOENLQibWNCiaS1bnvAcPg

I miss the best fresh made vegan cheese in the world.  The cheddar cheese will knock your socks off.  Smoky Gouda will knock other clothes off.  Closest to what I remember dairy cheese varieties tasting like.",VrAo40MP-MaHzJb9aSypnA,1,2,4,hcuRpRADi0TjPpv-zlLa2Q

Jody brought me a sample and I will definitely be ordering more, it's spreadable and tastes great with everything!! I also give it millions of stars because it's organic, which I haven't yet found in vegan brands, yay!",OxjLWpLkz2V84UwV89Q5Qw,1,0,5,pqAU_9h0xgR9H89a8S4UOA

Back in the day when I was Director of Events and full time daily volunteer at V Animal's Sanctuary I knew the moment I was planning the grand opening event that Virgin Cheese was top on my list.

They debuted that day in history...and ""The First Time"" has a whole new meaning. Compassion. 
Cheese has a whole new meaning. Compassion.  

The cashew based heaven goes perfect with veggies, crackers, breads, and fruit.

Organic and cultured it is a true work of art. 

I am proud to know Jodi and proud of her success as a local business owner.

Find Virgin by ordering online at VeganEssentials.com, at Fresh52 Market, VegeNation as a platter, and The Market which is open daily here Downtown Las Vegas.

Shallot Truffle is amaze, Brie is amaze, Pepper Jack is amaze, and today Jodi said that she has cheddar to make Mac&Cheese and also an Alfredo Sauce which I can't wait to try both!!!!!!!!

Try Virgin Cheese...your first time will never be the same...",zgV0ZroIF956gw4cul8MHA,7,5,5,GyEQqUd6OwoL9Swn3P4JyA

2587100,2018-03-15,1,BXkk_gg5y4ltheHqKCWMdg,"Really overrated as far as vegan cheese goes, would not repurchase. There are so many options out there right now.
They all have strong lemon flavors & their quality suffers when frozen (which is how most suppliers sell them).
Plus, these people are super unprofessional on IG, it left a bad taste in my mouth. They respond back angrily to people's constructive criticism & tried to get Yelp to remove my negative review! I bet they will even reply to this review, LOL.",D9m4JQ7bM-or5sw54L5Dhg,1,0,1,ZsjcDL9N20p-foTdFCcRhw

The shallot truffle flavor is my favorite.  Enjoy with crackers, fruit, veggies or in a sandwich, you won't be disappointed.",yNOKedCVsYh2jCQ557cqLA,0,0,5,qN6BWfiJ00VYmd0LdtYfiA

Remember tasting virgin cheese for the very first time a long while ago and realizing that there was hope in the world for those people who say they could ""never live without cheese."" Virgin cheese has a variety of flavors (Brie is one of my favorites!) Its a locally owned and operated small business who specializes in crafting delicious cultured nut cheeses. You can try a sampler platter at VegeNation or purchase rounds at  The Market in Downtown LV or online at veganessentials.com.",LtrdwwMedqhqOHl7rKsvWg,2,1,5,h3kOCO1LpcTUoCZbkdxklg

The quality of the ingredients and the flavors that are so beautifully placed together ,make for an extraordinary blend of savory deliciousness...and worth the few extra it may cost! 
Highly recommend!! If you are thinking about trying it, just do it! You won't be dissapointed!",g2ne7kPY3ttcd3uf0vqz-Q,0,0,5,37JILx3c8mUiCiUjBQP9MQ

The first time I tried their tasting platter was last year at the first Vegas VegFest and I was hooked. Now I always want their cheese platter when I go to VegeNation. I'm so glad they carry it! 

I love the textures, I love the flavors, and I love that they sell here in Vegas!",pO7oOAyi-qM3Mf18AkBQaQ,1,0,5,3KLltaHtJdhJECoxag59Tg
5158468,2018-02-16,1,BXkk_gg5y4ltheHqKCWMdg,"I feel so compelled to write this review after having personally interacted with Virgin Cheese via Instagram on multiple occasions myself and reading a couple BS comments that don't seem to hold any validity to them. 

I've purchased the sampler and the feta on multiple occasions from The Market. My conversations have always been positive, and the cheese is amazing. I'm on a fairly strict mixed diet consisting of being non-dairy, gluten free, clean eating, paleo. I love that this cheese fits my lifestyle choice and is actually delicious! 

A lot of vegan cheeses out there are seriously sub par at best. But Virgin Cheese has the taste and texture down-- especially the feta. It's my favorite! Tangy, creamy but crumble-y. The truffle and shallot one is also tasty, too. 

Coming in at around $12, it's very reasonable for an artisanal cheese- dairy free or not. They are rich so you don't need much and they should last you awhile!",mFHbNX5qhG5CREr9PqQqGQ,1,1,5,dTPAUelVzOEWSUg7JzpWUA
5292398,2017-01-14,3,BXkk_gg5y4ltheHqKCWMdg,"Tried to edit my review but deleted it instead along with the very inappropriate and rude response from the owner. I've had Virgin cheese and it's not worth $12. Also... don't waste your time supporting a business that says and I quote ""maybe it's too expensive for you"" - super rude and unethically priced. But you're not allowed to say that to her Vegan cult followers. I'll never buy again.",FbeR3L83t6jRDSoeYr_GIw,7,2,1,xjFQ1qK5lRKD40XPa3mXEA

I was never a fancy cheese person before going vegan so all these amazing new flavors are so new & delicious especially the Sriracha !! Put on crackers or replace in recipes for amazing Veggie Burgers, quesadillas or Enchiladas !! 

As for the price lemme just say I personally know lots of people who work the Farmer's Markets & I can assure you NO ONE IS GETTING RICH !! Far from it !! They use the finest ingredients & can barely survive week to week ... so support Local & support Organic small businesses !!",e336oNvU26amR71Ibo5AZQ,1,0,5,-xMSTV-CxJ891QkRNYhOgw

5956558,2017-01-14,1,BXkk_gg5y4ltheHqKCWMdg,"I saw a bad review for this cheese earlier today so I figured I'd check it out and see what the fuss was all about. I bought some cheese today (5 ounces for 12 dollars) and yes, it's expensive, but it's worth it! This isn't Daiya we're talking about. Vegan cheese is more expensive than ""regular"" cheese that comes from animal torture and abuse. This cheese is made with organic ingredients in small batches from a local artisan. At the price, it's definitely not something that you'd buy to make grilled cheese sandwiches with, but for a fancy party it's a great choice! I'll definitely be buying this cheese again when I'm feeling fancy and I'm in the mood to splurge on a nice vegan treat!",6EcrUtB4Rj1vZt2ipuh50w,3,1,5,2Gf1S4yILnMz44aCXnN54A
