The sandwiches are super yummy.  My favorite is the Carlos. Chicken salad is amazing. Breakfast sandwiches are great too.  Skip the jimmy dean sandwich and opt for the house made stuff you won't be dissatisfied.  Don't get in a rush and be upset because they are taking a bit to get you your food or coffee they are busy and for a reason. It is worth the wait.

And for anyone that complains about the price. This place is not some super chain place. It is the definition of a small business. They dont have corporate buyers getting mass quantities of coffee for the cheapest prices. They don't buy meat and cheeses in bulk and many of the items are made in house.  

So sit back relax sip your coffee while enjoying the art (for sale) on the walls.  I would even suggest having a conversation with your baristas. Sure you may have paid a bit more for your superior latte (I haven't noticed) but it's worth it.",9CeKCGRwlXMzo9c62xiUPw,4,1,5,PEXl-PWRo7B2H3qpP5gXJg

It would seem that nothing could ruin my mood that day: listening to early Cash Money, steamrolled enough blunts to smoke out the IRS building and about to enjoy an expresso.

I paid $2 for my drink. The prices aren't bad, and they're competitive with the other inferior coffee shops around town. 

My expresso was sour. This means it was probably uncooked, or the machine improperly calibrated.

My lips curled upwards and started retracting into my orthognathic negro mug (F- you Alexander Graham of Prudential for denying a brother coverage).

This is worse than my experience at Starbucks, and I generally go into a mass market dump expecting fecal-grade products with a smile.

The novels they have here are laughable airport gift shop stock. 

Some closure: the service I received on that very day was extremely poor, and I mean derelict impoverishment and abject poverty. I felt like a Jew that walked into a 1970's country club in LA. 

I did not get a hello, but the prepubescent youth unschooled in gentlemanly ways did. From me, a customer. I don't expect a red carpet, and I'm not playing the Jessie Jackson race card here either, but treat a negro right, come on. I got a smirk from some tile-mopping apron-jerking prison pickle.

My fiance and I stopped by for a quick coffee while we were on a dog walk. I loved coming here; food and drinks are always amazing.

I was completely taken back.  That was extremely inappropriate. The girl at the cash wrap asked me if she could get me anything. I let her know that what the other women said was completely rude and I walked out.  A simple ""no"" would have been fine. I would have just asked if I could get some water for my dogs.

Still, if the coffee was no better than Dunkin' Donuts or Starbucks, there would be no reason to drive past the Orange and Green Monsters to get here, no matter how pleasant the staff and surroundings. The good news is that the coffee is indeed worth the trip- drip coffee, particularly the Kona, is flavorful and rich, the lattes and cappuccinos are full-bodied and served with enough foam to blunt any harshness in the espresso (only once was this a problem) and the mugs and cups they use are well-balanced in your hand. I've not used the drive-thru yet so haven't had the paper to-go cups, but I'm sure they're fine in their own way.

My first visit was good, although the hot chocolate was ok.  I generally liked it. My second visit I ordered the hot chocolate, again, but this time I asked one of the Baristsas to do the little art in my cup. Instead of saying oh yes of course! She responded.. in a hot chocolate? Usually that's for lattes and you can't really do it in a hot chocolate. When she tried to tell me all of that I tried to explain to her, ""oh they have done it for me in other places."" But she still decided to talk over me. So I just paid for my drink and waited and she actually made a heart in my hot chocolate, which I did thank her twice!!! I work in customer service and I don't think it was right for her to explain to me why she couldn't do it and why it seemed wrong for me to ask that. Whenever I go to Sambalatte they do it without me asking and it's a sweet surprise every time! That's what I love about coffee shops and what I expected from this place.

My scenario as I write this. I've been here since 10am this morning and bought 2 pumpkin spiced lattes, 2 hot chocolates, a plain bagel, iced coffee, Chocolate chip scone (brought my older daughters with me & my husband) and we've been sitting enjoying the shop and doing some work.  The girl mixed up our drinks but we figured it out after a couple of sips. 

Lunchtime rolls around...getting hungry lol and I place an order with ARI(?) for a medium iced tea and THE CARLOS sandwich at 12:55pm and received my food at 1:23pm. 28 MINUTES LATER!! No word until I walked up front and she saw me, then said it would be a few more minutes. When she brought my food, she had her head down the whole time and whispered, ""You're Welcome"".. which I didn't hear but my husband said she did. He pointed out the fact that  she didn't apologize for the long wait, or mention it at all and didn't even smile when she put the food down on the table and quickly walked away. 

I'm fed up, that's why I'm writing this. I don't think we'll come back. There are other options. It just seems to me that these girls that work here are in their own world and just collecting a paycheck.  No effort to do things right. They don't write down the orders, so if they are inundated with orders, or get a lot of people in drive-thru and in shop...that's not a good thing. They don't pay attention to detail and if the owners not here, that's very evident in all aspects. No music playing, dishes on table, floors dirty, attitudes, etc. 

I believe I've been very fair & honest as my first review here was five stars and I've been REALLY trying hard to make it work because I see the potential of where this shop could go in So Highlands but if they don't care, then I guess I don't either. I'm out.

I think this quaint little coffee shop offers a few things that most chain shops don't; they care about product quality, don't mind whimper when you make a special request, and really care that you enjoy your beverage. Why else would they offer ~20 flavoring a and allow you to customize your own beverage?

This is what we had;
Ice Blended Date Night: white chocolate and strawberry. I thought it was pretty good, all the flavors I expected were present except that the espresso flavor was fairly weak.

Ice Blended Trifecta: marshmallow, white chocolate, and macadamia. This drink was awesome! It wasn't overly sweet like I was expecting. 

Both ice blended drinks were really smooth and icey. There were no chunks of ingredients (chocolate or espresso beans), which means nothing to get stuck in your teeth. I might stop by again soon to try a latte or cappuccino- I think cappuccinos are really the way you can tell a good coffee shop from one that serves junk or doesn't know what they're doing, but my overall first opinion is a solid 4 star place- my next stop in will determine if it's worth the extra star.

The actually coffee shop was cute and had it's own mis-matched charm. The staff was super friendly, and attentive afterwards, when you already got your drinks and have been hanging out for a while. I got a tiramisu latte over ice with almond milk---it was a little too sweet for me, but it was still very good and creamy, as if they used breve instead of almond milk, but I'm not complaining. And my boyfriend got a hot Moroccan latte with whole milk, which he really enjoyed and actually finished it in 5 minutes after getting it.

They have a really good selection of books and board games you could choose from and a cute little fireplace and some couches, for you to hang out and socialize. I imagine this place to be a cute coffee shop date during the colder seasons because it was so homey in there. 

Perk Up also has a drive-thru which is super convenient for those on the run, and from just sitting in the lobby for while, it seemed to be much more busy than the lobby. 

The restrooms were super fancy. (I just had to note that because they seemed like something you would see on HGTV.)

Two downsides though:
1.) the couches available were uncomfortable. :(
2.) the cashier who took our orders kept repeating back our order wrong, which happened 3x--fortunately, when we got our drinks they were right. It was just a little annoying having to repeat ourselves multiple times.

I don't live in Southern Highlands but I was housesitting on this side for ten days and stopped by Perk Up a few times instead of Starbucks. The days didn't come, I just made coffee at the house. If I lived in the house I am sitting for, I would come here for all my coffee needs. Which reminds me, the first time I came I tried to pay with my Starbucks app! Embarrassing. In the same trip, I also knocked over their stack of water cups. I almost never wanted to come back just for those two things, but they were kind about it! In my defense, I was very sick that day, I don't know if it was a bug or what but when I got back to my car I was so dizzy I could hardly drive. I had to take the day off and recoup. 

Anyway, enough about how I embarrassed myself! I'll start with the positives about the Perk. It was never packed, and the atmosphere was always comfortable . Some days seemed busier than others, but I was always able to find a seat and table. My dirty iced chai tea latte was to die for, I am writing this while I am in the store and I'm already thinking about getting another. The iced cups are nondescript, which I personally like because it feels noncorporate. I'm not a rebel but I enjoy supporting local businesses where you can meet the owner and know where your money is going. Speaking of, I love the ""local"" feel here, it's almost like the coffee shop in friends (of course, that could just be because they both have 'perk' in the name). The owner came around a few times while I was working on my laptop and asked if everyone was doing alright, which was a bonus. 

As far as negatives, there aren't many, so much of these will just be nitpicking.The clear glass by where you order is never full, which looks weird. Getting some fake food and filling up half of it to be a display would help the overall atmosphere when ordering. I wish I couldn't see as much of the back house stuff as I can because then you can see them making your sandwich with a microwave. I don't mind it, but it takes away the mystery a little! You can also see some shelves in the back. If a curtain can't be put up to block the back from the front, maybe some organizers could be utilized to make the shelf look spiffy. But if those are the only flaws I can find, I think that also says something about how cool this place is!",JB4_tH5U_oN7Xl3MA4aeHw,2,2,4,dh37ITjHUZhkfCazmShN_g

I'm paying more than I do at Starbucks for less? The hot lattes could be better. I enjoyed the cold lattes more but again they are super small compared to anywhere else, especially when you are paying 4.75 plus tax. One of my biggest pet peeves they drive thru is that when you pay with debit card you enter pin in there machine but then they have you sign a copy as well. The reason for them to have you sign it is so you can add a tip. First it's a drive thru and second I'm way over paying for your small coffees. Why would I tip? It's inconvenient and unnecessary. Add a tip jar if you want to get tips. The food... the yogurt parfait don't get pumpkin. It's awful. The regular one who be perfect if they actually defrosted it. When you eat the fruit in it it is frozen so it's hard to actually eat right away. No ones trying to break a tooth on the darn strawberry. The inhouse sandwich again could be better. Instead of cooking all fresh they make fresh toast but then use heated up jimmy Jones sausage and eggs. Like so close but still disappointing.

We found one, Perk Up.. Since I'm always excited to try something new, we rushed right in.

I ordered some tea then decided I wanted lunch.. I asked about a couple of the sandwiches and the girl at the cash register was great in describing some of the offerings and even mentioned how she had pumpkin muffins coming out of the oven. YUM!

I mostly post pictures and don't normally post reviews but 2018 will be the year I exercise my voice.  The decor has books and artwork for sale which for this nerd, kinda my jam.  I want to stay all day and read but here I am writing a review.  

So as I was following the prompted cues for checking, I was looking around and my eyes landed on their Robin Nest special, which consist of toast, 2 eggs, avocado, tomato, spinach, onion, mushroom and Bacon for $9.95.  I was originally just going to check out another place to eat but everything seems North and I am headed South.  And boy am glad I ordered it because it's good.  It's more of a knife and fork sandwich.  Def hearty bc I am full and I still have 1/4 left.  You can choose btwn a croissant (my first choice but they ran out), bagel, white or wheat toast.  I just picked white.  I'd prefer mine toasted more but other than that, it was great.  Which leads me to why I am writing this review...oh before I get into it, coffee is decent.  Personally I like a darker roast.  But the menu typical of coffee shop, coffee, expresso drinks, blended drinks, scones, bagels, breakfo (served all day) and lunch (sandwiches and salads).  Oh and they cater.

So why I am writing this review?  Well I have been a a server/bartender for too long to admit and the barista/cashier/cook was friendly and service oriented.  I brought in my own coffee mug, yes people we NEED TO REDUCE, REUSE & RECYCLE, but it had left over coffee from yesterday so sticky and gross.  I was just going to rinse it out myself but the restroom was occupied.  But it's not just the concept of him washing it but can do attitude he had about it.  When I approached him about ordering breakfast I was surprised he was also the cook while running the front of house AND drive thru all simultaneously.  And there's been a steady stream of customers and he's multi-tasking like a pro.  If I owned a place, I'd hire him asap.  So thank you Adam (dirty blond hair with glasses) for your service.

The other reason being that, while I enjoy the decor and overall feel of the place, there aren't enough large tables.  There's one 6-person table, but the small tables could be just a little bit larger.  Can't really spread out for studying/working purposes very easily.

Otherwise, I think Perk Up Coffee Shop is a great little place on the Southwest side.  I'll definitely be back.",o4qQhGbk5E2Zs5JXsVNu5Q,0,0,4,Oder0fVaGi6R1dNk1M6p4Q

Turns out, something unexpected happened and the wait was a little longer. I didn't mind this, since everyone was so nice. The same lady behind the counter came back with my sandwich and said that they would refund me. I HAD MY MEAL FOR FREE!

However, I was a bit disappointed with the quality of the coffee. My latte was really nothing special. It had that standard ""restaurant with an espresso machine"" taste. Minimal, thin foam, with no crema-milk contrast. I tried a sip of my girlfriend's toffee latte, and it was really chemically and artificial. Also, it was served in a to go cup when we were obviously staying in the shop.
I really wanted the coffee to be awesome, or at least what you would expect from a shop with this image/appeal. So much potential! The place is spacious, gorgeous, and comfortable, with a fireplace and many comfortable chairs and seating areas. 
Overall, this shop has a lot of room to grow. Try using different, higher quality beans, train your baristas to make coffee that is memorable and ""worth the drive"", and ditch all of the flavored syrup pumps. If you are going to offer boutique/dessert flavors, find a way to do it that doesn't sacrifice quality so much.

The prices for a THIN small sandwich was already way overpriced at like $7.50, then you add another $1.50 for ""extras"".

My lovely, darling, amazing husband ran out one Saturday morning to grab me an iced tiramisu latte with almond milk, and it was amazing.

I then stopped by the other day, yes I know I may have a problem, but I went inside and I love the decor! Super intimate and modern, I loved the book case and how welcoming the place felt.

I put in my order, and told the barista where we'd be sitting. Our meeting lasted about 25 minutes, and I still didn't have the coffee.

But i have for the places that have really made me feel compelled to share with others what a great experience or amazing service i had. Perk-Up coffee shop is one of those places. My boyfriend and I came to Vegas for a bmx competition he is in at the South Point Arena.  We wanted to pick up breakfast that we felt might not come out of can and maybe have some someone putting it together with care instead of practically coming off of a conveyor belt like the places that were in close vicinity. I am a big advocate for supporting the smaller mom and pop or neighborhood coffee shops or cafes so i began my search online from our hotel to see where the nearest one would be.  I came across Perk-Up.. From the moment i placed the order i knew that this was the reason i go out of my way to purchase food from places like this as apposed to the main stream chains that most people flock to.  It ended up that the woman who took my order was the actual owner Jeanne.  In the short minute or so of placing the order she had me cracking up by her response to something dorky i said.  I made my way to her coffee shop that was located in the middle of a quiet neighborhood away from the craziness of Vegas. It was a little further than i expected but after i picked up my food i thought.. We will definitely be back here tomorrow.   Jeannie greeted me as soon as i walked in and just knew by the way that i walked in that i was the one who ordered the food to go. We talked and laughed a second before i left.  But i have to say.. It is so so nice that there are places like this coffee shop where the people working in it don't make you feel like a number but a customer that they value having.  I don't eat out often even when i am away from home.  I am a health nut working at getting my master's degree in nutrition. But if this Perk-Up coffee shop was in my neighborhood in Pasadena California.. I would probably be there every week!  Thank you Jeannie!  When i got back to my hotel i was telling my boyfriend about you and decided to check out your website a bit more. It now makes sense why the food was so good and the service so great! You don't even have to know about the impressive education and experience that she has under her belt.. It shows in how she conducts her business! We will be back..

Driving from Denver, Colorado to Santa Maria, California took us through Las Vegas and we stayed with friends to break up the trip.

I chose Perk Up because it was on our way well past the traffic close to The Strip (otherwise I'd have gone to The Beat just off Fremont).

There were five of us and I'll admit that for a small place, we may have overwhelmed the place upon entering, but we stood there probably five minutes (seemed like 15) without anyone even acknowledging our presence. To be fair...there were only two women working. But that's part of the problem.

The emphasis seemed to be on getting the drive-thru customers' orders done and having never been there wanting food, drive-thru wasn't an option.

The food selection was meager, at best. My daughter ordered a pumpkin scone and it was just flavorless. There was no detectable sweetness in the scone itself and no glaze or anything on top...just a few sad sprinkles of raw sugar. My sister and niece shared an expensive, not-good sandwich.

The coffee wasn't bad, particularly. It just wasn't great.

Everything else that happened...the lousy food ($3 sandwiches were microwaved, other sandwiches were $8.50 and just not worth it), the neglectful service, the time it took to get the drinks. We won't be going back on our way back through.",jut7_D_tkIfycglJ3uwvLA,1,1,2,8G-nheRvtQS9iFbREXJ0kQ

4655227,2015-01-30,6,x71EvWJDVKZfM-OiYDWZ6A,"Established in 2011, this independent coffee shop has been perking up the Southern Highlands coffee scene. Two times this month, I was a part of this scene. The two times that I visited, I was studying from the test prep guides that I borrowed from Enterprise Library. Regardless of the small number of Starbuck's closer to Enterprise Library, it was worth driving a greater distance to spend time to Perk up in a unique coffee shop. 

  What a coffee shop to Perk Up in. There is a versatility in seating arrangements. There is outside seats. Inside on the immitation wood floor are plush chairs, small tables with seats, stools at the counter, and a six person table. The six person table is the ideal spot for a meet up, and in my case getting acquainted with the testing material. But if I was into reading a book or chatting with a friend, I'd prefer the plush chairs at the corner near the library case. And if I didn't want to leave my car, I could use the drive thru. No matter where you sit, the Las Vegas sun shines and complimentary WiFi shines into Perk Up Coffee. 

  The changing art work really shines into Perk Up Coffee creating a unique and interesting environment. My two visits brought me back to the 8 bit Nintendo Era. Jeff Swenty's 8 bit wood and carvings adorned the walls of the shop. They are so cheerful. I'd look up from the six person table at wood and carvings of Raccoon Mario and the Power Up Mushroom. Near the library case, Donkey Kong was on display. Over the plush chairs, an 8 bit rabbit drew attention to that corner. On another wall was 8 bit Mega Man. On the wall of the corridor leading to the rest rooms, stood 8 bit Glass Joe from Mike Tysons Punch Out fame. This scene reminded me of the late Galaxy Cafe's attention to theming. I am going to miss Jeff Swenty's 8 bit wood and carvings when it's gone. 

   Cleaniness appears to be consistent. When the batistas wasn't helping customers, she was cleaning. From the tables to the restrooms, cleanliness was on display. 

  There was a large menu for me to choose from. For example, in the cooler months they also serve pumpkin spice latte, pumpkin chai, and pumpkin bottom muffin. I was up to perking up with a simple cup of coffee with flavoring. They offer a nice variety of coffee flavoring that includes marshmallow, Irish Cream, and strawberry. I went for the coffee with strawberry syrup. It was savory and inexpensive. With the flavoring, the coffee came to around $2. Refills were also inexpensive. If I was hungry, I might of ordered a pastry. 

  On both visits, the batista was friendly. Last time, she chatted with me about the 8 bit wood and carvings. 

  I give a shout out to Perk Up Coffee Shop. In very recent times, the Las Vegas metropolitan area lost three independent coffee shops: Galaxy, Coffee House of downtown Henderson, and Beanz. I will not take Perk Up Coffee for granted. I am perking up the word that this is a four star independent coffee shop that is clean, unique, and brews a variety of savory beverages.",0tvCcnfJnSs55iB6mqPk3w,10,9,4,S1zqhRfUXBTCkA1KY_lTyA

The first issue I have, which I've always had, is that they are incredibly slow. I get it, you are a small cafe with only one or two people working at a time with a drive-thru. But I shouldn't have to stand there for 10 minutes waiting to order, not because there is a line, but because you don't have enough people working and the priority is the drive-thru. I would let this slide if they acknowledged the delay but they don't. 

My second issue is their inconsistency when it comes to their food. You can get the most delicious egg sandwich one day, only to get one that is made completely different the next. They are also out of stuff ALL THE TIME. When I'm paying $12 for a medium black coffee and an egg sandwich it better be great.

On a quiet Sunday morning, my husband and I continued our LV coffee tour and visited Perk Up located in a small shopping strip in Southern Highlands.

We obviously came during a shift change.  I heard the barista on her cell phone tell someone that she was excited for her shift to be over. I get it - it was slow - there was only 2 other kids in the store and they didn't look old enough to spell coffee let alone drink coffee. There wasn't anyone at the counter when we arrived but it wasn't too long before someone took our order. I ordered an Iced Crème de Menthe latte and my husband ordered a hot Hazelnut latte. 

The service was pretty average at best and the drinks matched the mood. The prices are comparable to Starbucks. Nothing really stood out as far as memorable. I felt the coffee was too weak for my taste. My husband wasn't particularly fond of his latte either. He didn't finish it. I wish I had ordered drip coffee but it was an iced latte kind of day.
The positive was the store was clean. There was a bookshelf filled with different books and boardgames. There was a marble table that could seat 6 in the corner. That was a nice touch. There were random items on the wall held up by binder clips. There was a flat screen on the wall that wasn't turned on.

The 2 star ""Meh, I've experienced better"" caption perfectly captures our experience but on my rating scale... my first time here was a solid 3 out of 5.",sAEUJb9C6_ekgc8BIScZ5w,0,0,3,9vdDR9XNSWFIRVbq_fhNIA

You can find perk up coffee in a small, quaint strip mall that doesn't feel as cookie cutter and mainstream as other places would. The area gives it a little bit more of an authentic and unique feel. What adds to the uniqueness are their variety of specialty coffees. Their iced coffees are absolutely delicious and my boyfriend and I always get the Nutella and tira misu iced coffees. The staff are young, fun and friendly. 

Why I gave it 4 stars and not 5 is how it still gives you that start up business feel. They have a drive thru with this big beautiful menu and once you make it to the window you realize there's only one and you see this big sink behind it. I guess I'm not really sure if the cash register is right by the sink, but it just looked a little odd. Inside is cute and they have great seating areas and books for children to read, unfortunately I hardly see any people in there.

For food, they have breakfast breads (croissants, scones, and such) and breakfast sandwiches.

Another thing I have to mention is that I came in around noon, and we were the only customer in the building and it still took a good 15-20 minutes for them to make 2 sandwiches and 2 iced drinks.
