50915,2009-07-25,0,-QNQ4R1VgRoL4b6lC8Anrg,"I'm not going to pretend I'm some sort of sushi aficionado.  But I'd like to think that I can tell the difference between good sushi and not-so-good sushi.

Mizuya Sushi and Saki lounge, located within the Mandalay Bay Hotel and Casino, definitely falls into the former category.

The atmosphere is pleasant, and you can choose between a seat at the bar in view of the sushi chefs or a table for a slightly more relaxed feel. They also have a lounge area for enjoying their selection of sakis, but not being a real saki lover I can't comment on the quality of the selection.

My wife and I started off with a cucumber salad, which was tasty and refreshing.  It did a good job of cleansing the palate for the upcoming food.  We ordered spicy tuna and California maki rolls, and salmon, yellowfin, and shrimp nigiri.

Everything was delicious and well-presented.  The total for all of our food should have been $47, which is very reasonable for sushi and considering the fact it was located within the hotel.  As a bonus, we had dined during the 3:30pm to 5:30pm cocktail hour, so there was almost a 40% savings on our order.

The service was good, and we had but one complaint. The fountain beverages were $4 apiece, which is obscene even by hotel restaurant standards.  If I would have known that, I would have ordered a $5 beer from their inadequate beer menu.  But the lack of good beers bottled, let alone on tap, was endemic of the rest of the restaurants I visited on the strip.

Otherwise, we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves and would definitely keep this place on our short list of places to get good sushi on the Vegas Strip.",8WAKRu9mlKVdRVQeAbwEzA,6,2,5,bQaObWtfTChRBoIZ_IDqBA

Really?).  Anyway, I was still craving the next day so we went back for lunch, what can I say I really wanted some Miso.  

The miso soup met my needs, so that was nice.  I loves me some Miso soup when I am not feeling 100% on the ups.  However, the rest of the meal really fell flat for me.  

The poor waitress was super overwhelmed and was the only person serving in the restaurant.  So the service was not great.  The sushi was badly rolled and fell apart, was SUPER expensive, the quality of the crab was sub-par, and the octopus was cut really thickly.  

Having lived in Japan and having been to more sushi restaurants than I can count, I was very unimpressed.  Probably wouldn't have seemed as bad if it hadn't cost $80 without alcohol.   Overall, my opinion is to skip it!",UqoGuABfR5G7bbgIBzxNnQ,2,0,2,L8jUOnhK78nn_xZh24OFjQ

I ordered the $55 which consisted of 19 sushi/sashimi ""deluxe"". There was nothing exciting about my dinner experience. Service was very mediocre and the sushi was nothing exciting - just the typical tuna, salmon, albacore and yellowtail. This ""deluxe"" set didn't even have uni. I've never been so disappointed at a sushi restaurant as I've been here.

We also ordered a Sweetheart roll and it was just as bad. I saw the sushi chef placed a couple of frozen shrimp tempura into a small oven - the shrimp was cold when we received our $19 roll. Our bill was over $100 after a drink (a roll and a horrible sushi set and tips).

It's located sort of in the middle of the casino floor, next to the Jack Daniels bar (aka Cowboyville) which is unfortunate because the stage kind of kills the atmosphere when there's someone up there. The decorations are minimal to none (some fake bamboo polls in a pot sitting outside the entrance). 

My friend ordered the dinner special ($32) which came with miso soup, a mixed green salad with ginger dressing, a California roll, Nigiri (albacore, eel, shrimp and yellowtail), tuna sashimi and salmon sashimi. I ordered the vegetarian roll and miso soup. 

My friend said that the California roll was basic, nothing too surprising there. But the pieces of tuna and salmon sashimi were HUGE! Although he didn't really like the tuna, he said that it had a weird texture like maybe it wasn't fresh. The eel was his favorite out of the nigiri. 

The miso soup was very flavorful, I also really liked the ginger dressing on the salad. The vegetarian roll was a bit small, made up of carrot, avocado, cucumber and bean sprouts. Not the best vegetable roll I've ever had (especially for $7.50), although the avocado was very creamy. 

Overall, compared to other Japanese places/sushi bars in restaurants on the strip, Mizuya is definitely on the more affordable side (If you can call $50 for everything we got affordable). Their sushi is good, you can be lucky or unlucky with the sashimi and the soup is EXCELLENT.

We were a little worried that there was only one other person having lunch when we got here, but decided to roll the dice anyway and grabbed a table. Mizuya is on the casino floor across from the Buffet, and has a pretty nice setup

Food:
- Mixed Green Salad - very good. I like the dressing (I think it's a ginger dressing)
- Seaweed Salad - good. Seaweed was still a little crunchy, which made it feel good to chew on
- Spicy Tuna Roll - ok. Came with cucumber inside, but I wasn't really impressed by the taste or the quality of the tuna
- Mandalay Bay Roll - good. Shrimp tempura roll with eel and avocado on top. It was a little sweet, but the Sriracha i dip my sushi into helped take care of that problem. There was a small piece of avocado on only one of the pieces
Salmon Nigri - ok. I've had salmon nigri that was a lot fresher at most other sushi joints I've been to
Hamachi Nigri - good
Philadelphia Roll - good. Salmon, cucumber, and cream cheese. I usually get this w/ spicy tuna, but I'm cool w/ the salmon since the spicy tuna here wasn't that good
Yellowtail Roll - good
 
Service:
Service was ok. Not friendly, not rude, not anything I'd remember. Could definitely be improved. Had to wait a few minutes after the sushi came out for the soy sauce to be brought to the table. I use sriracha instead of soy sauce, so I didn't really care.

We initially had a bit of trouble locating the restaurant, as it is a bar/lounge setup in the Mandalay Bay casino. Upon arrival, the restaurant was rather empty (although this is understandable as it was a Sunday night). Regardless, a server immediately walked over to us and explained we could sit at the bar or any table in the lounge area.

Shortly after sitting down, our drink and food orders were promptly taken (service here was truly wonderful). The prices for imported alcohol were very reasonable, as were all the food prices. I had the tempura roll, and my fiancé the Mandalay roll. Our rolls were actually very similar to one another, the main difference being the avocado added to the Mandalay roll.

Both rolls were very delicious, the only fault some may find is perhaps the eel sauce being a touch too sweet. However, I thought the sweetness was appropriate with the saltiness of the crab and tempura shrimp.

We grabbed a quick bite from their $7 special menu, which is available everyday from 11:30am-5pm. From the $7 selection, we ordered a spicy California, spicy yellowtail and eel roll. I also snagged a seaweed salad. If you know me, you know I am not obsessed with sushi, and I am incredibly sensitive to the slightest little fishiness. I could not handle the yellowtail as it tasted fishy, which to me means probably not the freshest, as I have had yellowtail elsewhere and found it quite tasty. However, my husband, who isn't as sensitive thought it was just fine. The California roll was made with imitation crab, and the overall balance was a little mushy. The seaweed salad was standard. I wouldn't say this should be your one sushi meal or even a destination sushi meal, but if you happen to be at Mandalay and need a quick bite at a reasonable price, it will do ya.

Personally, I would go back to sip on a pot of green tea and watch some football.",qewG3X2O4X6JKskxyyqFwQ,11,10,3,5gjeEJku-tX7TN3pyjev9A

My husband and his friend ordered some fancier entree rolls (one order each), and I stuck to my more traditional vegetable roll.  I have to say, though, that for $7.50 and 8 pieces, I expected WAY more out of my roll. It was not much bigger than a $3 roll I could get at my local Sushi Mac restaurant.  My husband's cut roll was also 8 pieces and had a couple pieces of fish in it but again wasn't very large at all considering the very high cost.

5562456,2010-10-31,0,-QNQ4R1VgRoL4b6lC8Anrg,"Mizuya is a strange place in the middle of the Manadalay casino.  On one side is a small sushi restaurant with a quiet ambiance early in the night.  On the other half is a bar and lunge area for drinks and music.

First the restaurant and sushi area.  I love sushi, but when I say that I mean real sushi.  Not a bunch of vege crap in a roll of soggy nori with some cooked fish smashed in there. Real sushi, i mean nigiri or maki and most things raw (a few things are fine cooked like ebi, unagi, tako).

The rice was well made, soft and even without hard areas from over or undercooking.  The su was moderate in flavor and balance between sweet and vinegar.  Fish selections were fresh.  There were the standard nigiri that I go for to rate the quality.

Ikura:  Firm and salty without a musty taste or odd texture that comes with too long storage or poor quality.  This was a good batch, very plump and firm.

Saba:  Not the best, mid range quality.  There slightly overly vinegary taste to the fish.  It was not mealy, but could have been better.

Unagi:  This was very good.  The eel flesh was crisped on the outside but still tender and moist.  The kabayaki sauce was rich and thick with a nice velvety texture to it, i was pleasantly surprised.

The Ama-Ebi was poorly textured and I was disappointed. The tai, tobikko, and masago were average. Fresh, but not outstanding in flavor.

Lead time to get your sushi was somewhat long, with a moderate to low volume of patrons I expected better service in a higher end casino restaurant.

The bar service on the other side was fast, reliable, and courteous.  The drink range was pretty wide, everyone was able to find a choice to make them happy.

The music was great, the cover band did a lot of rock and grunge with some alternative thrown in.  Great singer, good range, and excellent band members.  The only problem is that the place shut down at 2, would have like a little longer music show, but I guess the hours are different when you live in Vegas rather then just visiting.

Overall the food was okay, the music was great, and the location easy since I was at the Mandalay.  Would I go to the Manadalay just to eat at Mizuya? No.",M4t4iuq_VtheOHSr0FNlUg,0,0,3,U8-z7dfhutpH3fToCAzlGw
