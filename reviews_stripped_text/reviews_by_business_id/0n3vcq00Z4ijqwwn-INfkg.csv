The fries are hand-cut and fried to order, the service is friendly and fun, and this spot is completely safe for those on a gluten-free diet because all they do is fries, there's no cross-contamination! 

Ask for a sample to try the sauces you want- the plain fries are pretty solid, but they're not playing around with the spicy stuff. I'm waiting for the day they put out a classic San Francisco-style order of garlic fries permanently on the menu, then they'll never be able to get rid of me.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,13,11,4,P2v_RhQGVXmOqNm3Av4N5Q

Wow it was so tasty that I didn't want to share but allowed my friends & family a small taste - then they had to get their own! Found this food truck at school event. Made arrangements for them to come to my husband's comic store for an event. These guys are friendly, fun, accommodating and the food is so-o-o-o-o good.",_IcE2EDdwHkh09PN0KeJDg,0,0,5,8mkrdBPNZldRdiT1Zv-A6g
