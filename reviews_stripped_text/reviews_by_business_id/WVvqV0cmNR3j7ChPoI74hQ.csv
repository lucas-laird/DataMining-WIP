The meatloaf was raw in the middle. The waitress looked right at it as she was cleaning the plates and didn't say a word.

48869,2014-11-30,0,WVvqV0cmNR3j7ChPoI74hQ,"First off, everything is made to order so anything fried will take 15-20 minutes so you can enjoy conversation and the cornbread pancakes.

We had the fried chicken, fried catfish, grilled chicken, and sweet potato pie.
The pie was tasty and served in a tiny pie pan.
The fried chicken and catfish were both cooked very well. They were crispy and very tasty.
The grilled chicken was somewhat unexpected but in a good way. It had a citrus flavoring and it was the first to disappear from our table.

Our waitress was very helpful with the menu and providing suggestions for two guests who do not eat soul food often. Dining in and taking out seems to be a big difference from reading other reviews, so I suggest dining in before taking out.

The only thing negative I have to say is the sweet tea was just awful. I have had many different sweet teas and I do not know what happened. The sweetener, consistency, or I really have no idea made me not want to take more than one sip. I was happy with everything else we ordered.",RU5fBHNbpqs4CjJiQt7PiA,1,1,4,kwt_-RwPBtYI-lOitut4tw

The gravy on the chicken and rice and gravy were ok, nothing extraordinary. Chicken was a nice and crispy. The potato salad was more like mash potatoes, I would've liked more potato chunks. Yams were nice and soft. Overall the meal was filling. There is a $1.65 charge if you pay with card.

We loved the open kitchen and the friendly staff - we came in around 8:30 and didn't realize they closed at 9, but they still took our four orders (two to go, two dine-in) and let us stay and chat well past closing. 

The cornbread is quite unique and the butter made it slightly on the salty side. I ordered the lemonade and was completely unprepared for the sweetness I was to experience from the first sip. Crystal brought me half a glass of water to dilute it and that worked perfectly. 

The catfish was heavily deep fried, as to be expected, and it was so yummy. I could've eaten everything as its own entree, and that includes the potato salad, Mac and cheese and yams.

The oxtails fell off the bone, the gravy was delicious and the mac and cheese, potato salad, fried okra, homemade drinks and peach cobbler were all on point!!! I highly recommend this café for your soul food fix. Nothing better than great food and great service. My only regret is that I cannot make it down to experience the great service in person. The service and follow up was so amazing by phone that I can only imagine the 5 star in person service to be extended. Shila is a phenom!!! She pays attention to detail.

287749,2014-12-15,0,WVvqV0cmNR3j7ChPoI74hQ,"Went there for lunch today and here is my impression:

Decor: Was very basic but homey with your typical walls filled will VIP photos. Got a bit loud due to small space, talkative lunch crowd and radio blarring. 

Service: Waitresses greeted me with kindness and got me seated quickly with a drink. They give you a hotcake shortly after you sit, which is frisbee cold by the time you get your food. So eat that straight away. I ordered fried chicken with fried okra and cabbage. Waited 25 minutes for my order. I didn't mind because the meat was made to order and not sitting under a sun lamp. But, unless you have more than an hour for lunch and/or it's not busy then beware as you will find yourself rushing to eat. The kitchen seemed to have a hard time servicing larger tables while keeping the small tables in line. 

Food Quality: 
Had the dark meat (leg and thigh), which was just the right temperature and crispiness. The thigh was small and a little overcooked but the chicken was overall a 7 out of 10. The fried okra was delicious. A tad bit too salty for a perfect rating but highly recommended. The cabbage was average. Seasoning was bland and leaves were limp from either overcooking or sitting in the juice too long. I prefer them kinda firm. Overall side dishes were also 7 outta 10 with the okra giving the average cabbage a needed boost. 

Value:
Dark meet fried chicken lunch plate and large glass of lemonade (not homemade) came to $14.59 with tax. So, I would say the value was slightly below average but on par with competition (M&M). The price point was slightly aggressive but not offensive.

Recommend?:  Yes, if you are in the area. I live a mile away from this place and still make a longer trip to M&M when I want slightly better food with a tad bit more ""soul.""",FiyvEXWQBGxxojNBopsxeA,1,0,3,OEMn-IWzwLw3pR-R_bv-mg

The lady that answered had no personality and is border line rude. First, she tells me its going to be 30 minutes for my order, and then after I ordered it it went down to 15. I dropped by there 25 minutes later to pick my food up, Surely it would be done right? WRONG! I patiently tried to wait, but after 15 minutes past the 25, I walked up to find out what was going on. The same lady that answered the phone waited on me with rolling eyes and attitude. No apology or anything. Sadly for me the guy had just dropped the chicken for my order .Now its 45 minutes later. There was no sense of urgency, as I watched the cook walk back and forth leaving the kitchen doing absolutely nothing. After just about an hour my original 15 minute order was done. Something told me when I went to the car to check my food.The order was wrong.I went back inside so frustrated at this point that I asked for my money back. My appetite was gone at this point .Again, no apology, just a look of bewilderment, and asking me what's wrong with the food. The lady continued on to tell me that she had to call someone to come in to return my money! What kind of business are these people running, where the employees have to call someone to drive in for a refund? Yea I really want to wait another hour to get my money back. Absolutely absurd. Long story short. Horrible staff,no organization and sadly I wouldn't know about the food, but that the order was wrong. Another word of advice to this place, get your peach cobbler of the lowest rack near the floor. That has to be some kind of health issue. I wouldn't even take it for free when they tried to give it to me, for all of my trouble. Hilarious!  I did forget to add that part.",IVErQm7M-0EWh7Njq7hcgA,0,0,1,sJQDXEotoLP0gbHmJZh8qg

When I was there the 2 sets of White patrons received premium service. Their soda was promptly refilled. They were repeatedly asked if everything was okay. For both White patrons, the service fee charged for using your debit or credit card was waived. They didn't ask for it to be waived, it was told to them by the heavy set Black waitress that she was doing this for them. How sweet. When I asked if the fee could be waived for me and my husband's meal, I was told no. 

The Black patrons had to ask for their sodas to be refilled and was constantly trying to get their servers attention. It was awful. The food was okay but this display of service will keep me away. I will go to Lo-Lo's, which is a hike. I live 10 mins from Soul Food Cafe.

He recommended it a while back, so I decided to do take-out for dinner tonight. When I got there, I was helped out right away and was told my order would only take a few minutes, and it did! Wait time, food and the amount of options that sounded tasty was great. Yet, one thing held me back from a better rating.

Originally, I asked for BBQ ribs, but, was told they were out. Luckily, they had short ribs in replacement that the cashier had filled me in on. Further, my roommate recommended trying the fried okra for a side and I was really excited to try it. Out of the three sides that came with my meal, it was the first I chose! The cashier even yelled out, ""fried okra,"" to the chefs, I'm assuming to inform them to get it started. Although I got my food fast, when I got home to eat, the fried okra wasn't on the plate. If it was unavailable like the BBQ ribs that I had originally asked for, I would have appreciated being able to choose another option like what had occurred before, not shorted on my meal. 

Overall, I am going to come back and try the fried chicken, but, am disappointed, the one and only thing I knew I wanted to get before walking in was forgotten. Really bummed me out and made me want to call, but it is a bit of a hassle to have to drive back just for a side.

441113,2015-05-28,0,WVvqV0cmNR3j7ChPoI74hQ,"Being from the South, I have high expectations for ""soul food,"" so I was already expecting a less than stellar performance. I'm sorry to say that, but truthfully Portland has been the only place to wow me in the West, something I'm sad to admit. Anyway, I went in for the first time today with an open mind, mainly because I was hungry and I didn't want to be disappointed. 

I ordered the short ribs (w/ barbecue sauce) dinner with cabbage, macaroni and cheese, and hush puppies, with banana pudding for dessert. All this came to a total of $28 and some change... a bit pricey if you ask me, especially considering the ingredients are probably not that great (i.e., organic, non-gmo, or locally-grown). The food came hot and quick, but the serving sizes left something to be desired. Ordered to-go, the food comes in a larger styrofoam to-go box with a foil-wrapped cornbread pancake... this was the highlight of the meal. Otherwise, the short ribs were seasoned well, but very fatty and the sides were lackluster. As a second-runner up, the cabbage was satisfying. 

I would not have taken the time to write a review, except the banana pudding pissed me off. For $4.25, I got like a little cup of banana pudding, but it was the worse I've ever had. The pudding was from the box, you know that horrid yellow/gold color and terrible after taste. Needless to say, I was disappointed... cara triste.",mTYAth0x4jEwfuE0QTswaA,0,0,2,uuR1ZMjH1QuWb8Lws4emZw

My husband ordered Fried Chicken rice and gravy and Cabbage. We tried to order the ribs for our daughter off the kids menu, but they were out of ribs too :( So we ordered baked chicken for her.  After a pretty long wait we were told very apologetically that they were out of Cabbage also. At this point I did want to leave, or wish I would have known about them being out of food so early on a Sunday, I would have liked the option to try again another day...BUT after waiting about 1.5 hrs we stayed, and waitress said that she would comp two sides for us. We finally got our food, honestly the portion size was quite laughable (maybe Ive been spoiled down south?) On the plus, the food was pretty tasty but for the price/portion ratio and the wait I dont know  if I'll be going back? 

btw..we ordered the Sugar Momma : Sweet Tea/ Lemonade and the Sugar Daddy : Kool Aid and Lemonade..Really Good, but VERY sweet...drank all my sugar for the month ;) lol",H8OT9Tp-LVWt0E-0xcDdyA,7,2,3,FJV35wfK7WdA0toPahAjZQ

I would order it again just to see if it was this batch, because it was good just way too salty! Get me some water? Next we tried the chicken and waffles- again flavorful, thin, crispy fried skin, juicy chicken inside- but also a bit salty. The waffles were nothing to write home about and we weren't impressed by the Smuckers (?) packed syrup- we were really expecting the syrup to have been a little bit more homemade-ish, oh well. Finally, the Mac and cheese...my friend who recommended this place swears by it, I've had better. Also- that free cornbread while we waited?

1079731,2015-03-19,3,WVvqV0cmNR3j7ChPoI74hQ,"My first and LAST time here!

As soon as I got here, I checked in on Yelp. This was my first time coming here and it said I earned a 50% off coupon. Right off the bat I KNEW they would try to find some way to skate out of letting me use the (first timers) Yelp coupon... and that's EXACTLY what they did.

You see, they have 3 eating 'times': Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner. Lunch ENDS at 3 PM. So, quite naturally, it should have been assumed by the 2 female waitresses that I WAS ORDERING DINNER as I arrived there at 4 PM... a whole HOUR AFTER 3 pm when lunch supposedly 'ended'. The coupon clearly said DINNER (see attached photo)... and that's exactly what time I was there for... DINNER... When I pointed out the Yelp coupon to the waitress, she said ""Well, you got the lunch portion""... and THAT's how they avoided letting me use the coupon. Here's the problem though. AT NO POINT did either one of the 2 waitresses ask me if I was ordering lunch or dinner. And they shouldn't have to ask because I was clearly there DURING DINNER HOURS. When I asked her what the difference between 'lunch' and 'dinner' was... she basically said THE PORTION SIZE and THE PRICE. Ok, that's fine... but why on God's Green Earth would you bring me a lunch portion when lunch was clearly (according to your own menu) OVER MORE THAN AN HOUR AGO. She then elaborated on how ""dinner can be ordered any time""... which begs the question (from anyone with a working brain), ""If dinner can be ordered at any time, then WHY do you even have a 'dinner time'"" ???

So, I ordered the grilled snapper plate.

Before the actual meal arrived, they gave us this sweet cornbread pancake. It was honestly the only surprisingly good thing about this place. The 2 sides I ordered along with my 'lunch plate' were red beans and rice, and greens.

The Grilled Red Snapper: The portion size was incredibly disappointing. I thought I would be getting a WHOLE snapper grilled... or at least a WHOLE FILET... NOPE! They literally gave me 1/4 of the size of fish. This little piece of fish they gave me could LITERALLY fit in the palm of my hand. The onions and peppers they put on top of the fish were bigger then the fish itself. I finished that little piece of crap in 4 bites! Although it tasted good, it had more of a Tex-Mex flavor to it than a Southern style, should food, or even New Orleans style flavor.... sheesh!

The Red Beans and Rice: I swear I think they poursed some Bush's beans (or 'some' type of canned beans) over some clumpy white rice. This didn't taste home-made AT ALL. It literally tasted like something out of a can. They even had those nasty little old meat chunks that you get in the can. They didn't even cook the rice right either. It was sticky and clumpy like one bog mushy ball.

The greens: This was bland as hell. No REAL seasoning whatsoever. I was wondering if these were 'turkey greens'... but here's the weird thing. I found a piece of a turkey bone at the bottom of the greens. Yet, there wasn't a single piece of turkey or peppers in the whole bowl. I wouldn't be surprised if this came out of a can as well. It had that 'canned greens' taste to it.

I LEFT THEM NO TIP! They weren't willing to honor a Yelp coupon that THEY set up... so I refuse to honor their crappy service and crappy food with a TIP. My suggestion to ANYONE reading this, is that, if you're looking for some REAL/GOOD soul food, try T.C.'s Rib Crib on Durango. They have good portion sizes, decent prices, better taste... and they don't need some crappy coupon scam to sucker you in.

I sent them a message using yelp, and received an almost immediate reply, and then on my next attempt got through via phone.  The owner made special effort to get my food delivered ASAP.  Catfish was cooked to perfection, moist, crisp flavorful breading, the okra was the same freshly made which you can tell from the texture.  The greens were tender and nicely seasoned, I also had ribs sweet bbq sauce, mustard potato salad, just like moms, and mac and cheese.

Very Friendly service. True Southern hospitality - even though my server was from Southern California. I was taken care of.

I had the Chicken and Waffle with sides of cornbread and greens.

The  Cornbread was fantastic. Served pancake-style with butter. I could have eaten my weight in these. 

The Waffle was light and fluffy, The Chicken was nicely fried. I upgraded to the 'breast' option, and it was worth it. 

The Greens - now here it gets tricky. Having spent a good deal of time in the South, I am used to the fact that the Soul Food there tends to be salty for my taste. This was the only part of my meal that I thought was just too salty for this Northern boy's taste buds. It was still good, but I was glad that there was a friendly refill on beverages.

The dinner prices were on the high end for what the meal was. I don't generally expect to pay $20 for a basic meal in a strip-mall type establishment. But I will definitely be back for the food and for the friendly environment. My hope is that we can get the salt toned down - letting the customers add as much (or as little) as they like. 

Very Nicely Done.",8la7DygWKVkfpDatXztktg,2,2,4,hqS0OOFdAmLD8Pjb-GbuTg

I truly enjoy delivery their food as customers absolutely love this restaurant. But as a courier, I experienced 30+ minute wait times, never received even a hello upon coming in, and very little customer service (I get it, I'm not the customer but more so a middle man. I'm used to it). I would deal with it because the customer is always excited to receive the food even if it's been a long wait. 

My last visit however, speaks for how this restaurant should always be. The manager Sheila was there and she was the one to assist me. She is what customer service is! Upon arrival, order was ready. 4 entrees, a bunch of sides, and 3 drinks (I expected a 40 minute wait). After already being reassured by another employee there that the order was correct, Sheila stepped in and went through every item with me. We found a few discrepancies but she had the correct items out before I could even take a breath. She knows what customer service is and understands that although I'm a courier, there's a customer on the otherside. THANK YOU!!

The smothered chicken was quite good also with large pieces of chicken and lots of savory gravy. So why did I give this place 3 stars? Mainly because the portion size did not match the price.

I ordered meatloaf, Mac n cheese, yams and red beans n rice! Yeah! Sounds good, don't it?!
Ummm hmmm, that's what I thought too!
Meatloaf: Beef...no onions, no bell peppers or anything! Just a thick slide of dry beef with Very salty gravy on top! Nooooo!!!
Yams: sweet and good
Mac n cheese: OK, not as cheesy as I would like, but still good.
Red beans n rice: No, no, no. No real flavor, rice was a little over cooked. 
Oh yeah, I forgot the Sweet potato pie: it was a tart sized pie, nothing to write home about.

2059816,2013-01-07,0,WVvqV0cmNR3j7ChPoI74hQ,"Short version:
Came here with my wife and son on a Saturday night, and the place was busy and understaffed. The food was excellent, though, and made up for the hit-or-miss service by the overworked-but-friendly waitress. Perfect if you're hankering for a deep fried, barbecued, or slathered-in-gravy food fix.

Longer version:
This unassuming place is nestled around the corner of the Albertsons shopping center at the SE corner of Rainbow and Warm Springs. Football played on both TV screens, and the small seating area was pretty crowded. The staff was friendly and inviting.

We received:
Cornbread
- Their cornbread is cooked like pancakes and served as complimentary appetizers as well as with most entrees. Crispy, chewy, and buttery. Very nice.

BBQ Ribs with Yams, Fried Okra, and Mac & Cheese
- The ribs were fall-off-the-bone tender, and they were slathered in a thick, sweet sauce. Messy as all hell, until I realized they were so tender I could flake the meat off with a fork and eat it that way.
- AMAZING yams, cooked with plenty of brown sugar, cinnamon, and butter. Most dinner entrees include 3 sides, and if I had known the yams were this good I would've ordered the yams as all 3. VERY sweet, so if that's not your thing, they may not be as good for you.
- The fried okra was decent, although there were some messy burned up chunks of fries in with the okra.
- The mac & cheese is thick and cheesy, although best eaten while it's still hot and the cheese hasn't started to solidify too much.

Fried Catfish with Rice & Gravy, Mac & Cheese, and Hush Puppies
- Coated in cornmeal breading, this entree includes 2 giant slabs of catfish. My wife ordered this, and claims it's some of the best fried catfish she's ever had in Vegas. I'm not a huge catfish person, so it seems quite good, but it's not really my thing.
- The rice & gravy was good, although we asked for more gravy because it didn't seem like there was enough on it.
- Because they were understaffed/overworked, they just kind of forgot about the hush puppies. They brought them later, but it was late enough that we just had them bring them to go.

Kids Meal of Chicken Fingers and Fries
- I'm not sure why they list them as chicken fingers, because what came out were chicken wings (which isn't listed on the kids menu). Good fried chicken wings, sure, but not what we were expecting.

Peach Cobbler
- We ordered the small serving, and yet it was more than enough for the table, consisting of a large bowl loaded with cobbler. Almost syrupy sweet, which can be both a good and bad thing. It was very tasty, although it might send you into a sugary food coma.

Sugar Momma drink
- Their version of an Arnold Palmer, using southern sweet tea instead of regular tea with the lemonade. DELICIOUS. Definitely ordering this again.

Overall, the food was great and we had a positive experience. Hopefully the staffing thing was an aberration, because the food is good enough to warrant a visit.",jhaT21VWZVtW2zXPVmzeyg,4,1,4,-l7BJPFJ2kg-et-9qcn7iQ
2092601,2013-05-05,2,WVvqV0cmNR3j7ChPoI74hQ,"Was so looking forward to having a home style country soul food dinner with my husband on a Saturday night....And was so extremely disappointed to the utmost!

1st off it took over an hour to serve 2 waffles and 4 pieces of chicken, one piece was sitting in the fry basket for a good 20 minutes, we had a birds eye view of the kitchen from our table so was able to see all of what was going on or shall I say wasn't going on!  There had to be over 5 people in that kitchen and 1 guy doing the cooking and nothing else was going on beside smack talking with each other and talking on their cell phones. 

I ordered the mac and cheese I couldn't even eat it, it was the worst I have ever tasted in my life, NO flavoring at all didn't even taste like there was cheese in it and the noodles were extremely over cooked.  

Back to the chicken for just a moment OMG the driest piece of meat I've ever had next to beef jerky and even that has more tenderness in it cause it marinates, there was NO seasoning what so ever and clearly over fried for sure....I had to douse it with the waffle syrup just to get it down....Okay now about the so called waffles...the thinnest piece of waffle I have ever seen I thought it was a crape with scores to look like a waffle it was so thin, they doused it with butter to camouflage the dryness in that as well.

The outer crust is flaky and light the meat is fresh and hot. The mac is cheese is pretty good as well. not the best I've ever tasted, but definitely not the worst. The fried Okra was excellent! 

The only negative things I can mention are the the wait times and the portions. I know soul food can take a while but when you've only got a one hour lunch break you can just hear the time ticking away as you wait 30 minutes for your food. In addition, the servings were bigger when they first opened, it seems they've cut back for whatever reason on the sizes...maybe to save money? Who knows. But when one of my coworkers receives half a piece of catfish in her combo....well nothing good can come from that.

All in all it's great to have a soul food restaurant on this side of town with a friendly staff.",965QDYAn8jXQ9Wj7whuHsA,5,2,4,wiQBhl5tRDXosL6Sk2fD1w

2153182,2017-02-18,0,WVvqV0cmNR3j7ChPoI74hQ,"Have you ever eaten at a soul food restaurant and left hungry? I hadn't, until now. I ordered the fried catfish dinner via Postmates delivery which was to include 3 sides and cornbread for just shy of $20 before tax. Unfortunately, I didn't receive the cornbread. The catfish was tasty and a hearty portion. The sides, however, were pretty small. The fried okra was a good size and tasted fine. The Mac n cheese was ok. The rice and gravy tasted pretty good but that was tiny...like less than a quarter cup. Not a huge deal as part of a meal but if you order the sides separately they are over $4 and if I received that size portion for that price I'd be pretty mad. 
Anyway, I was really itching for soul food so this scratched the itch and I'm willing to try it again on-site, but so far I'm a little less than impressed. When I think of soul food, I think hearty, comforting, does-your-soul good kind of food. This fell a little short.

I requested white meat, which I got. But it was like 'the chicken taste like wood"", it was dry beyond... it was not seasoned at all. I ordered cabbage, they gave me greens.

I always wanted to try Soul Food Cafe plus thinking about my Ironman Chattanooga journey. The food down south especially the smothered pork chops I had while in Atlanta, GA area. Plus Soul Food is always best recovery meal cause it heavy and filling stuff. 

My first impression was it reminded me little bit of down south. The fact seeing all the to go containers. Not sure if most people order take out because when I was down south we were one of the few people dining in. Anyway. It just open area with lots of tables. Few television around most of them on some sports game. They have chalkboard on the counter area with the daily specials. So make sure check it out. It was gumbo that day but had my heart set on smothered pork chops. 

They only have smothered chicken and steak. =( It was ok. The main thing was craving was the smothered gravy that on top of the protein choose to put it over. The sides have few choices I went with greens and mac and cheese. Cornbread comes with it. The smothered gravy was solid. It not the same as the one had down south. The consistency was nice thick brown gravy. Like. It was slighter darker style. It had nice flavor and went well with the steak. I felt like it was little on the salty side. I would try it again with fried chicken next time see if taste different. The sides the collard greens. Da Bomb. It cooked perfection. So much flavor. The mac and cheese not really fan. It was ok. Not creamy style mac and cheese. Different best way explain it. The cornbread that was Onolicous!!! At first might get scared cause it looks more like pancake then typical cornbread. I was like where the cornbread. LOL. I found different concept it so nice and moist on the inside. It nice warm whole bite since flat then in muffin or normal bread style. I was like dam get me small stack next time be in cornbread bliss. Seriously!!!! 

The service was five stars!!!! I believe the owner came out checking few times. The server was on it constantly checking making sure everything was good.

Took my family  there to have a good meal, me and my daughter wanted ribs, but we were told they weer running out. I told her to get them and I ordered the catfish.

My wife ordered the smothered steak, I gotta say the gravy was great, I loved it, but the steak was over cooked and instead of cooking it in the gravy they pied ur over the top. My fries cane out so burnt that I thought they gave me sweet potatoe ferries instead. I told her I wanted regular fries and she told me they weren't sweet potatoes and she would have then make me fresh ones. Who the hell would bring out fries that represent your establishment like that? 
     The waitress was nice and friendly and very helpful, she was actually the best part of the experience. It also disappointed me that our sides came out to us about 10 minutes before or meals did, and that I paid $18.50 for 3 pieces of fish and some small sides. It is way overpriced. I paid $8.50 for my son's sandwich that should of been a $2.99 item off of the kids menu. I wish I could say I'd go back but I'd be lying.",oc_DwTkEPSoaBmgYWi1C0w,2,1,2,AoBN6-3M3pkDqM1Kd3q04A

It looked like it was actually made from scratch and I detected some spices. Not too heavy and good. The chicken breast I received was boneless and had some good seasoning on it.

My husband came home from an out of town job and we also have family from out of town so I ordered 3 dinners for delivery. I ordered the smoothered chicken, seafood platter and ox tail dinners. The truck that the food was delivered in was a nice advertisement of the restaurant. The food was awesome! We are Samoan and we have big appetites so the portions were very fullfilling.

Thanks again to Shila and everyone at Soul Food Cafe for redeeming our faith in you. We will definately be back!!!",8mc0mGYnIKfXj058Jmsjeg,2,1,5,n-V4fHKsPI_StGBZTdPXJw

We walk in and greeted by the server who was very friendly and nice . Sat down and took a look at menu quickly realized prices seemed expensive for the type of establishment but being the foodies we are we ordered regardless to try a new place and hopefully somewhere new to go for soul food. Order grilled chicken, yams , green beans, and my other half ordered turkey leg & gravy, red beans and rice , cabbage. The waitress quickly brought us cornbread which  I loved! The lemonade and kool  aid drink was surprisingly yummy. Our food came and I was quickly unimpressed the grill chicken tasted odd I couldn't figure it out my green beans were definitely  canned, although the yams were yummy. I wondered as well if they were canned . The turkey leg the other half ordered was awful and flavorless he said it had apparently been boiled  I guess.. yikes he mentioned the same about the green beans being canned tasting, and forget about the cabbage it looked awful like it had been boiled and reheated for a week absolutely gross looking he wouldn't touch it. This is coming from a man that never complains about food! We were extremely disappointed by the meal as a whole!

I started with the cornbread - delicious! My entree was the catfish, fried in a decent and not too heavy batter, with selected sides of red beans and rice, fried okra - I think using the same batter as the catfish, and collard greens. The greens were the standout side as they were not too vinegary but cut through my fry-heavy meal. My food was good and the catfish even better with a dash of the table-top hot sauce. The red beans were just a little toned down I'm sure to have a broader appeal. The fried okra was just good fried okra, which you will appreciate if you've ever had bad fried okra! I did make a reservation as I knew this place isn't enormous. We were seated by and had drink orders taken by one person, who got us started with the cornbread. A 2nd young lady took our order and made great recommendations for everything. Our party had the smothered steak, meatloaf, chicken and waffles and oxtails, along with my catfish. Other sides were macaroni and cheese, cabbage, hush puppies and I think one guy tried the black-eyed peas. All were good and everything - and I mean everything, was steaming hot when it was served. They did serve our sides first and separately, kind of keeping with the down-home style, and not an issue with me. Our table was against the front glass, so I didn't really investigate the place, but it was comfortable and clean - I would say exceptional for a place that does a lot of frying and serves syrup! Everyone said the really enjoyed their food. My only old-guy negative was that they had on the NFL Thursday night game on the TVs and some more contemporary radio station in the kitchen area which were clashing in an audible way and lessened our ability to converse.

*Edit: Let me explain more fully. I first went to Soul Food Cafe two months ago. It was busy & I ordered fried catfish. The owner was working the register & she told me 20 minutes. I walked around the area while I waited & gave them an extra 10 minutes.

When I came back, my food wasn't ready. The owner told me the food would be right out. 45 minutes AFTER that, I was visibly annoyed because multiple customers came in after me and received their order before me. My food finally came & the owner gave me a complimentary dessert & $15 gift certificate for my next visit (meals are over $15, but whatever).

Cue my next visit. I ordered through the Eat24 app this time for pick up. It said 20 minutes. I arrived 30 minutes later and my food STILL wasn't ready. The server at the register was abrasive & the cooks were glaring at everyone in the restaurant.

But let's talk food. I ordered smothered chicken with Greens, Mac&Cheese and Yams. Paid 19 dollars after taxes. WAY OVER PRICED with hella small portions. Only bought it because the craving was that bad and with the reviews i'd give it a shot. By far THE WORST soul food place EVER. Pretty much gives m&m their credit back its that bad. The gravy on the chicken was bland. Had to add my own salt to give it a little flavor. The mac & cheese didn't taste like cheese, tasted like noodles with seasoning and chips. And the greens..main thing I went for, completely under done. The seasoning was like pepper type spices and that's it. If I were to make all that food myself, I would steal their customers off top.

Ummm..ok? Most places at least hand it to me but ok, cool, maybe she had back surgery and can't lift. *shrugs again*

Fast Forward, I'm home and checking the bags. Hmmm..No peach cobbler. UGH don't wanna drive back, but called anyway and advised of the issue. It's no harm no foul, so I called very pleasantly because ""S**T happens"".  Cashier answers, and then places me on hold(didn't ask or say she was, just...silence."" and then another voice comes on the line and tells me that she ""specifically packed the bag herself and the cobbler is in there.""
OK...i'm not Stevie Wonder, but I don't see it. 
""I packed it! but whatever, i can give you another one."" 

Ummm..another one? ma'am I don't have the FIRST one i ordered! 
She then proceeds to tell me a credit can be added to a future order or i can come get it. At this point, since she pretty much thinks i'm lying, I decided to come and get it and never deal with a company who is this dang petty. 

SO here we go..another scenic drive back(it's dark by this time and I'm hungry). I stand around to be acknowledged by her and she then starts to pack the cobbler. She STILL wants to argue with me and tell me it was in the bag and how she packed it! Are you serious?! Ma'am, I'm gainfully employed  and  i can purchase all of your cobbler if wanted and this drive from Summerlin has been more expensive than the cobbler you ""think"" i'm stealing from your paycheck! After 40 minutes, from when i last stepped foot in here,  you still want to argue about how you're perfect and don't make mistakes huh? Ok...your 1st customer service mistake is to never assume anything. Unless you're IRobot I'm sure you can make mistakes and simply ""FORGET!"" Take Kendrick's advice and  BE HUMBLE!. 2nd, we don't call guests liars( inadvertently or flat out) 3rd, you should actually use empathy and perhaps apologize(i know where i work, i apologize constantly for things i didn't do..you'll be surprised by how some people just want to be heard) And I actually still said ""thank you""(my mother raised me with manners, i can't help it) even after she attempted to belittle me. (Ms Asinine, never replied back and actually said things that she knew i couldn't hear due to the loud dinner atmosphere). 

It's all good, you live and learn..and with that knowledge you know where to order from and where to do business.  

Dear Manager-run back your cameras for the day and see if the cobbler was indeed placed in the bag..and if so, lets find out where it went! Because it sure didn't come to my home. 
Sincerely, 
A lost customer.",8zOZT2wRm8OsZ5UT7SOcBw,2,0,1,Y4iyDru5429odLGTTcB0Nw

I've never been to a soul food restaurant that didn't have cornbread dressing as a staple menu item.   It's also overpriced and they are stingy on the portion sizes.  They could give you more than a couple of tablespoons of greens.  Greens are not delicacies, in fact, they are cheap.

First off, I am planning to file a lawsuit against this place -- because they have MADE ME ADDICTED TO SOUL FOOD!!!!!   Second, if you can't hear me, that is because you might be deafened by the sound of how FRIGGING INCREDIBLE THIS PLACE IS.  

Ok, maybe a little over the top, but it is well-deserved.  

Everyone from my office strolled down here one day, figuring we might as well try a new local business.  The service was on the spot.  Your butt hits the chair and the cornbread gets slapped down in front of you.  You look at it... its a pancake.  You think, ""ok, sure, I'll eat this while I wait.""  Then, this corn goodness just explodes in your mouth.  Seriously, I could eat just the cornbread.  

The first time I ate there, I had the Oxtail.  Then, that's what I had the next three times too, because it was sooooo good.  But, I figured that I should at least explore the menu a bit.  The chicken and waffles just might have to be on my short list if I am ever offered a ""last meal.""  The breading here is like nothing I have ever tasted before.  The liver and onions?  FORGET EVERYTHING YOU THINK YOU KNOW ABOUT LIVER AND ONIONS!  They are a spiritual experience.  Turkey leg!  Howl at the freakin moon and call me sally!  Whatever that means.... 

I have yet to eat anything here that didn't make me crave it the next day.  I HATE this place, as it has caused me to put 5 lbs on in the past month eating here.  I CANT STOP!  

Yeah, its THAT good.  

And, the food isn't the only great thing.  The people who work here are so nice, great service.  

I guess if I had to say anything is not 100%, maybe the atmosphere?  But, that's only if you are looking for ""atmosphere.""  It is utilitarian.  Nothing fancy.  Frankly, I am glad for that.  It does not NEED any accoutrements, or padded booths, or anything else.   This is the kind of place that keeps you coming again and again with great food and great service.

3160421,2015-10-07,0,WVvqV0cmNR3j7ChPoI74hQ,"Had lunch here yesterday for the first time. First impression: isn't really my style of restaurant. It has sort of a grungy casual feel. Decor is very minimal but I figured I'd let the food speak for itself so I stayed. My BF said he'd been here before and the food was good. I had the grilled red snapper, black eyed peas, rice and mac 'n cheese. The sauce on the grilled red snapper was very lightly seasoned with red bell peppers but the fish itself impressed me. So fresh and fleshy, soft and flavorful! I got two large pieces of filet-ed, unskinned  fish that was filling and delicious! I imagined being back on South Beach somewhere at a restaurant near the sea having this fish dish. 

My sides weren't worth remembering. Everything was clumpy like it was cooked a long time ago and reheated and I really don't get why they put everything in separate little plates. It was very awkward to eat from a large plate and bunch of mini plates on the table. I ended up just dumping everything into one large plate but it felt like I had to build my own meal. Tasted some of my bf's fried catfish and it was good but a bit salty. It also tasted like Zatarans and corn meal so nothing special that I can't make at home. I've had better so I can't dub thee the  #1 Soul Food in Las Vegas but it's worth a try.

Overall I would come again just for that freshly wild-caught, salt-water, grilled Red Snapper with all it's succulent, chunky, meaty goodness that reminded me of the Caribbean! 

P.S. Prices here are a bit high so make sure you come packing especially for dinner but my grilled Red Snapper lunch with two sides is just $11.99. My extra side was another $4.50 and canned soda was $1.60 or so.",cYXPnVBFmggagWbE3jYXKw,0,0,4,H4CIQgiDNhcUN6zdfM8WjQ

I've come here before but I didn't remember it so I decided to try it again. I got a $10 veggie plate and it was hardly any food in there! I got a lunch special and most soul food places give you a sweet tea but there was no drink included. They didn't even fill the plate and have the nerve to charge the same as other soul food places! I got the mac and cheese, cabbage and yams. The yams tasted like they were fresh out of the can and the mac and cheese had this weird flavor. The cabbage was alright but it wasn't enough. And cabbage does not save the whole meal. I also got the banana pudding and peach cobbler and both were bad. The banana pudding tasted like nothing but jell-o instant and the cobbler was greasy. They were $5 each for the tiniest of bowls. 

I remember when I came here before there were a lot of people. When I went this time I was the only customer in there. I don't know why businesses have a good thing then mess it up.

The restaurant is small, but not small to the point where they couldn't seat a party of 8. What I liked about the restaurant is that they have two TVs going on, one had the Sunday night football game (in which my Indianapolis Colts were playing, go Colts!) and one where they had 8 Mile playing. 

We sat down, got our waters, and ordered. I heard a lot about their cornbread previously and so I definitely wanted to try that. Little did I know that everybody that dines in (for dinner at least) gets cornbread! I was happy and when it was served... Man that was good cornbread! That was rated GAF right there. The orders will come out a little slow, especially if they have to fry your food, so expect a little day for that reason, but it comes our fresh and hot, so you can't really argue with that. I personally ordered the chicken and waffles and the waffle was my favorite part. The waffle has a cinnamon taste to it and it was crispy. The chicken was pretty good, but I personally have a hard time eating the wings, in which I opted for the three wings instead of the breast. 

I was a little confused as far as the service went because we never got refills and I didn't know if we should just go and get it ourselves since there was a fountain that we could all access, and so we just got the refills ourselves. My friend's brother got the kids chicken basket and that wasn't that great. It wasn't like the crispy breaded chicken fingers you would expect, it was this long strip of chicken and the outside was a little tough and the inside was kind of dry. For a young kid, or very many people in fact, they may not like that, so possibly opt for something else for kids. The dinner menu is also a bit pricier than the breakfast and lunch menu, but all dinner entrees, besides the chicken and waffles, comes with three sides.

Overall, I had a nice time. I definitely would come back here, maybe not for dinner, but possibly breakfast or lunch, for I found those menus to be more worth its value.",hM3oEy9HoC_uQExSdwUysg,4,1,4,eJQ_5N-eDWoitx4FVvy3kA

My complaints are about service, attitude and pricing.
The more popular this company gets, the smaller the portion becomes, but im still paying over 15 bucks a meal.
People who take your oder seem to act like you are bothering them instead of happy you are over paying for the food.
I used to eat here all the time. My last 4 to go visits, I have been missing anywhere from 1-3 itema each time. It happened again today at breakfast. Get all the home and see im missing a waffle and my grits. I found this ridiculous since the rude lady asked the cook specifically for grits, then she hands me my bag that doesn't have them in it. Which I find out once I got home. Im soooo tired of it, I didn't even call in and complain this time. For what? The fake apology and just to have my next order missing things as well. Sad part is I was the only order they were working on, how do you mess it up? 
The wait timea are always longer than what you are told, no matter how empty or full the restaurant is. I hope they get their act back together. I won't be in for a long while, but if I try again, would like
1) to not have someone act like im bothering them when calling in my order
2) a decent portion size 
3) to be ready on time
4) and finally, to actually have ""all"" of what I ordered.",14SiWTnnPOZnnGc0vbecNA,4,1,2,Wd0jY0te5s0VY4vno-QlRA

-Fried Chicken 4/5. I am not sure what others are saying about serving size, but my thigh and breast were huge and cooked perfectly. I got smothered Chicken with the smother on the side. No smother showed up. Still outstanding fried chicken.
-Fried Catfish 4/5. Catfish itself was 5/5 but it came with packaged tarter sauce. Put some effort in on the tarter sauce please. One of your best dishes would be enhanced by it.
-Collard Greens- 4/5. A little more bite than one would assume but still very good.
-Rice and Gravy, Mac and Cheese, Hushpuppies, Peach Cobbler, Cornbread Pancake. 3/5. All of these were ok but nothing stood out as really good. I think the Cornbread Pancake could have been if it were hot and had some butter.
-Service 4/5. Giving 3 to the girl on the phone and 5 to the delivery guy, he was great. 
-Delivery 3/5. If you know before you call that they are either not gong to be able to deliver or it's going to take at least 1.5 to 2 hours you won't be upset. Going into this second attempt I knew 2 things when I called. 1. It was going to take a long time if in fact they could deliver. 2. If I called on a Friday or Saturday night I might as well been calling the President of the United States to deliver me something. It would not happen. If you keep these 2 rules in mind you won't be disappointed. Delivery guy was super nice and the food was as hot as if I was sitting at a table by the kitchen. Oh, and there is a minimum $40 delivery order, with a $5 delivery charge added on, just so you know.

- Chicken was on the dry side (3/5)
- Mac and cheese was okay (3/5)

I paid for the turkey in advance as they requested and was forewarned, THERE ARE NO REFUNDS. Thanksgiving eve, at last minutes notice, I was asked by the restaurant to pick up my Turkey because it was ready and I could no longer pick it up Thanksgiving day. It completely inconvenienced my night with family constantly arriving in town. The lady on the phone had no consideration for the fact I was being inconvenienced and even suggested I have a friend or family member come grab the turkey. So, I rush across town to be even more dissatisfied.  My 18-20 lb turkey was easily 8lbs max (understanding they shrink up to 20% once cooked, making it 10lbs originally).

That's a pretty outta control price for a 5 PC fried chicken dinner. The beans tastes like out of a can with salt and pepper added. The collards were ok. The chicken was ok too. The fried chicken wings had the most flavor.

The food was ok, but if the price was 14 or so I'd have been much happier. I don't mind paying for quality, but DAMN, 20+ for fried chicken gets you a 12 PC bucket and sides any other place I've ever been too aside from restaurants. 

I just didn't see the value for the $ but everything else was good. If the chicken blew me away I wouldn't have minded the price, which is expect it to at $20+. It didn't, but I thought the service was fantastic and the food pretty average.",feX4HQ9YmRgd0Y-4oqvh8A,0,0,2,Fu855iqwp0ZhJhOIVTGIjw
4057657,2014-03-02,1,WVvqV0cmNR3j7ChPoI74hQ,"We have picked up to go orders from Soul Food Cafe a few times and tonight was the first time we dined in.  It was pretty busy when we arrived at 5 pm on a Saturday, lots of people coming in and out picking up orders.  We sat down and was waited on by a very cheerful waitress.  Our drinks came out pretty quick, and then we waited...and waited...I noticed a lot of people coming in to pick up orders and they were also waiting for quite a while.  Seems they only have two people cooking in the open air kitchen and three people taking orders/waiting tables. Lots of confusion among the waitresses as there were a lot of people calling and picking up and there was quite a bit of wrong orders going out.

We finally get our cornbread pancake first- warm, large and sweet, they were the size of a small plate and were fluffy and quite good.

Next came our sides and a few minutes later our entrees. The sides were all very tasty, collard greens were not over cooked, potato salad was flavorful with what seems like relish, mac and cheese was good and yams were overly sweet (but the mister liked them).  I had the fried chicken, they were perfectly seasoned and the skin (my favorite part) was crispy. The mister had the smothered chicken and thoroughly enjoyed his meal.

I also ordered a small order of chitterlings for $7 and it was horrendous.  I've had chitterlings once before in another soul food place in San Francisco and it wasn't bad so I wanted to try theirs.  Let me start by saying that I am an adventurous eater, I eat just about everything and anything.  I grew up eating innards (intestines, tripe, heart, kidneys, liver, pork/chicken/duck blood..I even LOVE balut!) so for me intestines is nothing new BUT good god, the chitterlings here were just awful..I took the first bite and nearly gagged.  I put some hot sauce on it and tried again, thinking maybe I just had a bad piece, nope, second bite was just as bad.  Two bites and that was enough for me, they just did not taste clean at all!

If it wasn't for their fried chicken and great sides as a saving grace, this review would probably be pretty bad.  I wanted to try their oxtails too but the table next to us ordered it and the woman sent it back....I know some of the items on their menu is actually pretty good (chicken and fried fish) so I'll be back again and hope to update my review as I really like to support local mom and pop places.  Plus, they have Niner logos everywhere so you know I gotta give them props for that :)",LltbT_fUMqZ-ZJP-vJ84IQ,4,0,3,FRulcbkgGMMLLmOFgUklJQ

Oxtails were fall off the bone tender.  Cabbage a lil overcooked and a tad bit salty to my liking  but i like my veggies with a lil firm not necessarily  crunchy  but not soggy but still edible.  Yams  good, not too sweet.  Gravy great, I rarely  like other people's  gravy.  mac and cheese, first let me say this ....Restaurants  dont be afraid to make mac and cheese a premium  side to pay for the cost of cheese.

Peach cobbler (pictured), 3 Piece fried chicken with a side of mac n cheese, rice n gravy, and fried okra, Hot link sandwich with a side of fries.
Let's break it down. 
3 piece **DARK** chicken $16: DARK Chicken that would turn you into a prune, it had so much salt. Just salt. No seasoning and ridiculously dry. If someone gave me this in one hand and a dog treat in the other, I wouldn't be able to tell the difference.
Mac n cheese: Elbow macaroni. Tasteless Cheese. 
Rice n gravy: White rice. Gravy from a can.
Fried okra: OUT OF THIS WORLD!!!!! WOAH GOOD! No words, just so good I couldn't stop eating them. Small portion though.
Hot link sandwich: $8.99 Burned link with BBQ sauce (?) on two pieces of toast, soaked in butter on just one side, other side was completely white. Came with french fries doused in salt. SO SO much salt.
Peach cobbler: $4.25 (!!!!) for a small styrofoam cup those sundaes from Jewel-Osco come in. Not good at all. Tasted like simple syrup and very flour-y pie crust. Lots of liquid in the cup, thats not normal. 
I love salt. I use it on everything, but this was so much. Inedible. I ordered through bite squad, who are usually on their game. Unfortunately, SFC was not. When I realized the peach cobbler we ordered was not in our bag, I called the restaurant and asked if I could have it. She said ""it's not here, but you can come get it if you want."" Wait, what? If it's not there, why would I drive all the way to Rainbow? That's the whole point in DELIVERY. Also, why would I have to come get it? Brianna, who I believe answered the phone, was rude. Awful customer service, you should be ashamed. This place sucks. A better suggestion than this place would be every other restaurant in Vegas.

4364081,2012-10-21,5,WVvqV0cmNR3j7ChPoI74hQ,"Soulless, 

This is my second review of this place in as many weeks because I wanted to go back and see how consistent the food and the service were from my first trip.

God, have things changed.

My first review was glowing; I gave it four stars. Now, Soul Food Cafe barely earns one; here's why:

At my last visit, the meatloaf was among the best I've had anywhere in the country. You could savor the quality of the beef on your tongue as the meat mixed with the fat as it mixed with the spices as those mixed with the rich, dark gravy. It was that good. The gravy was the gold-plating on the dish. Most everything else that I or my girlfriend had was either very good or great (read first review below).

This time, however, the meatloaf was dry, hard almost like a roofing tile (I swear, I almost refused to pay for it) and came with no gravy (although I specifically asked for it). The black eyed peas tasted like a salt lick, and the rice and gravy was a warm, tasteless paste like the kind they'd serve us in elementary school. Gross.

The tea tasted like it came from a powder, the potato salad tasted old and I swear the chocolate cake this time could have come from a grocery store.

I'm not trying to slam these people. My first visit was incredible. In fact, I was psyched that Vegas finally had a great soul food restaurant. But in a matter of days this place has gone downhill. It tastes like what you'd get at some cafeteria that caters to folks in their 80s, where everything is stale, old and bland.

I'll give this place one more shot, but it'll be months before I do. These people had such a great start. They need to get it together before they lose more customers.

Read original review below:

Simmering in Soul

I wanted to marry the meatloaf. Right there on the spot, in front of the chef and everybody. I had only been there 10 minutes.
Truth is, I didn't know what to expect from Soul Food Cafe, the newest such joint in the valley. My girlfriend and I have almost always been disappointed by the lesser-quality soul food spots in town, so we didn't have high hopes.
But two bites into the meatloaf (in the picture I took here), and I felt like I was back home in the South, where we're steeped in gravy and simmered in iced tea.
This place is the first soul food restaurant here where the high-quality ingredients match the ability of the chefs to churn out the kind of soul food that tastes like it's right out of your mama's kitchen.
I think I'm on record about how great the meatloaf was - perfectly seasoned with a slight crust swaddling the thick, warm slices of soul on a plate. The mustard potato salad is the best I've had anywhere in Vegas at any restaurant, but the mac and cheese was a little dry. The book-size slab of chocolate cake, however, more than made up for it.
My girlfriend had a perfectly fried piece of catfish with a side of sweet potatoes she loved and a dish of greens that while cooked with either smoked turkey or ham (it was hard to tell) tasted, she said, ""flat and needed soul."" That's a serious deficiency for a soul food restaurant, but the rest of the food is good enough to make up for the lapse. I should add that she ate her banana pudding so fast I barely got a look at it, much less a taste. 
Lunches come with two sides; dinners come with three. All meals are also served with crispy, buttery cornbread cakes that are as good as any I've ever had anywhere in the country. That's not an overstatement.
If, like us, you have a deep-seated love for soul food and have been disappointed by what's available in Vegas, you'll probably love Soul Food Cafe. They've only been open about a week, and they're obviously working out some kinks, but this is seriously good food at fair prices cooked by a staff who know what they're doing and have the skill to satisfy your hankerings. Oh, the wait staff is also very good: attentive, friendly, efficient. Give Soul Food Cafe a shot.

The woman that I believe is one of the owners greeted us right away and made us feel welcome. We browsed the menu a bit and shortly after she took our orders. I was a little concerned that the menu says 25 minutes minimum for fried foods, but I don't think our orders took that long.

I opted for Fried Chicken with Yams and Greens and a glass of Sweet (swaaaaate) Tea. The sweet tea tasted like it was made with cane sugar which I really enjoyed. The Fried Chicken was heavenly. It was tender inside with a light, flavorful coating on the outside that wasn't greasy in the least. The yams were buttery and greens were tender with a little kick of heat. I absolutely loved the cornbread pancake that is served alongside the meal. It was a perfectly prepared pancake with a very unique flavor.

My husband had the Fried Catfish and was a happy man. He loved the catfish. Like the fried chicken, the catfish had a light breading that packed flavor, but was not heavy or greasy. His Hushpuppies and Red Beans & Rice were both awesome sides.

Let's start with the little bit of drama we experienced tonight after my daughter found out she lost the small ring her nana had given her for Christmas. It doesn't have any real monetary value, but irreplaceable sentimental value. After some mental replays, my daughter's brilliant mama (aka moi :) suggested she call up Soul Food Cafe as it was the last place we went before coming home and ask if they found a ring. She spoke to Dominique, who informed her they did find her ring and would be keeping it safe until we could go back down and get it. The color returned to my daughter's face as she breathed a sigh of relief. 
This was not the first incident we witnessed of the people at Soul Food Cafe going above and beyond service in one day. While we were dining, we couldn't help but overhear the conversation of the staff and manager as they took care of an okra misunderstanding amongst some regular lady diners seated next to us. The manager made sure to let them know how important they are and made generous reparations to ensure their satisfaction. It seems the whole staff are just very friendly, smile and make everyone feel at home. I am happy to give them the extra star because of the staff. 

Now on to the food....

We both ordered the CHICKEN & WAFFLES (3 wings) with an extra side of GREENS and CORN BREAD.
It took some time to get the order out, but well worth the wait. The wings came out plump, hot and crispy with the right amount of seasoning.
The CORNBREAD pancake was wonderful...light, sweet and the perfect accompaniment to our meal. I could eat a whole stack of these.
The WAFFLE was how a Sunday morning waffle should be...thin, crisp and moist. The syrup was gooey and good for dipping.
The GREENS are just as good as our friend D's homemade greens that we use a benchmark. Balanced flavors of sour, sweet, salty with bits of ham hock. We enjoyed sopping up the greens broth with our waffle.

This was a great roll up your sleeves and get-ready-to-eat experience that we will come back time and again to enjoy.",bzU8Cl6B9nqV1i5NReobvw,10,8,5,jjKy7rKENMiqTs3CbBDavA

I wanna put the naysaying to rest. Soul Food Cafe is fire. I have yet to be disappointed. The chicken & waffles are amazing here. And I can say that because I moved here from LA where I frequented Roscoe's (arguably the most popular C&W spot on the map) on the regular. I think they have this special recipe for their waffles that was killing me it was so good. 

I think they gave a fair portion of butter on top but my arteries were feeling dangerous so I asked for more and our waitress was super cool about it. Didn't even try to upcharge me like other petty places would.

I will say my favorite thing about this place was that it was comfortable. It felt like eating at home.

Positives:
1) Very friendly
2) Food is good

I had the Fried Chicken dinner with three sides: Yams, Beans & Rice and the Green Beans.  Everything I ate was tasty, so again, the food is not the issue.  The only thing I found to be just ""meh"" was the cornbread that everyone seems to rave about on here...maybe it was because I did take-out and it wasn't completely fresh by the time I got it home, but it was underwhelming.  

My g/f got the rib dinner of which I tasted one rib and it was tender and delicious. 

Negatives: PRICE

Wayyy too expensive!  $16.99 for the fried chicken dinner.  I'm aware that's not ""expensive."" I'm not trying to come off as cheap andI know it comes with three sides, but that's just too much money for the portion size.  The chicken was tasty, the pieces were tiny(and I don't eat large meals). Most of the dinners were around $16.99 to $18.99 which might be fine for other items, but not for fried chicken.  

I'll concede that I do not remember the prices of their sandwiches and breakfasts, but the dinner was overpriced for what I received.  Maybe if the pieces of chicken were larger I'd have less of an issue, but it's still too much money for fried chicken. for the price of the ribs, we should have received a rack.

TL:DR - Save 60% and go to Church's for a better dinner.

Ordered fried chicken and a bunch of extra sides to try. Here's the breakdown:

Fried chicken - single coating, over-salted, semi crunchy, dark meat OK, white meat destroyed through overcooking.

Corn - fresh out of the can, hardly even drained.

Okra - same as the chicken, except somehow even saltier.

Hush puppies - dry.

Mac and cheese - probably the best side here, done right.

Fries - awful. Limp, soggy, and yet cooked so dark they look like burnt sweet potato fries.

Potato salad - did they buy it from Albertsons next door?

Peach cobbler - undercooked and swimming in juice.

WHAT ""REAL"" SOUTHERN FEEL IS EVERYONE SAYING THEY GET FROM STEPPING INTO THIS PLACE?!?! 

My husband and I just left this place highly disappointed! So my husband who was hyped about this place (because some other people hyped him about this place) so we decided to give it a try since it wasn't too far. 
It's tucked away off to the W. Warm Springs side of Alberton's...walking in I instantly did not like it. INSTANTLY. It is a small establishment so the minute we walked in we had to walk around a large group that was seated right in front of the door...who does that? I can barely hear any of the ladies greeting us and my husband sure as hell didn't hear them tell us we can sit anywhere we'd like because we stood in front of the register like dummies. Well hello to y'all too!  

When we finally figured out we could seat ourselves one of the ladies came over and handed us the menu...she was bleh as a server so whatever. But enough but about her. We opened the menu and I know my husband was thrown off by the PRICES!!! His statement, ""Soooo...this place is more expensive than Roscoe's Chicken & Waffles. It better blow my fucking mind!"" 

We wanted to use the Yelp check-in offer for 50% off of a 2nd dinner when you buy a dinner. So we chose something off of the ""Dinner"" section of the menu. We ordered 2 fountain drinks at $2.89 each! (Fucking expensive for a fountain drink that comes filled with nothing but ice even if the damn refills are free)...2 orders of chicken and waffles priced at $11.25 each, which we thought was a fair price for ""dinner"". 
We were first served the cornbread cake...which was good but nothing special...you can get this (same flavor and all) from any soul food restaurant. Then the OWNER brings me my food which I thought was nice. So I got 3 pieces of chicken on one large plate with swirls of grease decorating the plate here and there and a separate plate for the waffle and syrup. 

I. Was. NOT. Impressed. 

The presentation of the food didn't even look appetizing and the portions are ridiculously small!!! I sucked it up and didn't want to complain to my husband since he was so hyped about this place. He gets his 3 pieces of chicken on a large plate and we wait for his waffle. I'm not a rude-ass and would never eat if the rest of my party hadn't gotten their food...so we BOTH wait. It took them a few minutes to realize we weren't eating and why we weren't eating and finally one of the waitresses saw and went back to grab his waffle. Thanks. 

I nibbled on the chicken first and realized it tasted exactly like the seasoning that come in the Wai Wai MaMa noodles packages I get from the Asian store. Smh. It was ok...I was just expecting so much more. The waffle was toooooo soft. It just wasn't right. It wasn't a waffle. But the syrup for the waffle was tastey so it kinda made up for the texture of the waffle. 

So we finish eating and get the bill...it came out to $30.57. I asked if we can use the Yelp offer for the dinner...they said NO...""because we didn't order dinner."" Well that's mighty strange, given that the meal we ordered was listed under the ""Dinner"" section in the menu. 

I didn't want to cause a scene...we just decided to never return...and I mean never...not even for a second chance. Hubs didn't want to leave a tip...but I asked him to leave an $8 for the server that helped us the 2nd time around at least...She was very attentive and polite. So that one star is for her and only her.

Here's the breakdown:
Southern Ambience: 0
Food presentation: 0
Flavor: 2 (and that's for the cornbread cake)
Food Portion: -2 
Cost: -2
Southern Hospitality: 1 (for the 2nd waitress)
Crowd: -10 For that rude-ass lady cackling next to us. (But the restaurant has nothing to do with that) 
All around score: JUST GO SOME PLACE ELSE. 

***SIDE NOTE: No Roscoe's out here but Hash House A Go Go has a great chicken and waffle plate...yes it's expensive also...no it's not a soul food restaurant... but at least the portions are GINORMOUS, FLAVORFUL and worth every single penny.***

PS...I wonder if the owner has someone else review and edit her responses before posting them to Yelpers...these responses that I have read so far come across very rude, entitled and always unapologetic... you should work on that and all the above...just my opinion.",_73GdBatHqhhQ7fA83WkGQ,10,2,1,MeCHr0O0WTDFjjfV-9GUVw

I came in with my son to order carry out. I ordered the catfish dinner, chicken and waffle, and an order of peach cobbler. 

I live very close to soul food cafe, don't even have to go through a cross light to get home. I pay for my food, leave, go home and open the food. Somehow, even though I ordered and waited 20 minutes, my food is lukewarm. The fried okra is barely warm. The so called hot and fresh peach cobbler which was 6.50 is smooshed in this tiny container and is ICE COLD!!! 

My sides besides the okra was the Mac and cheese which tastes okay, the hush puppies are decent, my catfish tastes good and my mom seems to be enjoying her chicken and waffles. 

A lady who was very nice came up to me with a card to vote Soul Food Cafe for best in Las Vegas soul food while I waited, which I did. I wish I hadn't. Flavor wise, they are way better in my opinion than nasty M&M soul food on charleston, but they are marked down two full stars for not giving me hot food.

She's not the most adventurous eater, but figured this was different though safe of a choice. 

They serve you a cornbread cake while you wait which was yummy. I'm a sucker for those things and probably could make a meal off that and some greens alone. 

I decided on the fried chicken lunch with dark meat, greens and red beans and rice. The leg and thigh were seasoned nicely and the crunch was good on the pieces. I absolutely loved the sides. To my taste, the greens were flavored well and I like when it's cooked to tender but the stems still have some give and not cooked to super soft. I could eat more of those greens because texture is everything for me on greens. Beans and rice was also good. 

My MIL wanted gravy and biscuits and they juuusstt stopped serving breakfast at 11am and we were closer to noon.They said they can make it for her though. When it came out she had some reservations as it isn't traditional, but once she took a bite she said that it was tasty. Instead of white country gravy, they used brown gravy and added griddled ground beef to it. She said though the biscuits texture was awesome and one of the better biscuits she had and she kinda liked the brown gravy as that's more flavorful that most country gravy. 

Service was really friendly. Our server was nice and we appreciated they cooked her some biscuits anyways. If you get fried food, keep in mind there is a bit of a wait. There is one cook handling it all and frying takes a while. That was one of the few cons, but perhaps you can call ahead your order so it'll be ready when you get there to dine in. 

Keep in mind they have 3 slightly different menus for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Also the prices change during the time of day as well. My chicken lunch was $10 vs $16 for dinnertime. I think at $10 it was worth it, but I don't know about $16.

I didn't like how seasoned the chicken was the first time and though the waffle was soggy, so she advised me to tell the waitress light seasoning. The waitress was a little slow at first but was very nice . She talked to Shila  on the phone and surprisingly she remembered my name and told the waitress exactly how to make my chicken and waffles--light on seasoning and butter on the side. Was very impressed with how attentive the owner was in making sure I was happy.

-Corn bread was still AMAZING 
-Chicken was a little dry but definitely seasoned better than the first time. Rated really good!
-waffle was a little les soggy but still didn't have crunch to it

Service was mediocre.
 brought my water right away without even taking my order, but didn't ask me for lemon or if I wanted anything else to drink like she did to other tables
didn't make eye contact and walked off as soon as she gave me food
was able to keep up with 3 tables and phone calls quickly

It was pretty busy when we walked in on a Tuesday night.  They had the soul classics blaring through the speakers while the Lakers were on TV with their new lineup was tanking it against the Mavericks.  So far, so good!

Their menu offered all the soul offerings you would expect like fried chicken, ribs, fried catfish and all the usual suspects for sides.  My wife opted for the smothered chicken ($14) which was fried chicken drenched in gravy.  That was excellent.  The gravy was really good but we would consider ordering fried chicken with a side of gravy so we could enjoy the crisp of the chicken which was nonexistent post smothering.  

I opted for the turkey wings ($14) which consisted of 2 big assed baked turkey wings smothered in gravy.  Even though the gravy was the same for both, they tasted quite different based on the preparation of the meat.  

You get 3 sides per entree unless you get chicken and waffles.  3 sides is more than enough and all the ones we tried were on point.  That included collard greens in some amazing sauce, delectably sweet sweet potatoes, red rice and beans with great sausage flavor and the mac+cheese.  The cornbread they gave was in pancake form and went terrific with syrup.

No free refills on drinks and they charge $1.50 for water so you might as well get sweet tea, Kool Aid or lemonade for $2.

Of course, I took full advantage of the free Yelp check-in offer, free small side!  I been on that back in the dizzle crave so had to go with the liver and onions, naturally.  Sides included cornbread, fried okra, yams and potato salad.  My partner got the chicken and waffles and house cornbread order.  When asked about drinks, our waitress Latrice, went over the drinks and mentioned a sugar momma and sugar daddy. We was rolling, I asked how old was the former, and likewise my partner regarding the latter...too hilarious!  We stuck with water and lemon after a good chuckle.

The restaurant can be food nestled in the north east corner of the shopping center, next door to the barber shop, no generalizing please.  It can be in the cut, in fact, I think that is what the barber shop is named next door...lol.  

The place is simply decorated and well kept with a large view of the kitchen area.  The walls are adorned with some boxing and sporting memorabilia and sure it will build through time.  The staff is warm and friendly and attentive.  

The servings are above average and very filling in addition to the various sides that can be ordered.  This place has good comfort food, but there wasn't anything that stood out.  Then again, I have not tried everything yet, so think its fair to rate this place a ""3"" for the time being and will be updated accordingly as I frequent.

The best thing about the place is the location since there is not much soul food in the lower southwest area.  This provides that needed flavor to satisfy any craving if you are in the mood for good southern food.",ewDNa_FRoG71UFm56eTGkw,6,1,3,oUH0VcJfch_3pQbeAlC6jg

Strange thing, she ordered rice and gravy as a side. The gravy on the rice and gravy was totally different than the gravy on the smothered chicken. The gravy on the rice had a horrible flavor and was not good. The gravy on the meat was good.
I can't understand any place making sweet tea with tap water. Not good. Leaves that tap water flavor. Yech. Price was steep, food was pretty good. Service was good, 3:30 in afternoon.",CIfb8avje6UhqQZaF74VVg,0,0,3,-zUZwoaAK9d9W3bD_FDHog

Clearly you people out here in Vegas don't know good soul food!! I went on heir direct website to place my order. On their site it says FREE DELIVERY WITH PURCHASE OF $25 or more. Imagine my surprise when I click to place order and I am redirected to grubhub. That's also fine until I notice a delivery charge. Hmm that should t be though my order was $58  So imagine my confusion. Yet and still I was so hungry I placed the order. I ordered 2 small sugar daddy drinks. Both $3.00 comes up to a total of $11 and some change and doesn't show or explain how $6 turns into $11. Yet and still I ordered. I ordered 3 wings Mac & cheese and yams. I also ordered chicken breast with Mac & cheese and rice with beans. In the special directions space. I requested that my chicken wings be cut in half. I receive my order and oh boy just bad. The chicken wings were decent. Nothing to brag about NO they were not cut in half as I had requested. The Mac & cheese was salty to bloodclot! Am the yams were just ok, also nothing to brag about. The Cornbread! Oh lord the Cornbread or whatever that was looked like a pancake and did not taste like Cornbread at all!! Not even the texture was like Cornbread. My 3 wings ended up being 2 wings and a weird piece of some kind of meat. Couldn't tell what it was. My chicken breast meal was not chicken breast. It was also chicken wings ?. My sister doesn't eat chicken wings which is why I ordered her chicken breast! All in all the order and service was mediocre. I can assure you that I will never waste my money here EVER Again!! What a shame the reviews and pics make you think otherwise and I don't have another $60 to waste to see if it was a fluke. Even though my coworkers told me after the fact that the food is bad.

I ordered the corned beef hash with potatoes and a side of waffles. I totally enjoyed the breakfast. Corned beef hash must have been cooked with butter or something because it was pretty rich compared to other hashes i've had. their waffles tasted pretty good as well. 

Although I finished my whole breakfast, it wasn't a meal that totally stuck in my head. I'm sure they've changed a couple things since then, but i'm in no rush to re-try this place.",USa8wGjYp_gCl0a_EXbBcg,0,1,3,N2bqzljJaj__XBor4tm0Hw

The portions are slopped on the plate and way too big. The overall look is gross. I learned that you first eat with your eyes and then your mouth .

With a quick browse on yelp, we found ""Soul Food Cafe"" and were immediately struck. Not only was it called ""soul food"", but the reviews were good and the photos confirmed our excitement to try something new. As we pull up, the store front is simple, and not extra like a lot of spots try to be in Vegas. Nothin to front. As we all rushed in, we were greeted n seated at a table with a smile and some simple menus that showed some great comfort eats. Fried chicken and waffles for three of us, and meatloaf for the forth made for an enticing wait. Admittedly at first glance we were haters of the prices that initially seemed a bit high from our normal budgets (we broke boiis) but as soon as the made to order food was served, we knew that everything was boutta be gucci. Two of the orders came out as wings instead of breast but that was immediately brought to attention by our lovely host and another new batch was made right away. I've only tried the mainstream fried chicken spots but damn, this was one of the best I've had. The unexpected johnny cakes (flat cornbread) was absolutely amazing, the waffles were golden and had a kiss of cinnamon flavor, the syrup wasn't overwhelmingly sweet like some places, the butter was on point, and of course the chicken, both the wings and the breast pieces were lit. The fried portion was crispy, clean, and damn tasty. The chicken itself was filling, juicy, and the squad literally all said ""oh. yo. I f*ck with this heavy."" Needless to say, the lovely hospitality, amazing food, and good environment calls for a hopeful revisit soon. Maybe even for breakfast as the menu looked promising for that as well.

It is conveniently located in the South West area. Their prices are decent for their serving size. Of course I had to get the chicken and waffles. Every meal comes with corn bread. And when I was thinking they would be small, they're actually pretty big, warm, and delicious! Unlike what you would expect. Their waffles are thin and good sized. But doesn't compare to Roscoe's crispy nature. Their wings are good as well if you don't mind getting down and dirty. What makes the taste even better is the hot sauce that they provide. I got the Mac and cheese as a side and it is very cheesy and smooth. Service is good, nothing to complain about. They're really nice and always greet you when you come in. Usually if it's not busy they let you sit yourself. I always catch myself tipping them nicely.
