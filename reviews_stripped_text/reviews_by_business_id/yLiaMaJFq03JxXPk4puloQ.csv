Good:  

+Clean
+Cool salt water fish tank
+Kiosks were cool, worked as expected
+Android Pay worked
+Added Order Number/placard to bring to table (assuming so food runner person would find us)
+Greeted by staff to ask if needed any help with kiosk (did not, but cool we were greeted)
+Food (breakfast) was good, as expected for McDonald's -- no complaints.
+Person that brought food was very nice and asked if we had everything.

Bad:
+After ordering, paid, sat down.  Waited 15 minutes.  Wanted process to play out.  Got up at about 18 minutes and approached same person that asked if I needed help to confirm they had order.  He said yes.   I see a few other reviews here about tactical management.  I get the impression based on my observation after I got up and went over to the counter is the manager/supervisor does not understand how the technology works.  It was if our order was in a different ""queue"" and only once I said something, our order was prepared.
+Order had additional items, assuming from other orders (based on the stickers attached to the items).  What we ordered was on tray, so maybe not totally a ""bad"" thing, but assume someone else might have missed something
+Did not acknowledge problem/time to get order out

Summary.

Again, I wanted to see a future McDonalds's -- close experience, chasing Chik-fla-a in the model.  I will give it another shot.  I understand this location is a pilot location for the new system.

We have been here multiple times because my son likes to use the touch screen system to order our food, but this time we have a problem with our food. My son ordered 20 piece chicken nuggets and I ordered a happy meal with 4 piece chicken nuggets. As I opened my box one of my nuggets was half bitten. I spoke to an employee who was going around the lobby and she took my box of chicken nuggets and replaced it with a brand new one. My son then opened his box of chicken nuggets and to our surprise there was another piece of half bitten chicken nuggets. I once again spoke to the same employee and told her this is the second time we found half bitten chicken nuggets. While im talking to her, a guy came to talk to me in a loud tone of voice asking me whats the problem. I explained the situation but instead of apologizing to me for the inconvenience, he spoke to me in a loud very rude and unfriendly voice being obnoxious and arrogant. I asked to speak to the manager and come to find out he is the manager. I cant believe a manager would talk to a customer like that in an argumentative and rude voice. He should be nice and apologize to me since one of his employees put a half bitten nugget in not one, but two of our orders. The managers name is Derrick, he refused to provide his last name but he is a bald guy. The first time me and my son ate here we already noticed this manager was yelling and screaming at his employees. He doesn't seem to care if the customers are looking. Me and my son are very very dissappointed in this place due to that managers nasty atitude. Its too bad because we always eat here and the employees are friendly and nice.

2029925,2017-11-06,2,yLiaMaJFq03JxXPk4puloQ,"This is the location closest to my home. While I don't eat at McDonald's often, I visit enough to say confidently that this place has fallen off since their recent remodel. I don't know if that has anything to do with it. What I do know is that, after three consecutive ""problematic"" visits, I may have to bite the bullet and drive a little further to a more reliable alternate location. 

The visit prior to the most recent had to be the absolute worst. We stopped by for late night eats, so it was reasonable to expect some delay and, perhaps, not as fresh food. What we experienced was a half an hour wait to get our food, followed by a request to pull into a spot for fresh fries. The extra wait would have been fine had the fries been fresh. By the time we got home - a 2 minute drive on a bad day - the fries were cold, stiff, and tasteless and the rest of our order was mostly incorrect. 

Fast forward to this last visit AKA the third visit in a row where we were served HORRIBLE fries. By horrible, I mean room temperature, soggy, stale, and bland. THIRD TIME IN A ROW. How can you be the home of Julia Child's choice last meal (McD's fries), serve what you serve, and continue to take people's money for it?

It's a shame, too, because the staff here is actually really great. Considering I almost exclusively use the drive-thru and have an opinion on quality of service is a testament to the folks working the windows.

 First of all when you walk in it's so clean so kept up and there's a really cool aquarium feature in the middle of the room. You to sit around thw aquarium and enjoy your food or enjoy from a distance. When you walk up to what would be the counter area at you're greeted by 4 self-serve machines that allow you to place your order and pay. 

I suppose that this is McDonald's response to the minimum wage increase of $15 an hour for labor. I was very surprised to customize my vegan order through the machine and have the items come out 100% to specification. When I placed my order with people, it's often incorrect. I really appreciate the machines accuracy. 

The employees bringing your food to the table, it gives you the ability to have one-on-one service in a fast food environment. Overall I absolutely enjoyed my experience I thought it was really cool design, really clean and the aquarium added a nice ambiance that wasn't expecting at all.

This is the worst experience I've had at this McDonald's location, which is the nearest to my house. I decided to go inside and order take out because the drive thru had a long line. Boy was that a bad idea. I walked in, and there's only one person in line ordering. So I order my food at the self service kiosk. I was helped by a young black man and he is by far the best worker I have ever dealt with in a fast food establishment. If the owner is reading this, help pay this kids tuition for college because if he keeps his good attitude and work ethic, he is going to go places. Anyway after placing my order, I'm waiting. I see my burgers are already made, but they skip my bag and place fries in multiple bags, which ordered after me, and give those people their food. I ask what I'm waiting for, and they say for my fries. I then tell them people who ordered after have received their orders, with fries, but they just look at me with a dead stare!? Lmao. All of the females working behind the counter have no sense of urgency in the way they work. It's busy as hell, and they're moving at a turtle pace. Fire the manager!!! It is his/her fault his employees work this way. I mean I understand it's a busy environment, and yall deserve more than minimum wage, but definitely not the $15 that fast food workers are fighting for. Especially not the employees at this location during this time. Chick-fil-A, Raising Cane's, and In-n-Out are the only fast food places where I think the employees deserve to make $15 to start. Why? Because they provide excellent guest service and work hard and at a fast pace, because they're management makes sure they do. And the lines at those three places are way, way longer than any line I've ever seen at a McDonalds. The owner needs to be aware of how his managers are running his business. And at this particular time, it was really bad. Also the fries were undercooked and soft, probably because they rushed to make it after I asked them what's going on.",ZNGnpdlLGGqpWjEcR49QKA,0,0,1,h0j9BFy1WG9WfenJK934sw

5918843,2017-10-16,7,yLiaMaJFq03JxXPk4puloQ,"Reasons why McDonald's is popular around the world. 

1. Because wherever you go, at least in the same country*, the food you order should not surprise you. A Big Mac ordered while on vacation in Miami will be just like the one you order back home in San Francisco. 

2. French fries are bomb. 

3. Most American kids grew up on this stuff and have positive memories of it. Obesity issues aside.

4. In emerging markets, McD is actually perceived to be high end and does serve quality ingredients prepared in a sanitary condition relative to local standards and practices. Couples go out on dates to McD and not for cheap dates either!!!

* In Hawaii, the McD do have some unique menu offerings not available in most locations on the mainland.

** Not as much now after vegans complained about the fries being fried in beef fat. But still better than the soggy fresh ones from In & Out and Five Guys.

Overall, I too still have good will towards this iconic business. Do I wish the food was as good and big as it was when I was much younger? You know, before McD execs succumb to the pressure to show quarter over quarter & year over year earnings reports drove the corporation to implement cuts that traded quality and quantity for short term gains. Eff Yes!

So it is ironic that McD has been trying to shore up their balance sheets by trying to serve up a revised menu featuring sandwiches using higher quality ingredients and higher profit margins, and installing ordering kiosks and updating the looks of their new stores.

Anyway, this McD location sharing the building with a gas station convenience store has many of the cosmetic upgrades and even features a fairly large aquarium with a few varieties of common salt water fish for dine-in customers to enjoy viewing during their meals. F A N C Y!

But on my most recent and only visit inside this location, I was just there to redeem my BYGO Caramel Macchiato (Iced), which the kiosk had no problem accepting. And payment via credit card was accepted right at the kiosk as well. The interaction with any staff was kept to a minimum, when my order was finally ready to be picked up.

It would be a higher rated review, but one of two of my large Iced Nonfat Caramel Macchiato order, emphasis on the ICE, was gone while I started to drink it waiting for a safe opportunity to make a left turn out of the parking lot. It probably started out with 70-80% ice, so that was rather disappointing. I guess next time, if there is a next time at this location (seeing how other reviewers have had similar experiences), I will ask if ""light ice"" can be accommodated. 

Taste-wise it was decent, but not really loving it (It being the lackluster price to value ration). But at least it was Buy One Get One with the mobile McD app promo I redeemed.

Wait time was longer than expected too, probably because drive-thru is popular. But you can check the monitor to see if your order number is In Progress or Ready for pick up, so at least you can keep yourself in the loop on the status of your order.

P.S. Rod, I bumped this review up the queue so your prediction can come true. Haha.",RQlnSCjuqMnhR3Qk6j4KoA,10,6,2,c-pT1k3Y8H7t-3LRduqSkg
