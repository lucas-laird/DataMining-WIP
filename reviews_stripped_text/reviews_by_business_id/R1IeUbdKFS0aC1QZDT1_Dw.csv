20467,2017-07-08,1,R1IeUbdKFS0aC1QZDT1_Dw,"I was surprised by my experience here seeing as there are so many nice reviews. 

I came in and started with the new nuong rolls which were great but I can't say the same for the beef meatball pho. The meatballs were riddled with pieces of bone (which is really off putting) and my boyfriend ordered the flank pho. He had to keep pulling out scrappy fat off the already minimal amount of meat in his dish. We weren't checked up on at all. The wait staff seemed to be enjoying the episodes of Friends they were playing though. It made me feel like an unwelcome guest in someone's home. I just walked up to the counter after a while and asked if I could pay and leave. I had a really bizarre lingering taste in my mouth after I left reminiscent of old or stale food. The service doesn't really have to be stellar for me but the food has to at least be better than mediocre for me to come back. 

I used to come to this place when it was Nem Nuong Bistro and I think some if not most of these positive reviews are from the previous establishment.",qjzfWkh0KUcYccmDBfe6dw,1,0,1,OHxSRQbAp9CKQObOUHG2NQ
23024,2016-06-21,1,R1IeUbdKFS0aC1QZDT1_Dw,"Possibly the only reason I came was because it was $4.99, and it seems to be the only reason I would come back again.

First, it's almost exactly what you should expect it to be; cheap, small, tasteless with not many options. I'd have to say the service is fast, but the staff is not very aware of what they have to offer so make sure you are clear on what you are ordering.

I saw previous reviews being able to order certain things like 3 color drinks, but apparently they were out of that on a Tuesday Morning at a little before 11am (not like the place was packed, one or two tables before we got in).

Pho was a small bowl, choice between the combination or rare steak. I've seen reviews of this being the best, compared to so-Cal and other places, I gotta say this is some VERY mediocre bowl of pho at best. Broth was a bit on the salty side, and whoever said this is the best bowl of pho must've been recovering from a bad hangover (coz then anything would've tasted great)!

I was going to give one star, but the speed of service, and you really can't beat the special price of $4.99! I'll add a star for you...but make sure your staff is more clear on what's available and what's not!",bQB92eT209nALBAOnwhUHw,2,0,2,19VG8a7-F0hXF3UOLyJLBw

We've been here 3 times since Friday 6/3/16 and never failed! Let me break it down:

1. Fast service and great customer service - they usually come back to check if you need anything else after all food is delivered to the table. The wait is not long either!

2. So far we've tried- Nem nuong cuon, goi cuon, banh khot, Cha gio, hu tieu nam vang with pho and with clear noodle, bun bo hue, desert, coffee, chrysanthemum tea and pennyworth drink... Never failed!

3. The restaurant is very clean!

360860,2016-05-26,3,R1IeUbdKFS0aC1QZDT1_Dw,"In summary the reason i give this place 2 star is lots of msg and noodle, too little meat and too much msg in the pho. Dont take your date here or she will call you cheapo. The second reason was too much noodle in the spring roll and not enogh shrimp. I expect good quality and not quantity. I rather pay full price instead of saving a buck and ended up dumping the whole bowl of noodle. IMO, this place only changes its names. It is going from bad to worse. See details below.
I ordered a combination to go and I was very disappointed (see photo). The price was ok but there was not enough meat to finish the huge amount of noodle. The pho is worse than it used to be when it was nem nuong bistro. I refer to the amount of meat. Pho is about meat. If there is not enough meat, there will be a lot of msg or msg equivalent. As a matter of fact after the 1st spoonfool, my tongue and lips became very dry and sensituve. It is the symptom of too much msg. I had to down lots of water and dumped the rest of the pho. I gave it a D as in D'eliciuuus. The steak meat was so small compared to Kim Long and other Pho restaurants in China Town. I ended up going to Kim Long. Don't give discounted price while you increase the noodle and cut down the meat. Pho is about meat and not msg. We are not blind.
I also ordered spring roll and eggroll and get free desert. The desert was ok. I like the shaved ice.
Again, the Spring was full of noodle and there was only 3 small half pcs of shrimp. I used to see 4 pcs at other restaurant. I guess we get what we paid for.",lFlJGqYcirNXWo1WZ2xqpQ,0,0,2,YR1usNtDcDrDaLJTYCcAGg

The service is excellent and the food is pretty good.  

We had chicken noodles (Ph Gà ?i B), Shrimp & crab udon (Bánh Canh Tôm Cua), broken rice with shredded pork, steamed egg with mince pork & mushroom, Deep Fried Tofu Wrap, grilled porkchop (Cm Tm Bì, Ch, Tàu H Ky, Sn Nng) or grilled pork (tht nng.  They shouldn't add fried onion in chicken noodle, yet the chicken is very delicious.  

The reason we thought that the owner could improve when giving them 4 stars only because the ice coffee with condense milk (cà phê sa ?á) wasn't good.  We had to ask for more coffee to lessen the sweetness.

The bottom line is all dishes, except coffee are good.  The place is pretty clean, neat and nice.  If we go to Vegas again, we will definitely come here to eat.

I roll in around before 9pm (they close at 10pm) As I get seated I'm given a ""Holiday Menu"" which is a double sided plastic page holder. Clearly a very condensed from their regular menu. Wasn't craving Pho but good Vietnamese food and something that a friend recommended. When I ask the waitress for the regular menu she looked surprised and then asked what would I like that is off the menu. I tell that I simply wanted an easy order of grilled pork which they serve with other items on the menu along with lettuce leaves and bean sprouts. She said no problem. She comes back a minute later and says that the chef can't do that. When I ask the waitress, she has shrugs her shoulder with a stupid look on her face and says ""I don't know""' Ha! 
The reason why is the mofo chef doesn't want to because he and his staff are lazy which is what I figured out from getting a ""Holiday menu"" so they have to prepare else and they can leave on time at 10pm

- Food: Friend tried out one of the pho dishes and I ordered a charbroiled pork rice dish. Verdict? The pork was moist with good char; and not overly salty as I had at other places. The pho broth was on point with lots of good flavor and not oily. Pork loaf spring rolls (don't know why they're called in Vietnamese) were refreshing with this sweet sauce that its dipped in.

- Service: Very fast. Super polite. Staff was knowledgeable on food allergies. They were accommodating to check the ingredients just in case.

- Façade - Everything was clean: dishes, silverware, floors, bathrooms, etc. Been to some other places in town and they were definitely subpar in this regard.

I see they have 3 or 4 waiter/waitresses, and sometimes doing nothing until they have to take orders, which is great but I think the back kitchen needs more help.

My main dish, Bun Bo Hue (spicy beef noodle soup) can be challenging to cook properly. My mother was born and raised in Hue - so naturally, I would like to say that I am very particular to how Bun Bo Hue SHOULD taste. This place nails the broth very well! My only qualm is that they don't put in the pork blood (which would add another level of authenticity to the dish), but the soup comes very close to tasting almost home made. 

The staff is great!

The good (and maybe bad?) part about this restaurant is that it's never packed.

I had yet to find a broth I like more than pho Saigon 8.... But then I stumbled across this gem. It was DELICIOUS. The price was way cheaper than usual also. For the three of us getting regular sized portions it was only 21$!!! The waiters were so nice by making sure we always had refills of our water and anything we needed. We then also had the choice of a free beverage or a free dessert. We all chose macaroons after!

The only thing I would have to give negative feedback on is that I ordered the pho with just rare steak and my boyfriend ordered the combination meat pho. Our waiter didn't write down our order and brought us both combination pho. I don't necessarily like all of the different meats but I didn't mind picking around it. 

My last and final complaint was that when we decided to pick macaroons after we were done eating we didn't realize they only had four flavors left and they were all kind of weird. Granted we did go at 10pm I just wish we knew ahead of time. I got the lavender and threw it out after one bite but my sister loved her coconut one.

Highlights:
1). Speed - The food came out in less than 5 minutes after we ordered.  

Lowlights:
1). Unnecessary wait time for the number of staff - The place was almost half empty on a Tuesday afternoon.  There were tables (for previous large groups) that had not been cleared and there was no bus person in sight. We waited for about 15 minutes, while no one bothered to clear the tables.  Maybe the bus person called in sick that day, but it seemed that all the wait staff kind of passed the tables hoping that another coworker would clear the tables, and finally someone caved in and cleared the tables.

2). A bit on the dirty side - Upon walking to our table, there were food scraps on the floor and when we were seated, it was clear the table was cleaned in a rush.  Ex: greasy green onion from the prior guests, sauce splatter on the wall and the little picture nook, and dust at the bottom of the chopstick/spoon/sauce dish container.  Kind of makes you hesitant to see how clean the back kitchen is.

The vermicelli bowl I ordered had veggies that tasted like they had been cut on a dirty cutting board. A funky taste here and there that reminds you of a dirty kitchen rag smell.

3). Staff - Everyone working seemed nice, but just a little inexperienced.  Perhaps with time, things will go more smoothly, but it seemed that there were plenty of wait staff without designated serving areas or clear tasks.   We didn't bother waiting to get our check and just went up to the counter to pay, as it seemed like no one was going to notice.",eGui9O_XKaxz9rOXfFW9PA,0,0,2,NNMMWzmdrP7FWJmEJoRFdA

I ordered the #16 beef ball and flank. It was $6.95
I also order the #1 pork sausage spring roll. $4.95

It was a little slow getting my order but I know that if spring rolls are made fresh that they can take a minute. They were fresh and tasty, bulging with greens and a nice split piece of sausage on top. The special sauce looked like peanut sauce with some kind of oil. I think I would've rather had the plain peanut sauce although the roll was pretty good on its own. 

The pho was piping hot and looked really fresh. I ordered the cooked bean sprouts because I've never had them like that. It basically makes them easier to manage being cooked already which was cool. The noodles were long and very soft with a lot of volume. Awesome. The broth was super clean but just a little on the bland side. Personally, I like my broth with more star anise and cinnamon giving it a little extra sweetness. But, that's just me. I did order the small bowl but it was a little lacking in meat content. I think only one split beef ball and a few pieces of flank which is fine but I felt bad wasting my dish of Hoison and Sriracha because there wasn't much to dip in it. Not a huge problem. Overall, I would give just a little above average. Nothing really spectacular from the plethora of other pho shops around town. It was quiet and peaceful. I was there at 5pm on a holiday Friday Weekend ( Halloween ). It is newly remodeled which helped m the atmosphere. If it falls, it will drop too below average. I wish the best for the owner.

The girl that greeted us at the table thank us for waiting and ask to take our drink order; I said to myself ""wow, a Vietnamese place with great customer service"". After a little while another waitress came to take our food order and she was great too. Now I am very impress. After our order. They came back twice to let us know they don't have spring rolls that comes with our bun so we have to cancel that order. Then again a different waitress this time came back and let us know they don't have the rice we ordered with the chicken and ask we we want to sub it for steam rice instead. We have to cancel that too. So I said to the waitress. Wow you guys don't have a lot of stuff we ordered ( mind you they only have a few items on the menu, just pho,bun, com. Basic Vietnamese menu). She said to me. 
We have been busy
I said. Well it is the holidays and you guys are out of stuff. 
She said. Yeah we have been busy because it's the holidays. 
I said. Yeah that is why you are suppose to stock up 
She said. Yeah we have been busy and by now I can hear the attitude from her voice. 
First of all. You job is to apology to me when you are out of stuff. It is your business to serve me the stuff you have in the menu and when you don't you apologize instead of being argumentative. Now I realize it is just like any other typical Vietnamese restaurants. 

My second disappointment 
When the waitress brought the food out she held the bowl of pho right in front of her chest and she is announcing what it is. Now. I don't know about you but I do not want the waitress to be talking over my food especially that close. Don't they know that is very unhygienic. I do not want your spit in my food. 
So I told her just to put the food down and don't have to tell me what it is. 

3rd. 
We ordered 5 bowls of pho and 1 super size and they brought us 2 plates of bean sprouts that other restaurants would have given for 2 bowls of pho.  In the middle of eating we asked for extra and it never came. 

This restaurant might have gotten a 4 stars prob cause they are usually not busy so it's hard to fuck up something. 

Over all the pho is just mediocre. 

I would never give this place another chance. 

I left first and didn't know they charged 18% service fee cause we have 10people. They did not indicate that in the menu. They were lucky I wasn't there otherwise I would not have paid and would have given them a piece of my mind.   

They really think they deserve 18% for that kind of service.

It's not the best pho I've ever tasted, but it's the best pho in Vegas so far. I would definitely come back here for a hangover cure for sure.",YW2WY72AcmGrRVxE42ZKkw,4,2,4,iC8VQJjiZq4qZoe_ZwDqMA

Before I get to the good part, let's talk about the customer service. Other than being greeted and seated right away, everything else was pretty bad. The very first pho place we went to that forgot to give us the garnishes. Being busy setting up the kids' food, we didn't even realize it until moments later. When we finally asked for them, we still had to wait a while before getting them on our table. 

When we needed something, we had to raise our hands or look their way in hopes of catching someone's attention. Nobody came back to ask us if everything was ok or if we needed anything. No napkins were given until we asked. Not even one! They would frequently be gathered in a group at the counter or at a table. When they (waiters/waitresses) were at the table, 2 sets of couples lapped up. 

About the food! Pho was mediocre. Not as tasty as many other places in the city. The fried Cornish hen was pretty good. The Haiyan chicken however, made me want to throw up. The skin was so yellow, that was the first turn off! Secondly, it didn't taste like the Haiyan chicken I have ate in the past. Could also just be the fact that the chicken skin was hello and it just killed it for me then on! 

In conclusion, we won't be coming back!",LgFDWZTLi1w9OGi5BtKORg,0,0,2,8pNOXe23EHZbGzLHhIce0g

She said that's correct and confirmed that the offer was still good. We then asked again if it's good for the oxtail pho and she said yes it was good for all the pho. Our mind was blown and we ordered!

The Nem Nuong Cuon was delicious. I especially liked the sauce that came on the side. It's different than the usual sauces I get from other Vietnamese restaurants. It was thick and a bit tangy.

I ordered the Shrimp Pho since none of the other pho they had listed had tripe. This was a disappointment. The shrimps were small and overcooked. It tasted like rubber.

For the drinks, we selected Thai Ice Tea. It was way too sweet. Too much sugar taste and not enough of the Thai flavoring.

When the check arrived, the bowls of pho were charged for full price while the two Thai Ice Tea drinks we ordered were $0. We asked the waitress and she was confused. Then another waiter came by and we explained the situation. They spoke among themselves in Vietnamese and the waiter then said that the $4.99 pho is for a smaller bowl and what we got was a regular bowl. We explained to him that that's not what our waitress said, she didn't say anything about a smaller bowl, and we specific wanted the $4.99 special. The waiter said that it was a misunderstanding and nothing can be done since we already ate the pho. (How is it a misunderstanding??? We specifically said we wanted the $4.99 special. They must have known or else why would they charge us $0 for the drinks?) This went on for 5 minutes and the waiter said that he was willing to waive the appetizer but can't do anything about the bowls of pho, which would have to be regular price. By this point my husband was fed up with the entire situation and he just handed over the credit card. 

As the waiter and waitress were at the cash register adjusting our bill (complimentary appetizer but charging us the full price for the 2 bowls of pho), I was able to find the Yelp photo which had the advertisement. I brought it to the register to show them that nowhere did it say a smaller bowl of pho and we were not told. The guy just kept on saying it was a misunderstanding.

When the check was brought back by our waitress, she said they adjusted so it's the combo price.

The entire check situation was a waste of time and unprofessional. I don't understand how a misunderstanding on the waitress' part makes us, the customer, liable for paying for it. Yes they eventually charged us $4.99 but this whole thing could have been avoided if the waitress was properly trained.

PS Call before you come in the evening. They don't stick to their hours listed. When we were there, they were turning people away at 8pm, even though they hand written a note saying they were closing at 9pm (official closing hour is midnight).",qlaVQkSxKcqfHJhoZU3rKg,4,0,2,HnUn3E2XVPtwVflYphep1g

2803671,2016-07-06,0,R1IeUbdKFS0aC1QZDT1_Dw,"Ok a huge disappointment. My family has been going to this place a while now. It was Nem Nuong Bistro months ago but now it changed owner or whatever. We ordered 2 Nem Nuong cuon, a special combination pho, a crispy skin hen with red rice, and a Hue's beef noodle soup (bun bo hue). Let me tell you, only 2 out of 4 dishes made it, and one of them was an small appetizer.

The special combo pho was delicious, good flavorful broth, good meat portion. The Nem Nuong cuon was also really fresh and delicious, great fillings, and the bean dipping sauce was awesome. 

Two great dishes and then came the horrible ones. Let me tell you, the crispy hen rice dish was bad. The chicken was so dried, lacked flavor and under-seasoned. The rice was soggy, had a weird taste and just unpleasant. My dad just left the dish uneaten. Mine was the Hue's beef noodle soup (bun bo hue). When it first came out, it smelled right how it should be. But when I tasted it, it was sour! I thought it was my palate but when my parents tasted it, it was sour for real. So I got it replaced but the second bowl wasn't any better. The beef cut was so THICK and I couldn't chew through it. The broth was bland like water, under-seasoned, though the spicy sate sauce was very good. I ordered it because usually that soup is good in every Vietnamese restaurant and it was a safe bet. What a huge disappointment! 

Oh and the server guy was so clueless about the dishes there. We asked if he could recommend some popular dishes there that people order the most and he couldn't tell us. ""Everything here is good"" like what? Though the girl servers were so nice and polite so that saved it. The pricing was fine, nothing was overpriced. The menu has a nice variety of Vietnamese food but idk about the quality.

Our waitor brought us water right away. Their menu was easy to follow and had pictures which really helped my in-laws, whom don't read English, choose what to eat. Eventually we choose the special large pho noodles, shrimp fried rice, egg rolls, and the pork spring rolls. 

The sauce that came with the pork spring roll is delicious. I've always had the normal hoisin base sauce but this one is sweet, sour, and peanuty which complimented the rolls well. The egg rolls are pretty good. I loved that they provided fresh mint, betel leaves, pickled carrot / daikon, cucumber, and lettuce to wrap the egg rolls in. 

Now for the pho, the broth is just ok. Better than most pho places in the Midwest. They put in a lot of slices of beef and tendon. So for someone who likes a lot of meat in their pho, won't complain.

3362808,2016-11-28,0,R1IeUbdKFS0aC1QZDT1_Dw,"$4.99 PHO?! NO WAY! But hold it, although it may seem like an awesome deal, if you really think about it, price-to-portion wise, it's not. Vietnamese restaurants usually have two sizes, small/regular or large. The bowl you get here for the $4.99 is essentially like picking from the kid's meal. **Also to note, the $4.99 deal doesn't apply to all Pho, only a few. 

So: 
*Small: kid's size ($4.99)
*Large: actually regular size and also similar to the price you would see for a regular at other restaurants ($8) 
*Super-size: though it may look tall in length, it looks proportional to the large at other viet restaurants. It's like the theory of conservation from psychology for those of you familiar with it. ($11, a tad more expensive compared to others) 

So don't go in thinking the ""Large"" is actually a large, this will help you pick the right size for your hunger level lol. But for those of you who could care less about the size, the pho here is pretty good! Food-wise I would give a 4. 

Service-wise I would a 2.5. Walked in and the first lady was very welcoming. Our waiter was a guy with glasses who tried to memorize our order, but that actually turned out to be a failed and bad idea because he gave me the wrong pho. There were about 5 people inside total, include my girlfriend and I, and they never came back around to refill water or anything. The waiters just seemed to spend most of the time in the back. 

PARKING: plenty, plaza lot

Anyway, walked in and was promptly seated. Three other tables were occupied when we got there (around 8pm?)

We were given glasses of water right away along with menus. As for the service after our food was given, that's a whole different story.

We started off with nem nuong as an appetizer and I got the large flank pho and the gf got the large beef ball pho as main.

The grilled sausage was decent, no complaints there.

We were given our pho 5-10 minutes after our appetizer.

I can't speak for her pho as I didn't taste it but with mine, the broth was very bland.
There were a lot of noodles and not much meat, at least compared to other places with a similar price range of $8-$9 for a large bowl. I know some people don't mind eating the fat but I ended up with about 2 tablespoons of fat/tendon after I finished what were just scraps of meat.

We were never checked up on after being served our main. After we were obviously done (neither of us even finished half of the bowl) the 2 employees working the dining area were too preoccupied watching a rerun of Friends on the TV on the wall and couldn't be bothered. We were literally just 1 table over to the left from them, very hard to miss us! Needless to say we had to get up and just go to the register until one of them rang us up.

I've been to a good number of pho places up and down Spring Mountain Rd. and away from the area as well. I'd say any other pho joint down that road would be a very decent choice over this one. Definitely recommend Viet Noodle Bar as it's consistent and it's just west of Decatur.

Do yourself a favor and pho get about this place.",8CDeZ6WenRTQrGT5DvbEvw,1,0,1,bdbaOmbyx9PDKJEwGXclpw

I ordered #1 Nem Nuong Cuon (Nem Nuong Rolls) $3.95 and #11 Combination Pho $7.95. My pho came with free drink (so many to choose from!) I ordered unsweetened Jasmin tea. What a good deal.

Wow, Nem Nuong Cuon!! So delicious!! So Crunchy!! The veggies inside (lettuce, cucumber and carrot) were fresh, the pork sausage was nice, tender and salty, and they put some sort of crunchy stuff in it (See close up photo). I think it was shredded fried chips or something but the combination of all these item inside of thin rice paper tasted absolutely beautiful. The house sauce was chili sweet sauce. It was very sweet. So I just ate my rolls plain. Oh, the rice paper became very hard in less than 10 min, so eat them as soon as possible after they bring your rolls to you. 

The combination pho was OK. For some reason the noodles inside were all stuck together. It was hard to eat. They put a lot of noodles. Wow. Like twice as much as I get in other pho places. The beef was nice and lean but the portion of the meat was very small (Rare steak, brisket, meatball, tendon) compared to the other places. Well, I shouldn't complain, it was $7.95.

x #3 appetizer - this came with 2 pieces of the pork rolls (nem nuong cuon), and 2 pieces of the shrimp rolls (chao tom cuon) - I didn't eat the pork one obv, but the boo said it was just OK. To be fair, he's not a fan of that kind of sausage. The shrimp one, however, WAS EFFING AMAZING! I almost ate all of them :( SOOO GOOOD!

So if you are going for the $4.99 deal make sure you check with someone that understands what that offer is. Just a shame about this experience but the food was pretty good.

I go to Vegas a few times a year and have eaten at many restaurants restaurants.  I'm a bit of a Vietnamese food connoisseur.  I've been to Vietnam many times and work in San Jose.  If you're from the bay, I think the best Pho is at Pho VN in Union City, best Com Tam is at Com Tam Dat Thanh off Tully, best Bun Bo Hue is Bun Bo Hue An Nam off Story, etc.  I have to say this place has some of the best tasting Vietnamese noodles I've had anywhere.  

I've tried many of their dishes.  Their Pho, Hu Tieu Nam Vang, Banh Canh Tom Cua are all at the top of my list from all the places I've tried and I've tried many.  I haven't tried a lot outside of their noodles.  I've had the Com Ga Roti which was good too.  

The place doesn't seem very busy, which is odd to me because their food is so much better than Pho Kim Long and much better priced than Pho Kim Long.  I think people just recognize the name better and it's open later so Pho Kim Long is hyped up.  

Sometimes their service is a bit slow, but it's not that bad.  The only negative thing I have to say about the place is I did try their Hu Tieu Xao with beef and it wasn't very good imo.  Go for the noodles I mentioned and you'll be glad you did.",tYOUMqP7dsMNYbZ9GGZEBQ,1,2,5,6LHS74jh2NBxjtiLKZzUuQ

It was the only Vietnamese place that had nem neoung cuon and as far as I knew, the only place I've found outside of Brodard. I was hoping that the renovation would just be a re-branding and that they would keep most of their menu intact. 

They had been open about a month and in celebration of their grand opening, they were offering a great pho deal for $4.99, which applies to either a combination or rare steak pho. The special, which runs from May 21 until August 14, includes either a free drink, dessert, or macaroon. While the pho size was small for me, it's a perfect portion for girls like my girlfriend. Thankfully, they kept nem nuong on the menu to fill me up. They also have another favorite of mine, banh xeo. The iced coffee with condensed milk was excellent as always and I liked the earl grey flavored macaroon. 

Overall, it seemed like the menu was kept the same. The interior did get repainted and I believe the staff might be new with a switch in ownership. I noticed that the staff was way more attentive and the service was much improved. I'm not sure if it was just the coincidence of it being EDC weekend, but this place got packed on Sunday (about half with festival goers).

I really enjoyed the pho that I ordered because the broth was clean/fragrant. I didn't really like the udon dish...I wasn't expecting the broth to be so thick and slimy. All of the ingredients (veggies, meat, noodles, etc) tasted the same because they were covered in a thick layer of broth. Next time, I'll stick with just the pho.

The service was incredibly slow. The restaurant was at less than 50% capacity and there was still a 10 minute wait to sit. There were 3 servers and a busboy so it wasn't due to a lack of employees. The servers simply worked at a very slow pace.  

When we ordered we were told some items were not available because the head chef stepped out to do a supply run. 

When the food came, everything came in reverse order. The dessert (macaroons), main course, and then the appetizer (spring roll) came out in that order. 

I don't know what to think of this place. Management needs to step in and discipline the staff. They were working so incredibly slow, at a leisurely pace. It honestly was not that, and they had 4 employees handling the dining room.",408Ms9i2dfDn0FDZ3h0vqg,1,0,1,-BXX-VND0tO4kAFx_OVbKw

4014528,2016-10-18,23,R1IeUbdKFS0aC1QZDT1_Dw,"Hold the PHO-ne!  Waddayaknow...a place with some decent pho?  For cheap??  Can't be!

OK, we came for the highly advertised Grand Opening special at Pho D'licious - $4.99 for a small bowl of pho + a drink or your choice of macaron.  Hard to resist...feeding a family of 3 for under $20 without serving fast food?  Yeah, I'm there!  Although in retrospect, I ended up spending way more than that for dinner thanks to the rest of their menu!

So yep we got our bowls of grand opening pho - Pho Dac Biet to be sure.  Comes with rare steak, brisket, flank, meatball, and tendon, topped with onions & green onion.  Bowl is for sure on the small side, ordering a large bowl will cost you a couple extra bucks per person.  I appreciate the side of basil, raw jalapeno, limes, and bean sprouts.  But am I weird in saying that I don't like my bean sprouts already par boiled?  They came to our table like this which I guess makes it so your soup doesn't get cold when you eat it.  So I ended up asking for another side of bean sprouts raw.  Much better.  I like the crunch when you eat them with the hot pho broth.

Bowls of Pho Dac Biet were pretty good, about on par with other places I've tried before in town.  Noodles were cooked right, the tendon was simmered down well with a lot of chew.  Other meats were a bit scarce but what can you do with a small bowl of pho?  Thankfully the meats were indeed rare & thin sliced so they cooked nicely with the hot broth.  But the broth?  It was a tad on the salty side for me.  I'm pretty good with detecting MSG in my diet, my lips turn red when I consume it.  All I can say is that oh yeah, their pho broth has a decent amount of MSG in it.  Which at some point you gotta forgive, it's rare you're gonna find a place that simmers bones for stock all day long for flavor.  And if you do, you won't be paying $4.99 a bowl.  Overall though not a bad bowl of pho.  Thai tea was OK, very sweet, and beware, it will come in a SMALL cup!  Luckily I had a glass of water to tide me over too.  My kid had the macaron, I can't remember which flavor exactly but she liked it...it wasn't dry & had nice texture.

Why, do you ask was my bill over $20 for 3 people with the Grand Opening special?  Because of the damn rolls at Pho D'licious!  OMG!  That's more like their namesake!  D'licious!  I would order a few plates of rolls to go, get some San Miguel (or some other beloved Asian beer you like), sit in front of the TV & go to town!!  Total beer food!  It's true though, while we were dining there were folks in & out just for the rolls to go.  Just about every other table had rolls on their rotation so we decided to join in on the fun too because their rolls are cheap!  We tried:

*Nem Nuong Cuon ($3.95) - grilled pork sausage wrapped in rice paper with green leaf, cucumber, served with house special sauce

*Goi Cuon ($3.95) - steamed shrimp & pork wrapped in rice paper with vermicelli, green leaf, mint, and bean sprouts served with peanut sauce 

*Cha Gio ($5.95) - crispy rice paper rolls (4 eggrolls) filled with pork, shrimp, vermicelli & vegetables served with Asian greens and fish sauce

Rolls were bomb!  All of them were delicious!  Fresh too!  Very flavorful especially with their sauces!  I honestly couldn't tell you which one was my favorite because I would order each of them again on my next visit.  In fact given the great prices, I probably will!  I will come back to Pho D'licious just for the damn rolls!

So what was supposed to be an under $20 dinner for 3 ended up being near double!  But man those rolls were worth the extra small cost.  D'licious indeed!

I arrived at Pho D'licious on the penultimate night of their grand opening promotion (although the server stated that it was the last night for some reason). This deal was $4.99 for a small bowl of pho and either a drink from a limited portion of the menu or a macaron. I opted for the Pho Dac Biet rather than the Pho Tai for the meat variety, and I copied my friend's Thai tea order after not seeing anything compelling in the available macarons. The Thai tea was fairly standard, but it was odd that one cup was underfilled by about a centimeter.

The pho was pretty good actually. I wouldn't characterize the broth  as very complex, but it was enjoyable nonetheless. I could tell that lime would help to cut the richness, which a quite taste test confirmed (just squeeze a drop of lime into a spoonful of broth). The noodles were fine, and all of the meats were tender and tasty. I balked at the Thai basil at first because it appeared less than fresh (and the portion was less than generous), but the leaves that I tasted all had the proper unwilted texture and peppery flavor. All in all, I'd certainly consider ordering it again at the regular price ($7.95 for a large bowl), or perhaps trying the filet or oxtail variations.

As I alluded to earlier, the main draw is the Nem Nuong Cuon ($3.95 for 2 rolls), which others report is the same recipe from the former Nem Nuong Bistro and therefore a faithful copy of the famous rolls of Brodard in Southern California. Nem nuong is a grilled fermented pork sausage, and in this dish it's wrapped inside rice paper along with lettuce, cucumber, and crunchy fried egg roll skin. I initially balked at how they cut the rolls in two without my specific request, but aside from it being a psychological trick (4 pieces instead of two), it does expose the middle of the roll, making it easier to pick up enough of the slightly sweet orange sauce for a satisfying bite. I think I might make this request next time.

The interior was well-lit and had some nice TVs (with an Olympics soccer replay broadcast tonight) along with other touches of more modern decor, but it's still just a simple Vietnamese restaurant. I did experience a bit of a service hiccup in how slow they were to deliver the check (even after my friend requested to-go containers), but it was fine for a Vietnamese restaurant otherwise.

I'm glad that I finally got to try Pho D'licious (née Nem Nuong Bistro) and their delicious Nem Nuong Cuon. I'll most likely be back whenever a craving hits because it's not worth driving 4+ hours just for Brodard.",_VMGbmIeK71rQGwOBWt_Kg,9,6,4,oi9hfQlVg73OCDbgsVf3kw

3 orders of the nem nuong cuon with the house sauce based on other Yelpers recommendations- so glad we did!

Bun thit nuong, nem nuong, cha gio, thit nuong, what a mouth full and my oldest daughter loved it.

Hainan chicken pho, my wife told me it was amazing, especially with the special chicken sauce

It wasn't that busy during the lunch hour so I got a table immediately. I ordered the oxtail pho (I love oxtail) with a Thai tea and flan for dessert. I really liked that my pho came out piping hot and steaming.

My first impression of the broth was that it tasted watered down, or rather ""mineral-ly"" like it came straight from the tap. I realized I hadn't added in the fresh lime, sprouts, and basil yet, so I put them in and I immediately started enjoying it. I liked it more especially when I got to the oxtail pieces; they are nice bite-sized pieces so it was easy to eat. The meat was also tender, although pieces with no bone were naturally more chewy.

The Thai tea was on point. Not overly-brewed, nor overly creamy. Flan was also a nice note to end a savory broth. It also wasn't too sweet.

Service: 5/5. No problem with using 10% for $30+ order upon Yelp check-in. Yay!

Complimentary drinks: 5/5 for the token, 3/5 for quality. All I could taste was the coconut milk in the Che Ba Mau drink. If the restaurant has decided to give out free drinks/deserts, give us your best. Don't do it just to have a so-called promotion. People may not want to order it next time if your ""free samples"" are not up to par. 

Ambience: 5/5. Love the art! 

Egg rolls: 5/5. Very tasty! The sweet and sour carrot and daikon threads + mints + lettuce + fish sauce + chili sauce make up a perfect combination for the crunchy, hot, delicious rolls. 

Nem Nuong: sauce is good 4/5, rolls are 3.5/5. Rice paper was a little dry, hence chewy.

Ph special: 3/5 for broth, 5/5 for freshness of veggie. 

#41 fried rice: overall 3.5/5, just a touch of extra butter will reduce its dryness.  

Bun Bo Hue: 2/5 and I would like to make a few suggestions (it is my favorite Viet dish, I use it to test out new restaurants so I am quite passionate about it :). First, either reduce the volume of the broth or increase the amount of the noodles. As it stands now, the broth:noodle ratio is way off, this ratio is very important for noodle soup dishes. There is no need o fill up the bowl with excess broth. I left more than half a bowl of the broth in my bowl anyways. Second, the broth can be more aromatic and savory. Perhaps increase the amount of lemongrass and fish sauce or fermented fish paste when making the broth. Also consider increasing saltiness a tiny bit. The well cooked and soaked-in saltiness is more substantial than just adding extra sauce after serving. Third, the boiled beef slices were too chewy. Either change the cut of meat or cook the meat as larger chunks before slicing may help preserve the moisture and make it more tender. Fourth, consider using giò (house meatballs made from pork, chicken, beef, or shrimp paste) instead of substituting it with Viet meatloaf slices. These two items are not the same. The slices of meatloaf changes the texture of the whole dish too drastically. Also, unless requested, there is no need to add more meatloaf if a customer does not want the pig feet. Fifth, this is the one dish that should be served super hot because the beef odor will be horrible if the soup gets cold. **Please know that my comments here are meant to be constructive, not critical. 

Good luck with your business! I will come back if I have the chance. Hope I will be able to give a 5 stars next time. ^_^",2uIgWygegw57U48ABfWHqQ,2,1,4,yqWTJY7sv1RWz_O7qNrIbg

Anyways, since much money was lost in Vegas and we needed to cut on the food budget, we decided to get some pho off the strip, also to help with hangovers.

We got here, it wasn't too busy, the parking lot is actually kind of small.  Anyways, their spring rolls are okay.  The pork spring roll sauce was too thick for my liking.  Their pho soup base is a little too sweet.  It didn't really satisfy anyone's craving.  We were a little disappointed :(",AmD11AA94kDWPlU6_3mURg,0,0,2,viPk2qZJSg464MdhaKLTAA

They seem to have similar menus and they have Nem Nuong's famous spring rolls. I never really cared for Nem Nuong so when they changed their name, it was just like ""oh, okay. that's cool."" But you know what attracted me here? Their $4.99 pho special!

Their special includes a small bowl of either a combination pho or a rare steak pho. Then you get to choose between a drink, a macaroon, or a dessert. Surprisingly so, their small bowl of pho is a good amount of food. Even if you don't get their pho special, a bowl of pho is only about $7 so it's not pricey at all. 

Their soup base is pretty decent. Except, the first time I went, the soup was pretty sweet. Then the second time I went, it was nicely flavored with MSG. You will be thirsty after you dine here because of the amount of MSG in their soup base. 

I've also tried their spring rolls, which were pretty decent. Their egg rolls, however, I am not a fan. 

Overall, it's a decent place to get a meal. I would definitely come back to take advantage of their special. Great pace for lunch!",oqTZC9WriodTCby6jl0LfQ,1,2,4,6zO5vfaGtdzl4ImCVg6jvQ

Here's what we ordered:
1. Egg rolls - These came out piping hot.  They were the perfectly crisp with a generous amount of filling. They also hooked it up with lots of lettuce and greens.
2. Pho Tai - The broth was tasty without the artificial MSG taste.  The meat tasted very fresh and they also give more meat than other places.
3. Stir-fried glass noodles with shrimp and crab (#16) - I wanted to try this because I had never seen it offered at other restaurants. I'm glad I did because it was so good! I'm used to heavy stir-fried noodles like chow-mien, but the glass noodles made the dish very light.  It was the perfect balance between the crab and shrimp (they gave a pretty substantial amount of meat). I also noticed that it wasn't as greasy as other places.  
4. Pork chop and shrimp paste rice - The pork chop was quite tender and very moist. The shrimp paste has a crispy outside layer that is bomb!
5. Green Tea Macaroon - The perfect way to end our meal! The macaroon was very moist - just how I like it!

All in all, the food was great and the service was quick and attentive. I will definitely come back again!",BjJH95WUI6rhOCqvtUqrLw,0,0,5,wCwn8vfIT5sMPNonFZNEzQ
5429437,2016-06-14,1,R1IeUbdKFS0aC1QZDT1_Dw,"I've went to this place when it was nem nuong bistro and it was ok. Nothing that crazy except the nem nuong (pork spring rolls). But now it's been taken over by new management and I can really taste the improvement. The pho got a lot better and now rivals some of the better places in town. They added more items it seems but I haven't got to try them all yet. What I did try was the pho which really hit the spot. I got the filet mignon pho. I love it when restaurants offer a higher cut of meat, it just makes it that much better. I get mine on the side raw so that when I throw it in it only gets cooked slightly providing a softer rare texture. I also got it with a side of oxtail because with pho that is the best. It's so tender and just falls apart. Oh man I love it. 
What they did keep the same was the nem nuong which is the exact same as Brodard in Garden Grove. Everybody loves those but I don't always feel like going to Garden Grove to get them. I do come to Vegas often so for it to be available is very convenient for me. I like this place better than a lot of places in Vegas. I'm not going to mention any by name but there is one that always has lines that really isn't that good. I think it only has lines because it's one of the first ones that everyone just knows.

Ordered the mi nam vang/cambodian egg noodles with an iced vietnamese coffee (for free). The broth of this noodle was delicious, very different from a traditional pho broth, goes well with the egg noodles. It came with pork, heart, liver, shrimp, and quail eggs...but the portions for those were really small, and more than one quail egg would've been more reasonable...
The vietnamese coffee was good, even better that it was free. The service was nothing from the ordinary. It's a good place considering its reasonable prices, I would come back again, especially if they keep up the free desserts!",Sl8weP49PZG2VeWqU2yf-g,1,1,4,6rF-GbjwICOU7p1bU-00ag

All the free drink/ dessert are good but just be warned that they do give you a lot of ice (but hey, it's free). You can always ask for no ice and they tend to fill the cup a little bit more :) for appetizer, I have tried their nem nuong and goi cuon.
