The sandwiches here are to die for. The slaw be joe roasted beef with slaw, the capastrami pastrami with slaw and many other sandwiches are worth tasting here. 

I have tried Jason's Deli, Firehouse, subway and Mikes but this sandwich shop beats them all. 

The only reason these guys do not get a five is because the owners make different decisions. At one I can get a hot ham and cheese while at another one they say it's not on the menu so they say no.

When I asked about my order they blamed the provalone cheese. Then they started cooking it.

All this time I was clueless, wishing there was a place that offered faux-meat options (other than just a Boca patty), and all along there was such a place!  

So I finally went to Capriotti's last week and ordered the Vegetarian Turkey Sub, made with meatless ""turkey"".  I got a 12"" sub -- good for two meals -- and the flavors were very good.  

I'm really happy to have discovered another place where I can go for a quick, healthy, vegetarian meal. The other place I've been going, Chipotle, doesn't have faux-meat options like Capriotti's, but you can still order a quick, delicious, nutritious meal there without meat.  Anyway, it's great to have another option.  I'll make Capriotti's an occasional stop from now on, and I look forward to trying some of the other sandwiches, like the vegetarian cheesesteak, or the vegetarian cheeseburger.",wM1cuy_w6qsdWLeqQFWqVA,0,0,3,EXxfAOzt4Zf1Qwp5_NrZZA

-My family doesn't have turkey, stuffing, and cranberry sauce during Thanksgiving. So I guess I didn't know how to appreciate the sub.

The Bobby is absolutely amazing if you love having turkey sandwiches. Turkey, gravy, & stuffing in a delicious roll [it comes with cranberry sauce, but I'm not a big fan of any cranberry sauce on my turkey]. But while the Bobby is amazing, their Cheese steak is by far my favorite. You definitely have to get both sweet and hot peppers to make it extra delicious.

The one thing I dislike about this specific location is that they only offer two sizes, while most other Capriottis offers three different sizes. The Red Rock location, for some reason, does not offer large sandwiches.

After doing laps around the place trying to find a place with availability, we pretty much gave up and went to the food court since we just wanted to eat something by that point.

We all quickly agreed on Capriotti's and off we went! My experience here tonight was truly a ""mixed bag"".

(+) The food was really good. I mean like really, really good. I've eaten at many Cap locations and some are much better than others. This is definitely near the top of the list.
(+) Portions were surprisingly huge, which I don't quite get. It was the same price as other Cap locations that I frequent, yet our same subs here were MUCH bigger it seemed. Why is that?? lol I don't know why, but I love it! lol We actually ordered an extra sub to go after eating because we were so impressed by this!

(-) Service was painfully slow. To be fair, they were busy but everything just seemed to move at a snail's pace.
(-) Employees were very nice but seemed a bit confused. One of our subs on our initial order was just plain wrong and not even close to what was ordered, but we were so hungry we just ate it anyways. It was good, don't get me wrong, just not what was ordered.

Basically, food was a 4 and service was a 3, but we will certainly be back and we were pretty much wowed by the portion size so they get the benefit of the doubt and a 4 star rating from me.

They have a nice selection of cold and warm sandwiches plus some signature items.  The key to any good sandwich however is the bread and lets just say Capriotti's is no Subway....and that's a good thing.   You have a choice of small or large but to be honest I thought the small was pretty darn big, so if you order a large it better be for 2 people or because you just helped a friend move into his third floor apartment without an elevator.  

The first time I went in there, I grabbed a Capicola sandwich which is always one of my favorite.  They were generous with the meat and the veggies that accompanie it were fresh.   The second time decided to throw caution into the wind and I got one of their signature sandwiches, The Capistrammi.  Talk about a heart attack in wrapping!  Thats not to say it wasn't good, because it was delicious but considering it was stacked with warm, buttery pastrami, coleslaw, mayo and russian dressing, you better not be on Cholesterol meds when you try it!  Next time I go there I want to try their other famous signature sandwich, the Bobby.  It looks like a  full thanksgiving meal in sandwich form.  I should start clearing room in my stomach now and I'll probably be ready for it sometime early next month!

Prices are a tad on the higher side, but nothing outrageous.  You're getting  a higher quality sandwich than at a lot of other joints, so its totally reasonable.

He then told me why was I upset since I did not make the charges the bank was going to credit my money. I told him it was the principle and then he called me ""sweetheart"" and I told him not to call me that. Then he said what did I want him to do? I told him nothing. I wanted him to know and now that he knew and since he got nasty he could do absolutely nothing and I told him to have a nice day and I hung up. 
I do not know why people think you are always out to get something. Maybe owners need to understand that if their employees take peoples credit card numbers and charge $140.00 worth of merchandise on someone else maybe they need to call you with sincerity in their voice versus attitude and disgust. Instead of acting like it could not have happened or it was your fault for purchasing with your debit card maybe an apology would have been better.

I should probably preface this with:
I'm a COLD, leftover food kinda girl!
COLD pizza, COLD spaghetti, COLD anything really.......and the BOBBIE at Capriotti's tickles my fancy!
Thick slices of COLD roasted turkey, scoops of COLD stuffing, cranberry sauce, mayo, fresh bread........MMMmmmMMM, the freakin' goodness!

 I've always been a fan of Capriotti's, and when Mom and Pops was in town recently, rather than take them for their usual In-N-Out fix, (In-n-Out doesn't exist in Hawaii) We decided to check out Capriottis, since they have bomb sandwiches and is another business that isn't available in Hawaii.

We ordered a small Bobbie and a small Capistrami, my two favorites. We looked around to see what Pops wanted, and knowing him, he had to have his rice fix, so he ducked out and went to nearby Panda Express. Mom was surprised to see the size of the sandwiches, so I guess it was a good thing I didn't order footlongs!

Pops had a little taste and he liked both sandwiches and Mom was enjoying it as well. They both liked the fact that there was real turkey in the Bobbie and the great taste of the Capistrami as well. Now they have another food option for their next visit besides In-N-Out or a buffet!  ALOHA!!!

So I'm not from Vegas but my bf currently lives there. I have a favorite sandwich shop back at home, Little Luca's in the Bay Area (pastrami with cheese on Dutch crunch roll mmmmmm), and I have to say that this place is a new favorite. 

1) Food: I've only tried the Capastrami and Cheese Steak hot subs. Both sandwiches were MOIST, but not drenched with sauce. The pastrami meat was soft and not stringy like how it can be elsewhere. The cheese steak meat was also soft and gawd so yummy.  HOW DOES THE SANDWICH STAY WARM THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE TIME I AM EATING IT???  That's what I distinctly remember. The sandwich is ~$10... and like 20 inches long or something. I may be over-exaggerating that part but alls I remember is that it was a LARGE SANDWICH and I DEVOURED THAT THING, no problem.  And I'm a petite female if I may add that.

2) Dining & Take out: Plenty of tables to sit at and eat the sandwich.  No qualms about the to-go sandwich. Tasted just as warm and fresh as if I were eating it there, but then again I only had to drive a few blocks to get home. 

3) Parking: Went here for lunch - no problem finding parking. More trouble finding parking at night when I ordered it to go. 

Bottom line: If you're looking for a DELICIOUS, mouth-watering, WARM, MOIST sandwich, then I most-def RECOMMEND this place. Don't go to Vegas and not try it!",SAPltgfFSgI1K9aUuOWcXw,1,0,5,TYI54tjIaq3XwxLrSr91lA

Unfortunately, Capriotti's doesn't serve french fries, so they are unable to complete the Holy Trinity of Unhealthy Philadelphia Fast Food which I love so much - 1) cheesesteaks, 2) cheese fries, and then 3) Tastykakes for dessert.  But I can't knock them for what they do serve at all, so thumbs up.",XOSjRes1mDv5H2e3mWKCOw,0,0,5,drU-vJ9nmd_paAHOsgesJg

I ordered the capastrami sandwich. Which was kind of good. Not much to talk about as I said, there's really nothing special about eating at this place.",TBEiWGQoVXCq5sYuOzeBkw,0,0,3,1H4uMXLojieE1DMLm3nR7A

- Sahara&Durango, Las Vegas, Nevada
- Irvine Blvd &  jamboree, marketplace, Irvine California
- MacArthur & Dove, Irvine, California
- Tustin marketplace, Tustin, California.

After writing this review I went to Capriotti's website and they have closed all the Capriotti's retail locations in orange county. Bummer :(",qUJ9zWIb9bk60SelZrFFUw,0,0,2,Uj2K5P1HnC5rY4zgQGy3Wg

Just when I thought my SUBLIME SUB cuisine could not get any better, I had a bite of a cheese steak sub with mushrooms...shut the front door and all the windows....daaaaamn this place rocks...you will crave these subs!",fxK-_imiczdljcikBjPd8A,1,0,5,1FoA1q7wxSYDOU8QRNSkAQ

Cheesesteaks, meatball sandwiches, cole slaw on sandwiches, and a seeming bent for turkey as well.  Nice veggie options as well.  Overall, not the broadest menu selection I've seen but the food is good and it's convenient if you're at the Red Rock and don't want to deal with the big lines at the buffet or Grand Cafe.",fqCxaOI1cvnXx1OlHRUDPg,1,0,4,Acu2gV6peRcvLuhpEY0kCA
