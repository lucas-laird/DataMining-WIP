275915,2017-06-21,0,TU2Vt9nRhVSBMVTAivy9Ug,"So I have not had a decent hot dog since leaving New York. Kept hearing about this place in a mall behind The Strip. I hunted it down and it did exist. Lo and behold, old fashion Sabrett Hot Dogs with deli mustard. I couldn't help myself I ate 2 and a Kiniche on top off. Stuffed. Oh well. Reasonably priced and fresh. Nice people with old fashion manners If your from New York you'll get it. I'd go back in a New York minute. :)",_72EYQTSOipl6Jwszd3XlQ,1,1,5,vyjVxh2D7EyjneaKl4Lgmw
613814,2014-10-19,1,TU2Vt9nRhVSBMVTAivy9Ug,"Hotdog was green and tasted spoiled.  Kinish was soggy.   Why prepare the hot dog in a toaster oven?

Tried to return it and the person told me no refunds. So I was out $8.  I even told the person I was going to post a negative review on Yelp.  Didn't phase him at all.  

I wound up buying a second lunch at the Chinese gourmet express next door which was better.

The whole way this was prepared was gruesome..

Avoid.   Consider yourself warned.",6n0zHhe9S8a5USbpDG_fKA,4,1,1,QDR5SSoAZU8648NGeNp6Hw

The top layer of frito were chrisp and good as I got to frito's on the bottom of side order they were hard and stale.

1120854,2015-07-09,0,TU2Vt9nRhVSBMVTAivy9Ug,"It was good to be able to have a New York-style dog here in Vegas. I did like them when I was visiting the city. The dog here was good and had that nice crunch. However, the bun was ruined by the way they heated the dog. They put everything in the bun with the chili on top and heated it up in a toaster oven. That way all the juices seep down to the bun and it gets to soggy. I didn't like that. They should have all the other items heated separately and add everything to the bun last. The star rating is due to the actual dog inside being good and the friendly owner.",y5YNzZwQuYxgE-jSDcZLxA,0,0,3,i7HblPwUSx8nt248bs-lYQ

1552648,2015-12-28,1,TU2Vt9nRhVSBMVTAivy9Ug,"Simply put, if you want a Bronx dog like off the street carts in NYC, this is THE place to go.    The owner is super friendly and courteous and the snappy Sabrett dogs just can't be beat. They don't taste like anything you've ever had before. Give them a try.  
     I usually get them as I loved them back in the day. One with nothing but the delicious red onion sauce and the other either as Chili cheese or traditional (sauerkraut, onion sauce and mustard).
     To the lady who doesn't like deli mustard, get over it.  It doesn't say ""Midwest average hot dogs"".   We put deli mustard and red onion sauce on our dogs. Not raw onions and french's yellow.   Go to Hot dog on a stick.",Pub1A9LA1NSg7jNJjbUPJA,1,0,4,E3fk7WGMe_2jPagPEizvHA

Dog was out quick, service was friendly, but product was sub-par: small dog looked boiled and old, not at all visually appealing. 
Taste did not seem to include any mustard per the order board, but the chili was actually really good. Onions were weird, almost shredded to death instead of chopped. Bun fell apart halfway through eating.
This isn't the best food court I've come across, but there are better options here instead of this joint.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,8,4,2,quOGZDMhpivroJAdBngblw

The Aloha Dog is really good. The pineapple on top gives it a different and delicious taste... I like it.
The Taco Dog is on a freshly fried taco shell. It's a little messy to eat but the flavors are so good... truly delicious...
I was gonna take one home but ended up eating both... it's, for me, that good.
I will definitely recommend it if you're in the area.",a2aLsf3MvvX9-nuOiQRdUQ,1,1,4,WfMECYepz1MYvY8Z_SsAnQ
3258939,2015-08-12,0,TU2Vt9nRhVSBMVTAivy9Ug,Wow ! A good hot dog is so hard to find in this town . this place did it for me! the Capone hit the spot.

3520220,2015-02-20,25,TU2Vt9nRhVSBMVTAivy9Ug,"I was in the mall doing some shopping and decided to check out what was in the food court for grub. Hubby noticed this hot dog place, so we looked over the menu and it all looked so good. We ended up picking out some hot dogs and fries to share and the lady who took our order was very nice. She told me how she makes the chili herself from scratch and was proud to say she serves ""Sabrett"" hot dogs. After ordering we sat nearby in the food court and waited a short time for our food. 

The Cyclone ($3.99) - All beef Sabrett frank, chili, onions and mustard. The chili is all meat and has no beans. I do prefer beans in my chili, but like it both ways and don't  get bothered if it has beans or doesn't as long as it tastes good. I was excited to try this chili since it was made from scratch, but it just had no WOW taste to it. The chili was lacking a lot in flavor in my opinion. I didn't get the onions, they were watery and looked shredded. I would have preferred a freshly chopped onion instead of shaved or however they do it because these onions were soggy and had no crunch. The hot dog also was kind of mushy. I saw them in a small box on the counter (maybe being boiled or steamed in there) and I'm wondering how long they were there because the texture was off. Also there was supposed to be mustard on this hot dog yet I saw no mustard or tasted any. I was impressed with the size of the hot dog, but not the taste and texture. 

The Good Fella ($3.99) - All beef Sabrett frank, sauerkraut, mustard and NY onion sauce. Oh my this tasted awful! First off the menu says it has mustard on it. I tasted no mustard on the chili dog and it was supposed to be there and then they went and put deli mustard on this one. Huh? When it says just mustard on a menu that usually means yellow mustard not deli mustard. I love yellow mustard and don't so much love deli mustard, so I already knew I would't care for this hot dog. There was a lot of the NY onion sauce on it though and I was so ready have some of that! I took one bite and just wasn't impressed. The hot dog was soft and mushy like the other one and the onion sauce tasted terrible. I thought the deli mustard was going to ruin the hot dog and it was all the onion sauce. Hubby didn't like the onion sauce either and we had it on another hot dog so he just scraped it off. 

Mobster Fries ($3.99) Fries, chili, cheese and onions. I thought the fries were okay, but it's the same thing with the chili lacking flavor and the watery shredded type onions. 

Hubby picked a sausage with mustard and onion sauce (came with deli mustard instead of yellow mustard) and a hot dog with marinara and cheese. I didn't even try the one with onion sauce since I knew I didn't like it on the previous hot dog. I did try the one with marinara and though the cheese could have been melted better it actually didn't taste too bad. I feel bad that we didn't enjoy it more because the lady working was so nice, but nothing was memorable enough to come back.",Fv0e9RIV9jw5TX3ctA1WbA,33,30,2,dqXi2CfKeKYwLGKzRbLiiA

The sausage was also very good.

The lady who was at the counter was very friendly and explained different things on the menu. How they serve Sabrett hotdogs only. The chili was made in house.

I decided on the cyclone and the Capone, my friend got the Godfather. Everything tastes good. The chili was a little thin on texture, but it added to the flavorto the dog. (That being said, I have had some great chili and this pales in comparison.)

It was a positive experience overall.",vrfu5g0dEJA1ogMP9wicyQ,0,0,4,4mkt5nBzCAn303Aeh8tbGw
3913150,2015-01-30,0,TU2Vt9nRhVSBMVTAivy9Ug,"I love eating here. I usually order the ""Hitman"" which is the chili cheese frito pie. Her chili is amazing and she makes it herself. I get it topped with onion, jalapenos, mustard and I always have her add a chopped up Saberet hot dog on top (for an additional charge). The serving size is great for the price. I paid about $6.50 including tax, but I've paid a lot more for a lot less many times. Besides, the quality is well worth it. The order is about $4.25 without the hot dog. She usually has some sort of special going, as well. Today it was a Cyclone Hot Dog, Fries and a Drink for $6.50 before tax. Not bad, I just prefer to just go ahead and pay for whatever it is I am in the mood to eat, despite the deals.

The owner is always very nice and friendly and she takes care to make sure she gets the order exactly as you want it. Definitely one of my favorite lunch spots and one of the best stands in the food court.",UOcPVORL9FLnRE2lnVoUsw,0,0,5,7OBb7IOxrOCJs-JxEdyJRg

Very disappointing. The hotdog was average. The mustard was not classic yellow mustard, but that wasn't a big deal. The sauerkraut was limited. Yet the biggest problem was at the bun was cold! Absolutely terrible and would never come here again. This is great if you like hotdogs and you do not know any better, but if you are familiar with Coney Island or what a great hot dog should taste like, this is not the place to go.
