My girlfriend and I were just looking for something cheap and easy while out on errands. We saw Lee's and knew it just opened and thought 'why not'? We weren't expecting much but something half way decent at a reasonable price. We didn't get either.
Everything we had was luke warm and pretty tasteless. Most of what I had was cooked to death. We kept looking for something that was decent and never found it. We didn't even dare try the desserts.
To top it off our server asked us if we liked the food and when I told him it was horrible he agreed. But that didn't stop him from dropping the $30 check. What a ripoff.
I know there's another Chinese buffet only a block or so away that is cheaper and way better.
My prediction is this place won't last too long. Thank goodness!",qO63bm_qSJMIU6FS0Ow7KA,0,0,1,SFsI-nz9ADMI6lZlpOlQWQ
365788,2012-11-26,3,znDUBjt-m2qmXi_p3m3rDA,"Sunday dinner buffet..$12.99 per person.  As you enter, the hostess is very busy on her cell phone texting.  It was almost like we disturbed her coming in. 
 It was a very nice looking, clean buffet...but.....  Nowhere near the 150 items they say they have.

The food looked good, but it was not labeled , so you didn't know what you were having...And it didn't matter because it all tasted the same. 

 We were there at 5 PM and maybe 15-18 others were there.

The spare ribs and the crab legs and the short ribs were empty when we came in and remained empty until we were almost ready to leave.  The seafood soup had no seafood in it and it was not hot, it was room temperature.  Same with the shark fin soup, no fin in it.  The fruit at the small dessert bar didn't look too fresh either. Most of the trays were 1/2 full at best and not refilled.

Actually, the only items I liked were the mussels and the clams.

In the hour we were there we were not asked if we needed our drinks refilled, but they did clean the table off in a timely manner.

From our table, I watched the employees eating in the kitchen as well.

Sorry Lees..but we will not be coming back.  There are way too many buffets in Vegas to waste money here.",tmY457L5K1P_ZjMf9fpHtA,5,0,1,U-FmxcKVxQZ1_N01R3NGVQ

Last night I saw yet ANOTHER reason to walk out. The live action mongolian BBQ cooking station. You choose your own raw meats & vegetables & hand it to the cook to cook it in front of you. I filled my plate with wet raw chicken , he cooked it & the put the meal BACK ON THE PLATE where the raw chicken had just been! Didn't even wipe the plate (not that that wouldve helped) You can make people VERY sick doing that! Thank goodness I had my eyes open & realized it in time to walk out before getting salmonella. Guys that is food safety 101. Other dishes were out at room temp for a long time & they had a HUGE knife sitting on the buffet to cut your own beef. A kid could easily grab that & hurt himself.

But let me tell you, the food was incredibly mediocre and hit the spot for a measly $9 (except for Sundays when the price was jacked up to $13 to match the prices of the surrounding buffets) so when I stopped by today to see a little pink slip from the health department claiming the restaurant had been closed...I cried a little.

I've had better.  The service could've been better.  I saw our host once and another hostess once.  They cleaned our plates off once.

Maybe it was the time of day that I came in, or just really good luck, but it wasn't that bad. I grew tired of waiting for Yama Sushi nearby and I was starving, so I decided to get something fast and cheap. After reading the other reviews, I followed some tips that helped me avoid any potential food poisoning and resulted in an enjoyable experience. 

1) Food is a C+. For better Chinese food, look elsewhere, like Chinatown
2) Stick with the hot foods. I was afraid of the sushi and avoided it like the plague
3) Mongolian style stir fry was pretty good. The shrimp was fresh, along with the veggies. Unfortunately, the lady who cooked it looked unhappy, like she was there as an indentured servant and had nowhere else to go. 
4) The fresh fruits were decent and plentiful. I avoided the other desserts.
5) The orange chicken and vermicelli noodles were pretty decent and better than Panda Express. 
6) If you happen to come when all the Chinese tour buses come in, the food will be refilled constantly and it was very fresh for me. Nothing at room temperature and tasted fine 

This place reminds me of all the other C+ rated chinese buffets in LA. Nothing special about it. You get what you pay for. And luckily I didn't pay for a stomachache.",gwMG6Cv7K_Dq-7lJW5l1bQ,3,1,3,Je8aTq09Jv8JPYO1f5gPyg

The sushi (Cali Rolls & variations) was fresh and the buffet offered both peel & eat shrimp (hot) & already peeled shrimp on ice, which is excellent for me because I like to ""top off"" my rolls with a piece of shrimp.

 As far as the General Chicken, spicy chicken etc. goes, it was perfect with the right amount of sauce & spice.

4014459,2013-04-10,4,znDUBjt-m2qmXi_p3m3rDA,"Late review (so sorry), but I'm sure not much has changed for the better since I visited Lee's Buffet late last year when I attended the Vegas Valley Comic Book Festival at the Clark County Library.  Looking at previous reviews I think I might be right.

New sign, shiny outside, colored flags, and a huge 'Grand Opening' banner?  I'm such a sucker!  I remember this place when it used to be the 'New China Buffet' back in the day when I was living at The Retreat apartments as a broke ex-college student working two jobs.  Everyday I'm hustlin'...hustlin'...

Back then?  New China Buffet was still the $h!t.  Literally.  I heard stories of other people in my apartment complex who would eat there and be puking their guts out less than 48 hours later.  Even my old roommate who ate there once up and left mid-meal because a cockroach (yes!) crawled up on his table to watch him eat.  Brings back the heebee-jeebees.  Who knows how they managed to stay open so long!

Fast forward to now.  Not much has changed!  New interior, same ol' shady buffet!  Stick a new coat of paint on poop, and guess what?  It's still poop.  The new Lee's Buffet still stinks to high Heaven.

I admit I was super hungry so I ended up eating there with not much care.  But noticing the overall state of the establishment should have raised a red flag with me.  A Saturday, only 10-12 tables out of at least 25 occupied?  Flag.  Bored Chinese boy sitting at a table, folding forks into napkins and picking his ear?  Flag.  Hostess at the front door surprised to see us during what should have been a weekend lunch rush?  FLAG!  FLAG!  FLAG!

All I could think was I was WTH let's give it a shot.  At almost $9 each for lunch I should have gone somewhere else.  This shiny new buffet had mostly tarnished food.

Lee's Buffet has all the typical offerings of your local Chinese buffet, it's all there.  Beef & Broccoli, Sweet & Sour Pork, Fried Rice, Tilapia, 'Pizza', Orange Chicken, and some other Americanized versions of what 'Chinese' food is.  All horribly mediocre.  I seriously would have welcomed a 3-Item combo from Panda Express instead.  My standard Buffet @ Asia does all this stuff much better (believe me that's saying a lot) and at a cheaper price!

Salad bar?  MEH.  Soup bar?  Even though they come in those cute little round pots?  MEH.  Dessert bar?  Dry and MEH.  Don't even get me started on the hand-rolled sushi offerings.  You guessed it!  MEHHHHH.  And I don't even know how safe that raw fish is to eat!  Tip folks, sashimi - just because it's offered...doesn't mean you should eat it.  Save yourself a trip to the ER and stay away from fish that smells downright fishy.  Knowing is half the battle!  And according to the new GI JOE - Retaliation movie that just came out, Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson is the other half of said battle.  Seriously, that guy can kick some serious booty!

But back to the lecture at hand, Lee's Buffet has set the bar pretty darn low for Chinese buffets in Las Vegas.  I know since I've been to a bunch of em'.  Built up my Yelp Street Cred with those reviews!  Yeah I'm cheap...but I also like good.  It can be had, but not at a place like this.  I really should have walked a little farther from the library that day and gone to Jason's Deli or Seafood City for some quick eats.  Seems my discovery flag that day did not lead me to great adventures.

The only thing that kinda set Lee's Buffet apart from the other ones is that there's all you can drink boba.  But OMG!  MEH.  While they offered 3-4 different flavors, each of the ones I tried were over sweet and had boba balls that were way too soggy.  Lord knows I hate soggy (boba) balls.  Those drinks were obviously sitting in the fridge for a long, long time.  Disappointing to say the least.

Can't say I will be back at Lee's Buffet again to give them another shot.  It is probably not worth my time.  If you visit, don't say I didn't warn you!  There are many more well-established places to get your Chinese fix.",QCtHk02W_Asu2LFfdmGQDA,3,1,2,0WnQ4AUZCM-3tH_Cq45ESw

Though not really Asian, the tiramisu, flaky pastries, cake, jello and pudding provides a nice variety to end a meal with.  I love the fried dough with the sugar.  A favorite of mine at any Chinese buffet.  As for the rest of the food, some of it was good.  Other options were just so-so.  Then there were the selections I would not touch.  Namely the many sea food options and for a couple of reasons.  One, I don't care much for sea food.  The many bi-valves and mollusks don't appeal to me.  And two, I cannot eat the crustacean types anymore though I do love a good crab leg and fried shrimp.  This made the meal possibilities for me a bit more difficult to find.  There was pleanty though.  For the less adventureous sorts and/or children, they have fresh fruit, pizza and fries.  I had none of that.  Instead, I had beef and brocoli which was good.  The beef was very tender.  The pork and mushrooms was good as well.  Loaded with mushrooms which I like just fine.  The orange chicken was soggy and sweet.  I like mine crispy with a good tang and spice.  The sweet and sour chicken was better.  The light tempura batter let the chicken be the shining star.  So many times I've had sweet and sour with more batter than chicken.  The dim sum loaded with well seasoned pork was probably the best thing I ate at Lee's. The wonton soup was right up there too.  Then I was let down with soggy chow mein.  It would have been good had it been more fresh.  I had two pieces of California Roll.  I don't trust the stuff with real raw fish at a buffet regardless of where it is.  But a California Roll is basically safe.  It was rolled the propper way with the rice on the out side.  But it was not tightly rolled and fell apart a bit upon picking it up the the house tongs.  And it lacked any real flavor.  I saw there was a Mongolian grill section but it is easy to miss and I did until after I was too full to try it.  I would have liked to.  I think most people missed it too.  I did not see one person take advantage of it.  I'd say I'll try it next time but I don't think there will be a next time for me at Lee's.  For $12.99 it is not that good.

Planned the whole day with kids around having this place for lunch.  When everybody was super hungry, we arrived at Lee's Buffet.  Something appeared amiss as there were no cars in the parking lot.  THEN..... Dadd'y what's that sign in the window?  Nothing kids, just a SNHD (southern nevada health district) letter posted in the window.  YUP.  More than 40, yes forty, demerits and forcibly shut down by the health dept.. Wonderful.  Messed up the entire day's well though out plans.  I called Amazon and as usual, they took care of us and apologized for something they could not control.  Amazon local is still as safe as anything and they just get screwed by businesses who sell on their site.  Groupon goes through the same thing i'm sure.  My oldest son however, made me go from angry to blah in two seconds when he said ""at least we found out before we ate there"".  SO VERY TRUE.  Scratch this one off the list guys.  40+ demerits is way too many to even consider.  Oh and quick good job the health district for at least trying to keep us safe.  Thank you SNHD, and Amazon.  Go screw yourself Lee's buffet.  Just stay closed this time.  Oh and I say this time as it appears they have been shut down repeatedly for multiple violations (the waitress at the restaurant across the street where we ended up eating says she has seen lees buffet closed at least two times since she worked across the street.",BVL5AKnezUhMyizUmeE7sQ,0,0,1,PE04yZT2eAOdHri2jaV0ZA

The service was very poor and the Hostess could not be bothered to get off of her cell phone and was there the entire time we were in there. 

To make maters worse when she was seating us she was busy talking to somebody else instead of being interested in us. The food on the buffet lines were not marked and I am glad that I am not allergic to seafood because I got what I thought were potatoes turned out to be Sponge Balls. 

I would not recommend this place if I was given a years worth of free buffets.",UFrBm1MLPryHwxS2iufhzw,3,0,1,V1obcTizNzS4-fBby5gBSQ

To start, there was no host when we walked in so we had to wait for someone to finally come to the front. I was trying to find a sign indicating the price of the buffet but no luck. Then, after we got seated, we went to the buffet and there were no plates anywhere. The staff finally noticed and brought some out a couple minutes later. 
Some of the food was decent but most of it was not hot and when we got to dessert, my boyfriend ended up with a rotten strawberry.

Only plus was its cleaner than the average I guess. Price is also crazy for such crappy food...$12.99 and also like $7 for kids over age 4....geez! Never again!

The food was good trust me it was. BUT i can tell this place is seriously dirty. The bathroom smell is disgusting. The floors were sticky. Also I noticed the one room is for Mexicans and hispanics another is for the White's and the other would be for asian people. Some do eventually mix though because of crowding. 

But this place was recently shut down again. Like I said it was dirty. I heard they didn't have a place to wash the plates and dishes but they had a bucket next to their. The sink didn't work that's what I mean. Anyways the location was good but they needed to be cleaner.",Jne7UiKCp_VsSsvh-utyQw,0,0,2,1n6k6IOtX164lM0j-HAW6w

You just can't go down to the strip all the time and having a quiet place to go that's off the strip isn't all bad.  It used to be called ""New China Buffet"" but it looks like they remodeled the outside and brightened up the inside since my last visit.

Anyway, contrary to the previous review, Wifey and I thought that for a Chinese buffet it was just fine.  We each found things we liked and had a pretty decent dinner tonight.  Not fine dining but just fine nevertheless.  Staff was very accomondating.  Even the habachi cook couldn't wait to grill me up a little habachi style veges and meat....and it was pretty good too as far as this style goes at a Chinese buffet restaurant.

Dinner cost $12.99 (includes a drink) plus tax.  The fried banana dessert had just the right amount of sweetness for me and made a great end to the meal.  I give it 3-stars because tonight was pretty good compared to other similar buffets around the country.  So, if you're in this area, and like Chinese buffets, I think you'll be fine here for a night.  You can go empty your wallet on the strip another night.",boSlWfXL49EwkHZz_L9AFg,5,1,3,O5p9TEwypkEd1iFO-WOLPw

When I first went to this place I thought ohhh, well this definetely is a step us from the exterior of Buffet at Asia, on which I had dined the day before.
I went inside and it was clean as well.  It is a little on the more expensive side.  I think it was about fifteen,  Thats not expensive, but it is above average for the rest of the cheap asian buffets in Vegas.
The staff was friendly even though my waitress who seemed to speak wonderful mandarin, was still struggling with english.  What she lost in english words she made up in smiles,
This place also has a stir fry bar, but the selection of items seems to be minimal.  I read another reviewers take on the ribs,  And they are indeed the best that any of the other buffets have to offer.  They also had a tray raw oysters,  I had one and was not impressed.,",1Qca4FtV1tUp-WZz9APgzA,0,0,3,GeUYbXGRp0tPgM4L07deKQ

Why you gotta make me a sad panda
I came here one day after class because I saw it had been remodeled so I decided to give it a go and was immediately saddened by that decision. 
The food was mediocre. Like it wasnt bad and cold the way some people said. It also didn't stand out in any major way though. It was also lunch time, so I'd like to go at a dinner time to try it out and see if I'd like it more. 
What really gives this such a bad review is the service. I went at 1 pm on a Wednesday!! The restaurant was not very busy, yet my waitress was nowhere to be found. I literally saw her once in the entire time I was there. She took my drink order once and then proceeded to make a Casper. I kept having to go to the host in the front to talk to the host who was helpful but seemed to want to do anything but talk to me and I didn't like that vibe. I hate to give bad reviews but this place certainly earned it. There are lots of Asian buffets in town and unless things change, I see no reason to ever go back",KyMkKb5IohKb0S7v4Jv-oA,4,1,2,QtqhksbngElFWNJ4hcWERQ
