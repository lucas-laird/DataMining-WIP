I love great Chinese food & this place definitely does not fail in that department. I've been coming here for close to 2 years and they deliver each & every time.  The quality & taste are there. I've never had a dish I didn't like. Everything comes out great, not looking like soup or tasting like cardboard. I've even ordered off menu dishes a few times.  I have zero complaints about Chopstix overall, their food, or service. 

The starters are good sized. 10 fried pork wontons for $4.25. That itself is a meal. The entrees are a combo of family style plus rice. They also offer combo plates. 

It is family owned so its not uncommon to see elementary age children sitting at a table doing homework. The kids are well behaved & don't pose a problem. I only mention it because its not something one usually sees. If the restaurant is busy with eat in customers the children are moved to the back to free up space. 

The have fountain Pepsi drinks & canned Pepsi products. There's a tv, usually tuned to a sports channel. They do deliver for a small fee. You can order online or by phone. To be honest online is easier. If you need to say NO ONIONS, you just uncheck a box. No way to mess that up!!  The people who work there...their first language is NOT english & sometimes things are lost in translation. They are a no nonsense bunch & can come across as short & abrupt, but I find them to be quite nice & friendly. 

This is the only place I will order take out from. It tastes the same as if you ate there. They use the paper boxes & Tupperware type boxes so food is packed nicely. 

I love coming here & do so as often as possible. Try it...you may just fall in love with Chopstix, as I have.",9BuTUHt6Zlm-UCjaGD6aJQ,0,0,5,bxGUJRVKd4dOgS2Sv447JQ

They have good lunch specials and some cool coupons in the back of the take out menu when you ask for one. Lunch specials end at 4pm. My girlfriend got the sesame chicken and I got the honey garlic shrimp. It was tasty and no complaints is all I can say about the food.

We ordered pan fried potstickers...they were more like deep fried...very greasy and not good.  We also ordered General Tso chicken extra spicy.   This barely tasted hot and it was listed on the ticket as extra spicy.  Did they run out of peppers?  The most disturbing dish was the chicken Lo Mein.  The chicken was just as low grade you could find.  The noodles were limp and sooooo greasy.  Ended up throwing that away.
Next time will pay a few dollars more and go to PF Changs.",XPb7lxo8i7WbpHmltibHFA,0,0,1,WX3Rb3_oyM4E0136Z0Zx2A

My family loves their egg rolls , BBQ park ribs with bone in, and I love their beef teriyaki sticks for appetizers. As far as entrees, I always get the Honey walnut shrimp . It is so delicious and they give you a big order. The shrimps are the large prawns with a perfect amount of sweet mayo and honey. My daughter loves their sweet & sour pork and Mongolian beef! They are pretty fast to deliver your food , we rarely have to wait unless it's super busy and even then it's probably just an additional 5 minutes if they are busy. What I also like is they have your address saved to your phone number, which makes ordering easy and fast. They are also good at calling if they have any issues or are running behind. Last but not least . I love that when you order a $40 amount of food. They give you coupons for 1 free entrees!

4655025,2016-03-28,7,S9CrHJJnns3cqdGca7mQWQ,"3.5 STARS- All around good Chinese restaurant 

    I enjoy trying different places, and as part of my Chinese restaurant tour Chopstix was a stop. It was Christmas Eve a special day when several restaurants were closed. Chopstix was open. I'd pull into the Walmart Neighborhood Market-anchored shopping center at the northeast corner of Bermuda and Silverado Ranch Roads. After the Christmas Eve lunch, I'd enjoy the experience to the degree of returning in the beginning of the new year. 

   In reality I have been familiar with Chopstix. This location is actually Chopstix 2. In the past, I have dined at their Eastern at Windmill location a couple of times. A few years ago, I gave it a good rating ( https://www.yelp.com/biz/chopstix-las-vegas ). What both locations share in common is a take-out style environment, good food, decent service, and good lunch specials. 

   On my two visits here, I spent less than $10 on a lunch special with a fountain beverage. With the exception of an employee bringing the paper plate of food to one of the few tables, this is mainly a self-serve restaurant. 

   Following the headline of the review: 3.5 Stars: All around Good Chinese food; the food isn't bad nor outstanding. It is good Chinese food that I enjoyed the Christmas Day visit when I ordered the shrimp lo mein lunch special then early in January 2016 when I ordered the pepper steak lunch special. Both times, the lunch special included the soup of the that is the expected egg drop soup. The lunch specials featured the entree on the right half of the plate with the fried rice on the left and an egg roll at the 12 o' clock position. I appreciate that the entree takes up at least half the plate in contrast to a few places where filler soft chow mein noodles and fried rice takes up more than half. Additionally, I appreciate that the Chopstix lunch menu includes shrimp lo mein. The facts that more than half the plate is an entree and they offer shrimp lo mein for lunch merrits a 1/2 rating increase. 

   After stopping by Chopstix 2 two times on my Chinese Restaurant tour, I spread the word that it is a good Chinese restaurant. I wouldn't travel out of my way to eat here, however, if I was nearby there is a possibility that I would return.",0tvCcnfJnSs55iB6mqPk3w,11,10,3,zf4pMvy63Sj44Fu63wh4Kg

We always order the orange chicken, it's probably the best main entree. It comes in a pretty good size container. Definitely enough for 2 people to share. It's not too tangy or anything. 

Another thing I order is the cream cheese crab ragoons. I was never a fan of ragoons till I tried theirs!

Also we usually get the chicken fried rice as well. That sometimes comes with excessive amounts of sprouts sometimes, but I usually pick them out if there's too many. And the house lo mein is amazing. Be sure to mix the noodles around and get the sauce off the bottom cause if you eat the bottom in the end it'll be salty surprise. But once you mix it then it's not bad.",Q4fqLPsh2l_7yrRylvw-eg,0,0,5,nkKGwlWX6VelJHaRT8fAHw

Their menu is simple while also giving you many options allowing you to make a combo with two entrees that you enjoy. I tried their Mongolian beef combo with Lo Mein the first time I went their. It's was delicious! It does have a little spicy kick to it but it was very good. For under $10, you get a meal that is very filling. If you like Chinese food, you definitely have to try Chopstix.",vutgETOQyIYsKpj0oKNrkw,0,0,4,DIhbd-wUaEJ6vdWoQB3WPw

Food was so-so and prices were cheap. Its obvious they put approx $0.00 into interior decor. Not bad if you want quick chinese take away. Be prepared to hit a restroom exactly 3.2 seconds after eating. Cheers!,B7ygjO6fbs5IhW2ykL_MQQ,0,0,4,MW0xVmSxuc-4SDjHKmqe6A

Not much to look at on the outside, but it's what's on the inside that counts!  This place has your typical Chinese restaurant prices, but they definitely make it worth it!  Chopstix doesn't cheat you out of quality or quantity like many other places charging the same prices... They don't add an unnecessary amount of celery and/or peanuts, and their seafood and meat is of quality worth trying for yourself.

All in all...

Great quality, great quantity, friendly staff, fast service.  They will make you wonder why you've gone anywhere else!",59yalGU6Srsgv3-AYL--OQ,1,1,5,S2OfVWub6S6CcCElKPOAXQ
5492204,2013-10-10,5,S9CrHJJnns3cqdGca7mQWQ,"I am really disappointed with this place. Right when we walked in we noticed two flies buzzing around and that should have been a sign for us to leave. But we decided to just order the chicken wings and that was it. The man who took our order was friendly but he had body odor. That was another reason why we should have left. People working in the food industry should not have BO! Our order didn't take long and when we got in the car, my boyfriend made a comment about the bag food smelling like fish, and he was right. I, too, could smell fish. We got it home and we each took a wing, ate it and it tasted like fish. I think they used the same oil they cooked fish in to fry the chicken wings. I don't think I'll be returning.",dOFyIGbyfB69VB4pnoKqQA,7,4,1,YkaHe5yRPa0Fh3mEEapzZQ

The potstickers have good flavor and they give you more than normal. Fried Rice is subpar.  I recommend this place if your craving Chinese food and don't feel like leaving the neighborhood.,ZeID7DSNMjhWqeLt0nexxQ,0,0,4,D-W3-AvFRNbBKHhSAZMHIQ
