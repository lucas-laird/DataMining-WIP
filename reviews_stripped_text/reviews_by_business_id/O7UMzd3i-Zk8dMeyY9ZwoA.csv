So sad to find out this place was closing then sought out to pay a visit their last night in business. Where do I begin?

Well, first off...when it comes to gelato, this small, family owned/partnership joint got it right. They got it above and beyond right. 
I have never tasted a more perfect gelato. The texture, the density, the creaminess and those flavors! They had the best in this city. And their bouts of creativity were phenomenal. It was like a science lab in there! Flavors ranged from spaghetti and meatballs to sushi, from pink salmon to lavender! Their concoctions were mind-blowing and I'm glad I got a chance to visit before they closed. 
These people were so friendly and so passionate about their customers and the owner, Desyree, was such a lovely woman. I really hope she comes back even more fantastic than before. In the meantime, this paradise will surely be missed.",8nAchwrSfEKafmFnAehCGg,1,1,5,UAB-LYDd8P7zA_VaGToCRQ
109889,2014-08-24,2,O7UMzd3i-Zk8dMeyY9ZwoA,"Yeahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh you really can't go wrong with this place. 

I've had flavors here that blew my mind. The following is just scratching the surface in terms of flavors they offer; Foie Gras and Rosemary, Gorgonzola and Pear, Barbecue Ribs and Mac and Cheese. The list could go on forever, and for those of you who are hesitant to try savory flavors in a medium that normally transports sweet flavors GIVE THE ODD FLAVORS A CHANCE! I would have never imagined liking a cheese flavored gelato but here I am today, a believer. 

Aside from a great selection of gelato flavors that you can mix and match, they also have.... GELATO PANINIS. You read that correctly, they have a custom panini press so they can put GELATO IN YOUR PANINI!!!! 

If you are visiting and you don't come here, you are truly missing out on what could be a highlight of your trip. If you are a local and have not been here... I have no words for you.",K4fJqiGevlAZv3k_qsPeyg,3,3,5,CXBMBy9eik-R-8KX0kxahw

My friend Ame was nice enough to introduce me to AoF & now we have an obsession! During my first visit I think I sampled every flavor that was in the case!! After we chose our gelatos, we were thinking of reasons to drive back that week just to get gelato. Haha.. yes, it really is THAT amazing!! 

There are SO many things I just love about this place. I have only been there twice, but each time there is always something different to try! The gelato and sorbets also taste like what they are named. I'm sorry but I think that is just AMAZING!! :D 

The flavors I have gotten (so far): Lemon Pound Cake (lemony goodness!), Blueberry Pancakes (it's like breakfast in gelato form; not a fan of the blueberries though), Gianduja (chocolate & hazelnut), & Cinnamon Toast Crunch (tastes like the name! SO GOOD!)!!

When we entered, the owner was quick to welcome us- she was extremely friendly and told us all about how she makes her gelatos. She then proceeded to give us sample after sample... they all were pretty delicious. I remember trying a sweet cream flavor, pistachio, sweet corn, and a few others.

I opted for a $5 cup, half peppermint (with candy pieces) and half bread pudding (which had crushed espresso beans). The peppermint was as good as the very best peppermint ice cream I've had, and the bread pudding had these delicious toffee notes to it. The husband got a cup of half eggnog (which was rich with vanilla flavor) and half strawberries and cream, which was super delicious.

We are now going to make a point of stopping by Art of Flavors during every Vegas trip. I love that the flavors are always changing! I don't see myself ever going back to ice cream, as long as this place exists!",OPcwROEiroS6XjWXozHchQ,1,1,5,MG1GksM6-aWj0XC7Znh9lg

12n - 10p Weekdays
12n - 11p Weekends
I did get the impression that they would stay open as long as there are customers, and there should be a constant line of customers.

Like others have said, the customer service is beyond excellent. They go above and beyond what is expected to make sure you understand what you are getting and what they have to offer. I think 25% of the cost of the gelato goes toward sampling spoons! 

The flavors are all extremely good and inventive. The dark chocolate is like brownie batter. The white coffee bean is the best version of a cold cup of coffee I've ever had. Hazelnut goes great with those two. The sweet corn is so subtle yet very flavorful and savory. 

What is really fun is seeing 3 families huddled over the display cooler, and sampling away and discussing the flavors. 

Do not pass this up! Awesome flavors, great owners, phenomenal experience. Thank you Chef D for bringing this to Vegas!",CTJZYy61aX6a4hA7xv7pQw,2,1,5,pl8GTkDajPeGNaHjUpyiZw

531181,2013-10-21,1,O7UMzd3i-Zk8dMeyY9ZwoA,"When I went to Italy with my brother, it was his first trip but already my third.  While my brother is a passionate art lover, I am an abject ignoramus.  So how did I bide my time while bro was spending the whole day in various museums I had already been to?  Yuppers, you guessed it:  gelato!!  To be fair, I enjoyed lots of terrific coffee and pasta also.  But after almost a week in Rome, sampling countless flavors from dozens of gelaterias, I am kinda sorta a gelato expert.  So trust me when I say this:  the gelato at Art of Flavors is as good as any you'll find in the Eternal City.  If you can't quite swing the airfare to Roma, just visit Art of Flavors (unless you're an art lover, then you'll have to pony up for the ticket).

First, the location.  Yes, it's in a divey area: strip club across the street, dive bar a half-block away ... Las Vegas Boulevard north of the Stratosphere ain't the Via Condotti.  But if you're worried for your safety, no need.  As, uh, ""un-posh"" as the area might look, it's perfectly safe.  Cops cruise up and down Las Vegas Boulevard constantly. Crime is not an issue here.  As for parking, it is limited in front of AoF, but there are more spaces at the far end of the little strip mall that AoF occupies.

On to the important stuff:  the gelato!  Wow, I can't say enough about the quality.  A lot of places advertise that they serve gelato when really it's just fancy-pants ice cream.  Gelato has less sugar, butterfat & air than premium ice creams and is served at a higher temperature (right around 32 degrees, instead of 10-20 degrees for ice cream), which means that the flavors come through more.  And Chef Desyree makes all her flavors herself.  The Italian donut?  Yup, she makes the donuts from scratch, mashes them down, then makes a gelato out of the mash.  Same with the cinnamon rolls that go into the cinnamon roll gelato.  And the lemon curd that goes into the lemon meringue gelato.  Of course, all the fruit sorbettos are made with fresh fruit.  The only ingredient I think she doesn't make from scratch is the Oreo cookie crumbles in the cookies & cream gelato.  All that work must be difficult and time-consuming, but Desyree won't settle for less.  She is absolutely passionate about the quality of her gelato.  And as other Yelpers have mentioned, the staff wants you to sample the interesting, often very different flavors they offer, like sweet corn, avocado, and pepper chocolate.  If you're curious about a flavor, don't be shy about asking for a sample!

Whether gelato, ice cream, or frozen custard, Art of Flavors is the best frozen dairy in Las Vegas by a country mile.  A lot of my recommendations for eating spots in Las Vegas are location-dependent.  For example, I like Burger Bar @ Mandalay Place for an inexpensive (relative speaking, for the Strip) dining option.  Would I suggest you go there if you were staying at the Tropicana?  Absolutely!  Staying at the Wynn?  Nah, don't bother.  But regardless of where you are in Las Vegas, if you love ice cream (or in this case, its Italian interpretation known as gelato), you MUST GO to Art of Flavors!  Heck, gelato this good, I'd drive from St. George.",hJ6jVSwzPLUH_SVou4is7w,1,1,5,qwJYsx4aDqpZzpYi4dzlMQ

Located at the northern edge of the strip, this fanciful creamery is run by one of the sweetest ladies in Vegas who doesn't want to screw me to take my money (I am including dealers and prostitutes alike here). As I walked in the door, the owner happily greets me and gives me a little rundown of their italian gelatos, as well as some of the new flavors that she experiments weekly. So she lets me try a few, and even encourages me to try more without judgment- this is a huge plus as most owners glare at you if asked to try more than one flavor. As if two or three tablespoons of ice cream will cause their business to go under.

Anyways, the taste of the trial flavors are mundane. The gelato isn't super creamy, and the experimental flavors fall short of appetizing (they were vanilla garlic and bbq wing flavored gelatos... In other words, vanilla nasty and bbq y would u put this in dairy form). In the end I went with a simple bread pudding flavor, and while it was decent, it felt a little lacking in oomph that I've come to expect from gelatos.

There's a chance that this was my fault and I simply went with a mediocre flavor. But all in all the most redeeming factors were the kindness or the owner and the moderately reasonable prices considering I was in Las Vegas.

I have to give this place another try or two. But as of now we are not fans. My husband actually went as to far as saying it was ""the worst chocolate item he has ever taste in his life"".

Soooooo...one night a few weeks ago we went. I ordered the chocolate vegan and the blueberry vegan. I thought they sound great.

Less than a minute later, after our two bites, the chocolate turned into a pudding like texture. Like some kind of tapioca goo. Husband had quit eating it after one bite but I had to ask him if I was seeing things. Nope! it had turned to chocolate pudding.

The blueberry was ok but he said he taste a freezer burnt type taste and then after he said that...it was ruined for me. 

I tossed the whole $8?with tip thing in the trash. 

I felt bad for wasting it, ordering such a big order, and I feel even worse for writing this review. Why did I write this anyway? Because my friend went in there last week and had a similar ""old tasting burnt"" type experience!

I normally control the sugar intake well below average American but there is just so much exposure to visually appealing sweets in this town.

Plus this heat. Back when we lived in San Francisco, we bought ice creams like a couple of times per year. Per year! But since we moved here we had gelato and yogurt countless times already.

Art of Flavors is one of thoe dangerous places.

They said they make the rice pudding from scratch before using it for the gelato. It was also bomb. I ended up getting the soursop which was super nice. I even got a little lesson on the fruit.

The following review was for the previous management & chef talent of AoF.  Things have changed, and my previous reviews no longer apply.  I haven't been to the new version of AoF, so I have no basis for a rating.  You should look at the dates of the reviews.  Reviews prior to February of 2015 are the older incarnation.  The new version is post May 2015.



I'm in Vegas, and I'm stopping in at Art of Flavors.  Never do one without the other.

First visit I had gingerbread cookie.  This is why I rate this gelato so high: if I made this gelato, it would be different.  But I enjoy Desyree's as much as I imagine I would enjoy my own, perfected version -- and I love what I can create.  AoF's is different, but it's a divine balance.  Any place that can take me somewhere I wouldn't normally go and make me elated for doing it gets 5 stars.  

Second visit I wanted to try more flavors, so I had chocolate.  I almost never get chocolate ice cream.  If  you like chocolate, you have to try this.  I bake and craft a lot of chocolate desserts.  My goal, intense chocolate flavor (it's why I detest red velvet which is light-chocolate and LOTS of food coloring).  This chocolate ice cream is CHOCOLATE.

Some information.  Someone was concerned about the sourcing of the cream.  Except for the vegan gelato (where coconut milk is used) the cream is sourced from cows.

I know I'm not the first to suggest this (a professional review of AoF was the first time I read it), but let me carry the message forward: this is the best gelato / ice cream place in the country.",uyqE8kvAq2LxPnm385T6NA,1,1,5,7r3zf3FJGKMO_QstsMhB7Q

That's my initial reaction every time I come into this gelato shop.

Seriously.

Desiree is so cool. You can taste her passion and hard work through the gelato. She's approachable and will describe each flavour for you and will help you decide on what you really want, since there are so many options. 

I remember one time I was in the shop with a friend and we had rushed down there because we wanted to try the foie gras and rosemary gelato before they closed. By the time we got there we were told they ran out and we would have to come back the next time they were doing it. Fortunately for us, Desiree told us that another customer reserved a pint of the gelato but never showed up for it. So she opened it for us and let us try it and order it. She even helped us pair it with a sorbet to complement the foie gras gelato. Now that's hospitality.

I always recommend Art of Flavors to everyone I meet that asks for good gelato and I've never let anyone down. 

I will continue to support Art of Flavors and eat their gelato for as long as I'm in Las Vegas.

Much love to Art of Flavors.",MzIzsHa1kssFkviGufm-dw,5,3,5,zRIRXJhEXm5kIHv1uVIhfw

Once you walk inside the tiny shop, you will see two huge frig with metal containers filled with diff flavors in subzero temperature.  Sweet corn was the only one I didn't get to try but had the pleasure of sampling over 10 other flavors.  My fav is almost always the Pistachio when it comes to gelato, but the white coffee was amazing too.  I took off one star because the red bean was quite too light in flavor, perhaps I am way too spoiled being Asian(red bean and green tea are just something that need a strong flavor for me), sure, some might like it in the lighter taste, but again doesn't that defeats the purpose of having gelato :P  All in all, a great place for gelato!",qJdgZZkr90BYDLV-Ui25Og,0,0,4,ists4fUf7CbppbMjwfizqQ

Pear & Gorgonzola, Rosemary & Evo, Rose and a Salmon flavored gelato???  Wow! The flavor combinations taste amazingly good and are right on! 

This shop is located right under the shadows of the Strat. You are bound to run into a friend at any given time. It's a happenin area especially among Yelpers with the arepas place next door and the Goodwich across the way. 

Owner and genius Desyree is daring and not afraid to get creative. It is what makes Desy stand out and sets her gelato apart from other dessert places.  Her gelato is so popular, other restaurants are carrying it.  Oh....Confession time...I really go to Novecento just for the gelato...yes I do. Order pizza and take it home to Mr. B and have salad and Art of Flavors gelato there. Or I drive all the way from Hendo over here now.  It's that good!

What sets it apart? The same thing that sets every amazing business from it's competitors: a great product PLUS stellar service.

We walked in and were immediately greeted and helped by the owner and flavor artist herself, Desyree, who encouraged us to try as many flavors as possible and told us all about her house-made, no additives/artificial products, all natural gelatos.  She was so sweet and friendly, I'd love to spend time just picking her brain about culinary stuff.

Every flavor we tried blew us away. The pear and bleu cheese? Wow. The pistachio? Damn. Rice pudding with cinnamon? Holy moly. Hazelnut? Take my money. The white coffee bean? Shut the front door. That's not a kick in the mouth, that's a kick in the nuts. All of them are amazing. She even told me about her olive oil flavor, which sounds right up my alley- and will be in next week!

While I could have easily filled up on free sampling all of the flavors in the case, BF finally settled on a medium cup with two flavors: the spectacular white coffee bean, balanced out nicely with the chocolate brownie, which tasted like the world's most perfect chocolate pudding.

The strange yet delicious variety of gelato here really took me by surprise.  JalapeÃ±o in gelato? Salmon in gelato? What weird dessert dimension did I fall into?  I would have never guessed how wonderful the combinations of flavors would be.  Of course there are the usual flavors such as vanilla or chocolate, but they let you sample anything!

My taste buds didn't stop there.  I had a small cup of their hot chocolate.  It's not like a regular hot chocolate at all.  It's a thicker consistency and very rich in flavor.   I would almost describe it as a hot chocolate shake.  I know.  Sounds different but it was also fabulous!

The flavors were definitely unique like a reddish Bananas Foster or this Strawberry Balsamic Vinaigrette with Pepper which actually isn't as weird tasting as it sounds. I actually recommend that one! The peanut butter one tasted like you scooped it from the jar and salty caramel was perfect. You have the options to get one flavor or up to three flavors. It's nice cos she places the flavors side by side instead of stacked so you can enjoy each one individually.

Owner is super friendly and passionate about her flavors. Feel free to sample whatever you like. She's happy to help you do so. 

Only thing is I wish they offered more seating. If you have a group of four, you pretty much used half the seats available in the store.

ARTfully done.

After a long day of sight-seeing and driving, my friend and I stopped here for a much needed break and cold treat.  

LOCATION:  North end of the Las Vegas strip near the Stratosphere.  Parking lot is slightly on the smaller side within the strip mall where its located.

Amazingly, my friend and I were the only customers when we walked in on a weekday in the later afternoon.  I'm guessing there is not an immediate need or craving for a cold treat in late January in Vegas.  In any case, we took our time to look over the menu and the various flavors on display.

Firstly, offering customers a sample of the gelato base is a great way to to engage their senses, especially in terms of taste.  By encouraging sampling, customers (especially those who have never had gelato) become familiar with the texture and consistency.  I'm not gelato connoisseur by any means, but my friend told me that the gelato at Art of Flavors best resembles the gelato he had on a recent trip to Italy.  

After sampling the base, we were offered a sample of the flavor of the day, rice pudding.  Interestingly enough, we both liked the rice pudding so much we didn't bother to try any other flavor in the showcase.  We ordered two single scoop cones of the rice pudding and enjoyed our gelato while talking about our adventures earlier that day.

SERVICE:  Just outstanding.  The girl who helped us throughout out entire visit was friendly, polite, and very patient while we tried to make a decision on our orders.  She mentioned she creates the flavors from scratch daily, and her dedication and passion for her business was evident as she explained about the gelato base as well as various flavors she creates.

BOTTOM LINE:  Delicious gelato and inventive flavors.  Terrific service.  I'm truly sad to hear they have closed.",HaoPeg2ySVEbQKN3gySxHQ,9,10,4,SUBlttt32-N8YjKSKcLfpw

I loved the savory flavor creations. Very unique and all surprisingly very tasty. The decision of which flavor to actually get a scoop of was difficult. I finally settled on a strawberry one with balsamic vinegar and black pepper, as well as a chocolate one with spicy peppers. Such amazing deliciousness!

Upon walking in, we were instantly greeted by this friendly lady who started us off with a brief intro and handed us samples after samples starting with the plain base she uses for all her gelato. Everything we tried was so creamy and delicious. They were all packed with flavors and very distinctive between each other. 

We ended up getting a medium cup with a scoop of jelly donuts and a scoop of pistachio. The jelly donut gelato was very interesting and had a very donutty yeasty after taste.

The neighborhood was sketchy, but of course it's expected because it's downtown LV. When we first got there it was empty, I'm assuming it's because it was freezing. 

The lady behind the counter was very nice and helpful, I don't remember her name. She had us sample a few of the flavors of gelato she had. I had to get the Ciocolatto, I'm a dark chocolate lover so she sold me upon saying that. The flavor was great, I absolutely loved it. It's the best gelato I've had. 

We took a seat to eat our gelato and the nice lady disappeared to the back. She was replaced by two men in the front who looked like they wanted us to leave. My friend pointed out that they were glaring over at us. I turned back and they were. It was very uncomfortable. It felt like they were giving us the stare down so that we'd leave. They still had an hour to go before closing. That's why I can't give them 5 stars. I didn't enjoy my gelato and ended up throwing half away because I just wanted to get out of there.",RUa2_2yuSwJtU7sTXz-omA,4,1,4,f5dArxBBnBPh187V6vPfgA

My party and I were all drooling in front of the refrigerator where stacks upon stacks of extra gelato sat cool and pretty in all it's majestic glory. If only I had a hankering for a savory concoction.... Maybe next time!
I tried many samples.... Original, Rose, Fruit Loops... Lilac. Man, too many to mention. The owner was more than accommodating and super nice. I ended up ordering the watermelon sorbet with a floral (I think lilac) and it was a great combo. The watermelon was perfect for the hot weather! Not overly sweet or artificial tasting.

Normally, I don't write a heck of a lot of up dates but with the Art of Flavors, I'll make an exception.

All I have to say is this: Sicilian Pistachio.

When I was a kid, I never used to like pistachio given the propensity for the artificial coloring and flavor used to make this particular flavor. As I got older and tasting real pistachio ice cream/gelati, it's become one of my favorite flavors. 

This is one of the best pistachio gelati I've had - so incredibly creamy and delicious.  It would have been great with some real pistachios thrown on top. Like I said... I nearly creamed my pants it was so good.

I also got to try their regular chocolate which I like better than their chocolate mint - rich dark chocolate, remarkably smooth.

The blueberry sorbetto was quite good as well and my husband loved the lightness of this contrasting with the deep chocolate/pistachio flavors.

Oh and to confirm, they do serve brioche con gelato which is brioche bread with gelati pressed in between. 

I love the fact that every time you come, you will have something you've never tried before. I noted that other than the base gelati that they have, I hadn't had most of the flavors they had out 1 week later.

We started by sampling various flavors of gelato and I can say a lot of her flavors here are certainly interesting. Pear Gorgonzola? Mango Jalapeno? Chocolate Chili? After sampling 5 or 6 flavors, I decided to go with a cup of mango jalapeno and strawberries & creme. The gelato here is so flavorful, creamy and smooth, and 2 flavors is only $4.95. They constantly are trying new flavors and everything is made fresh in house. I will definitely have to start coming by here more often to try more flavors.

2360832,2014-01-10,2,O7UMzd3i-Zk8dMeyY9ZwoA,"I finally made it out to Art of Flavors. High five. Chest bump. 

So you just had a good meal and you're craving something cold, sweet, savory, creamy, spicy, or something just unique in a dessert. Just north of the Stratosphere you'll probably find all of that and more at the Art of Flavors. It's a gelato and sorbetto business that makes all the usual favorites like cookies and cream, chocolate, vanilla, and chocolate mint. Honestly I've had way better of those and they were ok. But it was the other flavors that made me a some what fan.  They had pumpkin, peppermint, pistachio, and hazelnut. And then they'll also do something like rosemary and EVOO, maple bacon, pear and gorgonzola, bell pepper, chili peppers, sticky toffee pudding w/ dates, and even a mac n cheese. Don't be discouraged by how weird some of the flavors are, try it. Can I request something with curry!? LOL I'm only joking but I'm sure if they tried to make it they'll make it work.

Chef Desyree, the creator of all these gelato and sorbetto everyone's raving about, is extremely friendly and passionate about her craft. Everything I sampled was delicious, no I didn't try them all, and it came with some sort of story behind the inspiration or explanation of what each ingredient was and so on. It was more than getting some dessert, it felt more like an experience. I'm always appreciative of these kind of people. I was treated like a VIP without doing nothing but walk in and approached the counter. 

Follow them on Facebook or just stop by they're always having a new and unique flavor of the day. It's a small location with not so many seats but I don't think you need a seat to enjoy it. The parking lot and stalls are small, someone dinged my car. The area is kind of sketchy at night so just be aware of what's going on around you.

I'd like to add that after reading an other review I also  noticed that overly milky taste everything had. It's like when you make mashed potatoes using to much dairy. So they dropped a star but I'm sure they'll survive. 3.5 star cause they're making all kinds of creative flavor and all but dont ever crave them or felt wowed enough.",vWP8-aQX0rYJszqkWVL7Ew,8,4,3,q6LUqi7jaKj67_MAL8LFhw

The flavors and quality are as good as you'll find!...But the owners are just as incredible--some of the nicest people around, they care deeply about their product.

Art of Flavors has a lot of typical/traditional gelatos that are executed beautifully, but the real treat is Chef Alberganti's balanced exploration of sweet/savory combinations!  The hype about the sweet corn is legit.  I also enjoyed the pear & gorgonzola, the sweet potato, goat cheese and chocolate & pepper!  Though more traditional, some of my favorites are their peanut butter and pistachio.  They are great about letting you try different samples, and you need to try the daily flavors because they tend to rock!

You can get your frozen treats in a cup, a waffle cone...or...you can do a waffle panini!

When I heard of this place that everyone was raving about, and they're raving about flavors like Pear and Gorgonzola and Red Chile chocolate, of course I had my doubts. It only took one trip, with about 20 samples, to make my mind up that this is by far the best gelato in Las Vegas!! 
Not to mention she won over the 16 and 11 year old. Love it!
My two favorite flavors thus far are Cassata Siciliana, a pannetone style gelato with cannoli cream and chocolate chips. Basically a bunch of Italian desserts, made into a gelato. HEAVEN!! And CrÃ¨me brulee. She actually puts the burned sugar in it, so as you are pretending to have this melt in your mouth pudding, it's like the real thing when you get a chunk of sugar. 
A few other yummy ones are Mango, cookies and cream, Spumoni, and surprisingly enough, the avocado.

The pumpkin blueberry was so creamy and delicious- reminded me of biting into a fresh moist muffin. 
The pistachio was hands down the best pistachio gelato I've ever had! It had a very fragrant pistachio flavor which tasted like eating a handful of those nuts themselves.

I do love dessert, I also love bizarre flavor combinations and unexpected dessert items. My first time here I had to get 3 flavors because I couldn't settle on just one. Cassata Siciliana (reminds me of Pannetone), Sweet Corn and Pear and Gorgonzola. They were all so unique, I couldn't pick a favorite. The bonus is, it's all natural. Does it mean it's good for you? I like to think so. Just kidding. Next stop in I tried Soursop (I love the soursop drink next door at Viva Las Arepas) this one was really refreshing if you are looking for a light, citrus flavor. I then split the Lombardo Panini, it came with hot chocolate, this was the best hot chocolate ever. However, I wasn't a fan of the panini. I may try the Pb&J one at some point. Most recently, my new favorite is the Rosemary & EVOO. I love the rosemary bits througout the gelato.

Originally I just wanted to see what flavors they had but the nice lady behind the counter who introduced herself as Desyree was kind enough to explain the whole process of how everything was made fresh in house and insisted on me sampling any of the flavors. Well, since she insisted, :) I ended up trying almost half of their products.

I ended up getting the Cookies n Cream. So much for just checking it out! Lol. You can taste the overall freshness of the gelato. Next visit maybe I will sample the other half that I didn't get to especially the Chocolate with Red Chili. If that is anything like the Mango Chile Lime at Bacchanal Buffet then that alone warrants another trip here!

I like the overall ambience of the place. Just enough tables and chairs, no weird smells, and very clean. This location is ideal because they are right off of Las Vegas Blvd. Lots of places to check out around the area and this place should be one of them especially during those hot triple digit summer months. But hay, just because its not hot doesn't mean you cant make this as one of your stops!

Service was very professional. Desyree, who I found out later one was one of the owners, was very friendly and outgoing. Definitely no negative vibes here! Love the fact that they are family owned and operated so support your local businesses guys!

When AOF became the new hot spot for dessert, I was really hesitant. I was never a big fan of gelato. I was always an ice cream person. I never liked the consistency nor did I like the taste. Everyone kept telling me that I had to go, but I was still apprehensive. One day after the CMYE at Gold Spike, Cathy suggested that we go. I thought it was a perfect time to try it out, especially since it was down the street. 
 
Desyree is so warm and welcoming. Every time you come in, she gives you samples of the flavors of the day. Even if it's your 1st or 10th time visiting, she will still let you sample as many as you like. I tried it, and now I'm hooked. It's not what I expected at all. The consistency is like a cross between gelato and ice cream. I don't know a better way to explain it, but that's the best I can do. It's light and airy, but still has that richness of ice cream. It's made fresh everyday. And the flavors are so unique and amazing. She uses ingredients that you would never think of to use in gelato, like red bell peppers, rosemary & olive oil, and pear & gorganzola. She also has traditional flavors like chocolate and strawberry. Every day there is a different flavor of the day. My favorite so far has been pistachio and chocolate chili, TOGETHER! Omg so freaking good. 

You can definitely see the pride that Desyree puts into her gelato. I support small business owners and this will definitely be one of my top dessert spots! So if you haven't gone, then I suggest you go!!!!!",BI4jBJVto2tEQ0NiaR0rNQ,5,5,5,nJmw-8iSB3dz5E4vyiT1Lg

Speeding tickets be damned, we made use of my guys lead foot and sped directly to the shop to get a taste before it was gone. Never mind that we had just been there the week prior. Never mind that we had re-devoted ourselves to healthier eating and less sugar. Let this place be our once a week splurge!
We walked in and were greeted warmly. The kind woman behind the counter  fed me sample after sample and I felt ashamed. Other places cut me off and scold me beyond 2 samples. Not here. She wants me to try what I want, until I happily find a match. I did not tell her I already know what I want, but I am so intrigued by the variety of flavors, they are so different from the week before. What if I don't get a chance to try the sweet corn or avocado next time? And what about the apple cobbler and peppermint, what if they are sold out next time? So she indulges me.

I came in and the ambience is nice but not a hip modern place at all. Very simple furniture and decorations.
The man behind the counter greeted us with a warm voice and a welcome smile. He asked if this is our first time since we were both staring at the menu. He introduces us their feature flavors, their non-fat choices, and which combinations go well together. With each introduction, we got a little taste of it. 
When we sat and enjoy our icecream, he came out and ask how we like it. He also told us about their weekly change of flavors. And this is not just us, I saw him trying to reach out and get chairs for a big family, talking to the kids, explaining that the shop has been around a very long time.
So needless to say I love their friendly services. How about the icecream? It is yummy, not icy, creamy, not too soft, cold but not frozen the tongue. 
We got dark nonfat chocolate, mint and creme brÃ»lÃ©e. My girlfriend loves dark chocolate and it surprisingly goes well with their mint. The creme brÃ»lÃ©e with home made caramel is tasty. I can't wait to get salt caramel next time.

B) Churros with Dulce de Leche
C) Salted Unicorn 
D) The Smurf
E) Smoked Salmon
F) Vanilla
G) C and F

I think it may be G but for all I know there may be a secret menu with unicorn extracts. Multiple choice tests were never my thing (essay questions were, hence my lengthy reviews).

I simplified the names of the flavors above as most here are referred to by their fancy authentic names that have 5 or 6 words in them. Daily flavors from their menu are profiled on their Instagram (@artofflavorslv). I didn't have my personal translator accompanying me each time I've visited so I usually just point and say ""that one"" or after sampling one, say ""yes.""

Upon tasting it, I especially say YES! When I took it back to my hotel room once and screamed ""yes yes yes"" after each taste, others on my floor must've thought I had gotten lucky that night. And ohhh yeahhhh, I did, just not in the way they suspected. It was so satisfying that I was able to cancel the call girl I had lined up for later.

There isn't another gelato or ice cream place in Vegas in the same league as Art of Flavors. They draw acclaim from many that say it's true to the standards set it Italy. Chef Desyree is always whipping up some exotic magic that wows the Vegas locals and pulls in dessert savvy out-of-towners. The guy working here is extremely passionate about their product as well, as he enthusiastically offers samples and goes into detail on any flavors you inquire about.

I know some of the flavors in the multiple choice quiz may seem weird. Some of their ingredients are more subtle, so don't be afraid to experiment with the savory ones!  Among my favorites so far have been the Brioche alla Cannella (Cinnamon Roll) and surprisingly enough, the Smoked Salmon.  Their smooth and creamy texture combined with their innovation is a winning recipe.

Art of Flavors is next to Viva Las Arepas on S. Las Vegas Blvd near The Stratosphere. I've gone here my last 2 Vegas trips when I was staying at The Palazzo and SLS (this isn't particularly relevant to the review, I just like to name drop hotels I stay in). Since you're (allegedly) already taking in a lot of sinful things in Vegas, there's no excuse to not get in some sweet and savory gelato while you're at it.",fG-K5NglgWxHg8PNu62afg,18,17,4,XczxwzJvlxn0QDJsU_nFnA

We were scheduled in a couple hours to eat at Michael Mina's for dinner, but it was hot and I wanted ice cream. Art of Flavors had such high ratings, I had to try it and see what the hype was about!

It's a small gelato shop in a small strip area w/ limited parking on the downtown side of vegas. It wasn't crowded when we got there, but we noticed a lot of people just dropping in to buy pints of the gelato to-go. They have so many flavors and the display is so colorful to look at. At the time we went, they didn't have some of the crazy flavors I wanted to try like FRIED CHICKEN LOL :( However, the lady who was helping us, was very sweet. She literally let us sample all the flavors we wanted lol. I love it when they do that w/ a smile! We each got two scoops and a cookie. The cookie was just ok, but the gelato was good.

You can really taste the freshness of the gelato here, it's different than the typical gelatos you get at vegas buffets. Quality is better, but I wished it were more creamy. The portion size is a good amount, but I found that their gelato melts quickly. There were so many flavors it was hard to pick! My bf got the raspberry & coconut, it was very refreshing. I got the cookie butter and their signature fior di latte. It's a good gelato shop, but nothing TOO special. I wouldn't go out of my way to drive here from the strip when there are a bunch of dessert places on the strip.",u6Rb0yrjDvYpAFOgXL8WXQ,2,1,3,djMAB5DJr1YAYPtsD6RUHg

I love that it's a local, small business. That alone bumps up a star from 2. Yes, hate me all you want. I've been to Italy and France where the gelato is kick ass. This was eh. I've tried several flavors both times I went and none of them stood out. They were OK. The pear and gorgonzola sounds dreadful but it was nice; I LOVE gorgonzola and thought I would have went nuts for this, and sadly I didn't. It was Ok. Just like all the others I've tried. I really wanna like this place. Does that count? I mean it, I really do wanna love it here, but I don't get the hype. 
The service is always excellent. They let you try everything! But it really sucks when nothing jumps at you and you've tasted 6 different flavors. You just HAVE to buy something. I don't want to be that scumbag. The prices are good, so I can't even say that's why I'm not in love. It just doesn't do it for me. But, go for yourself and see. It's definitely worth going if you love gelato, but for me, next time I'm out with friends, I'll just pass on this.

The owner was very nice and I was able to sample several flavors. Here were some of gelato / sorbet flavors available during my visit:

Steak and Eggs, Lamponi Raspberries, Pork Pate, Pistachio, Passion Fruit, etc. 

Ananas pineapple (sorbetto alla frutta) + Fior di Latte (milk's flower, sorbetto) $4.95 with 2 flavors - Simply perfect ice to sweetness ratio. Pineapple was just a tad sweet and fior di latte has such a smooth texture and creamy flavor. It was so good that I had to restrain myself from ordering more gelato / sorbet.

If you are not so adventurous, you can stick with the sweet cream.  You may also ask about the flavors in back.  When I arrived, they had pumpkin spice, pistachio, and green tea on reserve.  So, if the flavors up front aren't making you salivate, ask what else is hiding away elsewhere.

Good coffee! Their signature chocolate hazelnut latte was just right.

I like my gelato a little more dense. The gelato here is super light and airy.  One good thing though: it wasn't loaded with guar, xanthum, and a ton of other emulsifiers.  Just dairy, sugar and flavoring.

It came with hot cocoa, and they gave it to us in three little cups.  Wow!  Everything was delicious, down to the hot cocoa.  

We each also got our own two scoops of gelato.  I requested mine in a waffle cone.  It was a hard decision on which two, but I finally went with the pear gorgonzola and  coconut.

The gelato is so creamy but not too heavy. We got the strawberry gelato and strawberry sorbet. Both were unique in their own way but wonderfully delicious. The great thing is that you can go back and forth between the two because it's not extremely sweet or sour. We tried many flavors - none were bad but some flavors didn't rock my world. That's okay - just find the one you like, since we all like different flavors. I have to say the price was really reasonable for this quality... $4.95 for two big scoops.

There is a bathroom and it was kept nicely clean.  In addition to the gelato, she serves some baked goods and coffee and tea.

The parking is the only potential drawback.  During the day, it's probably more difficult to get a space here but I got one right in front of the sexy clothing women's store.  Viva Las Vegas!

4014421,2015-03-06,0,O7UMzd3i-Zk8dMeyY9ZwoA,"Wow...guess this is a posthumous review now that Art of Flavors is no longer operational.  How weird is it I finally got to visit only the weekend before?  Sad.

It was busy on a Saturday night in which is a very suspect neighborhood.  Line was practically out the door.  We ended up of course being helped by the uber friendly Desyree, who gave us a quick rundown of Art of Flavors various concoctions for the night, and some quick samples.  We tried the base, which to me tasted very good, not sickly sweet, good consistency, and great mouth feel.  I know some of these other reviews say their gelato base is horrible, but oh well what do I know.  I really don't eat that much gelato so I am no expert on this topic.  Little did I know that Desyree was working her last week here!  That's what I get for not following their Facebook page.

We ended up with three different cups of gelato to try - Chai Tea Latte & Pistachio for the wifey, Cookies & Cream and Passion Fruit (such a weird combo) for the little one, and Espresso for me.  Flavors were actually quite tasty!  Each one actually tasted like their titles said they would.  Flavors were very pronounced as well, especially in the Espresso, liked it very much!  Strong essence of espresso, with a hint of cream, and I like mine dark.  Tasty!  Pistachio was another favorite, full of crushed pistachio and nutty.  Passion Fruit was sweet and at the same time tart, like an actual passion fruit!  We all enjoyed our gelato flavors, and had no problem finishing up our cups.  

Only complaint I have is with the price.  I know, I know, I'm a cheapie, but damn...$6 for a medium size cup with two flavors?  $3.25 for a one scoop small cup?  Whew!  Before we knew it, nearly $16 down for gelato.  Boy you fancy, huh?  I thought these were prices they only charge in Summerlin and Seven Hills...not Downtown LV by the Stratosphere!  Guess that's what we get for artisanal.

Thinking back, I feel really bad saying to Desyree ""See you next time!"" and not knowing she would be long gone by the end of the month.  I was honest though, because in their freezer they had so many ODD flavor combinations I wanted to try!  Weird, obscure, and curious flavors like:

-Rice Crackers with Soy Sauce
-Tuna & Salmon Spicy Sushi Roll
-Apple Pie with Yellow Mustard
-Hummus
-Roasted Garlic with Cookie Butter & Caramel
-Roasted Beets with Ricotta & Rosemary
-Spaghetti & Meatballs!

It's like going Willy Wonka on gelato!  I would have sampled each flavor if possible!  Now I'm afraid none of us will get to try this sweet treat again.  Art of Flavors...you will be missed.  Even though I hardly knew thee.",QCtHk02W_Asu2LFfdmGQDA,0,0,4,9wS9ixGvgR4J7Th5uxEgUg

The only gelato I've had is at Caesar's Palace so maybe I am no authority but this place is so good! 

I'm a die hard Luv It and Cold Stone fan but this definitely is my new favorite cold dessert place.

So they make all of their gelato in house. They have about 10-12 flavors at a time from what I can see. If you get a small you can pick one flavor. If you get a medium you can get up to two flavors. If you get the biggest I believe you can get 3. The prices I believe are $3.50, then about $5, and then maybe $6.50.

I got the caramel cookie which was a flavor of the day and half of the pistachio baklava.

I was so glad I did get that pistachio baklava.

Did I say pistachio baklava too much? 

The pistachio baklava changed my life.

The pistachio baklava is the pinnacle of frozen creamy desserts.

The pistachio baklava is a must try.

The pistachio baklava is so.. Creamy, perfectly sweet, rich, buttery, and mildly nutty.

Although the caramel one was good the awesomeness of the pistachio baklava was just making it taste .. Not memorable.

If you do, which I do suggest you go, I suggest you get one flavor to really appreciate it.

This place is really special.

My family & my niece especially loved it as well.

It was so busy I do suggest extra seating. That's the only thing I can say.

4052693,2015-02-26,4,O7UMzd3i-Zk8dMeyY9ZwoA,"When I heard that Art of Flavors was closing on February 28th, I realized I had yet to review this beloved establishment. So I started my draft, and at that time, I was hovering between 3 and 4 stars... That was then, and this is now. Let me explain what changed my mind about AoF...

I had lunch plans at nearby Goodwich, and we were planning on having some gelato for dessert. Only there was a slight problem. It was noon, and Art of Flavors doesn't open until 1. 

Chef Desyree, the woman behind all of the amazing flavors, saw us outside her store, looking like someone just killed our pet puppy because we weren't going to get any gelato. She let us in, gave us hugs, let us sample all we wanted and even encouraged us to stay to enjoy what we had purchased.  What a fantastic business woman and kind hearted person she is!! 

I am not going to pretend I am so sort of gelato expert, because I am not. I just know what I like, and I like what I get here. There are always a couple flavors that sounds so strange but end up tasting amazing when I go in, and the classics are perfect. 

Knowing that Art of Flavors is closing soon, and that if it reopens it will be without Desyree, I still debated giving AoF that 5th star. While Art of Flavors knocks it out of the park with regard flavor and service, the ambiance is lacking a bit. The parking situation could be better. ""Woohoo! As good as it gets!"" isn't really what I comes to mind when I think of this particular location.

But  Desyree? Desyree deserved 5 stars and then some. The woman is a magician when it comes to flavor profiles. I'm not that sad about Art of Flavors closing, ONLY because I know that  Desyree will be back in an even better establishment before we know it, killing it with her gelato creations,",Ae4uXwFHp-5fGrt6OONaXw,10,11,5,QH9zFwbnBwWJ_B8YF50BWQ

First of all, there's a wide array of flavors to choose from.  You can select an ice cream base or sorbet.  I'm not much of a sorbet fan and opted for their ice cream base gelato.  I had two flavors...peanut butter and hazelnut.  This was the perfect combination for me with the hazelnut on top and peanut butter on the bottom.  

Hazelnut:  Creamy and taste is similar to a Ferrero Rocher.  Creamy goodness

Peanut Butter:  I love me some peanut butter. I go through jars of peanut butter each week. Some places make it too strong, while some make it with almost no hint of peanut butter. At Art of Flavors got it right. I found the taste of their peanut butter more subtle, which mixed well with the hazelnut. http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=64DIwQG1Yl_wDGaoTKE2tQ&userid=y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQ

Obviously, there's more than just flavors like hazelnut and peanut butter. You can try their samples if you're undecided.  But for me, I know what I'm getting when I come back.  

As for service, they are second to none.  We came in about 15 minutes before closing and AOF was still on their game...dealing with multiple gelato craving peeps, handing out samples, detailing their flavors, and even giving us a little history of where they're from.  You'll almost feel like you're the only customer because they make sure that your questions are answered. 

PS:  More than just gelato here.  They got some food too.  One item on their menu that I'm curious about is their gelato stuffed panini.  Maybe next time.

On my first visit, the owner Desyree just kept giving me different flavors to try and was not stingy about it!. I think I tried about 10 different ones until I made my decision....

I had the pear gorgonzola on top of creme brulee. It was nice a savory snack and dessert at the same time. Well, the pear gorgonzola is actually not cheesy strong, it was just light enough that you can taste the cheese but sweet with the pear jam. Creme brulee was creamy and had crunchy bits of burnt sugar. It was soooooooo good.

On my second visit, within 5 days, they had new flavors. They were grapefruit, arancia (orange), corn, rum raisin, and others but I only tried these. I am still in love with the pear gorgonzola so I got that with sweet corn on top. 

I love that the owner is not afraid to try new flavor combinations in sweets and look forward to future flavors.

After a great lunch today in the Spring Mountain area, I was wondering how I could possibly find a dessert to match the wonders that my taste buds had just experienced. Somehow, Snowflake Shavery did not seem right for the occasion. The texture is always welcome, but they tend to have subtle flavors.

Then I remembered to check the Art of Flavors Twitter feed and I saw that creme brulee was a flavor of the day. Bingo.

The first time I'd been to this local mecca of gelato was actually last month on my birthday. It was a ridiculously rainy day, so I figured I needed something to cheer myself up. It was empty right before I arrived, but owner / gelato maestro (maestra? I don't know these words) Desyree Alberganti was happy to greet me after making sure that I hadn't intended to walk into Viva Las Arepas instead. Look, I might have glasses, but I can find my way around 

So anyway, she proceeded to ask me if I'd been there before. I hadn't. So she started me off on what I learned was a sampling tour of several of the gelateria's offerings. She explained that the first sample, fior di latte, was the simple base on which all the other flavors were constructed. I could go on and on, but I sadly don't remember all the flavors from that day. However, I remember one flavor that I made a part of my eventual order; rosemary and olive oil. You might think that those flavors wouldn't work in a dessert, but trust me, they do.

I forgot what I ordered on my second visit, but there was definitely a pistachio flavor. And there were two other flavors. Maybe a pumpkin spice flavor, which was pretty good. Can't remember if mango happened on the first or the second visit, but it's the most authentic mango I've ever had in a frozen dessert in comparison to the real fruit. It's not super sweet like you'll typically find in a boba drink or whatnot.

On that second visit, I learned that pistachio could also work in a gelato (having always had cheap pistachio ice creams in the past), and I also learned that eating three flavors slowly will inevitably allow the bottom flavor to melt into a sweet yet not-solid soup. Good lesson.

Today was my third visit. I had some more samples. The German chocolate cake, a flavor of the day, was surprisingly good. I love chocolate, but I usually don't enjoy German chocolate cake for some reason. This time, the pecans worked, the coconut wasn't too off-putting, and the chocolate shined. I ended up having German chocolate cake as flavor #1, with flavor #2 being creme brulee. The brulee was there, although it was significantly harder to crunch through than a typical creme brulee. It's still a nice touch.

I think I've finally had enough positive experiences to give Art of Flavors my full vote of confidence. Check out this place if you're ever in town, sample everything (especially ""weird"" flavors), and go with what your mouth says is right. It also helps if you've eaten something nice beforehand with a lot of spices or other palate-opening flavors, as long as you save yourself just enough room for dessert.",_VMGbmIeK71rQGwOBWt_Kg,10,7,5,0GIzExLYJOv4WJKditCI5w

Greeted by the connoisseur Amanda, she explained all the wonderful and shear awesomeness that is AOF. Having gone through everything we decided the special birthday cake was the way to go, as it was AOF birthday, with my son grabbing the strawberry gelato we were set.

I wish I could literally list every flavor, but I would be up all night. So I decided to list some of my favorites so far. Starting with Cookie Butter! Cinnamon toast crunch, sticky toffee pudding, peach cobbler, lucky charms, fruit loops, Fiore de latte, chocolate sorbetto, every fruit flavor of sorbetto, lavender... And this isn't even all of them. Or the ones to come in the future. I admit, some flavors are just completely strange and make my jaw fall open. But the flavors are true. For me one of the most outrageous was Rose Petal. It tasted just as a rose smells. No way I could eat a whole serving, but tops the list for me in strange, amazing, crazy, spectacular flavors. 

Always great service! You are greeted when you enter and can try as many flavors as your little heart desires. The area is not the best, but it's downtown so what do you expect. It doesn't hinder us from frequenting weekly.

First of all, the owner Desyree is super nice and will let offer you tastes of all of the flavors. DO NOT RESIST. They are all exceptional. Standouts for me include the coffee, mango, and the chocolate. Oy, the chocolate! The chocolate here is superb, albeit a bit rich, but I love rich desserts so I was in heaven. Desyree explained that the chocolate gelato's consistency is a bit different because of the amount of water that she adds to it, thus lending it a mousse-like consistency. She recommended mixing a fruit or coffee scoop to balance out the richness, but I opted for a cone of chocolate. For less than 5 dollars, it is a meal onto itself.

While we were eating Desyree kept coming over to check on us, bring us fresh-baked cookies and explaining what else the shop will be offering in the future such as gelato cakes and gelato cookies. So to conclude, five star service and six star gelato can't be beat!

4293832,2014-05-30,2,O7UMzd3i-Zk8dMeyY9ZwoA,"This was my dessert on my birthday after eating at Soho Sushi, another business with an unbelievable 5 star average with 100's of reviews. Well, I have to say this might have been my finest 1 2 punch in terms of dinner and desert in one evening. 

The place is in a bit of a crap area, and quite frankly my girlfriend and I were like...wtf? Where is this random 5 star place in the middle of all this junk? From the outside it's very understated and unassuming, but inside was very nice. Reminded me of nicer cold stones. 

Anyway, we got in and the owner who I believe was Desyree asked if it was our first time. We said yup, just moved to the area 3 weeks ago. She then launched into an unbelievable tour of the gelato. Without asking, she started handing us sample after sample and guiding us as to what we were experiencing at what her methodology was. She was one of the most passionate and friendly business owners I've ever met, one of the ones that truly stand out. 

One moment in particular was quite surreal, she gives me the Cioccolato e Peperoncino (chocolate with red chile), and as she confidently hands it to me she tells me that I'll get a nice chocolate flavor and then in about five seconds it will hit the back of my throat with spice. I had already put in my mouth as she was saying that, and like clockwork the spice hit my mouth and throat. It was incredible. I ordered that along with cookie butter and amazing strawberry cheesecake gelato. She also gave me a taste of AVOCADO gelato. Talk about experimenting with flavors! It was spot on too. This woman is unbelievable at what she does. 

My girlfriend got the fruity flavors, which were the most authentic tasting fruit gelato I've ever had. This woman very clearly is an artist, and she takes this stuff very seriously and is passionate about it. For me, this place is the epitome of a five star establishment. Incredible product, reasonable prices, local owners, and owners that are extremely passionate about customer service and the quality they put out. 

This place and Soho sushi are two perfect examples of local businesses that I want to support forever, and I hope they continue to have such success in the local community. With passion and quality like this, something tells me they will.",x-W0OQiUdNLsoMhg6GfXSg,4,4,5,rES_OTOEMScKE8pYKUMHdA

The scoops are generous and prices are pretty reasonable. The staff are really friendly and obviously love where they work.

From what I gather, they have daily creative flavors (or perhaps weekly?). On our visit, it was fried chicken with waffle and maple syrup. Weird as it sounds, and although it will not be one of my go-to flavors anytime soon, they were able to make it work.

I would like to thank Amanda M. for raving about Art Of Flavors. I am truly addicted to all of the glorious flavors Chef Desy concocts. I mean who makes their own bomboloni(italian doughnut) grinds it up and makes gelato out if it....CHEF DESY DOES!! The white coffee bean is truly unique you look at this vanilla looking gelato and then taste it. First you taste creamy, smooth, sweet gelato, as it travels your palette you get the full body, bitter flavor of coffee. It's so multi-dimensional and surprising!!! 

On my first visit Chef Desy greeted my family and I, as my daughter pleaded for strawberry. Chef Desy handed her a sample of strawberries and cream right away. We got her a single scoop and we sat her down to get down to business. She started handing us sample after sample and I loved every single one. For my first visit I did 2 scoops, bomboloni and pistachio. My hubby got chocolate and tiramisu.  Now as stated before about HOW she makes her bomboloni I didn't know this. So my first taste was OH CRAP it taste like a powdered sugar doughnut!! Pistahio was perfect with spots of the nut throughout. I dipped my pistachio in my hubbys chocolate and it was a match made in heaven. Tiramusu has chunks of fluffy lady finger running through. All in all we were in happyland enjoying our gelato. 

I have to admit I am an addict and went 3 days in a row. My 3rd visit has left me in utter awe.

4582384,2015-02-26,5,O7UMzd3i-Zk8dMeyY9ZwoA,"Sadly, reviewers have no clue what good ice cream and gelato is.

I tasted several flavors and the cookie butter was alright (it seems to be the first sample, the gentleman at the counter offers), everything else lacked flavor.

The ""chef"" and gentlemen at the counter are so super nice, I felt bad and bought a pint of the birthday cake to go (in hopes it would be good as I had yet to taste it). It wasn't one of the flavors they had out that day, so they had to grab some from the back for me, which is why I had to get a pint of it.

Regrettably, it also lacks flavor and believe me... I do not leave ice cream uneaten - I tried to jazz it up with Trader Joe's Fleur de Sel Caramel and some pistachios but lo and behold, it doesn't make up for the gelato not being worth a damn. If I were Steve Jobs, I would say, ""this is sh*te!"" 

If you really want to know what good is, try Neveaux Artisan Creamery on Melrose in LA or Bonavantura Gelato Lounge in Manhattan Beach on Manhattan Beach Boulevard. These two places alone will change your life. You will have never had it so good.

The cake batter at cold Stone creamery blows this place away, so does Baskin Robbins. I am ALL FOR mom-and-pop shops and much rather would support small business owners, but the product needs to be good.

I don't know who sold their soul to the devil or how they got all these five star reviews, but I just got to keep it real when I waste my time, energy, and money on something less than mediocre, and when reviewers are so off-base.

Again, the people working here are just beautiful humans.

Make a better product and I will come back and update my review.

4692739,2014-08-19,8,O7UMzd3i-Zk8dMeyY9ZwoA,"Art of Flavors is a completely apt name for this gelato cafe. The chef/owner will walk you through each flavor and give you a glimpse as to the method to his madness. Each flavor is carefully dissected in terms of ingredients and the owner will try to guide you to a flavor that fits your profile. The best part is all the unique flavors at this cafe make it seem like you're being lead through an art gallery and each work (scoop/flavor) is different and special and must be appreciated.

I thought some of the flavors of the day which included Steak and Eggs and Cafe de Giorno were particularly interesting to taste. The Steak and Eggs tasted more like eggs mixed with A-1 sauce but though it was savory, it still had a slight sweetness to it.

Ultimately we settled on more traditional flavors but they were equally as vibrant and with an exoticness that you don't find at many other gelato places.

I'm a stickler for texture in gelato or ice cream and I thought Art of Flavors has some of the more creamier gelato you'll find in Vegas. There was a tinge of iciness but nothing to derail a great scoop of ice cream.

This is easily one of the best gelato spots in Vegas and made doubly special by the fact that it is the neighbor to Viva Las Arepas. Two gems right next to each other like an Infinity Gauntlet.

My visit was alongside veteran Yelpers, so as she was catching up with everyone, she realized it was my first time. That meant immediate sampling of flavors she insisted I try and I was not complaining.

I sampled Strawberry & Thyme, Chocolate, Apple & Asparagus (SORBETTOS) and Strawberries & Cream, Chocolate Almond, Pistachio, Pear & Gorgonzola, Fior di Latte, Green Tea, Maple (GELATOS). Everything was delicious. The gelatos and sorbettos are all extremely creamy with texture perfection. The incredible flavors are well developed, robust without being overpowering or too sweet. It's truly amazing. I am a big fan of gelato, however, I've always been on the fence about sorbet because of its usual sweet and tart characteristics. Art of Flavor's sorbets are nothing like that. There are also flavors that I associate with bad experiences, like pistachio, but their renditions will completely change your mind!

After tasting so many delicious flavors, it was very difficult to make a decision! I finally decided that I wanted to go with the popular Pear & Gorgonzola Gelato with another flavor to accompany it. So, of course I asked for DesyreÃ©'s recommendations. She had three combinations in mind depending on my preferences: Cioccolato e Peperoncino (chocolate with pasilla and red chile), Pistachio, or Chocolate. I sampled the combinations, except the spicy chocolate, and both were really tasty; amazing pairings!

So, I finally settled on Pear & Gorgonzola with Pistachio and it was phenomenal. So, so delicious. Both flavors were wonderful individually, but together, it created a dance on my tastebuds! Toward the end of my cup, I blended the two gelatos together and it was just heavenly.

Seriously, bravo!! This is a true gem and culinary masterpiece. I love the large selection of amazing flavors and I absolutely love the fact that they are constantly creating and experimenting new flavors - it's exciting!

a. We got here at 1:00 because we were making this a destination visit and did not want to have issues with parking or waiting too long.  They open at 1:00 on Sundays.

b.  Desyree greeted us and saw our wide eyed excitement, so she kindly asked us if this was our first time.  We were already entranced by the works of art known as gelato in her display case.  This is no regular gelato place. This is not the gelato you find being served by servers. This is gelato that are creations into themselves and you are part of the experience.

c.  The Gelato - I am not going to even start to spell or type the names of all the flavors that there were.  The apple jack was creative.  Yes, bits of apple jack mixed into a creamy topping over the gelato.  Amazing how the gelato did not overpower the apple jack taste at all. Brought back great memories of being a kid.  The key lime was absolutely top notch and I would choose this over key lime pie any day.  I used to have Key Lime pie flown in from Florida to Paris for events, and let me tell you, this gelato was the top.  There was hazelnut, almonds, pistachio, strawberry with thyme, berry flavors , cookies and creme, and more.  I cannot put in words how great this stuff looked. Seriously, I have no idea the calories of this stuff, but I would skip lunch anyway, and trap a tablespoon (or larger) and just have a field day in her display cabins.  

d.  The experience - I mean, we are talking about pride here. this is about quality, about a vision, a desire and a passion for being the best. I enjoy being part of this and having experiences what so many yelpers have wrote about.

Thanks fellow yelpers Rod U, Tony T, Norm K, Nelson Q, for all the comments. Not sure how I will have as many checkins as some of you, but I am so glad to have checked out this place......

I had tried to rush after dinner make it to Art of Flavors, having arrived five minutes before the store closed and thankfully they still let us in! Bonus points from solid 4 stars for flavors and  +1 star for service and creativity.

What I love:

The service was an art in its own: offering samples before you even had the chance to ask.
The flavors were true and amazing. 
The wall of gelato with flavors like cheetos, nori crackers and salmon that I wanted to taste. (not offered during my visit)

The a few things that were disappointing was that I only got to try some Desyree's and not the exotic ones and the day after I went her Instagram said that she will no longer be with Art of Flavors.  I wish her great success wherever she ends up at and hope that we will all be able to soon taste her creations again.

I hope to return again during my next visit, crossing fingers that the stars will remain high and mighty! Good luck to both partners at Art of Flavors.",WHB7WXYQ8X_f0_GdRa0Gfg,4,5,5,kqn7ifKx-E1dahXE7jS2SQ

I love the service.
I love the unique flavors.
I love it all.

Desyree is the sweetest lady and I love how she is so generous with the samples, especially when it's during your very first visit. She lets you try it all and you don't feel bad about trying it.  The hard part is trying to decide on which ones you want to order.  

I love that she goes all out and makes some crazy concoctions!  I've been fortunate to try the Foie one, but have yet to try some of her other wild mixes.  Nonetheless, I'm sure they are all wonderful.  This is an easy place to recommend to visitors!  Follow them on Instagram to get the latest flavors of the day!

* Note of caution: Be careful parking here as the limos that belong to that bridal store down the road are not careful drivers.  They pulled out quickly and almost hit our car, and of course, didn't even notice (or care) that they did that.  Good thing we saw them coming!",rt3PC7WCgCKsoufmQJELfw,15,14,5,dJVQ5GhHmgt90G8eCazmvA

As we walked in the door we ran into fellow Yelper Nelson Q. getting ready for his UYE event. 

The shop is a great little gelato shop. The staff is super friendly and ready to help you with any questions.They have a bunch of flavors to choose from. Some are classic flavors and others are very unique. It was fun to get to sample some of the flavors and they even asked if we had any food allergies. We first tried the basic plain gelato, very creamy. Next we got to sample the flavors of the day. I loved the Lemon Pound Cake and Sapore Del Giomo which had cookies and cream, raspberry preserves and caramel! mmmmm we decided on one scoop of that. Yummy! It was so tasty and not just cause it's been along time since I've had gelato either. It was super creamy and you could taste each layer of flavor in it.

I'm not normally one for sweets, but when I get that craving i'll for sure be coming back to Art of Flavors try more of their flavors of the day! It is worth the drive from what ever side of town your on!",pUQdU4MlkB46jIdYs9oMUA,4,2,5,_Nehs3r1Z-RdYNGVUnzFvQ
5049706,2014-01-16,5,O7UMzd3i-Zk8dMeyY9ZwoA,"I have a frozen treat fetish - the weirder the flavor the better and ice cream making is a little hobby of mine (though I rarely have the chance to make any). I like just about any frozen dessert, but it's the oddities that get me the most happy. 

Since it was our first time, we got to try a generous barrage of flavors. That was so awesome and didn't make it easy at all to figure out what to get. The ""odd"" flavors we got to try was a red pepper jelly gelato and a dill pickle sorbet. We also had avocado, green tea, strawberry thyme, etc. Stuff like this just makes my heart smile. 

I got a 3 flavor and my plan of attack was to get stuff that paired well together. I got a chocolate with pasilla and chile peppers which was nice with the gorgonzola pear which in turn was great with the pistachio. The chocolate was deep, rich and had a spice that crept up on you. The gorgonzola was gorganzola dolce which is a milder varietal and one of my favorites that we make into a rich risotto with, of course, crushed pistachios. This was a nice pistachio since it was the real flavor and not that frangipane tasting stuff.

 The texture is ideal - smooth and right amount of air, sweet, and butterfat. It's closer to what a gelateria would be in Europe and apparently Desyree has family in Italy with gelato boutiques so it makes a lot of sense that it follows the Italian standard. Gelato varies so much in the US because we actually don't have a standardized ruling to how it should be made and what can be called gelato. I find most places tend to be sweeter and I overall prefer this more natural tasting product. 

It's a first visit, but the next visit will be soon. I know we're going to frequent this place. It just took a while since it's in a spot were normally not at, but since we found a special cigar hangout nearby, this can very well become a weekly ritual. The BF, our friend and I all loved it.

I have been telling the BF for YEARS that a gelato/ice cream with exotic flavors is something we really need and finally, here is the answer to that whim. I believe the hype!",n86B7IkbU20AkxlFX_5aew,8,5,5,GjoFTIIst_xTqbpquL3juw

They have a variety of unique flavors in the back and they change it each day and add more to keep things interesting! Wow, we got to try a lot of gelato and it was all delicious! My favorite flavors had to be the Fat Elvis and the Coffee, which tastes EXACTLY like a coffee bean. With the larger sizes, you can even mix flavors! Also, they even serve other menu items other than gelato! Absolutely amazing. 

I just love this place so much. If it weren't so hard to park at, I would definitely go more often haha! The inside is small and intimate like a cafe, and just the perfect place to sit and enjoy!

I'm OBSESSED! And now that I have liked their Facebook page (lol) I will definitely be stopping by more often! Art of Flavors is a dessert-lover's dream that every person should try at least once! So stop by and savor the flavor!!!",OoyQYSeYNyRVOmdO3tsxYA,7,6,5,_4q515Dk8owGJv8KechMgQ

I would recommend coming in to grab this as a snack so you can savor the flavors and appreciate them on your palette. If you come in full you won't have the same experience. 


That being said I was in the area one day and I knew I had to finally experience Art of flavors for myself. The owner herself greeted me and told me that she makes everything herself and let me try the base which is used for all the gelato flavors. She also proceeded to let me sample any and all the flavors in the case! Or as many as I wanted to try. She has sweet and savory which sets her gelato apart from others IMO. Me myself personally I have a hard time choosing. In general wherever I go in fears of regretting what I will order.  I went with pistachio because I was having a pistachio craving, which I later regretted. Not because it wasn't good but because she has unique flavors you won't find anywhere else. If I remember correctly flavor of the day was pesto pizza that day. Interesting but very good. I wish I would have got it. 

Anyways art of flavors is great if you love sweet or savory because you will find something to fit your palette. With flavors constantly changing there is always something interesting and different to try and taste. Not to mention the gelato quality is amazing. This place is as good as it gets.

Came here with Michelle G. and other friends and I kid you not, as we were eating our gelato there was silence, eyes were rolling back and then the commentary started:
""I feel like a kid again""
""I'm just so happy right now""
""This is the best thing ever""
""I am so gelato wasted right now""

Chef Desyree is such a culinary genius and totally sweet.  If you're planning to order two scoops, she will totally help you with pairing.  The flavors here are creative, which include sweet and savory options. I was able to sample many and they were all so good! Some of the flavors are bacon/brie, pear/blue cheese, rosemary/EVOO. Soursop, a tropical fruit was yummy too!

My absolute favorite here is the strawberry/watermelon w/ thyme. A close second are the kit kat creations (depending on the day the kit kat concoctions are white chocolate or matcha green tea). There is just a lovely aftertaste of sweet wafer goodness!

This neat spot north of the strip surely deserves more than five stars! The area is so hip and nice foodie options nearby :) Stay tuned for the flavor(s) of the day on their IG: artofflavorslv",OPJ0TW8tt5UanY2_YpCgIQ,4,5,5,bpRKvrjTjbttVN5jIzaJcg

5094818,2014-03-24,13,O7UMzd3i-Zk8dMeyY9ZwoA,"Finally a gelateria that rivals those of Firenze or Roma; almost.  The Italian spirit is alive and well.  A myriad of made fresh daily gelato, a warm smile, tastes of this and that offered enthusiastically. 

Product Pros:
- Made fresh daily.
- Good density and smooth texture of the gelato.  Near creamy, texture for the sorbetto.
- Well extracted, clean, concentrated flavors.  Fruit flavors in the mango and strawberry excellent.  Both taste and smell like the sun ripened fruit.  Pistachio, avocado, and white coffee (a baked rather than roasted bean that has the flavor of roasted nuts and an herbaceous tea like finish), all aromatic and deeply flavored.
- The gelato base flavor, fior di latte (milk's flower), milky, creamy, fatty in a good way.  Well controlled sweetness.
- Great savory flavors.  Well balanced flavors.  The rosemary and EVOO, classically Italian with the hint of rosemary aroma and taste finishing peppery with the flavor of olive oil.  The chocolate with pasilla and red chilies; brooding, almost bitter chocolate flavor with a spicy kick on the finish.

Product Cons:
- Pasteurized milk and the terrior is not evident.
- Sweetness of inventive dessert flavors mimics the real dessert (ie peach cobbler).  High and cloying.

Note:  They make gelato for several restaurants including Novecento Pizzeria.  Freshness matters.  Make the trek to experience the best.

As soon as we walked in we were kindly greeted and offered samples of almost all the flavors because it was our first time. WE WERE IN HEAVEN.  It was so hard to decide, they all tasted delicious!!

My friends got Strawberry & Thyme w/ cantoloupe, and Matcha Green Tea Kit Kat. They're all really good, there are no bad flavors here. 

The decor is simplistic and inviting and i also noticed the lucky cat, in Asian culture that signifies luck in business, it will help bring in customers and business. i love seeing those :) and their products and services definitely proved it! 

They were so kind to us. I could see how much passion and love that goes into their gelato and everything about their business. 

TOP QUALITY SERVICE & addictive flavors...what's not to love?! We will be back FOR SURE.

I was craving gelato while walking around on the strip so I yelped this place and was sold on the 5 star rating! 

GELATO:
AMAZINGGG. So fresh and light and creamy and flavorful!! Desyree, the owner, was super duper nice and gave us so many samples right when we walked in and also any flavor that we wanted to try. 

- Fior de Latte - only the best gelato places have this flavor!! It's the base of all gelato flavors and this was soo good and creamy and refreshing!
- Spumoni - Now, I'm usually not a fan of spumoni because the cherry always tasted super artificial - but this was soooo good! Super pistachio-y and the cherry tasted real!
- Mango - super fresh and mango-y!

I also sampled the blueberry, coconut (I thought this was good and I don't even like coconut!), creme brulee and a bunch of other flavors I can't remember.

SERVICE:
AWESOME! Desyree is so so nice and friendly! She explained the gelato flavors to us and was super nice about giving us samples and helping us decided which 3 flavors to narrow it down to. She also seemed to have some regular customers/family/friends who came in to visit her!

LOCATION & PARKING:
Oddly located in a sketchy plaza just past the main Strip. Parking is aplenty in the lot but be careful when you're walking around!

VENUE:
Colorful and homey decorations, cute tables and very pretty gelato display.

From pear and gorgonzola, to chicken and waffles,a vinagrette flavor, basil, regular base gelato, white chocolate kit kat one which was my favorite. I combined that with some cookies and cream and it was awesome. I even had a taste of what my wife had which was rocky road and white coffee which was just amazing gelato.

Every flavor here seems to be made with love and the great thing about their gelato is that it's not overly sweet on the palette and you can taste the flavors in the gelato I will definitely be back not sure when because downtown is far but maybe I'll go to novacento pizza down the street from my house to pick up some of the art of flavors gelato there.",aWXGwath_dSGPwNdFiy9BQ,1,1,5,kprfT64bvEd0MECsNkWIaQ

Having made a special request of Banoffee gelato for an ice cream obsessed friend from England who was visiting for The Olympia it can only be said that Desyree and team came through again, the quality and innovation of her creations continuing to shine in that tiny space in the shadow of the Stratosphere.  Clearly a spot earning it's accolades with an ever-present owner who seems to remember 3/4 of the patrons by face or by name it was just before 3:00pm that our group of four arrived at 1616 South Las Vegas Blvd and nabbing the last parking spot we were greeted on entry, a fair bit of tasting followed by an order of three flavors each.  Impressed by samples ranging from soda to sesame it was with nearly-bitter dark chocolate and whimsical cookies n' cream studded with sprinkles, sparkles, and bits of cake that my trio began and rounding things out with our special request I couldn't help but be amazed, the robust  flavor of ripe bananas with only the slightest bit of additional sweetness afloat in a creamy base as pockets of rich toffee added both its characteristic topnote and texture, a bit of caramelized sugar even getting stuck in my teeth.

The location is quite interesting. It's next door to an adult clothing store and across the street from Olympic Garden. The people in this area are just as interesting. So you wouldn't expect a nice gelato shop in this neighborhood. But thanks to Amanda M's check-ins here and Nelson Q's UYE, I finally got to try this place that I have bookmarked for a month now.

They have flavors such us spicy chocolate, sweet corn, avocado, biscotti and chocolate, Caribbean fusion and the usual flavors like pistachio and hazelnut. My favorite flavors are pistachio and hazelnut (gianduja was not available today) but I wanted to be bold and get something else. So, I went with a large cup with 3 flavors: sweet corn, avocado and Carribean fusion. They were amazing. I chose these flavors because they reminded me of ice cream flavors I had when I was little. Sorbet-wise, I liked passion fruit, mango, guava and, cucumber and ginger. You can get your gelato in an ice cream sandwich if you want.

Their gelato is super creamy and Chef Desyree said she doesn't use eggs unless for flavors such as creme brÃ»lÃ©e. Their sorbetto is made with water, sugar and fruit so it's perfect for vegans and those who want something sweet but are watching their calorie intake.",tH0uKD-vNwMoEc3Xk3Cbdg,12,9,5,MwPcWEUNQffVoRY0th2VXA

Seriously, if you want to impress someone with great taste and not breaking the bank, may I suggest a Saturday night at starting at Viva Las Arepas, then Art of Flavors, and then heading to Dino's (all within realistic walking distance of each other) for cheap drinks and karaoke.

Art of Flavors is a small shop and soon as I walked in the door I was greeted with a warm hello and asked if this was my first visit. As soon as I stayed yes, she started dishing out the samples. She started of with their base gelato. Creamy, subtle, and light in flavor. She told my sister and I that flavors change and are made fresh daily. Before entering, my sister was like, nah, I don't want anything. After a few samples, she changed her mind.

I decided on White Coffee Bean and Salted Caramel. My sis opted for Chocolate Brownie. 

I will definitely be back. Great customer service, unique flavors (gorgonzola and pear, rice pudding) and something for everyone. They have vegan sorbets as well, which were sweet and fruity.

Anyways, let me start off by saying that I haven't been to a gelato specialty store in ages. Truthfully, gelato has fallen off the trend ladder the past few years for my group. Now we're either getting fryo-yo or shaved ice. Now, don't count me out just yet. I am not biased at all. It's all about the taste to me. 

I had wanted to try Art of Flavors due to all the 5 star reviews. Speaking of which, I feel like I'm going to get jumped after this review HAHA! Anywho, my friends and I finally got to try out this place one Sunday afternoon. We were greeted by the site of a bunch of customers and a friendly face behind the counter. We never got his name but he was really friend. I think he was the husband? 

There were so many interesting flavors that I've never seen as gelato or ice cream. There was sweet corn, pear and gorgonzola, avocado, etc. We even got to try a majority of the flavors and I suppose that's where the magic ended for me. Oh no, it was fabulous and fantastic service that we got to try so many flavors. In fact, the man behind the counter was happy to oblige and started a conversation with us about the flavors. However, it just didn't captivate me. Regardless of all the interesting flavors and mixtures, it didn't get me. Everything tasted too milky and creamy. After every flavor I tried, minus the sorbets, the only thing I uttered after every flavor was ""milk"" ... cause that was all I tasted. There may have been subtle hints of what the gelato SHOULD taste like but not enough to make itself known. 

Was there something wrong with my taste palette? Maybe. You could argue that point I suppose. However, my friends agreed with me. Maybe I'm just used to stronger flavors? Maybe I can't do SUBTLE? Maybe I need it the flavors to PUNCH ME IN THE FACE? I don't' know.

Though I will say, their sorbets are spectacular. The flavors were on point and tasted just like the real fruit. We tried the grapefruit and boy did it have the bitterness of the grapefruit. 

One of my friends and I ended up with a guava sorbet while my other friend got the avocado gelato. We haven't had the chance to try anything other than their gelato but honestly, I'm not too sure if we'll go back. 

A-okay in the end. Worth a try just to see all the different types of flavors.",oqTZC9WriodTCby6jl0LfQ,5,3,3,UUyZsb9R05i6g-XWNfqbAA

We of coursed Yelped this spot since we didn't wanna spend $10 on a teeny scoop of gelato somewhere along the strip.

This place is located in somewhat of a questionable neighborhood. We originally wanted to get some custard across the street from this spot but that place looked janky and scary so we popped over here and thank God we did too!

The owner literally made us try every single flavor before ordering. She explained to us how she makes her gelato flavors fresh every morning and everything is made with natural ingredients. And I believe it! The banana flavor tasted like you were literally eating a spruced up banana. The most interesting flavor I tried was the dark chocolate with hot peppers (you get the kick of spice right down your throat, soooo cool!) I was literally FULL after trying ALL the flavors so I had to go for a mini scoop of the Avocado gelato. And boy was that delish and totally hit the spot!

There's a reason this place has hundreds of reviews and a perfect rating and that reason isn't only the awesome gelato. 

Here are some reasons. 

Desyree (owner and manager) is extremely personable and had me try almost half of the gelato flavors even without me asking as soon as I walked in. Each flavor is distinct, home made by her with fresh ingredients. She was knowledgable about allergies and made sure she knew about them before having us try. 

I'm not usually a sorbet fan but her sorbets tasted amazing as well. Full of flavor and fresh. 

The store itself is located somewhat away from the main hustle and bustle of vegas in a decrepit plaza. The store has a few tables and chairs which serve the purpose well. Clean store and clean restroom. 

She also had a fridge full of weird flavors like indian chicken curry gelato and buffalo chicken with blue cheese gelato. Didn't get to try any of those. 

The gelato itself was creamy and you could tell its fresh and home made. Full of flavor. 

She posts her flavors for the day every day on Instagram too apparently. I like the tech touch. 

All in all the flavor, her passion for what she does and pleasant personality made for a five star experience. Definitely come here.",-RfuGDvWa5ydWpoTD43lpQ,1,1,5,3j8k-z1GOcu2f0q3E3d38g

Went here after dinner on 2/1/14 with Beau S. for two reasons - 1# I noticed Chris R. mentioning or checking in to this place a bunch on Yelp & 2# I saw the article in the Weekly about their ice cream sandwich and figured it would be something Beau would be into.

We sampled a few of the flavors and I agree with another reviewer about the milky flavors. I settled on the small spicy chocolate and Beau got the medium guava sorbet and it came out to a bit over $8. 

They weren't making the sandwiches at the time but maybe I was seeing things when I thought I saw a sign saying ice cream sandwiches were in the $6+ range. Yikes!

I commented to Beau that I wished they had an even smaller size available. While I didn't try it, I couldn't imagine trying 3+ oz of the smoked salmon gelato. My spicy chocolate was good but even 3 oz felt like a lot to me.

I, however, could not justify giving 5 stars to a place located just north of the Stratosphere.  I can't imagine that rent is ""cheap"" in this location, so I fail to see why they stay there?

The location is what's stopped me from going there until now.  After meeting at Novecento (before bingo), everyone decided to head to AoF.  Seemed silly to me to go so far out of the way, only to return to the South Point in an hour - but I was along for the ride.  Plus I was very excited to finally get to try their gelato.

I really don't think that they are marketing towards tourists, so I am so cofused by the location....It's just not convenient to anything, unless I guess you are at OG's in the early evening (not likely).  This place was great, but I just can't see myself going back - I wouldn't go out of my way to deal with lots of traffic. Plus the parking lot is TINY.  Good luck with that.

Double R and Mel let Desy know that it was my 1st time and she proceeded to have me try a TON of the flavors.  I am not a huge sweets person and thought that I would really love the olive oil and rosemary gelato, but it just didnt wow me.  I also tried a couple of the special flavors of the day - chocolate chip cookie dough and strawberry kit kat.  In addition to that, I tried the sweet corn (not corny enough for me) and cinnamon toast crunch (too sweet).

I decided to order a small cup of the strawberry kit kat - mostly because I had tried so many flavors but didn't want to not order.  It was good, but very sweet (I know, this is gelato).  The gelato is well made, but I don't think it is comparable to what you would get in Italy.

Again - don't get me wrong - this place is great.  Desy is super awesome and friendly and the gelato is good.  I thought it was cool that she knows that Mel has a fruit allergy and remembers everyone (you guys go there enough - she should remember you!).  The prices are fanstastic - I think it was $3.25 for a small cup. I can totally understand why people like this place.  We should support local businesses like this one.  Unfortunately, I just don't think I would go out of my way to go there (and I haven't).  The 3 stars are more attributed to me not being a big sweets eater (and not wowed by any of the savory gelatos) and the location.

Today we had the opportunity to go after shopping at the north outlets. I was excited because I knew it was far and in a random area. It's located on the very end of the strip heading into down town. It's a small shop so keep a good eye looking for it!!! I was super excited when we found it. It's pretty small but can fit a good amount of people. 

The moment I walked in, I noticed the colorful display of gelato. The owner was really nice and started us on the gelato tour since we're newbies. It was pretty awesome getting to try all the flavors! They are soooo delicious. I'm a very basic girl, so I didn't know how I would react. Usually it wouldn't be hard for me to decide on what I wanted, but this time it was hard for me to decide!! I ended up going with mixing orange and lemon. Lemon was yummy and sour and the orange leveled it out with a not too sweet taste. My boyfriend got a mix of raspberry and snickers&almond flavor and was in love! His little brother got the cookies and cream which was smooth tasting. And my friend got a mix of three: snickers&almond, chocolate something and chocolate something.....they were just two different chocolates, lol. They all had really cool names and then we saw all the other creative flavors like salmon, to lavender, to creme brÃ»lÃ©e. 

This place is definitely awesome and a MUST go. I'm gonna bring my friends and make sure that this place is well known!

It's a hidden delicacy of Las Vegas.",wxQCLMnuVYbdtmQCc2ryZg,2,2,5,v327SeJVMem3KH3SJ95Kig
5914013,2014-06-01,1,O7UMzd3i-Zk8dMeyY9ZwoA,"Owner and gelato chef Desyree gave us as many samples as we asked for- which is great because we wanted to try everything, from the jelly doughnut gelato to the strawberry margarita sorbet. Hardest decision was to decide on what to order for our cones. 

You can preview some of the flavor sub the freezer. Wish we could be here for Lucky Charms or peanut butter jelly and banana gelato. 

Area seems a little sketch but this shop and it's goods are delicious enough to be in any of the huge casinos on the strip. I hope she'll still be here on our next visit.",CBD7ozxeyh9wX4kCbpP3-g,0,1,5,w9cMoUQGEnor1DWfVaybjA

You can order one flavor, two Flavors or three Flavors, the dish size is bigger for the number of flavors but I'm pretty sure you can double or triple dip one flavor. 
Desyree welcomed us to her store and introduced herself! It was very refreshing for an owner to want to meet you! 

Knowing this place is 10mins from my work, is dangerous. I'll be back!",9z3W4AzWHFv_Ba5qE26WQw,10,8,5,PTDjY2d-IyiIUXcMcsT6GQ
5918667,2013-10-23,8,O7UMzd3i-Zk8dMeyY9ZwoA,"I don't make it out to this seemingly shadier part of town very often.  It is after all near the intersection of OG, a bail bond business and an alternative fashion shop (where I visited to offer my second opinion while stripper girlfriends do their shopping).  But I am glad I came.

Art of Flavors definitely lived up to the high praises offered up thus far by the Yelp community.  Their selection of gelato is sizable, even compared to other much better financed operations up and down the Strip.  The thought process that goes into developing and making each flavor is something you can taste in the final product behind the display case.  Chef Desyree is very passionate about her products, and is more than happy to let customers sample the gelatos that are available.  Feel free to ask her questions, because she will be happy to tell you about her gelato and how they are made, the inspiration for making it.  The foodie in you will totally dig it!

Besides the really good gelato, they have Gelato Panini on the menu.  That is something I have not seen anywhere else and have yet to try it.  It is probably the same concept as a tempura ice cream, where the batter and cake layer shields the ice cream from melting during the frying process.

The hot chocolate is also very good.  The flavor is definitely not water down, and very good once the weather cools down in the coming weeks.

Stop by and give the gelato a try. You will leave happier than you came in.

*Amanda M just mentioned a super great idea via Yelp compliments. Making a Honey Toast Gelato Panini.  In Asia, giant honey toasts are already served with gelato orice cream, with other fancy decorations (chocolate cigarettes, macrons, square decorations), so it would just be an easy adaptation of what millions have already tried.  Probability of success: High!

**New flavors are regularly added, so come back again and again for new flavor surprises.

They have so many crazy food flavors that I've never seen before like sweet corn and gorgonzola cheese.  Who would have thought that that would even be worth eating but it is awesome.  The lady who was working the counter who I think is also the owner gave us a ton of samples and we weren't even asking for them.  I went with the passion fruit because I was looking for something sweet and tropical that evening.  It was great,.  Fantastic place and I would love to head back here for sure!",gijqnKe5syCZj7al4kgxFQ,4,4,5,qpIiFQUxDaG6onBrSfXUBQ

I had seen all the 5 star reviews but never felt the need to come here until after the taco trek and if I had on a pair of socks they would've been blown off. 
The staff was extremely nice and courteous despite how many of us were there. They let everybody sample and described everything as much as was needed
The gelato itself was amazing. Good consistency and a multitude of Flavors. I originally started off with a double scoop of mango and strawberry. It wasn't bad, but after consulting with my fellow yelpers I had to sneak back for round 2. That ended up being the extremely strange sounding but super delicious combo of pistachio and blue cheese. Didn't expect to love it as much as I did but I have no complaints. 
Overall it was a great experience and I'm sure I'll be checking them out when the weather gets really warm",KyMkKb5IohKb0S7v4Jv-oA,8,7,5,u_Zqb3ScV-KftdV6uuJvHw

I am one of the annoying customers that try atleast 3 or 4 flavors. It's a good thing that the workers there are so nice to have patience with me haha. I swear that all of the flavors they have are so good. I would go here everyday to check out what new flavor they have. 

All their fruit flavored gelatos taste so fresh. It's perfect for the summer heat. My bf ' s favorite is the mango because it has real bits of mango in it. One of my favorites is the white coffee bean ice cream, it's so creamy. There were a few other flavors I liked but I forgot their names.

Overall, they have an awesome selection and they have a flavor for everyone.",ZsjuEgOdvx9l5GKZdtwYIw,4,6,5,56a0bV-9XyoI52kH_LRr6w

The gelato is amazing. When trying to decide on a flavor you can't resist trying as many of the offerings as possible. They're irresistable. I have to admit I prefer some of the more unusual flavors, so that's a huge selling point to me.

I'm disappointed in myself for taking as long as I did to give them a chance. I'll be back, and often. Luckily they also offer AOF at Novecento across town if I need to get my fix.I love it when local restaurants work together.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,5,6,5,cFkBzNnsJQf0G3HKZ-C9Og
5962742,2014-09-12,3,O7UMzd3i-Zk8dMeyY9ZwoA,"My 1300th Yelp Review!

Art of Flavors in Las Vegas is my favorite gelato place not only in Vegas, but in the entire United States of America as well.

I had them bookmarked for awhile, and I was finally able to try them during our most recent visit to Sin City.  We liked them so much, we went here all 3 days of our trip!

The owner, Desyree, is a creative culinary gelato genius!!  She comes up with such amazing flavor combinations!  She even makes savory gelato flavors.  Unfortunately, those flavors are not available everyday.

Each time we went, we sampled various flavors that were available during that time.  Not all flavors are available each day or even later in the day.  We always ended up buying 3 scoops each time.

Here is a list of the flavors that we have tried so far:

Orange Cream, 
Cinnamon Roll
Blueberries
Mango
Rocky Road
Parmesan Cheese
Rosemary and Olive Oil
Strawberries and Cream
Pistachio
This is Bad For You
White Chocolate Pomegranate Kit Kat
Caramel Cookie Butter Macadamia
Snowball with Chocolate cake

All of these flavors have tasted anywhere from Very Good (4.5 stars) to Beyond Words Incredible (5+ stars)!!!  I still need to try the Fried Chicken & Waffles and the Steak & Eggs!

Currently, ""This Is Bad For You"" is my favorite gelato flavor here!  

Art of Flavors is located in the same strip mall as Viva Las Arepas.  Not the best area of Las Vegas.  Do Not let that stop you from coming here!

I have a suggestion, Please expand your place!!   More display cases are needed to showcase all your fantastic flavors!!  Of course, that would require a lot more space because Desyree has created over 500 amazing flavors so far!

You can always find out what flavors they have that day by following Art of Flavors on Twitter.  

I look forward to returning to Art of Flavors on all our future trips to Vegas!  Wish we could go here everyday because she always has something new, delicious, and inventive to try!!  

Not enough adjectives to describe how awesome Art of Flavors is!!  Just try them, you won't regret it!",whINg-cC-FiAv_ATDGMDTg,7,5,5,kvHrJENR_CY_vlnXigYLxQ
