384684,2017-02-21,0,EVYGEs6vJwUPvapGPrKvfA,Pretty much the service and quality you can expect from any fast food place. I got the sourdough jack combo with curly fries and a Diet Coke. The sourdough jack was good though it had too much mayo and by the end was just a mess. The curly fries were the freshest I had from this location so far. It's 3pm so maybe they don't have a lot of fries sitting out or I just got lucky. Drink was great with not too much ice. Overall a solid experience this time around.,40V_mrP1nOcGVnh6VoVKmA,0,0,3,KkUCvTKKyjHzQeNmolBEnw

My search for cheap and quick food sometimes leads me to dark places (which sometimes means a bathroom at night with stomach pains). The tacos and burgers really should be put on some sort of WHO (World Health Organization) watch list. They can truly be brutal on the gastrointestinal system. And oh yeah, they aren't even slightly tasty or even decent. But they do have jalapeno poppers. These are the one, sole thing that keeps JIB from being 1 star. I am ok with their jalapeno poppers.

Whenever I travel I look for this fast food restaurant because I love their two for a dollar tacos. I know they are extremely unhealthy and greasy but those little bastards are delicious!!! This time I also had an ultimate bacon cheeseburger and I really liked it. We also tried the chicken sandwich it was okay. We added some ranch and that flavored it right on up! 

The service is extremely slow and the staff seems a bit young to be honest. The soda is flat tasting and the store itself was not the cleanliest. But like I said I love this fast food place and I will be returning a few more times before I leave",na0NNjtOBKYYj1G-u39I2w,0,0,4,pZhAs481ya_HHhU4MsYSXg

The food that we ordered was absolutely amazing and was made to the way that everyone likes. The ten tacos that we ordered were no lettuce and they were all made fresh too.
