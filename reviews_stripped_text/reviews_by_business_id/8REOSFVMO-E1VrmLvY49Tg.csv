1384724,2017-08-18,0,8REOSFVMO-E1VrmLvY49Tg,"I felt robbed...absoluately robbed.

The guy offered me two sizes, regular and large. I chose the regular, which seemed quite large for a single serving, about a pint sized styrofoam container. I asked to taste the ""Fresh Strawberry"", I was not impressed at all. Did not taste like fresh strawberries, it was that artificially sweetened, artifically dyed, strawberry taste. For ""Home-made"" ice cream and ""slow churned flavor"" it was mediocre at best.

 I decided to get the ice cream anyways, giving him the benefit of the doubt that it would be worth it. He gives me my ice cream, which wasnt quite filled to the top and I coud fill pockets of air at the bottom. Here's the best part: $10! TEN muthaf***in DOLLARS! I decided to just do it, support a small local business, yada yada yada. Once I get the ice cream he tells me he said they had smaller sizes too, $5 for a small serving. Coulda offered me that first!!

1893092,2016-08-14,4,8REOSFVMO-E1VrmLvY49Tg,"This seasonal food truck is only available in the summer months- it seems to pop up around June and stick around til the end of August or September. Never made it by last year as they were gone by the time I finally got around to visiting.

The truck is nicely decorated with the available flavors and cone/cup sizes on display. Definitely get the coconut, it was super-creamy with little bits of shredded coconut flakes for texture. The mint chip was just okay, had an artificial taste to it but they did have large pieces of chocolate candy on top. 

Portion sizes are huge. Prices seemed fair for the portion but I didn't see posted pricing- I just know that my small was a flat $5, which may get steep if you bring a family. Service was quick and to the point, not particularly personable.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,14,12,3,AQ1zDC85IggSQl41i7cJyw
2263281,2015-08-28,7,8REOSFVMO-E1VrmLvY49Tg,"This is not your average ice cream novelty truck. The trailer is very generic in appearance with a boring name that would fit right in at the food court of a county fair. The old-fashioned ice cream maker on display convinced me to check out the variety of frozen desserts being produced in the Snackers parking lot. The gears are moving complete with cartoonish sound effects, but it's just for show. The ice cream is actually made in a different facility for obvious reasons. 

You'll find about a dozen classic ice cream flavors available in your choice of a cup or cone, including vanilla, chocolate, strawberry, pistachio, mint chip, and other standards. I'm unsure of exact prices, but I paid $7 for a kid's cup and a small cup, so I think it's reasonable for a home-made/handmade product. The rocky road featured a chocolate base with pieces of almonds, chocolate chips, and marshmallows (store-bought), but my daughter's cookies and cream won the flavor test. Both were a bit sweet for my palate and I'd be happy with a kids size serving. The texture was great! It was soft like it had been churned recently, and very creamy without ice crystals. It also seemed to have less air incorporated than your average gas station Thrifty or Breyer's. I'm describing gelato. Maybe it was frozen custard.

Stop by for a taste of home-made nostalgia! I don't know hours of operation or any other information on this business because I can't locate it on social media, but I can confirm that they were open around 5pm on Thursday.  The location is convenient to Chinatown and The Strip. There is one parking space reserved for ice cream customers just to the right of the truck.",PSI7wvuqEhhV9Jh_fP2eZQ,13,7,3,pp5gPKNMMIzaEKMKb_7Erg
2319287,2018-01-21,0,8REOSFVMO-E1VrmLvY49Tg,Ice cream is ok.   To Pricey.  Bought two cones and was charged $20.00 for a cone and ONE SCOOP!  First and most likely our last time.  There are other places with great flavors and very reasonable prices.,zGHuQJjzDOy2iz5ZJwWfCg,0,0,3,M2hQtEA6us3euOudiWdOSQ

3166999,2017-07-12,0,8REOSFVMO-E1VrmLvY49Tg,"I should have known something was up when I was the only customer on a 100+ day. I was offered a sample and I gave it to my mom. She didn't say anything so I ordered two small cups. Big mistake. I should have ordered only one small with two flavors. 

The ice cream was really bland. It didn't have that good creamy flavor that most homemade flavors have...the flavor that you get when you use real eggs and whole milk. It was bland and not sweet at all. I would have done better going to Von's because Haagen Daz has an excellent vanilla that is made with simple ingredients and tastes 10 times better than this. I'm all for supporting small businesses but the ice cream should at least be as good as what I can buy at the grocery store.

3258937,2017-09-14,1,8REOSFVMO-E1VrmLvY49Tg,"I've came to this place many times and have ordered a single scoop in a cone or cup. This time I get there and I ask for a scoop on a cone. the guy tells me ""do you want it in a cup"" I said, no a cone. He than says ""we can put it in a cup and cone on top. I was thinking maybe he thinks I'm hitting the road and it'll help the ice creme the spill or whatever. For some reason he waves  a extra large container and a med sized one and says which one. I pointed at the small one thinking it's a waste to take the big one for just a scoop. Case and point. I paid 20 dollars for ice creme, the guy filled up that med sized container and slapped an empty cone on top. He hustled me to make an extra buck. He knew dang well I wanted a single scoop and he tricked me to having the bigger size. No wonder he didn't have his prices up that day, I wonder who else he did it to.  Never , ever coming back.",Ufbk-jgQ2nqEt0fgnPZp6g,0,0,1,XvX-S4EXne02Hgu9ZeRxTg
3476221,2016-09-16,0,8REOSFVMO-E1VrmLvY49Tg,"Best ice cream I've ever had. The mango is really amazing. Not too milky...really quenches the heat on a hot summer day. The place is a trailer outside a gas station - Sinclair. No parking really except at the gas station pumps and a couple other spots, and it's a busy intersection. So not the place to sit and chill - it's grab n go. But taste quality, is exceptional. I read a review saying you're closed for the winter! When exactly are you closed?",6xwllrTlBEJOGBjdW-MMig,0,1,5,DCX_1QFmgrYqNx1MogGJXA
3974388,2017-06-13,5,8REOSFVMO-E1VrmLvY49Tg,"After my dinner at a nearby Chinese restaurant, I checked Yelp for nearby ice cream shops and I chose this place.  I have driven by it numerous times, I probably have noticed it, but it never clicked in my head to stop.  This small trailer is in the corner of the convenience mart at the southwest corner of DI and Valley View.  There is little parking near the trailer itself, so I parked along the north side of the mart.

I walked over and looked at the flavors and the man showed me two sizes of cups.  You could have up to three flavors in the smaller size I chose which had to be equivalent to a pint.  I chose coconut and banana.  There was a $2 off Yelp check in offer which the man was surprised was still available on Yelp but he honored it making my ice cream $8.  That's pricey for a pint but it is quality, locally made ice cream.  The ice cream maker on display moves and it looks like ice cream is being frozen but it isn't making ice cream.  The gentleman told me the health department won't allow that to make ice cream but they have two others off site where the ice cream is made.

I took my cup back to my car and enjoyed the ice cream.  Both flavors were very good with rich flavor.  I won't be stopping here often as I'm usually going by to get to some place I need to be.  I also am not a fan of eating in my car.  I like sit down places more, but this is good stuff!",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,10,10,4,j1RgF2drUuVTuV9G_M_0bQ
