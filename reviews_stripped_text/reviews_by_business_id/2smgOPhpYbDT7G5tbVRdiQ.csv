The girl working told me to pull forward and wait. I sat behind 3 other vehicles for almost 15 minutes while she cooked cheeseburgers. Absolutely horrendous and I would never suggest you go to this location for any reason.",aE25emIhbyRNsG_OJpcgCQ,0,0,1,xtv_tvDueRRY3EoYwUacRw

So I proceeded to the window... Again- no one came to the window for an additional 5 minutes I waited there so I left. The ONE time I did receive my food the fries were old, cold, and soggy. Less than impressed! I'm aware it's a chain fast food place and not to expect greatness but cmon....

I usually don't post reviews about fast food restaurants because they are fast food restaurants, I get that and don't expect much from them but this place is horrible!   I've been there a few times, it's always been slower than other places.  I decided to stop by yesterday afternoon, about 1 pm, they have two drive thru lanes, I pulled into the first one there was one car in front of me and another in the other lane ahead of me.  It took them forever to take the order of the car in lane next to me, then the car in front of me.  I wait, nobody takes my order, I'm speaking into the speaker but no answer.  Then a car pulls up in the lane next to me and they friggin take his order!  I'm pissed off now, and of course there is now a car behind me so I can't back out.  I'm still talking into the speaker but nothing.  Then another car pulls up in the lane next to me and they begin taking her order!!   I get out of my car, walk up to the window and start going off.  I placed my order there but when I got back into my car I decided I probably shouldn't eat there, remembered the movie ""Waiting"", if you haven't seen it, check it out, it will change how you deal with restaurants.  So I get to the window, give them another piece of my mind and leave, they claimed they were having some issue with their ""system"", whatever that means.  Never going there again.

All around horrible service. They got our order wrong twice and never even apologize for it. Bad customer service is becoming the norm. What would happen if someone put the customer first and provided an outstanding experience all of the time? They would get my business I can tell you that.

I say unless your going through the drive threw stay clear of this location .

This is the only fast food I eat (at least try) because the standarts are usually higher....
Then the credit machine didn't print out my slip and the overall look and feel was pretty bad.
A customer near me just complained on the taste.....
Good thing I have a strong stomach,  so I'm ready for  an adventure. ...

The guy working the register needs some serious training. As I approached the counter to place my order (no one else was waiting in line) this guy is just staring into space with his mind on how many holes are in the ceiling tile. I then see him notice me looking at him and still nothing. No greeting of any kind. So I stand there and stare back. Still nothing. This staring contest goes on for about 2 minutes before he fumbles out, ""Can I help you?"" to which I reply ""There you go buddy! I knew you could do it!"" He then says ""Do what?"" I finally say ""Just take my order please!"" Never have I seen someone so clueless. Maybe he should just go count salt and pepper packets to keep the mouse running in his head.",kJOkmWQoL0Jy8iTea_V6og,0,0,1,jpzuCxVwVpDfmsIfzcwi5A

Which means I will be be an avid visitor of Burger King while they last. I remember I was a sad panda a few years ago when they took them off the menu.

There is just something about the ooey gooey cheesy inside, and the crunchy exterior.

Also, if you didn't know Burger King has a buy one whopper, get one for $0.55 in celebration of thier anniversary. When it comes to fast food chains, I am a whopper kind of girl. The ""flame broiled"" taste wins me over every time.

This location is typically fast and very accomodating. 
Due to the location you will see plenty of hookers, homeless and panhandlers outside the parking lot. Don't be surprised.",U0WU9d6gpMNkO_tPXK58Sg,0,0,3,9rCQt4_TEez5loQh6IMgaA
