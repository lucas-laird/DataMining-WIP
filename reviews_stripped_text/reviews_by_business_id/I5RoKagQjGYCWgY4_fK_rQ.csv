The service was quick and the pizza also came out quickly. The crust was a little bit thinner than Carmine's pizzas. The pizza was very good. I'll be going back for another. I have two complaints. The first is that the Iced Tea was not fresh. The other complaint is that the internet on my I phone did not work inside the restaurant despite showing 3 of 4 bars. It almost seems like the internet is purposely blocked inside. However, if you walk outside it works fine. The waitress tried to give me the password, however it must have been changed. She was not sure if it had been changed since it was Carmine's.",xOjtlIjWS0djtoYhjBDgxA,0,0,4,ccfKCrv6rAcwkIznceWcNw

The pizza was good. We used to go to Broadway on Sahara and Centennial until they bugged out. I would say both places are comparable as far a quality, but the pizza a Russo's was missing that slight herbal overtone that Broadway had. Also, they really wusseed out on the pep.

went with the two slice and soda lunch special - $5 ( if cheese only ; 50 cent /slice add on for toppings ) 

Also ordered spaghetti and meatballs for dinner later.($12)

The pizza was decent - crunchy exterior, yet light/pillowy inside.  sauce had decent seasoning.  toppings were average ( peperoni and sausage ) 

The spaghetti and meatballs.  I thought the meatballs were alright but the sauce - sub par - had a strong vinegar taste and watery - I can't stand it when the sauce is added to water logged pasta - a problem I encounter at a lot of mom/pop places.  a simple test to see if this occurs to you - when you get the plate/bowl of pasta, use either the fork or a piece of bread to support the pasta and tilt the plate/bowl slightly to one side - if you see watery sauce dripping or worse, streaming through, the cook did a poor job draining the pasta - the best option for a cook ( if available ) is putting the pasta and sauce in a sauté pan to cook out any excess water, then serve.

If I visit in the future - pizza only

We started with the pasta fagoli. It was excellent. The taste perfect. A spot on taste of how it is meant to be. 
I had the chicken parminga with a side of spaghetti. I was so impressed with the sauce. I am a snob when it comes to Marina sauce. This is delicious. As good as mother made. The chicken was good I liked the flavor I just wish it was a Little thinner cutlet. That is just my preference. 
DH had the linguine with clams. Two dozen clams adorned the linguine. It was a huge portion cooked just right. 
Then the bread, perfectly crunchy, crusty Italian bread. Real butter. 
No room for dessert. Took home leftovers.

I have never had such BAD food in my life. I called back and politely informed the girl that it was so bad it made me sick and she apologized and said her manager would call me when he comes back in 2 days. I just received a call from him and he was immediately defensive. He called ONLY to inform me that the pizza couldn't have possibly made me sick! That I must have a virus! I told him NO... I am fine! The pizza was so disgusting I threw it up! And YES that CAN happen! Does he think he's a Doctor? He was completely unprofessional! I almost would've preferred he never called me back then call me back just to argue and be a cry baby about his pizza being disgusting! What a child! I will forever warn people now about not only the crappy food here but the rude and unprofessional manager!,4FDYldBOgvoxhbjdExzuLQ,3,1,1,DzHp_izSrqxVmtkBO7p7XA

Hubby and I had a super craving of cheese pizza and I demanded to try a new place :) 
This place is super small and we managed to grab the last table to dine in. 
Prompt we received menus and the young lady took our drink order.
This place is family owned. Two daughters are the wait staff and their father and some other gentlemen are manning the kitchen.
We ordered two glasses of red wine and two waters. We ordered a greek salad, garlic bread and a large cheese pizza.

Very soon we had our salad. It had cubed fresh lettuce, tomatoes, cucumbers, pepperoncini, fresh cut cubed feta cheese, kalamata olives, and oil and vinegar. The dressing had a kick to it. Almost a spicy...but not. I still can not figure out what it was but WOW it was good.
Shortly after our bread came and I'm totally not a bread person and I tried it and it was soooooooo good! Crispy but not too hard with lots of garlic butter with no garlic chunks.

I was looking around and noticed the owner rolling the dough and tossing it a little. Sooo awesome! Fresh and super fresh.

So perfect timing later here comes our pizza WWOWWOWWWWWW! See the pictures that I took. Wow what a beauty! Finally someplace that makes a almost perfect NY slice. Huge pieces. Perfect flavor. Be careful when you shake the pepper flakes. I love them and usually pile them on. For some reason theirs are SUPER hot lol! My mouth swelled up a little because I piled on the normal amount of pepper that I usually eat. Still yummmmy! 

I just really can not wait to discover some of their pasta dishes like the Linguine with Tomato and Basil. 

I can't wait to go back! Tooooo bad they are not open later than they are. 9pm seems early to me but that's ok :) Looks like on their website http://www.russospizzakitchenlasvegas.com/ they are listing different specials. Yum yummy.",zgV0ZroIF956gw4cul8MHA,6,5,5,KSsc3oOp_RcIHMKdLrJZIA

I didn't want to waste the rest after eating all the clams so I just used some bread,soaked it in and ate it. The chicken fingers were perfect, not too bready. I'll tell you what sticks out and you would think an Italian Kitchen doesn't have it. But their cheesecake is absolute bomb. It was the perfect texture.

The Greek salad has scant non-lettuce ingredients and no protein for $10 but an incredible dressing- it's called a house italian, but it's a creamy version that tastes like a really good Caesar. 

Another table got a $16 steamed mussels special that looked to be a small portion, but the great garlic fragrance was enough to make me rethink my selections. Overall I feel like it's a bit overpriced for what you get.

The space is small, walk-up style but dining in is nicer than you'd think- there's also a large TV tuned to sports above the counter and individual flat screen TVs at some of the booths.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,11,7,3,Cn_UobDbVD9RvHdZNar4LA

Walked in for lunch with a friend... very homely feeling.  We decided to share the calamari and lasagna.   The calamari was excellent; not heavily-breaded, light and not too salty!  The lasagna was very cheesy and perfectly cooked and was a great portion.  If I could cook lasagna at home, it's how I would want mine to taste.  I really liked the atmosphere and there are little TVs at each table... good for those solo-lunchers who might want to catch the local news or catch up on sports scores during their lunch break.  You can also order pizza by the slice, which is super convenient for quick lunch pickups. 

The second time I ordered for delivery, we had the calamari and a small pepperoni mushroom pizza.  Again the calamari was on point, and the pizza was what I expected... wonderfully cheesy and flavorful.

I really love to support family businesses, and this one did not disappoint!  Feels like Italian home cooking, and I'm looking forward to trying more of their menu items!",wqhuRhMwwlbuqW9xa1li8A,1,0,4,5s9W5Ch3crmOtaUIV4dcYg

I always wanted check out Russo since close to the house. Each time I make Presto Cafe run next door just reminder need check it out. I cam on Saturday night. I was surprise see the place jammed packed. The most part it seems like the place never fills out. On this night lucked out because scored the only table that was available. They do takeout so if worst came to worst could have done it. Thankfully I was able too enjoy my pasta fresh hot from kitchen straight to my table. 

I settled on ""Our Signature Penne Pasta"". I thought was pretty good. The Pink Vodka Sauce. Basically tomato cream sauce had nice balance between the two. Still had hint of Vodka. The italian sausage, peas, and onion was the perfect compliment. Peas tomato and cream beautiful thing by itself. The penne pasta was cooked spot on al dente. The portion size is no joke. It came in nice size bowl might not be deep bowl but nice and wide round dish filled with pasta. Thankfully was looking too carb load so could finish it all. All the pastas (I notice other customers portions) you could eat half now and rest later or leftovers. The price is really reasonable not saying cheap but not high end price would pay on the strip price. The bread that comes with your meal not bad. I wish the butter would have been softer. 

The whole menu most part is your standard italian dishes. They also offer catering options. Deliveries.

The service was good. I know the only had one server and the place was packed. I just went up to the counter ordered then sat down. The only thing with service went to refill my own drink. It was busy but found it interesting other tables waitress was refilling their drinks. 

I atmosphere like that old school italian small family run business. The owner is very much on it from taking orderers, greeting people come in and out, and even helping bussing tables since busy had other customers waiting. Russo bringing food out in the restaurant. The whole table cloth the red and white checker board style. All the italian artwork mostly of food. If that not interesting can always check out sports on television. The table along the wall each one has it own television. I notice remote on each one. Not sure if allowed change them or not.

It was delivered to my home, I immediately cut it open,  and it was not only basically empty,  but actually COLD inside. I live 2 minutes from this place,  nothing should every be cold when it gets here.
I called to complain, and the manager actually argued with me about whether or not the food was cold!
I demanded my money be refunded, and told him he could have the driver pick it back up. He said no, keep it. Thankfully agreed to return my money, but the only place that calzone is going is into the garbage.
This owner took a thriving friendly neighborhood business and destroyed it. What is worse, is they use crap ingredients,  serve a crap product, and still charge a premium price, and use the name of the former owner.

I had gone to this place years ago when it had a different name, so I expect something different. Nope same owner different name same rip off prices. The pizza is all soggy and no taste to it, I really hate to leave bad reviews but I had to do it. 60 dollars for a family of 6 with just a plain cheese at 3.00 a drink and wings plus tip included in that. The pizza was just terrible for the price, I could of gone to metro and got 2 good pizzas for the same price and with beer not watered down fountain drinks. So I was upset about that, but then the owners entire family and I mean daughter cousins sisters husbands kids come in and hang out. So I notice this is where the inflation comes from, because when you pay to eat you pay for his entire blood line to eat for free. Not including handouts he passes from the cash register to his family members as you can tell is was not for the business profit. So this explains it all, on the note I feel bad for the owner which is probably the pizza guy who looks overworked.

 the White Pizza ( mozzarella, ricotta, and parmesan cheeses with fresh sautéed spinach and garlic).  It looked very appetizing but to me it had no distinctive flavor and seemed bland.  The crust was nice.

Fresh Tomato, Basil and Garlic  Pizza  (Fresh sliced Roma tomatoes, mozzarella cheese, fresh garlic and basil, topped with parmesan cheese).  Once again, the presentation was great but it was also on the bland side.  The crust was good.

Eggplant Parmigiana Dinner- (Layered eggplant with mozzarella cheese and tomato sauce).  It also came with a generous portion  of Fettuccine Alfredo (although there were other choices) and hot Italian bread.  The alfredo sauce had a weird (not bad-just weird) aroma but it was tasty.  

My husband liked the alfredo & Eggplant Parm much better then the pizza. He thought the pizza was good but nowhere near Amore's (his fave).

First of all, not many people call with a menu in front of them. Secondly, it was a simple question. So I told him my employee had it on her phone , but for the sake of getting back out on my sales floor, I just asked quickly and as to the size of the salad. 

At this point I'm annoyed because I told him I apologize, which why do I even need to 've sorry for asking questions, but I did tell him I was trying to handle my customers and this order. To this he replied, ""Welcome to my world."" Then he handed the phone back to the girl who originally answered the phone and hung up on us the first time we called. 

My employees told me to cancel the order after getting the total of $49 and being treated like a burden. I told them I will give this place the benefit of the doubt if the pizza is good.

I love the feel of Russo's. It is a family run restaurant that treats their customers like friends. It had been at least 8 months since my last visit, and I genuinely thought the staff remembered me. That is always a nice feeling. 

On this trip, I went with my usual, fettuccine alfredo and a side salad. I love the side salad. First, its massive and easy to share. Second, the ranch is incredible. I don't know if they make their own ranch, but if not, I'd buy this stuff by the bucket. I also got garlic cheese bread which is always a winner. 

I am glad I ate here for lunch though, because of my lack of excess carb intake, I was ready to sleep by 3pm. It made me remember why I don't eat here very often, but not because of the food or the service. I just can't get away with falling asleep at 3pm.

5096560,2012-07-15,0,I5RoKagQjGYCWgY4_fK_rQ,"My fiancé INSISTED that I give Russo's a five-star rating.  Since he favors himself a ""pizza connoisseur,"" my fiancé has dragged me to every pizza joint in the city.  Therefore, when he proclaims that something is worthy of five stars, I listen.  In this case, I also completely agree.  I'll freely admit that I was pretty ho-hum when he told me he had a ""bitchin' new pizza place"" for us to try tonight, as that usually means that I'm going to be subjected to some cold, limp, mall-quality pizza in the back of some building in an abandoned alley.  The boy lacks discretion sometimes - he'd eat a flat tire if someone put pizza sauce on it.  However, my hasty judgment (in this case anyway) was a bit premature. 

Russo's is cute, complete with checkered vinyl tablecloths and a TV at every table.  Yep, I said it.  A separate TV at every table.  If you ask, they'll give you the remote so you can change the channels yourself.  Awesome.  We were greeted quickly by a friendly young waitress who remained attentive and helpful throughout the meal.

We ordered a pizza with sausage, pepperoni, jalapeño, olive, and tomatoes.  I had a side salad with ranch as well.  The side salad was crisp and cool with thin (yet creamy) ranch.  It was a decent size for the $3 (or so) I paid.  When the pizza came out, I thought we could finish the whole thing in one sitting.  I mean, it was plenty big (we got the largest size), but I know my fiancé's capacity to wolf down pizza is almost unmatched.  Boy, was I wrong.

The crust has a light, crispy texture that stands up well to the weight of the toppings.  Although it gives the appearance that one could eat massive quantities, it's actually very filling.  The toppings were very generous as well.  The real highlight was the sliced (not crumbled) sausage.  The taste was reminiscent of Secret Pizza in the Cosmopolitan, one of my favorite pizza places in town.  However, it was refreshing finding the same high-quality pizza without having to deal with the hustle and bustle of the Strip.

I was full after a single slice, so that left a good portion of the pie to bring home (even after my fiancé decided to unbutton his pants to make room for more... that's his sign that a pizza is good!).  It's sitting in our fridge right now, just begging to become a midnight snack.  For the price we paid I feel we got a good value, especially when you factor in the leftovers.  I really don't know why one would feel it necessary to go to Pizza Hut or Domino's when there are high-quality, affordable, family-owned pizza places like this in the Valley.  Good job, Russo's.",3rsZCoTmr8EM7DwtGm_RsQ,0,0,5,aEnkn-lE4qPPP-PrE8ls-Q

5279468,2018-01-14,3,I5RoKagQjGYCWgY4_fK_rQ,"Planting its stakes on South Rainbow Boulevard long before the street's recent rejuvenation as a dining corridor, the switch from Carmine's Pizza Kitchen to Russo's occurring somewhere around the start of this decade, it was after passing by the space several times that the decision was finally made to stop in for lunch on Friday, a recent change in ownership par for the course in a shopping complex that formerly housed Elements and launched four new Restaurants including Meraki in the last twelve months.

Best described as a New York Pizzeria, the checkered tablecloths, decorations including Grapes as well as oil paintings and Rat Pack soundtrack all creating the stereotyped environment of a place in Little Italy, guests entering Russo's Pizza Kitchen will quickly be struck by the space's intimate confines, a total of less than a dozen tables spread out in front of an open window and multi-tiered oven.

Unaware of the ownership change until afterwards, a look at the business' Social Media including a post in October stating ""Dear Friends, I am no longer at Russo's Pizza Kitchen due to unforeseen circumstances that were out of my control.  Sincerely, The Russo Family,"" it was shortly after seating that a youthful female waitress approached the table with menu and a glass of Ice Water, an order previously arranged based on the website's menu quickly derailed by the absence of Garlic Knots which led to a quick adjustment with some for now and the rest for later.

Allowing approximately 55 minutes for lunch exclusive of driving time, presumably plenty for a quick-service Restaurant with less than a ten total diners present and limited take-out or delivery volume as judged by the driver only leaving once with just two boxes, it was shortly after the order was placed that two Meatballs swimming in thin Marinara were delivered, the grind good and noticeably including Cheese at a good portion for just $3.95 though it would have admittedly been nice to have a slice of Bread or some Knots for dipping.

Taking an inordinate amount of time to warm two previously made slices, the cause for this audibly heard to be a mistake as the young waitress twice had to tell a white haired man behind the counter ""One Cheese, one Pepperoni,"" as she offered an extra slice of the latter to a regular guest gratis, it was nearly twenty minutes after seating that the $4.95 lunch combo arrive, the free Drink passed up as nothing in the aged Coke machine sounded appealing while the slices were warm and decent, though the Cheese was a bit too oily and clearly not high grade as judged by its consistency. 

Eating the two slices fairly quickly, the serving temperature not so hot as to require any sort of cooling to avoid burning one's mouth even though the thin crust did pick up a light bit of char, it was nearly ten minutes later that the waitress stated ""Zeppoli will be ready in just a few minutes,"" an actual total of seven seeing several varying sizes of fried Dough presented beneath a pile of powdered sugar with two bottled Sauces, the larger pieces nice and fluffy but the smaller ones  bit too chewy and neither the portion nor the quality worth $8.95.

At this point pressed for time, the rest of the order ready and waiting, it was approaching the counter with a coupon that the situation suddenly turned from average to subpar, the waitress unaware of how to enter the order appropriately and thus provoking a lengthy call to an off-site owner who would not give her a password to adjust the price for unknown reasons, the Credit Card eventually dialed in by one of those old-school scanners (that the server dropped onto an exposed Pizza) and to-go items handed over, the luke-warm Calzone decent but compromised by watery Ham slices that made the Ricotta runny and messy while the Cheesecake actually turned out to be a highlight, the use of a bit of Gelatin rendering the texture smooth and creamy while sweetness was graciously restrained. 

**1/2  Uncertain regarding the quality previously, though it would seem likely that service and billing issues were better under prior ownership, Russo's Pizza Kitchen is a decent choice for those in the area, though considering the diversity of Las Vegas' Pizza scene in general there are plenty of better options both nearby and  throughout town.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,10,3,2,wlqfwUtuh2zSnOxpUnEjUQ

Second order (September 2013): We had last minute guests coming over to watch the Sunday afternoon football games.  Since this is the closest pizza to my house, I gave it another shot and ordered a large sausage mushroom for pickup.  This pizza was actually pretty great.  Even our guests thought so and I was pleasantly surprised.  I couldn't believe this was the same place to be honest.  

Third order (November 2013): An old buddy living in Boston was raving about chicken parm sandwiches around the Fenway area.

I called to inform them of this and the cashier simply just said ""Sorry.""  The owner called me 3 minutes later to apologize again.  He said there was something wrong with his fridge, everything froze over and blamed his cook for not noticing.

Family owned, and with New York origins, this place was super cute, super clean, super delicious and super fresh. We ordered the Greek salad which was very fresh and crisp, the calamari which was so light and fresh and just downright delicious, the bucket of chicken wings (which did not come in a bucket but were instead served in a nicer oblong plate with the creamiest ranch dressing on the side) and the Russo's supreme pizza to which we added olives, ham, and jalapenos for a dollar each. All our appetizers were so light and fresh, that it really made the difference while we waited for our pizza. Usually appetizers will sit heavy and then by the time your entree comes, you don't really have room for more food, but not here, and I really think it's due to the way the food was prepared. Just as you would expect from a small, authentic, family-owned restaurant, our food was made with utmost attention and the freshest ingredients. I would give this place 5 stars if only our pizza order hadn't been messed up. While we had ordered a supreme with added toppings, when our pizza came out, it only had the 3 added toppings we had asked be added. Our server without hesitation immediately apologized and took it from us with a real ""We're gonna make this right"" attitude which we really appreciated. We would've been happy if the other toppings had been cooked aside and just tossed on our pizza, because not gonna lie, we were eager to eat it! But the chef made us an entirely new pizza, and he did so super quickly! We felt bad because our pizza was huge and we were worried the first pizza was gonna get tossed but when we asked for our to go box, our server boxed our left overs and came back with the first pizza in a box as well and we were so relieved because perfectly good food shouldn't be thrown out! Of course we weren't charged for the first pizza and now we have dinner for the rest of the week! haha.

You don't get the service you are expecting, they will not check on you after they give you your food and it takes them a while to take your order and the place is not even busy. I got up and refilled my own cup, she never came back to see if we needed anything.

Food well... now that's another story....
Pasta Fagoli is excellent, authentic Italian! Pizza is good.",kOqcNFcpDl3h8vFNJ7FwWA,3,0,1,YDBRvCDCdJbBtSRKuI5urA
