1029,2010-11-02,1,rq5dgoksPHkJwJNQKlGQ7w,"Love love LOVE Sambalatte!  Vegas has been lacking cafes like this one! I go here multiple times a week and everything has been perfect.  They have many different coffees brewed through various unique processes that make a French press look run of the mill.  Cappuccinos and lattes are full bodied and strong, and they have designs in the foam.  Great hot tea selection available in french press pots, and a delicious iced green yerba mate.  They have sandwiches (good caprese one, heated and served with a side of balsamic) and lots of desserts- including minis (napoleon, eclair, tiramisu cups, etc).  They also have gelato and sorbet, and my husband's all time fav- affogato (gelato with a shot of espresso poured over).  The atmosphere here is charming and warm, and they are open till 10pm wed-sat.  Service is excellent, they always walk upstairs to bring me my drink and are super friendly.  There is free wifi and an entire long table downstairs with multiple plugs for laptops.  Only negative is that I wish they stayed open later on weekends, especially for Vegas 10pm is early to close!",dEgO4_n8thLMbG1dKfFMHg,2,2,5,itC-MHiVQ9uch8ZqAouPCQ

10262,2010-12-13,0,rq5dgoksPHkJwJNQKlGQ7w,"For being one of the most aesthetically pleasing and warm feeling coffee shops I've been to in Vegas; I found it a bit counteracted by a busy upscale location being Boca Park. Which if that's your cup of tea that's fine and I appreciate what it has to offer but as for the Coffee shop at hand it seems like a place you'd find in a nice chill Pacific Northwest town(which is what I like about Sambalatte's atmosphere).

As for the Menu it's all done out fashionably in chalk and looked very well balanced with choices of Coffee, Tea's, Espresso, Iced Coffee, etc.  The thing that stood out to me about the Menu was the fun choices it had the I don't normally see at places such as Coffee Bean & Starbucks. Of course I went with the fun choice off the seasonal menu and was not disappointed. I ordered the Nutcracker (Vanilla, Hazlenut, & Chocolate) and it hit the spot. I'll be the first to admit that I'm not a coffee pro but this was the perfect blend of flavors. Unfortunately my girlfriends Latte' did not live up and was very watery.  

On another note the if you order in you get served in quaint coffee cups that remind me of coffee shops I would pass through in Europe and adds to the overall environment. It's also very accommodating with outlets & sweet furniture galore for you ""Lap Top Coffee Shop Folk"" and whatever it is that you do ; )

But seriously if you don't mind the Hipsters that roam about the area I really recommend you give it a shot. It's a very nice shop with a menu I know I'll be back to further dive into. Try the Nutcracker while they have it!",bBwN87JuqRXJDkEbX-TWAA,1,1,3,7XqC7wmKbgREv118_MjdfQ
11651,2013-01-23,0,rq5dgoksPHkJwJNQKlGQ7w,"This may not be a completely fair review for the business since they can't control everything I have complaints about, but here's my opinion:

We went on a Sat. night, maybe that was our mistake. The tiny place was just packed, and it was very hard to find a table for 4. Finally one opened up, but it was very uncomfortable because we were so closed to everyone else. I rather be in a place that I can feel comfortable in and lounge and talk without inviting everyone into my conversation. Also since it was our first time trying the place, we all ordered a drink and at least one food item each....which did not all fit onto the table. We had to consolidate all the food items onto just a couple of plates. We basically finished our drinks and food and left because of the crowded atmosphere. And I know most people are probably going to hate me for saying this, but I just don't get why all these people are staying around for hours taking up the few tables there are. Honestly, I don't see how you can study or read in a place like this when it's crowded and there is a guy singing in the front. Maybe in the daytime but not on a Sat night. I wish everyone would be more considerate and study at home or a library and get their drinks/food to go. While I was there, I didn't see too many people reordering so basically you're just taking up room that other patrons need.

As for the drinks/food, none of us were impressed. It wasn't bad but it didn't knock our socks off either. The employees weren't super friendly or unfriendly. I don't think I will be returning, I prefer Starbucks or Coffee Bean more, it has a more comfortable and friendlier atmosphere.",sEx1Ua3yNjxBdJ_vJ9amfA,0,0,2,mjlbWiPgV0N92q7bwaPHCA
20828,2011-01-04,0,rq5dgoksPHkJwJNQKlGQ7w,"I am completely obsessed with this place! Obsessed, obsessed, obsessed!!!!  

A friend suggested this place to meet and study one night during finals week and I was impressed upon arrival.  Where else in Vegas can you find a cute little indie cafe?  There are couches, tables, and even a loft for people to do their thing at.  It smelled so good in there too!  Just a whiff of it would probably wake you up.   

I wasn't much of a coffee fan before.  I thought it just tasted like mud (or what I would imagine mud to taste like), but then I tried it here.  I got the gingerbread man latte.  It wasn't too sweet and I liked that you could taste the coffee rather than just the gingerbread flavor.  I admit that coffee still isn't my favorite, but if I had to have it anywhere, Sambalatte is where I'll go.  Just a heads up, their espresso shots are strong!! My brother asked for an extra shot in his mocha (I guess that's how he orders at the other places), and the barista warned him that their shots are the equivalent of 3 of the chain coffee houses.  Personally, I like their teas.  They use actual tea leaves and not the diluted tea bags that  everywhere else uses.  My goal is to try every single one they have.  I also like that they have sandwiches, salads, cheese platters, and pastries.  Light lunch anyone??  

The best thing about this place: presentation!!  Two words...FOAM ART!!  It's a simply touch but it can make all the difference.  Let's just call it luxury in a cup!  Their teas are served in a glass tea press.  Again, it's not much, but it's the little things that matter!  

After raving on and on about this place, it goes without saying that I think this is a must try.  Whatever your mood, they'll have something for you.",EfOhaQ-J5s9t2EmH0uBELw,1,0,5,M79VAhvABi4HZLSS03k0Fw

55981,2016-02-25,0,rq5dgoksPHkJwJNQKlGQ7w,I would've given them just a star but I'm giving them credit for their coffee. Customer service is unbelievably terrible. Patiently waited for our food (ham & cheese croissant and Italian cold cut) and waited for 40 mins! Staff wasn't apologetic. Just asked us if we want a refund (their way to fix things). Get it together and up your customer service skills!

Excellent, independent shop with top quality coffee. A real antidote to the cookie cutter, cardboard Starbucks monotony. Sambalatte is just about the only place in the US I've come across that can make an authentic Flat White, a delicious coffee drink popular in Australia and New Zealand. They also have a wide selection of teas and sweetened drinks, though I have not tried these.

The service staff are primarily young people and, as some have said, maybe a little bit rough, but I notice it getting better all the time. There is a nice selection of pastries, fruit and meat trays, even a few sandwiches like good-quality ham and brie on crusty bread with champagne mustard. 

The atmosphere has a cool vibe. There are current magazines from around the country, and newspapers, and free wi-fi. There are two floors of indoor seating and seating outside, too, with free standing heaters for the cooler weather. 

The owner is almost always on site, which is no doubt, why the quality has remained consistently high on each of my visits. 

I can recommend Sambalatte highly.",z3QfjD55F6YjDNIjcii5Ew,1,1,5,1aa6fTENdyVwA9595N8oRQ

90403,2013-05-13,0,rq5dgoksPHkJwJNQKlGQ7w,"Independent coffee shops remind me of when my friends and I would cafe-hop while studying for finals. Unfortunately, they're a rare kind here in Vegas, but Sambalatte is the closest thing to what I've been searching for!

There's no doubt that their latte art is eyecatching, but sometimes the flavor's lost in their drinks. That said, I enjoyed their mocha latte, but their famous Nutella latte was a bit of a watery letdown. Their matcha green tea latte never fails to lure me, but the price prevents me from caving in to temptation. I'll treat myself to it one day.

Their macarons have me hooked. Vibrantly colored with a flavor to match, these meringue morsels have a diameter slightly longer than that of a half dollar. Hands down, their mango macaron is my absolute favorite. My only wish is that they were a smidge bigger for their $1.50 price tag, but I understand these delicate sweet treats are difficult to make.

With its comfortable atmosphere and mellow hipster vibe, this cafe welcomes anyone from the sole person equipped with a laptop to a couple on a coffee date. Makes for an ideal people watching spot (if you're into that), so grab a latte, take a seat, and enjoy.",EHvPZx_EY_s4r_5K6fL6tg,3,2,4,PnszmZIStyUo8gNwsNJQJg

Some middle aged blonde woman came stomping up the stairs looking very determined, went into the employees only locked room, and I heard shouting. A different lady came out looking surprised, but the shouting continued so I assume she wasn't the main target.

After another few minutes, a younger guy came out and stomped down the stairs.  At this point I was totally enthralled, so I moved seats downstairs to see what else would happen.  My mind is racing trying to figure out the dynamic and what's going on. and nobody noticed I was eavesdropping lol

From downstairs listening to the baristas, I was able to deduce that the blonde woman, either Sherry or Sheila, was the owner and she just fired the manager for one of her own mistakes and they were all reeling from it.  Something about payroll.. so now they're all filing wage disputes.  The kid upstairs I guess stood up to her and was fired too..

The cashiers do not seem knowledgeable about whats being served on a given day or what they're out of. My guess is that they've hired too many of them, keep them on a revolving-door shift schedule of a few hours a week, and thus when they show up for work, have no idea what's going on. Baristas and servers are generally friendly though.

The novelty of this place wears off when you realize it's constantly busy and thus, hard as f*ck to find a seat here. Especially if you have a laptop and want to study. Yeah, don't study here.

The cheese plates have an awkward combo of cheeses that don't really go together, nor are entirely meant for mass eating, beyond just a bite or two. The sanwiches are very bare, way too much bread for what's in between, and while the pastries have amazing presentation, many taste freezer-burnt. The service to actually get your coffee once it's ordered is ridiculously slow, they really need to iron that out soon!!! And the plates are way too big, they need to find a way to condense things onto one plate esp for meats, cheeses, etc. The coffee prices aren't too bad as the coffees are amazing, but the food prices are highway robbery especially for what they're giving. The location, ambiance & people are great so I'm sure they'll continue to do well, but with their outrageous prices, I think the novelty will wear off & business will drop when people realize they have other great choices in Vegas for literally half the cost.",UK6wOz-JMBMGbF5h3CByIg,0,0,3,HwICMro7ImcOh_pWLyuMXA

I left for school and came back for winter break it is really changed.

The barista that helped me was excellent. I wish I had gotten his name, but he is the tall guy with the beard. He explained why they do not have dark roast coffees, and he actually seemed to care about coffee. 
Not to mention he actually asked me what size coffee I wanted (and didn't just charge me for a large, which is what happened to me 2 or 3 times before). 
The coffee was brewed to perfection. Plus, I love the to-go cups. They are integrated with a coffee sleeve as part of the cup. I am all about the little details, those were pretty cool. 

The atmosphere is still amazing. The barista just made it great though. I'll get his name next time and put it on here.

I came to Las Vegas for my friends 50th birthday and before I left home (Burlingame, CA) I searched the internet to find a specialty coffee house. I had yet to find any coffee in Las Vegas on the strip that would satisfy my thirst for flavorful, delicious espresso and coffee pours and hoped this is what I was looking for, it is!!

We arrived and was excited to see the different brewing methods in action! The couple I was with had never been to a place such as this and they were treated to one of the best cups of coffee (pour over) and a latte they had ever had. I had an espresso to start and then finished with a cap with my wife, both superb!!!

Not only was the coffee and ambiance fantastic but the knowledge of the Batista's excellent. They took time to explain to me how they pulled shots, since I wanted to understand how I can improve mine, and talked about the different flavors you can get and taste. They were doing a vacuum brew for a customer and explaining the process and was lucky enough to have another customer say how amazing the coffee was.

Both delicious and they  look so beautiful you just want to admire from afar but can't help yourself to drinking them. The french macarons are good and so is the chocolate croissant. You sort of just want to stay there all day with a cup of coffee in  one hand. My daughter also enjoyed her hot chocolate with marshmallows and she also tried some sort of smoothie, which I also had a taste of she loved it as well.",R_n1YTRie3URq27zFEyFfA,0,0,5,44wN1G-4ep-7m-GVAPiejw

There is usually a line, but worth it.  Definitely dont assume you're going to rush in and out of there with a beverage.  They provide a variety of brewing methods and small treats.  Seating is available, but limited.  People like to homestead there, but its a coffee shop, expect it.  WiFi access is provided with a purchase.

There was a musician playing beautiful music live so I tipped him! He was the best part of the entire experience. Lots of random books throughout the place. It's nicely lit but still dim to give it a chill vibe. I love that there's an upstairs too. I would suggest maybe a couch or two for even more comfort. 

BUT...I decided to order since I spent a good amount of time in there. My order was very simple. I wanted a small black tea. That's all. The boy who took my order (light skin,blonde-ish hair, friendly) made my my tea. After I paid and left the counter I went to the side to grab some napkins and a little sugar. When I smelled my coffee it smelled nothing like black tea. Almost like a autumn spiced tea of some sort. I tasted it; not black tea. I opened the lid and the entire tea bag was opened and spilled throughout my tea. It was gross. I couldn't even drink it even though I felt bad for wasting it. I know the boy knew it was like that too because he looked a bit tense when he handed me my tea. 
I asked the boy about their soup of the day. He looked confused, then went and looked into their fridge (why would fresh soup be kept in a fridge and not a warm pot?) he then told me they were all out. Which was fine, I just didn't like the thought of the soup I almost got to be warmed up in a microwave.

749291,2011-06-18,0,rq5dgoksPHkJwJNQKlGQ7w,"I like Sambalatte a lot.  The location is in the middle of the west side, the staff is pleasant and helpful, the selection is exceptional.

I like Sambalatte because it is almost pitch-perfect in its conception and location - and my few exceptions (detailed below) are really quite minor.  It isn't an expensive coffee shop that should really just sell-out to Starbucks, and it isn't thrown together at all.

Sambalatte takes OCD to the max when it comes to its product.  Among its many selections are pastries worthy of royalty brought in fresh daily, sandwiches on baguette and soups, even a delightful selection of cookies and biscuits.  However, the real strength comes from its coffee.

I am by no means a coffee connoiseur, but Sambalatte makes me question that statement.  Not only are there a number of fine locally-roasted brews available seasonally and the standard lattes performed like art, Sambalatte also has options for the adventurous.  My favorite is the chemistry set that can be used to brew fresh coffee table-side for that special Ethiopian Yergacheffe.

I am a tea connoiseur, and, other than some persnicketiness that comes with knowing a product well, I find that Sambalatte puts most other cafes to shame with its selection of fine loose teas.  You'll only find a larger selection at Teavana or Tea Station, and neither has the ambience (Teavana is not a cafe.).

There are a few things that keep it from being the only place I drive fifteen minutes to for coffee, tea and pastries.

1. Despite the large selection of quality loose tea and a near obsessive attention to detail, Sambalatte's method for brewing these teas is a coffee press.  This may seem like a small detail, but teas over-brew if not removed completely from water.  Also, the number of ready-to-pour iced teas is limited, but good.  A non-ready-made chai would also be nice (Picky, I know, but worthy suggestions for a place that gets so much right.).

2. The seating in Sambalatte is not my favorite.  Other than cafe tables and chairs, the ""cozy"" seating is largely outdoor furniture (comfortable), including a pair of park benches.

3. The final gripe I have is about price.  Now, I'll be honest, I am the guy who will hang at a coffee house for hours, taking advantage of cheap refills, but Sambalatte's pricing is pretty steep in some areas.  For one, a perfectly good iced tea at the Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf will run about $2.80 for 32oz. at Sambalatte you get about 20oz. for the same.  Also, most of the pastries are between $4-6 and a plate of antipasto can run $18.  

The main thing is I am, and will remain, a regular customer.",Og5Uu8lxOTnTT6dQmxFmzg,3,2,4,Jpu4jsV9FeutSe7XeNZyyQ

What tops this place and pushes a 4 star up to a 5 is that they have somehow created an ambiance that compels you to sit and relax for a while, sip rather than guzzle, and to have some quiet time reading (when you're by yourself) or to socialize (when you're with a friend).  So when you order a coffee ""for here"", they serve it in a nice mug or glass.  Of course if you don't have time to sit and relax, they have ""to go"" cups for your convenience.  Silly as it may sound, when I'm here, I imagine that I'm in a cafe that is described in that show Rick Steve's Europe.  Keep in mind I'm not saying that they intended it to be a European cafe, I'm just trying to describe how the ambiance takes me to a different place.  This could be different for you. 

About the service, the baristas are very friendly and helpful.  They make your lattes and cappuccinos with finesse (you can see it in many pictures).  They also don't seem like coffee snobs telling you how you should drink your coffee.  They are just really laid back.  They also bus your table but I try bus it myself when I leave.

On to the coffee.  The mocha and white mocha is delicious with the right amount of espresso to milk/foam to sweet ratio and both do not come with whipped cream (which I don't mind).  The cappuccino is delightful with the right foam to espresso ratio.  Finally the house coffee is light to medium roast with a clean finish.  It tastes fine black but I like to add cream and sugar.

The cost is a little high so this is not my regular coffee place.  However, if you're looking for a simple break from the Las Vegas atmosphere and daily grind, I would recommend coming here once in a while.

1024628,2012-05-31,0,rq5dgoksPHkJwJNQKlGQ7w,"Nestled in the shopping and dining extravaganza of Boca Park (which borders Summerlin, for you non-Westsiders) lies the delectably comfortable atmosphere of Sambalatte Torrefazione.

Sambalatte is no Starbucks. Walking up to it, one notices the outside patio rivals the entire interior of competitors, and walking inside, it only gets larger. Yet while some might associate an oversized anything to be of Walmart quality, Sambalatte is certainly not, both in decor and atmosphere, nor in quality and taste, as one would expect.  And of course not in price.

Although many of the high-end locations inside the cosmopolitan complex of Boca Park are of a similarly high-end price, which one would expect, Sambalatte's prices are quite fair given what it offers. Take for example the hot mocha latte adorned with some of the coolest ""coffee art"" I've ever seen, which runs at $4.10, tastes superb and will add a strong jolt to those of us needing some extra energy. To-go cups and containers are also available for all drinks, but if you're in the area it's best to take a break and relax.

A quick coffee craving can easily be changed into an enjoyable and relaxing afternoon out too. Bookcases and newsstands are set up around the location, full of plenty of interesting magazines and even plenty of novels. Heading upstairs leads to even more bookcases, and a feel of some sort of private, extravagant library, which is all at one's disposal. Alone in a corner next to a big-screen TV are board games like Monopoly and Pictionary.

Aside from a wide range of coffee offerings (which can also be made in special styles such as the aero press, French press and so on) are plenty of teas and other specialty and seasonal drinks to satisfy just about any thirst, and a plethora of decadent pastries and delicious sandwiches.

While I generally end up at Sambalatte for early hour or mid-afternoon study sessions, if you visit in the evening you might get lucky enough to catch some live music, which, in the past has managed not to be too invasive but perfectly enjoyable.

Despite the ability to accommodate several dozen coffee connoisseurs, on early weekend mornings Sambalatte can still manage to pack up quite a bit, but one can almost surely find a spot to sit down and enjoy the experience -- and if not, well, Lee's is around the corner for an early night start.

As far as coffee, I got the Guatemala pour-over. The quality was great. They have some other options, too--Ethiopia Sidoma included. My friend got the cold brew which was also excellent. They serve the cold brew in bottles you can pour yourself. This was cool for us because we could buy some bottles to take with us. They have your standard espresso-based options, and a good selection of sandwiches and pastries, too.

I liked the atmosphere, too. Friendly staff. There are two levels, plenty of tables, seats, and counters, and the kicker: they actually place outlets almost everywhere if you want to plug your laptop in. The place has a wall with a giant map painted on of the countries where they get their coffee from.

And finally, the wifi. A decent amount of coffee places don't have wifi functional enough to do work. Sambalatte's wifi worked really well, and they print the wifi network and password on the receipt so it's there for you to access, which I thought was a nice touch.

Their food choices always lures me in. It literally has all the best bakery options. Their ham and cheese croissant is one of my favorites with extra rich flavor and flakey texture. A popular one is the almond croissant which is perfect for days that you can't decide if you want sweet or savory. Their macarons...these little devils are what is causing my sweet tooth.

I walked up to the counter and the barista was talking to her co-worker for several minutes before she even acknowledged me. Strike one. I ordered a caramel iced latte with 3 shots and she said they couldn't do that because their machine made either 2 or 4 shots. Uh...ok. You can't pull two shots and then a single one from an espresso machine? Strike two. I sat down at the only space available and the guitar player who must have been performing there that afternoon showed up and never said anything, but looked like he wanted to set up in our spot and kept sighing and looking at his watch. Strike three. I wolfed down my not-so-spectacular quad shot latte and muffin and couldn't get out of there fast enough. 

The only good thing I can say about my experience is that the cranberry muffin I had was top notch and delicious. Too bad about the coffee and the rude staff.

It's also a great place for breakfast - I've sampled (read: devoured) all of their croissant sandwiches and quiche and can attest that they rival anything from Einstein's or Panera. 

For lunchtime, unfortunately, the soups are pretty bland; they're vegetarian and broth-based, so they lack that savoriness. 

The only other negative comment I can make is to warn others who might go to get some work done that there's acoustic performances in the evenings (starting around 7 or sometimes earlier, depending on the day) and if you want a quiet place, this won't be it.

But perhaps, being on the inside of the business provides a different perspective than that of the customer. So, with that being said, here is my unbiased opinion of the company and the product. Sambalatte is run by Luiz Oliveira, an experienced businessman from the heart of Rio de Janeiro. With nearly 30 years of experience, you can expect top of the line service, and he does not disappoint. What I've learned that I didn't know before I was employed was that the food was baked and made each morning from a local cook using organic ingredients. I also learned that the beans come from all over the world by LOCAL growers. The Monte Carlo location roasts the beans as well. So, although customers come in and find that the food and drinks may be unusual, it is without said that whatever price you pay, you should expect love in each and every sip or bite. The atmosphere is incredible and the people that come in are very interesting, and as an employee, I'm excited to start my day at this place.

This is a nice place to study if you like the busy cafe feel; but if you need a more quiet area to study, maybe grab a snack and coffee here and find somewhere else to study.

My favorite here is the nutella latte, it is just amazing! You can tell that the coffee is freshly ground and it is smooth and flavorful, while the hint of chocolate and hazelnut enhances the coffee, making a slightly sweet and nutty flavor to the overall drink. In addition, they even make their lattes look pretty with designs on top using the steamed milk. 

They also have a wide selection of desserts and snacks; from warm and light quiches to macarons and cakes. I haven't tried much of their food (except their quiches, which are delicious), but their coffee is amazing.

The Pour:
Very good, roast is nice and medium, forgot to ask what they had on bar but I think their general profile is on the medium side

Service:
Baristas are all skilled at pulling the shot and the latte art - quite friendly too.

Ambiance:
Not particularly hipster, average coffeeshop vibe. Clean and moderately busy the times I went there.

Conclusion:
Very good, my favorite by far of what I tried in Las Vegas, although I only tried out a few places while I was visiting.

About Me / Review Criteria:
-I only review ""Third Wave""/artisanal/craft coffee shops (whatever you want to call them)
-Nobody gets more than 4 stars until I've gone several times
-Reviews can't be based on just a select group of baristas, they all have to be equally skilled, or at least must all have a minimum level of skill
-My star ratings are solely based on the drink, never on food, ambiance, or if the barista is emo or snobby (because that would bring down more than 50% of the shops), although I do mention those in the review
-I don't claim to be a trained coffee connoisseur
-My reviews are generally based on gibraltar/cortados (or cappuccinos), not espresso or drip/pourover coffee",3VjDMqOuH6FEiF79m8cgjQ,0,0,4,uewXkz6stkb6uWJQdmU46A

1352485,2014-02-07,0,rq5dgoksPHkJwJNQKlGQ7w,"Came here on a cloudy, thursday early afternoon. To my surprise, it was completely packed ! !  People everywhere, in almost every seat, and the line had at least 5-8 people. Ordering process was quick. 

I had ordered a latte, to be drank there, extra hot. My drank came out pretty fast. Maybe around 3 minutes. 

Since there was no seats, i opt'ed to sit outside. Even though it was a little chilly. Thought my ""extra hot"" latte would hold me off for a while. When i had drank my latte, it was... maybe warm. I didn't wanna bring it back in because the drink was pretty full and it was quite the far walk with such a full drink. xD The flavor of their latte is pretty strong. In comparison to a matcha latte i had at their other location on jones, this was MUCH stronger. The matcha latte, I didnt really taste much of the matcha. It was nice that i got my drink so fast, but maybe they missed the ""extra hot"" part of the order. 

I've been here a few times, on separate occassions (work, social, or reading). The atmosphere is pretty good. The last time i was at this location, there was a live performance by a local artist. It was kind of loud, especially if you were there to socialize with friends. 

This location has an upper floor. A few individual/2 seaters, and one long table that seats i believe 6-8. Good place for a coffee or a snack, located in Boca Park, next to other restaurants. Parking may be a little pain, depending on the time you go there. Overall, nice place for a good cup of coffee, that's not starbucks :P",Ksp1e9Dw0Jcog_ZBD3-45g,0,0,4,u7MWavRY8DPWtMoFRjwqcw

I've had everything from their cappuccinos, specialty Nutella coffees, lattes iced and cold, regular coffee and it's totally served the same...forgettable.. Get ready to drown your coffee with milk (containers are usually empty) or pack it with sugar (if there's any around) because I guarantee you that after a couple times spending $6.00 or more for coffee you'll end up just ordering hot coffee and going through the motions that you're actually drinking it.

Now if you're eating or meeting here in the winter time, be prepared to bring a jacket and scarf because this place has one of the most annoying swinging doors in Vegas. You know the kind when a customer comes in the cold air blasts through and the door doesn't automatically close? Yeah it's that place. Be prepared to freeze.

I was debating on leaving this review but as a company, they should have been more prepared for such a large gathering where they could have gained NEW customers.

After waiting 1.5 hours I decided I didn't want the ""free"" Coffee especially after finding out that only the first 250 people (which I was probably 300th or so in line) just received a code for 3 months of Netflix free so to make my time more worth the wait I bought myself a Lavender Latte. Another 30 minutes later I finally got my latte and sure it was pretty with the little latte heart but it tasted horrible and nothing like coffee or lavender!! What a waste of 2 hours just for a paper cup with a Gilmore Girls quote. All the staff members looked tired and miserable and come on, you should have been more prepared!

Without any explanation or context.   

The staff seem apathetic and disgruntled, although whether the issue is with each other or the customers is unclear. My coffee was sitting out for five minutes because my name must have been whispered from the kitchen for how loud they called it. While our order was for here, one of the drinks was in a paper to-go cup, without a lid or a drink holder. 

Whenever I come here I tend to assume any drink I order will be criminally under-sweetened, and today was no exception.

We asked the girl on register(young,very petite Asian girl) if since it says flour less would that also be gluten free. She said it's dairy free. We said we want to know if it's gluten free and she says she thinks so but isn't sure. If you sell it I believe you should know what is in your products. I told her never mind because she didn't even offer to ask anyone else. I ordered a white mocha cappuccino and she says they only make Nutella and regular and that they can't make white mocha a cappucino. Basically what I waned waswhite mocha with extra extra foam.

I frequent Starbucks, so I'm horribly accustomed to that 'corporate' taste. Starbucks coffee isn't bad, by any means. However in comparing it to places like sambalatte, in the past, Starbucks would be the equivalent to an assembly line where as sambalatte would be the small business that personalizes each service they provide. And you used to be able to taste this distinction. 

However, these last couple of time I've been there, this places taste quality has fallen dramatically. What is the point of a 'cool' scene to hang out at if the product you're paying for is highly over priced for extremely tiny sizes without the unique taste that would normally be enough to balance out the size and price?

This last time my boyfriend went there, he ordered a white mocha and a nutella. He brought them home and they both tasted like lattes. Literally could NOT distinguish between the two save for a slight sliver of a sweeter taste on one of them. They didn't just taste like plain lattes, they tasted like lattes you could make on a keurig machine. We paid 12$ for keurig coffee. 

A bit of advice, work less on your latte 'art' and more on the actual taste of your product. The sweets and pastries are pretty good. But this place is called sambalatte. Not sambapastry.",Az_uIsVHK6VzmhpqxIpVhQ,4,0,1,kPRY1guny-a2fr5HWYoMvA

Vaguely reminiscent of Blue Bottle in SF, this place has the 90s coffeehouse  setting down pat. Menu has a lot of dessert-coffee drinks available along with high quality regular stuff. Opted for the chocolate cappuccino and the matcha latte, and asked the cashier what her favorite dessert was- I was eyeing the tiramisu or brownie parfaits. She gave me a look that said, ""No way, Jose!"" and immediately let me know that her favorites are the nutella or crunch bombs- but admitted she was a huge chocoholic.

Opted for the nutella bomb, a chocolate-covered dome with an accent chocolate on top, to accompany our drinks- all were out quickly. Chocolate capp was delicious, but not the best I've had in LV. Matcha latte was a unique drink, and I appreciated that it was not caffeinated and not too sweet, but did not feel it was worth the $6.25 price.

But the nutella bomb. Shut the front door.
I can't even describe it, but it was amazing. A chocolate-covered dome of white fluffy stuff and what seemed to be bits of chocolate cake, all on top of a thick, crunchy cookie-type wafer. It was heaven. So glad I split the order too- it appeared small but was very indulgent and probably a meal's worth of calories.

I find coffee shops my third place environment, somewhere away from home and workplace, some place I can sit down and clear my thoughts and to study (expect tables to be extremely small and 1 table won't fit a laptop & books)

The place is crowded and kinda small. 

ALSO the food is totally overpriced and it's not that great. Whenever I go to samba I usually go to Grimaldi's or Wahoo's for food because the food isn't that great. I've tried a couple of the sandwiches and the lentil soup which are just mediocre, nothing special but the prices are like 9+ and their quiches are about $7-8 and they're just OK. 

Their macarons aren't the best in town and I recommend going to patisserie manon for macarons AND quiches. (patisserie manon is literally 2 min away) Quiches are FIVE dollars at patisserie and they are actually good, since that place IS a french bakery so they make it there fresh daily. 

SO for food --MEH and the crowdedness, 3 stars because they do have really good drip coffee. 

Their lattes are overpriced and they are pretty good because of the quality and freshness of the espresso. 

About a year ago, I would have given this place 5 stars. It was my ""go to"" when I wanted to kick back at a coffee shop. But now that everyone knows of this place, it is just too congested.",u0bAtrQrgEoHjFybAl9FeQ,2,0,4,7C0UYMup9UVf5ol0PPilWQ

PROS: This place has a lot of architectural character, there's a nice patio area, and the food and drinks are good. The ambiance is perfect for catching up with friends and I'm particularly impressed with the latte art and the French bakery-quality pastries. 

CONS: The service is very slow - as someone who used to work at Starbucks, I'm always shocked by how disorganized and inefficient the staff are (that kind of thing would never fly at Starbucks), and it certainly doesn't help that the place is packed on evenings and weekends. Also, the wannabe-hipster vibe can get annoying...I think that was the biggest initial turn off for me (although I've since learned to ignore it).   

Bottom Line: It's a nice little cafe, but it has its flaws. If I have the extra time and can go during non-peak hours, I like to treat myself to Sambalatte. Otherwise, Starbucks is just a lot easier.",8bt-bEeZgBsBCCaOao4D7Q,1,0,4,rg7TTLrw8AvMHJUg-N77Og

Today they were pretty crowded. Most of the people who come here are the ones who like to go on their laptops. First floor gets filled up fast, but they do have a second floor. And there's outside seating a well. Even with the crowd and the noise, I still love the whole vibe of the shop.

Now that I am back, I am happy and excited to report that Sambalatte is my favorite place in Las Vegas to hang out, have a non-alcoholic drink and be normal. This is THE best coffee spot! Ever.

The baristas are all VERY knowledgable and can give you advice on their coffees and teas. The service is VERY good and they are efficient.

One example. A visit a little while back, I had an iced tea. I was about to hit the sugar station, and a barista asked if I would like the sugar melted in a little bit of hot water so that it would dissolve in my tea.

It's little things like that. 

Also, they have a nice selection of light bites and some baked goods. 

There are plenty of laptop stations (FREE WIFI) with power outlets. Write your next novel here. Or study. The next time I visit, I plan on coming with a friend to talk about life. Yeah...it's one of those places.

Lastly, there are over 240 reviews for this place. Everything I said....well, has already been said. 

If you are from Vegas or live here, make this a regular spot. Support local when you can. Everyone that works at Sambalatte seems to be a good person in their own genuine way.

Also, if you are from out of town, DRIVE OR TAKE A CAB! PLEASE! This is worth the expense...even if it's not on the strip.

There's a table on the left side, used for people with laptops. There's also another upstairs with a plug underneath the table (it's kinda hard to know it's there unless someone tells you or you read this). And then there's usually some guitarist playing some amazing music and soothing you with their voice.

The food is pretty up there. Small portion sizes, big taste, high price. Everything they serve edible-wise is all comfort food; don't expect any kind of dinner or buffet of some sort. There's also a wide variety of drinks. I personally got the Nutella (something) coffee. It was alright, didn't taste anything like Nutella though. Was more like harsh coffee than anything. Still, I have yet to try out the whole selection of drinks. 

Another note, to get onto their Wi-Fi, the receipt you get when you purchase something will have the password on the bottom of it. It's like, it could technically be called Paid Wi-Fi, but at the same time, grab someone's receipt and get it from them. No big deal yo.

However, in terms of quality coffee they are not good. Sunrise coffee and Tipsy coffee houses serve better coffee in LV.  They offer pour-over coffee but use a weak ratio giving you a watered down flavor. The cappuccinos are okay. Their espresso is inconsistent. 

Their customer service is not memorable. The people at the counter are ready for your order to be finished and the next person helped. Fast is good, but quality customer service does not make the person ordering feel rushed.

I worked about a year or so as a barista then manager over at a Starbucks and since then, was swallowed into the coffee culture that Philadelphia/NYC/NJ offered.  When I moved to Vegas, I decided I just love the environment that a great coffeehouse can offer: the aromas, friendly, casual diners, art filled mindsets, and what the hell: DELICIOUS DRINKS.

Sambalatte offers all of this, beautifully at that.  Located in Boca park, it offers coffee - each cup freshly ground and prepared so the acidity is minimal and the taste is effortless with minimal cream or sugar recommended.  (I'd like to mention the baristas were very knowledgable about each product and were very helpful.)

A giant mural of the regions of each type of coffee blend as well as a very decent offering of tea is displayed.  What made it for me was the from-scratch whipped cream that was just decadent.  

I had a nutella hot chocolate that just made my afternoon, drizzling and all, glow.  I cradled it on my way home and cursed the fact that I had work in a few hours and did not have the opportunity to enjoy the cafe to its fullest.

I walked in, glanced at the menu, and almost pulled my phone to google some of the stuff on the menu because I didn't want to look like a newbie ;x LOL! True story.

The first time I came in, I stared at the menu from a distance and since it's handwritten, I had to squint to read it (I'm bad at wearing my glasses when I need to -__-). Talk about looking even more like a newbie. With all my knowledge of coffee from Starbucks, I searched for the most familiar things and told myself, ""Ahh, I've had that before... and that, and that."" so I didn't order any of the familiar.  The item that stuck out to me was ""afogato."" Wasn't quick enough to google that one so I told the cashier (Taryn) with confidence in my voice and nervousness on my face, ""I'd like to have the afogato please."" And she proceeded to ask, ""What type of gelato would you like in it."" Losing my confident character-esque, I then said, ""Oh, what's good in it?"" LOL! She laughed too and suggested hazelnut gelato. I went with it and said I'll take it to go. My newbie adventure doesn't end there!

I sat down anticipating what I ordered, felt adventurous, and started a draft for my review. I looked around at the pastries that looked Venetian-worthy or something. ""Oh you fancy huh!"" - (c) Drake. I noticed the little island with a bunch of outlets suggesting customers to ""Hey, plug in here and write a novel or two!"" I walked to the entrance and noticed a grip of board games (Note: Come here and play Scrabble), and saw there was an upstairs. I didn't go up because I didn't want to miss my afogato and I was somewhat in a hurry so I decided to save that for later.

Taryn brought over my afogato in a white paper cup with a little spoon inside. I looked inside and was like ""WTF is this?!"" LMAO! I thanked her and walked out. I literally LOL'ed to myself when I looked at what I ordered. It looked like a cup of baby poo! LMAO! OMG! I laughed so hard to my gf on the phone and told her that I think I just ordered a cup of baby poo and coffee! Shows you how much I know about Sambalatte Tore-a-fuzz-yawn! I started eating away at the gelato and noticed it was espresso in there. STRONG! and I mean, STRONG like Iron Man strong! It was so bitter, I had to let my gf try it out (I'm so nice! haha!). Even she said it was strong and she likes her coffee strong! We kept laughing about it the whole night.

Then, I came back with her and some of our well versed coffee friends. I decided to retry the afogato, but with TWO scoops of hazelnut gelato! It tasted better and it helped with the taste of the espresso. We also tried the chocolate and pistachio biscuit. Not super great,  but tasty. There was a bunch of other fancy treats in there I'd like to try some other day.

Also tried the green forest smoothie which tastes more like apple juice than any of the other ingredients. I liked it but keep that in mind if you order it!

2080226,2013-09-23,0,rq5dgoksPHkJwJNQKlGQ7w,"My slice of heaven. It's hard to find good cafes in Vegas. Sundays they play live music which is always nice but during the acts that have an electric guitar, it gets a shade too loud to do work. They have an upstairs for extra seating as well as a mini patio in front. 

The people that come here are interesting as well, I like to people watch -- you will always see interesting folks stop by for a coffee.

Which brings me to my next point, their coffee is delicious but I like their hot tea more. They have it in large presses, perfect for enjoying multiple sips of tea. It can take awhile to get your order but that's understandable as they are usually busy. 

All in all, one of the best places to relax with friends or do work.

This is THE best cafe in town for several reasons. Not only do they have pastries that look and taste like they come from a renowned patisserie, but their coffee isn't as expensive as chains like Starbucks or other popular cafes like It's A Grind.

The spring season is the best time to be there because the whole plaza has outdoor seating. If you want the whole European feel of cobblestone streets, soft lights and mild conversations, this is the best place in Vegas for it.

In the inside, the cafe is two stories with sofa seating and a flat screen tv, overlooking downstairs like a balcony. They also have a long table with numerous power outlets for those on laptops. Internet card is provided for those who make a purchase.

Occasionally, they will have someone singing and playing guitar. No worries, its not some stoned idiot- its someone who knows what they're doing.

The Backpacker sandwich was tasty, whatever the sauce was I'd go back just for that, and the berry tea I had was pretty tasty. 

But it's the vibe of the place that makes it. Just weird enough to make me forget that I was in the suburban part of Las Vegas (which is pretty much nothing but strip malls and condos/housing neighborhoods). A guy playing the guitar just inside the front door kept it light and the spacing between the tables kept it cozy.

I love how the coffee beverages are served in beautiful mugs with a coffee design swirled in the froth if you stay and linger. The prices are on the high side, but for the lovely environment and personal touches, I understand. Seasonally, I've tried the pumpkin spice latte as well as the gingerbread latte (pumpkin wins), and plan to try the butterscotch latte on my next visit.

I've sampled the ham and cheese croissant, and wasn't the biggest fan. The croissant was a bit TOO flaky- it makes a huge mess, and there wasn't much ham on it.  I'll likely stick to lingering over my latte next time.",lQGJcwX105k17081f6pulg,2,0,4,RijFkngoyFIFQio3pckGWg
2100120,2015-06-07,0,rq5dgoksPHkJwJNQKlGQ7w,"I am surprised this place is sitting on four stars only. This is the best coffee joint in town, period. 

Explaining: Starbucks, being the largest coffee buyer in the world, buys predominantly B Grade coffee, there simply isn't enough A Grade coffee to supply Starbucks and the chains alike. So Starbucks ends up over roasting its coffee by two extra minutes to achieve the taste, but all it does is burns the coffee. 
Then you have the gourmet coffee shops on the strip who mostly use illy (A Grade) brand, which is really good, BUT, it takes months for the coffee to be grinded, canned and shipped to the US from Italy, and there you have it, second best, old coffee. 
 Now this little shop uses a vendor, who imports very small batches of A Grade, very select coffee beans from various parts of the planet depending on the season.
Coffee is roasted locally every Saturday, then delivered to this little coffee shop on Sunday. 
I personally buy my espresso beans here. The staff is knowledgeable enough to understand the type of espresso machine I'm using, and how to grind my beans.  
CONS:
Live music by up and coming artists is good, maybe a little too loud for the space constrained coffee shop. They have pastries imported from Paris if I am not mistaken, I wish they used local vendors, it would have been fresher and better for the community.

So, I calmly settled on a latte.  Upon the cashiers final insistence (he interrupted me before I finished my order) as to whether or not my order was ""for here or to go""...I walked out.

They have a nice selection of different coffees to choose from, which I appreciate. And the vanilla latte I had was quite good.

I haven't had a chance to try and of their pastries, salads, or sandwiches - but I definitely will the next time I go. 

They also have a lot of pretty interesting contraptions. And the way they brew their coffee, definitely isn't the way that most coffee shops do it. It does take a bit longer just to get a cup of coffee, but it's worth the wait. I'm a huge tea person, so it was nice to see that they do offer loose leaf tea. I was disappointed however, when I saw that they used a press to steep the tea. 

Lastly, one thing that bothers me about this place is it's location. Boca Park is a very busy place, and is always filled with people. Therefore, trying to find parking becomes a hassle.

Another star for the macaroons. I ordered three for about $2 each, not bad. And they were delicious! Some coffee shops sell macaroons that are rock solid and hard to eat, but Sambalatte does a good job at making macaroons with perfect texture and consistency. 

I absolutely love dirty chai lattes and I order them all the time at various coffee shops. I don't think Sambalatte knows what a dirty chai is because it was terrible. The mix of espresso and tea flavors did not match at all. One sip and I had to bring it back. The cashier was very polite and gladly replaced my drink with a Nutella cappuccino. For the $6 I paid for the dirty chai, it wasn't worth the Nutella cappuccino, but oh well. I would not have mind if the replacement drink was better, but it still tasted strange.

All in all, Sambalatte's coffee is noticeably more bitter than other local coffee shops. If that is your taste, go for it! It is also a little pricier than other places.

I'm an avid coffee lover and have always been told by other Yelpers that I should check out Sambalatte. After ignoring the advice for the past couple years, I decided to try it recently after we had dinner next door.

While they have a pretty large menu of drinks, upon closer review it was mostly just teas and sugary beverages. I told the barista that I liked strong/bold coffee and she told me just to get the house drip coffee because it was the strongest. Really? What about all the fancy roasts and coffee drinks on the menu? The coffee was ok...nothing memorable and definitely not as flavorful as some of the other local coffee roasters I've been to.

And to top it all off, no discounted refills on drip coffee when dining in so you basically have to purchase a second coffee! I never just have one cup when sitting at a café and while I don't expect places to have free refills, nearly every coffee shop in town offers half price or discounted price on refills. No thanks!

There is plenty of parking here, and indoor and outdoor seating. Plus, they had live music playing when we arrived which was also very nice.

I would go back and do recommend, but have a second choice ready to order in case they are out of what you want.",xKwdQNkBZIpwKLWYOlyz9Q,3,3,3,rgkYvFyT4x0lite0mTL0-A

It's almost winter time as well, the outdoor seating is great for a beautifully crafted warm latte, and their selection of pastries.

My sister was in town last weekend, so I thought to bring her to Sambalatte to check it out.  They didn't have iced white mocha on the menu, but they offer to make us some.  I'm guessing they only have one size for to-goers.....since they just assumed we want a large right when we ordered.  Then one of our friends got some gelato, and a red velvet cupcake.  The ice cream scooper yelled ""one or two scoop"", automatically the cashier said ""two"".  I noticed Sambalatte is a more high-end coffee shop and customers that go there wouldn't mind paying a little more for a bigger portion.  But without asking their clients what size/portion they prefer seem a little rude, plus what if he/she was on a diet and could only have a small/one scoop ice cream?

The iced-white mocha, which I'm so thankful they offer to make us some, were not at all anything to our expectations.  The coffee were too light, you can't even smell or taste it.  Mostly it was all just milk and some type of sweetener that taste nothing like a white mocha.  They definitely got the look down, but my iced white mocha was not as yummy as it looks.  Also, the gelato is comparable to any grocery store ice-cream, not that great :/ 

All in all, now I know for sure I do not like Sambalatte's products.  But I do love their book collection upstairs :)",YLJ0oqk1Tq44YjlfHDQ7Pw,1,0,1,0VtnvhG5HFMFp4MaQV5VmA

WHERE: Charleston & Rampart, inside the Boca Park area (right next to Kona Grill).

WHEN: Sunday through Tuesday from 7am-8pm, Wednesday through Thursday from 7am-9pm, Saturday from 7am-10pm

WHY: To drink tea/coffee, eat super yummy sweets, and most importantly... socialize and finally catch up with some of your friends that you haven't seen- just to have some sort of excuse to get up and go.! =)

WHAT: Thank goodness for good past reviews and recommendations through word-of-mouth! If it weren't for those two, I wouldn't have stepped foot in such an amazing cafe! It reminds me of a cafe I went to in New York. The atmosphere is calming, you can even enjoy, plop down, and read a book while chewing on something yummy or drinking something caffeinated.

I personally have this somewhat new addiction for macarons. So, that was my purpose when walking through the door. I noticed they had about 13 different flavors! My eyes lit up due to excitement! The macarons aren't as big though, they're bite size and almost 2 bucks for one, but you might as well ""seize the day"" and order all the flavors (which is exactly what I did)! haha, and from doing it I now know my favorites! Yes, I know you're waiting for it... so the ""must-tries"" have got to be: pistachio, mango, paradise, caramel, raspberry... ok, most all of them were really good! But those are some of my favorites. =D

Aside from the macaroons, I tried the carrot cake parfaitI It was a different way to prepare a carrot cake indeed, and the uniqueness made it perfect!

These are the only things I have got the pleasure of trying so far, but it will be my goal to try everything on their menu! hahaha, which will probably turn into a LIFETIME GOAL on my bucket list. Lol

I ordered the green matcha tea latte and husband got a vanilla latte, and the talented guitar player were the only reasons I gave it two stars-it was a delicious drink with a nice presentation. But when I told them I was allergic to peanuts and asked if the chocolate cake had nuts in it the cashier didn't know so asked the barista who seemed quite irritated that I even asked. He said no and she looked at something on the register and said so do you want it. I said yeah if it doesn't have nuts. She said no, so I got the cake. I went back to my seat and bit into the cake and right into a nut. I spit most of it out. I took it to the barista and kindly said this has nuts. He was not happy-grabbed the cake and threw it in the garbage and went about his business. I said well can I have something else? He was annoyed and got me a muffin mumbling something negative under his breath. Didn't say a word or look at me and put the muffin on the desk with an attitude. Never even offered to give me back the difference in price which was only a dollar or two.  I took Benadryl which doesn't always work. I told my husband we have to leave I'm not feeling well. Luckily I have an emergency medical kit but it really is not fun. I went to the barista and said you really need to be sure if you tell someone something doesn't have nuts. And I said for you to not even apologize or anything is pretty rude. I said people die from anaphylaxis. I thought he was going to start laughing. I said no. I'm serious. He said ok. Sorry. I will tell the manager to label things. But my job is really stressful he said. I said anaphylaxis is stressful.  He truly didn't care. Will not be going back here. How awful.  I would rather drink a plain cup of coffee and have nice service and not die.  This was a terrible experience and we love eclectic and trendy coffee shops but this place had a weird vibe. I don't know...and nearly $30 for two small coffees, a mediocre muffin, and tipping the guitar player  that no one clapped for, just not worth it.",EmZHCrvstz9ytEsUHwTOdg,1,0,2,bYp7w4_1FSfHK2XNGF-R3A
2553149,2011-07-17,1,rq5dgoksPHkJwJNQKlGQ7w,"Staff: I come so much I'm on a first name basis with every employee.  They're so friendly, to frequent customers and new-comers alike.  They familiarize themselves with your personal preferences, it makes for a very pleasant experience.  They know their stuff.  If I'm ever hesitant to try something new, they explain the texture of the coffee, the bean, the ice!!  They're like sommeliers, but for coffee!

The goods: I always brag about their coffee.  People offer to pick me up coffee from places like Starbucks and I always decline.  ""It tastes so mainstream"" :P.  I love watching them make it, it's like watching a science fair.  And I enjoy that it doesn't taste the same every single time.  It always has that hint of familiarity, but I think the quality comes from the practice of grinding it fresh, and it'll always have a new essence to it.  Sometimes I go to Coffee Bean and I can always count on it to taste exactly the same every single time, like it was made on a conveyor belt, which is fine; but I'm partial to the fresh surprise of Sambalatte.  There's such a huge selection and it keeps getting bigger.  The manager has added smoothies to his menu now as well.  The food can get a little pricy but if you're there for a while and Jason's Deli seems too far, their sandwiches are just as good.  I'm a fan of their lemony cupcake thingys, and I'm always tempted to purchase a handful of their truffles or macaroons.

Atmosphere: I'm home.  From the decor to the entertainment.  It looks like a chem lab/library.  Books, games, cards, laptop station, etc.  If I forget one of my books (which is unlikely), there are a plethora of other books to choose from.  I'm a fan of live music, and there's a musician for almost every night of the week.  Some could say it's too loud, but noise doesn't bother me, in fact I like that it'll occasionally drown out mundane conversations that I inadvertently end up eaves dropping on.  

I don't think you can go wrong with Sambalatte.  Whether you're going to sit and chat it up with a friend for hours and hours, or you need a quick caffeine fix before class/work, Sambalatte is your best bet.  Just make sure you leave enough time to order your drink and have them prepare it, because 89% of Summerlin will have the same idea you do.",YyGhWvyw6mjJFICgq7rUxg,1,1,5,F79_bu9y9BYMTBIfmTDEZQ

The staff is never in rush regardless if it's busy or not. They take their time on every drink maybe it's a good thing but still can't justify spending 20-30min to get my latte fix. I have to weigh my options every time I come here and decide what's important, my time or the latte. Sometimes or mostly the latte wins. It's that good.

I also got 3 maccarrons. Again, I read reviews warning that these are small in size. Ugh...these must be the smallest maccarrons I've seen. $1.50 isn't a bad price for these...they're about the same in LA. 

So with a large java chip iced blended drink for my boyfriend, a small iced hazlenut latte for myself as well as 3 maccarrons ran my bill up to $14.50! Oh lord have mercy.

Sorry but my standard for coffee is very high. 
 
To me, cooperated coffee shop like Starbucks is 2 stars ( tho, coffee Americano is fresh and actually pretty ok).

Nasty, neighborhood diner is 1 star.

Coffee at the gas stop is zero star.

Sambaratte is definitely the best place to get a cup of drip coffee in Vegas. It's fresh. And freshness is a must. You can't drink coffee sitting around for 10 minutes, you know, cause then it starts to smell bad. The 'drip-after-you-order' makes it better.

Second important thing is where the coffee beans came from. Good coffee simply comes from good farms. Beans at Sambaratte is ok, however, it is impossible to import good beans unless you travel the world to find some. 

Third is how they drip. The way these guys drip here is way too rough. Its not refined at all. They are beginners, I guess. It could be much better if they try, tho. Too bad.

I gave 4 stars because its in Vegas. 

I have been all the popular cafes in Vegas,, Even if they get 5 stars, gush, they are terrible,,, like worse than Starbucks!

I don't care if they are friendly. I don't care if they remember my name (many people here at Yelp care too much about this. If they think they are friends, they give fucking 5 stars no matter what). All I care is the taste and quality.",LwtKrQPMN78mkSIozJK3Lg,5,4,4,-rm9dg9-PyBcjgMjEGmYuQ

2837538,2011-11-19,2,rq5dgoksPHkJwJNQKlGQ7w,"Having recently moved down from the pacific northwest, I've been looking for a place to capture the coffeehouse vibe that is along every other block in Portland or Seattle.  While the neighborhoods in Las Vegas are not nearly as quirky and lined with independent small businesses or have the weirdly hot baristas with the tattoos and piercings that would ordinarily be deal-breakers for me, Sambalatte Torrefazione definitely has it's own community vibe and decor which makes it a welcome caffeinated oasis both on a hot sunny day as well as a windy overcast day.  This place succeeds on so many levels where Expresso in the SE part of town comes up short.

My first trip there occurred after work and I immediately gravitated towards the Nutella Latte.   I challenge someone to name something that doesn't immediately become more awesome with Nutella.  Nutella is like the ridiculously gorgeous girl towards whom guys are unable to make the comment, ""She's not my type"" since she is clearly everyone's type (i.e. pairs well with anything).  As I patiently waited for my beverage, I soaked in the scene with a young woman playing cover tunes on her acoustic guitar ranging from Michelle Branch and Norah Jones to Lady Gaga and Sheryl Crowe, taking sips of her latte in between and a few couches within a few feet for folks wanting the up close unplugged experience.  There were some nice patio chairs outside with umbrellas, and inside, the first floor has a bowling alley layout with a string of two seaters on your right, a nice long table accompanying 6-8 with multiple plug outlets for the studious on their laptops, and some circular tables in the middle for power lunches and casual get-togethers.  There is a staircase at the back leading to a second floor with an open room presumably for larger social gatherings, but I didn't get a chance to scope it out.  Aside from the diverse coffee and tea offerings, there was a beautiful display of pastries, desserts and colorful Parisian macarons, as well as soups/sandwiches/salads for a light meal, and a cozy little gelato bar with interesting flavors such as coconut and mango.  

When my name was called and I took my first sip, the thought occurred that this Nutella Latte should be renamed the Nutellatte (trademark pending).  Rich, creamy, and nutty without being overpoweringly sweet, I definitely plan on pairing it with one of their delectable food offerings the next time I return.  Great mix of people, servers were attentive and polite, and architecture is unique and comforting.  Bonus points for free wifi (no time limit from what I could tell), 10 for 1 beverage punchcard, and I noticed they even have their own mobile phone app available for download off their website.  Hopefully there will be more cafes like these springing up across town, but I will be totally content if this is my sole getaway to recapture my days in the northwest.",syA7uYoDjohc7gWBWaEZmw,5,4,5,rvpK-1VzIKrE69aUiT6egw

I guess I'll have to go back again when I'm on that side of town.  I also need to check out the third one on the Strip as well.",Ix4omDKVL73yL14QhIeieQ,0,0,4,Bqrv2hEIUtDcKhKNt7kDCg

2861467,2011-11-16,0,rq5dgoksPHkJwJNQKlGQ7w,"When Border's by my house closed down, I was in search of somewhere new where I could get out of the house and avoid my typical distractions. Hello Sambalatte!!!  I love this place despite the foot traffic, I still managed to get way more done than if I was at home on my computer in my makeshift office.

I ordered:  Peach Ginger Tea and a Chocolate Chip Biscotti

Pretty simple order, I was saving my appetite for Kona Grill's Happy Hour (which is a few doors down from Sambalatte), but that's another review on its' own.   

  I liked the tea.  It was my first time to have a Peach Ginger Tea fusion.  It was bursting with flavor and I really liked it.  I'd definitely order it again, but there's so much to choose from on the menu that I'm going have to wait on that so I can experiment with the other flavors of tea .  my Biscotti was not too hard or too soft.  The amount of sweetness was perfect.  I don't think I can go here without ordering a Biscotti of some sort.  It was fresh in tasting too!

Pros:
  * Jenga !  Oh yes..the classic game alongside many other favs avail.
  * Everything I ordered was delicious.  I can't wait to try the other tea!
  * The selection of tea was astonishing.  I had difficulty choosing one
  * upstairs, downstairs, and outdoor seating.
  * plenty of available outlets for use
  * clean location with an inviting atmosphere.
  * comfy couches 
  * Free wifi !!
Cons:
  * packed.  
  * small space, but they do make good use of the space they got
  *  they close earlier than I'd like.  I wish they'd extend their hours.
  *  due to the traffic, it's difficult to find a seat.  I'm still working on trying to get a seat upstairs.  So far it's been a fail.
  
Overall:
  I'd suggest this place to anyone who needs a internet access, a good tea, and just loves lounging at cafes.  Sorry Starbucks, Samba has won me over (now only if they were open later).

Tips:
 *  If you want a good seat near an outlet, go early.. it gets packed
 *  remember they close earlier than your typical Starbucks
 *  come with a friend and challenge them in a game of Jenga!",G1O-KAFicH00OW14aPfw3g,2,2,5,b7_nkOHBNFJ8IVchLH2coA

I was overwhelmed with the fresh coffee taste. This place cant be compared to Starbucks as the coffee was rich and full of body and taste.

2927162,2011-09-26,2,rq5dgoksPHkJwJNQKlGQ7w,"I love this hipster coffee joint!

I came here with a friend to grab a couple drinks and treats. They had FIFTEEN different teas to choose from, all of which were loose leaf (hell yeah). They also had a good selection of coffee drinks and a large selection of tasty looking pastries. I got a large Lavender Earl Grey for under $3 bucks which was more than enough for two people and she got a large blended beverage (I totally don't recall what it was, but it was huge) and meringue cookies for the both of us. My Earl Grey was VERY aromatic. I almost felt like someone was trying to suffocate me in a pile of flowers. That sounds like a bad thing, but I mean it in the most pleasant way possible. It was very flavorful and they served it in a French press, which was a very nice touch (just don't forget to press it down after a few minutes). The meringue cookies were delectable and came in different flavors. We both had one raspberry and one pistachio each. They just melt in your mouth; it was perfect with my tea. 

While sitting down enjoying my tea, I studied the place and noticed they have more places to sit upstairs, board games and Jenga to play, lots of outlets to plugin your electronics, a bowl of food/water for dogs, and Gelato. They have many tables that are pretty close to each other, but they are kind of small, so you could probably only fit no more than your laptop and a drink on most of them. They do have a good amount of larger tables though in case you're there to study, which would be a great idea as this place is very chill. In fact, this might just become my go-to study spot when I'm back in Vegas permanently.",AuvaQaRHBowFaFtoEMqkVg,3,3,5,uIE---NzdhM-hePAgbebeQ

Lacking; get over yourself and smile once or twice per shift. You're a barista, drop the snob 'tude!  The fact that you are working in Boca Park...that isn't impressing me either.  

A bit pricey but that's likely due to the high rent and the clientele they hope to attract. Finding a seat can be a challenge. Why? Because like most pretentious coffee houses people just sit there for hours hoping to be noticed and pretending to ""work"". Places like this really need to limit table times if you're not actively purchasing.  Free wifi can be blamed for this too, it should be free if you are actually buying drinks/food and time limited...not just camping out because you're too cheap to have wifi at home or you're hoping some guy in a Ferrari will notice you.   

The ""patio"" (aka the sidewalk next to the parking lot) is nice to have but like most Vegas patio dining areas you're stuck looking at the wonderfully appointed parking lot. How enticing!  Hey at least I can keep an eye on my overpriced exotic sport car during high tea. Yes, that's sarcasm I don't have an exotic car or engage in high tea. But you get the point.

My favorite one here is the nutella latte with nutella biscotti. It's so delicious. The tiramisu is also good but it's a bit pricey.

The negative about this place is that it gets packed very quick and it's hard to find a seat. Also, I don't really like their macaroons, it was just okay. It was dry and lack of flavors.

The idea that Las Vegas, let alone my neighborhood, would be home to a gourmet/annoying hipster coffee shop was so exciting. About a month before their opening, I saw their shop door open and lights on inside. I excitedly walked in on a crew of construction workers painting the walls. Oops.

Now that they are open, my expectations have been reached and exceeded. The prices are cheap, the environment is awesome (the upstairs tables are classy as hell), and they offer delicious, delicious espresso drinks as well as brewed coffees (rivaled only by Sunrise Coffee, and it's a tough call). I love being able to choose whichever bean I would like, and I love that they brew their regular coffee with the manual pour-over method. 

I would enjoy it if they were open a bit later in general, and the weekday hours are a bit inconsistent and strange, but I won't hold it against them. I am just so happy to have such good coffee so close to home.",BCfzyrMne5E9SKo6YT6aiw,2,1,5,6bDdpRX_fl_vCztuK4KDRQ
3014194,2015-09-12,1,rq5dgoksPHkJwJNQKlGQ7w,"I  used to dream about sitting at a table in the middle of a small, European town, tapping my feet on centuries-old cobblestone and sipping on a cappuccino with a croissant in one hand.  Today, I found the best place to make my dreams even more realistic-the coffee and food at Sambalatte in Las Vegas.

This adorable cafe is in the most unassuming building off the 215 and Jones.  It has no charm in the storefront, just tons of chairs and tables.  The windows are tinted so going through the doors is like solving a mystery.  Wanting coffee and craving pastries, I gave this place a shot.  There wasn't a huge crowd of cars parked out front, so I entered the doors anticipating a simple counter and food display-you know, no big deal.

The exterior is a lie!  This cafe is charming.  There's more than enough seating, including this gorgeous wood bar top that runs the length of the windows, a great display of freshly baked goodies (in limited supply), and a simple chalkboard of coffee and tea that they serve.  It was love at first sight. I grabbed a chocolate cappuccino, a croissant, and they heated up a turkey cranberry swiss sandwich for me.  We left with the goodies in hand.  The cappuccino was strong and smooth, with a lovely heart to start the day. 

The turkey sandwich was warm, salty and sweet, with a hint of creamy goodness from all that melted cheese.  It was filled to the brim with turkey meat, so half the sandwich was more than enough for one person.The sweet cranberries in the nutty baguette gave this sandwich a very Thanksgiving, comfort food in summer feel.  I loved every bite.

I finished off with this beautiful, buttery croissant. This croissant was flaky and just melted in my mouth.  With every sip of cappuccino and bite of croissant, I felt like my imaginary table on a cobblestone street in Europe was real.  For a second those layers of airy, chewy goodness gave me a sense of joy while it lasted.

I will always take this route to work just to pass by Sambalatte in the morning.  Not only is it great coffee, but great service and food.

She is the only down side to the place.  When the owner is present....everyone works better and are nicer to the patrons.  Clearly the food is an afterthought.

3029525,2015-06-10,3,rq5dgoksPHkJwJNQKlGQ7w,"Four stars yes, coming back? ehhh..... I'll think about it. I just happened to be passing by here again, because I was on my way back from Cafe Leone. I did not go in that one. I went in and ordered up a nutella cappuccino. Really good!!! I sat in the very last seats the ones with the bar stools. I sat there as long as I could they are super uncomfortable. Your back starts hurting after awhile. It's hard to keep an arch on your back without reclining on something. Try sitting there for two hours straight. I mean you're sitting looking at a monitor looking down and you have nothing else to rest your center of gravity. It just hurts!!

  Anyway I left as soon as I got a free seat. The ambiance really makes you want to make friends and acquaintances with people there and the staff. I think it has a lot to do with the design of the place. But in particular its because the place is spacious. I know I did say before that it was not as big as the picture pins it. It does look big, however, when you are sitting down because if you're sitting on the ground floor towards the center yes its big. I sat there in that spot for 45 minutes before I left. I just felt like I had to leave because idk but I felt like I HAD to leave. The reason I left was because I felt a level of uncomfortableness sitting there and I also felt I was taking up space. I just felt the people walking into the place with their mac books wanted to sit next to the outlet. I sat a seat away to be courtius for whoever wanted to plug theres in so I was not imposing that space, and to not feel like I owned it. But even still the people that are too scared to get near the thing were the ones that I felt that vibe from.

  I mean all you have to do is say you're plugging it in right? Or just plug it in. Aside from those people there were others that walked in in which I felt that also. It feels almost if you are there with a lap top, mac, nook whatever and are reading people judge you by giving you looks. And I mean you feel unwanted. At least thats what I felt. I guess if you aren't on your phone once in awhile, with a friend or both you get judged by other customers. I know you guys know what I'm talking about for those that have no where to study, or just need to use the computer for a good amount of time for work purposes. 

  For those that just use this place for a place of socializing and or use your mac for a brief period an hour or so you don't notice that as much. It's like our Yelp rep from Las Vegas said: ""- Once or twice during my 3-hour encampment I felt I should move to make room for additional guests, but... I couldn't do it. It was cold outside and warm and delicious inside.-"" Misti Y. Unlike Misti, I did leave because I couldn't take it anymore. You felt somewhat suffocated. It was fun until it lasted. I think I would return if they put different seats for the bar stools. At least there you can recline your back and not feel that level of hostility up in the air. The bottom point is if your going to be there for an extended period of time don't sit in between the chairs. Grab a seat with the other wifi users in the designated area, at least there you won't feel that way. Or if your back can handle it, go to the stools. I did not try the sofas or outside because I feel there is where most people socialize.

  But know this. The people that give you those looks are other much older people wanting to use there PC's around 25 and above and the snotty people that take highly of themselves. The ones overly dressed by themselves or with friends for the women. For the men it's those business suit casuals/ hipster/surfer dudes that give you those looks. The staff don't they are awesome and try to be your friend! The owner is super funny. Some customers are just stuck up, but hey thats everywhere. Next time I am up for a cool black and white movie location I will take a blow up doll, or cardboard cut out and maybe slap on some jewelry on her with while she pretends to be on her phone. Maybe THEN I can sit in peace. Man I wish I could of grabbed a seat upstairs! Anyway keep up the great work staff of Sambalatte Torrefazione! :)",un5LELsWFeTx8-B8hcArRg,3,1,4,z21MvzDSaG6vm7We6ltXTQ

I went in to study a little over a month ago. I set my stuff down and ordered my drink. While I was waiting to hear my name called, I noticed my wifi wasn't connecting. I rebooted my computer and it didn't work. I picked up my drink from the counter and asked the young girl if she could have someone reboot the router. She seemed annoyed/stressed about something, and just nodded and brushed me off. I waited about 10 more minutes... when I noticed the manager going back upstairs to his office. I figured she told him... so I gave it another sec... still nothing. I asked the people around me if they were also having problems. One girl was using a hot spot because she also couldn't connect, and the kid next to me had his own internet. I asked her again nicely. She snapped at me. She told me, ""no one else is complaining. It's your computer. Reboot it."" I told her I did, and that wasn't the problem. I also told her the young lady next to me was also having an issue. She then went on to tell me their computer system is connected to the router and they couldn't reboot because of credit cards. *its an open wifi system... no password... and they have had to reboot it twice in the past for me. At that point, I had to clench my jaw and breathe. ""You're telling me you're running credit cards over a insecure connection?"" She got quiet, told me there was nothing they could do and walked away. I spent 9.50 on a lattes...8.00 plus a tip... I didn't even get to enjoy my drink. I left it. If I'm spending GUCCI prices I expect GUCCI service. Never again. Never ever again. I did however discover the cuppa in downtown summerlin due to her inability to help me out. 

I called her manager and guess who answered the phone? Yep... you guessed it. She kept asking what it was about and I just kept asking to speak to her manager. After speaking to her manager and getting a weak apology and what felt like excuses mixed in with apologies, he also mentioned that she did ask him to reboot the router when she went up to tell him he had a phone call! 

Service is everything to me. Samba, you're lack of service and waste of my time cost me 9.50 and precious paper writing time. However, it cost you a frequent and loyal customer. I will never recommend or patronized your business.",p9942XebvxZ9ubHm4SXmMQ,10,5,1,53fBQGnXvHNWRr34l2irQw

The coffee really reminds me of coffee in italy and is no doubt is modeled after it.   

They also have some crazy cold brewed iced coffee that some don't like but I love it, it's different and worth a try.  They have some local gelato too that is like 5 bucks so if its real good that isn't too bad, I want to try it. 

Why only 3 stars, 3 reasons: 

First its expensive, a cappuccino is 3 bucks and a latte is 4.  Not some giant Starbucks white chocolate carmel monstrosity but a little cappuccino.  Thats not the worst though the pastries are threw the roof expensive, like 6.50, so a cappuccino and a pastry is 10 BUCKS.  for my wife and me a cap and a pastry each for breakfast cost 20 BUCKS the same as a full on eggs bacon pancake breakfasts for us elsewhere.  The same at coffee bean cost us about 12.

Second, I have had basically every pastry here and really none impressed me, the berry tart is probably best but I pretty much stopped ordering them and just get a cookie or something if I want something to eat with.  For the price the pastries flat out suck.

Third, the service kind of sucks.  I think they have a job requirement that you need sleeve tattoos to work here, nothing against tattoos, but it's just filled with hipsters that act too cool for school.  They are 100% not outgoing or cheerful in anyway.  I mean you walk into starbucks or coffee bean and you get greeted and smiles all the time, here not so much.  And really no friendly chit chat or anything.  In fact they have been a little rude pretty much every time i have asked a question.  They have twice given me the wrong pastries, they have been spot on with the coffee however.  

Let me reiterate this is my go to coffee shop because of the great coffee but they are pretty much the only coffee place of this kind i know of around here so they have the market cornered.",WANhIVSoD5oIIu2LfKx5Ig,7,1,3,TdF7zn2DyGI6Pn3-UmS-gA

I was never driving out of my little island to go to other neighborhoods/boroughs because there was nothing I need out of here.  Yes, I admit it, I was Southeast-centric!

Then Sambalatte came on the scene and caused me to start eye-ing ""grass on the other side"".  There are many fantastic things you'll find in Vegas that don't exist anywhere else (Cirque performers working out at the local gym are on this list), but there are not that many coffee houses that make me want to camp out all day, until now.

Sambalatte waltzed into a desert of gas station coffees and Starbucks to set up cozy shop in Boca Park (an area that tries a little too hard to be Angeleno-inspired) but I won't hold the location against it.  I just wish it was in my part of the city.  All right I'll be the first Manhattanite to want to go to Brooklyn for a coffee house.  A very special coffee house...

...one that has a bilevel interior, dark wooded bookshelves and outlet-lined desks, walls with hand-painted maps of countries from which they import their coffees and teas (coffee-countries are differently colored from tea-countries), artisanal coffee and tea drinks made with love and steam milk art, locally supplied macaroons and gelato, and receipts that print their WIFI network's daily passwords.

When I'm not in Manhattan (yes I have no shame calling Southeast Las Vegas that), find me at Sambalatte (with my Nutella Latte and Cappuccino Macaroons).",Nh75diBuPgSSBMNoT5IGDA,5,3,5,IFg3Pr_GApLcAo2bk9c8vw

3155172,2013-01-17,0,rq5dgoksPHkJwJNQKlGQ7w,"Las Vegas has a real coffee house meant for locals!! Praise be!!!

I have been searching high and low for a place like this since moving back from Seattle. Never thought it would exist. However, I visited and fell in love. Sambalatte is located within Boca Park. The owners understood their target market well to open in a location like this. Cater to upper middle-class frou-frou types because they're the ones most likely to appreciate stuff like this. *Yes. Send me your hate mail. That's fine.*

As for their coffee, it looks good. But I'm mostly a tea drinker. I ordered a few of their seasonal blends which included some chais. Very nice. Everything is served looseleaf and comes in a coffee French press. I'd rather it come with a detachable strainer so I can control the flavor of my tea but whatevers. They have two sizes for this: small and large. Although I wonder why people don't just get a small and refill it with hot water? Who knows.

Sambalatte also serves small treats like macarons. Pretty awesome although the selection isn't very large.

Overall, this is a nice cafe that reminds one a lot of Los Angeles coffee houses. You'll always find it packed with those studying, starting their own businesses, working remotely, or just idling by the day. This is the vibe I miss about coffee culture cities. Other Vegas stores ought to mimic or follow the path that Sambalatte and open up stores in other areas of Vegas more accessible from the Strip.",fHnAHkd0rNscAXlWpy7M9Q,1,2,5,sIjhl9lt0coEUpB8eBQEEw
3167500,2014-01-15,0,rq5dgoksPHkJwJNQKlGQ7w,"So, it's New Years Day and almost every place that we want to go, besides the big chains, are closed! We call up Sambalatte around 4:30 and they say yeah, we're open and will be for at least another hour or so. No big deal, we're just about 10 minutes away... well, we get there and it is PACKED! The line wasn't too crazy but they let everyone know all the orders are to-go only. Bummer for me cause I really wanted to check out the upstairs and I hate feeling rushed. Whatever, they want to get home and enjoy the holiday, you can't blame 'em!

Anyway, we just wanted some coffee and treats so were order a nutella latte, a mocha, a nutella bomb, a brown parfait and my son ordered the kids specialty drink. All of the drinks were really good, my wife loved her mocha and the nutella latte had great flavor without being overpowering. The treats though, were lacking In a big way! Unlike the latte, the nutella bomb was pretty much flavorless and was just a huge disappointment. The brownie parfait was much better but still nothing spectacular. Both of these items rang in right at around $7 too so crazy overpriced in my opinion.

The other reviews are spot on about it being crazy loud with a hustle and bustle feeling which I'm not a huge fan of either. If I'm in the area, I'd stop by again for a to-go drink, maybe try the nutella cappuccino or something else off their drink menu which is pretty dang big.

3198663,2011-11-21,0,rq5dgoksPHkJwJNQKlGQ7w,"I have been to many coffee shops. I used to be a barista for Lollicup in Pasadena and loved making smoothies and became fascinated with the world of non-alcoholic drinking. It is amazing what concoctions non-alcoholic beverages can become. The drinks here were amazing! 

Colorado River Coffee Roasters coffee is used in these delectible liquid treats. My fiancé ordered a Chocolate Cappucino, his mom ordered a cappucino, and I ordered a candy cane hot chocolate. 

We had four different macarons, pistachio, coffee, almond, and black currant.

Cappucino: beautiful turkey drawn in on top, great smooth flavor, great amount of foam without being overwhelmed. Perfect temp.

Chocolate Cappucino: beautiful heart flower drawn in on top, great smooth flavor, hint of chocolate, great amount of foam without being overwhelmed; basicallly just as great as the cappucino but with that hint of cacao. Perfect temp.

Candy Cane Hot Chocolate: three feathers drawn in on top, Ghirardelli syrup, peppermint and foam that held in the peppermint flavor made the cup lickable - delish. Perfect temp.

I am a diehard hot chocolate fan, and this was one of the best hot chocolates I have had in my life. 

Macarons: 
   Pistachio: didn't taste much like pistachio but it was still good
   Almond: Yumscious, but very sweet
   Coffee: didn't get to try it but my soon-to-be mom-in-law scarfed it down, so that's a good sign
   Black Currant: Never again, no go for me as it was not too fresh, but it's perhaps ignorant of me to order a less common flavor. I love black currant, but not everybody does.
   
Another plus that I didn't get to enjoy: As we were leaving, we saw two musicians, a vocalist and electric guitarist setting up, so they have live performances there once in a while. I saw many people on their laptops comfortably lounging, so it's a good wifi spot. Their password is ""cianorte.""",qb-8RrNbVj-3WkXYuxpi3w,1,0,5,54SoBSCnr7Ap7Xs1Swx19Q

I used to come here often to study while I was in undergrad. They have plenty of tables (cramped into a small space, but that's okay!) to work from. There's a longer table in the middle that seats about 8 with a string of outlets for your electronic devices.  There's also a large table in the cute little loft area upstairs. There are outlets on the floor beneath the table. It's a lot more quiet in the upstairs area so if you can manage to snag a spot, then do it!

Drinks are yummy here. They're quite pretty as well. I really like their soy chai tea lattes. It's rich in taste but doesn't taste syrup-y like the soy chais at Starbucks. Their Nutella Latte is alright. I don't know how they prepare it but it has a greasy feel and aftertaste. I think the Nutella latte is better served cold but make sure it's stirred well. During the summer, they have awesome ice tea mixed drinks. Definitely a thirst quencher! Their hot chocolate is rich and decadent. The perfect solution to the sweet tooth. 

The food is....eh. It's seriously overpriced for what you get. They have various wraps, salads and desert items. The wraps and salads are tasty, but dinky in size. Desserts are alright too but I'd rather go a few doors down to the Cheesecake Factory and get a hefty serving of a fabulous and beautiful cheesecake for similar prices. 

Best part of Sambalatte - in my opinion - is the live music. Let's just say I stopped studying a lot and took long breaks just to immerse myself in the performances. The performers are super talented. There is (or was...I don't know if she's still there) that used to sing and had her dad accompany her on the acoustic guitar. Super cute and super amazing. There is (or was...) an older gentleman and lady as a saxophone/keyboard duo. They play awesome jazzy music. It literally makes dance in my seat. 

This place is dog friendly as well! They have two dog water bowls outside that are labeled ""good dog/bad dog"". So adorable! There's a lot of seating outside. Perfect for a warm sunny day. If it's cold, they have warmers outside. 

Overall, I really love this place! Makes me happy and it'll make you happy, too. Happy people are good for the world.

Prices for the drinks aren't too bad, mostly ranging from $2-$4, however the dessert was a little pricey, $7 for a square inch piece of chocolate cake.

As far as the coffee shop goes, Sambalatte is great. Plenty of space for working and tons of outlets. Music is a bit loud but nothing to ruin your concentration. They even have an upstairs and outdoor seating area. 

As far as the coffee goes, prices are high and drinks are a little unremarkable. My rainbow latte was one of the worst lattes I've ever had. Besides the fantastic artwork on the top, the latte itself was almost undrinkable. It was half milk and had zero flavor. I'm not sure if the other lattes are this uninviting, but I would stay away from the rainbow latte.

3408989,2015-12-26,1,rq5dgoksPHkJwJNQKlGQ7w,"I had high hopes for this place because of some of the reviews and how the place looked upon walking in. It was packed with people and busy! As soon as I entered, I noticed to the right, a bookshelf and that caught my attention right away, I wanted to sit there and peep the books. Finding a seat here proved to be tedious considering some people took up two tables.... For the two of them only. Or that people used chairs for their bags or that both the upstairs and the downstairs sections were full.

First and foremost, this place will cost you a pretty penny. A chocolate pastry, a veggie quiche, & a Nutella latte totaled $20.00. Ouch! The Nutella Latte was nothing special, nor the pastry. It looked HUGE, so that's why I decided on the pastry, but it's basically $5 for a fluffy piece of bread with a tiny slab of chocolate at the bottom. 

The veggie quiche... Oh man. I've already found the one place I want to get my quiches at, so I had hoped that this place, being so nicely designed, would match that place. Way wrong. The girl at the register told me it's a 13 minute wait for my quiche because they're going to place it in the oven, I said okay, knowing I would sit and chat for awhile here. Once they gave me my food, it didn't look nearly as appetizing as the quiches I eat at this other cafe. I scooped a piece of it and fed it to my boyfriend who said that he didn't like it. I asked why, and he said it was cold. I then tried it and spit it back out because he was right! And I don't mean ""lukewarm"" and customers nag and say it was ice cold. No, it was literally still cold. So I told one of the cashiers and they said sorry and would get it fixed. 

She microwaved what I handed back to her and gave it back to me. Was it hot? Yes. But now I was just unhappy because it should've been hot from the start, after being in an oven for 13 minutes. And then it gets handed back to me with my pieces still on the plate and whatnot.

Not impressed. I've had way better food for way better prices. Sorry Sambalatte, this place was lacking.",abzIJZ1HBSsCh3X7xUAZ0w,7,2,2,NckQTWw-ON-OqymKkvhwPQ

Food - we got a ham and cheese croissant toasted and a quiche lorraine. The sandwich was tasty but the quiche had a weird texture. The food took about 15 minutes longer than our coffee to arrive. The food items were $7.75 and that seemed WAY overpriced since they were tiny.
Overall, I would get coffee from here again, but for a grand total of almost $27, it is so not worth it. I left still hungry and was not nearly satisfied. For that much I can go get my grub on at The Cracked Egg and leave stuffed with a good cup of joe.

If you're coming here there is a strong chance you are here to try their signature coffee--the nutella latte. I heard about this place after reading a breakfast edition of Desert Companion and decided they were worth a shot. It's got a really cool interior that screams of a European style and the free Wi-Fi is no problemo.


Let me start this off by saying this is probably the snootiest, snobbiest coffee shop in Las Vegas. But honestly, if anybody has the right to be proud of their coffee, its them. The wealthy new money as well as a multitude of students can be found here on any given day. Good luck trying to find a seat on a weekend or holiday-- the interior including the upstairs cove fills up regularly. The basic concept is trying to bring the European coffee drinking experience to America with all the american advantages--namely portion sizes and prices that are much more agreeable. If you're the type who splurges on venti starbucks on a regular basis--- my only question for you is why aren't you spending the same money at a place that strives to create the best coffee experience they can? They have french presses and all other manners of flavor enhancing techniques. The drip coffee is excellent here, and is prepared in the old fashioned manner. Try the guatemalan roast.

I also had the opportunity to try a kettle of their chai masala and it was definitely well seasoned. 

The highlight of my time at this place however, has to be the time i spent consuming the nutella latte, which I found to be rich in chocolate flavor with a smooth buttery finish. It's perfectly sweetened and presented with a beautiful decorative flower swirl at the top of the mug. The nutella gives the late a distinctive flavor that cannot be replicated by one of the common mocha frappes out there. The coffee itself has a deep, bold flavor that I absolutely love.  If you're a fan of dark beers and coffee and other strong flavors, you will be able to appreciate the contrast of the strong flavor with just the right amount of sweetness that requires no additional sugar packets. I highly suggest you try the drink hot as it is intended before going into the iced stuff because you will get a much better appreciation of its flavor. 

The vanilla latte is also excellent and far superior to anything you can get at the corporate places.

In terms of technical prowess and all out flavor, I must say this earns my respect as the number one coffee destination in Clark County, hands down.  Foodies and serious coffee drinkers, you have found your garden of eden.",U4ERp63gvcIeOis8UdtxvA,1,0,5,0MbL3PAcfsUD7T6phWfwcA

Usually I order their hot teas, which are served in tea presses. Some teas are geared towards ""boosting energy"" or promoting ""relaxation."" I'm unsure if I've ever felt energized or have experienced any positive side effects, but each of the teas I've tried  have a pleasant taste and aroma. Even if tea isn't your thing there's a variety of coffees on their menu. 

There are sandwiches, desserts, and pastries that can be ordered at the counter. The egg salad sandwich is tasty and so are the desserts like the Tiramisu Dome.

The shop is a narrow two-level space. It's a popular spot so finding a seat might be tough. On the first level, you can plug-in your laptops and other devices at a workstation bench. Upstairs there's more seating. There's not much room there, but it's perfect to hangout at with a small group of friends. If the weather permits, you can sit outdoors. Sometimes, musicians will put on performances either inside or outside of the cafe.

When you walk in, you'll feel like you're in San Francisco or maybe even Seattle. There are little tables and chairs in one section, comfy little couches in another and upstairs as well, and a small section of chairs lined up on a table that has outlets for you to plug in your laptops.

There is usually someone singing and playing live music, which I LOVE. The first time I visited Sambalatte, there was a singer playing the guitar and singing--his voice sounded like John Mayer's. He was great!

The coffee is delicious, and my boyfriend, being the coffee connoisseur that he is, fell in love with the place and its coffee immediately. I've had a chai tea and mocha cappuccino there. Both were sweet but not overly sweet, and creamy. However, the cappuccinos are huge and maybe not a good idea to drink if you're lactose intolerant. I can usually handle a regular cappuccino, but I may order soy next time I drink a Sambalatte cappuccino.

Not only do they serve coffee, but also little sandwiches and salads as well. I ordered the turkey and swiss, served on ciabatta bread and had a bit of cranberry in it. Yummy!

It's a great place to relax, sip a nice cup of tea or coffee, maybe read one of their many books that they provide, and listen to live music. It can get a little crowded and I imagine as the word continues to spread, it may be something I'll have to just stop into and order my coffee to go, which I'll be sad about because I love listening to live music.",mYcRL0cJtHeXRBup5wwppQ,2,0,4,q-c65N86gEKretDXEQ9nRg

The place is very cute. It's got an outside patio and an adorable upstairs area. There is a huge table in the front where you can bring your laptop and chill out. There were a bunch of tables (small tables so it got crowded with stuff quickly) and chairs so seating wasn't a problem. (at least when we got there, it was definitely getting crowded by the time we left).
The selection of pastries and salads and sandwiches was quite nice. Presentation was lovely. Where my WHOLE problem comes into play is the taste/price point. As I said, I was in Sicily where a cappuchino, is cheap. So, a $3.75 cappuchino is MORE than Paris. Whaaaaaat. Honestly, it was very small and didn't taste great. I ordered the Nutella cappuchino and didn't taste anything remotely like Nutella. I ordered a chocolate croissant and 2 macaroons. $4.25 for croissant and $1.5 EACH for tiny macaroons. Total price: $11.00. WHAAAAAAAAAT???????
The croissant did not have that buttery I am in love flavor. It didn't taste like it was bought from Alberstons, but it didn't taste of love either. The macaroons were Ok, but again, just got home from Paris, and these didn't taste like them at all. My biggest complaint is really the price. I feel it is exorbiantly priced. Even if I hadn't gotten home from Sicily or Paris, this place is crazy! A fruit salad was $8.00! Come on! I get it that your in the Boca Park area, but really? I review all places based on THREE things; quality of food, price of food and service. Service was OK. Had this been a $5 breakfast, I would have given 3 stars.

Sambalatte is a busy and popular coffee spot. I meet up with friends here some mornings and getting a place to sit inside or out can be challenging depending on the hour. Some of the tables outside have an umbrella that can be adjusted when the sun hits your face. The patio is dog friendly and there is a community water bowl, but I pack my fur kids bag with her water bowl in it, so we use that. Inside there's a long table and charging station, several smaller tables and a reading area upstairs with places to sit. You order and pick up at the counter. Staff is friendly and helpful with going over menu items. 

Ham and Cheese Croissant ($9.50) - This looked so good in the glass case on my first visit that I had to try it. I liked the taste of it so much that I ordered it again on my next visit and I will often order this item so long as they have it available. It's served warm and the ham, cheese and croissant all have good flavor and compliment each other well. This also comes with a side of fruit. 

Blueberry Muffin ($3.75) - I love me some blueberries, but sadly they were lacking from this muffin. The muffin itself was moist yet bland. There was just 4 blueberries on the top, I guess decoration, because it certainly didn't indicate that there would be any blueberries inside the muffin since there were no more blueberries to be found beyond them. I was disappointed to not have some of the berries throughout the muffin. 

Banana Bread ($4.50) - I'm not sure how long they keep pastries in the case here, but my banana bread didn't taste fresh. It just wasn't worth the price tag. I'm glad I liked the coffee and ham and cheese croissant so much because the blueberry muffin and banana bread left little to be desired. 

I've had the Chai Latte ($5.50), Red Rock Latte ($6) and White Chocolate Raspberry Mocha ($5.75) so far and all have been tasty. I was really impressed with the coffee here and can only hope that one day there will be a Sambalatte location closer to my side of town.

Their drinks are always piping hot and made immediately after you order them. Sometimes when you order tea, they are able to prepare it immediately while you're still standing at the register.

Sambalatte,  you just lost another fan.

We enter at around 7:40, peruse the menu, and place our order for a Chai Latte, and a Butterscotch Latte. The Asian woman at the register says ""We're gonna serve you your orders in our take out cups, is that okay? It's an hour before we close.""

Whoa...

First of all...you close at 9 pm....that's not an hour before closing...second of all, telling  customers that it's ""the owners' policy"" and that ""people like to hang out after closing"" tells me something else....you are lazy, you don't like to do dishes, and you're making up your own policy in order to not have to clean up as much after you close. If this is in fact the owner's policy, its STILL a dumb rule!

Sip, Savor, Socialize, right? isn't that what you advertise? We still could've sipped our lattes from a mug, savor our lattes from a mug, and socialize while enjoying our lattes from a mug. We were done by 8:40 pm  which obviously gave you enough time to clean dishes! A person came in asking for the wi-fi code at 8:45 pm, plopped on the couch, and started doing work. I thought you were closing soon!?!? I thought you don't like when people ""hang out""!?!?

Sip! Savor! Socialize!

I drove ALL the way across town yesterday just to try this much talked about place!

May I be honest?  Well, the good first: Upon approaching the lovely shop, I see many, hip, stylish folk enjoying the sun as they sip on their latte... So, I walk in and, Wow! I immediately love it here & wonder, why, oh why, do we not have one in Henderson / Green Valley area?  I mean, we are hip too! At least, I am! :)   The decor, the music, the people, the vibe - All Tops!  However, since I did not have time to stay I decided to get a Fazenda Lagoa to go.  I was all excited to sip the hot, dark liquid and then... the unexpected happened --- I tasted filter, I tasted the filter that they poured the espresso thru... now, I do not wish to be unfair - so, I tried again and again and still the same yucky filter taste... am I alone?  I really wanna love them...

Well, anyone who knows me - knows that I LOVE Coffee! There is no doubt about it!  So, with that being said... I will give them another try and take the time to savor the ambiance and the java...  I look forward to another visit and the ability to maybe socialize and blog my little heart away for any number of hours...

I have the feeling that sneaking away from the humdrum of work will be well worth it! 

Cheers!

I wanted to get the delicious looking fruit salad, too, but it was $7.75. Double eep! Not a budget-friendly coffee shop.

The croissant was, I'll admit, a fairly good imitation of European croissants. However, it, too, was pricey, and not as delicious as I felt it could have been.

(Side note ""Torrefazione"" means, roaster or toasted or coffee roaster depending on where you look, but you get the idea.)

I got there early and decided to get the cheese plate for us, as she's always wanting it but never gets it so I thought it would be a nice surprise.  Turns out the cheese plate rocks it. We got the one with the Blue cheese, Brie, Swiss and I think it was Manchego or a Gruyère, not too sure, both seem to have the same kind of bite to the palate to me. It came with a side dish of a few crackers and toasted bread, some walnuts, grapes, blackberries and dried cranberries. The Cheese was fresh and they were good cheeses, great strong flavors to compliment on the coffees taste. (I uploaded a pic of it.)

I have to give this place 5 stars, as We go there a lot and never have had any problems, they generally in the evenings seem to have some musician(s) there, last night was a girl singing with guitar and she was really good. The other day was a small group, 1 female vocalist, 1 vocal/guitar player and a cellist (The cellist rocked it by the way.) 

The staff is always very nice and they recognize my girl and know her name since she is always going there and has been since shortly after they opened. 

Lately it has been a little more crowded, and they added extra seating which at times makes it seem ""tighter"" in there but all in all it is an awesome place and all there coffees rock it. I keep trying new flavors have yet to have anything that did not taste good and you really can tell the differences in brews. The regular large coffees are 2.50 (various flavors) the cheese plate was 12.00. Seriously not bad pricing in this place.

Hope some of you give it a try, it is well worth the visit.

The sweet treats in the window look INCREDIBLE but I'm yet to try one. I also like that they have some Knights iced cookies as we're in the final right now, very relevant and a nice touch.
I can however vouch for the toasted sandwiches on the menu and the croissant - they are both delicious! The sandwich especially. Very generous with the fillings and great dressings too! The almond croissant wasn't as warm as I'd have liked it when it arrived so I went to ask them to redo and they were very good about doing it straight away for me.
The only bigger criticism I have (not that they can really do anything about it) is that there's never enough seating, especially upstairs.

I was just kind of brushing her off because I had already tried macarons from Patisserie Manon, which is actually not too far from here. Well we were already on this side of town so we said, why not pay Sambalatte a visit. Just as everyone says swank coffee shop in the heart of the Summerlin. My first time we came on a Saturday night and there was a jazz duo playing. Very entertaining especially since I played in a jazz band myself when I was in high school. My friend ordered the nutella latte and we both shared the raspberry macaron. It was a sharable size since it looked like a macaron woopie pie. It was very delicious, I liked the fact that this size was available since most macarons are the size of a half dollar. I read in another review it feels like a coffee shop you would find in California or New York, which is so true. I thought it was cool that there was a upstairs area. This is a awesome spot for studying, but too bad they close early on some nights. On my second visit it was more recent because my cousin follows a Filipino movie star on IG and saw that she came here. Well it intrigued her to try it and she brought the rest of us with her. This time I ordered a white chocolate mocha latte and pistachio macaron. The white chocolate mocha was alright, but I did enjoy my macaron since pistachio is my favorite. We came at 9:45pm very near closing, so all of our drinks came in disposable cups, my cousin was kind of irked since she wanted it in a cappuccino cup.

Service is plain disappointing. Employees lacks care and there are no genuine service provided here. I hate that they rush me to order every time.

For the record, I've tried their teas and coffees. For its pretty price tag, drinks are mediocre at best. I would rather go to other coffee joints like Dutch Bros or Desert In Roaster for much better coffee. 

One thing I do like is the live performance, though their microphones are sometimes set at really high volume which personally makes it difficult to get any work done. Seatings are limited which also makes it difficult to find the space to do any work.

Beautiful location. Check.

Warm, inviting atmosphere. Check.

Enticing drinks and treats. Double Check.

We came here last Sunday and were so impressed! It was the perfect way to start off a relaxing Sunday off!

Chai Latte- 5/5 I was dissapointed that it didn't come with a cute Latte design on top but they explained its because of the way they mix the chai with the milk. either way it was delicious. Not too sweet and had just enough spice to wake you up!

Lavender Latte- 4/5 This one did come with an adorable Latte design, but I felt like the Lavender was very very faint. It was still a really good latte but for those of you who have tried the Strong lavender latter at say Bad owl will be left wanting more.

Lemon Square- 5/5 Perfectly made! Not overly sweet like some are, and not too tart either. It was a very balanced little refreshing treat!

Berry Tart- 5/5 Perfect combo of fresh juicy berries and sweet cream!

We went upstairs to enjoy our treats and coffee and before we knew it we had spent almost three hours enjoying the great coffee, conversation, and music!",oG9VFtr_ye8v2tDnS3NOYw,10,6,5,1un2GEMWmRDo5yWHZKW_Ow
4052448,2013-03-14,7,rq5dgoksPHkJwJNQKlGQ7w,"There's two sides to Boca Park. You have what I call the Charleston side and Tivoli Village side. That's how I describe a location of a place when I'm meeting someone out here.  The Tivoli side houses the best of the best..REI, Cheesecake Factory, Kona, Embers, and Sambalatte.  You'll find a busy parking lot and even busier establishments. Smack in the middle of these establishments is Sambalatte. You can't miss it. Just look for a bunch of people outside enjoying their company and a cup of joe.

Took me awhile for this review for a couple reasons.  First, I've never tried any of their food or treats. And second, I've never took advantage by hanging out long enough. Okay I lied. I once sat in here for about 3 hours while a friend did some shopping. I got tired watching her shop so I found myself at the Starbucks then migrated here.  This place has wifi and wished at the time that I had my iPad or laptop. I kept myself occupied with their iced mocha's, which is a good change from a the hot ones. Their iced drinks are perfect on a hot Las Vegas summer when caffeine is needed. Their mocha's are creamy and doesn't hit you all at once. I love a strong coffee, but not so much a strong tasting one. Their mocha's are exactly this. As for the my other choice, it's the good ol' Americano in the AM or an iced one in the afternoon.  

The ambiance actually changes throughout the day and even the week. I'm almost always outside, but also look forward to take advantage of their desks and tables inside.  Service is a bit slow compared to a SB, but that's expected here. Their drinks are served in glasses, not disposable paper cups. This means you're meant to stay and hang out.

With a nice selection of pastry and sweets to satisfy even the most hardcore sweet-tooth, this coffee house competes well with the eateries surrounding it. Last time I was in they had a nice acoustic band playing a little quite music, it was a nice change from a cd playing.

I came here this morning for a business meeting. I was impressed when I first walked in the door. This feel different than Starbucks, the only coffee shop I am familiar with. Starbucks is more preppy than this. Sambalatte feels more traditional and homey. I don't feel out of place here. There are some small tables around the ground floor. Looking up I can see there is a loft area with more tables. It isn't terribly bright in here. This feels like a place I don't mind sitting in for a while. Its a good thing too. I was here for over two hours this morning.

Like I said earlier, I don't typically drink coffee. So I focused on just the tea menu today. It was a toss up between green tea, white tea and Earl Grey. I like them all. I was leaning towards the Earl Grey so I went with that. A good strong black tea for breakfast. I ordered a large thinking I would get something like a 20 oz styrofoam cup with a tea bag. At $4.50 I have my reasons for staying home for my tea. Much to my surprise, that large tea came in a large glass pot with a press (French Press tea?). It was loose leaf Earl Grey at the bottom with a plunger and filter plate up top. The more I pressed the darker my tea became. By the time I was done I had poured out approximately six small cups of increasing strength. Fatastic. This was strong tea but not quite as bitter as some bagged tea that I've had. It was smooth and invigorating with that distinctive Earl Grey flavor. I hope you tea drinkers iut there understand what I am talking about. Earl Grey is difficult to describe.

Anyhow, I had no complaints paying $4.50 for this tea today. It was quite good. Service was friendly and fast. And I did not feel pressured to leave after sitting there for nearly 2 1/2 hours. In fact, I wanted to leave because sitting thers so long was making my back hurt. If there is one complaint I have today it is that the small tables with 3 or 4 chairs each are packed tightly in this place.

Often times there is a live music performer.  Our only negative is the music is sometimes way too loud, making it impossible to carry on a conversation.  When the music is toned down and in the background it is a perfect setting.

You may find it hard to get a seat.  This place is popular.  Downstairs seating goes fast.  There is some limited 2nd floor seating as well as outdoor patio seating.  The are numerous places to plug in your computer while you sip your coffee.

So stop in for the best cup of coffee you will find.  Latte's come with foam decorated for the final touch.

The barista that made the matcha wasn't sure what proportions to add the ingredients and didn't even attempt on the pour. Half the joy of a 'high-end' coffee shop is the presentation. 

I waited until several customers behind me in line had already gotten their drinks to ask after my iced coffee.

I needed to find an escape from my current surroundings, coupled with jolts of caffeine on demand. Thanks to word of mouth and the wonders of social media,  I was able to find Sambalatte Torrefazione. It had everything that I look for in a coffee shop, and then some.

Upon walking in, I was welcomed with soothing live music from a local pianist. Such sophisticated sounds instantly triggered my simple mind into productive mode. 

Their coffee and tea menu were very extensive; something I need to delve more into for my next visit. I was happy to see that almond milk was available for use in their lattes. At the moment, I just needed a cheap slap in the face with caffeine, so I went with a simple cup of coffee. Apparently, the stuff is ground and made to order, so the even a simple cup of joe is not ready instantly. I didn't mind this, since I planned to sit here for a good amount of time.

There was plenty of seating, with power outlets available at every corner of my eye. I situated myself at a small table for one against the wall. This was a place that welcomed caffeine fiends, as well as their electronic companions (free wi-fi)- a place perfectly situated for me.

The coffee was very good. I didn't have to mask it's flavor with loads of sugar and cream like this other place I frequent (*cough* Starbucks *cough*). It was very sip-able coffee, which was exactly what I was looking for. This all definitely helped me I zone out to the readings that I needed to catch up on.

Yeah, the price is a little more than the usual coffee place, but Sambalatte Torrefazione offers more than the usual: Live music, top-notch quality ingredients, real mugs (for indoor sipping), and a very welcoming and modern ambiance.

There is outdoor seating, so you can people-watch. Sambalatte is bookended between Kona Grill and Cheesecake Factory. So don't expect anything super sincere/ indie (""authentic"" via the HROs). If we're talking auth, I feel like Sambalatte is kind of a step between a Starbucks and that dirty coffee house you go to for spoken word. 

One thing I liked about the space was that there's all kinds of little niches you could sit in. There was a small bar with outlets, the tall-backed chairs for couples, one large group table (large being about six people), and the outdoor seating. You can pop in and order a coffee or you can camp out for a few hours. 

When I went, there were at least four girls working front of the house and three in back but the line still moved hella slow. But the girls were all cute. Not that I care, but I'm sure there are people out there that go to coffee houses for eye candy. Oh, am I mistaken? Well, then. Disregard. 

They have a glass case of pastries and truffles and nut & fruit platters and crap. Just sayin': I'm pretty sure most, if not all of the prepared food is outsourced. I think the fruit & nut platter is a great idea for a social setting like a coffee house. Skål on that. 

It seems like for every con of this place, there was a pro to cancel it out. Read on. 

My chai took a while and I appreciate that it was freshly brewed. But seeing as how they gave me a small French press-style setup, I should have gotten it way sooner. The barista (or whatever they're called at this type of establishment) also offered me some sweetener in the way of agave. Sweet. 

I was conflagrated to see there was a loft. But when I got up there, I saw it was a really small and narrow space, just enough for three parties of two or four individuals cramming for finals. The shallow loft was redeemed by the free wifi. 

What I wanted (importance on a scale of 1-5) - did I get it: 
the scent and bustling sounds of a coffee house (3) - check 
populated to ~50% capacity (1) - check 
clean bathrooms (1) - n/a (did not investigate) 
authenticity (4) - null
wifi (5) - check
coffee/ tea (5) - check

In all, Sambalatte is a decent venue. As much as I have negative to say, there are more positive things about this place. I'll be back many a times.

4293807,2014-08-04,1,rq5dgoksPHkJwJNQKlGQ7w,"I was on the fence for a 3 or 4 star, but the atmosphere put it over the 3 and into 4. 

This is what I think a coffee shop should be. It was a fantastic environment, tons of people hanging out on computers, beautiful decoration, relaxing music. There was also a surprising amount of seating (though most were taken) including outdoor seats!

We got some iced coffees for a very reasonable 3 bucks each, and we also got a pear Danish and 3 of the sausage egg and cheese on an English muffin sandwiches. 

We actually really enjoyed everything! The sausage egg and cheese didn't blow me away or anything, but it was good. The pear Danish DID blow me away, and was much cheaper than the egg sandwich. 

That's why I took a star off... The price. I love the environment, they have some seriously great coffee options, and the food was good....but those small egg sandwiches were 8 dollars each. Same with their baguettes, many were 10 dollars! For a tiny little half looking sandwich! That plus the fact that they don't label things with prices (other than on the menu behind the cashier) makes this a dangerous place to order freely. Some drinks can be 6 bucks while other are 2. 

For 4 people we spent about 40 bucks. Not terrible, but not cheap. We definitely enjoyed the ambiance, and I will 100 percent be back if only to sit on my laptop and have a 3 dollar ice coffee!",x-W0OQiUdNLsoMhg6GfXSg,3,1,4,IBk4LT4SH-QJY_8agPHSNg
4294785,2011-12-16,2,rq5dgoksPHkJwJNQKlGQ7w,"Wow! Last time I was in Vegas, I was looking for something a bit different from the normal Starbucks or major chain coffeeshop that seems to infest that town. I consulted Yelp and found Sambalatte. Then, I chatted up a local and guess what? They recommended Sambalatte as well!

I had my car, so in I popped and off to Sambalatte I went. And let me tell you, it was totally worth the drive! 

There's a large outdoor patio, perfect for lounging with your pooch on a chilly winter day. There's a spacious lounge area near the door, plenty of tables past that, and an awesome bar area. To top it all off, instead of trying to ignore the folks with iPads and Laptops, Sambalatte totally caters to that audience by having an ""electronics bar"" with plenty of plugins. This actually works out as I saw many of those folks interacting with each other instead of sitting alone. 

Now, let's chat about the brews. They roast their own, seasonally. I tried the Sumatra, a darker blend. The best thing? You can choose a 16 oz cup!! 

As someone who frequents Intelligentsia Coffee in Los Angeles, I know how to brew good coffee. And these folks do it right. It tasted delicious.

Please come to Los Angeles - you'll be SO POPULAR!",-c9G-JHNqrPY0_UU9j7BJA,3,2,5,sHDEKU2vHJcCmbYsLsnYhA
4303731,2016-08-28,0,rq5dgoksPHkJwJNQKlGQ7w,"Just moved to east Summerlin from Hawaii, and as a college student and self-proclaimed coffee addict, finding a good coffee shop to study at was one of my first priorities. Found this place on Yelp, so I stopped by for a study sesh. Found it easily, and was pleasantly surprised by the size and decor of the place! Quite a few outdoor seats, lots of tables inside, an upstairs area with comfy chairs, a bathroom, free wifi, live music and, in my opinion the best part, lots of outlets near each seat! It was pretty busy when I got there, at about 3pm on a Monday, but my boyfriend and I were able to find seats. 
I was pretty hungry when we got there, so I ordered a turkey swiss sandwich. My boyfriend and I are dessert fiends, so we also ordered 5 macarons (black currant, raspberry, coconut, caramel latte and mango). I ordered a hot green tea latte and my boyfriend got a hot nutella latte. The macarons were good; pretty sweet and filling. The drinks were brought out to us in cute latte mugs and they both had amazing latte art on them! I was impressed by the latte art. The sandwich took about 10 minutes to come out. It was good, but kind of small. For all the food and drinks, I paid about $30...a little expensive, but thats how most cafes are. We spent about 4 or 5 hours there doing homework. The wifi was a little slow when we first got there because it was crowded, but it started to work faster after an hour or so. It was a little chilly, so I'd recommend bringing a jacket. Even with a live musician, the place was pretty quiet and it was easy for me to focus on studying. The only issue with this place is that it closed pretty early, so I was a little disappointed I had to take my studying over to Starbucks. Overall, it was a nice place and I'll definitely head there to do homework in the mornings and afternoons!",2iMyNWQ5t97zqrgY97uzMg,2,5,5,qnphZUcFOdMt6NfaQt1ffQ

I walked up to the doors at 7:00 a.m. - expecting them to be open.  An employee walks through the doors into the location (for what I am guessing was their shift) - doesn't say anything or acknowledge us.  At 7:02 a.m., I decided just to open the door and walk in.  The employees behind the counter looked at my as though I was doing something wrong.  They were still counting their cash drawer and were not even ready to take my order.  I asked them if they were open.  The employee behind the counter states ""I'm counting my cash drawer"".  I told him that I would just hang out on the side - no problem.

I originally scoped this beautiful upscale coffee house in the hopes that I'd find a good place to study. But because it is a well-known meet-up point amongst chatty coffee drinkers, don't expect to have much quiet time if you're not one who can handle distractions while studying. I do highly recommend Sambalatte however for their robust coffee flavors, unique teas and live poetry and music performances. It is a great place to meet with friends and use your laptop~ so overall:

ATMOSPHERE: As described above, great for hanging out with friends and listening to live music on their TWO floors. Too loud for quiet studying or at least bring your headphones. Beautiful and modern coffeehouse interior. 

FOOD: Gotta say, the hot drinks are much better than iced. I've tried the Nutella cappuccino, Nutella latte, iced matcha latte, flat white, iced latte, two types of biscotti, panini sandwich and their Magic Chocolate Box. All delicious! Didn't care too much for the panini or the iced matcha which was a little lotta too sweet.

SERVICE: Always friendly, but keep in mind always busy! So don't expect for them to spend too much time catering to you because #1 they already know the coffee is good #2 its too busy constantly but amongst all their running around, they still manage a smile =)",W5GNz_rDc9r37Uav1mdocg,5,2,5,7Oo3_wh2zz4qcKkXCTnuzw

Not so regular since they have various blends of coffee that give unique flavors served in french coffee press. My boyfriend's fav is their anniversary blend. Their dessert is to die for!!! Oh my!

4415465,2011-08-01,0,rq5dgoksPHkJwJNQKlGQ7w,"A friend and I visited Sambalatte because of the stellar reviews. Over one hundred enthused customers can't be wrong. And they weren't. Sambalatte is such a beautiful concept and flawlessly executed, Starbucks could learn a thing or two. 

I enjoyed their selection of authentic South American coffees and even though it wasn't a large selection, it was top quality. Their knowledgeable staff could help choose a brew or take home coffee that it right for your tastes. 

The building is beautiful, clean, and homey. There was live music in the evening and we, being upstairs, were even visited by a barista who took our dishes and asked if we needed anything. Fabulous!!!! 

The only downside is the nearly torrential flow of customers. We lucked out with a great place to sit, but it was packed during our entire stay. Not enough of a con to take away a full star. I actually wish places like this success and having a full house is a great sign of profitability. 

I've read negative reviews highlighting the lack of seating, the price, and the taste of their food/beverages. I said my bit on the seating issues, and I feel like the price issues are completely unfounded. Consider the source of their coffees, teas, and pastries. They do not use low quality ingredients and ethically source their beans. Even the coffee giant Starbucks has had to raise their prices because their high dollar contracts with suppliers doesn't save them that much money. 

And then the taste issue is annoying. If you like caramel frappe's and frappuccinos with extra caramel or mild coffees with eight sugars and extra cream... wrong place for you. McDonald's is right around the corner. Please don't write reviews on this place based on an uneducated palate. However, if you enjoy chai, lattes, hot teas, espresso, cappuccinos, and high quality sophisticated treats, this is a place that will lift your soul. Still don't believe me? Try the iced chai and apricot tart and get back to me. ;)",UcR01xQcUpF0ZqkAvwO2Nw,1,0,5,PD-o5-IQoJiFQgwjilBgWA

I came here on a lunch break. surprisingly their was 20+ people inside and outside on patio. Half appear to be studying, the other half are having business meetings or just enjoying their lunch.

It's beautifully decorated with a large map highlighting where coffee is grown. It has a nice balcony with books available for borrow. I sat here cause no one else was up here. 

I had the Nutella capachino. It was so sweet and delicious. 

I was good and didn't have any of the pastries, but they look so yummy! Maybe I'll given in and have some next time.

The atmosphere is great. The staff is very friendly. They have tables with power outlets and plenty of seating crammed into a small space, which is good since it was really crowded when I went in at 10:30am. There is also seating upstairs. I didn't go up there, but I hear it's fancy! 

I ordered a vanilla latte and a butter croissant. The latte was amazing. The espresso flavor definitely stood out but wasn't overpowering, and the vanilla didn't get in the way of it. Definitely a good coffee-to-vanilla ratio thing going on. The croissant looked and felt a bit crunchy on the outside, but once I tore a piece off it was pretty great. Nice and flaky on the outside and moist on the inside. Very tasty. I was watching them brew some coffee while I was waiting and it looks like they grind the beans for each cup individually right before brewing. Nice touch.

With so many different coffee and tea drinks to try (not to mention all the food items!), I'll definitely be back. If you're reading this, you're probably looking for a good coffee place, no? Stop reading and go there. Seriously. Like, now.",yQSb5pj4tXzslWlgysqhzw,0,0,5,4CVp2e66RS33jVQydszTgw

I still haven't tried their savory bites, but they look good. My only gripe is the prices are a bit expensive, especially just for a drink and dessert. But if you feel like splurging, it's totally worth it.

It's the nuances that elevate this place to five stars:  the interior decor, congenial staff, and presentation of food and beverage.

One thing I love to do, whenever I travel, is find a local coffee house and go and support them.  I found Sambalatte on Yelp and ventured out to find it.  It is a bit of a drive from the strip, but so worth it.  It is located in on open shopping area but parking wasn't so bad since it's not really a mall.

When we walked in, the place was packed.  The seating reminded me of New York, very close together.  There is a large communal computer table which looked like it could be fun to hang out at.  We ordered cappuccinos to go thinking we couldn't find a seat, but we did score a couple of chairs on their small upstairs balcony.

I bought several bags of coffee: Brazil, Ethiopia, and Honduras.  I'm drinking the Honduras as I write this and it is very good.  As I was waiting for our coffees, I believe their roaster was there or maybe it was a new roaster they were considering.  I would have wanted to get in on their tasting.  One of the workers was brewing different beans and they were tasting them.  Looked like fun!

I love the vibe of the place!  The manager/owner sure knows his coffee.  If you can get a table, it is a great place to chill for a bit.  I would never come here to work or read, but coffee and conversation is a must.  I will definitely come back whenever I'm in town.

The ambiance alone is worth an entire review but, i refuse to tire your eyes on my useless ramblings of the wood tones, beautiful library-sheek furniture, and just plain wide open head space.

The real reason I'm writing this review is because I have had a recurring dream about Samba since spending a month back home in September...and only the good places make you crave in the unconscious. THE main craving involves my very first meal getting off of the mid day flight. I say meal because I indeed ordered five ""courses""...and it took everything in me to share each one of them. 

First, the Nutella Latte was unbelievable: espresso was perfectly cooked making it VERY balanced, NOT AT ALL bitter, and nutella just complemented it so well *le sigh*.

Next was the ham and brie which came on a fresh baguette of crusty goodness. I ended up chopping up in thirds to share...but inside i wanted to break out a whip and back out the door with it (That's right, an Indiana Jones reference. What of it?). 

Last and definitely not least...dessert. Samba has tons of confectionery creations but I went for the most eye catching ones: the chocolate caramel pyramid, the cascade, and tiramisu dome. All practically melted onto your tongue with the least of chewing effort possible. the pyramid is by far the best dessert i've ever had in Vegas, hands down. 

Samba is another one of those great finds tucked away in Summerlin. I feel so freaking blessed for living roughly...2 minutes from here. Now...if there would only be a way to convince the owner to open 24 hours a day...I would literally quit my job tomorrow and live full time in Las Vegas...It's THAT good.",YDkC5VVT8s9NlIZtAr8NUA,0,0,5,3UhyusRkh1GynDG0oswSzQ

Sambalatte is, by far, my favourite sit-down-and-talk spot in town. With great live music, a diverse blend of menu choices, magazines, friendly baristas, board games, it creates the perfect ambiance to simply kick back, take a sip and unwind. 

I may not be much of a coffee person but I see to it that everytime I do get a chance to stop by Sambalatte, I order a nice helping of deliciousness. Their tahitian latte, served cold, was absolutely amazing! At first it may seem a lil' more priced than the more commercial starbucks but try it first and see yourself wanting to go back the next week! 

On some occasions, they have open mic sessions for live music. We caught a live jazz duo playing smooth jazz fusion and a thursday night with John Colombo who, by the way, has an amazing repertoire, even accepts requests! From folk songs to disney classics to contemporary hits, he's one to look out for if you ever decide to stop for a visit.

Are the lattes beautiful? Totally. Do I need to hear the entire story behind your single origin coffee? Not really. Also, let's talk about the food...their ""light fare"" is certainly priced as if it is much more than what it is (just saying).

When you walk into Sambalatte, you get that feeling that when it's your turn to order, you're going to choke and end up ordering something you can't pronounce or (in my case), a $6 pour over that takes 15 minutes to make...but just tastes like coffee. I once asked if they had sugar free syrup and the look I got from the barista made me feel embarrassed to exist. (For the record, they do NOW carry sugar free syrup, a year or so later...so clearly that overt judgment was passed over many others over the past year as well.)

I'm still rating Sambalatte 3 stars and here's why: the lattes and cappuccinos are legit and the ambience (once you have your $8 latte in hand) is really nice. They do have a small outdoor patio if you can land a spot, but the inside seating area is delightful as well.

Their menu items look delicious but as someone who deals with food sensitivities I can't have anything they offer. I did ask about allergy free options and the young lady behind the counter said they are looking into it, they just haven't found anything up to their standards yet.

I have been in Vegas 6 years and longed for a coffee joint that is NOT Starbucks or CoffeeBean. I found Sambalatte and have been in heaven ever since. The atmosphere is welcoming and homey. There is a great upstairs area that is good for bigger groups, but I prefer to sit outside. The staff is so friendly and very helpful. The coffee? Delish!!!! Creamy and not bitter. And served with pretty coffee art. I have only had the macaroons and the quiches, but I can say both are phenom!!!! The quiches are buttery and flaky with just the right amount of egg and fillings. I have had the veggie and Loraine, though the veggie is my fave. And the macaroons are bite size with just the right amount flaky crunch before you sink your teeth into the gooey center. 
     At this point Sambalatte is by far my favorite coffeehouse in Las Vegas. It is such a delight and I am so happy to have found this gem. Enjoy!",f3ptgbODfNoKMDnSxOCj8A,2,3,5,lsaL43UcQVLiNPHTibvm3A

As for the coffee, I would highly recommend their Ethiopian and Guatemalan coffees. I tried their Nutella cappuccino and it was pretty good as well. Not quite as flavorful as I expected, but still good. 

They also have delicious iced teas!  Very refreshing on a hot summer day.  They even serve them with a fresh flower in them. Such a nice touch!

The crustless egg white veggie quiche was good, but not great. One of my favorite food items would have to be their fruit salad. My friend tried their croque monsier and he was highly impressed.

As usual, the place has all the appearances of a pleasant cafe in which to work. However, there were a couple hiccups. 

1) They haven't updated what appears to be a chalk menu in several months. I remember trying to order the iced lavender earl grey months ago and being told they no longer have it. Again, I was told the same thing (since I forgot I had tried to order it before). Instead, I ordered it hot. I was told it would come in a French press, but instead it was steeped in a teapot. (Which isn't a big deal. Just a bit strange).

2) The staff was friendly, but the two genteman seemed like they need a bit of extra training. They didn't seem to know how to make the coffee pour my friend requested; instead, they just said they didn't have it. And when he got a French press coffee instead, they didn't bring him the French press either. They brought it in a large mug. And unfortunately, the coffee was burnt.

3) We ordered a BLT sandwhich. It was premade and merely reheated. The quality was so-so. The grainy bread was a nice choice. But I recommend that a cafe of this appearance should at least prepare sandwhiches fresh. 

Overall, the 3 stars is for ambiance and decor. It's not a bad place to work or hold a small meeting.",ADNLYx9DMGoGPhZvnviTag,2,2,3,6d0bh9Ccqv6rDxig5TtLPA

The staff tried to appease me by saying that they did a refund, and that it was on the house. I liked the texture of my quiche. The crust was flaky and the filling was creamy, but it was really salty! I ordered pistachio, cappuccino and almond macarons to go. They all had nice and chewy consistency which I like.

My sister ordered a dirty chai latte, and it was way too bitter for her tasting. They gladly replaced her $5 dirty chai latte with a Nutella cappuccino which was a $3.75 drink. When a customer is not satisfied with a drink, shouldn't you replace it with something of at least EQUAL value? 

I ordered the Nutella cappuccino, and it was a horrible mistake. For $3.75 my drink came in a little tiny teacup. Two of three sips and then it's gone, and it wasn't even that good. I couldn't taste the Nutella in my drink at all, and I didn't bother trying to replace it because my sister already asked to replaced her drink and I didn't want to seem like a bother.

So far, I've had one of their mixed berry tarts and their Italian sandwich.  Both were warmed up for me.  Really nice pastry on the tart and the berries had that nice combination of sweet and sour that I like.  Most places oversweeten the berries or just put them on fresh.  Sambalatte did a good job balancing the flavors.
The sandwich was nice too.  They put a nice olive oil on the bread - the oil was such good quality I checked the sandwich to see if there was olive in there.  Very nice ingredients, nice bread, and it was warmed just right.
Also have had their Arnold Palmer lemonade they keep in the fridge towards the back.  That was really tasty.
Have to say...I always wondered where those clothes you see in fashion shows were worn.  Always assumed people would wear them to parties and red carpet events but always wondered who wore those day to day - especially outside Manhattan, London, or Paris.  I wonder no longer - they all go to Sambalatte at 3 pm in the afternoon on the weekday.

I have never tried any of their food items because they are overpriced, however I always wanted to try a macaroon or two.

The BF got a white latte with half caffeine and this was a solid latte, definitely well made. I got the nutella latte and while it was a good cup, I didn't detect any nutella flavor in it at all.... was it forgotten perhaps? 

It's a solid beverage, but I'm not sure if I quite like staying here. I wanted to drink my latte and get the fuck out.

It means they are successful and the coffee is good if they're busy, but I think I'll enjoy it to-go next time. Picky? Maybe, but like I said I rarely get to drink coffee so it should be a overall experience to really get me.",n86B7IkbU20AkxlFX_5aew,6,3,3,VkHxRE6yzA1QSfi98AFAiA

The plaza that it is located in, is your one stop shop for getting coffee, buying wine, and trying on clothing.  The coffee scene in Las vegas is saturated with Starbucks, i was happy when i discovered the independent Sambalatte.  In this 2 floored coffee shop, there isn't a shortage of seating, both indoor and out.  With their full and extensive menu, all of your coffee needs are fulfilled.  I ordered an iced caramel latte, which with the las vegas heat, was totally satisfying.  As good as the drinks were, their macarons were excellent.

When I was there, they had a Jason Mraz-y guys singing with his guitar.. he was actually really good.  Made us sit there longer than we expected.

Its slightly pricey in my opinion, but its good.  I'm not huge on coffee or whatever.  The Nutella latte was strong, but tasty.  I can't speak to the other drinks there... but I did notice they had a large tea selection.  Looking forward to my next visit for a Chai tea.  I got a macaroon too... kind of pricey at $1.25 each?  I don't know, maybe it's because I'm so used to stuffing my face with them at buffets.

Anyway, the place is awesome.. there are board games in the comfortable upstairs.  I could picture myself sitting at a table playing jenga with friends for awhile here.

5083576,2013-09-19,1,rq5dgoksPHkJwJNQKlGQ7w,"Sambalatte is one of my favorite places to lounge, drink coffee/tea, converse, or catch up on some reading.  Before you walk in, there are tables outside, often occupied, with people studying, sipping, and staring. This prepares you for what is to come after you pull the door open to enter the place.  On a Saturday afternoon - evening, you will most likely encounter a crowd of people doing the exact same thing as the people in the front.  One thing that is different, though, is the ambience inside, with canonical books and well-known magazine publications on their shelves, the humungous map of coffee-bean cultivators of the world, and the occasional independent musicians who perform there, playing originals and syncopated notes from a trumpet player to cover-songs of Abba on a violin and Bruno Mars sung by a hipster with his acoustic guitar.  Yes, I go here for the performances just to enjoy my coffee experience, sometimes. 

The line to order doesn't take too long.  The same goes for the wait to receive your order.  Besides drinks, you can also find sandwiches, quiches, macarons, cookies, and all types of desserts here.  As far as drinks, I almost always get something cold and anything with Nutella or Matcha Green Tea.  A few days ago, I had their Matcha frappe - and it made my whole weekend.  The tea had a hint of savoriness, perhaps the matcha powder gives it this kick, which was great alongside the subtle sweetness.  The iced-nutella latte - needs no explanation.  I will tell you that they smear nutella on the sides of the inner cup - yes.  

I currently live in the Southwest, so I was happy to hear that they are building a Sambalatte on Jones and the 215.  

Overall, if you want to get a well-rounded coffee drinking experience, then go to Sambalatte.  Make sure you go on their Facebook and check out the upcoming artists, if you want to check them out live.  If you want to study and drink coffee, and don't mind people talking around you, then you can study here too (there is a large study table with a several outlets you can use to plug in).

I work and write at my best in comfortable environments and Sambalatte has a cozier feel than your run-of-the-mill coffee chain. It doesn't hurt that they're in the heart of Summerlin so you can do some of your best people-watching here. They're indoor-outdoor setup is excellent for socializing and studying alike. The co-working table downstairs is outlet-friendly and has the best lighting for reading and working. They also have a small upstairs area and a patio to sip alfresco. 

They have a high quality bean selection to choose from. Plus, you have a choice of a ceramic or paper cup to-go. Their rise to fame is the Nutella Latte. A few others spots in town make it but Sambalatte certainly makes it the best. Their baristas seem to be well-trained and really know how to operate those fancy expresso machines to their maximum potential. Nothing is worse than milk that resembles stiff soap suds. 

They have an excellent tea selection of white, black and green teas. They're definitely quality and not the generic Tazo stuff. I do have a gripe with the fact they won't re-steep. The customer is always right--right? If a paying customer wants hot water, they get hot water? I'm no tea expert but my STI-certified friend said there's nothing wrong with re-steeping. The leaves will emit a different flavor but it all depends on personal preference. Even the tea snobs do it at least once. Now, the question is are they out for $$$ or do they truly believe that tea leaves should NEVER be re-steeped...

SERVICE is less than satisfactory. I haven' t had a pleasant experience dealing with the people behind the counter. They're either socializing with each other or working too slowly to satisfy the occasionally massive line of customers. If traffic is slow, they're generally not at attention to take your order. Because waiting 5 minutes for someone to take your order is acceptable here.

(2nd floor is small, but if you can get a table up there, it's cozy & a little quieter. I prefer it over the 1st floor which can get loud & hectic when it's busy.)

I first came here (in 2010? 2011?) to try the Nutella Latte...and it was delish! I've had a few of their other coffee drinks, smoothies & teas which are okay. I had the macarons (have had better) and a few of their desserts and they were okay as well. None of the food were mind blowing or unique. Most memorable is the Nutella Latte & Nutella Cappucino. 

I've been here several times, it's my favorite place to meet up with friends and colleagues when we're working on a new project or event. 



A few other good things about this place: 

- They have cute bookshelves with a variety of games & books you can read while you're there. 

- some nights they have live music.

- *** Another favorite thing about this place is that most times I've been here I've randomly started conversations with some fascinating and ambitious people here. 

- fave meetup spot with friends who live on the north or west side of town  

- I have brought all my out of town family and friends here. They're always excited to try the Nutella Latte.

- outdoor seating 

- doggie water station outside! 

- the long table with outlets for those who want to set up camp and get some work done. 

- the world map on the wall with all the places coffee is grown.

- And best of all....The Vibe. The decor and ambiance makes me feel like I'm in a real coffee house in NYC or Cali.

As for the coffee. I like the big mug it comes in and its presentation. But in all honestly, I've had better coffee/hot chocolate/matcha latte's elsewhere.

The only thing missing here is an overstuffed couch and more space to accommodate the coffee-crazed Boca-neers (my new nickname for people who look like they belong in Boca Park.) Once or twice during my 3-hour encampment I felt I should move to make room for additional guests, but... I couldn't do it. It was cold outside and warm and delicious inside. 

If you are ridin' solo, you are in luck, as there is a large table with numerous outlets for you to plug in and knock out some computer work. There is also an upstairs with a large, communal table and some additional seats. However, groups of 2 or more may struggle to find a comfortable spot depending on how busy it is. The bistro tables are a little small, definitely not 2 laptop friendly. However, both times I have been there, I have had no inclination to get work done! It is too friendly inside to hide in a computer screen. I never even tested the free WiFi even though I had my computer!

As for the liquid refreshments, I have been on a Nutcracker kick sampling both the mocha and the tea. Both were quality. The coffee is roasted locally, which is a nice touch, and I am impressed that they have a full tea menu in addition to the extensive coffee delights. Often times tea gets overlooked. I haven't explored the pastry counter, but if looks could kill, you wouldn't want to gaze too long at those windows of decadence! 

I think they should work on their delivery system a little. I never knew if I should stand around waiting for my drink or wait for them to call my name or... maybe I am easily confused. I felt a little goofy because I would sit down and then get back up and then sit down and... it was a caffeine waltz of sorts. 

Still, Sambalatte delivers a delicious product in a cozy atmosphere, a rare treat in Las Vegas. If you see me there, don't expect me to get up any time soon.",qewG3X2O4X6JKskxyyqFwQ,21,18,5,i9IXrk7azwDSz4W2unXbKw

If you bring your puppy, they provide a watering bowl outside in the seating area, so very convenient when casually taking the day in with one of your best friends.

Well. 

This location was very different.  
First of all they were PACKED, inside, outside and upstairs.  Luckily, it was only going to be me, my fella, and one other reader, so I found a cozy spot upstairs, got settled, and then went down for a drink.

I ordered a chocolate cappuccino, and 2 almond macaroons.  
It was about $7 with tax...still a little pricey, but when I got upstairs and took a sip and a bite, I was happy. 

The cappuccino had a great flavor, and while they could have mixed the chocolate a tiny bit better, I was really pleased.  

The macaroons were light, airy, and amazing.  

Fella got a ginger peach hot tea.  He enjoyed it, but the girl did not give him enough tea leaves in the press of hot water...it was REALLY weak.  Next time, we will have to be more vocal about needing more leaves, as he mentioned it, but was ignored.

My service was friendly.  Fella's not so much, but I'll let him write his own review.

First thing first I enjoyed the ambiance, the interiors are well planned and opened. They had a good singer and everyone seemed to be enjoying themselves in the great afternoon, the pastries and food menu seemed very appetizing. But the rest is not all that great, we went about ordering a specialty coffee, an iced hazelnut latte with some small pastries.  The coffee was ok in flavor and nothing all that special, the hazelnut latte seemed to lack flavor and was not well made after a few sips we stop drinking it. The pastries were bland and honestly I've had better at my local starbucks. 

The pick up area for the drinks did not give me confidence either anyone could just walk up to your order and spread any amounts of germs and bacteria without any of the employees having any idea that this sort of thing matters when it comes to your food and drinks.

My hot drink is rather delicious, with a faint hint of caramel and espresso while the veggie quiche was very good. I frequent Sunrise Coffee quite a lot and if I were to compare this drink here with my usual caramel macchiato at Sunrise, I think Sambalatte's caramel latte tasted like it may have more caloric content. So if you are health conscious like me and only like one particular drink, maybe it's better to opt for the one at Sunrise.

If I ever find myself in the NW area of Vegas, I am definitely stopping by here again and try the salmon quiche plus a caramel hot espresso drink!",f0TN5yZ7JBMKIzr3hSuwFQ,1,0,4,AOfk4Al3aAi-HtoeLtIgkg

Located in Boca Park and representing one of the best artisan coffee shops in a city where such places are only now beginning to emerge Sambalatte was self-selected as an ideal meeting place with my Real Estate Agent early Friday morning, a substantial departure from his suggestion of the Starbucks just down the street but one that has since 'changed his whole approach' to coffee (and given me a great place to relax, drink good coffee, and enjoy the free wi-fi.)  Featuring a large, open floor plan with both patio seating and a loft filled with books, lounge chairs, and a communal table plus an impressive selection of scratch pastries and house-roasted coffees predominantly hailing from Central and South America ordering decisions were placed squarely in my hands, the subsequent 90 minutes covering a good variety of cakes, cookies, scones, muffins, and Viennoiserie plus the shop's oft raved Nutella latte which is every bit as good as the rumors.  Speaking to the quality of the pastry much of what we tasted at Sambalatte was well made save for an almond croissant literally oozing with frangipane and a caramel macaron that had clearly been refrigerated, but taking into account the price none were truly 'rave worthy' save for the blueberry riddled scone and complex Craquant de Cuba which managed a delicate balance of decadent and dainty; each layer presenting something new and the sum far greater than sum of its parts.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,1,2,3,t8GUVuoajUdviY9Jp77qHQ

Besides the lack of cultural diversity found in most coffee shops, sambalatte offers a solid and quality coffee experience. It really is a tried and true coffee shop.

I can't give it 5 stars because it is overly priced, it's in Boca Park, and it doesn't offer a variety of other collective-ness that coffee shops (being around the world and US as I have) offer. (The Beat, in downtown LV, is still the only legit coffee shop we have in Vegas.)

5324299,2016-10-11,0,rq5dgoksPHkJwJNQKlGQ7w,"Coffee:
The coffee consist of the very traditional coffee shop fare with a few twists on nutella capuccino. I like that they have pour overs on select beans and that they serve their coffee in real cups as opposed to paper cups. My only complaint is that the coffee just doesn't come out hot enough in their pour overs. I like my coffee steaming when it gets to me. This coffee is definitely not that. Flavor is nice and the beans usually have a good selection of body v. brightness etc. Unfortunately, you don't have much time to enjoy it before your coffee goes cold.

Pastries:
The pastries are not bad though not amazing. I highly recommend the linzer cookies though at $2.50 a pop for a small cookie it is rather steeply priced. I have tried multiple items here including their soups an quiches. Overall verdict is that it is passable but rather disappointing given how expensive each item is. 

Atmosphere: 
Very cool vibe. It is a very traditional coffee shop that I could definitely see as a ""third place."" Nothing like the tiny cookie cutter coffee shops that permeate the strip malls out here. If you're looking for a place where you can sip and bask in the atmosphere, Samba totally delivers. The chairs are comfy with books shelves and a giant map of the world. Music plays at low level and the hum of activity permeates the air without overwhelming. The only thing I wish it would do is perhaps choose music that didn't thump as much, but other than that definitely a place I would recommend if you want a unique place to enjoy your coffee.

Anytime I'm in Boca Park and need a coffee this is where I stop. They have a good selection of drinks to choose from and have a cool chill environment.

They offer cold brew in bottles that they say is done fresh every single morning which I find hard to believe. Whether I'm in Vegas, New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco, or Europe  every other high end coffee shop (meaning non chain like Starbucks) offers fresh cold brew or fresh iced coffee. Sambalatte are the only ones who bottle the way Starbucks does which has most people believing that they sold out and it's mass produced just like Starbucks, with preservatives just so it lasts in the fridge or on a shelf longer.

I had a large cup of coffee earlier in the day, but had some time to kill. Instead I went with a Ginger Peach Iced Tea and a couple of macarons. I had originally wanted to stop by another pastry shop, down the street, but they are closed on Mondays. Bummed out, I thought I was settling, but they provided some tasty versions of this treat as well. I got one pistachio and one mango. They were both soft and moist on the inside, but the latter replicated the feeling of biting into a piece of fruit so well. I was impressed with both of my choices. My friend had bought some cappuccino and chocolate ones. She loved them, even commenting about how the second one reminded her of a soft brownie. Besides the usual coffee and pastries, Sambalatte offers some delicious looking savory items. I must come back for a meal and that infamous Nutella Latte.

The place is very cozy, beautiful decor all around, even the floor concrete had a cool design. The bathroom was very clean as well. The staff was friendly and prompt, and as soon as we set down outside my friend said, ""wow, this place feels very european!"" All of a sudden someone addressed us with a very heavy european accent - it was their server, making sure we were all set to enjoy our coffee. He turned out to be from Europe and was super nice to take probably 8 pictures of us (with 2 phones). 

Now... the coffee we ordered was ""Nutella Latte"" (we asked for most popular); came out beautiful and in a large cup! We also ordered two pastries: a muffin and an apple danish. My bill for two cups ($5.50 each) and pastry was $17 with change. $5.50 for a cup of coffee is very expensive! But I decided that it was worth it based on the ambience of the place... they did an excellent job decorating and finding authentic decor pieces to display around the register. BUT once I tasted the coffee, it was lukewarm. I was very surprised because every time I order a latte at Coffee Bean or even Starbucks it is always very hot. The taste of my Nutella Latte wasn't anything special at all even though the name sounded very delicious. 

Anyway, we enjoyed our treats and a good conversation on their patio for about two hours and at the end when we were leaving my friend never mentioned anything about the coffee even though she told me she really enjoyed the pastry. I can only assume that her latte wasn't great either. Long story short, YOU PAYING $5.50 for a cup of coffee at Sambalatte is basically you paying $3.50 for lukewarm but beautiful large size latte PLUS $2 for tips already included like in some places in Europe.... At the end of the day, Sambalatte reminded me of France... pretty, too expensive and overrated!  I think Coffee Bean's latte for $3.50 tastes way better and is easier on your wallet especially when you invite a friend.

This place is located in Boca Park, for sure one of my LEAST favorite areas in Vegas, but I still head over from time to time to have a latte here because it is simply the best.

When you walk in you can almost sense the hipster vibe that is starting to manifest. However, if you ignore most of the other patrons and just enjoy the ambiance it is still a great experience. Sometimes they have live music, some guitar playing or light music in the background.  I don't mind it but sometimes those guitarists are a bit overwhelming for a calm coffee sipping experience.

Now on to their coffee. Most places carry B or C grade coffee. Think starbucks carries B grade so mostly everywhere else is C grade. Sambalatte carries only the best, imported beans and they know their stuff. If you have questions or want something special they probably have it or can help you get it. They are very knowledgeable about their product-something most other places aren't.

I slowly became a coffee drinker since the winter in SLC was pretty long and chilly :) I was introduced to this great coffee shop called, 'Salt Lake Roasting Co.' which is located in downtown area. I loved this place because of their cozy atmosphere and the great taste of coffee. I am very happy to find out that Sambalatte is opened in town :)   My favorite aspect of Sambalatte is the atmosphere!!  Just like the one(SLRC) in SLC...The downstairs is a little bit bigger than the upstairs area (loft style, big wooden table with a plenty of comfy chairs & sofas, board games, books, magazines, & new papers are available to use). There are various sizes of tables you can set up on free wi-fi as well, awesome!! 
If you are a espresso drinker, I recommend a 'Affogato with Vanilla Gelato'-it's simply put, a shot of espresso with a scoop of your choice of gelato in it.  I usually get a regular coffee(Sumatra) and it is divine! When I order my coffee, the barista pours water over the coffee bean grounds, stirring them, and pouring the water (A hand drip coffee, yay :P)  But more importantly, the service was out of this world. All the staff were friendly, nice, and helpful. They also provide you a drink card (ask a barista before you pay). It is a great local coffee option if you want to do your work or hang out in a relaxed atmosphere.  You don't get hassled or interrupted.",h0wxG2EiDLhgKjIzI8j2Mg,12,11,5,hwelByTItJ10xAErYRZfkA

Great place to also chill with a laptop(free wifi) and ""study"" with a drink and maybe a snack. 

Sambalatte would get 5 stars if they fixed their food side. I would like it if there were signs so I could see what so-and-so is.

No matter what your agenda, Sambalatte has only one goal: serve you great coffee and comestibles at decent prices in an inviting atmosphere.

The science-fiction-esque cold drip, hourglass-shaped gravity pots are not only fun to watch but make a damn fine cup of coffee, too. It's something you can't rush, however; give yourself plenty of time to let the coffee brew; it takes about 10-15 minutes just for the coffee part, not including the setup and delivery. Three to five cups of coffee in each one (depending on you and how you consume or doctor your coffee) make it worth the price.

I also loved the Nutella Latte. Not too sweet, the flavor was a well-balanced mix of the Nutella flavor we all know and love (and if you don't, we can't be friends anymore! ;)) and a rich coffee roast. Perfect.

The teas are bold and fresh, too, and I particularly liked a green and black blend (unsweetened) that I had. Pair it with some fresh fruit (either a cut plate or whole) and you have a fantastic Vegas summer snack.

The cheese plate was better than some high-end establishments I have frequented, quiches are light on texture and heavy on flavor, and the desserts are... diabetic coma, anyone? You can share any of it, the portions are that good (and, let's face it, the more you share the more you can order and taste!).

The rating comes from amazing experiences every time I go. It is worth all the we're-in-Summerlin-we're-exclusive hype? Nope, not at all. It's mostly hype... 

... however, look past that, over the heads of the wannabes and the want-to-haves (there are always a few, people watching is GREAT!), and you find some fun, engaging, coffee-loving folks who enjoy patronizing even more fun, engaging, coffee-loving folks who make great drinks and tasty, fresh food for any craving. 

That is what makes this place awesome. Add to that reasonable prices, live music, cozy decor, and a good location, and it's definitely worth it.",O9qq7z1dgyTi1bxdEIoVJA,1,2,5,bnRE379awg9lnp28qw_kUg

5620337,2014-01-23,8,rq5dgoksPHkJwJNQKlGQ7w,"It makes me sad to write this update, but it has to be done.

My very good friend Brenda celebrated her 50th birthday yesterday and she wanted to do two things to celebrate it:  have her favorite VPN pizza down the street at Village Square and then have her favorite chocolate cappuccino here at Sambalatte.  Simple, right?  Well, no, apparently not.

Anyone who knows me knows that I've been a big fan of Sambalatte since it opened.  I've been coming here for a while and I even introduced Brenda to this cafe and to my favorite drink, the chocolate cappuccino, which then became her favorite drink.
Now, I'd noticed already on prior visits that if you arrive close to closing time, your drink will be served in a to-go cup, which I thought made sense because they were about to close in a few minutes.  However, we arrived at precisely 7:54pm and they were closing at 9:00pm.  When Brenda placed her order, she was told that her beloved chocolate cappuccino would be served in a to-go cup. 
 ""Why is that?"" Brenda asked.  
 ""Because we're closing in an hour.  It's the owner's policy,"" replied the Samba lady.
  ""OK, but it's 7:54,"" Brenda replied. (We know this because the three of us all checked our cellphones right then.)
 ""It says 8:00pm on my clock,"" ""says the Samba lady.
  ""OK, but it's only 7:54pm AND it's her birthday,""  I chimed in.
  ""Sorry, but it's the owner's policy.  We can't change it. If we serve the drinks in the porcelain cups, people hang around.""

Is this not a cafe?  If we wanted to-go cups, we could have gone to one of the chains.  If you don't want people to ""hang around,"" why are you in business?  Is it too much trouble to wash your cups at night?
Now we know.  Brenda placed her Sipping Rewards card on the counter, we turned around, and went to the cafe at Tivoli Village.  They served us pleasantly and Brenda got her birthday chocolate cappuccino just like she wanted.
This may not seem like a big deal to anyone but us. Brenda just wanted to enjoy her drink with the leaf design and hang out for an hour as she's done on several prior visits.  There are lots of people who love Sambalatte as I have. They won't notice that they lost us as customers. I get it .  But, you don't treat loyal customers like that, especially if they're my friends.  End rant.",7Oe6ikklTjVBbEFw9emLcA,30,10,1,jvJ3QGJKMzJhD4Ij3uvgQQ

5659204,2014-03-26,8,rq5dgoksPHkJwJNQKlGQ7w,"I have been hearing about this place FOREVER. I had a professor at UNLV that just raved about this place, so much so, that people did presentations about this place in his class. Yeah. 

This morning, (3/26/14) I accidently got up an hour early to make it to my gym class, only to remember that it started at 9 AM. It's located at Flamingo and Durango, so I decided to grab some coffee. I couldn't find any place that was open driving up Durango, so I pulled out Yelp and saw Sambalatte was nearby. 

I thought the place was closed because the windows had the blinds drawn, as the building faces east. I went up to the door and that's when I saw that there were people inside. 

Sigh. I was dressed for my workout and everyone else looked like they were about to broker a real estate deal. Great. While everyone else raves about how people bring their computers down here and work, I absolutely hate that people do that. Coffee shops aren't mobile offices. When everyone is writing their ""Great American Novel"" or intervewing a prospective nanny, it's nearly impossible to 1. find a seat 2. relax & enjoy your purchase.

I ordered a large black iced coffee and a spinach & feta crustless quiche that is maybe 4 inches in diameter. My total came out to $11. I was trying to figure out why it was so high until I saw that these quiches are $8 a piece. I told the cashier to take it off my order, plus it would take over 8 minutes to heat it up (according to the cashier) and I didn't have time for that. I don't care how you market yourself, a quiche smaller than my hand isn't worth that much. Value is always an important quality to me.

My iced coffee, was basically a large cup of ice with some coffee added in. The coffee - wow. Acrid & almost green tasting, like it had notes of grass. Terrible. There's no milk or half and half at their bar, so I couldn't cut the bitterness.

It is really long inside, almost like a hallway and there isn't a ton of seating. There are about 3 tables upstairs, 2 booths in the front, and a mess of tables in the middle. There is one long table in the middle section with tons of outlets for the computer crowd. Of course there are a few tables outside with umbrellas, weather permitting. Despite the size, it is very inviting. There are also a few magazines and books around, which I truly appreciated. There is a giant map of the world on the wall with certain countries in color, I'm assuming they are countries that supply their coffee but I'm not sure. I was wishing it was a little bit bigger inside, but we ended up scoring a booth up front which worked perfectly since we had our 7 month old with us.

I got my staple, a chai tea latte, and my husband went for the Nutella latte. The chai was subtle, yet delicious. I kept identifying flavors every time I took a sip, lemon? chamomile? So delicious. My husband liked the Nutella latte and we both loved the mugs. I also got a carrot muffin and it was so yummy. I would order it again in a second! My husband got an apple tart, essentially a mini apple pie. It was good, but not worth the $7.50 price tag.

The location, ambience, drinks, pastries..... Perfection!
The iced coffee here can be made from a drip system.... Fresh tasting and the bean is divine. Buying a bag of whatever roast they have out will set you bag a cool $16 though. Is it worth it? To me, totally.

lattes and pastry. Both are terrific. Coffee is specially good, nearly spectacular.  One of the best I've had in Vegas. Beverages are very are well crafted. Kudos to the baristas. 

Service is great and very helpful. A while ago, I was interested in buying a grinder and received very good tips from one of the employees. He even showed me the different kind of grinds and the products. Since then , I have home-brewed and gradually bought decent equipment. 

For something different and delicious try the hot spicy chocolate with whip cream. Lattes are my favorites but ""cafe con leche"" is also quite good. 

As far as I'm aware, in the southwest part of the city, there is no other coffee shop that can touch Sambalatte.",2Qc7AAk2xQhxKrD7cJ3kxg,1,0,4,o5KJYHExnAyVek8q1gYjrw

It was kinda bitter for cold brew and I make cold brew at home so I was completely surprised by the quality for almost $5. If I typically buy cold brew, I would think it would like it be on nitrogen tap or have amazing flavor to the coffee.

Hey Peeps - and they also have afgato (espresso with a scoop of ice cream, vanilla or chocolate).  Love, even more so.

5924278,2012-11-25,0,rq5dgoksPHkJwJNQKlGQ7w,"Location: Meh. Nice looking place, Boca Park, but I can't stand the uppitiness of the majority of patrons here.

Ambiance: Cute, but way wannabe-fancy-er than authentic-feeling. That probably comes with the Boca Park territory, though.

Drinks/Food: Excellent! Both my coffee drink (an iced cappuccino -- or iced latte (we'll discuss in the next section)) was super tasty, with just the right amount of smoky, roasted flavor, and the quiche Lorraine was delicious!).

Sustainability: I likes that they use actual cups/glasses/silverware if you're staying there to consume your tasty loot, and I loved that their to-go containers/bags (which I *eventually* got... read below story) were recyclable/biodegradable.

Service: Not awesome, but not the worst either. The big, bearded dude making drinks was awesomely friendly and non-hipster-douchey (refreshing in these sorts of places). However, the girl who took my order had no listening skills whatsoever. She also wasn't very friendly. It wasn't that she was UN-friendly, per se; it was more like she was on narcotics. Blank stare, no emotion. Eh, whatever -- I digress.

While in line, I had looked at the board behind the counter and picked out an iced cappuccino, which was said to come in either 12 or 16 oz, and a quiche Lorraine (they had a few different yummy-sounding quiches, soups, salads, and maybe also sandwiches. For once, I wasn't in the mood for a sandwich). I asked for the 12 oz iced cappuccino and a quiche Lorraine, and I specified that my order was to-go. The big, bearded dude leaned over a bit and gently corrected me, ""We do have an iced cappuccino here, but we just call it a latte. Also, it only comes in 6 oz."" I stared confusedly back at the board, then back at him. ""Ok, that's fine. I was just looking at the board, I've never been here before."" He said something else in reply that I couldn't hear, but it had a kind feel to it. I didn't feel like arguing over what their own menu said, so just I made sure to reiterate that I'd like it iced and to-go. The girl rang up only the coffee and asked if I wanted anything else. I again ordered the quiche Lorraine and again reminded her I wanted them both to-go. She took my payment and thanked me. I went to go wait.

My iced cappuccino/latte came out first in a normal glass; a different girl brought it out, so I'm sure the order-taker did not actually mark my order to-go. I asked the drink-bringer if I could get it in a cup to-go. She looked at me like I should've said that when ordering, but changed it out without a word. The order-taker comes out from behind the counter around 10 mins later with my quiche on a regular plate with silverware and walks right past me to where the tables are, saying ""Veronica?"" I called over ""Um, I'm right here."" She handed out the plate to me. I try a different tactic. ""Could I please have you put this in something for me so I can take it with me?"" She looks at me blankly with the same you-should-have-specified-that-before face the other girl had and said, ""You mean to-go?"" I'm quiet for a good three seconds. ""Yes,"" I reply with my best equally blank face. She disappears for a while and then reemerges with my quiche, nicely packaged in a to-go container and bag. I smile at her and thank her. She appears about the same as usual.

Summing it up: A tasty, though frustrating experience. You come to a local coffee shop to relax & get good service. Sambalatte failed me there, but I'm definitely willing to give them another shot. (Woah, there was no pun intended there, but now that I see that it could totally be an espresso pub, I'm still leaving it there.)

UPDATE: I received a Yelp message from the business apologizing for my experience, which I appreciate. He also gave this comment and asked that I correct my language, if possible: ""I believe the languague narcotics it is strong and offensive for a drug free work place. As well, we check background of our Team Members."" I would like to clarify that I did not intend to accuse the cashier that day of actually being on drugs; the language used was simply meant to be analogically descriptive. I will leave the original review as-is to preserve artistic integrity, but I did feel it was important to make that clarification, as politely requested.",g1YLVOwquTJ5ILeWIwqW9Q,0,1,3,f7VmscYCEVd1DzFT0s-rfQ

I am sitting at the communal table with my laptop and iPhone charging, using their free wifi so that I can complete this review (and get some work done too).  But, the upstairs seating and outdoor tables are packed as well.  

I have been here three times now, ordering different drinks each time.  I am a huge fan of the Nutella latte (decaf for this preggo lady) and the Iced Green Tea.  The Chai Tea Latte, however, which is usually my ""go-to"" drink was a bit too spicy for me though.  Perhaps that is how it is supposed to be, and I have just grown accustomed to the milder versions.  I'll stick with the latte and green tea in the future. 

I also have a sweet tooth so I appreciate all of the decadent pastries.  So far, I have tried a Pear Tart and the blueberry scone- all of which were excellent.  A little on the pricier side, but the perfect accompaniment to my cup of joe. 

However, I think the main draw that has me coming back is the atmosphere.  I telecommute for my job, and I'd rather work away here, than in the solitude of my home office. But, I am looking forward to coming in the evenings (leaving the laptop at home) with hopes to check out some musical talent.  It's a perfect place for a date, a group of friends, or even solo.

Whenever I've gone, there's always been a line and finding somewhere private to sit can be difficult.  The food has always looked so delicious behind the glass case, but their food is a tad pricey.  I've always considered their food a ""look but don't touch"" kind of deal.  Maybe one day I'll justify paying ~$9 for a tiny little quiche.  For now, I'll stick to their coffee and tea as a splurge.

I love the presentation at Sambalatte.  The teas come in their own little presses, there are signature drawings in the foam of your latte, their food is beautifully presented, and the coffee shop itself is comfortably adorned.

The nutella latte is rich and creamy, but make sure to stir up your latte.  Nutella, as most know, is really thick and can tend to gather at the bottom of your cup.  If your latte is missing that hazelnutty sweetness, try stirring it up!  The teas are also wonderfully brewed and taste clean and crisp.  Whenever I order a latte or tea, I never need to add anything extra because they're tastefully delicious on their own.

Overall, although it's a tad pricey and has recently become very busy with people from a diverse age group, I still enjoy coming here each and every time.  You pay for what you get, and the drinks are really of a high quality.",V93YZAMFAF4eejiIPRs0zw,3,0,4,92EnCXBC5b1RQCFDkRAqhA

Worst service I've ever received here.

I promptly sent a FB message to the corporate office and then when I didn't get a response there, I posted a comment stating my dissatisfaction on one of their IG photos. The owner, Luiz C. Oliviera, contacted me personally through IG and informed me that the young black male barista that didn't provide exceptional customer service was terminated. He left without telling anyone where he was going. This is the MAIN reason he was terminated. I had nothing to do with his getting fired. It took a little bit of coaxing but I was able to get Luiz to give me my next drink on him. I went there this morning and Luiz had his barista, Shawn, make me the matcha zen latte that I wanted yesterday and man was it delicious. Moral of the story is always complain when you receive poor service and wonderful things will happen. The other barista that didn't know how to make the drink was also there this morning and seemed to be giving me the ""evil eye"" knowing that I was the reason he got in trouble. Anyway, excellent customer service from the owner down to the barista that promptly delivered my latte directly to my table. :) I'm a fan.",Ee7DchX4XXDIC-5AR_ypTQ,1,0,4,ocFwd0TwLjxlPuhVLku2qA
