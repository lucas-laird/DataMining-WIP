1206756,2018-03-20,13,S3gVMHlrQoJPzM984vCeBg,"I think I just died and gone to coffee heaven.  Yes their coffees are that good.  So good in fact that I came back EVERY.SINGLE.DAY after trying their coffee.  Horrible for my wallet but what can I say...I LOVE a good cup of joe and their Canela Latte with almond milk...out of this world!  I usually need to add an extra shot of espresso, for that extra hit of flavor, but not here.  The coffeeness (is that even a word?) comes out strong and combined with the honey, vanilla, and cinnamon was pure perfection.  I totally recommend you try the Canela latte if you have a hard time trying to figure out which signature latte to order.

If you're not into coffee, they do offer a few selections of teas and smoothies.  The teenager tried their matcha smoothie and thought it was pretty good.  You can definitely taste the matcha flavor.  I also tried their mango green tea with boba.  They do add real mango puree which you can definitely taste.  Now for those that know me, I don't really enjoy drinking tea with boba.  I mean, I just like to drink and not have to chew something while I'm drinking.  But the husband ordered his with boba, so of course I slurped one and I must say, their boba wasn't bad at all.  It had a nice texture, not too hard and not too chewy.  

The inside is still a work in progress so don't expect a nicely decorated shop just yet.  They have a lot more seating available vs. the first time we came on opening day.  This spot can easily be my go to spot for a nice cup of coffee.",A36BF-rIbGExgnu1StJJiA,26,21,5,YWQeS0cwnl0-NQ1Y2XA_qQ

Aware Coffee & Tea is what the Northwest area needed. Their new modern decor is stunning, they have a refreshing (pun intended) outlook on organic drinks. Which by the way, the drinks are OUTSTANDING. My favorite is the Hong Long milk tea, but so far anything I have ordered has not let me down whatsoever. Richie is a beverage genius! 

Side note - To those who are judging based on the ""unfinished look"", give them a break. Building a business takes time and patience, and why rush something that they are perfecting. 

Can't wait to see what else they have up their sleeves, which from what we hear is going to be well worth the wait. Keep up the amazing work Aware!",9iF6hO0YdSjwZm29ixBnKw,5,3,5,pQGODIo4bpz1_uqFKozSAg

1345866,2018-06-05,1,S3gVMHlrQoJPzM984vCeBg,"Originally located in the same space where Time Time was situated. This ""new"" place is really great and the quality of coffee and tea you're getting at this location is delightful. 

Personal recommendations include their Bourbon Vanilla and the Canela (both iced). Their Bourbon Vanilla takes regular vanilla lattes to another level. You taste more vanilla, and it's not overly sweet. The Canela latte is more cinnamon forward, and I love cinnamon! There's slight sweetness but it is a great compliment to the espresso they are using. The lounge makes all the syrups and purees in house, so you can tell that their lattes do not taste artificial. 

The atmosphere is modern-minimalist, clean with a white-grey-black interior. Open bar area allows you to the espresso machine and their back bar. They do have a kitchen in the back, and from reading previous reviews it seems like they will be serving food at some point.

I would give this location higher marks but the associates in the back keep forgetting my order. On two of the three times I have visited the location they downgrade my size from large to regular and I paid for the large. I'm not one to do public tantrums, but seriously pay attention to people's orders. The associate who took my order, even said it back to me and still gave me the smaller cup. 

I will still return as it is one of the better quality coffee/tea locations in my area. Though, I'm going to have to repeat my order several times to make sure they understand the size I want.",HGj8FYzkxJ0Uw8vNjbyluA,1,1,3,u_cIdbCgCpN_tV9oOLbDgQ

As said in a previous post, the focus has swayed towards coffee and it shows. I was extremely happy with the Vietnamese Cold Brew with condensed milk.

When I heard about the rose and cardamom-flavored concoction, I knew I had to get one for myself. The clean lines and bare space remind me of coffee joints in SF, quiet and good for working, and the staff are knowledgeable and friendly about providing suggestions.

The apothecary coffee I had here was stellar- the syrup is made in house and they have a variety of milks to choose from (extra for coconut and almond). Despite the warming temps in Vegas, I opted for the hot drink at the barista's suggestion because he said the flavor was more developed. All I know is that I really enjoyed my drink and will be looking for opportunities to come by this out-of-the-way location again for their bourbon vanilla and mint mojito versions.

Caffeine doesn't affect me in any way so I don't drink it for a boost of energy, but I love the taste of coffee/espresso and I try to stay on the lookout for new places to fulfill my cravings. I first heard about this place while scrolling through instagram. I came here twice with my mom. She ordered the Bourbon Vanilla Latte and I ordered the Mocha Smoothie. My mom's drink came out first and as soon as she took a sip, she was in heaven. She swore up and down that it was the best drink she's ever had. I took a sip of hers and didn't want to give it back! Then when I got mine, I took a sip and too was in heaven. Gosh...it was so good. I don't even know how to explain it. I've had a number of mocha blended drinks before but this was something else and I was hooked. Second time we came, they were out of the ingredients to make it because of EDC so I was so sad but the guy ringing us up recommended the Mocha Latte (I think?) and that was good but it didn't hook me like the Mocha Smoothie did (no surprise).

Service wise, the guy who rung us up both times (I don't know his name but he's Asian) was awesome. He was very patient with us the first time we went after we told him it was our first time and he explained the menu and asked us questions about what we like to drink and then made recommendations. Clearly though, we're hooked on the Bourbon Vanilla Latte and Mocha Smoothie. 

The place was clean with some seating. There was a customer there who seemed to be doing school work as she had her textbooks laid out with her laptop which was nice to see because it showed me that I too could come here to do school work ad get high on Mocha Smoothies all day. However, the space did feel very empty (and I mean differently from minimalistic) but according to the reviews this place does seem new so that would explain the empty space. 

One thing I'd have to gripe about is their menu. While I can appreciate having a specific (and refined) menu of drinks, it would be nice to see them introduce a food menu (nothing crazy that would distract from their drink menu). Offering specific food items that complement their drinks could be beneficial but it would need to be done with taste (ha, see what I did there?) while maintaining the same quality as their drinks. Prices seem a bit high for drinks but I'd pick this place over Starbucks any day because of the quality.

I love this place, plain and simple, and will definitely be returning whenever I get the chance.",Jc-bW5Mzktn0o65r3-I1aw,1,0,4,cNVoCBfDnO64WVXWLt0p1Q

It's close to tons of shopping but maintains a beautiful quietness because it's just barely tucked away, making it the perfect place to read, study, and enjoy some quiet conversation. Everything about Aware lends itself perfectly to calmness and a break from the business of each day by maintaining a simple, clean, and modern atmosphere with a minimalistic and put-together feel.

The focus here isn't placed on having the best and flashiest advertisements or menus, which sets it apart from the Las Vegas scene. The focus is truly the production of incredibly well-made and delicious teas and coffees. Not only are they delicious, they're organic and pure. The owners and employees take an extra step in answering questions about what they serve and are very helpful. As a pacific northwesterner, organic product is as important as good tasting coffee and tea. Richard was really helpful to this end, answering endless questions and making conversation light and easy.

The lychee slush was very fresh and yummy, I definitely want to get it for my own next time! The boba was cooked well, not too soft and not hardened. As for the place itself, it's a very open and comfortable environment. Really clean, nice to quickly pass through or stay for a while to study and hang out.

Back to what I usually do vibe, customer service, and food.

The vibe was definitely laid back and hipster. They have comfy couches to chill at and a good amount of seating. One this I really like about the interior was that all the seating is very general not just certain tables. 

The customer service was super efficient and right away I was helped. The attitude was all smiles and the girl that made my drink was very kind. I asked her for her recommendation and she told me the specials.

As for the drinks, it was pretty good. I got the special - Wildberry Tea - per the recommendation of the barista that helped me. She recommended, since it was a bit hot today, to get the drink as a slush so I said, ""Why not?"" It was sweet, refreshing, and the boba was a bit sweet like I like it. Now I love sweet things but this was a tad bit more sweet than I like.

( the menu says SMOOTHIE!) which I asked her for a smoothie which is blended! I asked for two large sizes split into two cups with boba inside of each cup. I waited ten freakin mins my kids and husband waiting in the car and they gave me two iced Thai tea bobas in a regular cup. Which means she only half way listened to me. I should have had four cups with boba BLENDED! When I asked where were my other cups she then said she didn't charge me for two and That meant I would have had to wait another ten mins. So I said it's okay I grabbed my drinks realize they weren't even blended I wanted to ask her to just give me my money back but my kids were hot and thirsty. So I just said it's fine I didnt have another ten mins to wait. Which that alone is like what the heck. I get ten mins to wait for a blended drink, but ten mins for just a iced drink? Is like wth I won't be going back the drink it's self was wayyy over iced and wasn't all that good.  bad customer service!

The staff is super chill. This location is not very busy... yet! I love coming here to study because? of how mellow it is, but I sure wish they had outlets to charge devices and more places to sit secludedly and bar seats with a backrest.
