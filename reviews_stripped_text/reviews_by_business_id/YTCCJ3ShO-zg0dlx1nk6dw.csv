81789,2017-05-16,0,YTCCJ3ShO-zg0dlx1nk6dw,"Was pleasantly surprised at Morimoto by both the cuisine and the management.  

We had three starters:
  1)Tuna Pizza  - A must have, thin crust with tuna and toppings.  Expected it to be spicier with the halepenos but it was well balanced and sung in your mouth. 2) Sticky Ribs, another must have, fall off the bone, sweet glaze plays on your tongue.  3) Hamachi Tacos, good but not a standout, go with the first two.

Three mains:
1) Seared Snapper - Excellent, creamy smooth curry with bananas and rice.  Fish expertly done and all the flavours worked amazingly.
2)Duck Duck Goose -  More like 4 duck dishes,  1 Duck Fried Rice (what you would expect), 2 duck meatball soup - Just ok  3 Confit duck leg - Very good but again typical, and  4 Duck Breast (perfectly done, with a sweet savory gooseberry sauce, the best of the Duck dishes)  They should make the breast a dish by itself and throw in some fois gras.
3) Pork ishi Yaki Bop -  This was a let down for us.  The pork was mainly the fat of the belly so its consistancy was very soft lacking pork flavour. Presentation was neat but the wow factor stopped there. 

Dessert:  
1)Fiery Salty Caramel Chocolate Tarte -  Dinner then a show, what else can you ask for ?  Melted beautifully.  The marshmallow inside was smooth and creamy not sticky at all.  Enough for two people.

Management:
The manager Jim went out of his way to insure our experience at Morimoto ended on a positive note.  He took notice that we did not enjoy the Ishi Bop so he promptly made things right by exceeding our expectations.  He showed great awareness of his diners and their experience.  Because of Jim we left on a high note and will be sure to return.  

Overall:  Great management, great food, good portion size, and a nice ambiance.  Morimoto is a must visit.  A+",Xo99Z-shvqVAijcrQjr_Sg,1,0,5,eqzZnN6JFf931IvzKU83mQ

Love all appetizers we orders which included the toro tartar, oyster foie gras and carpaccio.  I have to say that the oyster foie gras is a must try! We also ordered the sushi but I have to say we were a bit disappointed.  While the fish was fresh, I feel like that the sushi had too much rice and the rice didn't have enough flavor.  We've definitely had better sushi before. If I were to go again, I would probably try the other entrees instead of their sushi.

Though the charge for parking at the MGM is still a good reason to avoid certain strip properties.  Anyway, Morimoto's opened about 3 months ago, so they were very eager to please and provide excellent service.  We did not order sushi but I must say, the sushi bar looks fabulous!  We shared about five items off the regular menu.  We had two appetizers and three Entrees.  Entrees included: Black Cod, Angry Chicken, Yellowtail served in a bowl that was 450 degrees and cooked table side.  Every item was cooked to perfection. We finished the meal with the flaming chocolate dessert - it tasted absolutely fabulous - a good mix of light froth and heavy darker chocolate.  Service was excellent.

The entrees were north of $30. Don't normally pay that even for 5 star food but being in Vegas we thought it will be worth it. The lamb chop was nothing to rave about and the chicken was a lame attempt at an Indian inspired entree. Totally not worth the quality/price ratio.

You name it, Bobby Flay, Gordon Ramsey, Giada... they all have their trademark restaurants.  Morimoto, the iron chef, is no exception.  He is the iron chef after all and opened not too long ago at the MGM Grand, this was a must try.  

We had reservations at 7:45pm and we weren't seated until 8:10pm.  Uh oh, this is not a good sign.  However, the manager was very apologetic and gave us a round of drinks on the house for our inconvenience.  That was very classy.  Being that this is such a high end place, expectations for service and food were high.  

The food did not disappoint.  The fish is what is to get here.  We had sashimi and sushi, all of which were excellent and fresh.  O-toro and chu-toro were my faves.  The waiter offered a selection menu that they can craft for the table but we preferred to build our own.  My favorite was the cheesecake soufflé dessert.  Yum!  While the fancy chocolate ball lit on fire has the wow factor, the cheesecake soufflé was light and moist without the density of the usual cheesecake.  I wanted to lick the plate.

Actual food quality was 4 stars, but minus 2 stars for being CRAZY over-priced for the quality ($85-$90 per person without alcohol).  I felt pretty ripped off spending such money for food that is barely better than mall pan-asian food.  Their snow crab legs tasted less than fresh (slightly fishy taste and lacking the sweetness of truly fresh shellfish) and it also had an odd sauce that reminded me of some amateur combo of ketchup-and-mayo-and-sriraca.  The Laksa Noodle ""soup"" had, instead of broth, a strange paste-like liquid base that was gloopy and unpleasant.  Their version of wasabi friend shrimp was no better than my local restaurant that sells it for half their price.  Admittedly, those were the low-points -- much of the food was decent enough -- but I felt ripped off after paying over $400 bucks for my family of five.",0F92UCErUmsAdXCfcnAbCw,0,0,2,qIuSBViQcjUPQu7gHb4wRQ

I can't be one hundred percent sure though because it was Thanksgiving, so you might want to make a reservation to be on the safe side. Our server, Jeff was very kind and was very welcoming. He gave recommendations and tried his very best to help us. 

I wasn't so impressed with the food though. We had the sashimi (recommended by Jeff) which was excellent and was as fresh as seafood gets. Next, we had the pork chop which I didn't like. Am thought the pork was fresh, it was too heavy and had a LOT of fat. Finally, we had the black cod which was okay. It was toped with a soy sauce reduction which was too salty. The cod also tasted sweet which really killed it for me. The presentation for all of our dishes were stunning though.

Most importantly, the dessert! We ordered the fiery chocolate tart and the chilled cheesecake souffle. Words can't express how stunning the tart looked! And most importantly, it tasted awesome. The chocolate and marshmellow blended together to make a s'mores like taste. The chilled cheesecake was very light and flavorful.

Interesting appetizers with the pork belly being the winner - melt in your mouth good that people who don't like the greasiness of the pork still liked it.  Also very good were wagyu carpaccio, whitefish carpaccio, kama, and taco. The vegetables and Chinese broccoli were also great such that they were loved by the meat lovers.  Kids loved the black cod and surf and turf. The only one I would skip is the snapper curry entree--overly coconut and oddly needed some spice unlike the rest of the meal.

The desserts were interesting with the black forest as most interesting and delicious. Love that you crack the chocolate and oozes out cherry flavored sauce and then you find some marshmallow-like stuff hidden. The kirsch ice cream was very good with the sauce and rich chocolate mousse.

To be honest, it may be because of all the years that have passed or because I traveled to Japan recently and have experienced traditional Japanese cuisine, but my experience at Morimoto this time around wasn't as breathtaking.

Though, the dishes were in general, delicious, and for the $120 omakase style that we paid, I think it was worth the price. But when you get down to the details of each dish, most of them was either slightly sweet, a tad bit oily, and so forth, and I personally think the restaurant is between a 3 and 4 (closer to a 4 though).

We were able to get reservations on the day of (Saturday), which was surprising as I thought they would be pretty full.

An always bustling MGM Grand Hotel in Fabulous Las Vegas is even more bustling when the National Rodeo is in town. A fine gathering of good people cheering on a mostly teenage group of professional riders of bulls and broncos, steer wrestlers, and calf ropers. And when the fun is done, it should come as no surprise that this audience craves cold beer. House shots. And raw fish?

The famous and beloved Morimoto has brought his act to the strip. Not sure how often he -- or his other celeb friends -- actually get into town. But Morimoto - you need to make a house call to this place. Set aside those photo ops with Snoop Dog that adorn your home page. 

My wife and I with our two friends were seated promptly. Our server appeared at once and immediately ordered us edamame and shishitos. A touch pushy, but a good idea. Then she presented ONE menu for 4 people, and proceeded with a ""hard sell"" of the $100 (to $200) per person tasting menu.

Personally, I despise the whole notion of tasting menus. But moreover, it's a restaurant - can we please have some more menus so we can see and chat about what you're serving!?

To our surprise the whole table DID NOT have to participate for the tasting, which liberated our dinner companions to go for the gusto with what the chef thinks is good tonight. 

But this ""tasting"" comes with risks. There are no choices. There aren't even hints as to what's to come when you go down that rabbit hole, Alice. You are ""all in"" as they are inclined to say in this town.

With drinks already ordered, only my wife and I had something left to say.  Apps - Miso soup and Morimoto's sashimi with 5 sauces.  Mains - Japanese Waygu steak and ""Duck Duck Goose"" - advertised as duck meatball soup and duck confit fried rice.

Let the games begin.  

Tasty Edamame and shishitos that were amply salted made for a delicious start. As did the smoky sauced octopus carpaccio ""for the table"" the runner said (but was later ID'd as the first course of the 2-person tasting menu). Where is our server to explain what was happening?

This was followed by my wife's ""app"" of Miso soup. But it was in fact a family style caldron with a ladle, presented with two bowls and two spoons and inexplicably offered only to the two ladies at the table. But we all tried it anyway. It was just okay. I've been equally pleased with my homemade versions featuring instant dashi, but I digress. 

Next up: My app of Morimoto's sashimi. Four Napoleon like layered squares of raw stuff, served with 5 squeezers of sauces that were woefully unimpressive and watery. But, even if they all were good, with only four pieces of chopstick protein, how the hell do you divvy up 5 sauces?

Where oh where is our server?!

Raw oysters with seared foie and uni arrived as a very obvious tasting menu choice. Very tasty - but what can you help but say when you slap foie and uni on anything?

A routine sushi sampler of tuna, hamachi, egg custard, mackerel, salmon, and shrimp arrived shortly thereafter as part of the tasting menu and completely under-whelmed our dinner companions. To quote my friend, ""It wasn't anything more than what you can get at Sushi A-Go-Go."" 

""Duck Duck Goose"" arrives a la carte for me. A demitasse of duck broth with a tiny meatball, a plate with some sliced breast on gooseberry compote, a drumstick of duck confit, and duck confit fried rice. Mostly unexpected based on the menu description. Mostly bland. 

An update:  Our server has still not been spotted.

Waygu arrives cooked properly and legit Japanese. For the money, however, go to Prime or the Wynn if you want that Waygu experience. 

Next unexplained item up:  ""surf and turf"" (filet mignon and raw hamachi) and Sashimi sampler arrive simultaneously. My friend, who wasn't responding to the tranquilizer I was slipping him, finally (and angrily) spotted and summoned our server to demand an explanation of what was what. 

She shamelessly declared the aforementioned Napoleon like layered sashimi was part of the tasting menu. In front of us now was MY a la carte sashimi app (completely ignoring the missing 5 sauces and the fact that my entree was already finished). She confirmed that the surf and turf was indeed part of the tasting menu. And once our friends secured knives since chopsticks don't slice steak, they confirmed it was good. 

But back to this honking plate of sashimi that was declared my app. Severely oversized slices of hamachi, salmon, fish skin, and mackerel overshadowed the thinly sliced pristine red tuna. The mackerel, in fact, reminded one of what is in a chum bucket on a shark fishing trip. And to repeat proteins on the earlier sushi sampler was lazy (if you are keeping score, hamachi has appeared three times on three tasting plates).

Sorry Morimoto. These judges have spoken. And the winner was not your Las Vegas restaurant on this night.",9UfxxCL6qHIzP_j414t1iA,0,2,2,U_f8fTCxae7PNsKGb9cIvQ

The large $200 chefs choice Sushi was presented well but for that much money it was lack luster at best. The sauce they put on the whole fried fish was disgusting! And trying to get a chicken dish for my mother-in-law with out being all curry sauced up proved to cause us to be served a mediocre chicken and potatoes dish. The medallion potatoes were dry and flavorless. We didn't eat them, nor did we eat much of the chicken. Oh and the specialty cocktail tasted horrible, we didn't drink it either.

We started with the fresh sashimi selection , and all the fish was super fresh and we didn't need much condiments to accentuate it as well as a hamachi roll that was heavenly.

For entrees we tried the Korean style hot bowls, and the ginger soy glazed black cod. The last time I had black cod this delicious was at NOBU, when they first opened in town. We shared a side dish of the duck Confit fried rice, and duck egg . 

Service was a little slower than what we would have liked, but it was a Saturday and a concert was in house so it was to be expected .  The decor was clean, and open , with a nice view of the kitchen, grill stations , and open view of the walkway in restaurant row to people watch. The restaurant filled up very quickly .

Service: Absolutely Amazing. The hostess sat us earlier per our request because our show ended earlier than expected. She was very accommodating. Our server Jan was absolutely amazing.

The Food: Best Sushi in Vegas. We ordered the sushi and the sashimi for the table. Everything was so fresh! The preparation was breathtakingly beautiful. It was the probably the best spicy tuna maki we have ever enjoyed. For dessert we got the Sorbet Trio - the best of the 3 being the coconut green tea sorbet.

Atmosphere: nice, relaxing, very hip decor with Japanese twist clean

Service: perfect, with all staff very attentive and friendly- our server Ed provided great recommendations on food

Food:
1.) Kampachi Nigiri- clean and not fishy, perfect temp for sashimi, cut was beautiful.
2.) Oyster Foie Gras- the flavors and texture was perfect, very unique and flavorful, not your typical oyster.
3.) Duck Meatball Soup- good kick and very flavorful broth, meatballs were super tender
4.) Sashimi 55- beautiful presentation, great cuts of fish, everthing super fresh.
5.) Seafood 'Toban Yaki'- would describe this as a Japanese ciopino, very good ""soup"" base that had a kick, very flavorful, with all seafood cooked just right.
6.) Morimoto-style Chirashi- honestly, this was my favorite dish as I feel chirashi is second to an omakase that displays the chef's different cuts of fish; in the bowl was salmon, tuna, toro, hamachi, shitake mushroom, and cubed steamed egg, ginger, and inari
7.) Fiery Chocolate Tart- this chocolate ball smore-like dessert has a fantastic display when it ia melted with the alcohol that is set on fire; the chcolate sorbet inside is a perfect combo with the marshmallow and raspberries.
8.) Mango Pudding- creamy fruitty pudding accompanied by coconut green tea sorbet, and these coconut cakes that were the bomb
9.) Souffle Cheesecake- while this was good, I believe it's like any other Japanese cheesecake, the little sauce dots are probably what set thia dessert apart from other Japanese cheesecakes

Overall, the restaurant was fantastic.  The sushi chefs are skilled in how they cut.  Everything was absolutely delicious.  When we sat down, it was great that they addressed me  by name, gave us all hot towels go clean out hands.  They also asked if they could wipe down the table after the main course, which I liked because I'm somewhat a clean freak and had already somewhat started wiping at my eating area.

We did ask one of the wait staff if Morimoto himself comes in, and unfortunately we missed him by two days!  We were told he stops in once a month!  Would be awesome if we could have seen him, but it's certainly great to know that he checks in at this restaurant from time to time.

Their sashimi is super fresh and the selection is incredible. The sushi is really good too. The waiter told us that they get brown rice and freshly mill the rice the day of so that the sushi rice can absorb all the flavor. The toro tartare is very unique with all the sides that you can add onto it. Everyone recommends the tuna pizza but personally I think the olives on the tuna pizza overpowers the rest of the flavors and I wouldn't recommend this dish. However we get the hamachi tacos every single time. It is super refreshing. The steak on the surf and turf is really good and comes with a little bit of crunch on top of it. For the surf part, it was sashimi and tasted really similar to the hamachi tacos and was very good. Oyster foie gras is also really good the sauce is really sweet and really balances out the flavors. A5 wagyu is definitely something you should try at least once. The service here is amazing and super accommodating. We came here on our anniversary and they gave us free cheesecake soufflé with mango and passion fruit on top in the shape of sushi. It was very unique but I don't see it on the menu!

Just listening to the server passionately talk about the cuisine made us fall in love with the restaurant. 

Food was ABSOLUTELY AMAZING. One of the best sushi and sashimi I've had in a while. I had the Toro tartare, and the flavors of the condiments on the see through dish worked really well with the Toro.

My girlfriend ordered a White Lily, which she raved about the entire night, and I had a Sopporo, which was plenty. For food, we started out with the beef carpaccio, hamachi tacos, rock shrimp tempura, and the gyoza. For never having beef carpaccio before and not having any expectation on how it should taste, I was truly amazed. I could not stop eating it. The rock shrimp tempura was just as amazing! It came in two different sauces with Morimoto ranch on the side. I personally liked the wasabi aioli better, but my girlfriend liked the spicy one better so it worked out. The hamachi tacos are a twist on the usual taco. It comes in a fried wonton shell with guacomole, hamachi yellowtail. It had a nice citrus crisp to it, that my girlfriend definitely enjoyed. Wish we ordered more, as it comes in 3s! The gyoza was pretty good. It came on a iron plate so it came sizzling, which was very cool, and the aroma of the sake and garlic filled the room.

For entrees, we had the ishi yaki buri bop and their 8 oz filet. They cooked our bop table side, and the presentation was very entertaining to watch. The 8oz filet also came on a skillet. I would never thought to order a steak at a japanese restaurant, but I was very impressed. Seasoned very well and cooked to perfection - medium rare.

Lastly for dessert, my girlfriend and I shared the coconut mango. I liked that they had more than just chocolates for the dessert. It was the perfect combination of sweet and tart and came with a green tea sorbet, if only I wasn't so full, I would've finished it!

1541060,2017-01-09,0,YTCCJ3ShO-zg0dlx1nk6dw,"My favorite meal for this Vegas trip was Morimoto. I'm a big fan of Chef Morimoto and this restaurant didn't disappoint me at all. 

We had a helpful waiter who I forgot his name(maybe Brad?) I don't recall. We came in as a party of 8 but he allowed us to have half the table order their take on chefs recommendation set(or what he thought were the most popular items in the restaurants) and allowed the other half to order entrees of our own. Usually when you get chefs recommendation style, the whole table would be forced to all get it but we were glad that we were able to get a bit of everything to try. 

We ordered the braised black cod, surf and turf, seafood topan yaki and two side orders of duck fried rice. The chef recommendation that our waiter have got for us consisted of sticky ribs, beef capraccio, yellowtail tacos, Rock Shrimp Tempura, a sushi platter that consist of rolls and raw, the ribeye, and two desserts. 

I will start off with the bads. I dont particularly recommend the duck fried rice. It's aite but personally its not really worth to get it at its price. A bit too dried as well. The other thing that was surprisingly not great was their sushi platter. I thought Morimoto would thrive at their sushi and such but it was really mediocre. With that said, the winner of it all goes to their Rock Shrimp Tempura. Their rock shrimp tempura that are in two styles( wasabi aioli and spicy kochujian sauce) with a side of celery(think of eating wings) + blue cheese sauce was pretty horrendous. It was like their take on the chinese style mayo walnut shrimp but worse. This dish just didn't come together for me and the flavors didn't make much sense. It was the memorable dish that I wanted to forget. 

Goods: everything else was pretty damn good. I would say the one that stand out to me the most was actually their ribeye. First of all, I didn't know they offered steaks but it was overwhelmingly delicious. It was actually one of the better steaks I've had that might be able to compete with Craft and that is some high praising cause Craft Steakhouse(which is next door)is the best. Not only was it seasoned well, it was almost melt in your mouth good and you can tell high quality it was. Some other dish that were memorable was the yellowtail/hamachi tacos. It was really refreshing and delicious. The surf and turf, I thought the turf part was forgettable but I forgot the sashimi style yellowtail(almost like a capraccio) was pretty delicious but I prob wouldn't order this again just to eat 50% of the dish. Beef carpraccio, which I thought was pretty delicious, Had a nice sauce and it comes with a fair amount. Another surprise was their sticky ribs. For a japanese restaurant, I wouldn't think of coming here to get their ribs but damn it was fall off the bone good which allowed me to just fork the sticky ribs off and eat it instead of having to dirty myself using my hands. The seafood topan yaki was okay. I thought they were generous with the amount of seafood they had. You can think of almost any kind of seafood and it'll be there consisting from clams-mussels-scallop-crab-lobster. I thought the desserts were fairly nice as well. The donuts were really soft and fluffy. Just the right amount of sugar around it and you can squeeze the amount of custard you want in it. The chocolate dish was a nice show to watch and I thought it was pretty delicious as well.

The chefs recommendation cost $396 for 4 people. Personally given the amount of food they gave us, I thought it was a reasonable price for how good it tasted. I just really recommend that you substitute the rock shrimp tempura for something else. 

I would definitely come back.",SqjP1cV8JwDdN0K9QULzog,0,0,4,1k-2bYJ5unXc6tZMa-DJCQ

The restaurant is cozily tucked inside the #MGM Grand So you can't miss it. 

The hostesses were very accommodating and since I had to make reservations for five people, they conveniently seated us at the entrance. Loved it. We were greeted by an enthusiastic server who gave us a little history of the Sake (Borne was peachy sweet, yum) we selected. 

Nice touch, very classy, but the only tiny suggestion I have is ask your customer if they want to hear about the  history...Not a reflection on our server, because ii suspect I suffer from ADHD 

Another thing  I liked about my experience  is that our server made it a point to ask if anyone had allergies. That's cool! 

For me it's cheese, dairy and chocolate.  Loved that part since I'm allergic to a few things that I assume don't exist in sushi restaurants anyway but who knows, right? So that was a nice touch. 

If you look at my reviews it's really hard to disappoint me, but one of my Followers said I need to write down my thumbs downs too so here's one.  

I felt that sharing my allergies to the server didn't really make a difference since our desserts had cream and chocolate and if he made some kind of comment to me like ""hey old lady, I know you have allergies so I wanna let you know that this dessert right here is loaded with mouthwatering chocolates you can't have"" or ""I know it sucks to be you since that cake over there is made of the creamiest cream that the world's mighty Chefs would die for"" then the customer would really feel special. I didn't. 

Since we opted for the risky #Omakase style dining, it felt like sharing your deepest secret to a friend because you ""leave it up to him or her"" and trust them completely but they negate it anyway. So that little yet critical move could be improved. 

Now why am I pointing these things out? I care about the customer experience and I know how these things are areas they can improve on. Yes, I care because I want to bring people back with me here. If I didn't care, I'd fake it and just shut up, just like relationships, right?!

I highly recommend it.  We have raw beef as appetizer which was absolutely delicious then sashimi combo, a must have as well.  The waiter recommended their $98 steak as entree.  It's tender and juicy.  it is a bit greasy tho.  If that's not your style, there are bunch of other stuff to choose from too.  You can save a few bucks too. :) . The other seafood entree was pretty delicious.  A meal for two came to ~$300.

I spend time reading reviews to weed out the crazies who give a restaurant one star bc they showed up at 7pm on a weekend night and are pissed they have to wait, I love high end food and unique food served in quirky places. My absolute favorite BBQ is served in a gas station in SC. That said, my Morimoto fan girl came out in full force when I saw his new restaurant at MGM. This is his ONLY teppan restaurant outside of Tokyo and OMG it was amazing! Now let me start by telling you this is NOT your run of the mill teppan with mass amounts of food for $20 and yum yum sauce. This is an experience, a high end,  a la carte meal that will leave you super satisfied. It is not cheap but the service, food and ambiance are worth it. Lenin (teppan chef), TJ (sommelier) and Norberto (server) were great. We had the beef carpaccio as an app (yum); the filet, scallops and fried rice as an entree...I am still dreaming about.... and the donuts as a desert. Loved this place! I mean loved it.

Sorry to go on a rant here,but I need to..I do wish Vegas fine dining places had dress codes. Nothing worse than dressing up to celebrate a special occasion, only to have 2 buzzed,unkempt sloths seated next to you. I made reservations for us days before and was informed only a 5pm time was available -for the entire evening.That wasn't a problem it was Friday night..... We were seated beside another nice couple. The tables were fairly close, a pet peeve of mine,especially if paying major $ on an intimate dinner... But I dind't expect any issues given the situation.... That couple finished quickly and they sat 2 guys. They had just come from the MGM pool and were in shorts, sandals and baseball hats. They clearly had been drinking .
  The first thing they said was ""smells fucking great in here"". That was just what we wanted at the summit and last 2 courses of our meal. 
  This isn't so much a problem of this restaurant specifically, but if they are going to take $460 of my money, and, challenge me to get seating, they better have some standards . They can sit in the damn lounge. If they were seated beside us prior I would have left.... 

 This only encourages eating at home and saving one's money sometimes. Vegas understandably has plenty of party people and thats expected,to a point, but even night clubs have dress standards .... Too bad the mob didn't still run things .",svUmhGl16tWtoA3tyY0aRw,0,0,3,GXqmdSXEqnW73r1oUCHaoQ

I never had a better server in my life. everything was coming on time, he was very helpful, respectful, with a smile. food was excellent, drinks were solid, and presentation was great. 3 minor things that i feel they can better at are 1) chopsticks are very slippery.I know they look good, but that doesn't matter. 2) even though it's a traditional authentic Japanese place, on specialty rolls they can be a bit more creative , and offer 2-3 rolls that have more creativity and sauces. i know sometimes you cannot taste the fish, but if you give this small option, might be very beneficial 3) the acoustics of the place. all surfaces are hard, and the echo reflects. would be a great idea to spent some $$ and place some soundproofing on ceiling or below the tables....  Overall everything else was perfect. Even our busser Ryan was amazing. Always with a smile, respectful, and very helpful. This place totally worth the $$, and its a 100 times better than Nobu.

Desserten ska inte vi inte ens prata om! Den kommer med en egen show i form av brinnande effekter och smälter framför dig till din förvåning för att sedan stelna och bilda ett chokladlager blandat med likör. Oerhört god, stekig och häftig var chokladbolldesserten.

1941759,2017-08-20,1,YTCCJ3ShO-zg0dlx1nk6dw,"Morimoto is now one of my favorite Japanese restaurants in Vegas! We ate here for dinner last night. 

The Vegas location of the iron chef's namesake is located in MGM's The District which is a walkway of shops and restaurants connecting the pool to the main casino.  

When my husband booked our reservation over the phone they asked for our eating preferences and our names which they remembered throughout the entire meal. 

The hostess sat us at a table next to the front window. I had to laugh because throughout the 2 hours of beautifully plated food with excellent customer service I must have counted at least 15 - 20 inner tubes go by. What's with the inner tubes?! It became a game to see how many we could catch on camera (see collage of photos taken). 

In true Japanese fashion we were served hot towels prior to starting our meal. 

On MGM's website and there was only 4 dinner entrees listed and none were vegetarian. Thankfully, at the restaurant the menu was massive and with the help of our server, Matthew, I was able to choose between about 15 savory options. He highly recommended the tempura which they could make with only vegetables, the shishito peppers, and an altered version of the Ishi Yaki Chasu Bop which was a rice dish usually served with yellowtail in a sizzling pot. They subbed in Tofu and a runny egg for the fish and called it a Tofu Bop (it's exactly like Korean Bibimbap). 

I thought the tempura would be humdrum and like all the other vegetable tempuras I've ever had... but it wasn't!  Easily, the best tempura ever... and being half Asian... I've had a lot of tempura. They fry it at a very high temperature so not only the delicately light batter but also the vegetables get a little crispy. My favorites were the salad leaf and trumpet mushroom, which was a first for me. The tempura was served with a wasabi aioli. Delicious. 

The side of Blistered Shishito Peppers with Yuzu Soy tasted very good but also somewhat like others I've had. 

The Tofu Bop was presented and mixed table side in a sizzling pot. The only thing different from the Korean version for me was the sauce they pour over the rice which was a Sesame Soy Yuzu and oh so delicious! The rice was crispy from the pot and the flavors were very nice. I would definitely recommend this to future vegetarian eaters. 

My husband ordered the tuna tacos, spicy salmon roll and the angry chicken. He liked it all so so much. But being Asian, he ordered a side of sushi rice to go with the Angry Chicken. He said to trust him, it makes it better. Also he said this is not a good first date dish to order... it's hard to look cute while eating chicken on the bone. 

We had to order another set of hot towels to get him cleaned up. 

For dessert we got the Coconut Mango which was a mango parfait with coconut cake and green tea sorbet sprinkled with ""snow"". It was also plated with cookies that had the consistency of space ice cream and took me back to memories of eating it as a kid. The whole dessert was so delicious and creative and beautiful!! 

Overall we were very impressed and will return!! The only change we would make is to ask to sit away from the front window and all the inner tubes. Thank you Iron Chef Morimoto and team!",WBmDeZG_dGUwhG1DtotLcw,1,1,5,6xDhd4c58YxS9KmLG4FVMA

She's been wanting to try this place since she heard it was happening and finally decided to come in. We RSVP for 5:30, arrived around 5:15 and checked in, they seated us immediately. The place is beautiful!! Very spacious, lots of tables, they are well-staffed!! 3 hostesses at the front, two managers on duty, and many servers and bussers. 

The three of us decided to to Omakase. $140/person for 6 signature dishes. 

#1 - Toro Tartare - 10/10 - Presentation is on point, very Instagram worthy! The Toro was delicious, sweet and fresh, the sauces on the side were nice, you can mix and match and everything simply tasted amazing. From presentation to taste, very impressed. It is a fun dish to eat, the little scalpel you and scoop the Toro with, a very fun experience. 

#2 - Beef carppacio - 10/10 - with some oil, slices of truffle and capers and some greens on top. Tasted pretty good, a little too oily but nothing crazy heavy. I don't think this is on their regular menu, it could be, I don't remember. 

#3 - Some kind of fondu style dish - 5/10 - Tomato sauce with cheese in a cute little cup with a candle on the bottom to keep it warm, came with: fish balls, shrimp, salmon chip (fried salmon), mussel, pasta, broccolini and carrots on the side. Neither of us liked this dish! Presentation looked awesome, when first brought it out we were all excited to try but it looked better than it tasted. The tomato sauce and cheese mix were ok, tasted good with the pasta. The fish balls were very strange, they were super cold which required dipping in the sauce for quite a while but then it was still cold on the inside. The shrimp and mussels were whatever. The salmon chip was so stale and hard, did not taste good at all. The main part of this dish is the sauce because everything was supposed to be dipped in it but the sauce was very plain, nothing special. 

#4 - Chef's sushi selection - 10/10 - Came with 5 pieces of sashimi and one gigantic square-shaped sushi. This was really good. The sake salmon was so sweet and delicious, the tuna as part fatty tuna which was awesome! Those are the two stand out pieces of the dish. The rest of the fish were fresh and delicious also!

#4 - Surf and Turf - 10/10 - The steaks were so good! More rare than I would prefer but it was not bloody so I was ok with it. The sauce was amazing, steaks were so tender and soft, melts in your mouth. Lobster came with half a tail and a claw, really sweet and fresh, even the root potato was really good. 

#5 - Flaming Dessert and Japanese Cheesecake:
-Flaming Dessert 5/10 - This comes with omakase, I am a chocolate lover but thought this was too much chocolates. Presentation was cool but the entire plate was chocolate: chocolate cake, chocolate pieces, chocolate crumbles, chocolate everything - easily too sweet and taste over overwhelming. I would have liked a few different flavors to balance out the sweetness. 
-My brother is not a fan of chocolate so they were nice enough to replace his dessert with the Japanese cheesecake when we asked. Presentation on point and the cheesecake was sooooo good! Soft and fluffy, melts in your mouth, decadent but not too sweet or heavy, wish I wasn't too full so I could have finished it. 

Cons:
-Server did not ask how we wanted our steaks cooked nor did she inform us that it would be prepared medium-rare (I usually like my steaks medium well)
-Waited a bit for waters to be re-filled once they got busy
-We saw that they brought out the next dish and stood there and waited to give us our food because of old dishes were not cleared yet 
-Had asked our server if we could replace one of our dessert and I'm pretty sure she forgot to ask the chef, asked her again and she came back quickly with an answer 
-Random note but their chopsticks were weird lol - looked fancy but was cheap plastic, did not really go with the rest of the place (doesn't bother me at all though, just thought it was funny)

Overall really enjoyed this experience. The staff were attentive, food was unique and delicious for the most part, really enjoyed the overall vibe of the place.",7svBs9qqPJHPRXZ56Q3ZuQ,0,0,4,W9_0pJlNQqcDPrUPTvez1A

My other friend wanted to try the food and experience. I saw the Morimoto restaurant ads in January when I walked through the MGM hotel.

I ordered the Omakase which is a Japanese phrase, ""I will leave it up to you chef.""  The Omakase at this location in Las Vegas, Nevada has five-course meal with dessert.  We decided to get aged sake called Hakkaisan Snow-Aged Junmai Ginjo, three years, for the table.

The pros are the nigiri is really fresh. Any fresher and the fish will be swimming up to your table. I have been to all you can eat sushi restaurants in Las Vegas and sometimes the the sea urchin has a metallic taste.  The sea urchin at this restaurant has a umami taste but again, it is Morimoto.  The customer service is very on point and they explain how to eat each dish for the Omakase.  We had no problems ordering a table online and surprising the restaurant gets very busy during the night.

The cons are it is really pricey but you are in Las Vegas. You need to go all out. The Omakase is $140 per person and the bottle of sake we ordered is close to $200 a bottle.

I would recommend this restaurant for the experience and if you like sushi.  Here are the images of my dishes, sake, and price tag.",Agdke7kDB03iyXPjnQA-pg,6,5,5,eJ10vmkPqXPxioUIaTMyfw

I walked there the night before to make a reservation since I had a show to catch right after dinner. If you don't have a reservation they'll likely seat you in the lounge/bar area instead of the dining room. If you want to eat a full meal I think it's better if you sit in the main dining area. 

Beef carpaccio- beef was sliced perfectly thin and tasted yummy too. 

Lobster and seafood- loved the broth this dish came in. It was really rich in flavor and added a lot to the dish. This was a relatively expensive entrée but delicious nonetheless.  

Baked oysters with uni- This dish was the most disappointing. I guess I prefer my oysters raw. I just didn't like the taste of this dish.

10 piece sushi nigari + spicy tuna roll- The sushi was better than what I had expected with a good mixture.

It's not cheap for just the small slice you get and I didn't want to spend all my food budget while in Vegas on one restaurant. I still had few more places to go and try out. I felt happy that I got to eat some morimoto sushi and felt content. The nigori sake was so delicious. It's the unfiltered sake and has a little bit of a sweet taste. I loved the nigori sake here! It's so smooth and delicious. My dessert was like a chocolate shell that had marshmallow inside. The server poured liquor on it and lit it. It melted a little and a marshmallow oozed and it was fantastic. It wasn't overly sweet but a perfect ending to a nice dinner here. I'm just bummed Otoro was a size of a domino for two slices.

We had a reservation but were seated a little late, since it just happened that there was a conference that day and there were a lot of people waiting. There's an option to have the chef pick their favorite dishes depending on how much you want to spend per person. We wanted to choose what we wanted, so we skipped their ""prix fixe"" meal. 

Tuna pizza, 5 stars: My husband's favorite. I personally didn't like the olive combination with my raw tuna, but it was definitely different. I liked the really crispy cracker that was the crust of the pizza, and the tuna was really fresh.

Laksa noodle soup, 4 stars: Really thick for my preference on noodle soup, but the flavor was there. I think it could've been diluted down or maybe we got the bottom of the pot.

Duck duck goose, 4 stars: Pretty good, but a little overhyped for me on yelp. I thought the duck confit was a little chewy, but the duck meatball was really good. The gooseberry compote was a sweet pairing with the seared duck breast, which we enjoyed very much.

Kakuni, 5 stars: Amazing 10 hour pork belly. I wish I could make this pork belly at home. Served with rice congee and soy-scallion jus, which is just the perfect complement to this pork belly. Its so tender, you can eat the whole thing with a spoon.

Ishi yaki kakuni bop, 4 stars: Not exactly the same as the pork belly as in the Kakuni. I don't think this one is braised for 10 hours. Its not as tender, but its a cool rendition of the bi bim bap with Japanese flavors

Chirashi, 5 stars: SO good. The fish is so fresh and has the perfect combination of rice/sides/fish.  I would come here next time and just get this if I were craving really good sashimi.

Overall, obviously we ordered too much for 2 people. But we really wanted to try everything and took some of it home too. I highly recommend Morimoto to anyone wanting good and fancy Japanese food.",dY6GK465j-kLlrXalgdsNA,3,1,5,nDJsXRbUvbVKAsFPoJ_7YA

As for their food, my family went crazy for the Wagyu Beef Carpaccio and Yellowtail Collar. We've had our fair share of Yellowtail Collar at many Japanese restaurants, but this was by far the best - the fish was just so delicate.  However, we did also enjoy all our other dishes such as a King Crab sushi, all their veggie sushi are good for any vegetarians out there. Cold noodle was also perfectly chewy. However, all their other dishes were much loved by my family - I just personally didn't try them. 

Service was amazing. They came by to change our plates promptly after eating lobster/crab leg. Water was constantly being refilled.

We were greeted by our busser who offered us still or sparkling water, then soon we were greeted by our server, Aries. Aries was wonderful. He was friendly, attentive, suggested some great dishes and recommended some very tasty cocktails.

Appetizers
-Blistered shishito peppers
-oysters
-beef carpaccio
-hamachi tacos

Entrees
-new york strip steak that was served over a hot pan. The server poured a sauce over it which made it all sizzle.

- seared snapper with cocunut curry. This was by far my favorite dish, full of flavor.
-Tuna pizza
-an assortment of sushi

One of the shooters had a tiny bit of uni while another had a much bigger piece. The Green Bean seasoning lacked salt, like they threw it together, forgot the salt and forgot to care!!  The lobster was dry and not very pleasant. We ordered the 10 piece nigiri tasting * 3 thinking they would give us their best.

The sushi bar looked cool and further back was a steak display just on the other side of the hibachi tables. It would have been cool to have been sat near either one of those areas however instead we were seated on the other side of a pillar which blocked our view of pretty much everything. So much for Feng Shui ehh? As far as the service goes it was ok. Nothing special.(maybe they didn't see us at times bec of the pillar?)Either way I did not feel as if I was at a 5 star dining experience or anything like that. The sashimi was fresh and I did enjoy some of these dishes. The sushi rolls were mediocre nothing special.  The surf n turf we ordered looked good , however we ordered it rare and it came out well done. (they did not ask how it was and or even check the temperature upon serving the steak and the surf was just regular sashimi.

Staff - from the hostess stand, wait staff, chefs, everyone that came by our table was pleasant and fun to talk to. When I had questions everyone was knowledgeable about the food.

Atmosphere-casual but classy. The buzz of the restaurant was low, not loud, everyone on top of their game. I didn't have to talk loud to be heard. 

Food- everything was delicious. I was very adventurous as I've never had some of the items on the menu. We had the chef's special that was a 6 course meal. This is not your casual sushi restaurant and cannot be compared to those meals. The food is an experience in itself, each course takes you on a journey. Mouthwatering, melt in your mouth, different tastes, that you enjoy with each bite. 

To top it off Chef Morimoto stopped by the restaurant and we were fortunate to get a picture with him. Best Mother's Day dinner, dinner in general that I've had.

Here, the servers are not very knowledgeable about the menu. Let your servers taste the menu, Iron Chef.  The fish was fresh but the sushi rice was poorly prepared.  It tasted like rice straight out of a rice cooker with no additional preparations.  To be honest, Nobu has much better sushi.  

In addition, the fried rice was nothing to write home about.  It seems like all the trendy restaurants are serving up their own version of fried rice.  Well, let me pose a question:  have any of these chefs or sous chefs ever tasted fried rice? Yuck,  Iron Chef.

The standouts on the menu are black cod, tuna pizza, Japanese Uni and flaming chocolate globe.  The sake flights were pretty nice too.

Making a reservation was easy, and the hostesses were super friendly when we arrived. Neither of us had eaten there before, so we weren't very familiar with the food or drink menu. Our server, Jeff, recommended the wagyu manhattan which I will admit I was a bit skeptical about. In hindsight, it was easily the best cocktail I've ever had. I usually won't order the same cocktail twice at new restaurants because I like trying different ones, but in this case I couldn't help it. It seriously is that good.

Most of the food items we ordered also came from Jeff's recommendations. I could rave about every one of them. The sashimi was fantastic - even the spicy tuna taco appetizers were amazing. They have a really fun hamachi tartare dish that comes with caviar. If I had to pick a favorite, I'd probably go with the wagyu carpaccio. It was incredible. I also really enjoyed the bibimbap style dish they have (I forget the exact name) but it comes in a hot stone pot and was delicious!

2598185,2017-09-11,0,YTCCJ3ShO-zg0dlx1nk6dw,"Summary: Very good, but not amazing. Quality is excellent, flavors are very good, menu is creative and service is attentive. Value is alright, but some of the more popular items will not be very substantial. They also ran out of the popular chocolate dessert and didn't mention it early on despite a 6pm dinner reservation.

My wife and I visited Morimoto for the first time on a Monday evening for a 6pm reservation. We arrived a little early and got a couple seats at the bar to try the cocktails while we waited for our table to be ready. I ordered the Devil's Advocate and my wife got the Asian Pear, but after sipping our beverages we ended up swapping because we liked the other's drink better.

Soon our table was ready, so we closed out at the bar and were escorted over. The server walked us through the menu, highlighted the more popular items and mentioned some of the specials for the evening. Having done some reading on Yelp prior to our visit, we had a good idea what we were going to be ordering. Here is what we got:

Toro tartare - A thin layer of very soft and tender tuna accompanied by a variety of sauces and some crunchy bits for texture. They even provided a tiny spatula to scoop tuna and some sauce, then try the various flavor and texture combinations. The quality was excellent, but the quantity wasn't stellar for the price.

Morimoto sushi - Four pieces of layered fish (of different types) in cubes presented with a handful of little pipette tubes full of various sauces to pour on top and try different flavor combos. This is a nice idea, but with only four pieces of sushi and more pipettes provided a 1-to-1 trial isn't even possible. If you share the dish, you are further encumbered. That said, the sauces were pretty subtle to me, so not much additional impact from their presence. The fish was good, though.

Surf and Turf with Foie Gras - A piece of non-Japanese wagyu beef paired with a hamachi salad. We also added some foie gras to the top of the steak, which added a very nice touch to the very tender cut. This dish was very tasty and well prepared.

Spicy green beans - Classic dish well prepared with properly cooked green beans that weren't too firm or too soft, but were packed with flavor. The spice was good, though certainly nothing too intense.

All in all, the service was great and the food was excellent, but the value element was missing. We were also excited to try the flaming chocolate ball dessert, but they had run out by the time that we had ordered.",mrPUDzaxNQDc-JXG3JmuFw,1,0,4,ce7G5a7NdwyexH7tTDmZmg

Our server was extremely patient and took his time to explain the menu to us and elaborate on specialty items. He suggested we tried the sushi, because the soy sauce and sushi rice were special house made items created by Morimoto. He was right. The soy sauce was so flavorful without being too salty and the rice had an excellent texture to it. The fish was also very fresh. We also indulged in the uni oyster appetizer. This was probably my favorite dish of all HANDS DOWN. I don't typically like uni because it tastes very inky to me, but the uni on this appetizer was so creamy and rich. I think the moment that I bit into this appetizer, I saw ;my life coming together all at once. To my surprise, my boyfriend who hates the taste of oysters, also loved this dish! I think it was a definite game changer for him. 

When our meals were brought out, I was certain that they had mixed up our food with masterful art pieces. I kid you not. My lobster dish was too beautiful to dig into. You really do eat with your eyes first and with what I was seeing, I was already in a food coma. My dish was delicious, but my boyfriend's snake river steak was TO DIE FOR. Neither of us has ever tried a high-quality steak, so both of us were completely blown away. The flavor was so delicate and so flavorful all at once and the texture was like slipping into the softest pajamas made of heaven's clouds. If we were to go back (which we definitely will), I'd totally order the steak as my entree without any hesitation. 

Last but not least, our table ordered the most flamboyant dessert of all time. It was a chocolate sphere that they douse in rum and set aflame at the table. It was simply beautiful. Inside the sphere was ice cream and on the outside were these little kit-kat like cookies that were so rich and creamy in chocolate. Not only was this dessert a show for your eyes, but it was also definitely a party in my mouth! 

TL;DR
One of my favorite high-end restaurants to dine at! Beautiful dishes that tasted as amazing as they looked. Order the steak and you will not regret it!",ZT74lKiRseIhlJdVuZUYHA,0,1,5,0dpCnS4kIMF34MaHS67IAA

2662092,2017-07-19,0,YTCCJ3ShO-zg0dlx1nk6dw,"Oh. My. Gosh.

My boyfriend and I were spending a good amount of time after lunch deciding where we would go for dinner (got to make dinner reservations!).  After shuffling through endless options on Yelp and OpenTable, reaching the point of ""Let's just pick whatever and move on!"", Morimoto appeared in my search and the decision was quickly made.

Fast forward to dinner.  My partner and I were so impressed with the ambiance and were also overwhelmed by the fish and meat on display.  We were not ready for this.

I think our server, Jeff, could tell and let us know that he could explain whatever we wanted or needed to know, including the sake list.  Hearing ""sake"", my boyfriend immediately switched menus and scoured the listings.  After some inquiries and having extensive sake knowledge dropped upon us, we (he) settled on one of the bottles that paired really well with our dining experience.

Speaking of Jeff, we were truly appreciative of his knowledge of the food and sake and also the fact that he made us feel comfortable and at ease with such a high end experience.  This was definitely something new for me and my boyfriend, but Jeff made it approachable but extraordinary.

There was a lot on the menu that I wanted to explore, but I was really craving some sushi.  Having had mediocre sushi two weeks prior, this seemed like the ideal opportunity.  We settled on the wagyu beef carpaccio to share, the $50 chef's choice sushi for me, and the $55 chef's choice sashimi for my partner (I mention the prices because there are different price levels for the chef's choice which are based on how many pieces are given).

We did not have to wait too long (good thing because they were making sure our sake glasses were never empty) before our carpaccio came out.  WOW.  Just WOW.  Get this dish.  So tender.  Much impact.  It was a perfect way to whet our appetites.

Then came the sushi & sashimi trays, beautifully organized and displayed.  Our trays did come with different fish, my sushi tray including unagi (eel) and toro (fatty tuna), whereas my partner's sashimi platter had tako (octopus).  Jeff made sure to identify each piece that we would be enjoying before leaving us to dine.

I'm not normally a fan of tuna. However, Morimoto's tuna (even the non fatty piece) was so flavorful and perfectly tender to the bite.  Thankfully my boyfriend's sashimi plate had extra tuna pieces, so I traded some halves of my sushi for his sashimi haha.  Although I mention the tuna, I will say that every single piece was exquisite and on par with my dining experience in Tokyo at the famous Tsukiji fish market.

I was honestly good at this point, but my boyfriend did not want to tap out and ended up ordering an additional Eel & Avocado roll.  As we enjoyed this roll, he was insistent on trying the A-5 Wagyu.  Fearing my credit card balance, I pushed for the Wagyu nigiri.  Jeff, being the amazing server he was, swooped right in and confirmed that the nigiri would be the same A-5 Wagyu and that he personally recommended it over getting the 3 oz. piece at this point in the meal.  Whew.  Saved my wallet while still allowing us to enjoy an absolutely tender and melt-in-your-mouth piece of the Wagyu beef.

We ended the meal with Jeff's recommendation of the cheesecake souffle with blood orange sorbet (I hope that's the dish, if not then please correct me).  With an order of tea alongside it, it was the perfect way to end the meal.  The dessert was mildly sweet and felt light, which was exactly what we needed to end this beautiful experience.

I applaud the staff here for working so hard to ensure a wonderful dining experience for their guests.  Jeff, if you're reading this, contact me so that we can take you to the various places you mentioned in Southern California!",BK30JxkeE5Q8bI580igcAw,2,0,5,Dji6ix88gb0izxdhAQlddg

I was greeted by a very friendly hostess staff that seated me 20 minutes before my reservation.

While sitting at the high-top I was impressed by the initial presentation of chopsticks, glasses, and napkin, honesty something you'd see out of a traditional Japanese restaurant.

I was introduced to Jeffery (Jeff) my server for the night who was very bubbly, friendly, attentive, and knowledgeable.

I placed my order of ""sticky ribs"" as an appetizer and the ""angry chicken"" as my entree.

I also ordered the Tokyo Black porter as a drink which is easily one of the best Japanese craft beers I've ever had. Jeff arrived with the porter and gave me some information on the brewery, its location, and another beer he had from the brewery. This was a HUGE plus in my book being a craft beer fan.

My sticky ribs arrive and the waiter (not Jeff) explained exactly what I was getting as it sat in front if me. What the glaze was, how it was cooked, the garnish added... how incredible is that!!

My first bite into the ribs, they were fall-off-the-bone tender. The glaze on them was magnificent. There was just enough crunch on the edges to satisfy anyone. I wolfed them down and was quickly presented with a moist towel to clean off... A+ customer service all around!

Speaking of service, the busser/water filler for my table was incredible, not missing a beat and never allowing my cup to drop below 50% as well as removing my dishes in a prompt and clean manner!

Now back to my experience, Jeff would swing by the table, checking on me just enough. 

Next came in my angry chicken, again as the plate was lowered, the entire dish was explained from the sauces to what degree the chicken is cooked at. Upon finish of the explanation, I dug in.

The chicken was very moist and tender, the sauce for the chicken was out-of-this-world good! Slightly sweet but savory with a zing of peppers. The wing, breast and thigh was topped with rice noodles and surrounded by peppers. Slightly disappointed by the heat level, but I'll attribute that to my high spice tolerance. 

During my meal I had to call over the manager and compliment her on Jeff and the entire meal!

I grinded to a halt as the last bits of chicken entered my mouth, quite full from my endeavor.

Jeff, kind up until the very end, easily was one of the many highlights of the meal. Definitely deserved the 40% tip. There need to be thousands of more waiters like him!

I even made sure to tip the water boy which delighted him greatly and it was deserved.

I could not recommend this restaurant enough! Morimoto hired the perfect staff to put forward his representation of Japanese-American cuisine that is to die for!",54PyGYYuKLCVLnmI2zDsvQ,8,4,5,gCshZ3zPCaAwu8sAejmTcA

2887636,2017-01-10,1,YTCCJ3ShO-zg0dlx1nk6dw,"Whats to be said about the infamous Iron Chef that opens a restaurant in Las Vegas?  Welcome to the club!  Set in a former tepanyaki location in the fabulous MGM Grand.  Neighbor to that one chef that slaps a dash of seasoning on a dish and yells BAM!  You wouldn't be surprised to notice that there are still some tepanyaki grills in the back.  

Although you could not go wrong with the standard tables.  We opted to be entertained while we eat.  Best part of Morimotos tepanyak grills are, the women at the table are actually respected during this meal, rather than getting confronted with the usual harrasment at other Japanese grill spots in this town.  However hilarious they may be. 

The menu is surprisingly standard for semi Japanese fusion.  The sushi chefs all look legit.  There are traditional rolls and sashimi.  There are the obligatory poke ""tacos"" in fried eggroll shells.  There are the tuna tartare ""pizzas"" of course too.  Being completely honest, the first time we came those dishes were the bee's knees.  The second time they were a bit off.  

We slapped 2 (48oz?) tomahawk ribeyes on the grills both times we went.  Both times they were the highlights of the dinners.  The steaks come with 3 sauces.  Bernaise, chimichurri and Morimotos steak sauce.  We all know the first 2, but I'm pretty sure some of you have had the sweet and salty asian sauce at Korean bbg before.  Thats what Morimotos steak sauce tasted most similar to.

Getting down to desserts.  They get down on tha flo' wit those.  Deserts are not to be skipped at this spot.  The flaming rum chocolate smore ball plate!  The mango custardy bowl thingy!  The sorbet type whatever it was dish, and lest not forget, the super duper chocolate cakey cheesecake-ish desert were all Raku Sweets rivals in and of themselves.  Diabeetus.

We had our very own Morimoto impersonator with us.  My little brother.  It was fun seeing the servers double take as we were being seated, lol.  My 3 year old cried until he got the foot long bone of the tomahawk to knaw on.  We kept chewing on it until we got to the car.  My toddlers couldn't stop eating steak and the chef prepared some bits and pieces to well-done for them.  Very nice service all around.

It is nice to see a staff that takes pride in their establishment and quality of ingredients well worth the dollar value on the strip.  Sometimes the chef actually comes in to check on the progress too.  All aces.  I know I have given out too many 5 star reviews already, but Morimotos really does deserve it.

2972398,2018-04-19,1,YTCCJ3ShO-zg0dlx1nk6dw,"Coming here, I was expecting to be wowed, but while the food was in and of itself good, I was left overall disappointed. 

Ordinarily, I would give two stars, but I take into account Vegas prices being considerably higher, and the fiery awesomeness that was dessert.

Duck meatball soup had all the right flavors going. The broth was just the right mix of sourness, saltiness, and savoriness, with each flavor being delicate instead of in your face. The meatballs were cooked to perfection, and when combined with the soup nearly melted in your mouth.

While this part of the meal was a delicate rose, it was not without its thorns. Hence, here are my critiques.

First, I found the soup a little too simple. Awesomeness aside it was a broth with four small meatballs. This brings me to my second criticism: I feel that four meatballs for the amount of broth were too few; 6-8 would be just right. Finally, all these things in mind, $14 seems steep, even with Vegas prices. 

For my main course, I decided to splurge a little bit on the Toro Tartare. The toro used in this case was a medium fatty tuna (if I recall correctly), and goes for ~$150/pound!

Now, I'm a lover of fine foods and I've had several iterations of tuna tartare in my day. However, his one ranks low on my list, as it was remarkably unremarkable and underwhelming.

Don't get me wrong, the tuna was of excellent quality (although I had difficulty discerning this toro from regular tuna). The quantity was surprisingly small; about the area of a credit card, and the thickness of 2-4 coins. The consistency was somewhere between being finely chopped and minced. 

All the sauces and condiments are provided on the side. This comes as a double-edged sword... on the one hand, it allowed the tuna to shine while allowing my to experiment with various flavors. The sauces/condiments were well varied too. They weren't too exotic, which I guess is a good thing, as otherwise, people may not know what to expect from something they've never heard of before.

On the other hand, no transformation took place. You had some plain, raw tuna, and various condiments on the side. I can only imagine if this were an episode of Chopped, and toro was one of the ingredients. Zakarian, Samuelson, and Guarnaschelli are presented with a star ingredient where the only transformation is a change in consistency... yeah, I'm sorry but I don't think this guy is getting the $10K prize. The taste was okay, the presentation was okay, and creativity... what creativity?

I go to restaurants to have food of a level I cannot make myself. Given all condiments, sauce, and some tuna I feel I could make a dish no worse myself.

If this were it, I would have dusted off my hands, left them with 2 stars, and gotten on with my life... but then there was dessert. Seeing the image of a flaming chocolate ball in the window had wanting to take a chance, and I'm glad I did.

First, the presentation was definitely on point, it's really quite hard to beat something being on fire right in front of you. As for the flavors, just like with the duck meatball soup, all the flavors went together wonderfully. I liked that the level of sweetness was very delicate instead of being comparable to eating straight sugar. There was just a hint of bitterness (and I think sourness). All of this together made this a spectacular dessert. 

Though based on the ingredients it was simple, the creativity and presentation are what brought this dish above and beyond. 

The service was extremely polite, attentive, and knowledgeable. 

The location is larger than I was expecting, and has a very open, modern, all the while retaining a classy feel.",Y_NVgxBRcII68dSuwfNHAQ,1,1,3,mxUZpbZ_1XteZhUEsTehag

The calm miso soup was big, like a real soup bowl. The clams where nice but the broth way too salty. Worth $15? More like 7. 
The sushi. The fish was fresh and good quality but It lacked creativity in fish assortment, it was very boring. The tuna roll that came with it was kinda meh and boring too. The portion was also huge, mind you I got the smallest portion and I could only eat half. I would prefer less of it but better.

That's what happened with me and Morimoto Las Vegas--love at first bite.

To prepare yourself for a place such as Morimoto, you need to get the idea of all you can eat sushi taste as well as any other Sushi you've tried in your local Town that's considered the best sushi and throw that taste memory out the window for this experience. Once you've completed that task when you arrive at the restaurant sit down and prepare yourself for a culinary Journey. This restaurant is more than just a sushi place. The food here is eclectic, covering everything that you've seen him cover in his Iron Chef episodes, ranging from Italian to Thai to Japanese, of course. 

There are few signature dishes that you must try and if your server tells you about the Omakase menu which is a price fix menu for the evening, you should definitely get it.  We wanted to try everything that we've seen him do in Iron Chef episodes and fixed-price menu was perfect. Don't think about the number of courses that you are about to get because the food that you receive is filling and six courses is perfect. We did add on to items because we wanted to try it no matter what the case was and that was the tuna pizza and their special role of the day which, in this case, was the rainbow roll made with real snow crab not the imitation crab you find in other sushi restaurants.

We started with an appetizer that was not on the menu for our servers suggestion. The tune of pizza with anchovy aioli, topped with marinated purple olives, jalapeno, and greens, on a crispy tortilla cracker was a great starter. The crispy tortilla was as thin and as crisp as a cracker with the soft beautiful tuna sashimi and the perfectly salty and Briny aioli kicked off the evening with a bang.

Our first official Omakase course was an appetizer of tuna tartare made the way that he makes it on Iron Chef America. The tote are came in a square glass plate finely minced alongside several toppings including Wasabi, a sweet soy reduction, rice puffs, wasabi cream, and creme fraiche. A dipping sauce and crisp bread with Morimoto caviar completed the experience. It was decadent and fun to eat with a flat ""shovel"". After polishing off the tartare, I ate the sweet plum that comes with it to cleanse my palete for the next course.

Wagyu Carpaccio topped with Summer truffle shavings and lightly cooked in hot oil and soy was our next course. The walk was extremely tender and easy to melt in my mouth and with the shavings of Summer truffle and a few touches of microgreens it was the perfect bite. The size of the Carpaccio was absolutely perfect for the flavor that it gave. It was filled with unami. I honestly could have eaten three or four of them in a row.

The third course had to be one of the most fun dishes I've ever eaten. It was a fondue served with tomato inside the cheese as well as a touch of olive oil and a small sprig of rosemary. Around the fondue plate there was togarashi for heat, as well as fresh muscle, shrimp, fish balls made in House of course, as well as vegetables and something very unique that they make their, called a salmon ship. With the house noodles provided with the fondue plate, at the end I mixed the noodles in and it became a spaghetti course with an Asian Flair.

The 4th course was our Sushi course which consisted of the additional side order of rainbow roll which was their special role for the evening. The Maki was amazing, but the star of the entire course was the one nigiri piece of fatty tuna. It absolutely melted in my mouth and was one of the best things I've ever eaten. With just a touch of wasabi, each nigiri piece was amazing, from the Saba to the snapper. I believe the other critics when they say that Morimoto has the best sushi on the strip, hands down.

Finally the main course arrived which was our surf and turf. Are surf and turf for the evening was American wagyu cooked medium rare with shiitake mushroom and two types of sauce, grilled pearl onions, and micro bok choy, as well as a lobster tail and Claw served with purple potato and a sweet potato puree of some sort. Everything on the plate was amazing, from the wagyu that melted in the mouth and was perfectly cooked, as well as the lobster tail, which was tender, buttery,and sweet.

With our bellies full we successfully made it to the desert , which is the one you will see every time you look up Morimoto Las Vegas. This desert is his chocolate sphere filled with marshmallow whipped and a chocolate sorbet. It was just incredible. Textures abound and rich, it was the best ending to the experience.

I had the pleasure of visting Morimoto's original restuarant in Philedelphia last year. I had always watched him on Iron Chef and had heard good things about his growing restaurant empire. 

The beverage menu is extensive but I decided on a Thai Basil Smash which is a gin drink with St. Germain, pineapple, basil and a few other ingredients. The menu is broken up into quite a few categories and as our waiter explained, things are served family-style.

We decided to do the sushi combination so that we would be able to try a variety of fish. This ended up being the chef's choice of assorted nigiri which came with 10 pieces of nigiri and a 6-piece tuna roll. All fabulous and incredibly fresh.

For dessert we settled on the panna cotta which was described in painstaking detail when it arrived to us. I remember the words 'bird's nest' being part of it. It was served with some refreshing sorbet on the side.

Definitely an experience to save the time (and money) for at least once when you are in Vegas. I look forward to trying other Morimoto restaurants in places both near and far.",tm2ZW0fMczxDCT_wyFJkww,11,7,5,KqKiREKwGeZDW121DUBdqw

At no time did they bother to speak with us to greet us and ask what we would like. Big turn-off and buzz kill! 
The nigiri sushi was well over priced as well. Ranging from $9 to 16 per order and that is for one piece not two.  A Rainbow Roll order will set you back a whopping $35.  I ordered the Black Cod entree from the menu and it was horrible. Black cod by itself is a  very flavorful fish. The kitchen managed to ruin this dish by completely smothering it with teriyaki sauce. 
Other than that, the decor was beautiful!

I first had the Kakuni and Toro Tartare at Morimoto Philadelphia. The kakuni isn't sweet nor is it too oily. There's a good amount of meat that is extremely soft. The Toro Tartare is very fun to eat w/ the unique dips. Both are favorites of mine and a must order!

The Oyster Foie Gras was interesting but I felt that the teriyaki was a bit overpowering. I also would've rather had the oyster raw. Wouldn't order again for next time even though I love uni, oyster, and foie gras (a bit disappointing).

Absolutely loved the sashimi! Extremely fresh and highly recommend. Our waiter said about 90% of the fish is imported straight from Japan, so saves you a trip, right?

The Duck Confit Fried Rice was very flavorful with the egg cooked perfectly on top. Our friend who ordered the Duck Duck Goose loved the soup & the fried rice on his dish but didn't care for the slices of duck. He said he would just order the Duck Meatball Soup and the Duck Fried Rice next time. I tried some of the duck and was surprised how it didn't taste overwhelmingly like duck (which I'm not too much a fan of to begin with). The pieces were quite tender as they were cooked to a medium rare, so I enjoyed it.

I first tried the Fiery Salty Caramel Chocolate Tart at Morimoto Napa and always love how they pour the ""liquid fire"" over the chocolate dome. EXTREMELY chocolatey & sweet, that even among 3 people, we weren't able to finish everything. When I booked our reservation, it was to celebrate a friend's birthday, but he couldn't attend the dinner in time, so our waiter was nice enough to still bring us a sorbet that would've been for the birthday boy. The apricot sorbet was served w/ mixed fruit that was very refreshing. None of us are real fans of apricot so we were all surprised at how much we enjoyed the sorbet.

BF ordered the Wagyu Manhattan (per the suggestion of our waiter) and thought it was quite interesting, but unsure if he would ordered again. The Las Vegas Meets Japan is VERY floral, so none of the boys liked it. I love lavender so I liked the drink (Note: It is a bit of a creeper as the drink is very smooth, so be careful!)

If you get to the restaurant right when they open, you don't need to worry about reservations (yet). I had reservations at 5:15PM as I was told that was the earliest they had left. We got there at 4:50PM and immediately checked-in. Those who had the 5PM reservations were quickly seated once the restaurant was opened, however, while we were waiting, we noticed there were several walk-ins who were seated before us (we were the last ones to be seated). Not sure why we didn't get seated earlier if there was availability before the walk-ins. =/ Around 6:30PM, the restaurant did get full, so if you do want to eat around that time, then I highly recommend reservations.

Service was good though our waiter forgot to come back to get our entree order after we placed our appetizer order (and even left before one person in our party got to order their entree and had to flag him down later). It looked like there were several floor managers over-looking everything to make sure everything was going smoothly. Drinks were constantly re-filled (and occasionally tea even poured), and napkins folded when a customer left their seats.

Usually pork chops I've had are tough as it always comes out some degree of being overlooked but this dish came out deliciously juicy and I'm salivating again just writing this review. We also got a side of the duck confit fried rice which came with a sunny side/over easy egg which when mixed with the really thin and delicate pieces of rice created something amazing. (Side note: I've never had such delicate rice before and I'm Chinese) the sushi rolls were amazing and soft with fresh tuna.

The menu is very unique with a wide variety of foods which are meant to share. We started with the ahi tacos, can't go wrong with those, they come with three, but they allowed us to add one so we would not fight over the last one. Next we had the pork belly, it's so rich and tender. The meat melts in your mouth and it's just full of flavor.  Next up we tried the duck duck goose. I only wish my attempts at cooking duck looked like this. The duck leg was so tender and cooked and seasoned to absolute perfection. The fried rice with egg reminded me of my favorite breakfasts back on Oahu. Than we shared a shrimp tempura roll. I love that they didn't make it gigantic size. We ended with the salted caramel dessert which was so much fun to watch.

3196321,2017-06-26,0,YTCCJ3ShO-zg0dlx1nk6dw,"Morimoto was such a treat!  We ended up spending almost $300 per person, but it was sooo worth it!  The food was spectacular, the service was impeccable.

In our party of 4, 3 of us ordered the 6-course omakase/prix fixe with wine/sake pairing ($140 for the omakase + ~$70 for the wine.  You can choose either sake or wine, and you can also pair your own set of dishes.) Our other party member who was not a sushi fan ordered the angry chicken ($34), and though it was excellent (tender, flavorful, and juicy), she wished she had ordered the omakase with us and asked to substitute the raw fish dishes;).  Each of us savored every bite and were completely stuffed! 

The entire meal took about 3 hours from entry to exit (which was necessary to allow digestion and finishing wine between courses), so if you plan to order the Omakase, make sure you book an earlier reservation if you have to be somewhere like a show.;)  Most a la carte entrees ranged from $40-$50.  Japanese Wagyu price was not listed.

The Omakase (see picture included for each course):
Course 1: Tuna Tartare, beautifully arranged with 5 or 6 special condiments to mix and match as you like and a light sauce to go over it.  Very fresh, and the condiments went perfectly.  Someone said they saw it on the show ""Best thing I ever ate"".

Course 2: Wagyu beef carpaccio, probably the best dish of the entire meal.  Thinly sliced wagyu with a ginger sauce with the perfect balance of salty/sweet/tang, topped with some caviar and fresh herbs.  When no one was looking, I picked up the plate and drank the rest of the sauce!  Sooo good!

Course 3: Tomato/cheese fondue, with fish balls, shrimp, veggies, and a spoon of hand made udon noodle.  The fondue was served in a beautiful little bowl with a candle in it to keep things melty.  I'm not sure I was a huge fan of the cold fish ball, but the rest was absolutely delicious!

Course 4: Sushi course.  5 pieces of nigiri + 1 iron chef special square roll.  Fish so fresh and delicious!

Course 5: Surf and Turf.  Wagyu steak and lobster tail.  The sauces were paired perfectly with each.  The lobster tail was served with a smear of squash puree with a truly unique flavor.  Momentous, though by this point, we were already getting pretty full.  Although my belt was about to burst, I still finished every bite!;)

Course 6: Dessert - Chocolate marshmallow ball flambe with chocolate log and cookie.  They set it on fire at the table with a liquor.  Really tasty, particularly for chocolate lovers! 


The service was outstanding.  Our waiter was very knowledgeable and had great recommendations.  The wait staff was very attentive.  Courses were paced very well.  But best of all, Chef Morimoto happened to be there, and our waiter was able to get him to come over and take picture with us!!!  We used up all our luck on dinner, so slots went downhill from there!;)

The décor was very modern and clean, great ambiance.  They also have a teppanaki section.  Not sure how that experience is or how much that cost, but you can request it.  

In short, highly recommend to anyone looking for a fancy, delicious, special occasion meal.  It costs a pretty penny, but it is worth the experience!",jCX5oTJRi-pqzilAjjxl7w,2,1,5,bLyJj-_5EByuaDYc9pArsw

Decor and ambiance is the standard casino style. They all have this odd sleek, modern minimalist, steel gray, with super low lighting, blend into the background look to them that I guess plays to being a upscale romantic destination...however very generic imo. 

Into the food and service! The menu is expansive as well as expensive. Some things made sense price point wise, like the 57oz (give or take an ounce) tomahawk steak for 170 but other things kept you scratching your head why. Ordered a variety of a la carte sushi and sashimi along with an eel avocado roll and the soft shell crab roll. Sushi and sashimi were all super fresh and well crafted. The rolls were a bit too loosely rolled but flavor components were spot on. 

We shared the 16 oz snake farm Rib eye steak and the 48 hour cured and brined double cut pork chop as well. Both cuts of meat were phenomenal and executed beautifully. Pork chop came with a bed of sautéed housemade kimchi and that was super delicious too. Ordered the spicy string beans as a side for more ruffage but sadly they were under seasoned lackluster. The chilled green tea soba noodles had a nice body and chewiness to them too. 

Our server was really nice and attentive without being obtrusive and also treated us to a complimentary Japanese style cheesecake for dessert and it was a beautiful way to end the evening for sure!

Service was great, our server was exceptional at upselling their dishes but what upset us was that he recommended some plates to us that were just subpar and unimpressive.

3332568,2018-05-20,0,YTCCJ3ShO-zg0dlx1nk6dw,"This review is for 4.5 stars. 

Morimoto food is just fantastic. Their ability to fix mistakes could use some work but they definitely tried. This review is only under 5 stars because of the back and forth service quality. First, we reserved teppanyaki table for 6 about 2 months out to make sure we had placement. They saved 5 seats for us only, leading us having to wait 15 minutes for them to bring over a bar seat that was 3 inches higher than everyone else with no space on the side of the table. Then, the menu was just very confusing with the a la carte and teppanyaki experience and the waiter didn't do a great job of explaining. Still we got a few free items for our wait which all but makes up for it. But 2+ hour dinner for just an entree seemed excessive. 

As stated before, everything I ate was ridiculously tasty. For our wait we received free salted edamame and sticky ribs. The ribs were some of the best I've ever had and just fell off the bone. The edamame was just a nice opener. No spices, just salty. I also ordered an absinthe concoction that was perfectly leveled with alcohol taste but enough fruit flavor that was perfect for a Japanese meal. 

For entrees, as a group of 6, we touched just about everything. We had a few rolls, asparagus side, few duck fried rice, and spicy green beans. Of those, the rice was good but more a pilaf than fried, with not enough duck to make it worth $14. The green beans had no spice but simply a Chinese sauce similar to an XO. Asparagus would be my pick for our best side. About 4 large asparagus, sliced into perfect sizes, in some tasty sauce. 

For dinner a few had filet, 1 lobster, and 1 chicken cooked on grill in front of us. I had the miso cod. From what I rated, the lobster was fantastic and the standout. Really grilled and sliced in half so you get to enjoy it all. Filets were just a nice steak, worthy of any Japanese steakhouse. Chicken was cooked interestingly in front of you with the smoking style, but not a must. The black cod was fantastic, especially at under $40. Unfortunately it didn't come with sides as most things are a la carte at the restaurant, sans a few veggies or dipping sauces for all. If you like miso sauce, this dish will blow you away. Strong flavor and so much sauce, so make sure you get a side that's suitable for dipping because the sauce is unbelievable. 

Considering this is Vegas strip restaurant, especially at the overly-expensive MGM, Morimoto is very affordable. Entrees at about $40-60, sides under $15, and drinks under $20. I would highly recommend Morimoto for any meal - special occasion or just for a nice vacation meal. The teppanyaki is not a show you would expect at chains, so I would recommend reserving a table and just getting a good meal instead.",JaqcCU3nxReTW2cBLHounA,3,2,4,YiteAGpxFTdLLIIOUSZ0KQ
3335166,2016-11-18,0,YTCCJ3ShO-zg0dlx1nk6dw,"The best black cod I've ever had. Cooked perfectly, flaky and moist, delicious miso sauce. Quite rich- the one piece on the plate was enough.

Presentation was neat with the carafe in an ice bowl. Now, the highlight: their flaming chocolate marshmallow ball. This desert plate is massive and probably good for 2-3 people. Indulgent.

For appetizers we had the Tuna Pizza and the Oyster Foie Gras.  The oyster was in the top 5 bites of food I've ever tasted.

We also had the 10 piece sushi platter along with the pork chop.  Again the sushi was out of this world, and undoubtedly best pork chop I've ever had.

Now why did I only give the restaurant only 3 stars.

First, we made a reservation at 5:30 because we were seeing Phish on Halloween.  The arena was approximately a 3 minute walk from the restaurant.  We wanted to go into the arena no later than 7:15 to avoid the rush.  I was taking my girlfriend for dinner so we had one ""swanky"" food experience.  Plus I have never had a chance to eat Morimoto's food and have wanted to since I was obsessed with Japanese Iron Chef.

Next, we ordered food and I asked for a sake selection.  Told this would go good with my appetizers.  Then it arrives 3/4 of the way though the appetizers.

What do you think would have come next??  Pork Chop.  Again, where is my delicate tasting sushi.  Well it's now in front of us and hot.  See above re: Pork Chop.

And now we wait, and wait, and wait for sushi to arrive. Seems odd since there are 7 sushi chefs and place wasn't packed.  At some point our server brings over a small amt of soy sauce to dip sushi in. (I prefer the it this way).  We eventually inquire and we are then told expediting it.  Then for another while many ""I'm Sorry.""  So it comes, we inhale it cause it's already 7:15. (and our mouth's take like pork chop).

Was very interested in the flaming chocolate thing, but alas we are out of time.  Hurriedly pay the bill and run out of there.  Now, I am not one to ask for something from them, but c'mon, nothing, no gesture....oh and many more ""I'm sorry"".  I was prepared to spend good money, but yea.

With that said, it's just as good as Napa but it is a bit more expensive than the Napa location. A few dollars here and there between some dishes. 

Toro Tartare - I love the presentation and it taste great but it's a bit difficult to eat.
White fish carpaccio - The hot oil they drizzle on top cooks the fish just a bit. I eat sashimi but still prefer my fish cooked so this is perfect as you get the best of both worlds.
Duck Duck Goose is fantastic, especially the fried rice. It's duck cooked four ways. The leg came a bit dry and our server Aries was awesome and offered to bring me another. The second one was perfect and delicious.
Braised black cod - was flavorful and moist but I've had better just a few days ago at Nobu. 

I asked for a virgin cocktail, they brought me a mango match punch (virgin) it was awesome. One of the best mocktails I've had.

Don't get me wrong, the fish was super fresh and the portions of fish were sizeable, however for $135 dollars I was expecting something more tus just your Americanized sushi bar. I got the chefs sushi sampler and I was blown away by the amount of food I got. Unfortunately they are making up for quality with quantity. 

The Chef's sushi sampler was an assortment of nigiri (hamachi, Saba, unagi, salmon, shrimp, tuna and fatty tuna) with three maki rolls: a beautiful symmetric mosaic roll, a mackerel and chives roll and your standard shrimp tempura roll. As I said, the fish was great, fresh and big portions. I got real grated wasabi (not just horseradish with green food coloring) and the fatty tuna was buttery and melt in your mouth  fresh, however the rolls were disappointing. The mackerel and chives roll was overpowered by the chives, and the ebi tempura roll was forgettable. I would have much rather had tako or even a spicy tuna roll Instead. 

The service was also not what I would expect from Morimoto. I arrived at 5 pm so that it wouldn't be too crowded. The hostess that took me to my table either was having a bad day or has resting b*tch face syndrome. One of the staff members gave me a plate of sashimi (which I thought was part of my chef's special) and then another one took it away a few minutes later. Lucky for them and the guy who ordered the sashimi, I hadn't put my chopsticks on the sashimi plate yet. This made me somewhat sad as I was given an awesome sashimi plate, gotten my hopes up and then it was taken away with no apology or acknowledgement from the server. 

My server was attentive and the food was prepared quickly, however once I paid and left, not the sushi chefs at the bar where I was sitting, not the wait staff, not even the hostesses said anything on my way out. It made me feel as if they were thinking: ""great, we got his money, we don't have to be nice or care if he comes back or not""

I don't know if I'd come back. I didn't find the chefs selection particularly creative or inspired especially compared to other sushi places or sushi Ota in San Diego. The service was alright I guess, but I rather see a show with that money instead of spending it on decent sushi.",IE5uZ99T0xIgOm3tfPmsUg,0,0,3,amP5bMLGDS4c5sO29mo-4A

We told the server we wanted to start with appetizers then choose our main, either sushi or one of the plates. We waited another 35 minutes for the menus to be brought back  to us, and at that point were wondering if our last appetizer was coming out. The server said she forgot to order it and asked if we still wanted it. I said yes and she bailed before we could order our main...again we waited then were over spending more money.

We were in Vegas last September and this place wasn't opened yet, so needless to say I was super excited to see a Morimoto in Vegas this time around.  It was added to our list for this year's visit.  There was much anticipation for our last dinner in Vegas before our departure.  

Unfortunately we were disappointed with the food.  We started off with an appetizer, I had Laksa soup and my spouse had miso clam soup.  Then the main dishes; my husband had miso glazed black cod with a side of rice and I had roasted pork with Kim chi and a side of butter potatoes.  The black cod was really good and with the rice it was perfect, but I can honestly say it's comparable to Soho, and at Soho it's more economical.  

The biggest disappointment was the roasted pork, because pairing it with the Kim chi ruined the flavour of the pork.  Pork was cooked to perfection, tender, moist and juicy.

Also, miso soup, is miso soup - but at Morimoto's it was outstanding (please note that it is big enough for two people). The Miso Black Cod was good, and if you haven't had it before I would recommend, but Nobu still wins on the cod. The egg on the Duck fried rice, to die for, but the rice itself - long grain - was just so/so. MUST TRY the donuts!

First off, the service was fantastic. My glass was never half full (they managed to do this without feeling over bearing), and our waiter Jeff was so knowledgeable and polite. He even offered to create a menu for us based on tastes that we told him we enjoyed.

We passed on his offer, however, but were really happy with our choices. The yellowtail buri bop seems like a typical rice dish on paper, but it turns out to be quite the experience! They bring out a blazing hot stone bowl with rice and yellowtail sashimi in it. They then sear the raw fish in the sides of the bowl and fry the rice with an egg and sweet soy sauce. In the end, you get a delicious bowl of sweet rice and perfectly tender and seared fish. It was amazing.

The Morimoto chirashi was probably the best dish we got and the best chirashi I've had. It came with tons of variety (menu says 10-12) including salmon, tuna, octopus, egg, salmon roe, yellow tail, eel and some other types of fish that I gladly devoured without knowing what they were.  All this was served on top of delicious sushi rice and it just all tasted so good. I usually scarf down my food but I made sure to savor every bit because it was just that good!

Like I said, eating here is an entire experience. The servers are so knowledgeable and have that typical Japanese politeness and kindness. Like they say, Chef Morimoto really blended Japanese cuisine with a lot of other cuisines, and you can tell from the menu. There is not only fresh sushi, but also a lot of other types of meats and fish from different cultures and inspirations. It's definitely pricy, being in the MGM and all, but you're in Vegas so what can you expect? I'd say it's a beautiful experience, just like any Vegas show that you'd go to, and it's worth the try!",MKTrPMPWriQuc5GkuYpFcQ,4,0,5,iodDAUZxVbSMrzgEviDEGA
3630838,2017-02-08,1,YTCCJ3ShO-zg0dlx1nk6dw,"You know you're going to have a magical experience when dining at Iron Chef's Morimoto's signature restaurant. Located in the MGM, the space and ambiance is modern and intimate with high ceilings and beautiful minimalistic decor. My boyfriend and I came here for our BAEgas trip and were definitely happy with our choice.

We started off with the chef's combination sushi, which comes with 10 pieces of nigiri and a roll. I don't quite remember all of the items included but the halibut, toro and sea bass were definitely the standouts. The fish is very fresh and up to par with some of the higher end sushi restaurants. The spicy tuna roll was one of the best I've had yet, and I don't even really care for spicy tuna rolls! This isn't your average chopped up bits and pieces of leftover tuna you don't want anymore. The roll had nice, fatty chunks of tuna along with a douse of spicy mayo. 

For our entrees, we went with the ishi yaki kakuni bop and the surf and turf. Reminiscent of bibimpap, the ishi yaki kakuni bop had kakuni pork cooked over a hot stone bowl with vegetables and a jidori chicken egg, followed by a generous pour of soy and sake marinade. Once finished cooking after a nice demo from our waiter, the sweet and savory rice becomes soft and fragrant with chunks of rich, fatty, melt-in-your-mouth pork. The surf and turf included a piece of snake river farms wagyu beef and a chilled hamachi (yellowtail) crudo on the side. You really do get the best of both worlds with this dish. The wagyu beef was so tender and buttery and the combination of fried black garlic and nuoc cham flavor was just heavenly. The cold hamachi salad was a nice contrast to the beef and definitely a nice palate refresher. 

Ah, but the magic doesn't stop there. We had just enough room for dessert and decided to go with the Coconut Mango. Mango mousse, coconut cake, charcoal meringue and coconut green tea sorbet topped with fresh passion fruit. Trust me when I say you've never seen a dessert like this before. I had a few reservations about how tasty this flavor combination could be but the first bite and each bite following after that was extraordinarily good.",AsUvXYx9ZVn3IMJmAIwhYw,5,3,5,OYFVVLlZsbH4Sj_AyQNlqQ

Overall though, we enjoyed our experience dining at Morimoto's.  

We came during off peak, after new year's but made reservations anyway.  When we arrived, the place was half full so turns out didn't need formal reservations.  For some reason the hostess seated us at a small table right beside the entrance of the restaurant, we politely asked if we could sit inside and enjoy the ambiance of the place.  (not sure why she would do that considering it was half full)  

In terms of the décor of the restaurant, it's definitely very pretty and as mentioned before if you want to impress your date this is a go to spot.  

In terms of food and drink we tried the following: 2 cocktails, duck rice with egg, sushi combo, pork belly, black cod, and doughnuts and the chocolate fireball for dessert.  

In terms of the menu, I believe its seasonal, so I'm sure some items you see on yelp you may not be able to get, but the core items are usually always there.  

As for the food and drink: the cocktails we both got weren't anything special (both fruit flavored), next time I would probably pass and just get a beer or soda.  In terms of food, the one we liked the least was the pork belly (kakuni).  The pork belly was dry and bland, you will easily find better pork belly at a popular Chinese restaurant.  

On the other hand the duck rice with egg, sushi combo, and black cod were all very good.  In terms of presentation and taste, one of the best I've tasted.

As for dessert, for me I actually liked eating the doughnuts better than the chocolate fireball.  The chocolate fireball of course looks great posting on yelp, but the actual taste is just ice cream and cake.  The doughnut is basically a play on a Chinese doughnut with cream filling.  

Overall, for 2 people with drinks and 3 to 4 entrees, you're probably going to run around 150 to 200 easily.   If you're okay with spending that much I would definitely recommend Morimoto's next time you're in sin city.",NwLYr1MqjVvHWg5UtSc6cg,2,0,4,xMFIjvM8xKpoDmCC0gyIhQ

Then we had the oysters w/foie gras. You gotta have this. Beautifully selected large oysters, none of the small oysters of course. 

Tried the spare rib's. I thought this was okay, but my husband and friend liked it a lot. I'm not that big of a meat eater. It was good, but I think there were other things I would have tried instead.

Plus, everyone knows who he is as a famous chef.  

My wife and I managed to find 2 seats in the middle of the bar on a Saturday evening around 8pm which was pretty nice since it didn't have a lot of seats to begin with.  John was our bartender and he was both nice and helpful.  

My wife was feeling adventurous so she ordered the Pear Martini and I went with a Pinot Grigio.  My wine was good but she felt her drink didn't hit the mark so she switched to champagne.  We had an idea of what we wanted to try after reading the menu beforehand so we were prepared.

We went small plates as we usually do and ordered the Tuna Pizza, Morimoto Sashimi, Grilled Hamachi Kama and the Hamachi Tacos to start.  We then went with the Rock Shrimp Tempura.  Here were the results:

Hamachi Tacos:  I would give them a 5.  Nothing special about them and too much avocado.
Tuna Pizza:  Complete fail here.  It was so salty that we had to send it back after 1 1/2 slices.
Grilled Hamachi Kama:  Loved this.  It was tender, flavorful and had a crisp to it.
Morimoto Sashimi:  This was good, a little hard to eat with chopsticks but had creative sauces.
Rock Shrimp Tempura:  The Kochujan Sauce was good.  The Wasabi Aoli was over-sauced.

So the end result was mixed and leaned more towards disappointment since the only thing we loved was the Hamachi Kama. The Morimoto Sashimi was good and half of the Rock Shrimp Tempura we enjoyed.  Maybe the chef was just having an off-night.

One irritating thing happened when we got our bill, we had Edamame on there that wasn't ours and also another menu item which made it appear as if our bill was mixed up with someone else's.  Our bartender did take off the Tuna Pizza since it was so salty.  I just don't see us returning at this time because with all the places in Las Vegas, you expect a higher level of experience here and we felt it missed the mark.",ruqe3slVDfXdXVMPtM976g,2,1,3,9GX-A4TbkF9aDEYOiJJxIQ

We sat down for dinner here this past weekend and I am so happy we did. Sue was our server and she was SO friendly. Like scary friendly, in a good way. Just so sweet. 

DRINKS:
I don't like carbonated water, because what's the point of carbonated water? Seriously, why is carbonated water such a thing?! But, Sue thought I said yes, so she brought it to us. My hubs drank it while the other server brought me regular water. But... we also ordered some sake. Bonsai Bunny sake. Mmmmmm It was sweet but good!

FOOD:
Spicy Tuna Tacos:
Delicious. The tuna quality was so good. I know people are thinking, Oh I've had tuna tacos, they are all the same. NO. NO. They are not. These tacos were amazing. The tuna was so clean and just melted in my mouth. It was so good. It didn't fall apart too like you'd expect from a regular place. This here isn't a regular place... this is Morimoto!!!

Pork congee:
This was the BEST dish ever. The pork was perfectly cooked where it melted in your mouth. The congee was so flavored. I could have this EVERY SINGLE DAY. It was so good. 

Yellowtail bibap:
A little too salty for my taste. I was kinda depressed at how salty it was. Everything was so perfect and then this was kinda a disappointment. I ate the whole thing because it was still expensive but still... salty.

Pork chop:
OMG. This was another amazing meal. Each pork chop is cut perfectly to still be savory. The quality was impeccable. It was so good. The sauce and the extra stuff around it was so good. 

Dessert:
Japanese cheesecake - so I thought this would be like Uncle Tetsu which is nearby my place, but it wasn't. The cheesecake was like cheesecake but softer and delicious!!! The dessert sides complimented the cheesecake, including the sorbet with graham cracker shredding. Mmmm... It was so good.

AMBIANCE:
Very posh. Very Hollywood or Vegas. The decor is nice. It wasn't jaw dropping, but it was still nice. What can you do? It's Vegas. They can't be too foo-foo-y.

BATHROOMS:
Only one women's stall. Meh... it smelled like cigarette.

SERVICE:
Great service. Sue was great. 

OVERALL: 
It was great, but avoid the bibap if you don't like salty.",evDmfYHbxqDAy8_27bAUNg,5,3,4,g6K7nCi4U70sQcLzogvO1g

Since we wanted to have a real sampling of his artistry we opted for the tasting menu. Each of the six courses was exquisitely prepared. The attention to detail was remarkable, and of course the fish was fresh and perfect. 

To add to the fun, Morimoto himself was on site watching over things. He came over to our table and greeted us and then came over to offer the chance for a photo with him. I mentioned to him the he was our favorite Iron Chef and he responded, ""Mine too!""

We had his family toro, a beef carpacio, his Japanese interpretation of the Italian did bagna cauda, wonderful sushi, a wagu beef and lobster sure and turf, and his famous flaming chocolate ball.

Add a couple of specialty cocktails and some saki and we had a great meal. Not for timid eaters or tightwads, but for a foodie a fabulous experience.",FPX2JrfFRdqLMfv7S00thg,2,4,5,vlVhiyH9OoC4wsnPhssRtA

It's all kindof fine. The sticky ribs were good. The ishi yaki buri bop was also very tasty. The sushi was fresh and nicely presented.

The sushi ""tacos"" were very forgettable. I already forgot what was in them. And the rock shrimp tempura was nice....but very small and expensive for what it is.

So it's all okay. As food goes, it's just nothing special. It's kindof like watching the TNT channel on a lazy saturday - not necessarily a waste of time, but not particularly memorable. The difference is that TNT is cheaper than Morimoto. Which is where I feel like they lose 1/2 a star. They aren't so expensive, but pricey enough that I feel like without any standout dishes, it isn't really a place to pass the time unless you just have more money, time, and calorie allotments than I do.

A bigger complaint I have is that for a place like this, service is crucial for me. At some point, nice food places (especially on the Strip), are a dime a dozen so service should be great to help distinguish a restaurant. But they lose a whole star for service. The lady refilling our drinks consistently spilled everytime she refilled without wiping away anything. When they cleared our plates, they also consistently reached across us and between us so they wouldn't have to walk around our small 4 seat table. And they kept interrupting our conversations to say ""would you like to order more food?"" So that's rude and unnecessary. 

It's an okay place. If you're staying at MGM and don't feel like venturing out, then go for it. But it's not a must eat.",yZVoXTvybz0LMItl0bRzxA,2,0,3,QkWKdf1Oza1qtOUMEkiM2g

4041014,2017-05-22,2,YTCCJ3ShO-zg0dlx1nk6dw,"Masaharu Morimoto is a marketing genius as much as he is a great chef and entrepreneur. He is one of the three most well-known celebrity Japanese/American chefs in the US alongside Nobu Matsuhisa and Masa Takayama and uses that recognition to his advantage growing his Morimoto restaurant empire worldwide. The Las Vegas location of Morimoto didn't fail to impress regarding decor, food, and service for the most part, and wasn't too bad either in terms of value.

Decor

Morimoto is located in the former space that was occupied by Shibuya, my (former) favorite sushi joint on the strip. I was quite disappointed when I decided to drop by for some sushi at the bar last year to find Shibuya sporting an 'Under Construction' sign, but then I found some happiness seeing another sign next to it saying 'Morimoto Coming Soon'! I decided I had to try it the next time I was in Vegas. Regarding decor, the restaurant layout from Shibuya seemed to have gone largely unchanged, with most of the visible changes being in the artwork and design. Having spent nearly $1M on renovations, either there were a lot of back of the house changes, or the designer overcharged. I have to say I loved the backdrop of the sushi bar - my favorite part of the restaurant.

Food

My overall impression with the quality of the food at Morimoto was that the overall concept was excellent, the quality was great, but there were some misses as much as there were some hits and home runs. As per our modus operandi trying a new (to us) Japanese restaurant, we asked for the Morimoto Omakase - the omakase is usually the chef-designed, best-available, and personalized meal delivered to impress the individual diner. Morimoto's omakase consisted of seven courses with a sake/wine pairing that we added on.

The omakase started off with the Morimoto Toro Tartare. This dish hit my 'ten best things I've ever eaten in my life' list upon my first bite. The competing and complementary flavors of the accoutrements of the toro set off this mind-blowing flavor explosion. Then came the Wagyu carpaccio with white truffle - melt in your mouth amazingness. The next dish was the broiled oysters with uni and foie gras, another quick add to my top ten list. After the first three crazy delicious courses, things turned quite standard, sadly.

The rest of the dishes, including the sushi, were good at best. The quality of sushi was ok, not any better than what you would find at a good local sushi joint in a strip mall. Even the selection of sushi for the omakase was about as vanilla/boring as they come - tuna, snapper, salmon, yellowtail, bass, maki.

The main course of lobster and wagyu filet was a disappointment. The lobster was overseasoned, and the filet was tough and chewy, consistency akin to being defrosted in a microwave or sitting under a heat lamp way too long (which neither I hope would be the case here). Some parts of the meal were confusing too: an Italian-inspired shabu-shabu/fondue? The dessert was also an over-the-top flaming chocolate creation that was great but seemed out of place for the omakase. The richness of the chocolate overwhelmed the rest of the meal preceding. I love chocolate, but I would have enjoyed more of a lighter, fruit-based dessert matching the spring season.

The overall wine and sake pairings were good but were not presented professionally nor in a knowledgeable fashion. We felt that either the sommelier didn't think we had an appreciation for good wine pairings nor was she as attentive as one should be for pairing a tasting menu. I love wines from varied regions, and equally love how each varietal, region, and vintage complement different dishes. I wanted to hear how the sommelier's selection for each course made that course better with the pairing, but I was left hanging and disappointed.

Service & Value

Having made reservations months in advance, seating was immediate and near the sushi bar as we wanted. I just wanted to make sure I had a good backdrop of the bar for my selfie, and it worked! Service overall was great, with some disappointments in the sommelier service, but the server and support staff (bus, food runner, etc.) were on point. The value was somewhat questionable, as I wasn't sure if our experience was really worth $300 per person (Morimoto omakase plus wine/sake pairing and tip.) Maybe without the pairings and having just the omakase with cocktails would have held greater value to us.",sRllSaD1Evx4Z8doDDgS0g,9,8,4,o0h_mSSWZKXg5l9Yqix8dw

Morimoto Service:  Our server Prince was on point throughout the evening for our party of 10.  He asked if we wanted to go family style or individual orders and he made suggestions to ensure the best experience.  We went family style and everything he suggested worked out great.  Drinks kept flowing parallel to the conversation all night, top notch.

Morimoto Cuisine:  I sampled a lot, here are my faves.  The hamachi tacos was my favorite appetizer as the Yuzu Kosho and avocado worked so well together.  The ishi yaki buri bop/yellowtail on rice was cooked in a hot stone bowl at the table.  Fun to watch and Snap, but even more fun to eat.  The Braised Black Cod was prepped perfectly and delicious.  The Fiery Salty Caramel Chocolate Tarte is the flagship dessert for a good reason.  Aesthetically pleasing but more importantly, very tasty and I'm not really a chocolate dessert guy.

Morimoto Ambiance: Beautifully designed with classy Japanese decor throughout the restaurant.  The lighted wall behind the sushi chefs had murals of Japanese pics in black and white and really made the main dining room. It's definitely a restaurant that can be used for special occasions and date nights.  Very attractive and elegant.

All the dishes I tried were prepped well and high quality ingredients were used.  The service was top notch and enhanced the experience.    This is a great place for business dinners if the expense account is getting debited.  For non-business dinners, get ready to rack up a bill if you're hungry as the food is tasty but the portions small.  Either way, you're in for a good experience at Morimoto.

As a party of 5, we had an opportunity to try a good variety of their signature dishes, along with their omakase ($140.00/pp). If you love omakase, but your dining companions don't, no need to fret. Just come here! Why? Because this is one of the very, very, very rare restaurants that doesn't require that the entire table goes omakase. In fact, only one person in our table, a 13-year old, no less, opted for the omakase. 

Some of their signature dishes we tried were:

Hamachi Tacos - Perfect! I could've eaten all 5 of these mini tacos all by myself. Ok, so I'm getting ideas now for my next visit! Lovely chilled hamachi paired perfectly with the crunchy, fresh tortilla, and just the right amount of avocado and jalapeño peppers. 

Oysters Foie Gras - super fresh, fleshy, with uni and foie gras. Say yes to the oysters!

Sticky Ribs - served bone-in. This was probably my least favorite, but lauded by the waiter as one of their most popular dishes. Overly sauced, for my personal taste. 

Deep fried shrimp served 2 ways - in a wasabi sauce, and  the other was in a light red sauce with a hint of Korean flavoring, but can't recall the official name. It also came with a homemade buttermilk dip. The tempura-like batter held up well, and retained its crunchiness, as this was just lightly coated with their respective sauces. Even as this dish sat a while, uneaten, as we were devouring the other delectables, it's crisp crunchiness held up, amazingly.

Fried Rice with Hamachi - Rice itself was a tad saltier than it needed to be, but the star of this dish was really the fish, which was cooked at the table by searing it against the sides of the searing hot iron pot. Wow! The fish turned out so incredibly moist and flaky. I wish they had this dish with just the fish, sans the rice.

We also ordered a huge sushi combo, which consisted of something like 35 pieces. Slices of fish were exceedingly fresh, fleshy and sliced in generous portion sizes. One disappointment, however, was that we weren't informed that the 35-ish piece count included rolls and tamago (small chunks of scrambled-like eggs). This seemed a little disceiving.

The omakase was very plentiful and artistically presented. Some of the dishes included lobster, tartare, A5 slices (ooh so tender), a seafood bouillabaisse-like dish, and a beautiful 6-piece sushi platter.  Check out my photos. One of the best parts of this pre-set omakase menu, though, was the chocolate bomb dessert it came with. Ooh, a most impressive presentation when they poured a fiery liquid on top of the round chocolate ball, and melted it, causing the chocolate ball to ooze out a liquidy chocolate center. If I could order this dessert separately, I most certainly would!! Plus, it tasted even better than it looked, and it looked pretty darn good! Trust me here!

Speaking of desserts, I'd be up for coming back just for the desserts alone. The doughnuts were perfectly fried, and uniquely presented in a cone, with a round plastic ball filled with pastry cream.

My little side dish came out LAST and a lot later than my friends. My friends ordered the duck duck goose too so I don't understand why my fried rice took so long. Should be same batch no? The rice was hard like I was eating the rice at the bottom of the stone pot. Also, my egg was not fully cooked, it was still runny on the inside. I joked with my friends that my rice took so long because they were googling how to fully cook an egg lol.

My friend had the oyster foie gras and boy that thing was TINY! She also had the toro tartare. She did say they both tasted pretty good. I tried my friend's crispy whole fish and that was great.

For dessert, we all shared:
Coconut Mango - My favorite dessert because I like both coconut and mango. It was refreshing.
Chilled Cheesecake Souffle - Cheesecake was very soft and fluffy, I liked the flavor.

The culprit - the 'spicy sauce' used for spicy rolls. It's a taste I've never experienced before, neither at a sushi restaurant nor otherwise. It gives the sushi a truly rotten flavor, which is such a shame because the actual fish seemed quite nice.

The spicy rolls were so terrible, that we tossed 8 of the 12 pieces we ordered (bye-bye $25!)

There was a man sitting there who was clearly unhappy saying ""100 bucks for this"" and I don't blame him. There was nothing entertaining about it, portions looked small and it seemed to drag on forever as they shaved meat off large bones on the grill which was grossing me out. Looking at the Teppan menu it's all about the Wagyu beef with no option to order chicken, shrimp, vegetarian or seafood. If you are looking for a traditional Teppan grill experience save yourself the cash and disappointment by booking a reservation at Benihana. 
Over in dining service was slow, portions were small and I've had better sushi from grocery stores. My husband ordered a surf & turf that was over cooked, didn't taste all that good and left him with food poisoning diarrhea later on that night. For that reason I give Morimoto 1 star. Their bathroom was terrible as well, 1 toilet and so dark you couldn't even see what you were doing. Not what you would expect from a high end restaurant at all. Wish I would of ate at the other sushi place in the MGM, at Morimoto it's all hype and you certainly don't get what you pay for.",z8dHBJGGR8WJ5ol7zijKUg,0,0,1,km8qC16vAPaZj7MRpdN8Uw

We had the omakase menu so I got to try a bit of everything!

The highlights:
The toro was served on a neat little palette with 6 different seasonings you can try. That was just melting in my mouth.

We had this seafood bisque and it was served over a little fire to keep warm. That soup was delicious. The broth was so flavorful and creamy.

We had six pieces of nigiri. Each fish tasted fresh.

We had this surf and turf with wagyu beef and lobster. I wasn't a big fan of the lobster since I normally don't like that anyways. The wagyu was really good though. It was really tender and rare. Definitely can taste the quality.

For dessert, we had a chocolate ball that was lit on fire to reveal the ice cream inside. It was too rich for me to finish but it was a nice way to end the meal.

Our server was super attentive the whole meal. He explained each course with patience. Super knowledgeable about his stuff!

For our entree we shared the second level sushi selection, 9 fish selections x2 plus 2 rolls. It was perfect for the 2 of us.

4924673,2017-05-26,6,YTCCJ3ShO-zg0dlx1nk6dw,"I've been to 2 Morimoto locations. One was at The Modern in Hawaii (which is now closed) and I went again while I was at the MGM in Las Vegas. I remember enjoying the food and restaurant in general so it made sense that I would be back! 

APPETIZERS:  

My favorites are the Toro Tartare $31 and Whitefish Carpaccio $20. 

Both are great starters. If you like the idea of mixing fresh tuna with different flavors for an incredible taste, you'll want to try the Toro Tartare. The dish itself comes in an iced bowl with 2 small, clear slabs - one has the Toro and the other has a set of 6 condiments which include wasabi, sour cream, caviar, nori paste, chives, guac & bubu arare. There's also a cup of soy sauce if needed. Scrape off a piece from the Toro 'canvas' and with your 'brush', mix it with variety of flavors from the other 'canvas' and enjoy. Very fun and delicious concept. 
 
The Whitefish Carpaccio requires less creativity, but the presentation and taste itself is amazing. Just thinking about the thinly, sliced sashimi with hot oil, ginger, and yuzu sauce makes my mouth water. The fish just melts in your mouth! MUST GET.  

ENTREES: 

Japanese A-5 Wagyu 3oz. $90 

Boyfriend got this. To be real with y'all...3oz is NOT ENOUGH. No wonder wagyu is so expensive, you need to savor every bite - which is what he did. I managed to try a sample and it was good but I can't afford to be paying $90 for meat the size of a deck of playing cards. I was more than happy to split my lobster entrée with him since he was still hungry. 

Whole Roasted Lobster 'epice' $45 

I love lobster, it's one of my favorite seafood dishes. Since I couldn't get my lobster pho at District One, I was definitely going to get lobster at Morimoto's. You can't go wrong with lobster. This dish was everything I wanted! A beautiful lobster -split open with delicious lemon crème fraiche sauce and veggies. The sauce added a nice tanginess to the already seasoned lobster. The veggies on the side made the whole lobster dish very balanced and flavorful. I had to get a side of rice to go along to complete my perfect meal. I was super happy and satisfied.  
 
DESSERT: 

Fiery Chocolate Tart $20 

The star of the night. I got so excited watching the chocolate ball get lit up from the rum that I forgot about getting a picture! (Thank you for screenshots snapchat!) If you're a fan of chocolate, this is a must get dessert. I'm not a chocolate person, but I have to admit this was the perfect mix of light and heavy. I liked the sorbet and marshmallow inside of the ball and the ganache logs on the side were also delicious. You can bet we were on a sugar high for the rest of the night! 

TL;DR 
Definitely try if you have never been to a Morimoto. Great service, food and presentation. Look forward to a very enjoyable dining experience!",29XxHvrJAyvuRaPXu_h-QA,18,16,5,tul6JpckJwx7QQUeWFHw5Q

Chef Morimoto made his debut and transitioned to the American version where he eventually battled Bobby Flay (how dare he stand on his cutting board)!!!

Anyways, I digress. The restaurant that bears his name was an impromptu stop for us in Las Vegas and I am super glad we did. I headed the cries of the yelp verse and we ordered the Tuna Pizza, surf and turf and the spider crab roll. 

Do yourself a dam favor and order the Tuna Pizza. It's a crisp tortilla with thin slices of tuna topped with sliced jalapeno micro greens and drizzled with a spicy creamy sauce. Order this! It had to be hands down the surprise and best dish we ordered while there. I would have ordered more and maybe just this next time. 

The surf and Turf was a wagyu portion cooked topped with potato crumbles and the surf was a hamachi sashimi served with a chili oil. This was also good, although I would have liked the beef to have been cooked or medium rare..... but the person I was with wanted medium and I had to compromise. The hamachi was super delicious!

We dined at Morimoto in Hawaii shortly after it opened (it is now closed) and it was AMAZING, so to say we had high expectations for his Vegas restaurant would be an understatement. The food, the ambiance, the cocktails, and the service completely blew us out of the water. We had reservations last Monday evening, and the food was so delicious that we returned on Thursday. On Monday we sat at a table and ordered cocktails, the shrimp tempura roll and the tempura fried shrimp as appetizers, I had the surf and turf with American wagyu and hamachi, my husband had the lobster, and we shared the chocolate tart sphere for dessert. We could not stop talking about the meal our entire trip, and the tempura shrimp sushi roll stole the show! When we returned later in the week we sat at the sushi bar and I ordered it again (yes, it was so good that I ate it two of our five dinners on our trip!!!). My husband had the chef's selection sushi tasting menu. We had sorbet for dessert. The service is fantastic, and the restaurant is very inviting.

5094757,2016-11-27,19,YTCCJ3ShO-zg0dlx1nk6dw,"Impressive.  Three eateries rolled into one: a sushi bar, modern Japanese, and high end teppanyaki.

Formerly Shibuya at the MGM, this expansive contemporary restaurant is destination worthy.  I'll let the food do the talking.

The Sushi:  The weakest link but if you must...

Very fresh seafood but just top 20 standards you expect.  Sensible slices, flavor and quality as expected.  the  $100 chef's combination sashimi plate, well presented, perfect for sharing.  Sushi itself uses well seasoned, good quality rice, with good compaction.  Slices are appropriate.  Correctly graded otoro, and tender Japanese wagyu.  Don't expect fancy garnishes.  Don't expect too many strange Vegas rolls.  Bottom line, it won't topple the best sushi restaurants.  Save room for Morimoto's creativity.

Modern Morimoto:  Play with your food...

Morimoto sashimi, a seafood napoleon of hamachi, tuna, fatty salmon, oily anago, and seared toro served with eyedroppers of different sauces (squeeze the contents of the eyedroppers in different parts of the plate and smear the towers of goodness through them.  Without giving anything away, experiment.  Sauces bring out different flavors of the fish in the ""stack"".  Brilliant.

The fatty toro tartare is the canvas atop a glass sheet.  Using ""brushes"" choose to apply wasabi, sour cream, caviar, nori paste, chives, guacamole and bubu arare to it and enjoy.  Fresh and fun.

Oyster foie gras is an incredibly delicious, rich bite.  Barely cooked through oysters, melting foie, creamy uni all bathed in a teriyaki sauce thinned by the oyster's natural jus.  Served in shell, one delicious mouth full.

The 10 hour braised kakuni rivals that served in the best Izakayas of Japan.  Meltingly soft, soy flavors throughout, fat well rendered.  Sits atop a bed of creamy rice porridge that is totally unnecessary.

Teppanyaki:  Reservations made...

Service is surprisingly good considering the newness.  Friendly, efficient, but lacking slightly in confidence.

Very good selection of Japanese whisky, sake, shochu.  Typical Vegas resort pricing.

Excellent addition to the MGM offerings.",oeAhRa8yFa9jtrhaHnOyxQ,30,26,4,riaDZtzo69kVHjD4kYNpWA

I ordered oh-toro, red snapper, yellowtail maki, and salmon maki. (I later enjoyed watching a nearby patron order a spicy yellowtail maki and spicy salmon maki - as much as that's my go-to order for sushi, I didn't want any spicy sauce muddling my experience of this level of fresh fish!).

Gotta say, it's not bad, but definitely nothing to be excited about. I've had better sushi else where.

Ordered the oyster foie gras to start. Steamed oysters topped with uni and foie gras. If they can just use a slightly bigger and more briny oysters, maybe it'll be even better. 

Ordered the Chef's choice sushi, the fish are good, rice perfectly seasoned. Unfortunately, what didn't work for me is the portion of the rice. Way too much rice. I've been to countless sushi restaurants around the world, this place might have the most rice. I don't think I've got a small mouth, but seriously, I don't know how girls can eat the sushi in one bite. Maybe some adjustments?

After stuffing myself with all the sushi rice. I decided to ordered some sorbet. Great colours and presentation, but not the best sorbet I had. 

It's just unfortunate that I can only give a 3 star review to an iron chef restaurant. I might be a bit more picky than your average Joe, but I was expecting more than average. We are talking about  Vegas + Iron Chef here.",JGuqX_n1dFrXw2gd9735ow,0,0,3,uhDyeQagvBsFAjvc2IoDvg

5118372,2016-12-25,1,YTCCJ3ShO-zg0dlx1nk6dw,"Save your money, go somewhere else if you are a fan of high-end Jap-asian fusion. 

We had high expectations for this place because Morimoto's name but this may be our fault for thinking it would be worth the money. My wife having lived and worked in and for a Japanese company for many years, has had the chance to experience great traditional and exquisite fusion cuisine form Japan. I also have traveled well around east Asia experiencing the best of local cuisines and flavours the region has to offer. . 

The food was good... Ingredients were all very fresh which is a standard. We were however disappointed with the lack of training and knowledge the servers had of the menu. Two dishes in particular caught our attention and we asked question about them. The Chirashi sushi traditionally is served on a bed of super chilled rice, or for very high end restaurants they serve it as platter with a bowl on the side. We asked the server in this case of it was served as ""Chirashi-don"" which he answered ""no"". This implied that it would have been served on a bed of ice with rice on the side. This was incorrect as it came on a bowl of rice so big which a high end Japanese restaurant should never ever do (fill their customer's up with rice). This seemed like a cheap tactic to offload a lot of unusable sushi/sashimi fish for a high price. It was tasty but because we assumed it would have been served on ice with a side of rice we ordered a bit more food. We ordered the laksa soup with noodles. I've had traditional laksa many many times from the local regions of Asia and I have to say that this dish was nothing like you would have expected. I understand this is supposed to be fusion, but leaving the noodles inside of the thick creamy ""laksa"" boiling hot soup while you serve it just over cooks the noodles into mush. It was terrible... Honestly, I have had better laksa flavoured ramen noodles out of a package. At least shock the noodles to stop them from cooking, and reduce the temperature, allow people to dip the noodles into the overly thickened cream sauce they call laksa and it would taste 100 times better. Also... make it taste like laksa, it literally just tasted like vinegar and butter. For the price tag again not worth it; but it was the comment the server made which really put us off.

""Well it's meant to be fusion cuisine, it's Indian not Japanese.""

At this point we realized that Morimoto didn't hire people who understand food. It was an insult to the dish, the people of Malaysia, and his restaurant to have someone so inexperienced at the tables. 

I've had better Japanese fusion food at izakaya style cafe's all over the world and for literally 1/3rd of the price.",fasna2zZsa8ZGwPreY7-jA,2,1,2,kwQk4_H_UERl7qaEfAskng

The food was just as great as I remembered it. Fresh tasting sashimi and lots of beautiful and unique flavors.

I heard the tuna belly tartare appetizer was a specialty I shouldn't miss and I am so glad I finally tried it. It was out of this world!

The desert had a gorgeous fiery presentation. The waiter took the liberty of splitting our checks without asking him just in case which was thoughtful. 

Overall, I'd say that I don't like returning to the same restaurants because I like trying new things, but Morimoto is a restaurant I will find myself at over and over again for years to come! Better than Nobu! Love, love, love!!",pK-mrc-3v9mMQMI3VWQNpA,0,0,5,ZC7qtY4V3rYJjXZXT0Yv7A

5278896,2017-05-02,6,YTCCJ3ShO-zg0dlx1nk6dw,"Opened in mid-October, a substantial delay and relocation from original plans for The Mirage to MGM Grand's old Shibuya spot now a story of the past, Morimoto Las Vegas has been serving tourists as well as locals for just over six months, the man who helped make televised competition cooking a 'thing' in America finally joining peers including Flay, Batali and Puck with an outpost in the land of Celebrity Chefs.

Seemingly an odd time to come to Sin City, several recent big-ticket openings going belly up or struggling with nearly every Casino now featuring some sort of Big-Box Sushi concept from Mizumi and Nobu to Roku and Zuma, Morimoto occupies a lengthy footprint directly across from Fiamma and Tom Collichio's craftsteak, a striped bust of the man himself greeting guests behind a black podium where reservations are collected, General Manager Jim Bibbee overseeing a room with capacity of over two-hundred.

Designed in a style best described as upscale zen, the Sushi Bar brightly lit while other parts of the restaurant feature an ambient glow arising behind opaque glass or wood, those entering Morimoto during early hours will likely see the lounge and front sections filled with diners looking for small bites before heading off to other forms of entertainment while the back area is reserved for those making Morimoto the evening's main event, a wide range of races and ages all represented and in for a treat from the educated and professional staff.

Using mid-tempo music to help drive the mood, voiceless beats mellowing surrounding conversations but never so loud as to be an annoyance, it was just past 5:30pm when a seat was offered at a small two-top booth along the wall just outside the kitchen, greetings offered from a middle-aged man who was clearly well trained followed by a visit from Mr. Bibbee who was often seen circulating the room to make sure everything was in order.

Not just a sushi-spot, though raw fish is featured across 2/3 of a six-page menu with pricing that at times seems punitive though also offering the occasional deal, it was after a brief discussion that the decision was made to dine plate-by-plate at the kitchen's discretion, a complimentary Sake flight offering an education in Junmai Daiginjo with the Chef's signature-style from Fukumitsuya almost as smooth as water with a velvety finish while the version aged for five years in porcelain took on a Straw color and tasted not so different from Bourbon.

Deciding that a first-visit to the world of Morimoto would be well invested in the Iron Chef's signature plates, a course of Nigiri sent out before Dessert speaking to good quality as relates to fatty fishes and the silky live Octopus, it was with Sake slowly sipped and compared that three West-Coast Oysters topped in Sea Urchin, Duck Liver and sweet Teriyaki was presented on a bed of Salt crystals and Chili threads, the mixture rich and unctuous yet still 'accessible' with each $8 bite the sort of thing that will thrill experienced diners while still offering a good intro to luxury items for the timid.

Always happy to see Fowl on a menu, Chef Morimoto's Duck Duck Goose offered from his earliest days in Philly and standing alongside the Angry Chicken and Tuna Pizza as his most famous East-West Fusion plates, fans of Duck as well as those uninitiated would be well-served to investigate four different presentations offered on one plate, the long-grain fried Rice topped in a Sunny-side Duck Egg fragrant and full of diced Meat while the Meatball is undoubtedly infused with Offal amidst savory broth served clear as a bell, the confit Leg slipping off the Bone with almost no effort while the rosy Breast is barely seared atop Gooseberries.

Firing up the first Teppanyaki table just past seven o'clock, the others soon to follow as two large groups and one family sat before Chefs displaying several cuts of Beef, it was mere moments before the poignant scent of Ginger, Scallions, Garlic and Soy permeated the atmosphere, a dish of sliced Yellowtail cooked in a stone bowl tableside at first mingling well as crisp rice danced with Cilantro and julienned Vegetables but later even itself overwhelmed by the pungent scent poorly cleared by outdated ventilation.

Always overzealous for Dessert, a lowlight of many ""Asian"" restaurants as they focus on more traditional flavors such as Taro, Red Bean, Matcha or Fruit, Masaharu's time in North America has seen the Chef adapt to local palates by way of dishes such as airy Doughnuts with pipettes of Custard and a cone of Whipped Cream made for dipping while both the Tofu Mousse with Black Sesame as well as the fluffy Orange Cheesecake are nicely balanced by fresh Citrus, the $20 Fiery Chocolate Tart immediately drawing eyes from all over the room as the dark sphere is doused in flames revealing a center of Marshmallow, Dark Chocolate Sorbet and Salty Caramel Ganache, though even this decadent dish tinged in booze proved no match to umami-infused air around it.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,14,7,3,XMIbN72wwuPZ4CsEzslK_Q

5353858,2016-12-28,0,YTCCJ3ShO-zg0dlx1nk6dw,"Dinner on a Tuesday, and was able to get an 8:15 reservation at 7:30. I think the crowds come and go here, which is nice, compared to some of the other hot spots in Vegas that seem to always be busy.

We got the surf and turf ($48) and the seafood toban yaki ($42). The surf and turf presentation was beautiful, but it could have been better. Steak was a bit cold. But the seafood toban yaki... so, so good. You get a lobster tail, claw, and another piece, clams, mussels, shrimp, scallop, and an assortment of vegetables. All this to say, they don't skimp for the price. In my opinion, though, you need a side of rice or it gets too salty. It's reminiscent of a cioppino, but with an Asian twist. Would come back for the toban yaki any day. 

Reason for 4 stars is that they definitely need more servers. Either they're slow, or they're in charge of too many tables. Our server came around only once over the course of our meal, and we had to order part of our meal with a busser. Good experience overall!",wlrUx-SXuhj-p-8CBpRbOw,1,0,4,8HGm3RIJDPtK3mTiC7fv6g

The NY location has better decor esp the downstairs chic looking lounge/bar area and their infinity windows in the bathrooms. But when it comes to the sushi part, I believe the Vegas location has fresher and better sushi than the NY location. T

My party shared a sashimi platter and a sushi platter and both were amazing. The tuna tartar and white fish carpaccio was tasty, flavorful, and good for sharing. Thumbs up to the sushi chefs there.

Oyster foie gras, my favorite Morimoto dish!!!! Its even better than the toro tartare which is Theeee dish here. 
Black cod, pretty standard japanese dish.

The fauncy chocolate dessert is worth getting for the Gram. They pour over some fire to melt the chocolate ball and there is something inside, get your cameras out for vids. However, it tasted so-so.

For the price tag, its better than Nobu (excluding the omakase, never had it at either place).",QTXeJ0TmEoeb2nRUemWpZA,3,3,5,CwypNh8vsP19MVmbf81fLg

I took a minute to peruse the menu and decided to begin my evening with their Sake Flight. It consisted of four different selections that ranged from light and floral to dark and smokey. My favorite was aged like a whiskey and was a fantastic sipper.

I chose the $50.00 Sushi Sampler, which includes a Spicy Tuna Roll and ten different pieces of Sushi. Everything was impeccably fresh and beautifully presented. The only piece I didn't like was the Mackerel. It was just too fishy for me. In the future, I would probably skip the sampler and just order the Sushi individually. I might spend a little more, but I'd get exactly what I like.

I had originally planned to try something off the Dinner Menu, but since it was my last night in Vegas and assurances from my server that it wasn't ""too heavy"", I decided to try the Fiery, Salty Caramel Chocolate Tart. It was definitely worth the splurge. The combination of flavors and textures matched the flamboyant presentation.

He is one of my favorite Iron chefs and I still remember getting to dine at Nobu in New York City and he was the head chef at that time. The sushi was out of this world as were the hot plates.
This is why I gave this restaurant four stars and not five. It was good, but it missed the greatness that this incredible iron chef is known for. We started by ordering the Wagyu beef carpaccio as an appetizer and it was delicious. We also ordered the Himezen sake, a mildly sweet sake, that was really good. We went on to sushi where we ordered the yellowtail and scallion roll, the Toro and scallion roll, and the shrimp tempura roll. I did ask that any spicy sauce be kept off of the shrimp tempura roll. The shrimp tempura roll was yummy but it was not phenomenal like other places on the strip and off the strip where I have had it at. The yellowtail scallion roll was delicious but I still have had better on the strip. The Toro and scallion roll was on the smaller side but incredibly good. For entrées, we ordered the black cod which was absolutely delicious and melted in your mouth. We also ordered the yellowtail with rice Korean like dish that comes in a very hot pot and it was good, but I was not blown away by it. We found the rice to be quite bland. For dessert, we shared a mango and coconut dessert that came with the mango mousse and coconut mousse with a green tea ice cream on top and was very good.
The price for all of this was very reasonable and we were impressed by the fact that the prices were not exorbitant. They were not cheap but they were also reasonable. The restaurant itself is beautiful, open and modern, and the service is very friendly.
I have had better sushi at other places, which surprises me. The hot plates had one major winner and one that was just OK. 
As locals, we talked about the fact the parking for 2 1/2 hours of dining cost seven dollars, which for Las Vegas, is new and a lot. We questioned if it is worth paying this money again to come eat at this restaurant, and we all agreed that the answer was no, because there are places that are phenomenal on and off the strip that are equally, if not way better, with free parking.
Overall though, the food here was very good.",leY7FqJ3NKPzpM5awAQ2-Q,1,0,4,hiqT2uTzDa5vEeFCPNJ04w

Now with that said this place can be busy, cause magic. Plan ahead if you have a group.  Or go as a small group and try seating in the bar area. I went to a late dinner with a friend and was immediately seated at the bar area. All the staff were very friendly and knowledgeable.  So much so it can be a little overwhelming. To maximise our experience we got a couple starters and just did a large chef selection.  

Did the spicy tuna tacos. They definitely have some spice and kick. Just enough to feel a little pain but not enough to detract from the flavour.  You only get 3. Share accordingly haha

Now the chef selection came with a lot of pieces. We even had them include shrimp tempura as one of the rolls. One thing I would say that makes this place magical is the flavour.  I feel they really mastered it and layered it with the proteins. Part of this is having food not straight from a fridge/freezer but at just chill to room temperature.  This can throw you off if you're not experienced but it adds so much to it. Never been anywhere else sushi wise that did this. I feel this is something very traditional that we have just missed as sushi has become Westernised.

5601673,2018-04-30,9,YTCCJ3ShO-zg0dlx1nk6dw,"My previous review of Morimoto was with the No1DP who appreciates Iron Chef Morimoto due to the fusion elements of his cuisine. Turns out that my family went to eat there without me NYE 2017 and enjoyed it so much that everyone wanted to go back there on the next visit. Because I was able to go back my two reviews can focus on two of the core aspects of the restaurant. While my first review focuses on the fusion elements of the restaurant, this review focuses on the social/group dining element of the restaurant as literally almost every dish can serve as a small plates item.

According to our waiter Nicole, Morimoto can be best experienced three different ways: small plates due to their emphasis on hot and cold appetizers, sushi/sashimi due to their separate menu and entrees that focus on the fusion elements, but with an added steak option for a little example of Vegas decadence. We could've done the omakase option for significantly cheaper but we liked having the independence of ordering whatever dishes we wanted. Through the suggestions of our waiter we were able to partake in all the plates fairly.

DRINK: Thai Basil Smash (Hendricks gin, St. germain, pineapple, Thai basil, hibiscus, $17). A sweet cocktail that hides the taste of gin. Could taste the pineapple but not the basil.

TRUE APPETIZERS
Cold
- Tuna pizza (anchovy aioli, olives, jalapeno, $23)
- Yellowtail 'pastrami' (togarashi, gin creme fraiche, candied olive, morimoto grapeseed oil, $24)
The emphasis here is the quality of the fish. Instead of ordering sushi/sashimi as a pure fish it's incorporated into the fusion cuisine as an appetizer. The tuna pizza works great because the aioli, normally strong, doesn't overpower the fish. Same thing with the yellowtail and the togarashi/creme fraiche. Only thing bad here was the candied olive, it was too tough.

Hot
- Kakuni x2 (10 hour pork belly, rice congee, soy-scallion jus, $21)
- Rock shrimp tempura (spicy kochujan sauce, wasabi aioli, $23)
These are more filling than the cold appetizers. Pork belly is very savory and filling on its own, hence best separated into small parts. Congee helps the digestion of such a rich meat. Tempura is good but only if your party appreciates wasabi and Korean pepper paste, which are very dominating and spicy parts of any food. Luckily for my parents it is made mild, but I would've appreciated something stronger.

ENTREES AS SHARED PLATES
- Whole roasted lobster (garam masala, lemon creme fraiche, $56). Garam masala worked here in addition to the vegetables. Wish that the creme fraiche came earlier as it would complement the garam masala as it's a strong flavor in itself.
- Crispy whole fish (spicy tofu sauce, papaya salad, $43). With the help of Nicole she split the fish to make it easier to eat. Luckily there were not a lot of bones and the fish was soft and flaky. Tofu sauce was not spicy.
- Japanese A-5 Wagyu ($35/oz, 3oz minimum). What's notable about this dish is that the wagyu can be ordered three ways: as a NY Strip cut, ribeye cut or filet cut. We got the ribeye cut. Like a high-quality otoro, the meat literally dissolves in your mouth as you eat it due to the high marble. I have not experienced this in any other wagyu even in Japan, hence this is my gold standard for wagyu.
- Ishi yaki buri bop (yellowtail on rice cooked tableside in hot stone bowl, $38). If you've eaten at plenty of Asian restaurants you'll realize that this is a literal description of the dish - fatty yellowtail (buri) bibim(bap) served ishiyaki/dolsot style. If you've read my reviews I love buri and dolsot bibimbap so right away I fell for this dish. This is also appropriate for a closing dish due to the carb. Fried egg not necessary.
- Chinese broccoli ($10). Tough and a bit plain but necessary between strong umami flavors from each of the mains.

DESSERT
- Tutti fruiti toro (guava pineapple gelee, tropical fruit sorbets, $16). Identical to their famous appetizer toro tartare with the gelee as counterpart to toro. It is also eaten identically to the appetizer, with the combination of gelee + sorbet much better together than the sum of its parts. 
- Chilled cheesecake souffle (blood orange meringue, strawberry-red wine sorbet, $16). The souffle was too small for five people. The citrus meringue worked here with the fluffy cheesecake.

Even by Vegas standards, Morimoto is certainly not a cheap meal. My contribution including tax and tip came to about almost $200/person. Ever since all of my parents' kids started working our choices for fine dining expanded; my family loves the wagyu so much they will pay the money to eat the wagyu here as they can't fly to Japan as often as I do. I will go back here because their execution of fusion cuisine is one of the best I've seen. Japanese fusion with emphasis on quality of ingredients.",7gNtYzygF7dB8e7k1mWdjA,11,11,5,alKmhmoGTu9OBVr_3rXxBg

All picture quality. Table next to us did a 6 course fixed mela for $140 and while it was expensive their dining experience looked exquisite. Edamame was $14 - really expensive but very fresh tasting. Made mistake by asking for a spice sauce on second order and it tasted horrible but we didn't return it since we asked for it. Presentation of sashimi dinner. Salad and ribs were all picture worthy. Wasn't impressed with service at all. We poured our own champagne most of the night and even thought the bottle was empty even thou not turned over because every waiter just ignored refilling our glasses. Waiter didn't entertain much flexibility. First answers were no substitutes or ""no"". Asked to plug in cell phone - waiter said they'd go ask but never game back with an answer.

Beautiful layout, high ceiling, a lounge and bar when we first walk in, then a long sushi bar and another dining room in the back perfect for private event. The Beef display case, the see-through glass wine cellar, the 3-D status of chef Morimoto, the nice wooden table, and the gigantic photo arts work behind the sushi bar from floor to ceiling, impressive!  

We opted in for the sushi bar where we can watch all the actions. 

The food was fantastic. A few dishes you must try:

- Fish carpaccio or anything carpaccio here
- Seared Wagyu
- King Crab
- Tuna Tartare, just the presentation alone , made me salivating 
- Morimoto Sashimi, fascinating dish 
- That pork belly 
- Hamachi rice stone hot pot 
- and anything sashimi + sushi, Toro, Uni, and everything was fresh and delightful.

Save time for the desserts, because it's fantastic here.

Don't forget to try their amazing Sake list, a nice break from all the wines tasting we indulge.

Every single dish was on point, delicious, and well timing. Our server was good and attentive.

We got to meet the Mr. Silver Fox GM, what a charmer he is! Thank you for the warm hospitality. 

Morimoto is consistent, fresh, delicious and always exceed our expectations. 1 of my favorite Michelin Star places in the Bay Area and Napa Valley, now to Vegas location, quite impressive here too.

You don't find that many sushi/Japanese cuisine that can execute this well, so this is a must visit when you are in Vegas and craving for fresh fish. 

It's pricey but it's Las Vegas. If you can't afford it, then don't come here and complain. In life, you get what you pay for.

Aside from mediocre overpriced food, what ruined the experience was MGM, walking through the stinking smoky casino trying to find the restaurant buried in MGM's food court.

What really set me off was the fact that after being dropped off at the front MGM door by my Uber, MGM makes you walk 20 minutes into some dark hole of a garage in the back of the building if you want to catch an UBER to leave. My opinion on why they do this is some arrangement (kickback) and to support Vegas cabs who of course hate Uber. So MGM, here is what I say to you, GFY! I will never go to your hotel of food court again when I am in Vegas. 

Morimoto, you chose to sign a lease in an MGM property that treats their customers in this manner. Plus your sushi items are wildly overpriced for the quality which is definitely nothing to write home about. Your name is on this place, people expect a far higher quality of food, and frankly I feel ripped off.

So many better *values* available in Vegas eateries, sorry I took a chance on what seemed to be a high review rating, big mistake.",NiXxK26qXpJy_kS0ZvNCOw,2,0,1,iyqsmWTNxPuNWfeyMYQNPg

Overall I loved the hot appetizers and entrees and like the sushi and desserts. 
For appetizers my wife and I ordered:
Oyster foie Gras - the combination of oysters, door gras and uni was amazing. After I had the first piece I was thinking I need to order few more of these.
Laksa noodle soup - it's such a comforting dish. The egg was so flavorful, the curry soup was well balanced, wonderful curry flavor with a little kick to it but not too spicy. 
Pork belly with congee: the piece of pork was so tender.
Entrees:
Braised black cod: the piece of fish was so perfectly cooked that my chop sticks just slid into the fish without any effort on my part. The cod was so moist and the ginger-soy reduction was spot on.
Seafood pot: this dish was a little spicy but that's what made this dish great, spicy but not overpoweringly hot, the lobster broth made all the seafood in the pot tasted better.
We also order few pieces of nigiri, they were good but my favorite sushi restaurant in Las Vegas offer cheaper but better sushi. I won't order them next time.
For dessert we ordered the chocolate tarte and soufflé they tasted fine and looked beautiful but just not amazing. Good not great.
For the next few days after our dinner at morimot; my wife and I kept talking about our experience and planning our next visit. It was that good. One of the must try in Las Vegas.",lW9B0GUMNjjdmo7JU3vRWg,0,0,5,d3E4cSdpvj_90oStWyt1kQ

5721229,2018-05-16,0,YTCCJ3ShO-zg0dlx1nk6dw,"This is our third visit to Morimoto. We were so happy with the dinners we'd eaten there previously. What happened to your restaurant, Morimoto-san? When we made our reservation (well in advance) the host asked if we were celebrating a special occasion. Yes! When a fine dining restaurant asks about a special occasion, that means that it is acknowledged in some way - complimentary drinks, a dessert, sometimes even a small gift. We chose a restaurant like Morimoto for a special occasion just for this reason. Guess what we got? Bupkis. The host said ""Happy Birthday"" as we checked in and that was it. No other acknowledgement or special service. Our advance reservation awarded us a table just a few feet away from the restroom entrance. We had a floor show all evening of people using the facilities, including one green-faced young woman running to the bathroom with her hand clapped over her mouth - sushi novice? We'll never know. 
The food was a mixed bag. We started off with wonderful appetizers - the tuna pizza and the Omakase tuna tartare were both delicious. It went downhill from there, with overcooked lobster, less than fresh sushi, and worst off all, a dried up, large lump of fake wasabi that wasn't even blended properly. If they had given us the tiniest amount of freshly ground wasabi, what a difference that would have made! This faux wasabi lump was an insult to the meal and to us. 
Our server was personable enough, but there was minimal service throughout the meal, definitely not what you'd expect from a $$$ restaurant. Our server did one check-back after the appetizers were served, and then he chatted us up a bit before bringing the check. Since there were no warm towels offered, we had to use our own hand wipes, and the wrappers were never cleared from the table. Once of the servers spilled a little tea on the table - that was never wiped up. So many details that make a huge difference in the dining experience.",fkRsTj79a6APcRHhqyiktw,0,0,2,SAkE_FMgjqdCY0A-7S_Abg
5732102,2018-01-08,6,YTCCJ3ShO-zg0dlx1nk6dw,"You can easily make a reservation through the OpenTable app! I recommend making a reservations because they can be full during certain nights. The app says the dress code is business casual, but looking around us as we ate, you could away with dressing a little more casual. Located at the MGM Grand hotel, it's hard to miss this restaurant because of all the beautiful lights surrounding it!

To start, I had the koshihikari echigo beer ($15), one of my favorite Japanese beers and I'm so glad they had it here! My sister had the mango matcha punch ($17) and it was very delicious! The alcohol was subtle and it had a strong fruit/tea taste. She said it was easily the best cocktail that she's ever had!

For our appetizers/entrees-

-Sticky ribs : Each order comes with 3 pieces, we added 2 extra pieces since there were 5 of us, so the total became $37. We were not expecting it to, but these ribs slid right off the bone and melted into our mouths. Absolutely amazing, I definitely recommend this dish!

-Kakuni ($22) : Pork belly over congee! It was sweet, savory, and overall a pleasant dish! I've never had a dish like this anywhere else and while it's not really a dish that's easy to share with a lot of people, I would recommend this dish because of the flavor and how tender the pork belly is.

-Ishi yaki chashu bop ($39) : Chashu (pork) over rice in a hot stone bowl. They mix it for you when they bring it to the table and mix in a sesame soy sauce. Very yummy and flavorful!

-Ishi yaki buri bop ($38) : Hamachi (yellowtail fish) over rice in a hot stone bowl. They also mix this for you at your table and in my opinion, better than the chashu bop if you like fish! The hamachi was perfectly cooked!

-Duck duck goose ($42) : A mix of duck confit fried rice, duck, and goose. Great if you like the duck & goose meat. If you're getting this for the fried rice, then I'd suggest you go with the duck confit rice side dish ($13). It also has an egg on it, has excellent flavor, and is pretty much the same size! 

-Sushi combination ($55) : Chef's choice of assorted nigiri! It came with 10 pieces of nigiri and a 6 piece tuna roll. I wish their fish was more fresh, but sadly it didn't wow me. Very typical, standard fish. The rice kept falling apart, so it was hard to pick up. For $55, the portion was not bad, but I was a little disappointed. Not comparable to the omakase in Japan or even San Francisco. 

For dessert, we tried the tofu mousse ($15) and the cheesecake soufflé ($16). Both were delicious, I definitely liked the cheesecake soufflé more!

Overall, I think that the kitchen food was much better than the sushi. I would recommend coming here and ordering those dishes!! Yes, it is more pricey here, but you're in Vegas, and the high price tag also comes with the service and it's also because of the Morimoto name. The service was excellent, our server Berto had great orecommendations & was friendly! Many people were there to take away our empty plates & refill our waters.

One other negative was the waiter asked if anyone had food allergies - one of our party is lactose intolerant - he acknowledged it and brought out cream cheese with the fish spam - and set it in front of the guy - hmmmm.

I must be honest with you from the onset, you are reading a review of a sushi resteraunt from someone who doesn't eat sushi.....ussually. 

First things first, make a reservation and if you're feeling frisky sit at the tepa bar because there is a different menu then the resteraunt. 

SECOND, ORDER THE APPETIZER RIBS....youre welcome. Dont waste your time on the gyoza, we didnt finish them, they seem to have so much ginger to mask some other flavor that is very unappetizing. 

Third, get yourself the sake' flight. We didnt have reservations and sat at the bar.  The tender, JJ, was amazing.  She reccomeded this flight and knowing nothing about sake' i was happy to accept the reccomendation.  I didnt realize how much i loved sake'! 

It was truly a blessing to have her lead us in our culinary trip.  She spoke so highly of Chef Morimoto, let us know he was a really awesome boss and explained his love for sake' and background which made me want to love eating here. And boy did I. 

From there we had the tempura shrimp rolls (I know not real sushi).  I have been craving these since the day we left! Something about the crunchy shrimp center mixed with the perfect texture of the rice had my taste buds craving more.  I think it was may favorite menu item.  Things were going so well we stepped out of our box and tried the spicy salmon rolls; phenominal.  Not a hint of fishyness or that weird weedy flavor you get with cheap roll.  

We followed up by sharing the bop fried rice which is made tableside in a 400 degree bowl.  The chef arrived at out table and explained the process while cracking the farm fresh egg mixing it with in house milled rice, and  of course the secret soy sauce recipe. We opted for the kobe beef, but it is quite pricey. All waitstaff say the chicken or fish is also very good.  It is quite a dramatic presentation and well worth the attention. 

We ended the meal with the salted carmel chocolate marshmello ball which is lit on fire utilizing 151 alcohol.  As we watched the chocolate ball melt into the marshmello goodness we knew we made the perfect choice to end our meal.  Our meal ended as dramatically as it started.  

The theme here is presentation and Chef Morimoto is nothing short of perfect.  The only thing i didnt like about my meal is that it was over,  and the gyoza, but given the perfection of the rest of our culinary experience i would still say Chef Morimoto hit a home run with this Vegas culinary experience.",UINeEDzOcOgagPNvP40Daw,1,2,5,G4LpNWwt9OqZNA8DszJy5Q

We decided to try the toro tartare and the 20 Pcs of Omakase. I can't tell you how disappointed I am at the quality of the sushi. It came with a shrimp tempura roll, a salmon roll and 2 pieces of Yellow Tail, Mackerel, Eel, salmon, shrimp and chu toro. They all came at once! The quality of the fish was subpar. We were told the quality of the fish is different if you are to order individual sushi which in my opinion is bad way to do business. The seaweed on the roll was extremely chewy and so was the shrimp tempura. The rice on the roll was hard as if it was pre made and was sitting on the counter. Honestly I can't remember the last time I had bad sushi like this. You can get better sushi at the strip mall sushi spot. 

The Toro tartar was overrated. Nothing special and way overpriced. 

Overall we are very disappointed at this restaurant. I had high hopes from a well known TV Chef and all the hyped up reviews.

A great dining experience is usually a combination of ambience, service, and food. Morimoto failed badly at service and food. Our waiter was a twitchy kid with ADHD who brought out Char Siu Bop instead of the Pork Char Siu salad we ordered. For my pork chop, he brought out a knife and lectured me to be careful because it's sharp.  Look kid, I'm a doctor.  I'm okay wielding sharp metal instruments.  No need for the patronizing shit. Whoever is running the front of the restaurant needs to retrain the waitstaff.  Way too intrusive and patronizing.  I came to eat, not to be lectured.

In all the years of dining, I've only ever sent back two dishes, ever.  Congrats on being one of them Morimoto. The pork chop was Dead Sea salty.  Inedible. Next up was the black cod with ginger soy reduction.  The cod was overwhelmed with sugar and I cannot taste any ginger or soy.  Not a very well balanced dish. This really should be a $12 thing at Applebee's and not a $38 dish.  

Prior to the evening at Morimoto we had dine at Kabuto.  The contrast between the two establishments could not be more stark.  These celebrity chef restaurants rest too much on the name of the chef.

We actually didn't eat it because it was too rubbery. That was a huge let down since my family and I love wagyu. The NY strip was definitely more tender and better cooked.

The Sushi was not different from what Origami my favorite place sells for half the price. The entrees were tasty. Our server was weird. Kept looking at my friend while asking questions. These are the small nuances that makes one lose their appetite.

Our waitress was amazing and had excellent recommendations and answered every question that we had with ease. We started with the Toro Tartare and sushi rolls which were HEAVEN. The presentation alone makes it an incredible experience. My entree was the angry chicken and that was incredible as well. With the chicken I will warn that it was riddled with bones, and a little hard to maneuver when your buzzed on delicious champagne, but so worth it. It was my birthday and  they brought out an adorable serving of wasabi raspberry sorbet which was delicious as well!! Since I can't have dairy I couldn't try all the wonderful looking desserts, but everyone at the tables around us looked like they thoroughly enjoyed theirs.

Came here and tried their omakase (6 course meal) and it was pretty worth it if you haven't tried it yet. Also had the tuna pizza as an appetizer, which was both delicious and worth it. The Morimoto-style chirashi bowl was also very good and worth it for the price. Would honestly stick to that after having tried their omakase for the first time. Honestly, the surf and turf was the only thing that was majorly disappointing (the steak wasn't that great).

Making the reservation was a breeze, we choose the ""surprise me"" option and the waiter chose or dishes for us based on our budget- and there is not a single thing I didn't absolutely love! Here's what we had from what I remember:
Some kind of whitefish tacos- BOMB. Marinated fish, simply dressed with perfectly crunchy shells.
Sea Bass Salad- the sea bass what marinated in a ginger soy sauce and surrounded a greens salad with a lemon-line vinaigrette. A+
Sushi/Sashimi- too many to name! We told him we wanted ~40% sushi, and he definitely delivered. All the nigiri had a bit of wasabi between the gosh and rice, so watch out for that.
Marinated Cod- literally fell apart. So good.
I can't recommend this place enough. And Prince our waiter did a fantastic job, ask for him when you go!",tehmsGPpV6vOfbhMtC6Iag,0,0,5,hdxxqf3w1Y2nyBE8kZgjMw

A great place to celebrate a special occasion or to create a good first impression. I am not fussed over celebrity chefs in town because they seem a dime a dozen but this is one of the better ones in town. 

Although expensive, we left feeling completely satisfied with everything that was brought out to us. We thought the tuna pizza and tuna tacos were going to be the same tasting dish but they had 2 different flavor combinations which was surprising. Sake selection is delicious. Sashimi platter was fresh and the beautiful work of the chefs really shines through. Highly recommend ordering dessert even if you don't like sweets. The cheesecake was light, not overly sweet and the sorbet had bold flavors one note leaving the next.

I had to order individual sushi since they don't have omakase.
Mizudaiko
Uni
Anago
Oh Toro
Hotate and 
Mentaiko
The mentaiko is sooooo salty that I had to give up.
I wonder what kind of soy sauce they are using. It's far far too salty.

Cod was pretty good. 

Sushi was pretty good.
