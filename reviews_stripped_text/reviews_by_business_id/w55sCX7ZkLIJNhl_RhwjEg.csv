First off when you walk in to the restaurant the only lights they have are red lights and then rest was black. I've never been to a Mexican restaurant that make their customers pay for chips and salsa, and then they have the nerve to charge you 7$, the margaritas are over priced and not worth it AT ALL! They charge 2.50 for everything, an the worst part about this place... I brought the rest of my Taquitos  home when I went to eat one there was a long blond hair INSIDE!! Save your money and go somewhere else but not this place totally not worth it.",3IAiislsO9IusQk9J5JD9A,0,1,1,AJ4IM56faRINC0nMT6FJPQ

Cute place in a little shopping center.  We were working at an event nearby and decided to stop during happy hour. 

Two for 1 drinks! Yes please, margaritas were fantastic! 
I got the 3 tacos - 1 chicken, 1 beef and 1 shrimp the first day, the chicken was a bit bland, beef was ok.. BUT the Shrimp was to die for! succulent, perfectly cooked and flavored shrimp, the chipotle sauce that topped it was amazing. 
Needless to say, day 2, I ordered the tacos again, but ALL Shrimp.  Couldn't have been better",nkjhGHl2kbRPk75Yx-DyeA,1,0,4,NEXQ_N9idv4D2yTmHn_ZUQ

My wife and I have given this place 3 tries, and each visit is more disappointing than the last.  PLEASE get rid of your attitude-charged wait staff!!  They are DESTROYING (and drinking) your business.  My wife and I have hotel and food/beverage careers, and have never encountered service in all of Las Vegas as bad this place.  When one ponders why the waitress is such a jerk, and then you see her pounding shots with friends, the pieces come together...

The hostess is the only thing this place has going for it, she's sweet and often does half the work of the wait staff.

I have been frequenting this place for years and really enjoy their happy hour specials. They typically offer 2-for-1 on any adult beverage from 4-8, which can't be beat.

The Mexican food is rather poor in my opinion, but I try to order their chicken wings at every occasion I can get. They don't use your typical Buffalo sauce or BBQ sauce, the wings have a house recipe sauce that provides a sweet heat that causes me to keep coming back for more. Even the average consumer will enjoy their wings. I have family and friends who come to Vegas to visit and they ask me to take them to Cantina as soon as they land at the airport. With a college bar feeling inside you will see a wide variety of patrons from the occasional suit and tie to a spring breaker in a bikini (Hard Rock pool is across the street).

When we politely questioned the cup size on the first round the bartender, Alan called my girlfriend a liar and said he would do nothing about it.  This is the same guy who earlier switched the game we were watching and then had to be convinced to change it back.   Finally Sean handled it and took the drinks off the bill.  Alan also told a buddy customer  that it was OK to smoke  in the dining area where we were eating when it is clearly marked ""No fumar!""

It comes with chips and green salsa on the side.  Those are A-OK.

There is a huge outdoor patio that offers a view of the strip in the distance and a big room inside. 

Stopped in here on Cinco de Mayo after driving by many times and seeing it kind of busy, but of course on this day it was packed and even featured a mariachi band playing outside! Ariba! 

Ordered the El Dorado margarita, which at $16 was a bit pricey if you ask me.  That's like something you'd pay for on the strip.  Also ordered the 3 taco entree plate, one chicken and one steak, which was A-Ok, nothing special.  The food is VERY american-ized Mexican food.  The rice and beans it came with were kinda disappointing.   All in all the food was... ehhh decent but nothing special.

612488,2015-02-23,1,w55sCX7ZkLIJNhl_RhwjEg,"Customer service is key. A group of 4-6 of us usually go to Paradise for happy hour once every week or two. Last night, we brought at least 25 people for a birthday party. Two of us started out before happy hour drinking Dos Equis 12 oz bottles for $6. When happy hour started, we wanted to switch to 36oz draft Dos Equis draft for $7 which is their special. They were out of draft and wouldn't give us the same price. 

I tried to explain to the waitress (who was clearly unhappy to be there) that I shouldn't be charged the same price for one third of a drink that was only one dollar less. If it is something on their menu that they are able to provide, they should. She disagreed. I received our bill which for two people, was $87. I again tried to plead with the manager/bartender explaining this was ridiculous. We were with a big group, spent a lot of money, come weekly, and it was the right thing to do since it was their fault they were out of a special on a Saturday night. He disagreed.

They only have green chile salsa which was not hot at all so I had to add some Tapatio sauce to spice things up.  The burrito comes with a basket of chips which help fill you up.

Overall, this is a good spot to hit up when you are hungry.  For me, staying at the Hard Rock Hotel made this an easy place to get to as it's just across the street from the hotel.

The food is quite good, and pretty good portions.  I am particularly fond of their buffalo wings.  As others have mentioned, the 2 for 1 happy hour from 4-8 is a nice bonus.  They have other food and drink specials that vary from day to day.

the waitress didnt listen to our orders. we told her ""no cheese"" for my boyfriend. but every dish he ordered came with cheese!  there was cheese sprinkled on his rice. she was like ""i can give you more rice if you want."" what part of ""no cheese"" did she not understand?

1832846,2013-02-19,0,w55sCX7ZkLIJNhl_RhwjEg,"Paradise Cantina isn't too bad for Las Vegas Mexican food and that's coming from someone who frequents taquerias in San Francisco. I will for sure tell you that Paradise Cantina is much better than Pink Taco (and less expensive). This past January, I found myself at Paradise Cantina two or three times as I made my way to the Hard Rock Hotel & Casino. The patio seating attracted me to check out the menu and my friend and I decided to get a bite to eat.

The menu has all your usual basics including starters, soups and salads, entrees, and dessert offerings. On my first visit, I went simple and got their Cantina Tacos, which included three tacos with your choice of meat, and onions, cilantro, and salsa. For $2 more, you could make it a dinner plate and add rice and beans and tortilla chips. The dinner plate came to a little less than $10. 

The food didn't take too long to come out, maybe 10 minutes or so and it all came out together, including the chips. I was surprised at the portion size of the rice and beams, as it was a whole other plate on its own. The tacos were your typical size and the carne asada was topped off with onions, cilantro, and salsa. The meat was tender and had plenty of flavor, yet I always add tons of salsa to my tacos. The green salsa in particular was my favorite and asked for seconds or thirds. The rice and beans were more than filling and weren't bland nor was the rice overcooked. All in all it was a great lunch for less than $10.

My other two experiences at Paradise varied, as one night we were treated great by the bartender. We stopped by for happy hour and an appetizer or two. On our third and last visit, the waitress was without question rude from the beginning to the very end. The waitress was always short with us and had no conception of what customer service is supposed to be. Nevertheless, we paid our bill, gave a small tip and made our way back to our hotel. Although our last visit to Paradise was less than stellar, I'll more than likely revisit if I'm in the area. I would however avoid the 4am dinner shift.

So, during my whirlwind Friday night in Sin City this weekend, you can bet I made the most of those 21 hours! And when my local friend and I were on hour 7 of drinking and at least one of us (it was clearly me) had made it all the way through an amazing Foo Fighters show at the Joint, it was time to find a bar because, well,  you always need more drinks! 

Now, if you read my reviews, you can probably guess that I am much more of a bar type gal rather than a lounge lizard. And Vegas dance clubs get old real quick, so with only those 21 precious hours and months of stuff to catch up on with my friend, we wandered out of the Hard Rock in a quest for a sweet-ass bar, within walking distance of course. My friend knew about a hoffbrau across the street but it was closing so we just happened to wander into this strip mall instead and the word cantina was all we needed to make our way inside. 

Standard crazy mexican bar decor greeted us on the inside along with 2 great bartender brothers who, in true Vegas transplant fashion were from Ohio. Those boys kept us entertained and kept the delicious drinks flowing. Sean even let me play dj with his ipod after already playing every song I requested - even better than the best jukebox if you ask me! My friend ordered a bowl of tortilla soup at one point and that was delicious as well. Even a regular at the bar who just so happened to be from our home town here in Cali (but many years older than us) was there... so surreal he could have been planted there just to add familiarity! Soon, our one drink to tide us over until we figured out where else to go became about 8 drinks and 3 1/2 hours so Paradise Cantina will definitely hold a fond place in my liver and I will surely be back for chill, fun, but still very very drunken nights in Vegas!",-vdo-XDggc2QNmdqRA9YOA,0,0,5,d_Okg30Q0EDip_ILyW1LQw

The bar has a great happy hour from 4-7, as well as a few daily specials. Tuesdays until 10 pm offer $2 bottled domestic beer, $1.50 tacos, as well as cheap margaritas and mojitos. I believe there are also specials on Monday nights when they offer karaoke. The one thing I will say, is that they don't offer any draft beers, something I look forward to when going to a bar. 

Although it is a bar, there is no smoking in the actual establishment which is always a con in my opinion. But, for the smokers, Paradise Cantina has a decent sized patio, which is great on the rare occasions ha there is nice weather in Las Vegas. 

I usually go on a Tuesday or Wednesday night, so it's never very busy. Service has always been great. Waitresses are friendly, and drinks come out quickly. I've only had the nachos to eat, but they are delicious.

Salsa had great flavor and came with guacamole. I was a little perturbed that they actually charged for chips and salsa - they must not have gotten the memo that these sorts of things are generally free when you dine-in.

I was told it was happy hour so all alcohol was but one get one free and they had a bunch of margaritas. So I thought oh wow the coconut one sounds creamy and good. She brought me two margaritas on the rocks at the same time. So apparently you can't drink one and order another. Which means if you are slow like me the other one is watered down. I didn't even touch the other one. Heck I couldn't even drink half of the first one. The margaritas were not creamy or even good. But had a fake coconut after taste. 

I ordered the queso fries nacho style, which was a huge portion of steak fries with some cheese melted on top and some whole pinto beans a scoop of sour cream and guacamole. They were super dry, I wouldn't order again. Also ordered the Taquitos. My server asked if I wanted steak (not beef) or chicken. I chose steak. What I got was ground beef shoved into flour tortillas and deep fried. They were on top of a bunch of romaine lettuce and had a side of sour cream and guacamole. I would not order these again either. 

The server walked past me several times. Finally I had to ask for the check. She asked if I wanted to go boxes since over half of everything was there and to go cup for my margarita. I said no because I won't be eating it later.

They have margarita specials, and a good variety to choose from. However, these ""specials"" are still pretty costly. A normal sized margarita ended up being around $12 (+/- $2, can't really remember). They're served in a plastic cup, which just makes this place even more tacky.

We ordered a margarita (happy hourse buy one get one single shot, great deal one may think) well, the guy who started the order was good. 
He did the two shots and started pouring the drinks in 2 glasses when this other spike haired dude, who acted like he owned the bar (? manager maybe?) asked him if he had a glass left in the blender....

I was like wtf? There wasnt a full glass left for spike hairs customer order so he just took the 2 drinks already pourded (remind you, 2!! shots for 2 glasses as in single shot order for 2) and put it in another mixer, added tons of ice and did 3!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! drinks with 2 shots we ordered and charged us the full price and the other customer.

My bf didnt say anything, since it was buy one get one. BUT if this happens once it is more common I would think.

I ordered the Fajita sandwich and I was pleasantly surprised. It's basically a burrito (chicken fajita, sour cream, lettuce, tomato, avocado) in a fluffy torta. Actually, it's a TORTA! For lunch, it was perfecto. The servings are pretty large, enough for two people to share. Everyone else said their food was also good. I think my bf got a regular burrito--he loved it and his cousin got a flauta-eggroll like thing--she also liked it! 

Drinks...the margaritas were also large and strong. I left feeling buzzed even after all that food. I don't remember how much everything was, but it was definitely reasonable for the amount of food and alcohol we got.  

The service was spot on. Our waitress (she wore a flower in her hair) was very attentive, helpful and friendly.  Overall, I'd recommend this place for anyone looking for a nice, quiet, and inexpensive lunch place.",CmTVdmFYvRL4thDwn0INgw,2,3,5,2AKFgwEugi91pcbyim1JLA

So even though my homie Tony picked up the tab, I'm surprised still at how painfully average I found the food to be. Now usually I find free food to always taste a bit better than when I have to pay,  So I couldn't imagine being happy if I had actually bought the food. We tried a couple things but nothing was particularly impressive. The rolled tacos were pretty dry, they kind of reminded me of the taquitos you get in the freezers at Costco. The guac? Go to chipotle, the boneless wings were chewy and had a rubbery texture, and interestingly Paradise does not serve desert. 

Being the only real, ""cantina"" (which I guess is Spanish for douchy bar) around UNLV, its my sad duty to report that they have almost no beers on tap beyond the standard domestics. The tequila selection was alright but I expected more from the place. If your looking for a real cantina check out Diablo's or Hussong's on the strip.

Fortunately the bar has a good TV set-up to catch the game. TVs everywhere along with the big patio out front makes it a good spot together for friends. Our server told us about the happy hour on the drinks and food which along with the TVs makes Paradise a good spot to catch a game.

Paradise Cantina happens to be located next to CVS, and since we were becoming regulars there, we figured we'd check it out! Our server Jax did a good job taking care of our needs out on the front patio. She brought me delicious, probably life-saving tacos.  We ordered a basket of chips and salsa, as well as some margaritas. The guac that came with the chips was delicious! The salsa was very fresh too. And the tacos weren't bad, albeit pretty messy! (I put a safety bib on the husband.)

Spoke with some more friendly employees back inside on my way to the ladies room (which I happily found to be very clean!) I complimented their salsa and they informed me everything is made fresh daily. This pleases me.

I was heading to the Hard Rock for a show at the Joint and didnt feel like spending the usual more on drinks there than the ticket costs so were were hunting some affordable pre-game drinks. I walked in at 5 on a Saturday and was thrilled to discover Happy Hour on Saturday-yes. I asked the bartender what was what and he explained that basically all drinks were 2 for 1. So my Stoli greyhound was $6 and came with an identical twin-ideal! 
 
The drinks were good and strong and I realized about 45 mins before show time that I hadnt eaten anything yet. We glanced at the basic mexican themed bar menu and quickly chose chicken nachos which were unfortunately, very average. Nothing real good about these- bland and uninspired  but filling and quick. So it was 2 more cheapies and then scamper(stumble?) across the street for some rock n roll.

It's the fist decent margarita I have had in Las Vegas. Now coming from California we are used to strong margaritas, free chips, free salsa and very good Mexican food. 

No free chips and salsa here...We look on the menu and it is $8.99 for chips, salsa and guac. Of course, we pass! One of us was having a dish that included chips & salsa and he offered to give it to me. A couple of us ordered tacos and one ordered the hamburger, all of which was pretty good (my husband loved the hamburger) and nice sized portions. 

The dish that came with salsa came with a miniature plastic cup (about an ounce-the kind that are in little mexican places for salsa to go) of salsa. When I commented on the size the waitress said she could bring more if we wanted. Naturally I wanted more, I call the waitress over and she informs me another wee ounce of salsa is $1.00 more. I was shocked and she didn't seem apologetic at all. Her mood changed immediately after that and we realized this is what you get in a tourist town. I visit Vegas frequently because my son lives here so I am used to seeing how short sighted these restaurants are.

To the owners, after spending time on your empty patio during happy hour...you really are missing it. You need to cater to the locals...the cost of chips and salsa is minimal and I can guarantee the minute you start putting free chips and salsa on your tables your restaurant will always be full!! GUARANTEED!

Final word...definitely stop for a margarita during happy hour but be careful what you order as there are hidden extra charges. It's also off the strip which makes parking handy.",sOU04a7dbqcQys1GuP-v8g,0,0,3,J71PXjkswXCYZ-d7L3fFoQ

Queso is of the canned variety and while bizarely addictive (because who else serves queso in Vegas and let's face it, any is better than none at all..) is kind of sour.  Then there are lunch specials.  Order the tostada and beware!  bring an army of hungry folks - it's not one, it's 2 loaded up and served with a generous side of vegetables. Look - is getting lots of food a bad thing? No, but who wants mexican food the day after - it's soggy, drippy, awful. Particularly if you're packaging up leftovers in foam clamshells (who still does that???!!). Wouldn't it be easier to actually offer portion sizes tailored towards lunch and not the ultimate food coma?  

Don't want tequila or a beer? Yes, it's possible - and one decent white wine isn't too much to ask - but apparently here it is. Gack. 

I should have brought my entire office to eat the meal I purchased -- they'd have left completely full - but I wanted some quiet time after a stressful morning of back to back meetings.  Now I know why I've not been in before and why I probably won't be back.

Oh yeah...folks that work there have grown accustomed to it and probably don't notice it - but the restaurant smells bad. I should have left before entering completely  - but I was just worn out and thought surely it couldn't be that bad.

Do not recommend eating here. Drinking beer...yes..watching sports..yes...eating and drinking mixed drinks...NO WAY! It get's one star because I will not go to a Mexican place that charges for chips and salsa...and if the salsa is bad...I'd rather just go to an American Sports Bar/restaurant. 

You have to pay for chips and salsa. 5.99 for a quarter cup of salsa and when we asked for a bit more salsa to go with our chips, we noticed at the end we were charged an extra dollar for the little bit xtra salsa!!! The guacamole tasted like it came prepackaged and was store bought and not fresh at all. 

Con: Food- Everything tastes like it came out of a can but you are charged like they grew the tomatoes, jalapenos, and onions themselves! Too expensive for what you get. Ordered the fajitas as those are kind of hard to mess up and yes they were bad! Bad flour tortillas, shrimp was from on of those frozen bags that you get for like 5 bucks in your supermarket frozen aisle.

Pro: THIS IS WHAT THE ONE Staple Mandatory STAR IS FOR, guess yelp feels everything is good for at least one thing..... What you are paying for is the tv's, decorations, and live sports feed. Do not recommend paying for a drink that is mixed just go for the bottled kind. It is a much better value and at least you know what you are paying for.

Taco Bell with my 42"" Flat Screen TV and Surround Sound System at home is a much better experience.

The food was disgusting I ordered a Taco Salad and that should be good no matter where you go, um not at this place really, my dad ordered a burrito and he was disappointed as well, nothing even resembling to tasty traditional mexican food, it was more like fast greasy frozen food that has been sitting in the back, yuck. I could of had Taco Bell or one of those fast food chains, cuz if I did my tummy wouldn't of been sick a week after eating that food. My dad is a big bear drinker, usually always orders draught beer, he said that this place probably hasn't even cleaned their pipes for years, the beer was flat no taste to it at all, and yea I trust him cuz my dad always leaves his glass empty always asking for another glass, but not this time I guess?!

I strongly recommend that Paradise Cantina betters in their kitchen, maybe hires an actual cook that makes fresh food and also try's better in customer service. The servers are very rude, it takes them forever to take your order and their attitude is not pleasant at all, they have no clue what's on the menu, when you ask them questions about the food they have no clue or they don't even try explain.. I'd also say it would be best if Paradise Cantina could try manage the place better all together it could be better, you guys are only lucky right now because tourists like me don't know what they are stepping into, but I don't really thinks locals would go there, the place right now is just junk all together.

Funniest thing outside the place there is a HUGE banner saying they are the #1 mexican place, and its even been awarded, umm idk think that's true honestly...  Sorry guys I really hope you improve somehow...",6mhq8BcuCFmbWmkSlhUXuQ,1,0,1,RqyyZTdrr4NBoKpVaLhu0w

4540243,2011-12-04,1,w55sCX7ZkLIJNhl_RhwjEg,"Like David who was here about two weeks ago, this is a place I would not return to.  This was our second experience here and like David said the chips are ok, but that is about it.  The cheese they use is not good, the salsa you can make at home and make it taste better and the food was average.

What seems to attract people to this place is the happy hour times which offers 2 for 1 drinks.  It seems like they are surviving off the bar and NOT the food.  

On the bottom of the receipt is CLEARLY states GREAT MEXICAN FOOD NOTHING OVER 10.$.  This is exactly how it is written..WRONG...They should change this before someone decides to take the time to sue them for false advertising and shuts them down.  

Two people in our party ordered Fajitas and we were charged $11.00 for each.  Now I am not a math wizard, but I do believe that contradicts what they advertise on their receipt.  Also, if you order Enchilada or a burrito, most Mexican Restaurants give you that with rice and beans...NOT THIS PLACE, they charge you $2.00 extra if you want sides with your food bring the total cost of your dish, YOU GUEST IT, to OVER $10.00.  You end up paying anywhere from $10.50 to $13.00 for that plate. 

AND DON'T""T EVEN THINKS OF ASKING FOR MORE TORTILLA'S unless you want to pay $1.00 per request.  

The staff has been very nice on both visits which makes the place bearable...One couple in our party was NOT impressed with the alcohol the first time around and sent their drinks back.  It does look like they took those drinks off the bill even though they FAIL to inform you of this.  They don't inform you of the extra charges or if they do something to benefit you, ITS A SURPRISE AND EVERYONE LOVES SURPRISES WHEN THEY GO OUT TO EAT FROM A RESTAURANT RIGHT???

So one last example, they offer a burrito called enchilada style, which means they put sauce and cheese on the outside.  The burrito is $7.00 but for the scoop of sauce and a little cheese, you guessed it, $2.00 extra and then if you want rice, beans and chips with your burrito, another $2.00 bringing the total to $11.00.....Again $1.00 over the NOTHING OVER $10.00 quote on the receipt.  

Lastly about the Fajita plate, $11.00 is apparently without meat, if you want meat, anther $2.00 and the beans offered on the side, another $2.00, that is a $15.00 plate and in any other restaurant, the price would be the same but would include rice, chips and ALL THE TORTILLA's you desire at NO EXTRA CHARGE.

This is Vegas folks, there are a LOT better Mexican Restaurants in town for the same price of a $13.00 to $15.00 plate with NO HIDDEN CHARGES, better drinks, and just as good Happy Hour Specials.

The ONLY SAVING grace this place has and this is why they will survive in this town David, is that they are close to UNLV so people who don't have cars can indulge, they are not far from the strip and they do have a LOT OF TVs for watching sports and most people don't need more then a few drinks and some chips to munch on while watching a game.  Just make sure you enjoy the chips dry as the VERY SMALL dish of salsa is NOWHERE NEAR enough for the amount of chips you get and YOU WILL GET CHARGED if you ask for MORE....

There are better places to watch sports in this town as well.   Read through the reviews, the 4 stars are from people who enjoy cheap, low alcohol drinks who think they are getting a deal.  Read Ms Fabulous W from 5/15/2011, you will really see what your Happy Hour Drink are getting you....LOL

The minute we walk through the door he is given an update on the game.  No one there is a Cardinals fan.  Everyone there seemed to know one another and had no problem with us joining in.  Everyone is friendly. Everyone is watching all the games. Everyone there is about football.  Not fanatics, just enjoying the games.  Oh, this is a Cleaveland Browns bar by the way.

Food.  Now I recommend the Pozole. The best I have had in years. No greasy film floating on the broth.  Plenty of shredded pork, hominy, cabbage and radish.  Oh just thinking about it I want more!  The food is not doused in melted cheese and runny beans. This is Mexican food you get when you go to your friends house and his mom cooks.  Clean, fresh food.  

The bar, well that's a different story. But, it's a 24/7 neighborhood bar.  The decor reflects that.  But if you stop to consider its open 24/7 it's in remarkable shape.  Yes, there is duct tape holding the top of the toilet in the women's room together and some of the cushions on the bar stools are a little worse for wear, some of the table are a little wobbly and the ceiling fans outside look like the just might take flight, but over all, it's one of the best ""dive bars"" I have ever been.

It just got worse from there. They served two groups who arrived after us well before they brought our food. Messed up one of the orders and completely omitted another.  No discount except the item that was missed. Terrible service and terrible atmosphere.,ynUCG9UaEOVrWy7PlhZB5w,0,0,1,1QoPeANaFyuE7FdFlGrcIQ
5600069,2012-01-09,0,w55sCX7ZkLIJNhl_RhwjEg,"I am basing this review from a combination of atleast 5 visits to this place.  I only go this place for a Rebel Game pre-funk or a post Rebel game party.  It is about a 5-10 minute walk to the T & M (of course that depends on how fast you walk).

I stopped there once for a pre-funk and it was pretty much full.  It was evening game and the bar was having happy hour so it worked out perfetcly.  All beers were 2 for 1!  I got 2 dos equis for like $4!

Now... if you stop by here on a post Rebel game night the place will be packed with Rebel fans!  I think the bar gives you a free drink if you show them your stub... ticket stub.  It turns out to be a lively place with cheap drinks!

As far as the food goes... it's more of a drinking place instead of a restaurant, but it serves ok mexican food.  

This is a funb place before and or after the Rebel games!",L15JCA18Ib_vMUVJILxiSw,0,0,4,Pr04I944S9AMJL59jWVPYQ

5660037,2016-07-16,1,w55sCX7ZkLIJNhl_RhwjEg,"The only reason I come here is for the crazy happy hour. They have 2 for 1 and a pretty decent selection of drinks you can choose from. They both have to be the same drink though. I would recommend swapping one of your drinks with a friend so you can have two different drinks
Their food is okay, nothing special. The last time that I was here they weren't playing music off of their Touchtunes for some reason. They were playing the radio, which seemed super tacky to me and the commercials were extremely loud. 

 I definitely wouldn't go out of my way to come here but it's close to my work and the go to spot for cheap drinks.",lHFkt91UFwQUywggO8yDHA,1,0,3,2aD6dcqbyzLLn5-pa791tQ
5769873,2018-05-22,0,w55sCX7ZkLIJNhl_RhwjEg,"Darn good happy hour!  Like for real.  Not only do you get 2 for 1 drinks but it lasts such a long time.  A happy hour that ends at 8pm?  Um yes.  

The margaritas we ordered weren't that great but to be honest I wasn't expecting much so this place has already gone above my expectations.  I ordered 2 Puerto Vallartas at first but the server came back and informed me this was a $30 drink.  If they had the prices on the menu I would not have ordered this but I do super appreciate him warning me (even if it wasn't when I placed the order) and giving me a chance to get a normal margarita.  

We also ordered steak nachos.  Again, I wasn't expecting much.  No these nachos didn't blow me away.  They were pretty run of the mill cheap nachos.  But they weren't terrible so I'll give them that.  I might be biased though because I love all nachos, good and bad.

The service I received wasn't bad at all.  We were seated right away.  Our order was taken right away.  The drinks and food came out quickly.  The server came by and checked on us multiple times.  We got our check quickly.  

I don't know if I'll start frequenting this place but I'm also not opposed to coming back.",byV70bKT87SHgN0uRtow6w,1,0,3,cMaRUnRWddzHZPnbKD8Ccw

The restaurant has a Touch Tunes sound system. I logged in. Set up a few songs but the waitstaff and bartender caused it to skip the ones they didn't like. I know because they overly laughed about it with a ""oops"" and a laugh.  Won't be back.",QhZuBfoAafdoBoRU1mbfeQ,1,0,1,URGamp7ePglvMnx3ajpi9w

Service is fast, food comes out hot and the service seems to be pretty fast. It's kinda like a hole in the wall Mexican joint that serves a purpose.

I enjoy the pretzel with spicy cheese sauce as my food du jour. Don't expect haute cuisine, it's just a fun place to meet up with your friends after work to drink and chat. The food isn't amazing, but you're probably just here for the drinks. Stick to pub grub. Wings and queso dip are some good options too.

Keep your expectations low and have fun!",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,10,9,5,KUd1Gf-6X25Wo-5zaqqzDg

I ordered the steak wet burrito which was yummy after a long day at a trade show and my sister ordered the tacos. We were famished and thirsty so this was good on an average level. We then ordered the hot wings to go for later since we knew we were heading straight back to the hotel room to .... sleep!",CScKVOGaZ-kbdJXOgt8l8A,0,0,3,MBuWiCthAk3Lr0miGDvGsw
