One of the things to do before you clock out of life is to eat some good pizza and you be glad you checked it off your bucket list so you can rest easy. From the upbeat atmosphere as you enter Good Pie with a complimentary aroma of fresh pizza ingredients can make you drool a bit. The crunch is just right for the crust on top with great fresh toppings of whatever pizza style you decide to eat. My preferred choice is the Detroit style ""A Good Time"" pizza so pick your toppings and enjoy a mouth watering joyride of goodness.

I'm from Bridgeport, Connecticut and I know good Ahbeetz.  This is the best I have found since moving to Fabulous Las Vegas 11 years ago.  The vast majority of what passes for pizza here, and the rest of the County for that matter, has no relation to the real north east thing.
The crust makes the pie and Good Pie does it right.  They use authentic, flavorful ingredients.  The pepperoni has that little zing I expect.  
There are tables outside and some stools along the window inside.  Go there more than once and they will treat you as an old friend.
The owner is from Brooklyn and knows how to do things the right way.

1532765,2018-04-08,0,8GOle3PqqZnni4U-vXBKQA,"Delivery review of one item so take it for what you will (Vegan). I was trapped at work and needed something for dinner and came across Good Pie in my search for something Vegan. The Vegan Balls sounded like a tasty option. The description said they came (5) to and order so it sounded pretty substantial, esp at a $12 (reg meat balls are only $9 - but I will save the rant on dietary preference up charges - but my GF free people I know you are right there with me on this one). 

The order arrived (promptly - cause Postmates rocks) and my Postmate told me he was hearing good things about this place. The bag felt pretty light so I knew I was not getting what my hungry brain was anticipating.

I should have taken a photo with the Vegan balls next to a casino chip for scale, they were about that size in diameter. Pretty skimpy I feel for $12 (and I'm not a cheap person when it comes to good food). I feel like at that price a few Vegan Knots or a little pasta on the side would have been a nice touch. 

The Vegan Balls and sauce were tasty, no complaints there. Luckily, I had some chick peas to throw in so I felt full otherwise I would have been on the prowl for dinner #2.

Now, after I see the location I understand the price tag. It's in the Container shops next to the Vegas Pawn Stars shop - tourist trap. Well as a local I won't be trapped in $12 Chumlee's skimpy balls again.",LkhR5vafpSVx11WCl2wXMQ,3,2,2,pux0KEkUvnkQSP9NtN4PdQ

We hung out and talked to the owner for a bit and he seemed like an old friend back in NYC. He said he wanted to create a neighborhood pizza joint... and he has. With some of the best pizza I have ever had anywhere... and we are from NYC too and are picky! 

I highly recommend the ""That's dat good $hit"" pizza... it will knock your socks off! Holy moly! We had the Johnny Be Good today... also amazing. We also tried one of their special stromboli's... also sooooo good! Truffle artichoke hearts?! Um... yum!!

Bein a Sicilian and growing up around pizza my whole life and around family members who used to sell the products used to make pizzas I consider myself to know a lil bit more than the average guy. What you see on a bookcase as you walk in are some of the products he uses to dress up his pizzas and they are all top of the line high quality ingredients. He show's love to all his pizzas more than most as you will see him baste his crust in olive oil and spice up his pizzas with garlic, parsley and grana to name a few and shaves off some fresh parmesan on the pie as it exits the oven. As well as great pizza, a great owner who will show you and teach you a few things about pizza you never new. Pizza Rock is great but i'm sorry to break it to y'all but Vincent is the new Frank Sinatra of slices here in Vegas and his whole pies are even better.

Chef Vincent Rotolo and his staff are nailing the slice game with Detroit, Brooklyn, and grandma-style pies that are as tasty as they are picturesque. They even have gluten-free and vegan options, so no one has to miss out on the goodness.

Location is a small spot in Pawn Plaza, decorated with wooden spoons, cheese-grater light fixtures, and photos of grandmas everywhere. It's cozy with bar seating and some exterior tables, but most orders seem to be takeout. I try to place an order before heading in because the display makes me want to take everything I can carry.

Good Shroom- my favorite so far, with a medley of mushrooms, caramelized onions, and 3 kinds of cheese. Worth the extra workouts.
Good White- give me the garlic oil, and on one gets hurt. Love the addition of basil to this classic.
Good Pep- tried this during their opening and while it was tasty, what they're serving now looks way better so I need a redo on this one.
Good Veg- I regularly celebrate Meatless Mondays but the one time I had this version, everything was super fresh but not amazing like other pies. Still probably better that other places, though.

Service has been friendly even when they're hella busy and I love following them on social media and seeing the great community connections they have. Vegas is a huge food city and there really is no reason for so much competition- Vincent's genuine relationships with other chefs in the pizza posse is refreshing.

Service 5/5
Sauce 5/5
Crust 5/5

We came for a vegan ""grandma style"" pie late on a Saturday... Tom, the pizza maker, was super friendly and explained the pizza making process to us while assembling our vegan creation. He was friendly, kind, and worked fast. The attention to detail, care, and love he put into the food was remarkable. 

The pizza itself was cooked to perfection- the crust was crispy, the Numu vegan cheese melted beautifully atop the fresh veggies and DELICIOUS red sauce (might be the best red sauce I've ever tasted). 

Highly recommend this place for everyone - whether you like a thin and crispy crust, a slightly more doughy Brooklyn style, or Detroit style deep dish, meat eater or plant eater alike- This is the best pizza in Las Vegas by a landslide.

First time I came in, the kid making my pizza forgot about it, somehow - place wasn't even busy. The pizza was ok and the crust didn't look over cooked at a glance but was definitely more crispy than it should have been - I was disappointed since I live next door to the place. 
2nd time I go, the pizza was better but just ok. I had a veggie slice that I'm not sure if they forgot to heat up or just don't heat it up? I'm not sure but they didn't say it was supposed to be cold and instead of asking I supposed I was not really in a send it back mood. It was not bad but I remained skeptical. The place looks great and the owner is enthusiastic so I had to try again - hell I live 300 feet away. 
3rd time, today, I finally caught the owner while he was in the shop and they we're making pizza. I kept going in there when the place was not open yet and I'm not sure if it's because he's around but I was Very Pleased with the Pizza this time around - Really Enjoyed it and it tasted  great! Could be that I had it ""Grandma style"". 

This apparently is their specialty, as they said so, and I would have to agree with them. I refused to give up on this place because I live right next door and if they can keep turning out Grandma styles like they did this evening, I'll be a regular over there when I'm having a craving for some Good Pie.",T4qC5I54Sa69JDXbxL9S6Q,2,0,4,VmzM2CmVzIH6sHzzEsWDsA

The crust is as important to me as the toppings and Good Pie nails them both.  All the styles of their pizzas are excellent.

The toppings are fresh and flavorful and are arranged in just the right order and just the right amount for the best flavor combination.

They show so much love to the dietary restriction rainbow! Which I seriously appreciate. BUT- this was not the only reason we loved Good Pie. As a vegas local I've been hearing so much buzz about this spot. We had a concert to attend, so I figured a quick pizza bite sounded like a perfect way to kick start our evening. They have all kinds of options on the line for pizza by the slice- as well as a full menu of pies you can have freshly made. 

The staff was super cool, and really helpful. (With The amount of options they offer- you will want opinions.) 
The gal at the front guided us by sharing her personal favs with us so we could order the more popular choices for both meat and non meat eaters. 

Our Pizzas were bomb. Like seriously delicious. 
We also ordered the vegan meat balls. You guys.... when I took my first bite (as a vegetarian) I panicked. It was so meat like I had to double check to be sure what I was eating was not a true Meat ball. DONT WORRY- it was in fact a vegan meatball and it was probably one of the most delicious meatballs I've ever had in my life.

Also, the crust on both slices were still soggy. I think for a three meat type pizza, the Dom at Grimaldi's is much better and for just simple slices, Bambino's East on Durango is much better (and it's only $5.99 for two cheese slices with a drink). 

The reason for the low rating is a combination of factors. 1) The parking situation sucks. To park, the attendants want you to fill out a card giving your personal information to a company related to the Pawn Stars. 2) Extremely limited seating. There are only a few spots inside and sitting outside when it's 112F, even in the shade, isn't pleasant. I know it's just a ""dry heat"" but come on, 112F is hot, dry or not! 3) Value. It's on the expensive side and this isn't The Strip or Fremont 4) I watched the lady working behind the counter cut slices for other customers and the pattern seemed to make sense, make one cut with the wheel and give the customer the resulting end slice. However, when she cut our slice off the pizza, she made two cuts then gave us the second slice from the end. It was the worst of three slices (including the one in the display) she could've grabbed. I'm not sure why this was done, but it seemed weird at the time. Maybe I'm not the ""preferred"" type of customer.",89MRppNHY1wtoI0V7vqdSA,0,0,1,DX-MBIlyNPdF8AMzJlpvvQ

We were visiting Las Vegas during my daughter's volleyball tournament. Our family is on a strict Gluten-Free diet, so I used Yelp and saw Good Pie was close by. When I called to ask if they offered Gluten-Free Pizza, Vincent, the proud owner, told me they had won an award for the Best Gluten Free Pizza in a worldwide competition (3rd in the world). I thought he was joking at first, but when we arrived we saw the plaque proudly displayed on his wall. We ordered a couple of Gluten-Free Pizzas. Although we have eaten our fair share of gluten-free pizza, none could even come close to comparing to the pizzas Vincent crafted for us. Every GF pizza we have ever had prior was paper thin and was mostly pizza toppings, leaving you hungry at the end of the day. Good Pie makes the most AMAZING Deep Dish Gluten-Free Pizza I have ever tasted!!! It was SO delicious and SO filling. I can only imagine that their regular pizza is just as good! Thanks Vincent for making it your passion to ensure that those that are restricted to a gluten-free diet are offered food just as tasty and delicious as everybody else.

There are a couple stools inside, and there's some outside seating; but that's not what I mean.  It's not a restaurant, it's more of a togo place.  That isn't really a problem, but the weather made it impossible to enjoy the outdoor seating. 

That being said, this is a great choice for someone walking around the down town area or stopping by pawn shop and wanting to grab a quick slice.  As we all know, pizza by the slice seems to be a phenomenon in Vegas, and Good Pie delivers on that end.  There was a great selection of slices ready to go, and I took the recommendation of ordering a few of the pepperoni slices ""grandma style"".  I have to say, the slices were VERY good.  Good pizza is hard to find in this par of the world, and this is definitely good pizza.

5134920,2018-04-13,1,8GOle3PqqZnni4U-vXBKQA,"I've been to Good Pie for a slice or two four times since it opened in February.  So this review is based on multiple visits.

First of all, this is damned good pizza.  Super fresh, cooked just right, amazing taste.  Everything is homemade and you can tell that someone is paying close attention to quality.  I had a minor problem with a slice on one of my visits and they were ""on it"" - problem fixed ASAP.  Great service.

This is a slice place (big slices), but they also sell full pies.  It isn't cheap, but it also isn't a run-of-the-mill pizza joint.  This is authentic, as real as it gets.  The sauces are amazing.  The cheese is fresh.  Best pepperoni I've tasted.  Something for everyone on the menu.  

I highly recommend this place.  I moved to Las Vegas (from LA) 2 years ago and have tried a dozen pizza spots - once each (I didn't like them).  I've been to Good Pie four times in 6 weeks.  Enough said?",YLiNhJUwogXgIwCa3wrWKg,3,1,5,xD7r7l1CyHUnX5s2gSMGpg

This is one of the great pizza experiences in this world, including New York and Italy. Know why?  My ace Vincent Rotolo is a truly obsessed man of pizza. It's all he cares about, just ask him.  

This joint is the culmination of a lifetime of pizza envy, and restaurant experience.  

Vinny is a Brooklyn transplant who took this town by storm, first he ran Circo in the Bellagio, then a joint called Flour and Barley, then Dom DeMarco's , then Evel Pie, perfecting his craft.   When he was a young gun in New York he was the only Italian waiter at Barney Greengrass.  The old time guys that worked there nicknamed him the Italian Scallion.  True story.  Now he's got his own place.  

The pizza is crispy and chewy,  airy and light, the sauce perfectly tomatoey and tangy, the pepperonis are small and delicious.  Everything is from Italy, his Grandma pie is the best i ever had.   There is ample seating outside, we had a great time.  

For all you dopes that put ranch dressing on pizza, or think Little Caesars is good, this place ain't for you, this is real pizza, Capiche?? 

When you're in Vegas make the effort to see Vincent and his Pizzaiolos. Ask him about the dough, ask him about the sauce, he's the best.",rgkdB72VR3-o_xFbFUn9EQ,6,3,5,WuUSvbnB9zQCUP2mEbPrWw

Specializing in thin crust (round and square) and Detroit style with caramelized cheese crust this is New York without the plane ticket. Ever so slightly greasy pepperoni (in the best sense), perfectly spiced sauce, and a thin ever so chewy crust with the right amount of char all come together to make the perfect pie.

If they can crank out such good pies during their $1 slice opening during which they sold 500 slices in 2 hours then there is no question that they makes a damn Good Pie.",-TrZfd9aC4k_7A2i0icMVg,16,11,5,QMWTKU_6OBcpS8kWt8NRTw

My bf and I got there when it opened so all our orders were made fresh. While we waited we were offered a slice of Good Cheese. For a plain cheese pizza, it was stellar. The sauce was on the sweet side (which i like) and paired well with the other savory ingredients. The dough was thin and crispy with an airy crust and it didn't bend when you lifted it. This was the only round we tried. the other slices were all square. I have to say that The good Shroom and Good Good were the best of the four we had. Not to say the Good Cheese and the Good White weren't excellent. But there was just tons of mushroom flavor in every bite. And I think artichokes on a pizza has become more the norm these days and i'm not complaining. It's right in the neighborhood so it's safe to say this place will definitely be in my normal rotation for sure.",_tKckzzITu2XYyDfxqqqpg,1,1,5,HwDbl_LC6SKfbTEmpF9gpw

5279661,2018-06-14,2,8GOle3PqqZnni4U-vXBKQA,"Apparently a day for offering feedback beyond the typical 'reviews' it was after the lunch rush that a visit was made to Good Pie, Vince Rotolo and his team celebrating their four month anniversary by featuring a few Specials with more to come as Summer approaches quickly.

Turning a corner early in its lifespan thanks to Vincent's investment in the downtown community, a win at the Back of House Brawl and good business from local law firms helping along a space that suffers from a location tucked in the back corner of Pawn Plaza, it was as a few take-out orders were called in that Chef Rotolo was found in typically good spirits, just he and one employee present but the window stocked with Slices as well as Garlic Knots and a few Salads.

Last seen by way of catering that had colleagues calling Good Pie ""the best Pizza I've ever tasted,"" the Grandma-style and Vince's passionate discussion of its history winning over fans who'd never given much thought to the worldwide love of Pizza, it was in homage to both Grandma and New York's L&B Spumoni Gardens that teeth cracked through a thin and crispy Crust protected from 3-fold the normal amount of Sauce by Cheese, everything about the idea an upgrade on the Brooklyn legend, though fans of thicker Dough may disagree.

Further improving the décor since late February, Mets and Brooklyn Dodgers paraphernalia joining a Caputo display plus more Grandmas for the wall, it was in follow-up to the slice that Chef Rotolo rolled out a new daily special intended to be served at lunch, Good Pie's version of a Stromboli slightly larger than the typical Meatball Hero or Hoagie and faring far better thanks to Pizza Dough allowed to rise around it plus Vince's Tomato Sauce and top-quality Mozzarella.

Offering both a Caesar and House Salad for the health-conscious, each punching above their pricetag thanks to Greens from Urban Seed plus housemade dressing including a honeyed-Vinaigrette, it is finally after a few tweaks that Good Pie is proud to serve Garlic Knots that unravel to a light pull with flaky insides and plenty of flavor, the still-in-the-works Bread proving even more aromatic and already better than most - no simple Butter and Garlic Powder here, but instead whole Cloves cooked and preserved in Oil forming the backbone to a soft and toothsome Loaf.

FIVE STARS:  Evolving the concept daily, Pizza and passion never a problem for Rotolo no matter where he is cooking, a look at Good Pie four months in shows signs of continued excellence with more good things soon to come.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,7,9,5,hFMfI0tLOWUV2cEVJAJp7A

After my original review the owner contacted me right sway. The costumer service level at this location is amazing! I originally was never expecting a response, as most places do not care enough to response, but not here. He went out of his way to make sure my experience was amazing, made the pizza himself, and even found bacon for me! The pizza was delicious. Crust was crispy, the sauce was great. It was perfect. Im glad this place is close to work and if every experience is like today i will be a loyal costumer. 



I decided to order a pizza from here due to the amazing reviews. The place is minutes from work so it was also very convenient. Needles to say i am disappointed. My pizza was bland at best. I ordered a ham pizza (the ham is extra as is in most places) and my pizza barely had any. It was hard to find. I will probably go back and give it another try since it is close to work. Maybe they were just having an off day. I posted a picture of one of the slices. This is the slice that had the most ham.",u7Y6WGgyDBg4b26gt22QjA,0,0,5,cmy46i4_gGIUIyTC6B9CVQ

And they have GLUTEN FREE VEGAN CHEESE pizza.  As someone who is gluten and dairy intolerant, I really appreciate this, even though I will suffer the consequences of having gluten and dairy for the sake my my tastebuds.

The garlic knots are insane.  Dough rolled up to be crispy on the outside and pillowy on the inside, covered in caramelized fried garlic, Parmesan cheese and herbs.  The red sauce it comes with is perfect!  Well balanced, not too sweet or too tangy.  Just right!!!

The pizza is made with a sourdough starter so the crust has more flavor and gets crispier but stays soft.  The toppings are pretty standard but of the best quality.  We wanted to try Detroit style (Sicilian is my all time favorite kind of pizza) but they gave the last dough out to the guys in front of us in line.  We ended up getting the round Brooklyn style which was still very delicious.

 The Caesar salad is great too.  Locally grown hydroponic greens with a very delicious dressing and tasty sourdough croutons.

I was really impressed with the service.  The girl taking our order was patient and funny.  She even got us salt from the back.  The owner (I think) was greeting everyone and telling them his story and the story of the pizza.

5930306,2018-06-05,0,8GOle3PqqZnni4U-vXBKQA,"If you're vegan/gluten free - listen up! I'm both. And I know how hard it is to find good gluten free, especially when it has to be vegan also.

I heard about Good Pie from suggestions made to another local vegan/gluten free gal on the Las Vegas Vegans Facebook. After leaving the Lights game at Cashman tonight I decided I wanted pizza.. a good pizza.. and we came to the right place.

I ordered online on the website which had such a great and easy app. I set my order around 10:25 and was immediately notified by email that it'd be ready at 10:38. We got the vegan pizza on gluten free crust. There was a note that vegan cheese was not offered yet so I wasn't feeling too excited but I was hungry enough to keep an open mind! So we took the risk. We weren't far so we got there quickly. Definitely a hidden gem next to that tv pawn shop. We almost missed it!

Tom was our cook and I think the girl who greeted us is named Rachel (I am SO sorry I forgot and am not entirely sure if I remember the name correctly) she was a cute young girl with dyed red hair. She gave us such a great introduction, and made us feel very welcome and comfortable. When I double checked with her that I got the gluten free crust and that it was still vegan, she reassured me saying orders marked gluten free have it big and bolded because they know how serious people's reactions to gluten may be. She then told me about how the owner really won an award for that crust, and how the person who got first place was one of his students. What a great story! Imagine winning twice like that. I was really excited to try it.

Now if you've been gluten free for a while you know what to expect from GF anything. Sandy, heavy, chewy, etc. The pizza was still hot in the car when I decided to dive in to a slice and I was so impressed! There is crisp, fluff, dimension.. this is probably the best gluten free bread-ish product I've ever had. And vegan on top of it! I was so so impressed.

I think I was on my second slice when I absent-mindedly told my boyfriend ""I actually don't miss the cheese."" And he responded that he really didn't either, that it still tastes great and doesn't feel like cheese-less pizza. I don't know how to explain it.. the texture of the crust up too where the sauce was held was interesting enough to substitute for the cheese. I can't imagine how great it will be once the vegan cheese does make it to Good Pie - shoot I may even request their pizza without cheese!

So if you're holding off on trying a yummy vegan pizza from Good Pie because they currently don't offer vegan cheese - you're a dummy! Try it anyway!

Another note - I am currently 38 weeks pregnant. My pizza had peppers as a topping as well as a decent amount of the marinara sauce.. and tomatoey things (to my heartbreak and dismay) contribute to very, very bad heartburn. I don't know what Good Pie does but the tomato sauce was very flavorful, but neutral, not bitter like other marinara sauces  - in a good way - I got NO heartburn from it. Not even the next day.. it didn't cause any heartburn in my poor pregnant self at all! I've been avoiding Italian foods specifically for that. Even Good Pie's tomato sauce tasted amazing and didn't give me heartburn! I was so happy. 

I can't wait to go back. The pizza was great, the environment reminds me of family owned pizza shops in LA, the staff was so kind, it's been such a long time since I've been SO impressed. Every detail about the pizza and experience was wonderful. It took me days to write this review. Thank you Good Pie!!",tiNBpM5jQQvFAw_1zQWTGQ,0,0,5,btDCtHD7Vg0OGvcCL4lL3A
