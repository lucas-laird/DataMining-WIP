I figured it wouldn't take too long since they're really close, BUT MAN WAS I WRONG. I placed my order through yelp around 5:46pm. My pizza and garlic knots did not get to my house until around 7:30-7:40pm!!!!!!!!!!!!! 2 freaking hours!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! That is beyond ridiculous. I've never ever waited that long for delivery before. When my pizza came it wasn't even hot and my garlic knots were chewy.

It is more of a convenience factor. They always get my order incorrect, and I have to walk back up there to get side pieces like dressing, ketchup, other things like lettuce, cheese missing from burger? On several occasions I've even asked them to confirm everything was there, they said yes, and it's still missing. They never can get it right. Well I was feeling lazy one day so I got delivery, and of course made the mistake of not checking the food ( should know better by now ) I check my burger and it's a gyro? I call right back to let them know, mind u they are right across the street, and they let me know ""if"" they want me to fix my order, they will have to charge me an additional delivery fee?!?!? Are you kidding me??? I literally started laughing and asked to speak to a manager. ALI (the rudest person I have ever gotten customer service from in Las Vegas) said if I didn't like ""his customer service"" I could come in and talk to the boss when he gets in after 5pm (it's 1:14pm)???

527374,2017-01-14,0,Sm2k1ijcnK17Ro5paN2_qQ,Seriously awesome restaurant. So I ordered dinner for me and my family on Tuesday night right before they were about to close . Everything was full of flavor and fresh out of the oven. The dough they use for the garlic balls and zappolis is fluffy and just simply amazing. It melts in your mouth and when they arrived they were still hot like fresh out of the oven. We had the Hawaiian pizza with pineapples and turkey ham. It was sooo good that we are ordered it again tonight. We also had the chicken parmesean dinner which was fantasic too. It came with a side salad and bread. Aside from all of that.... the chicken wings deserve 10 stars! Seriously they are BIG wings and are just made right and the homemade ranch sauce goes perfectly well with them. I will definitely be ordering again and again!,Qf-n5HZwRrKnTAJOZ0gXSw,0,0,5,oeKX_2YEh0RNAKiw-tQkXQ

960106,2016-09-09,0,Sm2k1ijcnK17Ro5paN2_qQ,"They have such good pizza. Reasons why: 

1: they put just the right amount of sauce it's not one slice has all the sauce in the world and little cheese then the next slice has no sauce and a ton of cheese 

2: their crust is just right if you say well done it's nice and brown and crisp but not crunchy or burnt if you don't it's still great it's a lighter shade of brown but still has its own high points 
    Grand pizza has a variety of food from salads, to pizza, sandwiches, chicken wings and more. The chicken wings are spicy depending on how you order them but they're very good.

Hot, fresh and simply perfect. Haven't had the chance to try the dessert, however they definitely deserved five stars for the customer service,  awesome manager, and really sweet cook/delivery Guy.

I opened my chicken wing box and found a chicken wing that still had veins and feathers on it.  The rest of our party immediately lost their appetite and did not want to eat the rest of the wings for fear that the unsanitary, not cleaned properly chicken wing had come into contact with the other wings at some point in time.  I called Grand Pizza and spoke with the most uncooperative and rude employee named ALI.  He told me that ""It's just one wing I don't see the problem"" I can only give you store credit for one order of wings"" and finally ""ma'am the wing is not unsanitary it's fried in high temperatures that kill the bacteria just take it out"".  I informed Ali that I would not accept store credit because I would never order food from there again.  I asked him if all the wings were in one container together before being fried and sauced and he said yes we don't have frozen wings.  I then tried to explain that the other wings were not going to be eaten because they were at one point in time in the same container as the unsanitary one.  I asked for a refund on all the wings which was about $25-$30 of out order of over $80 and he refused.  I asked for mangers names and contact information and he said ""call back tomorrow after 10 am"" and then hung up.

We also ordered an 8pc order of wings . 
Half buffalo & half bbq . I would of appreciated a little more sauce on them ? maybe that's just my preference & next time I'll ask for a little extra. 
Girl up front was awesome! Great smile , very welcoming . 
I had to go to the gas station next door for my husband so I wasn't inside waiting when our food was ready . She brought it right out to our car! We were the only customer at the moment at least for pick up, but that was a very nice gesture & those personal touches go a long way!

$10 for $15! Plus free garlic balls when you check in! Those  are delicious too!

I got a Philly cheese. The bread was huge in comparison to the small portion of meat and cheese. It was very cold and hard. The onion rings that came with it may have been good but they were so mushy and falling apart. Eating them was like eating curry with your fingers. 

My wife had the chicken gyro. The chicken was bland and chewy and the sauce didn't have much flavor. The fries were also cold and inedible. 

I knew I was ordering frozen calamari  rings but I love seafood so I went for it. The rings too were ice cold. Extremely chewy. I'm sure they taste fine, from the freezer. I mean, all they do is take them from the freezer, pour them in the deep fry and then hand 'em over although the price doesn't seem to reflect that. 

After having to go in the house and find a pen for delivery guy it was about $33 bucks. 

Never again.

The best value is to use the coupon, & order 2 single topping large pies. Our net cost was $12. They have a 30"" pizza, but it was cheaper to get 2 16"" pies. Now for the quality & taste. The dough was nice & stretchy. This is achieved by using high gluten flour, letting it rise 3 times, & then tossing it. It's labor intensive, but there is no other way to get a crust of this flavor. These pies are very traditional, & reminded me of the ones I used to make 40 years ago when I was a pizza cook in a small town. The sauce is balanced. Not too sharp or sweet like some others. They top it off with plenty of fresh mozzarella. We had the mushroom pie, & pepperoni pie. They were generous with the toppings. They used fresh mushrooms, not the canned garbage some places use, & the pepperoni tasted like it was made in a small mom & pop deli, not some huge mass production operation. It was full of flavor & just spicy enough. This will be my go to pizza joint for watching football this fall & hopefully years to come.

Plus when I checked in on here, I got a free order of garlic balls, so I had no reason not to try it. $14 for two big pizzas and garlic balls, I'll take it. 

We got the groupon for the 2 16"" pizzas. It's their medium, but it's huge, not a normal medium. They come with two toppings each. Plus, the free order of garlic balls that is a whole to go box full and come with a container of sauce. I must say, their pizza is delicious! I don't like tomatoes so I always get white sauce on my pizza, but since I didn't have that option with our coupons, I gave it a shot with the tomato sauce. They put a light layer of sauce and then cover, I mean cover the pizza in cheese. It's not like the pizza hut pizzas where there's just sauce over half of the pizza. They do a great job with giving you a big bite with lots of cheese every time. My kind of pizza. They also don't skimp on the toppings. They have their specialty pizzas that you can get too and those looked delicious. We'll probably try one of those next time. 

Their pizzas start at 12"" and go up to 30"". They're a bit more pricey than other places, but I think it's worth it, seeing how they load their pizzas up. Sometimes you have to pay a little more for better quality. They do have a special tho. Its $7.95 for a 1 topping 16"" pizza. They have other things there besides pizza, but I can't judge that stuff until I've tried it. The garlic balls were pretty good too.

2786728,2017-02-04,0,Sm2k1ijcnK17Ro5paN2_qQ,"I hate to give a poor review but this place left me no choice. Had I noticed the reviews under the previously named pizzeria Grand Italia I wouldn't have ordered...2 star avg for 60 reviews. They obviously shut down under that name and rebranded under Grand Pizza, but as you can see by my receipt it's still the same place.
I have previously worked in the pizza/restaurant business for many years and if I was the owner I would truly be ashamed to put out the product that they sent me. I have to question who actually makes the product here and whether the owner is even on site and aware of the shoddy product being served. I truly don't understand the 4 and 5 star reviews on here. I imagine that could either be explained away by people having ordered other menu items or people not really knowing quality pizza (I mean Domino's and Papa John's are multi-million dollar businesses, right?) 
Many other reviews don't even touch upon the quality or taste of the food, but rave about price for the discounted pick-up pizza special, or friendly service and staff. I don't care how nice or cheap you are if I'm getting inedible product. And if the best you can say is the pie was $7.95 well that's not saying a lot is it? I don't want to come here for wings or burgers or chicken sandwiches, salads or quesadillas. I want pizza and calzone! 
My bill with delivery, tax and tip came to around $48 dollars and was not worth even 1/4 of that. I ordered a Sicilian 4 topping pie for $21, a medium two topping Calzone for $15 and a Cannoli for $4 bucks or so. Not one of these items was halfway good.
Let's begin with the pizza. It had 8 square slices and each one was ridiculously heavy... And it was easy to tell why... It mostly consisted of super dense uncooked raw dough. Sicilian pizza should be thick but the dough should be light and airy. Because we were hungry we picked off the toppings and the edge crust, put the crust in the oven until it was crisp, and ate that with the toppings. The only positive here was that the cheese and toppings seemed like quality product. 
The Calzone was truly awful. A Calzone should be a thin crusted popover stuffed 80-85% with ricotta cheese and the rest with mozzarella and your choice of topping. What I received was a soft mushy doughy I-don't-know-what that had a paper thin layer of ricotta as if one spread it like peanut butter in a sandwich. The layer didn't even extend closely to the outer edges of the ""calzone"" so 50% of your bites had no cheese. And this was $15. I've had 50x better calzone here in Vegas for half the price! I wouldn't be surprised if they used a 1/4 cup of ricotta for the entire 16"" calzone. Very very sad and disappointed. It had more mozzarella and sausage/ham than ricotta. Not the way it's supposed to be done, boys. Did I mention the dough was thick, soft, and airy, like a dough sponge and not crisp at all? 
Then came the cannoli...Oy! I picked it up and I already knew what was wrong. It weighed almost nothing... Meaning no filling. It was probably 6-7"" long but had filling extending 1-1.5"" on both sides leaving the entire middle empty. What filling was there tasted old as if it was sitting for a while. The shell tasted stale and was hard. Not worth $1 let alone $4.
I must mention I'm from NYC and so I have a high standard for pizza, calzone and Italian food. So living here in LV I tend to give places a break... I'm aware it's not NY. That said, I've had several experiences with pizzerias here that I'd put up against some NY pizzerias in a heartbeat. I'd have rather had DiGiorno and Hot Pockets. 
For the amount of money I threw away ordering from this place I could've gotten a much better meal elsewhere without having to pick apart my food. 
Not only did I lose $50 I also lost respect for myself in that I didn't call them and ask immediately for a refund! Like I said, as someone who has cooked for a living and worked in pizzerias I take a lot of pride in what I send my guests. If I wouldn't eat it, it doesn't leave the kitchen. If my guests are unhappy I take it very personally. I hope the manager and/or owner here does as well.",6BG-geUq96Q5j_sbG0fqlQ,4,1,1,af7emFTUeoKen3IQtoo_Cw

It was good but def needed paper towels to soak up the grease. Then second slice, for some reason I looked at my crust just to analyze it and what do I see .. a hair : at first I'm like okay maybe my daughters who is a toddler. Nope as I try to pull it off I see it was baked into it! I got sick to my stomach! HAIR NETS PEOPLE COME ON!! I am a germaphobe as is and to see that ugh made my stomach turn beyond belief !

Not the standard wimpy mushrooms barely the size of a quarter. Not the dehydrated, wispy chunks of mystery meat. Not here. They have food-lover sizes of fresh ingredients. And this is all blanketed with a gooey layer of cheese. They are generous with toppings and bake their pies to just the right degree of pizza toastiness. Can't find any fault with the pizzas at all.

For those who expect to be waited on hand and foot, well, you can be expect to wait slightly more than the average for a pizza joint, but I can attest to how very worth it it is. As for dining in, I would not call this place cozy. But they are in the middle of renovating the dining space, so the results remain to be seen. I can safely say that for now, this would be a take out place only for me. 

Overall, this is a small hole in the wall that delivers the goods on getting you a delicious pizza to go. I've already compiled a list of pizzas from their menus I'm eager to try. So, while not a grand dining experience, the pizza is by far and away a Grand Pizza.

P.S. We did try the ""garlic bread"" which was a hoagie with butter and a chunk of pizza. Eek! Stick with the pizza and only the pizza.",1e-YlTcTpYKkCu6d_7kSJQ,4,1,4,HUa-6QaTyUxYqfYLP-cVFQ

I ordered the hot wing pizza - pretty much had no flavor. A few tiny pieces of processed chicken, no hot sauce, and tons of greasy cheese all on an undercooked crust. I was able to save the pizza by putting it back in the oven and adding some actual hot sauce to it but that just barely made it edible. 

Zucchini sticks are of the frozen variety, which I guess I expected although they could at least make sure that they aren't sending over other bits of food from their fryer with the soggy and over fried zucchini.

It started off bad because my order online wasn't honored. The deals that were offered were not correct and thank goodness I called to check on my order 10 minutes after I placed it because the lady told me that I had to be charged more. I changed the pizzas around because of the price. So I paid more and ordered pizzas that my family didn't really want. But the lady on the phone was nice so I just went ahead with the order.

As I was walking out the door with my food the lady showed me another way to order that would be cheaper, which was nice, but why couldn't I have gotten that price to begin with? That was upsetting that I paid extra because of the mix up between the restaurant and the ordering company.

I get the food home and wow. All together I ordered a pepperoni pizza, a pepperoni and sausage pizza, calamari, and a meatball sandwich. Either the meatballs were tiny, or the bread was too big. Not much sauce, but the taste was ok. The fries that came with it were blah. Not crispy or hot, seemed like they have been sitting around. The calamari was super fishy, and I am a seafood person. The pizza was ok. Lots of cheese, which my daughter appreciated so I would go back for a pizza. 

I gave 2 stars because the people were friendly.  I hope they change the online ordering!!

Delivery took an hour and a half long. My sister called to ask when could we expect our delivery. The agent on the line replied with, ""shortly, but you live kinda far..soooooo."" That is something no business should say to patrons. Also considering Grand Pizza offers delivery to our part of the city. finally the pizza arrives and we realize there were only 8 slices for a large pizza! We paid $31.93 for 8 slices.The pizza is an 18"" Buffalo chicken pizza $24.00, $1.00 processing fee (ok sure whatever), Delivery charge  $3.95, and tax fee $2.03.   Seriously can I get at least 12 slices total for that price! Geez! Can I get a satisfying pizza joint? My friend's 8 year old could eat this pizza alone! My son had kids over and he only had two kids and one kid didn't even get a slice! (In my Al Pacino voice). Would be the case if I had kids. 
About 1 hour from the time a family of 6 eats 8 huge slices my sister called Grand pizza aka Grand Italia to express the shenanigans. The agent said the Extra large is 6 more slices bigger and to go ahead and call the manager tomorrow cause there isn't anything they can do (did not like the tone in her voice). She said she is pretty sure the manager will say the same thing. Does she not understand the frustration of waiting a long time, to be told we live to far which its like well decline the delivery if you really do not want to deliver here. How unexceptionally rude. 
Then an hour later Ashley called back to say we will receive 40-50 % off the next order. Just please people pause and think for a second. 
2 stars for the shenanigans! After the call should I change the review? Only because the food is awesome I will give one more star and the effort of fixing the issue LATER when it should have been rectified from the beginning.",pxtwgQezGeBq9pEIVkn-zg,4,1,3,ckQKp9IP__guGfgyEi3X4w

They do not skimp on the quality of their ingredients! The pepperoni here is delicious, just the right amount of fat. They also don't only put 10, they spread the love! The pizza is cooked in an actual pizza oven, none of that conveyor belt crap. Pizza is seriously one of the best I've had.

The tiramisu 4.99 is also quite delectable and the garlic balls 20 for 2.99 are sinful! You can seriously sit there and eat 5 and get full... they're so addicting!

I believe the owner is straight from Italy, when you go in they all look Italian and have those sexy accents. So, that's how you know their food is the real deal! The customer service here is excellent! I always go in looking like a scrub, and they're so nice to me and always smiling! The location is right on Alexander and Rainbow right behind the Rebel gas station. They do have seating inside, which is spacious. 

EAT LOCAL AND COME HERE! The food is amazing, priced adequately, and the guys who work there are cute and so nice!!

4386036,2018-03-29,1,Sm2k1ijcnK17Ro5paN2_qQ,"---- Update 13 April 2018 ----

The Sicilian has been removed from the menu.

Grand Pizza no longer exists on my menu.

I hate to be mean, but that is that.
----


I have grown rather enamored with the 4 item Sicilian. I have only ever ordered for delivery, because if we're going decadent why not go all the way?

The 4 items are, Italian sausage, onion, jalapeño peppers, and basil. I've had a taste for a spicy pizza for quite some time and this combination dials that in just right, though maybe sometimes a spicy sausage might make a welcome addition. 

I have noticed two things, one of which is the reason I am reserving the 5th star for what is otherwise, in my opinion, a solid experience from order to empty box.

1. The pizza has occasionally (I recall 2 instances) arrived arguably-under-cooked. I say arguably because this is a doughy thick pizza and it seemed to be on the edge, but it was something I noticed because I've had this pizza a few times, exactly the same order, and that odd texture stood out to me. This is not the norm but it's something to look out for... if I were eating in I would consider having them toss it back on the fire for another minute or two.

2. This is not completely material but for the record, as Yelp and Eat24 have re-juggled themselves, their menu here on Yelp still shows the Sicilian as item 52, the menu on Eat24 does not show numbers at all, and the Sicilian is not called out specifically (there is something that might be it listed as an 12""x18"" pizza, but who can be sure?).

As I type this I'm awaiting my Sicilian 4 item so I'll cut this short while I prepare for this event...",-hJ9Q0OSYqdOTVBLOMdg7A,1,0,1,3hzhK9SJTgmqxRlXVGkxzA

First thing is first, it's extremely unfortunate that the driver is what ultimately ruined my review because this family does nothing but care about the success of their business, and more importantly the happiness of their customers. 

So, fast forward yesterday, and I receive an email from the manager, asking what had happened. I was at work, so I couldn't reply. Not even an hour later, one of the owner's personally comes to apologize to my job. Now, in today's world, not many will go out of there way to apologize, and much less personally come to someone to do so. 

The gentleman I spoke with, was kind, patient, and very sympathetic. He apologized for all that had happened and asked to make it up to me. I didn't need anything, but the apology, but he insisted. 

Today, he showed up with a HUGE family size pizza, wings, and drinks for my whole office. 

The food was amazing. The cheese gooey. The toppings perfectly baked. The wings were crispy and meaty. The sauces were flavorful and bold. You want a good pizza, give this place a shot. 

Know that they really care about their customers and our satisfaction. This business didn't have to go out of their way to do any of this, as it was just one person that ruined it for me, yet they did. 

Grand Pizza has a grand heart, and my staff and I couldn't be happier to have found our new go to spot.

Needed a late evening fix for an Italian food urge.
Grand Pizza is open til 11pm.
My other half had a Chicken Parmigiana dinner.  Huge plate, comes with a fine house salad, a nice plate of pasta,  And garlic bread.  I had the Lasagna.  A monster sized plate, and of course, the garlic bread. 
The young lady whom took care of us was great, and numerous times came by to see if all was  good.  It was!
We finished with an order of zeppoles to go, and they were delicious as well.
I know where I will be going for my next Italian craving.",WJZy9FbB2K8r1vcoPo4iEw,0,0,4,z1mzOkhrpmDmqCwur47JNg

I get the carry out 1 topping pizza special for $7.95. I really like the not too sweet sauce and the heavy hand on the cheese. I don't like delivery from any place so I can't review that part of the place, but the pizza is always hot and fresh and the wings (while a lil spicy) are always good. The staff is friendly , the food is good, the price is right and the location is perfect for me. I'm looking forward to trying many other dishes on there menu. And I will write another review once that happens. As for now..... Its pizza and wings time.",-EZHCVLCizN6jOGz0UH5Hg,0,1,5,HC_DCqS9rDJpmZ5qi-4H9w

I ordered 2 18 inch pizzas and a 10 piece chicken finger with fries.. let's start with the fingers.. ever had Tyson chicken fingers from the grocery store?? Yep that's them. Just tossed in sauce. And I paid 17$ for them. That's literally 2 and a half bags you can buy yourself at Walmart.. and pour some franks red hot, boom. Better deal. Now, the pizza. Very thinly sliced pepperoni, then cheese was evenly spread, but it just didn't taste that great.. watery sauce.. but hey, loads and loads of GREASE!!!!! Order joeys. Even commercialized, Pizza Hut has more flavor..",CXNoVt7t_25W6lVG9ixxqQ,0,0,3,B65r9QdH9RkiY8FKJ8PbDA

They really loaded the pizza with cheese and toppings. The only thing is that there was not enough sauce on the pizza. But that's an easy fix. I'll just ask for extra sauce next time. The delivery was a little slow but when the food arrived it was hot and fresh. They get all 5 stars from me for making some damn good pizza!,eEwWsmjT6eI9EhWk87Gt3Q,0,0,5,ChZSHvyVQCUBHiS79Ux7ag

The price is unbeatable. I've ordered so many pizzas that tend to ""break the bank"", and 9 times out of 10, it was NOT worth it. This pizza on the other hand. I couldn't stop telling everyone how much I loved it. It has that perfect combination of cheese, sauce, and grease that makes for an authentic pizza. I ordered the pizza last night, and saved the review for this morning to see if the pizza survived the ""day after"" test, and it most definitely did. 

The delivery driver was a tiny bit late, but was EXTREMELY polite and kind. To be honest, you can be 3 hours late, I don't even care with a pizza like this. The driver had everything I had asked for, Parmesan, pepper, ranch (which was spot on), and he even provided me with some plates and napkins. You have no idea how badly I wanted to tip him more, but sadly, all I had was a lose dollar bill and some lose change. 

I will be buying from here again in the near future, maybe even tonight (;",jX4M0TiTWJVwXC9rE-YmMw,2,1,5,kreTTF-FrtwOCAUaww6bfA

After placing my order I got a bit confused on where to look to see what I ordered and how long it would take. After refreshing the app I found out how long it would take until my order was ready. I didn't like how I couldn't see what I ordered though. 

When I got to the restaurant it took a couple of minutes to find an employee to help me. When I explained I ordered online through Yelp she looked confused. Her expression made me worry that my order was never placed. After a few minutes of searching in the back she came back with my order and I was relieved. 

Overall, the pizza and the wings were good. The cheese on the pizza was thicker than I'm used to eating and the crust was a bit harder than I like. But, I would recommend getting one of their specials if you're feeding a small family of five or so.",P0rGN5mDue55uIiAzkrRlw,0,0,3,DJLmVmtO4vyIJkGnkfyECA
