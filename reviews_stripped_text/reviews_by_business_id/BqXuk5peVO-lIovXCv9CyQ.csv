First if all, I will confess to being non-vegetarian, let alone vegan, and I found the dishes here very delicious, with good fresh ingredients and full of flavor. The atmosphere is simple and clean, yet warm and comfortable. I must say the veggie? burger was the best I have ever eaten.the owner came over to check on our enjoyment and to ask if we had any suggestions. More cochinas was the only one I could think of. The combination of fresh, new dishes, generous portions, moderate prices and delicious tastes makes this a ""must try"" for vegans, vegetarians and omnivores alike.",D1mY98fM-TlofNRBJY28dA,1,2,5,zqT914Q_eDsV_M6xQF4kLw

The location is convenient, right off of Fort Apache and near lots of other shopping.

The decor is fun and they have charging stations which is really great for people like me who live on there phones. 

They had these adjustable tables which some might like but I kept accidentally hitting the button and they would rise and lower. I had to unplug the table.

I took some pics of the Crazy falafel but my husband finished his burger before I got a chance to take any photos...

CONS: 100% plant-based is not exactly true if they serve vegetarian food. Because Plant-based REALLY means all food made with plants. Study now shows dairy foods raises the chances of people getting cancer - info from documentary ""Forks Over Knifes"" So I think either this restaurant should remove the 100% plant-based business description or stop serving dairy. I would prefer they stop serving dairy. I only eat at places that ONLY served all vegan food.

1351734,2018-05-14,7,BqXuk5peVO-lIovXCv9CyQ,"That tapioca bread! 

Now that this place has its S together and are not confused what plant based means...literally on their signage...I gave them another chance.
Yes this place is now all vegan. 

Not a fan of faux foods but I wanted to really try this tapioca creation and VERY glad I did. Beef over chicken because anything that smells remotely like chicken (fowl smell) makes me gag, didn't risk it.

My choice was the Beef Tapioca thingy. I chose the meal but it was way too much food for me. 
Also, don't make the mistake I made and try to eat this in your car. The person who placed it in the bag had it sideways so when I opened the foil...quinoa alllll over the universe. No worries, car needs detailed.

If you try and eat it in the car lol. It's messy but soooooooooooo yummy! I was pleasantly surprised. The bread is the start of the show.

People who know me, I can't stand bread. Bread tastes gross, texture is gross and my body just doesn't care for it. This bread thingy is AMAZING!!!!!!! If I could buy a dozen and make my own wraps and stuff I would! 

Another side note, I usually eat oil free. This is not. It's not super oily, but you can tell they sautéed the onions in oil. A little gooey oil action going on. 
The faux beef is scarce and possibly made of TPV? not sure. It was flavorful and just the right amount, very little. 

I haven't tried the quinoa salad. I'm too full. Also if you know me (example: AYCE veggie sushi) I can eat A LOT. So me being full off this tapioca pita is a miracle.

I would like to try their açaí? bowl but I don't like sweets, yes again, I'm a weirdo. 

So second chances are awesome and I'm glad I gave VeggyStreet one!!!!!!",zgV0ZroIF956gw4cul8MHA,11,7,4,iRBJOkPm2-0VGSajj--XtA

1445202,2018-04-07,0,BqXuk5peVO-lIovXCv9CyQ,"Very disappointed. I was really looking forward to trying this place. Staff was cordial, at best. Definitely not friendly or welcoming. I ordered a toasted caprese to go. When I unwrapped it the first thing that hit me was all I could smell was a burnt odor. Sure enough, one side of the bun was burnt and hard as a rock. Inside the sandwich was a spattering of cheese, a single thin slice of tomato and a bunch of mixed greens. The bun was seasoned with dried basil and olive oil. No visual evidence or taste of balsamic. I will give them another shot, because I try not to judge based on just one experience (everyone has a bad day). But if you're going to charge $7.50 for a caprese sandwich, it should at least have a decent amount of tomato and cheese, fresh basil, and some detectable balsamic. This was more like hard burnt bread with oil and mixed greens. What I got was a $3 sandwich - not a $7.50 sandwich.",tlaBwUvcqmwDTRTknTh7Bw,0,0,2,hdhZo8ID48QvAj_qIrFYbw
1476052,2018-01-16,13,BqXuk5peVO-lIovXCv9CyQ,"I've been keeping an eye on Veggy Street via social media ever since their signage went up over the summer. When they opened in September, there was a lot of confusion about whether their food was actually vegan as advertised. It wasn't until December that the restaurant actually confirmed that they were vegan. Not sure what the story is there but the situation kept me away until their Veganuary promotion.  

Clean location, fairly expansive menu. Opted for the vegan burger (made with Beyond Meat products), added vegan cheese (Daiya?), as a combo with fries and a house-made hibiscus tea for $8, which was a great discount from their usual prices ($15?)*. The burger itself was solid and had a passably ""meaty"" mouthfeel and a pink hue favorably compares to some of the dry, grain-based patties I've had elsewhere. It could benefit from some sort of house sauce, too. I do wish they made their own product in house rather than just serving up a frozen and reheated patty- it's why I refuse to patronize businesses that zap a Boca Burger and call themselves a vegan dining destination. I am interested in coming back to try other items, though.

*Speaking of pricing, it's a bit high for the quality of product, even given that they're a niche market. Burgers are regularly ~$10 and it's +$4 to make your order a combo with a side and drink (bottled water and fries?), which is ludicrous. 

I am happy to have more healthy and vegetarian, vegan, etc dining options available, and I do look forward to coming back here, but there are a few things I think they should work on.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,26,15,3,LjEpGmba25R1P8RH5zISWQ

1682362,2018-03-25,0,BqXuk5peVO-lIovXCv9CyQ,"Came here for a quick, light lunch and got just that. We both got the Veggy Eleven (Veggie cheeseburger with fries) and a Cucumber H20 blast. 

The drink was sweet but not too sweet. I like that the didn't overcompensate with sugar. There were mint leaves in it too so that added some extra freshness. 

The burger could legitimately pass as a beef burger. It was even pink on the inside! Served on a pretzel bun with ""cheese"", this is something worth returning for on its own. 

The only thing I have to take a star away for is the service. The cashier/waitress was very nice, but hit me twice with some slight small-business-greed that I didn't appreciate at all. I'm pretty easygoing especially when it comes to small neighborhood business and try not to be too picky but sometimes I can't help it. The French fries the burger comes with are greasy and don't settle well in my stomach. As soon as we completed the order and I finished paying, I pleaded with the employee to trade my fries with a small bed of lettuce and she advised she would need to ring me up for a salad. Not ok. Then she brought us the food, we asked for a side of mayo. After going to the back to ask, she came back to let us know she would have to charge us .54c. 

.54c. For some mayo. 

Either they aren't doing well and need every speck of ingredients to be accounted for, or they're just plain greedy. We came out of our way and paid, tipped well, we're polite...the whole 9. The salad I can excuse but not a side of mayo. That's not the customer service experience your patrons deserve while they pay more for food at your establishment than they would anywhere else in at least a mile radius. 

But don't get me wrong, I'll rant about some mayo all day because it's the principle of the matter, but the food is bomb!!",NZInok33qPu_6B5k2YHb7Q,0,0,4,uh7kod1Z12UiO4SAsVmCsQ

Last time I tried a vegetarian/vegan burger was at Panacea in Boca Park and it was terrible. In their burgers , their patty is mostly just mashed up beans and you can see the corn , quinoa , etc. all that stuff in every bite. At Veggy Street even though they don't make their own vegan patties (they use Beyond Meat products you can find at like Whole Foods) either way , it's fine to me since those patties are pretty bomb. It actually tastes like meat and texture is good. I usually order their ""Veggy Eleven"" which is their vegan cheeseburger and comes w/ side of fries. I actually prefer their regular fries over their parmesan yucca fries since it compliments the taste of their burger more. Pretzel bun is great too instead of the usual type of bun so I hope that never changes. They have so many different options for lunch/dinner but I always end up craving their vegan cheeseburger on that pretzel bun whenever I come here.",qtOCfMTrozmUSHWIcohc6Q,0,0,4,6lYgAgvBY_2K0ElQ98i1DQ

Luckily that wasn't the case at all at veggy street, I honestly was completely fooled by their vegan burger!

I had tried the vegan and veggy burger with a side of their parmesan yucca fries. Both have the vegan burger patty with the only difference being the buns and vegan cheese on the vegan burger. In all honesty, I couldn't tell the difference in the cheese. So if you're looking for a full on healthier option you might as well go all in and get the vegan.

The patty was very juicy and flavorful not needing any extra sauce or ketchup, unless you really prefer to.

The parmesan yucca fries are a little dry but not too bad at all. Preferably I think I would of liked it cut into thinner slices instead of wedges but either way it still had a nice crisp to it. It does make for a decent alternative to a pile of deep fried potatoes if you're looking to watch your cholesterol level.

Staff are also very polite and welcoming informing us of their menu options, description, and suggestions.

I would definitely come back for their vegan burger again, it'll certainly make me feel a lot less guilty after a good gym day.",oJV6f25IK_UeghoFmalPvA,20,17,5,PPwwD0ZTuLxSTapzh_L4Nw

Nice and tender patty nowhere clise to cardboard like veggie burgers. The falafel was perfect. Some of the top notch yucca fries I have had in a while.

My boyfriend enjoyed a cheese veggie burger and said that it tasted better than most Veggies burgers he has had in the past and I enjoyed my pressed ""chicken"" sandwich which had a spicy kick to it but the good kind of spicy kick. But what the falafel!!!!The one item I wanted the most was burnt/over cooked. The falafels were extremely hard and impossible to chew. I wish I would have checked prior to leaving the facility because I probably would have requested new ones. I know they would have been good because the little bit on the inside that wasn't burnt had really good flavor.

To the delusional owners), but would eat here again every once in a while just to support vegetarian/vegan businesses in Vegas. Would have given 4-stars for focusing on vegetarian food but had to deduct an extra point because the whole place smelled like acetone, paint, and floor cleaner. To the owner/management: plz keep your art projects and or potting of plants outdoors, the smell really ruins the dine-in experience, so does the horrible horrible girly high school alternative music you guys play--whatever your personal music preferences are, a business should never play an artist's entire album but hire a professional music/playlist service--it was pure torture eating while listening to YOUR music of choice. Another thing to consider, sweet red apples in water don't go with food at all, might want to stick with Granny Smith apples, or keep it simple with cucumber or lemon. You don't want to be a veggie spot that can't get something as basic as house-made fruit defused water right, eh?",6HceyiJeAxTMreMlpN2Kqw,1,0,3,uZOioZbcC44F420DnhqU5g

I got contradictory answers and an attitude from the girl behind the counter. I asked to speak to the owner or chef and they just walked away. After hearing another couple complain of something similar, I decided to walk out and didn't take a chance ordering any food.

The owner George is a friendly man who goes out of his way to make my experiences the most enjoyable. I'm inspired by his passion about healthy food and love to hear the stories about how and where his products are being sourced. I am in love with the standard veggy burger as it has a  similar texture to a regular burger which makes it an exciting option for curious carnivores willing to explore veggy options. The special sauce on it is fantastic I always get a side for my fries or extra for the burger. I also tried the ""chicken"" tapioca and enjoyed that as well. George explained the process of how he makes the wrap and is experimenting with a spinach based version of this wrap which I can't wait to try. Although I'm moving to the east side soon I will make sure to make a trip out to Veggy Street whenever I can, because, it's the good! Highly Recommender by a snobby spoiled NYC Native should be enough to give it try!

If your looking it up on yelp now- read no more and just go! LIKE NOW! It is seriously life changing. I am so so so happy I found them. 

I was apart from my carnivorous family so I decided to treat myself to a vegan bite out! BOY AM I GLAD I DID! 

I than did what we all do. I pulled out my handy iPhone, opened up yelp, and searched ""vegan food."" 
FIRST on the list.... Veggy Street! So I punched it in my gps and went on my way!  As I walked into the restaurant I was greeted with a big beautiful smile and an even warmer greeting! I got to talking to the gentleman and he quickly learned this was my first visit. He gave me a very delicious  ""welcome"" energy/ protein ball that made me feel like I was cheating by having dessert before dinner. Yum! 

I ordered the 11.11 deal and waited for only a few short moments. Before I knew it- my cheese burger and fries were wrapped up in a bag and ready to go! I thanked the awesome staff and went on my way! 

I hopped on the road and began to unwrap my burger. It was dark so I was not able to see what I was eating. I took my first bite and I'm pretty sure I heard the vegan angels sing in beautiful harmony. I got lost in that first bite. It was honestly the most delicious vegan burger I've ever encountered. As I took my second bite, I had to ask myself if what I was eating was actually  plant based? I had to turn the light on, look down, and remind myself that I had purchased it from Veggy Street. Of course it was plant based. From that point on I guiltlessly devoured my burger. When I arrived to my destination I called every single vegetarian/vegan friend to share the holy grail of a vegan burger that I had just found. YOU GUYS... ITS THAT GOOD! 

Everything about that burger was excellent. Definitely not your average Veggy partty! It's not beany, and it has great texture. (Which I loved) It was unlike any vegan burger I've ever had. I loved that the patty and cheese were both free of soy. Normally I'm not a huge fan of vegan cheese- but THIS cheese that they use was fantastic 
I would put money on it that if I were to bring these burgers back to my meat eating family- they would have no idea that what they were eating vegan burgers. 

I'm practically drooling now thinking about how delicious this place is. I CAN NOT WAIT to go back. I especially can't wait to take my meat loving family and show them that vegan food is Bomb!",nDynpOP644nCR9CPYz6ecQ,6,4,5,1-3tnPBRmjo7IFU8ahf3eg

Anywho the problem I really had was when I got my food I asked if they had a ranch. The cashier that took my order said no. I asked if there were any other sauces and she said yes. I asked what was in this other sauce and she replied, ""I'm not sure"". She didn't even offer to find out. Seeing how this is her job, she needs to know the product. 

Other than that incident, cool spot. They also have 2 outside tables.",0yTIzVZAQw7DiyzqSKdn_w,0,0,4,N_FV9tE9uEjAS2w1WdceCQ

The ""cheeseburger"" is incredible.  I get it with the gluten free bun, which is a tapioca bun. I've never had a GF bun like that, but it is so good and contributes to the flavor (which is tough for a GF bun! Usually they are flavorless and just fall apart by bite two.) the yucca fries are also so good, and seasoned so perfectly.",zNICefkUA73yE64h0fPfBQ,0,0,5,ZVI0kdZzCTWe3cy4NK4cUA

The patty has a scrumptious flame broiled flavor,cheese has a delicious American cheddar taste and topped off with crisp lettuce and tomato. The pretzel bun ties all this deliciousness together beautifully. I highly recommend the Veggy cheeseburger. Do yourself a favor and head over to Veggy Street right now and feast on One for yourself. 

   I also tried a Soda called Guarana Antarctica. I can't quite put my finger on the flavor but the logo has 2 cherries on the can so that's the flavor I think I was tasting. If you like sugary drinks like I do I think you'll like this one too. 

  I really like the dining room as well. Clean, crisp and comfortable. All tables have 3 built in USB ports.....very convenient. 

  Last but not least the staff were all friendly , pleasant and helpful. Can't wait to return and try more delicious food.",DYNHc9IxYwdJuGuC4bvpAw,4,2,5,xP-JhGSNDBc94F4_nri3Eg

I ordered the veggie burger with the vegan cheese option. It came out and I expected it to be like grainy and veggie patty like consistency, but i was wrong. It tasted just like a burger!!! It was amazing!

I would definitely come back and try it again, for less than $10 and if you check in you get a truffle, which wasn't my favorite part. It tasted too grainy and not sweet at all, but I would definitely come back and try other options.",bydI3xl_ZpDZRbAQMAPITQ,5,2,4,coP0wPdO_3hOkEs4XAfgqg

First of all I'm very picky with my falafel and this was spot on. Seasoned perfectly not to greasy and not mushy. The veggie mix on the sandwich was such a treat had a bit of a kick which I like. My only thoughts would be to take the avocado out but that's just my preference. Also got the protein truffles which are out of this world good.I got the zombie drink as well. It is good but I make my own smoothies so this is a little treat but I like my combos biased of course . Definitely check them out you won't regret it.

She even ate the grilled onions!!! I loved it too, so far I'm a big fan!

Took my very traditional and conventional eater grandma here. She's old school. Didn't tell her what kind of food it was, just asked if she wanted a burger or cheeseburger. She wanted no cheese, so burger. I got the cheeseburger with yucca fries (YUMMMO!!).  Waited patiently for her to finish to break the news that she had just eaten a meatless burger. She couldn't believe it. Then we had their awesome falafel and protein balls. Got an açaí bowl to go and cannot wait to go back.
