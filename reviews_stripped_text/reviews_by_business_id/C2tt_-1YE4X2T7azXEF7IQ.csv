No waiting it line to order how great is that. Just bought one yesterday and it is very good as always. They have great prices on everything at the food court.. I am single,and I buy quite a bit of frozen food so much is wrapped individually I just take one out at  a time or just shake out what I need, so much cheaper than grocery stores especially the product, prices you cant beat.",1PBd4DnHYeE9EjIyBX-T6Q,2,0,5,LGU-Xg1DK6j4n8oXniQovg

Was told by cashier it would be 10-15 minutes. Set timer on phone for 15 minutes, had teenaged son to check on order 12 minutes in. He came back to wait area said lady cashier said it would be 25 minutes but she did not sound too sure.

After 3 more minutes when 15minute timer went off. I spoke to another cashier in food court and showed her my paid receipt and asked how much longer. She went back to where the pizza orders were and spoke to some guy and came back and said order was never processed and that I was suppose to let them know I wanted them to start making my pizza. Go figure, I thought me paying for and ordering the pizza was indication I wanted them to make pizzas. 

I was then told it would be another 15 or 20 minutes for them to make the pizza. I set my timer again, and went to the original cashier who said that it would be 10-15 minutes. He had this stunned look on his face, until his assistant told him very quietly you have to let them know to make the pizza. He apologized and then tried say it was up to me to let the food court know I wanted them to make pizza I had paid for. 

Then when the 15 timer went off again, we went to check on pizza; our pizzas were sitting their waiting, you would think they would have hand delivered after the numerous mixups when they were ready.

I have ordered pizzas before at other Costco locations without all of this confusion. I won't be using this location's food court - #737 again!",uAk2xxwgFIMgaS4Yl1D6Zw,0,0,1,7uEppOimRhPG4bRaLE_3Jg

This Costco is convenient to my home, and the people behind the food counter are friendly, courteous, and helpful. Been doing the hot dog thing for years; the Food Court team at the Decatur Costco does a great job of waiting on customers, preparing the food (always hot, fresh, and ready), and even on busy days you are always greeted with a smile.

I must say it can get pretty busy, but it's well worth the wait. I really only have one thing to add and its that they should have the hot dog buns the same size as the hot dogs because the dogs are way too big for the bun. The pizza is great for a really nice price and the pull pork sandwich is really out of this world. The seating can be challenging if you've got a grocery cart with you and it's always really crowded so we'll sometimes park the cart in a place where we can see it at all times or just take the food to the car and eat it there. The way this food court is busy all the time is testament to how good and great a deal it is.",cnab2lH02dtnFeh-eQP-sg,2,0,5,9Ug6R7O1Xk3w2QO9McToAg

Only complaint is they need to clean their tables more often... I'm sure it's hard because so many people are moving in and out. And it becomes near impossible to park your cart and the seating area...... but it's all good. Can't beat the price. Churros are yummy, pizza is bomb, chicken bakes are good, and the Polish dog combo can't be beat. The ice is like the small chunky ice but bigger so it's log like ice? I like it. Pepsi products for beverages too. All IN all, It's great to eat for your before Costco fuel up OR the after burner.... that is if you don't get too full from the samples around the store",bGBp3ptS25gzxmFhVfB7WA,1,1,4,pdUZ5ABoMdwO6S3c6O99DA

Every time I shop here at Costco, more often then not, I end up eating at the food court. So of course I always end up looking to check in and nada, zip, zilch, nothing! So now for all of you that are reading this, HOORAY! You can check in now! Maybe it will get you some type of badge.

As everybody knows, the Costco Food Court has some of the best tasting food at prices that everybody loves! Let's see, you got your choice of either a Polish or All American Hot Dog that comes with a drink for $1.50! Can I get an AMEN! A Chicken Bake for $2.99, a Toasted Ciabatta Turkey Sandwich for $3.99, and some other items that catch your eye as well like a huge slice of either Cheese, Pepperoni, or Combination pizza for umm......damn I cant remember cuz I only order it for my kids.

Anyways, you guys get what im saying. They have something for everybody and its not too hard on your wallet. I say the price you pay for the membership alone is worth it just for the food court!

The only downfall that irks me is that they only take cash. You would think that since you can pay with either debit or American Express at the front registers that these guys would have the same set up. NOT! Although you can pay for whatever you wanna get at the food court at the front registers is a little better, that still is kind of a hassle.

In the end, I have yet to have a bad experience with the service and food every time I eat here. Imagine a Costco thats 24 hours. Now THATS something to behold! It IS Vegas so you never know. In the meantime, I can always go for a hot dog or turkey sandwich.",0FMte0z-repSVWSJ_BaQTg,6,2,4,hOfa5yKVSvKe_cl9hGzXiA

I asked for one, but there lady putting the stuff in my cart looked at me and said ""we're out sweetie"", as I'm staring at a cart full one lane over to her. So I walked over and grabbed box, so she could put the stuff in it (it was raining outside and did not feel like putting stuff in the box on my own with the rain. So, I start talking to the cashier, pay and turn around to see the damn box set ON TOP of my cart.... EMPTY! I'm in awe!

3403334,2014-12-28,1,C2tt_-1YE4X2T7azXEF7IQ,"As opposed to southern CA locations, this place takes American Express. Like the branch in Tustin, CA, they use a line, but it is invisibly designated with yellow tape on the floor. Fortunately, during my visit, there was no confusion. At least it's better than the Irvine, CA branch.

The staff was nice and gave us our food while paying with no issue even though we paid with American Express. They were nice enough to explain that they dont sell those ice cream bars anymore. Functionally, it is no different than  other branches with the exception of the ability to pay with American Express.",Z9rSlTj3pJr2eI7eqWIlZQ,1,1,4,CITPXlcXHVS35EWRySvTqQ

The people working have always been friendly and great about the large orders I've placed for parties. Whole pizzas are 18 inches, priced at $9.95 and you can choose from cheese, combo or pepperoni. I have asked for just sausage on a whole pizza before and since the whole ones are made to order they didn't mind customizing the pie with the toppings of my choice, so just let them know when ordering a whole pizza what you'd like on it. My hubby likes the hot dogs and I do as well from time to time like one with mustard and sauerkraut, both of which are options over by the condiments section where you can dress your dog. The hot dogs are only $1.50 and come with a 20 ounce (free refills) drink. Churros for a buck, sandwiches and the very berry sundae are also offered. It's nice that after all of these years with the price of everything going up that Costco still offers cheap and tasty eats in their food court.",Fv0e9RIV9jw5TX3ctA1WbA,50,52,4,yL9-78_Ixc51Z0rn0ghXKw

You should ask for the pizza to be well done with extra cheese and extra sauce! They will do that for free.  Also don't ask for them to cut the pizza in squares....that is one thing they don't know how to do which is so disappointing and baffling that they can't do this!  

So I ask for it to be uncut.  The other food does not look appetizing at all so I won't ever buy it.  The pizza is decent given that Las Vegas has no good pizza places around in the Northwest.  

Don't forget you can call in an order which is super nice and they will have it ready for you when you arrive! 

Of note... when I did call in a pizza, they person commented on how my ethnic name was ""weird sounding...""  I did not appreciate that.",Ptv3b4b_nbpF0SlTWlUdWg,0,0,4,oqiI5v8P6ozSoBlVsK5F9Q
