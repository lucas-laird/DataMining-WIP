147911,2017-04-02,0,EwxhzR-VghhMsRObXLMitw,We must have gone on the wrong day!  We read all the reviews and were very excited about good diner food. Our food was below average. The eggs tasted like someone spilled flour on them. The side potatoes had no seasoning--no salt. No pepper. Bland.  Corned beef hash is from a can. The cinnamon roll seemed a few days old then reheated in the microwave.  The biscuits and gravy were ok but lacked meat in the gravy. The sour dough toast tasted more like a dried out crouton. The waitresses were pleasant and the bacon was crispy.,KIDzHhZvKZkelmVTc2pGWQ,0,0,2,jTBIQw204eOwy-YjmKOYUA

I've really ever only been to Lou's for breakfast, but man do they know how to make breakfast.  The waitresses are usually quite prompt with greetingsand they almost immediately take your drink order and offer you a menu.

I am a big time breakfast eater and Lou's really make my belly feel all warm inside.  I don't have a favorite item on the menu, but I have probably tried them all.  I suppose you can't go wrong with biscuits and gravy.  I'm talking about real fresh buttermilk biscuits and homemade brown gravy underneath a some fresh scrambled eggs and cheese and you're in heaven.

A few weeks back I decided every time I have to be at the new place to meet a contractor, after the meeting i'll hit a breakfast place.

It's been ages since I've been to Lou's so I decided to include it on my breakfast place list.

Place looks exactly like it did when I tried it over 4 years ago.  I believe the cook was the same ( is it Lou ? ) 

Ordered ham steak, eggs o/e, rye toast.  I believe it was $8.  I expected a lower price given low rent district, presumably low overhead given nothing has changed in the place in over 4 years, so maybe the serving size is ala hash house a go go , uhhhhh, that's a negatory

Food was average - a little too much oil puddling on the eggs but not a big deal given the grease in the hash browns.

BF and I sat at the bar and were helped by a sweet older lady. We sat right next to an amazing-looking butter pecan cake, but chose not to try it this visit. I'm slightly regretting it now, since it looked and sounded amazing, but I can't do sugar that early in the morning.

Bar was set with plenty of local papers to browse through, which we did after placing our orders: the chili cheese omelet with a side of homefries (as per so many recommendations here on Yelp!) and the lunch special of the day (available even at bfast hours!) of tuna sandwich and chicken noodle soup. 

Service was friendly and attentive without overbearing, which is a careful balance when sitting at the bar anywhere, and food was out quick. Omelet was oozing with melted American cheese, and the homefries were on the plain side but had a good crispiness to them- the side mixed well with the omelet and chili sauce.
The tuna sandwich was very basic but nothing to complain about; the soup was downright delicious with noodles that tasted homemade and a broth that was complex and seemed to have been cooked down for a long time.

All the food had a good homecooked taste to it, and it was a nice laid-back morning with my guy and the paper. What more can I ask for that early on a Sunday?",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,4,2,3,mE-QeyxyKP3u9Up-sy6Vyw

Came in for breakfast on a Friday morning and our group was initially set upon by obvious regulars poking in good fun at us.

The waitress was very friendly and explained away whatever question was fired off at her by the group.  For the remainder of our meal she never let the coffee run empty or cold.

We all ordered something that had gravy poured on it.  Not brown gravy but the southern kind that sticks to the ribs.  A field test was conducted and a utensil was inserted into said gravy and then inverted where it seemed to defy gravity by clinging to the implement.

My meal of choice was ""The Haystack.""  It was a bed of hash browns, eggs, cheese smothered above goodness.  For added stress on the arteries two pieces of bacon were placed on each side.

So filling was the meal, lunch or anything else was not required the rest of the day.",HJj82f-csBI7jjgenwqhvw,5,2,5,iHlVnDuKR0-1jcLgVHDlbA

My experience was disappointing, particularly because I chose this place after visiting Yelp to research good diners in town. First of all, when you walk in, it looks like they chose someone's grandmother with tacky taste to decorate the place. Secondly, the energy in there feels dead, even when the diner is filled with patrons. Thirdly, the drinks we were served tasted like they've traveled through moldy pipes. Fourthly, it's located in a weird place. And lastly (and most importantly) the breakfast we ate tasted like someone who doesn't cook, cooked it. The meal alone was a 2/5. Honestly, my mother could have cooked us a better breakfast. I give it an overall 3/5 because at least they're trying.",r7kCDE7-ZBugvazHlsktWA,0,0,3,ef5F6ZjOts5h_5Q74vBcSw

I am a local resident who has been coming here a couple-few times a year for 15 years. The food is very good and always comes out hot. Special requests are greeted with, ""We'll be happy to do that."" The service is outstanding and friendly. And... the check is always reasonable.

(Note:  Brian, the new owner, took over from the original owner, Lou, not long ago. As a customer who loves Lou's just the way it was, I was happy to see that Brian didn't change much -- and the things that changed were for the better. Like...

1516269,2014-12-02,0,EwxhzR-VghhMsRObXLMitw,"Fun, old school diner. Vintage, retro signs, kitchen gear and decor hang around the seating area, which could use another upgrade, but it does add to the charm. We enjoyed the food and the experience, but it might be just a bit too old school for us. There is nothing wrong with kicking the cooking skills up a notch after all these years but they seem to still be doing okay, so what the hell. I doubt it we will be back though. 

Worth stopping in to check out and maybe find an old favorite like mom or grandma made, or to invoke some memories of family times.  

The family member servers were pleasant but clearly had no problem talking about new customers after they left, which I sadly overheard. It did leave a bad taste in my mouth, which the food could not cover up. 

There are many things they could do that would build up their check sales also. Like asking customers if they would like dessert instead of dropping the bill on the table five minutes after their food is delivered. (Pet Peeve) . I was looking forward to a slice of the chocolate cake advertised on the board and was never asked if I wanted anything else.

What did I have two years ago?  A crisp tuna melt. And a chocolate milkshake. All tasty. 

The food at Lou's is what you can make at home. Standard eggs, pancakes, cakes, sausage, grilled cheese, soup, French toast, you name it. So you're not paying for any outrageous culinary experience, but more for the comfort of home. And to escape the chain race.

The die chose Lou's diner for breakfast.    We were a little concerned due to the area, its not the best in town and quite a drive from where we live in Enterprise but the die chose and you cant refuse an adventure!

We seated ourselves which I liked, a clean and comfortable booth and surveyed the place, memorbillia from the 50's and beyond, an old radio/tape player jukebox like the one my mom used to own, the plastic container where old fashioned diners used to (and still do here) put cake slices to entice customers...so neat!

Told the waitress Linda that we were new and she was excited to have us and make us regulars which I can say from this experience we will be going back SOON.    

The die instructed me to get a drink of my choice so I got a pepsi and the die wanted my ex to try a breakfast of the die's choice, it chose eggs and potatoes w/toast and ham, which we took home the ham for the dog once my ex took a mandatory bite.     

The food was excellent, the service was excellent, this place really should have 5 stars--oh one thing my ex said though, they should play old music on the radio, Nightranger was playing, need some old stuff, Elvis, Shangri Las, Del Shannon, etc...

I forgot the jelly!    Cherry jelly!    They have other flavors too, mixed berry is heaven as well and Strawberry!   Didnt try the other flavor and I dont remember what it was.

Over the years I've tried the eggs, omelets, chicken fried steak, oatmeal, bagel and fruit combos, but the real stand-out is their skillet breakfast. They also offer grits in lieu of potatoes.

The other breakfasts are truly average, but the skillet is loaded with hash browns, your choice of meat, (your choice of anything else actually - onions, peppers etc) loaded with cheese and topped with eggs any style. 

Lou's probably rates 3* but I'm bumping it up one because it's the best skillet I've found thus far in Vegas (and also I see my priest in there occasionally - don't know why that influences me, but for some reason it does).",-HAHTQeOzHX5TCDb7qs9Yw,3,1,4,C2_uVjc8anE_H1e5iXpB1Q

And when you think you are done, they have a cinnamon roll that is worthy of being on a page by itself.

One of the reasons that I give Lou's 5 starts is because they have ""old fashioned"", no frills, down home eats .... Things like Creamed Chipped Beef which most people out here don't even know about.  

Everything at Lou's is made from scratch.  They are open limited hours - like 6am to 2pm and are closed on Sundays and maybe Mondays (I can't remember).  Lunch specials are about $6.99 and they include salad or soup - you really can't beat it.

I normally come here on the weekends for cream chipped beef - something my mom always made but for whatever reason - it's damn near impossible to find the proper dried beef out here. 

In addition to the creamed chipped beef - we've also ordered french toast, various sandwiches from tuna melts to clubs and I've also had their home made New England clam chowder and chicken n' dumplings.  You seriously CANNOT beat $7.99 for a big ole' bowl of chicken n' dumplings and a cup of clam chowder.  The claim chowder is seriously one of the best chowders that I've had in Vegas.
 
The owners are a very friendly husband and wife who are often seen sitting in their ""office"" (a booth in the back of the restaurant) and the staff is ALWAYS friendly.  The male half of the couple does all of the baking and he makes some GREAT pie as well as some moist as chocolate layer cake.",Zemr8otoe_xhutAI62rWqQ,4,3,5,oSrO-JH_m3v0RVwpAwhVSw

It's a small joint so I wouldn't recommend going with a big party to this dinner maybe 5 or 6 people max. The prices are great, you get some good food for cheap which is a lot better than some of the place around town that charge more but the food is mediocre. In my opinion stay away from the potatoes that are cut up, I believe they call them hash fries, because they were most definitely under season and had a bland taste. Everything else was good I had the breakfast skillet with sausage and bacon, I will be getting it with hash browns next time. The pancakes where great my son was in love he ate all of his plus he had some of mine as well. The staff is friendly and always around when you need them, but not to the point where you can't enjoy your meal. Also take a look around while your there check out this place personality, you just might be amazed.

It is a seat yourself type of place so if you are going I would get there early. They close at 3 seeing as how they only serve breakfast and lunch, with breakfast being all day. Hope you enjoy a good meal here. I would recommend this place to someone who likes small dinners with corky decorations and is a chain restaurant.",_GVfHFESIDKYO-WX3332ig,6,2,4,f2Bz8E4pOjS_FJEemfRggQ

I got the special of the day- Strawberry Stuffed French Toast with a side of home fries, and my wife ordered the Pan San (pancakes with eggs, meat).

The pancakes were fluffy and soft (not rubbery or dense like Ihops), and the strawberry stuffed French toast was seriously delicious. I couldn't stop eating it. The sausage links served on the side were massive and delicious, the eggs were cooked to perfection.

When I got to the restaurant to pick up the orders no one seemed to know that they are on Yelp until a woman said oh yeah the big order and seemed to be bothered by it. She than told me that she just wrote the order up and it will be sometime, I asked her OK about how long she walked over to the cooks came back and said yeah so that will take sometime, I had to then guess as to how long the wait would be and said so 15 mins and she said no it shouldn't be that long, I told her that the yelp app said that it would be ready by 110pm,. she then seemed really bothered and asked me, now why would it say something like that, I told her I didnt know but I can show her the confirmation, she walked away, I then took a seat anywhere because I wasn't offered to sit as I wait for my order i put in over 20mins ago and the yelp app said that it would be ready at 110pm. I sat there for 5 mins when she brought my food to me, I thanked her a few times and she never responded to me. I get back to my office and realized that one of our orders was missing and the turkey sandwich did not have Bacon on it like described in the menu on yelp so called the restaurant to notify them of the error and they said the order that was missing was not on the order, I then said it was and they said wait yep it is and to come and it will be ready in 2 mins, I went over and got the order and they gave me the bacon for the sandwich, then the lady told me that she gave us the turkey sandwich not the turkey club, and expanded to me what the club was and why the bacon was not on it. I will never order from here again which it isn't because the food was bad the food was actually pretty good, it was the way the waitress made me feel and wanted to argue her point to me instead of stepping back to listen to me and my concerns, she wanted to argue the missing meal and the sandwich why it didnt have the bacon.

The Good.  Nice atmosphere. A throwback to years long gone. The waitresses are helpful,  and few are actually walking talking stereotypes of a stereotypical 50 's and 60's era diner. Opinionated older women that roll their eyes a lot when commenting on current events. Lot's of ""color commentary "". I thought I'd stepped back in time,  I choose to put this in the ""good "" category,  but someone else might not dig it. The food portions are MASSIVE. Not necessarily flavorful - but humongous. The prices are more than fair,  the cost of a meal is *cheap *.
The Bad. AND The Ugly.  I ordered the Chicken Fried Steak. With O 'Brien potatoes,  scrambled eggs, and toast. With gravy.  The gravy was all but tasteless white goo. Pretty generic. Thank God for the salt & pepper. The chicken fried steak 's breading was like kevlar. The steak itself was done in most parts - very pink in other parts. All in All,  I would not go back.

3511028,2016-01-18,0,EwxhzR-VghhMsRObXLMitw,"I am a huge proponent of shopping locally, and this includes my quests for good food in hidden away places.  This is why stumbling across (OK stumbling isn't quite right, Google Maps helped and I won't eat breakfast on the strip) this gem of a greasy spoon.  I say hidden because it is off Decatur snuggled in behind a Taco Bell.

When I first walked in the door I was warmly greeted and took a seat at the counter, which is my favorite spot when dining alone.  My waitress' name was Renee who greeted me with hot coffee and a menu and suggested that I make sure to read the history of the joint on the back of the menu; which kicked off my sense of nostalgia because I love stuff like that.

I ordered my staple of eggs over easy, hash browns with white toast and the ham steak.  my order came out perfect (so many places overcook the eggs) and it was delicious.  In fact there was more food than I knew what to do with and this from a guy who is 6' 3"" and clocking in at 218 lbs.

If I had any room left, I would have had a slice of that pink double layer cake that was so high that it took two people to slice a piece and juggle it in one piece onto a plate for a customer.  I am still thinking about that cake 24 hours later.

So back to the history of the joint.  Lou's diner has changed hands a couple of times over the many decades and has remained in some way or fashion in the family of the original owners.  Until this last December.  This is when a new couple (I am so sorry I totally forgot their names, but they were so nice) just starting out their lives together bought the joint.

When a place I like changes hands, it usually suffers an identity crisis as the new owners try to put their own stamp on it and make it better.  THANKFULLY, this couple understand what Lou's is and who their customers are....  And have kept it the way it should be.

That hidden away gem, that serves great food in a setting that I will be visiting again and again when I come back into town.",mXq7WTay0s9p5YVMyhPFHQ,0,0,5,8iO3c9H0AopzxmTkG8sxQQ

I like the waitresses because they're all welcoming & knowlegeable about the menu.
The food was EXCELLENT the prices were decent for the amount of food you get.
They make there own jelly & ask you what kind you want....it's so yummy you must try!
The owner Brian makes it a point to say hello & what I like about him is he actually walked to all the tables to see & make sure everyone was happy.....you rarely see that now at days, I felt very comfortable that he took the time to come up to my husband & I talk to us & asked us about our honest opinions about the food & service he's pretty awesome even shaking my husband's hand before we left.

3966781,2013-06-05,4,EwxhzR-VghhMsRObXLMitw,"This is a place that could be straight from Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives.  I was meeting friends for breakfast this morning but it fell through and I didn't get the memo.  After sending a text and finding out we weren't meeting, I searched the Yelp app for breakfasts restaurants and this was one of them that came up.  Off I was.

I was going south on Decatur and drove right on by when I noticed the blue symbol on my map was going away from Lou's.  I made a u-turn on a side street and started north on Decatur and there it was, tucked in a small strip mall removed some from Decatur and not having much curb notice.

When I went in, the first thing I noticed was the large amount of bric-a-brac in the restaurant most of it related to kitchens both commercial and home.  One thing that caught my eye was a box from my first food processor, a Veg-O-Matic.  It made me smile because I realized how old it was and therefore me.

My server, Patty, was to my table almost before I sat down (the sign says to seat yourself) and she was back quickly with coffee, a glass of ice water, and a menu.  After looking at the menu for awhile and checking the specials board, I ordered their chili and cheese omelette.  I had my choice of a couple of kinds of potatoes but I went with grits.  I also ordered rye toast.

Within a short time, my breakfast was delivered.  Everything was very good.  Patty asked if I wanted any hot sauce other than the Tabasco that was on the table and I asked for Cholula.  There was a nice container of butter with the grits and I let it melt and mixed it around with the grits.

Service was excellent!  Patty was back often to refill my coffee and it was a pleasant breakfast.  Since I was wearing a Syracuse t-shirt so close to the freeway, Patty assumed I was from out of town and she asked where I was from.  When I said Las Vegas, she asked how I found Lou's.  When I said, ""Yelp,"" she asked, ""What's Yelp!""  I explained briefly and shower her the app and she got the idea.  She was interested to know I'd be rating Lou's before the day was done.  

One last thing--there's a cardboard sign hanging on strings that says ""Triple Chocolate Cake"" and it has three arrows pointing to a cake holder on the counter.  I couldn't resist.  I bought a piece to bring home and have for dessert tonight.  I'm sure it will be just as good as breakfast!  This is a good breakfast spot.  The hiking group may rue their snubbing of me!

Addendum:  The chocolate cake was excellent!",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,8,5,4,_diQsYCzuxGIVTNAGbG6Cw

4051444,2017-03-16,7,EwxhzR-VghhMsRObXLMitw,"I found Lou's Diner by accident.  I was in their parking lot to answer an e-mail, starving, and noticed their sign.  I pulled up my Yelp app, read a few of my Yelp friend's reviews, and made up my mind that I'm having eggs for lunch.  I walked in and it wasn't busy at all.  I sat myself and was a little concerned that the service would take a while since no one noticed me walking in.  Within 10 minutes, one of the waitresses attended to me and gave me a menu.  Their menu is mainly a traditional American breakfast (i.e. omelets, sandwiches, burgers, soups, etc.).  I kept my meal simple and had their 3 egg cheese omelet, 4 slices of bacon, well done extra crispy hash browns, and some toast.  This breakfast combo was very affordable at only $8.  I also added a cup of their homemade chili, which ended up being the highlight of my entire meal.  The chili has a bit of a kick, hearty, and had enough meat to satisfy my protein needs.  A cup of their chili is good enough to make me a repeat customer. If I had one gripe, it's the cheese in their omelets.  I prefer shredded cheese in my omelets, not sliced cheese. Lou's Diner was able to add shredded cheese to my chili.  Why couldn't they do this for their omelets? In the future, I'll request it.  It never hurts to ask, right?

This diner has been around a very long time.  It's nice to see businesses from the 60's still thriving.  It's also obvious that Lou's has its share of regulars.  The service was great and the price per dish is better than most.  I'm sure that I will be returning soon, especially if I'm craving their chili.",y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQ,13,13,4,McMIm2hVg08_wr4htzYo-Q

He informed us the only changes he made were to use social media to advertise and the addition of wifi-- he doesn't plan to change anything else.

This has definitely been around long enough, 40 years and probably some of the old folks that are a majority of their patrons, have been regulars since this diners heyday. 

When you walk in, it feels dated in that way your grandparents would be. Lots of knick knacks on the walls and photos. The food is no frills type American diner fare, and cheap with pretty much everything under $10. My one thing is that the menu isn't really descriptive and while you wouldn't need a explanation for a tuna melt some things I would like to know. I could ask the waitress, but there was only one and she was running around so I felt I may be wasting her time. 

I went with a chicken fried steak since lately I've been in a mood for it. It was decent as far as they go. I can see why people like theirs here, but it's not my favorite in town. 

The BF got chicken and dumplings that was on the specials board. It comes with soup or salad and he got the clam chowder. The clam chowder was standard and decent. The chicken and dumplings was homemade and plentiful, dumplings really fluffy. I wish it had a bit of veggies in it, but otherwise it was good. 

It was solid, but nothing wow-ing really. 

I heard they may have homemade pastries pie here, but apparently they don't anymore really do that. Ah, boo.

Service was more than adequate, about what you'd expect from a place that could've been pulled right from a 70's sitcom.  Lots of colorful characters enjoying their Sunday lunches, old regulars being sassed by the staff.

Why not 5 stars?  Well, our side salads were drenched in watery ranch dressing causing them to be more of a very odd cold soup of iceberg, tomatoes, cucumbers and yes...beet slices (?!).  Not inedible by any means, and maybe the institutional ranch dressing mix (this is NOT a slight...I actually love institutional ranch) was running low.  But unusual.  I had the New York Strip steak sandwich, which was functionally a slab of meat on two pieces of toast.

However, it was a FANTASTICALLY prepared slab of meat.  Perfectly cooked medium rare, perfectly seasoned.  Tender, juicy...honestly the best steak I've had in years.

Today I met my wife and daughter there for breakfast. I didn't recognize the waitresses, which is no big deal. I waited for a much longer time than necessary for them to just ask me what I was drinking. We ordered our food and waited, and waited, and waited, and waited some more. People all around us were getting their food. People that showed up well after we ordered. After waiting for over 45 min, my wife, daughter and I left hungry and frustrated.

Located on Decatur and feeding locals for decades under the watchful eye of its eponymous owner, Lou's Diner is the sort of place one could drive by one hundred times without even a second thought, and yet with prices a fraction of those just a few miles east plus the sort of old-timey service guaranteed to leave a smile on every face the spacious spot is perhaps the very definition of diamond in the rough.

Certainly not upscale, and not exactly sporting much curb appeal in the back of a complex near Arizona Charlies and the Charleston Antique Mall, a visit to Lou's Diner is the sort that starts with a bit of skepticism about what will be found inside, but greeted with warm smiles and walls decorated with every sort of nick-knack imaginable the scene unfolds much like any similar spot in middle America, though in this case several-fold cleaner with a specials board complimenting a well-culled menu of breakfasts, soups, sandwiches, and more.

Seating perhaps sixty, and soon to reach half-capacity about thirty minutes after a 6:45am arrival, it was after short perusal that decisions were made from the all-day options, and with jokes made that ""you must real hungry"" from the waitress it was with the second of about thirty coffee warm-ups that she departed, a curious Lou and her spouse stopping by inquisitively to ask why pictures were being taken before offering to lead me around the and show off the map of where all their visitors had come from - the wall of mismatched mugs belonging to ""regulars"" an appropriate amenity as nearly every other diner was greeted by name by the staff nearly the moment they opened the front door.

Ordering with a request for items to be brought as ready it would not be long before the Housemade Cinnamon Roll arrived beneath a ladle of of sweetened cream cheese, and with a core rife with cinnamon plus plenty of yeastiness acting to offset the richness the results spoke to old-school craftsmanship without a whole lot of fuss, a similar style employed in two desserts enjoyed later that day in the form of a moist lemon layer cake and banana cream pie that was unfortunately a bit short on fruit but still quite flavorful with a pudding base beneath a mountain of whipped cream.

Assuredly a place with skilled line-cooks, on this particular morning a trio working at great pace with plates coming through the window every couple minutes, course two arrived shortly after the last of the frosting was scraped from the cinnamon roll plate and quickly eschewing pseudo-syrup in favor of pure maple goodness brought from home the thin flapjacks proved fluffy and full of buttermilk while the Monte Cristo finally answered the question of where to find an authentic iteration in the (702) - each deep fried bite packed with ham and turkey bursting forth with flavor beneath two gooey cheeses, a powdered sugar sprinkling and spread of strawberry jam seeing the Diner-classic complete.

Easily overlooked in favor of familiar chains, local groups slowly expanding their brand, and fanciful new spots on The Strip, Lou's Diner is a throwback to 'greasy spoons' speckled across America - a place that feels familiar, friendly, and full of nostalgia with the sort of food that is at-worst straightforward, and otherwise genuinely delicious and authentic.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,4,6,4,qRUO0YKjVT3y0vehbmaRsg

Anywho.  I LOVE this place.  In fact it reminds me of home.  It reminds me of the local diner of yesteryear.  Try sitting in there facing the kitchen so you cannot see Decatur Blvd and you for get you are in Las Vegas!  I felt like I was sitting in a mom and pop joint in Idaho. (that's a good thing BTW).  This place has that mom and pop family restaurant charm to it with out even trying.  It is a real mom and pop joint.   

I ordered the chicken fried steak and eggs.  The chicken fried steak was out of sight!  It was crunchy on the outside and tender on the inside.  It was thinner than other chicken fried steaks but it was huge.  They might tenderize real well that makes it wider and thinner, but that is only speculation.  It was smothered with gravy.  

The eggs, and I have said this before, a good breakfast joint has to perfectly baste my eggs.  This place served perfectly basted eggs.  Almost... almost... not quite as good as my mom does... almost.  I had the home fries with breakfast.  They were good.  It was just all around good breakfast food.

The portion was huge.  The prices were low.  Great value here!

The service was good. The waitress wasn't exactly warm but she had the diner waitress attitude that is borderline curt but at the same time likably crusty.  Kinda like Tommy Lasorda.

The food finally came, nacho, eggs benedict, eggs were perfect, hollandaise was perfect and the potatoes were nice and crisp.  I loved my open face turkey, but, I really felt it could have been a lot hotter. Uriel got the tenders and fries but for 9.99 and only 2 pieces it was was overpriced.  We will Def com back here and look forward to trying out some other items.",hLdd68fn1VP1s7BAZElNhQ,0,0,4,OWSM8V_Ukwpo-aYX-aeHOg

So its made personal, which is hard to find here in Las Vegas! Another cool thing is they allow you to leave your own coffee cup for when you come back. Great experience!",GrCxXo3YEICRzeLxIpVBbw,0,0,5,OlIJ3IaX-75wzO9luyhlKA

Go try this place!f",F5IXwIQkS5ZhLFjeWjTj6g,0,0,5,rnFzUyrsGlEI7GKhLfpthw

It's fantastic diner food at criminally low prices, and a nice reminder that there's more to Las Vegas than The Strip. The husband and wife that own the place are unbelievably friendly and will do everything they can to make your dining experience great. Highly recommend the Curtis' Stack as the biscuits and gravy are unreal. Can't see myself eating breakfast anywhere and highly recommend this place to anyone and everyone.",b3uSOKQZDRuUnGYy7VuKqg,0,0,5,lObImWSSyV-wxisZBNsrvw

Lou's is wonderful. A total old timers little diner. Prices are still ridiculously cheap and the coffee is hot and strong, and homemade jam!! Not much more you can ask for!",GMyeEaiXMLIg712fG-v5yQ,5,2,5,vlO4L03c4vjOZirKXx4QWg
