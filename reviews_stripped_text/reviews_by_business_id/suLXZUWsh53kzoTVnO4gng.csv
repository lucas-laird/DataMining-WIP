We ask what happy hour it was and it took him 5 mins to just tell us it was the 1/2 off milk shake happy hour. As we ordered one chili cheese dog he ask if we'd like ketchup, mayo, and mustard on our order and we said no to all, but we did ask to add onions on it, and also on another order (extreme tots) not to add chili. After he asked if everything looked right on the screen we saw it still said ketch up, mayo, and mustard. So we had to tell him again to please take it off. When we got our food it had no ketch up mayo or mustard like we asked but it didn't have onions on it. Also the order we asked for with no chili was covered with chili. So we let them know. Although it was good customer service, we had to wait 10 mins for them to bring back the same hotdog and a different tots without chili. And the hot dog tasted like crap according to my boyfriend and the on top of that  the cheese in my tots was all nasty and hard and not shredded. So I don't recommend this sonic.",Bnb5lQrA4t1JHRhEUEXmdw,0,0,1,VhnxduTT9UnCeb6Veo1yYA

It was 75 percent ice. My husband got a soda that had also contained that much ice. We asked for refills and the manager informed us that we would have to pay for them. We told him that it was mostly ice to begin with and he still insisted he had to charge us. That is crap. If I did not even get the drink I originally paid for why should I pay even more to get it??!!! I have not been charged at other locations and I have never been given a drink with so much ice either. I was so disappointed that I almost did not want to go to any Sonic location again. Get rid of that manager and replace him with someone who is familiar with the phrase customer service, especially when he failed to provide a quality product in the first place.

791994,2015-03-26,0,suLXZUWsh53kzoTVnO4gng,"The burgers are good. 

Fresh tasting, cooked well, soft bun, not over stuffed with low quality lettuce, just a little, and finely chopped onions with perfectly melted cheese. 

I really like their burgers, onion rings, shakes, and tots. I've tried the strawberry cheesecake, banana cream pie shake, the caramel waffle cone, the coconut cream pie shake.

The double cheeseburger and the regular cheeseburger are good quality burgers. Big in size and made very well for a drive thru burger joint. Sometimes you have to wait about 3-5 mins, but its worth the wait for what you get. 

Its probably a bit pricier for some people per burger (around 3 for a regular, 4 for a double) but the burgers are bigger and thicker than your average burger, and in my opinion, one of the best burgers you can get for something quick. Superior to In N out ( I was surprised too!!)  and you get half off drinks (shakes after 8 pm, juices and other drinks from 2 pm to 5 pm) I don't think it gets much better than that.

I can get a medium , huge shake for about 3 bucks. Which is super cheap. Never had any issues with hair, rude employees, bones, or anything in my food, and I've been there probably about 8 times  if not more over the course of the new year (January-March)

See. This right here is just dis-re-dayum-spect-ful. And they wonder why government employees go postal....

I urge those reading to know in advance that this review is being composed while we wait within gridlock, stemmed nonetheless, by a convoluted drive thru line consisting of no less than 20 cars - total.

Did I miss a memo?

What the heck is going on? This is the equivalent of dozing off and awakening to see an ICE raid with no type of advanced warning!

Thinking we'd somehow stumbled upon a method towards escaping Alcatraz, we pulled up to an order box and were promptly informed per our pressing the call button that:

""THE DRIVE UP BOX WAS CLOSED DUE TO A LACK OF EMPLOYEES"".

The result of this obvious deficiency was our being forced to circle around and join in on the paddy-wagon by adding to the drive thru line. Half an hour later, we're still here and while I've phoned 911..... THE ONE PHONE CALL I'M PERMITTED, I'm driven to think they've prioritized some other emergency. 

Perhaps it was that Amber Alert that I received a cell phone alert for a bit earlier.

Whatever the case. Help me somebody! 

Help me please!

This is absolute entrapment and I will gladly perform a lap dance and a foot massage to the first person enabled to air lift us from this horse-shoed traffic jam that is this Sonic's drive thru!

Y'all hear that? Kenny Ken will balance your bunyans for some much overdue assistance!!!

Had I been better prepared, I'd have requested someone put money on my books.

SERIOUSLY - if you don't have enough manpower to perform your duties effectively, WHYYYYY THE HECK EVEN OPEN UP SHOP???!

(sighs....)

Geeyodd DAYUM. All a brutha wanted was a Cherry Limeade slurpie, but I'm so darned dehydrated at this point, I'll gladly settle for a cup of ice cubes, some tator tots and a prison tat.

Might have thrown them with the flavor request. Get everything back and I got a sweet tea = loads of sugar. You can test with your blood sugar meter. Not wanting to get anyone ill I will go ahead and pour this out. Not a big deal but this drink was for a severe diabetic this is just crappy. You guys need to get organized and take care the customers. One of the reason I come here is that you have sugar free options.

1729376,2014-06-24,0,suLXZUWsh53kzoTVnO4gng,"There are a lot less Sonic locations here than in Texas, but yet I never really find myself seeking them out now that we've moved here. I tend to like their commercials, and they have some decent discounts/specials: like right now it's summer shake season, with half off shakes after 8PM.

Went in today and got a peanut butter chocolate flavor for myself, with a chocolate java chiller for my guy. He also took the liberty of adding on a garlic parm hotdog on their new cheese bread dogs, and an order of their little-known ""extreme tots""- chili cheese tots with ranch and jalapenos.

I'm not a huge fan of the food with this chain and this location didn't stand out from others. Tots are typically too salty for me, ordering them this way lessened the salt flavor. Hotdog, despite the special bun, did not have much flavor either, but the parm sauce on it was pretty interesting.
Shakes were thick and large- prices here seem higher than I'm used to though. PBC shake was better than the java chiller, but I'd like to see a coffee flavor on their shake menu in the future.

I like how the drive-up stands have credit card slots to pay after you order. Wish they could add on a feature to tip this way. I'm always baffled about how much/whether to tip someone to bring me my order, but here the drive-thru section gives you the option to go their instead of to a stand if you know you don't want to tip or don't have cash in addition to your card.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,1,0,3,zwiFVHZUg3YhluH34bzOyA

Which you put in your belly when you're making bad decisions, eating late, or drunk. Or on $0.50 corn dog day - because who can resist a deal like that?? The food is subpar, but as your mom always said ""there are starving kids in other countries, so be grateful for what you have.""  Or just go somewhere else for dinner. Seriously - do that. Go somewhere else for food. Grab your candy slushy and go anywhere else for a cheeseburger, you'll thank me later. 

The drinks, on the other hand, are sugary deliciousness.  If you don't like what you ordered, then you should probably reevaluate your concoction. From flavored sodas, to milkshakes, to candy infused drinks, to plain iced tea, there's something to suit your tastebuds.  If there's a family favorite you can also order certain items by the half gallon (think sweet tea & iced tea & sodas etc).

Service is also cute. Sonic is a drive in fast food place. You order on this machine by pressing a button and talking to an employee. Once you're done they bring out your order by skating over to you! Yes, the staff wears rollerblades. They give you the food and you pay.

Well, for my money Sonic Drive Thru is a cut above most of the other chain burger places that line our streets. The burgers at Sonic are always fresh and made to order and the variety of burgers to choose from is quite extensive. A lot of the big chains have to slather their sandwiches with secret sauce or condiments to hide how dry they are. This isn't the case at Sonic. Their burgers are always juicy and full of real beef flavor. These are the kind of burgers that you have to hunch over to eat or you end up with a stained shirt. That's how a burger should be. 
  The fries at Sonic are fried to crispy perfection and the serving sizes are generous. Sonic's onion rings are easily the best at any burger place I've ever been. They are always hot and fresh with a perfectly crunchy fried shell. They are heaven. 
  This part of my review may sound a little odd, but Sonic has the best fountain Coke I've ever had. Now you may say that there isn't any difference from the Coke at one place or another, but Sonic has to be tweaking their Coke in some way. The first time I took my wife to Sonic I told her how good the Coke was compared to other places. She thought I was nuts until she tasted it for herself. She was hooked. If anyone knows their secret I'd like to know. Sonic's milk shakes are also worth the extra calories. They always have an assortment of specialty shakes for different seasons and holidays and they are always delicious. Sonic no longer has one of my favorite treats on their regular menu: the Cream Pie Shake! These were available in banana, chocolate and coconut. The Cream Pie Shake do occasionally pop up on the menu in a variety of flavors and if they are being made when you stop by, they are a must.

3766578,2015-07-07,0,suLXZUWsh53kzoTVnO4gng,"Big fan of Sonic, originally for their burgers, corn dogs, chocolate cokes, and especially their onion rings (which to me are the tastiest of any fast food place I've tried). Then I started trying their breakfast, and was surprised by how good their coffee tastes (branded as ""Red Button Roast"", made with 100 percent Arabica beans and possibly a Douwe Egbert blend per Googling). For me, the best coffee I've ever found at a fast-food place, very smooth, non-bitter, and never seems to have that burned, ""end of the pot"" taste.  Usually have a yummy sausage ""Toaster"" for breakfast (kind of a grilled cheese with scrambled eggs). I really loved their toasters on French Toast bread, but sadly those got discontinued. Sonic offers their entire menu even at breakfast, so you can even have a burger or hot dog etc. in the morning if mood strikes you.

Sonic has great specials, deals on sodas before 10 AM and from 2-5 PM (when their yummy corn dogs are also on sale).  Making this particular location 5 stars for me is the customer service, especially Brooke J.  She is super friendly, meticulous about getting your order right before and after, extra effort like making sure your coffee lid is on tight and won't spill, and remembers frequent customers with a smile. She works both the drive-thru and the parking stalls, and has an extra bounce in her step (or skates LOL) and is the type who hustles at her work even when no-one is watching :-).  A previous Yelper also commended Brooke and even called her ""Bumble Bee Brooke"" for her hustle LOL.

This Sonic's is on West Sahara, about 5 minutes from where I live: definitely in my comfort zone of travel. All the usual fare of Sonic: sundaes, burgers, and limeades. All done well here. I suggest drinking your cherry limeade with a peppermint in mouth and caramel sundaes here. I usually stay away from the burgers and sandwiches because they usually hover around bland. Grilled cheese, tots, and stuffed jalapenos are also notables. Chicken fingers are also decent. I suggest eating here if you're not in the mood for the same old JITB, McD's, or Del Taco.

Oh well, tossed another one in the machine... a half dozen times, before I was able to pay.

It seemed like mere seconds before my special order burger, drink and tots mmmm delicious, savory tots were delivered by a roller skate enabled car hop.

Took off back to the office, scarfed down my burger, enjoyed tots with fry sauce, which if you have not had it, is a must! And drank the soda too quick so I could savor the crunchy ice.",ajx1YQYaSiF_tBFaaP7XKA,0,0,4,VrqhF8PRWuHAok00BIcj6g

I understand that my mother does not speak perfect English, and does struggle with certain words, but while trying to order the staff member apparently decided not to even bother at making an attempt to understand her and instead ignored her and moved on to the next person. She was left talking to herself, very confused and she could hear the staff member taking the persons order in the car next to her. She sat there waiting until someone noticed and came to her car to take her order. She felt very embarrassed and I am furious that someone would be so insensitive towards her when she is making an effort.",EDYAntGd997ESL-KhXcmmw,0,0,1,e67ZUcGYpB-vwAWj6f26CQ
