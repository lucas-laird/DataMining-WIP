2539176,2018-05-10,0,TIUd6XX7-hF6EPF2NowMsA,Great pleasure to meet Mona today! She heard I was heading to a lunch with my young daughter and offered ideas for packaging the sandwich to make it easier. Super sweet and attentive. She's an asset to Subway.,RxiXBOrHALvaAIgE0c_gUg,0,0,5,E4Mx7WLXpOXEqgseLX1LgA
2805266,2018-03-09,1,TIUd6XX7-hF6EPF2NowMsA,"So I just went here to order a sandwich platter. I was told they were $54.00, but as I was questioning the girl about the kinds of sandwiches, she directed me to the catering brochures. Well the prices are all $38, and when I asked her where the $54 dollar one that she quoted me was, she didn't know. Then I asked if they could cut the sandwiches into 4 because I'm trying to make them little for a reception and I was told the sandwiches won't fit on the tray then. What? That doesn't even make sense. So I asked if they could just split them onto two trays, to which I was told that he'd have to call his manager to see if they could do that! The only reason I came here is because our office secretary recommended them and said they could even cut the sandwiches up into fours and the trays are $35! So either this place doesn't operate like the Subway she goes to, or the employees don't know what they are talking about here! Kind of a frustrating experience, so I went to the place across the street, who gave me exactly what I was looking for, but a little more $. That's fine, I had an overall better experience.",OJA-15Qvh9OqSRqwrdGNeQ,1,0,2,itan5lgGbmpj7v83bbl6Ig

I came in today around 2:30 and it was slow, the two kids working did not seem like they wanted to be there. When I'm ready to order I let them know and they just keep talking with each other. We had some small talk but their conversation seemed much more important. I felt rushed out of there, the gal just wrapped up my sandwich before I got to finish telling her what I wanted on it. I work in the service industry and I know how you should treat customers, I did not feel very welcomed through the whole visit.",QKbM4dN6GWaGCZDUGvF5Gg,0,0,2,Cr3paBThsNUEwXtGcgvBtg
3605550,2013-01-22,0,TIUd6XX7-hF6EPF2NowMsA,"Subway is pretty standard. This one is clean, quiet, and quick.  I'm usually greeted as soon as I enter the store, that's always a good sign. The employees are johnny on the spot with whipping up your crazy sandwhich combinations.",FTZyZbr1eF7s3Ss7uSLcXQ,0,0,4,olt1xWVJ4zlL7Xf2HOWosA

This location is convenient and it's employees have good, quick service. They're very friendly and i always see the owner behind the counter helping to serve as needed.

They honor deals and coupons if you have them for this location. 

Being pregnant, I miss my cold cut combo but their meatball suffices in the meantime!

Also don't forget that they do breakfast sandwiches too!

P.s. I'll always choose this place over Jimmy Johns (because JJ is an avid trophy hunter in Africa- irrelevant but I'd rather give my profits to franchisees like subway over that guy).",M4uGs-0Fskn48t9icYk_Tw,1,1,4,WUbjoU3IHfGWanQsO7tytw
4451292,2015-03-10,0,TIUd6XX7-hF6EPF2NowMsA,"I came here because it's close to my work but I return because of the service. They are always quick to greet me when I come in, and even when they are busy they are still efficient. I add a bunch of veggies and sauce to my sandwich and it's never a problem. They always see to be in a good mood. This is a legit subway.",EOcMg0tldZApWAiParlrfw,0,0,5,QmucRv9-V0Rfm3zFMfuKIw
5269117,2015-11-22,0,TIUd6XX7-hF6EPF2NowMsA,"The worst experience I've ever had is with this location. I ordered sandwiches online the website asks for your telephone number in case there is an issue with your order. I arrive at this location to find out the bread I wanted wasn't available so I changed the bread then they come back with we don't have the meatballs either. I asked for the order to be cancelled since it's now been charged to my card. Not only can they not find the order on their system I'm told I have to come back tomorrow to get my charge back. This place is the worst franchise out there I will never eat here again, I urge everyone to do the same. I feel they basically stole my money with a "" sorry nothing we can do about it"" attitude. To make it worse they took the meat and cheese off the bread put it back in the bins and return the bread to the warmer. Hope you vegetarians don't mind a little salami grease on your bread.",xnpLgnCelVLMp1_amRbNxg,0,0,1,gXN8omDOMc7Qs45uDQWfEA
5344452,2018-01-04,0,TIUd6XX7-hF6EPF2NowMsA,"So I am guessing every employee at this location makes their sandwiches slightly different.. my 2nd day this week getting a tuna 6inch, 1st one was great!! Had lots of tuna that I could actually enjoy & taste, today not so much,
They give u smallest ice cream scoops ever & when asked for more, the girl rudely said it's extra? Like really, you barely put any to begin with, but ok that's fine 
She wasn't friendly much anyways but from now on I won't be going back. My sandwich is very sad looking",rAk4Vh2HWs2geS2cxekj7A,0,0,1,FW3BWFi6MQe-bIgp4KL0XQ
