I ordered the filet mignon rare, and came out exactly right, flavored fabulously. The mushrooms as a side went perfect. 
And Brandon, the head mixologist at the bar, made the hands down best old fashioned I've ever had. Not to mention he provided my team and I phenomenal service.

Menu had a great selection and all sides were extra, the side dishes were great but the steaks were very disappointing, nothing worse than spending almost $250.00 for 4 meals and gettting a dry flavorless cut of meat.

We had been at another casino that didn't have much open on a Sunday afternoon for early dinner.  So we thought - ahhh what the heck lets stop in to the Gold Coast.    They open the bar area at 4 for cocktails and a limited bar menu so we decide to have drinks and appetizers.  
Started with a couple glasses of wine and ordered the calamari,  Was really delicious.  Not your tradition Italian style.   This had a sweet and spicy glaze - was mmmmmmmm.
They also brought us out the bread plate which was good as well.

We decided to stay and have dinner which we did right at the bar.  The bartenders and the wait staff were extremely friendly.  
We started our meal with the French Onion Soup - was a little salty but had a nice flavor and the onions were cooked well (they brought us out some more of that yummy bread)
I had prime rib  -medium rare, hubby had the wagyu sirloin - medium rare.
Both were cooked perfectly and seasoned just right 
We shared a loaded baked potato.   Also well prepared.
Too stuff to try desert - maybe next time.

Was a really nice experience - we will definitely be back.",iKfBR0eMsM4GjT-s2MVTeQ,1,0,5,wA941ZfxBRNLXuMA-4l9RA

We all liked our meals and various sides (ala carte) very much. There was so much food! Yes the meal was a bit pricey, but it was very delicious and excellently prepared, so worth it for a fancy dinner in a town where mediocre buffets average $40 per person.  The restaurant was quiet and not overly crowded. The wait staff from the bar tender to the servers to our table's waitress were all extremely polite and friendly. I always feel weird about presenting coupons because I worry I will look like a giant cheapskate or that there will be some fine print I didn't follow. But our coupons were accepted with a big smile and no issues what so ever. I highly recommend trying this restaurant out if you are looking to treat yourself to a nice steak and take a break from the usual human feeding troughs (i.e. buffets) of Vegas.",vrk9Ihz_iOKJO5UY6SkgXg,1,0,5,FpmAofWgPfI1NeRvnhTcPg

1429481,2016-09-28,0,BYp4NUxpwXCsTAoEmksLxA,"I'm a foodie. I love looking for new and cool places to try. It seems like some people had a bad night. It happens, even at the most classy joints. This place does not try and compete with the high end fancy spots so I laugh when I see reviewers say such bad things and put it down. Is it high end....No. The décor is really nice and modern. The blue and black theme is sharp. My wife and I came after hearing about it being a new steakhouse in Las Vegas from eater. I was taking my wife on a fancy date night with a Rock of Ages show after. It worked perfect since it was next door. I had a reservation at Delmonico's but canceled since the menu was more appealing to me. We love desserts and we love lemoncello and when I saw that they had a lemoncello cake with a shot of lemoncello it was destiny for us to try. We had a great server, not sure what her name is but she is very friendly. We were gonna get a craft beer but the Old Fashioned caught our attention. We like them and thought why not. Our server talked highly about them. They did not disappoint. One of the best we have tried. Very smooth and well balanced. We are actually going there for Happy hour just because of them. My wife ordered the Filet Mignon and I ordered the NY. They were perfectly seasoned and cooked perfectly. The steaks were both tender and juicy for being well done.....yes that's the way we ordered them and like them ;-). The mashed potatoes side we ordered were buttery, velvety goodness. We ordered the panko cauliflower. Huge pieces and tasty panko. That was the only thing that needed salt. We scooped the panko crumbs and mixed it with the mashed potatoes. It was evily delicious. When we go back, we will definetly ask for the panko crumbs to be put on top of our mashed potatoes. After an awesome meal and feeling a little tipsy after a couple Old Fashions it was time for the dessert. The dessert that pulled us away from Delmonico's Steakhouse and into the Gold Coast for our fancy date night :-) The Lemoncello Cake with Lemoncello Shot. The cake was light, not overly sweet and tasted fantastic. The Lemoncello in the cake was very tasty and the shot to go with it was perfect. It was a high end lemoncello shot so it was well worth it. The prices aren't to bad and they have a great Happy Hour. Some people don't like change and prolly want the Cortez room back or won't give it a shot because it's in the Gold Coast. That's cool, I know my wife and I will enjoy it and not have to worry about blowing our paycheck on one dinner like other steakhouses. Will we go to other fancier steakhouses...yes but I know this place is a gem for us and know we will get good service, great food, and have an awesome time. Till next time.....Let's Eat!!!!",sX_PPJHVCo6P0Jbm7jxd6A,5,0,5,_1PklEKEMbtBYu79fte4ow

She has a smile on her face all the time, she answers your questions so thoroughly and with passion about the food. Definitely ask for her table.
I had the eye of rib eye with Diane sauce. It was superb. Get this. I also had the house salad and also recommend that as well. The bread is like a garlic soft warm bread that you will eat til gone. It comes with a side of gerkins, carrots, radish pieces, olives and cold crunchy green beans. 
My friend got the pork porterhouse. I tried it. It was good, but the rib eye was better. He also got the wedge salad with a large thick strip of candied bacon.
We split the oysters rockefeller and will get those again. I wish they would have a mesh over the lemon halves to keep the seeds out, but not a big deal. Nice place and shorts with a dress shirt is ok.

3 Ambiance 
3 Decor
2 Food
2.5 Service

I know this doesn't average out to 2 stars, but personally I give more weight to the quality of food and service than ambiance and decor. 

That said, nothing special about ambiance nor decor. 

Service was below average. Gary, our main waiter was probably a 3 by himself. After taking our order for appetizers, it took him 20 min to come back and take our entree order which was frustrating because we had to watch him walking around the bar looking at his phone and chatting with others. 
Once our entrees arrived, he did check on us a couple times during the meal which was nice. Unfortunately, after finishing our meals we had to wait over 20 minutes before we could ask him for the check. His supporting waitress was very unfriendly when she brought our bread and then again when dropping off drinks. She didn't even acknowledge us when we said thank you. But warmed up a bit towards end of meal. 

Food was pretty terrible here overall. We ordered:

Calamari - decent, 3/5

Seafood platter - DO NOT order! Shrimp was ok, lump crab so-so, oysters large/briny/not fresh, ""stone crab"" was worst stone crab I've ever had...so dry and awful couldn't even eat it, lobster tough and rubbery. 0/5

Wedge salad - decent, 3/5

Pork chop porterhouse - probably best thing we had 3/5

Brussel sprouts - 1/5 most places make them crispy and drizzle balsamic, these tasted boiled then topped and tasted like they were frozen. 

Baked potato - 2/5 wish they put toppings on the side to self top, instead was pre-topped and they overloaded with so much butter and sour cream. Was too buttery and salty, but potato was cooked well.",jGKMAlMNbgonyeZBdqMpEg,0,0,2,zP4tOJhXy62KhfP7kMe4CA

Found Cornerstone on a whim when I tossed steakhouse into google to find a spot for a quick pre night out sit down meal. 

I'll be honest I did not have the highest of expectations going in. 

Boy was I wrong, The Cornerstone delivered an excellent meal that myself and my friends all thoroughly enjoyed. 

We had a bit of everything and were not let down by a single plate. (Only minor thing I will mention is I would have liked more cucumber with the tuna appetizer. The combination was great but the ratio of greens to fish was a bit off). 

We all had different cuts and they were cooked to our liking with no issues whatsoever. 

We were in a rush towards the end of the meal and did not grab dessert but instead shot back one last dirty martini. We paid our (very reasonable) bill and sauntered out with full bellies and a great spot to recommend in the future.",1qZgznyzuEywBuqYnY-_KQ,0,0,4,t5sMzmHrm2W4VunzpAmi3Q

1749080,2016-11-02,1,BYp4NUxpwXCsTAoEmksLxA,"Very bad.  A Boyd's customer, but not Gold Coast.  So they sent me a comp because it was newly remodeled.  Good thing it was basically free, but wasn't even happy to pay the overage from the comp which was nominal.  

Wait staff was a little overzealous trying to be a high end steakhouse.  The waitress is happy and attentive.  We order a New York strip for $30 and lamb chops for $33 a la carte and $6 mashed....which were the best part of the meal.  The New York strip reminded us of the outback when they traded down to meet the 9.99 price point and my lamb chops reminded me of a ponderosa grisly, fatty steak from my youth.  The lamb were grey in color and were well done even though I ordered rare.  I sent them back hoping maybe they would be better the second time around.  The waitress does offer apologies and nicely brings new ones that were just as sad looking.  

To be sure, the wait staff was very good and the bread plate was served with a few relish items.  Again, a nice touch and better than the meal.  

I sent my entree back and no dessert was offered as a comp, which I only say because the meal was that bad twice, but my feeling is they knew people aren't enjoying the food.  

I would not eat here again, comped or not.  Grossly overpriced and poor quality. And yes, I have been to many high end and low end steakhouses.",WIu4IqktLQ6Qm46L5r5Baw,2,1,1,4OSzC4H1dVoLuN_O76ywGg

The busboy was amazing.  Keep table cleared..refills promptly filled...very polite.  They deserve more stars but the food  is why only two..!!

Salad: chopped ceasar, very crisp and cool but dressing was lacking in that Ceasars punch.  Needed some seasoning.  

Bread tray: rolls ok..,but I did like the pickled veggies served with it.

Appetizer:  crab cakes?  They were soggy?

Steaks: bone in rib eye and filet- very disappointed in quality of taste...my filet had no flavor at all and my husbands was a little tough but biggest disappoint was the quality of meat.

Garlic potatoes:  very watery?  
What gives with this?  We had a dining certificate or I would have really complained.  Left good tip but I would never eat here again, the prices for the quality are outrageous!  Our check would have been $125 w/o the certificate so I would have sent this all back.

It's suppose to be a higher in restaurant then the ones they have.  It always seemed dark and gloomy from the outside and nothing that would pull me in. Plus I have eaten at the buffet next door and it's what you would expect from a older hotel compared to the buffets on the strip.

Actually was a surprise to see how nice it was in the restaurant. Very cozy for dinner with your love ones or business associates.  I am not so sold on the blue as the main color scheme but overall it felt clean and classy.

They served a little tray with crisp vegetables, olives and bread. A great to nibble on while waiting on your order.

We started with the Shrimp cocktail. Prawns were large and tasted very fresh. Then both had a house salad.

My husband ordered the prime rib and a backed potato with asparagus. The prime rib cut was huge and he was unable to finish it.

I ordered the baked chicken and let me tell you it was so juicy that the juices where covering my plate as I started to cut it. Lacked a little seasoning but honestly the mustard sauce gave it a great touch. It was plenty. I was unable to finish it as well. 

Service was excellent, servers came by to refill glasses, check on us and clear plates as we finished.

Our server, Gary, was impeccably composed and our busser, Michael, scarily efficient; the lemonade and water glasses were never left wanting. Everything was tasty and the steaks just as ordered.

The highlight tonight was the strawberry shortcake. Presentation was beautiful and taste even better. The cake part of the dessert was denser than the normal spongy stuff and had these wonderful grill marks on them...which you tasted. Yum!! It all stood up very well to the strawberries, syrup, whipped cream, and ice cream that completed the dish. I shoulda asked for a to go serving...ah well, next time.

We ordered a range of cuts of meat from ribeye, to strip, to filets. Everything was cooked accordingly and there were no complaints. I would pass on the crab legs given a second chance. All vegetables were cooked correctly and nothing was overdone.

2807788,2017-02-08,0,BYp4NUxpwXCsTAoEmksLxA,"You gotta know this about Vegas - there are a whole lot of steakhouses that serve a great meal at a reasonable price.  That's reason enough to live here.  And Cornerstone (in the Gold Coast hotel) is one of those great steakhouses.

I liked this room back when it was the Cortez.  The menu remains similar, but the space has been redesigned to be much more modern with high end accents and artwork.  The room is moderately large, and quiet enough for comfortable conversation.  Thank God, no big screen TV's (the scourge of Vegas restaurants) were visible from our table.  

Everything on the menu is reasonably priced, but the Prix Fixe meal is an exceptional bargain at $27.  (It's not listed on the menu, but the waiter explained it along with the specials.)  I had the filet, along with starters of Oysters Rockefeller and Beer Cheese Soup.  Everything was delicious.  My wife had the crab legs special - a huge plate of tasty crab legs, pre-cracked and ready to eat.  She had a side of Lobster Mac & Cheese, which was also very good.  My cheesecake dessert was not fantastic, but definitely acceptable.

Our waiter, Chad, was attentive without being solicitous or overly-chatty, which suited us just fine.  Our drinks were generous and appeared quickly.  Wonder of wonder, the well scotch was my brand - Johnny Walker.  At $8 it was less than half of what you would pay for a smaller pour at one of the Strip hotels.  Also quick to appear was an interesting plate of bread (kind of a crusty croissant, but not quite) and a small jar of crudites.  Nice. The spacing between courses was just right.  The check appeared just moments after we requested it.  Yeah, the room was kind of empty on a Tuesday night, but quick service is appreciated nevertheless.

The Gold Coast is about a mile west of the Strip, so access is pretty convenient.  It is a Boyd hotel, and I've gotta say - I have never eaten at a Boyd hotel steakhouse that wasn't five stars.  They cater to locals, and want repeat business.  It shows.  This is just high end and great value.",ZmKGF8ZZUo16g2ISrz4ahw,1,0,5,W5aIH9t86LQcouv_7Qr8qA

Our waiter, Cliff, came to our table and asked if we wanted something to drink. He was not friendly at all.  We asked for water, ice tea, and a glass of wine. The water came in a glass with no ice and was at room temperature. The ice tea came with 4 small ice cubes.  We had to ask for a refill on the ice tea, and asked for ice.  Abigail, the ""back server"" brought our food out and was so personable.  She should have been the food server as she had such a ""bubbly"" personality. The Onion Soup was very good. I had the Scampi. Four shrimp served with noodles was okay for 26.00. My friend had the Salmon.  After eating, we sat with empty plates waiting to be picked up. It's not like our server was busy. I am not a fan of the ""front"" and ""back"" waiter concept. I like a food server that takes my order, then delivers it. Three different people brought food out.  The baked potato was huge. Enough for 3 people. The waiter never suggested splitting one. But he did not talk much at all and maybe was having a bad night.  He was not attentive at all.

Drowned in hollandaise sauce. I finish my wine, and my waiter is nowhere to be found. Ok. Bartender notices and provides a generous pour. Thank you. I ordered the grass fed NY steak; rare with brussel sprouts. The brussel sprouts we're decent. The steak was less than average. Cooked as ordered, but tasteless. I've had better steak from the supermarket, and at any number of a variety of cafes in any garden and variety Cafe in a Las Vegas casino. Stay away. There are many more choices.

3478383,2016-10-07,4,BYp4NUxpwXCsTAoEmksLxA,"I'd like to share the dining experience I had at Cornerstone on October 6th. We didn't have a reservation and the restaurant was fully committed for the evening. The hostesses were very nice and said we could dine in the bar area with a limited menu. Our server greeted us in a timely manner and explained that tonight was the first night that they were not serving a full menu at the bar to accommodate those with reservations. Completely understandable. After we had ordered, the hostess sat a party of four close to where we were sitting and handed them a full menu. As the hostess walked by, I kindly asked the hostess for a menu as well. The server greeted that table and looked confused as to why they had full dinner menus and approached the manager. The manager greeted them with a big smile and they conversed and he leaned over with a big smile and laughed and walked away. They proceeded to order.  When our server returned to the table, I kindly asked for an order of Shrimp Scampi off the dinner menu. A few minutes later, the manager approached my table and rudely said ""Is there a problem here?"" I replied.. ""No, I just wanted to order some Scampi."" He proceeded to explain that the other table had reservations, even though they were sitting in the bar area, and they were making an exception for them. The manager did not smile once and had a serious look on his face. Is that how a manager in a fine dining establishment greets a guest? ""IS THERE A PROBLEM HERE?"" All I did was order scampi! He just greeted another table 10 minutes earlier with a completely different demeanor! The manager was just plain rude. He didn't even introduce himself or pretend to be apologetic. He just walked away afterwards. He made us feel unwelcomed and acted as if we were bothering him. It felt like complete discrimination. Why didn't he greet us with a big smile like the four older Caucasian people? Is it because we were Asian? Or was it because I was wearing flip flops in a Steakhouse? We felt like we did something wrong. 

The hostess was very welcoming. Our server was wonderful. She kept apologizing for not being able to accommodate us and for her manager's rude behavior. I insist on the Food and Beverage Director to interview this server as she witnessed when the manager approached us. You will find out that I am not exaggerating one bit on how we were treated. I don't need an email or a phone call with an apology and I'm definitely not looking for a free meal because I will not return to an establishment that treats guests outside their 'preferred clientele' with such disrespect. What I am asking for is that you investigate and educate your managers on how to treat people equally and not judge people based on their age, race, or ethnicity.. because that's what it definitely felt like.

It's such a shame too.. the server was super friendly and the food was delicious! However, it sucks that one ignorant manager ruined my total experience!",kVW0fonbaswPAh9yLQNQUQ,9,3,1,H-ZZQ1U6Ru5Tmkn0MPq1Vg

We just finished with what I would describe as the least appetizing and most underwhelming steak dinner I have had in the nearly 5 years I've lived here in Las Vegas. I am a fan of the ""Tomahawk "" RibEye cut when it comes to my steak,so when I saw a VERY reasonably priced Tomahawk on the menu I naturally ordered it. The steak arrived  an visually presentation was average at best but I was starving so I just dug in. From the first bite to the last (I only ate half of the steak) I could taste nothing but a combination of pepper and a charred taste. This was the most horribly seasoned and prepared piece of meat I have eaten in a very long time. There was no flavor,thank goodness I ordered the Diane sauce on the side. 

Let's rewind just a bit to little things throughout the meal .  Water was refilled ONCE. Everytime something was brought to the table (Bread,Salad /Soup,appetizer etc NOTHING was said by either of the 4 different individuals that serviced our table tonight. Food was dropped at the table in silence. There was no consistency or communication or flow really between the staff in the dining room. At one point we asked for more bread to which the individual responded  "" let me get your busser. If I was not as starving as I was I without a doubt would have sent back my food and ask for a manager. There was no sincerity and wanting to service the customer type of feeling at all from our server Phillip(I think that was his name).A VERY disappointing Dining experience.",2AO9SNRqzJTpSen8i-eIuA,1,0,2,1UiG-SHzT_ROVaLbR-k-MQ

3764947,2018-02-20,0,BYp4NUxpwXCsTAoEmksLxA,"Last year while staying at the Gold Coast Hotel and Casino, we decided to have dinner and drinks at the Cornerstone Steakhouse & Lounge. Our experience was unforgettable to say the least. After traveling that day, we decided to eat in the bar area, a little less formal. We had a lite dinner and cocktails. The dinner was excellent. Because they boast about being a martini lounge they provided us with a menu of martinis and I've got to tell you, they did not disappoint. The chef even stopped by our table to make sure everything was alright. The service provided by the bartender Dave and his bar-back Karl was spot on. They were both our drink and dinner servers. We told them that our friend was joining us the following day and happened to mention her drink of choice. When we showed up the following day, we were barely in our seats when Dave and Karl showed up with our cocktails. We didn't even need to order and our friend was a little taken back that they knew what she would order. I was surprised they remembered. Fast forward to 2 weeks ago, we were back at the Gold Coast and thought we would go back to the Cornerstone. Maybe the service we received last year was a fluke. Let me tell you, it was NOT. Both Dave and Karl were spot on again. They even remembered us from last year. I'm sure they have waited on a lot of customers since our last visit but they were all smiles when we showed up. Because my friend is disabled, I called down to their front desk and asked if they could reserve a table for us and was told that they could not, that the bar area was open seating. When we got there I mentioned this to Dave and he said no problem. From that day forward we had a reserved table waiting for us when we got there. The staff at the Cornerstone has gone above and beyond for us. I would give them 10 stars if I could.

I made a reservation and arrived 5 minutes before time and was shown to my table.  I like how they've redone the room.  It's a bit brighter and a bit classier.

After looking over the menu, I ordered the beer and cheese bisque, the wagyu sirloin, and a baked sweet potato.  For dessert I got the chocolate espresso cake.  I was brought water and the iced tea I ordered quickly and the tea was always replenished without asking.  Between my server Chad and his helper Karl, I was well looked after during my meal.

They bring you a tray with some fresh bread, sloft butter, and an assortment of olives and veggies to snack on to get you started.

The soup was good.  I got the steak cooked blue with blue cheese on top.  It was cooked right and the taste of the steak was good.  The baked sweet potato had a cinnamon sugar butter that was too heavy on the sugar.  A little bit perhaps to cut the cinnamon but this butter was overly sweet.  

When it came time for dessert, I ordered the chocolate espresso cake and a double espresso.  Both were good.  The photos of the cake don't do justice to how LARGE it was.  Layers of light and dark chocolate with some coffee flavor.  The espresso was string.  I knew that after midnight when I was still staring at the ceiling.

The service was outstanding!  The table was always patrolled for removing used plates or removing empty sweetener packets.  The soup and steak were OK--good but nothing outstanding.  The sweet potato needs to be served with the butter on the side to let the customer decide on how much to use is at all.",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,15,11,3,ZkHpog7CZ1uasXae8vNGIQ

Beside happy hour...They normally throw some special event for the ladies here and there. Call to check :)

I had read a review that said they were small- so I was pleasantly surprised! The dinner salad was a good size for only $5 ! Delicious. The main course - I had the cedar plank salmon- it was perfectly cooked, so moist and flavorful. My husband had the 22 oz prime rib- it was perfection. When it came to the shared side-
We got the roasted cauliflower was a bit of a disappointment - it was a huge portion- but it had a sort of bread crumby mixture on it- it was too much- we didn't care for that. Made a huge mess on the table.

The service was excellent- they moved table to table with the right amount of friendliness and warmth- without over kill. We truly felt welcome.

Lol it was the perfect balance of tomato and garlic , Stephanie said it was one of the chefs family recipe , I wish I was part of that family !! The dates were plump and had a beautiful balance of sweet and savory with the bacon being a bit sweet from the maple in it!

4283414,2016-09-19,0,BYp4NUxpwXCsTAoEmksLxA,"First the positives: They did a nice job refurbishing the decor from the previous resturuant that was initially here. The service was very good. The prices are very reasonable for a high end steakhouse.

Now the negatives: My dinning partner and I ordered the lobster tails and NY Steak. Both entrees were good. However, most higher end steakhouses season their steaks perfectly, so that there is no need to put salt and pepper on the steak. Unfortunately, the steak we had lacked the proper seasoning. But once we added salt and pepper, it was ok. The sides were below par: mash poataoes came out luke warm, and i have frequently tasted much better. Sautéed mushrooms were a little bland. Lobster Macroni and cheese was dry and lacked the amount of lobster you usually find in this type of dish. Of course, the biggest problem with this resturuant is, that there are so many great steakhouses in Vegas, that you really have to do some extrodinary things to stand out from the pack....Unfortunately, Cornerstone does not do this. If your looking for a good modestly priced high end steakhouse, then I would recommend Goldcoast's sister property, The Orleans, and eat at their Alder & Birch Steakhouse (the food is much better, and prices are inline with Cornerstone). But if money is no object, then I would recommend one of the folllowing resturuants: Wynn SW Steakhouse, Del Frisco's, or Charlie Palmer (but again, these resturuants are much more expensive than Cornerstone or Alder & Birch). The bottom line is, that although Cornerstone is ok, there are better steakhouses out there within the same price range.",jylt6aurOs--IviJliM70w,5,1,3,lQYhkLNnxKcHBLar3zMehg
4301051,2016-09-11,1,BYp4NUxpwXCsTAoEmksLxA,"The people are very nice; however, the steaks are nothing close to what should be expected from the prices. The steak we had was bland. The Pork Porterhouse couldn't be eaten, and was sent back as it was as dry as cardboard. I didn't even want to exchange for another entree. The sides (green beans and Brussels sprouts) were not up to par.  Just go to Morton's or even Emeril's at MGM if you want much better steaks for the about the same price.  BTW, some people already knew what we found out. Saturday night and the place was empty.

Also, be very careful about the wine menu, hopefully to be corrected soon. The Decoy Merlot on the printed menu was stated at $42 a bottle (a bargain!) and after we ordered it, they came back to tell us that it was over $100.  A ""menu misprint,"" they said, and that it would soon be corrected. I suggested they run down to Kinkos and get it done asap.

We had the steak tartare,escargot,and crab cakes for starters. All superb. Salads and craft beer and cheese soup, to die for. Couldn't wait to see what the rest of the meal would be like. We were pretty full from the starters, so my son's gf and I split the beef tips in red wine, which was fantastic! My son had the 22 oz bone in rib eye,he was in heaven. 
Espresso and coffee to finish the meal also divine.  And got a piece of the chocolate espresso cake to go for later. Pure delight. Service was amazing. William our server was phenomenal. Drinks were fantastic. My son had the old fashioned and a whiskey flight. No complaints, nothing but praise for everything and everyone. Come here it's worth every penny! We will be back!!!!!",gXowCmzfiawHF147X0FPdA,1,0,5,aXa4lr8s1W39YmwIC43dZg

We had the steak sliders with sweet potato fries. $3 off the cocktails, which were really good: a blood orange Margarita and a chocolate martini.  Yum! Free veggies, olives, warm rolls! We had a really nice server, too. This place is lovely, and a real deal.",qKrq7Evr-p50bB0gUMWPHA,2,0,5,eW6xDx_L2ddix-yPB7Bnqg

They were friendly and attentive and really showed us a great time. Came in for some snacks and drinks and we will definitely be back. Had an amazing Old Fashioned and a great bottle of wine and some really good food off the bar menu.

5390955,2016-11-06,0,BYp4NUxpwXCsTAoEmksLxA,"Had some company from out of town and decided to try the new Cornerstone Steak House because of on-line article I read in a food Blog. I was very pleased with this restaurant. It's beautiful inside great bar area very comfortable. One of our guests texted that she was running late so we decided to wait in the Bar. What a great surprise because the young man behind the bar ""Brad"" was explaining what the process was for aging their house made ""Old Fashion"" whiskey. Aged over forty days in mini oak barrels with secret ingredients, I only remember the dried cherries but he was talking about this whiskey as if a proud father was talking about his only son scoring the winning touchdown at the collage bowl game. It's not offen you find a person with such pride in what they do for a living. Very refreshing and Brad not stuffy and up-tight. 

The food was great! The pickled carrots very refreshing with mixed olives, green beans and some mini gurkins, brought to the table with buttery hot bread really nice that we had more than just bread to pick on while we read our menus. The oysters, they were fresh and tasty the Roasted Beets & Tomato salad superb. The main course - I had the cedar plank salmon- it was perfectly cooked, so moist and flavorful. My husband had the 22 oz prime rib- it was perfection. Very flavorful sides of mushrooms, Green Beans and Mashed potatoes

The service was excellent they treated us with friendliness and warmth.

We felt the price was very fair! We paid just over $100.00 and had a lot of food. Can't say I had ever spent that little at a steak house ever.

Very pleased! Will be back!",Ie5JcsVJSWi5hmtfooaDow,2,1,5,XRY6FhLjDqN8ddkdGpkZhg
5433784,2018-01-08,1,BYp4NUxpwXCsTAoEmksLxA,"Came here on a whim. Looked like a nice spot from the reviews but was mislead.

Came here with two others o enjoy dinner and conversation. Our waiter was great and courteous; Gary was his name.

We order 3 apps: mussels, beef tartar and escargot. Everything tasted fresh but severely under seasoned and not memorable.

Entrees were: crab cakes, bone in ribeye and New York.
Crab cakes tasted fine, New York was decent and the ribeye was ordered charred med rare and came out medium with no seasoning; waiter refired the steak and came out MR with no seasoning again; not too sure what's happening.

Sides: baked potato, garlic spinach and lobster mac n cheese.

Potato was good, spinach lacked seasoning and tasted like burnt garlic and the lobster mac had NO lobster what so ever.. waiter said ""yes we have complaints abaout it not having any lobster""; then why don't you fix it rather keep sending out the same wrong preparation?

All in all I will not return. As mentioned in the beginning came on a whim and will leave it at that",iRuVZPnyeBpPeLBNZNFtjg,2,1,3,YxwrP4NydEF-h7MZCTY5Bg

5566650,2017-11-02,0,BYp4NUxpwXCsTAoEmksLxA,"My mom and I were in Vegas for her birthday and she loves to play Bingo so we ended up going to the Gold Coast. Cornerstone was one of their more upscale options in the hotel so we ended up making a reservation. I wasn't expecting too much, since the hotel is older and off the strip, but the food quality was really good and the service was great. 

They make their bread in house and it was incredibly soft and delicious to eat. It also came with cute little veggies and olives. The presentation was really nice. We ended up ordering the Filet Mignon and Lobster Mac and Cheese. The Filet Mignon was really tender and cooked well. It was flavorful, but not overwhelming. The Lobster Mac was not as cheesy and I would have preferred and to be honest it didn't taste like there was any lobster inside, but it was good if you're looking for just regular Mac and Cheese. I don't think I would go back, just because I prefer buffets / more trendy restaurants but it's a solid option if you're off the strip.

I will say their drinks were pretty good! I ordered a Mango Mojito and it was only $10!",3AcRAbHlcICvcwrWJD9bhg,0,0,4,klbxVOdwMOAqL_mNwALglQ
5597325,2017-07-28,3,BYp4NUxpwXCsTAoEmksLxA,"A mere handful of people in the place, stuffed inside a casino that's clearly seen better days. I think they were going for upscale, but like nearly all the food places in Vegas, this is one that's heavy on décor and atmosphere and trendy eye candy junk, but very light on actual food quality. The hot new trend, apparently, is to have sides that are for the tables and ordering one of these things will yield enough for 1, maybe a good solid 2 people tops. I ran into that head-on here and it's clear the gouging is going full boat now.

That aside, the steak was fairly acceptable, both in how it was cooked and in flavor, though it was described rather incorrectly in the menu. The beet salad was interesting, but, oddly, there was far too much of it for what should have been a small appetizer salad...I'm guessing they made a whole one and didn't know what to do with it, so just sent it out. Cheap booze also for the drinks, naturally. Iced tea was ok and the various sides that came with it, from the sweet potato to the asparagus, were all universally undercooked. I will say their olive selection was nice along with some of the appetizers, but you'd have to work to pooch pickled olives and the appetizers were also very much on the small side. Servers were ok in terms of friendliness but slow overall and it's endlessly entertaining to have to run and get a restroom key from the hostess every time you want to use the can. Not one of the better spots in Vegas, but it's closer to the norm than not.",orHVoIN1Oj_rK3KDqcGBIQ,1,0,3,wT5InmP2g2B-exLs0GLQDA
5646229,2016-10-24,1,BYp4NUxpwXCsTAoEmksLxA,"This restaurant is a complete waste of money. This is suppose to be a high end restaurant, I was not impressed at all. First off they required a reservation for an empty restaurant. So I waited 2 hours. Approximately 30% of the place was full. The hostess seats me, then another person ask me if I wanted anything to drink. I just wanted water. So another person brings me sink water with no ice. Then another person brings me a bread plate, this was the best part of the whole evening. Then another person comes to the table to take my food order,  I ordered the large cut prime rib (medium) and my wife ordered the baked chicken and we decided to split an order of the garlic fries. I thought they would be a generous portion considering they cost 6 bucks. 45 minutes later,  a different person brings the rib and the chicken out, then someone else brought out the fries about 6 minutes later. Ok, the prime rib had no flavor and was not slow cooked at all, very tough for the price. I had to ask for horseradish, which took another 6 minutes. The bake chicken was nice, but I can find that on any buffet in Vegas. Nothing special at all about it. Now for the fries, these bastards brought me a medium order of McDonald's fries with a spoonful of raw garlic on top. That was the worst experience that I have ever had. The only reason I didn't complain was because the complete meal cost about 62.85. I had a coupon for 60 bucks. I gave the waitress the bill and 8 bucks and told her to have a nice night. So please, do not waste your time with this place.",o4pDJnQwWeBRkTeEL2jrfg,2,0,1,XbKN2I160u7GkfrDVqZq2w
5774228,2018-04-28,1,BYp4NUxpwXCsTAoEmksLxA,"Cornerstone is the steakhouse in the Gold Coast casino. They have a nice happy hour menu and drink specials from 4-6pm. My group had reservations at 6pm in the dining area so we didn't partake in HH.

Service was very good, waiter was there as we sat, bread tray complete with veggies arrived shortly thereafter. They have some interesting cocktails, I highly recommend the Filthy Cherry Mule...dangerously good.

I went with the medium Prime Rib at $29 which was a huge cut of meat 2 inches thick and ranging close to 20 oz....I wonder how big is the large??? My friends ordered the Pork Porterhouse and the Beef Short Rib. In hindsight I should have gone short ribs as the exterior of my prime rib was delicious and juicy, but it got a bit chewy towards the center. 

Service on point the entire night. No issues there. We all had a great time. My friend had a gift certificate for $150 from comps....so 4 of us enjoyed a great meal for $18 and tip. Can't beat that!",wXZS42D0L8hoCiSh2Krc_A,3,4,4,ieVcVrOHQlJCgVLe9w0P3Q
5898727,2016-09-22,2,BYp4NUxpwXCsTAoEmksLxA,"We were mailed a $100 dining credit and decided to check this place out. We arrived at the restaurant a couple minutes before our 8pm reservation and was promptly seated. It looked to be a very busy night. We later found out from our server, Stephanie, it was extra busy due to the special $100 off promotion (great marketing!).

Once seated, it took a while for Stephanie to greet us, but in the mean time we were served water, bread and crudite. When she finally came over, she was very bubbly and friendly. She took our drink and appetizer orders. She highly recommended the Old Fashion which my fiance thought ""wasn't that special--just tastes like how an Old Fashion should taste"". We ordered the Oysters on the Half Shell (1/2 dozen). The oysters were nice and briny, a bit on the small side, but delicious nonetheless.

Before our entrees, we ordered the Beets & Teardrop Tomatoes Salad. Yellow and Red Beets on a sparse bed of arugula, topped with goat cheese and walnuts, and drizzled with a balsamic vinaigrette. The beets (especially the yellow) were nice and sweet. It was a well made dish. It looked like we made a good decision to order a salad before our entrees. We noticed the two tables next to us waiting for quite sometime for their food. We saw Stephanie apologizing and reassuring them that their food would be out soon.

For our entrees, we order the Cornerstone Prime Rib Crown Steak (similar to a Rib Cap) with the Peppercorn and Diane (red wine reduction) sauces, Filet Mignon with Bearnaise sauce, sauteed mushrooms and roasted cauliflower. I would have to agree with previous reviews when it comes to the seasoning of the steaks. We ordered both our steaks at Medium Rare. The Rib Crown came out at more of a Medium to Medium Well temperature while my filet's temperature was perfect. All the sauces tasted great and a roasted garlic was served with the steaks--perhaps for presentation--but we ended up having to use it to flavor our side. The sauteed mushrooms were tasty but the roasted cauliflower lacked flavor. My fiance and I had a long conversation about the cauliflower. If that cauliflower was ""roasted"" it didn't translate that way. It was very soft as if it was boiled or steamed too long and was not seasoned at all. Perhaps that should have been taken care of with the panko, parsley, hard boiled egg topping that was sprinkled on top. We ended up using our sauces and roasted garlic to flavor the cauliflower.

For dessert we order the Plantains Foster, Limoncello Cake, and a coffee. The Plantains Foster was big and good if you like plantains and don't miss the traditional taste of the bananas (a little more tart than sweet--expected from plantains). The sauce was very thick, the praline ice cream was really good, and the plantain chips as garnish were nice and crisp. The Limoncello Cake was served with a shot of Limoncello and whipped cream with fresh berries. The cake had great lemon flavor and was nice and moist. We were not fans of the Limoncello shot. Because the shot is strong, the dessert really could have done without it or perhaps some sort of Limoncello syrup (to get it sweeter and not as harsh) could have been drizzled over it.

Overall, the experience was a bit disappointing. Under seasoned meat, incorrect temperature, bland sides. We finished our cocktails with our salad and ended up playing with our water cups for sometime since they were empty during our entire main course. My fiance has a pet peeve about ""up-selling"". At a higher end steakhouse, when offered an accompaniment, it is not necessary for the server to mention the price: ""Would you like to add a lobster tail? It's only $23"". We had more than enough time to review the menu and ordered exactly what we wanted. And to mention the price (which is clearly indicated on the menu) was a little tacky. The service was slow but that could have been due to the special promotion. The restaurant is nicely decorated (I don't know what the previous Cortez Room looked like) and the servers were very friendly. The promotion was worth it, but I would not recommend this steakhouse to any of my friends.",6THXbAhvo60OGr-1lwSeLA,6,1,2,zTGl-DBuO6g_D7aeCc-Bkw
