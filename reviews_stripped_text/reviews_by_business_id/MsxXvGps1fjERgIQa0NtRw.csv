The greens and yams were good, but the chicken was old and rubbery and I had to spit a huge piece of it out onto a napkin. . I ordered to go,  so i ate the food at home. I left a tip ( I shouldn't have).  I won't eat here again.",l7FqDJsvS5E7FTtUUKQXZQ,0,0,2,FSG_FY_LhATifS_NAgFPqA
1279716,2016-10-05,0,MsxXvGps1fjERgIQa0NtRw,This is the worst restaurant. I don't know how they expect to be good for the neighborhood when they play their music on the outside of their restaurant. They play it so loud and sometimes on a microphone and it is so loud that it is very distorted. Not sure how they think this helps business because this is very disturbing for the neighborhood and very awkward when eating here. Music would be fine if it is just kept inside the restaurant. This is definitely not bringing customers to the restaurant if anything it is turning them away especially those who live near the restaurant. Disturbing noise is just frustrating and quite frankly don't think everyone should have to hear their disturbing noise.,IH7hrB_SiRAPzVpDcfwpEA,0,0,1,_Vo-jhrCWbcNhUenfKDrGw
1355466,2016-04-07,0,MsxXvGps1fjERgIQa0NtRw,My boyfriend asked if I wanted to eat soul food so I thought the place would be good. When I got here I was so disappointed. The building is old and run down and the inside looks even worse and the smell inside ahh disgusting. I only ordered chicken fingers and fries cuz if you've never been anywhere that should be the safest thing to eat. And there were some ignorant people in the establishment and and the workers did not say anything. I will not be returning here ever again.,9uvN0FyGV6vWkssq2UfFzQ,0,0,1,4wHKPPGJD4vaOMkBsYkH-Q

You could tell it was a family restaurant. I would definitely go back for breakfast and am planning on trying dinner there. Having just moved to the area it was good to find a locally owned and operated place with good food and great service.",9WjN39JLwFczoq68g-InDg,0,0,5,6nkvyG4U65e0CFdTQe1fQA

Coffee tasted old and it wasn't even hot. The spicy tamale was not even decent.....",aGmlTtYgZVbMdEj961Tuig,0,0,2,WqX7QPdxR-yEiDqoT2jiRQ
