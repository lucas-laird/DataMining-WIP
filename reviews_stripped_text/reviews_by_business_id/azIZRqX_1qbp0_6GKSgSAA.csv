First off, the table we had requested for our birthday party was not given to us because they decided we wouldn't like it and didn't ask us if it was okay, they just tried to sit us somewhere different. When we finally were seated in the correct area (next to the table we really wanted) we thought the night would go smoothly from there, it didn't. We've been here in both busy and non-busy times and always had a great experience. But this time because it was such bad service we only stayed for 1 round of food and drinks instead of our normal 3-4. When we mentioned it to the hostess in a discreet manor she just said ""ok"".

Sushi was subpar not even close to the best I've had - mediocre, soy sauce is not real (some substitute waitress told us about), BBQ came out cold, ice cream was mush and lava cake was cold, service from waitress was slow and inattentive, water was never refilled, coffee not refilled - get the gist? 

I've eaten there two other times and it was okay -now it's downhill -the menu change is terrible, bad choice.

Both rolls had 6 very small pieces and I couldn't even taste the fish because there was a lot of sticky rice. The lobster spring roll and crispy calamari were small in size too which makes me wonder how much is on a plate at regular price.  We also ordered the kurobata pork and that was pretty good.

However, the hostess walked us over to the sushi bar, even after I requested no sushi bar seating, so we declined.  We walked out and dined at the its lounge area instead.  The Japonais lounge area is right smack in a busy crossing area for people going/leaving the casino area.  We were people-watching while waiting for our food.

We were pleasantly surprised that it was much more comfortable to eat here (in a chaise/sofa) instead of the dine-in area.  It feels more romantic, most likely due to the draperies, low lighting, faux trees, and sound of waterfalls.  The full menu and bar selections are also available in the lounge area.  The restaurant also allows the convenience of charging your bill to your hotel - as long as it's part of the MGM hotel line (We stayed at the Bellagio) 

As for food, it's no different than the one in Chicago.

First off, the staff has some eye candy that definitely kept us intrigued during dinner. The service was very good, though the kitchen could do a lot better in timing the food. I have dined out enough to know to stagger my orders so that everything will arrive with proper time in between, but our entrees took almost 45 min. after being ordered to be delivered, which was disappointing. Our server was excellent and greeted me by name each time she came to the table. The food was excellent albeit a bit pricey, but that's what you expect in Vegas. For their famed skewers, we got the shrimp and scallop, chilean sea bass, steak, and sliders.  The scallops were perfectly cooked and the flavor of the sea bass was spot on. Maybe the best I've had. Their ""rock"" appetizer was interesting, though I'd have to say it smelled better cooking that the meat actually tasted. And quite pricey at $18 for 9 tiny super thin slices of meat. But it was all the ""rock"". The short rib entree was good, but the apple au jus sauce it was paired with was probably the best thing I have tasted. We all wanted to lick the plate. And it was paired with a sweet potato puree, that was probably the tastiest mashed potatoes I've had in ages.

Shout-out to Chef Tom who stopped by to check on how everything was for us! He was awesome, super friendly, answered all of our questions, participated in all of our banter, and even showed us some of his favorite fish and preps they had previously done in their restaurant (there was a creepy fish with glow-in-the-dark eyes, WHAT??).

484519,2007-08-06,0,azIZRqX_1qbp0_6GKSgSAA,"A classy restaurant with a hint of eccentric and abstraction. Lighted pillars, abstract bonsai tree centerpiece, large mirrors of different sizes filled the walls. Take note of the dress code of the staff and the Japanese inspired cuisine with European hints. Sushi chef: collared shirt and tie; server: collared shirt, vest and tie, busers and cocktail servers: mandarin collared. The last time I checked Mandarin collars were Chinese and the chefs definitely looked like Chinese cooks. Not that I'm complaining, it was just quite interesting.

Again the food reflected Chinese influences, not that the food was not great. For example, the Kani Kani, directly translate to ""Crab Crab"" was a very Cantonese dim sum dish. A crab mousse wrapped around a crab leg then deep fried with a passion fruit sauce. The fried coat did not drown out the sweetness of the crab. What happened to the European influences? Either way, the food had flavor, eye appeal, filling. Please try their signature, Mediterranean inspired Tuna Flatbread, olives, cheese, tuna, shichimi. Madai Mushi, is sake poached Madai, seared Diver Scallops with stewed Japanese Eggplant and a Black bean sauce was flavorful and tender. My friend had the Wagyu Toban which is Wagyu beef served in a miniature hotpot. The Wagyu was quite flavorful and tender. Definitely try the sushi. I only tried the Otoro, which was the best I've had. Once in my mouth, the flesh melted like butter, literally. The dessert did not disappoint; Kobacha Cheesecake, five-spice pineapple mousse and an almond tuile. The light airy texture of the mousse balanced well with the dense cheesecake and the crispy cookie. The dish was not overly sweet and the complex flavors matched well, a great ending to a great meal.

Our server was great. He was easy going, comedic, helpful and attentive. Most of the time servers are quite uptight with professionalism. Professionalism is great but diners like a fun time also. He kept tabs on us and returned at the perfect time. When we needed something, we look up and he was there; the glass was never emptied. He showed us a great time.

It seems like the menu has changed.  Some things I used to love like the kobe beef sliders, which were AMAZING, are now gone.  Replaced by some angus beef excuse for a menu item that was really disappointing.  It may not be their fault for moving things off the menu, but it's very disconcerting for a patron that comes to eat here pretty frequently and expects to eat the food they were hoping to eat.

Secondly, the service has always been phenomenal also, but on this last trip our food took literally ONE HOUR to arrive from after we ordered it.  I don't care how fancy a restaurant is, that is too long to wait.  On top of that, the only thing I wanted off of the now limited menu was the short ribs which ""they were out of"". sigh.

I would love to give this beautiful restaurant that has amazing food a higher rating but for a Celiac this place was a challenge.

First of all the menu is very small, and they do not have a specific allergen menu. Most of the dishes had already been marinated in soy sauce with gluten, thus eliminating most of the best dishes. So no Seabass or fish.

I had the Rock, which was thinly sliced steak that you cook on a hot rock and that was fantastic. Then I had a side of white rice with gluten free soy, and the asparagus robota. 

The boyfriend was absolutely thrilled with his beautiful Seabass dinner, and my sides were great, but it was just sides.

Hub and I were in Vegas for his 30th birthday.  He's was a Vegas virgin and the Mirage was basically giving him money.   We're not into the club scene so we were basically there to gamble, eat, drink and gamble.

It was time to take a break from the gambling and we opted to try Japonais, since the cash was flowing like the hair of Rapunzel.  We sat in the front lounge - it  was still very early by Vegas standards and I am pretty sure the actual restaurant was empty but we didn't have a reservation so were pointed to the lounge.

We had two of the special rolls to start and they were both fantastic.

Japonais is a mood altering good vibe having sexy place to chill with dim lighting, friendly bartenders, a great chef who cooks in front of you at the bar or intimate little nooks to curl up in and people watch, etc.

If you're here between 10pm and 1am, order some robata skewers cooked over high quality bincho tan (Japanese white charcoal that emits no smoke or other flavors so you get the realest most pure taste possible).  Simply amazing. Who knew food tasted so good?

Atmosphere - Looks like you're about to eat in a bar in the lobby of a casino, until you find the main entrance. Nice enough decor. Music too loud.

Service - Helpful and well-versed with the menu offerings

Dishes
Sashimi carpaccio - The reason this is a four star review. The Akami with garlic sauce was stellar. Toro was divine.

Hamachi ""Hawaiian style"" (very slightly seared) - Great quality. Sauce was well-balanced.

Crispy shrimp and salmon roll - Nicely done with the tride and true combo of shrimp tempura and avacado with a layer of salmon on the outside. Nothing you couldn't get at your local sushi purveyor.

Lobster spring rolls - Eh. Couldn't taste the lobster.

Drinks - Nigori sake (can't really mess that up) and Cucumber martini. The drink wasn't overly sweet, but it was not to die for either.",Vn7ewMKsmAbH3pu74ONmeg,1,0,4,ubfBor6qFX93NwL1Sg6qlQ

We started with cocktails: the house specialty (some 'orchid' drink), and a dirty martini. Martini was good, as expected. The house specialty was blah and far from special.

Next we moved onto the lobster spring rolls, which aren't japanese, but we thought it sounded interesting and we'd give it a try. Although you did really taste the lobster, they were very oily.

We tried the spicy yellowtail chef's special roll -- it sounded like the blend of citrus and yellowtail and spicy would be delicious. Very disappointing indeed. Mellow fish met mellow flavors and very little spice. Aside from the jalapenos in the dressing on top, there was not even a hint of spice.

Lastly, we had the Le Quack, based off a review on Yelp. Although the duck was flavorful, it was again very sweet. And again, not japanese. It was basically peking duck with mu-shu/tacos.

Perhaps we should have stuck to plain sashimi or nigiri or tempura, but we didn't come here to have something we could get at home. And we left longing for good japanese food.

779573,2012-08-12,1,azIZRqX_1qbp0_6GKSgSAA,"Very disappointed by me and my friend's experience at Japonais. For a fine dining restaurant and the price that I paid, I expected better. 

First of all, let me start by saying that I'm not a fine dining connoisseur, and I don't do fine dining on a regular basis. However, when I do, I expect food to be at least decent and service to be better than what I can get at my local Denny's.

I went to Japonais because my friend suggested it, having been here before a few times, and because it was Restaurant Week.  The restaurant itself is very nice and dark, with a relaxing atmosphere. I ordered the Robota steak skewer as an appetizer, Salmon Japonais, and Chocolate Mousse Cake. My friend ordered The Rock, Rice Casserole for a side dish, and wanted the Braised Short Ribs, but the waitress informed her that the kitchen didn't have any short ribs for the night and suggested that she get the rib eye steak. 

When I ordered the Robota steak skewer, I was thinking it was going to be more than one skewer for appetizer or a long skewer, but the waitress literally brought out a huge plate for one tiny skewer with 3 pieces of meat and pieces of onions and peppers. I mean, I know it's fine dining and all, but $8 for a skewer of meat that tastes like it was grilled on my dad's barbeque grill in his backyard, are you kidding me? However, I thought that The Rock appetizer with the raw slices of beef that you can grill on the heated rock was very unique and fun though. 

My Salmon Japonais was somewhat better. The salmon was a little bit overcooked and dry for my taste, but the presentation was lovely. I wish there would've been a bit more curry sauce though. My friend, on the other hand, was very disappointed with her steak. It was literally just a piece of steak and potato puree on the side. The steak was OK, but the potato puree tasted really weird, too much garlic and the texture was almost like it came from a box. The steak came with a peppery dipping sauce that my friend didn't like, so she asked the waitress if the chef could make a red wine sauce. 

This is when things got weird. The waitress told us that the chef couldn't or wouldn't make the red wine sauce because ""we make everything from our own recipes, so a red wine sauce is like stealing another restaurant's recipe or idea"" or some excuse like that. I think that when dining out, especially in fine dining, if the customer is unhappy, the least the chef could do is rectify the problem. It's not as if my friend was asking for something outrageous, with the full bar they have, I'm pretty sure they have red wine somewhere. Then she suggested KETCHUP and SRIRACHA to my friend as a steak sauce. I'm sorry, but never in all my years of dining have I ever heard of eating steak with ketchup and hot sauce. My friend was so disappointed by the situation that she didn't want to finish the steak or her rice casserole (which came 30 minutes after we got our main dishes so I'm sure they forgot about it). 

My friend almost never complains about service and keeps quiet, and she's been here before and loved it, but even she thought this experience was bad and requested to talk to the manager. After waiting about 15 minutes, the manager came over to talk to us. He apologized for the food and wait time, and blamed the computer system crashing for my friend's horrible experience (I'm not sure how not being able to process credit cards and crappy food are correlated, but alright), then comped my friend's meal. The reason why I'm giving Japonais 2 stars is because the manager did acknowledge the problems and apologize, which we appreciated. 

Dessert was pretty forgettable, and I left with $60 less in my wallet and feeling a bit hungry. Perhaps it was just a bad night that we came on, but I want to give Japonais a second chance, just not with my money.",g4GA0o1DRARHKGhmxkiSBQ,2,1,2,Jc9U9HHIj5Ry3JGeo2u-Ig

I am a HUGE fan of Sushi/Sashimi and for some reason, never had any desire to check out the Japonais in NYC. It's partially due to the reviews I've read about it along with it just looking like another place that is all show but no substance. Don't get me wrong, I like going to places that offers eye candy but if you're gonna charge me for it, at least justify it with the food you offer which is something I never felt Japonais offered.

Welp, after dining at the Vegas location, my reasons were confirmed. It's pricey for the quality and quantity offered. Being that it was my hun's birthday weekend, my hun was craving for sushi and wanted to give 'em a try and so, I appeased, albeit reluctantly.

I've been to the Japonais in Chicago a dozen times, and like it for their outside patio which sits on the Chicago river.  The prices are similar there, but the whole experience just blends better, since it is a much prettier space.

Their Mirage location was quite a let down.  The low tables in the bar are comfy to come sit for a drink, but they don't make for a very comfortable meal  I would rather be sitting on pillows on the floor, or at a normal table.  

The food in the bar is not a full menu either, which really limits your order.  When I've gone, I stick to a few basic rolls, and the hot rock appetizer.  A scorching hot rock comes out with delicately sliced Kobe beef.  You cook the beef on the rock yourself, which is both fun and delicious.

Besides that appetizer though, there isn't a whole lot that shines here.  The drinks are as expensive as you would imagine at a place like this in a hotel ($14 a cocktail roughly).  I think there is way better sushi, ambience, and value at many other sushi spots in town.

1265134,2011-05-31,0,azIZRqX_1qbp0_6GKSgSAA,"Japonais is a personal favorite and I have done a bee-line here the last three times I have been in Las Vegas. The concept is Japanese/French fusion. People can say what they will about fusion. But if you're going to fuse two cultures together at dinner, it's hard to go wrong with those of France and Japan. I have had the opportunity to try significant portions of the menu, and gravitate towards the sushi.

My favorites among a few categories...

Maki Mono: Panko Shrimp
Hot Appetizer: Sweet and Sour Calamari
Main Course: Tuna Steak  

Specifics aside, everything on the menu is, at minimum, very good. The worst thing I can say about Japonais is that its best offerings are overrated. Case in point, its more notorious specialties - like the tuna tuna salmon and the lobster spring rolls - have actually been among my least favorite. Especially the former. But again, the menu is very good overall.",d2JRE-YQgW4hBvuhIYVxDA,1,0,4,nRGSl8EkL2Ba7H1-lByuig

1302755,2013-06-11,1,azIZRqX_1qbp0_6GKSgSAA,"THE SETTING: My dad's first dinner in Las Vegas. We had to find a classy fine dining establishment before our audiovisual extravaganza at Beatles Love, and Japonais fit the bill.

THE SCENE: 5:30 PM dinner; we were the first guests. Loved the interior - lots of dark wood and soft lighting.

THE DRINKS: Pitch-perfect dirty martini for me, a dry no-olive martini for dad (recent stroke resulting in a dramatic cutback in salt intake), a cucumber-lemon concoction for my wife. The drinks were perfect: just the right degree of cold, a thin layer of lenticular ice particles adrift on the top, crisp, balanced.

THE SUSHI: Although I did not have any, my wife almost growled with pleasure at every morsel, and she is a sushi aficionado of high caliber.

THE STEAK: Perfectly rare, aged ribeye, bone-in. I ate every scrap of mine, as did my dad. The sweet potato fries were the only sub-perfect component - this is one of the few things I would have changed, perhaps substituted a small salad.

THE SERVICE: This may have been due to the fact that we were the only customers for the first half-hour, but we had our own busboy in addition to the waiter, and the GM came over to inquire personally how we were doing. This led into a charming conversation about her history in Vietnam, of fleeing the country and working her way up in the United States. This led to a lot of pleasant discussion between her and my father, who served on an aircraft carrier, and who was personally against the war. She was happy to please us, and we were happy to be pleased!

The timing of all dishes went well, the kitchen put a hold on the sushi such that it began arriving the same time as the steaks. An extra-special EXCELLENT to the kitchen and staff for making sure that dad's food and martini were nigh-saltless; just a pinch for flavor. 

It says a lot of good things about a restaurant that when you mention a dietary restriction, they hold to it 100% through the meal.

The boyfriend and I flew into Vegas and were absolutely STARVING when we checked into the mirage. We came and were seated in the lounge which had a beautiful view of Mirage's indoor waterfall and ""jungle"" center.

Our server was very nice and helpful. Off the happy hour menu we ordered:

Lobster Spring Rolls- Delicious and you can actually taste the lobster

Sweet and Sour Calamari - a nice change from your average calamari. 

Hamachi Roll - a simple hamachi maki 6pcs

Unagi and Avocado roll - a little sweeter than your normal unagi roll but still very fresh 6pcs

Teriyaki Drummettes - on the salty side. this would be the one item I'd suggest you pass on.. comes with a side of blue ranch

Crab Cakes - very good for $7. Not the best crab crakes but still very good. (You only get one.. so I don't know why I'm saying Cake(s)).

A glass for Chardonnay
""The Red One"" - A passion fruit martini
Asahi Light ($4)
Cucumber cooler - a nice twist on a mojito

The food was actually very good. Although the portions are obviously smaller then if ordered from the dinner menu, we were both stuffed half way through our meal. 

You must try the lobster spring rolls and the sweet and sour calamari. (I'll upload pictures)

1349646,2008-10-06,2,azIZRqX_1qbp0_6GKSgSAA,"It's kind of funny that I go to Japonais in Las Vegas instead of the one here in Chicago.  I kind of knew going into the place that everything was kind of fu-fu and upscale.  But you know how Vegas is, everything is in excess.  As we walked into Japonais and sat down, I noticed that there weren't a lot of people there just yet, I figured we were just early.  People started filing in as we were finishing up dinner.  

Everything was very well put together, all the dishes, tables, aesthetics were very pleasing.  I took a few photographs of some of the floral arrangements they had.  We ordered the Chef's special roll which was a salmon and tempura shrimp roll, we also ordered ""the rock"" which is thin slices of kobe beef that you cook yourself on a hot rock that lies on a bed of salt.  Pretty neat and tasty.  The chef's special roll was pretty good, very fresh and the rock was pretty good as well.  For our entrees we got the Kobe Beef, the Red Snapper and the Grilled Hamachi.  

All of the dishes were well prepared and presented very well.  The Kobe Beef was my favorite, the beef was perfectly cooked and seasoned the mashed potatoes had some kick to it and the asparagus was perfectly cooked also.  All around great dish, only drawback was that there were only 4 pieces...:(.  My Grilled hamachi was pretty good too, I wasn't sure what kind of fish Hamachi was, it is a white fish that's got a mild flavor and texture.  The broth that came with the Hamachi was great, there were also these fried shrimp dumplings that went perfectly with the Hamachi.  My wife's Red Snapper dish was pretty good as well, again perfectly cooked and prepared.

All in all, great atmosphere and food, I wouldn't expect anything less than a restaurant/bar that's located in the Mirage hotel and casino.  However, I did take off a star because of the waiter who was kind of sneering at my order of Coke as my drink since I'm allergic to alcohol.

We had a party of seven girls and were seated immediately with our reservation.  We each got either a miso soup ($6) or house salad ($8).  Don't get the miso- it's the smallest bowl ever!!!  The salad however was really good and fresh- the dressing was really flavorful.  We got the royal sushi sampler ($300) which had a few rolls, uni, ikura, and a selection of sashimi.  Overall, it was pretty fresh although the tako was extremely fishy.  The food itself I would rate 4/5.

Now let's to get why this experience was horrible: we ordered.  we got our appetizer.  then we waited.  FOR OVER AN HOUR to get our sushi.  I was extremely annoyed with the service.  I guess the other tables all ordered sushi (big surprise since 1/2 the menu is sushi) and the sushi chefs were backed up.  At some point, the waitress did come by to tell us we still had another 20 OR 30 minutes left to wait.  We were already starving at that time.  So she went back to check and confirmed it was still going to take at least 20 minutes.  I was really annoyed that at this point they didn't offer to bring anything in the meantime.  It's not like I was looking for free food but how can you make us wait an hour in between our soup/salad and our entree.  It's also not like we were warned before ordering that it would take so long.  I did end up requesting they bring some like edamame because the wait was so long and the waitress had to 'go and ask' about it.  Eventually, 20 minutes later we were graced with edamame.  Then we had to wait like another 20 minutes to get our sushi.

Like I said, the sushi was good.  But for the horrible service and the $$$, I don't think I'll be coming back.  If you have the convenience to go to eat sushi off the strip, go to Sushi House Goyemon.

The standout of the night was hands down, UNI, which was exceptionally, as Rachel Ray would annoyingly say, ""Yum-O.""  Its a must try.  I ordered Kobe beef (the shoulder part) and as expected, it was a little more tough.  But honestly, it tasted like the cheap beef my mom cooks when she is in a rush to feed us kids.

The restaurant itself has a great setting.  We opted for a lounge type table in the bar area so we could check out the casino action while we were eating.  Japonaise also has a formal dining room as well if you're looking for more of a normal dinner setting.  Dining room was very nice and not cramped.  There was music going in the lounge where we ate but it wasn't too loud so the setting was perfect.

Now on to the food....just awesome.  We tried a bunch of rolls, all exceptional, some nigiri which was very fresh and delicious, we had a few skewers which were all fantastic, and we had that hot rock where you cook your own beef which was awesome and fun to try.  Freaking love this place!!!  Cocktails were very good as well.

When it was all said and done, $340 for four people so pretty good value too for a high end restaurant in Vegas like this.  We had a ton of food and two drinks each so getting out for under a hundo a person ain't too shabby!

1470305,2010-09-30,0,azIZRqX_1qbp0_6GKSgSAA,"I was really craving Japanese food and through some Yelp searching, we found out that they actually have a happy hour where some of their appetizers and drinks are discounted. Yes, in one of the major hotels and on the strip. You immediately think its probably some scam where that the happy hour (HH)  times are like from 7am to 11am, but the HH times are actually normal times from 2pm to 8pm. In fact, I think the happy hour times are better than most of the bars at home. So Japonais it is!

The location for Japonais is simply awesome! If you sit in the lounge area, its on the outer edge of the Atrium in the middle of the Mirage hotel. So as your eating and drinking, you have an excellent view of garden with 80s music playing in the background. Sounds odd, but you kinda feel like your at some beach resort instead of in the middle of the desert.

After having a bad experience at Shibuya (in MGM) on a previous trip, I though I would change my strategy on my visit to Japonais. We realized getting sushi in the middle of the desert where there isn't much water around was probably a stupid idea. So to change things up, we ordered mostly non-sushi type items.

* Crab Cakes (got at Happy Hour) - For the happy hour pricing, you only get a single crab cake which isn't bad because I was looking to try a variety of things that evening. You should know it is Crab with a C not K. Yes, real crab and it was very tasty.

* Calamari (HH) - I was looking for something like panko crusted calamari, but instead we got pan fried calamari with two sauces: sweet and sour sauce and wasabi vinaigrette. Different and yet good.

* Yellowtail Roll (HH)  - We got some sushi (OK, not sushi but a roll) just to compare it with quality of Shibuya. I was expecting one of those horrible rolls drenched in mayo that you might find in a non-Japanese owned sushi joint. Instead, we got a very traditional roll. Yellowtail in the middle with a simple rice and nori on the outside... something my mom might have made. To top it off, the fish was good and better than Shibuya in my opinion.

* ""The Rock"" - This was a pretty cool table presentation. Basically they bring out a rock at like 500+ degrees sitting on a bed of salt with thinly sliced marinated new york strip steak on another plate. You take the steak and place it on the super hot rock for 3-4 seconds on each side and it cooks the meat right before your eyes. The meat was tender and great. Only draw back is you need to eat this fast otherwise by the time you get to the last one, the rock starts to get cold and it takes longer to cook. Still, an awesome idea and it was a hit.

* sweet shrimp and diver scallop (robata) - the scallop was OK, but the shrimp was very large (more like a prawn) and it came to the table with head and all. Very tasty!

* pork skewer - Not bad. Was average.


My experience redeemed the Japanese experience in Vegas. I will admit, I still haven't signed off on getting sushi in the middle of the desert because seems like a stupid idea to begin with... Its hard to get fresh fish without being near the ocean.

This is Japonais.

My wife and I go here every time we travel to Las Vegas, even though we always stay at the Palazzo. We always sit in the lounge as we find the actual restaurant area to be a bit dull. We really miss the second, quieter lounge area that was taken over by Tom Calicchio's restaurant, which was our favorite place to eat every single time. But the louder lounge area is still such a nice getaway, especially knowing that the casino floor is right next to us.

We have never had anything bad here. My wife loves the crispy shrimp and salmon roll. I'm not the biggest sushi fan and I have to admit that this is pretty good. But I'm not the best judge of this. I am a much better judge of the miso soup, which is one of my favorite things to order because I feel that it is really similar to rice and beans at a Mexican restaurant. If they can nail this, it shows that they understand the basics. The miso soup at Japonais is spectacular.

The Rock was amazing: super thin slices of New York steak marinated and served raw. The diner then cooks the meat in less than a minute on a hot rock. Fun to prepare and even better to eat. And then anything from the Robata is delicious, but we just ordered the sliders this time, which are the juiciest little burgers I have ever tried.

I told the BF to have a taste to make sure I wasn't going crazy and he concurred, so I brought it to the bartender's attention.  Instead of checking the 7-up and giving me a whole new drink, she simply poured some of the liquid out of my glass (I only had two sips) and topped it off with more BAD 7-UP!!!

For two main reasons.

1.  They water down their alcohol
2.  They pre-make all of their sushi

I'd heard that Japonais was overrated, but my friends made a reservation so I decided to join.  We started with some edamame and ""the rock"".  Edamame was good, and ""the rock"" was pretty cool.  I loved being able to cook some tasty meat on a steaming hot rock.  But that's where the fun ended.

I originally thought that my saki-tini was really smooth, until I finished it and realized I wasn't the slightest bit buzzed.  I told my friend and she agreed and offered a sip of her Bacardi-Seven.  Ummm, yeah, I don't know what hers was but there was only an essence of alcohol in it.  At this point I'd already ordered a manhattan (my standard).  When I got it, it had good color, like they mixed it right, but when I tasted it, it was weak.  That sucks.  If I'm paying $14 for a drink, at least put real alcohol in it.

I ordered 5 pieces of nigiri - 2 pieces of uni, 1 piece of fluke, 1 piece of medium fatty tuna and 1 piece of snapper.  Apparently, they used the last piece of snapper for my friend's sashimi, so I had to choose something else.  (Oh, btw, it's 7:00pm.  WTF???  You're already out of fish?  There are not that many options on the menu!)  So I ordered the soy-marinated salmon at the recommendation of our server.  Overall, the fish was relatively fresh, but nothing special.  For a meal of 5 pieces of nigiri, some edamame and 1/4 of ""the rock"", I paid $80.  I should have been having foodgasms for that.  I wasn't.

Throughout the meal, all of these huge plates of sushi (both rolls and nigiri) were passing us by.  At first I thought there might have been a private party, until my friend reminded me of the disclaimer on the menu saying that it might take longer for sashimi, as they make it fresh.

Sort of exciting to be in Vegas and see one and check it out with someone who is down with Japanese food.  We had to wait 20 minutes for our table so we sat at the bar and ordered a drink.  My drink was yummy but The Mr. had to send his back and order something different because the bartender made it wrong. The feel of the lounge was pretty cool and I was looking forward to getting seated. 

When we were seated, they brought us to a section that was more towards the casino and didn't have the lounge feel at all. 

I did order the lotus blossom drink, their signature cocktail and yes it was pretty good. $14 good, ehhh maybe but only because I was excited after just seeing LOVE. 

We decided to split a miso, a salmon roll and ahi tuna. A baby could have eaten our food and still would have been hungry.

Decor 
Lots of dark wood.  A fantastic faux tree stood in the middle.  Watch out for the poor construction of the chairs-a guy fell out of his chair the night we dined here.  

Cocktails
Skip La Rouge, sticky sweet concoction.  Terrible.  Loved the Sake martini and their signature cocktail with the edible orchid floating atop.  

Service
Friendly service and they will cater to your every whim.  I sent back the cocktail and the manager came by to make sure that everything else was going well.  Received numerous thanks and farewells from the staff.

Food

Sashimi: Akami, Chutoro & Toro.  
HUGE slices, but also HUGE prices.  All were excellent & fresh.

Kobe Carpaccio
Ultra thin slices of beef, just as I like it, but I thought all the whole peppercorns, wasabi, garlic, really took away from the flavors of the beef.  I could barely see the meat because of the TOPPINGS.  

Tuna Tuna Salmon Roll
I was expecting Tuna on top with Salmon in the middle.  What I got: Tuna on the top of a ball of crumbling rice, and NON-EXISTENT salmon.  Me no likey.  Flavors were good, description & execution BAD.

Side of broccolini
Cooked in lemon juice and nothing else, probably a little oil also.  Healthy, but totally off.  I like my broccolini with some garlic, no lemon, it ain't a fish!  Also, some of the stems were more overcooked than others, based on the yellow color shown instead of the dark green.

Grilled Hamachi
Yuck.  Dry as heck.  Like swordfish.  If I wanted swordfish.  I would have ordered that.  Came in a nice clear wild mushroom broth.  Bonus.  The crispy shrimp dumplings were a nice consolation prize.

Red Snapper
Very good.  Reminescent of a Chinese whole fish, but smaller portion and bigger price.

Sorbets
Nothing special.  Not sure of the flavors, but some overpowered the others.

It's called the Crispy Shrimp and Salmon roll.  It was awesomely delicious.  Better be considered the fact that the 6 rolls cost $19!  The shrimp was made from panko bread topped with soy marinated salmon and wasabi tobiko sauce.  The wasabi tobiko sauce is what made the roll taste different from any other rolls I've had.  The chef recommended no soy sauce but  I did so anyways....just a little. It's like fries without honey mustard (in my opinion).  For sixteen dollars, my brother ordered the...California Rolls?!  They looked like rolls you can buy in a box at Costco.  

However, i must say their Japanese Ribs were cooked to perfection.  You can easily rip the meat off the bone.  With the ribs came with truffled soy bean salad which I wasn't a fan of. 

For so long, I always wondered what it was like to eat here.  I'm very thankful that I finally had the opportunity.

I am always excited to be in a big city during restaurant week - and we were fortunate to be in town during Vegas' RW! Japonais RW special offered a variety of appetizers, entrees, and two desserts. We (my husband and I) had the Rock (DO IT!!) appetizer.  ""The Rock"" is thinly sliced marinated new york strip steak cooked on a hot rock - the flavor of the steak and seasonings was fabulous and the experience of cooking on your own private 500 degree rock was unique. Our second appetizer was the ""Pachinko"" which was Kumamoto Oysters with mushroom and bacon gratin (not on their regular menu) - very tasty indeed! For the entree, I had the Chestnut Chicken which was a Chestnut Chicken;  1/2 chicken with Shiitake rice and lemon ginger sauce - the portion was more than adequate and quite tasty! My husband had the Sea Bass Cartoccio which is steamed Chilean Sea Bass served with soy butter sauce and tomato compote.... omgosh, it was so flavorful! For dessert, I had the Chocolate Mousse Cake with Raspberry Sauce and. my husband had the ice-cream trio. Our waitress was incredibly helpful and quite attentive! She continuously updated our time between courses in relation to our show time (which she asked upon seating us). We felt the attention was very personalized and spot-on even though she was tending to five separate tables. We overheard her speaking to the table next to ours (their show time was earlier than ours) and she ensured their food and drinks were delivered in time for them to have a leisurely meal and still get to their show in time.

Probably the best thing I had was the grilled asparagus but that was just that... grilled asparagus.  The rock grilled steak or whatever they called it was too gimicky for my taste.  Yes, the hot rock gave a nice sizzle and sear over the first steak slice you put on it but afterwards, the rock loses a lot of heat really quickly thus cooking the remaining slices unevenly.  The sweet and sour calamari appetizer tasted like something that came out of Panda Express.  I tried a little bit of the duck and it was nothing special.  The flavors were all jumbled together and I couldn't even taste the duck.  Same thing can be said of the filet mignon that I ordered.  First of all I ordered it medium rare but it arrived medium.  Like the duck, it was just a jumbled mess of flavors that really masked the meat itself.  The worst part of the meal however wasn't the food but the uneven arrival of the dishes.

That's why I docked a star.

The spicy tuna rolls were small, too, but there were 6 tiny pieces and the tuna was delicious.  

The soft shell crab roll is probably the best bang for your buck.  Also 6 pieces, with generous portions of soft shell crab legs on top of the sushi.  Yummy!  

The drinks looked really interesting.  In case you are wondering, the Floating Orchid is akin to a pear martini.",ugk0g6vyv2XavpoTaJSy6A,0,0,3,ORWCr5P0JwJmkzXz9yiFGw

Our party of 4 decided to order an assortment of appetizers to share.  We had ""the rock"" (strip, not Kobe, which was really excellent), crab cakes (also excellent), veggie flat-bread (good, better than I expected for flat-bread at an Asian fusion restaurant), and  lobster spring rolls (ok, but definitely everyone's least favorite). 

My stepmom and I each ordered the blueberry ginger cocktail and loved it (not very sweet, lots of fresh ginger flavor), but we both love ginger.  Dad and husband had mixed drinks, which they said were good.  

My stepmom and I split the salmon entree, which was very good.  It had a great flavor, and we both loved the side of new potatoes.  The salmon was slightly well-done, which to me is overdone for salmon, but it was still moist.  Dad had the sushi special (made with shrimp, not on menu), which he loved.  My husband ordered two of the chicken robata, the ""beef robata"" (I think he meant to order the skirt steak, but they brought the beef slider), and a side of shitake rice casserole.  I tried a piece of the chicken, which tasted odd; I can't quite put my finger on what it was, but it almost tasted old... very fatty, dark meat, and not very well seasoned.  He said the slider was good (much better than the chicken).  The rice was ok;  it was basically sticky rice with about 5 small slices of mushroom.  

We ordered 4 different sorbets:  guava (good), mango (good), raspberry (good), and yuzu (excellent).  Some of us had coffee, which was fine.  

Service was fairly good, but I would have expected better from a restaurant on the higher end of in-hotel dining.",WCCTAN6Ws1t4CrMlFWS17g,2,0,4,i1cxfEm6KNzRqy6cvGuMTQ

The hostess wished us happy anniversary, which was nice of her.  Apparently it showed on their system when my husband made the reservation.

We had a nice table and our waiter seemed nice.  We were surprised that an Asian/Japanese fusion restaurant didn't have Plum Wine.  That's the most unusual thing I've ever heard of.

We ordered several small plates.  Grilled Asparagus, Chilean Sea Bass, Salad, Carpaccio, Salmon Sashimi and couple of rolls.  I made it clear that the rice portion of our meal will be from the sushi.  Everything came slowly and after waiting an hour for the sushi rolls, our waiter tells us it will be another 45 minutes.  REALLY!?  Are you kidding me?  I canceled the sushi order and left still hungry.  All the small meals that my husband and I shared were too small for any satisfaction to happen.

Anyways, I'll start with the food. Fan-freaking-tastic food here. Prices are absolutely absurd, but the food is delicious. First, we had an order of Salmon Sashimi. BEST salmon sashimi I have ever had. I don''t even know how to describe it, but it was by far the most delicious piece of fish I have ever eaten. The unbelievable taste of this sashimi is really the only reason I went with four stars instead of 3. Bad part? Two pieces of sashimi was $10!!!! At $5 a piece, it better be the best I've ever eaten! We also had a Tuna roll, which was tiny. It was delicious, but way too small. If I remember correctly, it was about $12 or $13, but was only 6 tiny little pieces. For our meal, we split a Nori-Encrusted Salmon. I split a meal? Who the hell is this idiot, right? The only reason we split was because the top of the menu had a note along the lines of  ""our dishes are designed for two"", not because we were being really cheap. FALSE. Since when is a 5 or 6 oz. piece of salmon sized for two? The salmon was cooked perfectly. It was moist and flaky, and the pan-fried crispy nori crust added a great flavor, but the sized for two thing really irritated me. Maybe I read it wrong and that was only referring to another section of the menu, but that should have been more clear. Additionally, the presentation of the dishes was really great. No beef here with any of the presentation or the styling of the dishes.

As for service, it was good. The entire staff was friendly, nothing special though. The one thing that really got me started before we even got there. When I called to make a reservation, I was asked, ""Are you celebrating a special occasion?"", to which I replied, ""Yes, we are celebrating my Girlfriend's birthday."" There were only two of us, so it should have been obvious whose birthday it was (I am a dude, she is not). But, nobody did anything for her birthday. We didn't even get a single person to just SAY ""Happy Birthday."" Not that I expected a free dessert or anything, but at the prices here, I at least expected someone to say something.

In conclusion, I am not sure if I will be back. Maybe I would for the lounge dinner ($45 for two appetizers and an entree) to split with someone and one order of sashimi, but that's probably it.",df_wr-hXaxeb1b_KCAX3BA,2,1,4,UjGc_eFBjSExV1N7NGmnuA

I had been here a few years ago but had sat at the bar in the lounge (whole different vibe of course). The food just brought me back. I also brought someone that made me make a reservation for here weeks ago as all I did was rave about it since.
We sat in the dining room, and my only little comment would be for the ladies to bring a wrap or a jacket. The A/C was pumping right over our heads and we were cold throughout the meal. The space itself though is beautiful.
Our waitress was a doll and could not do enough for us. It is the little things like the warm hand towels at the beginning of service, hot water with lemon offered when she knew we were cold. She was unobtrusive, came at just the right times and we never wanted for anything. She was prompt with the bill and had an incredible disposition.
Ordered were the shrimp tempura with veg (WELL DONE!) and the crab cakes (DIVINE! Best I have ever had). My friend ordered a $16 pear martini drink which she said was OK but I am not sure she would get it again.

Only went during happy hour to watch the USA beat Canada at hockey in the Olympics.  It was a great place to do so - with the rustling palm trees overhead in the atrium...and the wispy white drapes and candles...and a busy bar.  I'm really glad it's where we chose to watch the game, even if the service at first was rather cold.  This review is of the lounge area only (and the alcohol that comes out of it).

I had issues with 2 of the 3 specialty drinks I tried:

The Cucumber Passion drink tastes like women's perfume mixed with soap (no, there's no cilantro in it - I love cilantro).  

I witnessed one waitress RE-USE the orchids that are dropped into the ""floating orchid"" drink.  The flowers are submerged into the drinks, so when people drink them, their lips touch the flowers.  She took them out of used martini glasses and put them back (dripping) into the orchid container at the bar.  NASTY. (FYI she was a voluptuous Caucasian girl with med-dark brown hair past her shoulders that was teased up a bit. I did not witness anyone but her do this.)

Atmosphere?  5 stars.  But it's not all up to atmosphere.

Tip: If you want to go here for happy hour (which is from 5-8!), be sure to reserve a table or come early so you can sit at the bar.",MCDwKJOOiMyhJKC86kHJmw,1,1,2,86pAPHslwqhHpFfVDaDAHA

I knew we were in trouble when I ordered and the waitress asked if we were sure that was all we wanted, because their portions are small and what we ordered probably wouldn't fill us up.  I told her we'd start with it and see how we felt.

She was right, but my biggest issue was the taste of the food.  The kani kani was good, but the consomme was very fishy.  And the Hawaiian Hamachi, six frito-sized slices of fish spread out as much as possible on the plate, were next to flavorless.

All the reviews I've seen on this place have been good, so it's quite possible that this is just not my kind of place.  I'm sure the quality of ingredients were top-notch, and the atmosphere of the place was fun, but when I'm hungry, what can I say?  I want food.

It took a trip to Vegas and a stay at the Mirage.  Our first impression was the restaurant is beautifully decorated; very modern.  The hostess who seated us was really friendly and immediately started chatting with us about where we were from.  Both the hostess and the waitress also made sure we didn't have any place to be at a specific time.  The menu here is a little different- our waitress explained straight out that everything came in appetizer portions for 2 to share and different items came from different kitchens so it may not all come out at the same time.  It was just me and my husband and we weren't in any hurry so this was fine with us.  It worked out nicely for us- just as we finished one dish, another came out.  I liked this constant flow of food- it made it more of an experience and less of just a dinner.

Our waitress was very sweet, patient, answering our questions on the menu.   We decided 2 sushi rolls (spicy tuna with avocado & california roll with snow crab),  the Rock (strip, not Kobe), crab cakes and the robata (sea bass, shitake mushroom, and beef).  The rolls were the best my husband and I have ever hand, hands down.  I've never tasted anything so fresh. Everything we had was beautifully prepared and this was no exception.  The Rock was unique and delicious and I highly recommend it.  It reminded me a bit of fondue as you cook your own food at the table so it was fun, but it was super quick because the beef slices are so thin and super easy. My husband was in heaven.   I'm not big on beef (not even a good steak thrills me) but even I loved it and ate more of it than I planned on.  The robata came next and the sea bass was the star here.  It had a very unique flavor unlike anything either of us had ever tried and it was delicious.  After the Rock and the sea bass, the beef on the robata was good, but couldn't hold a candle to the previous two.  Finally we had the crab cakes.  Like everything else, they were wonderful.  

We had no room for dessert- despite the seemingly small portions, we were stuffed.  We walked out with a $125 bill (my husband also got 2 martinis) which is right about what we expected to pay- it's Vegas, people, and if you're going to eat in a hotel, you're going to pay through the nose.

I remember passing by it near Union Square and wondering if the fusion would be too coy for my taste...or maybe too koi? OK, I thought that was funny. Anyway, I don't have to waste a meal on my next trip to Manhattan since the owners opened an outpost here in the Mirage in Vegas. I can well imagine this place has the same, coolish vibe as its sister eateries in New York and Chicago. But you have to bear the ongoing hum of the casino and the unending stream of foot traffic passing by. The verdict on the food? Pretty good but kinda spartan on the portions. 

Jamie W. and I were at the Mirage to see the Cirque de Soleil show, this one an elaborate Beatles tribute called ""Love"" just right across the floor. The hotel concierge was pressing Japonais on us as a dining option, and our apathy made us cave. They offer a Lounge Dinner for Two for $45 - which allows you and a companion to eat at the bar and have two appetizers and then share an entree and a dessert. That's not really a terrible deal - but the meal did leave us hungry after the show. 

We tried the Lobster Spring Rolls and the Sweet and Sour Calamari for starters (see my photos). The three rolls were good and crunchy, though I honestly couldn't tell if they did contained lobster in them. However, the mango relish and blood orange vinaigrette were nice tropical accents. The calamari had nice texture and came clumped together in a sweet sauce undercut by a wasabi vinaigrette. Against all odds, it worked especially with the black sesame seeds sprinkled on top. 

For our entree, Jamie and I split the Chestnut Chicken which was nicely marinated in a lemon ginger sauce. It came with a shiitake rice casserole with corn and peas and some sauteed brocollini (see my photo). Tasty though hardly what I would call fusion. Just wish I got more than half a breast. For dessert, it was the Chocolate Indulgence, a little mousse cake heavy on chocolate and ginger (see my photo). We were probably out of the place in less than forty minutes, and I have to say the service was perfectly adequate. You could do a lot worse in Vegas. After all, what you eat in Vegas stays in Vegas, at least in their city sewage system.

The sushi is delicious and the best I've ever had. I highly recommend the spicy tuna, scallion yellowtail, and soft shell crab. Its very simple sushi as the flavors speak for themselves, so if you're looking for a lot of cream cheese you won't get that here. The miso soup is great. 

My boyfriend lives and dies by Le Quack. It is a phenomenal dish. The sea bass is excellent too.

The Rock is so fun and A MUST. You won't be disappointed. 

Every dish is so flavorful and fresh. The flavors complement the food perfectly.

I'm sorry to see some Yelpers who haven't enjoyed their experiences here. If you're looking to get stuffed, go to a buffet. If you don't want to pay for quality, don't eat at an expensive place.

On a recent trip to Vegas, a group of friends and I had dinner at Japonais. We specifically requested to be seated at the lounge, and were happy with our decision because the atmosphere was vibrant and sophisticated, yet very relaxed. The perfect atmosphere for friends to enjoy a nice meal and a few cocktails. 

While we were there, we took advantage of the lounge dinner for 2 - $45. For $45, a friend and I shared 2 different appetizers, had 1 (each) of the same entree, and shared a dessert. We also opted to take advantage of the lucky 7 lounge special, which offered appetizers and cocktails for $7 a piece. 

I started off with the floating orchid cocktail which was really pleasant and complimentary to my meal. Nice presentation, with an edible orchid on top. 

To start with, my friend and I shared the lobster spring rolls, which were plated over a mango relish and served with a blood orange vinaigrette. The spring rolls were tasty, my only complaint was that you didn't really get much lobster flavor. 

We also got the spicy terriyaki chicken drumettes with scallion sauce. They weren't particularly spicy and the chicken was completely saturated with terriyaki sauce that the American palette is used to - overly sweet with too much soy. Needless to say this wasn't my favorite part of the meal... But other parts certainly made up for the disappointment of the wings. 

The softshell crab roll was among the better I've tried, and the presentation was more interesting than your typical roll. The maki had softshell crab on the inside, but the legs were placed on the top. Super crunchy! 

For our entree, we ordered the petite filet with uni butter served over truffled mashed potatoes and asparagus. So good.. The filet was so tender. It's that great melt in your mouth sensation. The potatoes were good, as well. Plenty of truffle flavor, though the texture seemed more like polenta to me and I would have preferred them to be lighter to compliment the steak.

We actually weren't aware that dessert came with out meal, so that was a pleasant surprise! For dessert we had the pumpkin cheesecake. I'm not much of a cheesecake person because it's heavy, but I really enjoyed this. Interestingly, the crust consisted of what we typically associate with a cheesecake: it was dense and creamy, and the filling actually consisted of this really light whipped pumpkin filling. Really excellent. 

All in all we ended up spending about $40 a person, and were completely stuffed at the end of the meal. It was completely worth it. Japonais is one of the restaurants I had on the list I'd like to try. I'm definitely likely to return for a happy hour, since the value is incredible and the food is fairly enjoyable.",GVdD_5sQADVqedZKvsi7_A,0,0,4,epz1IWAF5Eo3Th0DvgYEzg

I sat at the bar close to the grill where the chef was prepping all the Robata (various foods skewered and grilled on Japanese charcoal bincho tan). The bartender promptly gave me a menu and was happy to explain the menu items that I had questions about. I ordered their Sake Martini (sake and shochu shaken with fresh cucumber) and sipped that deliciously refreshing cocktail while perusing my food options. 

For starters I ordered the Ahi Tuna Tartare topped with quail egg and caviar (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/azIZRqX_1qbp0_6GKSgSAA?select=o2MJ5pijZGP0tMLBPgDSEg#EzU5HRGJcy15ctY6qinvMg). The presentation of the dish was beautiful and I loved that the chive sprigs on top had their ends wrapped in gold leaves. Nothing makes a woman feel more luxurious than some gold in her food! The thin cucumber slices added a nice crunch to the well seasoned, fresh tuna. 

I had never had Robata before, so I opted for the Shitake Mushrooms that were dashi marinated with some sea salt and the Red Snapper Kama - fish cheeks with sea salt and ponzu sauce (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/azIZRqX_1qbp0_6GKSgSAA?select=o2MJ5pijZGP0tMLBPgDSEg#o2MJ5pijZGP0tMLBPgDSEg). The mushrooms were juicy and had great texture. The fish cheeks were absolutely phenomenal. The amount of salt was perfect and the meat right off the cheek bone was simply divine. I don't recall ever having such tender, succulent grilled fish. The grill added some nice crunchy char marks on the outside. 

Although I was already full, I couldn't resist the Kabocha Cheesecake - Japanese pumpkin cheesecake served with five-spiced pineapple mousse and almond cookie crust. Heaven ensued. The pumpkin was not very apparent (just as the bartender had informed me), the spiced pineapple had the perfect sweet & spicy combo going on and all the ingredients just paired so well together.

A lovely quick dinner experience at the bar - would definitely come back for the snapper cheeks and soem more sake martinis!!!",nh6mz0rxuGu3SAyf5ij-sA,8,7,4,oOBd-djF7cK431g0o9zHtQ

Thanks to our wonderful waitress Tomoko for her knowledgeable recommendations. Our meal wouldn't have been the same without her help!

Another favorite is ""the Rock"" -- this is probably a signature Japonais dish. You literally throw a slab of thinly sliced NY strip steak onto the hot rock and it cooks in less than 5 seconds. SO GOOD.

The regular sushi rolls are extremely tiny and are just the item around rice and seaweed.  If you are deciding on this restaurant for sushi alone, don't bother.

The food was mediocre for a sushi restaurant.  The sushi menu they had was actually pretty pathetic.  They have a full sushi bar that I sat near, with sushi chefs, but they didn't offer a wide array of sushi or hand rolls.  I suppose I could have asked to order something that was not on the menu.  The hot food looked good, but it seemed like things you could get at any other kind of Japanese restaurant or steakhouse.  The sashimi and negiri was extremely over priced compared to other sushi places in Las Vegas.  I was at Little Budda at Palms and also Sushi Roku at Caesar's and those places were 100xs better than Japonais.   I'd recommend those two over Japonais any day.  

The service was OK - I can't say it was good, but I can't say it was terrible.  I was greeted and addressed with a friendly face, but everything was just sooooo slow.  Even the host saw us waiting for a table and finished his conversation with the bartender before he came to show us to our table  The restaurant was EMPTY (maybe that has something to say about the place), and there had to be about 10 servers, but my wine glass and water glass sat empty for at least 10 minutes.

3415508,2009-03-17,0,azIZRqX_1qbp0_6GKSgSAA,"Since my two girlfriends and I were staying at the Mirage and had walked by Japonais quite a few times over the weekend, we decided to give it a try and we are so glad we did. The concierge made us reservations for Saturday night at 7:30 pm. The restaurant was not overly busy which allowed us to experience first class service and impeccable food in a chic space. I loved the waterfall in the far corner and thought the lighting was perfect, although one table near us did complain about a spotlight.

We tried:

Crispy Shrimp and Salmon Roll - enjoyed by my dining companions very much (I skipped it as I don't enjoy sushi)

Calamari - loved the flavor and thought it was very interesting that it came out in rectangles and not the rings and tentacles that I am used to seeing in other restaurants

The Rock - it's steak cooked on a hot rock. I've seen presentations in other restaurants like it, but maybe I'm easy to please, but it always amazes me. The rock only stays hot for about 6-7 min, so cook and eat fast. I don't even like steak very much and I really liked this dish due to the flavor of the marinate.

Crab cakes - my least favorite dish which makes me sad as I am a huge crab cake fan. My biggest complaint is that they cakes were a bit too ""soft"" for me...I prefer them to be a tad crispy. But it's personal preference I am sure.

Chicken robata - loved the rub on the chicken and thought the dish was moist and the chicken was cooked perfectly. The skewers were a tad hard to remove though!

Randolph Muller Riesling - nice flavor without being overly sweet. Perfect compliment to the all the dishes we tried.

Our bill came to $150 before tip; it would have been less but we sent the lobster spring roll dish to a table of four gentlemen at a table near us. Our waiter didn't think our request to do so was odd (we figured he had done it before!) and the guys said the spring rolls were delicious. Plus they ordered a bottle of red wine to share with us, so it worked out to our advantage.

Great choice for dinner, although next time I think I would like to sit in the lounge.",ZQYNombDho1PYfnEWFZevw,1,1,4,IG7pNeWq8oZPVX6aeBaWuA

I don't mind paying but dont be shocked when you get the bill and easily over 100 and it seems like you didnt order that much. Service was decent to good. I only say decent because our server would come over to check on us and then let herself be stolen to the table next to us and forget about us but a lower tip took care of that.

Went here for a drinks and a small meal before watching Love. We ordered multiple small and overpriced appetizers and good priced cocktails/beers.  This is a good place to grab something before the show so your not starving through it.

Here is what we ordered:
Salmon & yellowtail - small portions but fresh
Lobster eggroll - good but probably not worth $7 - 4 small pieces
Slider - very tasty, a must try. Ended up ordering another
Floating orchid cocktail (for the hunny) - citrusy just the way she likes it
$4 Japanese beer - decent price

The Bad:
- Getting reservations was easy and booked through the hotel.  After getting seated by our host we waited what felt like forever for our waitress to even come to our table.  The happy hour was not even that busy.  During our entire meal, she was not to be found and we were continually looking for her to appear.

So we checked in real fast, I changed and washed up and we made it in time. We were seated in the lounge area, which was pretty comfy with pillows to lie back on. There was a waterfall area right behind us. 

Our server was very nice and attentive with us. We ordered the Lobster Spring Roll, Sweet and Sour Calamari, Hamachi Roll, Unagi and Avacado Roll, Teriyaki Drummettes and Crab Cakes. Out of all this we were pretty stuffed even though they were small appetizer sizes. A little taste of everything at the right portions made it well worth it. Out of all the items though, I would pass the Teriyaki drummettes they were a bit burnt and salty tasting. A few drinks and beers our total came out to 70 bucks. I think it was a great experience and great little taste of what the restaurant offers.

3572387,2009-09-29,1,azIZRqX_1qbp0_6GKSgSAA,"Again a weekend in Las Vegas. Though, this time around, not so drunk. More broke, sober (hungover) than ever, the last night in Vegas was more spent walking around and people watching. We could have just eaten at McDonald's or Chipotle, but going by the simple rule of trying places I don't have locally, we walked past this place under the glass biosphere-dome of the Mirage.

Being more attracted to the ""outdoorsy"" feel then anything else about this place, we decide to charge up the card with this place. A ""Dinner for 2"" was offered, whereas for $45 a select menu listing of item could be had. We wanted to see more since the select item menu seemed very limited.

I stuck with the meat cause I hate fish and seafood. My date got the crab cakes. I got the beef you cook on a hot rock (The Rock) and some glazed hot wings.

If you're hungry, don't bother.

The portions are tiny. The beef slices I got were so thin. I swear I get more meat from a 99 cent pack of Carl Buddig ham. The hot wings were drummettes cut oddly, where the joint to the ankle of the drumstick was chopped off leaving you with oddly placed bone fragments perfect for slicing your mouth and throat. The crab cakes looked like stinky KFC biscuits.

The service, though, was outstanding. It had better be for the $70 we spent. (That's like 10 Chipotle Burritos!)

I am not really accustomed to over-paying for tiny meals, so take that into account. But what we got tasted good.

There is also a lounge area with drink specials, also under the glass dome. And, what we noticed later, a more-indoor, more-restaurant-feeling separate section of the place. 'Sides, that biodome section got really dark for dinner.",cpbvGqIRlcssC75xxdmhNw,0,0,3,aKJur8TOjxExfhYu7zRHlA

I started off with the bakuchi roll. Pretty fresh and tasty. Would definitely order it again. For my main entree I had the salmon japonais. Nice big piece of furikake crusted salmon. One of my favorites on the menu. 

I enjoyed my meal but my sister, who had the filet mignon, had to send her plate back because they overcooked her filet. And it took the kitchen forever to cook another one. We were all finished with our meal by the time her dish came back so that was disappointing. The restaurant did give my sister a free ice cream dessert (but the flavors were unconventional and she didn't care for it)

I was also disappointed with the service. The restaurant was fairly empty and our sushi took a long time to arrive...even with 3 people behind the sushi bar! My glass stayed empty for awhile before someone came to refill. Our waitress was friendly and apologetic for the long wait but with a half empty restaurant you would think service would be better.",hDORQRV0XiQKVHlxtTYeLw,0,0,4,4WjKn2SOp2tdqhE9G3MuCw

I've walked past this place, located near the main entrance of the Mirage, on a number of different Vegas trips and have always been attracted to the ambience. Wandered in last Saturday night before popping over to the Venetian to check on my travelin' man, who was playing in a tourney. We had late dinner reservations so I was looking for a spot where I could grab a delicious cocktail and a small bite or two and not stand out like some creeper. Two points for Japonais! The menu offers a smallish but varied selection of small plates and two different specialty cocktails, all for $7 each. I believe there were some special beer and wine selections as well for even cheaper. I tried one of each cocktail (hey, I was in Vegas!). Cucumber passion was tasty but a bit sweet. The Floating Orchid was absolutely lovely - looked beautiful, tasted delicious, not overly syrupy. I read in a review that the orchid was edible and got a rather hilarious look from the gentleman to my right when I ever so delicately ripped a chunk off it with my teeth. Maybe it's ""edible,"" but that doesn' t mean you gotta eat it, ladies.

For my bites, I had the yellowtail and scallion roll and the lobster spring rolls. Spring rolls were fine, but I probably would have preferred another sushi roll - it was deelish. The portions were fairly small but perfect for my purposes, and I rolled out having spent less on two plates and two cocktails than I spent on ONE drink at the pool earlier that day.

3731924,2016-03-08,0,azIZRqX_1qbp0_6GKSgSAA,"Japanese sushi at high-end prices.  Prices listed are per piece for nigiri and sashimi.  It's about double what I would pay in Texas.

The restaurant was totally out of otoro and chutoro (fatty tuna), but they did state they get daily shipments and we just hit them up on a night when they didn't get any fatty tuna shipments.

Honestly if they'd said this upfront, I probably would've gone someplace else since I love otoro sushi.  Ask them when you're seated if they're out of anything.

Had the regular tuna, the crab legs, yellowfin and unagi.  The quality was excellent, which, when you consider the pricing, makes a lot of sense.

Drinks:  They have a pretty nice selection of Japanese beers and whiskies, but they charge way too much for them.  $22 for a Yamazaki 12 is way too much for a basic whisky, it was cheaper to get a Balvenie or a Macallan.  There was a really nice witbier from Japan, but it was $12 for a bottle, making it kind of pricey to do anything more than sample it. 

My basic summary is that the place is decent, but expensive.  If you're willing to throw down the money for the quality, you'll have a great experience.  If you're looking for cheap sushi, better options are elsewhere.",XNzQn7mBTQgvCQeJstZP_g,1,0,3,s-fJv-jFHS-nNFPkMe07Ug
3761094,2016-07-19,0,azIZRqX_1qbp0_6GKSgSAA,"My wife and I decided to try this place since we were staying at the Mirage and it looked like it had some elements that we typically enjoy.  We had an reservation in the dining room but it seemed like a morgue in there.  The music was barely audible and there was no energy at all so we opted for the lounge which actually appeared to have people who were alive eating and walking around.

The way they do their drink menu is awkward at best.  Our waitress wasn't much help in that she couldn't really explain how I could navigate to the white wines by the glass.  I eventually was able to figure it out on my own.  My wife ordered the Floating Orchid Martini since it was mentioned here.  She indicated it was average at best.  My glass of wine was fine but again, nothing special.  

Moving on the the dinner, we decided to try a variety of things so we could hit all of the bases.  We ordered the Yellowtail with Diced Jalapenos and Ginger Garlic Soy Cold Appetizer which was good but again, nothing special.  The Snow Crab Avocado Roll was basic.  The Lobster Spring Rolls were a change of pace and I would give them a ""5""on a scale of 1-10 but they were essentially deep fried lobster egg rolls.  The last thing we ordered was the Crispy Shrimp Salmon Roll which I thought was the best of the bunch and would order again while my wife gave it a solid ""Meh.""  

Our waitress wasn't attentive at all.  She spent more time flirting with the lounge bartender and never really stuck her head up to see us waving her over.  She finally came over and we moved on with our evening.  The other table across from us had the same look on their faces which was ""Hey, can we leave now since we are bored and our drink glasses have dried up from lack of use.""

Easily cruised in on Val's day and scored a nice table in the bar area. It is a bit noisy, but not as bad as I would have expected, considering it is right off the casino floor and they bump the loungesque music. Boss enjoyed a special drink for the night. It had a flower in it. And it was sweet. That's all I can remember. 

As everyone has stated, the prices are too high. It is unfortunate, because the food they serve is quite tasty. Boss and I split two sashimi plates. Both were nice: eel and very fresh red snapper. But again, pricey - $12 for a 2-piece sashimi plate. Ugh.

We next sampled the lobster spring rolls. These came with a really nice mango-garlic compote and served as a great prelude to the meat. We splurged on the 7-spice kobe rib eye. It was pretty amazing. Very tender and seasoned quite well. Partnered with sweet potato fries which were also savory. The steak approached $90. Yikes!

We finished everything ordered. Maybe that's because the portions are small. But you have to remember, this place definitely goes for the quality over quantity approach, so that has to count for something.",vnj0lqPy3V8DYRmZf7D_dw,1,0,4,hXHgf0fh5NrWbi_65CTg5Q

Let me start by saying this is one of the few restaurants that would actually make me rethink my Star Ranking system.  If I could give more than 5 stars, I would...but since I can't, I might have to readjust all of my previous reviews based on this one restaurant.

Japonais has it all...great ambiance, fantastic service, and amazing food!  I'll start by telling you about our waitress, Tomoko.  This girl was perhaps the best server that I've ever had.  She was extremely knowledgeable about the menu and Sake, super friendly and personable, and very thoughtful.  I have to say that she really made the evening as without her help, our eating experience wouldn't have been the same.  

On to the food!  To quote Stewie Griffin from ""Family Guy"", ""OMG, there's an orgy in my mouth!""  Tomoko started us off with 3 different types of Sashimi and each one was to die for!  In particular, the Kampachi (Yellow Jack) and Akami (Tuna) were extremely buttery and melted in my mouth.  We asked for the leaner Akami and I swear, this stuff was better (and fattier) than some of the nicest Toro I've had elsewhere.

The next highlight is the ""The Rock.""  A hot rock is brought to your table and accompanied by thinly sliced NY steak.  You take a slice of steak and cook it for about 3 seconds on each side on the rock and then eat. Aside from the novelty, the steak with its ponzu (?) marinade is extremely tasty and tender.  The only other place where I've experienced the hot rock cooking method was at a restaurant in Japan called Serena.

Also included in the meal were a tasty crab roll, grilled Hamachi (Yellow Tail) in a sweet sake broth, and a delicious strawberry dessert the full details of which I can't recall at the moment.

Tomoko's selection of Sake was also excellent.  I believe we had a cold Junmai Ginjyo sake called ""Bichyuwajo.""  It was extremely smooth and delicious.

If you're ever in Vegas and love Sashimi and Japanese food, you must goto Japonais.  Don't think!  Just do it!",kGf5g7l8eeEUqMwjGeMGsA,1,1,5,_tayYmgTQcCAcva_yyfxUw

It was one of Oprah's top picks and since when is Oprah ever wrong? =) My friend suggested ordering a bunch of appetizers rather than entrees because they were tastier...and she was right. The 2 that stuck out were the thin NY steak strips & the crabcakes.

The NY steak (aka ""The Rock"") was neat! The strips were served raw and we had to cook them over a heated rock. I was hesitant at first because I didn't want to smell like grilled meat afterwards since we were all dazzled up, but it wasn't that bad. Honestly, I enjoyed the cooking more than the taste of the beef.

The crabcakes, on the other hand, sent me to a euphoric daze. They were so good, we ordered a second serving within minutes of inhaling the first. (OK, so we didn't exact inhale them...we have more class than that at a restaurant like this, but they were sooooo good!) By far, THE best crab cakes I've ever had in my life.

I give the service 3 stars - it took a while for our food to come out and we were starving. Our waitress also failed to check in on us often and we actually needed to ask for things. The ambience is 4 stars in my book. The dim lights, sheer curtains, waterfall, and candle lit tables gave it such a romantic and mesmerizing feel, but I really wish they could've somehow blocked off the view of the casino. It was a bit distracting. Be ready to spend some monies though. I shared 3 appetizers and a glass of Reisling and threw down over $60. Yeow-zah!",Nn-hLgYTKNkJQ-G7LSXG3g,0,0,4,MRr2LdrRs7MWyQd30trAKA

Quality of the food is very good although some of the itmes we ordered were definitely overpriced, even for Las Vegas (8$ for a single nigiri, when you can get the same exact quality somewhere else at half the price).

Rolls however were very good and the Salmon Roll was possibly the best I've ever eaten, so it might be worth a visit just to try it.

They also had an interesting soba beer although again the price didn't make the experiment worth (16$ if I remember correctly). My wife had the cocktail of the month and it was simply amazing.

My server came quickly and took my drink order--some iced green tea.  We then talked about appetizers that wouldn't be too large.  I didn't want to order something meant for sharing.  I asked about the ahi tuna ceviche and he said that would be good for a single diner.  I ordered that and the Le Quack Japonais for my main course.

I was brought the ahi ceviche as it was excellent.  The yuzu and white soy marinade was very good!  It was a 3 ounce serving and just perfect for a starter.

Then same Le Quack.  The duck was fantastic!  It came with condiments for putting on the duck in the mushu wraps.  There were four items--a mango chutney with some red pepper, Japanese cabbage shreds, green onion ends also shredded and some spicy plum sauce. I was surprised that I ate all the wraps but one with my meal.  The toppings were so good and great accompaniments to the very good duck!

Next up, dessert.  I asked my server about different desserts.  I opted for the most popular one, the Kabocha cheesecake.  It's a cheesecake with a crust made from crushed almond cookies, with a layer of Japanese pumpkin cheesecake, topped by a layer of five spice  pineapple mousse.  The cheesecake is not as creamy as some we're used to because of the circular pot in which it's baked.  But, take the spoon and go down through the pineapple mousse and grab some of the pumpkin and the combination is outstanding!  A real winner.

Service throughout the evening was first rate!  It turned out that my server, David, was the captain.  He was polite, helpful, and friendly!  He gave me his business card with a small gift for the next time I'm at Japonais and I got the 20% locals discount MGM Resorts is offering Nevada residents at many of their restaurants for a limited time.

Likely causes: I was taken out to dinner by a vendor in NY so I didn't have to foot the bill, and I've probably been spoiled by all the sushi restaurants in San Francisco.

I came here for dinner because I couldn't find any other reservation that looked decent enough to take clients, it was in a convenient location (The Mirage), and I had previously had a good meal at their NY location.

- The Rock ($18) - Everyone raved about this in the reviews, I thought it was just okay. There were 8 (I think), super thinly sliced pieces of NY Strip Steak, marinated and served with a hot rock that you could grill it on. It was good, but each little piece of steak was not worth the $2. Also, it seemed odd we would pick up each raw piece of meat with our chopsticks and then use those same pair of chopsticks to continue eating our meal - seems like food poisoning waiting to happen.

- Chilean Sea Bass ($12) - This was one of the best dishes that I had here - each skewer had about 5 pieces of sea bass, and we got one skewer for each person. I liked this one - the miso was not too salty or overpowering and the fish was fresh and flaky.

- Jumbo Asparagus ($5) - I ordered 3 of these for the 3 of us at the table and it was too much. We could have done with 2 orders of these. The asparagus was okay - it was a bit too burnt on the top of the asparagus and too tough at the bottom.

- Braised Short Ribs ($29) - One of the better dishes of the night - the meat was flavorful and fell to pieces. The portion size was reasonable for the price.

- Sashimi & Nigiri Chef's Combination ($58) - This was a rip-off. For 11 pieces, each piece of sashimi and nigiri was roughly $5.25, which is ridiculous. Quality of the fish was fine, but it wasn't the best sashimi / nigiri I've had, especially not for that price. Some of the best sashimi I've had melts in your mouth, and I wouldn't describe this as that.

I also had 2 sushi rolls that were pretty unmemorable and a bit on the small side. The total for the meal was $240 for 3 people (including tip and tax) which was expensive and I wasn't impressed by the quality of the food. We didn't even order any drinks or dessert. If you're looking for better sushi, Blue Ribbon Sushi at The Cosmopolitan is much better, and you can get better meals for $80 per person.

Our server explained that there are THREE kitchens (plus a sushi bar) in this place, so orders are brought out at different times. That's important to note because you may need to wait a bit, so you shouldn't come here if you're short on time. Everything, other than the entrees, are small plates meant for sharing. So a party of two would need about 5-6 plates, which can add up ($$).

Their skewers (we tried chicken and kobe beef) were tender and juicy. There's only about 2-3oz of meat in each one of them, though, so make sure to order a few. 

They saved my favorite dish for last - the Japanese ribs w/ sweet potato fries! The ribs fell off the bone and were mildly sweet. And the sweet potato fries were super crisp and not oily at all.

The service seemed to be struggling with us at first - menus were forgotten, requests for drink menus forgotten, but keep in mind we were a group of 9 girls in town for a bachelorette party and were probably slightly more rowdy, more hungover, drunker and more annoying than their usual clientele.  However, our server seemed up to the task and made sure she was attentive, quite funny, helpful and really good at separating checks! 

After reading other reviews I decided to order The Rock for the table as I knew the other girls would appreciate the presentation.  Luckily there were exactly 9 pieces of tiny meat so we each got to have a bite - if I'm ever back I'll be ordering this again and not sharing! It was really good.  The server helped me choose another appetizer (they were out of the toro tartare) and I ended up with the beef carpaccio - definitely not the usual carpaccio I order as they must have put an asian spin on it.  This was good and I would definitely get it again.   Being that it was 9 hungry girls, I didn't get to try many other dishes, but the tuna ceviche (more of a tartare in my eyes) looked great, as did some of the robata grill items.

In the interest of saving money I ordered a plain salmon roll...nothing special and nothing big - probably would order off the specialty sushi rolls next time.

All in all it was a good meal, made better by our server.  Yes Japonais is expensive, maybe slightly more expensive than it should be, but it's on the strip, inside a hotel in tourist central and is probably priced just right for what it is.

Le Quack Japonais - The hoisin sauce was outstanding. Lovely maple flavoring.
Shrimp Roll-the rice had a slight wasabi flavor to it. YUM for me, not so much for my date.
Sake (I think it was Tozai) - Smooth, creamy vanilla. Slight spicy undertone.

We were not expecting to get free drinks for play because we wanted top shelf alcohol, what we did want was good service. I felt they took a long long long time to help us let alone acknowledge we were there. They were not too busy but I would have loved a ""i'll be right with you guys"" or a ""one minute"" look or a ""sorry for the wait guys"" upon service. Once we ordered the drinks were good, though they did not require much mixing they had a good amount of liquor.

The place was nice and the food looked good but I wasn't feeling the service. I might try it again if I stay again to give them the benefit of the doubt.",7OhoKWhJ-lQrriDhe-QZkw,0,0,2,cXtBXUJq346vp3WzMsawAg

The service was wonderful. The food was fresh and delicious and fun. 
We ordered a few things off the small bites menu since my husband and I enjoy sharing logs of options- The Rock was one of my most favorite dishes. They thinly slice and marinade steak for you to then cook on an over sized hot rock (think hot stone massage kind of rocks) the waiter gave us a time table advice for med rare-well done and it was perfect. 
The sea bass... Holy wow. It's heavenly. A sweet and savory cooked to perfection fish. No complaints at all.

I also want to mention the strawberry saki cocktail since it could go down as my favorite drink in history. 

Prices are fair considering you're eating in a high end casino resort in Vegas- really we had zero complaints.

Positives
Great intimate lounge, not good with a big group but with 3-5 people really nice.
Nice selection of small plates, good for sharing and snacking as you enjoy your cocktails.

Negatives
Expensive!  Definitely recommend getting there for Happy Hour (we sadly were way later).
Ended up sitting next to a couple of Eastern European business men and their no sh!t hookers who were very, very demonstrative!

Don't regret going there but it is very expensive when you look at the amount of food and cocktails you get but the quality of the food is amazing and so is the ambiance.

Wow. Every item we had was just excellent. Crab -cakes were all crab with a delicate sauce on the plate. Ahi was seared perfectly. The sushi plate was awesome. Every piece was fresh and the spicy tuna roll that accompanied it was spiced perfectly. It had the perfect punch of heat. I am always disappointed when spicy tuna rolls are too tame.

Reservations are easy to make (even on the day of), and the restaurant is great at honoring any requests you may have as far as what type of table you prefer.  My husband and I prefer to sit in a booth along the back wall overlooking the dining room because it is quieter and more intimate than sitting in the main dining room.  Everything on the menu is priced pretty reasonably, especially considering the quality of the food and the prime location of the restaurant.  It may be less expensive to dine here because it's not as flashy or as trendy as other spots, but the quality of the food does not disappoint.

Service was friendly and quick during our meal, and we noticed that there were lots of runners and additional staff moving around to keep the food moving quickly from the sushi bar to your table, and to make sure that your water glass never goes empty.  Before we ordered, our server recommended a few items on the new Robata menu, so we tried them.  The asparagus was outstanding!  One portion is perfect for two adults to share - and the miso topping smothered on top was out of this world delicious!!!  Order it. Trust me!

We also tried a variety of traditional rolls and sashimi, but the yellowtail rolls and sashimi stood out as our favorite.  The menu does not have a huge variety of specialty or unique rolls, but the sushi bar items that they do offer are executed so well you don't miss all of the crazy sauces and toppings.  We also tried sorbet for dessert, and the lychee and coconut flavors were our favorites.  The server told us that all of their sorbets were made with coconut milk, so while they tasted light and refreshing, there was also a bright decadence about them that really filled us up.  I will say that there was more rice on the rolls than I would have preferred, so next time we will look to see if they offer any rolls wrapped without rice, or just request less rice on the rolls we do order.

Overall we really enjoyed Japonais and would definitely recommend it.

The first app was called ""The Rock"" and featured marinated slices of strip steak, and a 400 degree river rock to sear the meat on. 5 seconds on each side of the meat and it was cooked to perfection.

For dinner, my wife ordered the duck which was marinated in a hoisin based sauce, served with mushu wraps, and various condiments.  It was amazing and I had to keep sneaking bites from her.

""The Rock"" - maybe my expectations were too high from reading other reviews, but I was underwhelmed.  The meat was tender if you took it off the rock quickly enough but the marinade - bleah.  Too salty.  I don't think with meat that high quality you really even need that much marinade, if any.

Sashimi - pretty darn good.  My wife loved the sweet raw shrimp and lamented the fact there was only one on our plate.  The toro was excellent.  Might be the best I've had in the States.

Raw Oyster/Shrimp Cocktail combo - can't remember the fancy name for this dish.  The shrimp was tasty and HUGE.  I can't comment on the oysters since my wife ate them all before I had a chance to finish chewing my shrimp but according to her, it was above average but not as good as what we've had at Farallon, San Francisco.  The dipping sauces were nothing to write home about.  Bland, blah.

Sushi Rolls - it was tasty except for one really big problem - some of the rice was under/un-cooked.  At first bite I thought it was just dry, but after a few chews, I was sure some of it was undercooked.  A humongous no-no for any respectable place that serves rice.  We didn't even finish the rolls and just picked out some of the filling with our chopsticks.  (Speaking of which, why does such a high-end place use those cheap-ass chopsticks)  Very disappointing, but the filling they use for the rolls is excellent.  In fact, the next time we visit Japonais, we would still give the rolls another try and hope that they got the rice right.  

Tempura - simply the most perfect tempura I've ever had.  Their frying person should get a prize.  

Overall still relatively impressive despite some mishaps.  Maybe after our next visit I can come back and give it a better rating.",OGULSb4f-UIfWFId7g9uNQ,0,0,3,jZoa45yQd_Nx7r9t6MpRjA

In Union Square (NYC) most of the north side of 18th street just East of Park Ave was taken over by Japonais.

My second experience here was full on dinner and we literally ordered everything. So much so that to recall what we ate would be impossible. What struck me post about Japonais was the intense freshness that the various sashimi dishes posses. I mean let's not forget here that Vegas is in the middle of the desert. Even taking that consideration out of the picture, this Japanese gem has a delicacy to their cuisine well above and beyond what I've tasted.

Ambiance? eh. Sat in the bar/lounge area and was utterly uncomfortable during the entire duration of my meal. My knees kept hitting the lounge tables cause they were so awkwardly low. I was literally hunched over my meal....not okay.

After my horrible experience at Japonais...i've learned my lesson about walking that extra 5 minutes to eat at a better restaurant. I'd rather give my money where its deserved.",Gp6oaJ7Jhew8aqmlKnNQpA,4,0,1,-UBrNRrg7DYycj4LVYT6xA

For starters I ordered the Bloody Mary with the wasabi shochu, that was ok...The sushi I didn't care for only because I've had sushi all over. So this visit was strictly hot foods. The consumme was eh...not the best. It had a citrus taste in it, and it made it a little bitter. The Lobster spring rolls....definitely good with the mango relish. Who isn't using that trendy mango relish nowadays? Mango salsa - mango relish. Yea real creative. There's a blood orange vinaigrette that I really didn't care for. Eh there's gotta be more to it.  I got the wagyu beef cut japanese clay pot.  Ok there was a lime cooked in it. 5 little pieces of beef....Hmmm right.... Well most culinarians know if you cook citrus you wanna add the citrus last because it makes your dish bitter when you cook it extended times. Le Quack Japonais....Hmmm it's kinda a version of Peking duck....with mango chutney. Hmmm how original. It was ok. This dish was also something that wasn't new and imaginative. It was good. It wasn't GREAT! If you want this fancy fusion. Yes try it if you got the budget for it. I'm not quite impressed with the menu. The ambiance is nice. It seems the tables are a little close though. That flat rock thing with the steak is their novelty item. I didn't like the fact that I tried to order steamed rice and it was an ordeal. So over all 5 things. 2 dishes were ok - ambiance nice, I'm thinkin 1-2 stars....I'll round down. :)",UvY0E6Wuhv_0Bita52RPOw,1,2,1,oia8HpSB68KkxqgGwqsUIg

We sat up front in the lounge, which meant we had the jingling, jangling casino floor to our left and the red-lit dark wood of the lounge to our right.  A study in contrasts.

The four of us split several dishes, lots of rolls.  The food was good; nothing spectacular, but solid.  The service was quick and friendly (most notably when they graciously kept the avocado rolls coming for my vegetarian friend whose manners apparently decline inversely to her level of intoxication; it was like ""more avocado rolls""-centered Tourette's).  The seating?  Really uncomfortable.  

All in all, it's pricey (it's Vegas), but it's a great place to grab a bite in the middle of the evening: A) because it will satisfy you; and B) it won't put you into a food coma.

Honestly, one of the best restaurant designs and atmosphere you'll find in a fully indoor restaurant. You'll discover design follows to food presentation. Everything looks amazing. But that's where the substance ends. Then it's downhill.

Traditional and creative sushi rolls are decent, but the fusion appetizers and main courses are as impressive as a Prius at a drag race. 

""The Rock"", which is thin-sliced marinated beef you cook yourself on a hot rock, gets praises for novelty for first-timers. But it tastes like chorizo. ""Le Quack"" also celebrates gorgeous presentation appeal, but fails as the duck is tough, and mixes poorly with the choice of hoisin sauce and spicy mango chutney. The ""salmon japonais"" lay in a sea of white puss- but it was beautiful puss.

Server hospitality is fantastic, as is expected in high end establishments in Vegas, which is one of the few things that kept the dining experience bearable. 

So if you're here to impress a shallow date with an inexperienced palate, then this place is interesting. They'll be mesmerized by the decor and look of everything. For those with taste, pass.

So why 3-stars instead of 2? The dessert is amazing. I highly recommend the dessert sampler. We devoured it. Now, if they could somehow replicate their dessert-making prowess in the main menu.....",qW2e3x21BMWlOr72WUoFug,3,1,3,07mes5FxUOPj2-f3Ffiw5Q

I was pretty impressed with this place. At first I was terrified, after seeing the lounge and thinking that it was the restaurant itself. I thought, ""wow, zero privacy, and pretty loud for a dinner spot"", but then I realized what I was seeing and my mind brightened again knowing that they had such a cool attachment to the restaurant. The food was awesome (not so into the asparagus, but whatever), the cocktails were super tasty, and...most importantly...service was outstanding. It's all about presentation and professionalism when it comes to a great dining experience, and Japonais had both.

4974735,2008-09-03,0,azIZRqX_1qbp0_6GKSgSAA,"Restaurant Week has arrived in Vegas and what better opportunity to check out a few restaurants while helping a worthy cause?

Japonais was among the many restaurants listed, but their menu was the most diverse with quite a few selections to choose from as well.

Arriving for an early dinner on this Labor Day Monday, we were seated along the back after requesting a side by side seating.  We were both surprised with the interior of this restaurant and the sushi bar.

For $50.08 per person, we had a three course dinner ahead of us.

To start, appetizers to choose from included Crab Cakes, Lobster Spring Rolls, Hawaiian Hamachi, Ahi Tuna Ceviche, Spicy Tuna Maki, etc.  We both chose the ""Kobe Carpaccio with soy, ginger, pearl onions and tempura shallots.""  What a divine appetizer to start with!  Delicately sliced and presented on a rectangular plate, the crunchiness from the shallots and sweetness from the onions provided a perfect balance.  The Big F was in complete heaven!

Entree choices ranged from Seafood Toban Yaki, Ahi Tuna Steak, Salmon Japonais, Chestnut Chicken, and Le Quack Japonais.  We both decided on the ""Petite Filet Mignon with truffle potato puree, grilled asparagus and uni butter.""  The 4 oz. filet was cooked perfectly rare with a very good flavor.  The uni butter was a nice touch, but the potato puree and thick syrupy sauce made the meal so decadent and rich.  Instead of the grilled asparagus, we substituted with grilled broccolini.  It provided a nice crunch and contrast to the silky smooth potato puree.

Dessert was a ""Trio of Chef's Specialties"" that included their Kabocha Cheesecake ""Japanese pumpkin cheesecake with an almond cookie crust"", their ""Chocolate Ginger Mousse Cake"" with gold flecks, and vanilla bean ice cream.  A generous dessert after such a rich meal.  The mousse cake was light, but also quite dense with flavor and richness.  The cheesecake had a more unique flavor, especially with the nice crust.  And a scoop of good vanilla ice cream and fresh berries always complements a dessert well, and provides a nice finish.

Service was great.  Our water was always refilled before it ever reached the half mark, and our waitress was thorough and friendly.  She came by often to check on us and let us know the status of our order.  

Overall, we had a fabulous experience with great food and good service.  It's a bit pricey for their sushi since they sell their nigiri by the piece!  But the Big F enjoyed the meal so much that he'd be willing to go back again this week just to enjoy it again!

* Industry night: 50% off industry menu every Wednesday in their lounge.
* Late Night Dining: Late night menu every Thursday, Friday, & Saturday until 1 am.

I apologize for my terrible short term memory, but I am pretty sure they have happy hour from approximately 5-8pm and then a late night menu starting at 10pm. So, if you happen to arrive between 8 and 10, you are going to resent all those people who timed their experience smartly and took advantage of the discounts. 

If it is 8:30, you can probably hold off until 10pm. Call to confirm times!

We went during the not so magical 8-10pm period and sat in the lounge. I will say service (despite a delayed soup) was amazing. Everyone from the hostess to the manager to the server to the server assistant were attentive to our every need. 

However, the food was a tad disappointing on this evening. The robata/grilled items were definitely the highlight. I would recommend perhaps sticking to a selection of robata and sitting in the lounge for a cool evening snack. We also had the calamari, which was super tender, large cuts of calamari, not the skimpy rings. I appreciate the quality of the calamari, but the beauty was drowned a bit in the heavy chili sauce. I might even suggest getting that on the side. I had a salad which was okay. The first bite was brilliant, but the more I ate, the more the citrus notes became a little too heavy. My husband did not adore his fish entree, and the pepper soup we sent back for being salty. They were incredibly kind about removing the soup, but it was still disappointing. Overall, the meal was okay, and at full prices, not quite the quality we had hoped for. 

Still, the service was perfect, and if we had caught either their happy hour or late night menu and got the items we knew were the stars, it could have been the perfect lounge bite for the evening.",qewG3X2O4X6JKskxyyqFwQ,10,6,3,LP8pT_l-j243g4ztJ9kgRg

But again, very expensive and not big portions.

Last year we ate in the casual open area and were gaily served by a beautiful young lady in a sexy kimono uniform (it was cute!). This time, us two ladies opted for the more formal dining area: quieter, darker and more private, with formally-attired servers (and steaming hot hand towels for patrons - nice!). We had a delightful older Asian lady who went out of her way to pamper and check up on us.

Since Japonais is such a pricey treat once  a year, I want to splurge and order everything - so I did: The Rock appetizer (a smoldering hot rock, where you sear little slices of marinated raw beef yourself - a fun if scanty treat); lobster spring rolls with mango relish (rich, buttery, shatteringly flaky); and Chilean sea bass skewers (smoky, buttery soft and delicious). After the appetizers, we opted for splitting several rolls (and opted out of drinks for the sake of attempted frugality!), and like last time, the sushi was so good, so fresh and satisfying. 

We couldn't resist splitting desserts, and we tried this frothy, foamy pineapple cheesecake ramekin (not my favorite, but my friend loved it); and then some creamy, rich, dark chocolate-and-ginger torte, almost devoid of sweetness and sprinkled with cocoa powder and served with sesame seed brittle (I loved it!).

Very rude.. anyways

Service was good otherwise. 

Le Quack Japonais: My bf loved the mooshu (taco-type) style wraps over the typical buns. I prefer the buns. Either way this is a tasty duck dish.

Sushi/FIsh: Tasty and fresh, but not as good as I had hoped sadly. I had had baby tuna at the Chicago location and the baby tuna here disappointed me.. just not quite the right texture and not nearly as good. I can however say the hawaiian hamachi was awesome.

Kobe carpaccio: eh.. as many have said the meat is so completely covered in spices you can't taste the beef itself! I much prefer this dish at Cut as the seasoning doesn't completely overwhelm the beef.

Dim Sum/BBQ pork buns: mmmmm these were quite tasty. Honestly I'm sure they are tastier at your fav dim sum spot, but it was a nice touch being able to order these along with other sushi, etc.

Desserts are nice, but the drinks are even nicer. The Rouge and the Floating Orchid were both quite tasty. I'd definitely come back to Japonais to sit in the lounge and have overpriced tasty cocktails.

Overall a tad pricey for what you get, but what isn't in Vegas? Out of the asian fusion places I've been to I prefer Sushi Samba, Nobu, and Tao, but I do prefer Japonais to Little Buddha.",kmE8w5Y785eZmodsx0V6Ag,1,1,3,_L68IJq-4TpA0PhwMiBWSA
5237927,2011-03-29,1,azIZRqX_1qbp0_6GKSgSAA,"I had the pleasure of tasting a variety of delicious entrees this restaurant had to offer :D 

First and foremost, they have happy hour at the outside bar between 5pm and 8pm, I had a Japonais Tartini, it was yum yum good-- strong, but not in the way where all you taste is the alcohol, one drink and you got a nice smoothing buzz going ;) and thats good because each fancy drink runs about $14, unless you catch the HH of course. 

Next, the rolls and I only had two to try, the Tuna Tuna Salmon, which was unbelievably delicious, great sauce to top it, and might I add very large in size. And then I had the Unagi Avacado which was disappointing, small rolls and not much flavor- I have definitely had better Unagi rolls.

As for entrees, I had the Salmon Japonais. If you have a big appetite, this may not be the meal to get, unless you order a roll with it or something. The portion is small, but beautifully presented with a sweet sauce that includes salmon eggs, lima beans, shrimp, and tangerine slices- I dont know how it works but it JUST DOES :D I was not disappointed.

The others at my table had the Duck which was very good and heavily marinated in the BBQ sauce and I would definitely recommend it. The other had the Calamari- this plate will definitely fill you up with what they give you, I cant explain what the calamari is fried or cooked in but it brings a great flavor to the dish. Another had the  BBQ beef, now this one had a very strong flavor to it, almost a bit overwhelming and didn't seem to do justice to the beef. Lastly, someone had the Steak Ribs, which I didnt get to try BUT the person eating it said it was very good. I can however recommend that you try a basket of their SWEET POTATOE FRIES that come with the meal, only way to describe it would be sweet and spicy, had  a jalepeno flavor to it and comes with a sauce for dipping which is fabulous! Gotta try it!

On a quick note, I think this is a great spot to be fancy, the lighting and decor is beautiful, but for a romatic night out, Im not so sure, as they didn't have a lot of tables for two. But none the less, this is a great place to eat :D",3hWJxx8-gMutgaKY2T7IKQ,3,1,4,_7qJCKQwFSdJadWdUJ7Lsg

Me and my girlfriend had a reservation for 7:30 and was promptly sat as we got to the restaurant.   We weren't that hungry so we decided to try the favorites.  We asked the waitress what she recommended and she said that ""The Rock"" was one of the favorites, and wow was this good!  It's served raw and you cook it yourself, on a rock (thus the name) for a few seconds. We also had salmon nigiri and i'll tell you, it was one of the freshest sushi's i've tasted, and I eat sushi A LOT.  For Dinner we ended up splitting a full rack of ribs which was about 12 ribs, it wasn't as good as we thought it would be but it hit the spot.

The decor was trendy, the staff was friendly and the prices were reasonable.  They had a special going on when we went.  It was a Couple's Lounge Dinner from 5-8pm...which included 2 appetizers, 1 entree to share, and a dessert for $45/couple! i have to say, that's pretty cheap for Vegas. If that doesn't satisfy your appetite, you can always order from the lounge menu during happy hour for $7 appetizers, and drinks!

There were eight of us...each pair ordered the Couple's Dinner, as well as a ton of appetizers and drinks.  I think it came out to about $100/couple.  To order from the lounge menu, we had to sit in the lounge.  The tables were ultra low, but you can't complain for the price.  For dinner, my fiance and I ordered the tempura shrimp rolls and lobster spring rolls as appetizers, the chestnut chicken for the entree, and the Chocolate Ginger Mousse cake for dessert.  

The rolls were my favorite (spicy tuna, tempura shrimp roll, yellowtail roll (and i dont even like sashimi).  We also had the sweet and sour calamari, black angus sliders.  Im not really one to order chicken (im a steak kind of girl) but surprisingly it wasnt that bad.  I didn't really care for the Shiitake rice casserole...it was kind of blah to me.

We opted for the tempura shrimp roll and lobster spring rolls to start. In addition I ordered the calamari. The tempura shrimp roll was a little different from what I'd had before, the shrimp was extra crispy but still very good. The lobster spring rolls were actually lobster egg rolls (fried) but still very good with rock lobster inside and a mango salsa to go with it. The calamari was also different, instead of a fried breaded calamari it was slices of lightly pan fried squid with a sweet sauce. I couldn't put my finger on it but it was definitely tasty.

Our main course was a salmon dish, I can't remember the name but it was salmon on top of mixed seafood with a horseradish leek sauce and risotto. This was a high quality dish with many thoughtful elements like chopped up shrimp, a little rock lobster and oyster.

For dessert we had the chocolate ginger mousse cake. This was a top-notch dessert. The presentation was fantastic, I still don't know how they created the cylindrical little tower. The exterior looked hard yet when you dug into it, it was very smooth. Towards the bottom were thin layers of chocolate cake.

This place is probably too expensive to go to if you're seriously hungry, and the service didn't help. We were really the only ones there at the lounge but the food took a while between courses.

Anyway, I digress... 

I was excited to check out Japonais' Vegas location w/ my girlfriends and since we had tickets to the 9pm Beatles ""Love"" show (located at the Mirage), we figured that Japonais (also located inside the Mirage) would be an ideal place to grab a bite before the show.  

The main dining space was well-appointed but a bit stuffy so we opted for the lounge, which had a more hip vibe (not to mention great for people watching)! We started the night with lychee martinis and sake flights (a fun and tasty way to start the night).

Stand out dishes were the capaccio, sashimi (wow, fish gets cut for personal orders and is extremely fresh, and of course, yummy pork dough balls (forgot the technical name).

And the food here is NOT cheap. I did notice however, that the ribs and the chicken my brothers ordered off the main menu were much bigger than what I ordered. 

The sushi is AMAZING, and probably some of the best i've tasted anywhere, so that made up for the lack of food on the main menu. 

I would say that this is a good place to grab some drinks and have appetizers and good conversation. But an actual sit-down dinner with the family... I'm not so sure about that.

He kept us entertained and he offered good suggestions for entrees and a cold sake for us to drink.

5443214,2013-10-27,0,azIZRqX_1qbp0_6GKSgSAA,"Japonais really deserves at least 4 stars for the delicious food and the friendly service. I honestly believe that a majority of people gave lower ratings due to the price. Everything is a little overpriced except for the main courses. Those range from $28-36 which is typical for entrees at a more nicer restaurant. Japonais is categorized as a Japanese restaurant and sushi bar. 

From the outside, Japonais looks very contemporary and is absolutely beautiful on the inside. They have huge wooden beams that have nice curves to it along the ceiling. Just the whole restaurant makes you feel like you are in a restaurant with class and beauty.

Japonais offers an array of food like hot & cold appetizers, sushi rolls, sushi, sashimi, nigiri, izakaya, steaks, fish and pork. Great selection of different things that would surely please everyone. They also have a nice selection of desserts at the end if you still have room!

Po (Poh) was our waitress and she was a character! She had so much energy we all felt like we drank a couple cups of coffee. She was hilarious and definitely made the night special. She knew the menu so well. She knew what was in every dish and was able to answer our question with ease. 

The food here is presented beautifully and tastes amazing! Here's what we ordered:

Lobster spring rolls (4 pieces): served over a mango relish and blood orange glaze. It was like your typical egg roll, but with little bits of lobster. The mango relish was nice, but I honestly couldn't even taste the blood orange glaze. If I didn't read the menu, I would have not known what it was. $21

Hawaiian hamachi (4 pieces): thinly sliced yellowtail with chopped jalapenos in a sesame soy yuzu vinaigrette. The server tells you that the sushi chef recommends that you do not put soy sauce on it. So we just ate it as is and it was very citrusy! The yuzu stood out so much. Thank goodness I like yuzu otherwise it would have been way too sour for me. $17

Ahi tuna ceviche: white soy marinated with edamame and tempura shallots. In my opinion it's more of a tuna tartare versus a ceviche. A ceviche is traditionally marinated in lemon, lime, orange and any other citrus in order to slightly cook the seafood. Tuna tartare is traditionally marinated in soy sauce and sesame oil. Anyway, the diced up sashimi was delicious! Just dip each piece into a combination of soy sauce and wasabi and it's amazing! $18

Tuna flatbread: ahi tuna, mochi cheese, shimeji mushrooms, fresh made ohba and wakame crust. This just sounded really interesting, but the flavor was actually very simple and good. You can really taste each component of this dish. First you get the tomato flavor from the slice of cherry tomato on the top. Next you taste the ahi tuna itself and then taste the mushrooms and finally the ohba and wakame crust. I honestly couldn't taste the mochi cheese that much, but you can definitely feel the texture. Overall, it was very interesting and I'm pretty sure you can't find this dish at any other restaurant. $18

Braised short ribs: served with a Japanese sweet potato puree, poached apple and au jus. This was absolutely delicious! The short rib was a pretty good size and it was just fall apart tender. This dish just had so much flavor. The apple was an interesting touch to this dish, but I liked it since it made it a little bit different versus your typical short rib dish. $29

Salmon Japonais: nori skin encrusted Atlantic salmon, sweet shrimp, fingerling potatoes and curry oil. I wasn't too sure how the curry oil would taste in this dish, but you couldn't even tell that the curry oil was in this dish. The salmon was cooked perfectly. It had a nice crust on the top while the actual salmon meat was still moist. It was placed on top a bed of sliced shrimp, sliced potatoes and edamame beans. It was also in a creamy sauce. I couldn't quite put my finger on that creamy sauce, but it was pretty good. $28

Sea bass cartoccio: steamed Chilean sea bass served with maitake mushrooms, soy butter sauce and a tomato compote. The sea bass was so moist and cooked perfectly. The soy butter sauce was perfect over rice and the tomato compote had so much flavor and took this fish to the next level. So much flavor was put on this delicate fish and it worked perfectly. A must try! $34

Apple pie toban yaki: Not your traditional apple pie. Washington red and green apples with a ginger sugar crumble and a scoop of honey vanilla ice cream served in a hot clay pot. The presentation was absolutely beautiful and it tasted even better. The sliced apples were swimming in a sweet caramel like sauce and the ginger sugar crumbles gave it that much needed texture. The ice cream also provided a nice touch to the overall dish and made it seem creamy. Such a great dessert! $14

Overall, Japonais was delicious and I would definitely eat here again. The quality of food, service and presentation makes this restaurant a winner in my books.",QIy3iLXjBUBqRzwd2lnWGQ,4,3,4,NjuHbwc-7vfph9o_Pl9I-A

This restaurant is located right by the Mirage Atrium, Fin, and the Cravings Buffet. It's design was very hip and trendy and that's what the Mirage was transforming into from it's glory days as the most luxurious hotel ('89) to just an average joe hotel.

We also ordered miso soup and edamame as our appetizers. The food was terrific and didn't disappoint as well as the service being top notch. Sitting in the lounge area was just relaxing, having a flat screen TV with the game playing or laying back on the soft leather seat and admiring the Mirage Atrium.

Hot rock thing was cool where they bring a heated stone to 400 degrees and you cook your own thinly sliced marinated slices of meat on it.  The Spider Roll was tasty.  The rest was sort of forgettable.  Everything was decent, but not great.  Pricy, but not a good value.

With so many great spots to eat in Vegas, why would you settle for this mediocre place?

Luckily we didn't do too much damage at only $60/ head.

Anyone have Sushi Roku's number?",hhwcGRS5emwmhkcz5LAEXQ,0,0,3,6yKqOs3w9_EqFAQ26hlJ4g
5779144,2015-01-08,0,azIZRqX_1qbp0_6GKSgSAA,"Stumbled upon this place on new year's eve. We originally made a reservation for Stacks next door but somehow the hostess messed up the reservation so we ended up here. Best mistake ever!

They had NYE combo which consisted of an appetizer, main course and desert for 110/person. The appetizer choices were Miso soup with Clams or Scallop ""ravioli"". The main course was Wagyu steak! SO AMAZING! and the dessert had both red bean ice cream and green tea creme brulee. Everything was so amazing! The wagyu was so tender and delicious. The creme brulee wasn't too sweet like most places. I had an amazing nye dinner here. We also ordered The Rock which has thinly sliced raw steak that you cook by placing it on the hot rock. YUM! 

Our waitress Dana was also amazing and super sweet! Came to check up on us just the right amount of times and made good recommendations.

The only reason I took off 1 star was the wait between each course. We probably waited like 10-15 min between each course..another reason was that towards the end, the rock wasn't hot enough to cook the sliced steak. But overall it was an wonderful experience and I would be going back to this super trendy and yummy restaurant!",q-HLj57tUfFAH4LbkTl_8Q,2,2,4,kBZk66bnigryl_iac5gcfQ

This bar has an indoor/outdoor feel to it because of the skylight and slightly elevated space just above the casino floor. The vibe is contemporary Japanese, with an elegant aesthetic and very uncomfortable seating. :)

The signature drinks that we girls ordered were pretty disappointing (sake sangria and some cucumber martini), however the drinks the guys had were red bull vodkas and were mixed well. Japonaise serves food late, however I didn't bother to look at the menu because of the mind blowing dinner at Sushisamba (review to follow) we had beforehand. The bar is open until 2am and they have a few TV screens in the bar area and are viewable pretty much anywhere you sit.",Agbv8YDkOE7V_ZfJseLVOA,13,13,3,czM22WzUy2rApDZMHO4qzQ

Yellowtail appetizer- 4 pieces sashimi with soy sauce (?) and jalapeños. Delicious but wished there was more. 

Scallop & shrimp robata- please skip this one! Could've definitely lived without it considering it was literally one shrimp with a small piece of scallop grilled. Very underwhelming. 

Sakura roll- good.

le quack duck- delicious! Definitively recommend ordering this. Nice size portion. Sliced duck came with Chinese broccoli and wraps with some sauces and ...other stuff. It really made us full for $30 entree. Without this last dish both of us would've still been hungry. 

Finished off with Mochi ice cream. Four flavors- guava, lychee, mango, green tea. Delicious way to finish off the meal. 

Nice dinner for two for $120. Really can't complain. Plus service was great!",FrER9C5pQFEGYzhXju_l1g,1,0,4,2zJkG4fFxXCe4ff0YSdgcA
5843557,2013-12-06,0,azIZRqX_1qbp0_6GKSgSAA,"We're staying at the Mirage and decided to check out Japonais Lounge. The hosts were friendly, pretty and welcoming. They were quick to greet us and walk us over to our table. The decor was dark but very beautiful. I wasn't too happy that we pretty much got the worst table, facing to the door and the casino but The ambiance was so zen and organic that it wasn't worth complaining about. The drink menu was excellent. I had a startini from their speciality list and it was fantastic. Cheers to the bartender. We started our romantic candle light dinner with thin sliced raw steak that sizzled and cooked on a hot stone- which I thought was awesome. The sauce on the steak had alot of flavor.  However the rest of the menu was a bit different.  I can't lie, I did have a hard time looking for something that I would like. Although I enjoy trying new food, I was so hungry that I didn't wanna gamble with my choice. (Enough gambling for me anyway lol) so I had a very much boring meal. House salad and sweet and sour calamari. I was expecting to get deep friend calamari like you can get anywhere- from 5 stars in South Beach to a diner in Norwalk, CT. But it was so much more than that. The calamari was very juicy, and tender.
The sauce was fantastic and the sesame seeds added a ton of flavor. ( I never thought I would raving about calamari ha ha ha) My boyfriend had the filet mignon with asparagus and mashed potatoes. It was perfect. Cooked perfect and absolutely amazing. This place is awesome. 
The bathrooms were clean, which is always a plus. 
The prices were fair to me. Maybe most people wouldn't agree but I mean you get what you pay for. Totally worth it. 
One of my favorite parts about this restaurant was our server, Rick. He was so polite, attentive and had a lot of knowledge as far as the menu and hospitality. I've dined in all types of places, all over the world and meeting an excellent server is harder to find than you think. Rick was great. 
Although I will not be staying at The Mirage again, I am most likely going to stop by Japonais for another delicious meal next time I'm in Vegas. (Which hopefully won't be for another 30 years, haha worst hangover) Totally recommend this place to everyone!!!",fSdaIMTUzX8u6noPUhZvBA,0,0,5,5yiGBilGWlBjILA30IyOLw

Went online and looked up ""sushi"" in Vegas and this one seemed to have some of the best reviews.

Our waitress was more than hospitable and helpful. She recommended the seaweed salad which was delicious; the sushi (not sure what kind we got, but it was perfect!) was amazing and the beverages were just as refreshing as they were exotic; the presentations were lovely as well!

Overall, I would definitely come back and bring a larger party; great for intimate dinners and large parties :)",jgPuvwbEM-f9NoTSIEklPg,0,0,5,642_aFEBb8ziD1vJEzP6Aw
5912150,2016-04-26,1,azIZRqX_1qbp0_6GKSgSAA,"Well, the food here was not the best sushi I have had in Vegas by any means but my friends and I did have a good meal here and some fantastic cocktails prior to the Love show there in Mirage. I ordered a drink that had gin and ginger and lime juice served up and it was amazing but the name escapes me and I can't seem to find the cocktail list on their website.

Most of their rolls were pretty basic but they did have yellowtail sashimi served with thinly sliced jalapeños; this dish is a favorite of mine. Getting a platter seems to be the way to go. Even though it is a little pricey in the end you come out ahead since the individual items are quite small portion sizes. We also got ""the rock"" which was a fun presentation to cook the thinly sliced meat on the hot rocks. My husband also ordered the skirt steak which he kept to himself but seemed to really enjoy. So even carnivores can find something to their liking here.

Not the best meal I have had in Vegas but definitely the best place I have been to in the Mirage.",Tsm8VraTp5OGyVALtUiCeQ,2,2,3,czyOSzS4LRipd8wV7l_gdQ

What was really great, however (aside from the company) was the beautiful decor - great use of subtle reds and blacks, curtained privacy booths, nicely oriented. Service was semi-fast and friendly.

There was plenty of seating in the restaurant and lounge areas; we chose the lounge. Lovely atmosphere...but the lounge was extremely cold yesterday.

The server was very nice as was the hostess. We kept the food order fairly simple - pieces and rolls: salmon roll, avocado roll, rainbow roll, king crab roll and a couple of pieces (ikura and salmon). Sushi was decent - until we tried the salmon roll. The salmon in that roll - and 2 of the pieces of salmon on the rainbow roll - were funky. As in...something is wrong. As in....""i'm about to turn and i'm....gross. I've never had funky salmon like that before. The 2 pieces of salmon nigiri were fine; they clearly came from a different cut/source.

We pointed it out to the server and she was very apologetic - and assured us that everything is very fresh and delivered daily. She removed the salmon roll from the bill and said that she was going to talk to the sushi chef immediately.

Still...won't be on my list for another visit in the future.",Y1zlQuRT31BH-p38U59ZVw,0,1,2,b1lmL4y9FADxCwiVJnpfIw
5935496,2010-04-14,1,azIZRqX_1qbp0_6GKSgSAA,"We went here for happy hour which includes a $7 menu. Drinks and food...kinda.  It's not meals, it's tiny appetizers. So, you end up spending more on the food than you would have if you ordered an entree.  But if you're going for appetizers then yes, this is a good option. The drinks that they have on the happy hour menu were refreshing and unique to the restaurant. Well worth the $7 which is a bargain in Vegas. 
The ""tables"" are LOW, LOW, LOW, so I don't recommend wearing a dress like I did, it was very awkward to try to sit without showing the world your ""business"".  The restraunt is very neat and super chic, very posh. It's right next to the casino so there is a great opportunity to people watch. The Mirage is a very scenic hotel as it is and Japonais blends right in with the ""theme"" of the place.  
We all had a great time and we definetly enjoyed our tiny appetizers. The Kobe beef slider (just one per order) was the best thing on the menu. DELICIOUS!!!!  OH! and the calamari was the weirdest calamari I have ever experienced. I DO NOT recommend it. It was more like a calamari fish stick...it was in the shape of a thick stick...not in rings...so odd!!!",XOCnS40Xr5Tj2DJQ7CN1QQ,0,0,3,LJSc8T3KMxWmTpLaiVrDww
5940626,2013-07-17,0,azIZRqX_1qbp0_6GKSgSAA,"Japonais recently provided me with one of the better, if not the best, sushi meals I have had in LV. Sushi Roku in the Forum and Nobu at the Hard Rock are also in that conversation.  But as for Japonais, we had an intentionally-expedited meal at the sushi bar before seeing a show at Mirage, and the sushi chef and his service team were great!

We fired away nigiri orders, some customized, while trying everything in sight- and the fish was excellent.  The caliber and gradations of Toro were delicious and 'honest' to what they were, which is somewhat uncommon in the US.  I'd happily chow on that alone in the future, but everything we had was truly high-quality and tasted fresh.  We basically ate exclusively nigiri, with the exception of one lobster or crab spring roll, which was good but missable.  Desserts were excellent as well- my wife had a Japanese pumpkin cheesecake and I had an amazingly refreshing yuzu sorbet.

Since we didn't really even read the menu, I can't comment on what was on it (non-sushi items).  But I can say that on this given July evening, the sushi bar was locked and loaded with a sizable variety and great fresh offerings, and I wouldn't hesitate to visit again if in the area.",fES_Ws1CDBUw7vcTJzr8CA,0,0,4,uTmyqB1t9mKAdp6MRlrLag

The portions are ridiculously small and overpriced. I felt like after dinner, which included appetizers, entree, and dessert, I still needed another meal. I think this is the case because it's in Vegas, people just automatically think it's okay to pay so much for so little. I feel that because it's Vegas, the expectations are higher. If you're going to charge that much, at least make your food really good or decent sized portions. Three stars for decor, food presentation, and attentive staff. They lose the other two stars for overpriced and not expectational food.",-bj4evSejxRDuvYnmcGNrg,0,0,3,Jw3I5wHr-fLGD4ZMKL9xVw
