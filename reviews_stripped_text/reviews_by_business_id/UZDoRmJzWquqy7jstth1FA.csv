They run out of things quickly, and when asked a question they respond with rude sarcasm! Very unhappy!",vCMjlsKixDDKutcmgrZaUQ,0,0,1,j5-2FARpdhvNIZPPHz65yw

It's just inside the north tower doors on the 1st floor. There is ample seating available if you want to eat there. So, Westgate does a ""Go green"" deal where you get $10 towards any restaurant/food place in the resort if you forego housekeeping services that day (you get the coupon the next day). We got that coupon which made for a sweet, cheap deal at Pizza Hut. We ordered the chicken Alfredo pasta, meat marinara pasta and 3 breadsticks. Holy cow, they get a star just for the breadsticks. I might have to go back for those. Our total with the $10 coupon applied was only $7 something! We weren't able to finish it all with 2 adults eating and a toddler. 

The service was fairly quick and the employees were friendly. They have personal size pizzas. Not sure if they do bigger ones.",eZLolxErzfgEVwC7FapTcg,1,0,3,ll0sjydz0no9IWwTqjfKZQ

I asked for the specials and he just gave me an attitude and told me to go online and for that I'm going to be ordering somewhere else now.",X-YE-0Mv_gFn_5ZDklZc5A,0,0,2,4pssHGrnJAoxecso3dD01g
