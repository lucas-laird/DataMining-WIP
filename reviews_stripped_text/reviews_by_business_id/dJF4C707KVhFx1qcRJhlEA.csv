35514,2011-08-04,0,dJF4C707KVhFx1qcRJhlEA,"In all honesty, I stopped into this place only after learning the deli next door was no longer in business. So, I was expecting just an average Mexican joint and play it safe with a couple of a la cart tacos.

It was early in the lunch hour, so it looked a little quiet from the outside. As soon as I walked through the door, I was greeted by the entire staff! Nice! With this being my first visit, the friendly gentlemen behind the counter (who I connect the dots as Phrank) was quick to suggest some of their best dishes. I notice out of the corner of my eye a sign advertising their daily special as fish tacos with rice and beans. Done and done. 

I have a seat and in no time one of their servers brings me out my drink and asks me if this was my first visit. ""We hope you enjoy the food!"" he says mentions that my lunch will be right out. 

Meanwhile, the place is really starting to pick up! Construction workers, business men and a couple of families all seem to be regulars and strike up conversations with Phrank and even recognize each other as loyal fans of the food.

The fish tacos were incredible!  Good portion size and yummy, well seasoned rice (although still not as good as my mom's)!  I was in a bit of a hurry so I was in and out of there in no time, but it was probably a good thing as people were literally lined up for the next available table.

All in all, great experience, good food, terrific staff and close enough to the office it's a shame not to visit at least a few times a month.",QRXsIlJoL_Ar7IRzU94jzg,2,1,3,vhJTaUpdUJGtO5CXKojp2w

Frank (or should I spell it Phrank?) was super duper friendly, and there were no issues with customizing my carne asada burrito to exclude rice. I don't like the trend now that bigger is better with burritos, with places using 3+ tortillas. My meal was normal sized, and stuffed just enough to make me full without pwning my face. Speaking of stuffing, it was back to basics with meat, beans, and cheese. The meat was the star, well seasoned and plentiful with each bite. Presentation was simple, but really there isn't much you can do to pretty up a burrito in general. 

I also got to try their green and spicy sauces. The green had a nice tang with a medium spiciness. I kinda wish the hot sauce was even more spicy, but that might just be the masochist in me talking. 

Phrank's feels like a good place for down-to-earth-fill-you-up meal. I won't be able to do any late night taco runs here if I get the munchies, but I think I could swing by to grab a breakfast burrito before work.",kYAZadWY7QXGtzo648VUOA,1,0,4,qMsmuPdTR2MXdsLKsUjwrA

CLEAN menus are on the CLEAN counter for you to peruse prior to ordering. 

CLEAN utensils are on the wall in dispensers for you to take from. It's not a free for all where grubby people with their grubby hands are fondeling the utensils. 

CLEAN tables await you. 

Food is FRESH...you can taste the difference...and made to order. Not greasy. No ""fat only"" steak burritos here. Chicken burritos are made from the breast, not from various chicken parts lying around. Green sauce has bits of pork in it. 

The owner & all the staff are friendly. Your order is brought to your table once ready whether its dine in or take away. 
Prices are reasonable.

1023251,2016-07-09,0,dJF4C707KVhFx1qcRJhlEA,"Best. Damn. Breakfast. Burrito! 

Just 10 minutes off The Vegas Strip, this family-run gem is hidden in a strip mall off Decatur & Sunset behind an ARCO gas station. In my opinion, it should be front and center, with marquee arrows pointing to their location flashing, ""EAT HERE!"" ""EAT HERE!""

Location: Quaint dining room with 2- and 4-person seating. Love the jazz motif...! A little unexpected for a Mexican joint, but tastefully exhibits Frank's love and respect for jazz music. (Something I can appreciate as a classically trained, former pianist.) A great spot for a quick bite. Considering my sweetie and I came after the lunch rush (around 2pm), the restaurant had a steady flow of patrons for the 45 minutes we were there. Oh, and the restroom was clean. I don't like to eat anywhere if the restroom isn't up to par.

Food: I only tried one item on the menu because I wanted a breakfast burrito (at 2pm) and it was the BEST DAMN BREAKFAST BURRITO I've eaten in a long time! #1) Phrank's serves breakfast all day. One star is specifically for that - being mindful to us all-day breakfast lovers. #2) No frills: My burrito came out piping hot in a deliciously fresh tortilla with scrambled eggs, melty cheese, extra crispy bacon, & potatoes... and not filler potatoes, like some restaurants tend to do, where hash makes up 3/4 of the burrito... these were thinly sliced chips - just enough. #3) My sweetie had a carne asada taco. He said it was nicely seasoned, great flavors, and he loved their salsa. #4) Horchata. Order it. 'Nuff said. 

People: From the moment we walked in, we were greeted with a smile. The woman behind the counter was friendly and helpful! (I'm sad not to have asked her name.) As we were preparing to leave, we were asked by a man if we enjoyed our food. Of course, I let him know... ""I'm going to Yelp about this being one of the best damn burritos I've ever eaten!"" The man happened to be Frank himself and we stopped to chat with him for a while about the food, his restaurant, and exchanged names of a few jazz artists we enjoyed. It was a delight to meet him and exchange pleasantries with the table of friends and family from which he stood.  

Right before we left, the woman behind the counter thoughtfully offered to refill my Horchata since we were hitting the road back to CA (uh... yes, please!), and Frank and his family wished us safe travels.

Long story short: The breakfast burrito is enough to bring me back on our next visit to Vegas (and write this super-long review). The service and the people make me dream we lived closer. ;-)",5TRY6ipw3RPNGzZreXCv0w,0,0,5,9IWj6RfaJR91y1KZ9bS8kw

He and his helper (didn't catch her name) are very cordial and really make an effort to offer exceptional service. 

Ordered one carnitas and two chicken tacos. They were phenomenal! I love tacos and try to sample as many as possible. Frank does a great job. The meat is flavorful, moist and plentiful, the corn tortillas fresh and the toppings are near salad like proportions (cabbage, cilantro and onion). I opted for the spicy salsa (there is a mild, green and spicy) which had a nice kick to it. There is no salsa bar, your choice is added to the order. 

The price, as I recall, is about $2.89 per taco. A little on the higher side, but they are worth it as the overall size and meat portion trumps the other tacos I've come across.

The place is also very clean and the food is made to order and prepared quickly.

1058711,2015-06-09,2,dJF4C707KVhFx1qcRJhlEA,"This was one of the bad dining experiences you have every so often in life.  It was recommended to me so I thought I'd try it. There were a couple of red flags right off the bat. The first was that it was 5:30 in the evening, prime dinner hour and we were the only ones in there, however after a few minutes people did start coming in, it was never busy though. The second was the back.kitchen door was wide open and it was hot outside. The third was the person taking the orders was in a mood lethargic and really wasn't into helping us at all. When prodded she answered basic questions about the food. There was three of us, my son, his girlfriend, and myself. My sons gf and I ordered pork burritos and my son ordered a brc burrito. When you pay there is room for a tip. I always tip but I want to see the service first as this was a fast food restaurant. The same girl that took our order brought us our food kind of tossed it on the table and told me that there were holders on the wall to get the plastic silverware ( not understanding why I should tip for this). My son was ok with his burrito but his gf and I did not like ours at all. I didn't get the meat in mine my sons gf did and said it was tasteless. The rice was mushed together with some kind of seasoned salt and the beans were out of the can. One of the people that worked there asked how everything was and I told him not good. I didn't like the food and was going to head to McDonalds for something better. He called both the girl taking the orders and the cook out. The girl taking the order said she though my son and his gf ordered the same thing a brc burrito and I ordered the one with the pork, yet she tossed my sons gf the pork burrito. The cook looked at me and said Ne not liking the food was a matter of opinion and she hopes I enjoy another Mexican restaurant. I will and do because I love Mexican food. I only gave it one star because the food was cooked and so far none of us has gotten sick. Oh yeah one more thing the cook has long hair that should be kept in a net. Thank God I didn't have any of it in my food. This disaster cost me $28.00 I actually feel really bad that I paid them. It is not worth it. If you want good Mexican food go to Chili Verde.

  I wasn't expecting anything on the strip so I began exploring the adjacent ave's. I passed on the first taco-joint that I came across to not sell myself short.  This was fortunate because 10 minutes later (unheard of in So-Cal) I found this little desert rose.  I was apprehensive because it was in a strip mall and I found the name with the ""ph"" somewhat unappealing. Not judging a book by its' cover, I gave it a shot.
  I feel compelled to INSIST that Phrank's is a stop if you are in the area.  I was taken in warmly by the proprietor and made to feel that my gamble was in fact just another pre-conceived notion DYING to be dispelled. Though machaca wasnt on the menu, the suggestion of the huevos racheros with the salsa verde was so good it'll make you wanna slap yo mamma! I found the portions satisfying and it was nice to respond with a genuine compliment when asked how I liked my breakfast.  I had to add NOTHING to my dish! No Tapatio, sal, NADA!  I told him as much and he took the remark in stride.
  Realistically, I spoke with Phrank at length about food, the Hoover Dam, and bikes and he is simply a genuine man/small business owner who deserves the reviews that I see to the right of my screen,  I probably would have returned to this place even if the food was two grades lower than I found it to be.

    Place closes at 5 and I popped in 4:10-15ish (some places give you THAT look you know) and place was lil slow as to be expected.  Frank the owner was there and I gotta tell you he goes above and beyond to provide an experience.  We ended up chitchatting some before, during and even after my order.  I left nearly at close time and never got any bad vibes.  He's real cool, real humble and I found out we both made our way to the 702 roughly the same time, out from SoCal.
    All that aside the food was great, got an adobada torta (based on his recommendation) and I gotta tell you the pork was done perfect and their secret sauce put it up there.  Perhaps the best torta I've had to date.  I say this cause I was listening to Pandora a lil while and I went from a whole torta to half a half (you'll know what I'm saying) in a matter of minutes.  I seriously devoured that torta!  I also ended up getting their pork nachos (which I've never had that way) put some of their home made hot salsa and went to town on it too.  In all the torta is a definite 5/5 it was simply awesome... the nachos could've used a lil something something else too but for my taste get 3.5-4/5 not bad.

1397039,2012-01-03,1,dJF4C707KVhFx1qcRJhlEA,"When reading one of Vegas's local magazine, I happened across a food review that touted Phat Phrank's as having the best Mexican food in Las Vegas.

In my youth, consumption of Mexican food in Vegas was usually only done after indulging of some non-alcoholic Roy Rogers and Shirley Temples on the Strip (extra grenadine of course :P ). In those days, I would be willing to wager that you could have fried a shoe and it probably would have tasted good to me. 

But this article indicated that Phat Phrank's was pretty darn good and I was craving some carne asada so... 

I arrived at about 12 pm on a Thursday and the place was hopping. A line of about 7 people quickly formed, which gave me some time to peruse a laminated menu for what I wanted to eat. I settled on a carne asada burrito with a drink for about 7 dollars. Frank gave me a number, and told me to pick a seat and they would bring my food out to me. About 3-4 minutes passed and a reasonable sized carne asada burrito was delivered to me. 

Stand by for carne asada burrito dissection...

Tortilla - This was ok - had the consistency of a whole wheat tortilla (a bit harder).  

Carne Asada - While this was seasoned appropriately, I was a bit disappointed at how much of the Carne was too fat to eat...I'm used to a little bit here and there, but about a 1/4 of my burrito was annoyingly fatty. 

Beans - Beans were flavor-fully non-offensive and didn't take away from the meat thankfully. 

So all in all, Phat Phranks's was Phrankly ok. The reviews on Yelp make me think that maybe that was just a bad burrito day for Frank and his family. Unfortunately, I have yet to try Mexican food outside of California that is worth a repeat trip, but I'm willing to go back to Phrank's and try something else next time I am in Vegas to see if I feel any differently.",qBMf1oskYaCUSO3is4hi0A,2,0,3,IS5SN2XPOsVHuUC3xbXryw

The problem I have with this is that there was no one behind me and I already ordered my food and was picking it up. Every situation is not the same, but the fact that Frank was so dead set on proving a point made it a bad experience this visit. He ignored me and took someone's order that came in after me. When I mentioned to one of the workers in the back that I was ready to pay for my order that was sitting right in the front she said you have to get in line. I said I was in line and that I came before the customer Frank was taking an order from. He then said no you weren't you were on your phone. He had a bad attitude about it and when I said you know its unfortunate that every time I've come here I've had a good experience except for this time. He then said no there's no problem.

They appeared to be a popular location and the seating was full and the lines were fast.

Shout out to their stellar customer service: the lady who took my phone order was sweet, quick, and efficient. And when I called back for their address, she gave me thorough directions, unsurprised that my GPS was coming up with errors. I really appreciated her help.

I finally got my opportunity to dive into my burrito, and it was enjoyable. The ratio of rice and beans was favorable- I prefer not to have too many in my burrito, if at all, and they were flavorful but light. The majority of the burrito was stuffed with shredded chicken, and there was a good amount of cheese, too. 
As for the chile verde component of my order- well, the chicken was flavorful and had a kick to it. But it wasn't noticeably ""chile verde"", it could have quite easily passed for simply a spicy chicken burrito. This coming from a girl who regularly goes to Albuquerque and knows chile verde very well- I'm even open to interpretations, but this just didn't have the tomatillo-chile kick to it that I was expecting after the rave reviews.

1809886,2015-03-11,3,dJF4C707KVhFx1qcRJhlEA,"First, a place owned and operated by an American can not be authentic and it's not! It is what most refer to as Tex-Mex.

I am getting more and more disappointed with the stacked Yelp deck and not being able to count on the slew of reviews that are more often than not bought through services.  Considering the amount of reviews this restaurant has and considering the reality that it is no where near to the best ""authentic"" Mexican food and also not deserving of a $ rating, it's reasonable to assume that the majority of reviews here are bought and paid for.  

I'm an Engineer married to a Latino. I live here in LV, CA and Texas.  My wife wanted to leave the minute she saw the menu and realized it wasn't authentic Mexican food. However, I hate leaving so we went ahead and ordered.  I got five street tacos on special for 7.45 plus tax and my wife had the Breakfast Chorizo Burrito for about $5.50 plus tax. So our total bill with tax was about $14.50.

The street tacos had about 1 tablespoon of meat...yes that's correct, one bite of food for about $1.50 and that's a supposed ""special"" price. My wife's burrito was larger but again not much meat and all eggs. Considering that you can get a Carne Asada burrito packed with meat and no eggs at almost any Mexican joint for the same price, again the price of $5.50 was way too high for a breakfast burrito. It should have cost no more than $3.99 because again it was mostly eggs.

It would have taken a third meal to fill two people up  because their portions are so small. In fact, after eating here we had to go to another restaurant to eat again. So if you factor in another meal around $7.00 now you are at $21 for two people...hardly what I would call $. It never ceases to amaze me how reviewers rate base on the price of an item instead of what you get for the price. Hence, if they charge only $1.50 for a taco and all other restaurants are charging $3.00 but the $1.50 taco only gives you one bite compared to the $3 taco that gives you 8 bites, the $3 taco is a better deal. 

The taste of the food was OK for Tex-Mex but nowhere near the taste of ""authentic"" Mexican food and when you get down to it nowhere near the best Tex-Mex.

I rate the value at $$ and the food at three stars as any legitimate, unbiased, review probably would. Also, the atmosphere had loud American music and was not at all conducive to an authentic Mexican establishment. And, I'm being extremely kind with a three star rating as we WILL NOT be returning which in all actuality makes it a two-star establishment.",ieF5HygMipxxReyxwKbbVQ,2,0,3,bt1YQk8bRXHo1tsrEL8Viw

Upon entering we were warmly greeted by Frank, who reminded me of my best friend's family and all of her uncles who warmly greet you and treat you like a compadre even though its your first meeting.  I observed him warmly greeting his regulars by name.

Frank kindly explained to us that you order at the counter and then they bring the order(s) to your table.  The food is brought out quickly once the order is placed.

There were a lot of choices and really hard to decide but ultimately we both ordered the chile verde combo plate (rice, beans and tortillas) with a med. drink that was this week's special for $7.89 each.

The combo plate was excellent and reminded me of eating at my best friend's house who are Hispanic, so I grew up eating the ""good stuff"".  Frank also explained and presented to us 4 small cups of different types of salsas, pico de gallo, I think a tomatillo sauce all which tasted fresh and yummy!!  My tablemate took the 2 milder sauces and I took the two others.  The red sauce was pleasantly hot and was very tasty.  I liked the green sauce also.

Frank and his family who were also are servers made sure are drinks were refilled and never made us feel unwelcomed as we sat for close to 3.5 hours at a table talking.  We only wished he served cocktails, so we could at least pay for our extended stay. Frank did mention he may be in the process of obtaining his liquor license to serve beer and wine.  It sounded like he may also open on Saturdays again when he gets this license and Sunset Road opens up.  Let's hope so and because its hard for me to get to this place on the weekdays.

Phrank or Frank however he spells his name, is a character. While there he had a Snoop Dogg reference for almost everything on the menu. Like, ""This burrito is off the hizzle."" So any man that can quote a rapper and make delicious food is good in my book.

I had the nachos, because Phrank told me they were ""bomb!"" So I had to go with that. I was kinda hesitant because I'm not a big fan of chili verde sauce, only liking it from a few places. The nacho chips we re slathered with this delicious green sauce and topped with cheese. Phrank was right...they were bomb! My girlfriend had the special of the day which were the fish tacos.

I guess when I think of fish tacos I'm thinking grilled fish, fresh salsa white rice black beans type . Maybe I'm just too much of a health foodie for phat phrank.",QcckMs29Z47tuSyWDCMUlA,1,0,1,L71Awo-fOIs1gZ64341S8g

That's where Phat Phrank's is.  I didn't even know that Decatur and Sunset existed until I a lunch meeting one day.  I kind of thought it was...just desert.

The menu is pretty simple, as you pick your meat, and then you can have it on a plate with rice and beans, or in a burrito with all the guts nicely wrapped together.  I ordered a carnitas burrito and a drink.  The burrito itself was well made, but the taste was bland.  This may seem strange (especially with the health food nuts), but I thought the burrito was TOO dry because of the lack of oil and grease.  I guess you could compare it to a burger that's too lean; you gotta have some fat in a burger, and you gotta have some grease in Mexican food.

Can't fault the service, though; food came out fast and they came by checking on refills at least 3 times.  That, and we loitered for about 45 minutes after eating, and they seemed to have no problem with it.

For now, this place gets a solid 3 from me.  Maybe if I revisit, I will get a new combo in my burrito and see how that comes out.",VtiIxILfK5geG7glGWDJlA,0,0,3,XI2zV2x1ZU_vOqVMdMJ_UA

We got the adobada torta and the carnitas burrito. The torta was great, and the bread was nice and toasty as mentioned many times here. The meat was very tender, and the green secret sauce oozed out the bottom. Only thing missing was some avocado.

The Burrito also had very tender meat, and the tortilla was the chewy kind that I love. It was a bit on the greasy side though (lots of cheese), and I wish it had some kind of texture contrast such as some crunch of lettuce or something. (Just beginning to think I'm not that into burritos.)

He offers three types of salsas. I think at least one should be more hot though. Like I said, Phrank is a hard working guy and really takes pride in his restaurant. He takes out the issue of LV Weekly that he was featured in a few months back and shows it to pretty much everyone that comes in. If I got in the Weekly I would too! :)

Other popular dishes that I will try next time include the chile verde burrito (featured in the Weekly) and the fish tacos.

FYI, they are located in the small plaza behind the Am/Pm. Turn in like you're going to Am/Pm and you'll see them there. It's a little hard to see the signage from the street until after you pass it.",sELpZpITOy9abQB3YY2Ugg,2,1,4,LRAhAFzFdFKQ2_Gls3-NHg

Nope, nope, nope, and I'm saying that as someone who likes several styles of Mexican cuisine, but not usually this type of down-home fare. 

The bean and cheese burrito is already calling me, and it's only 8 a.m. as I type this. The beans have a savoury nomness (that word was overdue in the making) and the cheese is a swirl of hot comfort. 

The bean tostada may as well be rebranded as a mini-salad, the toppings are so fresh and lovely. 

Even my orange Fanta seemed to have extra fizz. The pretty decor (check out those high ceilings and the violin near the front) convinced me to stay and have our first PP meal there instead of taking it home. 

But where Phat Phrank glows is with the ten-star service. We've enjoyed some excellent service lately, but owner Frank sets the bar out of reach of most mortals.

I didn't think this place was open after 6pm, which is part of the reason why I haven't tried their food yet. However, we left Halloween Mart, drove by, and the lights were on and the OPEN sign was lit up! SCORE. 

Apparently, on THURSDAYS they are open until 9pm because they recently started having some type of car meet up in the parking lot. 

NOW. THE FOOD. The inside is nothing special - not much atmosphere or ambiance. We took a look at the menu and the man behind the counter, who I assume is the owner, came over to us with a huge smile and said, ""HOW CAN I HELP YOU LADIES?""

We told him we were first timers. He explained how a few of the menu items are cooked and told us what his favorites were. As soon as he said FISH TACOS, my eyes lit up. I ordered one fish taco and one adobada taco with rice and beans. My girlfriend ordered one carne asada taco and one adobada taco - TO GO. While we were waiting, the same nice man came and chatted with us for a while, asking us where we were from and he actually engaged in some awesome and genuinely friendly conversation. I was very impressed with his hospitality! 

Our food was ready in a few minutes and as soon as I got home, I took one bite into that fried, crispy, juicy, flaky, white fish topped with lettuce and cilantro and a creamy sauce, and I just about died right then and there. Died with pleasure of course. :) Honestly, probably the second best fish taco I have ever had in my entire life, and I don't play around when it comes to fish tacos. 

The adobada meat was slightly dry and lacked a bit in flavor. The beans and rice were amazing. i can't quite put my finger on the spice/flavor that made them taste different, but there's definitely something special about them. 

Regardless, I cannot give less than 5 stars because of the beautiful explosion of taste that came out of that fish taco. I will be back!",1pqyIOcWh-EEHOR9AHUkWA,6,5,5,5aavdhS8HvOxyCdsjC91oQ

I could leave it as that and have you all wonder or I can let you all know why it's so AMAZING.

I've had their fish taco plate, other than the beans and rice sides the fish tacos were AMAZING. By far the best fish tacos I've had anywhere.  The fish were large crispy on the outside tender on the inside pieces, light and not greasy. The combination of all the fish with cabbage, green onion, cilantro, tartar sauce, and in my case lime and their hot sauce was AMAZING. My mouth is watering as I reminisce. I'll be back for you fish tacos.

Their carne asada torta was...  Oops sorry for the drool.  Their Carne asada torta was very delicious too. Well I might have reached my quota for using the word amazing but don't worry the carne asada tortas are equally as amazing as the fish tacos. I've seen other tortas that are bulky, bready, and just look good because of the huge size not flavor. Size isn't gigantic and not bready, so every bite was just of everything I wanted, something very tasty. There's probably even more ingredients than bread. I'll be back for you too LOL.

I didn't have this but a friend had their enchiladas because it was mentioned in the lvrj as Phat Phrank's signature dish. Now that looked like meal right there. I'm sure it has to be really good too just from what I've already had.  Plus it had a fried egg on it.  Anytime you throw a fried egg on anything it's instantly good.

Location is perfect for me, I'm always in the area though honestly I never knew they were there until a UYE. 

I like the musical instrument on the walls and how it's clean. Seats maybe 20-30 people.

Service was very good, friendly. Phrank and the lady that was there often checked on us, refilling drinks, bring food out quickly, conversing with us and making it an experience not like here is your food and now get out when your done. lol.

When I was released from the hospital the second time we visited your establishment s few times as I tried to resume a ""normal"" life but nothing has really tasted like much for the last two months. I've been able to taste ""sweet"" and ""salt"" when there are chemicals like msg involved but food and drinks have basically tasted no better than dirt.

Friday morning I had black coffee and for the first time I could taste food again and that coffee was fantastic. I stayed in that hospital until yesterday morning and the normally bland hospital food was wonderful.

I have been hearing about this place for a few months now and decided to give it a try thanks to my fellow yelpers. What I liked most about it was that it was different from the norm. For example, it is not a traditional sit down restaurant nor is it your average taqueria. There are a handful of tables and chairs that we were able to move around to accommodate our party of 4. However, the best thing about this place was the friendly environment Phrank creates in his restaurant. He is welcoming, and constantly checks on you to make sure your visit is going smoothly. I like that!

As far as the food in concerned, it was pretty good for the most part. My wife and I decided to share a variety of dishes, so we could sample the different flavors that were on the menu. We started off with the nachos, which came loaded with tender Chile Verde and cheese over the top of crispy tortilla chips. Good, but I forgot that I don't like cheese with pork. Something weird happens when the cheese mixes with the sauce from the meat. The result is a gelatin mixture of wet, sloppy, cheesy goo. Next time - no cheese please. 

We also tried the carne asada burrito with rice inside. Tasty, but I had better versions in town -Los Tacos for example. The fish tacos I kept hearing so much about were ""fishy"", and disappointing. But hey- we are in Las Vegas! How fresh can the fish be? The star of the meal was the adobada taco that was seasoned well and went perfectly with the cabbage and hot sauce. Next time, I would order a handful of those and be just fine. 

Prices are reasonable, as we spent 23.00 for all that food and a large soft drink. We will be back to visit Phrank and support his restaurant that he obviously cares so much about.",fOut10lknIp64tm3z6UTNg,1,1,4,lczKYOgeCh0pg9uNNb8k-A

This is their 6th year of being in business, but why did it taste and feel like it was only their first week in business? Super uninterested and stand-offish service, wobbly broken table and beyond mediocre food - I was thoroughly not amused here.

The deal-breaker for me were the fish tacos - if you're going to charge a premium price per taco ($4.39), it should be hooked up with decent flavor and quality? Nope. The fish itself was a decent portion size, but the breading was identical to the fish sticks from the freezer aisle - pretty weak. The ""Cabbage Tuesday"" as yelper Ardie Y. comically and accurately puts it - was over done in abundance and upon inspecting the the bits of scallion and cilantro mixed in, it was browning and drying out. Not to mention, the ""special"" sauce was lacking much flavor. The overall tacos were a huge disappointment; I would prefer a Rubio's fish taco over these and they are also a far better price for what you get! 

I also sampled the Huevos rancheros for $7 and semi-stale, boring chips but with a generous amount of guacamole for $5 - I would also rate both dishes as average. Nothing to see here folks. Here's the worst part - quickly after my last bites, I immediately felt a pain in my stomach. Was the salsa too spicy? Not to my chili eating tastebuds it wasn't. (Shrug)

In all honesty, the vibe of the whole place threw me for a loop. I was hoping for down to earth, welcoming and eager service with a memorable, flavorful lunch, but all I ended up getting was a stomach ache and looking forward to getting the heck out of there real quick.",u_wqt9RshdZsoj8ikLqoEQ,68,52,2,iBl_Tm5-2AxyQJaDreu1YQ

I paid 6 and change for 4 tacos at Tony's Tacos on Fort Apache by far the best tacos on the west side smh and it doesn't come with cabbage (the way it's suppose to be)  FYI the only tacos that should come with cabbage are fish tacos and specifically finely shredded cabbage not obnoxious chunks that were in my asada burrito... most def don't know what all the hype was about, were y'all really being serious about these reviews..

2668881,2012-03-12,0,dJF4C707KVhFx1qcRJhlEA,"Phat Phranks is a short drive from my house and have been meaning to try it for some time now. The  6am to 6pm hours made it very difficult for me to eat there. They really should change to 8a-8pm at the very least so people could try it out after work. I am not a good morning person so chances were slim me trying to before work and after work it is closed already. I am so glad I finally go to test out Phat Phranks. It is right off the 215 and decatur. 

I had the breakfast burrtio with egg and cheese and a bean and cheese tostada. The breakfast burrito was excellent. The only one better in town is at Nordstrom Cafe but for the price and the flavors packed into it, this is a solid #2. The Tostada was good but nothing too special. The food gets 4 stars. Frank  was the one taking the order and ringing you up. The family is the ones cooking and serving and they were very friendly, attentive and you get the feeling you are in their home and not in their place of business. There are so many businesses in Las Vegas that need to take a lesson from Phat Phrank's and learn what real service is. So with good food and service as good as good as it gets, not to mention an indy family owned place Phrank's easily get's 5 stars in my book. Support it and do it regularly because places like this need our support to survive. They are a rarity in Las Vegas and I will be doing my part supporting Phrank so I have options other than chains to go to.",40m0541Z_KexYkdvvqHJIQ,2,1,5,GAa1D_QTokJQCCy_Rw931g

2759569,2013-07-03,3,dJF4C707KVhFx1qcRJhlEA,"As usual, I ended up coming here based on the bookmark part of the Yelp phone app. I bookmarked this place awhile back because of all the check ins from my Yelp friends and couldn't help but notice the four and a half star rating. Judging by the name, you wouldn't think it was a Mexican joint.

As soon as I walk in I am greeted by Frank (or should I say Phrank?) himself and asked if it was my first time. I guess me looking for some kind of menu on the wall gave it away. He directed me to the menus on the counter. He briefed me on some of the popular items that people get. The thing that stood out to me was that anything on the menu whether it was breakfast or lunch was available all day. That's a major plus if you ask me because who doesn't want a breakfast burrito for lunch sometimes?

Anyways, I went with the Adobada Burrito because im trying to cut down on red meat so pork is the next best alternative. The burrito itself had shredded chunks of tender pork mixed with some rice and beans. The pork itself was a bit salty but was still edible especially with the green, red, and spicy red sauces that came with it. All were excellent when you pour some on the burrito.

Based on the menu, I will definitely be back to try some of the others that people have mentioned. The only thing that I find negative might be the hours. 8 am to 5 pm. So if I wanted to take my fam for dinner, it wont work. I guess based on the location, they are only busy during the morning til late afternoon.

Selection:  ""Steak"" Burrito upgraded to ""wet"" with red sauce.

The bread was nicely pressed and the meat was nicely seasoned, it's just for the price, it left me wanting more. The torta itself was just a little over half the size of a regular torta that you would find in any taco spot and it didn't come with any chips or anything that would substantiate the experience to equal something that felt like a full meal.

3247971,2018-01-03,0,dJF4C707KVhFx1qcRJhlEA,"I rarely leave reviews on Yelp but this particular experience was too noteworthy not to share.  I ordered a breakfast burrito with 2 meats, chips and salsa and rice.  When I arrived I was told my bill was $16 which seemed much higher than the prices advertised on their online menu which Yelp redirects you to when choosing  menu.  When I started questioning the prices the server said I was wrong and gave me a printed out menu.  I told her these prices do not match what is online.  She shrugged.  I took out my phone and told her she charged me $2.00 for rice add-on when the menu states $0.75 and her excuse was they charge double when it is ordered as a side as opposed to adding on to an entree.  There is no mention of this deceptive practice on either menu (online or printed out).  Furthermore the price of the breakfast burrito is listed as $5.99 and I was charged $7.99.  When I showed her this, she said, ""Oh we are locked out and cannot change that menu any more.""  I said these are significant discrepencies of over $3.00 for what should have been a $12-13 meal.  Her response, ""You don't have to come back.""  I asked who the manager is and the heavy set blonde responded said she was, I told her she needs to fix her business since this is unacceptable.  Her attitude was disgusting from a customer service perspective, first telling me I was wrong on the pricing and then making an excuse that they can no longer modify the menu as if that was my problem.  GUESS WHAT?  If your menu is out of date and you can't modify it any more for failure to pay your bills, you go to Yelp and you list your menu with all of its deceptive caveats online so that you don't piss off future customers before you tell them they ""don't have to come back!""",igPgQb05sjFtG1sSygqerw,0,0,1,9xSfQZBImtPA03dzNf41tQ

This is good, honest Mexican fare at a really respectable price. It won't burn a hole in your wallet and it's also not as unpredictable as the stuff served up and places like Roberto's, Don Tortaco, Cafe Rio, and others. Everything has the feel of being freshly prepared rather than slopped together out of vats and it tastes just as good. I really appreciated the texture of the tortillas which were warm and satisfying, dense and chewy enough so they don't split open in your hands, but not gluey and overwhelming, either.

The man himself, Frank, is among the most welcoming proprietors I have encountered anywhere in the Las Vegas valley. He took a genuine interest in me and my wife and remembered my name upon my next visit - admittedly this was the very next day, but that should stand as testimony to the impact of his hospitality and cooking.

This isn't one of those fancy, designer Mexican restaurants, and should not be held up against that sort of establishment - these two sub-categories of Mexican cuisine can barely even be considered the same type of food.

It's in a small strip mall off Decatur and the 215, down the street from Rhythm Kitchen and owned by a Cali transplant named (you guessed it...) Frank. While they do have some traditional Mexican dishes, this restaurant isn't your typical 'authentic' taco shop. It's a more modern take on Mexican/Southern Cali food.

Their tacos are a little larger than some street tacos elsewhere, using 6-inch tortillas instead of the 4-inch ones. The two tacos I had (carne asada and adobada) came with a good sized portion of steak and pork, respectively, with a little cabbage and cilantro on top, with your choice of 4 salsas on the side. While the carne asada taco wasn't the best I've had, it was still very good and the adobada was so tender, but crispy around the edges and packed with intense flavors.

And the churros... mmmmm... the churros. They are reason enough to stop by Phat Phrank's. Four of them stacked on a plate and drizzled with caramel, chocolate and vanilla. Big enough to share, but I refuse to.

The customer service here is second to none, with the staff bringing your food out when it's ready and Frank walking around chatting up all the patrons and checking to make sure everything's ok.

The woman at the counter was extremely friendly, helpful, and patient answering my questions and offering suggestions.  There was no one in line behind me, so I felt I had plenty of time to look the menu over and ask questions, etc.

I got the famous Adobada torta-  the seasoning on the pork was spot on and a huge plus for me was not having any fatty pieces of meat in my sandwich because I really hate that when I am eating any type of food.  I told my friend that the torta was one of the best food items I have ever had.  The sandwich is big and will definitely fill you up- lots of pork no doubt.  Not like other places where they fill your torta with all lettuce and you have to search for the remaining ingredients.  The torta also has a cilantro sauce and the bread is toasted!!

We also tried the fish tacos-  these were good too, but they did not compare to the torta.  Nothing that really stuck out for me on the fish tacos, but I have absolutely no complaints either.  Large fried pieces of white fish on a tortilla with cabbage.

I equally loved the chips and guacamole-- homemade chip (bonus) and a very nice serving size of guacamole at a very reasonable price.  The flavor of the guacamole was delicious- smooth and a lovely creamy guacamole taste.  Can't go wrong! I think people complain about the chips because they are more all natural rather than loaded or over salted.  I see no problem at all with that.  Have an open mind and try something new!

On my way back to the airport Sunday, all I could think about was Phat Phranks and how I wanted to have another torta. Sadly, they are closed on Sundays.  Can you send me one or two or five please!?!?!?  I have nothing but an Adobada torta on my mind.

I was around the area one night to gas up at the station inside that business plaza. Immediately, my eyes feasted upon the Popeyes adjacent to the gas stop, so my mind fixated on a meal there. Luckily, I decided to yelp nearby eats! & good thing I did! I read up some reviews on Phat Phrank's, and after some thoughtful reviews I stepped inside. 

Frank really is a music enthusiast, I've spoken to him on it.. but music is not what this review is about! 

2 Words: Fish tacos. 
I've tried something different every visit (being a regular): carne asada tostada, trainer salad (recommend if you're going ""green""), barbacoa tacos, but oh sweet fishies, their fish tacos hook you! Get it...? Hook you..? No?.. I tried. 

Frank tells me that their breakfast burritos are recommended. & that's exactly what I'm getting next! I mean.. after 3 fish tacos, please! :]

I told him to suggest a meal, and he did, so ended up ordering a couple of awesome tacos.

The 2nd time I visited wasn't so pleasant. I don't think Frank even recognized me, not to mention I didn't get my drink that I ordered. I left my order number (these things they give you when you order) on the table along with some of my belongings and went to use the bathroom. By the time I came back, my order number was gone, my food wasn't there, and I had to interrupt an order that was being taken by Frank to tell him what was going on. He got the attention of his workers and they brought my food on a tray, but I ordered it to-go.

There's Mexican food that's good for a hangover.  There's Mexican food that's good for kids.  Then, there's Phrank's.  Phrank is a humble man, and he claims that it's tough for him to put his finger on what makes his family's place so awesome.  I'll try to lay it out for you:

1.  The meat is unbelievably well prepared.  The carnitas are the perfect mix of seasoned tender goodness with that bit of crispiness on the top.  The chicken was moist, plump, perfectly seasoned, and changed our lives.  If giving up all my worldly possessions would result in my being able to eat the barbacoa every day, I would seriously consider it.

2.  The menu is not the typical hundred item monster that you find at your standard taqueria.  Phrank and Phamily know what they're good at, and they stick to it.

3.  Service, service, service.  This family knows how to keep customers happy.",ZR0iN7nbtl9BES1vK6dwtQ,3,3,5,OqUdbhSDVfz51wJ1BkISqw

The tortillas completely fell apart when picking them up. That's why a lot of places put two tortillas under the taco.  The meat was good quality - woo hoo!.  Flavor was good but there was some cabbag-y stuff in the tacos.  I've lived in Mexico and ""ain't seen no cabbage in my tacos"" before, but ok.

Since I'm on my Lent 'No Meat' diet, I was browsing the menu for Meatless items.  The man behind the register asked me if he could help out....I told him my situation and he was very happy to help me decide what to get.  He suggested a Cheese Enchilada ($6.99).

http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/dJF4C707KVhFx1qcRJhlEA?select=ufDngqGNAIWOrMqXuAzvng

He chatted me up while ringing up my order and I discovered he was Phrank, the owner.  He's such a cool guy.  He's from So Cal and we were talking a bit about the State as I'm also a So Cal transplant.....although I left many years before he did.

After a few minutes he brought out my order.  I was pleased to see that the Cheese Enchilada also came with a side of Rice & Beans....although it meant that I ordered too much food.  Sometimes my stomach tricks me into these situations.  Oh well.

I went for the Cheese Enchilada first....and yum!  It was very, very good.  I'm glad Phrank suggested it to me.  Next up was the Burrito.....unfortunately, after all of the flavor from the Enchilada, the Burrito tasted just OK.  For a Bean Burrito though, it was solid.  Next time I'm going to order just one or the other.

I'll have to come back after Lent so I can try out some of the other signature dishes.  If they're as good as the Cheese Enchilada, I'll be back a lot.

Known for the Adobada Torta, I had to try it out.  I've had quite a few tortas in my time so i was expecting the usual with maybe a twist on the meat.  Y holé! Upon arrival, something is different here.  My bun is flattened and grilled, did somebody step on my samich?  Nope, this is part of what makes the difference of a great torta.  Some torta buns or bollilos  can be a bit fluffy so when eating you get a bit high ratio of bun to meat.  By flattening the torta, you get a more even playing field of meat, veggies n flavors.  Upon first bite, there's is a delicious mix of tasty, crunchity pork, cabbage, lettuce, cilantro, tomatoe, secret sauce and green onions give a lil flavor kick!  

Choice of salsas:
Mild-your standard mild mannered mix
Hot-feisty n smokey with a blend of chili de arbol (type of chili used by real Mexicans) 
Green-tangy mix of chilies, cilantro, onions, I'm green with envy! 

I told Frank, Phrank? That this is one of the best tortas ever!  I'm not eating another torta in vegas ever again... He laughed, which seems to be his character, a jolly phellow who talks to all the patrons.  Go Raiders?

Based on the execution of the torta, I'd say they have a great venue here... Mexican food with a notch up level of creativity! Say goodbye ol Robert-O....

Items Ordered:

Two Fish Tacos Combination Plate $9.99

The fish tacos with there highly recommended secret sauce reminded me instantly of Rubio's.  Same great taste I've become very fond of and the rice / beans made just like grandma use to do when I was a kid.  Very authentic Mexican flavors and definitely left a lasting impression.

I would come back again, but the invisible menu and having to rely on staff for refills really turned me off.  Very awkward way of business to treat a Mexican food joint almost like a deli.  That's my two cents, but excellent food!",u90s9wJ9pMK2FMpy5F8Wpg,8,4,4,iOeXHCtkWLfrr4v4iL2u-g

Don't get me wrong - I did think the food was fantastic, but I distinctly remember thinking it was an easy 4* place, but not really deserving of the big 5*.

Somehow, though, every time I've visited since - no matter how little time has passed since my last trip there - I take my first bite and always wind up thinking to myself, ""wow, this is even better than I remembered"". I don't know how they do it, whether it's the fresh ingredients, top notch execution, or the little touches they add to the preparation that just give the food here that wonderful delightfulness that foodies always seek.

So yeah, the tortas (either adobado or carnitas, depending on my mood) have basically reached comfort food status in my book. Order some beans, rice, and sour cream add-ons as supplements, and life is very good when I visit Phat Phrank's.",65Bcz8_Rbbrcz_HGpq9Y-g,0,0,5,snA4CuCIDM-KNQHkU09MLQ

I ended up here because it was bookmarked and because the other place I was going to try didn't open until 7 either and I wasn't going to wait there that long.  See it was an early flight.

When the doors were unlocked, I went in and had my choice of where to sit.  It's not a large place.  The server brought my menu and after some thought, I got the Huevos Divorciados, divorced eggs.  It comes with potatoes, refried beans, and tortillas.  The divorced of the eggs is one red and one green.  The green is topped by some good chile verde and the red is gotten from a red sauce that has a bit of a kick.

On the wall on the west side of the room is an area where they have the plastic ware you dispense for yourself and there are napkins there, too.

The breakfast was good but the plate was detracted by how poorly it looked on arrival.  The potato slices run on to the eggs which run onto the beans.  It tasted better than it looked.  Perhaps less runny beans or a plate with compartments?

Service was OK after a little bit of a shaky start.  I had to wait for the coffee but that was OK.  They just opened and they were brewing a fresh pot.

The potatoes are a little crunchy which I loved!  They have a good variety of different burritos. I can't wait to come back here and try something different. 

The service was amazing. The staff was funny and energetic. It looks like a place where u order then they call your number and you get up and grab your meal but we sat down and they brought our food to us. 3 different staff members asked how we were and wanted to make sure we had everything we needed.

Ordered a fish taco and a chicken taco. The fish taco was ok, nothing exciting just your run of the mill fish taco. Lots of lettuce and no tomatoes in the pico de gallo and only 1 tortilla (most restaurants serve them with two). At over $4 for a single taco (no beans or rice or even tortilla chips) I thought it was pretty overpriced. The chicken taco was pretty boring, again no pico de gallo and tons of lettuce. The shredded chicken was lacking flavor so I piled on the salsa. Breakfast looked more reasonably priced and seems to have good reviews so I'll probably give it a try one day.

To our surprise, there were three fast casual choices in this restaurant row. Since all the menus were posted in the windows, we surveyed our options. We decided on trying something new and patronized Phat Phranks. 
Although the name sounds like a hot dog stand to me, it's actually Mexican food. 
The restaurant has a strange hodge podge of decor. It's Asian/musical? But spotless, clean and cute nonetheless. 
The man at the counter could not have been more welcoming and polite. I assume this was Phrank, as he was featured in pictures on the wall. He asked if we had been before an then walked us through the menu. 
After a tantalizing description, we both settled on a carnitas and Carne asada torta. The sandwiches were awesome!!
Soft bread griddled crisp and filled with flavorful, tender meat, crisp, fresh shredded cabbage, cilantro, and onion.  The bread was smeared with a refreshing white creamy sauce.  Phrank had explained they use the same stuff on their fish tacos.  The sandwiches are served with lime wedges and 4 types of fresh salsa.  All had great flavor.  We decided we preferred the carne asada slightly more than the carnitas but loved both.
The menu included lots of choices for tacos, burritos, tortas, nachos, salad, flautas and so on.  We wereso happy when we left and spent $16 for lunch for two with two drinks.  
Phrank even stopped by our table 3 times to check on our level of happiness.  He offered more salsa, and refilled our drinks!

At 10 AM in the morning or so, it was pretty empty, so we were able to order right away, and our food came our relatively quickly (around 5 minutes or so after we placed the order). I went with the barbacoa breakfast platter, while my fiancee went with the huevos rancheros. Both were really good - the barbacoa was cooked enough so that it shredded easily, and it really goes well with solidly-done scrambled eggs. I do say I wish I could have combined it with the huevos rancheros' pepper sauce, which added a real nice kick to her dish and made the dish flavors much more vibrant. While I like the idea of the thinly-sliced fried potatoes (they sure looked like plantain chips, but they definitely tasted like potatoes), they're a bit on the light side. Given the rest of the meal is relatively hearty, I think a bigger serving, or adding a side of Mexican-style rice, would have been a better way to round out the dish.

I'd like to come back sometime to try the regular offerings, but breakfast on its own was okay. It's better than your average breakfast, but I've had better Mexican-inspired breakfast dishes at other places.",CJmtS1Uk1KSsY2MWol_E7g,0,0,3,0hJj8ln5NNpju9c_8qHhAg

My hubby tried Phat Phrank's last week with some coworkers and has been raving about the fish tacos every day since then.  I wanted in on the action, so when he had the opportunity to go out for lunch again, I met him there and had a great lunch.

The restaurant itself is in a small strip mall with a couple of other food places.  It is kind of hard to see from the street, so keep that in mind when you venture over here.  Once you find Phrank's, your happy tummy time begins!  You walk in the door and can smell the lovely Tex-Mex aromas swirling around the place.  Your mouth starts watering immediately and you get excited for the food to come.  Yummmm.  

Phat Phrank's is a small place though, with about 6 tables.  We got there and there was only 1 table open.  My hubby grabbed it while I waited in the really long line.  Within 2 minutes, the line was actually out of the door with people waiting.  Luckily the line moves pretty fast.  The food also comes out pretty quickly too, so there is a nice flow to the place.

After looking at the menu, I was torn between the carne asada and the pork chili verde plates.  I asked the one and only Phrank, who was working the counter, and he told me to go for the chili verde.  I trusted him and went with the verde.  Boy, was I happy with my choice!  The pork chili verde was so tender and tasty.  It had so many layers of flavor that it made you eat slowly to savor each bite.  Delish!

My hubby went for the fish tacos again.  He is addicted to fish tacos and gets them everywhere we go.  He says these are the best in town, hands down.  He really has tried dozens and dozens, so I trust him on fish tacos.  I was going to try a bite, but by the time I asked for one, he had already devoured them.  You snooze you lose, I guess.

The hot sauce here is really great good too.  I recommend the hot hot sauce.  It is super flavorful without being completely mouth burning.  It has some great depth to it and I had to ask for a second serving because it was that good!

The plates came with the main entree, as well as refried beans, Mexican rice, and homemade tortillas.  Now no one tell my Grandma, but the beans and tortillas were better than hers!  I have NEVER said that before because hers are the best of the best!  The beans from Phrank's were simply perfect and I could have eaten a whole pot of them them.  The flour tortillas tasted just like my grandma's homemade ones.    The tortillas were just AWESOME.  

If you have never had a homemade tortilla, you are missing out.  Luckily you can go to Phrank's and get some right now!",8DBH3BpLINfTAK_Up5BtUQ,7,7,5,uelEEvh8bcAkgMHgtj4DYg

The rice looked fluffy, but there were a few undercooked, crunchy grains. The beans tasted a little like they were from a can. I also ordered their chips and guacamole, which were pretty good, but not worth $5. I also got a large horchata for almost $3, which would've been okay if it didn't taste like the powdered stuff you get from the Latin market. Lastly, the lady who took my order was NOT friendly at all. She seemed like she was annoyed and like she didn't want to be there. For the tacos, she asked if I wanted mild, medium, or hot salsa, but she didn't elaborate on what types (red or green), and I totally didn't feel welcomed to ask. I wasn't greeted, thanked, or asked anything other than what I was ordering and that was because I walked up to the counter.

 I came to Las Vegas as a vacation for my birthday. While on the West Coast, I was definitely in the mood for a breakfast burrito. Found this place via Yelp and decided to try it out. I had the chicken, egg, and cheese breakfast burrito, with mild salsa and a side of fries. The chicken was flavored nicely but was a bit on the salty side.  Of the 3 women running the place at the time, only one was pleasant. The lady at the cash register acted as if it was an issue just for us to finalize what our order would be.  She was not very helpful in providing feedback on the menu when asked, and her tone of voice was not what you would think someone would give in a service based establishment. When asked for ketchup, I was directed to go get my own packets at the front of the restaurant. No napkins, no silverware.

The Chilean Verde burrito is the best I have ever had and because it is so great I won't try anything else. Family members have tried other items and rave about them. My son-in-law had a Carne Asada burrito during our last visit and loved it. I worked in East Los Angeles and became a connoisseur of Mexican food.

Facility: It is a very small place located in a strip mall. There are tables and chairs for about 20 folks. I was pretty impressed with the fork, spoon, and knife dispensers. Such a sanitary way to get your plastic ware!  It's a fast food type feel, but they bring the food to your table. 

Service:  I went to the counter and a very personable, nice guy greeted me. Even though there was a few people behind me, he took the time to talk to me. At the end of my order, he asked my name, and introduced himself...turns out it was Frank, the owner. What a nice guy!!!!!  The rest of the staff were friendly and attentive too.

Well, I did drop some in the tip bucket up front when I ordered, so I hope they all share that. Sorry guys, next time I will tip for the great table service too!!!!

Food:  I ordered the Carnitas plate with a side of hot sauce and fried jalapeños. The Carnitas (3.5/5) were good. I liked the beans and rice with a touch of salad on my plate too. The homemade flour tortillas (5/5) were so good! The fried jalapeños (2.5/5) were actually grilled (or fried) and marinated. It's not that I didn't like them, but I just prefer the natural flavor of either a fresh or plain grilled jalapeño. Frank came by and I mentioned my preference, and he immediately exchanged them for fresh jalapeños. Yum! This topped my meal off perfectly. 

Overall:  I'm a fan. I like the food, I liked the service, and Frank was a real gem. Too bad it's not close to my house, but I will be back.",-50XWnmQGqBgEI-9ANvLlg,4,1,4,4cmhcdQ0IJTdgqzT64_j_g

Frank is running one of the best hidden spots in town.  I'd been there once before, but I recently visited again to try Frank's famous ceviche.  And it was just as outstanding as I'd been told.  I don't know how he finds such fresh fish in the middle of the desert.  Clearly Frank is a miracle worker.

The other highlight was tasting Frank's chimi cheesecake.  A tortilla stuffed with cream cheese, deep-fried, and then coated with generous cinnamon sugar and caramel?  Um, yes please!

Frank's little restaurant is a total gem.  So here's my tip to Californians driving up the northbound 15 to kick off a Vegas  weekend: A couple miles before you reach the Strip, make a little detour onto the westbound 215, and drive one exit to Decatur Blvd.  Phat Phrank's will be right there, waiting to fill your belly with delicious Mexican-American fare that's made with love.

Looking for a legit Mexican food spot?! Phat Phrank's is the REAL DEAL. Believe the hype, it's real.

When we pulled in, there were zero cars in the lot and zero customers. Not gonna lie, I was suspect. But, trust #YelpNation to get it right.

They were tasty, not greasy, fat, and I am totally in love with the thin fried potato - my mouth is now watering, just great. Jacob also gave us all the salsas to try and they were all super tasty. He was super friendly and made our meal at Phat Phrank's that much more enjoyable. To top everything off, we got a holy yumminess of 32oz Horchata #happybellies

This place is a serious gem and I wish we could have stopped by for lunch or dinner. But, there's no doubt, Phat Phrank's is in our rotation from now on ""When in Vegas...""",WzFSlyPO-kARif92D_u_dQ,8,6,5,pBOdW6QF-6lov88cFONS2w

It is similar quality as Roberto's.  Those who go to Roberto's know that you go when you're drunk or high.  Or extremely hungry and it's right there...

Location - located on a strip mall right next to a gas station and other food joints. Corner of Decatur and Sunset.

Atmosphere - the place is small but it's pretty clean and cozy. It was pretty busy when I went during lunch hour. 

Food - I'm a nocturnal type of person so I always wake up late. I was craving some type of Mexican breakfast and I came across this place. I had the Chorizo breakfast burrito with a side of Barbacoa taco. Like I mentioned earlier, I thought the food was average. Prices are decent and it's something you'd expect from a place like this. I've had better ones at a local Roberto's ... 

Service - no complaints on service. It's the typical order from the counter, pay and they'll being the food to you type of shindig. It was pretty prompt and the lady was quite nice. 

Overall, I'd probably give this place another go. Maybe for something quick or maybe to try their famous chocolate drizzled churro. If you're looking for Mexican food or some type of Mex fusion, I'd go somewhere else...",A872opA-l6OeCy9x1b2QFw,2,1,3,-d4sfWIrO-kAMea-xgZZRw

Not to be compared in any way with a Robertos other than interior seating style, Frank serves up an amazing variety of tasty Mexican eats. 

Frank can often be seen working in the restaurant. You'll know him by his big smile and warm demeanor. It's clear he opened this restaurant because he loves to feed people with the delicious meals he provides - he'll often make quick rounds through the tables with a ""thumbs up?"" look, making sure you're happy with his eats. 

My favorite - Adobada Torta. Thin, soft bread (almost like a Mexican style pita bread), warmed to a nice crisp on the flattop. Crispy and flavorful Adobada pork is generously added with a fresh, cooling slaw. A nice combination of crunch, fat, heat, salt, and fresh. A good sized meal even for big-eaters, this is my ""go to"" at less than $8.

Zero complaints about this place. I'd love to see him open up a spot with more tables and a ""dinner"" atmosphere, but until then, this is the lunch spot you can't miss.",QCoBkB_m0v9smTM9voMZMg,0,0,5,O9VZR_igFHfxIFcnJMd1qQ

Parking lot is very cramped and congeated. But worse yet, the spaces are all mini spaces. If you drive an suv, you're almost touching both lines simultaneously. I have a small car and had to squeeze out of it.

Not enough space in the dining room, it was packed for lunch. The lady at the counter just kinda looked at me instead of greeting. Then barely holds her hand out to return my card, I had to lean over the entire counter to get it back. I say thank you, she says nothing at all.

Pork carnitas plate. It was decent, kinda small. Took 25 minutes to come out. 25 minutes. Horrible.

When they deliver your food, they don't say anything. Just drop it off. You then have to get up, find your way to the fork and napkin dispensers and get your own stuff.

I ordered every taco on the menu to try. The best one is the adobada taco. A close second is the barbacoa. The meat is good quality but it's the simplicity of the taco that I love. Cilantro and some cabbage. Nice touch. 

Props to Phabulous Phat Phrank and his great taco shop. I would recommend this place to anyone that would like to have their mind blown while eating some good phreaking tacos.

We pulled up, hopped out and started to peruse the offerings of each establishment when a young guy walked out of Phrank's and advised us: ""The food here is phantastic."" Well, maybe he said, ""fantastic."" Anyways, we were sold!

The interior is simple. Apparently, they're working on a music theme and accepting donations to deck the walls. We took notice of two violins hanging over the counter. We assumed Phrank was a virtuoso of sorts, but our vision was squashed when the lady behind the counter told us they were simply donated by customers. 

Speaking of the lady behind the counter--she was a complete sweetheart! She was enthusiastic, helpful and sincere. I was curious about the tea selections, so she provided me with a sample. It was too sweet for my liking, but I appreciated the taste.  She recommended the Trainer Salad, and I had been eyeing it already, so my decision was easy.

The Trainer was a tasty, refreshing lunch. I loved the cabbage and cilantro additions. I also chowed down on the big, tender chunks of white meat chicken. Too often at a Mexican restaurant the chicken quality is, well, dicey, but Phrank does chicken right. They serve the salad with fresh salsas as dressing, and I happily dumped a healthy dose of the tomatillo offering on top. I must say that was a strong call on my part. Of course, it helped that the salsa was tangy and delicious. The salad also came with guac and beans, and both were equally yumalicious. My husband had some tacos, and I can report that there is a lotta of meat in those tortillas. Be careful or you might just end up phat yourself!",qewG3X2O4X6JKskxyyqFwQ,18,11,4,HdE-hxALMsa94CD5EZDcGw

*Nachos - I'm actually not a nachos person, but his are done the way nachos should be! Tons of delicious shredded pork... an order is definitely a meal for 2 people!
*Breakfast Burrito - the best breakfast burrito I've had in Vegas, by far! It comes with eggs, yummy crispy potatoes, cheese, and your choice of meat. He mixes everything to ensure every bite is perfect. When I'm having a bad day, I call ahead and pick one up on my way to work!
*Fajitas - I have FINALLY found delicious fajitas in Vegas! I had the chicken ones for lunch today and really enjoyed them. The chicken was shredded (as opposed to the creepy pre-cut strips with faux-grill marks you find at say Chili's) and had 3 colors of peppers and onions mixed in. I'm not usually a fan of chicken, but this had an amazing amount of flavor. 
*Churros - caramel and chocolate sauce.. mmmmmmm

I can also highly recommend their catering services ! ""Phrank"" helped us pick out a freaking feast for well under $10 a person. We had platters of enchiladas and tacos, guacamole, and ceviche. Everything was delicious and was ready right on time. We picked it up ourselves, but it was well packaged and transport -ready.

5339829,2013-06-11,0,dJF4C707KVhFx1qcRJhlEA,"Excellent! Another bookmark down.

This review is long overdue. I had lunch here almost a month ago and I could not stop raving about it to coworkers when I got back. The experience is still fresh in my mind. I had the daily special Fish Tacos, but I asked for flour tortillas instead of corn. Everything was made fresh, and the slaw on my tacos was TO DIE FOR. The creamy sauce was perfectly seasoned and the fish was fresh and tasty. The rice wasn't mushy - it was cooked perfectly. My husband had a chicken burrito and he could not get over the salsa - he said it was the best salsa he had in his life.

Nestled behind a gas station and some heavy road construction, Phat Phrank's is a jewel in the rough. It's perfect for a power lunch, or maybe picking some to-go food when you just don't feel like cooking. 

As I sat there one random Friday afternoon, I had seen people from all walks of life come in and out happy. There were suits, construction workers, Louis Vuitton ladies, and families either dining in or picking up to go orders.

Frank was there during my visit and couldn't have been nicer. He made sure to talk to every customer and made sure everyone was enjoying their meal. He's super helpful when you're trying to figure out what you should order. I asked him why they weren't open on weekends and he had said they were once, but business wasn't worth a 7 day schedule. He did say once the construction on sunset was completed, they would definitely be open Saturdays again. 

Fresh food, great service, reasonable pricing - this place is an easy 5 stars.
As the unfortunate duchess of a certain Roberto's, I can proudly tell you that this place is definitely worth stopping by and checking it out !",sAEUJb9C6_ekgc8BIScZ5w,2,1,5,z3Im_YUIzkrceMeD_mxYgw

I actually ate the sandwich open face because there was so much everything going one. Wonderful stuff.  The bean tosta was large and topped with veggies...very creamy beans. I tried all 3 salsas and the pass perfecty. Not watery, nice and thick with great heat. If you are looking for a nice little spot off of 215 to grab a bite and go north, south east or west.

My friend and I decided to try this place after I did some yelping around. Saw this, was on edge a bit because I don't normally go for Mexican but then saw the amazing reviews ...so we just had to give it a go. Let me tell you, no regrets.

The guy who took our orders, whom I assume to be none other than the owner himself, was very nice. My friend ordered the Fish Taco Combo with hot sauce, which was their special for the day while I ordered the flautas. Phrank then suggested that the green sauce goes great with the flautas so I took his suggestion and went with that. He even asked us if it was our first time and that we should try his breakfast items and tortas next. Thumbs up. I liked how he tries to get to know you just a little bit. 

When our food came, it looked delicious. My friend loved his fish tacos. And my flautas! My goodness! They were so good. The chicken was moist had good flavor while the outside was crispy but not burnt. The green sauce that Phrank suggested went WONDERFUL with the flautas. I was so happy and in foodie heaven. However, I wasn't a big fan of the guac that came with it because it just tasted weird to me. It was salty .. hum. Anyways, both of our orders came with rice and beans, which were also very good. So when you order your food, eat them fresh!!!

After we were done with our food, we wanted to try their churros. We've seen some of the pictures on yelp and we just HAD to. Though, when we did try it, we were a bit disappointed. It wasn't as light as we would've thought. It was actually quite dense and kind of hard. Also, amazingly sweet. If you're not really a sweets person, I don't recommend it just because it's sweet upon sweet due to the chocolate, caramel, and vanilla sauces they drip over the churros. I almost couldn't handle it. 

Service was good too. Phrank checked up on us about twice throughout our meal and was also checked up on twice by another employee on drink refills. 

All in all. Amazing. Would definitely return to try their breakfast items next time :)",oqTZC9WriodTCby6jl0LfQ,3,0,5,cLKDAyBHAXzMabLuOcJK-w

A friend came back to town, from Reno, to prep for his wedding and had some time to kill. He asked for Mexican food, I thought this was the perfect opportunity to try this place out.

After a few days of eating poorly; I was in much need of a salad, but still wanted to try something more traditional, and got a taco as well. The trainer's salad contained huge, moist chunks of white chicken breast. The two generous scoops of guacamole, a mound of cabbage, cilantro, and beans makes for a filling meal. The green salsa dressing was not too flavorful, but the pile of limes can fix that. The carnitas taco was the size of two tacos. It was like a mini salad to accompany my entree. The hot red salsa did not deliver. The thing about Pat Phrank's is that it is not your typical Mexican joint. It is not super greasy and is not overly seasoned. My two friends got burritos and they both were unimpressed. The lack of contrasting textures and temperatures does not help. Each burrito comes with your choice of meat, then beans and rice. All of the ingredients are hot and soft, the addition of guac, sour cream, or lettuce would give it the additional omph. 

The service is the main reason this place gets four stars. The staff are stellar. The food comes out fast and they are attentive. During our meal, we had someone checking up on us for refills and if we needed anything more.

But I can see myself picking up dinner from here now that it's on my way home from work. If yelp allowed half stars I'd give 4.5.

I had carne asada and adobada tacos. They were both served in corn tortillas that held up well to the filling of meat, cabbage, onion, cilantro and scallion. The hot salsa might be hot to other people, it has a rich, smoky flavor beyond the heat.

The rice and beans grew on me, especially with a little salsa added. Both of them are fairly simple preparations.

Flavors overall are very clean. Their adobada is fried to a crisp and adds just enough savory goodness. The carne asada feels a little greasy at first bite but is melt in your mouth good by bite three.

Frank is a gracious, smiling host whose passion is apparent in the very first impression. He clearly takes pride in his work and enjoys serving his guests.

Somewhat disappointed.....I don't think it is a 4.5 star rating, but if I was in the neighborhood and was hungry for Mexican Food I would stop. Certainly not worth a trip of about 6 miles from my home.

I ordered a chicken burrito.  Thought I would compare it to the chicken burrito I had the previous day at ""Roberto's Tacos.""

It was good, but not fabulous.  I had asked if they put cheese on their chicken burritos and I was told yes, but after eating the whole thing, I hadn't seen a sign of any cheese.  They do add rice and beans, which to me then makes it a combination burrito and I wanted chicken.  The chicken was all white meat, but not enough chicken for me and to much rice and beans.  It was bland tasting without adding any salsa or hot sauce.  The portion size was good, and the salsa was good, but would have tasted better on chips rather than the burrito.

The chicken burrito I had eaten at the ""Roberto's"" the day before was all chicken, no rice and beans and very tasty.  It was seasoned with some chiles and peppers and very good to eat without adding anything to it if you didn't want to.  Roberto's was definitely better when it came to the chicken burrito.

Phat Phrank's does not have a menu board and so you have to wait until you get up to the counter to look at the one menu they had available to order off of.  It didn't give you much time to make up your mind when there were people waiting in line behind you.

The employees were all very friendly and the facility was clean.

I will probably go back and try some other items, but not at the top of my list to run right back tomorrow.",n9L6rdPBKD-4cKsR-k5-Ug,1,0,2,6GVSciEBw63xUUk3dwsHTA

Any moron can open a restraint and resell Sysco boxed crap and make a go of it, but this place is on a whole different level. Frank, his wife, daughter, grand sons, and other family members make nearly all the food items fresh. You always hear someone say that ""this is the best whatever it is they are eating"", but at Phat Phranks you really want to say it about everything you put in your mouth. They are open till 6 PM on every night but Thursday. 
Go there on a Thursday night after 6 PM and see what the car clubs bring to his special late hours event.

Be sure to try the Churro.",lt0UyR1XF8eJS8y5-eFayA,2,2,5,VWzYZ1f95NAKjD9_iyO3Bw

Came in with my lady. Ordered carne asada fries, adobada burrito, barbacoa tacos and cheesecake chimis.

Asada fries were good, nothing that sets it apart from other asada fries.

Adobada burrito was the best pork I've had at a Mexican restaurant within this price range.

Barbacoa tacos were exceptional, well flavored and fresh veggies.

Cheesecake chimis were the bomb. Ate mine in 2 bites.

This is one of the best Mexican restaurants at its price range. I will be coming here again for sure.

Owner is super nice too.",sdXss-rttsL7QNupJcawSQ,1,1,5,0Rr2KzIDavf7YgD-IlBlWw

my husbands was much worse than mine, his looked like it was precooked i dont think i need to explain how a precooked steak burrito tastes lol.

gross.

the only thing i actually appreciated about the place is that the owner was there and did offer to refill our drinks.... overall though would not go back based on the food.",7jrhS2KtnpBfewdn1mNFzw,2,1,2,2SFHAzuD4NAIDGzcvjuO4g

They serve breakfast all day so my girlfriend went with huevos rancheros divorciados.   Green sauce and red sauce make them just that.  The salsa Verde has some good latent heat. The eggs are very flavorful.  

I ordered a fish taco and the special sauce is fabulous.  The cod was fresh and tasty with a very good portion.  Plenty of tasty cabbage and a must order. 

Not to be missed are the Carne Asada fries.  THE BEST I HAVE EVER HAD.  Extremely flavorful and artfully created they are a must order. 

This place is a family joint so expect to see Phat Phrank coming over to make sure everything is perfect.  Definitely worth the trip.",jVO4SDwKWAyOsvcV_dm8Xg,0,0,4,pIYzXkajD2hoNAcQOW4R5Q

I have wanted to try this place for ages. It's always hard to get off work in time to get here before they close at 6. Finally, I made it out of work in time to stop by for some food. 

I came in and was greeted by the very friendly owner. He took my order and made some idle chit chat and then went back to cook up my grub. I tried the chicken taco and breakfast burrito with bacon and also took a small bite from my fella's carnitas torta. The chicken in the taco was incredibly moist and filled with lots of cabbage, onion and cilantro. I'm a big fan of all the fresh veggies that are included. Even better with the flavorful and spicy chile. The breakfast burrito was perfectly sized and every bite had the perfect amount of egg, bacon, potato and cheese in every bite. So great when I added the green chile or spicy red on top. The torta was great too. I would probably ask for no mayo if I was ordering for myself, but that's just a personal preference. The meat was really juicy and flavorful.  

Phrank was very friendly and chit chatted with me before during and after our transaction was over. Such a great customer service experience and the food is good and cheap to boot. What more can a girl ask for. Looking forward to making this a regular spot on my food rotation.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,6,4,5,judF8Y23LCbznJQKJoRw1g

I got the chicken burrito, and Frank recommended I get the green sauce to go with it.  It was great! 

I like that the owner works in the store, I think that shows hard work and dedication.  Not to mention he is really nice, and that was how I knew he was the owner.  

The location is in an awkward, but smart, spot.  However, do not let that veer you from this delicious place!
