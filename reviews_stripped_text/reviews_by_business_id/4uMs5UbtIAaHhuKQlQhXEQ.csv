Their chicken is the same, the fries are good and crispy, and the Texas Toast is buttery. To be honest though, Raising Cane's is better when it comes to the toast ;p
They also have their special sauces! Almost like Cane's sauce! It's crazy! They have a spicy and a non-spicy. I prefer the spicy sauce because it enhances the flavor of the chicken, fries & most especially the toast. I paid $9.72 for a 4 piece tender box. It came with 4 pieces of chicken and two sides.

A little annoying with the cashiers screaming out ""welcome Chicken Now want sample!?!""  I was in the middle of ordering and I guess some people walked by behind me and she stopped to scream this at them with a toothpick of chicken pieces.  BUT, every other restaurant in this food court was doing the same thing so I didn't hate on it too much.  The sauce is great, breading is great, French fries are seasoned and crispy, and Plantains sides is delightful.  Last good thing is the new Coca-Cola machine with the 1000+ flavor combos...always a good finisher for a restaurant in my eyes!",naZhgyS1OJFvHhGUYQh9fQ,1,0,5,_FteljmovFzj5YyVUNHpEA

The chicken tenders tastes like real chicken unlike other chicken tenders offered at other fast food places. It doesn't have the mass produced taste to it. Plus they have an awesome soda machine where you can get any flavor combo with Coke Zero, for example. I settled for a Vanille Coke Zero (I could've gotten raspberry, but that doesn't sound like it would taste good) which tasted great.",xsMd6OnEJ6_Np6Es0uxOIg,0,0,4,is7cEL51OjufI_IGRVZAVg

The fries were, to quote my boyfriend, ""like really good bar fries"", coated with an extra layer of something to give it that extra crunch! Their fries are awesome! The fry sauce has a lot more pepper than Canes and is a bit thinner, or was during our visit. I don't know if they make the sauce on site or not, so I don't know if that varies. The chicken was good, hot and fresh, but not especially noteworthy for any outstanding reason. The coleslaw was a bit meh. The fries were my favorite part, without a doubt.

Well, Chicken Now was like a rip off of Raising Canes! They even have a special sauce, that looks and tastes just like Canes. I ordered the chicken finger combo. It came with fries and a piece of texas toast on the side-- just like Canes! I was not impressed, I would much rather have Raising Canes any day over Chicken Now.

A few things make Chicken Now kind of cool (but not cool enough) is the loud hip hop music that they bump in the food court, they have kool-aid on the menu and they even have chicken and waffles! -- but still. it does not compare.

2868490,2011-09-12,0,4uMs5UbtIAaHhuKQlQhXEQ,"Everytime I go here , the place is usually packed.  At first I was a bit hesitant; thinking it was just like Cane's, but it actually can stand its own!  I've came here on numerous occasions for lunch and they are always on-point with their service.  On top of that, they have never messed up my order or change.  I know it may sound simple, but seriously fast food joints always seem to mess up my order/change some how or another.  No complaints here.. I definitely would recommend!

Pros:
 * Located conveniently inside South Premium Outlets (formerly Belz)
 * awesome soda machine with over 100 flavor combinations!
 * Excellent customer service.
 * huge portions
 * Grandma's Sauce is bomb!

Cons:
 * the wait is a bit longer than your typical fast food, but its made to order
 
Tips:
 * Try Peach flavor Sprite... Yum !
 * Don't forget Grandma's sauce.  It's a must!
 * They have specials all the time just look out for the sign on the counter.

Verdict:
  The idea is similar to Cane's, but all together has a different taste.  I can't decide which one I like better.  Chicken Now has Chicken tenders, Chicken Taco Salad, Wings, and even a Chicken/Mash potato bowl.  Everything I've tried here is really good.  I love their fries and the service is far better than your typical fast food place.  To me that's a 5 stars.  I don't really have any complaints.  It's a little pricey, but in comparison to Cane's, it's pretty much the same.",G1O-KAFicH00OW14aPfw3g,1,1,5,6EYSMbXDZKf1BlyTdnYTpQ
3279240,2016-01-02,1,4uMs5UbtIAaHhuKQlQhXEQ,"On our way back from Vegas we stopped by at the outlet to do some holiday shopping and needless to say got hungry. We found this place at the cafeteria and unfortunately didn't look at any reviews and just thought to wing it.

The wait for the food was rather long, and they missed some items from our order so I was glad to have kept my receipt since I had to show it to them to get the rest of my order. This was rather unsettling since half of our party already ate and the other half was still waiting.

Food wise, this place was mediocre at best if not worse; I didn't touch the mashed potato, it looked alien. The chicken sandwich was so so, I thought the pairing of pickles with the fried chicken tenders didn't really go. The bread was gummy and soggy.

We also got the chicken wraps which were better than the rest of the food we got. The lettuce was dipped in some sauce which made the sandwich slippery and too wet. I think it can be improved. 

I would avoid this place if possible. It's most likely going to be a negative experience and even worse, make you feel sick on the road. The prices weren't fair for the quality.",uSpr7yFI9Ios9ojeytTxfg,1,0,2,4gFs2sPweKPeghAuB3kYnQ

Cons:

3.7, let's put it at that 

Setting the math aside, why don't I give you two reasons to try chicken now. 1) The sauces 2) The sides. 

My parents took me to the outlet mall on Memorial Day to eye some good deals. For some reason, I wasn't too keen on rummaging through the much-ballyhooed sales that day and felt my legs giving in early. So I patiently waited for them at the food court. Mommy came finally came out of one of the shops and told me about how she and Papa liked Chicken Now for their plantains and chicken strips. Knowing me, I had no qualms about trying something new so we got the 4 piece chicken tenders with two sides - french fries and plantains. 

They were ready in just about 5 minutes and served with honey mustard sauce (it might've been the 'Grandma Sauce' everyone's been talking about, not entirely sure) and another spicier one (chipotle, perhaps?) They all complimented each other well and the plantains were cooked just right - no dripping oil, not bland either. Staff were friendly and cool too. Great pick and thanks to my parents.",QJMOgjRYeogK43kyfX6PKw,1,1,3,gTKjzCAy8N4Er3kP1VKPsw
4837040,2017-01-28,0,4uMs5UbtIAaHhuKQlQhXEQ,"I love this place. Been coming here forever. It's funny because people say they waited a long time.  I waited about 7 minutes, and when I got my chicken tenders, they were smoking hot with steam coming out of it. Other fast food joints are fast because they just have their food on warmers or warm it up. At chicken now they make the chicken fresh and it's perfectly cooked. 

Only downside is it is kind of pricey and you can only get the tenders in box meals and the meal doesn't even come with a drink. They should make it where you get a drink of it's that high of a price for 4 pieces of chicken. Or consider having tenders separately instead of a combo.",UzcvzQlG7jsVGIsI4H7cIg,0,0,4,1WCFuVTraUOSr3aGckoT-A
5103420,2017-08-15,0,4uMs5UbtIAaHhuKQlQhXEQ,"Holy smokes, it has been a VERY, long time since I have visited a chicken now. I remember when they first opened in Pasadena California. My husband now but boyfriend at the time made a long trip up there just to try it out. Now that I have tried raising canes, I wonder which place came first.

It is located in the food court area so it is definitely busy during meal times. The cashier chick did not seem to like her job much and did not have a smile with service. *one star docked.

I noticed the pricing has gone up since I last visited but had confidence in the quality of fried strips I would be receiving. I opted for the strip box with fries and toast. When I received it, my chicken strips did not come in a box and the toast was so bland and un-appetizing. I definitely regretted getting the toast as french fries probably would have been a safer choice.

The chicken quality was good. Breading was perfect in proportions and the dipping sauce was just as good as I last remember. Again, it reminds me a lot of raising canes but their toast tastes a lot better.

They have a coke freestyle machine for drinks and luckily the provide free water which did not taste like toilet water. See you again next time chicken now!",EtaJMHr1Df_8B9ODxhqhvQ,1,0,4,xgi5QdzV35KpNmP7KGuOaQ

For one, the chicken is juicier here. I feel Canes' chicken is too dry, secondly. They have a sauce similar to canes, but then they also have a honey mustard type sauce that's the business. The fries are also more along my taste buds. These are thick cut and canes has crinkle cut shoestring, which are passable. The last factor that gives them the advantage is that they have menu options. At canes it's either sandwich or a chicken with bread and Cole slaw. At chicken now you have corn, mashed potatoes and they have different things you can do with the chicken, from wraps, sandwiches, salads, mashed potato bowls and my personal favorite loaded fries. Their monster fries alone are worth three stars. Loaded up fries with cheese, chicken jalapeños that's slap yo mama good. If nothing else, at least try the monster fries and then you'll understand why I'm feeling the love for this place",KyMkKb5IohKb0S7v4Jv-oA,0,0,5,j39OjdrH1uxVgwG0VcrH9Q
