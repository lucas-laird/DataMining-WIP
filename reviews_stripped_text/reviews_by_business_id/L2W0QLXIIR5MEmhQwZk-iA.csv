There was another 15 minute wait before anyone came to my table. I received my food about 20 minuets later and I received the wrong order. My bill also had drinks on it that I never ordered. On top all this the food was nothing to brag about. Don't think I'll be going there on my next trip to Vegas.,2UVe-K35HwxV6lMrKdhR2g,0,0,1,TQeyv4dYEdonbmSFTd25mA

I literally got half the amount of mussels in the pound that I ordered. Based on my previous experience in any other locations and I eat and order the same thing at HNJ in LA every week. So beware.... I literally had to walk two storefronts down to Buffalo Wild Wings and order wings since I was still hungry when normally After I eat a couple pounds of mussels I am full and no I was not extremely hungry or drunk.....just saying! Avoid this location and go somewhere else on the strip.,2UbWstU94B2WO3KR7IIw_g,0,0,1,lP-i2WpFlVY6utjGdCxDhg

It was so nice to have a Hot N Juicy so close to our hotel, my boyfriend and I were in Vegas for about 10 days and went here half the time for our dinners! (And other locations) Our servers, Micha and Miranda, were so attentive to our needs and made sure everything was perfect. The food is hot, delicious, and juicy! And the manager Dan was so pleasant and answered all of our questions the best he could... My boyfriend and I even have places in mind that NEED a Hot N Juicy, and would love to be apart of the franchise. If only they were everywhere!!! Their sauces are phenomenal and can't be replicated... I've never had anything like it anywhere else... It is to DIE FOR. And even if you aren't the biggest fan of hot foods, there is always baby spice! Hands down the best seafood place in the world, and I'm from Alaska (where there's fresh seafood galore.)

986862,2017-06-20,0,L2W0QLXIIR5MEmhQwZk-iA,"I'll start my first ever yelp review with this location not due to food the food was great. The cause of this review was due to the horrible service from the front of the house. The customer service rendered was terrible and sadly I recommend our party to eat here due to the West Hollywood location in Santa Monica being my favorite place to eat.

 Our party of 6 arrived and were greeted by Jasmine the team leader/ hostess who kept up with ETAs until being seated her customer service and the great food is what saved this from becoming a 1 star review.  The wait was approximately 15 minutes.

After being seated our server arrived who never introduced herself to take our drinks orders. Within a minute another server arrived to take our drink orders again for some unsure reason and insisted on taking it again until our first server arrived and delivered drinks.

We ordered our food all 1 pound of shrimp hot and juicy with sides fries and rice. And this is where our dinner spirals into mediocrity. Everyones fries and rice arrived and all but one of our bags of shrimp arrived. We informed our server 3rd or 4th of the night who brought the food who we later found out was the manager Eve Rodriguez that we have a bag of shrimp missing and requested refills. I assumed he acknowledged our complaint with direct eye contact and a nod. When our 2nd server passed we then informed her of our bag of shrimp was missing and requested a refill. Our party began eating so all our food was not cold. Throughout the meal our waiter? waitress? Waitresses? never arrived once to check up on our table. After 30 minutes our group physically went up to our server to remind them of our missing bag of shrimp and for water if they couldnt refill drinks. Our water eventually arrived after 5 minutes. And 15 minutes a total of 45 minutes after our last bag of shrimp arrived after our group was finished eating. Once again a refill was requested heard then ignored. After our last member finished after 30 minutes. We spoke to the last apologetic employee Jasmine who aplogized for the experience but not much could be done. 

My friend then spoke to Eve Rodriguez the manager tall hispanic man with a pony tail and informed him our terrible experience. Maybe since it was Vegas or maybe they get complaints constantly he stated he will take 15% off our 3rd parties check as soon as we mentioned one of our party members received his food 45 minutes late and attempted to walk away.

My friend was upset about the unapologetic attitude and disintrested attitude by Eve and threatened to not pay. That seemed to upset Eve which is understandable and he then threatened the whole group threatening to call Security and press charges when 2 groups of our 3 groups already paid which was not ok. After that he finally listened to our complaints compes our 3rd party meal 25%. While exiting another group informed us they have been waiting 2 hours for part of their parties food. 

Its odd this occured there were consistently 3 tables open and there was a large party that took 3 tables 20 minutes after us. 

Front of the house definitely needs work.",PqQ77ElkRksA7GN-1Rljog,0,0,2,6krvVtRctc3GTGK7RQOisw

It is not because of the mediocre food, it is because of the absolutely terrible service.  Your options are a couple of different types of sauce with your seafood or crawfish cook/boiled in plastic bags, then served on your plastic covered table and peeling your selections.

Half of the mussels and clams did not open but trying to get a server to discuss it, was next to impossible.  Maybe they were understaffed on that night but two of my colleagues ordered the lobster that took almost forty minutes at a cost of $50 each.  The highlight to me was the side of rice I ordered with some Hot and Juicy sauce on the side.  I don't want to sound cheap but after dropping a fair amount of money, being charges $2.00 for a side of sauce seems insulting.",oYZAiY7eakCgszNxxRlkLA,1,1,2,zWJjUSNHGpli9AroEGC_1Q

If you are a local and have visited the other locations in Las Vegas, you'll know what I mean. If you are a visitor with a car or transportation... it may be best for you to go to either of the other locations to get the TRUE Hot N Juicy experience. 

Coming to the new location, we expected the experience to be better than, or at least similar to the other locations. 

However, the prices were a little more at this location, but that wasn't the problem. EVERYTHING they brought to the table contained next to NO sauce. We were treating my niece for her birthday and she ordered The Experience which came with a butt load of items... and it too had almost NO SAUCE! So, we had to order extra sauce for each order. Finally, my sister ordered a pound of snow crab and it come with only 5 legs. 

We spoke to the host to inquire about the increase in prices and to address the lack of sauce and the missing crab legs. His only justification was, ""Well, this is The Strip."" We were not satisfied with his explanation. So, he said he'd speak to the lead server. Unfortunately,  he came back to say his lead server said there was NOTHING they could do. So, we asked for the Manager. His response was, ""Well, the Manager is a little too busy right now."" We told him we'd wait! 

Eventually,  the manager come to the table and he agreed that there was no way that those 5 pieces amounted to 1 pound and that each bag should have contained more sauce. So, he offered to compensate by taking the extra sauces off the bill and to prepare the other half of the missing crab legs (it took FOREVER to come out though). 

In the end... we paid our $160, and we will NOT be coming back or making recommendations for this location.",6P3UZVqvDfZUF2cBPNSRqw,6,1,1,F2EZwnnThXGaET4h3jnuJA

The 3 pounds was $56 total... pretty spendy compared to the south.

2132173,2016-12-19,0,L2W0QLXIIR5MEmhQwZk-iA,"Just wow. If anyone has ever been to New Orleans and appreciates creole food, Hot N Juicy at Planet Hollywood is THE place to go if you're trying to get your Cajun seafood fix! 

The etouffe here literally tastes like it was made straight from the bayou and served at your table. So flavorful and has a nice kick of spice... and I'm not really into spicy foods. But this is just the right amount. PS - if you don't know what etouffe is, it resembles a sort of gumbo-like dish. It's amazing.

The regular fried calamari was really good and comes with a side of marinara and lemons. We were hesitant to order the Cajun calamari because it's a little on the spicier side.

I was afraid that the pound of shrimp with a mixture of all sauces (aka it's called the Hot N Juicy sauce) with baby spice was going to be too spicy for me. But baby spice was great. My heart was happy. PS - there's different sauces you can choose from like garlic butter, lemon pepper, Cajun, etc. or you might as well throw them all together and savor the flavors.",IIQjl4ckL2lWPrqV2ZGAtA,4,0,5,DtVGif3619aOOTPaBG3-pw
2155648,2017-09-09,1,L2W0QLXIIR5MEmhQwZk-iA,"By far my favorite place for a taste of savory seafood! To begin, for a party of 2 the wait was a bit longer than anticipated it took around 20-25 minutes. We arrived around 9:45 pm and at that time the place was very much alive and buzzing ( but of course... you're in VEGAS ! ) We sat on the benches along the wall waiting for our table and were given water to compensate for the wait ( how kind :) considering the heat from Vegas ). 

TO THE FOOD!! 
The two of us shared their ""Get Your Feet Wet"" a combination of 1/2 lb shrimp,1/2 lb crawfish, 2-3 red potatoes, andouille sausages, corn on the cob, and your choice of sauce/ level of heat. 

First, the SHRIMP possibly the best cajun shrimp I have ever had. It's texture was so tender and non-mushy/ powdery unlike some other places I've been to. I'm no seafood fanatic, but the shell from the shrimp could easily be peeled and I know that when it's easy to peel it means its been cooked right! 
Second, the CRAWFISH. I don't have much to say on this protein because for me there really isn't much in it already, all in all I have no complaints.
Third, the RED POTATOES. Also cooked to my liking. It's firm, round shape was still intact as well as the skin. Not too dense, able to eat in bites and perfect balance for the sauce.
Fourth, the ANDOUILLE SAUSAGES. Sliced into decent sizes so it's able to give off a smoky aroma and add flavor. 
Fifth, the CORN ON THE COB. Also one of the best cob I've had. I'm not cob person, more of the kernels, but I decided to give it a try and was shocked! As I dug my teeth into it, the sweet juice from the individual kernels and the spicy heat from the cajun sauce immediately floods into my mouth. The sauce is embedded in between each kernel so with every bite you get the full taste of sweet and savory. 
Sixth, the SAUCE/ HEAT. Trust the menu and your servers when they say it's Spicy, it reallyyy is SPICY they are NOT lying to you! I believe we chose the staple sauce Hot n Juicy, but for our spicy levels we did Medium in the bag and Hot on the side. The sauce truly compliments the entire the meal, it's not too over powering to the point that you can't taste the seafood, corn etc but it adds a nice kick & twist for your tastebuds. 

Additional Tips:
- don't wear fancy clothes, and if you do wear multiple bibs ( provided )
- not really for kids unless they just want fish and chips
- get ready for some dirty hands and possibly forearms",TpFdoEEVAevIIHgCmhX2NQ,0,0,5,KrVAkd3GUD50oEQqtmRHeg

We ordered an assortment of food both visits:

Seafood boils - shrimp, lobster, live crawfish, clams. All seasoned Hot & Juicy, Hot. Perfectly seasoned, garlic-y, and right amount of spice. Seafood was cooked perfectly, tender and sweet. Only complaint is that lobster comes  whole, and you have to work to get the meat.

Fried foods -  cajun fries, cajun calamari, corn fritters - fries and fritter were good, calamari was a bit salty, but not bad.

We ordered shrimp and crawfish. At first I was disappointed.. but when I got deep into the bag I was delighted.  The flavoring was great and spicy enough that I had to take a break in between pounds.

2598199,2017-08-12,0,L2W0QLXIIR5MEmhQwZk-iA,"Summary: Tasty food, but service for upstairs dining was not great. The etouffee was excellent, but they didn't have the fresh crawfish (only frozen). Expect a little bit of a wait if coming during the evening on a weekend. A fun meal if you don't mind getting your hands dirty.

My wife had been to the Washington DC Hot 'N Juicy earlier this year and had a blast with the food and experience. As a result, when she saw one was located just outside of our Elara abode she said we had to check it out for dinner. We went on a Saturday evening at around 8pm and the restaurant was full up with a wait. After about 10 minutes we were taken upstairs and seated.

Our server gave us a rundown of the menu and indicated that they didn't have any of the fresh crawfish available (what my wife was most excited to have). We perused and decided what we wanted, then waited for her to return to our table upstairs. Throughout the meal we had to usually wait a while to be visited, or even had to flag down other servers if they happened to be in the area since the majority of diners were downstairs. We also had to ask for gloves, silverware, etc instead of them just being offered or provided. Kind of annoying.

We ended up ordering a half pound of snow crab legs, the etouffee, and a pound of shrimp with some potatoes and corn, prepared spicy with the Hot N Juicy seasoning. The food was very good and was enough for the two of us with some leftovers of the etouffee to take back to our room. The price is certainly on the high side for most of the shellfish, but the quality was good and everything tasted good. We managed to stay clean by using the gloves and utensils (which definitely got messy), but the meal was fun and enjoyable overall.",mrPUDzaxNQDc-JXG3JmuFw,0,0,4,enkhBXL29OZbtCX7O1GAsQ

2830250,2017-07-04,2,L2W0QLXIIR5MEmhQwZk-iA,"I'm so glad they opened up this location on the strip (located around the corner of Planet Hollywood, next to Buffalo Wild Wings, and past the walkway bridge) so we don't have to uber, lyft or drive to Spring Mountain Blvd for their other two locations over there. 

This is our must go to everytime we visit Las Vegas and we come here atleast 2 times on our trip (1 when we arrive and 1 before we leave). This trip was no exception and since it was so close to our hotel (Planet Hollywood) too bad we didn't stay longer since the only place we ate in our two nights here were 2 other places and Hot N Juicy twice!

Food:

I've been to 3 of their Las Vegas locations now and they all have been consistently the same. The Hot n Juicy sauce is the best i've had out of all the crawdad places like this i've been. The sauce is garlicky, thick enough to stick to the meat and shell but not too thick that it has a goopey texture. The spice levels are on point along with the flavors without it being too oily from the butter. 

The Lousiana style was on point as well. No, it's not as thick as the Hot n Juicy but, it still doesn't skip out on the flavor of Lousiana. It's watery but, the juices gets all up inside of the meat and just bathes it in incredible authentic tasting Cajun juice that brings me back to my grandparents days when they made their seafood boil (they're from Lousiana and Georgia). 

This time around I got 1lb of crawfish and 1lb of blue crab. This time around the blue crab was really meaty and larger than last time i came at their other 2 location and they still came in a pair only instead of a male and female like my previous experience, this time it came in with 2 males (on both visits this trip). But, we ended up getting a pleasant surprise. Since they were celebrating their anniversary, if you order a lb of blue crab you get a extra blue crab for free. 

When we first came here we didn't know that and told the server that we didn't order those crabs and our waitress went back to talk to the person who took our order and came back explaining their deal. Guess what too.. both times the extra crab were female with eggs (YES!).

End food review

The staff are consistently friendly and attentive. The food is quality and the price is perfect. You just can't go wrong with any of the Hot n Juicy locations. 

Please open one up in the Bay Area. Thank you :D",XGGaFdRRQHuLjkJgg8_0Aw,4,6,5,2YeSS9hduaVbnRTY96fasw

My mother and I both ordered the King Crab Legs and half a lb of shrimp each. We also ordered the corn fritters (which were the ONLY good thing about this $100 meal) and sweet potato fries. The ""jumbo"" crab legs which you get THREE of were soggy and almost impossible to crack. I sent my shrimp back bc the texture was so off putting I was scared I'd get food poisoning. It took me asking FOUR times to get a pair of plastic gloves while all the employees stood around and laughed and joked with each other. Save your money, and if you want good seafood, head over to the Bucchanal buffet at the Caesars, where for the same price you can get unlimited hot AND cold crab legs (that they've graciously cut in half for you already) and amazing shrimp.

They were big, had lots of the yellow stuff (fat) in the head which means the crawlfish are nice and plump! I was surprised at how fresh the crawfish was! Out of the 3 pounds, I only found maybe 3 that tasted past it's prime like gutter/sewer. I got the juicy Cajun seasoning and because some of the fat got boiled out of the crawlfish, it made the seasoning extra juicy! The Cajun seasoning was a bit sweet so if you don't want the sugar then I suggest you just go with the regular old bay style seasoning. I got spice level 3 and wish I got spice level 2 because 3 had some kick to it. I choked a couple times and had to chug water when I accidentally sucked spicy juiced towards the back of my throat.

 I think I even got a discount ($12/pound instead of $16) for getting 3 pounds. I got the andouille sausage added to my boil. They were super tasty!!

I also got corn fritters but I don't recommend them...there was more batter than corn. Ranch dressing as a dip was meh.

Service was on point though. They were bringing me everything from gloves to extra lemons and iced teas refills. I'm very pleased for such quality food and service found on the Strip!! Prices were not too outrageous either.

I've been to many similar styled places and me hearing people hype up this place got me excited but it was a disappointment. A heart breaker.

The only PROS: Most standard crab and crawfish places that do the Louisiana boil style have a standard of 4 sauces. (Cajun, lemon pepper, garlic butter, and all 3 mixed) but this place had 5. Also the spice levels can range from baby spice to extra spicy. 

When you go to these type of places.. you have to get their signature sauce which for this place was hot n juicy sauce. It was OK. We got it for all our items (shrimp,crawfish, and mussels). It was a little too pastey tasting. I also didn't like the fact that the crawfish was frozen crawfish. Yeah they were alive at one point ...but there's a big difference in the taste. It definitely killed the vibe for the sauce they have. Also, I felt the medium spice was more spicy than medium. Most places I've been to I've been able to handle the spice but this was just berserk. 

When you get your order it comes in a seafood bag. Whether you eat it for here or to go. Pricing is pretty hefty, but hey it's Vegas!!",vGjn_E-9rGiqPdJhcBi9og,0,0,3,HpYBtCsvBaTOLEsxBsUmTw

Restaurant or club? The new location serves up good food but thinks it's a hip hop club on the strip. What a way to ruin the good reputation this restaurants other two locations have built up. We had shrimp, crab and catfish. Nothing to complain about with the food.  The service was good.

I asked the server if they could turn the music down and they did but it fluctuated thereafter. Not a pleasing environment to enjoy dinner. The rapping hip hop, stole the show. It's not even a pleasant R & B but straight up hip hop. Now I know why they were not close to full on a Saturday night with no wait.

The food remains good but unless you want to eat at a hip hop /restaurant club stay away from this Las Vegas strip location and hit the original. If that's your thing, by all means, be sure to visit. If you have a family avoid this location at all cost. This location may want to try an island or top 40 vibe as that music may be more appropriate and more family friendly.. Just something more soothing. I spoke with our server later and they agreed but the owners obviously think this club environment is the way to go. I noticed the servers were having a hard time hearing as much as the customers. Club or Restaurant? What does Hot N Juicy want to be? We chose the wrong location this time. It want happen again.

Dress is casual and staff is friendly. 

When ordering you pick your: 
1. specific seafood such as shrimp, mussels, crab or any combination 
2. spiciness level from mild to super hot
3. then you pick your seasoning (ranges from garlic butter, old Bays etc) 

I always order a half pound of shrimp (they are huge) and they have the head on them, 2 pieces of corn in garlic butter and Hawaiian rolls. The shrimp tastes so fresh and is very filling and satisfying! The shrimp are very easy to peel.

My lady and I came in unexpected. She's always wanted to try this place, but I've always been trying to avoid it. At least, the one on spring mountain. I just don't like leaving a food place, smelling like the food for the next week or so. 
This location, totally different. 
We ordered the feast. Crab, crawfish, shrimp, potatoes, corn, and sausages. The works. 
We got mild spice and the hot n juicy flavoring. 
It also came with Cajun calamari. 
Everything was awesome. 
Honestly, we could've eaten more. That's how good. 
We got to a good level of full. 
This meal states it's good for 4 people, but if you haven't eaten all day, I'd say 1-2 people. I probably could've eaten it by myself.

The Food
Everything was delicious and quite satisfying. A friend and I shared the ""Get Your Feet Wet"" combo and that was perfect! We also had to order the cajun fries. Cajun fries were okay. I wish they had extra Cajun spice to it. Also, I like my Cajun fries with ketchup mayo and they were accommodating with no charge; where other places have charged me for that request. 

The Service
The servers were pretty normal. Nothing too exciting. My colleagues had stated they wish the server would check in with us more often.

I came here around 3pm on a Saturday with my family hoping to get my fix of raw oysters that I miss so much after moving to the southwest but was sadly disappointed. I know it's the strip, half a dozen was $13, I wouldn't complain about that at all were they not literally all smaller than a Starburst candy. I knew I should have called Uber and gone somewhere that wasn't touristy (i.e. not the strip) but we were hungry. On top of this the service was horrible, it wasn't busy and I'd say it was even overstaffed, yet every dish for the four of us came out at extremely different times, Oysters and a Calamari app first, one po'boy for my brother 10 minutes later, chicken nuggets for my Mother another 10 minutes later, and 30 minutes later another po'boy for our friend. He got tired of waiting and asked to cancel it so we could leave since we'd nearly finished but was told it'd be out in two minutes (it wasn't).

The really annoying part was the manager coming over and explaining in a patronising way that fried food cooks differently than non-fried food, and no we didn't mishear her say they cook at different rates, nothing on our table wasn't fried aside from the earlier oysters. We pointed this out and that despite coming in long after us the table next to us was served first, it was also all fried and served at very odd times. The ""spicy"" Cajun sandwiches and calamari were bland but at least edible, the oysters were fine but *ridiculously* small, the chicken was awful however.

5023011,2017-03-28,0,L2W0QLXIIR5MEmhQwZk-iA,"I went to the Hot N Juicy Crawfish on Harmon adjacent to Planet Hollywood and the Miracle Mile Shops for lunch on a Thursday afternoon.  I love ""mudbugs"" and Hot N Juicy had long been on my Vegas and DC ""to do"" lists.  They offer a lot more besides crawfish, but I went for what I was craving, a pound of crawfish ($14.95) with Hot N Juicy seasoning.  I believe March is right in the middle of crawfish season, so I was willing to pay a little more for live crawfish vice frozen.  Not being familiar with Hot N Juicy and their definition of spiciness, I played it safe and went with the medium spice level.  I washed it down with my new favorite beer, Joseph James Citra Rye American Pale Ale, which they had on tap.    

In truth, crawfish is an acquired taste as it's extremely messy to eat and there's a lot of work for the relatively small payoff of in terms of crawfish tail meat.  It becomes an even smaller payoff if you aren't into sucking the heads.  In short order, I received a plastic bag filled with a pound of whole crawfish bathed in the Hot N Juicy sauce.  The Hot N Juicy sauce was delicious and the medium had plenty of heat (I'll admit it worked up a little sweat on my brow) without overwhelming the delicate flavors of the crawfish meat.  It was good and messy.  Thankfully, they provided a bib.  Like I said, crawfish isn't for everyone, but if you don't mind getting messy (probably not the place to go if you're wearing a suit, or white or light colored clothing), then Hot N Juicy Crawfish is a great choice to get your mudbug fix.",le3Xn9Mheb1hNxWurF7RSw,5,2,4,eg5B7pqJ8qEiy8RoLHjvcw

We just so happened to be at PH at the time I was craving shrimp! 

Let's get back to the point! The lady upfront, her name is Ashley (Team Lead) was the rudest person I've ever encountered at any Hot N Juicy! First off, I understand you are busy and I understand it is very stressful! BUT DO NOT TELL ME OUR TABLE IS READY and have my family & I sit there for another 20-30 mins after already waiting almost an hour! And DO NOT tell me our table is ready when there is no one even cleaning our table. I had to tell 3 different servers why no one was cleaning the table we eventually got seated at! I eventually asked her why no one was cleaning our table & she responded ""well can't you see we are busy? We are short staff and our kitchen is backed up. I will get to your table in 10 minutes"" WHY WHY WHY tell me our table is ready????!!!!! If you were going to throw in my face that you're short staffed. Finally got a manager and asked her to clean the table because the lady up front told us our table was ready.. 

I am not one to doubt that they were all probably stressed because of the excessive amount of people there, but that does not give you a right to one give an attitude to your customers. I understand that we were a big party, but we were there before half the people she decided to seat before us! First come first serve right?! We waited over an hour and watched multiple people get seated before us! I am not impressed. I hope one day my opinion will change about this location.

So...my standards for all things seafood and coined as Cajun or creole are through the roof high. My favorite season of the year is CRAWFISH SEASON. I live for mud bugs and all cuisine Cajun and creole. I could go on and on talking about how no food is better than what we have in Louisiana but I will spare you at this time. So, Hot N Juicy....they don't have high rating for nothing! My friends and I needed a crawfish fix and this spot was literally across the street from where we were staying. We ordered: crawfish, corn, fish platters, shrimp po boy, Cajun fries, sweet potato fries, and deep fried brownies. Almost forgot to throw in the snow crab legs. We got our seafood medium heat and seasoned in Hot N Juicy. The spice kick was just right. The seasoning stuck. It was nose running, lip burning glory! Since moving to Cali where the food has been subpar at best, Hot N Juicy was a nice change of pace for me tastebuds. I now have to see if the one in West Hollywood ranks in close comparison. The service was good. Our server kept our glasses full and made sure all was well. The prices were at market value. I cannot complain about market prices but what I can say is in Louisiana we are fortunate enough to get seafood for much less. Typically crawfish is sold at $2.99/lb live and depending  on time of season cooked ranges from $3.99-7.99/lb. I understand a business has to make a profit and it is not like crawfish are being plunked out the water in the west. Thank goodness home is only a short plane ride up the road.

The table ordered fries, fried shrimp basket and two pounds of crawfish. Unfortunately I didn't get to try any cause I was destroying my own pound of shrimp! It was so good, I understand why their name is ""Hot n Juicy"" because the food is just that! Prepared to be messy but satisfied. 

Also can't forget the service, they staff was amazing and really made sure to take care of us.",cGskg8zw1KuSkpdraZXm7Q,1,0,5,oZOCtBoP8VpqNPIrMWSaZw
5576300,2018-05-31,0,L2W0QLXIIR5MEmhQwZk-iA,Safe to say that it definitely lives up to its name! Crawfish were hot and juicy!!! We got their signature sauce spicy. It was definitely spicy in a good way not too overwhelming. Definitely recommend if you enjoy crawfish and crab legs. Only thing I would suggest is that the crab be cleaned a bit better.,K4KWTi6Z97JGmdEt44pi0Q,0,0,4,Lsohoy0a2Sioamtb_ZWs5Q

We had shrimp, lobster, mussels, crab legs and crawfish (which I personally feel are a waste of time and energy to eat) but bottom line this place is great. We actually loved the  butter and garlic sauce which is not typical butter and garlic. All the sauces have a Cajun prep to them. But it had more flavor than their hot n juicy sauce. Go and try. If you love seafood and don't mind heads on shrimp...you'll love this place.",EeM8mMsWVjWMEnJLAJpgug,0,0,5,HEnlFPdJUku7IkeBa6Mpzg

Their HnJ sauce is so special to my heart and most to my mouth!! If you like spicy flavorful garlicky kinda food HnJ is ya kinda place!!!

The calamari could have been seasoned a bit more but I added Cajun season (which was super hot) lemon and dipped them them in the marinara sauce and they were good. The shrimp was seasoned well and all the food was hot when it came out l. The catfish was good also. The only thing that I could have asked for was regular hot sauce (not tabasco) and a basket with both shrimp and catfish.,fEHSGH1VJbYlH-y8YibORA,0,0,4,rVqIq_fBnI-oXpClKMkGHw

$14/lb crawfish
$11 calamari 
$0.75/corn

They weren't so busy the night of cinco de mayo so we decided to stop by. I was craving calamari and boy did that hit the spot. They have marinara sauce (thank goodness). I got a half pound of shrimp, lemon pepper, baby spice with a corn added and a side of rice. My boyfriend got a pound of crawfish, hot n juicy, medium with two corns on the side, one plain and one in the sauce. 

Their service was great and they always checked up on us. They gave you a bib and gloves once you sit down. They had specials that night, $2 coronas and $5 margaritas which were definitely worth it! I like the location since it's on the strip and open late.  If ever you're near Planet Hollywood and looking for that shrimp or crawfish fix, hot n juicy is the way to go!

They allow outside drinks. *two thumbs up*",wxQCLMnuVYbdtmQCc2ryZg,9,4,4,Rqcecoqoi5zLWQGTYY9hfw
