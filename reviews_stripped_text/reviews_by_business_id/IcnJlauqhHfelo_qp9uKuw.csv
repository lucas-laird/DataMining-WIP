We also order a side of cream cheese wontons absolutely love it! Chicken is all white meat and they ""special order"" by putting sweet and sour sauce on the side.

979812,2015-04-12,0,IcnJlauqhHfelo_qp9uKuw,"I do not know how this restaurant has any ranking other then a 1.  First off the delivery driver/owner knocked on the door like he was a cop.  Enough so that my neighbors even came out to see who was knocking.  But on to the food.

1.  Appetizer Combo:  The contents of the entire Styrofoam was as if it had been in the restaurants refrigerator for a week and they decided to throw it in the microwave oven for 10 minutes.  The shrimp was so covered in breading that I am wondering if there was really shrimp in there.  The ribs were wrapped in plastic and was nothing but bone and cartlidge... where's the meat?  I don't know?  The cheese wontons were OK but had a crazy crazy after taste.  The fried pot stickers were OK again like just being reheated in the microwave.  The beef wontons had way way more wonton wrapper then meat and again seemed like it just came out of a microwave.

2.  Crispy Duck....  I have had a lot of duck and never a duck like this one.  I will go in order of what was on this duck.... bone, cartilage, salt, skin, and finally meat.  We had bigger pieces of bone then we actually had of the crispy duck.  What a shame for $11.  I will see if I can add pictures.

3.  Chicken Lo Mein... I do believe them when they say they don't use MSG because the Lo Mein had absolutely no flavor and the noodles seemed overly gummy.

4.  Chicken Wings:  The weirdest shapped chicken wings I have seen.  I mean I understand we are near the test flats but I don't think they needed to go get the chicken from there.  They were deformed and half over cooked and the other half undercooked with blood.  My partner took a bite and I thought he bit his lip or something.  

A UTTER AND COMPLETE WASTE OF $35.  I HAVE NEVER EVER ASKED FOR MY MONEY BACK FROM DELIVERY BUT THIS.... THIS WAS A ROBBERY!!!",33Jz09jA9L3ycpMG4mVsdw,1,0,1,K_nCWgHmk1sz-vfCHWVefg

1604061,2015-10-16,0,IcnJlauqhHfelo_qp9uKuw,"I'd say this a quaint little spot. I mainly go there for their Thai tea or taro boba which are pretty good and are the source for most of the stars on this review.  I think I've had about 4 dishes on their menu which was their dragon roll, shrimp lo mein, combo lo mein, and crispy duck. The dragon roll is pretty good, it's big and tastes like a dragon roll.  The shrimp lo mein was a little bland, though the shrimps themselves were big and flavorful.  The combo lo mein has been my favorite dish so far. Has pork, chicken, and shrimp and the lo mein was full of flavor.  Crispy duck was very underwhelming. A little salty and not that much meat.  

All in all, it's a great place to stop by for some nearby Chinese food. Not the greatest, but super convention since there aren't many other Chinese places around this area. It's been my main place to grab some Thai tea, which is probably my favorite thing to get here.",Tv19jgq034xhC0gT4HF2YQ,0,0,3,ZNsTLhfydJT8gWtnivyXjg
1685530,2018-04-18,0,IcnJlauqhHfelo_qp9uKuw,"We moved to the area 2 years ago and have been searching for a good, reasonably priced Chinese place. We finally found one!!! We tried another place right up the street and it was HORRIBLE. We were skeptical to try it at first because it's a small place, kinda hidden in an older shopping center but don't let that stop you... THE FOOD IS NOT DISAPPOINTING!! IT'S FRESH & DELICIOUS!

We ordered:

SHRIMP LO MEIN - Shrimp was plump, juicy and flavorful, not over cooked. The noodles were soft but flavorful. Delicious! Would DEFINITELY order again.

ORANGE BEEF - Not crispy but the flavor was on point and most importantly, the beef was tender! Delicious! Would DEFINITELY order again.

SHRIMP FRIED RICE - Juicy shrimp, cooked to perfection (not overcooked). Rice was flavorful... not the best fried rice I've ever had but I'd order again.

CASHEW CHICKEN - Very tasty and flavorful  but not much chicken or many cashews. Seems to have everything but chicken & cashews... loaded with vegetables (celery) but that being said, the flavor was on point!! Tasty! 

VEGETABLE EGG ROLLS - Crispy and not overcooked or soggy in the middle (like ones from a neighboring restaurant). Tasty! 

FRIED CHICKEN WINGS - Delicious!  Crispy skin with spicy jalape√±os and possibly ginger??!! Hubby and I absolutely loved it! A MUST HAVE!

STEAMED RICE - Ok... typical. Nothing to write home about.

I GAVE THEM 4 STARS... 

4**** for Customer Service (they are friendly but forgot to give me my free item.) 

And they get 4**** for Tasty Chinese Food (best in the area.) It's NOT Chinatown Quality BUT DEFINITELY the best Chinese joint on the Vegas east side!

Price is reasonable.
Delivery was s l o w (and I'm 1/2 mile away.)
Delivery driver was friendly.

We chose the General Tso's Chicken, Moo Goo Gai Pan, Sweet and Sour Chicken, Beef w/broccoli, and an Orange Chicken. We also added a 3 Thai Tea Boba's and our total came to $41, not bad! 

I can't speak for my roommates food, but considering they ate it all, I'd say they seemed to like it just fine.

As for me, I had the Moo Goo Gai Pan, and it was cooked just the way I liked it! I prefer my vegetables to be on the crunchy side and that's exactly how they were prepared. The sauce was light but still flavorful and the  chicken was tender. 

The egg rolls were also pretty great. Not greasy at all and packed with crunchy veggies! Soup and fried rice were good, nothing to rave about, but met my expectations and were satisfying. 

The Thai Tea was also to my liking. Not overly sweet, and the boba was just right (not too hard or soggy). 

We ordered delivery and they said it would be 45-50 mins. They arrived right on time and the food was nice and hot. 

Lastly, I'd like to point out that their portions were pretty generous considering it was a lunch special! Two huge helpings of rice with a good size entree. 

Cheap, tasty and filling, everything I look for in a local Chinese restaurant! Definitely a good option for the Eastsiders that don't feel like making the trip to Chinatown. I'll be calling them again for my next Chinese food craving :)",2ELKSvyQ0oqrzd747Ex9Xw,0,0,5,Zewoib2rxtC6ACbhJMhH7Q
5563875,2014-11-08,0,IcnJlauqhHfelo_qp9uKuw,Ok so let me tell you. I was a little nervous ordering from a sushi place I've never heard of and on the east side. Especially cause they are very inexpensive. But me and my fianc√© weren't wanting to leave the house so hell why not. We ordered the 40 pieces for $30. Super inexpensive and a lot of sushi can't go wrong. Let me tell you I have ordered from much more expensive places spending nearly $100 on sushi and they weren't as good as China Roll!! They were amazing!!! Portioning was great! I was amazed how good it was. We even sent a text to our friend as we were eating who is ordering as we speak!!! This place will definitely be getting our business more often. They delivery guy was super nice and they got here super fast. They quoted me an hour but was here in 30 minutes!!! A+++++++ we are super stuffed and super happy!!!,xM85JuNKDOgxsENAv3iUMA,2,0,5,gA_tFuwzmzDu7M_QlmVhYQ

5921236,2015-04-27,0,IcnJlauqhHfelo_qp9uKuw,Really not very good. Chicken was horrible. The texture was not chicken-like. The potstickers were the only things I liked. The sushi was warm. the restaurant's cleanliness was questionable. I felt like eating here was going to food poison me. Service was friendly tho. Food was sub par.,571JK5iN0QTda9A8keTWVQ,0,0,2,7YvNkO9Wq_XfQulKuo8F1A
