Under the salad bar was all kinds of food all over the floor. The parents didn't watch their kids. We played some games and came back to our table and a little boy had our left over pizza in his hands! I told his dad he could have the pizza, I wasn't going to take it.. Also a lot of the game were down without a sign on them!",WpVJ9aB7-574oaIMOX74GA,1,0,2,--6jbEW2sVFSjTZI-NLhEQ

I lost so many tokens in the little ride ons and the games. They have the worst prizes the ""prizes"" are so little Anbar not worth the 10,20 tickes they want. Ill never take him back to that place",MeaYNKcW9MhGTKBGmRtuMw,0,0,1,tjoLOTv9Yiog4c41zpRI-w
997923,2016-11-20,1,bffQssCZ-KpA_PPIu6Vysg,"Holy Cheap Company Batman! Each game is only ""1 quarter"" technically, but jeez, you're lucky if you get two tickets per game. Once in a blue moon you can get a ""jackpot"" of 25 tickets. THEN go to the prize counter, and a fake spider is 100 TICKETS? A sticker is 25?.. Unbelievable. With all the competition coming into town, you guys might want to get your act together! My kids made two trips to Johns and left with an electronic Sonic racecar game and a Razor scooter that she uses every day. Your ticket rewards aren't that great and your prizes are terrible! Other than that, the pizza was okay, it got better and it's going downhill again. Note: when someone says extra pepperoni (for a $1.99 charge) that means EXTRA PEPPERONI. I won't judge on cleanliness, it was a Saturday night, but it did affect the star rating. Better do better guys! With Johns, D&B, Gameworks, Peter Piper coming back- and more coming in, time to step it up!",bz7P6roLHXUlbYKuJSKcew,0,0,2,PtgpJBIlZgDxgD39gX26VQ

1910153,2016-06-26,0,bffQssCZ-KpA_PPIu6Vysg,"Took my girls there in the afternoon and it was not that many people there which was nice. Prolly the only good part about this place. Geez where to start. Machines are constantly taking your tokens, at least 6-7 games were broken, plus they now take 2 tokens instead of 1, they are significantly under staffed, had one person serving food, fixing games, taking oders, and checking people in. The pizza use to be decent now it's the most horrific pizza I've ever tasted. When i told them that my thin crust pizza is burnt they looked at it and told me its going to be like that cause we cook it at 500 degrees.  Really? You can't take it out 5-7 min earlier to prevent it from burning? 7-11 pizza tastes better than that and that crap taste worst then cardboard. What happened? Because they're under staffed, the people there working are busting their butts so customer service is at an absolute (0) zero. Ice machine had no ice, took them like an hr to get some in there. Next time, I will travel to another location. Don't waste your time here. Burn the extra $5 of gas and go elsewhere.",olZzLAGpSGAj2YnIkMqpgQ,0,0,1,Qf9ZpOryH5cLsJ4DxGCIvA

3127180,2017-01-03,3,bffQssCZ-KpA_PPIu6Vysg,"This location is always busy especially rush hours. Service is alright, a lot of the machines sometimes just take your money or do not give any tickets. Cleanliness is fine, is people who are dirty. Wish they had better games for the small kids and older ones.

Food: Pizza is good, not the best but I enjoy it.
Wings are mediocre, more on the smaller side.
And salad bar is pretty good. You can put what ever you want on your plate. 

Over all I think this Chuck E. Cheese would be better if it was in a different location. Or if the parents didn't act like kids themselves. Many of the parents think this is a daycare and just let their kids run around. I understand kids will be kids but parents please watch them, as some do not know how to act.",SoiacX2r2mvHqIh3GgRMUw,7,7,4,iW5FIsi1jO0F_MgOG0Or4A
3490019,2017-09-11,0,bffQssCZ-KpA_PPIu6Vysg,The only reason why I am giving this place 2 stars is because my 4 yr old daughter had fun.  Other then that it was awful.  Games are broken and the place is filthy.  Teenagers behind the ticket counter don't care you are waiting because they are playing on their phones.  Pure chaos just everywhere.

Ate a stuffed crust pep pizza it was pretty good but make sure to eat it while it's hot gets a little rubbery after 15 mins or so. Plus after spending $50 on this fun adventure I got yelled at for getting a salad at the salad bar!! Sorry didn't know you charged for stale croutons and red lettuce.

There were kids that been stealing my games which is when I'm playing something they just come out of nowhere and ruin it. The place was a mess full of pizza and salad on the tables and floors. The manager was really nice I give him that. But the place was a huge mess. Next time I come I want to see better than what happened today.,W5KlhnVjIeMJyIiyn0840g,0,0,1,u6pjADE0JaQ8bY4JbWYbaw

Cool point: their cups have peelies on the and you always win. 4 cups got us 4 free tokens, 2 cups got us 25 tickets a peice, and the rth cup gave us 50 tickets. Place was clean most machines were working. The games that you put the tokens in to try to knock more tokens down wasnt really filled with tokens. Was kinda empty. What upset me a little is that all the games (exept the kiddie/toddler games) are TWO TOKENS EACH NOW. That kind of pissed me off as high as they already are and now all the games are 2 tokens so we had to buy even more tokens.

5715394,2016-07-27,8,bffQssCZ-KpA_PPIu6Vysg,"As far as Chuck E. Cheese locations go, I'd say this one is a solid 3 stars.  It's in fairly good shape inside and it stays pretty clean on average. 

Visited on Saturday 7-23-16 for my son's birthday.  They are located on Nellis & Stewart next to the Goodwill. 

Two adult salad bars, a pizza, and about 200 tokens set us back nearly $70 but we were not messin' around...we came to win!  Be sure and check their website for some pretty valuable coupons before you go:  https://www.chuckecheese.com/deals-offers/coupons

The pizza was much better than I ever dreamed it would be.  We got a hawaiian pizza and added jalapenos from the salad bar and it was amazing.  The cheese was hot and gooey, the toppings were plentiful, and the crust was toasty and flavorful.  The salad bar was full of fresh and tasty toppings.  

My complaints are mainly about the games.  They have probably 70 games and I ran across at least 18 that were out of order.  They really should have an employee on the floor at all times checking the games, refilling tickets, etc.  

Also they made a big announcement over the intercom that Chuck E. Cheese was gonna come out and meet the kids and give them tickets and he never showed.  Maybe ol' Chuck called in sick.",VigsAph76fP7pechJ743EA,12,13,3,RaxU1cCjVcr80dSHu400cw
