They have a great outdoor patio area that has fire pits, perfect for a group of people to sit and talk. The prices are horribly high. Strip prices in the arts district? If they don't offer drinks/beer that the average downtown bar hopper can afford then I can't see this being very popular for long.",OAKWWShaL9Qe2eAE29fetA,0,0,2,v3pUw6F-hCBp7WkIs8kcuw

Everything was pretty good but only two items really stood out to me. The sweet potatoes were the perfect sweet/savory mix and their Admiral Bailey drink was delicious and refreshing. You can definitely get a drink cheaper elsewhere, but considering how much work goes into each of Jammyland's speciality drinks I think it is reasonably priced. I've been here with several groups of friends (all very different) and they all enjoyed it.",cO9mMV_MpXYOB6LF_TpOqA,1,0,4,3n-uF72hjalcQrNPiPQIKA
1897625,2018-02-26,0,Ku3ATIQunBSCP6_j6yOKFA,"I was in town for a work conference, and a friend recommended jammyland as a good alternative to bars on the Strip.  It's a rum focused cocktail lounge, but also offers wine and craft brew.  I ordered a Stranger Tings and another drink ( hardnuckle? ), both of which i recall were plays off the old fashioned.  The second used reduced stout to add sweetness and a bit of chocolate in place of sugar.  Both drinks were fantastic. The staff was super friendly. Ike, one of bartenders who came from the flatiron lounge in ny, is passionate about his craft. Danielle and jenny, two of the partners, spent time in la and nyc.  The bar is in the upcoming neighborhood of the Arts District. I recommend people staying on the Strip to get off the Strip and hit up jammyland",f-1A7pRW8hywJTwhTC-Gvg,4,2,5,NFXx38pVJRVq_HQrRtTGTA

If you want your customers to hang out or keep coming back, you gotta pour some more love, man!  I do love bartenders who are creative - more like mixologists.  Prices are too steep for downtown.  The majority of us are locals.  Should not be charging tourist prices - you'll end up scaring away the ones that pay your rent.  And being we had just bar hopped at a few right near this place - we were paying $8 at other joints.  $12 is too much.  I will say I am a fan because it was the last drink of the night so I was feeling no pain and we did love the place.  The hostess out front was super friendly.  Chill, laid back.  Welcoming. 
 But I'll only come back if prices change and drinks get stronger.  Love the decor.  Vibe.  You can hang outside on the front patio - nice size too.  And there is live music on some nights.",xVfK4hxPqr57SRleHT1U5w,1,0,4,Kg9H4KV5cUCM3bRJREKbgg

I have seen this process from the other side of the bar, and lemme tell you, you are not paying for the cost of the ingredients here, but for the love and art that goes into the finished product.  If you want a $6 Stoli vodka tonic, go somewhere else and get drunk enough to come back with some practical sense.  They'll make you a vodka tonic here, but it will be made with good vodka and good tonic.  Why not try something interesting instead, like the Genuine Article, a delightful herbal sipper of mezcal and peach oolong tea?  And the food: Chef Grayer is on point with the innovative Jamaican-inspired and -reverent menu.  The veggie ""patties"" are curried little pockets of deliciousness; the jerk wings are the real deal.

4531392,2018-03-31,1,Ku3ATIQunBSCP6_j6yOKFA,"Good vibes, great cocktails, wonderful social environment are pinpoint aspects of this establishment. Off Main Street, the large front patio is inviting with string lights above the table fire pits surround by two wall murals. This place and its menu you can tell is inspired by Jamaica and reggae that you can somewhat see in the bar's modern industrial interior with sprints of colors/patterns. They have pots with fruit growing which showed me that they use fresh ingredients.

WHAT ABOUT THE DRINKS?
Cocktails are around $12 and you can't go wrong with any of them as they each have a distinct flavor and style, and they each have a song that it's inspired by. Above the menu, you'll see a playlist for the drinks. I LOVED that idea. I ordered the Brazilian Necktie. It was very refreshing and spicy. It has Serrano and Anaheim pepper-infused cachaca, lime, cucumber, turbinado syrup, smoked sea salt and cracked pepper. The bottom of the cocktail definitely needed to be followed by water as it hit the back of my throat, but I loved it!!! Hahah.
My friends ordered Genuine Article, hmmm some other delicious one, and First Rodeo. First Rodeo is one to order if you're looking for something strong to sip on. The cocktails are carefully crafted as the bartender crossed his t's and dotted his i's, which came for the perfect drink.

They also have a short selection of beers and wine, but you should try a cocktail because that's their specialty.

DO THEY HAVE FOOD?
When I was there, Jen and Danielle (the owners which I met and are wonderful sociable ladies) said they were working on it. So hopefully within the next month they'll have some Jamaican jerk chicken or something delicious so I can pair it with my cocktail or eat to sober up for another round of cocktails! ;)

DO THEY HAVE TVs OR GAMBLING?
No, they do not. This place is great for conversations with your group or with strangers. Just a simple ""Hi. What are you drinking?"" starts off the conversation because it's connected with music.

The sound system is amazing. Love feeling that bass while sitting at the bar. It just sets the mood of the place and makes my night out delightful. They open at 6PM, but I hope in the future during the summer that they open at 5PM, but it's all good because you can enjoy a drink across the street until Jammyland opens! That's another thing I like about the location, there are a few other bars on that street to venture to and from. Hope Main Street develops in the months to come with places like Jammyland and its restaurant neighbors.",bYm6JjJ64F31gzDq2imWJA,5,2,5,AwQ9TEcEBtfFfwVAMPVnWw

4892642,2018-05-06,0,Ku3ATIQunBSCP6_j6yOKFA,"This place is a hidden gem and a very pleasant off-the-strip surprise.  I went twice during my Vegas visit and loved it both times.  The drinks are of the expertly mixed cocktail variety - delicious and perfectly balanced.  I know because my friends and I ordered every single one and we each tasted them all.  People are saying it's expensive but I don't really think it's that bad.  Drinks are $12 range and the same or even a lesser drink would cost $18 in LA, NY, Miami and even many places in LV.  These are skilled cocktails not something simple.
Drinks are amazing and the food is even better.  I've rarely had better bar food.  Everything is delicious and some of the menu is completely off the hook - ribs, shrimp w/polenta, polenta fries, cho cho salad...I could eat these ones every day.  Again, I thought the prices were completely reasonable for what's typical of small plates.
The owners care a lot about the place and it's obvious in every aspect.  They're really hospitable and always around working alongside their staff.  It's refreshing to see.  Great music too.  I'll definitely be back!",hjApCn5oMYY_AfLKRtSGbQ,0,0,5,EB53mAU5TQTufLlhDMUAcQ

We sat inside at the bar and honestly... I still don't know how I feel about my experience.

Pros:
- Interesting menus, both cocktail and food.  They make a lot of their mixers and I learned something new.  I have been using aquafaba to replace eggs in baking but I never thought to use it in vegan cocktails to mimic egg white foam.  AMAZING!!!
- The decor I liked.  The paintings and murals were fun.
- The staff was friendly and informed.
- There's a huge patio which I liked but my friend didn't.  He thought it was too big.  I loved the mural and the lights.

Cons:
- The fancy pants drinks are too fancy pants.  
a) They are spendy.  Too spendy.  
b) They take forever to be made.  We didn't place our order until the couple next to us had theirs done and then ours were made, which all in all took about 20min.  This is unacceptably long for 2 cocktails.  
- The music playing wasn't reggae.  It was rap/hip-hop with a few dancehall/reggae songs thrown in.  This is not why I walked into here.
- It's too formal.  I'm not saying make this a dive bar or a beach shack but if you're serving food that I have to eat with my hands and are giving me paper napkins, then the bartender shouldn't be wearing a tie...  It's about balance here.",byV70bKT87SHgN0uRtow6w,3,0,3,Oj-5gPnClHLPhJA_Y8G3Kw
