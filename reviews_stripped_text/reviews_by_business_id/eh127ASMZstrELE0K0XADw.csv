The meat is fresh, succulent and there's something special about that seasoning they add!

I've realized the secret to eating here: go during the week after 5pm. The mall is dead & underground parking at Macys/Neimans in the blue section make for an easy peasy in/eat/out experience.

I've made many visits, then in checking Yelp I realized I've never actually reviewed it!!!

If it's your first time, get yourself the trio (1/2 roll each of lobster, shrimp, and crab rolls) to get an idea. Over several visits I'm a fan of the crab roll. The lobster Mac and cheese isn't just tiny pieces garnished on top like some ""fast seafood"" in Vegas , it's large chunks spread through the dish. The 1/2 chilled lobster tail for $5 is a great add on if you've got a bit of an appetite.

1230058,2018-06-03,4,eh127ASMZstrELE0K0XADw,"Luke's Lobster Las Vegas is a stand alone little eatery, located a the Fashion Show mall with it's own private outdoor seating (not dog friendly) and other additional outdoor seating surrounding it (if you do want to dine with your 4 legged friend like my husband and I). 

I came by this place 2 Saturdays ago, a little before 12 pm. Only 1 employee was inside this tiny little place, behind the register. I looked over the paper menu and ended up ordering:  

The Lobster Trap, $29 prior to tax- Oh boy, what an incredibly pricey meal. This is definitely a trap, the tourist kind. This entree comes with a lobster roll, 1/2 lobster tail and a cup of the lobster corn chowder. The size of the meal is good for 1 person. For the lobster roll, large buttery pieces of lobster is served on a piece of toasted white fluffy bread (not on a roll at all). I thought it was good but I would have preferred to have the butter omitted since a side of butter is served on the side so that I can choose to add it on my own (with as much of as little as I desire). The half lobster tail was okay. I thought the lobster corn chowder was average. 
--------------------------
(Total= $31.39 after tax)

My husband was annoyed with me that I wanted to try this because of all the highly rated reviews. He scoffed at the price (but still ended up eating more than half of my meal). 

The girl behind the counter had informed me that the outdoor seating is not dog friendly but the other tables outside around this eatery allows for me to be outside dining with my little girl dog. She said that she will have an employee come out and deliver my order to me. 

Not too long of a wait, an employee came out to bring out my meal. He forgot to bring me napkins and a spoon. So he left and came back about 5 minutes later with 1 napkin and 1 plastic spoon. 

Honestly, I thought the food was average. The price is pretty high for what I got. Granted, I know that seafood is pricey, but I have had better, especially at the price. And being in Sin City, there are buffets with good lobster tails where the admission price is ~$50.

I am sorry Las Vegas, but I was expecting better. 

If you disagree with me, then so be it. At least you will have 1 less person to wait in line for to order your lobster roll.",3UIa8YVjETNwJwnOl4SEdg,6,5,3,_h5GS2AIYdQw2xp0RQ-NRQ

A little too salty for me!

My friend and I shared the Taste of Maine ($24): 1/2 lobster roll, 1/2 crab roll, 1/2 shrimp roll, 2 crab claws, drink, chips and a pickle. Mind you, portion size is very small, but not out of the ordinary for seafood rolls. I think it's a good value because you don't have to fully commit to one type of roll and have later regrets if it doesn't taste the way you expected it to.

My favorite out of the three was the shrimp roll - not too overdressed and had a sweet, shrimp flavor to it. My least favorite was the crab roll which was a tad too pungent in smell/flavor.

We also added a side of clam chowder - good! But after a few bites, it became too, too salty.

Luke's Lobster is in Vegas is great. It satiated my desire to eat at its New York location, and inevitably, saved me a meal on my next trip to New York.",GhnqHTT1vKkLc0Z1rGsQ1A,3,3,3,hOl79RxOj-IBxs-i5LGkXQ

That problem still exists for Luke's, as far as fresh seafood is concerned, but it is still a boost to what can be had in Las Vegas. Located in a kiosk outside the Forum shops on Las Vegas Blvd., It is worth a visit, especially if you live in the West and miss the fresh seafood of the East.

I ordered the sampler which came with 3 sandwich pieces (Tiny) and two crab claws a drink and chips. One of the most important things for a good lobster roll is the bread. Unfortunately it wasn't what I expected. It was tasteless not buttered or crisp. A good amount of meat but also tasteless and bland lacking freshness. In fact all three sandwiches were very bland and lacking flavor. Overall a waste of money and time. I have ate lobster rolls everywhere from Maine to Boston to san Francisco. And these were by far the worst taste and value. Not because they didn't look good but the lack of flavor and the amount of salt and pepper they put on is a way too much and seems too be trying to cover the lack of taste. Very disappointed......Plus only outdoor seating for a $30 plate of sandwich bites?

Food: highly recommend Luke's Trio $20.50: shrimp, crab and lobster. Each 1/2 sandwich is about 3-4 small bites, so savor each opportunity you get! The seafoods were fresh, juicy, and delicate. They give generous amount of seafood too! The crab was my favorite because there was so much flavor, tenderness, and each bite had a pack full of crab.

2276947,2015-11-15,5,eh127ASMZstrELE0K0XADw,"In general not very BIG on the whole lobster roll. But talk about five star winnah! It definitely redefined my perception of lobster roll. The few times had it always overcooked, bread not very good, lack of lobster in it, overkill on the mayo or lack of seasonings, and for the price not the first thing that would peak my interest on any menu. Thankfully help of Vegas Yelpers and Suzy H heard about the new Lobster Roll player in town. One that came with lot of great vibes, solid reviews, and established restaurant on the east coast. Luke Lobster based in Maine am like really there nothing more legit then Maine lobsters right??? I kind of had high expectations but in all honesty totally nailed it. 

Thankfully with Suzy H we make sure if going check out restaurant for the first time never get the same thing plus try as much of the menu as our tummy can. lol! We both got the combo that comes with choice of soup, chips, and beverage of your choice. I think its the best deal you can get. Really not sure the exact amount saved. If your going spend the money on lobster roll that not exactly cheap lunch or dinner. Why not get full meal plus the SOUP it must with any of the rolls. Perfect compliment. We ordered the clam chowder and lobster bisque. Both awesome. If there was soup nazi in Vegas. Luke Lobster hands down would go out of my way just for SOUP. Really that good for me. The clam chowder has so much depth not just creamy but hearty with clams, potatoes, and great flavor. The lobster bisque talk about nice chunks of lobster in it. Suzy first bite got nice piece and really till the very bottom find pieces in it. Tradition way more so in fancy upscale restaurants all soup or very little if any actually lobster. Again the bisque has nice depth not just creamy tomato soup but taste the lobster in it and see it. Any soup comes with crackers cause soup without crackers. The chips they have regular and salt & vinegar. The drinks that another reason get the combo. Am sure might see it in speciality stores but it was the first time had that brand that based in Maine. We tried the blueberry soda and the ginger ale. The blueberry soda was delicious. Refreshing. The ginger ale would pass on it. The blueberry soda not overpowering the blueberry flavor but still has the carbonation associate with soda. It was different but the tasty way!!!!

The star of the show the lobster roll. The bread talk about amazing!!!!!!!!!! Always preached on any review with sandwich. Sandwich really starts with the bread and not filling that will offset the bread. The bread or roll they use could eat everyday. They butter it then toast it perfect golden brown on the outside. So good. The lobster was all the things that done the right way. It had nice pieces from the claw, knuckle, and tail. Every piece was cooked to perfection. Moist, without the mayo/seasonings (no idea it is except dam tasty) amazing taste like butter, and all together perfect lobster roll. We even tried the crab roll. Another good one. It was little different because the crab is chilled so not warm like the lobster the meat. Still use the same bread. If you decide split it kind of cute cause bread just of split rolls.

The only thing that bummer. It really small place more like food stand outside of fashion show mall on the strip. Only ten seats. Really look at the positive is there better place too people watch then the Vegas strip?? Now you can do it with style and killer lobster roll. On cold nights the soups will keep you warm.

What isn't a joke however is Luke's Lobster nestled outside of the Fashion Show Mall. I really had my heart set on finding a decent lobster roll in Vegas to satisfy my Slapfish craving while away from Cali and boy did I find that here!

They have the staples: crab, lobster, and shrimp rolls and a few other seasonal items so certainly it swabs anyone's seafood poop deck. I continuously keep being hooked on the Luke's trio. It's basically three half rolls of crab, lobster, and shrimp for a modest $20 price tag however from the consistency it feels like it should be $200 (don't ever do that please) haha. What stands out is the quality and freshness. The shrimp has been one of the most tender I have tried to date and the lobster/crab are not reeking of water or salty displeasure so Luke definitely uses the force to hone his craft! I would say their secret seasoning blend is the coup de gras though as it just seems to always elevate the rolls to new heights!

A dark horse in all this ironically enough was the beverages. Ever since I first gave it a sample I have been head over heels for the blueberry lemonade.

2345221,2017-09-30,0,eh127ASMZstrELE0K0XADw,"Went here for lunch and was not fond of this place. I had a delish lobster roll during my trip to Boston and I thought I should try this place out. 

It's located at the Fashion Show Mall so parking is pretty easy and convenient. If you park at the underground garage, it's better to go to the Neiman Marcus side and take the stairway up to the strip. You'll see Luke's Lobster on your right once you take the stairs. 

This place is pretty small, have about 4 small tables and couple chairs. Since it's an outside dining style and the fact it's right on the strip with many pedestrians from the mall and tourists around, you should expect a loud dining experience. I am curious how the dining experience would be during the summer when it's 100 degrees outside. Does not sound too appealing to me. On the positive side, the place is clean and I did appreciate the fresh flower on each table. 

For lunch I tried: 
- Trio Roll $20: 1/2 portion of Lobster, Shrimp and Crab roll. Supposedly, this is one of the famous dish on their menu. I thought the lobster and crab was average. It was fresh but a bit bland. I did not care about the shrimp; maybe because they were small shrimps and I am not a fan of small shrimps.  
Note that their portion were super tiny. Their 1/2 sandwich roll was about 4 inches long. Pricey roll. 
- Lobster Bisque $11. I really enjoyed the lobster bisque. Very tasty and you can taste the fresh lobster. The cup size was small than what I expected considering the cost. 

Service was quick, attentive and efficient. We were in and out within 40 minutes and we were taking our time. Would I care to come back again? Unlikely.",XU-JR0vGW1_O5GmNwZ0bfQ,4,2,3,vHeC4CqFxqKf9uphXiJw5g

The shop is small, if you come during the summer, plan on eating inside the mall at the food court. They have seating outside, but if you are like me, that isn't an option during the heat of summer.

Directly in front of Neiman Marcus, if your not on foot and park in the garage it's about a 7-9 minute walk through the mall. 

My experience at Lukes was meh. It's a Subway style packaged meal with a free drink and a bag of chips. At least our meal was, I ordered the ""Taste of Maine"" for $27 (thier website says $24). It's 3 small rolls of shrimp, crab, lobster, 2 crab claws and a pickle (they forgot my pickle). The seafood isn't mixed with mayo or other crap which is awesome, I like it raw dogs, and they give you cocktail sauce on the side. 

The lobster was really good, it was the best of the three rolls. The crab I felt was ground up to much as there was no chunks at all. The shrimp was OK, bay shrimp. IMO for $27 the quantity was not enough, I walked out sill hungry. And aside from them dropping your food, you do all the work, it's fast food.

We were finally resolved to try it last weekend during our recent Vegas trip.  It's located in the fashion square mall area next to Treasure Island.  It's located on the first floor, near the corner of the street, by Nieman Marcus and the Sugar Factory.  It's a tiny little shack, but based on the reviews, even a line down the street wouldn't have deterred us.  

Thank goodness, all was quiet, and we immediately ordered 1 Taste of Maine for $26: 1 mini lobster roll, 1 mini crab roll, and 1 mini bay shrimp roll,  2 small Jonah crab claws, 1 pickle, 1 bag o chips or side o slaw, and 1 drink.  The idea was we'd order this to share, and then order more of whatever roll we ended up liking.  So anyway, slight complaint: they only have regular chips and salt and vinegar chips.  I guess that's all you need but....we're in Vegas.  I want more choices, damn it.  The drinks were bottled and unique and cold.  Boyfriend chose a Ginger Brew drink that was natural and had a really nice ginger zing.  I ate a crab claw and took one bite of the shrimp roll and said, forget it, I'm getting my own, and immediately went back to the counter to order my own sampler, this time with slaw and a honey blueberry lemonade (SO GOOD, but more for sipping, less for washing down shellfish). 

We both gulped down our food in their cute little patio dining area that was nicely covered by umbrellas.  I thought we'd still be hungry but we were pleasantly full.  Besides, we had a steak dinner to go to in a mere 6 hours.  The stand out for me was actually the bay shrimp roll.  But all the seafood was beautifully fresh, wonderfully seasoned and the bread was perfectly toasted and buttered.  Yummy balance of salty, sweet, briny, buttery....mmmm.... The pickle was great.  The drinks I mentioned.  The slaw was.....strange....a kind of mayo-less, vinegar, honey-mustard concoction.  I'd skip it next time.  Maybe some people like it.

Anyway, can't wait to return.  Good stuff, yo.",lvLg3Ys6yjversrHA5rB3Q,3,0,5,WTT-dhiLqec80WM3VN0_2A
2816003,2017-07-15,5,eh127ASMZstrELE0K0XADw,"Vegas is now blessed with a branch of the East Coast chain of Luke's Lobster. This chain specializes in lobster rolls sourced with fresh ingredients, although they serve other seafood rolls and soup too. They operate in a tiny standalone shop outside the strip side of the Fashion Show Mall near the Wynn walkway.

This reminds me of my trip to the East Coast. They produce an authentic lobster roll with a decent amount of fresh crustacean. The flavor and style is nearly identical to the one I had underneath the Brooklyn Bridge a year ago. Due to the heat, I passed on the chowder. The combination of half shrimp, crab, and lobster is great for beginners. It is somewhat small and a bit expensive, but you are eating north Atlantic lobster in the middle of the desert people.

The small shack has no air conditioned seating and only a small unit inside, so it does get rather hot during common Vegas heat waves. The service was fast and helpful satiating my lobster fix until I return to New England.",cBbVbcqUWrgYLP-06v0UXA,9,9,4,Sg-FcFfcVtIJ7rr7dtEV7g

3001792,2018-01-07,1,eh127ASMZstrELE0K0XADw,"""Did I just really just pay $18.40 for THIS?"" I asked my friend as I opened up the cutesy tiny take-out box my lobster roll came in. It was the length of those regular sized hot dog buns you buy at the grocery store..but to be fair, it was filled generously with 1/4 lb of wild-caught lobster. 

Now I'm no lobster roll connoisseur (this is my second time trying one - first was at Disneyland's Harbour Galley and it looked better than it tasted), but I like to think I can tell what's damn good food when I eat some. And this, this is a damn good lobster roll! You can ask them to exclude the butter, mayo, or spices from your roll and as much as I don't like overly-greasy things, I decided to try it as they would normally prepare it. And unless you're vegan or something, I would suggest you do the same. They're light handed with the lemon butter/mayo anyways - I literally saw them use a huge dropper to put it on.

Gotta hand it to New England for making the perfect buns..the inside is so pillowy and soft, with a lightly buttered toasted outside..it reminds me of Texas toast. Plus the split-top makes it way less likely to drop any pieces of the precious cargo loaded inside. The large chunks of lobster were chilled and while some people have mentioned they would prefer the lobster warm, I think it's more fresh tasting chilled. Put some sriracha on and sprinkled some more of their seasoning and it was pure perfection.

So was it worth it? Absolutely. Although it was small, it was ended up being quite satiating and in hind sight, I would much rather prefer that lobster to roll ratio with that quality than vice versa. Hell, even though I have a new-found allergy to lobster (noticed a rash all over my forehead when I got home), I'd come back for another one the next time I'm feeling spendy!",3Br2kVqplyN3jbnqwsR2kQ,3,3,4,xhprqMOXvMDFBozWHspHQA

Finally got a chance to try the infamous lobsta roll.

When I showed up on Monday, May 24th, around 3 PM, there was no one else around at all.  I actually was afraid that they could possibly be closed since many restaurants are closed between 3-5 PM. Thank goodness they were still open.

I ordered the lobster roll, of course, and gave my daughter a few small bites.  She actually enjoyed the bread more since there was more flavor in the bread.  The lobster itself was a little bland, but it worked well with the buttered bread.

Sadly, I can't give it a full 5 stars because I finished the whole darn thing in about two minutes.  Yes, it was my first meal so I was starving--I finished it quickly, but it still felt like a small portion for $17 dollars.

My other complaint is that I asked for ice, and they told me they don't have ice.  How can a place that serves food and drinks not have ice?  The lady recommended that I walked to Starbucks, which I was going to do any way...",Bbar1EB4JEviStEAqUEFOg,17,15,4,jF11ULZ_1_IK8YRkMTGu2A

Every bite was drenched in flavor!!!! I started with the crab it lit my eyes so bug with its bursting flavors! 2nd to go down was the lobster and it did not disappoint.  So clean fresh, and that butter sauce was a great addition! Lastly, the Shrimp oh! Boy!! The Shrimp! Not a bite got wasted! I was so stuffed from the sandwiches now on to the soup!! The Clam Chowder was served in a perfect portion size! The cup of soup was gone before I knew it!!! 

The staff were nice! It's kept clean.  Small seating area meant to get in and out.

The half size roll was small but there was a decent portion of crab for the small roll. Snow crab was good as I expected with that almost sweat flavor. 

The lobster roll was very good, again a healthy portion of meat in the roll. I could have eaten 10 of them it was so good. 

The price was on par with what I'd expect to pay in Vegas (or most places) for a fresh lobster roll.

1) $17 for lobster roll = you can finish it in 3-4 large bites; wasnt too filling, but the flavors were great and refreshing. I definitely would have liked a large portion size, but then they would have hiked up the price. :)
2) $9 for large clam chowder = delicious; packed with real clams and wasn't super thick as if it was all butter. thank goodness! wish the large size was bigger, haha
3) $20 for Luke's favorite = lobster roll, chips, coleslaw = husband said he would have just gotten the lobster roll next time instead of getting a bag of chips + slaw. paying extra $3 for slaw + chips wasn't worth it. Lobster roll was spot on though!

Luke's lived out to the Maine lore by providing a delicious Lobster Roll.
    The Lobster was plentiful and was sweet and fresh.  The roll was slightly sweet and the added spice gave the roll an amazing taste.  We got the combo to include Lobster bisque and one of their specialty drinks.  It came out to $75 for the three of us but to me the Lobster Roll was worth every penny.  The Lobster bisque was good but not in the same league as the Lobster Roll.  Nice and creamy but a little too light on the Lobster and just didn't have the great taste I expected.  
   Our meals came with bottled drinks from Maine.  They were all very good and added to the overall experience.  The highlight was definitely the Lobster Roll which I am still craving.  Looks like a strip visit is in my near future.  The staff was awesome and the service was perfect.  This is a small stand on the lower level of the Fashion Show Mall facing the strip.

3364572,2017-08-08,0,eh127ASMZstrELE0K0XADw,"I ordered the Lobster Roll and a piece of lobster added on for $5. When the staff said lobster tail for $5, I was expecting a whole lobster tail and not a half one. That's still okay since lobster is expensive.

Location is convenient for dining, especially after a walk around the mall. 

So, to begin, the lobster tail was cold. Not frozen but definitely cold. I'm used to warm lobster tail so this was different and I prefer warm. I like that it came with some butter for dipping. No complaints about the butter since... it's butter. haha

Now, the roll is indeed small and a bit pricy, but like other Yelpers, I agree that they stuff the roll with lobster meat. There is definitely a ton of flavor from the toasted buttery roll to the mixture of lobster meat and sauce.

The price was $17 for the roll and $5 for the half lobster tail. I also tipped since it was brought to me by the staff.

In my opinion, I wasn't really full from the meal but I enjoyed it. Overall, a 4-star joint that I would try once but not go back to. I should explain what I mean- I'm not from Vegas so I rarely come back anyways. When I do come back, I tend to try new places unless the restaurant blew me away.

I just got back from lunch and am thinking to myself, ""was this really Luke's?"" - Something has been lost in the trip from the east coast to LV, I think.  I went with my usual, the Taste of Maine (because I'm greedy) and, while the service was great, and the seafood seemed fresh, it just... Wasn't as good as back east... I felt the rolls may have benefited from slightly more seasoning, and the rolls did not seem to have the same resistance to soggyness.  Maybe a touch too much mayo? 

I couldn't really put my finger on it, but, I was mildly underwhelmed in comparison.

That's not to say I didn't enjoy my meal - On the contrary, I quite enjoyed it. Since moving from the east coast, Luke's Lobster is one of the fast casual chains that I missed. And it was still enjoyable.

It really is just a kiosk--a counter and small adjacent seating area with five small tables. But don't let that keep you away. 

My husband and I got to the register and had a little panic over what to order--taste of Maine? Noah's ark? The man taking our order walked us through the various options and was super friendly and helpful...didn't rush us at all.

We settled on the Noah's ark ($52), which features a lobster roll, crab roll, shrimp roll, two pickles, and four crab claws with cocktail sauce, all divided evenly into two baskets, plus your choice of two bags of chips (Cape Cod kettle cooked potato chips--regular or sea salt and vinegar) and two drinks (bottled water, Main Root soda, or Luke's Maine blueberry lemonade). 

The combo gives you a nice amount of food for each person. If you're starving, I guess you might want more, but I couldn't finish everything. The rolls are simple--toasted white roll, a bit of mayo, piled with shellfish, topped with drawn butter and a sprinkle of seasoning. Great bread-to-shellfish ratio, and plenty of butter, but not too much of anything to overpower the seafood. So delicious! There's Sriracha and shakers of seasoning on the tables, but you totally don't need it. 

Maine root sodas are great--made with organic, cane juice. I opted for blueberry, because, you know, Maine. No flavors or anything, just blueberry juice. The lemonade is made with wildflower honey. 

Pickle was totally meh--not crisp, but that's my biggest complaint, which is saying something!
 
I love that they have a chalkboard telling you where that day's lobster, crab, and shrimp came from. 

The service was consistently excellent, from the person who took our order to the one who came by to check on us while we were eating.

I am really hoping they make their way here to Seattle because their food is fantastic and would be a very interesting addition to our already bountiful seafood scene. They normally have really long lines at any of their locations but, since I was in Vegas during a cold stretch in January, I was able to walk right up with no waiting at all.

Their location is outside the mall in a super cool little space that has a small (heated) outdoor seating area that was just perfect for when I was there. The cold weather was not going to stop me from diving into what looked like a very promising meal. I ordered the crab roll, a cup of clam chowder, and a bottled root beer soda. All of their ingredients are sourced from very specific partnerships that they cultivate and maintain so you know you are getting the best and freshest ingredients available and you can really tell from the moment you take that first bite.

As I jumped head first into my sandwich, I was really impressed with the flavors and how everything went together perfectly. The toasty roll was held up really well and had a great balance with the pike of chilled crab meant that was stuffed into it. They serve it in a nice little holder that helps to keep everything from falling apart. The clam chowder was also really good with lots of fresh tasting ingredients and a good amount of clams which is often not the case depending on where you go.

I was able to chat with one of the ladies that worked here and found out she is originally from Washington state, I can't remember where, and she would love to see Luke's Lobster make it's way up there as well.

First off everyone that works there are super friendly and very helpful. 

I liked the location and design of the building. It's a very small place, maybe that's why I liked it. Once you park in the garage, it's really no problem getting to Luke's, I thought it was gonna be difficult, and it wasn't. 

I thought the lobster roll was excellent. but it's also the first Maine lobster roll I have ever had. But everything worked, the toasted buttered bread. They only put a little mayo on, so you can still taste the lobster. 

I think their prices are fair, it is lobster flown in from Maine, also I think they give you a nice portion of lobster. 

So I would come back next time I'm in Vegas. I like how it's not a big fancy restaurant but you still get to taste some great lobster.",_mBvtjjXYZfBMg0tmqeRBQ,0,0,5,q2hMNZiYd5cwo9BmWatTQw

Anyways, before I over think about price again. Let's get down to the food, overall everything we had was delicious especially the clam chowder soup. It was thick and had descent size clams that paired well with the potatoes and flavor of the soup. Makes me missed San Francisco Fishermen Wharf. The shrimp roll was good and so was the grilled lobster sandwich. Everything was fresh and lived up to the sustainable quality you would expect from higher grade seafood. It's something I wouldn't go out of my way to eat at but for all it's worth the staff on duty was very friendly and accommodating!

I thought the food was good (above average) with their special spice being good as well and not overpowering the flavor of the lobster. The size of the roll itself is on the small side and in order to fill yourself up, you'd have to order 2 rolls which would be pretty costly. Overall for a small snack, I would recommend this place, but advise people of the cost.

The food though is pretty good. The lobster rolls seem like a mini size and we decided to try all three different types. 

The thing is that I didn't actually enjoy was that the meat was cold. I don't know if this is the correct way of having a lobster roll but the other places that were in Vegas had the lobster inside warm with the bread.

We looked up lobster rolls on the strip that was NOT Lobster ME in the mall next to Planet Hollywood and came across Luke's Lobster outside of Fashion Show mall. We took an Lyft there and from a car, this place is easily overlooked. It is also very small. Like everyone said, it holds 6 people max and it has a small outside patio with may 6-7 tables and chairs. The two girls working were very sweet and patient while we went back and forth over what we wanted. 

Since it was our first time, we went for the trio with is 1/2 of all three rolls they offer: lobster, crab and shrimp. We also tried the lobster corn chowder and I added half of a lobster tail to my order for only $5. With a bottled root beer, our total was $66. For the portions, I would have liked it to be a tad cheaper. Since they are 1/2 the size, you can finish the whole thing in 6-8 bites. 

Everything was VERY GOOD. Although they could have been seasoned a little better, I enjoyed the lobster most, then shrimp, then the crab. One thing that stands out about their rolls is how much meat the put inside. They don't do like most places where it's a small loaf of bread with a tiny slit in the middle and the lobster pretty much on top. They REALLY packed their rolls with meat! And they used very big pieces of lobster!

I most definitely will be returning the next time I'm in Vegas!",8nOAfr6VEl4r77W15RU4AQ,1,0,5,5OkklcTzmUMoteIuQ-J_Jw

Then there it was, located in a cute little kiosk next to the Flip Flop Shop.

You walk up to the counter and after you order, you proceed to the outdoor, open-sitting area that's connected to the kiosk WITH a lovely view of the Strip.

The staff members were all very friendly and accommodating! Since it was our first time, they described the different types of rolls they offered and how each combo differentiated from one another. 

We opted for the Noah's Ark, since it was the recommended option for two people to share. It comes with two sets of lobster rolls, crab rolls, shrimp rolls, and a couple of crab claws. It's perfect for when you're on a date or if it's your first time trying out the place. We were able to sample all their menu items through this order and they were all great! My favorite was the lobster roll (as expected with the name of the store, haha). The seafood was topped with a spice that added the perfect kick PLUS the rolls were melt-in-your-mouth good with all their toasted buttery goodness. 

However, as great as the crab and shrimp rolls were, I would probably order the lobster roll for next time. Noah's Ark had great sample sizes but now that I know what I prefer, I would rather just eat a larger lobster roll.

They also have unique bottled drinks! So give those a try as well. Overall, it was pretty pricey for me but hey, paying for quality!",uS2rQ9oyAJ1nOMbL0YL2lg,6,6,4,t7aSEnLLr2nG7arwCPsuLA

The bread roll itself is just perfect: lightly buttery, soft, toasted crisp on the outside, subtle but not forgettable--lets the lobster shine. Or maybe it has no choice under such fresh, divine, delicate, super sweet meat that's pure and not drenched in a mask of outside flavor--just a clean wet butter coating. 

Luke's is really that good. Once, when I wasn't paying attention and took an unforgivable sloppy bite, a piece of chunky lobster, as if in slow motion, fell off my roll onto the table and then onto the ground. My husband dramatically yelled, also as if in slow motion. I have never seen him like that over food. He seriously picked the lobster up off the outside mall floor and then ate it. Right in his mouth. No hesitation. I can't say I would do the same, but I can say that I might if I were at home. 

Note: When they come out, they look tiny, wee wittle wolls, but fear not! It's really a lot of lobster. Appropriate and true, claws and all. I think I didn't finish a bite once. 

They have crab and shrimp, too. 

Look for it in Fashion Show Mall, past the food court and OUTSIDE. We will come during winter and sit out there even when the heat lamps aren't on yet, if that tells you something. Park at Neiman Marcus if you intend on being a regular and coming just for Luke's. No shame in that game.",EuWNFj1s2Z88DbZxptZF7A,4,2,4,iO6GyU2v_-ewvFJDJ-pjDw

There's definitely some stuff that could be worked out though...

+ We ordered one lobster roll without mayo because my grandma hates it. Open it up after we'd already left to find seating a quarter mile away at the mall food court and lo and behold... mayo. It wasn't like they were busy either. We were the only customers in there. 

+ Inside the tiny counter shop was one very unenthusiastic guy behind the counter who took our order and the other employee who was sitting in the only chair in the tiny waiting area right in front of the fan on her laptop. The guy behind the counter was emotionless and could not have been more clear in the tone of his voice that he did not want to deal with customer that day. He did give us all the information we wanted, but then he messed up the only extra instruction in our 2-sandwich order and overall gave off an incredibly unwelcoming vibe.

+ The employee sitting in the chair, who I assumed was doing something work related on her laptop, was taking up the only seat in the tiny place and plopped herself right in front of the fan. I thought that plus that she did not look up once to even pretend like she gave a f*ck there were customers there, one of which was an 80-year old woman coming in from the 120-degree day, was pretty bold. Strangers on a public bus are more customer service oriented and willing to give up their seat for a few minutes than that employee. 

+ The price wasn't bad but I was pretty shocked after we left and walked so far to go somewhere to eat with air conditioning and finally opened the boxes to see how small the portions were. We even added on extra lobster tails as a side (recommended) and for being advertised as a meal with an additional add on, it could hardly be considered a meal. 1 sandwich + a lobster tail is a snack at best. 

Knowing what I know now, I would go back and try again if I was already walking by but I'd make sure to order myself two whole lobster rolls for myself if I wanted to feel full. But I do have to give props for serving up the best little lobster roll in the middle of the desert.",UsXqCXRZwSCSw0AT7y1uBg,21,12,3,YnsxIxoyvZ3ZDBMZEi2fHA

Went here the morning after a pretty rough night, so maybe the food would have tasted ten times better if I wasn't hungover, but I thought that my lobster sandwich was good but not exceptional. Most of all I think that towards the end of my chowder, I definitely tasted something weird.. as if I were eating sand. The sandwiches are pretty pricey (~$20) and if I were to do it again I'd honestly probably wouldn't eat a sandwich on my broke budget. Don't get me wrong though, it was still tasty, just a bit overpriced and nothing out of this world. 

There's only a small area of seating with a few tables, but whoever designed the building didn't do the best job. My friends and I kept laughing about the total inefficiency of watching the server walk out of the kitchen to the strip, all the way back inside the front entrance and through the restaurant just to serve food at the patio and go back for each order. That's a total of six doors to go through and a lot of walking for every order, when they should have connected the kitchen to the patio through a door or made it more accessible for service.",mxufNEcZIYndtjPHVtCh5w,5,0,3,wr9o2iTeJeUhHp7GfuO72w

It's cute and reminds me of all the lobster shack stands I've been to in Maine. They use the split top roll which is key to keeping it authentic. There were nice chunks of lobster meat in this little roll. I really enjoyed the temperature contrast of the cold lobster meat atop the warmed, buttered roll. The seasoning that was sprinkled on top enhanced the flavor of the lobster nicely. The reason I only gave it 3 stars is the size. It was so small! 3-4 bites and you are done! For $17, I wanted to savor my entire experience but it was over so quickly. I was seriously tempted to drop another $17 on another one. Luke's has a pretty darn good LR, I just wish it was a little bit bigger.

Sorry, but that was my first impression when I was standing in front of it about to drop a $20 bill on a 5/6 ounce lobster sandwich. I decided oh what the heck, manned up and ordered my lobster roll. While waiting I found a small little round table in a cubby in the back of the kiosk and waited patiently which didn't take long for my smaller than anticipated lunch. First bite I thought wow this is pretty good. Second bite it was almost like I could taste the freshness and was happy with the overall texture and melody of flavors that were in the sauce. Third bite I was really wishing there was more to this roll than what appeared to be one final bite remaining. Another couple bites and I think it would've been a great value however I am still satisfied but probably won't go back just because to me it was one of those ""been there done that"" type of establishments so to speak.

When we got the lobster it didn't have much flavor and the butter dipping sauce was just melted butter with nothing special to it. I was expecting more flavor. What cancelled out any hope of flavor was it being cold and sitting in a damp shell. I'm sure it has a different taste during what seasons, but to us it was bland.

4777956,2017-03-22,2,eh127ASMZstrELE0K0XADw,"My boyfriend was craving a lobster roll for the past few months (literally), but we couldn't find anywhere back home to get a good one. Flash forward to our trip to Vegas this March. I typed in ""lobster roll"" onto Yelp and this was the first place that popped up. Prior to checking this place out, I wasn't really a seafood/lobster fan...but after reading the wonderful reviews on about this place, I knew I had to at least give it a try.

Although unassuming, Luke's Lobster truly delivers an excellent, high-quality lobster roll. The simplicity of the dish - a quarter pound of fresh Maine lobster with just a hint of lemon butter on top of perfectly toasted sourdough bun - really allowed the freshness of the lobster to shine through. Like I mentioned before, I'm not the hugest seafood fan. However, this lobster roll has legitimately changed my opinion of seafood for good. Every bite of lobster had so much flavor in it...so juicy, tender, and very, very fresh. After this experience, I can't go back now. I think I might be a seafood (or at least lobster) fan for life! 

$17 for a small roll might seem a bit expensive, even for Vegas. But trust me: Even though the roll looks small, the quarter pound of lobster meat on this baby really fills you up. My boyfriend and I were both starving and thought a lobster roll each would tie us over just for a little bit, but we were full for quite some time after finishing.

The hunt was well worthwhile, as our lobster rolls were delicious. They had lots of sweet lobster meat, and the side of coleslaw was tasty as well, and a better side than a bag of potato chips. The lobster bisque, while not as good as others I've had, had more lobster meat than any I've ever had. The service was friendly!

Not to say that there's no seafood here but the folks hanging in casinos need tons of energy that comes from cows...I digress. 

So our Lyft driver drops us off in the driveway at the end of a shopping center and I got a glimpse of Luke's as we passed it since it's illegal to drop people off in the street.

I located Luke's Lobster shack after a brief scavenger hunt at the Fashion Show Mall (located at the outdoor shops near Sugar Factory). 

The Yelp reviews are awesome but I needed a little more justification for this pricey little snack. 

I purchased the Lobster roll for $17 and it satisfied my appetite all 320 calories for a few hours but it's definitely a snack unless you order a soup. 

Over ten locations including Japan and fresh traceable seafood (back to the lobsterman) was a win for me. The price is justifiable and I'd definitely return in the near future this time for the trio.

On the first day of vacation in Sin City, I mentioned to my other half, lets go to Luke's Lobster, but he wanted Asian food,  
Next day, I mentioned, lets go to Luke's Lobster, no luck again and again, up until the last day of my Vegas vacation, I asked again, and then my wish came true. I was super Excited and Happy!! 

The last time I had lobster roll and clam chowder this awesome, was in Seattle's Pike Place.  

Luke's Lobster is located in front of the Fashion Show Mall. Don't look for a restaurant type of place like I did. Its a cute food stand right in front of the Mall. If you are headed straight to Luke's Lobster like me, it is going to be a walk from the parking lot. I think the closest to Lukes is parking near Macy's. After looking at directory, it still took us awhile to get to Luke's Lobster, can you tell I really want to have my Lobster roll badly?!

When I finally made it to Luke's Lobster, I was SO Happy, I've been waiting since January/2017!! This is such a cute place, there is a cute dining area in the back of the shop with 5 tables. Enjoy your food there and you can listen to the outside music from the Fashion Show Mall. It took me awhile to finally decide, the staff was very friendly and really gave me great suggestions and answered all of my questions. The menu is short and simple. One of the great suggestion by staff was to get the trio.  

The only thing I regret during my visit was not having a feast, since we already had a big lunch  and about to have buffet dinner, this visit was just late afternoon snack. We ordered the clam chowder and lobster roll & paid 5.oo more to make it a combo with drinks and chips. Oh my goodness!! What we just had went so great together and WOW, the lobster roll  was so delicious, (lobster so fresh & juicy from Maine, seasoned just right, the rolls are filled with tons of lobster). This was the best Lobster Roll I ever had. I could taste the difference from all the lobster rolls that I've eaten, nothing comes close to Luke's. The clam chowder was very tasty also. The drinks got were organic lemon lime from Maine, which was so perfect. 

After our meals, I was one happy wife, thanks so much to my other half for taking me. 

Over-all, it was worth waiting for, worth every penny spent at Luke's, and I wish I visited more than once during my vacation. My other half enjoyed his meal too!! Now even after typing this review I am missing Luke's Lobster badly. - for now, I'll just have to live by the wonderful memories thru my photo until I visit Sin City again. 

I totally recommend Luke's Lobster!!

Park in the red parking and go up the stairs to the outside restaurant area like you were going to Maggianos or RA Sushi. If you stay at street level and walk a little farther South, Luke's is a stand alone shack like place. You order at the counter and there is seating underneath the bistro string lights. Everything is completely outdoors, so be prepared for the weather! 

What I love most is how fresh the seafood is, which is amazing considering we are hundreds of miles from an ocean. Also, seafood is the main focus, without being overwhelmed by sauce. The buttery, soft bread compliments the seafood well. I got the sampler, which are half sized portions of lobster roll, crab roll, and shrimp roll. My favorite was the lobster roll and I would get a full roll of this next time. 

It's pretty pricey, but to be expected on the strip. Kind of nice to sit and watch the pretty lights of the Wynn and Palazzo and random passersby.

So I've had Luke's in NY before and was excited to try this place out again with my LA friends who's never been to Luke's before.  I remember Luke's lobster rolls and chowders were really really ecstatically good and so I must have it again.  It didn't disappoint but it wasn't as good as I remembered.  Lobster rolls are a big thing in LA now and almost 9 out of 10 seafood restaurants serve lobsters rolls in LA so maybe that's why. Can't say I have had better and I'd return if I was in the mall but my friends felt that the warm lobster rolls from LobsterME in PH that servers Warm butter+ warm lobster+ crunchy soft rolls are better.  So I guess it's personal preference on how you like your rolls!

One thing tho, although it's patio seating, the staffs are unsure about us bringing the dog with us and the owner was really nice and let us do that for this time.. But isn't patio seating supposed be pet friendly? Anyways, friendly new staffs and owner!",-rBffbCNbqp83eyD_IKrgQ,2,3,4,-g_XvmU-6fHRjVlWekj-1Q

5094854,2016-11-24,21,eh127ASMZstrELE0K0XADw,"Incredible lobster rolls in the middle of the desert!

Sustainable seafood direct from Maine in 72 hours.  It's served up by this small Main based chain the simple, authentic way.  Part of Fashion Show Mall (look for the small, circular ""shack"" fronting LV BLVD).

I know, I know.  Vegas locals feel free to slap me.  But, you'd be missing out if you shun it just because of its location.

Rolls are simple.  Fresh, soft, somewhat dry (a good thing), mayo, butter, well cooked, juicy seafood, and a hit of spices similar to Old Bay.  That's it.  Lobster, lump crab, or shrimp.  Not very large, 7"" rolls.  All overstuffed.  If I had to guess, about 1/4lb of seafood in each.  Balanced, not over the top.

The lobster itself, plump, juicy, sweet, tender that only a cold water Maine lobster delivers.  Each roll has a softer claw and generous portions of tail meat.  If you're lucky, a knuckle.  

Wonderfully creamy lobster bisque (a shot of bourbon would make this incredible), excellent New England chowder.  Lots of tender clams and clam flavor.

Finally, don't pass on the seasonal lobster grilled cheese.  OK, so a $13 grilled cheese sounds ridiculous but, buttery toasted white bread, chunks of lobster enrobed in melting, pull apart, gooey Gruyere.  The crab grilled cheese not far behind.  Think of your favorite crab dip turned personal sandwich.  Seriously good on a cool fall day.

Note:  The shack has only a few tables so you may have to take it to go.  Plenty of stairs and walls around.

Prices in line (about $0.50 more than their Maine location).

Well worth venturing outside if shopping the holiday season.",oeAhRa8yFa9jtrhaHnOyxQ,34,28,4,i6_k1D7m1Z0EAq2mjzOmVw

5118357,2017-01-18,35,eh127ASMZstrELE0K0XADw,"Where to find the best lobster roll ever? None other than the Las Vegas Strip. Yes, you read that correctly. Luke's Lobster, where have you been all my life?! Luke's started as a vision of a Maine native and lobster-man, Luke Holden. For those of you not on the East Coast, you're in for a treat because Las Vegas is the only West Coast location. If you are in the area, do not miss this little kiosk. Luke's Lobster is located near the Fashion Show Mall right by Neiman Marcus. It's very easy to miss as it is a small kiosk in between a bunch of other stores and attractions. We took an Uber ride here to avoid any parking issues and there was not much of a line at the kiosk. The guy working the register was super friendly and interactive. He knew about the product and menu and was able to explain how it all goes down. The lobster is top quality and sourced from trusted fisherman. I was ready to try this little hole in the wall and judge it myself. I ordered the one and only thing I came for, the lobster roll.

The lobster roll was delivered to our little patio table in a basket that made my eyes light up. A quarter pound of chilled wild caught lobster in a toasty split top bun with melted lemon butter, mayo, and the secret seasoning. One word, phenomenal. The warm crisp bun topped with a generous portion of buttery creamy lobster blew my taste buds, and mind, away. Talk about a few moments of bliss. That's how long it took me to wolf down this roll, just a few minutes. There is more good news. This amazing, fulfilling, delicious roll that I speak of is only 320 calories. How do they pack so much flavor in 320 calories is beyond me but I would eat it every day if I could. Priced at 17 dollars a sandwich, it is not a cheap meal but you definitely get what you pay for. Add another 5 bucks for a side (either poppy seed slaw or cape cod chips) and a beverage. 

I could've probably eaten two more of these suckers but my wallet wouldn't have been happy. I decided to savor the yummy goodness and come back again another time. It was really a great experience overall. Many people prefer lobster rolls cold. Here, you get the satisfaction of the warm bun while the fresh, chilled sweet lobster sits on top. The service was fantastic from beginning to end. The guy took our order, brought it to our table, and asked how it was when we left. He was enthusiastic about the product which made me feel good about what I was eating. Luke's Lobster needs to make its way on to Los Angeles because it topped my list of lobster rolls. Simple, sweet and delicious. I can't wait to come back.",R7C_PGUiBgJbIgXNkk1I1Q,46,48,5,9618X9nFMdtvvJaH6KeSew

While this place sells just that, I was less than impressed.  It's super pricey for what you get.  Granted we are in Vegas and not Maine or Nova Scotia but common people...

Sitting just out in front of Neiman Markus, outside just steps from the fabulous Las Vegas Strip.  I'd suggest parking in the ""Red Section"" underground.  There are escalators to take you inside the Fashion Show Mall then just head towards the Strip outside the actual mall.  I'm a little weary of what will happen once the summer hits.  It's gonna be way to freaking hot to sit outside and enjoy your meal.

Luke's is a pretty cool concept.  It's basically a fast food seafood spot.  Quick service at its best.  They basically offer 3 sandwiches on a buttery toasted roll.  You have the option of lobster (duh!!), crab or shrimp.  They do have a pricey special that allows you to sample a half of all 3 along with a few crab claws....all that AND a bag of chips.  That's what my husband, Cesar Q. decided on.  He stood in sticker shock when the guy told him our bill was $54 for a meager lunch.  Oops...sorry babe, it was my idea to stop by today.  Anywhoooo I had the soup and sandwich combo that came with a drink and you guessed it, a bag of chips!!  Pretty cool they allow for a bottled water at no additional cost.  I chose the shrimp roll and the lobster bisque.  Both were just so/so.  I did like that these sandwiches were not ""salad style"" so there was a simple smear of mayo on the roll as opposed to all the seafood being drenched in dressing.  The sammy was fresh but nothing to write home about, sorry Mom!

The service was stellar and on point.  The guy helping was genuine and made me feel like he loves his job!  In today's entitled society it's nice to see people still care about service.

There is a very small outdoor dining area attached to this little spot.  There are maybe 5-6 tables and a log cement bench area.  I did not think it was cool that they had a place to tip.  Holy hell...I just paid you $54 for a sandwich lunch, fast food to boot!

Here goes... Luke's Lobster is located outside of Fashion Show mall in a little shack.  It's is located near Neiman Marcus so I recommend parking there for easier access.  It is outside so you will be exposed to the elements... But they do have a couple heat lamps. But let's be real... The heat lamps aren't going to save you from the cold chill. 
We ordered the lobster roll and clam chowder meal which comes with chips and a drink... And it was delicious! The lobster is shipped overnight from Maine and was fresh as can be.  It is served chilled; topped with butter and a little mayo on a warm roll. It is a bit small but they certainly didn't skimp on the lobster filling. The clam chowder came out hot and had plenty of clams in it (not like other clam chowders I've had where I questioned if they even put clams in it).  

Now for the price....It is expensive.  For the our 2 meals it cost $56 bucks. Seafood is generally more expensive anyways; but it was so good I'm likely to pay that price again. It's just not something you can afford to eat often. 

The owner and staff were super helpful and patient; constantly checking to see how we were doing. Big ups for that!

We initially encountered Luke's Lobster during a visit to New York City and was ecstastic to give it a try upon returning home. It's a small stand alone kiosk-like restaurant on the exterior of the Fashion Show Mall. There are two bar stools inside and about four to six mini tables in the small, private connected patio. 

Upon walking in, we were immediately greeted by two friendly servers. They were knowledge about the menu item and appeared happy to help! The food was fast to come out (less than five minutes) and the system seemed efficient. 

The food wasn't bad but it wasn't as good as I expected it to be either. We ordered the lobster grilled cheese an Luke's favorite (lobster roll with cole slaw and potato chips). The grilled cheese was fresh and contained lobster but it was small and mainly crust. On the other hand, the lobster roll was stacked with lobster but nothing about the flavor made a lasting impression. Unfortunately the lobster mac & cheese is a seasonal item and was not available. 

For being on the strip, the price is fair ($13 for the grilled cheese and about $20 for Luke's favorite). It's cheaper than seafood anywhere else but it's more like a snack.

The lobster roll was ok, it satisfied my craving but I have had better in Maryland. Maybe because they only had the lobster roll prepared one way. The clam chowder was decent, not as creamy as I'd like but my daughter enjoyed it.

5816670,2017-07-01,0,eh127ASMZstrELE0K0XADw,"This place is AWESOME. Luke's Lobster is known for their (you guessed it) Lobster Rolls. And let me tell you, at $17 a roll, it is worth every penny. 

The location is freestanding and faces the Strip, with a handful of outdoor tables in the back, if you're brave enough to withstand the Vegas heat. Otherwise, I recommend taking your roll inside for some 21st Century A/C! 

Although the Lobster Roll is fantastic (and I'll get to that delight in a second,) I was a little bummed that their kettle chips weren't made in house as well. They're just your average, run-of-the-mill, store bought variety, which made me feel like I was ordering a filet mignon served with a side of frozen veggies. However, their sodas are all unique and delicious (Blueberry Lemonade, for example) and their coleslaw (which I don't usually enjoy,) is made with a tangy vinaigrette instead of mayonnaise and is quite tasty! 

Now, onto the Lobster Roll! It is their #1 Seller and signature menu item. At about 5 inches long, it seems rather puny upon first glance, but once you've eaten it, you realize any more would be far too rich. Plus, the roll itself is PACKED with incredible chunks of lobster meat and seasoned with salty, garlic-y blend of  spices that I can only image possess magical properties. Then there's the bread. THE BREAD. It is perfectly coated in butter and pressed for a slight crisp and a little warmth...perfection! 

Yes, the price is a bit steep, but you also have to remember Luke's motto of ""Traceable, Sustainable Seafood."" You get what you pay for! 

I also want to mention that the woman who helped me and my friend was quite knowledgeable about the history of the restaurant and its (many) global locations!

Five stars for the taste, but I wish it would be a bit cheaper (or larger).",jFrK6zUa2CgmGWTbTWFWsQ,0,0,5,x9HJXG6wes8RvvROhu8VrA

However, my boyfriend and I had trouble finding a place to sit in the area since we were not allowed to even sit outside due to me having our puppy, although she was fully kept in a travel carrier. It had just rained that evening, and we were asked to sit on the seats away from the restaurant seating area. We sat down on those seats, only to get our bottoms soaked. 

We ended up just standing to eat in front of the beautiful fountains across the street.

Would love to have given this place more stars, if the service was more accommodating and considerate of the outside conditions.",BMAm6vg5irDjDSRWKZqmlA,2,0,2,p7EZTDc_JPktEGoM2mSKJQ
5880161,2016-08-03,4,eh127ASMZstrELE0K0XADw,Chilled lobster on a warm toasted buttery fresh bun dusted lightly with their herbed seasoning and a touch of mayo. Friendly quick service. I so wanted to try their clam chowder but it so hot out here!! But this is a great cool sandwich on a hot day.,4bQqil4770ey8GfhBgEGuw,6,6,5,6wC2x2gIXUjtbj6gqcQo9Q
5908047,2017-02-06,1,eh127ASMZstrELE0K0XADw,"Stumbled upon this tiny gem as we're waiting for our uber back to the hotel...the location isn't very convenient so I'm not surprised that there aren't too many customers, which is good, because I don't have to wait long for some BOMB lobster rolls! This place serves lobster, crab, and shrimp roll. I only got the lobster one cause after trying so many rolls I realized that lobster is 100% my favorite. However, if I do get the chance to come back I'm definitely trying the other ones. I give this place 5 fat stars because Luke's Lobster does its bread so right--it's PERFECTLY toasted with just a little bit of crisp. With every bite you taste the butter soaked into the bread and the hot lobster...mmm..SO GEWD. It's an option to get your roll with soup--I highly recommend the New England clam chowder.",A06QtUzeJSiDW6MSWp3Jdg,3,2,5,MKDID4j3YH6P7JfoBVyaag

I ordered the lobster roll and it was delicious.  I don't even like lobster but this lobster was amazing.  If your on the strip make sure you check this place out .

For lobster in Nevada, it was surprisingly crispy and fresh tasting. That said, there was a lack of that salty lobster taste that makes those East Coast joints so spectacular. All in all, this was a great lobster place. I had the Taste of Maine which was lobster, shrimp, and crab. The crab was my favorite and I would highly recommend this place!",dsuf6FHPK5s_elDFsxdYuA,0,0,4,wT2pdZRBAALBFO0sguMvEg

5955679,2017-11-11,0,eh127ASMZstrELE0K0XADw,"This is probably a three and a half star place. Everything was overly salted. My husband doesn't agree though so it's all relative. I got the trio. Rating it from lowest to highest would be shrimp, lobster then crab. They put the same seasoning on all three so the seafood really speaks for itself. The lobster bisque flavor was good but the soup base was clumpy from the flour. They could improve the execution of this particular recipe.",43unbqCPH45X-60Gn0W0YA,0,0,4,tEbQjm9_9dbsKDDtwKxkBg

Don't come expecting a feast for the price, but expect good chunky pieces of delicious lobster, chilled on top of a crispy buttery sandwich.  I definitely was full with the lobster roll and chips and drink combo but not stuffed. 

I didn't get to try LOBSTERME but I heard that place is Connecticut style with extra mayo and salad inside. This maine style is mostly lobster and no nonsense, elegant and delicious. Worth",sB2wtw6CryKwSA-0yPqQyA,4,3,5,PcNkVHuBqE_rKpMWXILaKg

5996405,2017-05-16,0,eh127ASMZstrELE0K0XADw,Saw this on unloktlv on Instagram so one night came to try it. It's outside in a little area in the front of fashion show along Las Vegas Blvd. My husband and I tried the taste of Maine since it came with the 3 different 1/2 rolls. We also got clam chowder and lobster bisque to try. Everything from there service to the food was great. I can't eat too much lobster or I'll get itchy in my face so the 1/2 roll was perfect for me. I enjoyed the shrimp one personally and my husband enjoyed the lobster. I like the claim chowder and how the staff was super nice and explained how the process of them making the food went.,P0rGN5mDue55uIiAzkrRlw,2,0,4,_ZfikvfmjhNjT8_DLUEARA
