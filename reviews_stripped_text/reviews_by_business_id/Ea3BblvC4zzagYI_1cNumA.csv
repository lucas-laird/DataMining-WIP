the staff is quick and friendly. the cashier saw that everyone was doing well and was given the personal treatment he or she deserved. How else do i describe such a wonderful atmosphere.

165401,2010-11-14,0,Ea3BblvC4zzagYI_1cNumA,"Cappriotti's is my go to place when in doubt. They have so many choices, even with their simple set up. It's a lot more unique than other sub places, just because of their meat. You can sense the difference after one bite. I feel like it's just better quality, it's either that or the ""shreddedness"" of it making it easier to munch on. Either way I can't go wrong when I come here.

My personal favorites are their turkey, steak and cheese (I love it with onions and peppers, real spicy!), the Bobbie (when I really want to let it all go lol) and their sandwiches instead of their subs.

Be careful when you order, a small is quite enough to feed one person. Medium can feed two. And a large can feed a small family!

This particular store is good, I really feel the family vibe and the workers are really laid back. I always give them a tip since it goes to their ""beer money"", and I respect the honesty.

Keep in mid though, their subs are a little bit more pricey than other places but I classify then as ""quality over quantity"".

Overall, whether your driving by or planning on going out of your way.. Cappriotti's is a good place to choose for a sub other than the 'robotic' subway or quizno's.",XyDLSwfbkySPxLFoszyvpA,2,1,5,vfrD6mnKS5sQX1BnegIB6A

So, I started thinking maybe this is just Vegas' version of Subway. Oh, but never in this life time will it ever be compared to Subway. My friends took me here after church. Apparently you have to eat after church, cus it just completes the service.

All I kept hearing was, ""Try the Bobbie"", ""Try the Capastrami."" I am more of a hot sandwich person so, I went with the Capastrami. It was the greatest decision I've made at a sanwich shop. Kinda makes me wish I made great decisions like this throughout my life. 

So, anyway about the sandwich.. It was this prefect hot, juicy pastrami that laid on a cold bed of some kind of coleslaw. With this peppery Russian sauce to top it off. I always get extra russian sauce on the side. This sandwich always satisfies my hunger everytime.

I tried the Bobby another time. It is a cold sandwich, but it's unique. It's basically a thanksgiving lunch. It has the turkey, bread stuffing, cranberries and cranberry sauce.. It's just as good as the capastrami.

I also tried this sandwich called eggplant Parmesan. It's absolutely filling for a no meat sandwich. So much flavor. Now I ave yet to try the rest.

Service is quick and friendly, sandwich is made where you can see it. They seem to thrive in the location due to the nearby college. Add in that their sandwiches are well-priced: the small clocks in at just under $7.50.

Criticisms: 
This location closes at 8PM, which makes sense if their only business is the college crowd but living nearby, I can't go nearly as often as I would if they were open a bit later.

Most men know they can never be Rex...and all women know they will never be with anyone as good as Rex. It is a burden. It is a curse. Rex bears the mantle for what all men should be. Tough. Strong. Virile. Always has a rag, some gas and three pills found in Gary Busey's house.  Still, there is another side. A sensitive side. A side that has a heart.  Rex weeps when he sees pictures of fat girls who was one thin. Rex sobs uncontrollably when he sees a puppy...eating out of a dumpster...and there is none for Rex.  Rex wails and throws himself to the ground at the mere thought of Jessica Alba's sweet babies...how they have ruined her once beautiful vagina.  He is human. Rex IS human...no matter what the Slovakian courts may say.

Today...this day...January 45, 2193...Rex weeps again.  Sadness has washed over Rex...much like the time he found out that his girlfriend wasn't just smelly...she had died 38 days earlier. Damn you paint thinner and Pine Sol...why do you have to be so much fun with such an evil side.  Granted Rex is not as upset as when Judy... Jenny...Jana...whatever her name was expired...this time Rex doesn't have to throw out his couch. Still Rex is upset.  Why do you ask?  DON'T EVER ASK ME A QUESTION AGAIN YOU PATHETIC FREAK!!!  Rex will tell you at his own time...okay...Rex is upset because another love of his...is dead.  Capriotti's Sandwich Shop is dead to me.  Rex has actually eaten Capriotti's years ago back east. Rex decided to leave where he was staying...by hiding under a laundry truck and going through two gates, swam through a river, wrestled a rat the size of a large dog and survived in Wilmington...which was the hardest part.  During his brief, but highly publicized change of address he ate at a Capriottti's. It was excellent. Perfect sub. Inventive. Quality ingredients. Care. Pride. It was a taste sensation. A revelation.
 
That was a long time. A long, long time ago. Now...now Capriotti's is basically Subway but a few notches better...but not nearly as good as it should be. Especially considering the price differential between the two. Such a shame. Total shame.  It would be easy to change their ways, but the chain is now owned by a corporation so the traditional corporation changes are taking place.  Less meat. Lower quality ingredients. Substantially less overall care and dedication to the craft which is sandwich making.
 
Rex went and bought 2 subs for the first time in about 9 months.  Rex bought the Cole Turkey and the Bobbie.  The Cole Turkey Rex hadn't bought in 3 or 4 years.  The turkey was dry. There wasn't enough of it. There wasn't enough sauce. It was a total mess. Lots of cole slaw because it is cheap.  The Bobbie...my beloved Bobbie has been absolutely destroyed. Heavy on the stuffing light on the turkey, too much mayo and not enough cranberry sauce.  Rex is a good man...a great man...a fair man...a well hung man...and he tried the best sub. The Capastrami. That is when things went wrong. Rex stood up and attempted to defecate out the horrible food. Rex screamed...""I AM GOING TO CRAP THIS CRAP OUT OF MY CRAPPER!""  Everyone else screamed...melee ensued...Rex was escorted out...for those who are interested...mission accomplished.

This location is no better or worse than all of the location. It isn't an individual store issue it is a systemic issue because of the change in ownership.  Rex wants to love Capriotti's. It is what the world needs...a great chain that makes incredible subs/sandwiches with care and quality. There just isn't one out there.  Firehouse comes close (review to come later) but there isn't a perfect one.
  
Now the expended menu with salads, etc will only water down the brand and quality further. They could have spent more money to buy meat in bulk at a lower cost so they could more on their sandwiches, like they used to have. No. They use their purchasing power to buy lettuce. Really? That is corporate thinking...bad thinking.

Note to Capriotti's corporate: Keep your current meat supplier! Do not change! (Little birdie told me you're wanting the franchisees (?) to change...) Look at Toyota - that's what happens when you change what works in favor of trying to save a buck. You change your meat supplier to corporate meat, quality declines, customers Yelp that your sammies start sucking. How many times do you need to see it in other industries, let alone with food we inges?! Just don't do it.

I've had the Capastrami, Bobbie, Cheesesteak, tuna, homemade roastbeef, Italian, meatball sub and veggie cheesesteak (just out of curiosity). I also get their grilled cheese sandwich which has at least 4 slices of cheese.  At the counter, they have Tastykakes - if you're from the East, you know the yummy goodness I'm talking about.

There are 2 things I used to dislike: tuna sub and salt & vinegar chips. But for some odd reason, when I tried eating these together, I was pleasantly surprised.  Their tuna isn't fishy, the mayo isn't overpowering and the onions are not overwhelming. Then you have salty tangy chips...mmmmmm...

But what really makes this place a must-try is their BOBBIE which is Thanksgiving in a sub sandwich.  It has stuffing, cranberry sauce and of course, turkey.

5851237,2007-06-26,0,Ea3BblvC4zzagYI_1cNumA,"An office favorite.  One of the many locations in the Las Vegas Valley, but this one is more memorable to me than the others I've visited.  More on that later.

Capriotti's is a sandwich shop whose slogan is ""Quality is our only gimmick""  and they have proven that to us with every visit.   We have yet to get one bad sandwich out of the bunch, and we have ben getting lunch here at least once a week for the past two years that I have been working for my company.   

Some of our favorite sandwiches include
The Bobbie - aka Thanksgiving dinner on a roll.  Shredded turkey, Cranbery sauce and Stuffing and Mayo wrapped in the bread of your choice.
Capastrami - Hot Pastrami, Cole Slaw, Russian Dressing and Swiss
Mushroom Cheese Steaks
Sweet Italian Sausage with Sweet Peppers
And what we lovingly refer to as the ""Joe Pesci"" which is a Small Italian with extra peppers.

These are not your average skimpy subs, the small rolls are 9"" and the large are 20"" and they are fit  to bursting with all the goodies. So make sure to bring your appetite!

But my favorite reason to go to this specific location is, depending on how much of a tip you leave them, they show their gratitude by yelling out either: "" BEER MONEY!  or BIG BEER MONEY!!""  Either reaction is cool, but it's always fun to hear ""BIG BEER MONEY!""  I won't tell you at what amount beer money becomes BIG beer money, that's up to you and your generosity to find out.",j3Xr0XifJTb43Hdmue8b9A,0,0,4,OrFQy8hcXaAUZzpabNYkeA

I planned on getting the Bobbie since that is what everyone raves about but when I found out it was a cold sandwich that kinda turn me off.  I ended up with the cheesesteak sandwich.  The sandwich was pretty good.  Hubby had a tuna sandwich and he said it was just like a big subway sandwich (he likes subway but I'm not sure that was a compliment).  Drinks are bottles so no refills.  The service was fast and friendly.  This location had a terrible sewage oder in the dining room that was even stronger in the bathroom.  It made eating much less enjoyable than it should have been.  I would rate the food 4 stars but will remove a star for the horrible stench.  When I go back next time hopefully the smell will be gone and I can bump the star level up.,eectGb7-g_Xx7ftGqxr5bg,0,0,3,no7iR61_izxVG1qLoIzuQQ
