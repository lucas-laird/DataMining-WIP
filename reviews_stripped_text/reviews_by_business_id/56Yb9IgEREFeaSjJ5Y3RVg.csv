We ordered four pieces of fried chicken with two sides (bbq beans with mac & cheese) and the chicken was nicely prepared in about twenty minutes and good portion.  The skin could have used a tad more seasoning or may be this is the way how Huffman made theirs.   It looks like the Blue Ribbon chicken except it is moister with crispier skin - which I preferred.  

Price is reasonable and the restaurant setting is very casual and comfy.  Parking could be a challenge on weekend.  Another good destination place for lunch and our server Erin was so wonderful and made us felt welcome.",HE1C_JR8rF8Oht4W0mGgmw,0,0,4,VJvLLrxfSynn8Bse_1p5HQ

1622624,2018-04-26,0,56Yb9IgEREFeaSjJ5Y3RVg,"This is relatively a new establishment in the Boca Park shopping area of Summerlin. It sits next to Panacea and Cheesecake Factory. Lots of parking during the day but a challenging parking situation during weekend evenings.

So you may ask if it's fair to give a review after dining on only ONE menu item when a choice of 25 or more are available. Yes, I say. For one, I had chicken. This is their signature item, so my expectation was easily set.

I had lunch on a Thursday at 1:15. I ate outside on the patio (wooden picnic tables with attached benches... not very comfortable). I ordered the 1/4 chicken with 2 sides (cole slaw and baked pea beans). The chicken was covered with Marsala sauce (I had a choice of three: BBQ & Lemon-Herb). My order was not a luncheon special but a regular lunch/dinner item. The cost: $12.00 (thank you for not putting pennies on the price). My WONDERFUL server was the bubbly and enthusiastic Erin who saw to all of my culinary needs.

The chicken and sauce were superb. They hit it right on the bulls-eye. It was falling-off-the-bone cooked and melty-tender. Perfect! The savory sauce was rich and lusty (I've been trying to squeeze that word in for a while). The sauce had fresh (not canned) mushrooms... yumm! Cole slaw was creamy, and the sweet BBQ beans were fine.

So here's my only ding... and you can argue the point. The chicken pieces were on the small side. So for $12.00, I thought it was $2 over-priced. Yes, the prices in and around the Boca/Tivoli areas are a tad higher than other non-strip Vegas dining spots, and I would have been ""ok"" had the chicken pieces been larger. However I think the bang-for-your-buck was on the low side. To me this was a $10 lunch max.

Bottom line... I would recommend checking Huffman's [chicken] out and deciding for yourself. I'l probably go back just because the food was so darn good :)

[Dana's note: Boca Park has had quite a turnover the past couple of years. Several establishments have come and gone. The last restaurant used to be where Huffman's is and they lasted less then a year. I suspect a ""high rent"" issue.]",fwStqPnr2ks06nwFbZv0zw,1,0,4,T64g2QOlC79lq_HW0gW29w

Next I tried to order a glass of wine.  They do claim to be chicken and spirits. There wasn't a wine list, but the server was willing to ask the bar what they have. My red wine came and was vinegary. I was just going to drink it, but my husband asked for a glass from a fresh bottle and it was better.

So the real reason for the 2 star review was the food. My husband got a salad and the chicken was so dry it was fairly inedible. The buttermilk fried tenders were juicier, but lacked any flavor. You had to use a dipping sauce for any flavor. The waffle was OK.

We went for lunch, hoping to find a new place to go, and while the restaurant looks great, the food was a disaster. I ordered the two piece fried chicken with mac & cheese and baked beans for my sides. When it arrived, it didn't even look like the chicken I see in some of the pictures here on Yelp. It looked like someone took two pieces of chicken rolled it in a bowl full of spices, but no flour, and dropped it in a fryer. They were also ridiculously small pieces of chicken, especially for $13. I took one bite just to prove my suspicions, and all I tasted was paprika and salt and who knows what else. The macaroni and cheese looked like it came out of a box or had been frozen, and tasted that way too. (The frozen mac I get from Trader Joe's is ten times better.) The baked beans looked like they had been dumped straight out of a can. I tried each item, but nothing was edible and definitely not worth the price.

My mom ordered the Crispy Chicken Sandwich, which is two large chicken tenders on a bun. Thankfully, her sandwich was edible, though it was so underseasoned she had to add salt to it. The crinkle cut fries were the best part of the meal. (But I can go to Del Taco and get crinkle cut fries!)

As I mentioned above, the one positive was our server, Ashley. She was so nice and offered many times to get me something else to eat and made sure my meal was taken off of the bill. She was wonderful, and I'm sorry to say I hope she has another job lined up, because there's no way this restaurant will make it with the Summerlin crowd. (If I want to go get pricy chicken I'll walk next door and go to Cheesecake Factory to get the Cajun Chicken Littles which I know are good.)

I would definitely not go here again unless they did a complete overhaul of their food. I'd rather go through a Popeye's drive-thru than eat that mess again.",xi60GhNS-sb9_ks7RpVoWA,4,0,1,zQtPr_Owyh7xTT-W_kcvQg

The location is large, well lit, and separated by a bar area, a middle sundae/milkshake exciting buffet section, and then a dining room. You can walk up to the middle area and order a custom milkshake or sundae at anytime during your dinner and it will be charged to your final bill. Nobody actually explained that to us, but after a ton of questions to multiple people we did get a shake. 
Between 7 of us, we ordered 3 or 4 chicken meals, yet all of them seemed very similar with the same dry bland boneless fried chicken. The chicken salad was basic, as was the sandwich. But again, how are you a chicken place with flavorless not juicy chicken?! Flavorless should be the word of the evening here because I felt that way about everything! The mac & cheese looked nothing like the pictures on the website and not one person at the table enjoyed it. All the sides were so bland! The one thing that DID have flavor was the soup, and it was overwhelmingly salty. 
I have a theory that this particular suite in this building is cursed. Truly. A few places with great reputations and potential have came and gone and never succeeded here. I think it may have to do with the plumbing, when you walk in the back towards the restrooms the sulfur smell was very apparent!

Very friendly and greeted by multiple servers on my way to the counter; the place was rather empty, I was assuming maybe because it was still fairly new.
Pay; leave; go out to the car and check my food - first thing, only one side of fries and the didn't end up being truffle fries.  Only one side of honey mustard and one side of ranch.
Went back in and was made to feel like I had confused them when placing my order - nevertheless, the made another order of truffle fries and did it at no charge and brought another ranch and honey mustard.
Got home to eat with my wife; first thing the fries: hard as a rock like they had been re heated in a grease vat - no flavor on them to speak of - definitely no hint of truffle flavor despite the extra charge.  A bit disappointed; my wife and I are both pretty big fans of good truffle fries.  Nonetheless we went on to the chicken tenders.... and just flavorless.  I would have to argue that they are not chicken tenders as it seems like a cut near a thigh or leg and not a breast cut at all.  Very greasy, with chucks of grisly fat hanging - I had to spit mine out at one pint and neither of us finished eating the fries or the chicken.
The only reason there are 2 stars here, is that the chicken noodle soup was actually pretty tasty.  I have had better and have made way better (in less than 8 hours of cooking) but it was still what I would say was tasteful and filling. 
All in all - we ended up going to Taco Bell and having a couple tacos to make up for the fact all we could force ourselves to finish was the soup.",BG1ZGd3Wz06gUaODSweAlw,1,0,2,zMGZrr0SpvIjf5lOfNIylw

I had 4 piece chicken dinner + 2 sides. I upgraded one of the pieces for ""white meat"" for an additional $1. My meal Cost $19 +$1 + $2.50 . I think that is a little pricey for 4 pieces of chicken. My sides were Mac n Cheese and corn casserole ($2.50 upcharge for the corn casserole). 
Mac n Cheese was probably the worst I've ever had. The honey mustard dipping sauce (which seemed homemade) was like straight mustard with just a hint of sweet. I really didn't like it. The corn casserole which I was so freakin excited about turned out to be a weird creamed corn (not a casserole at all) (in my opinion) so I was disappointed. But I did eat about 1/2 of it. So it wasn't horrible, just not was I expected. We did get what I think is a freebie side of coleslaw which we were happy about but... The coleslaw was dry. 
Chicken was better than your average bar food. But for Summerlin peeps I'd say I still prefer blue ribbon fried chicken. 
Atmosphere was decent. They played Bruno Mars and similar music the whole time which I liked.

Given that it was still their soft opening, the server didn't do anything to explain the restaurant or even mention the happy hour or asked if we wanted cocktails. The food was very bland. The 2 piece chicken meal while very tender and crisp was just underwhelming flavor wise. I had mashed potatoes w/gravy (too salty) and the corn casserole (prob the best thing of everything I had). We had the chicken & waffles. The waffles were good but again the chicken was disappointing. The 12 piece chicken wings were crispy but again bland. The sauces were all underwhelming. The Huffman's sauce is just a thicker version of Cane's chicken sauce, but not as good. It's slightly pricey but not unreasonable. We had high hopes going in but we were pretty disappointed with the whole experience. Blue Ribbon chicken in Downtown Summerlin (or even Cane's) is better.

I gave it two stars since I hope this place will get better, but we won't go back anytime soon.",w808Y6VJobMClC0BMJnBYQ,0,0,2,imujed-d7ioXNW_VmhaT4A

2716249,2018-03-16,0,56Yb9IgEREFeaSjJ5Y3RVg,"Lots of room for improvement. Service was okay. I would describe the food as ""below average bar food."" I'm not really sure what kind of clientele they are trying to attract; it seems like a sports bar. It is supposedly family friendly but you must walk through a smoking bar to get to the non-smoking family area. We could smell cigarette smoke during most of our meal. Even if they could nail the chicken (which they haven't), most of the sides were average to inedible. Seems like they are cutting corners on sides.

As for the food, here it goes...

Fried Pickles: they are spears (I prefer chips) but breading was good, so I was pleasantly surprised.

2-piece Fried Chicken: Asked for leg and breast, but received leg and thigh. No bone in thigh (strange). Brine was good making the chicken juicy but breading was not seasoned well and seemed overly greasy (as if the fryer wasn't hot enough).

Mac & Cheese: Cold and flavorless, did not eat. Boxed Kraft is better.

Wings: Average to good.

Fries: Pretty sure frozen crinkle fries from a bag... edible, but not good.

Cole Slaw: In bad need of seasoning (salt/pepper) and vinegar. Tasted mostly like cabbage mixed with mayo.

We might give it another chance in a few months if reviews improve, but they need some MAJOR changes to compete with the plethora of dining options available.",rSkwN7QvVHb_3oO3Ss7KUA,3,0,2,ADnS6HgN7GDhOXI0NJg2eA
2725012,2018-05-22,1,56Yb9IgEREFeaSjJ5Y3RVg,"I'm only giving this three stars because of the bartender. He saved the night and made our experience tolerable. We specifically came in for the Golden Knights watch party. But apparently no one in the restaurant working knew anything about it. Their website said that they had specials on beers burgers and pizza. When we tried to order those they didn't know what we were talking about and had to take the information to the owner and have a five minute discussion in order to get it approved.

I'd really like to see this location succeed since nothing has lasted there since Gordon Biersch went out of business. Maybe adding some signage outside letting people know what's going on - like they're showing the Golden Knights games! We have specials! 

I saw another couple come in wearing Golden Knights gear and they looked at the menu and left because the menu didn't say anything about the specials that they were advertising on their website and on their social media sites.

I like to support newly opening business and my fingers were crossed I'd picked a winner.  I was really impressed with the exterior of the building and the dining area was clean. Sadly, that's about all I was impressed with.

-  While our service was good, I've never had a server tell me thank you for coming in so many times. It was upward of 20 times, no joke. I appreciate the positive vibes just as much much as the next guys, it was starting to be too much! 

-  Nothing about our meal was good. My husband is the type to eat anything and never say a word, but I have to let the Management know that the food was a let down. The Loaded Fries were over cooked to the point where they were it was hard to chew...the white corn chowder turned out to be yellow corn that tasted like it was just dumped out of a freezer bag, added cornmeal and a random blend of cheese. 

- I ordered the chicken and waffles which turned out to be a chicken and waffle sandwich with a pile coleslaw in the middle. The worst part was the syrup. It was so bad I had to ask what was in it. It was clashing with my taste buds bad - I was told it was maple syrup mixed with cayenne pepper. I love the idea of a sweet and spicy syrup but it was not spicy at all...just left a funky take in my mouth.

- Dinner was $60 for two adults and a child.

I ordered the pepperoni pizza...it came back super greasy, I went through several napkins trying the soak most of it up. His burger was super well done and the crinkle fries looked like frozen ones from a bag that weren't cooked long enough. My pizza tasted like a frozen pizza that was put in the oven.  

The service was excellent, but the best way to describe the food would be ""concession stand"" food at Summerland prices. We won't be returning to this restaurant and won't recommend it to anyone.

I was curious about the Chicken Waffle sliders (slider, the dish comes with one but the menu has a typo that says ""sliderS""). It's a beautiful bar and restaurant that still has that ""new car"" smell and feel. Think rustic farm with a modern twist.  At the bar, all available liquors and beers are presented on easily visible shelves. There is also a huge circular second bar for milkshakes further into the restaurant. Toppings are displayed in large see-through jars for a nice colorful presentation. I refrained from that adventure this time around though lol...

When we first walked in we were immediately greeted by Erin who was eventually our server. Jamie was working the bar and he was very personable and informative. Unfortunately in the food industry you can come across a pretty server that can be uppity and not attentive. This was not the case with Erin, she was very prompt with all requests and super friendly. She has a contagious smile and personality. We chatted several times but not at levels that would interfere with other tables. Michelle, the GM, stopped by to check on us as well.  

Good coffee, nice and strong. The Chicken Waffle sliders were good, next time I might ask for crispier waffles but only because I personally like waffles very well done. The chicken was moist, tender, and flavorfully breaded. 

I ordered the BBQ chicken pizza through Michelle's recommendation. I have had MANY BBQ Chick pizzas and this was hands down the best! The crust was crispy, light, and airy but still dense enough to hold the weight of the toppings. The chicken was moist and tender, the bbq sauce was a perfect blend of sweet and smoky, the onions had a crunch to them still as well. Fantastic pizza! Soooo...

My bro ordered a 2 piece 2 side chicken deal with mashed potatoes and mac n cheese. He said the Mac was ok but not watery like other reviewers have said. He said the chicken was cooked perfectly and very tender but seemed like they maybe could've used less batter. He did like the sliders so we were wondering if they used different batter for different chicken items?

On our way out, I put a quick 20 into one of the 5 machines at the bar. I hit for $250!! Dropped my new buddy the bartender, Jamie, $40 and left after ""free"" dinner and up a couple hundred bucks! Yeaaah buddy!! 

So... All in all, great experience. Staff was awesome, food was good, and the machines were good to me. Can't get any better than that!",DZCU-9ajMZA6J_-AG3OSZA,0,0,4,bb4vO57GDKdAnat8tcOvGQ

In theory, this would be my type of place.  Laid back, with fried foods, and some arcade games.  What's not to like?  Let me preface this with I am in no way a food snob.  

My gf and I came at 2:30 in the afternoon.  There were people kind of standing around as you walk in, yet no one greeted us for the first 30 seconds. So we stood there.  Didn't realize that there isn't a server's table or anything when you walk in- it's just the bar area.  That has booths, hi-tops and the bar.  Okay.....  So seat yourself.  Have a sign then. 

GF ordered a chicken sandwich with a salad instead of fries.  I ordered 3 tenders and small order of wings. One order to have fries and the other mac and cheese.

Sandwich came out with fries.  Okay, no biggie.  Salad came in a minute.  All iceberg lettuce.  Okay, we are not at a 4 star place.  She bit into her chicken sandwich and could barely swallow since in was so dry.  She wanted my opinion.  I took a huge bite to get into the middle.  Cooked seriously to 200 degrees.  Bad.

My tenders were decent, but not great.  Wings looked like they came from a grocery store freezer.  They were okay.  Wouldn't get again though.  Fries were average.  I joked that the mac and cheese looked like Kraft.  My gf said no, it looks a little different.  She took a bite and said, oh, not Kraft, but generic store brand mac and cheese.  Seriously.  That being said, I kinda like that, but not when I go out. 

Anyway, they were nice about saying the chicken was overcooked and offered right away to take it off the bill and if we would like anything to replace it.  Declined.  GF enjoyed some of my tenders and her salad.

Someone from the back came out and apologized  Said they used the wrong chicken??  Huh... anyway, again, no big deal.  He offered us to free desserts.  Which we never received probably because he didn't pass that along to our server/bartender.  We weren't going to ask.  

And the arcade... like 6 games.  Three of which are crane games.  One pac-man. And two god knows what.  Odd collection. 

Most long winded review ever.   Sorry.

So it's no surprise that she was eagerly awaiting the opening of Huffman's Homemade Chicken in their newest location located in Boca Park. Unfortunately, our first experience was less than satisfactory. My wife ordered a 6 Piece Chicken Wings with Fresh Hand-Cut Fries, $10 along with their Huffman's Signature sauce, $1.00 and I ordered a Crispy Buttermilk Sandwich, $12. In addition we ordered a Side of White Corn Casserole, $7.00 to share. My wife did not care for the Wings. They were served plain and by her account lacked flavor. My sandwich was unexceptional. We both agreed that the White Corn Casserole did not work for us. Service, while not bad was, for lack of a better word, awkward. Presentation was lacking as well as food was served on paper plates, plastic baskets and tin foil containers. The whole experience was like being in a fancy dining room of a fast food operation. I had a complete ""disconnect"" about the whole dining experience. I think their web site says it all. In my opinion, they have a fast food concept inside a ""high-end"" location along with a ""full gaming bar"" in a ""family-friendly environment."" The whole dinning experience was a bit of a let down for us. So much so, that my wife felt the need to apologize about picking this venue to dine at. It wasn't bad, it's just that it was not what we had expected. To be fair, I will try this restaurant again. Now that I know what this concept is or more importantly, what it is not, I will return and try other items on their menu",oiBTrfymtRfqJus6AI9yGA,3,0,2,rjEq6p6ArwALVzcsLGUvpQ

Not great for a kids arcade..... The music playing in the background singing, ""I fucking hate you but I love you just the same."" Decide which you want to be, a kids place or a grown up place.

I'm certain that I may be a chicken aficionado based on the countless times I've enjoyed the bird as my main meal.  Therefore, one can understand the excitement and Joy I experienced when I saw the Hoffman's Homemade Chicken sign being erected on a main thoroughfare near my home.  My mind raced 'homemade chicken 5 minutes from my home!' Tonight was the night, my family and I decided to go out for dinner. When the restaurant discussion began they unanimously voted Fleming's  for a nice juicy steak, they were all so excited! While driving to Fleming's I took a left turn as once again I saw the regal chicken on the newly constructed Hoffman's sign.  At that point I announced my veto rights to the restaurant as the financier of the venture and let the family know we are going to the chicken dinner of our young hot lives and the Hoffman's sign was so cool it has to be great!  

They didn't buy it, but we all got out of the car in anticipation of a great family dinner with dads favorite meal, chicken.  When we went to the door it was locked.  There were people in there it was just locked.  As we turned to leave a woman opened the door and and said 'oh I'm sorry we are closing early tonight!' I led my family back to the car hat in hand and headed to Fleming's.   As I ate my perfectly prepared steak with brussel sprouts I pondered, that must be some goooooood chicken if they can afford that cool sign and to close early too!'

4144568,2018-02-25,0,56Yb9IgEREFeaSjJ5Y3RVg,"4 of us went in to try this place out. The place looks great when you first walk in but that is about as far as nice goes. We were seated quickly and then we sat waiting for someone to come take our drink orders. It was not that busy but people were milling around. 3 employees to clean one table that had a small family that had just left after we were seated, and we had to grab someone as they walked by, never intending to stop at our table,  to get our drink and food order in. 

We had previously looked at the menu online and saw some of the dishes that looked delicious. 1 item we wanted, Buffalo Mac N Cheese, was not on the menu. The waitress told us that we could still order it and it was a side dish and not a main entree, which was fine by us as we intended to order a few different items and share.

The items ordered:

Jalapeno Burger $13
2 Chicken and Waffle Sliders $12 (its listed on the menu as $9 for Sliders but its actually only 1 or you can order 2 for $12)
Buffalo Mac N Cheese $8 (not on the menu and not worth the size of the portion)
2 Pieces of Chicken and 2 sides $12
3 Beers $20

The food was less than spectacular looking and not very tasty.

The burger was just OK. Thin beef patty, couple jalapenos. 
The sliders were ehhh. The waffle was tasty, the chicken was on the plain side. DEFINITELY not worth $9 for one or even $12 for 2.
 The chicken and sides were a joke. The chicken pieces were small and boring. The 1 side, Cole slaw, had little flavor. The Biscuit and gravy was just OK.
The Buffalo Mac N Cheese came out well after all the other food was eaten. It had a good flavor but was not very hot (spicy nor temperature) and tasted more like Mac N Cheese from a box with some buffalo chicken mixed in.

The worst part of the whole meal was how the food was brought out. Now I am not looking for fine china.... but I was also not expecting what we got.

The food came on paper plates, and the sides came in mini pie tins. If I wanted paper serving plates, I could go to a fast food restaurant and get my meal in a clam shell box or wrapped in paper. The tins gave the food a slightly metallic taste when using the stainless steel flatware. Look at the pictures from other reviews.  

We questioned our waitress on the use of paper plates and we got a story that they have only ""soft opened"" and still working things out. I would think that you would have your plates, utensils, and drink ware figured out prior to serving your first customer. 

They will need to make some major improvements to be successful. I wish them luck.",FIUc-dZGPgcwGNhh9NBSqQ,4,0,2,NaCJt769CqWiiO_4jxFgtw
4163715,2018-02-12,0,56Yb9IgEREFeaSjJ5Y3RVg,"I really wanted to love this place since it's right up the road from my house. Aesthetically, this restaurant is gorgeous. The outside patio is perfect for an afternoon lunch. And, the inside is very sophisticated. It has a cute round table area with candies. However, I am not entirely sure how relevant it was for the restaurant since I didn't see any items with candy on it. The only thing missing was a dedicated area where guests would go to see a hostess. No hostess stand, so we were just kind of wandering the restaurant in a confused manner. 

As far as the food goes... the food was good. Nothing spectacular, but good. The chicken and waffles appetizer was good. However, the spicy syrup had no kick to it. I am a lover of spicy, so I was particularly disappointed in that aspect. The side of corn was fantastic. The mash potatoes and gravy were way too salty, and the gravy didn't have that great of a flavor. The mac 'n' cheese was good. I was not entirely impressed with the chicken sandwich. But, the fried chicken pieces were pretty good. 

The service was relatively good. It seemed like they still had a few things to work out since they were so new. But, overall, the service was very good. The servers were very attentive. However, a few things slipped through the cracks. Initially, we asked what was good. Our server raved about the chicken and waffles appetizer. We didn't actually order it, but she put it in as an order. So, it came. We were hungry, so we dove in, anyway. It was good. So, that wasn't really a problem. Then, there were just a few pet peeve things. But, overall, was still satisfied with the service. 

Price. This is the main thing that was a turn-off for me. I know this is Summerlin, but the prices were similar to the Strip. It was very expensive for what it was. It did not have anything particularly special about it to warrant the price. For two people, our bill ended up being $80 (with tip). And, we ordered a soda, a cocktail, the appetizer (again, which we didn't technically order), a chicken sandwich, a fried chicken entree, and one side. They said they had to charge us for extra sauces, so that was an additional $2. It was just a lot for fried chicken. 

Overall, I will probably not be returning. I just can't justify the price for the food. The service was good. The place is beautiful. The food is good, but nothing special.",nrzswAPvMSjecJt8nK_BFQ,6,1,3,FWY5bih5MHoLLRk4QyWliA

For a relatively new place, greeters and servers were not too enthused. Service was good, but not great. 
Chicken tenders were fried, but batter was soft, we were expecting crunchy. Crinkle fries were ok, but  a little off temp. and dry; not even as good as Del Taco's or Cane's - they tasted either under cooked, had been sitting out, or were prepared in an oven.

I thought I was getting chicken but it was more like tenders.   They were not huge.   It seems like the sides made up for the small chicken pieces.  I tried my friend's dark meat chicken since he ordered the dark meat and it tasted different.  His had a weird ginger taste and was not as crunchy.  I did not care for.  Neither did he.  Said my chicken tasted better.   The sides were a good portion.  The coleslaw was good.  The Mac n cheese was missing something.  It was bland.  Added salt, which I usually never do, but it was not that either.  I think it was lacking cheese. Tried my friends loaded fries but cheese was like valveeta which I'm not a fan of.

When we came in we weren't greeted, and we yelled over to the bartender to see where we sit, was there a hostess, etc. We were told just grab a seat wherever we want. We went to the back to get some quiet and do some work over lunch. 

I ordered the four piece chicken, with two sides. The chicken was boneless, and I was hoping for something more traditional. You couldn't hold the chicken as the breading was sliding off and couldn't be held. Used a knife and fork, and it was honestly the most bland piece of food I had ever tasted. Gave a piece to my colleague, same thing. Absolutely no flavor. 

We ordered some wings, they were called Jumbo wings, but the wings were fairly small. They tasted ok, and came with fries. I asked for ketchup for the fries and the server brought over the ketchup bottle with one of those flip tops. When I opened the ketchup my plate was immediately covered with live ants. LIVE ANTS. Say it again, LIVE ANTS. The inside of the ketchup lid was still covered with a ton of them. I let the server know and she took the plate and the ketchup bottle and brought me back some individual servings of ketchup. Although she was very apologetic, no visit from the manager, no discount, etc.

Air conditioning was blasting inside and was almost unbearable. We each ordered a chicken finger meal. The waitress said it takes 20 minutes to cook. Seems like a long time considering it was just chicken fingers and they weren't busy. They arrived in 15 minutes. A bit pricy for chicken fingers considering they reminded me of Raising Canes's to the way they looked and tasted.  Down to the crinkle cut fries. The only difference was a few more selections of dipping sauces and price.  $12.00 for a 3 piece meal and $15.00 for a 4 piece meal is a bit pricy if you comparing again to the likes of RC's.  Service was so, so.  Waitress didn't come back to check on us after receiving our food so asked someone with a broom in hand for another sauce and our beverages were never refilled. Going to be tough when you have Cheesecake Factory right next door with much more selection.  May end up getting overflow. Had a neat sundae bar in the middle where the prior restaurant had their Mongolian like cooktops.  Good use of that space.  An area in the back for a soon to be arcade with and tables right outside to watch the kids. They need to enclose that area with glass because that will be too loud for the tables up front.

After the bartender explained the menu to us my husband and I decided to go with the whole roasted chicken. I don't understand how you put a whole chicken on the menu and then offer single serving of sides with it. I don't know many single people that would order a whole chicken and two sides to themselves. It would make more sense to me to serve sides enough for at least two people to share. The Mac n cheese was bland and the mashed potatoes were nothing special. I was even surprised a side of bread was not added to it for the price. For $24 I would much rather have spent my money elsewhere because this was not worth it.

The others were okay, but not really our types but the server brought them all out to try which was awesome.

Unfortunately from the moment we walked in it was a bit of a twilight zone. There wasn't a hostess area so you are kind of just standing around wondering if you seat yourself. After a couple of minutes someone approached us and seated us.

The restaurant itself is similar to the previous restaurant with very little improvements made. Even the old hood is still in the middle of the restaurant now surrounded with candy jars and being used as a server station. Kind of odd.

Once we sat down the server explained the menu to us and with the exception of the burgers and pizza,  we were still confused with what they were serving in regards to chicken as every question we asked was answered with ""its chicken fingers"". Me not wanting chicken fingers I ordered what was described as a "" fried chicken dinner"" and agreed to pay a one dollar up charge per piece of chicken for white meat. I ordered mac and cheese and biscuits and gravy as my side. Being from the south I was getting excited until the food actually arrived. I was a bit puzzled to see 2 chicken tenders sitting on top of a bed of disgusting fries. I asked the server is there was a mistake and he said as I mentioned earlier everything is chicken fingers. I then questioned why did I pay a 1 dollar up charge for white meat and why are you calling this a fried chicken dinner? He really didn't have any answers so I moved on. The ""chicken tenders"" were good and fresh but the fries, Mac and cheese and biscuits and gravy (half a biscuit covered in white gravy served in a small aluminum pan)  were not good and subpar at best.

My wife ordered a fried chicken sandwich that she said was pretty good, again served with the same Gross fries and my kids split an order of chicken and waffles. (Kids meals have two options mac and cheese or chicken fingers).  When the chicken and waffles arrived there was no syrup so we asked for some syrup and the server said ""we only have spicy maple syrup, is that OK"" my wife and I are looking at each other like ""seriously"". The server says "" let me see if I can find you some regular syrup in the back"" whish he did manage to find.  Again the chicken was good (chicken fingers), I tasted a bit of the waffle and it was just ok and nothing special. 

The bill with tip was a little over 60 dollars. Needless to say if I want to have chicken fingers I will go to a fast food restaurant that specializes in chicken fingers for a third of the price. 

I am not a food blogger and do no not write reviews often but this is one experience that I left and truly felt I got ripped off for what the food was.

We walked in about half an hour before they closed, ordered their signature roasted chicken (lemon herb sauce) and 3 ""Jumbo"" chicken tenders and our sides were Mac n Cheese, Corn casserole, and baked beans. 

The lemon herb chicken lacked flavor, the Mac and cheese was mush and baked beans tasted like they came out from a can not to mention the terribly seasoned corn casserole that lacked salt. All sides were served lukewarm.   Oh and they serve them in paper containers. Really? For a $17 chicken dinner! ?

Now about those chicken tenders , they were NOT ""jumbo"" for 12 dollars they charge for these. 
I could barely eat one.  They tasted like old oil.  There was NOTHING special about the breading frankly you are better off going to Canes, Chicken Shack or even Denny's for some chicken tenders or heck just walk by this place and go next door to Cheesecake Factory.

It took about 5 minutes for a server to come over to us and we were given a broken high chair. Also, a ring around the sprinkler head above us fell to the ground and thankfully missed hitting us. 

There was some confusion when we ordered. We asked for the chicken and waffle sliders as a starter (note the pluralization of slider) and the server told us that it only comes with one and if we wanted two we should order the chicken and waffles. My husband and I were both confused, but we stuck with our order of sliderS. When the order came out there was two sliders. They were served with some syrup that was supposedly infused with cayenne pepper, but it tasted like regular syrup. Overall, they didn't taste bad, but they weren't great. The cole slaw they came with was decent. 

For our ""entree"" we ordered 5 Chicken Tenders that came with fries. The chicken tenders are hearty and tasty. The fries were soggy and tasteless (perhaps soggy because they were served underneath hot tenders?). The honey mustard and BBQ sauces were what you'd expect, nothing special.

We also ordered a large side of Mac and Cheese. I was pretty confused when it was delivered and asked the server what the second container on the plate was (see photos). She said that it was a large. Both containers tasted completely different, but both were good. One was dry and crumbly and the other was cheesy and soft. I'm not sure what one can expect from their Mac and cheese. My advice to the restaurant would be to be consistent and perhaps have someone like an expo check orders before they go out.

The server was sweet and stressed that it was a soft opening and they would be changing the menu and adding a bunch of things such as grilled cheese with veggies & Patty melts before their grand opening. 

I hope they educate the cooks & servers on their existing menu and try and be consistent. All the back tables were filled with people filling out applications - hope they find a good crew & improve before their grand opening.",4wllBAI5xR2wF_oSDz4_dw,3,1,3,h40gIGQ4cLxOe9EIbE2wYg

I'm definitely not worried about paying for valet parking to walk into a hotel to get a home cooked piece of fried chicken.  And I wont be going back to the Summerlin mall for overpriced junk either.  This chicken will give way to a new modern day epidemic.  Picture Huffington chicken fiends going about trying to score a buck to make their purchase.  Balance on the taste buds is what a foodie looks for while dining anywhere and being a brother with southern roots I can be quite snotty about my fried chicken,  but the chicken, sides, and sauces were amazing.  Balanced flavor in everything I tasted my kids agreed too!  My son even ate his cole-slaw.  Usually impossible to see him do.  I'll definitely be heading back,  especially for the kid in a candy jar desert bar snack dab in the middle of the restaurant, that will make this place a brand aside from the perfectly fried chicken.

But, 5 star service with both ladies. They were so sweet & pleasant.",6yVxm0_6-lVtMAh8ellirQ,0,0,3,mH5BUab8V2mqM41Y2N0kIA

Further, the food is just awful.

I ordered the chicken cordon blue sandwich with a side salad. The chicken patty was the thinnest and driest I've ever bit into. The iceberg lettuce used for the salad looked like it was a mix you by at the store with carrots and cabbage, except there wasn't a green leaf on the plate. 

Boyfriend had the chicken tenders in a honey Sriracha sauce and they were pretty good. Fired nicely. The fries, however, were like the frozen OreIda ones we ate as kids. No seasoning. And you wouldn't think a place could screw up mac and cheese, but this place has. Most likely from a box with a gross artificial cheese flavor. 

Unfortunately, this place isn't going to make it unless something drastic happens to change the quality of the food. Especially since it's next door to Cheesecake Factory and Hussong's Cantina.",qoxnaciQR_sLCqvHeDfUbA,0,0,2,gqVysiW7DH_C64yh8NOYdg

It was completely empty on a Saturday night. The bartender acted as the bartender and the host. They had NO drink menu. Definitely won't be going back.",i__33AuXcnUbzSGzsFAESg,0,0,1,xikv93WPzCo6vVP6Jt6vRA

5808682,2018-06-04,0,56Yb9IgEREFeaSjJ5Y3RVg,"Went there for lunch yesterday..Wanted to like this place but unfortunately the other yelp reviews were right... customer service was great but the food was horrible. I ordered the lemon herb rotisserie chicken with mash potatoes n garlic spinach. The chicken was rubbery with no flavor. The chicken was actually so pale that I thought it wasn't totally cooked but it was. The skin had that rubbery texture with lemon herb sauce poured over it bc all the sauce was actually around the chicken on the plate. The mash potatoes tasted meh and the gravy was horrible, it was as congealed and lumpy. The garlic sautéed spinach was not fresh, you can tell it was the chopped frozen stuff. For $12 I would have rather gone to pollo loco for half the price n way better food. The fried zucchini appetizer was actually ok but nothing to rave about for $7.",7knsmhYRNtVunh6sNvrrtg,0,0,2,zvjADm5-ohiyVmu-I3voqw

We got the fried zucchini for an appetizer, and then got Italian herb and buttermilk chicken. We didn't know they came with fries  so we ordered gravy fries as well. The chicken was really good.I liked the Italian herb best. We also got Huffman's sauce and sweet chili. Both sauces were amazing. The gravy fries were just ok, not what I was expecting. It was really runny gravy, not the thick kind of gravy. All in all I would come back, it was good and the service was nice as well.",8oNbx_xxll_oNUh-x-s16g,0,1,4,A7w2T7dYXcXfHjTR_IbgoQ

A simple order of a whole chicken with two sides add one. extra side of coke slaw. $33!!! Rip offThe extra side was 12 oz size the two sides were 6 oz about the size for a 5 year old's portion. The chicken was cut in half 
One half raw with white skin and one browned.

Gaming at the bar is the best bet, pun intended. Apparently this location wasn't meant to be a successful restaurant, maybe they should just focus on the gaming! 
I had the truffle fries shortly after they opened, and the menu has since changed. So they may not be on it now, which I hope isn't the case, as they were pretty good. I also had sangria on that visit, which was also good. 
The Web site is still advertising, ""Join us for our *Soft* Opening and let us know what you think!  We are now open daily, 11AM-9PM!"" The patio now has picnic tables and does offer a nice outdoor area. What was a cooking area is now a dessert bar, and they added arcade games in the back.

We ordered both the grilled chicken sandwich and the buttermilk chicken sandwich, both with coleslaw instead of fries. The lettuce seemed like it was 'thrown' on the sandwich, which hurt presentation slightly. Otherwise the meal was fantastic. The chicken tasted amazing, their ""Huffman's Sauce"" was tasty, coleslaw had plenty of dressing with great flavor. 

We chose to sit outside which was fun on the park benches, but some people may find it uncomfortable. Our service was pretty good for being the only one sitting outside. 

Overall a great experience. We'll definitely be returning.",nf7UPxu5-cagxa1G-FRISA,2,0,5,jQOQD_aHzKhJwgoQxMDG7g
