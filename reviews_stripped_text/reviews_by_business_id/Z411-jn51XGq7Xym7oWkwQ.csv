Always fast and fresh. The employees communicate with you and actually care to ask how you are. I highly recommend this location.",ltSn1gx1zqumSEGO4I8lmA,2,0,5,x-Raxawxqrcgt6ItKwq7Jg

4052708,2010-08-13,0,Z411-jn51XGq7Xym7oWkwQ,"This is a fairly new Port of Subs and because it is so close to my work, it is also the one I go to most often. I like Port of Subs,  but if other sandwich shops were closer to my work I would probably go to them more often.

So why the high review? The owner and employees of this specific location are great. Some of them have helped me enough times that they know what I am going to order, and I always love that. 

This location delivers as well!",Ae4uXwFHp-5fGrt6OONaXw,1,0,4,7J3eVMvB1TuX0gttLMg3Bw

She said coz customer complaints because of avocado falls of from the sandwich  ? I asked how come last week I took avocado from flamingo and koval gas station location? She said they are franchise and they do what they want to and doesn't care about the company said! I didn't care so it's none of my business so when she prepare my sandwich I saw little bug  on the mashed avocado & my wife  told her there's a small insect  like ant she check and she told me oh yeah let me remove and she took it to back and came kind of mad manor/attitude & told me you know what the flamingo and koval location has so many bugs you guys don't see!! Come on did I asked and why you talking like that same company you are working??

I go to them quite often since the meats and cheeses are sliced fresh I think it tastes better than subway precut operation. Nevertheless, the service was good and quick. They weren't over talkative but engaging, all that I could ask for from my sandwich artist. The sandwich was fresh and the bread was tasty. I'll be coming back.",aCAxzylyskoI803I0Sq0yQ,0,0,4,dOVIIwMbA6N7xCm3XFN-uA
