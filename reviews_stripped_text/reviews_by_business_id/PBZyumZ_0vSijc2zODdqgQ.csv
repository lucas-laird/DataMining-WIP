I am giving a 5 stars because when I walked in I was immediately greeted and seated. Right away they asked for my drink order and brought it. The menu was pretty simple and clear but not exactly the combinations I was looking for. The server made a suggestion and didn't make me feel like I was being difficult.  They checked on me a few times and even brought me sauce to go with my plain rice. I love the service and the food was also fresh and perfectly cooked.

The inside is nice and clean, classic and modern decor. Very attentive service, drinks were constantly re-filled and dirty plates were quickly picked up.

The Bowl Tique Signature Salad is so good! The dressing is flavorful but light, nice mix of veggies and they serve shredded chicken! Salads usually come with chunks of chicken breast so I really like that this place uses shredded chicken, a nice change and easier to eat!

The Signature Fried Rice is awesome! Also came with shredded chicken, they used egg whites, love the little pine nuts in the rice. Very flavorful but light, a healthy alternative compared to other fried rice which are oily and heavy. 

The Katsu Chicken is HUGE! So crispy and juicy, definitely big enough to share between two or three people. The Pan Fried noodles tasted as good as it smelled! I usually hate rice noodles but the flavors were so good I did not care! I think you can choose different types of noodles with each dish also, nice variety and options, something for everyone!

My verdict, if you like rice bowls, you might like this place. But for me, it did not tantalize my taste buds one bit.  From the advertisement, it looks like this place would serve more authentic Chinese cuisine.   Boy was I wrong and totally disappointed!. The spicy garlic sauce was way too sweet and spicy for my likeness and completely Americanized.  When I ordered the Combo Bowl with spicy garlic sauce,  they said it was just a little spicy.  I ordered ahead of time, but when I arrived some 20 minutes later, I still had to wait for them to finish cooking my food and there wasn't anyone else in the restaurant but me.

We stopped in for dinner while on vacation this week. The restaurant is small, maybe 8-10 tables, clean and welcoming. The owner was there and walked us through the menu, which is not massive, but well organized clear with enough choices for everyone. 

We ordered a sampler platter to start with egg rolls, tempura shrimp and pot stickers. It came with three sauces and all three were quite good. All of this was quite good. My favorite was the egg rolls: golden-brown, crunchy on the outside, soft and well done on the inside. 

For main courses, I had the beef ramen and my wife had the combo pan fried noodles. The ramen noodles were cooked perfectly, just a little tooth in the middle. The broth was rich with a well developed salty/savory flavor. The beef was absolutely amazing. It was flavorful, tender and most importantly, plentiful. 

My wife likes the pan noodles and said the shrimp was particularly good, but she thought the dish was a bit greasy for her personally. She also agreed my Ramen was great and plans to order that next time.

The tables are dark wood (we opted for the booth). The dinnerware is dark but is in line with the overall theme. It is sit-down, but you can order takeout too.  

The food is asian fusion. We got the pan fried noodles with pork tenderloin, combination fried rice, and the ramen noodle soup (including mushrooms, green onions, seaweed, mmm) with shredded chicken. It was excellent. Everything was delicious. The cuts of meat were exceptional. The beef was angus. The pork tenderloin was lean. The shredded chicken breast was clean, no veins, no tubes, perfect. Come to think of it, there was no fat in any of the meat (high quality). Nothing was overdone or salty. Hubby, son, & I enjoyed dinner very much. Also, the portions were quite generous. We had leftovers, mmm.

There was another family eating dinner, besides us, and later, another family. The service was excellent. The owner and the entire staff was very nice and attentive.

Usually not this much ""in love"" after a first visit, but this place is excellent.  I had the Signature Salad.  Huge!  Ingredients are super fresh.  Dressing is awesome, not too sweet, just perfect.  This salad can easily be shared.

Hubby ordered Beef Pan Fried Noodles (and I forgot the picture!)...  It was very very very good.  Again, fresh ingredients, quality beef.

At the corner of Flamingo and Durango, tucked on the side of the Albertson's center, you might be inclined to drive right by.  But don't drive by, STOP IN and eat some awesome Asian food.  Your stomach will thank you!",PdKwaZczlFHOL267EZff9g,1,0,5,jQ8r7I1cNMBY2HZqUg9jmg

We ordered a bunch of different items on the menu as we were really excited to try a new place. Shrimp tempura, chicken katsu, shrimp fried rice.

Food was okay. I didn't care for the sauces served with the shrimp tempura and chicken katsu.

Owner was really nice and our boba was on the house.

Not sure if I'll be back.
Loved the interior. Parking lot makes parking easy.",0nOIH8qIMnmZdLCTemnRsw,9,5,3,-PbqQ63Y8AEKUJSr4aA4HQ

5918552,2017-04-08,6,PBZyumZ_0vSijc2zODdqgQ,"Just happened to catch their signage while driving past their location on W Flamingo and Durango. I noticed the ""Bowl"" and thought it might have been another new Poké ""Bowl"" place that is the latest food trend in Vegas and many of the western states.  Or a retro hair salon featuring vintage ""Bowl"" cuts that some of us sported in the 70s and 80s. Thank heaven it is actually a trendy Asian fusion restaurant and not the latter.

Bowl Tique Avenue actually have their menu on the BeyondMenu App, which I was prompted to download when I tried to look at what they offered.  Pretty high tech and it is the first business that I know that accepts Apple Pay (which Yelp has been asking about for awhile when I check in to businesses).

So while I pulled over about two giant blocks down the door and studying their menu, I decided to give them a try and also test drive the BeyondMenu App.  The ordering process is super easy, just select the item and the quantity and add it to the cart. If your total reach a certain threshold for using their online coupon on BeyondMenu, the app will prompt you for the option to use it.  Very user friendly!!!

The Chinese cooks (possibly the users) were preparing my order of their Signature Fried Rice, side orders of Grilled Chicken Thigh and Pork Tenderloin. As a young Caucasian waitstaff greeted me and handed me one of the menu, which he explained has additional coupons that is not on the BeyondMenu App.  I also learned that the very modern and clean restaurant that sports an open kitchen design just opened last Sunday, so they are pretty much off the radar being in business for just 6 days.

As I was planning to watch a few episodes of HGTV's Fixer Upper, I had my order to go, and payment was done when I placed the order through the app. But the restaurant decor is very pleasant and the dining room fairly large, that I would enjoy dining in the next time I am in the mood for a different kind of Chinese take out.

The fried rice I ordered was very large. Easily enough to share between two adults with normal appetite. The Grilled Chicken was prepared nicely and seasoned just right and would totally be the perfect lazy way to meal prep you of your proteins.  The Pork Tenderloin appeared to be prepared Chinese style with velveting of the meat, so it is tender and moist.

Overall I thought the guest service experience is very good. Immediately after handing my to go order the young waitstaff headed for the exit to open the door and wish me a pleasant evening (simple courteous gestures that are very typical of traditional Japanese restaurants), which I have yet to experience at any Chinese takeout restaurants.

The food was good, nothing fancy, but certainly hit the spot twice over. Being so close to where I live, I will likely head back and give other menu items a try (like their noodles or fried pork cutlet).
