Chances are you will not stop in unless you have a doctor's appointment upstairs, but it's a nice little pit stop for breakfast or lunch during business hours pre or post medical visit.  The menu posted is a bit outdated since some of the offerings are not actually available (i.e. waffles and pizza).

4 star items:
Illy coffee in their coffee/expresso drinks
Greek chicken salad with a well-balanced balsamic vinaigrette
Panini sandwiches 
Soup of the day (if available)

3 star items:
Gyros and philly cheesesteaks are made to order; however, something seems off regarding the condiments since the yogurt sauce is bland and the cheesesteak uses meat prepackaged from the freezer.  Not bad but nowhere near authentic if your expectations are too high.

Croissants and bagels come out of a plastic bag so likely purchased from secondary vendor.

Free wifi, very pleasant and hard-working couple (and son) running the counter.",syA7uYoDjohc7gWBWaEZmw,12,11,4,H2HrOQsHgGmxH-CbA1POpQ

Usually there's a lady working the cash register and making food by herself. She asks for 10 minutes to make your food but sometimes she makes it quicker than that. She has a variety of the dominant foods on her menu: sandwiches and salads. She offers a combo, $8.65 with tax if you order a drink & a sandwich/ salad. You initially order and once you're given the food you pay or if you're eating in the cafè you pay after you're finished eating there. I really love the Philly Cheese Steak sandwich! I tried the Steak & Blue Salad for $7.65 with tax but it wasn't as fulfilling as I thought I'd be. The sandwiches here are definitely amazing and the lady working by herself is great!",80qYPp6Fk_jmO3334DKGGg,0,1,4,tnt97IhiQjAfy99egd9Hgg
