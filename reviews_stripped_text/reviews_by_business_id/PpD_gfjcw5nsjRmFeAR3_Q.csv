58808,2012-03-21,0,PpD_gfjcw5nsjRmFeAR3_Q,A group of friends and I recently went to go visit Nanay.. the food was good esp. the Bistek and Sinigang but it was all good really. You can't beat the price. We went at an off time about 5pm on Saturday. We were the only ones in the restaurant. When we left business was picking up quite well. The only downfall was Nanay kinda came back with us in a way and when she tried to leave us it was through our Glori-holes. I'd go back again but those who have a refined palate may pass.,8IImIY6OIKzGQhmkk4zb2w,1,0,3,XOAaXK9Q8j1t8TyI_BxRqA
61799,2012-05-03,0,PpD_gfjcw5nsjRmFeAR3_Q,"I really want to impress on readers how this restaurant has gone downhill within the last couple of years.  Nanay Gloria's on Maryland Parkway used to be a good deal for your dollar, but things have changed, and I feel, it's to save money as much as possible.  Firstly, if you have children between the ages of 1-3 years old, they will be charged.  It doesn't sound like a lot--$1.99, but more respectable buffet eateries don't usually subscribe to such practices.  Still, they didn't use to do this.  Secondly, they've gotten rid of trays.  Yes, trays.  This is a cafeteria style buffet line, and you are expected to fill your plate and carry it to your table by hand.  That means multiple trips back to get water and your silverware.  God forbid that you happen to be carrying soup...and with a kid in tow.  Talk about an accident waiting to happen.  I honestly feel they got rid of the trays to discourage customers from filling their plates.  I actually asked them why they got rid of them, and no one could give me a decent answer.  But, trays are just practical at any eatery, and I strongly condemn this restaurant for  getting rid of them.  I've always liked their kare-kare (ox-tail and tripe in a peanuty broth) which is always complemented by a sauteed shrimp paste (known as ginisang bagoong).  I remember how I used to love their sauteed shrimp paste.  Now, it tastes as if the shrimp paste is coming straight from the jar without being sauteed.  The pancit was left wanting, as it was more noodle than anything.  There were big chunks of the ""rootier"" parts of the cabbage--not the leafy part, and it left the dish tasting too bitter.   Their curried chicken at the time I dined there, had veggies that were undercooked, and I happened to scoop up the chicken's neckbone, which, in my opinion, wasn't going to do a ravenous diner any favors.  Do they expect that I'll be sucking on a length of neckbone just to lap up the last bits of curry?  If they want to add it for flavoring, they should remove it prior to serving.  The dessert items are very limited.  They always have a hot dessert on the food line, but the selection of fruits and other sweets were very limited.  Trying to sit down to a clean table was almost impossible.  Even the cleanest table that we were at felt sticky to the touch.  They need to not only remove dishes, but they need to really wipe down their tables (and chairs) better.  In all, I think Nanay Gloria's likes to rely on the reputation it had in the past.  As a local here, I can honestly say that customers are better off eating elsewhere.  I am no longer impressed.",YgzjhRYTQXyOMFXHYG_2RQ,2,0,1,t3wdGouv1u8VkX9o-oJUcw

501639,2007-05-11,2,PpD_gfjcw5nsjRmFeAR3_Q,"I am so embarrassed!  I saw the awesome review for the Nanay Gloria's on Spring Mountain (over here:    http://www.yelp.com/biz/Ta4GRuHyZvU5H_l5IAG1PQ) and couldn't wait to try it.  I pass by a ""Nanay Gloria's"" on Maryland Pkwy pretty regularly and thought the two places were related, so I decided to try it today.  

It looks like there is supposed to be a little market on the left side, but it was closed, so I couldn't check it out.

Based on the reviews for the other place, I don't think there is any possible way these two Nanay Gloria's are related.  This Nanay Gloria's was the standard steam-table counter place, where you can order a 2 or 3 item plate with rice.  I had:

- lechon paksiw: chunks of roasted pork with crispy skin - pretty fatty, but not bad
- fried bangus: milkfish -  very dry 
- kare kare: peanut butter stew - was not made out of the traditional oxtails, but with huge chunks of mystery fat and bone (possibly beef neckbones?).  Had very little flavor.
- beefsteak: Philipino style with onions - swimming in grease and pretty flavorless
- garlic fried rice - tasty in a really greasy sorta way
- Coke in a can - the best part of my meal :)

I have been feeling so sluggish and nasty all day because of all the grease and fat I consumed at lunch today.  I have been to quite a few Philipino places in Las Vegas and I can honestly say this has been the worst so far.  With Goldilocks just across one street, and Sarili Atin and DJ's across the other street, there are plenty of more flavorful and less greasy choices for Philipino fare.  I can honestly say I will never go back to this Nanay Gloria's LOL.  But I still want to try the other one!",E7sk9jsImePqLT4roNgotg,4,0,1,v9ANmFUcK6HSvbp44i55DQ

Their area is more open and the place definitely looks much nicer and cleaner than before.  Nanay Gloria's still offers an all-you-can-eat option but they also do 2 or 3 entree combo plates which COULD be more value to you.  AYCE costs $9.99 now but they also wanted to charge my four year old $5 and my one year old $2.  They don't even eat a quarter of a plate of food combined.  

We opted to order ala carte, two of their two-entree combos for $7 each.  We received a ton of rice and some noodles and we had four different filipino dishes which all were very reminiscent to our home cooking.   That means very delicious.  We had almost as much food as we would have ate with the ayce option but saved more money.

Our choices for entrees were:  
1) Sisig - Chopped up fried pork, onions, bell peppers.  
2) Menudo - Pork stew with carrots and potatoes.
3) Beef Caldereta - beef & veggie stew (carrots, bell peppers, in tomato-base sauce)
4) Sinigang - Pork belly in a clear sour soup broth.

Drinks are extra and I'd recommend getting a can of soda or bottled water.  The free water they offer from their water dispenser is fine but their bucket of ice is left out in the open and not dispensed through any ice machine.  Can't say I can trust it that much.   With that said, I'd come back here for the food whenever I'm on this side of town.

They had a lot of different options, but I chose the ones I was more familiar with like pancit, fried chicken, kare kare (my fav, but my mom's is still the best!), sinigang, and lots and LOTS of sisig. I know it wasn't the most healthy choice, but this is Vegas and I would pay the $7 just to eat a plate of sisig. 

I took my Vietnamese friend here and even he had more than 3 plates of food. Along with the halo-halo, I would say my $7 was well spent. I will definitely be coming back next time I'm in the city.

For dessert, they have maja blanca and fresh fruits.

From the sound of it, we had too much to eat!

Be sure to call the restaurant for directions.  If you use the google map, it might lead you to a different restaurant.  Parking is accessible.

Im not sure if they still charge extra $1 if you use a credit card to pay the bill.  Bring cash.

It looks way cleaner and I love the openness of the restaurant. It was great before, but felt a bit hole-in-the-wall-ish.

Any buffet below $10 makes me feel guilty and Nanay Gloria does just that. Where else can you go and eat all your favorite filipino comfort foods at an affordable price? Plus the food is delicious, replenished often, and kept very clean. I feel guilty eating here, like maybe I shouldn't eat so much but they have soooo much food and many options to choose from.

Dinuguan, kare-kare, calderetta, adobo, fried chicken, lechon kawali, tocino, fried fish, lumpia, pinakbet, pancit, mechado, bistek ""beef steak"", chicken tinola, and they have either the typical recipe or other variances for example the many ""tamarind soup"" dishes like pork sinigang, fish sinigang, sinampalukang manok which are all ""sort of the same but different"" lol. They have the sauces to accompany everything, vinegar, bagoong, mang tomas lechon sauce, banana ketchup, etc. 

Drinks and other specialties items cost extra but they have some sweet items included in the buffet if you need some ""dessert"" for example, fruit, ginataan mais, maja blanca.

I actually prefer to let my food sit for hours (especially in the fridge), so that the flavors can intertwine even more. If you prefer fresh food, I'd say come when they open or around lunchtime.

Anyways, they have a HUGE selection of all the best Filipino dishes & some that I have never tried before. You seriously can't beat this all-you-can-eat buffet for ONLY $7.99. Sure the place looks a little run down, but it was CLEAN & SANITARY. The bus boy is quick to take away your used dishes, and the lady behind the counter makes sure you're satisfied while you're there.

I've eaten Filipino food all my life, and I can cook some dishes. So I can say that their dishes are QUALITY & bursting with FLAVOR. You know how some buffets that are also cheap prepare their foods in a cheap, watered-down manner? Well, this place doesn't. Their dishes are authentic & quality, and you really get WAY MORE than you pay for.

Oh & btw, their sago gulaman is BOMB, & it's ONLY $1.50!! YUM!

I highly recommend this place. They even have a huge flat screen with TFC playing, so you can watch TV as you eat. Great place to bring your family or even to eat alone!

The food was good. Extremely greasy, but good. I've always considered Filipino food to be the Mexican food of Asia. Greasy and always makes you want to take a nap afterward. There were many dishes I've never had before, but luckily I had a couple of my good friends who are Filipino help me out in describing to me what I was eating. 

With each crispy-fatty bite I felt my taste buds heightened to a new level. The food was actually good! The lechon had crack sprinkled on top which is the reason I couldn't stop eating it. I tried not to fill up on too much rice so I could try everything else. There were 2 different types of curries. I'm sorry I don't know the proper names, but one was pork and the other beef. Both well seasoned and tasty.

The healthiest thing I consumed while during my Filipino cuisine were probably the 2 cans of Coke. $1 for each can I may add. So my buffet meal came out to under $10. Not bad right? Would I come here again? Sure I would, but first I'd have to have an angioplasty to clean out my arteries from the first time I came.

The employees didn't look very happy and weren't very helpful, but that could be the Las Vegas heat. The menu indicates you could either do two and three entree option or just buffet. My group and I ended up being charged for the buffet option even though we didn't want that, but like I mentioned before, it was very confusing. Fortunately, it was only a $2 difference between three entree and buffet. I ended up getting the bistec and beef kaldereta. Wish I skipped the bistec as it was really tough, but the kaldereta was so tender and delicious. I should have loaded my plate up on that instead. My family had the pork adobo, kare kare, fried chicken, and pork bbq. The only complaints I heard was the kare kare didn't have any oxtail and was overly peanut buttery and then my tough bistec. 

So big question, when I'm in town, would I eat here again? Probably not, but only because there are other places with similar set up that I'd like to try before I would decide to visit again. 

Note: There are no labels on the food so if you aren't familiar with Filipino food, you won't know what items are unless you ask. Hopefully, the employees will be more friendly.",Ga-6Uui8JfyY_kNbOR5Bmg,0,0,3,obKoGRPdnjEhuRTQfHquFA

5218267,2010-04-29,12,PpD_gfjcw5nsjRmFeAR3_Q,"For Filipino buffet, this place gave us a great first impression.  But after a few more visits, we noticed that the quality of some of their dishes were just average.

One star goes to a pretty good selection of authentic dishes for only $7.  There's about 25 dishes that include Pancit, Chicken Tinola, Lechon Kawali, Laing, Kare Kare, and Crispy Bangus.  The standouts were their Sinagang na Salmon, Adobo with skinless chicken/pork, and their colorful and spicy sisig with bell peppers and crispy pork skin.  
But don't expect to see a large dessert selection in this buffet.  Only Ginitaan and some fruit were available during our visits.

I'll give them another star for having Mang Tomas (A popular Filipino all-purpose sauce used for lechon and other roasts) and Jufran banana sauce available at EVERY TABLE.  Speaking of tables, this place is cleaner than most other Filipino buffet joints I've been to.  

Their unlimited Fried Chicken SKIN (another standout buffet dish) deserves one star by itself.  Where else would you find hoards of crispy chicken skin?  Sadly, or not, I can eat this crunchy goodness like popcorn.  It's not good for you, but hell....whatever happens in Vegas.....right?",KOWl_ZhqhYqY33-CbaJubw,14,11,3,GcQA6JrNZSO3l2k-YgG4Sg

If you're not Filipino, but you're dating someone who is, this can also be the place for you. Or if your friends are the Filipino ones, or if you just like chicken adobo, honestly, a good place for you all. 

It's an all-you-can-eat self-serve buffet style. My favorite dishes were the chicken adobo, pork sinigang, and the deeeelicious warm rice pudding type of dish. So filling, flavorful, and hearty!!!",wFMJ5riyTmtupUnkZIM8vA,0,0,4,Z_AzSijbqmWpt56-eKmbog

There aren't a lot of people and the place isn't really decorated but hell, the place is cheap. That's all I care about.  We had to-go because we were ready to go back to our hotel. The woman that put our food together I think was rather tired that day so she made a mistake by putting the wrong kind of soup in our to-go box.  Oh well. I'm not really picky.

The seafood platter is legit whole fish, not boned, anything. It ended up in the trash because nobody tried any of it and it was REALLY pungent. Come to think of it, it's what the restaurant smells like. I question how fresh the fish was to begin with.

The beef steak in oil is my favorite. Delicious. Also, the Tibok-Tibok (coconut pudding) was delicious. The pancit and mini lumpia were also good. 

Most of the food that was ordered was good, but I wouldn't order the fish.",OLn8EvPsu4hNug8V5PF2jA,2,2,3,twZGJ9DyholaOxg_qnPetQ
5740302,2017-06-23,0,PpD_gfjcw5nsjRmFeAR3_Q,"The positives: I think the food is authentic--for example, there are no labels, which makes me figure that most people who come here know what the items are, and since they know what they are, they probably are actually something that Filipinos eat. The fact that they also sell balut also points toward authenticity. Sadly, I am not a Filipino food expert. Also, the service is very friendly, and an older woman working behind the line explained several things. Some of the dishes--particularly a somewhat sweet one with either baby squid or baby octopus--were tasty. It's also quite affordable.

The negatives: the place isn't as clean as I'd like it to be. They had a section for water but the containers were all empty, which is particularly problematic for a Vegas summer day. Some of the dishes were less than remarkable. Particularly, a dish with carrots had such large slices of carrots that they were a bit undercooked and difficult to eat.

Overall: This is in the category of 'restaurants I would like to like more than I did.' I think they have a niche for low-cost Filipino food. But it's not a place that I'd race back to go to.",YE54kKTuqJJPNYWIKIpOEQ,1,0,3,8a4B1mYE-_lbtSnhMN7qbQ
