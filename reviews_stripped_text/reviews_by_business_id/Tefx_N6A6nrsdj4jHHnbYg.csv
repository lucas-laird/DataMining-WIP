Nice decor, friendly and helpful staff, and nicely presented food selections greet you as you walk in.  I had a ham & cheese croissant, a latte, and a lemon cupcake for lunch.  The croissant came with a very small salad.  My lunch impressed with great flavor, fresh ingredients, nice presentation - was brought to my table on a tray by the woman who waited on me, more like a nice restaurant than a neighborhood coffee shop.  One of the nicest small places I've been to in Las Vegas.  Good food with class!  Loved it.",_dweOMEVk1SjvfTvEkt7Qw,1,1,5,Epddp8uWWCTCRPuGptlt-A

I had an extremely pleasant and delicious experience.  Enjoyed fresh (so fresh the french press was brought to my table to press and pour myself) delicious green tea and an apple brie almond salad.  I was a little bit skeptical of the combination of ingredients in the salad but after one bite I was hooked!  The brie wasn't too strong and the julienne'd apples complemented the bitterness of the greens perfectly.   The food was brought out promptly, I didn't even have time to peek completely through one of the many vogue magazines set out in front of two comfortable chairs.  

The ambiance is wonderful, great soft jazz playing in the background, nice varied seating options and perfectly simple little decorations.

Pleasantly surprised at this delightful little cafe, where the ladies working there were almost as, if not more pleasant than the place itself.

Was immediately greeted by staff and asked if I wanted to view the menu during my short wait to order. I opted for the chicken pesto sandwich and a salted caramel cookie. The sandwich was delicious and made panini style with mozzarella and roasted red peppers. The side salad was made with a lovely shallot vinaigrette. My only complaint was that the side salad could have been a bit larger, as it was so delicious. The salted caramel cookie was chewy and soft and a great treat.

Had the cinnamon & sugar crepe and French press coffee while my daughter had the croque monsieur. Food was tasty but portions were smaller than expected. Also bought some pastries to go and highly recommend the almond croissant. My only complaint is that they charge extra for creamer with my coffee which I think should have been mentioned before ringing up. Otherwise, just include it with the price of the coffee so people won't feel like they're being nickel and dimed. Asked for a to- go cup for my coffee since it was good for a few servings but left the cup on my table by accident. Went right back after 15 minutes and the staff had tossed it out.

I am one lucky girl to dine here with a Yelp friend.  Lauren and I had big appetites.  We split the Croque Madame, Quiche Lorraine and Apple Cinnamon Crepe.  It was all a delight.  

The Croque Madame had a rich a flavorful bite.  It is a lovely presentation with the side salad.  The Quiche Lorraine was no slouch.  It was light and fluffy with a delicate crust.  It was also a beautiful plate with the salad served on the side.  The Crepe hit every taste bud.  The sweet and savory crepe was filled with green apples wrapped in a fresh crepe.  Not to mention the fresh cream certainly complimented the sprinkling of cinnamon and sugar.  It is very indulgent.  

When you think we're done, you thought wrong.  They have fresh pastries calling our name.  The Salted caramel cookie is so perfect that I wish I would've taken some home.  There is a delicious balance of the caramel/cookie.  And if you like caramel, don't pass up the salted caramel cupcake.  Moist and decadent.  There was definitely a lot of flavor packed into a mini cupcake.  

It was my first try of a lavender cake.  I guess it was just too much lavender flavor for me.  The cake itself was light and moist.  Like I said, just a bit too much lavender for me.  

The wonderful ladies here are so welcoming and friendly.  I love the first rate customer service they offer.  They make your visit comfortable which is why I'm hoping I'll be back soon.  Thank you for an amazing experience.",xhhE0txKwQtRzgQVVdKkvg,15,10,5,BiAB90-j_EKt0slkqdaDEQ

To eat I had the chicken salad sandwich on a baguette and damn, the bread was perfect! Sometimes a baguette will be so crispy outside that it cuts your gums when you take a bite, but this was firm on the outside and french-bread chewy on the inside. The salad itself was perfectly seasoned and the grapes gave it just the right sweetness.

La Petit Cafe on the outside looks like an unaware sandwich shop right off the highway, but walking in it becomes a quaint, French, lunch destination spot.  Although the location is spotty with cars whizzing by and office buildings surrounding, the Cafe and Bakery holds its own.  The inside has about 10 tables a couch area for lounging.  There are also about 5 smaller tables outdoors when the weather is nice.  Once you order, the server will bring the food out to you, but you more or less will clean up your self.  When I went, it seemed a little understaffed, so it was it took a little longer than I had hoped for my meal to come out - about 25 minutes.

The menu has a nice selection of your French lunch classics like crepes, baguette sandwiches, croque madames, and quiche.  They also some great coffee and complimentary water as needed.  I tried a very good ham and cheese sandwich with an added egg.  The meal came with a very small salad, though more tasty and better looking than your typical house salad, with beets and a side of fresh fruit.  The baguette was fantastic and the added egg made for a more formidable dish.  

La Petit is a very nice lunch destination in the area.  My meal came to a little less than $10 for the sandwich meal, but with my work nearby, and an outdoor area suitable for a dog or just to enjoy the weather. I will be back.",JaqcCU3nxReTW2cBLHounA,1,1,4,bP4Zu0zQT32Bnq89gHZcpA

3517556,2017-08-28,3,Tefx_N6A6nrsdj4jHHnbYg,"Their out-of-the-way location probably doesn't draw many passerby's, no doubt relying on traffic from the nearby hospital and office parks. But, it's a spot worth visiting if you're in the area

Their bread pudding looked small as it arrived at the table, but was filling. Served warm, the center was soft and soaked through with custard. The top was drizzled with caramel and also came with a side of whipped cream. Cookies were excellent. Their chocolate chip cookie was soft and chewy through the center with some crispness around the edges. The salted caramel was even better. So chewy and chock full of caramel. They could have dialed back the salt, but it still provided a nice contrast to the sweetness of the other components. 

For a savory option, you can't go wrong with the roast beef au jus sandwich ($7.95). While it is a little small, the roast beef and au jus make for a magical combination. It also came with a side salad.

The least impressive item I've tried was their almond croissant. Soft, thick, and doughy don't make for good croissant qualities. Thankfully, there are plenty of other reasons to dine here.

Pastries we're fresh and perfectly flaky. 

My kids were given mini chinos. Basically foam but in fancy cups! That's was really nice and unexpected. Not to mention it kept their hands out of my foam!

The shop is located near 215/ Sunset in a corporate area. There is plenty of parking and the location is easy to access. The inside of the shop is very cute with a large couch and cute tables. It's obvious that care was given in the details of the decorating and design of the shop. I really enjoyed the ambiance. The staff was welcoming and friendly. That definitely added to the warm, fuzzy feeling of the dining experience.

Bethany E. found this cute bakery and we made plans to meet up for a Saturday lunch. What a lunch it was! We like to order several items and share so that we can try a variety of items. 

Croque Madame- like a croque monsieur, but with a fried egg on top and served with a small green salad and a slice of cantaloupe. The amount of flavor in this was amazing. The bread was tasty and the ham had a nice flavor and crisp to it (I'm not normally even big on ham). The cheese on this dish really made the overall flavor pop. Loved this item.

Quiche Lorraine- a modest slice of quiche with a small green salad and a slice of cantaloupe. The quiche had a lovely richness to it and a perfectly flaky crust. I also loved this dish.

Apple, Cinnamon, Caramel, & Sugar Crepe- this was one of the larger items that we ordered. Good thing since it tasted amazing. The crepe was perfectly light and delicious. The caramel and green apple inside were perfection with the delicious crepe. I absolutely recommend this item as well.

Lavender Cake- this was really packed with lavender. I enjoy lavender treats, but this was a little heavy on the lavender for me. The cake itself was moist and the frosting on the cake was tasty too. 

Raspberry Macaron- perfect flavor and texture. I enjoyed this and would love to try more flavors in the future.

Salted Caramel Cupcake- a stand out for sure. We decided that anything with caramel here is going to be the best. This was the type of dessert that stops you in your tracks with its incredible flavor.

Chocolate Cupcake- very good with a nice moist cake and a frosting that tasted like it had a hint of mocha.

Salted Caramel Cookie- one of my favorites of the desserts we tried. It had a bit of chewiness with a slight crisp. The caramel really made this dessert amazing.

Ordered an iced coffee and a slice of cake to share. That day it happened to be a nutella cake according to the girl working up front. 
Customer service was decent; no complaints there. However, our ""Nutella"" cake, did not taste like Nutella at all. It tasted no different than a basic buttercream frosting chocolate cake from the local grocery store, quite disappointing.

Staff are generally friendly, except for the owner.  She is not always polite and her mood permeates through the vibe or the cafe and the staff.  We have seen her lose her patience with guests who ask questions about the baked goods.  Speaking of baked goods, they run a lean shop here so lots of times the pastries on the menu are not actually in stock.

General cleaniness is good here, with some occasional misses of stains on tables, just request a wipe down or do it yourself with a wet napkin.  The condiments bar is always well stocked.

I had the berries crepe and that was accompanied with homemade Chantilly cream.  It was probably one of the best Chantilly cream I've ever had and I've had plenty.  Unlike most, their Chantilly is airy but not too airy.  It's the perfect balance between the texture and substance. You'll have to try it to understand it.  They use fresh berries and a compote in the crepe.  Each bite with a dab of cream, and it was heavenly.

My companion had the ham and cheese crepe.  It came with a side of house salad.  The ham and cheese crepe was pretty good but I preferred my berries crepe.  The side salad was pretty amazing.  Just by looking at it, you'd think it's just some simple mixed green with diced tomatoes.  But upon further detailed examination, it had diced beets of different colors and bell peppers.  I think the dressing is homemade, too.  

They don't have regular dripped coffee, which I guess is what to be expected at cafes such as this one.  My Americano was perfectly brewed and energized me the way I expect my coffee to.

Here, it's a super cute inspired French decor and cuisine.  My husband is French and he asked if the chef here was French.  They said they're not.  Their accent sounds British maybe?  I was able to go on their site and it states ""Inspired by France.""  

The staffs are friendly.  It was quite busy when we came in for late lunch on a Monday.  I would say we were there about 2-3PM.  We placed our order and sat down.  It took a while until we gotten our food.  We didn't get our food until 30-45 minutes afterwards.  It looked like there were only 3 staffs working.  I have to say, there isn't an urgency to get food out to people.  They're all super relaxed.  I would have to say, please speed up the service.  We did end up seeing there were a lot of takeout orders before us.  Must had been why the service was so slow.  But then I'm thinking how long does it take to basically warm up the quiche that's already pre-made and to slice a piece of bread and add some ham and cheese and toast it.  Slap on some side salad.  (Then again, service in France is like this, slow, no urgency whatsoever. LOL)  

We ordered two Croque Monsieur, Quiche Lorraine, and Ham & Swiss Crepe.  The Corque Monsieur had a lot of flavor, wish it would be 2 pieces of bread and not only one.  It's a bit small dish.  The Quiche Lorraine was well done, we love the texture and the flavor of the dish. 
 The ham & swiss crepe was good, they do need a new recipe for the crepe itself.  It's a bit too plain and it was melting in with the ham and swiss.   

We'll have to come back and try their pastries, possible faster service.

The thing that bothered me the most was that they don't play French music. The music sounded like normal cafe music so that didn't make sense to me.

I usually go to Maggie's Creperie or Patisserie Mannon as they are close by and I know the menu.
So when I was invited here to Le Petit my friend said ""they have the best Quiche and I have to try.

So we ventured out, ordered Quiche Loraine which was had the norm, bacon, cheese and it was yummy, I have to say not the best but was creamy and good.
I did only have 2 bites so I will try just quiche on another visit.
We also ordered the Turkey, apple and Brie on a croissant and the French dip on baguette, both sandwiches came with a small side salad.

I ordered he turkey and my friend the French dip, we ended up exchanging through the meal as the Drench dip had so much flavor and was in my opinion the reason I will give this place another try.

The turkey sandwich was good but the pesto was only on half the sandwich and call me strange but I feel that spring mix should be in a salad not on a sandwich.  It just was good.

I don't know if it was a filling meal or I didn't enjoy it as much as I wanted as I only ate half of what I ordered. (I guess that could be a good thing ;))

The croissant it was made with was delicious

As per suggestions from other yelpers, we tried the salted caramel cookie which was Devine! A nice crunch and very tasty... it was a big cookie and I could only eat about half at a time but a nice little treat for later.

Will give it another try sometime and update from there

The atmosphere was fun and made you feel like you were in another French cafe...

Newly opened on Medical Center Street, two-doors down from Tipsy Coffee house with high ceilings and decorating that is best described as Paris-by-way-of-Ikea, le petit café & bakery looks to continue a recent trend of great baked goods on both sides of The Valley, a recent visit showing that the restaurant has a long way to go if they wish to compare favorably.

Visited early on Saturday, the doors already open with the manager, baker and two staff present at 8:40am, even though the internet seems to indicate they do not open until 9 o' clock on this day, it was to cheerful faces and pleasant service that the group greeted patrons from behind a countertop, items still rolling out of the oven as questions were addressed, words such as ""authentic"" seemingly misplaced for a case of outsourced Gelato flavors while a menu of desserts listed overhead were reported as ""not ready yet.""

Finding a seat after placing the order, a total of $16.00 exchanged for seven tastes including a complimentary Ginger Snap, the choice to start with a pair of Danishes was made because the choices were still warm from the oven, the pocket of Strawberry tasting of good Jam juxtaposing Butter while the version described as Lemon was, in fact, Peach - and questionably the soggy sort straight from a can.

Moving on to the Turnover, described as ""Caramel Apple"" on the menu but more like Motts Applesauce in flavor with a bit more texture from diced Fruit, the Almond Croissant proved to be nothing short of disastrous, prompting one local Chef to ask ""Is that a Biscuit?"" when he saw a picture of it, the flavor thankfully natural though the lamination was poor while the whole thing certainly would have seen a bit of moisture as a benefit.

Ending on a high note, the Salty Caramel Cookie sort of like a Sugar Cookie with crunchy ribbons coursing through its crumb as large chunks of Dark Chocolate Chip riddled its counterpart, it was in noting that neither the Croissant nor the Turnover had been completed that the manager asked if a box was needed, a response that the former was far too dry leading to the suggestion that I might want a ""fresh one to-go"" leading to assumptions about what had actually been offered...and not much interest in making a return.

** One year ago le petit café & bakery would have been another average choice amidst many substandard Bakeries in town, but with the launch of Rosallie on the West, CRAFTkitchen on the East as well as the improved quality elsewhere there is very little reason to visit this place when better can be found just a few minutes away.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,11,5,2,OJgICnZcvXfChEQpf_2RmQ

We got the roast beef au jus and chocolate croissant. The sandwich was good, but the chocolate croissant was AMAZING! I would definitely recommend trying it. They also have plain butter croissants and almond croissants. If you have diet restrictions, they do their best to accommodate them! Great place.",FXzWdW9brueJdOwx20cveQ,3,2,5,rZO_6dzfmhPvp8tm3OlLUQ

I had the Turkey, Apple, & Brie Sandwich that was really good. Looks like they have a good selection of teas, which I want to try next time. The owner(I think she is), is super sweet and helpful!",NjH-xt6JV-d-IyEL4Y7P7Q,0,0,5,UHvJq2RTxNQyTWgj7Xo1XQ

Tasted good and they didn't take too long to make. Place is clean and had a very French feel to it. The 2 girls working were nice and made us feel very welcomed.

5705582,2017-08-04,0,Tefx_N6A6nrsdj4jHHnbYg,Been wanting to try this french inspired cafe/bakery.  The decor is cute inside.  The coffee was nothing special...a bit weak.  The croissant was rather expensive compared to other french bakeries I have tried.  The croissant was just okay.  Staff was friendly.,QdPY0W7WIgBZrzRuL1lZMA,0,0,3,HDt-2OEdVjBQYL3RjZADRA

The latte was solid, not the best I have had but enjoyable. I was disappointed that outlets were scarce, but that was about the only setback. Definitely a place to check out.",YE54kKTuqJJPNYWIKIpOEQ,0,0,4,QpagApRhexGv4h8cTtY1Ww

This little cafe is set right off the 2-15W and Sunset, in a medical office plaza. It's right before Southern Hills Hospital.

My favorite item on the menu is their Croque Monsieur Sandwich which is ham and cheese (at least that's what I think, haha). They usually serve it on a baguette, BUT I asked if it could be done on a croissant and they happily obliged! I'm not sure if salad and a cantaloupe is served with all their meals, but their sandwiches do. This place also serves macarons and other French desserts.

As far as decor goes, this place had such a quaint and home-like vibe that reminded me of Paris so much. I started reminiscing about our recent trip to Europe.

I've definitely been back more than once and plan to keep it that way! 

Merci Le Petite Cafe for the delicious food.",VhkjxxBz-A4M-mMncpn1ZA,4,4,5,nWaQM_-c7zsreOTny2a6tw

They serve coffee, pastries, crepes, salads and sandwiches. They even have soy milk for those nondairy people. I love their soy vanilla macchiato. I'd def go back! Great place to meet for coffee and chat.",fzubFD1Op9Mvtlbr4P7n1w,0,0,5,Gdo9NYwKkr04AjyKX0iq-g

I've had the quiche and crepe here, both of which are tasty and high quality. The quiche usually comes with a side salad and piece of fruit, which makes a nice lite lunch meal. The best thing here is the fresh squeezed OJ! What a treat :) 

Overall, love the cute interior and the service is solid! Would recommend for lunch if you're by this spot!",cQU8IWVEJYcklBJbW9CzdQ,0,0,4,5r8cXGiYABHwKHH4xHnJDQ

The music, the decor, the furnishings, all lend themselves beautifully to this place. I am looking forward to sampling the different food offerings, as I've seen the deliciousness that others have enjoyed! The chocolate mint tea is my new favorite, as much as I am a coffee lover. And the personality plus of the ladies working there is delightful! The location in the southwest part of Las Vegas makes this quite convenient as well for travelers of the 215 freeway in that area!

I love whatever vegetarian quiche they are serving up (my faves are the asparagus mushroom and broccoli/cheddar/potato). Their matcha tea is made with real matcha, milk, and sweetened with a little bit of caramel. It is amazing! Last week when I was in, they were cutting a banana salted caramel cake. I decided to take a slice home and share it with the man after dinner. I figured I ought to try it and make sure it was okay, so after lunch I had a bite. Then another. Then before I knew it, my half was gone. Before he got home from work, his half was also gone and the evidence had been destroyed. I will definitely be going back for TWO slices next time they have that cake! Seriously, though, everything on the menu is good, so you really can't go wrong here.",u5r53zerLzYfDymhtmZlUA,0,0,5,IDBaukzB251VVVDIZzJNjA
