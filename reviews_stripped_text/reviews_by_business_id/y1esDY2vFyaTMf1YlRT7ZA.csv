I gave them a high 4 star for the combination of food choice, quality, and customer service... on this day there were on point. The customer service were attentive, friendly and made us feel like we weren't being rushed out.

It's a shame, but those willing to walk a little bit into the shopping center and go up to the second level will find possibly the best pizza joint in the entire city.

La Bella Napoli has absolutely delicious Neapolitan-style pizza.  Tried the All You Can Eat lunch special for $13.85.  Every pie was delicious.  Really good quality mozzarella.  Probably the best Margherita I've ever had.

La Bella house salad was also delicious, nice candied walnuts and tasty parma ham.  Fresh greens and tangy balsamic vinegar that wasn't overpowering.  A nice complement to the pizza.

Tiramisu for desert was also spectacular, rich and creamy but not overly sweet like most I've had.

Myself and a friend found this place at Town Square across from the movie theater on the 2nd level. It has a patio which overlooks the grass courtyard. 

I have yet to find pizza that compares to my childhood NY favorites but this ranks among the best in Las Vegas. It 's on par with Pizza Rock and is far better than Metro in my opinion. 

Personally I had a 4 cheese pizza with pineapples added and my friend had one with lots of meat. Do you ever find yourself eating a meal that is just too good to waste with idle chatter? You just dig in and don't allow for interruptions until you are done? This was that.  

Our service was also outstanding. The waitress was very friendly and helpful. She gave us the perfect amount of attention. Before we left she made us aware of all the weekly specials and invited us back.

We also had their Fritto Calamari & Scampi app and shared La Bella salads, for a meal that left us absolutely stuffed.

The pizza was the highlight, with a great crust. As others have remarked, this is cut in an odd way with only two slices, so we had to hack and tear at it a bit. Flavors were solid though, would order another pizza in this style. The salads were super fresh and flavorful, with just the right amount of dressing that it was evenly distributed without being in a puddle.

We met up during lunch time so it wasn't busy at all.  The service was good and attentive.  Our food was out very quickly.  Luckily for us we were ready to eat it up.  We started with the Fritto Calamari & Scampi appetizer.  This large and in charge app was great for sharing.  The calamari and shrimp were lightly battered.  The giant martini glass that is was served in made for a pleasant presentation.

I also tried the La Bella Salad.  This had great potential.  The ingredients of buffalo mozzarella, parma ham, cherry tomatoes & walnuts were indeed fresh but I felt it had a little too much balsamic vinegar for my taste.  Next time I would order the dressing on the side.

For the main event we shared the Australian Open Rachetta - a pizza with a handle!  I fell in love with the ingredients of mozzarella, arugula, basil, parma ham, tomatoes and parmesan.  The cherry on top had to be the stuffed handle filled with ricotta, provola and parmesan.  Great pizza.

Our first choice was Brio because we had eaten there many times before and they have patio seating. However there were no reservations available and at least a 30 minute wait to get in. We walked up to La Bella Napoli. We were able to get a reservation there for a table out on the patio. It was an absolutely gorgeous afternoon and the patio was a perfect setting with an absolutely lovely view. Rachel, our server, came by almost immediately to take our drink order.  Many of the yelp reviews raved about the pizzas but we decided To be a little bit more health-conscious and go with the salad rather than one of the specialty pizzas. The chef salad for $15 was huge and we were easily able to share. It was loaded with all of the usual ingredients of a chef salad.

The service, atmosphere, and food were fine.  The happy hour wine prices were OK. My partner suggested that the served wine was old and had been opened a while.

My issue is that a not very strong double scotch/rocks cost $22. The server suggested the double. I asked the server about the price on the ticket and got sort of a shrug. I think this is gouging to the max. 

If you are careful about ordering and ask for the prices on everything before ordering, a pleasant time can be experienced.

When we arrived we were greeted and seated promptly!! The waitress asked us if we were told about a pizza sampler explained it then took our drink orders, she came back with our drinks and then took our order. As we were waiting for our food which was served rather quickly much appreciated since we were on our lunch break... we heard another waitress telling the table next to us about the specials so when our server came back to the table with the bread( which was a bit on the older stale side) we asked oh could you tell us about the daily special she started with the price so we were not sure if because we were using the BOGO she thought we couldn't afford it or that is her normal way of opening. Never the less the food came out pretty promptly after that nice sized portions my selection was good I had the Ragu which was a meat sauce with rigatoni the sauce was not to acidic but not sweet I enjoyed the meal and only ate about half of it and brought the rest home. Now the person I went with she ordered the Al Sugo it had more sauce then pasta literally it was swimming in the sauce she ordered the meatball for the additional $3.00 and for $3.00 you would think she would have received at least 2 or 3 of them since it was on the small size however the menu is specific and says Meatball not Meatballs.

With that said I am not sure i would revisit although my meal was not bad I would have to say had it not been a BOGO I would not have selected this as my first choice for a lunch... lunches to me should be around the $10 mark for the most part unless I am going to an actual 5 star venue!!!",O_wy2pt3OLfBQFaCls_N_A,0,0,3,pzTK8kMKjZdrb2jJTUEzcg

2668560,2016-05-21,5,y1esDY2vFyaTMf1YlRT7ZA,"Our experience here was average at best.  We were greeted and seated promptly upon arrival but we quickly asked to change tables when their air conditioner blew gusts of cold air right on top of us.  So stay away from the windowed areas would be my first tip.

We were currently having lunch during happy hour so we ordered the Italian Trio of the limited happy hour menu items.  It consisted of cold dishes of marinated zucchini, sauteed mushrooms, and caponata.  I asked two servers what caponata was and they could not describe it at all.  They said it was ""capers, mixed with other things"".   I looked it up just now and it's eggplant and celery seasoned usually with sweetened vinegar, capers, in a sweet and sour sauce.  I don't typically like to eat eggplant and I would have not ordered this if I received an accurate description.  The entire dish was okay but the bread that came along with this was hard and difficult to bite.  

My wife and I had the Chef pizza while my daughter had a typical cheese pizza that she enjoyed.  Our Chef pizza was a thin pizza topped with parmesan slices, basil, red cherry tomatoes, olive oil, arugula, parma ham, and buffalo mozzarella and light with the tomato sauce.  While the main portion of the pizza was soft and foldable, towards the crust it was a tough and bland.  The buffalo mozzarella was small, the ham a bit sparse and not consistent among the slices.  An average slice but not quite to par with a cheaper and yet tastier Settebello's. 

Service was friendly.  Attentive, but maybe a tad bit much.  Our server asked us how everything was before we even started to try our food and then asked how everything was twice more within the next 5 minutes.   Maybe that's nitpicking but sometimes I just want to enjoy the company of who I am dining with but with the peace of mind that I can find my server when needed.

Overall, a decent option for pizza in Townsquare to compete with those offered by nearby restaurants.  This is definitely the most authentic 'Italian' style pizza in the area if that is what you are craving for.

**2017 Yelp 100 Challenge # 15**
.
This restaurant is located on the second floor in the heart of town square right above coffee bean! The patio looks over the little kids park & the fake green grass area which makes a nice view for people watching. 

The staff here are SUPER FRIENDLY & they do an AMAZING job making sure you are accommodated from the bussers to the bartenders. I would have to say a couple of the times we went to dine in .... the hostesses were the LEAST FRIENDLY like they hated their job & was forced to be there or something =/

The food is HOT & FRESH every time we have eaten there!! Their HAPPY HOUR items are LIMITED but they are sooooooo DERICIOUS! 

LA BELLA FAMOUS CHICKEN WINGS $12.85 - these are also on HAPPY HOUR which I think is only like $7 But they come tossed in parmesan sauce that is just SO ADDICTING!! 

COXINHA TRIO $12.85 - I freaken LOVE this simple deep fried croquette stuffed w/ chicken, veggies, meat & cheese served w/ their special sauce BUT I much prefer it w/ ranch
 
LA BELLA SALAD $9.00 - thin slices of ham w/ buffalo mozzarella, arugula, cherry tomato, mixed greens, basil, candied walnut, olive oil, & balsamic vinegar 

PORCINI PIZZA $14.85 - I may have to say this pizza was LACKING the porcini taste which is what I was desperately CRAVING 

SUPER CARMELA $16.85 - CHEESY overloaded goodness. You can really taste the nice smokyness from the woodfire oven baked into the pizza & the pesto flavor comes out from the stuffed crust!!
  
TIRAMISU $6.95 - OMG the flavors are just POPPIN!! It's not too watery like most places seem to do which I don't like but it was a perfect amount of moisture. 

NUTELLA CALZONE - can't emeber the price for this but it was on a special. It was delicious but I will have to say it is different since it was a lot of dough compared to an actual dessert like a crepe but it was FUN to try!",x-8ZMKKNycT3782Kqf9loA,5,4,4,t6ijjJoVeyOhxmrbAAHm5Q

I Love what the Town Square folks have brought to the Las Vegas community, great shopping, entertainment, and fantastic restaurants!  La Bella is now my ""go to"" for Sea bass!  The dish is called Branzino and it is a light olive oil based sauce served with capers, olives and cherry tomatoes, man oh my and the buttery, fluffy, flavourful  mashed potatoes were on point!  Our server was Laurel and she was wonderful! The ceaser salad was tasty, with fresh crispy romaine, the Syrah wine was awesome and finally, the bread was light and perfect, tasted fresh made and I enjoyed the balsamic and oil with herbs!  I will definitely return for the fish again but I really want to try some of their other seafood offerings like the al mare and the shrimp diavola. I also might add that my friend and I have very small appetites so we split everything and left stuffed!  I'm sure if I didn't have a salad and bread first I would of easily polished off that sea bass!!  Thank you for a warm, comfortable dining experience!  I alsmost forgot to mention the view!

My first experience at La Bella Napoli Pizzeria was really good, so I decided to bring a group of friends so that they could also give this place a try. I made a reservation for my party and we were seated upon arrival. They have tables inside as well outside on the back patio. The woman working up front was very welcoming and full of smiles as she seated us, but the owner didn't give us the same welcoming vibe. On my first visit he went around to all of the tables saying hello and checking to make sure everything was good including my table where he turned on heat lamps for us since it was a chilly night and we were on the patio. On my second visit he did the same to the other tables, but not ours. Instead the owner stood off to the side glaring at us it was bizarre. One of my friends wanted to change her seat so she wasn't facing him lol. The girl who took our order was very nice however she could have paid better attention when it came to refilling our drinks. 

Italian Trio ($5.42 HH price) - Roasted peppers and sauteed mushrooms with crostini. The peppers and mushrooms were good, but the bread was very hard. It could have broke glass. 

Ciccio Boc ($13.85) - Red tomato sauce, red cherry tomatoes, sliced Parmesan, olive oil, arugula and small mozzarella balls. As if those toppings weren't sounding good enough to me, I noticed this pizza is made with a ricotta stuffed crust, yum! The crust had just the right amount of blistering and the bottom crust held the toppings well. The ricotta stuffed crust tasted really good. This is a pizza I'd order again and recommend to others. 

Quattro Formaggi ($14.85) - Tomato sauce, Mozzarella, Provola, Parmesan and Gorgonzola cheeses. I found the Gorgonzola to be extremely overpowering and it added a strong smokey flavor I just couldn't handle. I'd order this again and adjust the type of cheese they put on it since they weren't shy at all with making the pizza nice and cheesy. The crust was on point also.   

Australian Open aka Rachetta ($17.85) - This pizza is shaped like a tennis racket that is complete with a cheese filled handle. You read that right, cheese filled handle! The handle is filled with Ricotta, Provola and Parmesan. The toppings are red sauce, red cherry tomatoes, arugula, Parmesan, olive oil, basil, Parma ham and mozzarella balls. This pizza is what you should try at least once and they currently have 5 different rachettas to choose from on the menu. The toppings tastes fresh and all complimented each other well. Now the downside.... The pizza was only sliced half way so that 2 pieces could be pulled away and they didn't finish cutting the rest making it a bit hard for us all to get a decent slice without tearing it all apart. The handle absolutely needed more cheese inside it! I was a bit bummed when we cracked open the handle and it was mostly empty with just some cheeses from the pizza outside of the handle that spilled over during baking. 

Dominic Diavola ($13.85) - Tomato sauce, hot coppola, roasted sweet peppers, hot peppers, mozzarella, Parmesan, olive oil and fresh cracked pepper. This is listed in big bold letters on the menu that's it's spicy. While everyone at my table really enjoyed this pizza, most of us found it not to be spicy, but rather have great flavor from the combination of toppings without a huge kick to our taste buds.  

Tiramisu ($8.85) - Decent size and tasted great. Perfect ending to the meal. 

When it came time for the bill I became a bit uncomfortable. We had a Groupon and the server said the owners don't allow her to take the printed paper voucher and can only accept it if you give them your log in and password info for Groupon so they can redeem it that way. That is just ridiculous! No joke this server pulled out her personal cel phone and said to put in my info. I refused to do that and even with the really shitty cel signal at Town Square I was able to get Groupon open on my phone where I told her she can mark it redeemed in front of me there, not on her phone or any other employee. I saw her go over the the owner and talk to him about it, and he seemed not happy, but allowed me to do it that way. Nobody should ever be giving out personal passwords and log in info like that and they shouldn't offer a Groupon if they aren't going to honor it the ways it's intended.  

They have an all you can eat buffet from 11 am - 2 pm on Fridays for $13.85 which is worth checking out. Out on the back patio they have misters in the summertime and heat lamps in the winter. La Bella Napoli Pizzeria is located upstairs in Town Square.",Fv0e9RIV9jw5TX3ctA1WbA,73,69,4,Cna_kZC8RVw-Yc8vyBI2Hw

The menu looked enticing and sexy per my reseach and Yelp investigation. We discovered it is located on the 2nd floor (Key Information because it is in a center) in Town Square, directly adjacent to the Blue Martini.

We started off with the Sicilian Chicken Soup which was absolutely flawless and amazing. Perfectly seasoned and full of flavor. We also ordered  Chicken Picatta which was very good. The chicken was great but the noodles could have been a tad more cooked they were a bit to firm but other than that it was perfect sauce and all. The Salmon which Spinach was a little larger than expected and the sauce was Sooooooo good. It was definitely a must order. Perfect texture with an amazing crunch on the edges of the salmon. 

Groupon usually never steers me wrong lol and once again helped me find a gem. Big Shout out to our waitress Mary Lynn (I think that was her name) who was super friendly and helpful. Ask for the Puerto Rican waitress she will talk you death lol but she has a sweet personality and cares about her customers which was much appreciated. I would reccomend sitting outside so you can enjoy the fresh air and view of trees etc. Sorry we didn't try the pizza which was getting all the love in others reviews but I can eat pizza all day back home in NY/NJ lol",Ishvcor7iAYRMgCr1odT9Q,6,5,4,A2rra33LtssDwLYoXeuJCw

They also got it done in a just a few minutes. Then the manager took care of our dessert which was really not necessary but we thought was excellent of him to have offered as a gesture of keeping customers happy.

They always try to accommodate us when we request to sit on one of their patios because our little one can walk around and not bother anyone. Plus he loves watching his favorite train from the balcony.

Luckily, the pizza maker guy (I forgot his name--Axel maybe?) made up for the hostess and waitress' mistakes at the end with a delicious pizza and rachetta as well as a complimentary strawberry nutella dessert pizza.

Walked in around 3:30 on a Saturday afternoon and there was no hostess or anyone at the front. Walked to the dining area and they seemed somewhat annoyed/surprised to see us. Asked if they were open and if we could sit.

The hostess was lounging on a bench near the bar. When we walked in, she looked like a customer hanging out drinking by the bar and the only reason we realized she was the hostess later was because she moved up front to the hostess station by the time we left.

We placed our order for a rachetta and a pizza. Simple enough, right? We were the only 2 customers / 1 table in the restaurant and our server managed to forget the rachetta somehow. I can't imagine how service would be during even a remotely busy time considering she can miss 1 out of 2 things ordered when you're the only table in the restaurant. We get the pizza pretty quick but after waiting another 15 minutes, it was clear they forgot the rachetta as it didn't look like it was being made...",adu81e3xgx5t4G_QSFM37w,0,0,4,KEAF2je1DdsNfFJDpepHbQ

I had to roll my pizza slice into the crust because the bottom was so soggy I couldn't even lift it into my mouth. 

Really disappointing for a $16 pizza.

This place is done up and looks very nice but it's professionally decorated to make up for the mediocre food they serve.

Portions are small, bland, and boring. Way too pricey. Personally won't be coming back.

If you want to impress a date there are other places to go to that give you more bang for your buck with the same ritzy atmosphere.

Hopefully the quality of the dishes improves. I know this place is new and we were at a big group table, so I'm trying to keep that in mind. But this place is not off to a great start. Just FYI.",AYmNw7TCkGcvHfoQKzTFVg,2,0,3,aMh4o0wTtC_-rC2afmXY6A

Authentic, delicious and welcoming in every way, LBN is making some of the best neapolitan pizza on Las Vegas Blvd (that was for all of you pretend-New Yorkers who think Secret Pizza is the bomb). 

They have a gorgeous pizza oven that was brought in from Napoli and craned up to the second floor, where the restaurant is located, in the middle of the night so as not to disrupt Town Square business. Now that's commitment!!!

The owner and his chef-wife are warm and caring. 
Geraldo, one of the waiters there, is completely dedicated to making your experience a memorable one.

Our waitress was attentive and came to check in on us throughout dinner. She recommended the baked ziti, which we tried. 

The food is OMG! They Boc pizza is a must try and has ricotta stuffed crust. The best part of the pizza is the sauce IMO! It's so light and fresh! But eat the pizza fast because it has a thin crust and will get soggy fast. Baked ziti had a great flavor. Definitely vey filling. Hubby and I killed the pizza and left about 1/5 of the ziti.

If only we could tip the chef. Gerardo (our server) seemed rushed, uninterested in being there, and had zero personality. Guests at resturants want to at least feel welcomed. Don't get me wrong maybe he had a bad day or had personal stuff going on, but don't bring your issues to work with you and give people that are spending money and helping to pay your bills bad service. Ever! My husband is in the hospitality industry in town which makes it that he is aware that good service is highly important. Good service deserves good tips.

The best part was that I needed to print email, I asked Marie Ann if she could help, she talked to yeh owner of the restaurant, who was having lunch at that precise moment, his name is Adriano, who was kind enough to pause his lunch so he can print my email.

SERVICE: 4/5
Some servers are more knowledgable than others, and one in particular was just plain forgetful. But they have always, always been super friendly.

AMBIANCE: 5/5
I looove the ambiance of this place. Definitely recommend the patio in good weather, and I always appreciate the twinkly lights and that moood lighting during dinner. Perfect place for date night or a lunch date!

FOOD: 4/5

Pastas I've tried ranked from best to meh:

1) Fettuccine Alfredo with shrimp: 5/5
- perfectly creamy and cheesy
- pasta really shines through in this dish

2) Funghi Porcini: 4/5
- for mushroom lovers
- heavy on the cheese, BUT
- the tagliatelle is awesome

3) Linguini alle Vongole: 3.5/5
- for garlic lovers
- if you're in the mood for seafood
- if you want to avoid cream, but don't mind butter/oil
- pasta isn't really the star in this dish

Pizzas: 4/5
I've tried the Margherita and the Super Carmela. Both pizzas use quality ingredients, have a great crust, and solid tasty flavors.

Tiramisu: 4/5 
Definitely recommend for all the coffee lovers out there.


OVERALL: 4/5
Overall, I definitely recommend this place if you're around the area and craving fresh pasta or good pizza. This place is relatively new, so I've never had to wait to be seated.
