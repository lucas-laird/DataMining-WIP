We gave them 4 stars, because overall they are wonderful. However, beware because they do have their bad nights. 

Tonight, we both ordered cups of clam chowder and one came out filled to the top and the other was way below the rim.

Then our chicken sandwich came out uncooked!!! We sent it back and the manager was nice enough to come out and offer us more food & dessert on him.

I have had the tomato bisque before and it was really good. Tonight, it wasn't good. I was very disappointed, because I LOVE tomato/tomato bisque soup.

We definitely wanted to note that they have very good service. When you ask for a box, they do it for you instead of giving you a box to do it yourself. They even write the date and what food is inside of the box in the corner! Little things like that really do make a difference.",_5i-gReOmEts7CLmnZXZ6A,0,0,4,0NxdU8IzjZhvwv9hq_w68g

When we get to the entrance of the Yard House, we saw people walk in and out, and some of people were just gathering in front of the entrance. This restaurant was very busy that it took us about half an hour to get a seat. We sat in the restaurant booth, which is about 8ft from the bar. The design of the dinning room is pretty. The room is dark, but very comfortable. I ordered the small size Penne with Chicken, which is in the House Favorite category. My friend ordered the small size BBQ Chicken Salad. Even though the restaurant was very busy, the service was very fast. It took only about 10 minutes for the dishes to be served. In the Penne with Chicken, the penne was nicely mixed with the asparagus, mushrooms, tomato, and cheese, and it also looked glossy. The size of the dish was about 12 to 16oz. The smell of the dishes is very good that it is not too strong but mild. The penne was smooth and a little bit creamy; it was slippery in the mouth. The chicken was tender, and its flavor was salty, a little acid, and creamy. The acid flavor of the tomato was balanced with the marsala cream sauce. The BBQ Chicken salad had a very fresh smell and bright colors. The fried onion had a weaker smell than the no fried one, and it was well mixed with other greens. The texture of the salad was crispy and moist. Because avocado, tomato, beans, corn, cilantro, and pasilla were included in this dish, it had flavor of salty, sweet, acid, and spicy. The chicken of the salad had a little burnt taste. The size of the salad is big that we did not finish it even though the one we order was a small size.

The food is always very good, although the atmosphere can be annoying sometimes with the insanely huge singles crowd simply there to drink and look for a date. My only pet peeve about this spot is that they don't have any type of call ahead seating or reservations, so if you go on Friday or Saturday, expect to wait at least an hour for a table. Something like that just bothers me, I don't care if you want to take a credit card to hold a reservation like the high end joints do here in Vegas, but at least give us the option of reserving a table!

I wasn't sure where I was at because I was hungover but i quickly was filled with excitement and joy. It doesn't get much better than those three things for a man. 

We went here for lunch and the hostess asked us which game we wanted to watch because they seat you where the specific game is being played on their plethora of TVs. They usually try to get you in a spot so you can view most of the games.

We all got burgers and everyone seemed to like them. My mouth was watering from all of those taps behind the bar but my brain was saying no go. My liver would just have to wait until next time to try all of that deliciousness. The waitresses were nice, friendly, and funny and made the experience that much better.

My order did come out a little later then the rest of my party but I didn't really mind cause I've had something to drink and some appetizers.  Lisa did notice that my food wasn't out yet right when we were about to ask her.

She came out with my food and it was warm, it would have tasted better hot. I didn't make a big deal out of it as she was accommodating and apologized. She asked if I wanted to have them make another one but of course I didn't want to wait again when everyone is almost done so I said it was fine.  She insisted she'll get the GM as that wasn't ok.  The GM came out apologized, and asked if I wanted anything else and I said no. She also comp'd the meal.

128516,2013-03-13,0,A5Rkh7UymKm0_Rxm9K2PJw,"This is gonna sound like a recurring theme, but I came here for a friend's birthday dinner. Not sure about the other Yard House locations, but this place is GIGANTIC. Ample indoor and outdoor seating with enough TVs to watch any and every sports game.

With their burgers, Asian influenced fare, pastas, and Gardein selections, their menu has something for everyone and it's just a matter of deciding what you want most. Eventually, I settled on a surf and turf burger, which has a beef patty topped with lobster, grilled asparagus, and a swiss and tomato béarnaise. The burger was all right, but I should've gone with my gut instinct and ordered the pepper jack burger. I dipped my fries into the béarnaise instead of putting it on my burger. Oops. Let me just say that I'm just a sucker for crisp fries and savory dipping sauces.

Figured I might as well get a drink since I could walk it off around Town Square. One hpnotini for me please! It's a balanced mix of pineapple juice, pineapple rum, hpnotiq, and vodka. Basically, sweet + fruity + alcohol = girly drink. I'd drink it again, but I'd want to try their Snake Bite, the birthday guy's favorite, before making repeat orders.

Even with about 20 or more people in our group, the wait staff never stopped being accommodating, patient, and attentive. Major kudos to them for being amazing to us despite having a full house on a Saturday night.

The reason I come to a restaurant is to eat and maybe have a chat with the person I'm sitting next to. If I want loud, blaring music I'll go to a club. Don't try to do both. Minus one.

Now, on to the food, which is actually quite good.

Seared Ahi Sashimi - It was fresh, but too much black pepper around the edges for me. I also didn't care for the heavy vinaigrette it was sitting in.
Fried Calamari - Pretty good although I'd like more rings and fewer squid tentacles, thanks.
Classic Sliders - Very traditional sliders, not bad. Fries are awesome.
Grilled Korean BBQ Beef - Tasted very authentic, just as good as any Korean restaurant.
Spinach Cheese Dip - Not the best I've ever had, but then again how can you mess up spinach dip?
Linguini & Clams - I loved this dish. Clams were fresh and the sauce was tasty.
Draft Beer - A+

The service was just ok. Our waitress did the bare minimum necessary to keep us happy. I agree the best time to come here is during happy hour. Any other time it's just way overpriced. I mean, $10 for eggrolls, really? Minus two.

Will I be back? Yes, but probably only during happy hour and I would recommend you give it a try if you haven't been here before.",BCjrY4emoG1yyjhO17WdWg,0,0,3,rFnURnYQkjzUYjJ1-frFag

The first time, things went okay. It was a weekend, but an off-hour, so the place wasn't very busy. Service was fine. Food was pretty good.

The latest time, it was an entirely different story. My sister and I decided to go there and ended up being there at the same time as a wedding reception. Not a big deal; we choose to sit outside under the heater and enjoy the early evening weather. My sister gets a beer, I get a soda, standard stuff. Service is slow, but not terrible.

Then we order.

My sister and I eventually run out of conversation topics. I get a refill after a long wait, she gets another beer. I look down at my phone and it's been basically half an hour since we ordered -- WTF? No information at all.

Eventually our server finally tells us what happened -- My sister's food got picked up by someone and given to the wedding reception guests!! They have had to start her order over entirely. Two refills and another half hour later, they finally bring it out.

My food is luke-warm and uninspiring, while hers is okay. It is nothing to write home about, especially for the price paid. We ask if we are getting any sort of consolation for having to wait over an hour for our food.

The manager decides that the employee discount is fine, which amounts to /less than one of the beers/ off of our ticket (which had two meals, two beers, and one drink). For having to wait nearly an hour for what we ordered. I could understand if there was some complaining, like ""Oh, our order came out on time but there was some trivial thing wrong"", but this was entirely on them, both the delay in telling us what happened and the delay in fixing it.

Not going back again. The slow service, overpriced and under-delivered food, and insanely lame fix for their mess up put me off forever. There are better places to go without wandering through Town Square.",r8Jxvy_BuRAz8JnrotoB2Q,1,0,1,C-golBoReus3dc2Jw1kY0w

Very expensive if it's not happy hour,
Crowded and quite slow service, it's good food and you probably won't be disappointed but there are a lot of places for the same price where you will have a larger selection of food and a more relaxing experience... If your at town square try Brios, if your at red rock hotel try Lucilles smokehouse. The yard house needs to lower their prices , they think they are the only good food joint in town. They better be careful, this is Las Vegas not Grand Rapids, MI... There is serious competition here,
I predict the redrock Yardhouse will start to lose biz because of the new Lucille's ,
Only thing that will save them is to offer
More specials. 

Another thing is their bartenders are typical

My friends and I went here after they finished their finals week. There is usually a line to get in, but it's only because they are checking IDs and giving you wristbands. The bouncers are pretty friendly, no elitism at this joint, no cover like at Blue Martini which is just upstairs.

Drinks: I seriously think they sell the cheapest drinks at Vegas. I was able to get vodka tonics for just $5 each...seriously? I can get 3 for the price of ONE as compared to one of the pricey clubs on the strip. I didn't really eat a meal here, but I did nibble on my friend's bbq chicken salad, which was delicious. The alcohol I drank induced french fry cravings, so my friend and I split an order of their fries. The fries weren't the big thick fries you get normally, but they were still really good with ketchup and ranch dressing. The wait staff are very attentive and friendly, also very accommodating. We were in a large group on Friday, and they are not allowed to give separate checks, but she had no problem giving me one.

My only gripe about this place is that the music is REALLY loud as it gets later into the night and you have to basically shout across the table to hold any kind of conversation. It's also nearly impossible to find parking around Town Square on Fri and Sat nights, but I guess that comes with the territory. Also, it's kind of hard to walk in and get a table at peak hours, so I would recommend making a reservation for a larger group.

If you are looking for a good place to chill with friends, AND cheap cheap cheap drinks, this is DEFINITELY the place to go.",ZzfT6gVliP7hVKX7mH6oEw,1,1,5,F8WcSCZKYaJF6CXsSvayJw

This location is in Town Square right next to Rave Motion Pictures, so instead of paying $20 for popcorn and soda, stop by Yardhouse and get a real meal!  You can go there just about anytime and have some great appetizers, entree's or dessert!  It's usually busy at night any time on the weekend so get there early.

The service is usually a toss up...but this particular time it was unmatched!!  My husband and I just left the Town Square location, and our server's name was Seth.  Let me just say, incredible experience!!  He showed up to our table within seconds.  He had a huge smile on his face, and it actually seemed genuine.  There were some new menu items that had been added since our last visit, Seth knew about all of the new items.  He answered all of our questions without skipping a beat.  Best part about it...he didn't seem annoyed at all.  He was very pleasant and informative.  

Our food arrived very quickly and was just as delicious as always.  Seth came back to check on us a few times, but we had nothing but great things to say.  He never let our drinks get less than half full, and he anticipated our needs like a true professional!!

Everyone knows that Yard House has great food and a great happy hour.  I decided to write this five star review because I'm sure that not everyone knows how fantastic Seth's service is!!  My husband and I were so happy that we were seated in his section, especially when we saw most of the other servers.

For parents of little ones, Yard House is a Go-To place with kids because it's okay to be a little loud inside - the entire restaurant is LOUD!  A good loud - because it's hopping with business!  

My visit last night gets 4 stars instead of 5 because the service was considerably slow.  The restaurant was full, like always, but the service seemed much slower than ever.  That being said, this place never dissapoints me.  

Visited Yard House last night (Friday night around 6:00pm) for drinks and dinner with friends.  Wonderful time with great food and great beer!

I tried a new dish last night and it was YUMMY!  The Chicken Tinga tacos rock!!  But be ready - they are SPICY!  When a beer restaurant can make some of the best tacos in town, you know you are in a special place!   The mexican rice and beans are excellent as well!  It was one of my favorite meals I've had at Yard House - and I've probably had about 25.  I paired my meal with their House Belgium Trippel Ale - which was very good!  

The children's menu is very good as well.  We ordered the Mac-N-Cheese for the kiddo, with a side of fruit, and it comes with a drink and an ice-cream dessert for $6.95.  A little on the pricey side of Kids Menus, but the food is top quality kids food!

Moving on, the shrimp dish was excellent! The rice had a lot of flavors and the sauce they had for the shrimp was a wee spicy..yum!

The food was great, but the service was reeally slow... We probably waited 20 minutes to get our drinks and we got to switch waitress twice. One in the party ordered an app for main, but got it to the table pre main, so he ended up eating before us.

Had to remind our server about a missing appetizer. Never checked on us or followed up on drinks, by the time he came around we weren't thirsty anymore.
Fast forward to the sales transaction....server acknowledged two credit cards and repeated to us that he was going to split the check. Server comes back with only one credit card to which the entire check was charged. After minutes of flagging down our server we told him that only one card was charged and one card was missing he quickly took the check back and walked back to the registers. Minutes pass and he returns again now with both cards with split checks and said that the missing card was declined so that's why he didn't bring it back the first time. Dumbfounded, we then brought to his attention that one card was now charged twice (I verified through my online bank app) and his explanation for the other card missing for five minutes during the transaction is extremely suspicious and made no sense. We demanded to speak to a manager and the manager cited that it was busy and there was just a mix up on the registers. To add insult to injury he then tried to diffuse the situation/appease us by offering $5 gift cards! Wow! What we wanted was an explanation for the missing card and a guarantee that we wouldn't get charged three, four, five times for bad service. We walked away with his business card, which we had to ask for and an insincere apology from our server.

$8.95 for 6 small glasses of beers from San Francisco - Alaska.

It was good.
Food Looked great. I didn't eat. Just there to check it out. Hard to tell who wasn't on business in the crowd due to all of the credit card purchases (or debit maybe?). Suspect though there were locals.

Nice room. BIG! Screens everywhere with piped in Vid's. Music, I heard Foghat, Alice Cooper, and......lost track.

Good crowd. 20's -30's. It was Saturday night.

It's on the South side of Town Square (near the Airport). Just behind Guitar Center & Rave Motion Pictures.

Food looked Great!! Prices? Didn't look.

Yard House. Get's it's name from the Yard tall glasses you can get a beer in. Looks like a hassle to me.

Definitely hopping place!!

First trip I ordered the half order jambalaya, second trip the seared ahi tuna sandwich on rye.  

It's hard to make a good jambalaya that isn't too salty, most are, and the YH hit it on the head.  The shrimp were large, and sat on top a cup plateau of rice, with the chicken, crawfish, and sausage in a moat of spicy cream sauce around.  Some of the best jambalaya I've had and would certainly order again.

The second round was the ahi tuna sandwich.  I was a little suspect out the gate with it coming on rye, but had a little trust from the last trip and how great the jambalaya was.  As the plate sat down, I could tell the ahi tuna was not seared to rare, but more of a medium well, cooked white with only traces of pink, bummer.  Hoping the toasted rye bread would compliment the meat and somewhat pickup where it left off, it didn't, and just made the sandwich more difficult to handle, literally.  On the upside, the peppercorn aioli and caramelized onions saved the sandwich from a certain fate in the back kitchen's garbage can.  Normally, I would have sent it back, but I was with my boss for dinner and decided to suck it up rather than act like a food snob for ""overcooking cooking my ahi tuna"", not a good look.

This place is pricey, perhaps over priced in some respect, but if they can pull off all their dishes as well as they did the jambalaya, I'll come back for not just the beer.",9A13fSGgOh5Y40rdRUKMpQ,0,0,4,i8wgCQaRPkRKAbYjxK9w9w

This is a great place to get lunch if you have some extra time during your lunch break or if its your day off.  Pretty mellow atmosphere during the day, gets pretty busy during the evenings.  

Before our friend arrived we told the waitress that it was her birthday and asked if at some point towards the end of the meal we could get some kind of little birthday dessert brought out. She delivered on that towards the end of the meal, no charge.    She was a great waitress in every other aspect of our meal as well.  Made it such a great experience.

The food was pretty good as well, especially the lettuce wraps. There were no complaints from anyone at the table about the food, there was praise all around.  Best part was it was a pretty cheap meal for 3 people, at least cheaper than i expected it to be and that's always a pleasant surprise.

When it first opened friends constantly wanted to dine here and my wallet cringed as well as my patience as we jammed up against the bar waiting for our table. Once you get past that however, the place is quality. The portions are big and no one can complain about the beer selection (unless, like me, you await the arrival of Yuengling to the west coast, I check every time I go). They have a great selection of food so everyone in the party will be able to find something they're in the mood for. Yard House reminds me of Cheesecake Factory, but substitute cake for beer. The lunch specials are very fairly priced and will fill you up.

The outdoor seating is awesome in the still bearable months of summer and at night prepare to see some sights sashaying over to nearby Blue ""wait this isn't Tao?"" Martini. Good times all around. There are TV's everywhere in this joint, including outdoors, so you won't miss a pass, kick or homerun. Overall I recommend but if you're going for dinner, have a snack before you leave the house to hold you over.",B7mqXzrSFKM_Wff2tbBagw,0,0,3,zTMqw5yuhLmuY7jSg6HKuw

It seems like the Vegas douchebags and  whores like to pre-game at Yard House before they go to Blue Martini. It's filled with drunk college kids and people who get sloppy. The service is terrible on the weekends at the bar, you almost have to throw something at a bartender to get service. The food is great though. Honestly, I have never had a bad plate of food from there. It is a little pricey for a bar I will say. They have a huge list of beer available on tap and it can be a nice place to go to if you don't go at the already pre-specified times by another reviewer. It's basically a less fancy pick up bar on the weekends for college kids. If you want to get loud and rowdy, this is the place to go on Friday and Saturday.

Happy hour is M-F 3-6 PM, and Sun-Wed 10PM-1AM where a lot of their dishes are in the $5-8 range and drinks are even more reasonably priced.

I always go with friends and try a variety of their dishes. Their ahi poke bowl is decent although there are probably better poke places around Vegas, but it's decent for a bar. Thei fried calamari is always on point. I can never complain about good calamari. I've tried some of their lettuce wraps and they're all pretty good. If you're watching your sodium intake, some of their seasoned meats can tip you over the edge if you're not careful.

They have a wide selection of drinks available and I have a good time trying out different brews.

Their staff is friendly and mostly attentive although they can become forgetful if business becomes busy. However their staff should take their breaks away from public since some of their staff become rowdy when on break in front of the restaurant.

The table he was told to put me at wasn't ideal for me..sorry but I'm short and I don't want to see at a lower booth. So with out hesitation he placed me in a better spot.

Once she arrived he gave us just enough time to look over the menu so that we could enjoy the happy hour!

And if you still aren't convinced, imagine big delicious portions and an amazingly generous happy hour menu. Two friends and I recently enjoyed a late evening dining experience: Chicken Nachos, Margherita Pizza, Bernaise Sliders, Tomato Bisque, 2 beers and a martini = under $50 with tip. 

Great atmosphere and plenty of TVs for those who want less conversation and more game time. When the weather is nice, grab a seat outdoors and enjoy some people watching. Even when the weather isn't so nice (just for a few short months in Las Vegas) there are conveniently located outdoor heaters, as in they are out of your way and you won't burn yourself after stumbling out because you sampled all 150 beers.

To my not-so-crazy-about-beer-people: take it from someone who doesn't care for beer. Do you like juice? Carbonation perhaps? I highly recommend giving the Lidemans Framboise or Strawberry Fruli a try. I promise you won't even notice its beer. If that doesn't work out Yardhouse has a great selection of mixed drinks and martinis. Try the Gobbstopper Martini or the Black Orchid Martini.

During their happy hour, they offer a bunch of specials such as $2 select drinks and half of select appetizers and pizzas, can't go wrong! My friends and I will normally come between classes for a huuuuge plate of their chicken nachos during happy hour.

Needless to say, Yard House takes the cake on food and service in my book.",I70jgmMpKH7qgqr9va28Og,0,0,5,siBpHikPcWw8SDBbzcc7Mg

I ordered the lettuce wraps and the bug was clearly on display in the middle of one of my pieces of lettuce. I understand that lettuce is susceptible to bugs.

The menus were tossed at us and the bartender walked away. It wasn't until we asked someone to help us did we get served . After we finally ordered our lunch and the meal came out it was wrong . After we had the wrong order sent back it was returned cold ! When we let them know the food was old and we didn't have time to wait any longer the server informed a manager and she walked right past us cussing and complaining !!!!!! I am in the service industry and it seriously takes a lot for me to complain or even get on Yelp and write a review but someone who is in management should lead by example! This was absolutely disgusting the way we were treated ! If management can treat guest that way than all employees at this establishment can and that is a disgrace . If you hate your job leave !

My favorite snack food here are their Truffle Fries. They fry their shoestring french fries to perfection, tossing them in a combination of truffle and garlic flavors. I get it every time I come here! My favorite appetizer would be their Wisconsin Fried Cheese Curds; they are accompanied by two sauces, one is a creamy, toned-down horseradish sauce and the other is a spicy-honey sauce. They bread the cheese curds lightly enough that it does not drown out the cheese. As for entrees, I enjoy their chicken tenders (which are perfectly crispy on the outside and moist and juicy on the inside), their mac and cheeses (which has the perfect amount of cheesy gooey-ness and is balanced by bacon pieces throughout), and their penne with chicken (that has tender pieces of chicken and is accompanied by crisp pieces of asparagus, giving an extra crunch to the dish).

For their beverages, they have a wide selection of cocktails and beers. I enjoy their more fruity beers, where my go to is the Timmerman Strawberry. Cherry Wheat is also a great choice!

Overall, I really enjoy the atmosphere of all Yard House locations and their food never disappoints. And if you can get their during happy hour, it makes it that much better!",FQbVI3UyKlL-HfQGcRF8aA,3,2,5,lJF018j7o45OrJTNwB1N5Q

The service here is superb! We ordered a Hefe-weizen and they said it would take a minute to switch taps. We got it right away. To have a local place that has German beer on tap is pretty awesome.

The food is fantastic too, I've never had a bad dish. On my last visit, we shared the Queso dip. It was pretty ooey-gooey and very delish. I think it needed more chips though, we kind of ran out and started piling on the queso towards the end.  I think I heard my arteries screaming ""For the love of God, not all at once! "" 

For my main dish, I ordered the miso sea bass with bokchoy and brown rice. I'm a huge fan of miso fish dishes after trying the miso cod at Nobu in 2009. So the miso sea bass at YH is one of my favorites. The sweetness and the freshness of the fish was impressive.

Between California and Nevada, I have eaten at this restaurant at least a few dozen times, and general eat the same few options. Getting to the point, upon arrival of the main course, i saw a dark piece of something poking out of the breading of my chicken fingers. Considering I eat these almost every time I eat at Yardhouse, dismantling deemed appropriate. I pulled the breading off and discovered a cockroach /bug type wing and a limb on an insect. The food runner was notified of the incident, and attempted to take the plate back. I denied him, took a photo and requested a manager. The manager (Beau Boskey) assured me it was cabbage, but also denied eating it upon request. At this point, he offered to take that dish off the bill, and shrugged off the entire situation as a misunderstanding. He entirely discrediting my opinion, and I'm a collector of  scientific insect displays. Kind of ironic. Our server came over and apologized about the whole situation. We understood it wasn't her fault, but did let her know that the manager handled the situation wrong(she was tipped). She apparently notified him of my dissatisfaction and conversation of taking this to his upper management/corporate. After Beau, the manager, caught word, he decided to retract his original offer and comp the whole meal. This attempt to appease me was an appropriate gesture, a bit late and an obvious back step. Overall, this restaurant experience will never be forgotten... in a bad way. .........By the way... I looked up deep fried cabbage on google image search and my photo looks very different. gross. 
3/22/13 Update- I was recently offered a free meal and assurance that my experience is going to be used as a training exercise.

Jambalaya was pretty spicy.  You have your choice of pasta, jasmine rice or brown rice. Comes with peppers, sausage, crawfish, and some giant grilled prawns. I stuck with the pasta. It was tasty.

The Lobster Garlic Noodles & Chinese Garlic noodles are phenomenal.  Korean Street taco is tasty & I love the chili threads on top.  Pizzas are good & on happy hour.  

Hawaiian Mule is our favorite similar to a Moscow Mule.  For beers, if I don't get one of their many different beer flights, I'll get this Watermelon beer that's 10%!  It's nothing like a framboise, it's only a slight watermelon aroma, but taste like beer.  There's also a flight that's usually has it on the list to try.

The Yard House is in a nice location. It's away from the main Strip, down near the airport, but not too far that a taxi ride is too expensive. We didn't check out any of the shops around the restaurant but it did look like somewhere worth coming back to.  We didn't have a reservation, but received a booth with no hassles or wait time. It was a Sunday night and there was a football game on and the restaurant was very busy and noisy, but our waitress told us that everyone usually left as soon as the game finished, which they mostly did. Our waitress was extremely helpful and friendly and gave us some delicious suggestions for beers to try. 

For dinner I ordered the Rib Eye, which was delicious and my vegetarian wife had the BBQ ""Chicken"" Salad. There is a massive selection of vegetarian meals on offer here, which apart from the beer was the main reason we came here. Both of our meals were very nice indeed.

After several beers and a perfect amount of food later we left the Yard House very full and very happy. The only downside to the whole night  was that our first very friendly waitress finished her shift shortly after we ordered our first beers.

The Gardein chicken fingers are always great. And my favorite is the Gardein Orange chicken. Which is like 18-19$ depending on location I think. And that seems a bit much. All in all... there isn't a ton of satisfaction here these days. But they have some good eats and of course great beer and cocktail options.",zuopKcPI1VBVFG8ynCHIMA,0,0,3,nw5RF8K4Zhbhd3pb9ItoFA

Unfortunately for me, I came here a day after my birthday and I was still in major recovery mode so I did not really get to take advantage of their abundant beer list.  

Their food was just okay for me but then again, maybe me being in recovery mode affected my taste buds too so maybe I'd give them another shot.  Definitely will be back at least to get some beers as I love fresh beer.  Bottled beer does not do the name ""Beer"" justice.  

And the service was excellent all around.  Since we had to wait for a table, we actually hung out at the bar for about 20 to 30 mins.  And since they had so many beers, we needed to ask the bartender for advice.  He was extremely patient with us.  And once we sat down at our table, again, the server, was excellent.

I was with a group of friends deciding where we would eat and have some drinks when one said, ""If the restaurant isn't busy, I don't want to go in there because it probably doesn't have good food."" Sometimes, however, a place can be too busy to provide exceptional service. That was my experience at Yard House this past Saturday night.

We sat down at a booth and order drinks, appetizers, and entrees. Our drinks took about 20 minutes to arrive, they don't come in chilled glassware, and the tap isn't cold - so your drink is warm after three-four sips. 

Our appetizers arrived with our entrees. The bowls/plates are large and with five people in a booth, we didn't have table space for the food. We were eating on top of one another. Since we ordered appetizer soups and entrée sized salads instead of finger food - this wasn't cool! Armando blamed this on the kitchen, so my guess is they don't fire entrees separately from appetizers. Some restaurants fire appetizers and then check on the table's progress before firing the entrees. My recommendation on a busy day at Yard House would be to place your appetizer order, wait 15 minutes, and then order your entree.

We had a sixth person join us after our food arrived and her drink arrived just about the time we were all done eating. Overall, the experience was nothing special. I generally order appetizers for one reason, to offset the hunger and pace the food so you can enjoy the company your with and experience the meal.

Outside of the service complaints, the Chicken Tortilla Soup was very good. It has a creamy white cheddar flavor with slices of avocado and tortilla strips in addition to a nice portion of chicken. The bowl of soup is not a large generous portion, so it could easily be an appetizer. 

The entree portion of the Chopped Salad w/ salmon was fresh looking and generously portioned. It comes with the typical tomatoes, bacon, and avocados in addition to corn, cucumbers, celery, onion and cilantro.

For dessert, we decided to try the Mini Peach Apple Cobbler and the S'Mores Brownie. All three bits of crust topped cobbler were delicious. The S'Mores brownie required a topping of ice-cream, ordered afterward, because it is too dry to eat.",jY1shXf_LQVhSoUyoXqQRQ,8,6,2,tBjE4qMwJY9dBpbLjUmpxA

1510421,2010-11-12,5,A5Rkh7UymKm0_Rxm9K2PJw,"Okay, there are a few things that are going to be brought up and I'm almost guaranteed to get a manager comment on this, but whatever, it's happening.

Went here last night to try the Gardein line here. I was very excited to see that vegan meats have been added to some of their dishes. How cool is that?? But upon doing some internet research before we ordered, I found out that due to cooking methods, ALL of the dishes wouldn't be vegan OR vegetarian. They cook everything on the same grill as the meat. What sense does this make? None. It's like having a black coat and putting bleach all over it - it doesn't resemble a black coat anymore and is tainted. If you mix vegan food with meat, what is the point? 

And here comes why it is 2-star. IT IS NOT STANDARD PROCEDURE FOR THE VEG*N MENU TO BE COOKED IN A SEPARATE PAN. You have to go out of your way to ask for this, and even then a manager comes out to explain that it's not going to taste the same as if it were on the grill. Hmm - do you really think a vegan WANTS dead cow mixed in with her food? HELL NO. Granted, Yardhouse has already taken *some* action and put a little dot next to a few items that absolutely will come in contact with meat since these items are fried and have to go in the same basket as everything else. But they haven't specified that ALL the menu items will come in contact with animal products which is not okay. It would be really helpful if people who come here know this right off the bat. If I hadn't had my phone on me that night, I literally would have gotten sick since I haven't had any sort of meat in 6 years. 

Here's what I would suggest: just like other companies before you (Chipotle comes to mind), please automatically make all the vegetarian/Gardein items cooked separately from the meat. You don't want a lawsuit a la McDonald's. It is ridiculous that these vegan meats come to you and then you cross-contaminate them with animal sources to make them not even vegetarian. Oh and this isn't just for this Yardhouse, it goes for all of them - trust me, I will be contacting your corporate offices today. Also, it would be nice if you could put a little V next to the items that could be made vegan or are vegan on the menu. Makes ordering easier, and the confusion of your staff minimal.

Anyways, I ordered the veggie sliders that come with fries, and we also ordered a side of sweet potato fries. Matt ordered a thai ""chicken"" pizza. After some back and forth, the sliders couldn't even go on the bread (only the wheat bread is vegan) so I got them protein style, wrapped in lettuce. The sweet potato fries we got as our appetizer were severely lackluster. Very bland, no taste, no toppings like sugar or anything. We couldn't have the sauce since it contained bacon, so I guess that's where all the flavor is. After the aforementioned back and forth with the wait staff, we got our food. Do they seriously only have the meat and the bun (in my case, lettuce) for the sliders? NOTHING else? No tomato or onion or even ketchup and mustard? For serious? The taste of the Gardein patty was wonderful, but for almost $11 for plain patties is ridiculous. The fries were way better than the sweet potato ones, but it just wasn't worth the price. I wish they would have suggested to make my order a veggie burger since that's essentially what they did anyways, was cut the patty into four pieces and pass them off as sliders. At least then I could have had the wheat bun and toppings. 

It was very difficult throughout the night to try and signal our waitress. I know it was very busy and that I did ask a lot of questions and such, but she was an expert ninja. Not the best customer service in the world. I also unfortunately don't see this Gardein line lasting here at Yardhouse. Until cooking the items separately becomes standard procedure, I can see a lot of vexed veg*ns. Honestly, what is the point of having vegan meats if they're going to end up on the same grill as actual meats? I just don't get that logic. Yardhouse itself is a bit pricey and I understand this, but at least give the customer the most you can. Plain sliders are not okay. In fact, I don't think I've been anywhere that has completely bare sliders. 

Due to the lackluster food, the outrageous price tag and the lack of good customer service, Yardhouse really deserves a 1-star review but I still love that a chain has decided to put vegan faux meats on their menu. The intent is there, but the execution is awful but can be easily improved upon. I might be back since there were other items that looked appetizing, but only when I want to deal with the headaches and the hassle. Until then, I'll stock up on Gardein at Whole Foods and make my own delights at home.",-fzk0slIjoFQD1eWjx1uWw,10,7,2,PgRDBa6A38bLedeipwASNQ

Thank you to the Host Staff for participating in my boyfriend's engagement scavenger hunt! Kudos for playing along, and not making me feel stupid when I asked you if you had a scavenger hunt clue. You guys are always welcoming, nice and accommodating! 
We honestly had our first date here, which is why he incorporated it. I can honestly tell you that I remembered what we had that night, and how much I appreciated the customer service then (and on other visits with friends).

I'm glad to come here whenever I get a chance to be in Town Square and my most recent experience is a testament to Yard House's ever-growing quality of service and their endeavor to update their menu. I was about disappointed in the options I was left with as I don't consume much meat but pleasantly surprised they offer gardein food! Not too many places would take the effort in including this in their menu and I strongly applaud Yard House for doing so. That said their food is always amazing and the dining options in door and out door at the Yard House in Town Square is great!

The food was amazing and if you're a beer lover such as myself they have over 100 brews to choose from. The selection included everything from lagers to ale's and even mixed beer drinks if you want to mix raspberry Lindermans Framboise w/ a chocolate flavored beer. And worse case scenario, let's say that you can't make up your mind on a beer selection; they also have samples of every brew to find the perfect one for your taste buds... I prefer Peroni.

The dinner was delicious. My girlfriend ordered a spicy chicken flatbread sandwich with parmesan & herb fries. I had to take a bite lol, and that was bomb.com! Chicken was grilled to perfection with avacado, cabbage, and spicy mustard. I ordered the BBQ cheddar burger! Heaven on earth. 1/2 lb sirloin cooked to order, melted cheddar cheese, smoked applewood bacon on a sweet Hawaiian bun and sweet potato fries on the side. Best burger I've ever had hands down.

The only downer I seen about the place is that its extremely loud inside of Yard House. I'm not knocking anyone's fun but it was hard to carry a convo with my girlfriend without shouting at eachother and we're sitting next to eachother in a booth.

The high point about Yard House can also be its downfall.  While I have no difficulty getting a Molson or something even harder to come by, I also have to pay $6 for it.  And that's for a standard 12 ounce glass.  I know Vegas alcohol prices can be inflated but that's a bit much.

Ok, so we had a party of 14 (plus being a Saturday night at 7, we knew it would be busy), so one of our guests went at 6:15 to put in a name and wait for a table, which we were told would be about an hour wait. Well 7 rolls around and no table, so half of our party waits to leave their hotel, because...no table. Well we finally get seated at 7:45 (we tell our friends to come meet us). The server comes 5 minutes later to get drink orders, 5 minutes after that, the Manager Leo comes and asks us when the rest of our party will be there and we say shortly, and he then complains he can't have empty tables for long. Well unfortunately there is a movie theater upstairs (and Stars Wars opened yesterday, so Town Square is busy) so our friends have trouble finding a parking space. Well maybe after 10 more minutes, the Manager Leo comes back to our table and begins to actually yell at us about the empty table, and how they had it reserved at 6 and they held it for us...Which wasn't even for our group! So we tell him this and we tell him our friends are trying to park, but he continues to yell at us and say he needs the table because other people are waiting. We respond and say we had waited (just like everyone else) for over an hour and a half for our table and our friends will be there any minute. He storms off mumbling, and then of course our friends show up 30 seconds later. We did have an issue trying to get our check, and at one point, Manager Leo came over to the corner of the bar area and glared at our table for about 10 seconds and stormed off again.

Well to sum it up, this latest visit to the Yard House was for a close friends Birthday Dinner. I was only expecting five people or so, but she reserved almost 20 some-odd seats!!! So good to know that the Yard House does take reservations in advance for such a huge party.  The party didn't start off as planned since the birthday girl was nearly two hours late for her own party!! lol. However, thank goodness for the large LCD TV screens plastered on every inch and corner of this place, we were able to kill the time, starting with some drinks and enjoying Sunday Night Football at the same time...so it all didn't go to waste :) The beer selection is AMAZING! They dedicate a whole two pages of the menu just for the beer, I've also seen Beer Floats and I have yet to try one. If you don't want to spend full price on alcoholic beverages, they have Happy Hour from 10pm-Close. 

The Yard House...its an interesting restaurant. The ambiance in this place is...well....AMAZING!? ha ha. It's weird, you sit there at your table and the lighting is dim and serene, yet at the same time, with the LCD Screens and the bar smacked right in the middle of the restaurant, it's also like a pub! So...like a high class restaurant/Pub/Sports bar/Lounge? Does this make any sense? Because I'm just typing away and totally going off subject..........

Food! I usually start off with the Calamari, the baby-squid type, not that O-ring type! Yum Yum....and my main dish is always the Crab Crusted Swordfish on Wasabi Mashed Potatoes. Absolutely amazing! The swordfish is cooked just right, every time I have ordered this dish, and not once was the fish over cooked. Its pretty pricey, $23.00 (give or take), but the portion is well worth your money! :) However this time I decided to try something else and a bit lighter. Since i filled my body with a lot of alcohol for the night, something big would get me sick so I decided to order something small. So I figured an appetizer, that's small enough right? I ordered the Ahi Poke Stacker which was $11.95. Ahi Poke is cubed raw tuna tossed in a mix of soy sauce, sesame seed oil, onions, limu, green onions. I grew up on this stuff, so I was quite curious of the Yard House's recipe. I was VERY satisfied. When I received my plate, first layer was ahi poke, then a layer of ""fried something"", next topped with seasoned sauteed Carrots, another layer of  the fried ""crispy something"", topped with more poke. It was light, refreshing, and absolutely delish!!! The taste was just as amazing as its presentation. :) My new favorite dish! Don't forget to finish off with the Kona Coffee Sundae for dessert, it's quite big, so you can share with a friend or significant other! 

Usually with big groups, taking orders could be tricky. It makes sense for a group of 14, to assign two waiters to take orders. After that experience, unless the two waiters can communicate good, its not a good idea. Problems such as taking double orders (esp with drinks..) not cool!

1716790,2014-03-29,0,A5Rkh7UymKm0_Rxm9K2PJw,"***Disclaimer - REALLY long review in regards to late night Happy Hour not being honored on St. Patrick's Day

Came to Yard House at Town Square to celebrate my birthday with my husband and I was very excited to order quite a bit of things on the menu, both food and drink.  However, I was VERY disappointed to find out that happy hour was not being honored.  My birthday is on St Patricks Day and the server informed me that there was no happy hour because it was a holiday.  I informed the server that it's not a national holiday and there happy hour policy on their menu does not state that holidays are not included.  We were not informed when we entered the restaurant that there was no happy hour.  We were also not informed when we were seated and our first orders were taken that there was no happy hour.  If my husband had not inquired if a certain beer was on the happy hour menu, I believe we would not have been informed that happy hour was not being honored.  

My evening was ruined because there was no happy hour.  I did not want to order as many items as I would have liked because there was no happy hour.  My husband did not want to cause a scene that evening so I did not ask for a manager that night.  

The food that we did order was good for the most part, but it wasn't great.  We ordered the spicy tuna and california roll.  The spicy tuna was good but the california roll's rice was hard and undercooked.  The hummus lacked flavor.  The only really good thing I ate was the jamaican jerk wings.  

The next day I called other Yard House's in Las Vegas and the one at Red Rock informed me that they honor happy hour on holidays, it just depended on which holiday.  They said it was at the manager's discretion.  They said that they had happy hour but only from 3 p.m. - 6 p.m. and not the late night happy hour.  I also called Blue Martini, McFaddens, and Buffalo Wild Wings who said they had happy hour on St. Patricks Day.  

I then called the Yard House at Town Square and asked to speak to a manager.  I spoke to Leo and he informed me that the policy for no happy hour came from corporate.  He informed me that customers were being informed at the door that there was no happy hour and I informed him that was not the case with us.  He explained there was nothing he could do for me because corporate sent that policy.  He informed me that no Yard House in the country had late night happy hour on St. Patrick's Day.  I asked him for the number to corporate and thanked the manager for his time.  

I then called four other Yard Houses in the country and three out of the four said they had happy hour both early and late, even though it was St. Patrick's Day.  I contacted corporate and left a message since it was after hours.  I waited 2 days but heard nothing back.  I called corporate again on Friday, March 21 and spoke to customer service who researched the information for me.  He was first unaware of the policy so he said he would contact the Yard House in Town Square and give me a call back.  After calling back he informed me that there may have been some miscommunication and that he was new and that is why he may not have heard of the happy hour policy for St. Patrick's Day.  He asked if the manager at Yard House did anything for me and I informed him that he did not.  In the end, he said he would do more research and send me some gift certificates in the mail.  

As of 3/28/14.  I have not received them but he did say they would take approximately 7-10 business days.

All in all, I was just very disappointed with the way they went about the happy hour policy.  They should have made a sign out front or placed a note on the menu, or trained ALL STAFF to inform EVERYONE before they were seated.",dQPrX-xVKLk3565zZoOfHw,3,0,2,sT2PMHi7kiOhxIYQsW8MsQ

We got seated, drinks were ordered and then around 5:30pm we ordered food (Pizza and boneless wings on the happy hour menu). To our disadvantage, the kitchen was backed up. We started noticing that tables who arrived after us were receiving their food before us. Our waitress, Nancy, was very apologetic and doing her best to fix the problem.
After 45 mins, we asked to speak to the manager. Jose, the manager, came over and spoke with us. He apologized and explained that the kitchen was backed up and offered to cover the bill. Our food came out one by one but fresh and hot. ALL THE FOOD ENDED UP BEING ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS!!!! We really enjoyed all the flavor. We even decided to get dessert!
We enjoyed ourselves as we ate and enjoyed our last day together as a group. Our wonderful waitress came by frequently to check on us and refill our drinks. The manager also stopped by to check on us. 
Even though we had a dilemma with the timing of our food, the customer service was great. I would definitely still return. I can't believe I've been to town square so many times and never stopped here. I can't wait to come back.",cpyf07RSNpjfSIg-pA99TA,0,0,5,VTlsp3nHodL3D-v_8hdzBg
1719508,2015-06-07,0,A5Rkh7UymKm0_Rxm9K2PJw,"WTF? Feta Cheese on Guacamole?!?!! 
The Yardhouse needs to STOP messing with their menu. The guacamole we ordered came with feta cheese on top. This was not a mistake. Guacamole is a mix of subtle flavored and textures. This added ingredient is just plain wrong. 
The burger I ordered was fine, but without the BBQ or Garlic Aioli. Apparently the server thought that when I asked if the burger had mayo or other spreads, he took it upon himself to have no spreads on the burger. It arrived warm, not hot, likely from sitting in the AC cooled interior of the restaurant. 
As for libations, Angry Orchard is still on the menu. My favorite dunkels are gone and apparently never to return. 

The sad part about all this, is the state of this poor level of service is consistently prevalent across the chain. For the price of dinner, there are better options. I want it to be better but it just fails in being so anymore.",AtadD2qiOuL_pSXwL0It3Q,1,0,3,0hKohSIMN_GfDDj-5GrWAQ

He was outstanding during our entire dining visit. We had a few questions about different menu items and he was very informative and helpful!  Plus he had a great quirky personality that makes him a great waiter!

Since it was Happy Hour, they have many 1/2 price appetizers and deals on drinks.  We decided to split the Chicken Nachos and Bearnaise Sliders.   This was a fantastic deal as our nachos ended up only being about 5.50 and the sliders were around 6.50.  The chicken nachos were delivered on a huge plate!  This plate alone would have actually been enough for both of our stomachs to be filled.  They had a great combination of ingredients with plenty of chicken spread throughout the nachos.  Fabulous! 

The sliders came out with 4 on the plate and a side of shoestring fries. I didn't see that fries were included so that was a bonus.  Plus I love shoestring style french fries.  Yum.  The sliders were just ok.  I almost wish we ordered the classic style sliders.  Yes I did love the bearnaise sauce that accompanied the sliders on the side but the burger itself was very plain.  It still enjoyed them.  

Their dining area itself is spacious and roomy.  There are plenty of seating inside and on their outdoor patio.  Everything was kept very clean and tidy! It doesn't hurt to see their keg room when you first walk in...  puts a smile on my husbands face!  It is a great place whether you are visiting or a local.",xhhE0txKwQtRzgQVVdKkvg,6,2,4,WBLDqt0Kdze5xMHfFS6amw

It's a great way to find out what we like so we can share suggestions when take our out town guests here for dinner. 

Dining here has always been pretty good as far as food and service goes. Except for my last visit here.  I had ordered Chicken Nachos appetizer and mistake on my part, I didn't realized it's served with Guacamole which I am highly allergic to and get real bad food reactions from it. I was going to work my way around the nacho plate but our server was really nice and said he would have it remade, no problem, only it would take a few minutes more.  

Few minutes later I had a dish of Chicken Nachos! Looked great and it did for the most part tasted pretty good. Only thing is it was the same plate of nachos with the one layer of guac just scraped off the plate.  There were still even traces of guac still left on the chips and smudges of guac on plate!  (see pic: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/yard-house-las-vegas?select=j_re5zvpe5Qh7zwBXkpMyg#j_re5zvpe5Qh7zwBXkpMyg  ) I didn't really want to have this plate taken back yet again. 

Needless to say I was really disappointed I didn't touch the plate after I saw there was still guacamole on it.  It's no fault of the server. Rest of our orders were pretty good.  But the cook line needs to know that food allergies should be taken seriously. Had I ate anything that even had a smidgen of guacamole, you would've had your guest knocked out on your table.",2EuPAGalYnP7eSxPgFCNDg,5,2,2,GGsbjSDS39GETo6GmgpKZw

The carried a Woodchuck Autumn blend which can be hard to find in specialty stores let alone a restaurant.  They also have many different wines and a full bar so no worries if you don't prefer beer.  The food has always been great.  On past occasions I've tried the fish tacos (yummy), Cobb salad (had a twist to your traditional Cobb with edamame beans and corn on it), and blackened salmon with a mango salsa (excellent flavor).  There can be a bit of a wait to sit outside but there's usually a spot or two at the bar where you can wait.  Usually don't have to wait more than 5-10 minutes even on a busy night.

 I am a big fan of chicken nahos, its just loaded with chicken, guac, beans, etc. Its a great starter for a big group. Hungry folks will devour it immediately. If you are going there with just another person, than don't get it. Its too big for both, and you can't take it home cause it will get soggy. My favorite are their ahi sliders. They are just delicious. The fish is fresh and its hint of citrus. Its a must have for anyone who's trying to eat healthy.   

They also have awesome beer selection, it could be bit more pricy than other local places, but the variety negates the higher price on beers. 

Overall, if you are hungry and if you are anywhere near town square than go here. On weekends, if does get really busy so if you have a big party than you might end up waiting for 15-30 minutes. I am not sure if you can reserve ahead of time.",kwIhn1_cnQeUaLN0CuWWHw,0,0,5,1XVsg6BKekTFumAkJtP9_w

But I wanted to try something new (big mistake) so I decided to order the Ahi Tuna Crispy Salad (something along those lines). Our server was great, which made not enjoying the food kind of a flop. 

When I received the salad, the tuna was sliced into maybe 1/4 inch pieces and the edges of each piece was covered in pepper. I do not like a whole bunch of pepper so that was a big disappointment for me. Also, they saturated the salad in salad dressing. I had to send it back because it made it very difficult to each and extremely unappetizing. I tried to enjoy it after they fixed the drenching of the salad and put the dressing on the side, but it was still difficult to enjoy the food. I was highly considering asking them to change the salad into the sliders but I  didn't want to wait even longer to get my food because we waited a while to get my salad and my friend's burger. I was very disappointed and would not recommend getting that salad. I almost did not want to pay for the food because I felt that I did not enjoy the food and I wasted the tuna :(",Bzua23HTctk3wYM2kvQ9Dg,0,0,3,ETqK2T4GbVhNmOb6Ewl4EA

Practically all day happy hour on Mondays for Monday Night Football. But on a normal basis, happy hour is effective from 3:00 PM - 6:00 PM M(maybe Sunday included)-TH, and 10:00 PM - Close Sun - Wed.

Half off select appetizers which consists of most appetizers. My personal favorite is the Chicken lettuce wraps.

Bernaise Sliders for the win as well. Most if not all sliders are $6.95 during happy hour. Pizza is half off as well.

Yard House is a dim-lighted atmosphere consisting of great service from all servers. 

I don't normally order my alcohol from here because I prefer to fulfill my satisfaction with food rather than liquor but they have a huge selection of beer and discounted happy hour prices for most liquor as well.

Be warned though, this is not the place to come to if you're on a diet. I feel that they put tons of salt and sodium in all their food.

Every time I come, it's usually always busy. Meaning I've never come on an empty night. Still receive great service and seated within an acceptable amount of time.

The list is impressive. They have some neat stuff and the 6 pack samplers change regularly. The food is good, but I can't tell if it's microwaved, so that's almost as bad as being microwaved.

A mix list provides cleaver names for the combos you already know and love. The servers are generally pleasant and helpful and have, at the very least, remembered the scripts for various beer questions that may arise.

It is good, not for everyone, but sometime for me.

If you are in the area to kill time, stop in, have 2 beers and see how you feel about the atmosphere and the selection.",rdysF0ymVkMX82Bu_8x3nA,0,0,3,jXcZ4JnZi_q5pn7t2NYPag

However, the location is also exceptionally loud and service on a recent visit was less than attentive, even with a large party and a reservation. Luckily they didn't tack on autograt. The prices also seemed higher at this location than others, and the food just wasn't quite as good as usual.

AHI TUNA SALAD: Protein portion was noticeably less than at the Red Rock casino location.
CALAMARI: Portion size was good, breading wasn't too thick or too oily, and there was a good mix of whole pieces and rings. The dipping sauce was cold though.
GRILLED CHEESE & TOMATO BISQUE: Pretty good but nearly $14 for sliced cheese, bread, and tomatoes, is a bit ridiculous. Unclear whether other sandwich/burger orders include a side.
TACOS: $4 for various street tacos. They're street taco sized but not street taco priced and not very tasty either. Pass on the chicken, at least.
POKE NACHOS: Probably your best option. Well priced, good portion, and fresh. I liked the seasonings used, wasn't as salty as I'd expected. Easily shareable, too.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,22,10,3,UjZc05rOHMPfOwMv0MB_gQ

Jason was the manager who was sympathetic to our dilemma and had us seated within 15 minutes even though the rest of our party was five minutes behind that.  Jason handled things very professionally unlike most service workers in this town that treat you like you're bothering them.

Came here today for lunch at 3pm. Was seated in their lovely patio. Started off with guacamole, it was fine. When it came to our lunches my friend asked if he could have a pizza half pepperoni half BBQ chicken. We were told you can't do half pizzas when they have different sauces. What? He explained he didn't care if the topping ventured onto the wrong sauce (BBQ/tomato) and the kitchen refused. Then came my brilliant order of the Hawaiian poke stack. At this time, an alarm should have sounded in my brain ""Rachel! It's ahi tuna! It's raw! It takes skill and quality to create a sublime product and your at a chain!"". Instead my tummy prevailed, and what I got  was a stringy, chewy, tough, pile of butchered fish.

Nachos, huge portion and delicious, perfect for sharing. Loaded with bean, cheese, chicken, jalepeno, sour cream, pico, guac... the goods!! 
Shitake Garlic Noodle - smaller portion, good for one - very good.. not crazy garlicky. 
Hummus - they have a chili oil type on top that adds such great flavor to the hummus, but not spicy at all. 
Fried Calamari is delicious - decent portion, crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside, the aioli that it comes with is delicious. 
ABSOLUTE FAV: Firecracker wings - these have a little kick to them, salty and sweet at the same time - great flavors - a must try!
Chicken Lettuce Wrap - pretty big portion, good for sharing - 3 options for sauce - all very good!
The Seared Ahi sandwich is so good.. I'm usually not a sandwich person but I will eat this one any day.

Outside of the happy hour menu, the food is pretty good and a little expensive for what it's worth to us.  Beer Seletction here is ridiculous!  Something like over 100 different one.  They have TV all around with sport channel usually showing so this is great for all those that watch sports.",GPNGSOvLMaVIn1nAlltQ8Q,0,0,5,OLe0DQlktxJU9nVkc0uBmg

They have BEER. Boy, do they have beer. Did I mention they have beer? 

Also, you will become a raging alcoholic after your first visit. Because you will want to try every beer here until you have succeeded. You can do it! Just kidding, you'll never be able to.

I suppose this place has other things outside of Delirium Tremens, I just don't care about it. No, that's not true, their salads are excellent as is most of their other food (I've never gotten something I didn't like), but I really go mainly for the beer.

It's a good place. It's just not a great place. Everything is pretty solid. But nothing is exceptional.

The bartenders are very nice and helpful. They will give you a free sample taste of any of the draft beers. And it's a decent list of beers.

The service has always been good. Even when it is crowded and very busy, we've never had any issues with the service here.

One of my favorite go-to items on the menu is the bernaise sliders. The sliders themselves are very good. Good burgers and good buns. The bernaise sauce comes on the side. It is definitely not your standard bernaise sauce and would never hold up on a steak. But on a burger, this particular bernaise is delicious. The shoestring fries that come on the side are also great. Just the right amount of crispiness and salt.

The pizzas have also always been pretty good. Along with most of their menu items.

The wings, though, have been somewhat of a let-down. They are your typical cheap tavern wings, except they aren't cheap. Poor quality meat and not that meaty. The firecracker wings have a great sauce. Very saucy and flavorful. The buffalo wings, though, while there is a decent flavor to the sauce, is a very oily sauce. The ranch dipping sauce is well above average and pairs nicely with the wings.

The atmosphere is ok. The space and decor works. It's definitely a family-friendly place, often filled with strollers and small children. The bar area can be quite full during happy hour. Seems to be popular with both tourists and locals alike.

If you are expecting culinary greatness, you will be disappointed. If you are looking for a decent lunch or dinner after a couple of hours of shopping or before hitting a movie, this place will hit the spot. And the happy hour deals are great.",YMgZqBUAddmFErxLtCfK_w,0,0,3,qRV_VCRCwCoflsocAsL1Ew

2052689,2010-10-27,0,A5Rkh7UymKm0_Rxm9K2PJw,"Yard House-- in the middle of the street-- Yard House!

A spin off of BJ's, but without the family feel to it. It's probably one of the biggest and famous chain of restaurant slash bar slash sports bars I know of. They're not really known for anything else but the different draft beers that they serve here but since I don't drink alcohol, I wouldn't be very helpful in that department. The atmosphere right when you walk-in is of most restaurants similar to BJ's or Alehouse. You'll find your singles at the bar watching sports, the flock of females in booths wooing loudly because they're in Vegas or locals that are pretending they're tourists and still wooing loudly aka Woo Girls (c) How I Met Your Mother. And sometimes, you'll catch the party of 15 or more in the middle of the room trying to celebrate or have dinner with friends. That's us.

Yard House is pretty good about taking care of large groups. We celebrated my brother's birthday here and their service wasn't memorae but it wasn't horrible. They took our orders, gave us our food, checked on us to refill drinks, gave the check, and thanked us for coming in. Nothing out of the ordinary though. The happy hour menu (Sunday-Wednesday, 10pm-close) has a wide range of different eats! I highly recommend the garlic noodles, sliders with Bernaise sauce on the side, and the chicken wings! Superb! For something not on the happy hour is the New York steak salad. I'm not too sure how I feel about red meat on a salad because it's kind of a culinary oxymoron, but the way Yard House throws it together leaves me with some belief that there are chefs and cooks that know what they're doing in the kitchen! Comforting isn't it?

2075668,2012-05-09,0,A5Rkh7UymKm0_Rxm9K2PJw,"Pros:
* Delicious food. You have to try the chicken tortilla soup.
* Friendly staff.
* Modern menu and decor.

Cons:
* Expensive. The food while good is slightly too expensive.
* Due to the popularity, they're generally crowded with long waits.

I believe Town Square to be the best shopping and restaurant plaza in Las Vegas. The quantity of choices for either is only matched by the quality. There certainly is no shortage of great food at Town Square and on yelp, Yard House is rated best of them all. I haven't tried them all but I can definitely say Yard House is the best I've had yet.

I went with a group of four on a late Tuesday afternoon. They weren't busy or crowded but I have seen the line pour out the door enough times to know I was lucky. We were promptly sat down just time to enjoy the happy hour menu. We ordered their famous tower of onion rings while we sifted through the massive menu. I ordered the chicken salad with a cup of tomato bisque soup. The other members of my party ordered the barbeque chicken salad with a cup of chicken tortilla soup, pastrami sandwich, and a mushroom burger. 

When the onion ring tower arrived it instantly lived up to the expectations. Thin, lightly battered, crispy onion rings sprinkled with parmesan cheese and served with ranch and chipotle ranch. They bursted with flavor to die for. At first the tower seems so incredibly large but when you finish the memory feels small in hindsight. My soup and salad was good with a pleasant, creamy, rich ranch dressing and well-seasoned tomato bisque soup. However, it paled in comparison to the nothing short of perfect, chicken tortilla soup. I have never had a tortilla soup so creamy and flavorful. They put a large piece of avocado in the cup along with the crispy tortilla strips and large chunks of chicken. Together, they blend to create a truly wonderful and hearty cup of soup. I had a bite of the barbeque chicken salad and while it was a bit too saucy for my tastes, the barbeque dressing wasn't overpowering and went well with the large pile of onion strings atop the salad. The pastrami sandwich looked great and the burger looked even better. The burger bun instantly caught my eye with a smooth crisp surface devoid of any grease or sheen. Next time I will surely try a burger. 

The Town Square location is large and wide open. The lighting is dim and creates a hip vibe that went well with the modern menu. Everyone in my group had a few questions about the menu and the server was friendly, knowledgeable, and willing to help. The prices however are a bit steep and you might want to arrive early to take advantage of the happy hour choices. One specific item that caught my eye was the 17 dollar macaroni and cheese. It looked delicious but it would have to be at that price.

In the end I walked away satisfied and yearning to return to try a burger or maybe even that posh mac and cheese entree.",TNYWqSWozQ3UKEiN6S1f6w,0,1,4,5htwKhKYt0YKDiCtrI1lJg

Everything about it was tasty. It had fresh cooked bacon, edamame, corn, yellow cherry tomatoes, blue cheese crumbles, thin sliced carrots and radishes. It also had a very light ranch dressing on it. The lettuce was crisp.

My husband ordered the Ahi Salad and he can be pretty lucky when it comes to food. He normally likes A good steak but opted to eat light too and ordered the lunch size portion.

If you are a chocolate lover,  but are sick of restaurants slaying the ""chocolate cake"" with a mediocre knock off of a good ol' Duncan's Hines box cake--then this is your chance to indulge in a decadent, warm, rich chocolate treat!

As far as dinner goes, I'm a huge fan of the Southern Fried chicken, and my hubby loves the Enchilada Stack.  We've never been unhappy with anything we order, they really know how to make a meal...even if it doesn't look at all like it sounds!  For example, their Mac & Cheese is so much more than ""Mac"" & ""Cheese"".  It's several kinds of cheeses, mushrooms, chicken, oh my!!

We recently ate at a Denver Yardhouse location, and it's consistent with our Las Vegas locations!

While the beer and menu are the same, the atmosphere is much more relaxed and mellow than the one on the strip, as expected. I dined for lunch on the weekend and found myself really wishing it was happy hour because they offer such great portions at a discounted price. 

Our table ordered a few salads and sandwiches, a burger, and macaroni and cheese. No complaints about the food; the portions are great and the food was tasty. The menu in general is pages long and offers a little bit of everything with convenient half and full size options. 

As for the beer, this place has it all! I discovered a very special watermelon IPA that was only $8/pint and 10%ABV! One pint did the trick and it was really fun choosing from the pages and pages of specialty beer on tap. They do offer 2 free samples, which I didn't realize, so I'll be sure to take advantage of this on my next trip.  

I think I definitely prefer the other location; my fun-meter wasn't as high while dining here, but I would be sure to come back if I'm ever shopping at the Town Square outdoor mall.",lwMRSo8NcI49Kuc8wvPIzQ,2,2,4,xd_JuNBcHZAIHRg4p_HXCg
2178539,2010-08-18,1,A5Rkh7UymKm0_Rxm9K2PJw,"This is a review about their happy hour sliders.

The Skinny: okay burgers that have a poor patty to bun ratio and need more interesting toppings (3), service - long wait times, reasonable service (2.5), value: it's reasonable - not too expensive and within keeping with other happy hour specials in town.

We ordered a plate of bearnaise sauce sliders and classic sliders. Serving sizes are large - one plate comes with four sliders and a side of fries.

The sliders are served on a slightly sweet pan-styled bun. Overall, there is probably a little too much bun and not enough meat inside. The patties are well-seasoned, crisp however are a might on the dry side. 

The classic came with some standard cheese and pickle - which was okay but would have been better if there was some lettuce or tomato on top. The bearnaise sliders come with some fried onions which really improved the flavour of the sliders and texture. The bearnaise sauce wasn't anything I needed to go back for however.

The skinny fries are okay when they're hot but once again suffer once they've sat out for too long. They are crisp but are a little on the thin cut fries side of things so it lacks some of the lovely mealiness inside.

Overall, not bad sliders, but nothing really special. The edge goes out to the bearnaise sliders by virtue of the fried onion topping.",h9RUaaHa5kcQKqtJ-sgS0Q,2,1,3,GJxBCAMMzxxS785ec0VxBA

But soda was always filled, checked up on us often but not overbearing, gave us a bag and containers to take out leftovers home without us asking and just had an awesome attitude.  

We went during happy hour and go a disgusting amount of food.  

Onion rings- we liked them and they give a hefty portion.  Would only get again if I was sharing with a few people ($5)

Traditional wings- really enjoyed them.  Gave us 10 medium sized wings.  Would definitely get them again ($6)

Fried Calamari- not good IMO.   Texture of the squid was a bit too squishy/tough and not feeling the breading.   Should have known not to get the seafood.  ($7)

Blue Crab Cakes- you get 2 decent sized per order.   They were decent but not intending to get again.   I'll pass, and for the money you can do better here.   ($7)

BBQ chicken pizza- better than what they serve at California Pizza Kitchen.  Nice sized.  You can share with 3 people easily as part of your order and won't get sick of it.   For the money, it was well sized and tasty.  ($7)

2250575,2011-06-30,1,A5Rkh7UymKm0_Rxm9K2PJw,"I'd been avoiding Yard House ever since a failed attempt at the Red Rock location: long lines, extra-loud music, spillover crowds, and a ""more here to be seen than to eat"" kind of vibe. There's nothing wrong with a busy, happy, trendy place, of course, especially one advertising more beers than anywhere else in the world, but it's not for boring old me.

But, the menu we'd perused online looked so different and interesting (at least for vegetarians) that I had to give in when my husband pushed for a visit before going to see a movie at Rave. Put anything in Town Square and I'll probably visit it at least once.

Even though it was busy and the music was indeed cranked up, it was my kind of music (classic rock), and the space between tables meant we didn't have to feel like we should introduce ourselves to the family at the next table. 

We had two servers during our meal (our first one went on break), and both were as enthusiastic as they were thorough, which is to say amply both. As I ordered, I was pleasantly asked if I'd like my salad dressing on the side, if I was a vegan (so the order could be adjusted if necessary), and - be still my heart - if I was fine with the veggie burger I ordered being a Gardein burger. Seldom do I know what I'm going to get when I order a vegetarian burger. It could be a nuked black-bean patty, it could be a homemade concoction starring bulgur and carrots, or it could be the most dreaded possibility of all: the tasteless Boca puck.

Or it could be the best veggie burger in Las Vegas, which is what I was served at Yard House. Oh boy!

I can't claim it will be the best for every vegetarian. Some people like a strong faux-meat experience, and others want the opposite. I like anything with a traditional burger texture and some kind of spicy flavour with a lot of ""umami"" - fullness, and that's what I got. I went with the potato bun. Fresh, but very squishy. I may try the wheat bun next time.

But before this we'd already been charmed by the appetizers. The Onion Ring Tower - as tall as its name implies - kept luring my fingers back. The rings were crispy but not greasy, with a dust of Parmesan over all.

Throught the meal our lemonades kept coming, each free refill with a ring of sugar around the rim. Okay. We were *definitely* putting Yard House on the short list for sure things.

And, open until 2 a.m.? What was this? And it's a full menu until 2 a.m.? That entire page of Gardein vegetarian items - wings, sliders, thai pizza, sandwiches - plus everything else on the near-novella of a menu is available after most restaurants pack up for the night? And they have half-priced pizzas and appetizers not only during regular happy hour, but also after 10 p.m. (Sunday-Wednesday)? Squeal!",l9YOhaPYvTJi_qfD3Y-wBQ,1,1,4,IdkJa4R4wHZXkhLwNnZi7g

A good mix of either, yet when your their with the family you don't feel awkward because so many other people are having family nights out and then when you are there with adults only, you aren't bothered by all the kids around, which is pretty rare to find a place that can manage to do both at the same time.  Maybe because it's a little dim and louder inside, but either way how the booths and tables are set up it's not too loud where you can't hear each other talk.

Happy hour menu is one of the best I think in town.  A variety of good choices that aren't just appetizer size, but could be full meals, so getting a good amount for what you pay for. 

Garlic noodles, poke stack, sliders, onion stack and cheese pizza for the kids are our go-tos.  I have had items off the happy hour menu and those were delicious too.  I don't think I've ever had anything I don't like here.  Recently had the mushroom lettuce wraps while doing the Daniel fast and those were really good as well.

To date, this is the biggest Yard House I have stepped into so you can tell that during happy hour it can pack quite a big punch for sure..The location itself is massive and tables are everywhere inside and out which made for a very quick wait time as you can imagine!

Foodwise I decided on the black truffle cheeseburger and after some ""local"" inside of my dinner mates the truffle fries..The burger itself was pretty filling and they certainly know how to prepare a medium rare burger when requested to do so (a pet peeve for me)..The patty was juicy and the showstopper to me was that the truffle sauce accompanying the burger and actually the truffle fries was not heavily salted like I am used to here..It turned around my view that maybe there is more to Yard House then just the Yards?

A low point was our waitress who was either just having quite the Vegas night or a Scrooge year round..Initially she threw the coasters down on the table as we ordered drinks and continued to slam down random items at will through out the meal (ketchup, food, etc), but did seem to try the cliche schmoozing when it came time for the delivery of the bill..That was a bit disappointing as it did have all of us blank staring each other if we really just witnessed this, but it did not rule the meal in the end!

Yard House would be the perfect place although it can be loud. I went on tuesday night so not so bad plus ended up sitting outside on the outdoor cover patio area. It worked out great! =)

I checked in too my surprise the wait was not very long got buzzed less then ten mins. Just first glance the place was packed that night. The server she was great about being patience since cousin guys running late. The first things I LOVE about the YH but at the same time frustrating figure out beer too start the night, The list is so long if there something that not find or something similar too likely would be very surprised. I went with the Kona Brewery Fire Rock Ale. I love my Kona Brewery not only because from Hawaii but good beer! The most common one see is Longboard so saw another one on tap! Hell yay! The rest of the night went with another my favorite Firestone Pale Ale. It another one that hardly see on tap at bars. I love there beer still have since visited Firestone winery. 

The food was good as always! It been while but remember the Hawaiian Poke Stack stood out for me. Poke never go wrong in life. I love the way everything balances together. The Poke nice and fresh soy style Poke. The crispy wonton that adds little crispy fried texture plus works out great scoop up all the Poke. The vegetable gives it more depth and flavors too the dish. The wasabi soy drizzle around nice accent too the whole dish. It daunting looking at it start height. Once break down all good stuff. The second app had the bearnaise slider. Honestly not really big fan. I asked the server she recommend as second app. It more miss then hit. The slider meat itself nothing special little dry side. The bearnaise sauce itself nothing special. You combine the sauce with the fried onion on top of the slider and the bun. Ok. Sure pass on sliders plus heavy app start the meal.

I had the Street Taco (Chicken tinga). I wanted too try something different then my last visit. I glad I did! It was awesome. The combination of the chipotle tomatoe sauce plus the feta cheese right balance with spice and cheese. I enjoyed the fact not over stuffed with things in the taco. I added the beans and rice. The rice was tasty stuff. The beans honest never got too because the beers and apps all stuff. 

Dessert my cousin and I split a Lemon Souffle off our sever recommendation. She got right on. It was not your traditional souffle. That it would be bursting like ballon out of the dish. It smaller portion really for one. Dessert we were all pretty full but try something sweet. It was just right amount of lemon and whipping cream or ice cream on top.

It's been a while since I've eaten here (usually we just come for beer) so we decided to stop by yesterday for happy hour, which is Mon thru Fri 3 to 6 PM. Happy hour features half priced appetizers, $2 off glasses of wine, and $4-5 beer. Since I never know what kind of beer to get, I looked at the menu until something sounded good...Ok, I'll have a Spaten Oktoberfest...isn't this beer only seasonal though? 

We ordered some appetizers to share: onion ring tower, spicy tuna roll, bernaise sliders w/ fries, and chicken lettuce wraps. Our favorite were the lettuce wraps, where the chicken was perfectly cooked and the sauces provided went well with it, especially the sweet and sour that had a little kick to it. The onion rings were a little over cooked and brown/over crispy but were still ok, especially when dipped in ranch. The sliders are always delicious, topped with fried onion strings and 1 of my favorite items on their menu. I didn't have the spicy tuna roll since I don't eat fish so I can't comment on that dish.

Yard House is one of my favorite places to grab a drink or hang with friends, especially this one since it's located right in Town Square and near the movie theater, making it a good place to drink before catching a movie. They also have a large number of TVs, so it's a good place to catch a game although I'm never on this side of town on football Sundays...They also have plenty of patio seating which is perfect on those spring and summer nights",zBi_JWB5uUdVuz3JLoAxGQ,2,0,5,4WHjarTmxmV4fiKEnzk7Kg

Lots of big TVs everywhere, any game you could want to watch, with a dimly light atmosphere. YH has more beers on tap than you could ever hope to drink in your visits there. 

Just like their sort of combination feel (nicer bar/restaurant- awesome sports bar) they've managed to do something similar with the menu. Normally, Im a fan of restaurants not trying to do too much, and sticking with a few things that they know how to do well, but this place apparently knows how to do it all well. We came during happy hour and had cheap drinks, and half priced appetizers, firecracker wings, onion rings, poke stack and crab cakes. All were absolutely fantastic. Especially the wings.

Start it off with Truffle fries, with all the unique sauces you can get. Fresh, nice texture, they dont forget to clean the oil. Don't let anyone try your fries or you'll be swatting hands away all night  Sadly they no longer have maple bacon sauce which went good with everything.
Ive tried burgers, salads, but mostly chicken. The southwestern chicken sandwich (or maybe its Cajun chicken sandwich?) Is to die for. I haven't tried anything i didn't like or love. If you haven't been here, come here with a friend. Its not the perfect dating atmosphere unless you don't mind having to speak loudly. 


The beer gets it's own section. 
I check out the brew menu every time.  The outside of the brewery is decorated with the barrels and hoses coming out, tons of barrels. First time you see it its a nice aesthetic.
Tons of options.. So far ""Deschutes Fresh squeezed"" is nice for citrusy hop kick. If youre a hop head its a no brainer to get a double indian pale ale (DIPA.) I like ""squatters double IPA"" high on the ABV, and around a 70 on IBU's. Its about 8%.
For first time craft beer consumers, ABV= Alcohol by Volume % IBU= International Bitterness Unit. Higher the IBU the more hops usually. 
The bartenders and even waitress/waitors are usually knowledgeable about the beer/wine/spirits. 
I took it more mild after 2 mugs of Deschutes and 1 of DIPA, so i ordered a ""not your father's root beer"" except for the last sips, tastes just like root beer, but the alcohol becomes more present the further you drink, all was very pleasant. You get your drinks very fast always even when it's packed. 

I got crazy with the beer, sorry.. not sorry.
I highly reccomend this place to anyone, the atmosphere is loud and usually packed only bad thing i can say about Yard House. So far I have been to 2 locations and they're both nice. Tv's everywhere like you'd expect for a bar. Don't look at them, try taking in the experience. You wont forget it likely. 15 minute wait most of the time, worth the wait. Prices are reasonable.

2388700,2013-03-05,0,A5Rkh7UymKm0_Rxm9K2PJw,"Yard house is pretty awesome especially when your there with awesome company.  I've been here a bunch of times and always have a blast.  If you're here you're going to be most likely getting one of those long glasses filled with beer, I always thought they were yard long glasses, hence the name Yard House, but I think they're half yards now. They have a great selection of domestic, imports, and craft beers.  They also have a special selection of beer which they'll serve until they run out.  I'd recommend trying those first if they sound good to you.

Happy Hours:
Monday - Friday 3pm - 6pm, half off those drinks, apps, and pizzas, there's also specials on some drinks.
Sunday - Wednesday 10pm - Close, same as M-F except no half off those long drinks.

If you can try to get a sit outside because inside is usually pretty loud and you might get your drinks faster, the bar is usually crowded.  It's also easier to get a party of about 20 seated together.  I think we had about that many last time, some passing out, everyone a drunken mess, good times. They have heaters during the winter and when it gets warmer nice place to have a beer away from the A/C.

Their food is actually pretty good better that what you'd expect from a place that serves mass amounts of alcohol.  They have everything from burgers to seafood to pizza, pasta, ribs, desserts...

Service is usually most of the time, haven't had a problem yet except for the time I asked for a yard a crown and they said no jk.  I'd say the only problem about this place is that when it's crowded, every time I've been there, it gets difficult getting a beer at the bar.

My previous review gave YH 4 stars, with the only problem being slow service, especially when it came to getting the check. 

Tonight, it seems as though my input was taken seriously; all the issues are no longer issues! The meal was very well timed, with the drinks, appetizer and main courses arriving as we needed them. We got the check at the same time our dinner plates were bussed, so we were able to pay it and then relax for a few minutes before leaving (my biggest complaint before was that we were often held hostage for a while after the meal because of the check not being presented quickly). All in all, great service!

2390271,2013-11-13,0,A5Rkh7UymKm0_Rxm9K2PJw,"Pop quiz: how sad is it that eating at this Yard House was one of my most anticipated moments before getting on the plane and heading out to Las Vegas for a few days? Gambling, glitz, girls and other words that start with ""G"" are all fine and dandy, but sometimes a guy just wants to down a few beers, chomp on some outstanding food and unwind in a place where not everyone is a raging tourist carrying an over-sized plastic drink that is watered down and reeks of desperation. This is that place.

My folks and I actually made it over here before they opened on a Monday morning and people were already lined up at 10:50 a.m. That's cool, right? This place clearly has a faithful audience, as evidenced by this review. And once those doors opened, shoot: it's like the customers in line thought the first 10 people in the door got a free unicorn that performs karaoke exclusively to hair metal songs. They rushed the door with a fervent desire to be first in and we just sort of meandered in after them. It's a big place with plenty of seats - there's no point in scrambling over each other to be the first one in. There's a lengthy patio, a surrounded bar and more seating than the average bar would know what to do with.

A hostess guided us to a booth opposite a table of nine individuals who exemplified the ""money cannot buy class"" rule. We overheard them tell the waitress they had to be out of there to catch a movie so right away you could tell this had potential to be the table from Hell. We already felt for this gal and then we realized she was waiting on us, too! Let it be known that Tasha, our waitress, got the MVP award for eternity during this shift because when the place opened, it appeared she got triple sat right out of the gate. Now I'm not an expert in the service industry but I know how hard it is to recover from a hand dealt like that in the opening minutes. We assured her we were in no rush, mostly because we weren't, and partly because we did not want to witness a breakdown on the floor. To her credit, she kept her cool and was efficient as she was sassy.

Speaking of keeping cool, you might want to psych yourself up before eating here because the menu is positively Dickensian with its verbiage. Six pages of beer alone?! No, you have not died and gone to Heaven; you just happened to wander into a place thriving with variety. Being that we stopped in for lunch, we stuck with sandwiches and the must-have lunch combo: a cup of soup and half a sandwich/pizza. Mom's chicken avocado sandwich was polished off with ease, Dad's... whatever Dad ate, was equally delicious, and my tortilla soup and pepperoni pizza were wolfed down in a shameful display almost as noticeable as my preference for hopping around the beer menu: Big Sky Moose Drool can totally give way to Kronenbourg 1664 if you try.

And through it all Tasha managed the suffocating requests of her demanding table, a performance that would go unnoticed if you were not paying attention given that everyone working here is a study in quick service and attentiveness. Food runners actually running food? Hostesses navigating the dining room with purpose? Bartenders keeping their orders flowing? You'd better believe it. We did not see a manager but I am assuming one was on duty, probably sitting in the rafters like Batman/woman, waiting to pounce when the need makes itself known.

There was one last bit of unfinished business: dessert. I'll just say this now: order the s'more brownie item. It will change your life. As the owner and operator of a beard and mustache, it almost made me consider shaving them off due to me realizing hot marshmallow embedded into my hair is not the most glamorous feeling. But wow if that was not the best way to go into a sugar coma that I have had the pleasure of eating in quite a while.

Yes, Yard House is a chain and yes, you know what you're getting by eating at one. But this one in particular has service and set up down to an art form. More TVs than you could ever watch? Extensive seating? A prime location away from most of the touristy things? Absolutely. And believe the hype, too - until the owners build one of these in Dallas, TX (hint, hint), it will remain a ""must-go"" destination for any upcoming Las Vegas trips. Who am I kidding? Even after they build one in Dallas, TX (nudge, nudge), I'll still be stopping here.",6MizZ9yqvVMfnlgpbaVeVw,1,0,5,wfK9wzBdfQwL831SfykWGA

Happy hour food:
Hawaiian Poke Stack- Ahi tuna on top of friend wonton chips with avocado, ginger, carrots and their sauce.. amazing! must try! one of my favorite items on the HH menu.

Fried calamari- I love calamari.. I love drizzling lemon juice on top and dipping it in the sauces. It tastes like every other fried calamari.. nothing special but still so good.

Kung Pao calamari- came with rice on the side, Kung Pao sauce with the calamari and it was mixed with red bell peppers, carrots, and caramized walnuts. Very different, a little spicy, but very tasty!

Bernaise sliders- you have an option to upgrade fries for a dollar! I upgraded my fries for truffle fries and they were amazing (I'm a sucker for truffle fries)! The sliders tasted like regular sliders.. nothing too special. I will definitely try other stuff next time!

Chicken lettuce wraps- came with four different type of sauces and the chicken came inside a taco-shell like bowl. I love making wraps, but it was okay. The chicken was okay. Is it me or they never give enough lettuce? Hehehe

Drinks- Great selection for a cheap price!

It had tons of lean white meat chicken, lots of cheese and yummy green and red enchilada sauce.  I finished the whole thing which I never do!

I ordered the small chicken Cobb salad and accidentally forgot to ask them to remove the bleu cheese. Our server Mike was fantastic, he had no problem taking the salad back to the kitchen to remove the cheese. When Mike returned with my salad it looked great, but as I started mixing the salad ingredients together I noticed the hard boiled eggs were grey and the tomatoes the cook served me were all spoiled. I understand that because of my mistake they had to remake my salad all over again but, the cooks should not be allowed to even serve rotten or spoiled food to their customers (especially because the food is being paid for). At this point I had lost my appetite so I asked for the manager, Debbie. I thought the manager was suppose to help solve the issue not treat you like you're ignorant. Debbie said ""that's the color tomatoes are suppose to look like"" implying that I was being scandalous for no reason. I grabbed the fork and tossed the tomatoes over so she could see that the tomatoes were Black. She took the tomatoes to the back to show the kitchen manager & tell them to ""be more careful."" It just didn't seem like a coincidence that the cooks served me a bad salad after I made them redo it & I emphasized that to Debbie but she was no help. In fact, she made my experience worse by talking to me as though I were a twelve year old. She never returned after she took the tomatoes to the kitchen. Mike was the only person who actually helped, which is why I'm leaving two stars instead of one. Kudos to Mike for working with such immature and unprofessional people. & thank you for not charging us for the salad, I wouldn't have paid for it anyway.",swWeV1XBOTVpJoUu8H4Ejg,0,0,2,S0275ihonlvxznaUpBYj5Q

The mimosas were a little too strong for me but I like it anyway. For desert we had mini chocolate soufflé cake & mini crème brûlée. 

Our waiter was SUPER awesome! She was very attentive and super nice! And so does the food servers! Because we requested outside seating, we were told it's a 15 minutes wait. But honestly we probably wait like 5 minutes or so and we were seated outside. It was super hot today and unfortunately we were seated under a heating thing. So we asked to move to the next table because 70° weather and heater over your head, I didn't wanted to be an oven roasted turkey. There was a slight delay with our food.

The food comes out promptly, no matter how busy, and without any mistakes. It is always beautifully plated and tastes amazing. And! If I may add, adapts to allergies as necessary. 

Eric is a fantastic bartender, by the way. Smiling and friendly, and knows how to talk to customers. Taylor is also great, paying attention and making sure your glass is full.

We met with a couple of our friends for drinks and dinner on a Friday. We were quoted 25-30 minutes, and were seated in 20. They were pumping people in and out of there quickly and turnover was efficient to say the least. 

Service is always excellent. Our server this time around was the perfect blend of attentive without being annoying. Despite being incredibly busy, we couldn't tell because he never skipped a beat, never made us wait long for anything, and never seem rushed/hurried/dismissive. 

Food is surprisingly good here. The exception being the calamari was rubbery and definitely overdone, and the two dips were rather bland (one was a marinara and one was some sort of jalapeño something or other). I have had ALL of their pasta dishes, and for a place you would expect to only have ""bar food"" the pastas are DELICIOUS! They are willing to substitute different types of pasta in each dish if you want (I subbed the penne for angel hair). Food prices are $1-2 too high in my opinion. 

Drinks: One of the reasons I like this place so much is the beer selection is MASSIVE. I have never had the same beer twice. Only like ciders? Well they have several to choose from of those as well. Beer flights here are also a great idea and affordable.

I was invited to a get together with some work folks and was accompanied by the ultimate gentleman.  I have fond memories of many of their locations (Costa Mesa, Irvine, Long Beach and West Palm Beach) and it was always with a crowd, so this is one of those chain places where good times are guaranteed.  

We went for happy hour since the appetizers were half priced and pints were 3.25.  The beer selection is HUGE and my companion and I had a hard time in choosing something to start with.  One of the two servers taking care of our table suggested we get a ""pre-designed"" sampler.  This is when the bar selects six beers for you, rather than you choosing six, and they stay within a certain medium, such as pale ales, darks, etc.  We wanted something in the medium category.  

The sampler is something I totally recommend you do if you're undecided about what beer you'd like and you have someone to share with you.  We sipped each beer, rated them accordingly, and decided our top three, in order, were Redhook ESB, Redhook Blond, and Fat Tire's New Belgium.  Since the top two were the New Belgium and the Blond, we ordered pints of each and shared 'em.

As for the appetizers, we picked up an order of the fried chicken strips and Hawaiian poke stack.  Great choices (kinda hard to mess up chicken strips, though); the poke was a pretty good portion for an appetizer and was tasty!  

Both of the servers were outstanding in tending to our party of 14.  Very attentive, didn't miss a beat, and were great about reminding everyone to get their last orders in before happy hour ended.  Can't beat that!

1. Mooshu eggrolls -  love this and strongly recommend to try it out
2. Calamari -  too oily,  which I'm having a heart burn now. 
3. Buffalo wings -  super spicy.   I guess I should have asked for light on sauce; still good to order
4. Penne with chicken -  it was kinda good.   Too much sauce even though my daughter requested for less sauce. 
5. Jambalaya with brown rice - can't feel the spice of Jambalaya except for excessive sauce. 
6. Lobster garlic noodles -  too salty.  If not salty then this will be a perfect dish.

Came here after a movie and it was a perfect place to just chill and have a beer. I ordered the pepper crusted gorgonzola burger. The marsala mushrooms and bleu cheese went really well with the arugula. A slight twist on your typical bleu cheese mushroom burger but the change actually means something instead of just having fancier ingredients for fanciness's sake. The patty was perfectly medium rare, tender and juicy. YUM. The beef was gamey, almost like buffalo, but I liked the change of pace. However, I do wish the fries were cut thicker though.

Almost forgot, they had perfectly fried onion rings! Excellent texture, crunch, and flavor. Plus they come out on a tower, kinda like those kiddie ring tosses. Good stuff.

Avoiding the overpriced and often horrible service downtown hotel eats, I took a trip South of the city to Town Square Shopping Center.  Here, amongst may outlet stores, I found Yard House.  With the incredible beer selection, this is my kind of place.  Featuring inside and patio dining, I opted for the quicker option of inside inside dining.  Considering I like a more quiet atmosphere, I should have taken the patio dining instead.  Inside was very noisy, and it got worse the more people piled in.  It seems whoever built Yard House went with the industrial look but left out any soundproofing or noise control.  Yard House has over 150 beers to choose from, and I found an old favorite from my time in Germany; Kronenbourg 1664.  The appetizer-size of Guacamole and chips worked well for two but won't feed more.  I chose the Parmesan Crusted Pork Loin.  When it arrived, it was a BIG portion of two chops over sweet potato mash with a healthy side of asparagus.  Now THIS was DAMN GOOD!  The sweet potato ""mashed"" was a great counter to the savory chops.  Breading on the chops was light but covered well.  Over top, chefs drizzled a cherry sauce.  The asparagus was boiled just right, still crisp yet tender.  For an entree just over $20, I felt is was a great deal.  If the inside noise level wasn't so overbearing, I might have stuck around for a second or third beer.  I left with a tab just over $36 and satisfied, as it was a great dinner and more affordable than anything downtown.",PLn6Aa5dI1Ex_FONgxK8rw,0,0,4,f7BHXhcGSC_wHKcn4q4bxQ

After looking over the menu we decided to stay seeing that everyone was able to find something they could settle with for the late lunch.

I decided on the Lamb burger with the feta cheese which gave the burger a different and savory flavor.  The meat was tender and seasoned well.  The fries were these little toothpick looking things that were not as satisfying as they looked.  I guess I prefer a steak style fry something with a little more carbs I guess.  

The service was sufficient, a little slow at times but there was a football game on that allowed the time to pass.  However when you have a family the kids do not find equal enjoyment.

This place is usually great as it serves as a good place for grabbing a beer, watching sports, and eating some food.

This time,  I brought my wife and 2 yr old here and we had a little scary experience.
We ordered a kid's meal for my daughter with an apple juice.

Out comes this kids cup with what looks like a cloudy apple juice.  Of course my wife (who is pregnant ) tries our baby's drink beforehand, and then tells me it tastes bad.

I took a sip, and it tasted like BEER.   WTH.

So I flag our server, I ask if apple juice is supposed to have a 'fizzy' type taste with it at this restaurant.  She said no.  She brought the drink over to her manager across the room and I saw him smell into the cup and then walk away.  

A while later, we finally get the manager to our table, and he gave us this explanation:

""I dont know what happened, but it wasn't beer.  It looks like our apple juice just fermented.  I don't know how that is possible since we usually go through the juice pretty fast and replace it.   Anyways, this is new apple juice now from a new barrel.""  

That's pretty much it.  No, real apology on what Im almost sure was beer.  No offer for any discount on our food or anything.  Afterwards he just left.  As for the food, nothing out of the ordinary.

We ordered the lobster/crab/artichoke dip and the spicy tuna roll (which is not your typical cut roll. It's delicious art). They are must orders. We ate every bite.

After doing some retail therapy, we came into Yard House for some dinner. This place is set up beautifully; and it has a microbrewery inside of it so there are plenty of beer options available.

We were seated, and got a friendly attentive server- you can't beat that. I ordered the porchini Halibut with bok choy, asparagus, and mashed potatoes. This was ridiculously delicious, everything was flavorful and cooked perfectly. I also go a Moscow mule, and it was nice and strong.

I will definitely come back to try more of their dishes.",rypcWiSNGM0suWsiSLh9xA,3,2,5,zA87vRIIAArnBRgCwirFXg

First off, the wait time is well handled. We only had ten minutes to be seated and that was on a Saturday night.
Next, our server, Marshal A., was charming, accommodating, and super knowledgeable about the menu. Our food was timed perfectly and he anticipated our needs like a seasoned veteran.

The food was very good, but seemed to lack a little depth. I had the miso sea bass. Usually the sauce has more depth. I'm not holding it against them though and will order this yumminess again. VGK had just lost and everyone was a little effected.
My husband had the fried chicken and adored it. 
My daughter would like the gruyere back on the grilled cheese and tomato soup item. Blue cheese just doesn't rank and that item was why we chose Yardhouse in the first place.

I like it a little less than the one by the Linq because the service is just a little less up to par. The prices seem identical to other Yardhouses in the area and the atmosphere seems the same.

I do have one main complaint. My last time I was served here.My waiter seemed confused as to what I was saying as if I had a hearing problem. I asked for pepper for my chicken soup, and he thought I said the opposite.

He then promptly walked away without me having the chance to correct him. He never truly took the time to ensure our orders were correct. For instance, we were brought the wrong beer and had to have another server fix the mistake.

Unfortunately, I do not recall his name, but he was a young tall man with long hair. 

Although I just ranted about service, you must know that the food is incredible. I love the pork belly tacos, the crab cakes, and Thai chicken pizza. I'll always come back here for a good happy hour special.",YD7Akcx9ZmsCYJv7WlN5gw,1,1,4,B1D0dLek3aH0vA5z_UGGuw

Ambiance: 5 - This place had a good energy all around. The host greeted us and was helpful by explaining the happy hour menu. In the center of the restaurant is a bar and all around the room are TVs playing sports. At sunset, they added tea light candles to each table and I thought it had a very nice touch. I highly recommend going to this place if you're looking to watch a game or to have a date night here.

Service: 5 - If I could give higher stars than a 5 I would! Our waiter was incredibly helpful when we were ordering. There were times when it would take a while to get our food but he would make sure that we got our food hot and ready. I definitely would want to have him as my waiter the next time I eat there, if only I could remember his name haha. 

Food: 4 - I ordered the Hawaiian pizza and parmesan truffle fries. The Hawaiian pizza was a pretty large size and I was really satisfied with it. The only thing I didn't like about the pizza was it was very thin crust and soggy. I like to have my crust a little fluffy and if I do order thin crust I would like for the bread to have a crisp/crunch to it. The truffle fries were heaven!!! The portion was pretty decent and definitely worth paying for. It wasn't too oily, it had a little crunch, and the parmesan was added just right. I highly recommend ordering the truffle fries!

They've got their own microbrewed beer in two varieties and a great Late Night Happy Hour so prices are really good if you come in late for drinks or apps. Another thing I like is you can get a sample shot of any brew for a buck. Which is what I did as i sampled four different beers including Vegas' own Sin City. Bartender was actually upfront with me that it wasn't that great a beer but when in Vegas, try the local stuff and for a buck, why not? So I tried the Sin City Amber and it was fair alright but at least it wasn't downright atrocious. Surprisingly, Tenaya Creek isn't offered here. They should do something about that. Also odd. They carry Gordon Biersch. Don't they have their own brewpub just a couple miles away? Waste of taps in my opinion. Plenty of variety and a chance to really improve your brew knowledge.

Cons:
 * Super Packed
 * Slow Service

Tips:
* new on the menu : Ahi Sliders !

* Scan Life avail. for those with Smartphones... its on their coasters !!

Our server took our orders. When I ordered (Mac and cheese)2 our server asked if I knew what truffle is. I responded that I do he said ""and you like that?"" in a condescending tone. Again yes, then he said ""ok you'll you  like it then"". After a long wait our entrees were brought out... No appetizers. When I inquired about our appetizers the girl rolled her eyes and left. 
Still waiting.... I asked for server. After a bit I saw the manager and called him over. He told me the server forgot to put in the order for the appetizers. That he would make sure entrees were remade. 
Finally we got food...it was good. The manager stopped by to check on us but we noticed he didn't stop by any other table. 
They did in the end comp the meal but no one ever apologized for our negative experience.

Yard House is always my go-to and as you can tell from my check-ins, I also take friends here!    Different locations, same great food and service (which I have come to expect wherever I go now with YH).

Allow me break it down for you:
Happy hour is Mon-Fri 3pm-6pm, Sun-Wed 10pm-close

Domestic Pints - $3.50, Craft&Import Pints - $4.25-$4.75
Sliders served on a bed of fries  ($6.75): Classic, Bearnaise, Pastrami, Turkey, Veggie. Ahi is $9.95

Half priced pizzas: BBQ chicken, 4cheese, Ham & pineapple, Margherita, Pepperoni & Mushroom, Spicy Thai Chicken

Half priced apps: Crab cakes, Calamari, Cali Roll, Chinese Garlic Noodles, Chicken Nachos, Onion Ring Tower, Wings, Boneless wings, Veggie wings, Hawaiian Poke stack, Spicy tuna roll, Seared Ahi Sashimi, Chicken lettuce wraps, Fried chicken strips, spinach cheese dip, Moo Shu egg rolls

Doesn't that just BLOW your mind? It's like a plethora of cheap happy hour eats and you'll probably get full off of one order of sliders, or 2 of their apps. 

So far I've tried:
-Bearnaise sliders (Bearnaise sauce and fried shoestring onions on the patty w/ a side of very skinny fries that are tenderly cooked with a very light batter coating which gives them a perfectly crunchy exterior and ""juicy"" inside)
-BBQ chicken and Margherita pizzas (They pretty much taste as they should. Sometimes the BBQ chicken is a little too saucy for my taste though)
-calamari (Yum. Perfectly fried on the outside and melting on the inside. Served w/ marinara and, I wanna say tartar sauce? I usually go with the red..)
-Traditional wings (First and last time I had these, they were so spicy! My bf couldn't even handle them and he claims to love hot stuff, hehe. The thing that I don't like about these wings is that you can't choose how spicy you want them, so you have to be prepared for whatever they give you)

Everything I've tried has been pretty good so far and there is still so much more I have yet to try! I know my boyfriend has been having some sort of frenzy over the happy hour poke stack. He's gone to this location about 4 times in the past month, by himself, just to sit and eat the poke stack, so I can only guess how delicious it must be. 

Key points:
-Happy hour is awesome here
-Traditional wings are hot! (at least for me)
-Calamari is delectable
-French fries are close to perfect
-Great for groups
-Service has been pretty fast on the days that I've gone",AuvaQaRHBowFaFtoEMqkVg,0,0,4,JZsF-lDLQqUQLHOWotJSRQ

The last dozen times I've been to Yardhouse I know what I'm getting and it never fails to deliver. You go here to catch up with friends, watch a sporting event or sip some good booze. For what it does, it does it right and I love coming here. It's usually my place to go when I have friends or relatives visiting from out of town.

For appetizers you have to try their fairly new poke nachos. It's so Yardhouse to have a traditional bar food like nachos with their own twist (what's hotter than poke right now) but I am a fan! It's probably my new favorite appetizer now. If fresh fish is not your thing, the fish and chips are pretty good. I am not a fan of fried fish but hey, it's not too shabby. If fish is not your thing at all they have their fail-proof wings. Tastes like the type of wings you can expect from any urban bar eatery-greasy, spicy and all deliciousness. For entrees, their steaks and ribs are pretty good. It isn't steakhouse quality so it wouldn't be my first choice. In fact I'll probably order more appetizers the next time around. I feel like Yardhouse shines in their appetizers menu and they are more of a tapas bar to me with beer. Oh the beer, they have a wide selection of beer-local, domestic, international, you name it. My personal favorite right now is the Moose Drool.

All in all, this is a solid choice to catch a game, have a good time with friends or relatives. You really can't go wrong. Show up early because the place is always packed!",De-dImXf-TOFWWPTUWwIvw,0,0,4,oeYvoh1mT240DNruWbTKmA

Consistent service, food quality and love the ambiance. We stopped by here after the movies and it was 9:30pm. The late happy hour starts at 10pm so we opted to drink until 10pm and then put in our happy hour order. Yard House has a fabulous happy hour with a variety of options for drinks and food. So worth it to check out the happy hour here. There is a regular happy hour and then a late happy hour. We were ecstatic to catch the late happy hour. Prices for apps are almost half off.

Our server was Jordan. He had an awesome sense of humor because I made a comment about his name and said, ""Jordan like NKOTB Jordan?"" He laughed and said, ""Why NKOTB? I prefer Jordan like Michael Jordan!"" Good save. He was friendly, accommodating, and funny. 

My friend noted they had Lindeman's Framboise which is one of my favorites!!! So I asked the server to do half Framboise and half Hoegaarden beer. Trust me, it's a pretty perfect balance without too much sweetness of the Framboise. We call this drink a Dirty Ho on the east coast, Yard House calls it a Rose Garden. 

Always always always get the Poké Nachos here. I dream about this stuff. I'm so obsessed actually that after the first two times I had it, I just had to recreate the dish at home. It's that good! And happy hour price is even better.

We also got the BBQ Chicken Pizza which was solid. The Vampire Taco was good but only took a bite because we were all so full. The mini sliders were tasty and juicy. Love the string fries, it's the perfect size to munch on. Our friends got wings which wasn't special but still consistent and good. 

Downside to this particular visit was the air conditioning was down and it was warm as hell. Might as well have sat outside because you at least get fans out there. But everything was still good and our server Jordan rocked so it was all good.",7xwLiQx0-lCOXBUDAcazZA,2,1,5,esKu9fRLul3VAAlbvGz7jg

I was very disappointed in the dish; which my waitress suggested to be her favorite. My best friend ordered the orange chicken. And by his constant comments on how we should have just went to Panda Express across the way, I can only judge that he didn't think it was very great either. We were both let down by our food and overall experience (like waiting 15 minutes for a water refill AFTER we asked for one).

We have gone just us, we have taken my mom, and also taken the kids for a family event. 
A couple of my favorite dishes include the Jambalaya, the garlic noodles, and the spicy tuna roll. The jambalaya actually has a spice! I hate it when places skimp out on dishes that are suppose to burn a little. 
The sushi rolls come as one big roll. A layer of rice, then a layer of fish, wasabi, tempura etc. The presentation is so nice you don't want to eat it. 
My biggest issue when dining here is not getting a soup, salad, appetizer, main entree, and dessert. I suggest going with someone you don't ming sharing with because you will want to try theirs too!

If you love beer and some great food, you must try this place.  They serve fresh fish every day and it's cooked to order.  We always have the fresh fish when we eat dinner there.  Lunch time is usually something else, like their mac n cheese squared or some sliders.  What I enjoy about this place is their variety of foods, from american to asian.  

Want to save money and still eat well?  Their appetizers could be a meal in itself!  They are huge portions and things like chicken strips come with fries, anyway, so you can always order a beer and save money on the food. I really do love eating here and haven't tried everything on the menu yet.  I'm looking forward to more culinary adventures here soon!

Some great tips: always ask your server about their favorite beers, or what beer they prefer from lagers, stouts, etc.  They are well versed in their beer and usually their preference is really good.  Another thing--their portions are big, so if you're a small eater order one dish for 2 people.  Seating can take awhile in the evenings, so coming in around 830/9pm may help seat you sooner.  If you want to eat dinner between 5-7 and you can't find parking, just use the valet right next to the restaurant side of town square.  It's open till the early morning and saves tons of time on finding that open space.",o68A_3bAJTge-ioGXHdxKA,1,1,4,8FN4etSIcsPmKvGqhnyFTA

I just moved to vegas and I must say that this place is top notch, a definite for me, I miss the Flying Saucer, luckily I have this place whenever I need my beer fix.

Shrimp Ceviche - 3.5 Stars - Normally full of shrimp and fruit, but this time the shrimp was lacking, so to me it was more of a fruit ceviche. Still full of flavor and seasoned well, just lacking on the main ingredient.

Shrimp Caesar Salad - 4 Stars - 4 Jumbo Shrimp cooked perfectly. Nice and tender and full of flavor. Perfect amount of cheese crisps and croutons, only lacking was the amount of dressing. 

Spinach Cheese Dip - 5 Stars - Always awesome and full of flavor. The chips work so well with the dip and the portion size is perfect.

Angel Hair Pasta w/ Shrimp - 5 Stars - Pasta cooked perfectly. Sauce is on point and full of flavor. Large amount of shrimp. Portion size is perfect for sharing.

Turkey Pot Pie 3.5 Stars - First time having this dish here and was expecting a little more from the dish. The puff pastry was underdone, so it was greasy and not very edible. There were far too many leeks in the dish, so it tasted like turkey and onions which is not bad for me since i love onions, but it was just lacking in other flavors. On a positive note, there was a ton of turkey, so that was a huge positive.

Salted Caramel Pudding - 5 Stars - Can never get enough go this dessert. Always good, just wish it was a bit larger of a portion.",nHc2XXcOLpeUH_mkgUeWDQ,0,0,4,8xrKlHW9qVHuhpSQ1tyclg

I was sad to find no happy hour, but that was my bad for going so late. :[ This meant that I had to pay full price for my appetizers? I haven't done that in...well, ever. 

Since I had to DD, I ordered a plate of fish and chips. I must admit, those were some pretty good fish and chips. It's not THE best I've ever had (check out my Mad Greek review for that), but it is definitely up there.  

I was surprised to find out that their last call is at 1:45.  It reminded me of being in California.  I didn't think any place in Vegas had such an early last call, but since they close (what? they close?) at 2, it makes sense.  

Despite us being there so late, I didn't feel rushed to leave.  I truly appreciate that because so many places are egging you to leave when it comes to the last 15 minutes of business hours.  Instead, they started to clean up around us, close up the bar, etc, but our waiter still came by to see if there was anything else we needed or wanted and even came by past last call just to double check we didn't want anything else.

We gave it a few months and decided to return for another try. We were seated promptly but I wish they would get rid of the tables and just have booths because sitting at a table makes you feel like you are on display! The beer was excellent as usual but this is the first time in probably 40 times we have been here that the service was really bad. I think everyone was having the same problem because I watched some people get up and go to the bar to order their own drinks or chase down their waitress. Perhaps they were understaffed that day or they just had a bunch of retards working! The food was slow but good. I had the fried chicked and my wife had the fish taco plate. Both were cooked to our liking - even though they came to our table on the slow boat!

First off, our server Zack, waited a very long time before he even came to our table, and when he did, he complained about the amount of tables he already had. My friends and I then order the chicken tenders requesting bbq and hot sauce on the side his response was ""can you remind me when the food comes out? The kitchen won't do that, I'll have to do it."" Why don't you be a little proactive and get it so our food won't get cold while you're fetching the sauce we orders ahead of time. My friend order Korean short rib tacos, a dish she has had many times. When the food came out she questioned it and the severs argued with her telling her it was correct. One even told her to take a bite to double check. They sent out a replacement taco, which looked completely different from the original. Zack still continued to argue it was still correct after the fact, we requested a manager to come over. As soon as the manager looked he said that is a pork belly taco, we then explained out concerns of the entire evening. He then confirmed that the tacos were entered wrong and that he removed them off the bill, he also took 50% off the tab.

I seriously love this place. The restaurant has such a chill and laid back vibe. It's huge and has ample seating. They have nice cushiony booths so if you and a date come by then you can have a semi-romantic dinner on one of those. Want to sit outside? They have a nice patio area in which they have heaters for the chillier days. They have TVs all over the place with different channels. Games are on most of the time. If you want to watch a specific game on a specific TV, all you have to do is ask.

I'm not a big beer person. But Yard House is the one place I will indulge in a glass (or two...or three...). My favorite beer is the Lindeman's Framboise. A Belgian lambic beer, it has the perfect cidery raspberry taste. They serve it in some sort of champagne glass - it makes me want to pinky up because I feel almost sophisticated drinking it! I also love their fruit ciders, especially their pear cider. The Snakebite is also divine - it's a blend of the pear cider and harp. Besides their beer, they have pretty good specialty mixed drinks. One that comes to mind is their Pomegranate Margarita. Tart and pomegranite-y with a pretty presentation!

Their food awesome! My faves are listed below:

[Before i list specific food items, I'd like to say that Yard House has really really good fries. They're super thin and super addicting. If you're into the thick cut steak fries, you won't find them here]

Appetizers
- Seared Ahi Sashimi: About 6 pieces of seared tuna covered in soy vinaigrette is served next to a small bed of red cabbage also covered in the vinaigrette. I really like this dish when it's made right. Sometimes they over-drench the sashimi pieces and the dish becomes ultra salty.
- Onion Ring Tower: Literally, the name says it all. It's apparently beer battered and comes with a chipotle ketchup and ranch dressing. 
- Spicy Tuna Roll: If you're expecting a typical sushi roll, then don't. This is served without rice and as a stack. Bottom layer are edamame and cucumbers. Middle layer is your tuna and the top layer is the avocado. It's a pretty dish. Very innovative. 
- Sliders: Specifically the bearnaise or ahi sliders. Four sliders plus a handful of fries. They call this an appetizer, but the portions are not appetizer-like!

Entree
- Mac & Cheese squared: Chicken, bacon, mushrooms, truffle oil. Can't go wrong with this one. They use wild mushrooms that elevated your boring mac & cheese to the next level. 
[This is it for entrees. I usually stick with their appetizers.]

Dessert
- Chocolate souffle: Small souffle good for one. Scoop of vanilla ice cream on top with mint garnish. Do not leave without trying this. I'm seriously serious. 

Yard House has great happy hour. 3 PM - 6 PM Monday - Friday and 10 PM - close Sunday - Thursday. Drink specials and half off on a lot of their appetizers! Their sliders are discounted as well. Perfect late night meal.",1EvZSNmhYmyPIElblCeMdA,0,0,4,p0uHbKtBMiaSemdSZLzT6A

As it's a bar at Town Square I thought the food would be average but not much more.

I just ordered a grilled cheese with French fries instead of the tomato bisque that it usually comes with.
OMG ! The best grilled cheese I've eaten in the whole US so far ! It was made with 4 different kinds of cheeses : Fontina, Gorgonzola, Cheddar and Swiss. Made with artisan bread and also slices of roasted tomatoes. Perfectly grilled with the running melted cheeses. Sooooo good !
The French fries were cut very thin so they were very crispy, not fattening at all and so much better than the big ones with skin you usually get. 
So that small ""nothing special"" meal turns out to be simply great !

I have to say we were a party of 8 and everybody loved their meal. Pasta, tuna, tacos, grilled salmon, no left overs.

Look at the pictures to see the sizes of the draft beers. Humongous !

The only thing we didn't go crazy for was desert. We mostly had Crème Brûlée. But it had bananas on top of it instead of the usual crispy caramelized sugar and chocolate at the bottom. Not exactly what we expected. Good but definitely not to ""die"" for like the rest of our meal...",kG2muG7eit_AzZMcBCMArQ,15,10,4,M2apEN7ZP3CiUP4E-j_wbA

They have a BUNCH of Vegetarian options here! It's amazing. Veggie ""Beef"" Sliders.. ""Chicken"" Rice Bowl.. Spicy ""Chicken"" Sandwich.. (that's what I got.. Mostly because I've always wanted to say ""Can I get the spicy chicken sandwich please?"" I've never been able to say that before!). Its the Gardein substitute for meat, a gluten-free, soy-based protein that is supposed to duplicate the flavor/taste/texture of meat. I thought it was delish. Moist and Very filling. The aioli was great too. Don't be afraid of the cabbage (I was, I hate cabbage). It's a thin layer, quite sparse and the other flavors conceal the cabbage anyway. I'm not sure if this is a NV thing or a new feature at the chain, bc the last one I went to in So Cal didn't have that many veggie options (they had the regular amount, just not a half of a page in the menu dedicated to soy protein (fake meat) dishes!!

I'd love to give them 5 stars, I really wanted to. The staff was friendly, they called when the order was ready (I picked up), they even had the water I requested all ready to go...

Restaurant was packed so we went to the bar. We had our beers poured. I had the ACE PINEAPPLE cider. Really crisp and refreshing.
My buddies ordered two burgers and I got the Mac and cheese. Biggest regret right there. My gut told me burger but I was craving something different. The description said chicken and bacon in it. Well if you count three tiny cut up pieces of bacon as an addition to a dish....
There was more bacon on my deviled eggs than my whole Mac and cheese bowl.....
The noodles were crunchy and undercooked. The Mac and cheese sauce was dry and wasn't creamy. Kinda just molded to the undercooked pasta. 

I did the universal sign of pushing my plate forward to hint to the bartender that it wasn't good. Well see that's the problem. With so many bartenders on we didn't know who was serving us. I swear we had 5 different people taking care of us....yet no one noticed a full plate of food pushed forward. Did not appreciate not knowing who was taking care of us. 

The only way we got a managers attention (assume the managers wear white) was that my buddy literally screamed HELP! to gain some attention. That's sad. She came over and asked what was wrong and I told her and she offered me something else. Honestly with ticket times and the fact my two buddies were done eating I just wanted to leave. I feel stupid bringing them here especially because they were here for only one night :(

The check said Beatriz on it but again really didn't know who was helping me. I prob will never come back to this location. It is not a good representation of the brand.

But there's a lot more to be had. Like all Yard House menus, the variety spans from Americana to Asian in one giant menu. It's like Cheesecake Factory, but pricier and vastly higher quality. If there is a place to enjoy a killer selection of beer, while ordering everything from Hawaiian Poke to Korean Kalbi to Shrimp Ceviche, let it be here.

As a venue, this Yard House is stacked. A robust wait staff, plenty of seating all around, with TVs lining the ceilings and corners and game audio for a crowded Monday Night Football viewing. Who ever said this side of Vegas (Town Square) was boring? Certainly not I.

My hungry and tired of group of frenzy eaters ordered a plethora of random stuff, just as their menu intended:

Chicken Lettuce Wraps ($12)
Kung Pao Calamari ($11)
Seared Ahi Sashimi ($14)
Boneless Wings ($13)
Hawaiian Poke Stack ($14)
Turkey Club ($11)
Spicy Tuna Roll ($13)

All in all, everything was decent. The chicken lettuce wraps were fresh, tasty, and abundant. Wasn't the biggest fan of the kung pao calamari, but folks looking for a different take on fried squid ought to try it once. While the turkey club, boneless wings, and spicy tuna roll (which looked like mofongo!) were somewhere in the middle, the seared ahi and poke stack were the surprising winners of the night. Extra surprising that it tasted like fresh fish all while in the middle of the desert? Most definitely.

While I'm not one to frequent chains, I can see myself coming back to this Yard House with beer loving, sports seeking, hungry, good company. Lastly, it's a solid spot that is  within 2 minutes away from McCarran International Airport.",ysCBsXWPB-LAiewVS3jZfQ,4,4,4,_x3lAh5HPxnsqwGJ8EIqyg

They use a meat substitute called gardein and it can be used in any of their dishes but they even have a section of the menu devoted to all of their vegetarian dishes. I decided to choose the chicken & veggie bowl with jasmine rice.. I expected it to be like a teriyaki sauce, but I have to admit that was my own assumption... In spite of not being sweet like I expected, it was a very delicious meal that I thoroughly enjoyed. My friend ordered the veggie chicken strips with a side of sweet potato fries.

Yardhouse is a beer aficionado's dream come true. With over 100+ beers on tap I am sure you will find something that ya like. 

I strongly recommend coming in during happy hour. Weekdays from 3-7 and 10-close (except for Fridays) means almost all of their appetizers are half off, on top of that, they have $7 sliders, and cheap pizzas as well. The classic rock and continuously flowing drinks make this place a perfect place to hang out and chill if you want to go out with friends.

The food here is usually a step above the bar food found at similar establishments. Yes they do have nachos, pizza, but they have more adventurous fare such as hummus and pita, double stacked chicken enchiladas, tuna tar tar, and so on. I will give them props for food that you wouldn't think they would. But the thing that makes this place amazing, like a few other fellow yelpers mentioned is the... TURKEY BURGER! I don't know what they do to they turkey, but they make it delicious. Succulent turkey paired with herbs, cheeses and thin slithers of roma tomatoes make this one of the best turkey burgers I have had. Definitely give it a try.

Of course one of the coolest things about all Yardhouses is what I call the keg exhibition. Ever Yardhouse has a large room where they store the 100+ kegs in cold ice-cold fridge. Large windows allow pass-er-bys to gawk at the beauties. 

The location in Town Square is similar to the other ones around the country. A standard restaurant space consisting of booths and tables. A large central bar in the middle, and a ton of pipes which make the draft beers possible.",ALw8EN21lby0vWtfD6JfIw,2,1,4,AJ3ai-ZS2FeBb1oaJlv6eQ

This time of year, I base my dining options on outdoor seating availability.  I'll sit outside when it's 105.  I love fresh air!

Anyway, a few of us stopped in for a drink & a snack one night.  The service was blah, she mixed up our beers (dark & light) & the food blah as well.  Calamari boring.  Spinach Dip, too much pre chopped, undercooked garlic flavor.  Blah.  

Having enjoyed it in CA we thought to give it another try.  This time we took the in-laws in town from the UK.  They were in need of a good pint or two.  Our experience was a lot better this time.  Our server was still a little blah, as if she wasn't comfortable interacting with her tables.  She was fairly competent at least.  The food was good for it being a chain.  In fact it's probably the best chain food out there, but truthfully I just go for the beer.

We all only ordered appetizers, and it took as long as it did for someone to take our order to get our food.  Not only that, they forgot about one of our appetizers.

The ambiance is cozy for sports enthusiasts and beer connoissers.  They have about 150 different beers on tap which is impressive. I sat at the bar and had one of the beers on tap. After looking thru their extensive beer menu, I ordered the Sin City Light; it was good. It's about $6 for a beer. So for the most part, the bar is what makes the place; along with all the flat screen TVs mounted throughout.

As a restaurant...they need A LOT of work. I ordered the Roast Beef Dip. A simple dish (it's a sandwich for crying out loud), how can anyone get that wrong...Au Jus was too salty. That's what makes the sandwich! Also, they need to melt the provolone in the sandwich. They just slapped on a cold piece of cheese! One of my friends had the Porter House Steak. She had ordered it medium, but she realized as she was cutting into the steak that it was a little on the rare side. Once she pointed that out to our non-attentive waiter, he did take the steak back and correct it. The manager even brought it back out to her and apologized for that and did not charge for her entree. That was nice of him... My cousin had the lettuce wraps. I didn't try them, but he says that the wraps were really good. My brother had the Ahi salad. He liked it. The prices on their food menu are comparable to that of a Chilis or Chevy's.

Now about our waiter...Seems like he was trying to avoid us the whole time we were there. The sad thing is that he was also training someone on the floor that night; what a good example he is setting for the trainee! We had to wave him down a couple of times for drinks and a couple times for condiments. Come to think of it, we didn't even get place settings until after our food arrived. We had to ask another waiter for that! He only came by to check on us once, and that was the same time he slapped us the bill.",0W_z7mfRic4MzIUmniocHw,3,2,2,TMAbv_cLPBHNN-ni8m5Arg

We were intrigued with the very positive reviews and over 100 beers on draft!!!

The location is tucked within the Town Square near the airport and south of the strip. We walked in and were amazed to see all of the kegs behind the windows!  There were several people seated in the lobby area but we inquired about sitting at the bar and she told us we were welcome to sit there as it was open seating and she stated if we had any difficulties finding a seat to come back and let her know. 

We were able to find two chairs at the bar and were immediately greeted with drink and food menus.  We were definitely impressed by the beer and menu options!  We decided to order the queso appetizer, it is served with both chips and flour tortillas.

My wife ordered the two taco entree which came with rice and beans while I ordered the carnivore pizza. The interior is very clean and comfortable and it was fun to sit at the bar and watch the Saints and Vikings game.

Mac & Cheese- very cheesy/creamy, bits of bacon and a truffle glaze
Ahi- Seared Ahi drenched in a Chinese black bean sauce with crisp basil on a bed of brown rice.
these items are a must try!

***Young's Double Chocolate Stout- omg its desert in a glass.
***Big Sky Moose Drool- a creamy, slightly hoppy beer you could pair it with anything
***House Honey Blonde- the perfect summer beer. amazingly refreshing
***Sam Adams Cherry Wheat-  The best Sam Adams has to offer! a bright cherry flavored wheat beer with a crisp finish.. DELISH!

I usually stop by here on my way home from work or before a night out.

Some other favorites are the Mac and Cheese, sans bacon. I know! I know, the horror!  Calamari is also pretty tasty, as well as the chicken appetizer with peanut sauce. I'll also often order a cup of clam chowder (with Tabasco, of course)

Service is usually good. The servers attitudes are sometimes better than the food runners. I've had plates slung at me...I laughed it off on all accounts, it's a tough job, I get it. They try to keep drinks filled, sometimes they succeed. Better at keeping the alcohol flowing than the water, if you get my drift aka $$. 

Some of my family's favorites are chicken fingers (kids menu), their fries, spicy tuna roll & California roll (two of my faves), seared ahi sashimi, Pastrami Sliders & the chicken lettuce wraps. Mac n Cheese is AMAZING, but I usually allow myself to order it once a year- it's so rich. Also, loved the Lobster Garlic Noodle; it's a special occasion dish, too! Any of their salads are good.

The restaurant is huge inside with outdoor seating!! I like sitting outside during fall/spring time frame and definitely indoors during winter and summer. It's a laid back chill environment that's good for everyone. The ambient lighting is good for that kind of romantic feeling if you want it to be, but also just to relax and chill. 

I'm here for Happy Hour with a bunch of friends usually, we used to frequent this place at least once a week, now not so much as we're getting tired of the same ol' thing, lol. 

I like trying something different every time I come here as far as the draft beer goes. I've tried almost everything and found some of my favorite types through doing this! Just gotta keep an open mind and be willing to try something new in order for this to work out! Amber ales have been my favorites, followed by stouts, and then lagers, but I've also been spoiled by what's on tap and now I stay away from bottled beer as much as possible! It really does taste different.

With my friends and I, we usually just stick around to what's on the appetizer menu, because they're half off during Happy Hour. Some of our favorites include the Chicken Nachos, Chicken Tenders, Seared Ahi Sashimi, Sliders, Spinach artichoke dip, and pizza. You'll almost always see these items on our table from the Happy Hour menu. Other items we usually end up ordering are the Truffle Fries and the Mac & Cheese. The portions are decent for the appetizers and good for sharing, especially the Chicken Nachos. 

It's good for just all around hang out with a bunch of friends to just relax and catch up. I don't usually do large groups at other places, but here it's fine, because it does get pretty loud.",dM1HHK4szA5Qs6NSAaEk1Q,1,1,4,OOefaT8QnDr9JmKtmclViA

We always came as a big group (between 10 and 24) and the staff was always accommodating from putting tables together to separating each and every single check. 

Their happy hour menu features quite a selection. Their chicken nachos were always popular for the guys in our group. The serving is huge so it can definitely be shared by 4-6 people. Onion ring tower is delicious, it comes with ranch and some other sauce. The other sauce is delicious, I just don't know what it is. The garlic chicken noodles is my favorite thing on their happy hour menu, it has a lot of flavor and is definitely good enough for a meal even though it's listed as an appetizer. My friends have ordered almost all the pizzas their and they're nothing special. Although I am from New York so I'm a pizza snob lol. Spinach dip is also yummy but very rich. 

Our favorite drinks are the ciders especially the pear and raspberry ones. My friends have ordered  many different kinds of ales, beers, etc and have enjoyed each and every one. 

Recently, we came for lunch and I ordered their lunch special. It consisted of either a pizza or sandwich with soup or salad. I had the pastrami sandwich with clam chowder. The pastrami sandwich lacked cheese and mustard but did come served with jalapeños. It was good but not quite what I expected. The clam chowder was yummy and I wished I had just ordered that by itself.

My big problem with this place, though, is the beer pricing. If you come during happy hour, fine, the prices are clearly stated on the menu. And actually, during happy hour, the beers are priced fairly, not really cheap, but fair, and the happy-hour appetizers are great deals and delicious. 
But if you come outside of happy hour, there are no prices listed for beers. There are hundreds of beers and they all are priced differently. Asking a waiter brings a vague response: ""The most expensive one is $8.50 so most of them are less than that."" But they ain't much less! It's easy to spend $7 on a pint without realizing it. So...insist that the waiter give you the price of each beer before you order. Or, better plan, come only during happy hour.",BN3x4SwBCufyzkd7FuvAOQ,0,0,3,bU_5lQ8USvKOe_5AQJYt1g
3455241,2012-10-09,0,A5Rkh7UymKm0_Rxm9K2PJw,"Yard House is the perfect place to have lunch or dinner at after watching a  movie. I've been here twice but my last visit was when I actually tried their food.  Every time I visit it's always crowded, especially on nights when there's a football game on, which was the reason why my friends and I waited for over 15 minutes, but this wasn't a problem.

Yard House has a huge menu that begins with several pages dedicated to beers and other alcoholic beverages. They have a good selection of foods to order. I particularly liked the section where you can sub dishes containing meat with soy.

FOOD

+ Baja Fish: Two fried fish tacos topped with shredded cabbage, pico de gallo, guacamole, and sriracha ailoi. This also comes with a side of beans and rice, but I opted for steamed vegetables instead. The tacos were good and have a little spice to them.  I didn't enjoy the flour tortillas. I prefer corn over flour any day when it comes to fish tacos. I also didn't like how small the tacos were, though I learned that you can order more than the two you receive; however, any extras will cost you an additional $5. I'm glad I inquired about this since our waiter didn't mention this when I was asking him questions about ordering additional tacos. 

Originally I wanted just the beans and no rice, but our waiter said that counts as one side. I asked if the reason why it's considered as one side is because the beans and rice are mixed together. He said ""no"" and that it's just the restaurant's policy. He also said he could go ask the kitchen if what he said is correct, but he wasn't in a hurry to do that and just stood there waiting for me to make an order after I said it would be cool if he'd ask. (ok then, forget it!). So I chose steamed veggies instead over the stir fry option. I like steamed vegetables, but the veggies I received were watery and disgusting. 

+ Chicken Nachos: My generous friend offered to share her humongous plate of Chicken Nachos since the two little fish tacos I consumed didn't satiate me. The nachos are topped with chunks of chicken, guacamole, cheese, sour cream, beans, and onions. The nachos tasted better than my tacos, but I disliked how there was fat and skin left on the chunks of chicken. Not cool.

SERVICE
No problem with the servers or hostess, but we were displeased with our waiter.

+ I understand that the place was packed when we visited, but our waiter didn't come to our table until 10 minutes after we were seated. We ordered our beverages and it took  five minutes for him to return with our drinks. 

+ When I was finished with my food (plate empty, utensils down, and me sitting there not eating indicates I am finished eating), he came to our table three times, looked at our table, said nothing, then walked away. When he returned for the fourth time he asked me if I was done eating in which I replied with ""yes"", then finally took my plate away.

+ He called my friend ""bro"" when SHE asked for another glass of beer. I guess her side ponytail, makeup, and her magenta pants really screams ""bro"".

+ As I've previously mentioned, he didn't bother returning to the kitchen to inquire about the question I had about the beans and rice that came with my tacos, and he also tried to get me to buy more tacos without explaining to me that I'll be charged extra. I understand  that it's implied that additional food costs more, but it should also be mentioned because that's just good, honest customer service. 

OVERALL

I can see myself making another visit to Yard House, but I'll have to skip on the fish tacos and the mediocre service, which I hope I won't have to experience again.",epkRB3J_oBEiyiwahvdmGg,1,0,3,d2JD1clQJeadmKqlCZeyDQ
3456017,2015-06-02,2,A5Rkh7UymKm0_Rxm9K2PJw,"The service was great considering how busy it was hence the 1 star I give this place. The food was 0 stars. Other than that, I would have given this place no stars. I ordered the angel hair pasta, my bf ordered the dip with a side of sweet potato fries and our friend ordered a grilled chicken sandwhich with broccoli. When all of our orders came out, I tried the fries and they were cold. I mentioned it to my boyfriend and when he touched his sandwhich, it was also cold. I thought that was a bit weird, but when my friend took a bite if his sandwhich he said his chicken was also cold. I was thinking, maybe because it's a sandwhich, it wouldn't be that warm even though my bf ordered the roast beef dip. So, I took a bite of my pasta and my pasta was dry, bland, and COLD. It seemed like they left it out for a long time because the pasta was kind of stale. It was by far the worst meal I have eaten. No one in my party enjoyed their cold food. The food is over priced and they serve cold food. What I did notice yesterday night because I was sitting in front of the kitchen, was the food was coming out fast, but the food was standing there forever. I saw 4 dishes waiting there to be picked up for roughly 10 min. No wonder the food was getting cold! Not enough runners to even bring the food out. Horrible way to manage a business that can't have enough staff to bring out orders. I will never return here for the food.

There was a football game going on.. USC against I forgot (but obviously not important to the likes of USC), and enough seats to go around. 
Wasn't hungry even though the people around me eating some pretty damn good-looking food.

I was here for the drinks. Do people really drink this early in the day? Hell yes!
There is probably one drink that I look forward to the most. Not many people know it, and very few bartenders can make it to perfection.

And it's called the 'LA Water.""

First about 6-9 months ago they changed there fries and if you read reviews everyone always loved the small fries and then you could make them truffle and they were bomb.com but now there fries are nothing more than the same thing you would find at your local jack in the box. Next is they have changed the happy hour menu so some of the favorites are no longer on their like noodles and bone in wings and a few other items . These changes kinda hurt my feelings a little lol

Now on to the good! They still have a lot of items on happy hour and just recently they changed it to half off the happy hour menu vs having a tiered pricing which is nice. The portion size of all their food is good and the pricing is fair , also they are a full brewery so you can get your drink on and be happy. Another thing I like is the atmosphere, it's casual with a lot of tv's so you can go catch a game or have a date night or even just grab a snack before you head to the club, This place meets every criteria . My favorites are the carnivore pizza and the sliders, and I like to order a onion ring tower and add the onion rings to my slider so I kinda create my own slider lol.",PB1PY4NhNu1bNwQCEUcFQQ,3,4,4,0bgDmNy-GxKZidSx3NHWOw
3577074,2015-03-23,0,A5Rkh7UymKm0_Rxm9K2PJw,"Just got back from a dinner here with my girlfriend and while things started out nice, they were pretty bad by the end.

We arrived and they were moderately busy.  We were seated quickly though and our server, Kerry G, arrived quickly and was very personable and quick to come back to us for ordering.  My girlfriend got a cheeseburger and fries and the Hawaiian Five O drink, I got the vampire tacos dish and asked for no guacamole, and we split an order of boneless buffalo wings.

The wings came pretty quick and our server even brought over some extra ranch.  As far as the taste goes, they were OK.  Not the best I've had and not the worst.  The sauce was decent but with only a burst of heat up front and I'm not quite a fan of either the breading or how they fried them -- not sure which.  My girlfriend really liked her Hawaiian Five O drink.

Then began a long wait for our entrees.  We noted that a table of 4 right next to us ordered at the same time and got their food far before us.  A few minutes after they got their food Kerry came over to us and told us our food was cooking and would be out soon, then asked if we were in any type of time crunch.  We said no, thinking we still had 40 minutes to make a movie at the AMC theater upstairs.

10 minutes or so after this our food finally arrived and Kerry noted that they had tried to give him the tacos with guacamole on it.  I surmise they made the order wrong the first time and he just never told us about it until then.

My girlfriend liked her burger but didn't care for the fries.  I tried them and thought they were pretty good, however.  My tacos were very ho-hum.  They were carnitas and bacon chorizo with cilantro in a cheese-crusted taco shell.  Cilantro dominated the tacos, however, and I could barely taste the carnitas and only got one bite where I clearly detected the bacon chorizo.  The rice on the side was the best part of the meal -- a good portion of it, slightly sweet and spicy.  Something I've never really had with tacos but it was good.  The beans were very bland and a surprisingly small portion.

Kerry came to check on us again, but at the end of the meal we ended up waiting at least 10 minutes for the check while Kerry was in the vicinity and I met his eyes several times.  Even after he finally came over and we told him we wanted the check it took another 3 or 4 minutes to get it.  Finally we were able to pay and leave but it was over an hour after we first arrived and we missed the showtime for the movie.

Good service at the start, bad service at the end, and food that ranged from average to bleh.",ykWNHp1RXcmx6PYH921UrQ,0,0,2,4ffNy4Q7Tn3yIBL-PsU6hg

The most recent visit was after a disastrous experience at the Gordon Biersch down the street (See Review). I am willing to admit that my disgust with GB's could have influenced this particular visit to Yard House, but after all, the right time and the right place are also factors by which we develop opinions.

I had two items off the happy-hour appetizer menu, the Seared Ahi Tuna and the Spicy Tuna Roll.

The bartender kindly warned me that the Spicy Tuna Roll was presented in a completely different manor than I was probably used to, offering my a bit of his personal insight to allow me an opportunity to rethink my decision. But I am a culinary warrior with the self-proclaimed fortitude that has catapulted me toward some of the worlds greatest food discoveries - and I was not about to be deterred by unconventionalism.

The presentation was unusual, to say the least. But this work of art was visionary delight, in a castle of tuna, a delightfully mild wasabi sauce and a number of items I wont embarrass myself trying to identify. It was almost too beautiful to want to breach the walls of this incredible castle, but the urge to sample its goods was too tempting. I can say, although its taste resembled a spicy tuna roll in many ways, it uniqueness made it truly a one of a kind item.

The Seared Ahi Tuna, which I had had before, was delicious as always and its presentation rivaled that of its chivalrous brother.

I am truly blessed to be within a stones throw of Yard House. I suggest you stop in some time - you might just see me there.",pWEzY3YY0zEAJLlGSSucrQ,0,0,5,6NRhelOsEOMFkRUQxgrn0g

Overall the food tasted pretty great and if you during Happy Hour I really think it's hard to beat this level of food for this price. A lot of places serve really small portions for their lunch specials or Happy Hour but I think this place does it right and gives you huge portions hoping you stay around long enough to drink up a nice tab. I for one am willing to fall into this trap any day of the week as long as their food stays on point. Last star is missing because although the service was acceptable it wasn't star worthy.

It is huge - the layout is fantastic. Booths line the walls so you can have a great view pretty much no matter where you sit. The tables which line the area between the booths and the centered bar are spaced well enough to accomodate large parties as well as not wreck the view from the bar or the booths. The outdoor seating wraps around the outer perimeter of the restaurant, so if you don't mind sitting in 100 degree heat, there are patio options as well.
The HH rocks. Great food specials and beer and wine specials. We sampled quite a few of the appetizers and they were pretty tasty. 
For Vegas, it's hard to find a place that's not sooo overpriced you can't get a snack for a reasonable price. You must know me to know how important snacks are :)

THE BEERS: the main reason why I commute well across town to Town Square.  The Yardhouse, aside from the Freakin' Frog on Maryland Pkwy, has the most impressive variety of beers available that I have ever seen.  They have all kinds of different types of beer for every type of palate and for 3.50 domestics and 4.50 goblets/specialty beer mixes during happy hour, that is definitely hard to beat.  I did mention happy hour and I will also mention that happy hour is the best time to go (10 to close Sun-Wed and I'm not sure of the mid-day happy hour but I know there is one).  Select appetizers are half off during happy hour and they even have well drink specials for the spirit and hard liquor lovers out there.  All in all, I must say that the Yardhouse is one of my favorite hangouts and they usually never cease to impress.  I say usually because they did get rid of one of my favorite beers (the Kulmacher Eisbock for those interested) but I guess they have another hundred beers to choose from to help console my woes.

Some may sleep on this gem because of its location. When you think of dining inside of a shopping area and you are not shopping, it can be a deterrent. It's no fun to push through crowds and fight for parking just for a drink or meal. Yard House sits in a class by itself and begs you to push beyond that way of thinking and here's why. Valet parking is available. There's great food choices for every palette and an extensive drink menu that's should be categorized as the winos bible. 

This place is huge. But apparently, not big enough! We pushed our way through a crowd waiting for tables to the bar area. After all, why wait when you don't have to. The bar area offers the perfect view. It sots in the center of the room. It was rectangular shaped with tons of TVs and plenty of seating. Upon sitting, we were immediately greeted by Mitch. Before he could slid a coaster, I inquired about a cider on tap. To my surprise, there were at least six to choose from. Mitch did a good job of describing the makeup of each one which was very helpful. While sipping, I decided to look at the menu (while I could still see). It was huge! .... And admittedly, I am somewhat skeptical of places with tons of options. But, again, Yard House delivered. For starters, we ordered the lobster and crab dip. It was served with a sea of pita bread and chips. The dip was blended with just the right amount of cheese. Each bite was packed with lobster or crab and it was seasoned. More cheese please! I ordered the Mac n Cheese House Favorite (chicken breast and bacon filled pasta served in a mixture of cheeses). It was delicious. Too much to eat in one sitting. If you are not sharing, I would recommend the smaller portion. My compadre chose the street tacos which is served a la carte or as a meal with spicy rice and beans. Mitch pointed out they could be prepared various ways (i.e. on lettuce) and you could mix them up. We went with the pork belly taco and vegetable taco (something Rojos). Notice I said we. After reading the descriptions, we agreed it only made sense to share. Both entrees were worth seven stars easily. 

I topped my evening off with a sparkling wine specialty beverage. It was infused with  Chambord which happens to be one of my favorite liqueurs.  If that wasn't enough, I also tried another cider. Shots out to Woodchuck for the Raspberry Cider. It was perfect. Just like the evening. Yard House, rock on!",WJR8f_QNG1kuPq5V6RxeFA,3,1,4,kMPfdDw8MDQuyOOfEakzXg

Got right up to the bar and after glancing at a line of drafts 30 foot long, I ordered something I was familiar with because there was no way I was going to try and look at each one and look like a complete tool...anyway the bar service was fast.
We ended up getting sat outside, which we didn't ask for but hey, I was starving so we sat, ordered and food got there in decent time. I ordered the beef dip and is was phenomenal. I got the salad instead of fries and it was actually pretty good. I was expecting iceburg lettuce with an under ripe cherry tomato but it was much better than that.

I've tried Miller's Ale House on the opposite side of the outdoor mall also and I can say that Yard House is, hands down, way better than Ale House - in so many levels.  Am not a big fan of chain or franchised restaurants and tend to be very judgmental of them.  

My friend was starving after watching the most recent Superman movie at the Rave, or AMC Theaters.  I blamed my friend for choosing Ale House the last time because that was just a waste of a hard earned money so we went to Yard House which is literally a few steps away from the cinema.  I wasn't very happy of the choice, but hey, I might as well give it a try. 

We were quickly seated and drinks were served in a flash.  I ordered their Spicy Jambalaya with linguini instead of rice, and my friend ordered their Parmesan Crusted Chicken.   My review is based on the food that I pig out on.  My friend liked the chicken too, more than the pork medallion (actually pork schnitzel) from Ale House.  

We didn't wait long for our entrees.  The Jambalaya pasta came tolerably hot.  Good servings, if I may add.  It was reasonably seasoned.  Not that spicy as I was expecting but there sure was some kind of a bite and kick because of the paprika, cheyenne pepper and cajun seasonings.  The dish was perfectly tossed in cajun sauce generously packed with small shrimps, roasted red and green peppers, fresh tomatoes, slivers of andouille sausage and topped with two grilled huge shrimps (mini prawns).  I remember having Jambalaya pasta from Cheesecake Factory and Claim Jumpers decades ago and I thought they were good, but Yard House's is better.  

We liked the way our server/waitress didn't bother us every 5 minutes or so asking how everything was.   We were left to enjoy and savor our food, and only came when necessary (refilling our drinks, clearing up our table and bringing in the check).  Suffice to say, i finished my plate and was happy with it.  Total damage for me was $25.00.  A bit pricey for a pasta dish but considering the ambience and the service, it wasn't that bad.",W9C7l46Me0iuzbio_0BhdQ,1,0,4,k33rEJ9sYc6Hj7F4My8XFw

A good friend and his fiance were visiting from California and wanted to get together for dinner & drinks.  Since Town Square is located on the Strip, it was a convenient place for us to meet.  Over the past few weeks I've been drinking a lot of IPA's and Chimay and was telling him that the Yardhouse would be a great place for him to give them a try.  Since they don't have a Yardhouse where he lives in California, we were all very excited.

The Better Half and I met them at the Yardhouse.  It was pretty packed for a Sunday evening but we were able to find 4 spots at the bar in the corner so we could face each other and get seated immediately.  After browsing the beer menu, we decided on a Stone IPA.....the bartender said they no longer had it.  Ok, how about the Long Hammer IPA?  Nope...no longer carry it.  He proceeded to tell me they only had 1 or 2 of the IPA's on the menu because they are in the process of switching out the menu......what?  WTF is that?  I understand changing out the menu, but not being able to offer what you have listed until you make the change.....that's BS!  Especially for a place that claims to have 100's of beers on tap!  Ok.....well, if that's the case we asked for a Chimay Triple....guess what?  They didn't have any!

At this point I was a little embarrassed because I hyped up this place as a solid ""go to"" place to enjoy new brews and good food.  We settled for a Ranger IPA and called it a day.

For food we ordered Hot Wings, 4 Cheese Pizza, Jambalaya, and Sliders.  The Pizza was very soggy, even though I ordered it well done....that's the second time we've had Pizza and it come out soggy....we won't order it again.  The rest of the food was good, but not great.

Overall, it was a disappointing night at the Yardhouse.  There are tons of places in Vegas that serve good bar food, but came here specifically for beers that were not available....and that's suppose to set them apart from the rest.  I hope this was an anomaly and not the beginning of a trend.",QJI9OSEn6ujRCtrX06vs1w,7,4,2,D8D8t1yxybu5-XUDQlhqvw

The food?  I think the hardest part about ordering is picking something. All of the appetizers looked delicious. We had the lobster, crab and artichoke dip. Excellent choice!  E, who is a salad connoisseur, had the walnut pear salad.  R had the sliders.  Both were excellent!  I had the BBQ bacon and cheese burger.

Everyone else was trying to be healthy by eating a fish dish and salad or soup and salad, but c'mon when in a new place you have to try the signature dishes.

The Mac and Cheese Squared didn't look even close to what you might get out of a Kraft box.  Instead it is a white gooey cheese pasta (not elbows) with mushrooms, bacon (big pieces), and a vegetable (?).  Absolutely delicious.

But wait, one of the most important things....the decor.  You walk in and to your left is an enclosed room full of kegs.  You can see in via the glass and view the lines running from the kegs up to the ceiling.

* Abita Purple Haze - raspberry Belgian wheat
* lindeman's framboise - raspberry
* lindeman's peche - peach 
also I highly recommend the house honey blonde for anyone who enjoys lagers.

secondly, I have not been disappointed by the food. if you're adventurous with your food, I recommend the spicy tuna roll or ahi poke stack. it's always fresh and super flavorful. the shiitake garlic noodles are so yummy! you could get full off of those two dishes alone. the turkey pot pie is a classic and it's definitely something you need to try if you haven't already.

I am not sure if they just employ young people that just don't care or if the noise is so loud it makes them all crazy.

The food was above average. I ordered the lamb burger and the barbecue chicken pizza. For the food, I give it a 7.5/10. I'd rate this place four stars if it were solely based on food, but that isn't the case. The service was 'meh.' Our waiter ignored us on multiple occasions and disregarded us. It took four tries to get a refill on water. It was as if he looked down on us (probably because we're younger.) You'd think all consumers would be treated equally without stereotypes, but I guess that's not the case here at Yard House! Good food.

Chicken (cooked well), guacomole, sir cream, tomatoes, cilantro.... Everything you would expect to make a great nacho plate. It was pretty large also, feeds 4 at least. 

My entree, I decided to go with the chicken and rice bowl.  It was pretty good, flavorful but the chicken was a little dry and could've used a little more seasoning.  If this dish would've been a little better I would've considered giving them a 5 star.  It was an reasonably priced as well.

I wasn't feeling well so I ordered light. I had the soup and salad combo. I do have to say you have a few options there. I believe there are 3-4 each of soup and salads to choose from. I chose classic Caesar and clam chowder. Both were awesome!!! 

Everyone ordered something different. I saw fish, sandwiches, meatless chicken wings, meatless salads, Asian, tacos, all sorts of stuff. Everyone enjoyed their meals.

The biggest draw back to hanging out there is its always LOUD. I don't think i've ever been there and had a normal toned conversation with my guest. The music is usually loud which means the patrons have to be louder just to be heard. It can get almost obnoxious at times.

3954335,2012-02-27,0,A5Rkh7UymKm0_Rxm9K2PJw,"Came to Yard House for dinner before going to the airport to leave Las Vegas. It's in a mall made to look like a quaint downtown shopping center. Pretty nicely done, actually, but would be nicer if they closed it off to care traffic. We likely wouldn't have found the place, though, were it not for our GPS leading us straight there on city streets. 

Was busy for early evening but we got a table right away. The staff was extra attentive and got us everything we needed. My boyfriend and I were meeting friends and since we had a plane to catch, ordered before they got there. Getting meals at different times and two different bills was no problem for our waitress. What a relief!

Perusing the menu, I was surprised at the selection. Though the Yard House is a brew pub, they have a pretty interesting and appetizing menu that include gluten-free and vegetarian options. My boyfriend got a grilled ahi salad and I got the mac and cheese which is nothing like the usual mac and cheese. It had chicken, bacon, and wild mushrooms in it with a small pasta I'd never seen before. The sauce was made of several exotic cheeses and it was delicious! My friend's four-year daughter shared it with me so though I thought it gourmet and exotic, it was easy enough for her to enjoy as well. I tried the ahi and it was really tasty too. Our friends got burgers with cones of crispy french fries and everything looked delicious. 

Overall, the restaurant is a loud and happening place but seems to be a good place to bring kids while still feeling like you're having a night out on the town.

-Spinach cheese dip ($7): comes with crispy flatbread its so savory.
-Onion ring tower ($5): love how huge the onion rings are!
-Fried calamari ($7): the bomb, it's so crispy and appetizing.
-BBQ chicken pizza ($7): my favorite out of all the pizzas; it's a thin crust pizza with red onion, cilantro, chicken and bbq sauce.

3963785,2013-05-05,2,A5Rkh7UymKm0_Rxm9K2PJw,"I have lived in Vegas for now over a year, and I have to say that by far this was the worst restaurant I have been too. 

When we first came in it looked fun, loud, dark - perfect for a younger crowd looking to have some fun. We decided to sit outside because Vegas weather is to be enjoyed as much as possible and were quickly concerned by the size of the menu. 

I have never seen a menu this large. Yes 2 pages are of the brews that they have on tap but the other 5 pages (back and front) are of food they serve. They serve pizza, soup, salad, vegetarian, tacos, fish, sushi, dessert, sandwiches, burgers, pasta EVERYTHING. This is when I got nervous. Usually when I see a menu over 2 pages I'm wondering if they're a ""Jack of all trades and a King of NONE."" As I looked through the menu every item had this grandiose listing of ingredients that looked as if they belonged in a high end restaurant. As far as I knew I was in a restaurant that cherished beer and was named the ""YARD HOUSE"". It was obvious that they were overcompensating or just flat out LYING about what they put in their food. After reading a novel of a menu for over 10 minutes I thought I had finally decided what I wanted. I ordered a ranch side salad and their ""famous"" mac n cheese. My husband ordered a BBQ burger - well done with french fries. We did not order any brew. 

When they brought out my salad I was surprised to see that they had used a hot plate to serve my cold salad. It did not help the taste. The lettuce itself was very weak and not crunchy at all like Iceberg lettuce generally is. After eating a few bites I saw something dark and shiny in the bottom of my bowl...I began to dig it out and realized that it was a long thin dark black hair. I stopped eating. 

A few minutes after I stopped eating I asked for our waitress to take the salad away due to the hair and she apologized and asked if I would like something else instead. Just to be safe I ordered the Caesar salad. The salad quickly came out within two minutes and I was excited to try it because I LOVE Caesar dressing. I took a huge bite and for some reason my nose and my pallete tasted and smelled something skunky...I had assumed it may have been the man who had just walked by and continued to take another bite. After that bite I knew it was the dressing. The Yard House had tried to ""remake"" caesar dressing and it was awful. It tasted like someone had just rubbed their dirty gym sock all over my salad. I didn't take another bite.



Shortly after that our meals had arrived and as I am the BIGGEST mac and cheese fan I was super excited to taste their rendition of an old favorite. They had used some ""fancy"" pasta with a few different cheeses, chicken, bacon, mushrooms and a bread crumble on top. The cheese sauce was good, the pasta itself was way overcooked and too soft, the bacon was soft..which was not appealing and some of the chicken was cold as if they had frozen slices and just heated them for the dish. I pushed everything but the pasta and the cheese to the side and tried to enjoy it. After a couple of bites I started to feel really sick. I'm not really sure what caused it but I honestly felt like I was going to throw up. It might have had something to do with the fact that a few seconds before the table next to us OUTSIDE had ordered fish and I was drowning in bad fish odor at our table. My husband even complained of the stench. That fish was IN NO WAY FRESH. It smelt like rotten salmon that had been sitting under a heat lamp all day. I almost gagged when they first brought it out. I think that, and the combo of feeling like I ate a dirty sock and soft pasta may have made me sick. 


My husband said that his burger was alright, and the fries were okay, but really stringy. 

Halfway into eating my mac and cheese a woman came out to speak to me about the hair that I had found in my salad. She let me know that it was NOT a hair, and that it was actually corn silk, left over from the ""fresh"" corn they had just chucked to make my salad. I've eaten fresh corn, canned corn and frozen corn all of my life. They have very distinct differences. I know, that that was frozen corn. It was gooey and hard to chew, fresh corn just pops in your mouth. I don't know why anyone had come out to argue with me about what I found in my salad. Last time I chucked corn the silk was usually white to a yellowish color. Not BLACK. Nice try though.



Anyway, my husband and I both left feeling very nauseous and the drive back to Henderson was NOT a pleasant one. The entire drive home I was trying my hardest not to throw up. I don't want to explain what the rest of my night was like but I'm sure you get the picture. We wont be back here.",m7zhLQyIiaDR1Q9r__rp6Q,3,1,1,geayq4eo3RY62Go2k1FBsg

So we won a visa giftcard of $100 and decided to celebrate at this yardhouse earlier...everything from the food, drinks, and service was going great until the bill came of $160. Ok so we explained to the waitress to charge $100 on the card and the rest will just be cash of $80 which the change would be her tip...she comes back to us saying the card wouldn't go through because ''giftcards like this takes out a percentage,'' so she claimed she tried swiping $95, $90, $85, and finally the amount of $80 went through. She also said it took out an extra $12 as the ''percentage that goes to the back to the bank.'' we made sure to ask if that $12 goes to her and she said ""NO."" ok nothing seems to make sense, so I called customer service and they told us that the reason why the amount didn't go through BECAUSE they charged the amount of $115, $113, $110 (so obviously it wouldn't go through BECAUSE the card only contains $100!!!) and that extra $12 was charged as a gratuity for the restaurant, it doesn't go back to the bank merchant...So this waitress PRETTY MUCH LIED to our face not realizing we won't call the customer service of the card!!! They obviously keep track of every single swipe and was able to tell us what amount they charged us. She purposely charged more than $100 into making us think that it won't go through and charged that extra $12 for tip but lying that it doesn't go to her so we can give her more money...that is just plain SHADY! are u freaking kidding me? Why would she lie like that? Has other waiters here done this as their way to pocket more tips? It's not about the amount that gets me, it's this dishonesty that really boggles my mind! It was such a disappointment because she was accommodating but forget that when you're dishonest! Normally patrons would have made a fuss over this but I'm not like that, we just left but I would like to talk to a manager about this tomorrow because that's just wrong. We were willing to give her 25% tip but we're not as stupid as she thought we were so we left. She still got that $12 though so whatever.",uhNSFfVqC_mQeC4eVCQn1A,2,0,1,6cF-g6pcRr5KcBHSSC_kfQ

I'm sure for like many, I was there for a movie and went to go grab a beer prior to the show.  We sat at the bar and ordered Ephemer, they didn't have it. (the only reason why I went there in the first place) got the Sam Adams summer ale instead.  Ordered wings but took like 20 mins for the staff to realize the printer was broken in the kitchen. 10 mins later, by the time we actually got the wings the movie was starting in 5min, so we decided to catch the next showing.  

For those of you that like only the drum stick and not the wing of the chicken, this would be perfect.  They only serve the drum sticks that are breaded.  I would assume because they had to get it out of the kitchen so fast the chicken was not done all the way.  Still had a bit of pink by the bones.  We did not finish it.  

They did take the wings off the check but the service was not as attentive as I would expect in a place where they have such an exotic selection of beers.  For someone that does not know about beers would feel intimidated and inclined to just order a bud light cause of the lack of help.  

Overall it was not the best first impression, but they have a great product and I will visit again for the beers.",Ccq5GTRsr2xKvi8yARqzlA,1,0,4,eBk5FPjmi59mfd_S9qb3VA

My usual order during happy hour goes something like this; don't worry, I share it with one other person!

- Truffle Fries.  It's not on the Happy Hour list but it's only $4.  You can't go wrong with that considering truffle oil costs $20 a bottle!  These fries are bomb!

-Garlic Noodes w/ Shiitake mushrooms.  Sounds simple but the dish is really flavorful.

-Sliders.  Pastrami or Classic.  You can never go wrong with these especially at 4 fairly sized sliders for $6.95 during Happy Hour!  They don't come in your natural hamburger bun, they come in sweet rolls; yum!  You can substitute your fries on this dish for more Truffle fries.   That's how I do!

-Ahi Sashimi.  This is good paired with the Garlic Noodles.  

Some other items to try of course are their pizzas.  They're all pretty good, pretty big, and half price during happy hour!  Awesome.  

I like sititng in the booths here because they are a perfect distance from the bar and TVs to watch the current sports games while you eat, plus its a good view to people watch.  Sometimes it's nice to eat outside on their patio as well.  Their brownie dessert is pretty good too if you have room for it! Oh, and don't forget the beer.  They have a wide variety to choose from and you can have a whole YARD size glass to yourself.  Good luck with that!",ksYpOznbD-22wYpTiacHwA,0,0,5,yIOs_ePhBNalb9Fxody0og
4008196,2017-08-25,0,A5Rkh7UymKm0_Rxm9K2PJw,"First time at Yard House, but I had heard a lot about it from friends.

Pros: 
1. The food was great and came out in a timely manner.
2. Amazing drinks selection. If beer is your thing head on over.
3. Servers are friendly and attentive. 
4. Ambience is perfect for a night out with friends or a casual first date. 
5. Bathrooms are clean with roughly 5 stalls so there wasn't really a line for the ladies. (Important for me)

Cons:
1. Each server has their own table and if you need something you have to look for your server. My husband and I had our hand up for a good 5 minutes and heard other servers ask each other who our server was before finally heading over to ask what we would like. I understand why they did this but all we wanted was some hot sauce...haha

2. Their menu has such variety it threw me off a little. I like consistency because it means they specialize in certain foods. And it's easier to choose.

What we had:
Fried mac&cheese (was not in love with it)
Truffle oil fries (loved it)
Mediterranean Salmon (loved it)
Korean BBQ tacos (husband liked it)

Happy hour makes me happy here too!

I had the Thai chicken Noodle salad.  There was a generous serving of perfectly grilled chicken strips on the salad.  The noodles were slightly tough but otherwise a tasty dish.

I decided on the waitress' recommendation of the Spicy Chicken Sandwich on flat bread with Truffle fires. I guess it depends what you order, the burgers and sandwiches come with a side, but not sure about other items. My sandwich was AMAZING. I did add avocado to it too!

Tried their lobster garlic noodles. You'd think with a dish called lobster garlic there'd be garlic flavor right? It was very bland, dry and salty. Not much going on for such an intriguing dish. 
Glad I had my favorite appetizer (chicken lettuce wraps) and a cup of the tomato bisque or it would have been a total bust. 
Since my guy and I split everything we saved room for dessert. Ordered the baked brownie with a scoop of caramel ice cream. It says that it takes 15 minutes to bake and come out. Ours was about 25. Think our waitress forgot about it along with our drink refills.

They were nice enough to cook my meat substitute in a separate pan so that my meal was still vegan, and it was pretty decent.  It was great when we were in a bind for time, as they got us in and out of there as quickly as possible and the waiter was very nice and attentive.  It is really loud and busy there, not exactly my cup of tea.  However, they were able to accommodate me despite the business and I am super happy about that.

The atmosphere that Yard House creates for the guest is very laid back and chilled. One almost feels over dressed since not in flip flops and shorts when you come in. The inside dining is great and all. But secondly, they offer outside dining and the use of heat lamps in the winter and shade awnings in the summer. They used to have a fire place that guests could dine by, but it's no longer here. 

Thirdly, I tried the sunset margarita and I had three of them by the time the second margarita came it just seems that the alcohol gets a little stronger each time, but it's probably just me.

They were both friendly, attentive, and made sure we were well hydrated. Our bill was also settled fairly promptly. 

Some drinks offered and ordered that day included Old 43 and  Timmerman strawberry lambert. Old 43 a mixed drink with bourbon and citrus.  Timmerman strawberry lambert was on tap. One of the two was a bit more on the bourbon and the other was bit more sweet. Both good. The strawberry drink was good. Like a different type of cider malt beverage.

The night itself was amazing because we were there with good friends and it was really fun. The restaurant itself didn't impress me so much and the food didn't exactly take me to an amazing culinary journey. 

First of all, I was really impressed by their beer selection. My husband and I shared a Hefeweissen dunkel und it tasted really smooth and good. The service was relatively fast for how crowded the place was. They were trying really hard I thought. Still it took 15 minutes for our waters to come out.

I guess I'm a little bit of a health freak and when I eat things I think about all the good things and bad things of the food for my body. I mean everything did have good flavors and was spiced pretty good, but I couldn't enjoy it so much and left the restaurant thinking 1. Am I going to fit through the door? 2. OMG I'm going to get a hearattache... 

The sweet potato fries were very very greasy and there was almost oil dripping from my fingers as I was eating my sandwich. Also, the food was kind of expensive I thought.

Although it seemed like it was really busy due to the number of people standing around near the hostess table, we only had to wait a couple minutes before being given the option to sit outside(quieter) or inside. We ended up sitting in a booth inside. 

A major reason to go to Yard House is the beer selection. I love Lindeman's Framboise, so when I saw the Youngberry Chocolate on the menu I had to try it.  It is Lindeman's Framboise & Young's Double Chocolate Stout and oh so tasty. 

For my meal, I had the Ahi Crunch salad was good but not great, mainly due to boring veggies. The ahi was seared perfectly and well seasoned, I think I would have been better off with the ahi poke bowl. 

We ended up skipping Blue Martini. Drinks were cheaper at Yard House for the guys (and martinis are always $10 at Yard House versus the $12+ pricetag at Blue Martini when it's not happy hour!!!) and the atmosphere was nice and laid back so we just stayed there.

Even though we came on a busy night and had to wait for around 25-30 minutes to be seated, the food and service more than out weighted the wait time. Since my first visit, I came often to this location during my two years that I lived in Vegas. It as a favorite spot to drop in for lunch, get a drink or two and was a nice spot to meet up with friends/family for dinner and to catch up. 

Service is usually quick and efficient, but depending on when you come, it can get super busy and you may have to wait some for your wait staff to come around to you. No matter how busy it's been, I've never had to wait for them to come around when I'm first seated, but again depending on when you come, drinks can still take some time to come out. I've even been here and have had to ask them about my drink. 

Like most Yard House restaurants that I've been to, the food here that I've had has always been so delicious. fresh and hot. Some of the items that I've tried on their menu are their Sliders, Turkey melt (one of my personal favorites), Onion ring tower, Fried Calamari, Truffle fries, Chicken lettuce wraps, wings, California roll, Pepperoni and mushroom pizza, 4 cheese pizza, Turkey club, and Fish Tacos just to name some. 

They have a great lunch menu which runs daily from 11 am to 5 pm and an equally good Happy Hour that runs Monday-Friday 3-6 pm and Late night Happy Hour Sunday-Wednesday 10 pm to close. 

Not a big beer drinker, but they have a great selection of beer for those that enjoy it as well as a menu of wine and mixed drinks. The mixed drinks that I've had are amazing. They didn't skimp on the alcohol which is a plus when paying the price you do.

Went with our friend from out of town because of the famous over easy egg on a burger! We did have to wait 30 minutes on a Friday around 8pm, not bad since it was packed-at least they knew what they were doing getting it moving.
We sat outside since it was a nice night. We ordered the béarnaise burger (béarnaise sauce, fried onions) with garlic fries, the pastrami benedict burger (roasted tomatoes, fried onions, swiss, béarnaise sauce, fried egg) with onion rings and the kids chicken teriyaki with fries.
The béarnaise burger was ok nothing special and a little drying( bland and I wouldn't recommend )
The pastrami burger was really good but a mess to actually eat- my man lived it though and will be getting it again. Our son also loved the chicken and fries, his also came with a drink and a rice crispy treat at the end in cookies and cream. He loved it and for only $7 seemed like a great deal!
The waitress however was a nightmare, she didn't seem like she wanted to be there and was annoyed after every question I asked. Maybe she had a long day but I felt like I was bothering her.

We were readily seated outdoors. It wasn't hot (Vegas weather) since there were mists to keep us cool. However, when they turned it off, the water kept dripping and splashing us.  We were irritated so we placed napkins on the area the water falls to prevent from splashing us. We informed our waiter about it and he said that it's been an ongoing problem and it's still in the process of being fixed.

Dj was our waiter for the night. He was very nice in the beginning. Yard House is known for their beers on tap. I wanted to try something new. I asked Dj for a recommendation. He served me 2 tasting beers. Unfortunately, I only remember one of them, Leffe Blond. When I asked Dj what it was again, he was unsure and couldn't remember the name. I was a little confused since he was the one who recommended the beers to me but yet he forgot the name of it.

Yard house is very pricey. Luckily, we were there during happy hour. I ordered the Pastrami Sliders ($7) with Sweet Potato Fries. The sweet potato fries were delicious! It took very long for the food the come out. Once the food came out, the sweet potato fries were hotter than the sliders. The sliders were very disappointing. I was expecting much from the sliders, but it only had pastrami and cheese. The sliders were also cold!

My sister also ordered dessert (Soufflé & Creme Brulee) togo. Everything was paid for already. Dj never came back to check on us to see if we received the dessert order. Instead, we had to ask one of the busboy to check on our to-go order. Keep in mind we were waiting for 30 minutes already & we ordered the dessert before we were done eating. The busboy followed up and said that they were packing the dessert. After another 20 minutes, we finally received our order from another waiter & not Dj. Dj never came back after we gave him the money. 

I was very disappointed with the waiting time and the service from our waiter. It felt like our waiter didn't want anything but the payment & his tip. His service was not consistent.",7fyAtRSYYqOKZPr39L2UYg,0,0,2,-83aVS7CPZORpNKMRbRjJQ

For some reason, out of all of those, I found myself munching on the fries and dipping them on the honey mustard that accompanied the chicken. I guess the fries were just in the sweet spot of crunchiness and fluffiness, and the honey mustard was way too addictive. I can't speak for the beer, but everybody at my table seemed to enjoy theirs and they have a huge selection. Finally,  gotta love a place that plays some Beatles and some George Harrison.

I also wanted to add a tip for finding this place. Gotta locate it before you can enjoy it, you know? It's kinda hidden if you're driving along most of the streets, so locate it on a map of Town Square beforehand or else just park somewhere and walk around.

Unfortunately, upon sitting down, I saw their happy hour was a completely different time frame, so we asked our server, Jordyn, about their happy hour. We told her that when we called, we got a different answer, and she said she would ask management if maybe they had another special going on. In the quick five minutes, not only did she find out what happened (the hostess was new and wasn't clear on times) but she spoke to her manager about the miscommunication and was able to get us happy hour priced appetizers. That showed that she truly cared about the service she gave to her customers AND was able to fix it! In such a quick manner as well!

 My boyfriend and I were originally debating on staying because we were a little upset, but this definitely displayed great customer service and I knew that Jordyn will surely take care of us. We ended up ordering poke nachos, calamari, the carnivore pizza, and 2 tacos (kbbq and a fish taco). The food was delicious as always! Yardhouse is always my favorite chain restaurant. 
We also ordered 2 micheladas each. After the first round, Jordyn said another bartender just clocked in that makes amazing micheladas and ensured she would make ours. She was very attentive and very clearly catered to us! 

When it was time to pay out our check, not only did Jordyn remember our discounted appetizers, but she was able to comp them completely off! My boyfriend and I have both worked in the service industry, and so we are both very critical when it comes to customer service, but she was amazing from the time we sat down to the time we paid out our check.

Yard House has a phenominal number of beers to sample on any given night including some local brews as from Sin City Brewery (my fav 7 years running) and Tenaya Creek. I ordered an Anderson Valley Boont Amber from NorCal before I saw the Sin City beers. No worries though. The hops in this California style amber went well with my dinner. I ordered a black truffle chesse burger. Freshly grilled and topped with gooey truffle cheese and onion bacon jam, this burger was some rich pub fare. The bitter hop notes of the beer cut through that richness. My only complaint was the size of the burger. I think I can get a bigger burger at Carl's Jr but it wouldn't taste so good. Luckily there were enough fries to make up the difference. Lovely little shoestrings that took to ketchup real well. 

Other fare ordered on this particular night were average fish and chips with the unique jalapeno tartar sauce and garlic aioli, a roast beef sandwich and jambalaya with pasta in place of rice. I tried the fish and a bite of sausage from the jambalaya. My favorite part of any of it was the garlic aioli for the fish but that stuff would be good on just about anything.

It was very loud in Yard House.  The music was loud which is fine by me especially given the classic rock sounds they were pumping out but it was difficult to hear my family over the sound of music. Not to mention the place was packed so we were talking over the couple hundred other people in there too. Despite the noise, the food was good and service was adequate.

I'm a fairly new delivery driver and this place doesn't have it together.  I accepted the pick-up delivery at 8:08pm that's when customer ordered the food on a Monday night.  I get there at 8:22pm as I was fairly far, hit ""Arrived"" to let them know I'm here.  I checked in at the counter to show the order I'm picking up to this lady and she said ""It'll be a moment""  Waited a good 15 minutes and it was getting crowded so I waited outside.  Now normally when the order is ready to be picked up, I'll get a notification.  I didn't get notice.  Waited for another 10 minutes and I go back inside to see if it's ready.  Nothing.  So the lady finally ask which order I'm waiting for...  I'm thinking to myself ""are you kidding me??""   They should know exactly which order is it.. it's not like there's 3 other delivery drivers waiting...    I'm the only one there...  So turns out the order was partially ready and was just sitting there.  I'm like ""what's missing?""  two drinks but she needs to get an ""To-go specialist"" to get these drinks for me.  And this ""specialist"" was no where in sight...   I'm like freaking great...  waited another 5-10 minutes for her to show up... then she takes another 5-10 minutes to pour two drinks.  I'm thinking ""is this really happening?""  It's obvious they're short staffed, and the staff doesn't know what to do with delivery orders....   I finally got everything at 9:05pm...  takes almost an hour... what a joke.

On Wednesday February 1st my husband and I went to Yardhouse for a quick lunch. Our server was Kristyn. All was well with everything until the transaction went through on the credit card and it showed she added an extra dollar to her tip. My husband put a tip down of $3.45 our meal came to $21.00. He normally gives 20% but she never asked to see his ID on his credit card that on the back says ""check ID"" so his rule is thats a big deal to no check ID on a credit card that says check ID so he took a dollar off the tip. Well he sees on his bank statement that instead of $3.45 the charge is $4.45.

They have a fantastic and interesting selection of beers available, even if their staff sometimes can't offer much help! In their defense, though, the beer list is quite lengthy.

This particular location has a pretty nice patio with a fire pit outside that makes for some great people watching. I find that every Yardhouse I've been to is always incredibly loud. Maybe it's the cement floors that just ricochet the sound throughout the restaurant, but it makes for the main reason I stay away from these restaurants until a friend drags me along for happy hour.

The food is decent and I'll give them props for having a wide variety of tastes that goes well beyond your typical bar food. Unfortunately, everything is only decent. People rave about the truffle fries, but for me personally, I've never been into the white truffle oil thing and think it tastes like gasoline - fresh truffles are another matter entirely. 
The ahi tuna poke bowl is fresh and my favorite thing to order here- light soy sauce, rich avocado, a little bit of crunch and sesame oil.. great success. 
The ahi tuna burgers on the other hand- which claim to be fresh ahi tuna that is hand chopped - automatically comes cooked well. Who.. in their right mind.. cooks fresh ahi tuna well?! It's madness I tell you, and made those burgers that were once great, completely below par. If you decide to go this route - make sure you specify how you want them done!
The deviled eggs were a little sweet, but definitely a fun and unusual choice for a restaurant.
Ahi tuna caesar salad- exactly what you'd expect.
French onion soup - decent, but nothing to rave about. A small bowl with provolone melted over the top, a little lighter broth than most places, the bread was okay. Just okay.

Hi everyone today we decided to have a lunch at yard house 
We believed is Going to be great 
But we had a terrible experience with the customer service for some reason we had four different waiters  ridiculous on my own personal opinion.
Any way we order a tortilla soup  really good loved 
But the steak tacos was bad and we order a carnitas tacos (means pork) and we get a chicken tacos,

My burger was good half goat and half beef good flavor.

After a while we told the waiter we order a pork tacos no chicken and takes forever to come back for our table carnitas tacos are bad we don't liked 
Next time when you guys  recommend tacos    Give us the choice  on flour or corn tortillas 

This is the cherry at the end of the cake check this out 
The manager came to talk whit us 
And he said I'm apologize for all the inconvenience but something they I can do for you and I explain everything then you guys already knows and I ask a couple questions from the menu and he don't so have the answers for my and again he said I'm apologizing 
My reaction was try to fix this little problem because your food is ok but your service is terrible and he said I'm Going to give you a free desert for the inconvenience

Yardhouse has a decent selection and it's good for meals or just snacking with their Snacks Menu. You can also choose from appetizers, Salads, Pizza, Street Tacos and their Gardein vegetarian selections. Whenever I come to a Yardhouse I like to choose from the Grilled Burgers, Sandwiches and House Favorites.  

We ordered the Ruben sandwich on rye, grilled chicken with avocado and the grilled cheese with tomato bisque.  I tasted all of the sandwiches and I thought that Ruben was by far the best.  When I ordered the Ruben I asked if it came with rye bread and the waiter was not sure.  He was going to check and come back.  It took him some time but he returned and let me know they had rye bread.  A Ruben isn't a Ruben if it's not on rye bread!  

When the food was brought to the table I was talking so I didn't check my sandwich and the bread was not rye.  It took me a while to flag down our waiter and he finally noticed me came over and took my sandwich and fries and replaced them very quickly.  According to the waiter, it seems that the server took the wrong sandwich to the table and mine was sitting there.  It did not seem as warm as the original sandwich they sent out but if I was going to ask for them to exchange it again then everyone would be done with their meals and I would still be eating. So I ate a not so warm sandwich but it had a nice taste to it. I think it would have been an awesome sandwich if it was fresh out of the kitchen.  

The chicken and avocado sandwich was delicious.  The avocado was very fresh and the flavors went really well together.  The chicken was juicy and not overcooked.  The grilled cheese sandwich had tomato on it and it was good. The tomato bisque soup tasted fresh as well and was served at the perfect temperature.  The fries that came with the food were good with one of the orders but not with mine since they must have been sitting around a bit. 

If you are a beer fanatic this is the place for you.  They have a huge selection of about 200 beers.  They rotate some beers so they don't always have all of them available. There are even beer blends, beer floats and beer cocktails. As far as mixed drinks they also have mixed drinks including martinis, cocktails and mules.  They have plenty of wine as well and even Sake.

I only gave the place three stars for serving a sandwich and fries that were not at the right temperature.  Our waiter was professional and polite.. When I'm with my sister we make each other laugh a lot and the waiter was very patient with us.

She kept our glasses full of water and made sure we always had a beer available if we wanted one. We munched on truffle fries while we waited and they were the perfect mix of warm, salty and a bit of a crunch. Our entrees were also excellent: my husband ordered the Nashville Hot House Chicken and I had a chicken stir fry which was light and so flavorful. I wasn't expecting that from them!

Then we returned, this time during happy hour, and we're strongly encouraged to order from that menu. I wish we hadn't. The quality of the food just wasn't the same. Everything tasted like reheated frozen appetizers, from our egg rolls to the nachos (which the chicken on it was dry and overcooked). My husband liked his wings and onion rings though. Next time, I'll just stick to an entree, regardless of how cheap their appetizers or small plates are during happy hour.",dW8VyCd9gkVyKkmBPYOlmg,0,0,4,lZPB8G7nFSAYYwYaXAeP2Q

4290820,2012-10-19,1,A5Rkh7UymKm0_Rxm9K2PJw,"I've been to Yardhouse several times. I like that they have so much beer on tap. My wife enjoys the Rose Gaarden (a mix of framboise and Hoegaarden that is really honestly delicious) and I usually go with the Rogue Hazelnut brown.

The food has always been solid. The (mac + cheese)^2 is usually good, the hawaiian poke stack is always tasty (their tuna in general is pretty nice), and they can cook a good burger. So why the three stars? 

Well, we brought some guests here and found ourselves sort of embarrassed. To be fair, it was a Saturday night and they were very, very busy, but our waiter (Ryan) stood out as rude enough that our guests actually commented on it afterwards.

Lest you think I'm being unfair, here's specifically what went wrong, in order.

We had a party of six and were seated at a round table set for five. The host said he'd have us an extra chair in ""just a second,"" after which I saw him speak to our waiter. Our waiter looked at us and then, presumably, went off to find a chair. I stood there, waiting, for five minutes while I saw our waiter serve drinks and food to other tables, patiently waiting for my chair. I finally had to flag him down and ask for a chair, again, before I got one. This kind of set the tone for the evening, but I didn't know it at the time.

Finally sitting, we ordered drinks. One of our guests ordered a framboise. That's pronounced ""fram-bwahs"" due to the final E. This is important in a second, so hold on. Our waiter replied ""that's framb-wah."" My wife, looking embarrassed that our waiter had just corrected our guest, told him that no, it's pronounced fram-bwahs. I know this sounds like a silly thing, but 

1. she's right, and
2. she's had people try to mansplain at her that she's wrong before, which is exactly what this dude was doing. 
3. furthermore, in what universe does a waiter correct a guest's pronunciation, even if they are wrong (which she wasn't)?

Our waiter gave her kind of a funny look when she said that. Okay, maybe he's just tired or just had a rude table or something. Not going to let it bother me.

Hold on, because this is where it gets weird.

That's when he started blowing us off. We had to ask for silverware twice after our food showed up and sat there, cooling, with us unable to eat it. He passed our table six times (six times! yes, I counted!) without even offering to refill our drinks until I finally had to flag him down. When he did bring refills, he brought them for everyone except my wife.

Explain that. I'll wait.

Look, bottom line, I'm still going to go to Yardhouse. In fact, we went back a couple of days after, if only to wash the bad taste out of our mouths. I'm not going to let this one dude ruin it for me. But if I get sat in his section again, I'm going to ask to be moved.",DjsS89nD3eaoUuFhrkc5Ig,2,0,3,TdWT4HeAbdiRzDHhJUgndg

What we got was wings in hot sauce so after waiting for someone to check on us they reordered the correct wings only to still come with hot sauce. Juan said at least we are consistent. At this point Jon took over and offered us a free round of drinks only find out at checkout he only gave my girlfriend a free drink and charged for mine. We didn't order anymore food after that.

The poke nachos were also very savory and different.

I shared the Poke Stack and Fish Taco Plate (includes rice and beans). The food was decent, though nothing exceptional. The Poke Stack had a light wasabi soy sauce and came between a couple wantons. It had a small serving of avocado that was fanned out. This made the avocado on the plate hard to share. The fish tacos were decent, but lacked the flavor I'm accustomed to in San Diego. It could have used something to brighten it up. Perhaps mango pineapple? At any rate, it was lacking that tang that makes fish tacos pop. The beans were also just okay, as was the rice.

I was here this past weekend 3/12 with a group of about 6-7 girls and our server was an older gentleman named ""Chris"". First of all, he had the worst attitude on this planet. We were waiting on a couple girls to join us (they were literally minutes away) and him and his boss (who I don't know his name) kept asking us if they were on their way, after several times of telling them YES THEY ARE PARKING they must of got the hint. It literally took them an hour to bring out our food, we hardly even ordered anything besides appetizers and drinks. My friend ordered a Lemon Drop martini and it was barely filled to the top WITH NO SUGAR around the rim. Was this for a kid, perhaps? Baby size Lemon Drop Martini. I think they finally got it right the second time around...mind you these drinks are not cheap but they sure are cheap as far as the amount they give you. So, we were on a time crunch and finally our food comes out. My pasta was absolutely DISGUSTING. It's like they took the pasta, chicken and threw in a can of some type of creamy sauce. Had no flavor to it whatsoever!! I always order this meal at the Yard House at Red Rock and it's always so amazing. NOT THIS LOCATION. Our server Chris, was terrible. His attitude was so rude, like he was rushing us but as soon as we asked the status of our order he seemed to have tude. It definitely seemed like he hated his job. Don't work in this industry or high pressure environment if you can't handle it.

The atmosphere of this place is ok, if you like that fast paced and loud noise ambiance.  It's tolerable, and I have yet to experience bad service.  The servers are quick to get your order, great with drink refills, and the food comes out in less than 20 mins.  (*QUICK NOTE: NEVER EAT HERE, NOT UNLESS IT'S HAPPY HOUR, otherwise you'd be paying $10 - $15 for appetizers and entree's*) 

Things to Order:  
- Chicken Lettuce Wrap - Ground chicken sauteed with diced mushrooms, onion leaves, and spices, served upon a fried wonton bowl accompanied with 8-9 lettuce wraps.  There are three types of sauces, I think regular, mild and spicy?  I'm not too sure on that, but the regular sauce is my favorite.  

- Fried Calamari - Nothing too special, but a definite must have for a vast mix.  The calamari is always fried to a crisp, tossed in a salt a pepper mix served with tartar sauce and a marinara sauce I think?  

- Hawaiian Poke Stack - For some reason the fish tastes very fresh, as opposed to other restaurants who try their hardest to execute a poke dish.  Yardhouse I'd say, prepares it well.  Ahi poke tossed in a Hawaiian style marinade, served upon two wonton crisps with soy & sesame oil bean sprouts and carrots.  

- Onion Ring Stack - An onion tower served with two types of sauces: ranch and chipotle.  I personally like the chipotle sauce.  The onion rings are fried to perfection, the onions doesn't slip out of the fried batter.  

- Chicken Nachos - MMmmMm, a huge plate of nachos served with the toppings of a mexican nacho.  The cheese sizzles when served and the chicken is quite succulent, although the pieces should be chopped up a little more.  

- Spinach Dip - My very favorite, spinach and cheese mixed together in a hot mix (not spicy).  Served with largely cut toasted bread instead of chips!  What's even better, they lightly top the bread with parmesan! 

This a definite must go to if you're having a get together.  The food is good, and so is the experience.  Another pro to this, is that after eating you can go watch a movie.  Since the movie theatre is in fact right across the building.",0guV-tXB82pi2stV7a5g5Q,5,4,4,HcZCK_OXVc_kJd6am6fpww

During our visit we had: Four cheese pizza; buffalo wings; spicy tuna roll; calamari. 
The pizza was really good, like REALLY good! Fresh, super cheesy with thin crust. We really enjoyed it. 
The wings were all Mr's. I usually worry when he orders wings because he's pretty choosy. Well the wing nazi was left satisfied. 
The calamari was delicious, it came with two sauces and was in both circular shape and testicles. 
The least enjoyed pick for me was the spicy tuna roll. It's a big layered roll that has no rice and soy beans on the bottom. I did not care for it much because I felt like the tuna was not fresh. It seemed like the roll has been pre-made and left in the fridge for when ever needed to be served. 
The cocktails were great! I had a Hawaiian mule that had a delicious pineapple flavor and a black orchid martini.
The service was really good even though the restaurant was super busy. Our server was fast and attentive.  Our bill was super reasonable too. We had 4 drinks in total (the Hun's had Henny and coke) and 4 apps for about $60. Another bonus? They do not skim on the portions for happy hour!

For the most part, the food is pretty good. Majority of the menu (food wise) seems to be reasonably priced and you get what you pay for. I like how they have a slight variety in their menu but still isn't too large of a selection. 

What I ordered was the black truffle burger and chicken nachos. The chicken nachos were delicious! They're served hot on a large plate, have a lot of chicken chunks, and give you both guacamole and sour cream. It's definitely worth ordering for yourself or for the table. The black truffle cheese burger was very flavorful upon first bite. The toppings were placed sloppily and I had to scoop them up from the plate, but it was good! All burgers come with fries (truffle fries for an extra dollar).

The service I received was truly exceptional. I was able to sit exactly where I wanted, and change the channels for multiple televisions so everyone at the table could watch comfortably.

Ashley serviced our end of the table and she did a great job, we had three kids in our party and the other server thoughtfully took their orders first since the adults were chatting over drinks and appetizers. We were celebrating a birthday and the other server brought out the birthday cake our party brought and Ashley gave us plates and a knife to cut the cake and boxed it when we were done. I'd been to Yard House at Town Square before, and it delivered the same great experience - sports on the multiple tvs, packed restaurant and bar, knowledge staff and great service. 

I give it two stars because my dinner entree was incredibly disappointing. I ordered the cilantro lime shrimp with tabouleh salad and will be honest, I was expecting a more substantial portion for $16.00. What I was served however, was five shrimp, a smear of hummus underneath the shrimp and a large scoop of tabouleh salad over two mid-sized romaine leaves. The (luke-warm) shrimp was very tasty and the chilled salad was fresh, but the five shrimps on the plate were not prawns, they were medium-sized shrimp and I was not expecting there to only be five of them. I was famished and this was not the dinner entree I had expected. 

Quite frankly, I would have expected such an ""artful nouveau"" $16.00 rectangular-plated item at a different type of restaurant, not at a loud sports bar type joint. (See my picture)

Next time I will stick to their large Cobb salad or Turkey burger with a cup of soup.

My usually go-to is their truffle Mac N Cheese. Awesomely gourmet and cheesy. Comes in two sizes (reg and large), go with the regular. Will fill you up just fine.

Good news for vegetarians: an abundance of veggie options here! They even offer a tofu-based meat substitute ""chik'n"" in pastas or sandwiches. One of my fav veggie items are the CHIK'N WINGS - offered in three sauces. Opt for the Jerk sauce! A yummy, tangy, Asian dip!

Heads up that their Asian dishes will be very ""Americanized"". Example - their California Roll is NOT your ordinary sushi roll. It is one giant cake! I have ordered this dish with the rice slightly hard a few times, so I don't take my chance anymore. 

One of Vegas' better elections of beer. Everything from wheats, amber, IPA, ciders. Truly something for everyone! My favorite? Watermelon Wheat.

There is option for outside seating which is perfect for summer nights and is often times accompanied with misters to cool you down. 

YH is always a safe choice for an outing location because the food does not disappoint and neither do their drink options. They have a very large selection of beer (if you like cider or just don't feel like drinking a beer/cocktail, try the ace pineapple cider or Stella cider) and even better -- they have great happy hour times! 

Their daytime happy hour is 3 to 6pm. Late night happy hour begins at 10pm until they close. Happy hour here includes a wide range of both food and drink options for a fraction of the price. Unlike some other restaurants, Yard House's happy hour food options are desirable and the portions/prices are reasonable as well. 

Give Yard House a visit if you are looking for a drink and a small bite, or just a full on dinner! This place is versatile. :)",os-sDQoh-hCt2Lg76z6ZUA,3,3,4,regBBwkENDHjLUe4Cuafcw

Frankly, I am glad we ended up at the Yard House because they are one of the most consistent chain restaurants in the business. Plus, they have a 100+ beers on tap which is pretty darn cool. The staffs are usually fast and attentive. 

If you like a menu with a lot of variety I definitely think you'll like this place. The menu offers American food, Mexican food, Italian food and some Asian Fusion selections. I ordered the chicken enchiladas and it was very delicious. The combination of the green and red sauce on it was amazing. The street tacos there are also fun to eat and share as an appetizer. I also recommend the beer sampler. 

All in all, the food is also consistent along with their customer service. It's also a great location to catch a game or if you just want a quick drink at the bar. I will definitely be back for another round. Thanks, Yard House Town Square.",1IDGT7RHqYF76jm7CRuXdQ,1,0,5,bkyJcW5EJkg4RxhgIb2wOA

I have so many favorites here.

4447968,2015-10-06,9,A5Rkh7UymKm0_Rxm9K2PJw,"I've enjoyed Yardhouse in the past, however, my most recent encounter with one of the managers, Leo, has really affected my overall experience and opinion of this restaurant. 

Leo informed my group of friends sitting at the bar that one of my friends would have to leave if she couldn't sit still. It was her birthday and I will be the first to admit she was slightly intoxicated... I would understand if my friend spilled a drink, broke a glass, screamed obnoxiously, or literally fell over in her chair which she did not. She. Did. Nothing.

My friend was a little tipsy and the manager was quick to judge. I understand that if someone at a bar seems intoxicated it is a liability issue, however, I feel there could have been more professional and polite verbiage used to relay that message. This was not the the case. 

Leo was cold and came off rude. The group I was with were all surprised and shocked because as I said earlier, the friend we were with by no means was acting obnoxious or creating a scene. I asked for the man's name who happened to be the manager and he told me it was Leo. He also tried to grab his business card and realized he didn't have one with him. He didn't offer to retrieve one for me either.

... I get it. Working in the restaurant industry I know there are a lot of difficult and intoxicated guests to deal with (I've been a server back in the day myself) however, there is also a thing called empathy and delivery which goes a long way. I don't work in the restaurant industry anymore but I do work in guest service management. The manager could have asked politely what he would have liked to occur, but that didn't happen. I hope Yardhouse management improves because I actually really liked that place. My interaction with Leo really bothered me (still does). 

Mitch, a bartender working at the time tried to defend Leo and didn't show empathy as well. He event spelt his name out for me because he was very confident in defending why I was wrong to feel offended with my interaction with Leo. Not sure if Mitch understands what the interaction consisted of. He sure was quick to make me feel like I was in the wrong.

Unfortunately this recent experience has really affected my overall experience with Yardhouse. I will not be recommending anyone to this restaurant nor I will be returning. Being a large chain as they are I hope they improve in customer service to retain some loyal business.",WJhQpdUHoFCtpU6gHFjVlQ,19,6,1,4i2nOOUgdRUPa6zn94M5Vw

Over 100 beers on tap that really make it both a challenge and a goal to try each one.  During Happy Hour the place does get pretty busy, but service wasn't the least bit slow for me while I was over.  In fact, our server was constantly attentive and made sure we got all of our food and drink orders in.

I ordered a Miami Ice Martini ($6) and my friend and I shared some buffalo wings and seared ahi sashimi.  The drink was strong, the wings were bangin' (much better than the Hooters ones) and the sashimi was fresh and tasty.

I often frequent this place with friends or bring out of town guests here because the menu is extensive and there is something on it for just about everyone. Plus the beer selection, as well as the wine, and mixed drinks have the ability to please every palate. 

Recently I brought my sister and brother-in-law here based off of those facts. Three people with probably rather different tastes is kind of a hard combo to deal with when choosing a dining spot. Luckily, Yard House did the trick. 

There was a wait when we arrived, but it was only about 10 minutes and we were seated in a large, comfy booth, although next to the kitchen and a bit noisy, it was okay as we could all still carry on a conversation without yelling to be heard. 

The run down of the food went as following -

Grilled Artichoke Appetizer - delicious! The artichoke was grilled perfectly and served with a garlic dipping sauce. We ate every bite and then tried to eat more. Baked potato chips were also served with it, the perfect appetizer.

Seared Ahi Steak Sandwich - Okay, this was just about the best thing I've had to eat in a LONG time. The ahi was seared perfectly, somewhat cooked around the outside, and deliciously raw on the inside. The pairings in the sandwich were perfect- spinach, Swiss cheese, tomato, and caramelized onions. It comes on a rye bread and with shoe-string french fries. Honestly, this sandwich is worth every penny. 

Cuban Roast Pork Dip - My sister ordered this sandwich and it looked very good. It came with a BBQ au jus and shoe-string french fries. 

House Salad & Clam Chowder - My brother-in-law opted for this. The soup came out piping hot and he said it was really good. My sister declared it to be good too. The house salad was BIG, much bigger than I was expecting, so kudos to YH on the portions. 

Overall I have to give it up to Yard House. This most recent visit was definitely a 5 star affair. Everything was cooked well, service was good, the wait wasn't long, the noise level was decent, and  we were in and out with zero problems.",hZfzVrhsCQ9JDAb2jYoJNQ,1,1,5,Pu6qpYubIXu6bt5c4_W5Bw

We shared an order of Fried Calamari.  It came with tartar and spicy tomato sauce.  There was a good amount of tentacles and body breaded in a heavy cornmeal breading.

My friend ordered the half order of Ahi Crunchy Salad which had 4 pieces of seared rare ahi, field greens, asian slaw and crispy wontons tossed in soy vinaigrette.  The full order had 6 pieces of seared rare ahi and more field greens.

My other friend ordered the lunch portion of BBQ Pizza and a Classic Ranch Salad.  The salad was just iceberg lettuce with shredded carrots, cucumber, and tomatoes.

I ordered the lunch portion of half a Roast Beef Dip and a cup of Clam Chowder.
There was not a spoon on the plate, so I had to track down our server.  The Roast Beef Dip was tender and the creamy horseradish was really good.  Next time I would order a whole Roast Beef Dip which comes with fries.  i had also ordered a side of french fries.  They were warm, not freshly fried.

The largest Bar / Sports Bar I've ever been to!"" The Bar must have been forty yards long with a circular seating arrangement... that's almost a football field length of seating just to consume liquor or watch your favorite team on one of the LCD TVs. Don't feel comfortable at the ""Bar""? ... well there's dimly lit table seating around the extremities of the interior of the Yard House, as well as outside seating under a covered patio.

If you're not consuming your liquor at Happy Hour here at the Yard House... you have a lot more money to spare than I do, or you're just being extravagant for no rational reason. Lindeman's Framboise at only $4.00 a glass! Raspberry Cider, also at the same price! And, the Happy Hour extends late into the night...

As for the food... specifically the Appetizers... the menu needs work...

  Spicy Thai Chicken Pizza (*) First of all, it's a thin-crust Pizza.. a 
      negative already! Carrots, Green Onion, Cilantro, Mozzarella, 
      Macadamia Nuts, and Firecracker Sauce as a topping... essentially 
      very, very close to a Vegan Pizza. Prior apologies to all Vegans... 
      Yecch!
  Chicken Lettuce Wrap (**** 1/2) Stir fried, smoked tofu, pine nuts and 
      green onions with three dipping sauces with a meat choice of either 
      Chicken, Tiger Shrimp, or Shiitake and Portabella Mushrooms. Very, 
      very good. 
  Onion Ring Tower (****) Beer battered and dusted with Parmesan 
      Cheese... served with Chipotle and Ranch Dip Sauces. And... I don't 
      even like Onion Rings... that's saying a lot for the perfectly made 
      Onion Rings!
  Chicken Nachos (**) Thin, and I mean thin Tortilla Chips with Cheddar 
      and Jack Cheese, Tomato, Cilantro, Onions, Guacamole and spicy 
      whole Pinto Beans. Chips were deteriorating as we sat. Word to the 
      wise... consume this appetizer quickly, or it just turns into mush. 
      Definitely, not as good as one of the many cheap, late-night Taquerias 
      you can find around Las Vegas.
  Fried Calamari (**** 1/2) An appetizer which I never order because most 
      restaurants usually over-fry the Calamari where it becomes 
      super-tough and chewy... but not that night when we consumed it! 
      Served with spicy Tomato and Tartar sauces.
  Spicy Tuna Roll (**) Definitely, not a favorite at the table. Not enough 
      Tuna, maybe? Or it could've been the odd mixture of textures with an 
      almost crunchy Edamame. Seared Ahi Tuna with Avocado, Edamame, 
      Cucumber and Wasabi Soy Sauce.
  Classic Sliders (***) Nothing special here. Four mini Burgers made from 
      Naturewell Natural Angus Beef served with Cheddar Cheese, House 
      Special Sauce, Fries and Pickle. Preparation of the Fries were better 
      than the Sliders!

Do you know what it takes to transport all the Liquor over to the Bar area? As I was looking around Yard House to take some pics... I noticed the shiny pipes running along the ceiling emanating from the entrance area of Yard House heading off in the direction of the Bar. There are, literally, dozens of pipes that feed liquor to the bar stored in an Orange-hued room ( http://static.px.yelp.com/bphoto/uxe7CbaX8_9H82ljSg2Jxw/l ) ( http://static.px.yelp.com/bphoto/a1UfHHYUMxC145fLbNcyLw/l ) to the left of the entrance as you walk in. Moving that much Liquor takes quite a bit of technology!

It was just after the holidays so everyone was still going to the mall.  The parking lot was very full but was lucky enough to find a parking nearby.  I parked by h&m which isn't too far from Yardhouse.  They do have happy hour from 3p-6p which I sadly missed :( 

As we walked into the restaurant, there was a lot of people waiting.... It was very crowded inside especially because It was too cold to wait outside.  We waited for about 15-20 minutes which isn't too bad.  There is open seating at the bar but we had kids so we got a nice booth in the corner.  Once we sat down, we were handed menus. Our server came to us in about 2-3 minutes to take our drink orders.  It did take a while for our drinks to come in but understandable.  We ordered 3 kids meals and they each come with a drink, entree with 2 sides, and a choice of dessert for only $6.99! My friend got the gumbo and I decided to get the Margherita pizza and truffle fries.  

The 2 adult orders surprisingly came out before the kids meals.  The kids ordered Mac n cheese and teriyaki chicken.  The kids juices also came after the meals because they told us that the bar was backed up.  Everything did taste great though!! The pizza was very hot and delicious.  Cheesy just the way I liked It.  The truffle fries were awesome!!! I'm craving some right now.  I also had the kids Mac n cheese which didn't really have much flavor.

We were told it would be a twenty minute wait, but I'm pretty sure it was more like ten. Our waitress Nancy was super friendly, but it seemed like she was stretched pretty thin - I think they're understaffed. 

Here's what we tried...

Deviled Eggs - a classic deviled egg covered with a sweet tomato sauce and topped with bacon. SO GOOD! 

Egg Rolls - solidly delicious, but probably nothing different/special from anywhere else. Basically, it made me happy because I love egg Rolls. 

Chicken Fingers - just like the egg Rolls, pretty much like what you'd find anywhere else. It's well done and can hit the spot. Also, they come with Fries which can be upgraded to truffle Fries. 

Truffle Fries - Awesome! You can actually taste the truffle flavor, unlike at so many places. The Fries are skinny cut and pretty drench in the oil. But they have enough Crunch so it didn't bother us. 

Short Rib - meh. Great flavor, but too chewy for me. Also, it was accompanied by sautéed spinach that hadn't been seasoned at all and simply tasted of the oil they'd been cooked in 

Burger - my friend Mr. P ordered this. While he enjoyed his burger, he made the mistake of getting a side of veggies instead of fries. The veggies seemed to simply be steamed and not seasoned - no good. 

Butterscotch Pudding - awesome! Definitely my favorite dessert! 

Coconut Ice Cream - much better and more exciting than most coconut ice creams out there. Not only was it full of toasted coconut shavings, but it was bursting with flavor! It almost tasted like a Samoa cookie without the chocolate. 

S'more Brownie - fail. Wouldn't get this again. While it was a generous portion, it was wider than it was deep. I was hoping for a deep dish, warm, Gooey Brownie. Instead, it was only a little thicker than a cookie and very dry. No good.

She called and wasn't able to make a reservation prior, but we were  still seated within about 45-60 mins which was still pretty quick for peak time. 

The service was pretty good. Our waiter was trying very hard to make sure we had everything and constantly checked on us, but the bar was pretty slow with getting our drinks ready.

Food wise I love so many options here. This time my bae and I shared the calamari and the classic ranch salad. The calamari was pretty average, but good. The salad was a bit disappointing dressing wise, if it's called a classic ranch salad you would think I should certainly be able to taste the ranch, but not the case with this one. I recommend trying the grilled cheese or lamb burger here. Those are typically my go to options. 

Overall another great yard house location located in a central part of the valley. It's a great spot to grab dinner or a drink after a afternoon shopping spree.",OXSJCjKtvZPf-YPDCXcWZg,1,2,4,jF88wNTR7qTMkE-ZXeKPdg

However, yesterday I was there for happy hour with a small group, and we had our share of issues.  First - for whatever reason, the waitress stacked like 7 or more menus on the table, and never picked them up.  As people came to join us outside on the patio, we had to keep moving them on top of the planter divider things that separate the patio from the sidewalk.

We ordered different flavored teas.  The waitress brought separate ice cups and was very slow to refill tea.  She also never brought the limes my friend asked for twice, until we flagged her and reminded her - she had to write it down.

For happy hour, they make the chicken lettuce wraps half off but not the mushroom - weird.  So we opted for chicken...and out they came, with the nastiest lettuce cups I have ever seen - completely brown and pink, looking rotten and absolutely inedible.  Since the waitress disappeared, I had to wait like 15 minutes before showing her and asking for new lettuce.  Quite a while later, she brought a plate with nastier, browner, pinker lettuce.  I told her no way, and she took that away to show her manager.  She took that off the bill and replaced it with another item, and luckily the protocol is to have the manager come out.  The manager apologized for the ""bad lettuce shipment,"" but I explained to her that under no circumstances should anyone in the kitchen allow nasty lettuce to be served, especially not TWICE.  I told her I strongly recommend that they do not serve lettuce to another person that day.  I hope she took my advice.  Kinda turned me off....would rather come back for beer than food now.",T5KBc5QbwZ-Oj9ApE4vZJA,2,2,3,Oufff8XKgUXQ9S_TCujiXA

4573115,2010-12-07,0,A5Rkh7UymKm0_Rxm9K2PJw,"To start off, I will confess...I am already a big Yard House fan. The main reason is it's spin on comfort food and enormous beer selection. That being said...Town Center Yard House gets the fourth star rating because of it's proximity in relation to everything around: shopping, movies, and bars. 

Here, Yard House is the perfect addition to a night out at the mall. 
- Gone shopping? Get a beer. 
- Seen a movie? Get some dinner. 
- Headed to the Blue Martini for a Natural Vibrations concert? Drink here first.

The ambiance here is always great: kind of like a dark SUPER SIZED PUB full of beer selections from around the country, hell even the world. 

The food is as I said before, comfort food (or it could be the only things I decide to order). My usual order consists of either the Mac and Cheese Squared, Turkey Pot Pie, or Grilled Cheese (with bacon and tomato)/tomato soup. The M&C2 is perfect, what more could one ask of pasta, cheese, bacon, chicken, and truffle oil...brilliance in every spoonful. Turkey Pot Pie is an entire plate of turkey, cream sauce, and veggies covered in a flaky fresh crust. And Lastly, the grilled cheese is the perfect accompaniment of a cold day...or cold beer. Speaking of beer, try the sampler. Daily, the beers of choice switch up so enjoy the variety. 

Service is quick with the drinks, courteous, and fun to be around. 

Yard House in Town Center exceptional. Beware, place gets crowded pretty quick. Give it a try and see how new age comfort food is made.",YDkC5VVT8s9NlIZtAr8NUA,1,2,4,br-uBaKs6XFNqqHrmzZetQ

We ordered drinks, I had a half yard of Anderson Valley Wild Turkey Bourbon Stout and my girlfriend had a Pineapple Express cocktail, both delicious! We started with the chicken nachos, really good, they used poached chicken, kinda weird, but still delicious! She had the lamb burger and I had the blackened chicken torta sandwich! Both equally awesome! If the food and service wasn't good enough, the manager, I assume based on his outfit, stopped by the table to check on our experience! Level 5 service right there!

Patience run thin here today. Which I don't understand, because it's usually my favorite Yardhouse location to come to in town...

Came in 10 before 3 (it's 4:10 as I'm writing this) as I'm writing about this, for reference and it wasn't busy for it being the start of happy hour. I get sat quickly enough, but my server doesn't come to even take a drink order for 10 minutes. Ok, whatever. No big deal.

When she arrives, I ask for a Grey Goose martini extra dirty and water. The water arrives and so does my meal, a small ahi crunch salad, but no martini. I watched it get made at the bar from my booth and sit at the bar while my server grabbed other drinks for her tray (maybe there wasn't enough room?), walk between the server's POS station and the host stand, take the order of the table next to me, AND serve their drinks. In the midst of all of that, I stopped another server to say that I think that drink at the bar is mine and she told me she'd inform my server.... my server comes back to apologize for the wait and she's just waiting on the bartender to actually make it to bring to me... walks over, picks up the SAME martinis and brings it to me. And it was extra dry, not extra dirty. Go figure.

But wait! There's more!

I ask another passerby server if I can send it back and have it remade, and they again informed my server who came to ask what was wrong with my order and I explained politely but ended up not wanting a drink at all. I asked for my food menu back in the interest of ordering sliders to go and that took another 15 minutes so I decided against another food order and requested the check, which has just been presented to me. It's another table's check, for a bunch of happy hour cocktails and fries, etc... remember how I said I only had a small ahi salad?

4655289,2013-04-25,4,A5Rkh7UymKm0_Rxm9K2PJw,"After and independent of a UYE, when I join my Yelp friends for socializing at the Yard House, it becomes the Yelp House. The Yard House is a fun place for groups of friends to hang out over beer and good food. The restaurant does a commendable job accommodating large groups. Both times that I went to the Yard House we had no problem getting a large table. The service is precise. And when it is time to pay, we had our own checks. Substitute Yelpers for a gathering of general friends, or a date and the Yard House is everybody's social house.

  The Yard House is my choice chain restaurant for beer selection. The Yard House is to beer what Baskin Robbins is to ice cream. Whereas Baskin Robbins features 31 flavors of ice cream,, the Yard House features approximately 600 flavors of beer (I counted the beer listed in the menu). If I were to go to the Yard House one Friday a week to order a flavor of beer, according to my math it would take me 12 years to done this. Or if I were to go to the Yard House everyday to try a flavor of beer, it would take me 2 years to do this. Some of the beers may have been listed under a couple of different headings. The deal is that the Yard House selection of beer is as good as it gets. 

  There are eleven series of beer. There is the chalkboard series. The cider series is the seasonals. The light beer is less than 5.8% alcohol content. This series includes many of the name brands such as Michelob and Budweiser. There is the Honey Fruit series which includes BBC Strawberry Blonde and Blue Point Blueberry. There is the wheat series that includes Blue Hawaiin Hefeweizen. The Malty series includes Bass Ale and Alaskin Amber. The Dark series includes Big Sky Moose Drool and Bison Organic Chocolate. The bitter series includes Anchor Liberty and Blue Point Hoptical Illusion. And there is the Strong and Effervescent series. The menu lists the alcohol content. Unless I overlooked something, the Allagash Curieux is the strongest at 11% alcohol content. There are three sizes of beer. I went for the middle size which is the pint. For the record I greatly appreciated the Firestone.

  This very Yard House features a Happy Hour and Late Night Specials. The Happy Hour is Monday-Friday 3-6 pm and Late Night Special Sunday-Wednesday 10-close. They include domestic pints from $4.25-$5.75, well drinks $4.27-$4.75 and wine by glass $2 off. If you are up to food there are half price appetizers & pizza.

  The food is good but I've tasted better. My complaint about the roasted turkey club is that it was layers of sandwich instead of the sandwich I am accustomed to. The classic cheeseburger was a good choice. The fries are these skinny things that remind me of potato sticks. I feel that the Yard House ought to expand their fries selection to include steak fries and just thicker fries.

  When I socialize at a restaurant, I am big on the music that is playing. I was won over by the music playing. I heard great music from Led Zeppelin, the Rolling Stones and classic rock era.

  The Yard House excells at their selection of beer. Whether it is my Yelp House or social House I intend to return. When I return I plan to try the Blue Point Blueberry beer that is brewed in Blue Point, NY; 5 miles south of where I lived. Gotta be patriotic to my home town.

Havent been to yard house in a few months so we decided to grab a drink and small food while shopping. Rob was a great server! He was attentive and had a great sense of humor. Only downside about our experience was that the onion rings came out cold so they weren't very appetizing. The beers weren't extensively cold either- in between cold and lukewarm. It was overall kind of frustrating but we had a good day so nothing bothered us too much. Will go back though...on a crowdless day perhaps!,DQJ0x5p1Mo6ZjWuICyWgFw,0,0,4,vz51xIxCFALfUr3oKQs8lQ

I went to LV for the first time last weekend and some local friends took a few of us non-local folks out for dinner Saturday night and boy did they pick a great place! We had a group of 6 and the wait wasn't bad for a busy/packed restaurant. They said it was their favorite spot and I'm sure glad we went off the strip to grab a bite to eat because they were right, this place really is great!

Their beer selection is huge, the food all sounds great and I definitely had a hard time trying to narrow down what I wanted. If only my tummy could consume as much food as my eyes could! We got several rounds of drinks, some appetizers (the sweet potato fries with sauce are soOoo tasty!), and then I chose the Crusted Parmesan Chicken with sun-dried tomato and mushroom sauce. I don't really even like mushrooms but I was a member of the clean plate club here! My husband got some garlic noodles and they were amazing! Mmmmm!

The server was super friendly, helpful, quick, and fun! We watched some games on tv's, laughed for a while, and had a great time. I wish that my hometown had this restaurant! The prices are great, the food presentation and quantity is awesome, and I would highly recommend checking this place out.

I ordered some grapefruit beer (it was probably ale) and it was aaaamazing! I usually go for ales since my taste buds like those better. I also ordered the vampire tacos. They were good but really heavy. I probably wouldn't order it again because of how heavy it is. I'm pretty sure it's supposed to be like that though.

Another restaurant that I have frequented quite a few times since it first opened In 2008 and have sampled most of the menu. It's been a while since I've visited, but I decided to keep it simple and go back to my favorites.

SPICY TUNA ROLL: They'll warn you EVERY time - it's not really a sushi roll. It's a beautiful stack of chopped cucumbers and edamame, layered with spicy tuna, and topped with avocado. A little sriracha, sesame oil, and sauce around it to add some flavor. Delicious and light!
ORGANIC TOMATO BISQUE (WITH GRILLED CHEESE): You don't have to get the grilled cheese, but you haven't had a grilled cheese sandwich until you've had this one. Crusty, oily artisanal bread with four fabulous cheeses and tomato oozing between their slices. With the hearty tomato bisque, crazy good.
FIRECRACKER WINGS: I'm not crazy about wings nor do I order this often, but the ""firecracker"" sauce is just damn good. Zesty, spicy, sweet, and very flavorful! Give them a whirl to get away from the boring hot, medium, or wild wing sauces.
PEACH APPLE COBBLER: It's just really good. Not much to explain. I tried it the first time in the Trio Dessert Sampler and I ended up liking this one better than their soufflés. The ""cobbler"" part is really great.

There's H/H in the middle of the day (M-F) from 3pm-6pm and at night after 10pm (not Fri and Sat), so that's a great time to go for great deals on their appetizers and alcohol. I'm not a big fan of their martinis (not sure why, but I've tried several on multiple occasions and they are really terrible), however, there are people that love them.

Though parking was kind of difficult, I love the location of the restaurant in Town Square.  Town Square reminds me of The Grove in LA without the snootiness.

I loved my Cuban Roast Pork Sandwich!  The pork was moist and the pepperjack cheese was melted nicely.  The au ju was a perfect accompaniment...even though the sammie didn't need it because the meat was not dry at all.  It also came with a mountain of crispy shoestring fries.

Buffalo wings and the BBQ chicken pizza were very good. We asked for more Buffalo sauce though as the sauce was too dry on the wings. The pizza has thin crust, which I like. Definitely would order these again. 

Onion ring tower is just above average, in my opinion. At first, I thought we would only get 5 rings, but they actually gave us A LOT. They came with two kinds of sauce. Their sauces are super duper good. They brought the onion rings to another level. I don't know how they make their sauces, but I wish I knew their recipes.

The tap selection is unparalleled, which is great for people like me who like to see choices that go far beyond the basics like Sam Adams and Fat Tire.  They have scores of beers on tap that I haven't seen at any other bars in this city.  The only bad thing I could say is that they require 80% of your party to be present before they will give you a table.  That can be frustrating when you know that 10 co-workers are going to show up, yet they won't give you a big table because you only have 6 people present.

I've frequented this location NUMEROUS times, but today was probably a weirder experience. Our server, Jenn seemed very excited to get a nice hefty party of 8 at the table next to us! They seemed like a nice crew, beers and appetizers all around, you know the gang just talking about workflow drama. Our server was definitely more interested in the energy from that table, rather than the quiet somber table of two we had. Don't blame her, make your money girl. I just wish she wasn't so monotone, we are here to get a head change and she's killin the vibe a bit! I couldn't take her recommendations of food seriously because she didn't seem enthusiastic about anything she was naming. 

This used to be THE happy hour spot, but lately I've found other hot spots to hit up! The portions have definitely changed over the last few months, which I should have asked if that was a major difference on the menu since my last visit. I enjoyed some skinny margaritas, because I've taken months off of drinking to focus on my fitness so I didn't want to drink my calories in alcohol! They were okay! I definitely felt a buzz but I just wish the drinks came at a consistent pace to keep the vibe going. Other than that, the lemon drop was alright but the skinny cosmo martini is one of the better ones, in my opinion. 

The appetizers have changed so much, I'm sure the other reviews have pointed that out as well. I enjoyed the Hawaiian pizza and spinach dip(to die for!) The poke nachos & fried calamari are on such a big plates, I'm not a seafood eater so I felt bad my poor date had to chow all these seafood apps by himself. 

Other than that, I feel sitting at the bar provides you the best service! 



UPDATE: 10/2 I just checked my credit card app & it looks like my lovely server Jen changed the numbers on my tip to leave herself a nice $21.46 tip! Man, was I generous or what?! HAH! good thing I caught this talking to my friend about credit cards and debt and stuff haha. Wow, I feel betrayed, however the manager Allison definitely took charge on this one. 

I'm still in disbelief that someone changed the numbers on something I AUTHORIZED to an amount they DESIRED. I'm very sad one of my favorite locations would employ someone that could potentially do this on a regular basis. Please double, if not TRIPLE check your receipts before leaving! I'm still in shock. I'll be doing a survey, contacting corporate and going down later this week to verify my signature and speak with management in regards to this.

They have an excellent beer selection, which is the primary reason I keep coming back. 

A buddy and I hit the Yardhouse for dinner this last Saturday before the UFC fight. The wait was fine, and we were seated a nice corner booth. The young lady who sat me was super friendly and attentive. Once my buddy arrived, we had to wait far longer then usual for our waitress to grab drink orders and refills (which were beers). 

The calamari appetizer was on point. I ordered carnitas and pork belly tacos, which comes with a side of rice and beans. When the food arrived, it was cold and I was to hungry to send it back. The carnitas taco was flavorful, but the pork belly (which was a micro portion of meat) was bland, and the fatty part was not crispy, which is how I've always had pork belly served. Couple that with being cold, and I spit the fat out into the napkin. Gross. Maybe the pork belly bao at Fat Choy restaurant has ruined me when it comes to pork belly. 

My buddies fish & chips were good, with a healthy serving of fries. I hope the food issue was just a bad night for Yardhouse. In the past, I've always enjoyed the food. I hope they get it fixed, especially with all the close by competition in Town Square. Cheers!",2cuoUfAC3rhRS3nj9cf0Cg,2,1,3,xlJ_kcx_IDK1ef9kDF-75Q

They didn't put out ketchup for me and none of them paid enough attention to see my hand wave at them. So I ate without.

Beer after beer after beer...beers you have never heard of, eagerly waiting to be sampled.  I came in with my family for a late lunch (3:00 on a Saturday) so there was no wait.  The service was great.  I have two complaints, though.  First, the beer sampler is mediocre at best.  It was your typical six 5-oz glasses, but the choices were already set.  Whoever picked the beers for the sampler must have been feeling very uninspired, because they had two Gordon Biersch beers.  Gordon Biersch is a good beer, but I feel that with the huge selection available, it is definitely on the JV squad of beers.  If you go to Yard House looking to try something new and exotic, not just the microbrews they sell at your local grocery store, you would be better off convincing your dining partners to purchase a few different pints rather than relying on the sampler.
Second, the portabello burger was unimpressive.  The bun turned mushy and fell apart when I tried to eat it by hand.  Maybe it was meant to be eaten with a fork and knife and I am some uncultivated country rube unacclimated to the proper use of dining utensils.  But I think the primary purpose of going to the Yard House is to drink beer; having food available (even lackluster portabello burgers) is a consolation prize.",v_sQXr6iEusw50y_35_ZYg,0,0,3,Zf-SmeW1E232z3tgElI5xg

Fan-effin-tastic!!  I ordered it, despite thinking of every dry, tasteless ""healthy"" burger I've ever eaten.  My expectations were low.  Granted, I've never ordered anything at Yardhouse before that I didn't like, but the pessimism from my experience with healthy non-beef burgers trumped my consistent satisfaction with the food from Yardhouse.  

Our meals came quickly and my neat little plate of burger and salad (with dressing on the side, which I didn't even ask for, thanks server!!!) actually looked quite delicious.  Upon my first bite, I was in heaven!  It was juicy, tasty, delicious goodness in my mouth.  It came topped with roma tomatoes, which I think really sealed the deal.  At 5 ounces, I finished my entire plate and felt perfectly full, unlike most of the time when I go out to lunch and overstuff my face.  I was so happy that I promptly forgot about the annoying sales rep I had dealt with at a meeting earlier that morning. I was ready to go back to work with a renewed pep in my step.

The service at Yardhouse is always fast, efficient and friendly.  Although, I used to have this one server that would always try to upsell shots and drinks during my business meetings.  It was quite awkward, but I haven't seen him the last few times I've been, so maybe he quit when he realized the lunch crowd here was not exactly his demo.

Yard house, a veggie/vegan portion of the menu that has mock meat dishes.  This basicall means, you can can get most the items with meat on the menu, with veggie meat instead.  

I had a grilled spicy chicken sandwich on sourdough, with fries.  It was good,  not huge (which is good), and it came with Fries...The yard house fries are so good, since they use truffle oil.  YAY!  At the time i ordered my server wasn't sure if everything was 100 percent vegan, without having to ask he went out of his way to make sure I was eating no animal products. (THANK YOU!).

During our visit, we even had a shift change, where our original waitress was kind enough to let us know she was leaving and who was taking over.  

Although the rest of our table had appetizers, The Husband and I arrived in time for entrees:

* New York Steak Salad ""green beans, roasted peppers, avocado, crispy potatoes, red onion and baby lettuce tossed in a gorgonzola vinaigrette with beefsteak tomatoes and pickled egg"" ($16.95) - A generous and flavorful salad, loaded with the ingredients listed and a tasty steak.

* Cuban Roast Pork Dip ""tomatoes, pepper jack cheese, pickles, dijon and garlic aioli on french bread grilled with bbq au jus"" ($12.65) - This was The Husband's order and I had a bite.  It wasn't that great, especially when I recall my previous experience with a Cuban sandwich.  The fries were good though.

My concern was more with service.  The waiter asked the birthday girl what kind of dessert she wanted (out of three choices), and she went for the Chocolate Souffle Cake ""mini serving with vanilla ice cream, served warm"".  When it arrived, there was no candle which surprised us all.  (How are you supposed to sing happy birthday without a candle to blow?)  And he only gave us one spoon, which reminded me that he never brought back dessert menus for the rest of us.  At this point, we didn't bother ordering dessert since the birthday girl already had hers.  That part made the experience disappointing.

The other waiter was able to do a split tender on the check, which was helpful.  (Although he put the costs wrong on my receipt, oh well.)  I usually think Yard House is on top of things, but I guess they weren't that night.",rt3PC7WCgCKsoufmQJELfw,10,4,3,f2sQuiQ51WNh0gy6DxDMVg

Also 8/10 you have OUTSTANDING service. Tho this was not the case the other day. For the most part. 

We came in and got sat with Seth. Food was awesome. Except the Thai Chicken Pizza. It was so soggy that when you picked up a slice everything would fall off. Now I would say toppings but no. EVERYTHING. That is where my only issue was until.

So Seth was busy yes. Though the other three tables around me, he stopped and had a full on conversation. My partner and I, were taking our niece out, and wanted to show her a restaurant that is more than your basic Chili's. I got a gift card from a family member, so why not use the opportunity. Teach her real table manners while you eat out. Now I literally sank in my seat with what happened next.

The Pizza was either under cooked, or they put too much sauce all over it. What ever the case, after flagging down Seth, and just asked for the pizza to be taken off. As I didn't want a new on at that point as everything else was eaten. 

I asked Seth if he could split the check and CHARGE me for the Onion Rings. My exact statement was. Can you split the check and put the Onion Rings on one check so I can pay with a Debit card, and be able to tip you. You can't tip off a Gift Card. 

He literally stoped and looked at me and was like ""Yeah, I mean you better tip me.""



No. No way. So we still just continued to pay, and I went up to ask for a manager. After waiting and speaking to a manager she did reverse all the charges, and asked to come back again. I did return and had a much better experience at Red Rock. I have a review there too... I recommend staying away from this location, as other reviews state, they have problems with regulars. Though they don't realize they could have a regular also if they wanted to treat everyone like that.",K7TwsKP-uvnzIoij7CqzjQ,2,0,3,fo30Af0Ib40n2Xi7gS5DHw

We ordered a bunch of stuff so I got to try a little bit of everything. The sweet and sour ""chicken"" off the vegetarian menu was so good!  It's made out of soy but it's crunchy sweet and sticky. I also enjoyed the texture. I got to try the truffle burger and garlic fries. Liked it both. It was good, nothing really special but definitely a solid burger. The fries are cut thin and they were generous with the garlic. I got the angel hair pasta with all kinds of vegetables and olives in the half size. Portion is a little small but I wasn't that hungry so it worked out. I enjoyed it but it wasn't my favorite dish. I kept eyeing other people's food. I think there's too many olives in it.  I also liked their Korean steak dish with rice. It came with sautéed spinach that were delicious. 

Since it was a birthday they were nice enough to give the birthday girl a free dessert. Ice cream and a brownie. They also split the check for 20 people. That's amazing!  Love it when places can do that so you don't have to worry about calculating it and splitting the tips and tax. Saved us the headache!

While dining there a few weeks ago I was completely shocked at how bad the service was. At first they messed up our drink orders.. we shrugged it off.. no big deal..

Then they bring out the completely wrong food.. So we send it back.. then another 20 minutes goes by and the first half of the table is done and ready to go.. Then finally they bring out the food. Two of which items were burgers that were ordered medium rare and came out burnt.. To make matters worse the server never came back for drink refills and we eventually had to find someone to do that for us as well.

5042258,2012-06-11,1,A5Rkh7UymKm0_Rxm9K2PJw,"Birthday party on a budget.  Happy Hour half off appetizers and drinks after 10pm, Say What?!

Last night, I joined two of my friends at the Yard House to celebrate one of their birthdays.  I've eaten at the Yard House many o' times  and love the beer choices.  The experience/food is not the worst, but it's not the best.  It's great for happy hour and I'm sticking to that!

For drinks, I just got the Fat Tire pint for about $5.  Although I appreciate the 130+ beer choices, I'm partial to my Fat Tire/Newcastle beers.  For food, we got a few appetizers which were all half off:  First, the  Jamaican Jerk style boneless wings.  Came with a sweet hoisin type dipping sauce. The chicken was tender and the batter was delightful.  Next, we had Moo Shu egg rolls-chicken, chili cream cheese, carrots, green onions, cilantro, spinach with apple ginger plum sauce.  The chicken was a little dry but was redeemed with the sweet plum sauce.  Lastly, we got the chicken nachos-spicy pinto beans, cheddar, jack, red & green sauce, tomato, cilantro, onions, guacamole, sour cream.  It's a huge serving, but just your average bar nachos.  The cheese was a little hard.

I did appreciate the great service that night.  The manager came over a few times, because a drunk lady invited herself on our table and then asked for us to pay her bar tab.  She was a little loud but somewhat funny.  Our server was cordial, but not to impressionable.  

The Happy Hour will continue bringing me back to the Yard House.  It isn't busy and we got a table right away.  There's typically a younger crowd which offers a hip vibe in my opinion.  Let's just say that overall, I wouldn't necessarily wait longer than 15 minutes for a table unless you're crazy about beer.",CNaaizAUc2c4WIb1M3BBPw,1,1,3,qUJqh2pu56JbP9bg86AyjQ

5051013,2010-11-17,4,A5Rkh7UymKm0_Rxm9K2PJw,"Lets preface how I even ended up here: 

I was having a bad week (I got sick with a stomach virus, sick boyfriend, dog got sick from ingesting cat litter pellets, water heater broke, fought with my mom on her birthday call, neighbors stole my trashcans, my iPhone broke) so the Yelperazzi got together to try to turn things around. It's a real Yelp success story....We came as strangers and discovered friends. I mean I adore a lot of people on Yelp, but I'm particularly lucky to have met Jieun L, Anthony M., Elnino F, and Andy T who cared 
enough to get me out of the house and get me out of my birthday funk.  My BF reads my reviews and he also turned everything around with the small things. Thank you guys and I love you all. 

Beers are here so I have a hard time not liking this chain...with the circumstance above though I was in that kind of mood to almost hate everything because I'm reserved to being ""done with"" today. It's extra kudos to the Yardhouse reliable brews, decent food and our server that I still enjoyed the restaurant. Yeah there are setbacks like any spots but drink selections make me happy so it was a good choice to turn around any bad day. Our server (Mitch) was pretty good in service, had good beer recommendations and he also brought me a happy birthday brownie sundae (yay!). Nachos were pretty good and loaded with stuff. Sweet potato fries maple bacon sauce was delish that I want to pour that on just about every breakfast item. Ceviche spoons were fresh and light. Chicken garlic noodles- good but go for the plain garlic noodles. There was chicken, tofu, mushrooms, edamame, asparagus, chives, garlic, cheese and it's too much at once. Simple is better with garlic noodles.

BF found a favorite beer worth mentioning- Rogue Dry Hopped Red. Smooth with a bit of hops...a good choice to baby step into the IPAs and DIPAs. He liked it much so that we went back 4days later to order this beer again...we never order twice since our goal is to drink down the whole list (past halfway). 

A few drinks and plates in we were laughing so hard that I was snorting. I mean, I like never do that unless I'm really fighting hard to stop laughing. Anthony has awesome one liners. Jieun makes funny beer faces. Elnino is a violent funny drunk. My BF coined some T-shirt worthy terms at the table. Andy is just a G and always for a good time. 

I expected to go home from work, eat lunch and stay home alone until my BF can get off, head to dinner and go sleep and forget about the day even being my birthday.

I'm a huge fan of the Yardhouse, and even though it's a chain (there are locations all over the west), it has really great food and probably the best on-tap beer selection I've seen in any restaurant.

As for the food, I've tried all kinds of dishes and I've never been disappointed. My favorites are the garlic lobster noodles, the surf and turf burger (a hamburger with asparagus, lobster and a bernaise sauce) and the ""Spicy Tuna Roll"" which may be the best appetizer in this type of restaurant in Las Vegas. It's basically a deconstructed spicy tuna roll that looks like a birthday cake  - with layers of endamame, cucumber, tuna and avocado. It's awesome, and even my kids like snacking on the endamame before the entrees arrive.

The beer selection is immense, and it used to be perfect, but I have to take points off because they recently removed Tetley's (one of my favorite beers). But honestly? Any place that has both obscure Belgian ales AND Pabst Blue Ribbon on draft can't be bad.

As for the kids menu it is what you'd expect, but all the food is just a little better quality than you normally get in a similar restaurant. In fact the mac and cheese is so good (I'm pretty sure there's some truffle oil in there) that your kids might not like it. Though, you'll probably enjoy it the next day for lunch.

I can't vouch for the service in other Yard Houses, but the service in the one in Vegas has always been outstanding. And in the very few instances where we've had a problem, they've taken money off the bill and rectified the situation immediately.

I can't say enough good things about this restaurant, and if you find yourself shopping in Town Square and need a quick place for lunch, it's really the best.",ArQHLbbnNpQiaSaDqsaZzg,1,1,5,HsJjMAj5KfuKUZWHl_Btzg

The California Roll and Spicy Tuna Roll were interesting, in that their presentation was unlike that of those you see in a sushi restaurant.  They actually came as one huge, cut sushi piece, kind of like a cake or a tart.  The presentation was pretty unique, but the taste was also good but nothing really special.  If I was really craving sushi, I'd probably go check out normal sushi places like Osaka, Sushi Club, or something along those lines.  For drinks, I've tried the Mangolicious Martini, the Malibu Peach Martini, Blue Moon beer, and Wyder's Raspberry Cider.  I'm usually not a huge beer drinker, but the Wyder's was good...nice raspberry taste! Of course, looove the martinis!  And to top it all off, we all shared a Kona Coffee Ice Cream Sundae, which was to die for!!! I would definitely be hitting up Yard House a lot for Happy Hour with different groups of friends in the future.",9p3fgn1U9le7baZWjjh6QA,0,0,4,W15JBdTjXUh9rTYpMyvXbg

We received our food and additional drinks seamlessly. We arrived around 5 p.m. and were promptly seated on the patio with the heater over head. Tasha was great about turning it on and off if we got too hot. 

We ordered the Pepper Jack burger with roasted pablanos and a fantastically tasty garlic aioli. The fries were awesome. I am not a fry person and will typically leave them for last. I am so glad I ate them first because they were some of the best fries I've ever had a perfectly seasoned shoe string fry. I love super thin cut crispy fries.

Ironically the first few beers I mentioned Tasha were not on the menu such as Franziskaner Hefe-Weissbier. Tasha was able to point out a couple of other suggestions but I ended up with my other favorite, Tripel Karmeliet. After living years in Milwaukee I have tried a lot of beers. Yardhouse is great for finding things I haven't had in awhile. 

They make a mean turkey club with fresh ingredients the only low note of the dinner or should I say blah moment was the seared ahi tuna that we had for an appetizer. It wasn't bad nor was it great. It was pretty middle of the road and a forgettable part of the evening amongst the great beer and sandwiches we enjoyed. 

We will definitely be back several times for the patio atmosphere, great fries and wide selection of beers and drinks.",-AGXyI_K8StzQ7CGehQ2tQ,0,0,5,sZfIFHPZlbhYBCNGTVavEg

I wouldn't come here just for drinks, or just for the food, or just to eat....come here to eat good food with a huge selection of fairly priced drinks, and plan to be here for a little while.

The service is pretty quick, and a refill of any beverage doesn't take long.  They move around a lot, so it is easy to grab their attention if needed.

The beer selection is one of the best in town, if not the best, and there will be plenty to choose from.  I typically like trying new beers, so I order small sets or their tasting sets to mix the palate.

The food is good...it is not outstanding, but it is good.  Like I mentioned before, treat it like good bar food.  It is good, but I wouldn't come here just to eat...not that noteworthy IMO.

I'm not sure what problems some other reviewers had with the kitchen at this place, but they were on top of their game the afternoon I dropped by.  The Korean BBQ appetizer didn't have as strong a garlic flavor as one would expect, but the meat was perfectly cooked, and the flavor of the meat shone through well.  The rice could have been stickier, though.

The burger I ordered medium was perfectly cooked, and wonderously tender and flavorful.  It certainly goes down as one of the better burgers I've ever had.  The fries were light and crispy, but could have been more numerous.  My friend ordered a very tasty upscale mac'n'cheese which came adorned with perfectly cooked and juicy chicken breast pieces.

The servers were very attentive, and made for a very nice overall experience.

5199403,2010-08-08,19,A5Rkh7UymKm0_Rxm9K2PJw,"This is a review of one thing and one thing only: the turkey burger. Walking around Town Square on a Friday evening with a pal seemed like something different to do (at least for me). 

Honestly, I don't adore Town Square, and I don't really adore any of the limited culinary experiences I have had at Town Square. I do like the relatively pedestrian-friendly space it provides to roam about and window shop. And, I had remembered reading a glowing review of the turkey burger here, so I wanted to give it a nibble.

Let me be upfront and say that if you care about being healthy, you should probably skip this turkey burger. It was frickin' delicious, but I just knew there had to be some bad things in there to make it taste so good. I checked out the nutrition info on the Yard House website, and this mamma jamma has 2810mg of sodium, plus a lot of other large numbers in unhealthy columns. Wow. I should be swimming laps and doing jumping jacks instead of writing this review. At least I substituted the fries for a salad, right?

Just browsing around their nutrition info, I get the impression that the secret to their tasty eats is salt, salt and more salt. Be warned. The California Roll has 3415mg of sodium. Now, how does that happen? I know fish comes from the salty ocean, but... this crab must be dating someone in the Morton family.

So on pure taste, that burger was definitely in the 4 to 5 star range, but I probably will never eat it again.

Despite being absolutely slammed, the service was great. Our waitress didn't even try to rush us off, which really impressed me.

I think I am seriously going to go swim some laps now.",qewG3X2O4X6JKskxyyqFwQ,13,9,3,VJkNFIKwJ_aKxJX-8B5IWw

5260627,2012-07-15,0,A5Rkh7UymKm0_Rxm9K2PJw,"Normally I love going to Yard House and would just stock up on appetizers but this time I decided to order an entree just to try it.

I ordered the ""SEARED SEA SCALLOPS"" which comes with a description of ""orzo pasta with wild mushrooms and white truffle sun-dried tomato sauce"".  Sounded great but was a disappointment when it arrived.

First off, you were given 4 scallops.  Two of which must have been bay scallops and two of which must have been the larger sea scallops.  So the first thing that you noticed was that you received 4 scallops which were not all of the same size but seems to have been cooked for the same amount of time.  Any one that has seared a scallop or eaten a perfectly seared scallop knows that you want a middle that is still slightly translucent.  The two smaller scallops were completely white and over cooked.  The sear on one side too much and the sear on the other side not enough.  With the two larger scallops, it was closer to a perfect sear.  However one scallop was falling apart (bad prep) and almost white on one side receiving no sear at all.

For the orzo pasta, the description indicated wild mushrooms.  I am a huge mushroom fan and love almost every kind that I've had the opportunity to try.  However, I feel that I (as well as most people) probably do not think of button mushrooms or shitake mushrooms as wild mushrooms.  

I know that most sun-dried tomatoes are kept in oil to keep them moist.  But when they were added to the sauce, far too much of the reserve oil was added to the sauce.  If I tilted my plate, bright red oil would be able to leak onto the table below.  It was a far to heavy sauce for such a tiny pasta as orzo.

Now I do realize that I am at Yard House and not a celebrity-chef named sea food restaurant, but I would have at least hoped that their entrées would have been as good as all of the appetizers that I've had.  That a chef there would still be able to provide equally sized scallops for one plate and that I would not receive overly greased pasta.

All in all, this will not detour me from returning to Yard House for some apps or a beer but it will detour me from ordering an entrée again.",0fKCfLixNcnickTwCfwf0Q,1,0,3,i6mhAu2h6JJfVRm_fLJe2A

5291382,2017-08-29,0,A5Rkh7UymKm0_Rxm9K2PJw,"Yard house is a very reliable choice if you are at Town Square. Town Square is one of the more popular malls off the strip in Vegas and it attracts both tourists and locals in roughly equal amounts with an abundance of shopping, entertainment, and restaurants. Of all of the restaurants I would say Yard House is the one I attend the most.

Environment:
The interior of the restaurant is rather large and spacious and you can expect that it will almost always be reasonably full. However despite the busy atmosphere I have rarely had to wait more than 10 minutes to be seated. They have both inside and outside creating as well as a rather large bar, however I usually opt to sit inside taking in account Vegas' weather. My only qualm with the interior would be the lighting which is very dim.

Food:
The menu can be considered as American but they do have influences from many different genres of food. Asian, Italian, and Latin influences can be found in the menu so you can enjoy sashimi, pasta, and tacos at your leisure. Some of my favorite dishes are:
Poke Stack: The cubes of Ahi tuna are very fresh and the sliced serrano peppers give it a nice spice.
Vodka Shrimp Pasta: Very creamy and flavorful with a hint of spice and good helping of shrimp.
Fried Calamari: I love calamari and whenever I get it here it is crispy without being overly breaded. They also include both the legs and the rings which I appreciate and a lot of lemon too.

The drinks are also good, whether it be their extensive beer menu, or my favorite cocktail, the Yuzu gin cooler.

Service:
Service is typically good, albeit a little slow. However due to the busy nature of the restaurant the waiters try their best to be attentive but they get some slack too.


Overall I would definitely recommend Yard House to anyone at Town Square, they are open late and have a great happy hour too!",5fxjUT0sLg9ueMAYtn2PZw,0,0,4,fYMN6iJUlPNvl75NlJ9SUw

5373743,2011-04-29,0,A5Rkh7UymKm0_Rxm9K2PJw,"Boy is Yard House pricey. Good thing for the invention of happy hour. They hold theirs Monday through Friday from 4pm-6pm. My group got there at 4:45 and racked up most of the damage before HH ended, but the last few items boosted the check up by a third. 

The well drinks run for four dollars and change, while the beers cost around four to six dollars. All the appetizers are half off and a great deal. If you are like me, a few of them makes for a better meal than any entree. 

We got the chicken nachos, fried chicken strips, seared ahi, classic sliders, hummus, a pepperoni and mushroom pizza, and chicken wings. If you come during the designated time, then all of these except the hummus are half off. It is a great deal, but I would reconsider if it was at full price. They are generous with their portions. Both the sliders and chicken strips come in an order of four with fries. This was perfect because it matched the number of people at our table. Both dishes would be worth it at the regular price. The ahi tuna was cooked nicely, but the sauce was too salty. It definitely did not need soy sauce, but I used up all the wasabi. The chicken nachos were nothing special. It is a generous portion, but the salsa looked more like marinara, the chicken was on the dry side, and the guacamole lacked the tang and spice. They were also bountiful with the wings. Asking for them to be cooked extra crispy and having the sauce on the side guarantees for perfect wings. The hummus was packed with sodium and tasted a little bitter. The pizza came out quick, bubbling, and beautiful. Too bad, I was too full by that time, but my friend liked it.  

If you ever wanted to try a new beer, but afraid you might not like it, come for happy hour. At worst, you are out a few dollars. At best, you might meet your new best friend. 

Another thing worth mentioning, the staff were on their game tonight. It was not that busy, but our server was awesome. Crystal was funny, sassy, and full of energy. 

The only reason why I gave them three stars is because I worry about the amount of salt they use in all of their dishes. I know people complain about MSG at Chinese restaurant, but I drank five glasses of water while dining and am still guzzling it now.

5390821,2012-10-02,1,A5Rkh7UymKm0_Rxm9K2PJw,"Not sure what's more embarrassing: the fact that the other day before going to see the Master at rave (two thumbs up!) that I spent $120 on dinner for 2 at Yard House, or the fact that I thought it was worth every penny.  This is not to say that the average opinion on the Yardhouse is low, but I do think it's typically thought of as a place to grab some cheap happy hour appetizers and some beer and not a place to spend $30 on entrees.  Well I did that, and I was damn happy with the results.

We arrived shortly before happy hour ended and I started with a Black and Tan and we also ordered the seared Ahi Sashimi appetizer which I was pleasantly surprised to find half off on the happy hour menu (which also discounted the price on the beer a bit).   I've had the Ahi appetizer here several times and it's almost always a winner.  I'll venture to say it's the best of it's kind among chain restaurants.  For entrees my dining partner got the Pepper crusted Filet Mignon and I ordered the Ginger Crusted Norwegian Salmon.   Both were accompanied with Wasabi mashed potatoes which I've always enjoyed for that slight hint of wasabi in every bite.  My salmon was a little masked with all the toppings (namely carrot strings, the ginger crust, and the sesame vinaigrette).   Usually I would find this to be a negative, but I''ll be damned if all of the ingredients really work together here.  I've been known to sneak a bite of the salmon on it's own from time to time anyhow and found it to be nicely cooked.

The one issue with the entire meal was the filet which was ordered medium was a little inconsistently cooked.  Some of it seemed cooked Medium well (little to no pink) while some of it did seem cooked as ordered.  I was able to taste a little of both sections and found them both tasty, though the one with some pink was more to my liking.  

Service was great throughout and we ordered several jack and cokes once happy hour ended and they were constantly being refreshed.  When we informed the waitress we had a movie to make she made sure to bring the check to us quickly.  When the check first arrived I was slightly taken aback by the price (and the amount of alcohol we'd consumed), but realized it had been worth it.  It also made me appreciate that I could go into the Yardhouse and make a choice on whether to have a great $30 experience of a couple of drinks, an onion ring tower and a sandwich, or go all out and have a great steak or piece of fish for extra.  You can't do that (or much of anything else) at Applebee's folks!  

Later on in the theater while everyone else was fleeing for the exit midway through, we sat content.  I initially blamed this on poor movie taste by the others, but in retrospect perhaps it was the contentedness of the meal beforehand that transferred over to our cinema experience.",v3YOx9T4jRSw8XP9Rd9H4g,0,0,4,eH2_RqKBi9UtrUJd8EhoIA

For an app, we had had the onion ring tower once before and my husband ordered it again. It was just like our previous version, just fried onion rings served with dipping sauce, it was just okay. 

I wanted to try the french onion soup and I could add that to my pastrami sandwich. The soup was really good, served with deep rich flavors of the beef broth and onions all covered with melted cheese and under cover, the french baguette bread. Very good soup. 

My pastrami sandwich was served with pickle and fries and had a fair amount of meat. It was served on fresh bread and was a decent size, my husband had ordered the seared tuna sandwich and we decided to trade off, he took half mine and I took half his. I do have to admit, my pastrami was better. The tuna was lightly seared and seemed fresh, but I like my tuna sashimi style without any bread!

Our server was so sweet and friendly and paid us just the right amount of attention during our meal.  Then there's their pudding -oh my goodness their pudding!  I'd have to say it's the second yummiest thing I've ever eaten, only behind the salty caramel macaron ice cream sandwich from Ginger Elizabeth in Sacramento.  I shared the pudding with someone on this particular visit but not next time! :p  If you are a caramel lover like I am get that dessert for sure!  For my entree I ordered their mac and cheese which you can't go wrong with.  I love that they now have a smaller less expensive portion of the mac and cheese which I still found to be quite a bit of food!  I've enjoyed drinks and other entrees at a Yard House back home in Northern California and I think it's safe to say that their food is consistently good from one location to the next.

Normally this place gives pretty good service, considering it's in a touristy spot, but Saturday just wasn't their day. When we arrived at 6:30ish we were told that inside seating would be a 20 minute wait for two people, but outdoor seating was open immediately. We opted for outdoor seating since it wasn't too hot. And this would had been fine if it hadn't taken our waiter 15 minutes just to bring us water. Once we finally ordered, the wait staff seemed to not be communicating with the hostess. First, we kept getting all the food that the table to the left of us was ordering. Then, the table to the right of us was getting our food. It was super frustrating because the table kept accepting our food, and I had to tell the waiter it wasn't theirs - which was awkward. After we finally got our correct food, our service was slow and subpar. I went inside to use the bathroom and there was a hoard of waiters just standing around talking, and I had to say excuse me multiple times to get by. I was really upset and sweaty since our water kept going unfilled and we were seated outside. The people behind us got their water, but we did not. At one point I'm pretty sure we could have walked out without paying because we got no attention from our waiter. I'll be visiting a different location from now on, until this one gets better.",yTV3KHOm4-RQpClyYKGnkw,1,2,2,tD_nZnVS2f-2ftWbPrRAkA

 Beers are always on point with a great selection although they could put some more thought into them and use some local Vegas breweries versus the mainstream and it would add more local flair to the place.

 Food is always decent but never great at least you know what you're getting when you go here. I had ordered truffle fries (no truffle oil flavor rather tasted like old dirty fryer oil) and a chicken and avocado sandwich (menu nor the waitress lacked to inform me that it was a bland purée of avocado. I would have preferred just sliced if avocado and called it a day) which lacked any integrity in making such a simple sandwich.

Needless to say I don't goto YH to be wowed by the food but at least try a little bit harder to have a decent pallet.

The perimeter of the center bar was roped off like it still is now and we would stand in this roped off area crammed butt to nut, with the entire area around the bar lined with people three deep not able to move or hear any conversation while everyone still tried to act cool.

Nowadays, I just go with my family for maybe a beer or two and for dinner. We came on our most recent visit on Saturday night with about a five minute wait. We sat inside at a booth with a ten top table next to us and an overall very noisy restaurant. Quarters are much tighter in this location compared to others.

We were served by Victor who did a fine job despite being busy, but also taking time to make my daughter and her friend laugh along with bringing the entire table water without request. We started off with the shrimp ceviche and nachos. The nachos were a nice portion and loaded with plenty of chicken, beans, cheese. I wasn't that pleased with the ceviche as the mango papaya salsa was too sweet and overpowered the dish hiding the traditional tart flavor of a ceviche.

For entrees, I ordered two tacos, fish and pork belly, which I preferred the pork belly. And also ordered were a chicken Cobb salad and mini creme brulee for dessert. The Cobb salad was nice sized portion with plenty of ingredients and big enough for my daughter and her friend to split. The bananas topping the custard on the creme brulee were also hit by the torch giving them a bit of candied texture also.

The menu is large at Yard House with some items done well, but nothing exceptional. This location isn't as family friendly as other locations due to the louder environment and with a clientele that favors groups that are there hopping between other bars in Town Square.

Debbie the manager on duty came over to check on me, which at first I thought was a wonderful touch. At which point she stated to me that the dish was grilled then kept cold and MICROWAVED when ordered and served.

After thinking it over for about a week, we decided to go to the Yard House at Town Center.  Now, I have been to a couple of Yard Houses in So. Cal. and I liked the idea.  So, I called and made a reservation for the 10 of us.  Here is my experience:

Like I stated before, I called to make a reservation.  And, I talked to Bo, one of the managers.  He was extremely helpful as I told him my needs.  Which were, a table to fit all of us and a T.V. to watch the game.  He hooked us up and explained up front that there was to be an 18% automatic gratuity added to our bill.  Which is policy for groups over 7.  We were fine with that as I'm sure we tipped out more.

Our waiter and waitress were awesome.. they were friendly, attentive and speedy.  I should have gotten their names but, I forgot.  They truly made the night.  

I saw food and drinks come out and everything looked good.  I don't think that anyone had any problems.  I can only comment on the Pizza and beer that I ordered.  I was really happy with my order.  I can't complain at all.

So, I give Yard House 5 stars because we all had a great night with great service, great drinks, great food and even better company.

Came here for dinner with somebody who was in town and the music was just pumping. It was super loud.  It was fairly early in the evening, around 5pm, when we arrived and there were a lot of people in the restaurant, mostly families and people just trying to have a conversation over dinner. I asked the waitress if there's any possibility of turning the music down slightly as it was almost impossible to have a conversation in the restaurant and she indicated that they would not do that. That was their music level and that's where it was going to stay. She wasn't rude about it, but certainly as you looked around the restaurant most people were having the exact same problem. I understand if it was a later crowd and maybe more of a bar crowd but this was absolutely families and people having dinner.  

The second issue was the service. Food came out at a relatively reasonable pace however they forgot my French fries to go with my sliders, another member of our party ordered chicken fingers and they were way, way over cooked. They really didn't seem to care whether they were overcooked or not and nobody really ever came back to check on us. So my two star review is because it wasn't exactly consumer-friendly, service wasn't great, and anybody could have, should have, noticed that the food wasn't prepared properly. French fries are pretty standard item on some of these menu items and over cooking something as simple as chicken fingers....

We put in our order but when the spinach dip appetizer came out the chips provided looked burnt and definitely tasted so, so we had to wait for our server to stop talking to coworkers in the kitchen (we had a clear view from our booth) to gesture her over and ask for a new batch that weren't nearly black. (Again, gave her slack on this because she didn't run the food to see the chips before they landed on the table) but then she must have forgotten our request because we didn't get the chips until our actual meal came out. And they were plain tortilla chips, not the same ones we originally received. She again sat in the kitchen talking to other servers, probably annoyed she had to take more tables since it was fairly slow (as a food server I am fairly positive she only had one table as we were seated that had paid before our meal came, and one other table of three men ordered a beer each as we ate our food). Only making note of that to say there's no way she was just very busy. I get bad days but this girl hates her job and just wanted to get out and made it very apparent that she couldn't do that until we got out of her table. For very ""meh"" food that wasn't great or terrible, the server is the deciding factor to make or break the experience and Veronica made it a definite bust.

We had a guest in town with a gluten allergy and found that they advertise a GF menu. Excited to find some place to take our guests, the menu and excitement quickly faded. Their GF menu lists a burger (and sandwiches), but it wasn't really a burger. It was just the patty with a side of lettuce, tomatoes, onion and pickle. That's not a burger, then fries were not an option (oil is used to cook battered onion rings, chicken, etc). So burger and fries, became a patty and salad. Why bother with a special GF menu? You can order the same way off the regular menu, by skipping the fries and say no bun. Other non-GF plates ordered were pretty basic. Wouldn't go out of my way to go back here, especially if our food allergy guest comes back. If you have a gluten allergy, skip this place and go to the Chesesecake Factory in Henderson and get a real burger with the bun and fries...all GF.",kFFbseYgzd_1iGVoTw7hPg,1,0,3,v7ChDabtd6trCfsZ_6a23w
5565502,2018-04-16,0,A5Rkh7UymKm0_Rxm9K2PJw,"Finally reviewing my favorite chain restaurant! Read below for reasons why it's my favorite..

The service is always near perfect. The hostesses are super friendly and always smiling. The waiters and waitresses are prompt with orders, refill your liquid very regularly, and when sitting at the bar, the drinks are poured strong and fast. The bartenders are even great at fake laughing to my horrible puns and observations.. 

The atmosphere is amazing here. They have huge, comfortable booths, outdoor seating with heaters/mist-ers, and normal bar/table seating. Plus people watching is great if you're single. So many hot/pretty girls and good looking dudes to look at and flirt with (well, for me, the girls). Haha. It's a very hip, modern, FUN place whether you're 21 or 51. Not recommended for he families with kids, though..

The food is the reason I keep coming back. The Ahi Tuna nachos, cheese curds, Tuna Poki Stack, Beranaise burger sliders, salads, soup, and basically everything here is awesome tasting. My only gripe is they switched their awesome shoe-string fries to average, unoriginal typical fries. 

Pro tip: Get the Coconut battered deep fried cheese curds. Holy crap, they're great!",LKe5xYLVQ08rhBRIww-YZQ,0,0,5,6aNU9EOQZ4No3h1OFemBpQ

We arrived and the host said to follow her to the table. A few minutes later, she finally decided to walk towards it after she was done chatting about things that were absolutely not work related.

Once at our table, our magnificently pathetic server didn't even bring the 4 of us waters for a solid and literal 25 minutes. I did however get my beer in the meantime. 

We ordered food, and while we were all eating and drinking, the waters still never got refilled but once over a 4.5 hour time span. The waiter went out of his way to avoid our table because I think he acted as if we were way to demanding. I know that getting drink refills and taking food orders is a tough gig, but that's your job.

We asked for our bill to be split between the 2 couples, and ours came out about half correct when he brought it out the first time. Then 5 of my buddies friends walked in the door and stood around to say hi because they'd not seen each other for years. When our waiter came back, I asked him to correct the bill and supplied my card to be charged the correct amount while my friend paid him cash for his portion. When it came back being delivered by another waiter, I'd been charged an 18% gratuity for a tab from a party of 9 (because of the standing friends), and my buddy didn't get anything back!

The waiter had left because the place was closing, that's what he charged, and I was basically told that they didn't have time to remove the gratutiy and that they could charge it even if there was not a group over 8 people, and my friend was out $14 in his change because the guy just kept it.

I'll never go back here again. They were terrible service, and terrible people. If you just did your job correctly in the first place, you wouldn't have to go out of your way to steel your tips from people.",owzPNL0Uw7LnhL3sYTYm_g,0,0,1,Yy5BHekJ6rtX8Di29w7hbg

We went here during their happy hour, 3-6 pm Monday-Friday. Appetizers were 1/2 off, as well as beer/martinis. I tried the Pomegranate Martini, which was excellent! I love pom juice, and this drink didn't make my face squint. I couldn't even taste the alcohol! By the end of the night, I had my Asian glow face after a few sips from my glass. GEEZ! It was that good!

For appetizers, my friends and I had an array of different foods: blue crab cakes, ham and pineapple pizza, firecracker wings, buffalo wings, chicken lettuce wrap, garlic noodles, sliders, and spicy tuna roll. All of the appetizers were pretty good.

I was also able to try their Raspberry beer, Lindemans Framboise. It was mighty tasty, and again tasted like juice. I also found out you can make floats out of the draft beers. Maybe the chocolate stout with vanilla ice cream? YUM!

I definitely would come back here and bring another group of friends.

I tried almost everything on the menu and can't go wrong with the Chilean Sea Bass.  The bad boy is one of the priciest items on the menu though.  There is also great appetizers from poke to street tacos...good for complimenting your choice of beer.  

The Yard House in the Town Square is always bustling and nearly impossible to get a table without some sort of wait.  The happy hour menu is pretty good as well.  I usually just take up the standing room along the bar.  

The countless screens should cover all your sports needs, and if not, the helpful staff should be able to flip the channel to your desire.  

Still, the main reason I come here is for the beers.  My favorites include Delirium Tremens, Chimay Cinq Cents, Trois Pistoles, Gulden Draak and a special offering of Firestone Sucaba (limited offer).

I have visited the other location at Red Rock and noticed that they seem to be less packed.  Either way, they are perfect for pre-funking, dinner, or whenever you get thirsty.

My review is completely based on this location only. I come to this Yard House a bit too often during their happy hour. I love it because of their late night happy hour. After a long day of school and work, I'm usually done way after the normal happy hour ends. Fortunately, Yard House caters to the night owls out there and starts at 10pm on Sunday-Thursday. 
Now, I'm sure none of this is new to anyone, every Yard House in the nation offers late night. 

Here's why I love this location:
The bartenders here are the best in town. I have come to love the 6 main guys that work the later shift. I usually have one of them pick out my beers for me, and he's always spot on as far as my cravings go. The bars on the strip could really learn a bit about service from these guys.

I've been here before for dinner and this place is pricey. Happy Hour is definitely the way to go if you wanna try this place out. While I won't go over what I've had here before in detail, I will say that many of the entrées are quite bland.

Justin and I ordered a pepperoni and mushroom pizza, garlic noodles and chicken nachos. It was a HUGE amount of food and came out to $18. 

Pizza - according to Justin, ""I feel like pizza is pizza. It's hard to get bad pizza anywhere."" 

Noodles - terrible. Would not get again. I asked them to not put tofu in the noodles, but didn't notice that the noodles were covered in edamame. These were not only covered in toxic legumes,  they were bland and had no garlic taste whatsoever. Skip for time and all eternity. 

Nachos - good. Too many beans. Would definitely order sans beans (uggggh) and would have been better with hot sauce.

Place is very loud and very busy. At 10:30 PM, there was a line to get in to be seated. That either speaks to how good this place is or how few options are in Vegas on a late Wednesday night for food.

He's been like that several times now, even when my outgoing husband has tried to engage him in a convo, it's just not happening. That dude either hates life, people, his job, or all three. Not a fun way to start the night.

So we ended up there Thursday night just because I wanted the Dunkelweizen. Waitress says they don't have it, they're phasing it out, says she'll bring me a tester of a similiar one. Ok. 

Comes back with another dude who says they're not phasing it out, he thinks they're just out but maybe they have an untapped keg in back. He'll go check. Next thing I know a different guy drops off a pint of some other beer. I take a few sips and it's fine, but not the dunkel and I am confused why it was given to me. 

I figure I'll ask the waitress and in the meantime our apps are dropped off by yet another guy. Truffle fries tasted fine, but were cold. Hummus was weird. Couldn't figure out if it was old, over-seasoned, or had been dropped in a dirt pile and scooped back into the bowl. Kept finding weird super dark patches, so that's a no.

All this time while we're sort of eating,  I am taking sips of the beer because 1. I'm thirsty and have nothing else to drink and 2. Our waitress has pulled the famous Yard House dissappearing act. She finally shows up and I ask her why I have this beer ""Oh, that's the one I was telling you about that tastes like the dunkel"" I said, I thought you were bringing me a tester? Blank stare from her...I say, I wouldn't have ordered this one...She says ""well, I can take it away?"" I said I've already had half of it while waiting for you to come back...more awkward silence and finally she says I can charge you for a shorty? I say sure, fine and she leaves

Keep in mind we never ordered dinner, and when she was at the table our fries were gone, we are not eating the hummus and she proceeds to dissappear for TWENTY minutes. We sat there, not eating, I'm not drinking (husband was drinking soda which was getting replaced by a busser, I think) and we are desperately staring down every server in the place trying to telepathically beg for the check. That is when I added my not so favorable check in because I was pissed. We finally spot our waitress and practically yell out for the check and she seems genuinely surprised (REALLY?!?!) so I guess she was super clueless about us not having an enjoyable time. 

Luckily we had cash, so we could bail without waiting another 20 minutes for a credit transaction, and have vowed to never ever ever go to Yard House again.",YJNVwDdzwjwhptzh9y2vBg,2,0,1,Fl3jRJzG5UsfRvy0Ln0gCQ

We were told it would be 15-20 minutes for a table in the very packed restaurant, no problem, we will enjoy the padded seats for a bit. By the time we sat down and got comfortable, our pager went off, and to the table we ventured.

Weaving through groves of people, we arrived at a table toward the back of the restaurant, furthest from the kitchen. I think the host was trying to talk to us during the trip, however, it is so ungodly loud in there, that I couldn't hear a word he was saying.

Flipping through the menu, neither of us remembered it being that expensive and of course, our lack of decision making skills due to hunger kicked in again and nothing looked good.

I, for the second time in the night, settled and chose the four cheese pizza. One type of food that I had expressly stated I did not want prior to arriving. Oh well, can't win them all.

It seemed to take forever for our server to bring two glasses of water, almost as if they made her go to Lake Mead, fill a jug with water, bring it to a purification center, then make some ice cubes and finally, deliver filled ice water glasses to our table.

Our orders were taken and again, it seemed like an eternity for the food to get delivered. It was an OK pizza, about what you would expect from a non-pizza-centric establishment. I did find it odd though, that the crust was soaked with grease or water or something, and was as flimsy as a wet noodle.

Finishing the food, the service seemed to pick up, plates were cleared almost the instant they were clean, the check was dropped off, a moment later, was picked up, with our payment. Then... the waiting began again. I think Yard House makes the staff bring the credit cards to the issuing bank to extract their funds.

Once we were able to reclaim our card and head to the exit, the wife was almost bowled over by an employee that was on a mission. Escaping into the very windy night, we both agreed this was our last visit to Yard House for the foreseeable future.",ajx1YQYaSiF_tBFaaP7XKA,0,0,3,TlC_F4BKZQIx66Zaut-3HA
5675453,2012-06-14,0,A5Rkh7UymKm0_Rxm9K2PJw,"Strike 2 against Yard House.

My last review wasn't exactly positive, which is to be expected when you get moldy bread on your sandwich and don't notice (due to your hunger) until after devouring HALF of the thing. Yuck.  After that experience I received an e-mail from the manager apologizing and offering a free dinner.  I never responded and hadn't been back since.  I don't want free things, I just want your kitchen to send out non-moldy bread!

Anyhow, my Mom and I were in the area and decided to stop in on a Sunday night for dinner.  It was pretty crowded, but we were sat immediately and approached by a friendly server, who took our drinks/appetizer order.  I have to add....if you know anything about beer, the list is nothing but long.  There is really nothing exciting about it.  Anyhow, our beers came out quickly and our server took our order.  I figured our app should be out any minute, but instead we sat there waiting and waiting and waiting....until BOOM! Our entrees came out.  We told the food runner that we never received our app, and he said he would be happy to take our food back and have our app sent out, or he could just make sure we aren't charged for it and leave our dinner.  Uh, no....we are hungry and ordered an app, we want it.  So he takes our food back and I start worrying that I am going to either end up with moldy bread again, or our entrees were going to sit under a heat lamp until we were ready for them.....I saw our server talking with a Manager, who then came over to our table to apologize for the error and that our crab/lobster/artichoke dip would be out momentarily and that she would ensure our meals were made fresh. (Also that the app would be no charge) Once we received it, the dip was really good and it disappeared quickly.  Our entrees were fresh when we received them, and I did not have moldy bread. (WHEW!) Our server also apologized and said that it was his error, which I know isn't easy.  Now, all of this may not seem like that big of a deal, but after my previous experience and having not returned to the restaurant in over a year after the moldy bread, it is just really disappointing.  I used to go to Yard House almost every Sunday with a big group of friends, and we loved the food and service.  Now it seems like both have gone downhill and I am not sure if I will find another reason to go back.  It was very generous of the manager to comp our app, but I am not looking for free food.  I just want my order to come out correctly, in a timely manner, and without mold. Is that too much to ask?  Apparently so.  Unfortunately, I think that Yard House has gotten lost in the shuffle of getting tourists in and out as quickly as possible....

Just an FYI....I was a server in college and I understand that mistakes happen.  Our server still received 20% tip after this debacle, as I only thought it was fair to tip based off what the check would have been, if the appetizer would've been charged.",rKkpHJkJ27xOwnhy_bMkvA,0,0,3,WaNOBrdNZ7LnxGbIce0Edw

Beer menu: huge and somewhat confusing, browsing it can take some time and apparently that is not to the liking of the wait stuff, but more on that later.

Beer: while the micros are good the prices and quantity are not worth the entry price (imo) paying almost $9 for what looks like 7 ounces of Belgian pirate ale is a bit rich for my blood, further more those tall ""yard house"" glasses while they look cool are completely impracticable, drinking out of them is painful and  uncomfortable, wish there was an option of a traditional stein instead.

Sure, you can go to the neighborhood bar and find $1 beers on tap at odd hours...but the quality offered by Yard House is seldom seen in combination with their prices. Expect to pay $4-5 for a delicious imported beer, $4 wells, or $5-6 for one of their signature martinis and cocktails. 

On top of that, their food is delicious. And by delicious, I mean I've never eaten anything there that wasn't. Generously portioned half priced appetizers will undoubtedly keep you satiated to the tune of $6-7, or you can enjoy their sliders or pizza selection for similar pricing. 

I rang in my 21st birthday here in 2009, and my friends had a blast exposing me to all sorts of fun delicious drinks - I can give Yard House some credit for the eclectic taste in spirits I have now. Take me seriously when I say, they have beer for EVERYONE. If you hate beer, THEY HAVE BEER FOR YOU. If you love beer, they have 250 of them! If you think beer is tolerable but haven't found one you love yet, get in your car *right now* and go to Yard House. I'm serious. My personal favorites are Goose Island Matilda, a Belgian style pale ale that tastes a little bit fruity with a lot of kick, and Stone Ruination IPA. They always card - ALWAYS - which I also enjoy ;)

The reason they lose a star isn't even really their fault, but it does deserve to be said - cell phone service is RARE. I've received many angry text messages and voicemails after being unreachable for the few hours I spent enjoying my Goose Island Matilda and Ahi Poke Stack. No bueno.

 Staff was friendly and even though the place was packed I got seated right away. 

 They have these 32 oz beers (maybe 24 oz) that come in these super tall 3 foot glasses. There a pain in the ass to actually drink out of but there the most beer bang for your buck I believe.

Being that it's a huge establishment, wondered how the service would be... right off, the hostess was friendly, helpful and attentive which channeled all the way to the waitresses as well. For being quite crowded, service was quite outstanding.

The meal - Order the NY Steak and fries... yes, I am predictable! For not being an actual steakhouse, the steak was quite flavorful and tasty, more importantly cooked to order. Not bad at all. Patricia order the Malibu chicken and that looked great as well. Great in a sense when you see someone elses plate, one remarks 'man, I should've ordered that!' LOL

For appetizers... recommend the Chicken Nachos.... ah there very good.

Some of my personal favorites include their clam chowder, the seared ahi and the sliders. Granted, I do my best to vary it up as much as possible because their menu is so vast.

It's seriously an alcoholic juice...very dangerous!  

As for food, I think our eyes were hungrier than our stomachs!  We ordered the Truffle Fries (shredded parmesan and herbs) with a hint of garlic.  It was delish!  Then we ordered the Ahi Poke Bowl with some fried wontons that were also quite tasty.  Then we ordered Pastrami sliders which did not meet my standards.

My friends and I can't get enough of Yard House's happy hour. They serve delicious food and for a great price! Their servings are pretty big! I always go to happy hour with a group of friends and we all end up sharing everything at the table. 

Buffalo chicken wings- Yummy, tasty, and has a little kick! Served with celery sticks and ranch.
Chicken lettuce wraps- Healthy and crunchy. They give you about 5 or 6 lettuce cups and three different sauces. So the flavor choice is all up to you!
California roll- Don't be fooled by it being just ""one"" California roll, but it's HUGE. It's a jumbo California roll!
Calamari- Crispy and cooked perfectly! Squeeze some lemons and dip it in the spicy tomato sauce and it is TO DIE FOR.
Spinach dip- Delicious!! Comes with chips. And it's A LOT.
Classic sliders- Comes with 4 mini sliders. They give you mustard and ketchup bottles. It comes with a pickle slice and fries. The fries are skinny, crispy, and leave you wanting more!
Ahi poke- Though it could be a little bigger of a portion, it's really tasty.
Onion tower- They stack a huge tower of onions, fresh to eat!

So if you are planning a get together, call ahead and make a reservation. Even then, there might still be some additional wait time for the tables to be cleaned up and reset for your party.

The biggest draw for hitting up Yard House is probably their beer selection.  Because the food is just alright overall with highlights here and there that I have discovered. For arranging parties when you don't know where else to go, Yard House is a safe bet.  Everyone in Vegas that goes out even occasionally will know about it.

Love watching sports and paling around with friends or near by strangers?  This is a good spot, if you are willing to wait for an open table or vacant chair at the bar.  There are plenty of flat screens to occupy your attention.

Looking for a quiet intimate and relaxing place to chill and grab a bite?  The noise alone will get this place crossed off the list.  But you are also not going to be spending the kind of money you would expect to pay at a restaurant with nice tablecloth and illuminated by real candle lights.

The service is okay to way above average.  What I do love about coming here with a large party is that the waitstaff has been trained to keep track of who ordered what, so splitting the bill at the end of the night is as painless and effortless on the customer's part as it is going to get.  Uber kudos for that alone!

This place is located in Town square which is a huge maze.  I have no idea how to navigate around this area, so be prepared for that.  Anyways, we walked in to a lively wonderful atmosphere of people enjoying themselves and just a fun vibe.

We were seated and were amazed by the beer selection.  This place is like an ale house where they must have like 100 beers on tap.  It was awesome.  The first time we came here we sat in a booth with a really nice waitress.  She was quick, interactive, and knowledgable.  I started off with a beer. The first beer I got was 9 dollars and the second beer i got was 6, so I assume that the prices of the beer vary.

We tried the asian thai pizza  - which was amazing.  I think asian thai salads and all of those asian dishes taste the same.  The pizza was amazing and extremely flavorful.  It was like 16 dollars or something.

Then we ordered the Bisque and grilled cheese. It was ok.  Average.  Not the best gr cheese and not the best bisque. 12 bucks or so. (The menu w pricing is easily accessible online)

I ordered the Turkey club which was moist juicy and saucy, which i love.  Bottom line - food is amazing here.  

One final thing of note - My girlfriend is a vegetarian and they have a GARDEIN menu.  This has changed my life forever.  It is a soy protein that tastes JUST LIKE CHICKEN.  I now know gardein exists and its amazing.  Thank you Yard House

The service was good even if the waitress was a little bit too fake, but everyone in Vegas is working on tips so I can't blame her. She did let my beer go empty one time though!  Shame on her.
