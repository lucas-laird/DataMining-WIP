The next time I needed a beer, she was at the other end of the bar messing around on her phone.

169461,2016-06-22,0,x1fx7C_tc064cFATjl4fmQ,"I ate here twice on my trip to Las Vegas last weekend and enjoyed my meal both times. My uncle is a local and he goes here a lot. It was a very casual environment with lots of wood furniture and a few TV's (I'm not a fan of TV's in a dining area, but my uncle appreciated it so he could catch the end of a game he was into.) The service was excellent. Of course, they knew my uncle was a regular so that probably factored in, but none the less, our server was lovey both times and she appeared to be just as friendly to other people eating there. 

The food was really good. I had the pastrami reuben the first time I  ate there, and the french dip on my second visit. Both were excellent. The pastrami didn't have too much tough connective tissue that some pastrami can have (like subway's for example...yuk). It was very meaty and flavorful. The bread was fresh and I had my sandwich with a side of fruit (it was mixed fresh cantaloupe and canned tropical fruit). 

The reuben was also very tasty and a good size. We split a piece of fresh carrot cake and the frosting was amazing! I make Alton Brown's carrot cake from scratch, which is very good, but this frosting even rivaled that recipe! 

I went back to buy a gift certificate for my uncle as a thank you for letting me crash at his place and the bar tender informed me that they had to call the owner? manager? to come in to get  it because the staff were ""not authorized to sign for it"". That was a little inconvenient, but it wasn't a terribly long wait and the bar tender was super friendly. She offered me a cold soda/water while I waited and checked on me a couple times. 

Overall, I thought the food was delicious and the people there were very nice. I recommend The Lodge if you are looking for a tasty, not too pricey bite to eat in a casual setting.",zQPzOZlCrPKKbAI-kGEnzw,2,1,4,6ttNe8zPB6nPeSKzfrb65A

They talk about other coworkers instead of tending to guests. Food is decent. I wish they would take care of the problem people that come in faster as well.

As this was a cut rate steak I kept my complaint between my wife and I, but then when I attempted to take a bite of baked potato (obviously microwaved and not baked) it was as hard as the fork.  When the server came over I tapped my fork against the potato and commented it was barely cooked.  She asked if I wanted another one (really?) and I said yes.  The next micro potato arrived after everything else had been eaten.  One would think the kitchen staff who cut the potato in half would not have served it, but alas they clearly do not care.

2646038,2016-01-19,4,x1fx7C_tc064cFATjl4fmQ,"Decent place to watch football games.  They have plenty of big screens and even arm chairs and a seating area to feel like you are at a friends house. I did not understand why they were blasting music during playoff football but maybe I walked in during halftime and they quickly shut off the music when I asked.  The bar has plenty of gaming machines but what I liked is they had a part of the bar with no gaming.  I hate when a place kicks you off a seat at the bar because you are not playing and want to save it for that ONE LOSER that thinks he is gonna hit it big.  

During football games they have some food specials that are not on the menu.  Price points and servings vary depending on how many people you have in your group but they start at $8 and up.  I went for the Beef Sliders and Tater Tot Nachos.  The sliders were filling and a decent snacking size.  The bun was fresh and of good quality.  I thought the Tater Tot dish was an amazing idea and it was surprisingly good in my opinion.  Great little bar food dish.  

Draft beer choices were not great and seemed to be favored towards the Anheuser Busch family of beers. I had a Sierra Nevada and to be honest it did not taste that great, maybe they needed a line flush or its not a beer served often.  

Service was OK and no real issues.  Friendliness and a willingness to be outgoing can go a long way on a bartenders pocket book.  I did not see either of these attributes being displayed during my visit.  However I can be an Asshole at times.",8fsZcLADFrPTbGrFqMACpg,4,3,3,LUNejpNUzTwRsHGqsgJkhw

I got the buffalo chicken wrap - great wrap if it didn't have onions in it and had bleu cheese dressing inside. Fries had a great taste!

Boyfriend got the cheeseburger - he said the bun was overcooked.. the burger had zero flavor, could have used seasoning on it.. The cheese looked like it was shredded cheese from a bag, a mixture of colby and jack cheese even though he asked for a slice of cheddar cheese.....

Ok no big deal mistakes happen. But it was brought back with runny eggs and while chewing I felt a sharp pain in my mouth.. Yep a METAL SHARD!!! Presumably from the fryer.

The bartender sucked and waved at me when i tryes to call her over, anyways this spot seemed nice but as far as service went to get a drink it was a loss. If you are a gamer god ahead waste your money and get crap service! Food was meh... Im a firm believer in the relativity in looking for service and looking for yer tip!

I did not eat, but my family did and I saw the food and their reaction to it. Everyone seemed to like the food well enough and the prices were fair. I would not go out of my way to eat here, but if you do, you will probably leave relatively satisfied.",miYjr7cJ-e0Yjgnr1rYPOg,0,0,3,-zriQK8VlLodukqBEL9QNQ
