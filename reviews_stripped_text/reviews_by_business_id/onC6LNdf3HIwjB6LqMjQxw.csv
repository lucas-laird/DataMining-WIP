1357572,2018-06-07,0,onC6LNdf3HIwjB6LqMjQxw,"This is going to be a short review because I don't have much to say about what I ordered and service I received.  I decided to do something different and ordered the spicy chicken jack, regular fries, and a sprite.  

The chicken was somewhat thin and not as spicy as I would have liked it.  But the sandwich was perfectly made and not too shabby either.  I probably will get it again but I need to stop comparing it to Chick Fil A spicy chicken sandwich and it's probably even better than what I am describing.  And I got some of the freshest hottest fries from there and boy I was a happy camper.",KEerqlFNhzl1I-yVK6mHVA,0,0,3,0RztxLTPBh7aYdCA3Z1Ffw

Food was as expected for Jack.

Here is the thing that bothers me.  Eating the sourdough jack that is not cheap, I bite into a hard piece.  I can't chew it and I look at it to see this nasty green tomato.  I took it off my burger.  The tomato is the thing that ties all the ingredients together on this burger.  

This really annoys me because the employee who made this clearly sees the nasty green and continues to give it to me just to give the dog her food and get her gone. Very offensive!",SJuSiO27FTKi5qKrNDa8Lg,0,1,2,UQYP3JuqtPU6_02BUUdTDw

The desserts are tasty and they let you add stuff to your order at the menu without frowning. And if SOMEONE steals your cherry on your Strawberry SHAKE they will give you another one LOL.",A2N4y0VeZ-3TtmBVCSVVnQ,0,1,4,WATK-z668nNm-TqWLZJIHg

I've lived over 10 years in the east side and I've never had a problem at this location. It is well managed and the drive thru is always fast and accurate,r3gC6cLnQ28g38pbsYy34Q,0,0,5,u_8S9kBLrHVBFJDML_eEuA

I give it 3 stars for good service and food.",1AYTQ-XpQwvbbShaXorsQA,2,3,3,J_6c_LjeP5MHzumpWv40Ug
