We ordered two of the Feast thingy's (All American Feast, I think it's called)...They serve them on a garbage can lid. Comes with ribs, chicken, and brisket or pulled pork, with 2 big sides and cornbread muffins.  Oh, and the fries, that are scattered all over the lid. My god, ALL of the food was good.  The ribs, were delicious fall off the bone, variety, the pulled pork was amazing (I had the pulled pork sandwich for lunch one time as well).  I love the different kinds of bbq sauce.  Their desserts are actually pretty friggin' good as well.  Their bread pudding is diabetic shock, but it's absolutely delicious.  The prices, really aren't that bad, either.  It's about $60 for one of the Feasts, and it really does serve about 5 people.   I've been here 3 times now, and will definitely come back again.",ubOe7kfaEnikCGvh1R2oBQ,0,0,4,iUPV3OBWr6NX4tfyaViBgA

So I decided to try it. Sure enough the mashed potatoes had a peculiar after taste and the Sprite did have taste like how dish water smells. My son said his burger was burnt. Took a look and the edges were burnt. Our food came out lukewarm. I get hotter food at my job's cafeteria. The corn was tasteless, like eating water. They need to change the distributor where the get corn from. Vons have great sweet corn on the cob, LOL!!! Im sick to my stomach to have spent the money I did on a HORRIBLE dinner for 4.

I arrived just in time this afternoon to grab their Early Bird dinner special and got a combo with the St. Louis ribs, traditional wings with Pineapple Rage sauce, and a side of Wilbur beans. I've been here quite a few times but this was the first time I tried their award winning ribs (I love pulled pork waaaay to much). The ribs were almost fall off the bone tender and not dried out. I did need to add a bit more of the Sweet and Zesty sauce though.

The wings were another new try for me, and while the wings themselves were alright, the Pineapple Rage was all pineapple and no rage. I needed to slather it in Devil's Spit sauce to up the heat a bit.

Wilbur beans are my usual side. The meat chunks are a nice touch but I worry about the sugar content because they're usually so sweet.

As far as chains go, Dave's is alright. I'll keep going I suppose until I find a more ""local"" bbq place.",kYAZadWY7QXGtzo648VUOA,1,2,3,Ie0lC8wy0wfQk7Rw-ckRgw

Cons: catfish entree came out cold. Was expecting a filet, got strips instead. I didn't know ""mac & cheese soup"" existed. Garlic mash I swear was instant with some skins mixed in.  Did not taste fresh at all. None of it. 

Sat in the bar. Some guy fell out of his chair. No, really...the entire chair & person fell over. Did anyone employed here come to his aid? Not one. They just stood there gawking. This patron was sober.  

Tables & menus: DISGUSTING!!  Everything was sticky. They could at least wipe the bbq sauce off the menu instead of letting it dry. 

As for the decor....when was the last time this place was cleaned?  Dust on all the knick knacks...it was gross.

St. Louis Style Spareribs: Disappointing. Very tough and difficult to bite off the bone. The only thing saving them was the nice glaze of viscous basted sauce on them.

Beef Brisket: Average. I've had worse (i.e. tough) and I've had better (tender and juicy). These were tender, just kind of bland. I slathered them in the Texas Pit sauce (their medium sauce with peppercorns) to get more of the smoke flavor that should already be inherent in the brisket itself, and was able to down them.

Chopped Pork: Best of the three meats we tried. Tender and pulled apart easily. Tried it w/ the Georgia mustard sauce. A little bit too much vinegar for my taste, but nice runny consistency. 

Sides: Recommend the cornbread and the corn on the cob. Potato salad was a bit hard (wished they had boiled the potatoes for more than two minutes), and fries just your average steak fries.",rOKA12tpTVq14NYYq9ss1A,3,1,2,8O431Z2VKEGri4HMc11vOw

Been here quite a few times and have always had great service/food. The bar was totally empty when our party of 4 sat down and Matt, the bartender took his sweet time getting our initial drink order. Food arrived and was tasty as usual, but even if something had been wrong, Matt never even really checked back to see how things were. We had a bday coupon that was visible on the table and he ran hubby's credit card without even acknowledging the coupon. When confronted he had a crappy attitude about it saying ""well, I can fix it but it'll take like two days for it to be credited back, yadda yadda yadda."" Okay, so fix it. That's 16 bucks off of our $85 tab, buddy. And guess what? It ain't going towards your tip. Had to go chase down a manager to take care of it, which took him all of 4 minutes. Being a server myself, I know how easy it is to reverse a transaction... and I also know how to leave the shitty attitude at the door when I show up for work.

I've been here tons of times as it's one of the only authentic southern/soul food/ribs/bbq places in Vegas.

Everything's great about this place from the food, to the friendly staff, to the decor. My suggestions (i.e. what I always end up ordering) are as follows:
DRINK: Sweet Tea
MEAT: Beef Brisket

I've tried their nachos and fried pickles appetizers and they are both great.

DESSERT: Their bread pudding is probably the best in the city

Side note: This is one of few places that offers their own BBQ sauces and they are all on your table and you can pick and choose whatever you like right there!

1126740,2010-07-24,0,KUOa1acSFn6DkO9jp-sn6A,"Trust this review from a past Texas barbeque pit master.  The first thing you should notice about a barbeque restaurant is the intoxicating, salivating-producing aroma of barbecue as you pull into the parking lot.  This sensation is absent from Famous Daves, even when you walk through the doors.

For the following reasons I actually believe this faux barbeque is prepared in ovens.  The ribs and the ""authentic Texas"" brisket did not have a single sumptuous bit of bark on the surface and also did not have a single bit of smoked flavor. The bark on the chopped pork was better but equally tasteless having been produced in an oven.

About the sides:  The corn on the cob was severely overcooked and mushy.  When you pull the paper away from the cornbread muffin half of the muffin comes away with it.  The green beans were almost raw, so they did not take up any of the bacon, garlic, onion and red pepper.  The supposed four cheese macaroni and cheese was mostly Velveeta.  The potato salad was simple and good and the Wilbur beans were tasty.  

With all this in mind I have to question why Yelpers and Best of Las Vegas reviewers rate this mess of a restaurant so high.  Not being a hater, but I suspect that it has to do with the size of their waists.  I swear, I felt I on the deck of the spaceship in Walley when I sat in there.",9BtMinWjbiRslfOq_J7_FQ,0,0,1,shbGE9tUX8h_9EFIrnhofw

I LOVE bbq, so when my bf suggested we go to Famous Dave's for dinner Halloween night, I was game! Because it was Halloween, there was no wait and we were seated right away. We decided on the feast for 2, priced at $39.99 and comes with a LOT of food. Half a rack of spare ribs, half a chicken, and your choice of either pulled pork or brisket, we chose pork, corn on the cob, cornbread muffins, potato wedges and 2 sides, we chose beans and mac and cheese. The food came out within 15 minutes and I was surprised at how much food there was! We happily dug in.

My favorite item I had was the ribs. They were perfectly smoked and tender and the meat was almost falling off the bone. The chicken and pulled pork were tasty as well. The beans had pieces of bacon in them and were delicious. The mac and cheese had corn and jalapenos mixed in, which was different but good. I really like the different bbq sauces they have sitting at the table for you to use with your meal. They have 5 of them from sweet to inferno spicy. My favorite is the Georgia Mustard, its a vinegary sauce and its tangy and delicious on the different meats. We didn't even come close to finishing everything and had plenty to take home for the next day. Our server was awesome, I forgot his name but he was attentive and friendly. I would most definitely recommend this place, and will be back in the future, especially for the feast for 2.",JYcCYNWs8Ul6ewG5kCYW4Q,2,0,4,jV74lFGVbLdWlXW_YndpWA

We ordered the Feast for 2 and my son ordered the macaroni and cheese. 

Macaroni and cheese was just blue box Kraft, which my son actually prefers over any fancier creamier version. Unfortunately there was a chunk of slightly burnt noodles obviously form the bottom of the pan, but the remainder was tasty and kept my kid happy. It came with fries which were nicely seasoned, a drink (good ol' white milk for us), and a two pack of Oreo cookies. Reasonable price for that amount of food.

Feast for 2: 
1) half a slab of St.Louis style ribs - tasty, easy to bite off bone; would have preferred some more sauce.
2) 1/2 a country-roasted chicken - moist and flavorful, similar to rotisserie chicken; next time we would try the BBQ chicken in hopes of having the right sauce. Four different BBQ sauce choices but none were just right. We ended up mixing Sweet and Zesty and Rich and Sassy.
3) Georgia chopped pork - very tasty; would have loved more sauce. It would be really good as a sandwich which I believe they do have.
4) Coleslaw - not that ""creamy"" as they proclaim; a little on the bitter side; could have used a thicker and tangier sauce.
5) Wilbur Beans - interesting tangy and mildly zesty Beans. I actually enjoyed this as I had not tasted this combination of flavors before.
6) Corn on the cob - four half cobs; a little over cooked having that saturated soggy water taste. I will probably cut it off the cob and mix it in with something else.
7) Fries - steak fry wedges delightfully crispy and crunchy; tasted good with a mixture of the BBQ sauces 
8) Corn bread muffins (2) - honestly the best cornbread muffin or cake I have ever had at a BBQ place; just the right amount of corn flavor but moist enough you're not choking on crumbs like I have in the past.

Overall it was a satisfying meal. We ended up taking a lot of it home as it was obviously a lot of food. I gave it three stars for a good meal; nothing mind blowing but nothing strongly disappointing enough to ruin my meal.",G7Ca2lgiFKKpv1v8glT4KQ,0,0,3,lNyzHphmNZQEq3qI3KNERA

Still haven't gotten the all-american bbq feast but I'll continue to try as long as they keep sending me the email.

I've had their hot fudge kahlua brownie talk about a dessert, yummy. Their wings are also really good especially when their dunked in that rich and sassy bbq sauce. Their BBQ ribs and brisket are good.",vWP8-aQX0rYJszqkWVL7Ew,0,1,4,hPNQVW2nBXN42jEiZpbOMg

I made the terrible mistake of choosing Famous Dave's on Blue Diamond.  I was there with 8 family members.  I ordered chicken and brisket.  The server was kind enough to ask if I wanted white meat or dark.  I said I would prefer the white meat. 

Service was a little slow, but that was understandable with a large party on a Friday night.  Our server was very professional and did a good job.  However when my meal arrived, it was brisket and a leg and thigh of the chicken.  I didn't  want to make a fuss, since I was there with a large group.   Then I tried to eat the brisket.  It was the very worst brisket I've ever tried to eat.  It was a blend of pure fat and meat so charred, it could be used as charcoal.

2509112,2011-03-24,0,KUOa1acSFn6DkO9jp-sn6A,"It's never good when you feel like you have to start a review with ""where to begin.""

So...where to begin?

Let's start with the service. If you haven't noticed, service is a big deal to me. I work in a service industry, I appreciate customer service, and I know what it takes to provide good service (most of the time it's just being nice - ya, that's pretty much it). The service at this establishment was very hit and miss. Our waitress, Stacie had moments where she was very attentive and nice and moments where she was quite possibly the most overbearing and annoying server I've ever had. Let's start with the bad. I understand that every server has a unique style that works for them. However, Stacie felt that it was necessary to call my wife and I ""Young man"" and ""Young lady"" every time she stopped at our table. She literally (no exaggeration here) said those phrases at least 25 times while we were eating there. I'm not sure how old she is, but certainly wasn't old enough to use this term. It just came across as obnoxious. I'm not 5, I'm not in trouble, and your not in a senior citizens home, so don't call me young man. Do you need a refill young man? Can I take your order young man? And you young lady? Anything else young man? STOP IT!!!! Stacie then asked us if ""our food was delicious."" Unfortunately it wasn't, and this bothered her. She managed that situation very well and it's obvious that she cares about the product coming out of the kitchen. For that I praise her, I just don't care for an overbearing, loud, obnoxious personality when I'm dining (unless I'm at Dick's Last Resort). 

Now to the food. We tossed around the idea of trying a few different restaurants. I'm sad we didn't pick the others. This was our second experience with Famous Dave's and it was equally, if not more disappointing than the first. I just don't see what others get out of this place. Their bbq sauces at the table might be some of the worst tasting sauces in the history of bbq. I ordered a pulled bbq chicken sandwich with a side of jalapeno mac-n-cheese. My sandwich was okay, the chicken was very dry though. The mac-n-cheese was awful. It tasted like they cooked the mac-n-cheese then just dumped the jalapenos in after everything was cooked. Not good. My wife ordered a grilled chicken sandwich. All I could smell was burned chicken. It came with nothing on it, the meat wasn't seasoned at all, and it was very overcooked. She ordered the slaw with it which she said was very good. The sandwich was boring, overcooked, and the presentation was very undesirable. 

Upon telling the server that the food wasn't ""delicious."" She sent over a manager. We appreciated him stopping by, and we were very honest with him. He did everything right and offered to replace my wifes sandwich. We declined and told him that this was our second experience here and we just weren't satisfied. He gave us various options but we decided to just stick with what we had and agreed that this would be our last experience at Dave's. 

Lucille's at the District is a much better BBQ option that Famous Daves. I'd rather just not eat than have to eat here again.

We were so pumped up to check this place out. I have heard so many great things about Famous Daves from friends and coworkers in the past. Usually we would go do the BBQ at Ellis Island, but we were in the mood to try something different today. 

We walked in and were seated at a booth pretty quickly. We checked out the menus and decided on a couple of dishes and an appetizer. I was also going to take advantage of those happy hour prices for a nice cold adult beverage or three.

We were just waiting for the server to come and take our drink order to kick things off.

The thing is we waited...

...and waited...

...and waited...

...and waited...

To add insult to injury, people who came in after us were seated and served their drinks. AND on top of that, two different employees looked right at us, turned around, and walked away. At the 34 minute mark we decided to throw in the towel. It wasn't even that busy as there were plenty of empty tables and booths everywhere! I went to tell the hostess, in a very calm manner, on the way out the door  that we had been waiting 34 minutes and no one had even taken our drink order. There was no apology, no explanation....no...anything. I just got the deer in the headlights look. Nice. 

Cross this place off my list. I'll just go back to Rolling Smoke or Ellis Island...or anywhere else for that matter when I'm in the mood for BBQ.

Tonight one of the servers at the Blue Diamond location in Las Vegas took it upon himself to completely disrespect me and my wife. The waiter was of African American origins like me. He was constantly flirting with my wife behind my back. I was unaware of this until my wife; Tammy brought it to my attention. He was standing in the background constantly staring and making flirtatious smiles and gestures at my wife. I understand that people flirt but there is a line and he crossed it. This made her extremely uncomfortable. He went so far as to follow her AND my three year old son to the bathroom and made a very disrespectful comment. ""Hey, cutie! And I wasn't talking about the baby!"" That was totally uncalled for. Our night was ruined. As a husband my first thought was to confront him. Instead I kept my cool and am writing this email in hopes that you will address the situation. When we got home my wife called the manager of the Blue Diamond location to address the situation. The entire time she was talking to the manager, Kevin, he was laughing under his voice and completely refused to take this matter seriously. He even stated that he was not sure how to handle this type of situation. Kevin told my wife that the waiter's name is ""Essex."" Given Kevin's demeanor at the time of the conversation we are unsure whether or not that is his real name. My wife even told me that he was the same waiter that kept walking past our table last year staring at her and our 11 year old daughter. 
 As it stands my family and I will never dine at that location again and will suggest to others not do so as well. Essex is clearly there to pick up on women whenever he can and is not there to work. Your manager, Kevin showed is ineptitude when dealing with this situation. Please make no mistake. I am not out to gain anything from this but we are considering seeking legal actions on the grounds of sexual harassment and stalking so no other family should have to endure the same vulgar and disrespectful treatment. We are also going to contact our local news stations and hope they will not make light of this situation and warn the people about that location. I love my family and do not want to see other families put in comprising situations like this. Famous Dave's used to be a place for families to relax and enjoy themselves. Now it is becoming a haven for potential sexual predators. Our waiter, Ryan was great. He should be commended for his excellent service.

The decor is of an outdoor country picnic with string lights on the ceilings and red and white checkered tablecloths. The ribs well excellent! The sauce is so good and the full slab was enough to feed 4. As for the sides, a little underwhelming.

This is a late review but after my blahh experience with POT LIQOUR I really had to get my fix fixed.

So the next day I headed right over to Famous Dave's to make sure I wasn't trippin on how food should taste like.

I ordered a DOZEN CORN MUFFINS - no need any sauce on it but some butter always makes any bread taste even better than it does.

APPETIZER BURNT ENDS - little chopped pieces smothered in bbq sauce and it comes with some fried onions and some spiced pickles which are AWSOME! 

I would have to say I was not tripping about the other place because the burnt ends here were much more edible than the other place. Although it was a little more on the dry side this time but not to the point of jerky - Ness. The cashier that took my order was quick and prompt and went over what was in each box for me. Food was ready and togo within 10 min!",x-8ZMKKNycT3782Kqf9loA,4,4,4,0-ndgnYXjR2Ys0BKsLY1CA

So many choices.  I usually go with a few people and we end up ordering the feast.  We always leave stuffed and enough leftovers for the next days lunch!!  I would call that a good value.

They had a new sauce last time I went, Ghost Chili BBQ sauce.  Very spicy, but oh so delicious!!  This sauce alone warrants a visit. 

The food is consistent, always done well.  Our waiter Dave was on point.  Did a great job refilling drinks and making sure we were doing well.  

In my opinion, whatever you order, you won't be disappointed.  I won't get crazy and say this is the best BBQ I ever had, but always left stuffed, happy, and satisfied.",1JEXL5K6VTx01tAs6Jskkg,1,2,4,tSBtpjgxUOyxxme3Q3fbUA

1) Mix the regular sauce (a bit sweet) with the Devil's spit sauce (a bit liquidy) to get the perfect bbq sauce
2) Get the beans. beans. beans
3) You might as well make your own mashed potatoes
4) Save some room for the delicious corn muffin

This place is located on Blue Diamond Road not too far from highway 15 so it is pretty convenient to get there, and the restaurant does offer quite a lot of parking spaces so it shouldn't be hard to park. The restaurant itself is somewhat large, and doesn't get too busy so no problem to get a table.

We decided to take the ultimate burger and the pulled chicken burger along with a cup of chili, fries and rice, and a brownie. The ultimate burger was very good, while the pulled chicken burger was a little less so. Service was pretty fast and we ended up paying $23 for all this food.

3294141,2010-08-25,0,KUOa1acSFn6DkO9jp-sn6A,"Dave's is what would happen if you were to take a rustic rib shack from the dirty dirty, run it through a Corporate even somewhat Disney like scrub and move it to a blistering desert.  In another words, if you want an authentic, rustic rib shack and you hate the idea of a chain like place, this is not your place.

Fortunately for me, I don't mind the garish touristy-ness of the place.  I just want reasonably priced food and if I'm lucky, beer.

Although their happy hour is advertised as 2-6p, I noted that our 11:30am lunch on a Saturday also qualified.  So if you are hell bent on happy hour, which for $2.99 23 oz beers, that's pretty good, then check ahead.

As noted, by other reviewers, $8.99 two item combos with corn muffin and one side for lunch is a fantastic deal.  However, the overall food is quite average.  Not a bad thing or anything.  I was happy with it, but it wasn't as good as Baby Blue in LA.  The ""Devil's Spit"" sauce was pretty good, but it was not spicy at all.  I couldn't tell the sweet BBQ sauce wings from the spicy.  And seriously, not even cholulu spicy, let alone tapatio.  The sweet sauce was not so good.  I think you can just skip the wings.  The Devil's spit is okay from the bottle for your other meats aside from the lack of spiciness.
 
This place is clean.  You could eat off the floor.  Good job.  The air conditioning is blasting, so you may get a bit cold if you are chugging cold beers and are sensitive to cold.

Service is standard, though a bit spotty when it gets busy.  Instead of having three hostesses, Dave's should add one or two servers during lunch rush.

Overall, 3 platters, 12 wings, 5 beers, 1 side salad plus tax and tip for $62?  Not bad, not bad.  Mind blowing authentic BBQ joint... not so much.  But as long as you aren't a BBQ snob, you'll be fine.  Enjoy.",xgcxhbbnokR-ZBazUrtXnA,1,0,3,Q_R_QQ-XLQng8UPZWCq19w

3304311,2012-06-01,1,KUOa1acSFn6DkO9jp-sn6A,"My first one star review and I stand by it.

Don't get me wrong i LOVE BBQ it probably one of my favorite foods but just not from Famous Daves.

This review actually covers the 2 regrettable times I came in.

I stopped by tocheck out FD with a couple of friends not too long ago. Walking in I thought the place looked horrendous, like a couple hill-billies had designed the place. But I know interior decor really is subjective so I don't really put too much thought on it but in my opinion this place is ugly.

We ordered what I thought would be safe bets, beef brisket, ribs, pulled pork. The usual fare at bbq restaurants. What we got when food arrived could be be described as an insult to the BBQ gods. The brisket was dry, almost complete devoid of flavor other than a smoky/charcoal taste to it. The ribs should have been fall of the bone tender but instead had to be ripped from the bone. the pulled pork was good once completely drenched in their BBQ sauce. The BBQ sauce itself was another problem, I don't know what they use as their base (it doesn't taste like tomato) but its like water. I felt like I was squirting watered down store-brand BBQ sauce on my food. Not even the cornbread was good enough to garner another star here.

The service was completely lacking again. I hate having to waive down servers to get refills, condiments, or the check. They should be making routine stops to your table make sure everything is as it should be.

But I am not done yet...

I came in about 2 months later to pick up a large take out order from work. (thankfully i was not paying for it) The food order was ready when I got there and the server (or whatever you call the to-go order people) was nice enough to throw in some extra corn bread and condiments. I guess it was to make up for the disaster that I was soon to uncover.

 I brought the food back to work, popped open the boxes and there was a collective ""WTF"" like response when everyone saw what was inside. The meat was burned. I am not saying over cooked, but i was burned. About 40% of each piece of meat was just pure tar and black ash. It couldn't even been eaten. I don't understand why a cook would do this! Its just plain mean! Our manager called FD back and totally bitched them out. I think she got her money back or a discount but seriously... I could probably get better BBQ at Albertsons.

I visited my brother and mother in Nevada over this past Thanksgiving. Typically when I see my brother, it gives us an opportunity to eat meals we don't normally eat.  This time he said ""I've gotta take you to Famous Daves!""  Usually my brother's judgement is questionable, but not on this day.  He was 100% right, and for the rest of the night, I was thinking about how delicious those ribs were.  I will be back.  I may even go to the nearest one to me, which is nearly 45+ minutes away.

I've been sat in the bar a few times, and hate it in there. I usually always get good service in the resturaunt so I have asked to be sat in there when the hostess starts heading to the bar. Last week the hostess didn't listen and insisted on seating my husband and I in the bar. The resturaunt side always has us in and out within 35 minutes. The bar takes forever, no matter who is bartending. This time in the bar it took us 1:15 to eat and get out of there. We ordered chicken and pork off their new meal deals. The food is already smoked/cooked, so why on earth it took almost 30 mins to get food is beyond me. After finishing our food and putting our napkins on our plates, it took another 10 mins for the bartender to ask us about dessert, 10 more mins to get dessert, and after those were finishes, 10 mins to get out check. After another 10 minutes, I ended up walking my check up to the bartender to run our card. The bartender wasn't even that friendly on top of it. It was like the people eating bothered her. She had about 4 customers at the bar and there were 2 other tables eating. Not even that busy. I also assume the bartender was some sort of manager the way she barked orders to the other staff. Take a word of advice and eat in the resturaunt unless you plan of spending the day there and getting crappy service...

4014525,2010-09-15,2,KUOa1acSFn6DkO9jp-sn6A,"Zooey-Mama!  This place has some decent 'que for being a chain.  I mean that in the nicest way.  This is some good stuff!

It was 'date night' recently and the lady and I finally decided to go visit Famous Dave's since we've always talked about it but never quite made the committment to try it.  So I gassed up the ride, put on some Mr. Bean in the DVD player, microwaved some popcorn, put out a couple Klondike Bars (hmmm...what wouldn't I do for a Klondike Bar?), and said ""Later, kids!""  And we were off!  Although, thinking back I think I forgot to leave another phone number in case of emergencies.  Luckily, everything was fine when we got back home.  Except the funny English accent my little one gave me upon our arrival (thanks Mr. Bean).

Famous Dave's interior is really...decorated.  This place is like the Disneyland of BBQ!  There's stuff everywhere, I guess this is what it's like to come to a corporate BBQ!  Nothing like those down home places where all you smell is smoke, the walls are dingy, and the chairs are rickety.  Looks like Dave's been making a healthy buck on his 'que.  But the place was inviting nonetheless.  

Famous Dave's has a good menu that includes lots of appetizers, salads, burgers, sandwiches, soups, and BBQ combos.  But we were there for one thing only, the infamous 'Que for Two' for $19.99!  Sorry, payday wasn't until the next week and it was all we could afford.  Hard times I tell ya!  Upon ordering this from our server with some cold drinks, he was on his way.  20 minutes later our BBQ bliss had arrived.

I heard from co-workers that the Que for Two wasn't enough for two people and that I would be hungry afterwards.  Me being a 'husky' sized Asian boy was a little let down upon hearing this.  But when our platter arrived, I sure wasn't disappointed!  There was more than enough food for two!  We had four of Dave's 'Famous' ribs, 1/2 a BBQ chicken, 1/2 a serving of chopped pork+1/2 a serving of beef brisket (I couldn't decide on which one so I asked for both..ha ha), Famous Fries, two cornbread muffins, and a side of garlic red skin mashed potatoes.  I gotta tell ya'...it was all pretty good!  The ribs were moist, flavored well, and cooked just right with a tiny bit of bite in em'.  The chopped pork and the brisket were very good too, and tender.  But the biggest surprise for me was the chicken.  Often times chicken can get dry in a BBQ pit but this one was super succulent and moist, and the rub was great.  This was my fav of the night.  And it was all so good with their sauces!  I liked all six of them but my favs were their original Rich & Sassy, Sweet & Zesty, and the Devil's Spit (sucker is spicy hot!).  Service was good, our server kept up with us and kept us stocked with wet naps and our drinks full.  

Next time, I'm taking the kids with us and we're so gonna have the All-American BBQ Feast...old school and served on a trash can lid!  The lid is lined with paper...of course.  I saw it that night on a table...and the sucker is HUGE!  It can easily feed four people...unless you're a mighty Samoan...then this would be considered your 'Que for Two'.  

We had enough food leftover to take a doggie bag home for the kids.  Admittedly, I finished the last rib that night as a midnight snack.  But I did leave the fries for them!  But I did also manage to finish the little one's Klondike Bar.  Boy, am I a big lil' piggy.",QCtHk02W_Asu2LFfdmGQDA,1,1,4,ceZ27HfFSFInGcpOSWcVZg

Nothing bothers me more at a restaurant than a long wait when the place is dead.  I totally understand if service lags when the place is hopping, but not when it's quiet.  My last two time I've been here I got the same service.  Took a while to be seated and once seated, took forever to take my order.  Once you get your order in, the food doesn't take too long. So, you can't blame the cooks.  However, my bill arrived about 5 minutes after I got my food.  Talk about poor service. Take forever to seat you and get your order, but can't wait to kick you out.  This wasn't a one off thing.  Happened my last two visits here.  I would give this place less stars, but my belly left satisfied everytime.

Then we order raspberry lemonade & strawberry lemonade & she mixes them up ... Then we have to literally wave her down for refills ! Her name is REDD. I'm 200% sure she is high as can be. Our food came out in 10 mins , & it tastes reheated. REDD offered us sauces but failed to bring them so we had to ask someone else to grab them for us. She grabs my plate not even asking me if I want a to go box ...so here goes another 30 mins before we get our check to go. Still no lemons for my water either .... Now on to talk about the food ....

The brisket was just full of fat , so it was GROSS. I had 2 pieces & left it alone. 
The mashed potatoes were OKAY , I've had better. 
The mac & cheese was disgusting !!!!! It didn't stand a chance.

The assortment of sweet, spicy, tangy, etc sauces was a good variety as there is something for everybody. My sandwich was tasty as the meat was cooked well and the coleslaw actually was a nice extra to have on this particular concoction.

We've gone here twice and both times we ordered the Que for Two, $19.99- which is a special (great deal), but you must ask for it, since it isn't on the menu. We got the following (several choices): brisket (my favorite- but ask for it ""lean""), ribs (my husband's favorite), chicken, two corn muffins, steak fries, coleslaw, and a slice of toast. The service was not only great, but quite speedy- we actually got our food in five minutes! The meat is so tender- falls off the bone tender, the (yummy) corn muffins , and the fries were very good as well (don't usually like steak fries so I was pleasantly surprised). On your table sits a paper towel dispenser and wet naps tucked in the sugar dish- which you will need to use because as you know, your hands will get very dirty. Also, there are five signature sauces, like Devil's Spit (hot! unless you like the heat) and Sweet N Sassy. The server can explain what each sauce contains or you can be adventurous and try them all. We had the bread pudding for dessert, which is more like a flan (love flan), served with a scoop of vanilla and whipped cream with a gooey caramel nut sauce- delicious, but we were so full at that point that we didn't finish it. (And we did some shopping/walking afterwards- one of the best strip malls in the city, BTW.)

There are other feasts on the menu for groups of four- which are great deals and served on trash can lids. Sign up on their e-mail list for coupons.

4528884,2016-03-10,0,KUOa1acSFn6DkO9jp-sn6A,"We have been coming here for many years now. At first it started out great, with amazing service and really great servers. A few years back they got a new general manager in and we had two trips that were just atrocious (one trip involved the manager herself who was beyond rude to us) so we stopped coming for awhile. Last year we started coming back and have had the best service every time. A few weeks ago we had server Michael (a very happy young black gentleman) around 7pm and he was absolutely spot on!! He had the biggest smile and was genuinely interested in our dining experience right through to the check, not just a forced politeness like many servers. Even when he was ridiculously busy with several tables he checked on us with lightning speed. If he had his hands full he would STILL pause and say I'll be right back with those cocktails for you folks, just to keep us updated that they were on the way. So many restaurants you wait and wait and don't know if they forgot about you, were just busy, or what the deal was, so this was really refreshing! What impressed me the most was soda refills without us ever saying a word, offers for replacement alcoholic beverages, and the fact that every single time he went back towards the kitchen he grabbed empty plates or glasses from our table or his other tables. I watch so many servers who mosey along and perhaps check in with their table but never clear it, leaving everything to the busers. He not only ran around bringing all this orders out to the tables, but you could see he was sizing up drinks and plates every time he went back too. We were in and out within a half hour. I cannot thank him enough for the excellent service. We tipped him well and want to recommend everyone ask to be seated with him if he is working.

4621867,2018-05-28,0,KUOa1acSFn6DkO9jp-sn6A,"Famous Dave's was a favorite of my boyfriend, and I was quite excited to see what the excitement was about. The restaurant is spacious with booths and family dining tables tastefully decorated in a hunting motif. The wooden tables and walls gives for a nice ambiance for good eatin'!
Like most bbq restaurants you have more options than you can choose from, for me it's always the 2 meat with 2 sides. It's necessary for me to always have one of the meat choices be ribs. I love ribs. Pork and beef alike, I don't discriminate when it comes to red meat. I am a believer.
The first thing to come to the table was their famous bread pudding.. As my boyfriend MUST always eat dessert first, I have the opportunity to know if I need to leave room for my own after dinner. The bread pudding is so good that he won't order any other option. The bowl it's served in could hold a King size portion of linguini pasta. The dessert itself is beautiful, the way it glistens it what looks like candied pecans and fun juice. Slipping down the side was a nice size scoop of old fashion vanilla ice cream; which you need. This dessert isn't for someone who can not appreciate sugar. It was pretty dang good, I could only handle a bite, but my photo will show you that was not the case for my boyfriend.
I ordered ribs and a hot link with a side of green beans (small bacon pieces thru out), spicy macaroni and cheese, then of course I paid the extra for the loaded baked potato. Because what's BBQ without a baked potato? It came with a delightfully sweet corn bread muffin and a thick slice of white bread.
Famous Dave's have a few sauce options on the table and they definitely have more variety then most. I tend to like the more spicy of the sauces. 
The ribs though... Wow.. I was very impressed by the cut of meat. It started a conversation, and a failed Google search attempt, to find out where they purchase their meat. That good. The rib was seasoned slightly leaving a ton of room for me to taste the beautiful taste of meat. It was thick and meaty.. It was purrfect.
I highly recommend Famous Dave's for a couple, group of friends, or family. You can't go wrong. It's good enough to keep the table quiet, while everyone licks and devours what fun deliciousness is in front of them.

1.  Menu - It can be difficult to figure out what you want, if you don't have a specific item that is your absolute must order. In this case, if you are with friends and family, order the All American Feast which is served on a garbage can lid.  Great selection.

2.  Garbage - Again, if you order the feast that comes on the garbage can lid, which I love as it is in the middle of the table and all share, they you can add on things like sausages and etc for a small fee.  IT is truly great stuff. 

3.  Price - Reasonable.

4.  Kids - They will love it, why?  See point 5.

5.  Sauces - You can put your own sauce and they have plenty of choices on your table. Chances are your kids will not want a sauce as tangy and hot as you want, so this is a great choice for all.

I sat at the bar. My only complaint was the bartender wasn't as attentive as he could have been. There were only 5 people at the bar, yet it was hit and miss for him to notice an obvious need such as an almost empty drink. At one point I got his attention for a drink, but after 5 minutes after not getting one, I had to get his attention again to finally get a drink. No apology that he had forgotten. To his slight defense he was also servicing the waitresses, but there wasn't hardly any orders coming through there.

All the food was prepared well, came out hot and quickly. Our server, Lacey, was wonderful and right on top of things. Price was great for everything we got (even before the sandwich came off the bill). The only gripe I have, is that there were jalapeños in the cheese sauce over the baked potato and it didn't say that on the menu. It wasn't a deal breaker though. The restaurant was clean, bathrooms were clean and we will most definitely go back. 

Update: Rib tips were amazing, bbq chicken totally rocked, broccoli and mashed potatoes were awesome, but the pickled onions topped everything off PERFECTLY! Why have I never seen these here before?

5374116,2011-04-28,0,KUOa1acSFn6DkO9jp-sn6A,"In every culture, the basic instinct to throw meat over an open or
indirect fire is fundamentally ingrained in all. There is something
delicious about the char-grilled flavor and marks that have us
crawling back for more.

I do not know what style of BBQ this is. Is it Memphis, Kansas City,
Carolina, or Texas style? I am not sure, but it is appetizing. The
variety of sauces are different in their own way. There is nothing
more disappointing than getting ready to try all the sauces to and
finding out that they do not have much distinction. My favorite is the
Wilbur's Revenge. It gets some brownie points for references to a
childhood classic, Charlotte's Web. This is their spiciest and it does
not hit you until the aftertaste.

I was not hungry, but my dining buddy was ravenous, so we got the
Dave's Sassy BBQ salad and an order of 12 boneless wings. I know, who
goes to a BBQ joint and orders a salad. I would have agreed with
everyone who makes this statement, but there is something irresistible
about this one. For being a basic greens salad, we opted for the
pulled pork and then smothered it in the Wilbur's revenge made it
thoroughly enjoyable. Normally, I shy away from over dressing a salad,
but not here. BBQ sauce might be my kryptonite. The boneless wings are
nothing special, just your run of the mill variety. For the $10, you
are paying roughly the same price as Buffalo Wild Wings on Boneless
Thursday. If you are dining on any other day of the week, it is a good
deal. If you want more options on sauces then go on Thursday to BWW.

The prices are cheaper than Lucille's, but I will wait until I try
their ribs before I start comparing. Two meats, two sides, and corn
bread at Dave's cost about $10 dollars less than their competitor.",N3oNEwh0qgPqPP3Em6wJXw,1,1,4,PpG7nO1lcf4HfOrxQm9UNw

Our party of 4 was passing through the Vegas area & thought bbq was in order. 
Of course, we Yelp'd the closest place in the area we were in and 4-star Famous Dave's popped up.
It was last Thursday night about 8 p.m. The joint wasn't busy & we showed ourselves to the bar area. Our server was our bartender & she was quite perky with a smile & very attentive.
My Fat Tire was cold & refreshing especially after a long drive with 3 buddies.
My 1/3 slab of ribs arrived at the table steaming hot. Accompanying my ribs were my side choices of the slaw & wedge cut fries. The menu boasted a 4-bone hand rubbed spiced ribs, but there on my plate, I spied a 5th rib! SCORE! Either I was REALLY hungry or the ribs were actually quite tasty...so tasty, as I was taking my last bite off the last available rib on my plate, I had wished I'd ordered a 1/2 slab. As a member of a competition barbeque team, I can honestly say these ribs are better than most teams we've gone up against. 
I can't speak for the restaurant side, but the bar is large with a small selection of draught on tap. Several flat screens hang from the ceilings & viewable from anywhere you sit.
I also can't speak for my compadres' dinner selections, but judging from their empty plates, they also were either very hungry or this place really IS quite tasty.
However, I drew the short straw in sharing a room with the buddy who ordered the side of beans.
Good stuff Famous Dave's. I shall visit another one of these soon, provided I'm in the vicinity of one & have a hankerin' for bbq on the fly.
Cold beers & above par bbq.
Better than warm beers & bland meat.

I sat next to a family where the father kept saying, "" wow, I am a Barbecue snob and I think this barbecue is amazing!"" So of course I looked over to see what this Que king was eating and he had the ribs and the brisket... I Could not let this self proclaimed BBQ snob enjoy all the saucy goodness all alone so I ordered the Ribs and Brisket combo with the mac and cheese and potatoes... 

The waiter brought out the plate and to the eye I was impressed, it looked juicy, tasty and everything a BBQ snob hopeful could ask for. I pulled a rib off the half rack and raised it to my mouth......... Now that you are waiting for some crazy descriptive to tell you how delicious it was take a moment to enter your own word here............... Okay that's enough of that, its my turn, It was Crap, somehow the rib pulled off the half rack but maybe in the 2 foot travel to my mouth it got jet lag or something because it was dull, dry and unexciting. I was in no way impressed and was doubting the BBQ snobs credentials. 

I then figured, "" well I need to be fair, and try the brisket,"" It had that nice brisket look with the pink rim and cooked center so i grabbed my fork and went at it. Hoping to reignite my passion to be on the BBQ snob wagon I tore into it and low and behold I had the same crappy experience, it was dry and had a rather odd taste for brisket. If I could have made a BBQ Snobs citizens arrest or revoked his snob certificate I would have. 

The server was great, he kept my drink full and checked in on us just enough to be very attentive and not a creeper.

Dry and flavorless meat (the ribs are hilariously awful).  Sides that were not real exciting.  The people working there are nice, and the cornbread is ok, which is why I'm not giving them one star. 

For entertainment value it might be worth going here so you can see huge platters of saturated fat being devoured by people who care nothing about what they shovel in their gullets.  The one particular time I was there, my husband and I were fascinated by two large people eating one of the biggest platters of meat I have ever seen, more than I've seen in any casino buffet. 

Am I a BBQ snob?  No, because if you read Raymond B's review, Famous Dave is supposed to satisfy these people.  I just really really want to have better BBQ than I can make at home.  But sadly, Famous Dave's, Memphis, Lucille's, and TC's Rib Crib have all been completely disappointing. 

I don't know what it is about this city and BBQ - we have probably the best selection of restaurants in the entire world, but we have no good BBQ that I have found.  I've had better ribs and BBQ in Washington State, even in a town of 12,000, and WA is more known for its seafood than anything.

So bottom line, I have not found good BBQ anywhere in this town, and this restaurant continues this trend.  If you absolutely have to have fatty meat with loads of sauce which isn't that good, this is a great place to go.

As for everything else, I had the brisket, half a chicken, half a slab of ribs, the green beans, fires, baked beans, and garlic mashed potatoes.....don't judge me. The brisket was okay, I had to keep saucing it up, I would of rather had the tri tip at Lucille's. The chicken wasn't the half rotisserie chicken I was expecting, it was more like a pigeon leg but... it was decently flavored. The ribs were good, nothing to write home about but good enough.

The food was flavorful and amazing. I couldn't have asked for a better satisfaction of my ribs craving after ordering a full rack of St. Louis ribs and chicken with rice, fries, apple somethings, and mashed potatoes.",ANLSKvFmCgRMjxtELq70FQ,0,0,5,FFLut-TqdXN8iVdvR8RHlA

We ordered the feast for 2 and it was indeed, a FEAST lol. They gave us a good portion of food.  It was enough for  2 hooked up plates for each of us.  Most def recommend it!

We got 4 rib bones, coleslaw, a loaded baked potato( upcharge), beans and a dinner salad.  Also came with a corn muffin( loved that, very moist).  Everything was packed very well for takeout.  We enjoyed the meal in our hotel room after a long boring drive from LA.",FVeD1j9SeczVz-jZyPxBJg,0,0,4,ggk4ulFn5y65gvvVeFEJWg

I ordered a bowl of baked potato soup and shared a few bites off of my a brisket plate. The food was nothing special but the service is the reason for the lackluster review. Refills were hard to come by and our server disappeared for minutes at a time. 

I don't see myself returning to this location, in particular.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,6,3,2,IQw6lvSx7rUTt5pggRK5qQ

The staff was friendly and our order was ready when we got there.

The server was delightful, and it is worthy of a stop if you are in need of BBQ - with six different sauces, there is at least one for everyone, and two or three for me!",3XzhO2aJdvVtYhKOCJsPrg,0,0,5,6jUr5c1rePm7vHRr498loA
