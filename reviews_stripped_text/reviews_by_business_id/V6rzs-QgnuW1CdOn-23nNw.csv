Then he called me an ignorant black person threw my credit card at me and told me to write that in my review.  He gave me the check to sign  and I threw it at him in the same manner he threw my credit card at me and left. The owner chased me out the door as if he was going to assault me.

1154585,2014-05-08,3,V6rzs-QgnuW1CdOn-23nNw,"Okay, i took one for the team here.

Was in LV on business and had a craving for catfish.  Based on Yelp reviews I went to this place - it is a long drive from town and when I arrived (about 1:00pm on Wednesday) there were no customers... bad omen but I gave them the benefit of the doubt.

First, this is not a restaurant, as such - it is a fast food joint where you order at a high counter from a big menu on the wall.  Food is brought to your table in Styrofoam containers,  I had catfish, chicken, green beans, and red beans & rice.  the veggies were tasteless except for the odd (dishwater?) aftertaste.  I thought they would be better with salt so i got up and looked for salt - I figured that with 11 tables, there must be salt somewhere.  I found the single salt shaker in the room and used it - honestly, it didn't help.

To their credit, the catfish was not bad - nothing to rave about and certainly not worth the drive but not a bad taste.

I gave them the benefit of the doubt and I suspect most of their business is due to people giving them the benefit.  I can only conclude that the five star reviews are from owners, friends, and family but not from legitimate customers.

Even though the catfish was not bad, I won't be back.",NjK3NfG0P5PYz9W4BbqiMg,6,2,2,Az8OoU_y-ft_dXhuBBQ5Gg
1160319,2015-05-30,2,V6rzs-QgnuW1CdOn-23nNw,"We used to be consistent customers.  The food has always been pretty good though inconsistent in portion. Orders have often had items left out and sides often are not matched to the order.  Yet, we hoped it was the result of growing and that the problems would iron themselves out.  

Suddenly, the doors were closed every time we stopped. So, we gave up until recently.  We were told it had new owners, so we've given it three more tries.

Tonight marks our last attempt to give our support to Southern Style Eatery.  

Somehow, the person answering the phone believes she is doing us a favor by taking our order. I was hung up on once then told ""It's alright"" when I called back and said she must have accidentally hung up. She started taking my order then, suddenly, someone else took the phone, so I got to start all over.  Her voice was deadpan and she seemed quite irritated.  Not once did either of them say ""thank you.""  In fact, she ended her side of the call with""alright."" 

We've overlooked a lot but rudeness will not cut it. Tonight was the third strike out.  I suspect the doors will be closed again soon unless these two employees learn some people skills and appreciation for every customer that comes through their door.",6YPQSBZrBSJMpj2rw6AScw,5,1,1,dwLiq-HIxbWuoTDUGeBHuQ

1434005,2014-04-24,0,V6rzs-QgnuW1CdOn-23nNw,"I got a mailer for this place and figured I would try some Southern Food. This place was far from perfect. I was there the other day and tried chicken tenders that were decent but not great, and a grilled pork chop that was ok but too dry. Red beans and rice didn't really have much flavor, and cole slaw didn't seem fresh. It is super cheap though, so I wasn't really complaining.

I gave it a second chance because it's nearby and I'm sick of every other restaurant around; Plus its so cheap that I figured it was a minimal investment to at least see if there was anything worthy of making it into the rotation.

I have never been so glad that I gave a restaurant a second chance. I tried the fish, grilled and fried, and I couldn't even say why I tried it. I have never really liked cooked fish. I love sushi, but I don't have near the same feelings for even very high quality cooked fish. For whatever reason, I was in the mood to try the catfish here, and it was seriously life-changing. I've never had a grilled fish fillet before that was this good. The fried fillet was good too, but the grilled was simply out of this world. I spent my whole life thinking I didn't like grilled fish. As a sushi fan I've given grilled fish plenty of chances, and always was disappointed. I've had grilled fish at American Fish and Mastro's, and for $6.50 this was head and shoulders above any other grilled fish I've ever had in my life. It was seriously so unexpectedly good that it makes me feel like I need to evaluate what else I might have been wrong about.

I think this place is still working a lot of kinks out of the system, I can't say I've really enjoyed any of the sides I've gotten, and after my first visit I really could not believe the 5-star reviews of this place. But the fish was literally beyond belief. I did not know that a catfish fillet could be that good. Like I said, this place is far from perfect, and some of the issues are things that would normally cause me great concern, but this fish was so good that I'm not sure there's anything I wouldn't let slide. This place has to be by far the best value of any restaurant in Las Vegas. Try the fish. You won't regret it.",zcmCg2nsT0pBinXiVEA5Wg,1,0,5,Y6z16MkqqByusgqwkO6LTQ
1476059,2014-09-03,4,V6rzs-QgnuW1CdOn-23nNw,"You have to know what to order here: the grilled fish and mac and cheese.
You have to know what to expect here: slow but earnest service in a no-frills location, inconsistent price to quality ratio.

The grilled fish is great- it's cooked with a vegetable mix and is well seasoned. A four-piece combo includes two sides for a mad-cheap $8 not including drink. Mac was a great side, creamy and cheesy even if it was served out of an aluminum pan then microwaved, which made me question how fresh it was. 

The grilled shrimp salad though? Skip it.
$9 portion is half of a takeout box, and other than the lettuce and tomatoes, the veggies on the salad are grilled, which I found bizarre. Shrimp was plentiful (7 pieces or so?) but sadly overcooked and rubbery. Italian dressing was mostly oil. If this is their usual execution, they should remove this dish from the menu altogether.

Service is slow- waited over 20 minutes for a takeout order. Kitchen seems a bit unorganized and inefficient. Orders are placed at a walk-up counter, dine-in meals are bought out in Styrofoam boxes.  But the guys working here are making everything to order, and are friendly to boot.

Subtracted an additional star due to an issue at the register: for some reason their computer was unable to read my card and needed to be entered manually. Worker had me read my card number out loud with expiration date, a huge violation of privacy and a security risk, in order to do so.

Upon 1st entering there's the counter with a register. We assumed we ordered there & they would bring the food out to us. After they asked if we were picking up or dining in they mentioned we should go sit down in the dinning room to the left. Food is great here. We ordered various items (see pictures). I am not a catfish fan but I tried a bite of my co-workers & I was wowed. It was nice & crispy with cornmeal batter. Not greasy at all. I will have to get that next time we go back. My co-worker that got the fried chicken said that it was good but a little salty in the crust. Service needs some work. Gentleman just stood at the end of our table when we sat down not saying anything. I finally mentioned that we'd like some drinks since we were all still milling over the menus. Service over all was slow & if you're on a lunch hour you might want to phone in your order ahead of time & pick it up. Unfortunately it's too far away to travel during my lunch hour (ended up taking us hour & 45 minutes) but I will definitely be going back for dinner time for the food.,uByIGcI5EJeKNGyBtCkWBw,0,0,4,wXOIC1sMf34_w3bKZ-ssEg

2741678,2015-03-22,4,V6rzs-QgnuW1CdOn-23nNw,"One word. CATFISH. 

No, not the stupid reality show. The actual fish. You can get your catfish fix here. Wifey was craving fish so a search on Yelp turned up with this place as the first entry. First visit here I am impressed with several things.

For to go orders, you order at the counter. For dine in, you go sit down in the adjacent room and somebody comes out to take your order.

We ordered two entrees of catfish, one fried and one grilled so that we can taste both styles. Both come with 2 sides, in which we got yams, collard greens, mac n cheese, and fries. We also ordered fried oysters and 10 piece wings.

The catfish (3 piece $7.99). I like the fact that you have the choice of having it grilled or fried. Only thing is, I like it better fried here. Dont get me wrong. The grilled is ok. Its just that it seemed more oily than the fried. Like they deep fried it really quick, than threw some seasoning on it. There seemed to be way more oil on the bottom of my plate for the grilled fish. The fried? Stupendous. Just the right amount of cornmeal. Very crispy and flavorful. Now this folks, is what southern fried catfish is supposed to taste like. 

The sides. For you sugar lovers, the yams would be right up your alley. It just might end up being dessert. I think they had it simmered in some kind of molasses infused water until soft. Then serve it to you with sprinkled brown sugar on top. The collard greens were decent. I would say almost equivalent to spinach. This dish was tad bit salty for me though. The mac n cheese good. It is sprinkled with a bit of black pepper so for you that have kids, they might not like it because of that. The fries are crinkle cut. Nothin special.

Fried oysters (6 piece $11.99). Im not into these things but my wife and oldest son said they were very good. I was almost tempted to pick one up and eat it because it was breaded perfectly just like the fish.

The wings (10 piece party pack $8.99). Make sure specify what wings you want. You can order whole chicken wings which are like half the chicken. Kind of like chickens on steroids. The wings I got were your basic hot wings. Only 3 flavors available which were mild, hot, and barbeque. I got hot which was a buffalo hot sauce style and barbeque. Btw, the wings are breaded so if you are not into that, then pass on it.

Service was above average. There were three guys behind the counter constantly staying busy so that was a good sign. One of them took our order and brought our food out to us. He also checked up on us every so often. The dining area is a decent sized one with enough tables and chairs for about 25 people.

Overall, I would recommend going to this place because the fried catfish is on point, the drinks are unlimited serve yourself (there is a fountain drink machine over in the corner with coke products), and the sides are as southern as you can get. Only gripes were that they didnt have fried okra, the grilled fish was more greasy than the fried, and that wait time was a bit long to get the food. In their defense though, they make everything from scratch so I can understand why it took so long. Just dont come here if you're pressed for time. I will definitley be back to try their pork chops, chicken tenders, and po boy sandwiches.

3167503,2015-05-14,3,V6rzs-QgnuW1CdOn-23nNw,"Not long ago, Restaurant.com was having one of their somewhat usual sales where you could pick up super cheap coupons. Southern Style Eatery happened to be one of those and I purchased a $15 coupon for under $3. If you've ever used Restaurant.com you know that their coupons really have no expiration date, and it's generally always up to the restaurant when they start or stop participating in offering them. Unfortunately, SSE seems to be a place that likes to be very selective on accepting coupons. In what would have easily been a 4 star review, the coupon eventually ended up being a fiasco and ruined our whole experience here...but I'll get back to it.

I believe Southern Style Eatery has only been around for a year or so, maybe two. We've seen it a number of times when in the little strip mall, and they're actually getting ready to open a second location inside the AMPM on Craig & Rancho, which I drive by daily. I heard that location was going to have a much more specialized, somewhat limited menu, so I figured it was finally time to check out the original. From the outside it looks like a take out only place, but they have a pretty large dining area in the space next door. When you dine in, it's full service for the most part, besides a drink fountain in the back corner. There's not much going on in the place, it's a very simple restaurant, but there's certainly nothing wrong with that. I actually really like the simplicity. 

After we get seated, we start checking out the menu. It's a pretty big menu, and most of their stuff is priced really well. I was a bit surprised that they don't offer fried chicken though, especially since they offer quite a few fried items. No big deal, I like it all and we had a coupon, so we decided to order a few items to try.

Fried Catfish - With so many good reviews, this was something I had to try. For only $8, you get 3 pieces of fish. At that price, I was not expecting to get such large pieces. The cornmeal batter was just right, and had great flavor. One of my pieces was unusually big and a small portion of it wasn't cooked all the way though. A very minor setback as the rest was nice and flaky, and for the price, this is some really good fried fish.

Ribs - These were on a special that day, so we figured why not. I believe the special price was only $9 and included one side. You can a good amount of ribs, the meat was cooked well and nearly at the point of fall off the bone, but there was a little too much sauce on it for my taste. Even still, really solid for the price.

BBQ Chicken - Another item in their special menu. It came out hot and juicy, and was cooked well. My only gripe was that much like the ribs, it was kind of slathered in sauce. If the skin had any crispiness at all, it was lost in the sauce.

Sides - Since we ordered multiple items, we sampled nearly all their sides. While nothing really stood out as excellent, they were all fairly decent. The mac & cheese was slightly bland, but both the potato salad and greens were above average. 

When the waitress/cook (the owner's mother) was ready to get our check, I informed her of the coupon I had. From there on, her tune changed in a big way and everything went downhill. She basically got pissed at me and told me I should have told her that we had a coupon before we sat down. She then went on to tell me she didn't know how to use the coupons and we had to wait there at least 30 minutes for someone to come back and put the coupon in. When I asked her how she didn't know, she showed me a printed one and said that's the only ones she knows how to take. I sat there and compared the printed, and one on my phone and couldn't find any difference. She insisted I had to wait until whoever knew their POS came back to input a simple code. When he arrived 45 minutes later, he had an attitude with me and told me they don't take them anymore, but would do it this one time. Wait...what...this lady just showed me someone else's printed coupon sitting next to the register, and you're acting like your doing me a favor by accepting mine? C'mon. I wouldn't find out until the next day when I decided to check, but they were still selling the same coupon. Why they wanted to cause such an issue and make me wait because their employees aren't trained properly is beyond me. How their attitudes changed so much over a simple coupon made me seriously reconsider ever coming back.

But while standing around at the counter waiting to finally pay for my food, I witnessed the lady who waited on us and assumedly cook our meal prepare food, in a way that had to break health code violation. She was answering phones, taking orders, touching the computer and making food all at the same time. Never once washed her hands, then even went on to put her pen and pad right on to the same prep station the catfish was on. 

Since I didn't get sick or die, I'll hope my food was different and 2 stars is likely too generous, but I won't be back now for sure.",QqRSNjWhfUFv1ZU0OnYKZQ,7,3,2,rty8blcbqN6vNCJ2fpK2Sg

I enjoyed a 3 piece fried fish with greens and mac and cheese.  My wife had a shrimp Po Boy with mashed potatoes and my daughter enjoyed the kids fried shrimp.

The prices here are extremely reasonable and the portion size is very large.

I can tell you that this is the best fried fish I have had in Las Vegas.  My wife couldn't stop talking about how good the shrimp Po Boy was and my daughter loved her meal.  The collared greens were the best I have ever had.  Yes, the best, ever.  The Mac and Cheese was decent, but nothing special.  The mashed potatoes had this gravy that was unlike anything I have ever had.  It had a unique fish fry taste to it that was nothing short of spectacular. 

When I go back, very soon, I will have the 3 piece fish again with the greens and potatoes.  I always consume a very large portion of food and I was very satisfied with the 3 piece fish.  They were huge!

3487174,2016-08-25,3,V6rzs-QgnuW1CdOn-23nNw,"So I was super excited to try this place!  I'm always on the look out for a good soul food restaurant.  Unfortunately we were totally disappointed.  

1) The floor was sticky,  I mean really sticky.  My flats were coming off as I walked.  Nasty!

2) The table was sticky, my daughter put her hands in spilled soda when we sat. 

3) The table wobbled, and we're not talking that slight barely noticeable wobble.  I was searching for something to balance the table.  

4) The ketchup & hot sauce bottles were nearly empty and crusty with filth. 

5) The customer service was terrible.  I ordered grilled shrimp and she brought out fried shrimp.  I told her it was supposed to be grilled & she told me,  ""Uh-uh you didn't specify""  & didn't offer to replace them.  I just told her you're completely right and I'm wrong.  

6) The server never brought me a water.  

7) She forgot to bring out my red beans until 10 minutes after the meal was served.  

8) They were out of: french fries and corn bread.

Now let's talk about the food...

9) The shrimp was overcooked.

10) My husband's meatloaf was cold & bland.  

11) The mashed potatoes had damn near whole potatoes in it.  

12) My red beans were 90% bean juice & the tiny amount of rice that came with the beans was hard. 

In addition to all that, they were super unprofessional and yelled absurd things across the dining room at each other,  but on the plus side we now know the servers grandson is getting some money from his dad's money $100 for back to school, $50 for his birthday, and that girl wasn't with him when he went to visit.   So there's that.   

The reason we gave it 2 stars at all was because the mac n cheese was decent & my daughter really liked her chicken fingers.  Needless to say we won't be going back.  I love supporting small business,  but I can't very behind this one. It was a terrible experience.",vlDBD8gZ_YDA_VGKzIcPnQ,3,2,2,yBsP31PewoU11c-Ma6Pm2g

The mac and cheese was alright; I'd give it another go but will probably try another side next time.  For under $10 I got three pieces of fresh fried catfish with two sides.  I did get it to go but even with them cooking the fish right then it did not take too long until I was handed a box o' deliciousness.

I will be back the next time a catfish craving hits.",HEaplFuRQF9ztUpAvr1bgA,1,0,4,A5-6nZlMn0-Qxr4keVtwDQ

We ordered the following:

1.  Grilled shrimp po' boy with red beans n rice.  The sandwich for starter is delicious, downside was you only get four little shrimp.  I would suggest placing 6-8 to make this $9 order a bit more worth it for your customer.  The roll is perfectly flavored with the right amount of lettuce, tomatoes and pickles.  

2.  Red beans n rice:  This dish lacked seasoning but was cooked perfectly with sausage in the beans.  Overall very good but room for improvement.

3.  Mashed potatoes, very good.

4.  Catfish, DA BOMB!!!!  'NUFF SAID

5. JUMBO SHRIMP FRIED AGAIN  DA' BOMB!!!

6.  Mac n Cheese:  cheesy and cooked perfectly!!!  Add some salt and/or pepper and it's perfect.

Overall I am very pleased to have found them on restaurant.com and will be back!!!  4 out of 5 stars as there is room for improvement, food is very good, service was friendly and the restaurant was clean.

I called back to make sure she got my order and to give my name.  This time I heard ""got it,"" and then the click.  I soon learned that this was because the phone is in their back office and the cook has to stop what she's doing to run back and answer the phone.  Yes, the cook is also in charge of answering the phone.  No surprise--the guy seemed too confused to be able to handle phone orders.  This place was a symphony of confusion and disorganization, due in large part to the fact that only two people were running the place.   During my long wait I witnessed lots of fried food just sitting there in open Styrofoam go-boxes, while they went back to the cooler to drag out mashed potatoes and mac and cheese to warm up in the microwave.  Even though I repeated my sides to them more than once, they got two of four sides right.  My oysters were cold.  But my wife's fried fish, the reason we decided on this place for take-home in the first place, was tough and inedible.

Well this place left a lot to be desired. Let's start with first things .. Apparently someone who works at the restaurant didn't have a baby sitter bc there was a random child running throughout the restaurant dining and to go area... She was quite rambunctious and our table actually attempted to intervene when she was climbing over furniture to make sure she didn't fall ... Not professional at all. Number 2... I understand it's a small operation but the food took almost an hour to come out for a party of 5. If all the food was hot I wouldn't complain but the macaroni and cheese was cold .. And the extra cheese they put on top wasn't even melted .. No bueno.. Seeing how most of their menu consists of fried food I don't understand the wait time. Salt and pepper we're not on every table ... And by 630 a lot of food had already run out (no cornbread no yams).
The meat did come out hot the Sides not so much .. I ordered the grilled shrimp which isn't technically grilled I think it's sautéed but it was good non the less .. Others in my party had fried fish and fried chicken which they said tasted well .. Would I probably eat here again ... Yes but I won't rush back ..",oknzpMgHOnbijayveG-PKQ,1,0,2,ZpOUG-ydYsXwsyWPekmjow

We yelped this place & decided to try it out since we're in town for a few days. Walked in and it was a few other customers. The staff was very friendly upon our entrance. We were asked if we were dining in or take out, we decided to dine in. The server advised us of the daily special & the sides that were available. 

We ordered 12 fried shrimp, 3 catfish filets, 3 chicken tenders, sides were potato salad & yams. & 1 kids meal 3 fried shrimp & mashed potatoes. The shrimp were huge!!! They use cornmeal for the batter so that part was just OK, but they were good & worth trying. The catfish was the bomb.com!!!! Lightly breaded and not fishy smelling! The tenders were juicy & flavorful. The sides were good too. We even had food 2 go!!! 

Takes about 20mins to prepare, but it was all fresh & piping hot when it was ready. I'd definitely come back for more when I'm in town. Yelp didn't disappoint today!!!",KKLWlqtaspsWHYGQLfUl1w,7,4,5,I02fUMtHutRfnubs1y7BYg

They were out of shrimp so I had to go with chicken.  Chicken was good.  I asked for ranch and there was about a tablespoon in a cup. Obviously there is a ranch shortage in the world that I don't know about.  
I ordered a side of fish to try it.  To my surprise, the fish and additional sides were not in my order when I got home.  Super annoying!

The po boy is seriously the best one I've had, EVER. The shrimp were HUGE! The breading was perfect, they were juicy and the sandwich itself is large! The side of fries were also delicious and not all soggy and funky. The chicken tenders were soooo juicy and tender and not overly breaded and HUGE as well! Would def purchase them again!

They also serve a franks red hot sauce (idk if its the real franks) hot sauce, not this Louisiana hot sauce crap! The real deal!

The location is excellent, and what I mean by that is; you do not have to go into the alphabet streets to get great tasting soul food! upon entering the restaurant I was greeted by very pleasant older woman that reminded me of someone's mother, that aunt that you love to visit, or just the very pleasant neighbor down the street that always make you feel welcome to come over anytime, but it was my mother that she reminded me of when I asked ""is the catfish farm raised or freshwater caught?"" she took one look at me as if she wanted to say.... WHAT THE HELL?!? she then turned and pointed to a young man to her right ""you have to ask Fred"" (I found out later that Fred was her son) I must admit I was very surprised and very pleased to find out that they serve both (I don't do farm raised) I ordered the three piece catfish with red beans and rice and good old macaroni and cheese, catfish was made to perfection, I am not sure if it was frozen but it had a very fresh taste, seasoned perfectly, temperature very hot! Best damn cat fish I've had since my mother moved back to Chicago, now the mac and cheese and the red beans and rice not as good as my mom's but better than any I have tasted here in Vegas, yes even better then the place with the same name as the candy....

4634772,2014-05-03,0,V6rzs-QgnuW1CdOn-23nNw,"I received a coupon the other day in one of those mailers full of coupons and noticed that this place is just around the corner from my house. My niece and I decided to give it a try and I'm so happy we did. I read over the other Yelp reviews and was very excited to give it a go, the coupon had some killer deals.

When we walked in, we were greeted by the super-friendly staff, Larry the owner, is very personable and they are all very polite.

The entire restaurant is very clean, including the restrooms. I love that the kitchen is completely open, you can even see into the refrigerator. The way that they have the restaurant divided, you can dine peacefully while the kitchen bustles. All of the food is prepared and cooked fresh so be a little patient, it is well worth it.

This first round, we came in around 2 o'clock on a quiet Tuesday afternoon, we decided to try a couple of things:

Southern Double Burger with Fries - the patties were homemade, no frozen meat, sweet onions, juicy and fresh with perfectly fried crinkle cut french fries.

Fried Shrimp Po-Boy - succulent, large, golden brown battered shrimp with a butter toasted, soft roll.

Greens - best I've ever had, no bitter aftertaste, perfectly seasoned with a wonderful smokey taste. I added a little hot sauce and they're even better with a little kick.

6 Piece Oysters - perfectly cooked, tender in the middle with just enough batter, great fry batter too, it didn't fall off if you decided to eat your oyster with more than one bite.

Red Beans & Rice - bland but has potential, all of the fresh flavors are there, it just needs a little more time to simmer the beans and some seasonings.

Macaroni & Cheese - needed just a dash of salt and pepper but definitely homemade and delicious.

I'm so happy that they have a self-serve soda and iced tea machine.

The chef was so nice and happy to hear feedback on his cooking, he even brought us out some spiced yams to try. Honestly, I hate yams and my niece didn't know that they were sweet potatoes. One bite, I was in heaven! They were buttery and warm, the spices were on point. I can honestly say, he made me a yam fan. I will probably never order them anywhere but here, but I'll for sure be having them here when they're on the menu.

We had such an awesome experience that my niece and I decided to bring my Grandma back for lunch the next day. Again, everyone was amazing and we tried a few new things too:

12 Piece Jumbo Shrimp - these shrimp were cleaned and cooked perfectly, the batter was light enough to taste the fresh shrimp but cooked perfectly that it stayed on after the first bite. The quality is amazing, they bring a whole new definition to ""jumbo"". You don't find good shrimp like this in Vegas.

Mashed Potatoes & Gravy - needed just a bit of salt and pepper but I couldn't make them any better myself. I'm a huge fan of chunky mashed potatoes, I don't like them so smooth they can be used as wallpaper paste. They were buttery and delicious. The gravy was perfect, smooth and packed with flavor.

Coleslaw - creamy but not too sweet. I'm not a huge coleslaw fan but this is a very good side dish. Being homemade never hurts.

6 Piece Fried Fish - this fish was so moist and the breading was delicious. I ordered way too much, the portion is huge, well worth the money.

Fried Oyster Po-Boy - so my niece can't get enough of the fried oysters. She wasn't so sure about them yesterday but they've made a new fan.

Again, the chef was so nice and happy to hear feedback on his cooking, he brought us each a bowl of his homemade banana pudding with Nilla wafers to try. I was in a food coma. I can't wait to go back and I'm definitely telling everyone where to go to try some Southern Style Eats.",7QXtasoVTQJuEjbmbLsDGA,2,0,5,9JUKS9hMAeDuQCjsbPFsZw

4764545,2015-12-15,3,V6rzs-QgnuW1CdOn-23nNw,"I wanted this place to succeed. I needed somewhere that reminded me of home. I wanted this place to shed all of the negative reviews and become a place people like myself can feel good about supporting. I'm so disappointed with this place.

With all of that being said, My friend and I visited this place tonight, for the second time this week. We wanted the same thing we got last night, maybe minus the long wait and the banana pudding. We wanted that good southern soul food taste that we had been craving. We couldn't deny it, we were hooked.

We traveled 20 minutes away from home and got to this place at 7:09 pm. When we walked in, we were greeted by our server yesterday. We knew the process already so we picked a seat and sat down. That was at 7:10 pm. We didn't get a menu until 7:14pm. It took us 2 minutes to decide what we wanted, but it took her until 7:20 to come back out to take our order.

We ordered the Sunday's Special: Smothered Chicken (White Meat) with Dressing and Mac&Cheese as sides and Yams as the additional side. My friend ordered 3 piece Whole Wings with Mashed Potatoes (No Gravy) and Greens as sides. She also added 3 pieces of Fried Fish on too. This time, drinks were optional and we declined.

Let me mention, I asked the waitress if I could add on the Fish and she ignored me. I assumed she didn't hear me but there was no way for her not too. My friend then repeated my question and she nodded yes, like we should have known the answer already. That was strike one.

As we were waiting for our food, another couple walked in. This was maybe 10 minutes after we sat down. She promptly gave them a menu and took their order. They didn't have to wait for her to finish talking in the back, like we did. They ordered and started waiting like us.

It's now, 7:40pm, 20 mins before they're suppose to close. We were getting very irritated, because this was now the 2nd day of waiting 40+ mins for food that should take 15-20 mins tops.

The waitress came back, I thought she was going to give us an update on our food, but she didn't. She grabbed a mop and went to clean the restroom. She was accompanied by 3 little boys, around the age 8, as she cleaned the bathrooms. They stayed in there for about 10 minutes.

She came out and went back into the kitchen. To be honest, we didn't think she was going to wash her hands, so I got up and walked towards the front, where the kitchen is. I did see her grab a paper towel so I assumed she washed her hands, although I was too slow In walking to actually confirm.

It's now 7:50pm. I stood at the front for a few minutes. I wanted to see what the hell was taking so long. I observed 3 little boys in the kitchen. I didn't see them wash their hands at all. 1 of the boys, in particular, was coughing profusely near the food. I presumed he was sick because he was taking out trash with no jacket on.

Let me throw in, while I was standing there, the cook asked if I wanted gravy on my dressing. I realized that she was working on our food. With my response, they finished a couple plates, and stuck the plates in the window to be picked up and dropped off at our table.

The waitress grabbed the plates and walked towards the couple that entered after us. This was at 7:55pm, by the way. She served them their food 1st. I was confused as to why they were getting food 1st, so I walked back towards our table, which happened to be next to the couple.

The lady went back to the window and grabbed the other plates, she then took those plates to that table also. At this point they had 3 plates of food on their table.

The woman of the couple told the waitress that it wasn't her food. The waitress then took our plate of food back to the window and she was pissed. She said, ""This is the s**t I don't like!"" Her and the male cook had a short argument and then she stormed away and came towards our table. She put the plate on our table, in front of my friend, and walked away. She walked back to the window and inquired about my plate.

At 7:59pm the waitress walked up to our table and said, we only have dark meat left. They gave away the last white meat. Do you want me to bring you a menu?"" I said, ""No!"" The waitress away like that was that. I called her back over after few seconds and she hesitantly walked back over. I told her that my friend's potatoes had gravy on it and he ordered it without gravy. She said, ""Sorry, I'm not in the kitchen."" I said that I didn't have any food so my friend didn't want her's. She didn't want to eat food that was picked over by another table either.

The lady snatched the plate off the table, without saying a word, and slammed it in the window. She said, ""Y'all didn't have the other plate, now they don't want this one."" We could hear the cooks in the back complaining. They were saying, ""That's f'd up!"" This was 8:03pm.

We went out the main door and said that were not waiting another 40 mins. They never acknowledged us!

They were added to our ""Never Again"" list!!!",trO6aQpnXxRXqIyKQ_ryrQ,10,2,1,D9-beUWJWHuoXDTjEExcxA

4811238,2016-05-10,0,V6rzs-QgnuW1CdOn-23nNw,"We ordered takeout food on the afternoon of May 6, with no incident. This was the 1st time I had been there and my sister and mother raved about the food - they weren't wrong! We ordered grilled and fried fish & shrimp - all of it was delicious - well seasoned, not fishy smelling, light breading and not greasy at all.
We decided to order grilled shrimp and fried fish for Mother's Day and placed the order on Saturday.  It was to be ready at 2:00 pm on May 8th.  We went to pick up our order and they couldn't even remember it! The man told my sister it would be 10-12 minutes, so we waited.  Two other women came in to pick up a catering order to be delivered (they offer delivery) that they placed 2 days before, because they called them and told them they had to come pick it up!  The man then asked my sister if she was with the 2 women; now he just talked to her and had come in before them!  He kept promising my sister that they were working on it.  She saw one customer bussing her own tables, because there was no busboy.
Unfortunately the food suffers because of the management of the business.  They can even hire some high school kids to be servers and bus staff.  They need 1-2 up front and a food expediter in the kitchen.
How did this establishment even get a food license and where is the Health Department when kids are running around coughing on the food?

Simple. Rudeness and horrible, horrible customer service. 

It has been made very plain to us that if you call in an order, YOU ARE BOTHERING THEM AND THEY DO NOT WANT TO DEAL WITH YOU. Since we never eat in the always sweltering dining room, this is a problem. They are flat out rude. I tried to tell the old owners that randomly changing their business hours (without posting a sign) and barely speaking into the phone enough to be heard over the background noise was NOT a way to do business, but they never listened.

Apparently, that is the ONLY way to do business in that building. We were excited when I read there were new owners, but the new staff of Southern Style Eatery are just as UN-grateful for your business as the old ones. They're only slightly better organized, but any discounts for checking in or reviewing are have been randomly applied depending on the technological competence of the person at the computer. 

Yes, the food is good...when you get it and if your order is correct. Honestly, that's why we stopped going. Look at how many check-ins I have for this place. We made excuse after excuse for why the side orders were in the wrong meals or they ran out of something, but having to consistently fight to get the right food as the prices kept creeping up got old and we stopped going.

If your family who staffs the restaurant is driving business away, then find people who won't. I am tired of trying to fight to even PLACE an order and give you my money, so my family just isn't going to do it any longer.

I'm sorry, but after a long love affair, we just cannot excuse the incompetence so that we can get catfish cooked with Louisiana Fish Fry mix. We are officially over.

The next new owners should feel free to contact me so that they can learn from the mistakes of the past.",yExLpVbCfVqVixYwzMaeZw,13,1,1,PjGrYqhhgyU7OknMWAq8Rg

Now the bad news, this place is shady at best. They're suppose to have oxtails on Sundays. We went on Sunday and were told they didn't have any. No explanation given. We even went there once to get our kid a hamburger and were told they didn't have any even though they are on the menu. The service is hit or miss because many times we've overhead the servers and cooks loudly yelling at each other which is awkward and unprofessional for us patrons to observe. And just a few days ago we went to get take out only to he told that they were closing early because the cook/owner needed a beer! Huh! Also, we ordered collard greens and instead of simply telling us they were out ( which seems to be happening more and more as of late ) they simply added more mac and cheese without informing us. So, bottom line, if you can catch them, the food is great.

It takes several attempts for them to even pick up the phone...then there is much attitude. You call and are told a pick up time and u still wait at least 15 minutes...and your order is most probably incorrect. If you call to have food catered, they forget you even called..then have an attitude as if it is your fault. They boast about their catering and say they deliver but will probably call you to come pick it up anyway.

There is no staff and wait staff gives you attitude as if you are doing them a favor. Well customers are not doing you a favor. First of all, I have never seen more than one wait person at anytime. Tables are not bussed properly and you have to ask for a drink cup. You are there because we come in. There are too few cooks and they seem overwhelmed every time I have been there.  The last time in was waiting for takeout I waited an hour and they had not even started my order then acted like it was not an issue.

When you think southern food you think of places like this. This brings me back to when I lived in Ten. and s.c. There are thousands of restaurants like this up and down the coastal. 

The order - Po boy' oyster side of mac and cheese, side of coleslaw, and Key lime dessert !.  

Po Boy' was verry good the bread held up very good my concern at first was it was more like a hotdog bun however it taste more like lobster rolls bread. It was nicely toasted and tasted very good. 

Both the side are amazing. I have had coleslaw and mac and cheese done wrong before at places claiming to be "" southern""  that lack flavor. The mac and cheese really great they have a seasoning on it I can't point out either like a old bay seasoning in it or some type of spice like cayenne ? and the coleslaw is mayo based however verry good. 

The key lime was great the crust almost tasted like coconut witch I haven't had it like that since living back in the south. 

My hopes for the restaurant continue adding items to your menu its a very select menu witch is fine to me because you would rather get things done right the first time then not. Deff wanna see cornbread lol.
