My friend had told me that they had good pad thai. So we went and I ordered the chicken pad thai. And when it came...SUPER DISAPPOINTMENT! The portion is good but the taste is just awful! They used too much vinegar or something for the pad thai that made it have a sour vinegar taste to it. GROSS. Service was okay. They constantly stopped by our table refilling our water.

445425,2012-04-05,3,VkECNTcZZ1mdN-VJltJcWA,"I decided on this place because honestly it was the only menu I had at work and I was craving Thai food. After surveying the menu, I decided to try their Shrimp Pad Thai and their stuffed chicken wings. 
I placed the order on the phone and the man who answered the phone was very friendly. He took my delivery order and informed me it would take approximately 45 minutes. He forgot to tell me the price but I didn't think anything of it.
My food was, in fact, delivered in 45 minutes. My biggest issue was with the delivery man. He approached my desk and I immediately asked him, ""Hi, how much?"" so I could pull the funds out of my card. He sarcastically responded, ""Well hello to you too. How are you? I'm fine"". I found this to be really rude and had I been given the price on the phone, I wouldn't need to be asking my question in the first place. It gets worse... After he gives me the total, it ended up being about $22.25. I ended up giving him $26.00 flat and told him to keep the change. He had the audacity to ask me if I had the $.25. Seriously?! I adamantly told him, ""No, I do not"" and I knew exactly why he asked me. He wanted me to give him the $.25 so he could pocket a full four dollars. In my entire life of people delivering me food, I have never been asked to provide the change. Ridiculous...
As for the food, I can't even say that it was out of this world. I'm picky about ordering Pad Thai from a Thai restaurant. It was nothing special. The shrimp in the dish were large and delicious, but the overall flavor was mediocre. The consistency was slightly off and it probably could of used more peanuts to fix this.
The stuffed chicken wings were ok. When I opened the dish, I saw a bunch of cucumbers and vegetables. I had to wrestle my way down to the bottom to get to the chicken wings. The wings were crunchy and the filling of beef and noodles was ok, but slightly bland in taste. I would recommend the put some spices and/or seasonings for the stuffing to give it a little flavor push.
I was going to give this place 1 star mainly based on the the negative experience I had with the delivery man. Who would want this guy representing their establishment with his unprofessional manner? I decided to be more than generous and give one more star based on the friendliness of the man who took my order over the phone and the mediocre food I got. But will I be ordering from here again? Definitely a no.",53hTHxGUy7AC8Oz7BE7-3g,3,3,2,tvZpg8AI-9Ni1vDp3d9v4g

I got the pork larb and half of it is purely fat. Nasty! I went back the next day to see if I could get my money back and they refused. I told them about the fat and they said it's always like that (she opened the container and was squeezing the fatty meat) which is bs, because I have ordered that dish so many times from them in the past. They included the throw away pieces for half of my dish and they wouln't give me my money back, which I think now was around $10 give or take. The woman at the front, whom by the way was clipping her finger nails, said I could get something else. I didn't want the food, but my friend told me to just go ahead and get it and maybe I could give it to someone else, but ended up throwing it away since I didn't want to take the chance on someone getting sick.

659228,2013-01-15,0,VkECNTcZZ1mdN-VJltJcWA,"Came here because the Pho place next door was lifeless.  Watched the Bama-ND BCS game, eye-flirted with a single in the booth across from me, and enjoyed AMAZING Pad Thai in its jungle-like decor.  I almost asked for a second order to take home for the next day.

The noodles were melt-in-your-mouth soft, which contrasted nicely with the fresh bean sprouts and shrimp.  They were also sugary and chow-fun shaped; though personally I liked the effect it might alienate purists or dislikers of msg.

Also not sure if the quick service extends to more than the noodles (easy to keep in a pot).  It was also a slow night for them   Oh, and if you haven't been there, it's worth knowing the exterior isn't very imposing (small place in strip mall).

Will I go back?  If I lived in the neighborhood, I'd probably be a regular.  As it is with their prices though I'll probably just start using sugar in home-made pad thai.  Maybe it'd be fun to take a date or go again to see if that cute single visits...

Pro:
really fast service-- literally under the time it took to wash my hands--
casual atmosphere despite ambitious decor
FRESH food (crisp bean sprouts & shrimp)
Con:
Dinners start @ $10/plate
Noodles sugary (more than other Pad Thai I've had) and soft

Update:  went there a second time.  The green curry is great, and the decor was better than remembered.

1340249,2018-01-04,0,VkECNTcZZ1mdN-VJltJcWA,"This is a nice place for good Thai food. It is located at the University Plaza and it is a further walkway from Vons. The moment you enter, you will see a beautiful layout of the dining area. I do love the earthy nature of rustic wood and rocky walls paired with a shimmery bronze décor. Quite frankly, I think the people here are very friendly and accommodating. I am a patient person and I can understand why sometimes service is delayed, but do keep in mind it does take some time to prepare certain meals. What's most impressive is that the owner Joe not only manages the restaurant, but he also goes above and beyond service to personally deliver take-out meals.

I ordered the Pad Thai Tamarind Sauce with a choice of Chicken ($13.95). I know tamarind sauce can be sweet. In order to balance the sweetness, you will need to add something spicy or sour. They do offer three spicy condiments (red chili sauce, chili pepper flakes, and vinegar with jalapenos) that are set to the side of the table. The meal comes with rice vermicelli noodles sautéed in tamarind sauce, chunks of tender chicken breast, bean sprouts, and served with shredded carrots, red cabbage, crushed peanuts, and cilantro. Of the three spicy condiments, I think the vinegar with jalapenos is the best choice to complement and enhance the flavor of the noodles. From personal experience dining at other Thai restaurants, the Chicken Pad Thai here taste flavorful. The tamarind sauce in my dish didn't taste too sweet, which is a major plus because I usually steer away from anything that has too much sweetness. 

For dessert I had the Mango Sticky Rice ($8). I am pleasantly amazed that the sticky rice comes as a generous portion with plenty slices of sweet, juicy mango. The sticky rice is served warm, it's drizzled with a nice coconut flavored cream sauce and topped with sprinkles of sesame seeds. I've always enjoyed a good meal with dessert, and this dessert is my top favorite! One customer had glanced over and is enticed how yummy and abundant the Mango Sticky Rice is served. It prompt the customer to want an order of that too. It just shows that good food is meant to be shared.",dpvR4LYXr0CYHtHf8BeCKg,1,0,5,p9VwE72l7waYGi2-Bf4n3A

Tom Yum Goong soup had at least a 1/4 cup of VERY large woody lemon grass pieces. I had to pick all of it out it before I could eat the soup. There was a large quartered tomato in the soup(?). Filler??  Broth wasn't very clear and it was a bit oily. There was a generous amount of shrimp. Way, way too many mushrooms though. Nicely spiced though. 

The ""King and I"" signature rice dish lacked pineapple chunks and cashews. The pork was nice, chicken a bit dry. There were only 2 shrimp in the dish and they lacked flavor. The rice was sticky and slightly sweet.  Not anywhere near the quality it used to be. 

Portions for each were smaller and more expensive than what I recall.

It's nice that King and I has other locations :).",j0vDYYFE2eNvjm5NXHFmbA,0,0,4,WBZWdYYytdrvs6ssSpfbcA

I had the lunch special chicken pad thai which came with fried rice, soup, an egg roll, and a small salad. I wasn't a fan of the soup, which was described as a ""chicken noodle"" (rice vermicelli noodles in a chicken stock with a pitiful amount of small chicken chunks in it)- it was very bland, but I didn't show up for the soup so I wasn't concerned with it. The salad was pretty good- I'm pretty sure it was dressed with some sort of sweet chili sauce vinaigrette which was perfect because I used the leftover dressing at the bottom of my bowl of salad to dip my egg roll. The fried rice was typical, pretty tasty in that bland fried rice kind of way (seriously, I really enjoyed it). The pad thai, although not as good as my mom makes, was pretty darn good. The chicken wasn't over done or dry which was a good sign and I didn't have to ask for any lime which is unheard of. 

Chao Thai is down the street, and I think their lunch specials might taste a touch better (at least I can say that for their pad thai), their customer service was severely lacking. I'd rather spend my money here.",lluNN1aQlFN7NQQ2BxFBUQ,0,0,4,b2b7KNBDVxsQTF5Fz5ukrA

Wandered in for dinner about 9pm and very nice looking employee steered me towards the Singapore Noodles and I substituted chicken for BBQ Pork. This dish is an acquired taste because you have to like yellow curry for it to be effective. THe shrimp and chicken in the dish were both above average with the shrimp stealing the show. The curry flavor wasn't as strong as in some other places which is a good thing and overall the dish was a pretty good rendition of the standard with better meat. It would be better for under $10 which is what most places (especially around UNLV) should be charging. Probably worth another visit though.",ELcQDlf69kb-ihJfxZyL0A,0,0,4,AWYwDBvorJjilSag1YVTnA

Their service is kind of slow, maybe 2 chefs working and 2 waitresses but that's about all. Some of their meals are too sweet or really salty. I was only looking for a place away from the strip since all of their restaurants sucked. The Thai Tea was really sweet you can taste the powder and the boba along with it, and it was ok.

Compared to the other Thai place I always eat to in OC, this place was okay, it didn't meet my standards but it's was also kind of expensive. Total cost was around $70 but the groupon covered more than half so it came out to be $30.

I would just recommend the Tom Yum Soup and Fried Rice, the soup can be salty but adding a little lemon would make it better. If the food was somewhat better, because I do feel bad that they're understaff and trying to make meet ends with the restaurant as well.

Food is inconsistent, ranging from average to poor.  Usually get the Pad Thai with Chicken, quality has dropped over time.  Chicken has become rubbery and unsavory, color of noodles have gotten strangely more orange over time - an unnatural color that looks more like food coloring than any kind of legitimate ingredient in the dish.

I have always had the feeling that this place in not terribly clean (sticky tables, rattan placemats that appear to never really be cleaned) and it has just gotten worse over time.

Service is very inconsistent - in the same party, arrival of entrees can be staggered by 20-30 min over lunch - not workable when out for lunch with a group during a work lunch hour.

Many other good thai places existing in Las Vegas - in my opinion, this one is not among them, and one should look to other options for thai food.",Oixv0VgElz8pxQFp2lkdJg,0,0,2,xsJM2w4bvYlzWcLvipqlSg

I frequent this place for the lunch special ($6 for main dish, egg roll, salad, and soup - the drink is now separate) and for that price it is so worth it!  They do seem to do the heat level ""American style"" (that is, a 2 out of 5 won't kill the sensitive palettes like at some joints that may be more authentic).  My experiences with the curries are that they are quite flavorful, and they come with an assortment of veggies mixed in with the meat which I appreciate.  I've never had the pad Thai that several folks complained about, so it sounds like the curries are the way to go.  I'll stick with my standard.  Their panang curry is a bit too peanutty for me, the yellow a bit too mellow, but the red curry is just right blend of flavor and heat to brighten my day.  service is generally quick and polite, and lunch size servings are generous (you won't leave hungry).  I would kill for the tom kha soup when I'm in the mood (not on the lunch special, but sometimes you need to deviate for a craving).

WRONG.

I ordered the crispy duck and it was soooooo freakin' dry. The flavor was there... but it'd be like ordering a succulent roast duck in the window of your favorite chinese restaurant- and then leaving outside in the sun for 2 days, then serving it on a plate here at this restaurant.

We also ordered a chicken dish with a coconut curry. The sauce was good, but again... the chicken was over cooked and dry! That's AFTER having been smothered in sauce! Good god!

My waitress didn't understand my question when I asked her to ""please describe the crispy duck to me?"" Well... actually, she understood me but she was so sincere and smiled, ""it's a duck. It's crispy. It has a sauce on the side.""

 We started of with thai pork jerky. It was delicious paired with the waterfall dipping sauce but lacked the sticky rice which is normally paired with this appetizer. I had their traditional pad Thai. It was delicious and a slight spice. As we know i love spice. Chicken Tom Ka was so delicious especially most places have a hard time balancing the lemon grass I the dish but was a nice balance.

Imagine a small ski lodge or cabin. Now add some Thai trimmings. Okay, now wedge it between a mobile store and a laundromat and there you have the King & I, in the University Plaza (same as Vons). Whowuddathunk this place would have such a nice interior, considering its slightly seedy location? Probably just the college kids. 

Whenever the bf and I have a hankering for Thai food around campus and don't feel like driving very far, we like to stop in here. It's been recently overtaken by new management, which has both its pros and cons --

Pros: perceptibly friendlier staff, new plateware and mason jars, cracks finally sealed up in the stone paneling so that bugs won't come out to play unexpectedly.

Cons: somewhat smaller portions, food's pretty average, no more 10% student discounts (but you do get a free drink if you check into Yelp per their table signs)

Our most recent dinner visit, we ordered the chicken yellow curry with two sides of rice. Our waitress informed us that rice was already included and that she'd happily refill for us. When it came out, she gave us a big bowl so that was nice. If you're on a tight budget, but still want to go out for hole-in-the-wall Thai food without sacrificing ambiance, King & I definitely delivers.

I actually walked into the pizza joint next door on accident because the place is so well hidden. You really have to pay attention to the signs on the doors. 

Once I got in, I enjoyed the ambiance of the place. It had a dark and relaxing feel to it with all the booths setup. They also had some nice authentic Thai decor hanging from the walls. I was quickly seated, and presented with the lunch special menu. Of course, I had to order the Chicken Pad Thai, and surprisingly they also had a Chinese menu was well. So I went ahead and ordered a Kung Pao Chicken.

The food arrived quickly and I did enjoy the taste of my pad thai. It had a good sweet taste to it, but the chicken was a bit on the dry end. I did like the egg roll with the sweet sauce as well. The rice had an original taste to it. It was like something you would get out of this country.  I also tasted the Kung Pao and I realized that it tasted exactly the same as the chicken on the Pad Thai. I am guessing they just prepare the chicken ahead of time and mix it whatever that is ordered. 

 My food wasn't spectacular, but I thought for the price it was a great deal. Two lunch combos came out to be about $15 without drinks. Definitely a good little surprise indeed.  Come here if you are not expecting too much, but a full stomach.",nTcMFBHZV2vPnig0XLk-Hw,0,0,3,oMbYjoh1GYYhvO8FLc1XQA

I had about 3 big sized shrimps in my Pad Thai, that may sound like a few pieces, but it was the whole shrimp, not shrimp that is all chopped up to say you had shrimp on your plate, and I like to portion out my meat with my fork full of carbs, and it matched up decently.

I don't eat chicken beef ect only sea food and I made sure to clarify with the person I spoke with on the phone that I didn't want any other type of meat in the noodles and he assured me there would not be. So i called and verified I ordered the correct thing and he said he would have the delivery driver come and get my phone then they would replace it. I found that odd because usually they bring a replacement then take it at that time but I said ok and the driver showed up took my food then returned back to the establishment. About 20 minutes goes by (keep in mind my apartment is RIGHT across the street) I get a call from the establishment saying ""what did you order...?"" I said ""I ordered Pad See Wea with shrimp and some fried rice"" he said ""well thats what I gave you why couldn't you just pick out the few pieces of chicken"" when he said that I got upset and explained that I don't eat any type of meat except sea food and that he reassured me there was only shrimp. I said then if he was unable to meet my request I would like a refund for the noodles only as I had paid for everything already. Once I did that he starting cursing at me and saying I cant have my money back and how Americans have no respect for good food. I obviously hung up and wrote this review he was absurd and I could not believe I was spoken to like that.

At the end of the meal, it was so-so.  The service was good and friendly.  They have lunch specials so my friend ordered Panang Curry, and I ordered Red Curry.  They seemed to taste the exact same to me.  In addition, the lunch special comes with a salad, a side of rice, an egg roll, and...two tortilla chips?  The salad was simply some iceberg lettuce with a not-so-appetizing dressing.  The egg roll is tiny and tastes like something you'd buy in the frozen section and microwave at home - all wrap with a little cabbage and carrot inside.

The first impression of this place was good, it had nice decor and seemed like a very good menu. The Pad Thai is the only good thing I've ever tried here though, the curry is too watery, the tofu too over fried, and there's more onions than anything in the vegetable dishes. One time our rice was even burnt to crunchiness, ew.

While that put me off in all of itself, the tipping edge of never returning here is the rude server we seem to always get. Most of the waitresses are nice, but there's always this one waitress(maybe waiter, she sounds like a man) that is rude as all hell when we visited here. She's not friendly to the customers, and slams food and glasses around. Like shit dude, if you don't like your job go get another one and quit making everyone else miserable.

Ordered the Pad Kee Mao, asking for 10/10 very spicy....no other way to eat Thai food IMO!  They said they only rank 4/4, so I already knew it wasn't going to be hot lol.  Like what is the difference between a 3 and a 4 spice level?  Fairly spicy to mouth scorching?  LOL anyways...

Popped open the top, and I could tell it wasn't going to be very spicy.  I didn't see any hot peppers in there....only bell peppers.  They probably add a little chili pepper to the dish, but it is not fresh like from the peppers themselves....you can tell where the heat comes from.  Another thing jumped out and screamed at me...is that Chinese BBQ Pork?  It even has that fake red searing on it....bummer.

Sure enough, it wasn't very hot, I'd rate my 4/4 as a 5/10 in the more authentic Thai spots in town.

After tearing the plastic bag open, flipped open the container filled with Pad Thai, spring rolls, fried rice and just dug right in to it.  Needless to say, I was so disappointed.

5941942,2011-02-26,2,VkECNTcZZ1mdN-VJltJcWA,"I've been noticing a lot of not so great reviews for this place.  My guess is that a lot of ""farangs"" (that's foreigners to you non-Thais out there in Yelpville) need something to complain about.  Either that or these are the same farangs that consider a chain like Thai Spice to be authentic Thai.

With that being said,  my family's experience with this establishment was awesome.  The service was very good and the waitress was impressed that I actually knew the Thai phrase for the spice tray.  Khrueng Phuang which to you ingrit speaking farangs means Ring of Spices.  Even though sugar was not part of their Khrueng Phuang, it did not dampen my impression of the culinary wonders that they lay before us.

Their chicken satay were pretty thick slices of meat and almost done like Chinese BBQ.  Although unlike many farang reviewers of Thai establishments on this site, a satay or a Pad Thai does not necessarily make a Thai restaurant bad.  The Pad Thai was medium, at the request of my farang company,  but that's what Krueng Phuang is for.  Spice it up ho you like it if its too mild.  If you need some pointers on how to utilize or even request Krueng Phuang,  invite me along to your next Thai meal and I will be happy to teach you.  

Usually I don't order Pad Thai at restaurants since contrary to popular belief,  it is not the national dish of Thailand. For the record, it's Tom Yum Kung (Spicy Soup with Shrimp) Pad Si Yu and Rad Na are much better noodle dishes and we had the latter with pork.  Gravy had a nice consistency and they used the Sen Yai (wide to you farangs) noodles as opposed to the Sen Lek (narrow).  The Tod Mun was nice and thick unlike some of the flat pancake ones I have ahd at other Thai restaurants.  The Panang Curry a nice peanutty flavor and was spiced just right.

Overall, I will come back here again when I come back to Vegas.  Some farangs need to mellow out and just enjoy their meal.  As someone who is Thai,  I had some real bad Thai food (Thai Spice) in my day.  This place is one of the better places that I would bring my  mother to.  For the record, she is a native of the province of Petchabun.",mEqg50upk0_pNakd4r-w4A,4,2,5,8Q0UjNLQcB8UwlRruQlZHQ

The exterior is a little sketchy looking since it's in a run-down supermarket parking lot, but they've done an amazing job with the quirky decor once you're inside and I've always had great service.

The reviews seem to be a bit polarized, which is surprising. I've been here countless times and brought others and never had a bad experience. Their curries are not as sweet as some of the Thai restaurants that cater to American preferences, so it may be a matter of taste.",Nlca9A8luy1Y8C2GRG4Wgg,2,0,5,OZZvpwC830LIB11VGpBnuw

-Portions for both items were about half of what they used to be for the same price.
-The pad si ew was too salty
-The fried rice was a bit bland. 

I really did enjoy getting food here. I dont know if I'll be coming back... :(",2fFux5Q24vONze6nuBqPTQ,1,0,2,D505PPK1fQssEpVqlIXvkA

The cost is good for the serving size is great.  The flavors are on point and feels very traditional.  I am no way an expert on Tai food, however, this food was great.  I had heat a 9 and thought it needs to be hotter at first.  Of course later during the meal I was not thinking that.  Was just right.  Going to go back and get the 10.  Just hope they are not bringing the heat down because I am not Tai.  Highly suggest this place.  Came here with co workers and they all thought the same.  Great flavors, enjoyed the decor, price was fair.",_ap5Bxd88r7Qj-xgsDeXNA,0,0,5,Xyo6n3qHXc_o2PB6z50m_w

It's a small family place, food is picked up at the front. Now the most important thing... the food! It was amazing! Yellow curry sooo good, fried rice amazing. The smoothies are especially delicious. Had a coconut and mango one, both awesome. Originally ordered a cantaloupe one but the restaurant called me right away advising they were out. I changed it to mango, and wasn't disappointing. Portions are great. Got full without appetizers. I think I just found my new fav Thai place!",S9wKc6osMZ0IcaG_mdUm3g,0,0,5,dAwbkGQBQuLbxjaBBTTILw
