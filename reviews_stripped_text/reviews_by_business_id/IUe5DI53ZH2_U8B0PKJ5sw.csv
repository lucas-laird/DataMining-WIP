91393,2017-06-08,0,IUe5DI53ZH2_U8B0PKJ5sw,"I am not a big fan of thin pancake versions known as crepes. I've had a few of them in the past only to move on and continue with my way of thinking that there is nothing great to them. 

However, my perspective took a turn for the best when I ordered a cheese cake red velvet crepe from this place. I mean, talk about delicacy and deliciousness. This crepe came out looking like a work of art and when my sense of taste got a piece of it I was in paradise. With a side of milk this made for the best meal I've had in the whole day and by far the most exquisite crepe I've had up until then. If you like crepes and want to now have a love and passion for them, visit this place and you'll fall in love all over again.",aT9nUrNXniWFS4FGB8y_yw,5,3,5,O76qf_UlVmS40ehzI5D6Tw

My friends and I ordered 2 Nutella crepes, a Hershey crepe, piña colada smoothie, a vanilla latte, and vanilla frappe. All of us had the same opinion that the crepes were delicious! They were generous with the choice of fruits :)   Friend A liked her piña colada and friend B liked that her vanilla frappe wasn't overly sweet. I KIND OF liked my vanilla latte because it was a bit too sweet, I didn't finish it.

As for the service, they were friendly! And the place was definitely clean and welcoming :) Kind of wish they would use ceramic white plates and silverware because it doesn't feel like the plastic black plates and utensils go with the vibe of the store.

I will be coming back to try their other menu items ;)",SLEYJP3AOdJonr9v-w2ewA,1,0,4,sekADZdjzxrHb-8JM9ew9Q

It's clean and fresh on the inside but it's very hot and it can take people forever to put in their order. It's also pretty crowded and there are quite a few children running around as their parents pay no attention to the PERMANENT sign asking them not to allow this. (must be a chronic problem) As I write this, a mother is allowing her child to drag his chair on the concrete and slam it against the back of my chair while she's half heartedly asking him to ""sientate"". 

If you'd like to hang out and eat your dessert, there is music playing at a tolerable level and you may watch them make your crepes as you wait. 

The fact that the crepes are good and that I can order this via Uber eats would probably be be the only way I'd spend money here again. I'm not going to dock stars for patron behavior.",INHFOcLzPBFAEO9QHbQ6Pw,7,0,4,JvRNjC1OW4CvdqxtuEB4cg

My crepe was very dry, neither my husband or I could taste the pesto, and the chicken was canned.  It came with a salad, which was the star of the meal. My husbands fruit was canned (strawberries, and peaches) huge disappointment since it's the summer time, where fresh fruit is in season.  I ordered a gluten free crepe, and 10 minutes later they informed me that they were out of the gluten batter (thankfully he returned the extra dollar free, without incident).

My husband ordered the salami crepe and enjoyed it as well. It comes with soup. His soup was so yummy, I couldn't stop eating it. I ended up eating the whole bowl for him. :) 
The only thing I would change is the experience itself. It is not inviting and warm. Has a cafeteria feel to it and the music is Mexican pop music. It's just not a comfy environment.
Oh, and one other thing to expect, these crepes are not the kind you get in France. They are not as eggy and thin. They are more like very thin pancakes.",6tTozXK0cuo9xUfD91_jcg,0,0,4,cJobKyQybzOwwMnOiLxDkw

I had the veggie crepe and my Partner had the chicken pesto crepe. They come with a salad or chips, but for $1 more, you can have soup. Partner chose the salad, and I, the soup.

They were super yummy. Fresh and filling, yet light on the tummy. The tomato basil soup was topped with small croutons and fresh shreds of parmesan. It was a perfect compliment to my veggie crepe.

After dinner fare, we decided to be gluttons and went all-in by ordering a Red Velvet Nutella crepe w/bananas & strawberries and a Red Velvet Cream Cheese Crepe w/mangoes and a berry compote (not overly sweet).

Each crepe was filled with the fruit inside and also topped with more fruity goodness. Paired with a latte, it was a perfect end to a refreshing Friday night meal out.

The place is so bright and airy when you walk inside. There are so many tables and chairs, you don't feel like you have to have someone save a seat. I like that the walls were red and it just felt happy. When we were in, they were also playing old school cartoons. If that doesn't make you happy already, I don't know what will. They have menus on the side of the wall when you go up to order, it is on the side so you have to tilt your head a little. I saw they did have savory crepes, but my husband and I usually like the sweet crepes more.

We ordered the nutella crepe with bananas and strawberries along side vanilla ice cream. We decided to drink arizona tea. All under $10 ! What a steal and a quick sweet tooth fix. You also don't have to purchase water, because they have a complimentary water dispenser, with lemons inside. It was a nice touch.

The crepe was delicious. It was stuffed with bananas and strawberries. You can also choose your types of fruit if you want, you are not limited to what type of fruit you want! They do have the fruit options on the menu. The crepe was soft and chewy and it had the right amount of bite like any crepe should have. I liked that the vanilla ice cream was on the side and it wasn't melting next to the crepe.

I love a basic Nutella crepe with strawberry and banana! If I'm feeling a lil adventurous, I'll add a scoop of ice cream. The crepes are delicious! Thin, but still has bite. They're not stingy with the toppings either. The only thing I don't like about my crepes is that most of the time, the fruit is very, very sour. Some people may not mind, but me personally, I like my fruit ripe and sweet.
My boyfriend loves their strawberry milk shakes. It's very creamy and tastes like Nestlé strawberry milk! 
I also really love how they have self serve water.

This place is clean, and the staff is friendly. As for the crepes, the texture is not too eggy, and the flavor is slightly sweet. Plus, the prices are totally reasonable for the huge portions you get.

As for the toppings, they're super generous, and any place that indulges in my extra, extra whipped cream requests is always a win in my book. I do also like that they use fresh strawberries and bananas. However, I wish they also used fresh whipped cream. It's canned, so overall, the quality is just standard right now.

As for other things that had room for improvement, the servings are monster size. Like big enough to be a meal on its own, with generous heaps of toppings. If that's your thing, you're going to love this place, but personally, I wish the ratio was better so I could have every bite with enough delicious crepe to go around. If you plan on coming here for dessert, plan on bringing a friend to share.

Overall, it's not the best crepes I've ever had, but they're definitely good and you'll struggle to find a better place in this neighborhood that'll satisfy your crepe cravings like Crepe Station.",ZIqkcApOQh8QfiydYSiLaQ,9,4,4,B9V8DKis_8qXwXDDEOZUgA
