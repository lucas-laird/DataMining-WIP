1188042,2018-05-03,1,L-IyrAwnrg9A2yW7zPI_UA,"The husband and I were in the mood to eat out for breakfast and decided to try this place out after dropping the kiddies off at school.  Located in the Target center off of the 95 and Cheyenne, it was pretty easy to find the restaurant.  The restaurant itself is small but pretty spacious with several tables and bar area.  I especially love the chalkboard sign behind the bar stating their house specials.  I thought it was very cute.

One thing that did stand out about this place is that they offer loyalty cards.  This is the first I've seen where they offer a loyalty card for meals.  I normally see stamp cards for boba or coffee shops, never for meals.  But their loyalty card gives you $10 off your tenth meal.  So that's pretty much or almost a free meal, which is great if you are a regular here.

Now for the food, I can't really say there was a wow factor for us.  It's pretty much your average breakfast spot.  However, like others have stated, their portions are pretty big.  I decided to get the Cali omelette and there was just way too much cheese for my liking.  I also thought their pancakes were a bit on the chewy side.  The husband's lovers breakfast pretty much included everything.  So if you have a big appetite, I would recommend that.  But did we enjoy our meals?  It wasn't bad, but like I said, nothing really stood out for us in regards to the food.  Its definitely an option for breakfast though if you're in the area.",A36BF-rIbGExgnu1StJJiA,5,3,3,QIZfWKses9W8gEGPprKkyg

Pros: large portions, clean restaurant, friendly staff

Cons:  Never enough employees.  There's one cook and both times there was only one waitress.  She appeared to be new and didn't know the menu too well when questions were asked.  The food took awhile to get to our table, and both times my order was wrong.  My friends ordered toast and fruit as sides; the toast was forgotten & potatoes were given instead of fruit.  When my friend asked for iced tea to go, the waitress gave him hot tea.  It took forever for the waitress to ring us up.  Omelets are priced between $9.99-$13.99.  My bill with the meal, coffee and tip came up to $19, which is a little expensive in my opinion for breakfast.",H2PcFJ2tswZLKY4tadK6_Q,9,0,2,QvwikokTBPqotySujk8poQ

1621900,2018-03-18,0,L-IyrAwnrg9A2yW7zPI_UA,"My review is from my experience this morning now this could be because they just opened up so they are probably getting in the rhythm of things. But it was a little chaotic it was a busy morning. when we walked in, there were a few dirty tables. When we were sat down it took a while for the waitress to come to our table. We ordered our food but we were never asked if we wanted water. While waiting for my food I did observe a few things, the roles that each person that works there didn't seem to be clear. The girl behind the counter which I assume should be your hostess was bussing and when she was taking  the tray to the back she was trying to hand it to a young kid who said to her ""that's your job"". Your customers should not be witnessing employees disputing their job duties. The table behind us was waiting a long time and we received our food before them. The food was good my husband ordered the Fresh toast full plate and I ordered the 2 Pancakes with 2 eggs, 1 sausage the waitress brings one little cup of syrup and 1 little cup of butter for 2 orders that clearly require more than one little cup I had to ask for my side of syrup and butter. To their defense they did have a party of 12 that probably through them off their game. We probably go back and try them again since second chances are always good.",39GNj-qiHPpDAXQ4gyvO4g,0,0,3,jAhRYt3yHQ3IaHPMazUaNg

The food is pretty affordable. The plates are about $12. The best thing we ordered was the western burger (name?) it was juicy and flavorful. Everything else just tasted like basic diner food.

The customer service here is lack luster. I understand that they are understaffed (that's what it looked like), but If the food isn't going to stand out then the least that they could do is make sure that the drinks are refilled, that the table has straws, and that we don't have to ask for basic customer service. 

I'll be back but I hope the service improves. 

... UPDATE...: 
I was contacted by the owner to come back in and review the place again. This time the customer service was great, but I think it's mainly because they were focused on trying to change my perspective on the restaurant. One thing I can say is that the food was so good this time. This place has better dinner food than breakfast food. We tried the Pasta Mia and we were impressed by how balanced the flavors were.

3812636,2018-06-09,0,L-IyrAwnrg9A2yW7zPI_UA,"Oh, man where do I begin?  I really wanted to like this place.  The photos of the food makes it look so good.  Well, the coffee was fantastic. However, I question the freshness of the food. 

I ordered an omelet with Swiss cheese, which I get everywhere I go. That's my standard in which I measure a new breakfast place.  My omelet was so hot. Burn my mouth let it cool down hot.  Which is strange because in comparison my homefries were barely warm and were a little mushy. The Swiss cheese was rubbery and not melted which means 1.  It is old cheese. 2. It has been exposed to air which means not properly stored. Or 3. Inferior quality product. I could not chew it.  My omelet had barely any discernible cheese inside it. My omelet was also greenish/grey in color, which is harmless but indicates OLD EGGS.  I was charged a dollar for soupy sour cream. Also an indication of freshness. And I think a dollar for a small ramekin of sour cream is excessive. I can go to Walmart and buy a  6 oz. container of fresh sour cream for the same price.  My sour dough toast was fine but they serve margarine which is disgusting. 

Maybe they don't use food up fast enough.  I was there at 1pm.  Only one other couple was there. There were crumbs on the chair next to my table. The booth bench was littered with crumbs. This place is not inviting.  It's white and shades of lime green sherbet but still manages to be dark and cavernous. There is one string of lights and that's it for lighting. I mean I could read but it wasn't bright and cheery. There is not art on the walls. When you walk in you wonder if it's actually open.

The service was good.  I asked for water and the server put it so far out of my reach I almost had to get up to get my water. I am not a tyrannosaurus with little arms. . My server and the other server AND another person, owner, manager??? Asked how everything was.  I said it was fine. I was also asked again by the manager who had literally asked me the same question five minutes earlier when I was cashing out.  I said it was fine. It wasn't. I wasn't looking for a free meal and I wasn't interested in having it remade and giving them a chance to ""fix"" the problem.  What were they going to do?  Make my omelet over with the same old cheese and old eggs? Find fresher sour cream? They should have made my food with fresh ingredients in the first place.  It wasn't any less expensive or more expensive than other places with much better food. 

I won't be coming here again. I don't trust it.",ElUiVmEMoQgyWcnYeR560w,2,0,2,ry8X42CoRS01tw_BSS15vQ

5924300,2018-04-07,1,L-IyrAwnrg9A2yW7zPI_UA,"There is nothing stand-out about this place either way. The food is decent (we had omelets, one with home potatoes and one with hash browns); nothing super exciting. The omelets are pretty big, so you get a decent amount for the money.

The place isn't that big, and was about 2/3 full when we went, and there were 6-7 servers/runners. You might think that would speed up operations, but it seemed to slow things down. We sat near the kitchen pass-through and were privy to all of the confusion. Although unorganized, everyone was nice.

My Cali Mix omelet was supposed to come with avocado, jack cheese, and sausage. I was staring at it weird because I didn't see any avocado. An attentive server noticed my look and came to ask if everything was ok. When I said I thought it was supposed to come with avocado, she said no. I said I was pretty sure the menu said it did (also, it has ""Cali"" in the title, which nearly guarantees it). She went to check and brought me back a side of avocado and apologized. We didn't notice until the end of our meal that my partner never received the rye toast that was to come on the side of his, but we didn't really care as he wasn't necessarily looking forward to a side of toast, and he barely finished half of his omelet as it was (and he can usually finish most meals easily, so that shows you how big those omelets actually are).

Overall, I probably wouldn't ever go back here when I have other better options close by. It wasn't the worst breakfast experience I've ever had, though, by far.",g1YLVOwquTJ5ILeWIwqW9Q,4,0,3,xTbyeiPmcMeRuecJ8J_Xcw
