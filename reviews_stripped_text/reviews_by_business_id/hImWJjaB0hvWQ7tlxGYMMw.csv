I spoke with Eric (assistant manager) then I spoke with Cherry (The Store Manager) they stated that if I needed to complain to someone else about this then they have no one for me. At first Cherry did not even want to come out, as the store manager she should feel more responsible for her staff and for the quality of the food, instead she seemed less sympathetic for my wait or quality of food than the other employees. -- Maybe it's fault for thinking this place would provide quality....

267425,2017-02-18,0,hImWJjaB0hvWQ7tlxGYMMw,"On 2/12/2017 I ordered a large pan pizza with five toppings and a personal pizza with four toppings.  I requested delivery service and applied a $10 coupon.  The total was $17.xx after taxes.  Good deal!

Five minutes after submitting my order online, a Pizza Hut employee called to tell me that they were out of personal pan crusts and recommended a medium size pizza with the same toppings for $11.00 more.  

I was not provided a revised receipt, but the grand total was quoted at $28.xx and I agreed to it.

The delivery employee showed up shortly afterwards and the total on the receipt was $28.xx.  I clearly entered ""$0.00"" on the tip line and signed the receipt.  The driver took both copies of the receipt (with a $5.00 CASH tip) and then gave me my pizzas.

I check my bank account a few days later and noticed that the total was final at $32.xx.  THE DRIVER GAVE HIMSELF AN ADDITIONAL TIP ON TOP OF THE $5.00 CASH TIP I GAVE HIM!  

This has never happened before in the two years that I've ordered from here, but it isn't going to happen again.  I'm never ordering from THIS Pizza Hut ever again.  

Remember in the beginning when I mentioned that my original total was with a $10.00 coupon applied?  Let's say I didn't use the coupon...  $38.00 PLUS TIP for one large pizza with five toppings and a medium with four toppings?!  Really?!  Unbelievable.

The crust was its nice buttery flavor and fluffy again. The toppings were generous and fresh. Only complaint would be there was too much sauce this time and the cheese wasn't quite cooked enough. Seemed a little underdone. However compared to last time this was boat loads better.

They have a special right now, $10 for any size pizza with any toppings, so I ordered a large pizza with half pepperoni and half mushrooms, peppers, sausage, and onions. The 8 wings I got were an extra $6.99. The total came out to about $21 because the delivery fee is $2.50 and it specifically states, ""This does not include the deliverer's tip."" I placed my order at 6:20pm and the expected delivery time was 7:02pm, but it didn't come until 7:14pm, which was a very long wait for what I ordered. If I knew it was going to take that long before placing my order, I would've just ran down to Little Caesar's to get some Hot-N-Ready pizzas. Nonetheless, the pizza and wings were decent and the delivery lady was nice. If she didn't give me free dipping sauces I probably would've given this location 2 stars.",AuvaQaRHBowFaFtoEMqkVg,5,4,3,iQaSCrTIx9UCVFUGoER5Ww

In my opinion there are few things which can top a stuffed crust pizza.  Normally I don't even eat the crust, but having the unique cheese filled crust is something I really look forward to.

I ordered using the online feature and requested extra sauce (I wouldn't have even thought to ask if it wasn't on the site).  The advantage to online is no need for coupon clipping as they have many online specials.

Pizza Hut is a definite ""go to"" when it comes to my at home movie nights!",M-xJMhi-HphpWaD2992K3A,0,0,4,pMewUrUaZSIRk_DhtqcUCA

1. Ordered online, arrived at store and paid, proceeded to wait, front desk clerk went in back, came back and took orders and gave out pizzas to people behind me according to the order chart, asked, repeated whole process, about 20 min later told me they never even made my pizzas!!!

2. Delivered to house last week, delivery guy didn't have any change...nothing!!! Might be a tactic these guys utilize to make sure the tip is larger. Regardless, didn't feel like messing with paying with credit so just left with a large tip....but also in turn left with never getting my business again

I know this PizzaHut hasn't gone out of business because I live 2 blocks away from it and yet surprisingly the phone number isn't listed anywhere.  This is the one on Buffalo and Blue Diamond Rd.

I just decided to go drive there instead of making a phone order and asked why they aren't listed on the internet and they said its not the first they've been asked about this.  They have no answer to why but it didn't matter and I just wasted my time because they don't even deliver, haha. 

With that aside, the lady that was serving me was very friendly and gave me a fridge magnet with the phone number on it.  I don't usually go to pizzahut to buy pizza but decided to add it on with my orders of 44 piece wings since a large with 3 toppings was only $10 and the wings were $25 for 44 piece. Very good deal.

Maybe it's just me but I regret ordering the hottest flavor for the wings because I freaking couldn't handle it.  Wings were good though but just too hot for my taste so my lil' 15yr old bratty brother showed me up by eating all of it. I'd def come here for the wings but as far as pizzas goes, damn it tasted like a $10 large pizza.  I ordered the hawaiin toppings which was pineapple, sausage, with pepperoni.  The taste was very bland and nothing, even a tad bit to tickle my taste bud. But thats what I get for being cheap that day instead of going to my fav local joint, Familia Pizzeria.
