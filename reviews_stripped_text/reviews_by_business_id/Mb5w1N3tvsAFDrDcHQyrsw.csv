18073,2016-11-21,1,Mb5w1N3tvsAFDrDcHQyrsw,"Warning!!! Safety and health issue!! After ordering a regular Chicken Philly Steak and a small Chicken Philly and fries at the cashier. We watched the chicken and veggies being grilled by the cook and then suddenly saw him took out a chunk of white plastic from the chicken and veggies. He was showing it to his colleagues and telling them about it. He knew I saw what he did & and I thought he will throw the chicken and veggies away, but for some reason he did not throw away the contaminated chicken and veggies and continued cooking it. At this point I was watching closely and made sure that he will not serve that to us. However, he did try to serve it to us and  I told him that I will not take it, because it was cooked with plastic. I asked him to cook me a new one. I can not believe that he has the audacity to serve it. Especially,  he knew that I saw what happened. He did not apologize and said anything about it. 
 I asked for the manager but he was not available and I was informed that the cook was the supervisor in charge at that time. Since, he was busy cooking he sent another team leader Arlyn and told me that she is also acting as a supervisor. So, I told her what happened and I want the manager to know about it,  because it was a health and safety issue. It was something serious that it needs to be addressed. She got my cell phone number,  so the manager will call me after 1 hour.  Gave them 3 hours to call me before writing this review to give them a chance, but I think the cook/supervisor and Arlyn team leader either forgot or didn't tell the manager about it. So,  I just want to warn people to watch the cook while grilling your food. He doesn't know the health and food safety regulations. Cooking your food with plastic is not a healthy and safe!!!!",ofdWLNz6aP2KuVmObJfu_Q,1,1,1,y18cpXoau29WhG9Rht0tzA

Downside is that they can't package to go, but their pricing is surprisingly reasonable for the captive audience inside of a mall. Their $5 deal for a small chicken philly and fries is an ample portion of food, but you'll probably want to upgrade to their gourmet fries.

2962253,2018-01-02,0,Mb5w1N3tvsAFDrDcHQyrsw,"Let me start by saying that I HATE food courts.  The people, the germs, the lack of seating, the lack of options, the noise.  Oy - I could go on and on.  But I needed lunch after some serious post-Christmas shopping.  And I gotta say - the food court at the Meadows Mall aint too shabby.  
I went with Charley's mainly cause they're at the end of the court so there was plenty of seating around there and there was no line.  My expectations were low but I was surprised at the quality, freshness and taste of my lunch. 
Playing it safe, I went with a small regular philly sub.  I omitted the lettuce, tomato and pickles (I've never heard of a philly with all that on it - is that weird or is it just me?).  I also had them hold the mushrooms cause, yeah - I don't eat fungus.  
All the food is made to order and it tastes that way.  The sandwich itself was on a soft bun that was lightly toasted and the meat and veggies were cooked right in front of me - extra points for transparency.  They give you a generous amount of meat, veggies and cheese and although I got a small, I couldn't finish the entire thing myself.  Cue the hubby for leftover patrol.  We also got the gourmet fries which are essentially fries with cheese sauce, bacon bits and ranch on them.  Do yourself a favor and just get plain fries.  They stand up by themselves and you don't need all that extra junk on them.  
The menu offers all sorts of philly options but being the simple gal that I am, I thoroughly enjoyed the traditional philly.  We paid a little over $20 for my small philly, hubby's medium philly, a shared gourmet fries and 2 drinks.  It's not dollar menu pricing but it's worth it.  If you've worked up an appetite at the Meadows Mall, give Charley's a whirl.",vpvW58vXP9xuOsWg-OCFxg,1,0,4,D6j133Me7OE0XqrtEWKC5A

My favorite is the chicken cheese steak. This was the worst cheese steak in general I've ever had. There was only one person working the register and cooking.......

And only one order ahead of mine....

My two cheese steaks were done 10 minutes before my fries....how?!

My cheese was not melted at all. My bun was not warm at all. The peppers were cold, it's like they were thrown on there cold and not cooked on the grill...

Just overall a confusing and bad experience. Shoulda saved my $22 and went else where in the food court. That's $22 without a drink by the way.",ugpGI6jgFq_gDyaGBn1Cmw,3,1,2,XC706aYvJ4HKjk-nGREx2A

As I walk in the food court of the Meadows Mall, I am sad to see all the changes. That is what happens with time, but I don't like change much and only seeing 2 of the same places (chains of course) still there is just a shame. There used to be more locally owned family businesses in the food court. 

Hubby was off to eat at Johnny Rocket's so I decided to give this new cheesesteak (cashier says they have been open a few months) place that took the spot of GS&F out. I ordered the ""Philly Cheesesteak"" priced at $6.79 and $3.99 to add cheese fries and a drink. The cheesesteak had on it steak, grilled onions, bell peppers, mushrooms and american cheese. They have a variety if fresh toppings, so I decided to go all out west coast on this cheesesteak! I had lettuce (ended up removing most of it), tomato and mayo added. The only thing missing was some fresh avocado! I enjoyed the cheesesteak. The cheese fries were actually good, but the total price being around $12 seems steep when I can get a bigger cheesesteak and fries for a little less just down the street at Pop's. I liked the food, but wouldn't eat here again unless I had a coupon and I would have to already be shopping at the mall. The cashier mentioned signing up for the e-club to get coupons and deals.

4063483,2017-09-05,7,Mb5w1N3tvsAFDrDcHQyrsw,"Located in the food court of the Meadows Mall on the upper level. 

This experience was kind of a disappointment! Having eaten at other Charley's Philly Steaks before, I had high hopes that this location would be as good as previous locations I had been to before. Came during lunch hour and since I didn't have a lot of time to wait for food, I decided to come here as there was only one other person in line ahead of me. 

After looking at the menu, I decided on getting my go-to sandwich the Veggie Delight. Made of grilled mushrooms, onions, green bell peppers, Provolone, Swiss & White American cheeses, lettuce and tomatoes. All put on toasted sub bread. Usually this is so good, but this time, they were very skimpy on the all the veggies. To me this was very disappointing as I don't like paying for something and expecting it to be a certain way and it's nothing like what you want. The bread also wasn't very toasted, so it got soggy quickly and was falling apart before I was able to finish it. Taste wise, it was delicious..just wasn't much to it. My small sub cost $5.29.

My guest got the Bacon 3 cheese steak sub, which is made of steak, bacon, Provolone, Swiss & White American Cheese, lettuce and tomatoes, but they asked for no tomatoes. They said it tasted good, but again they didn't put much into the sub. Was very skimpy compared to other location. Cost $7.89 for a medium. On top of that, we also shared a Cheese & Bacon gourmet fries. Which is fries topped with Cheddar cheese sauce and bacon. They only offer one size, so what we got wasn't much. Cheese tasted ok, bacon not crispy and the fries were soggy. A big disappointment since they cost $3.49! 

Other then the food, the staff were friendly and they got our food out quickly. They just need to get educated on how to cook and prepare the food better. Fill the subs with more items and consistently the same every time and make sure your fries are crispy.",GWs9J6lIUqrySTxl6uXO0A,16,14,3,704-nVZoRjxSQlmcEdak8w
4084846,2015-05-05,1,Mb5w1N3tvsAFDrDcHQyrsw,"I always order a buffalo chicken philly, I know it's not the traditional philly steak but it is my favorite! It kind of reminds me of subway where you can add your own toppings there's isn't as many. They have lettuce, tomato, banana peppers, jalape√±os, mayo and pickles as options to add. I get lettuce, jalape√±os and pickles. 
The meat you choose is cooked right in front of you so it's very hot same with their French fries. For the fries they have all seasoning you can add on them yourself, I highly recommend that because I don't think they put salt on there fries so the all seasoning doesn't over do it. I usually get there lemonade as well but it is very sweet so get it if you go to the mall to eat first so you can carry it around with you, otherwise just get a fountain drink. 
This place is probably your best option to eat in the mall but I would't just go eat there if I wasn't at the mall lol that's why I gave it 4 stars.",U-7J-QQPUdjmoTofllWlPw,0,0,4,wty2OobRC3vjk_7qo0AXXw

 I got just Cheese Fries. I added salt but still very little flavor.
 The size was very small for what we paid. The Blueberry Lemonade was good, but made with kind of Blueberry compote. It was thick and sludgy, almost like over poked boba. My grandson shared with me and every time he got a blueberry he gagged.
 We got him a Chicken Finger kids meal. The fingers were over cooked and dry, they tasted vaguely of freezer burn. The finger meal comes with NO dipping sauce. I asked for ranch and they said its extra, but then gave it to me free.

My tip from Dec 10, 2016 - Watch them cook your food & place it in plate. During my visit the girl serving food put a piece of meat that fell on the counter into the sandwich. Reviewer from 20 days ago saw them cook a plastic w/ their meat & didn't remove it till the customer stated it. Doubt I'll eat here again. 

I was at the Meadows Mall last Saturday, and looking for a place to eat and this caught my eye. Philly cheese steaks! 

Looking at the menu I got the Philly cheese steak with everything on it and upgraded to Ultimate Fries. After I ordered was when I noticed the review about the customer seeing them cook a piece of plastic with his cheese steak and didn't remove it till the customer stated it. I watched them like a hawk while they cooked my food. 

The cheese steak and fries were okay, definitely tasted like chain fast food quality. I'd rather go to Pop's down the street. Service was great, it just the quality of cooking and food safety standards that worry me. 

If I have to keep an eye on them while they cook my food, it's not a place I would eat at again. Please train employees on how to cook the food, it's not difficult.",825Ol4rTvAZnUyFMke37jA,5,4,1,hfwcYnSdz6OcqY3V5vOM0g
