It's 9pm on a Saturday and they choose not to answer. It's ridiculous and is there no manager on duty? This has happened before too. They seem to make up their own hours and close when they want to work. I don't think it's crazy to expect someone to answer at 9pm when they are open until 10/11pm.

I expected that I would want to give this place 4 stars based on other yelp reviews and some friend recommendations, but no.  
Our experience wasn't the greatest.  It began around 630 PM trying to find parking.  There's a red curb out front where cars freely park.  Where are the firefighters going to park? It was happy hour and the place was packed (awesome for business). The staff was very friendly and accommodating but we were confused by who was actually our server.  The food was the least impressive.  We tried the meatballs, pork nuggets and the Poutine.  I expected homemade but I'm pretty sure the pork belly was smothered in some jar sauce and the meatballs were previously frozen.  Also, the gravy in the Poutine seemed like it was from a mix. 
This place has so much potential! The interior is cute with exposed brick.  The little store attached is probably great for the residents nearby.  Fix the food, get the staff on the same page and resolve some parking issues and it would be golden.",_ybknlgSmFSTSEq3RqBXiA,2,0,2,DJA4Kx6JkqVykUzSkiE99w
139470,2014-02-22,0,cOJ1uIVIHCiefUyWG2wDfw,"I went in for dinner today and had an ok experience. 

On the positive side, all of the staff was friendly and welcoming. The food was well-prepared and tasty - though a little pricey for the amount you get. I would recommend the wood fired pizza (called ""South of the Border"") which was decent size and flavorful and the Blind Pig salad.  The lounge feel was nice and it wasn't too crowded so you could have a good conversation and enjoy your drink/dinner.

In terms of areas for improvement, there were a few. They need to tweak the menu to give better value (portion to price) on some items and to right-size other items.  (I can't believe they don't have a small side salad that you can order with a main dish.) The serving staff needs to gain a little more experience as they seemed shaky and unfamiliar with some of the menu items. Lastly, beware of the drink sizes! I ordered a glass of wine and received a 3oz pour - about half what you'd expect from a lounge/bar but at full bar prices.  I asked the server about it and she said it was just an illusion because of the glass size - I don't think so!

As they're still pretty new, I'll cut them some slack but they need to work out some of the kinks. I'd give them a few weeks to make some tweaks and then try them again.  There is potential to make this a nice little off-strip lounge/eatery.",VNmQ12LYwG16HAspOp7WeQ,1,0,3,8Uwy6uhAbe3hUx1jbsf94w

We had a variety of pastas and each one had unique and rich flavors and the portions were generous. I had the Eggplant Rollatini which was recommended by our very nice waitress and I'm glad I took her advice. I also had the chance to try the Baked Chicken Breast Dore and would highly recommend it.

We ordered a 1/2 pep 1/2 jalapeno pizza

What we got was 1/2 pep 1/2 onions.

Instead of having them remake the whole pizza we asked to not be charged for the topping we didn't order and just give us a side of (raw) jalapenos.

They still charged us and refused to take it off the bill saying the side cost 1$ (they charged us $1.25). 

I could care less about $1, just honor what you tell your patrons.  The manager Kyle was not rude, but he was also not apologetic and still tried to insist we be charged.

First time: I came here to watch the NBA playoffs, so I sat at the bar. Ordered the BP Burger which was great - grass fed beef really helped with the flavor. It came with a small side of coleslaw. For $12, it was a B+ in my book.

For $3, I also got a square of the coffee cake. It was really good! Grade: A

Second time: I decided to order a pizza - the BP Classic. For $15, I'd give it a grade of B. That price is kind of meh.. (Domino's anyone??) haha. However, if you are desperate for pizza, it isn't bad.",k21ygqPTkF69U134wD_QOg,1,0,4,bikF8qkipuCisAd6xt1_Sg

Forward thinking American food fused with worldly flavors. We ordered many dishes and sampled from one another. The lobster mac and cheese was light yet rich; the pasta shells were large (not macaroni) and prepared slightly past al dente - perfect. The seared tuna was so buttery and served on a bed of Mediterranean orzo. The roasted pork sandwich was so flavorful and tasty. The lobster roll was simple but so good; it was filled with a generous amount of meat, the mayo dressing wasn't too much, and the bun was perfectly toasted. The burger was a grass fed beef patty topped with Gruyere and garlic aioli btwn a sesame bun. 

We came in for an early lunch and were a little hesitant bc the place was nearly empty. The decor is best described as an upscale cafe with a romantic steakhouse vibe. The staff is super friendly and the service is very attentive. 

Definitely will come eat here again.

I've come down here a few times to get dinner and have not yet been disappointed by the chef.  BP Porchetta is my go to...highly recommended.  That's not the reason why I'm 5 starring on yelp though...
I was sitting at the bar and Brittany, the brunette bartender, was mixing up a drink that was very involved....lots of ingredients in it.  I was amused by the effort so I asked if I could try it.  I'm not a cocktail person and I was mainly just asking so that I could taste what a prepared Blind Pig cocktail tastes like.  Brittany is a kind bartender, so she gave me a bit of what she made.

It was not what I expected.  It was probably one of the best prepared drinks that I've ever had.  It's called a ""bad hair day"", and it's something that she created herself for the menu.  It's a very feminine drink, but I have to say that I appreciate the craft of the drink and the effort that went into it.  It was very smooth and something that I feel is deserving of recognition.  

I'm a guy and would not order something like this on a normal occasion...but for any girls who read this post...or any guys who are ordering drinks for their date...I highly recommend Brittany's ""Bad Hair Day"".

Waitress was inattentive and ignorant of the menu items, and just generally did a bad job of things. At one point she was trying to open a bottle of wine and completely gave up after mauling the cork and causing bits of it to get in the wine, and went back to the bartender to open it. When we were ready to go, we asked to split up the checks or pay with different cards; we were then told by the waitress they only split it two ways. Sorry, no one really wants to foot a $300 bill! The manager came over and explained to us that it was too much of a hassle to split checks, and you have to manually split it in the billing app. Fucking seriously?!

Today I finally decided to stop by and see what it was all about. And I must say I am very underwhelmed by my experience. First off the food. From reading previous reviews I had decided to get the lobster  roll. Sadly when I looked at the menu today, there was no lobster roll. So I settled for the lobster ravioli which had a rich, creamy sauce, but a rather dry filling. It was good enough to finish. After my meal I ordered the Cafe Mocha for dessert. Please don't waste your money. First off there was no steamed milk in my mocha which was the first sign that something was off. Actually I take that back. The first sign that something was off was the very obvious chunks of hot chocolate powder used in lieu of real hot chocolate or chocolate syrup. This was by far the worst mocha I have ever had. I was so disappointed. Based on previous reviews, it appears that things have gone down at the Blind Pig. Now in regards to service. I walk in at about 2:30 pm and I'm not acknowledged and sat down until 2:50 pm. After that my waitress, who never introduced herself, was as scarce as possible. I had to actually go seek her in order to get my check. It was incredibly slow so there was no reason for the lack of service. That is never good. One last thing that stood out was the lack of professionalism. I could actually see one of the bartenders bright pink bra and instead of tending to the customers and moving food quickly waitresses were hanging out at the bar talking.

Do not visit here and neglect an opportunity to enjoy the Garlic Knots...you will regret that.

I might have had better luck there unfortunately. It was pretty quite on a Tuesday late night but there was one group of trust fund kids at the bar that made it their goal to own the room. Yelling like this was the coolest frat party they've ever been to. I don't want to blame the staff but I kinda do. Decide if you want your place to be a wild club or a restaurant. I could tell the other customers were not too amused with the dinner theater.   

The food was okay but for the price range I expected a little more. $18 lamb chops were a little dry but the seasoning was good. Potatoes were a little over cooked but not terrible. It's not a meal I would send a postcard home about. Beer choice was okay.

992542,2014-03-06,0,cOJ1uIVIHCiefUyWG2wDfw,"One of the latest restaurants to open is The Blind Pig inside Panorama Towers. You can spot the restaurant from the I-15 it is accessed on Dean Martin Drive ample parking is available out front. Inside, you're met with a deli to your right and lounge to the left. My brother and I came in to dine for lunch. You order at the counter, you're given a number and your food is brought to you over in the lounge. The Deli seemed promising, it reminded me of a petite version of those I love in San Diego and San Francisco. You feel like you're transported into a speakeasy when you step over to the lounge. There is a large bar, oversized booths and table seating. 

The menu offers a variety of appetizers, salads, sandwiches, pizzas and entrees that include pasta, poultry or seafood. They also serve breakfast, though, I'm not sure when its available. My brother chose the Pastrami Rueben ($9.50) with coleslaw and I had the BP Porchetta sandwich with potato salad ($13.50). After a short wait, our lunch was served.

The Rueben was decent. The pastrami is sliced thin and possibly tossed on the griddle since there were crisp edges. The bread was dry, but the Russian dressing was quite good. Better than most Thousand Island dressings. The coleslaw went uneaten, it was too sweet for both of our tastes. 

The Porchetta sandwich sounded great in theory, but the execution was poor. The greens were limp and slimey. The nuggets of pork belly and pork loin tumbled out from the bread with every bite. The pork loin was tender and had great flavor. I wish it were thinly sliced instead and piled high; it would make for a tasty sandwich. I enjoy pork belly when the fat is properly rendered. It was unfortunate that more than half of the nuggets were tough and filled with flubber. I found those pieces inedible. As a general rule, I do not like potato salad. Majority contain mayo and mustard; my least favorite condiments, this was no exception. I'd prefer alternate options to potato salad and cole slaw since both contain mayonnaise. My sandwich and iced tea was $18. I left hungry. Needless to say, I won't be rushing back to The Blind Pig, but I may return to try other menu items because the location makes it a very convenient lunch option.",ZsUSGU1-L1ImomLZjXxxTg,1,0,3,i5vfVYd3VT6C39JAGD8jJw

I saw that they had poutine and I had tried it once before at the Pig and the Pickle in Concord,CA and loved it and now whenever I see it on a menu, I have to try it. I'm so glad we had time to come back today and try this place. There was plenty of parking this time around, early Sunday morning. Walked in and immediately noticed the deep booths available and loved the nice touch of the added comfy pillows.  Loved the lighting, dark walls, pig heads and pig paintings. It all worked quite well together. 
I didn't know what to expect when yelp said free drink just for checking in. Free drink ended up including any cocktail, coffee or smoothie. It being still early I went for the very berry smoothie. What a deal! 
Previous reviews suggested trying the pork bites. I was conflicted. But, tasty pork won out over fries with cheese and gravy.   It didn't disappoint. Nice, fatty, fried pork pieces in a slightly spicy sweet sauce paired nicely with the creamy dipping sauce. The flavors and textures melded well together - it truly was a taste of heaven in my mouth.

1330941,2017-12-18,1,cOJ1uIVIHCiefUyWG2wDfw,"Absolute ripoff.  It's called blind pig because the waitresses and cooks are probably blind on the prices they quote on the menu and what ends up on the receipt.  They quote you a pizza for $14.99, then the bill comes to $27, they charge $1.50 for green peppers and each other topics. Then for deep dish style they charge extra $7.50 without telling you upfront.  

My waitress forgot the ranch dressing, then another waitress who brought me the pizza, completely disappeared after I asked her for ranch also.  I waited 25 min for a low grade pizza which didn't even have thoroughly cooked tomatoes and green peppers, just a ton of melted mozzarella and an average dough. 

It doesn't end there, they kept changing the games on Tv with a loud  treble sound that no seemed to care about. 

Let me give all restaurant owners a little tip about customer service and finance, because there are a lot of trust fund babies that have no idea how businesses are ran.  If you provide a terrible service, then a loyal customer such as myself will never step foot here Again , which costs you $300-400 of lost sales a year, including any additional lost business from people who will change their mind after reading this Yelp review. 

If you have unhappy workers or workers who smoke too much pot and forget to bring ranch or whatever else is asked, then you might want to ask yourself how long you will stay in business.

The small room is dimly lit and there are pig decorations everywhere. Not tacky pigs but cool pigs, if that can be possible. 

Since there were three of us, we ordered a couple things to share. We started with Poutine and it was very good. I only had it one other time, in Canada and surprisingly this was way better! My friends liked the Pork Belly Nuggets but they weren't my favorite. I think pork belly is hit or miss because sometimes it is too fatty.

I shared the Speakeasy Steak Sandwich with my friend and it was delicious!! Their bread is super thick and amazing. I asked for extra mayo of course because that's how I like my cheesesteaks. 

Overall, I think this is a cute place to hang out with friends. They had drink specials but I didn't pay attention since I don't drink but my friends seemed excited about them.

The sauce was still not enough and the little sauce we got had zero flavor. Maybe there wasn't enough sauce to actually taste it. The cheese was sparse and the entire pizza was over cooked.

This place used to be wonderful, and it's gone straight to the gutter. I miss the market terribly and so do other residents for the Panorama. The food has tasted ""cheaper"" and the service has fallen greatly. Not to mention their new management is rude and doesn't look out for their workers. I have seen their staff eating on the floors or under the stairwell of the garage, that's ridiculous! One employee told me that ""it's either here or the floor in the kitchen."" Being a bar owner myself I'm appalled at this new ownership. It's always a shame when something good goes sour. As the saying goes, it it's not broke don't fix it. 
As a result, I will never be returning to The Blind Pig and will take the short trip down the street to Johnny Rockers for now on. This place might as well just name to the Pig because that's what they are.

The ambiance is modern and relaxed, the staff is great, the drinks are amazing, and the food is delicious. Coming from the strip, the value for the price is excellent. I mean, if you want ridiculous value then go to Taco y Taco, but if you want value for high quality food then this place has that. My favorite dish is the shrimp and lobster mac 'n cheese, which is a full meal. On my third visit I had the pizza with the sausage, pepperoni, onions, and mushrooms (I don't recall the name) and it was very good. I see other reviews about the margarita pizza and I've heard the same, so I'm sure they'll fix it. They are new, so when you stop in ask, since they're in improvement mode. I don't even think they've had their grand opening yet. The mixed drinks are high quality and the bottled beer selection is a great mix of craft and specialty beers along with a few go-to beers if you're not a beer person. My advice, go there now; it's only a matter of time before you'll need to make a reservation or wait in line.

Five or so minutes later, what seemed to be the busser, came and took our drink order, a few beers, water, and a tea. Waitress came by, seven minutes later, asked if we needed drinks, we said we orderd some, the tea and water already being out, the beers being completely forgotten about. Had to retell what the beers were, they came out eight minutes later. The place was NOT busy, three other tables, one being a table of eight. Waitress came back after another six minutes asked if we were ready, we responded with ""yes"" she walked away, I got her attention again before she got too far, we placed orders. Food came out promptly, eight minutes, two of our four ordered burgers, no condements were offered we had to flag down the bartender to get some as our waitress was no where to be found. Food was good, props to the kitchen. Drinks were dry and no one came by, we didnt know what the waitress was doing. Twenty three minutes later the busser came by and refilled the water and tea, no mention of the beers to be had. Seventeen minutes later, the busser came and cleared the table, we had just finished eating. Thirty seven minutes later the waitress came by to see if we needed anything, we asked for a check, four minutes later we got it. One of our group felt bad that she didnt put the two beers we had on the check so when she came back six minutes later told her, she said, ""What beers did you have?"" Responded with one of their ambers and a Firestone, she goes ""Oh"". Leaves comes back two minutes later with, ""So you didn't get the beers?"", we said, ""No we got them, they just were not charged to the bill."" Responding, ""Okay let me add them."" My thought when she didnt add them was maybe it was a nice comp for the realization of poor service, but this statement proves not. Comes back four minutes later again with the final bill charged and walks away, full meal finally finished. No thank you or come again, mind you we were not rude by any means, and actually were curious if we had done something to get the service we got. One hundred and thirty three minutes for a meal.

I also didn't see the pastry case or ""pantry"" shop area earlier reviews mention. I suggest focusing on the most recent reviews.

Came in for a weekday lunch with Bethany E. I dig the masculine lounge feel of the place and like that we were able to snag a cozy booth for our visit. Staff were attentive and the food was okay. Menu is still several pages but what we ordered didn't wow- spinach artichoke dip was thin but tasty, and better with the bread basket than the tortilla chips, but neither of us finished our sandwiches. My eggplant parm was okay, but a little boring. Side salad was just mixed greens and Italian dressing, but it was a good dressing with fresh oregano. 

I wouldn't necessarily go out of my way to come back, but I do hope this spot finds it's niche.  Nothing was actually bad, but it was very average. They either need to bring back the items that previous customers loved, or redo the menu to focus on better execution.

PET PEEVE: The parking lot is small, and they have the majority of spaces blocked off for valet. If I wasn't meeting someone here that would have turned me off enough to dine elsewhere. It's completely unnecessary, especially for weekday lunch.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,27,12,3,IjwyoLTZlAAMZXqOJsLLWQ

There doesn't seem to be much parking as most of the spaces directly in front were roped off for valet.  There is plenty of seating on both sides of the restaurant.  The booths are very comfy accented with pillows. 

We decided to start with the Spinach & Artichoke dip.  For me it was too watery.  It was almost as if the artichokes were from a can and they didn't drain the excess.  I really enjoy my dips to be more creamy.  The have a great bread basket so I would suggest using that bread instead of the tortilla chips that come with it.

I ordered the Philly with fries.  The sandwich had a good flavor.  Wonderful amount of meat and veggies packed in.  The bread used was really good as well.  A little crisp on the outside with a soft center.  The fries were just ok but could have been cooked a little longer.

1820296,2015-02-07,12,cOJ1uIVIHCiefUyWG2wDfw,"So I'm an all around huge fan of this somewhat hidden gem off the strip; from the awesome food, to the amazing friendly service, to the ambiance and decor of the establishment. This is def a great Las Vegas Foodie experience in my opinion. 

Where do I start? Okay so when you get to The Blind Pig, they have two sections: a cafe or bakery (can't remember the exact name) and the other said as the Lounge. The bakery or cafe side is where you can come in and grab made and packaged sandwiches and salads for on the go, along with breads and drinks. Then the lounge side is the dining area with a full bar and bar seating available. 

I'm totally in love with the ambiance and decor of the place! Very chic and romantic dark, like a dapper feel. And the pig decor is not overwhelming. It works. But the place has a dark mysterious touch like one that totally works as a great place to bring someone for a date!! Even the booth seating are tots romantic!! 

Ooo and most definitely don't forget to check in on yelp to receive your one free drink!! And what I love most about this yelp promo is that it's not just house drinks, but includes speciality cocktails, speciality smoothies/juices, and speciality lattes or coffee drinks!! So they have a huge variety of drinks to choose from!! And they also have happy hour for drink from 10-close, so that's always a plus! Great drinks to pre-game your night with dinner and drinks before hitting the strip. And those speciality cocktails are sorta strong surprisingly. 

Okay so onto food... You cannot leave this place without at least trying the Poutine! I love it! Definitely my favorite starter. They always have daily specials and they are worth hearing what they are to try. My go to is the Steakeasy Sandwich. The prime rib sandwich is also phenomenal. And the lobster and shrimp Mac and Cheese is probably one of the best I've had. They most def are not stingy with lobster/shrimp serving. 

Another plus is if you order a salad as your side (you can pick salad, fries, or coleslaw when you order a sandwich) that depending on the dressing the salad is different. Like I get arugula when I order balsamic dressing. And the greens topping are different if you get thousand island. I love that!! Makes the meal different each time! 

 I've only had dessert here once and I honestly can't remember what I had but I know it musta been good lol but definitely an overall all around great dining experience every time! Love coming here whether it be lunch or dinner. Oh and they have free wifi! Haha so yeh a 5star spot for me!",nRdfX_I0CaOq7lJunJMPpA,20,15,5,EmDUZ72u6Q8z1ctUwfLvrA

We got menus and then realized we are probably waiting close to 10 minutes with out anyone helping us. We were on a time crunch and hungry so it became alittle frustrating. The weird thing is once we realized we had been waiting quite a while we looked for servers or bussers and there was no one to be found. Finally a girl came over too our drink and app orders. 

We got the gravy fries and the pork nuggets to start. Fries were sooo good!!! The pork nuggets I could have gone with out. The rest of the food was pretty good I got the BP burger and my sister got the lobster mac and cheese. The lobster Mac was good not nothing super special. I wish I had gotten a pizza it looked so good when I saw another table order it.

We brought our 1 year old which it does not feel like a place to bring your kids but there had high chairs and our waitress was supper sweet. And our kid is very well behaved and no one even noticed her until maybe before we were leaving and she was yelling hi to everyone at the bar that was finally starting to fill up at 7. The bar is beautiful and masculine. Dark woods and different textiles fill this space up but still feels open and minimal. They keep it cold so bring a jacket if you are easily chilled. The drinks on happy hour are 5 bucks. I got the sunny sunday. Its basically a Cadillac margarita. The blind pig is very very good. More like a vodka martini. We got the meatball app they were dry but they marinara was pretty good. The grass fed Burger was very very good. Well be back for lunch and smoothies and sandwiches will be our next adventure.

I placed my order for the chopped salad and pretzel bites with beer cheese and brought it back to my office. The beer cheese and pretzel bites were still piping hot which was a plus! But the cheese was way too runny, like water. It tasted like onions soaked in water and was extremely disappointing.

The chopped salad was okay, but I felt like it was lacking something. I got the dressing on the side but I had the same soggy issue that others mentioned before even putting the dressing on there. I pushed the salad to the side and saw the bottom had a pool of water.

Strong words.  I have had many burger in town and when somebody say that I always question it,  but I also have to try it...   So with that in my mind I came here to see if it was true.  Walking in the door  first impression his is a cool place... Dark tones stone wood and brick..classy.   I sit down and the bartenders were attentive informed and they were not to bad to look at either... I had a few cocktails all were delicious... Then the moment came and the burger arrived It looked fantastic and at first bite I was shocked that this might actually be the best burger in town... It is cooked p e r f e c t l y and seasoned and the bread it toasted and soft and fresh and the toppings are fresh and plentiful but not overwhelming... I started fast but as I got to the end I didn't want it I stop and noticed I was taking smaller and smaller bites... But eventually it was all gone... :-( 
As I write this I find my self in that same position not wanting this to end...best burger in Vegas is not far off... It def makes my top 3 I have had and it had some distinguished company!!

Bottom line
JUST ORDER THE BURGER... Ten next time actually look at the menu... There is alit of other tasty stuff on it too... Like crispy pork nuggets. That you will just have to experience yourself... Enjoy.",Y-MZ52J82c0culy39QM_VQ,3,0,5,Pp-BxDj72szYeUpWN8-1Iw
1953570,2015-06-20,0,cOJ1uIVIHCiefUyWG2wDfw,"So after a long time coming I finally made it to The Blind Pig and I was glad I did.

Tucked under the Panorama towers on Dean Martin it is a nice spot for the residence. But everyone and their mom can enjoy it as well. They have a deli grab and go side and a sit down dinning area with a pretty awesome bar. 

I went all because of their Pork Belly Nuggets a Delicouse crispy fatty nugget appetizer soaked in a Thai sweet chili sauce with peanuts and just the right amount of cilantro. I think the cilantro makes the whole thing so I hope you all like it but if not that's ok because this would be yummy with or without it. The Meaty Wrap breakfast burrito ok not amazing but really good. It have eggs, cheese, ham, bacon and house made sausage I think or of not it was gourmet sausage not no store bought Jimmy Dean (although I love me some Jimmy Dean) I thought that the gourmet one was a nice touch. The side of fried potatoes was amazing crispy, nicely season and cooked to perfection, not to mention they topped them with a little bit of sautéed onions which I loved! The salsa that came with the wrap was spicy to the right level and was just chunky enough.

I got a free Green Revolution smoothie with my Check in and my daughter loves it. It was the right blend of Kale, spinach, banana, pineapple, green apple and yogurt. Retail for $7 that was an awesome checkin! 

I love the styling and decor of the Resturant Chic, comfy and casual upscale (if that makes sense) I am dying to try their other menu item so I will definitely be back! The only thing is I wish they would promote their brand more like putting their logo on the cups, bags or even togo boxes. It's advertisement and I would love to carry that around and show it off.",YLeDSZ1Nh1N0hNsSyQdE3A,1,1,4,LsyukiQVJzh1cAJYkbGh2g
1978107,2014-05-14,1,cOJ1uIVIHCiefUyWG2wDfw,"I've always wanted to try poutine, so that sold me on giving this place a try. We ordered that to start, along with the meatballs. The poutine lived up to my expectations and more. In fact, it makes me hungry for it as I write this review, a couple days later. Other items we tried:

Meatballs: good, nothing special 

Lobster and shrimp roll: not listed on the menu, but available; also good, not too mayonnaisy (which I liked) but could've used some old bay seasoning to give it a little extra flavor.

Steak frites: seasoned well and came with some yummy sautéed spinach

Our only complaint was the server. We were seated quickly and ordered drinks quickly (with someone else). But the server was nowhere in sight and finally appeared 10 minutes later. Mind you, it's a small restaurant with only about 10 other customers there that night. The server was very nice, but seemed confused when she came over (seemed like she thought we already ordered). At the end of the meal, she asked if we wanted dessert, but there's no dessert menu and she could only remember the tiramisu and one other item we couldn't make out. Don't ask us if we want dessert if you don't know what desserts are available, lol.

All in all, we'd go back for the poutine, but they probably won't be part of our regular rotation.",bu3qhZXlxkWir0EzC2txBQ,1,1,4,0ETk7DErp9_7vYpeW2GmmA

It's worth seeking out, though. James O. felt a little rushed by the bartender, but I thought the service was just fine. Be sure to check-in on Yelp for a free speciality cocktail (or smoothie). It was a little frustrating that they were out of so many things. Straight away, the bartender informed us of at least 6 beers and 3 cocktails he couldn't do. And when I ordered by cocktail, he let me know he couldn't do that one either (so over half the cocktails were out). I settled on The Blind Pig cocktail, which was like a fancier cosmo - a good choice. The menu has several tasty items. But the reason we came was the poutine fries. I was a little afraid of being told they couldn't make it because they were out of something. But thankfully, we were able to order it. It was a sizable portion - definitely more than enough to share. And at $6.50, it seemed like a bargain. While tasty, it wasn't the best I've had. But I would certainly return and order it again.

Decided to give the poutine and crunchy pork chunks a try.  Surprisingly, both were delicious.  Will come back for their shrimp & lobster Mac n' cheese at a later time though.

The broccoli and potatoes that came with the chops were great. So that helped.

I've driven by this place more times than I can remember, but I finally crossed at the right time and so I stopped in for a bite. 
Grabbed a seat at the bar with Jared, nice guy, very warm and friendly. The set up was odd. There was an enormous brick column separating one half the bar from the other. Felt like awkward and detached. 

Menu was nice and clean, one page. 
I went with the BP chopped salad after first ordering the chicken Caesar..my neighbor had already ordered one and when I looked over and saw what appeared to be bland old ice berg lettuce as the foundation, I made the switch. In addition to the salad I added two lobster tacos..one flour and one corn tortilla, why? Cause I felt certain the corn would be over powering and clash with the lobster but like any good scientist, I ran both experiments. I was right, the corn totally over took what was a very good lobster taco. 
The BP salad was also good but it was drowning in red vinaigrette dressing and by the time I got to the bottom, I had to force myself to eat the chopped bits of cheese and salami that had inevitably fallen off the fork. 
All washed down with a single glass of 'a brother from another mother' whiskey which was treated with lime juice over a large block of ice and garnished with a lime twist. Absolutely delicious cocktail. Best part of the meal. In retrospect, I should have had two cocktails and three lobster tacos on flour tortillas.",wGCIzYUugIYOds35_Qzagw,0,0,3,UV-BiOtV_Ms29FbnugqHhA

Service.

If it was any more terrible, we would've needed to call the police because we were not going to pay our bill.

Our server didn't check on us and HELD OUR FOOD IN THE KITCHEN until everything was lukewarm. We were starving so unfortunately, we didn't do anything about it. She never cared if we had water or drinks or had food. We were 1 of 4 current tables. She was watching a sports game.

The inside décor is cute. Reminds me of a more old school, darker, feeling. I loved the booths, and of course I just had to sit in the booth right next to this awesome pig painting! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-blind-pig-las-vegas?select=xnMiOI-fpcaZWbWUP4e8fg#xnMiOI-fpcaZWbWUP4e8fgb 

So of course after looking over the cocktail menu I just had to order THE BLIND PIG! And to top off my dorky pig obsession, I just had to take a picture of the cocktail with my travel buddy! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-blind-pig-las-vegas?select=50GFtOwsgv_s3-zyDAEK-Q#11_KCd5ioYZdzFvjboAY6Q This cocktail is $10 and is a mixture of raspberry vodka, grand marnier, lime juice angostura and angostura orange. I thought this cocktail was great!  I definitely would recommend this to guys and girls.

Hands down! It's like an explosion of flavors once you take a bite! It's so good you don't even want to eat your fries! It's so good it doesn't need any other items to compliment the burger! The blind pig burger was cooked just the way I wanted it and every bite I took just melted in my mouth! The beef was so juicy! The bacon was nice and thick. The best part was it was not messy burger! Pick it up and go at it! This burger has a distinct taste that I cant put my finger on it but you will remember the taste. You may even dream about it lol.

The restaurant itself had a nice feel to it. I came during lunch so it wasn't busy. They have a full bar and a few TV's to watch sports etc. The atmosphere feels positive and elegant. It's a nice place to sit and enjoy lunch. 

The price is a bit on the pricer side but after the service you receive and the food you eat it more that makes up for the cost. Sometimes I feel weary about spending so much for a burger but I'll tell you this at the end of the day price wasn't even on my mind. All I kept thinking about was how tasteful the burger was and how nice the staff was. 

I returned 1 week later and the same girl was working the counter. She remembered me! That made my day. Whenever someone acknowledges that they remember you it also shows to me that they pay attention and don't treat customers as just a number. I had a great conversation with her when I arrived. 

I will definitely make my way back here so I can try out their other items on the menu!

However, after receiving my meal I was astounded at the quality of food and excellent craftsmanship of my old fashion drink. 
First my burger, I ordered the signature burger as I often do as a bench mark for a first visit. The burger was prepared perfectly and the marriage of flavors was astounding, possibly the best in Vegas. 
After being dazzled by the myriad of fine whiskies on their bar shelves, I resolved to test the bar maids abilities. I use the old fashion as a benchmark for drinks as it is somewhat simple but often made poorly by morons posing as mixologists. Once again I was sent reeling at the unfathomable excellence of the cocktail I had just sampled. The vast knowledge and competence of the bar maid "" Melissa"" certainly exceeds that of the finest in the area. A true connoisseur and a master in the art of fine beverage mixology.

The Blind Pig has two areas. A cafe/pastry to go style side, and a restaurant/bar side. The booths are big and flashy looking, and it reminds me of a modern day, well lit, speakeasy, that isn't a secret. 
I tried the chicken wings and meatballs as appetizers. A Bloody Mary cocktail for a drink. And for main entrees I tried the lobster/shrimp mac and cheese and the lobster roll.  The seafood dishes were both on point. Down the the roll used, the bread was fresh, not to soft, and perfectly toasted. I was also happy with both apps. Veal in a meatball is an instant winner in my opinion. And the blue cheese seemed as it was made in house. Nice and chunky!
Service was decent. Not amazing, but not bad by any means. Prices are totally reasonable especially considering the location. I hope to return soon, and try some of the desserts.",NjNJ1JLnMlOfnDI6Oz6Qew,2,3,4,lf314DKGYQLuZQ9tK2wTIg

Prime Roast Beef Sandwich with french fries.  Solid sandwich.  The french roll was light buttery and fluffy.  This is The Blind Pig's version of a French Dip.  Roast beef was well sliced and very flavorful 5oz portion.  At first I thought it was not going to fulfill my lunch hunger pains but I was wrong.  The au jus that accompanied the sandwich was very tasty with the perfect hint of salty flavor.  

The french fries were a hit.  Seasoned style fried crispy with light a fluffy potatoes on the interior.  Very nicely done and a huge portion as well.  The meal is served with a dill pickle that was tasty but looked like it had been in the barrel for some time.  

IF, you check in on Yelp you can have a complimentary beverage with a choice of juice, smoothie, or cocktail.  Being mid afternoon with a full day ahead I opted for the smoothie.  The Berry Smoothie was excellent with raspberries, strawberries, blueberries, and blackberries all blended with yogurt. Another success!

Had their house ""BP Burger"" and it was delicious...a well cooked burger with bacon, arugula, and gruyere cheese.  It was great.  My only comment is that it came with a small side of housemade potato salad and it was ok...I was not impressed.  If I wanted fries, it is an upgrade and a small extra charge.

My friend had their meatball sub and it was a daily special not on the menu that our friendly server told us about.  He enjoyed the sub...it came with housemade marinara for dipping and he cleaned his plate.

2769707,2014-03-08,2,cOJ1uIVIHCiefUyWG2wDfw,"I liked it! I really liked it! I'm a sucker for decor, and I loved the inside of this place. It was like a Speakeasy meets Old Time Saloon. Brick walls adorned with a train set on one end of the place and a stuffed Boar hanging on the other. Edison lights hang over the bar area, and two gold old fashioned cash registers are on display behind the bar. Above are two hanging pieces of tin lined ceilings. The booths are comfy while there are some tables set up in the middle of the lounge as well. Onto the food.


It is set up like a service counter, you order your food, then go sit down. Available at the counter are some pre made items, like salads and sandwiches. Also a refrigerator that has some pre made items prepared by the chefs and frozen so you can take to go and prepare later, as well as some McConnell's Ice Cream pints. They have a small provision area that kind of reminds me of Resnick's Grocery downtown, I guess if you lived in the Panorama and had a hankering for a hostess treat, this would be convenient. They also have outside seating, but might get a little loud, it faces Dean Martin and I-15.
 
We wanted to grab a couple items and share, there were so many that stuck out, but we decided on Poutine, which is a favorite of mine. Fries were crinkle cut, that reminded me of my childhood and the Ore-Ida fries that was a household staple. Gravy had good flavor, I just wish there was a little more cheese curds. Crispy Pork Nuggets were really good, small portion, as it is an appetizer and if you ate any more, you might as well drive yourself to the nearest hospital and have your arteries unclogged. Then we shared the Shrimp and Lobster Roll, as crazy as it sounds, the old bay mayo and the fancy hot dog bun it came on really made this sandwich. 

I was too full to try dessert, but the monkey bread and the PB&J bar looked delicious. They serve Illy coffee as well as fresh squeezed juices and smoothies.

The clams with white sauce I had ordered for an appetizer had fresh clams with canned clams added to it. I do not understand the point behind this. The sauce was over salted by a lot. My guess is the sauce was batch done and left on a warmer to reduce. The Penne Puttanesca was nothing more than tomato sauce with ,I'm sure, every single olive they had in the joint. Not impressed by any means. GF had the Eggplant Parmigiana Sandwich. It was pre-breaded frozen eggplant put on par-cooked bread that the kitchen didn't bother to finish off the baking process. I work in a kitchen and can spot shit food when I see/taste it. They are way overpriced for the quality of food they serve. I'm guessing the bar is what keeps the restaurant afloat.

Party of 20? Not a problem. Bringing a cake from somewhere else? Not a problem ($3 ""outside food"" fee applies, however). 

Some members of the party were uncomfortably warm early on, and the staff were kind enough to move our entire party to the other section, which was farther away from the kitchen - even dragging in outside patio furniture to seat us all.

The servers were attentive and there wasn't a single incorrect order across our entire party. Everyone was happy with the selection and the price - where you can spend $10, or you can spend $50 on a single person. 

Drinks are a little pricey at $12 for cocktails, but I've never actually been to a restaurant where the Whisky Sour is actually made with egg whites - except this one. All the cocktails were excellent. 

They only added in a 15% gratuity to the check. If you enjoyed their service, throw a little more in.",SAvfpZXe1qtu_5U_yvYI0A,1,0,5,c1HbUL1shBh4pWy1lh8hLw

I thought it was right behind city center and planned on just walking there (i totally forgot how not walking friendly Vegas was). It is actually across the freeway and it would have been an awkward walk there so we decided to just take a cab (which of course we got raped on the cab fare.) 

The place was roomy and decor was great. I assume most of the people there were residents of Panorama Towers. They also had outdoor seating for those many beautiful Vegas days. Their menu had great choices and I had a hard time deciding. I was a fool to get their pizza! Though the pizza was huge and pretty tasty. My favorite were the pork nuggets! I don't eat pork often but man these were tasty!!! They're like bacon but a bit sweeter and in cube form. You can just eat these with beer after beer after beer and it would be the best meal! Perfect little bites. 

My fiancee got the pulled pork sandwich special which he inhaled in about 30 seconds. We didn't even get to see what the dish looked like. lol. Our friends got sandwiches too but was not able to try them. They seemed to like it though.

I ordered the nuggets and they were awesome. Crispy crunchy on the outside and melt in your mouth buttery on the inside. The fat was rich and a tad too much fat for my liking.

3167787,2014-08-04,5,cOJ1uIVIHCiefUyWG2wDfw,"If you didn't know already, The Blind Pig is a slightly unusual blend of bar/lounge, restaurant and market all rolled up into a space just beneath the Panorama towers. The parking outside is pretty limited and although the space itself is pretty large, there isn't much seating if you do plan to dine in. Even with the limited space, this slightly hipster-esque joint has a very cool vibe and unique styling. The big booths are comfy and having pillows to lay back on after stuffing your face is always a plus. Oh, and quick tip...kids are more than welcome, but it's probably best to bring them along during breakfast-lunch hours.

The menu itself is a lot larger than I expected and has quite a bit to offer, including several options for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Adding to the regular menu is Chef specials which seem to be available on any given day. They've also got a full coffee and juice bar that pumps out fresh squeezed mixes and smoothies. To start off, I had an iced chai latte which could hold it's own next to just about any coffee shop in town. It was smooth, creamy and wasn't overly spiced. We also had orange juice and a strawberry-banana smoothie that were equally delicious.

I had a hard time deciding what to order since one of the Chef specials of the day was a meatball sandwich and I love those. Ultimately, I ended up going with the shrimp & lobster roll that I've had my eye on since I bookmarked this place though. The flavor was surprisingly great! There was enough Old Bay seasoning on there to taste without ruining the flavor of the shrimp or lobster, which were both nice and tender. I also appreciated that they don't drench the seafood in mayo. The roll was a nice texture and had enough butter to compliment the ingredients, but at just under $15, I thought the meat to bread ratio was a little off. There was a few bites where I was just eating all bread. Even so, it was a solid sandwich and the potato salad served by it's side was very tasty. Thick chunks of potato with a nice hint of mustard and again, just the right amount of mayo. 

As far as the pricing goes, the structure is a bit weird. We also ordered one of the other Chef's specials which was a pulled pork sandwich, and it was priced at $15. The pork was juicy and their slightly sweet but tangy BBQ sauce was great, but I questioned the price. Why? Well, because apart from the $14.5 shrimp and lobster roll, we also ordered a breakfast sandwich that was only $6. Obviously, it wasn't as big but with thick slices of bacon, 2 eggs and cheese on a English muffin, the value was much better. It was easily the best $6 breakfast sandwich I've eaten and was served with a delicious side of lyonnaise potatoes.

Honestly, I came into The Blind Pig with pretty low expectations and I don't know why. I can happily say that both the food and serviced surprised me a lot. Extremely friendly and attentive staff, great food and a great ambience. We ordered a lot more food then we usually do for the 3 of us and walked out for $60.

Honey pig I think of sweet & savory.... that's exactly what it was. Came here for happy hour one day w/ a couple of friends & we were allowed to sit anywhere. 

The place was smaller than I expected... they had a long bar & about 3 booths w/ maybe 4 tables inbetween the bar & booths. There is also a deli side as well. The place had a very secretive vibe... it was kool though & interesting. 

Someone came over & gave us some menus but they said they were  changing up the happy hour menu so they verbalized what items were on the list. We weren't too sure on who our server was... the bartender came over to get our drinks & order for us but some other guy did the rest of the work such as refills & plate clearing. 

SHRIMP & LOBSTER MAC & CHEESE $18.50 - OMAN... this thing was rich & creamy goodness... but I would definitely not be able to finish it all as just an entree... it is a bit too heavy for my taste buds to finish all in one sitting. It was a great dish to share so that we all got a little taste.

BLIND PIG CHOPPED $9 - I thought this was a HUGE salad for $9 but it was good. Definitely have to say that it was a bit over dressed to the point the greens were pretty soggy.... will have to ask for dressing on the side next time, but it was REFRESHING overall to compliment w/ the Mac & cheese.

EVA'S GIN $10 - this was the most REFRESHING cocktail that I have tasted in a long time... & I was able to actually finish it & feel fine... so there may have been little alcohol but that's aOK for me. PLUS it was free w/ my check-in!!

Then finally we order and as I'm pointing at the menu I say "" the eggplant parmigiana sandwhich"" I ask if there is sweet potato fries as an option she said they are out. So I decided I'll take a side salad. Here's the kicker when the food comes out I get a plate of something that I didn't know what it was. I tell the same waitress I ordered with that it's not what I ordered. She reminds me that it is. Haha I said I got a sandwhich with a side salad. What was in front of me was a plate of spaghetti and eggplant parmigiana covered in cheese and red sauce. She proceeded to tell me that if I wanted the sandwhich it would take awhile. Starving I said forget it. We never saw her again and the guy I was with had to go to the bar to get a refill on his Diet Coke! The only saving grace was she comped my meal.

3414930,2016-03-24,1,cOJ1uIVIHCiefUyWG2wDfw,"Facing Dean Martin Drive in the ground floor of Panorama Towers, The Blind Pig stands unique in its upscale yet unpretentious interior design, its split operation (restaurant/bar on one side, quick packaged deli on the other), and its level of service in its immediate neighborhood.  

Friends and I often meet here due to its proximity to Liberace Garage, just down Dean Martin Drive.  You would have to cross over the freeway to City Center and the Strip or travel a several miles west before coming across a competitor.  It sits defiantly in the industrial sector, but overlooking the gleaming towers of City Center just across I-15.  This makes its ambiance, design and level of service almost defiant when juxtaposed with the location, and very refreshing.  High ceilings and retro-industrial feel cross with diamond-tuck booths.  Floor-to-ceiling windows on the east wall make it bright by day, scenic by night, conditions magnified if you sit on the patio.  The bartenders are serious mixologists with great inventory.

The Blind Pig just underwent a renovation of its patio and re-vamp of its menu, so I was eager to try it out.  I was happy to see they didn't seem to change what was already working, with a minor exception or two below.  The patio saw the addition of heavier barriers to the parking lot and heaters.

The menu has always been a bit of Italian fusion, with decent gluten free pizza options, great French Dip and pulled pork.  It was quite unique in its variety.  The new incarnation appears to be an attempt to be more Italian, with other options falling off.  Paper-in-portfolio menus have unfortunately given way to laminated one pagers, with heavy lettering of the I-wish-this-looked-like-a-little-italy-joint.  It's an odd Denny's sort of intro to a place that otherwise seems more sophisticated - not to mention that laminate collects finger germs and is seldom sterilized.  Nobody wants to have to do a hand wash between ordering and eating.

The coffee is a problem.  They don't brew, they use those ridiculous capsules, as if this were a free breakfast at a Holiday Inn.  The cappuccino, while not horrible, is likewise from a machine (you won't need sugar), not a barista.  That's forgivable to me, but not at the ~$6 they charge.  If you are trying for an Italian authenticity, you can't do it without teaching staff to make espresso and cappuccino at a minimum, and don't insult me by pricing like its the real thing when it isn't.  Even a regular black coffee refill will cost you full price ~$3.  It will also refill the landfill, given the amount of garbage created from one cup of this pre-measured capsule stuff.  I suggest dumping the Marriott Courtyard lobby machine and sticking to the real thing.  I hope they change this, I'd love to update and say this is fixed.

The music is usually the perfect level or conversation and is themed to standards of the Sinatra era, at least as of this writing.  It fits well.  The service is consistently good without being in your face all the time.  In short, great design, good menu with these minor quirks to work out.  The blind pig is great asset to its neighborhood.",H9gsKgn6zbabYX0MXmfW9w,6,0,4,AYdvduydq6va0fF7envtnA

We had meatballs for appies.  Have to say I can't tell the ingredients (beef, pork and veal) but they were not terrible either.  We ordered two sandwiches:  Chicken Ciabatta and BP Porchetta.  They were decent and flavorful, though the Porchetta was on the salty side.

Located in the Panorama Tower condo complex, Blind Pig is part convenience store, part bar and bistro. In the dining area you'll find plenty of comfortable seating, especially the booths, set amid a retro-chic prohibition era decor with views of City Centre across the highway.

The menu, as Block 16 is apt to do (see the Barrymore and Public House at the Venetian), features their modern take on approachable comfort food crafted with excellent ingredients. Always a sucker for pork, the crispy pork nuggets ($10) were a great way to start my meal. Unctuous, savory, deep fried cubes of pork covered in crispy skin were complimented with a sweet chili glaze and sriracha aioli that provided a bit of heat. That was followed by a porchetta ($13.50) sandwich with rich, but too oily, pork loin and belly in a crispy ciabatta roll.

Desserts are available, but they come straight from the cases and displays of the 'Provisions' side of Blind Pig. I should have let the coconut cake warm up a bit, but my sweet tooth couldn't be denied. The cake was stiff, as was the icing, but the flavors were very good. Next time, I'll have to resist the urge and wait to eat desserts at home. With their cases stocked with ready made and ready to cook products, there's plenty here for those wanting meals to-go.",C2C0GPKvzWWnP57Os9eQ0w,4,3,4,iigZ0poyzIGDPTLkuz6TDw

But I promise you I can be impressed, and when it does happen, even I get a little chill up and down my spine. 

If you hope to get my attention, especially with food, you better hit all the right notes at all the same time. From presentation and taste, service and atmosphere, right up to the bite you take out of my wallet, everything needs to fit just perfectly together if you hope to get a rave out of me. You can have the world's best food, but if I have to wait an eternity in line, or drop a small fortune, or suffer miserably apathetic service, then even the world's greatest food can suck.

But when everything you do fits perfectly together; when the food is good and the service is friendly and the price is a bargain, that's when you're doing things right. 

And then there are those rare occasions when all those elements come together, except the food is not simply good it's extraordinary, that's when you're going to start making some serious impressions in my book.

Imagine for me, if you will, a simple bacon cheeseburger. If you are like me, it always has been, and likely always will be, one of life's great guilty pleasures. 

Now imagine that simple bacon cheeseburger: with thick-cut smoked bacon, silky-smooth gruyere, arugula, and perfectly seasoned, grass-fed beef with just a hint of garlic aioli on top. Add all those elements together with the understated genius from The Blind Pig's kitchen and you have a bacon cheeseburger that requires no additional adornment, that challenges the lines of what makes a great burger. If you can imagine that (or better yet, if you can stop by The Blind Pig and try one for yourself) well then you will know firsthand what it takes to impress me - and I can promise you, I am very impressed.

Everybody knows you can get some really great burgers in Vegas these days, but I always find myself walking out wondering whether the extra cost and extra effort were really worth it. I will hold The Blind Pig's $12 ""BP Burger"" up against any burger in this town and say simply - ""beat that!""

We came back the following weekend, and its literally night and day here, no joke. Dinner service here is a bit unorganized. First, there is no hostess stand, so we waited...and waited...until one of the workers came from behind the counter and told us to wait (yet again) until a spot opens up.

We were lucky enough to get a comfy booth, and we took advantage of the Yelp check in offer of a free cocktail. I got the Blind Pig and don't remember the name of Wifey's drink, but it had Proseco in it. both were okay. We decide on the Poutine as a starter and split the Blind Pig Burger. Our waitress seemed overwhelmed at the amount of tables she had for her station, and actually the floor manager ended up taking and delivering our drink orders.

Poutine was kinda skimpy on the cheese curds, and the blind Pig Burger which I had raved about wasn't as good as when I had it during my lunch visit, a little more medium than medium rare. I guess when the kitchen gets slammed at dinner time, food doesn't really come out as it should? I probably would just return for lunch where there's no crowds and you can probably enjoy your order much better.

Roomie and I had a day off together and decided to brunch here with another friend. Weather was sunny and breezy so, it was perfect for patio dining. 

Walked into their café/grocery/market side and thought that was a super cute idea. How perfs for those living in Panorama to walk downstairs for their good Good of beer, wine, Moet, McConnell's ice cream, toiletries, even Tylenol (for the hangover and errthang).
The vibe and décor was very nice and hip and reminds me of LA. I hate saying that but, I feel like Vegas is becoming "" SO LA.""

We ordered crispy pork nuggets, lobster mac and cheese, ahi crunch salad, and fries.
There was nothing crispy about that pork, nor was it anything nugget-like. If you've had chicharron; it's nothing like that! Also, it tasted better w/o the aioli dipping sauce. 
Crunch salad was ok; I felt it was a bit too mayonaissey with not enough crunch. Seared ahi on the salad looked bigger on Yelp pics lol And it had NO taste, unless tasting ""mushy"" was a flavor.
Lobster mac and cheese was a best thing about brunch for me because I liked the  al dente pasta and light sauce. There was quite a bit of lobster and skrimp in there, too.

Actually, scratch my last comment about the lobster mac/cheese being the best thing about brunch --- THE VIEW of Aria, the freeway, and Vdara was the best thing about brunch --- and I'm not being sarcastic about it.

4-7pm is happy hour so my girlfriend and I decided to get a cocktail. $5 for the discounted price and it was a  pretty strong drink! I ended up getting something off their regular drink menu, the no sleep 'til Brooklyn. It tasted like a sweet cough medicine. I don't recommend it but at least it was strong! 

We got 2 orders of poutine, one with pork belly nuggets (+$3) and one without. If you like fried, crunchy, fatty pork I say pay the extra charge but I enjoyed it without just the same! This was the whole table's favorite part of the meal! It's so simple but they do it just right. For my main course I got the BP burger- gruyere cheese, bacon, arugula and garlic aioli.

However, my first time I had the BP burger and it was absolutely delicious. One of the best burgers I've ever had. The patty itself was pretty thick and they used a good quality beef which I think makes or breaks a burger. The bacon they used was so thick and crisp, to the point if I dropped it on the floor it would have shattered. I can't remember what the sauce was but I think it was some type of mayo/ayoli. They used arugula for the greens, which I thought was a clever touch. But overall this burger was amazing. If you are a burger fan definitely order this. Both times I was there we ordered the poutine primarily because it's Canadian thing and hard to find anywhere in the U.S. I am not a fan at all, but I guess I could say it was good.

I like the ambiance/vibe of the place and that they have a grab-and-go area full of pre-made food, including deli items like potato salad. Everything seems quite pricy though, so value proposition is definitely suspect.

As for our dine-in lunch, food was hit or miss. My kale salad was excellent. Friend's BP burger (ordered medium well) was severely undercooked. French dip sandwich was just meh, especially as the dip was pretty bland. Seared ahi tuna on the corresponding salad was not good - not sure if the tuna wasn't fresh or just poor quality. I didn't try the BBQ pulled pork sandwich but my friend said it was good. Orzo salad had really good texture but was painfully salty.

I get that cocktails are done in speakeasy style (hence the name of the establishment, I guess) but even for speakeasy style they seemed too sweet and overdone.

Service was OK, but definitely indifferent.

This seems like a spot that might be good for quick eats if you're in the area and don't want to head to the Strip, but you probably have to know what's good on the menu to make it worthwhile.

We shared pork belly nuggets, meatballs and shrimp and lobster Mac and cheese. Nuggets were A-OK. They tasted too much like a bottle of sweet chili sauce for my liking. Meatballs were tender and very flavorful. Mac and cheese was spot on - deeeelish! Creamy, dreamy and generous on the shrimp and lobster. We finished with the ultra decadent layered chocolate hazelnut dessert with salty crunchy bits and a anchor steam. Pure bliss.

Greeted promptly by staff, directed to a table, menus provided and beverage order offered to be taken. The waitress was cordial, personable, and attentive. We had several questions and requests to which she was able to accommodate. 

We ordered the pork nuggets, poutine, and I ordered a BP burger. The food came out at a good pace from appetizer to meal. 

The poutine was a nice balance of gravy, cheese and beer battered French fries. Not salty and not soggy was the poutine. 

Pork nuggets seasoned and topped with peanuts in a sweet thai style sauce along with a nice dipping aioli. The pork belly used for the nuggets were tender and not fatty. The combination of dip, seasoning, and likes sound like they wouldn't mesh well.  Surprisingly it was worth. 

The BP Burger I requested in medium was topped with arugula, cheese, tomato on nice soft roll. Choice of fries, salad, or upgrade to sweet potato. I elected the regular fries. 

Burger was cooked as requested. Appropriately seasoned to the accompaniments. Cooked correctly. Juicy and flavorful. Fries were beer battered. Good on their own and or with some ketchup.

Others in my group ordered the au jus. From what I gathered it was good. Not the best. Needed more horseradish. Made daily. Wasn't the spiciest. The au jus was a good sweetness and juiciness for the meat. Not overly salty. The crunch roll was just right for the hearty amount of tender beef. 

Bill settlement was quick and to the point. 

Good: execution on the point of food. Most things are made as ordered. Inexpensive and great value compared to the area. 
Bad: Just wish it was closer to the action of Vegas.

First of all, it's in the bottom of the Panorama towers. Location is ok because it's by the strip, but not subject to the parking and walking issues of LV Blvd. Walking up, it almost feels like you're in a regular city! Would be a bonus if it were on a high floor, to get a view.
There are two sides: the restaurant/bar side, and a fast/takeout side. It was pretty late when we arrived so the takeout side was already closed. 
We sat at the bar where the 'tender was friendly enough, but realized that we were in conversation and pretty much left us alone. The specialty cocktail list is pretty good, with vodka, gin, rum, whiskey and tequila drinks. Each is $10, so I think that's a pretty good 'specialty' price. The beer list has some interesting gems on it, with costs from $5-15. Plus points for having a 'draft brew of the week' for $5 each.
I confess that I didn't try the food yet, but I just loved the atmosphere and concept so much that I really want to return. And I want it to survive, which seems like it might be difficult in this location. I hope it does!

We arrived for a quick dinner before a show.  My only knowledge of the Blind Pig was from other Yelpers check-in's.  My experience wasn't tainted because I haven't read any of the reviews.  In other words, I came here ""blind"".  Service was a little less than average, but it's all about the food and drinks, right?  I got the BP Burger and requested it to be prepared medium-well.  I took a bite and realized it was more medium than medium-well.  I didn't complain because the burger was actually pretty good.  Complimenting my burger was a ton of sweet potato fries that were just okay.  I also got to taste my gf's Shrimp & Lobster Mac.  I could tell just by looking at the Mac that it was lacking a little taste.  In my opinion, their Shrimp & Lobster Mac can use a little more shrimp, lobster, cheese, and mac.  

Overall, I wouldn't say I'm a huge fan of the Blind Pig.  Ambiance is cool, their burger is pretty good, the service can be better, and the shrimp & lobster mac can use some work.  For now, they are just okay.",y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQ,9,7,3,FgVQYdDDCysr8D-fD7nemA

If you ask someone 3 times if they are okay after finishing dinner and they always say YES!, you really do not need to ask a 4th time.  All told, nothing I had would make me venture this close to the strip, but if you're in the neighborhood, it might be worth checking out.",rPRy7N3WCD3sVCrF60OOnA,4,2,3,IPnuAytMRjDHO7xkT1fp9A
4061465,2017-04-22,1,cOJ1uIVIHCiefUyWG2wDfw,"Visited: On a Friday at 12 PM for a lunch meeting

Service: 5.0 out of 5.0 Our server Nicole was very friendly and sat us outside as we requested.  She would stop by frequently to check on us, even after the food was served.  A work colleague of mine split an enormous Salmon Panini and they served it to us as two separate entrees.  We really appreciated them doing that for us.  See pics 

Value: 3.0 out of 5.0 Our crew's breakdown: $9.99 = Grilled Ham/Cheese or Turkey Club Sandwich.  Both came with a side salad.  The monster sized salmon panini was $11.99 and easily fed two. Bruschetta was at $7.99 and bottomless drinks at $3.00

Food: 4.0 out of 5.0.  I can speak only on behalf of the Salmon Panini which was tasty and a large portion.  The Honey Mustard dressing was amazing.  I should have asked if that was made in-house or purchased.  Very tasty

Ambiance: We sat outside this visit as the weather was nice but we've eaten inside and the booths are spacious and comfortable.  The tables are spaced appropriately and there are flat screens to watch sporting events.  The bar looks well stocked with high end booze and craft beers.  Looks like a great place to stop by for happy hour.  

Summary:  We've stopped by there for lunch 3 times and all visits resulted in a good lunch that got us out quickly.  Food and staff have always been solid and I'll have to visit for dinner and happy hour one day.",AyjqBovADgbskmLrIBOMlQ,6,2,4,hf33YqeQ2dbvZfH4y6QAjA

4078457,2015-01-12,0,cOJ1uIVIHCiefUyWG2wDfw,"My friends ordered two pizzas as appetizers for our large group. Meh, 'bar' level pizza at best. Not horrible, but even with the meat toppings it was bland and the dough was more closely related to bread dough than actual pizza dough.

I ordered the 'secret menu' pulled pork sandwich with sweet potato fries. There was nothing great about the sandwich, however, the BBQ sauce had a lot of sugar in it or maybe not enough vinegar. Hard to say. The highlight was the perfectly done sweet potato fries. $18.50 total.

My wife ordered the fried chicken plate with fries substituted for the mash. The chicken looked good, wasn't sitting a puddle of grease. However, it was just three pieces for $18. I asked my wife what she thought and she said it was good, but not $18's good.

Drinks were priced slightly hire than other places, but not terrible so. i.e. $7 for a pint of Bass ale.

Overall, it was just an OK meal. Two things that would bring me back was the atmosphere and the service, definite thumbs up there, however that really doesn't warrant me making a trip there. I'm sure this place is a life saver for those who reside in the towers and probably the main vein of their revenue.",HAFTRawn2sz909EbdVt5wQ,0,1,2,Z6y8oVc87YURYyae4PuPvw

4191647,2014-03-31,4,cOJ1uIVIHCiefUyWG2wDfw,"Again this was recommended from the bartender at the Barrymore. 

We were excited to visit once we saw the menu. It was during ConExpo and we had clients with us from NYC. Luckily we cabbed it over *never ever drink and drive in Vegas!* because there was zero parking in front. 

You enter though the ""deli"" section of the restaurant - more on that later and then off to the side is the bar/restaurant portion. 

Total Fail: the seating is awful. The choices are tables with tiny armed seating OR squished booths. 2 people of our party were well over 6'5"" and the booths just didn't work. The only waitress in the place was either clueless or had never seen tall or chubby folks before because when asked if they had armless chair she just shrugged and walked away to continue the chat we interrupted upon entering. The bar would have been an option but there weren't 4 seats together. We solved our issue by - wait for it. Removing the extremely large table from the booth and replacing it with the smaller but more accessible table from the center. 

Not one person stopped us. 

So NOT fatubulous! 

The ambiance:  trying to ignore the above issues, it's a very pleasant looking space. I mean when you over look the interstate running right outside, you get a nice view of the backside of Harmon tower before it falls down. 

The Drinks: Short. and expensive. *see attached photos of the bloody mary* - we had 3 rounds x 4 - $138.00 

The Food: We just ordered appetizers since our waitress was basically non-existent so busy flipping her hair that one of our group actually had to go to the bar to order another round of drinks & get food menus. 

Pork Nuggets: genius! Perfection. (3 orders) 

Meatballs:  all were good but it would have been nice to know which ones were which.. pork/chicken/veal - all slathered in a tasty sauce but couldn't tell the difference in the meats. It could have been 80% beef and I wouldn't know because the sauce made them delicious. (3 orders) 

Chicken Wings:   The only thing I'm going to say about this is that it was an ample serving. After the 1st one we packed them up to go. They tasted much better cold. 

Service: There were 2 bright spots in the service: 1 was the 'busboy' who brought out our meatballs & was willing to at least ask the chef which was which. (and turns out, couldn't determine that either)  & the counter girl in the provisions section. She was extremely nice & helpful when we were leaving. 

Otherwise it was a total fail. The one waitress working was attached by an invisible bungee cord to the end of the bar where she was animated & giggling at every word the 2 guys seated there & the bartender said. On the few occasions when she bothered to come over - she was surly and downright rude. I mean how dare we interrupt her social swish. 

Total bill:  3 rounds of drinks & appetizers 219.00. *and yes we left standard tip just to show we are better than her service* 

It's really too bad as we have a friend to lives next door in the Martin and it would be a great spot to meet up for lunch or cocktail hour.  He too is 6'6"" and quite frankly wouldn't be bothered trying to fold himself into the booths/chairs currently available. 

Of the Block 16 places we've tried (and you can read our reviews of LBS, Holsteins, Barrymore, and Pinks etc) this is a huge disappointment for us. As a local, I'd never go there again. Can it be sustained on just the tenants of the Panorama & Martin? Maybe. Time will tell.",Y9kqjPcj-QCsH48PWATQ3g,3,0,2,DgW7O4DUmS7xSCb8f2Oc-A

We went for the prime rib special they offer on Saturdays. We didn't have a reservation and since it was fight night we had to sit outside since nearly every table inside was reserved. The waitress didn't really seem to know the menu very well. The special said it came with a salad, potato, and sautéed spinach. 

The prime rib was flavorful, but almost too flavorful - I was instantly skeptical. I think they sautéed it in a pan with some seasonings because it was still cold.

Blind Pig is a cute lounge/bar/cafe in a weird part of town (too far from the strip for tourists, too out of the way for locals). It seems like a good chunk of their customers come from the high rise next door. 
Parking was not a problem when we went (Sunday 7PM), however I can see it being a problem if they were busier. The Blind Pig is NOT in the high rise next door, don't accidentally drive into their lot! 
You get a free cocktail/coffee/smoothie with Yelp check in (Sorry, no beer). However, we were told that they were in the process of ""changing their cocktail menu,"" thus didn't have the ingredients to make any of the cocktails on the menu. We asked if we could substitute it for a beer- told no, asked if they could make us a cocktail with whatever ingredients they had- told no. Hope that issues been resolved!

The restaurant was not busy and she only had 3 tables and had a helper so not sure if our waitress was new and in training . Her helper was the one that was nice to us though. 
My friend has a severe seafood allergy and was asking the waitress if there was any cross contamination with the grill, spatulas etc. The rude waitress commented in her smart aleck attitude "" our breakfast is not cooked in seafood!"" and just laughed about it. Well severe food allergies that send you to the hospital are a serious matter! That's nothing to laugh about! 
My friend ordered a mimosa and the rude waitress said "" I can't make that because our bartender is not here"" then she decided to bring it after all. Seriously it's not rocket science to pour some champagne in some OJ.
I had asked for my Oj again that she forgot to bring and she rudely said ""When I catch up with everything then I'll bring it!"" I ordered eggs with hash browns because that's what it says in the menu. She rudely said ""We don't have hash browns, we have potatoes!"" ... well then it should not say hash browns in the menu! She could have said nicely "" I'm sorry we don't have hash browns today but would you like potatoes instead?"" Seriously this waitress needs to go back in training and learn how to give good customer service and leave the sour attitude at home! Not impressed with the food. The potatoes tasted old and microwaved and so did the burnt bacon. She never even brought us butter and jam for our dry toast. She did not even ask how everything was. The only reason why I left a tip was because I felt bad for the nice young lady that was helping her. Not impressed at all! We won't be back.",HiQbe0lJLGkNg5OBS2cwSw,0,0,1,m3gGLQCWCYqNW7eeQg9z0w

What a disappointment - ordered 2 items I've ordered in the past - steak sandwich & a burger & both were horrendous! The burger literally had a generic store bought bun that I wouldn't even use if I was BBQ'ing burgers - top bun didn't fit & bottom bun was non- existent. The steak sandwich that I couldn't quit raving about before is now a greasy mess loaded with green peppers - not even reminiscent of the one I had here before. This was more like a bad Philly not to mention both the burger & steak Sammy came wrapped in low budget foil so the cheese on the Sammy was stuck to the foil & the burger was completely smashed. Prior orders came in plastic boxes with see-thru covers & the fries didn't used to come in brown paper bags. SO low budget. We were very excited to order from here since past deliveries were amazing but I won't order here again after this experience. If it was only a little off that'd be forgivable but this was like a diff place entirely! 
& here we thought we had a new go to place but much like everything else in Vegas - it's a facade! They trick you by being so great just to pull out the rug from your feet & suck like everywhere else 

Good riddance Blind Pig idk if you changed management it just your cooks but you went from a solid A+ to a -F in my book -

4474310,2014-08-15,2,cOJ1uIVIHCiefUyWG2wDfw,"Alright, so whenever I eat at various restaurants I don't take much into consideration from friends...since everything is based on perspective. With that being said I was recommended to check out the Bling Pig by several friends, so we did.

Upon arriving we find, no parking. Where do you park? Under the overpass, in front...is there any other parking? A few cars were parked in red...we went into Bravo Tickets (business next door) and asked if we could park in one of their spaces, they were nice enough to allow this...but what if they hadn't...where were we to park?

Open seating in a small-ish location, but were comfortable with our choice. Server or manager (blonde lady in white button up) asked if we wanted to combine tables, since there was 5 of us...we declined but thanked her for the offer. We placed our drink order then shortly after we placed our appetizer order:

Pork belly nuggets - amazing
Poutine - you can't go wrong with gravy cheese and crinkle cut fries
Quesadilla - meh, wasn't impressed...I think I just didn't like the cheese
Chicken wings - usual hot sauced wings

We then order our entrees: 

Shrimp and lobster macaroni and cheese - incredible
Steak frites - great prep, and tasted great

So far so good...right? No, I haven't mentioned the waitress...server...busser...manager...?

Ok, so we have 3 people assisting us...cocktail waitress, whom never asked if we wanted another round. The server...she was hit or mainly miss...we asked 3 times for refills on sodas...my girlfriend ended up going to the bar herself for the refills. Our busser, Michael, was on point. I think maybe he needs a promotion as he helped us more than either of the other 2. Come time for our bill...the server as well as the cocktail waitress are talking in the back by the bar. I raised my had and waved like I was in grade school...nope that didn't get their attention. Luckily Michael had walked by and I asked him for the check, which he was able to break the 2 up from their conversation and the cocktail waitress brought over our check....she collected shortly after. We wait...we wait...we wait....server drops what looked like a check to another table then walked outside...the cocktail waitress was who knows where...10 minutes later i go to the bar and ask the bartender for our checks...he looked confused but wanted to help, looks back then says oh it's right here....seriously? Not his fault by any means, but why didn't the server or the cocktail waitress bring this out?

I would love to go back, but it'll be a last choice if I do. Although one of my friends, whom dined with us, mentioned the bar staff was on point and their service was much better and they were very attentive. So maybe we'll go back and sit at the bar or just ask for Michael to assist us.",J3OIm59Uhfmd0pVVNDd2IA,3,0,3,4tTtTQ_CD8fnfCJxY5b9iQ

Oh wow was this good and just a super chill speakeasy type atmosphere with delicious food and bomb drinks!

One thing I've noticed about Yelp is that you really can find some awesome places when you pull up the local feed in areas that your unfamiliar with this was no exception and a great find!

When we first walked in it looked kinda like a deli that had some grocery type goods with a few chairs and a counter but as soon as we looked to the left we could see that there was a whole other room behind the curtain giving it a kinda hidden feel from the front.

We sat down and started browsing the drink menu even though at this moment I wasn't really feeling a cocktail they sounded delicious and unique as well as free with check-in! You could also order a few other drinks for free with your check-in of those a smoothie sounded delicious and it so was packed with berry goodness all around!

It's kinda dark inside too so it provides a bit of a ambiance that's perfect for a mellow night and why my pictures are dark I didn't feel like it would be right to use a flash here and disturb other patrons.

For dinner I decided to order a Steak Sandwich it was super good the steak was cooked perfectly full of flavor and went well with the garlic aioli sauce that was on the delicious bun!

My lady ordered a pesto type pizza with white sauce it had broccoli, olives, onions and other delicious toppings not knowing how big it was the pizza was definitely enough for two of us which ment we got to bring some back to the hotel and oh was it good later in the night after a few drinks!

This is an awesome establishment with delicious food and a great vibe to keep it mellow I would highly recommend coming here if your looking to get away from the strip for a bit and enjoy yourself!

Ordered a salad yesterday for delivery. When she arrived she gave me the total and I was taken off guard. $22? There was a $3 service fee, ok. Well the prices that are listed online are not the same as what they charge. I was not happy, but paid the girl and she left. I opened the salad and saw there was no dressing provided and no dressing on the salad. Normally I wouldn;t care, but I'm in the process of moving and had no salad dressing and the salad was also $17. I called back and was told they'd send the delivery girl back over with the dressing (I'm next door) as soon as she got back. I wait 25 mins and call back and the delivery girl answers saying there was dressing on it and if I wanted more I should have asked. She brought the dressing and snarkily handed it to me. I get it, it's an inconvenience to bring the dressing, but it's your job. You're not a volunteer, it's your job ... that you are paid to do. As a reasonably intelligent adult, I feel confident in my ability to assess whether or not a salad has dressing on it and don't need to argue with someone about it, it's silly.

Environment: it may have been bad timing, but it seemed like this place was better during the evening. The set up was nice with some hipster decoration. It seemed like a nice place to grab a drink with a friend after work.

Service: it did take a while for the waitress to come. I don't blame her though. It wasn't very busy, about 10 customers I total, but the waitress pretty much had to take care of everything and seemed overwhelmed. I also asked her about a food option, in which she responded with ""if it's not in the menu, then we don't have it"". I feel like she could have been nicer about it.

Food: I ordered the steak sandwich, which was good but the bread was very hard. I also ordered the fettuccine carbonara which was pretty overall. It was creamy and the shrimps taste good with it.

Overall, I feel like it may have been bad timing. I wanted to grab lunch with my friend who was visiting, and it seems to be better for cocktails than food and better in the evening than during the day.",6n3aU2lfldd5w4kP15OqpA,1,0,3,TBY_Z7DsRaYLh5sgX_fJqw

With only having maybe 3 other tables and having the manager clear our plates there was no excuse to leave us waiting so long for our check.. Specially when we were on our lunch break.

4787095,2015-05-20,0,cOJ1uIVIHCiefUyWG2wDfw,"Another one of Vegas hidden gems. Located on the first floor of the Panorama Towers right across the 15 freeway from the strip, and they offer their own private parking spaces. I can see men liking this place the most, due to their big portions, beer, and their brick decorated walls and lounge setting. It is a self seating restaurant, so just pick a table because there is no hostess.

The menu offers your typical bar/American food, including appetizers, salads, sandwiches, burgers, large entrees, coffee, smoothies, and cocktails. The Blind Pig is not only a restaurant, but they offer other prepared meals to go, or you can call in for your food and pick it up.

I ordered a BP Burger which includes Gruyere cheese, thick bacon, arugula, served with french fries. My friend ordered a chicken chopped salad, my favorite part about it is the vinaigrette they use.",-gSz76_bKNJsKM2adr12yw,1,1,4,mazcc55vhCor-piGwArTUQ

Our server Nicole was nice & we did have a party of 9 but I only got my water refilled once, after having to ask for it. When I ordered my prime rib I hadn't realized she never asked me how I wanted it cooked, until I got my steak which was cooked well. Far overcooked from the medium rare that I like. 

When it comes to the food the calamari was just okay. The prime rib was over cooked & just not very good. Tasted like a cheap cut of meat & not worth the $30. The pasta side was good but when I asked for what the side options were I chose pasta because she offered it & did not tell me it's an extra $3 for it. I don't mind the price but let people know ahead of time. The cheesecake was good & the chocolate cake was a little rich for my taste. Honestly the best thing here was the pretzel bites.

4958051,2015-11-20,0,cOJ1uIVIHCiefUyWG2wDfw,"Very cool spot between the Panorama Towers and The Martin behind City Center.  I had a late breakfast/early lunch with a buddy at the Bling Pig on a Friday.  The place was empty, but a few customers came in the market side of the business.  We sat down and were immediately approached by a server.  She was very friendly, and was throughout the meal.  Refills were prompt, as was the check.  Great service throughout.  The restaurant side is very comfortable, but non-descript.  It's like what a TV set of ""location:  pub"" would look like.  That said, I didn't have any problems with it.  It has a nice bar, TVs, and plenty of additional seating.  

I went with the meaty wrap, which is scrambled eggs, cheese, sausage, bacon, and ham in a tortilla with a side of breakfast potatoes.  It was a great deal for $8.  The wrap was fresh, it was still steaming when it was brought to the table.  And, it is certainly packed full of meat and cheesy goodness.  The cheddar was in every bite, which was nice.  The eggs were scrambled well and weren't overcooked.  The tortilla could have used some crisping on the exterior.  A minute or so on the flat top with a little butter would have added a ton of flavor and made it look nicer.  The breakfast potatoes were fine, they needed additional seasoning.  But, average.  Overall, it was a strong breakfast, and like I said, a good value for $8 given the amount of food.

I also tried the shrimp and lobster mac n cheese.  There is plenty of seafood in it, you should get some in every bite.  It was topped with breadcrumbs, which is always a good idea, but they weren't toasted enough under the broiler.  They needed a little longer to really crisp up to give some texture.  I liked the sauce, but it was a little lacking in flavor.  The menu states it's a ""mascarpone cream sauce with fontina.""  I would agree with this, those are good cheeses but not the most flavorful.  I would invite some of that cheddar from the wrap to the party, or at least some parmesan.  I'd order it again, but it needed a good helping of pepper and hot sauce.

Overall, cool joint, I would return.",JXHrhT72U6sZJQSkFfNzjw,0,0,4,P_ekFVlKhD4h0o-_BfAxcA

My only issue is the cost.  The price point is a touch too high for their food.  I understand that it is necessary to have higher fees because of their location and hours but Its about $1 too high on almost all products.  I had a turkey sandwich that was amazing but priced at over $12... its not worth it.  I don't mind spending on good food and everything seemed fresh.  Plus, I would love to make it a regular place that I frequent but I don't know if this price is worth it.  However, I will definitely be back (maybe not as often as I was hoping) and I would still highly recommend it.

Note:  I didn't try the pizza... hopefully that will change my mind.

My other small issue (and this may be because it just opened or because I completely missed it) is that the products on the shelves didn't have the price.  Awesome that they even sell some of these items, but it seems odd that its not tagged or easy to find.  I'm sure this will be fixed soon.

Very cute and trendy spot. Menu is simple which made it even harder to make a choice. EVERYTHING sounded delicious! I ended up getting the French dip style roast beef sandwich. It was very good, I loved fried onions on it they made a welcome addition to the sandwich. It could have used a tad bit more of horseradish on it but overall it was good. My friend had ordered the burger and I was able to snag a bite... It was to die for. So good. The bacon added just the right amount of smoke to the burger without over powering the burger itself. We also ordered a couple of the signature drinks which were good as well. 

The only drawback I can say was the price it's a little on the pricey side for a burger or sandwich which side choices are coleslaw or potato salad. But regardless of the price I will definitely be back! I'm already craving a burger.

The Blind Pig also sports a great free check in item in which you can get a free juice, smoothie, or coffee, not sure about cocktails, but the free smoothie is definitely worth it. 

I went with a banana strawberry yogurt smoothie, the smoothie tasted creamy, fresh and delicious, it was a nice balance between the tart and sweetness of all 3 things. I shared the crinkle fries with cheese curds & gravy and some crispy pork belly nuggets. The fries with cheese curds & gravy were good, although they were not crinkle fries as was indicated on the menu, the waiter did inform us that they had changed it to regular fries months ago, but never changed it on the menu. The crispy pork belly nuggets were seasoned in some dark sauce that tasted sweet, the pork belly wasn't super crispy, there were bits that were and some that weren't.

5215150,2015-07-29,1,cOJ1uIVIHCiefUyWG2wDfw,"This is my third and probably the last time I'll come here. Appetite got so ruined by this time's tall waitress. I think her co-worker called her ""Vanessa""? Yelp says ""Ambience: romantic""?yeah, ONLY when a server does a DECENT or higher job and this chick ruined every ounce of it. There's something wrong with her one way or another. I usually let ill-mannerism and mistakes slide up to three times, because I understand that everyone forgets to do an attitude check or get overwhelmed by their day. It started from the moment we walked in. She was all the way at the far end of the restaurant just staring at us for a while AND THEN nodding her head sideways (to imply we should walk over there and save her any efforts). She didn't even ask if we wanted the perfectly available booth or any other table; out of the confusion from her silence and unmoved figure, we just sat down at the table closest to her since she was too lazy to walk towards us and with us. She did not act anywhere near similar to how the other servers (from my previous visits) had acted; heck, it's not even the way any DECENT waiter or waitress would act at any restaurant regardless of the type of dining place. She was not at all informative; partially because she chose to not be informed, herself. She made no efforts into explaining anything. My friend and I kept trying to ask her questions and she would ALWAYS disappear immediately without a care to let us FINISH saying what we were trying to say. Every time she was obligated to talk to us (probably to fool her co-workers into thinking she's even a decent waitress since she's so two-faced and LOUDLY asking how we were doing as if her volume was on purpose), she always acknowledged my friend and treated me like I was invisible. I had to keep trying to get her to look at me since I knew more about this place than my friend did and I knew how to word things more clearly and briefly than my friend did. Lady, I was trying to make your visits to our table easier FOR YOU. My friend didn't know what the heck he was trying to say to you and you constantly gave him your ear with an eager smile and bullshited response. Every time I tried to help him get to the point, you'd just give me a your constipated expression. If your selective hearing can't hear me, than just tell me to speak louder. If you don't know what we are trying to ask you, then ask us for more details and actually LOOK at what we were trying to show you on our tablet/smartphone (yelp app check-in offer) instead of constantly walking away prematurely. To add, she always talked to us from far away: from the counter, from the other tables, or while walking around..instead of taking just a LITTLE bit of more time to walk to our table and stand there like she should be. Whatever her reasons for being so rude and improper were, she had no right to keep it up for the WHOLE time I was there. It may be my imagination, but my observations find that she was biased towards people who obviously have money. For example: a nicely, but casually-dressed elderly white couple and, my 100% asian friend who looks 100% white and was dressed all spiffy in his button-up, vest, and fedora. Then, there's me, a 20-something Asian wearing no brand names and looks like a middle-schooler. I may be a student/Asian, but either way I'm not stereotypically stingy on tips in case you thought there was no point in treating me as an equal to my friend. By the way, I called this place a few hours prior and asked if they're usually busy Saturday evenings. They said no. So, it's not a solid excuse to say ""Vanessa"" was busy. There were plenty of other employees here. These two of five stars belong to: the chef and the awesome guy (shorter than vanessa) with the apron that always comes out of the kitchen. On my first visit, he was the amazing server for my table. He and the majority of servers from anywhere UNDERSTAND how SIMPLE it is to kindly tell a table that he will be back in a few minutes if he were ever too busy to spare us even a measly SINGLE minute ON-THE-SPOT. Guy-in-the-apron, I admire you for being professional on-the-job regardless of what bad things may be going on in your life or refraining from any favoritism towards patrons. That tip WE left was meant for the guy-in-the-apron. We kept it really small in case the sucky waitress wasn't required to split it amongst the group and got to keep it; she deserved zero tip after the 6+ moments of shitty service she gave. Speaking of which, she didn't give us time to finish asking for the check. We wanted it split. No matter how much I love the Poutine and the Crispy Pork Nuggets here, it's not worth coming back if the appetite is just going to get ruined to the point where WE can't taste anything.

We definitely appreciate good food that is close to the fun of the strip without being right on the strip. This restaurant is like the hidden gem we have been looking for in terms of good food and a cool, nice yet casual atmosphere. The ambiance was awesome with the dim lights, nice music, and funny pig artwork, and the booths were both stylish and comfortable in the bar setting. It's not so much a restaurant as it is a lounge area that serves food... When we walked in we didn't see any host stand... and there was a bar top with tvs that were playing basketball on one side of the room so we assumed we just sat ourselves. But we were able to choose our own seats immediately after entering at dinner hour on a Saturday night and had great service. Everyone was very helpful and nice to make suggestions. We ordered the pork bites for an appetizer and both got the steak sandwich for dinner. The app was amazing! It was a rather small portion but for two people sharing it before dinner it was good to taste. :) it was a little spicy and very flavorful and it was half off during happy hour which lasted the length that we were there (from 5 to almost 6:15). 
The entree was also great! It was very flavorful and not skimpy on the steak at all. And the fries were also up to par. :) we also ordered wine that was on the happy hour price list.. A good glass for $4. We liked that a lot too because we usually don't see happy hour wine specials when we go out. The lounge/dining area was clean and comfortable and all of our food met (if not exceeded) our expectations.

Because we're two tiny women, we both shared a margherita pizza. My co-worker also got a side of onion rings. I think they might need to re-think the margherita recipe. There wasn't any fresh mozzarella or tomatoes on this margherita pizza. It was a regular cheese pizza with basil leaves; and although it was good, it wasn't a margherita pizza! The onion rings were really great also.

The clams and the sauce and bread, delicious and fresh. The calamari was nice and crispy and the battered was perfect. I got the BnJ (I think that's the name) burger and added a fried egg. It definitely hit the spot and was huge!! I saved the other half for road. Our friends went with linguine and shrimp, Alfredo and shrimp and burgers. The pricing isn't that bad either, we all had two rounds each and we were a party of 6 and the bill came out to $280 with gratuity.

5312732,2016-08-19,1,cOJ1uIVIHCiefUyWG2wDfw,"Meh... My boyfriend took me here for a random date night because he used to eat here when they still had Poutine and Lobster Mac on the menu (which apparently were very popular). 

The decor of the restaurant has a big jazz feel to it. It'd be a great place to take a date; very dim lit, velvet booths with accent pillows, so it's very intimate for dinner time. 

Pretty much every entree on the menu ranged from $15-$20, aside from their fish of the day options which were $25. By their prices I expected that their food was going to pretty good, or at least nothing to complain about, but boy was I wrong...
I ordered the Lobster Raviolli ($18.99) and my boyfriend ordered the catch of the day-Salmon $24.99. There were exactly 5 pieces of raviolli on my plate, which were all swimming in sauce. The lobster taste was pretty much undectable, and for $18.99 for some damn raviolli, I'd like to taste some lobster. My boyfriend's salmon had a side, which I can't remember what it was so apparently it wasn't anything speciail lol, the salmon seemed to be only seasoned with salt and pepper and was extremely bland. My boyfriend's a big fan of salmon and he didn't even bother to finish his meal, it was that unimpressive.

The funny thing is, a LOT of people say the same thing about The Blind Pig; it's not the same since they've been under new management, the quality of the food isn't great, and the popular menu items are no longer there. 

The reason why I gave this place 2 stars rather than 1 is because the service was great. Our waitress was attentive and friendly, even though she was obviously the only one working the floor. 

If I were to come back, I'd come back just for the bar area. Their bartenders seemed entertaining and their signature cocktails looked good.",AWt-4_RGNqz9u2T8XfOy9g,4,0,2,CHQ8WUvuNBIP5OGncnDZ1g
5319125,2014-03-11,4,cOJ1uIVIHCiefUyWG2wDfw,"I like the lounge-feel interior of this place. Bricks, plush seats, curtains and interesting ceiling. They have a pantry where they have beer, wine and other libations as well as items you'd find in some pantries (fig almond cake, Nutella, pasta, real mustard, red pepper tapenade, etc.). They have Veuve and Moet! They have a deli section which has orzo pasta, couscous, salads, sandwiches, cheesecake, monkey bread, brownies, cookies (chocolate protein cookies even!), Nutella pound cake, and other desserts. Then, there's the bar and dining area. On the menu they have: appetizers, pizza, sandwiches, salads, pasta, steak frites, shrimp and lobster mac and cheese, salmon, ahi tuna, roasted chicken, smoothies and coffee.

Chocolate Hazelnut Verrine:
This has got to be my Blind Pig favorite. Layers of delicious light chocolate mousse and sweet, nutty and crunchy brittle. 5/5

Orzo Pasta:
It has a tiny bit of a tang and minty-ness - just enough to make it taste interesting. The texture is just right. It has olives, red onions and tiny bits of feta. 4/5

Nutella Pound Cake:
I love pound cake and to add Nutella to to the batter is pure enjoyable madness! It's filling and delicious. Buttery cake with sweet chocolate hazelnut swirls. 5/5

Shrimp and Lobster Roll:
I got this with a side of French fries. They use Oreida frozen fries - booooo! This had no flavor. The roll was toasted but it has no butter - maybe, they're health conscious? I really don't know but if I wanted something healthy, I'll eat a salad. 2/5

Porchetta:
POR-KE-TA...not porch-eta...not porsche-eta. C'mon! I enjoy a good porchetta sandwich. That fat and oil with herbs, spices and salsa. My favorite version though has crispy skin and this one did not and tasted a bit much of fennel seeds. They are generous with pork portions though. 3.5/5

Skip the fries and the kombucha drink! Try the blackberry hibiscus drink though.",tH0uKD-vNwMoEc3Xk3Cbdg,9,4,4,7tSykUrCOvAQcxJnNIajQg

The menu was fairly large with lots of options. I ordered mozzarella wedges, chopped salad and chicken parmesan. I also ordered what I thought was chocolate mousse. Delivery was well within the time frame provided and the delivery guy was polite and quick. All the food was packaged well (with Italian, this is always a factor to me). Only problem, no utensils and no salad dressing. Bummer. The mozzarella was still hot and marinara clearly homemade. I tried the salad with no dressing and it had so many toppings, it wasn't bad. I bet the dressing would really have made it. The chicken parmesan was good and the linguine was served on the side - also good. It wasn't as warm as I would have hoped, but I had to go search for utensils. I'm saving the cake since it surprised me. I thought it was mousse but it was chocolate layer cake.

Well, when we came in on a Sunday for lunch, there were plenty of open spots designated for The Blind Pig, and there was even an overflow area on the other side of the lot which still had some spaces available as well.  

Also, another thing I must mention, make sure to check in on Yelp and show your free drink offer to your server!  You can select from their juices, smoothies, and signature cocktails if I recall correctly.  

The restaurant was about half full when we arrived and we were given our choice of seating.  We selected a nice comfy booth.  I was worried that it would be tight after reading one of the reviews but it did not feel squished at all.  We were greeted promptly by our server and our food and drinks came out right away also.  We split their shrimp and lobster roll and shrimp and lobster mac and cheese.  Both dishes were good - we finished just about everything!  We maybe had some fries left over, which were maybe the best part of the meal - nice and crisp!  

Service was just okay, but overall, a nice solid meal at The Blind Pig.  They posted a picture on Instagram of a po boy sandwich they were serving after we had dined there.  Would've tried that if it were available!  But still a great lunch, and the free drink was a nice plus to our meal :)",KxRf-umHzdz5noKH5Cg6Mg,0,0,4,bQYfFD0uqt3Vh2KDwB0JGw

We walked in and were seated right away. It was crowded but not packed. Service from beginning to end was very courteous and attentive. Our iced teas were refilled several times and the food came out fairly quickly. 

Now the reason I came here was to try the poutine. I've always heard of it but being as its a Canadian dish I had to try it. It did not disappoint. Fries with gravy and cheese curds just sounds so indulgent and rich. It was really good. The only problem I had with the dish was that it was pretty salty. The added gravy only made it saltier, and I like salty food. I couldn't finish it but I did enjoy it. I had the bacon and eggs too, which was good but you can't really mess up bacon and eggs, but if you do I will find you. And I will kill you. My brother had the prime rib dip and that was super good. I wished I had gotten that. 
Everything is great about this place, the decor, the service, the food. The only thing stopping me from five stars is its a little over salted, and that's coming from a guy that usually adds salt.",I0JqG0FOL1FXDTTi_VVJhg,2,0,4,4RtM_If3AJ9hji6pDF8Akg

We were able to make reservations which was great and when we arrived we were seated in a comfy booth on the bar side. The decor was great. A lot of TV'S I am assuming it is a big game day hot spot. Which we aren't huge sports fans so it was a little disappointing that the sound for the basketball game was on and not just playing and silent with music playing instead. Had we sat more on the restaurant side or even outside on the patio it would have been the same since there were TV'S everywhere you looked.  That is the only reason I gave a 4 and not a 5.

We ordered the hot artichoke and spinach dip with chips to start and 2 rum and pineapples. The dip was hot and packed full of more artichoke hearts than spinach which is rare...normally other way around. So off to a good start :) my man ordered the Italian beef sandwich with fries and a side salad. I ordered the fish of the day which was halibut with a lemon caper sauce and veggies on the side...broccoli and potatoes...or I could have had sautéed spinach...and I also ordered a side salad...I wish I hadnt...the side salads were so big we could have shared one. So most of mine went to waste.  My man said that his sandwich was good but he hoped for more seasoning...but the meat was really tender. They serve the best meat here Boar's head...anything you order sandwich wise is going to be delicious. I truly feel that is the best meats around.  My halibut was cooked to perfection...it was a really nice piece of fish. The sauce was yummy, nice and citrusy. There was mushrooms in the sauce which I don't care for but they were big enough I could easily pick them off.

5567662,2016-03-06,0,cOJ1uIVIHCiefUyWG2wDfw,"I was hoping to rave about this place but unfortunately that is not the case. This place was probably one of my top 5 worse customer service experience ever! Let me try and paint the picture for you...
It was the spot we selected for a surprise birthday. Venue was very cute and quaint, with brick walls making me feel like there was a lot of history behind the building. Something you would see in New York. It was a Saturday and not busy at all. The restaurant had a different type of set-up, almost in a shape of an L. Our party of 10 sat in the smaller section. We had one server & later found out it was her first day. In the beginning majority of the party was going up to the bar to get our drink orders. The bartender informed us that if we are with the big party, our server will come to us. Fine, no big deal. It took the server about 15 minutes to make her way to us where she would only start with 3 drink orders at a time. Drinks slowly (key word) trickled out. Before making sure the whole table was good with drinks and even water for the entire party she started taking food orders. It wasn't to our knowledge that food orders weren't all taken nor placed until only ours came out. We are here for dinner, we all eat together! The server was very sweet but definitely needs more experience prior to working a big party let alone be on the floor by herself. She immediately informed the staff. Next thing we know the bartender is coming to take our order. He says 'everyone needs to sit down so I can get food orders taken and in at the same time'. I chuckled about this. He made it seem like it was our fault the server couldn't do her job. Again, some orders were placed now for the second time. Throughout this whole waiting period, our sever was not attentive at all. Multiple times I asked to make sure the whole table had waters, never came to check up on beverages. It's one thing that she is new but the restaurant had about 3 other tables to service. Where was the rest of the staff? Food finally came out and to be quite honest, I'm 99.9% sure that the food we sent back the first time was now in front of us for the second time. We ordered the chicken pesto pizza and lobster Mac n' cheese. Both dishes were cold! The sauce of the lobster mac n cheese was thick and all saucy at the bottom; as it was just sitting out. Neither of them looked freshly made. And the comical part of it all not once did a manager come out and apologize. I was baffled at this establishment and their lack of customer service recovering. With all the constant back and forth and searching for our server and informing her of what we need, no one said or did anything. 
Bills were spilt and came back with the first couple and charged them $11k. Aside from that amount actually authorizing the servers response was 'oh yea, I thought it looked funny'!! As bills were being settled lights were turned off. I understand we were there past 10PM, but that was not our fault. Have a little courtesy, Blind Pig and appreciate your customers a bit more!

5628314,2016-03-31,0,cOJ1uIVIHCiefUyWG2wDfw,"We have ordered from the Blind Pig many times, but the new menu selections are unappealing. My partner's favorite item on the former menu was the ""Blind Pig"" salad, but since it is no longer available, he ordered an Antipasto salad for pick-up. He said the new salad was loaded with high quality and delicious ingredients (the mozzarella and the meat), but it lacked an adequate amount of lettuce. I noticed this seems to be partly due to the fact that they are now using much smaller takeout containers (in plastic rather than the biodegradable choice they used to use).
The process of picking up food was also confusing- it was unclear where to pick up the food, and there was no host at the podium.
We hope our feedback is noted so that we can bring our business here in the future.",PDKeV8unuC9uKH1EK3OEPg,0,0,1,5ek7zU-PCYN8W_fkOJmLnQ

I looked here and they had a delivery they had pretty good rating so I decided to order. I ordered the lobster filled and it was really amazing like it was really good first of all delivery only came in 30 minutes and the food is very fresh,-bLjFKqIdLXQ8Ma9s7ZUsg,0,0,5,k_NlBmyH1lqAoZN4IektKg

My favorites include the Chopped Salad and some of their pizza dishes are great. They have lattes and other morning beverages which is nice and the service is always pretty good. I hear they have a good Taco Tuesday as well. Bon Appetit!",akgMrTkbtc80Coh4t5Kzpg,0,0,5,tlyqFWs2nBulTKE7dTh_JQ

5714921,2014-09-18,1,cOJ1uIVIHCiefUyWG2wDfw,"If you have read my other reviews, you will know that I LOVE Poutine. Generally when I am looking for some where to eat and my boyfriend is at the same time, my searches start with Poutine while his start with wings. The Blind Pig has BOTH.

The Blind Pig is so freaking cute!! I noticed it driving up the 15 headed for work once. It's kind of hidden on Dean Martin on the ground floor of the Panorama. I have since moved and this place isn't any where close to home, but I still make the trip. Worth it!

They have a fun little menu and awesome beer choices. The prices are pretty solid too. Nothing is worse than finding a place you like but it's too expensive for regular visits.

Parking can get crappy if it's crowded. The lot is pretty small. Also, remember it closes at midnight! So if you are looking for late night eats, you will have to stick with good ol' Peppermill.

Another interesting thing about the Blind Pig is the market and deli they have attached. I actually haven't stopped in because I usually head here late (and I don't believe the market is open), but it looks really neat!",UEeZ-eE63citRQIeqsQq1g,4,1,4,NQ0KDQwk5GAFfzOu4iNDvw

5757497,2014-06-28,2,cOJ1uIVIHCiefUyWG2wDfw,"Considering how empty the Blind Pig was during the Brunch hour, it left me feeling skeptical about the food. Located right next to the 15 Freeway are some new developing stores in Las Vegas. 

Ambiance (4.5 Stars): I love the decor and ambiance in the Blind Pig. It is a mixture of old style furniture with gold and black color scheme that gives off an elegance that you don't often get at many brunch places. There is a bar area, individual tables, and sofa seating areas that are very comfortable. The World Cup soccer match was on near the bar are and we were able to watch the games from our table.

Food (4 Stars): I ordered the Eggs Benedict with Asparagus and Crab/Shrimp; the dish was beautiful and tasty too! The hollandaise sauce was super buttery and complemented the seafood. There was also a side of potatoes that gave you a nice break from the richness of the eggs. The english muffin was crispy and not too soggy either. I would order this dish again.

We had meatballs as an appetizer and it was basically some large croutons with meatballs in tomato sauce. It was okay and the meatballs were pretty dry, but the sauce was yummy and wasn't overly sweet.

Service (4 Stars): The service here was interesting. There is always a waiter coming by the refill your water cup, that I could appreciate. Our waiter gave us the wrong menus to order from and we had to switch up some of our orders. It was an honest mistake and I could see that they were trying their best fix the situation. It was just kind of awkward. 

Bottom line: Compared to other places off the strip for brunch, this place is high up there. Good service and decent food.",G89MgEpjVkawmL1cMdM66w,3,2,4,9KRp2FThO7nGiRglCYKCdA
5773688,2015-03-04,2,cOJ1uIVIHCiefUyWG2wDfw,"My friend wanted to try this place. I'd never seen nor heard of it so it was a new adventure in the foodie quest. 

Located at the entrance to Panorama Towers, just down the block from Las Vegas Golf and Tennis and In and Out near Trop and Dean Martin. Not the easiest place to find, and seemingly out of place considering what we walked into. One side is a deli/mini grocery store. The other a really nice bar and about 14 tables for dinner. This place is non-smoking for those of you who indulge. They have a few tables outside giving you a beautiful view of City Center from the west side of I-15.

Impressive menu, high class furnishings, and friendly service. They've been there about a year and according to the bartender, busy nights vary constantly. When we walked in at 5:30 on a Monday, it was 3/4 full but no one sitting at the bar, so we sat.

A nice selection of beers, arranged on the menu by category. I had a Pissing Boy Belgian White Ale. My friend a Hoegaarten. We started with an appetizer of Crispy Pork Nuggets, which is pork belly in a sweet chili glaze, with a sriracha aioli, and peanuts. Delightfully crisp and light and loaded with flavor. 10/10.

I went with the shrimp and lobster mac and cheese, which the bartender told me was rich. I found it delightful, not overly sauced or cheesed, and delicious. Not nearly as rich as the mac and cheese at MadeLV. My friend went with the Prime roast beef sandwich and he said it was one of the best he'd ever had, the roll being soft and good. Overall these dishes get 9.5/10.

Prices are moderate. Upon check-in with Yelp you get a free drink, either coffee, soda, or signature cocktail. I went with the Blind Pig cocktail, which while tasty, was a bit sweet for me. 

Come and enjoy this nice quiet little place with great food. I'll be back for sure!",wXZS42D0L8hoCiSh2Krc_A,5,3,4,SBM_GWyJZ2wrkk_gdMDCtg

5840037,2015-01-29,0,cOJ1uIVIHCiefUyWG2wDfw,"The Blind Pig is close to my work that isn't too pricey like the strip or fast food crap that surrounds the area. I'm in love with the speakeasy steak sandwich! I've also had the BP Burger which was great but a burger is a burger to me. I have yet to order anything else but when I see other people's food come out it all looks great. But like I said I'm hooked on the steak sandwich. Every time I've ordered it I get medium rare and it's cooked perfectly never underdone or over. The steak is seasoned well, my fries are crispy. I enjoy their Bloody Mary too, nothing fancy there it's just made well and not with that mixed bottle tomato juice either. 
Now I must explain the 4 stars last time I went my waitress seemed preoccupied or something. She wasn't listening very well we had to repeat our order a few times to her. She didn't check on us very much so you had to grab her when you could. She would walk away and take forever to come back.

5888877,2017-09-06,0,cOJ1uIVIHCiefUyWG2wDfw,"Ok so a year ago I went Pescatarian but knew if I was ever gonna slip up and eat red meat it would be because the food was worth so here I am visiting a spot that I couldn't leave vegas without having my usual steak sandwich. Stepped in the joint and noticed things had changed around, I commented to the cashier and said well I hope the food is the same she didnt say anything and I should have taken that as warning. Food was sooo average and not worth it. The steak is more like a philly and bread was hard previously it was delightful fluffy ciabatta roll. When  I went back in to ask did I order the wrong thing?! She stated no things changed and then she should have offered to give me money back. So now I feel a certain way about the customer service. They were polite but if they would have said it changed prior I probably would have checked reviews and then said cancel my order.

I edited my previous review from 2 years ago and gave it 4 stars thought for a minute and wondered how were the rating still so high and thats when i went back and noticed I wasn't the only one so now Ive came back and it gets a 1. Like how do you change something sooo good. Yelp should require new ownerships to start fresh. I was going to contact them through their website but there is no contact form sooo ¯\_(?)_/¯ food is nasty we want the old owners back or at least the old food.",CO7AJm4tMCJrSOn7cnQhNA,0,0,1,ndunWYoPNGeDwLYt8K_vvQ
