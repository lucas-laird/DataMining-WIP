The positives were that they still had a number of items when I arrived at 4:30 pm, and the employee working was super friendly and helpful.

I ordered the pumpkin bread, cinnamon brioche, and bacon/cheese/jalapeno brioche. The pumpkin bread was unacceptably dry. It quickly ended up in the trash. It was cute, but I would rather it be hideous and delicious.

Where the pumpkin bread was dry, the brioche was the absolute complete opposite. It was like putting an entire stick of butter in your mouth. I am not joking when I say that the butter was dripping off of it. The flavors of the bread were overpowered by the straight butter. I must admit that I am not a fan of butter, but I love brioche. This brioche was the exception to that. Brioche in France was nothing like this. I took one bite of each and then was done with both. I can only imagine how many calories are in each bun. I don't know that I could have finished one, even if I had wanted to. 

The breads are also incredibly expensive. I get it: this is a labor intensive product. You deserve to charge a premium for this amount of effort. But for $5 per bun, it should be the best thing that I have ever eaten. It's sadly not. 

I'm sorry, Brioche, but I will not be back.",cgUCtSaxZ4Mt_3k691UU2A,2,1,1,tq2iurx9rHSNvmDGjSBrBQ

1391073,2016-12-20,1,1aMxCG33wAoxjWoeRsl4BA,"i've been a big fan of guy savoy--i've been to the paris and las vegas restaurants several times. and it's always a highlight when the bread guy comes by with the huge assortment of breads.  so i was happy to try the brioche stand inside caesars.

overall--at 730 am, the banana/nutella morning bun was stale. they did their best to heat it up to revive--but honestly, nothing beats the taste and overwhelming body reaction to fresh pastries. this was not one of those moments. even bouchon at the venetian is so much better than this. i am sad to admit that the donuts at America (inside NY NY) are far superior to this.

i've heard (though haven't confirmed) that the reason why the pastries taste stale are... because they ARE stale.  are they baked every morning or day? is there an oven pumping them out every 2-3 hours?  Try, maybe every 3 days I've heard.  That's why they have to revive them in the mini-oven.  Will you get a freshly baked pastry or a two day old one? If you like gambling in vegas, this is your bakery.  i am absolutely open to putting updated information here if someone from management can confirm that the pastries are baked throughout the day, or at least daily.  please tell me what time they enter the stand so i can go there and wait to buy fresh ones. 

the service people are nice enough but often not waiting around the register. i know it's boring to stand there--and there's work to be done behind those swaying doors. but i often wait around for 10-30 seconds waiting to see if the stand has been abandoned. when no one is there, it does look closed really.  

if i were guy savoy...i don't know if i'd feel good about this place with my name on it.  if you had really fresh pastries cycling in (like those humble donut stores in LA) throughout the day, then i'd be a huge fan and willing to put out the ""dough."" but i don't think they grill up a steak 2 days before at Guy Savoy and then reheat it for you when you order it today, right?

rule of thumb--if the pastries are good, there is usually a line. or constant turnover. there is no need to reheat fresh pastries.  there is hardly a line for this humble set up. if it were better, though, i'm sure there would be a line as the location is actually fairly convenient and the pastries sound/look good. i want to like it--but for $10.22 for a coffee and a small pastry--it's a bit of a disappointment given the brand.",9M8PtXcHhP5y4wgcR_Iv8w,5,0,2,jJcnr1q4WgP38pZrvUWoJQ

1656758,2017-07-08,0,1aMxCG33wAoxjWoeRsl4BA,"Brioche is a small little shop inside of Caesars Palace by Chef Guy Savoy that offers baked goods, coffee, and sandwiches.  The service here has been fast and friendly.  However, as one can imagine, everything is expensive on the strip so be prepared to spend at least $27 on two coffees, breakfast sandwich, and a banana.  If you check into Yelp and show the cashier your phone, you can get a free croissant, plain or flavored, heated up or cold.  My bf did enjoy their coffee and breakfast sandwich.  Other than that, I'll make this review short and sweet unlike my other reviews.  As someone who had to make a lifestyle change and become gluten-free, not by choice, Brioche does not have much to offer to the gluten intolerance crowd except for fresh fruits such as bananas.

The BRIONINI (panini made using brioche bread) comes in three varieties, I tried the ""proscuitto, tomato, and cheese"" ($13)- maybe it was the bread type, or maybe it was the grill not being hot enough, but the bread was so soft that the only thing making it a panini was the grill imprints. Flavors worked well together, but the proscuitto seemed more like deli ham than any proscuitto I've tried. 

Grabbed a trio of the beautiful sweet  and savory brioche (3/$13)- the peanut butter and jelly was totally plain as if I was given the wrong one, bacon cheese and jalapeno tasted like a mouthful of grease?, Nutella and banana recommended by cashier was generous with the chocolate but covered up any hint of fruit. They were all nicely flaky but SOOO greasy.  A short walk to eat them and the cardboard box was coated with oily film- perhaps the dough was under-kneaded? We did not finish any of them.

For such simple fare, I expected better execution, especially given the price point. I'd hesitate to come back for even a simple croissant and coffee until they've had time to improve.

Maybe it was because we went at 2PM but the brioche we bought were all dry and stale tasting (yet somehow there was a lot of oil stains in the box within the 5min walk back to our hotel room). I had the exotic while the BF had the Nutella. The exotic had large chunks of fruit which were a little hard to eat (they should probably cut into smaller pieces). I wasn't much a fan. The BF's Nutella look burnt and tasted dry w/ very little Nutella. BF took one bite of the PB&J (the only brioche not warmed up) and threw the rest away.

Definitely not recommended.",xoNpQ_DnzNuTbkFPPO0Lgw,4,2,1,0VhECskOuBKSM2JonN7Bsw

The coffee was ok nothing special. The brioche was really greasy. I am morbidly obese and from Indiana: This won't stop me. The brioche wasn't dry (something I wouldn't tolerate in a brioche) and the filling was as expected. If you had any sense of health the amount of grease might be a deal breaker.

I visited this location twice on two separate visits to Vegas. 
After seeing the Vegas prices I thought that maybe it had the Vegas taste.
It seems this is a one man stand and if there is any other customers, you should be prepared to wait.
I have tasted a latte from here and it seems like from reviews that it just depends on the barista. It seemed mine had burned the milk and it wasn't very pleasant. 
The chocolate cookie can't be too hard to mess up but it seems here it is a very thick almost cake like cookie that doesn't have much sugar in the recipe. It was not really my style.
On our recent visit, my boyfriend picked up three different sweet brioche's; Peanut Butter and Jelly, Nutella, and Cinnamon. It seemed that the Nutella was the winner. The cinnamon was OK but still needed some more sweetness. Maybe it is the american in me? The peanut butter and Jelly had some good flavor but there was only a small amount of jelly on the top for show and none throughout so it definitely needed more.

They have a really cool touch screen menu where you can browse through their products and their prices. They offer a variety of coffee and brioche. I looked over to the side where there are samples of what the pastries looked like which came in handy in terms of size and portion. 

I went with the Cinnamon Brioche! I was surprised to see how it was packaged... The cashier, while handling the food, basically mushed it flat as she was attempting to place the sticker on plastic wrapper.

Made a visit on 3/3/2018 - Saturday afternoon for coffee and a sandwich (literally a quick bite) our service was great!

Let me add that our guy Michael made our visit very pleasing.. here's why:

- By himself he was working it!
- Knew I needed my sandwich cut in half: I didn't even need to ask..he told me! 
- Provided my order with a bag and enough napkins (that's something I also ask..sometimes even at sbucks haha)

Damn.. I didn't even have to ask for anything.. :)

THANK YOU Michael!!",Z8H2jOfwmeDOuU111hcUOQ,20,19,5,uKBsWalGAcWU2yLEZNb64g
