While staying for a week, we ate here twice and probably would have more if we had known it was this good. It's also conveniently located near the Tower II elevators, so if you're staying there it's a good bet.

The first trip, I had the Ultimo Burrito which was very filling and delicious. Not too spicy, but flavorful all the same. Each dish comes with a healthy serving of tortilla chips and you get to choose your own dipping sauce at a little bar at the back of the restaurant.

On our second trip, I had the Cheese Quesadillas and we ordered a plate of Cheese and Bean Nachos to split. We were both filled to the brim with cheesy and bean goodness. If you walk away from this place hungry, it's your own fault. With drinks, our total came out to be around $21.

Staying at the Excalibur, are on a budget and don't want to eat at McDonald's every day and night? Eat at Baja Fresh, I'm willing to bet you won't be disappointed.",E1QOBdedBhMEPC5MblKY0w,2,0,5,XMBxuI6A-cHoDfal3LbOcQ

 I am someone who primarily eats protein and veggies; therefore, Baja Fresh is an excellent choice. I ate there twice while staying at Excalibur Hotel and Casino, which made it very convenient-- open 24 hours, too as it is located right inside the hotel doors near the Resort Tower entrance near the pool area. 

The first night I didn't go there, food was brought up to me by my boyfriend. It was chicken fajitas and they were of good quality, taste and flavor, and a great temperature. It is Vegas, and this location is located in a hotel on the strip, therefore the prices are high, but that's to be expected. 

The next night I went down late night and visited the location personally. There were a few transients there asking me for money, which again-- it's Vegas, and many drunk people passing out while they eat (people watching is fun)... I rather enjoyed the ambiance of the place. The people were friendly and the service was quick and good quality as well. 

I became the duke while I was there with only two check-ins. I thought that was kinda cool. 

I wish my home location in Boise, Idaho was as friendly and superior quality as this home.",kfAs5S1XGtZZyO0QCuXD_g,3,4,4,dPzlkDOS60TXDW7ikZNoSA

When I told my husband about this, he called this location to see if they take these gift cards, the male voice on the line said that they do not take coupons (**why is the website still sending me coupons that I can't use anyway?!**) but they do accept gift cards (my husband did not get a name).

I wanted to use the gift card before this one would be in danger of losing up shop too. We local residents only have one hour for free parking, just scan your ID. The restaurant is located next to Dick's Last Resort restaurant. It is a big location (lots of seating). The menu is on the wall at the ordering side. This one has breakfast items and is open 24 hours/ 7 days a week. Order on the left side. You can see the food being prepared and cooked. Pay at the counter. Get your drinks on the right side, alongside the napkins, forks, etc. and salsa bar- my fave is the mango salsa (my husband said it was wrecked, so this area needs attention). The rest of the restaurant was clean and I did notice the workers cleaning off the tables that were used. 

We could not use the gift card. The lady at the counter said that it was a difference franchise and they do not accept gift cards. She did give us a 20% discount though (it was nice of her to do that, hence the 4 star rating). My husband did tell her that he'd checked by calling ahead and spoke with a man, but didn't get his name.

I got the carnitas fajitas (a good size- choice of beans, choice of corn or flour tortillas, rice, onions & peppers, options were: cheese, sour cream, and guacamole, and came with chips) to share with our son, and hubby got a carnitas burrito. Ours was good, but the meat was cold (it was on top), while hubby's was contained in a burrito, but he did enjoy it. And so did our son (he loves meat, Mexican food, and Asian food). 

There were 3 or 4 employees working here, I don't quite remember if we got a greeting, but their demeanor seemed to be that they were there, working, but really didn't enjoy dealing with customers one on one- no smiles, no enthusiasm. I would say that this area of the operation needs work. 

Has a good customer base, there were quite a few other diners in at lunch time yesterday. I wouldn't say it was crowded but there are several other options inside the casino, so there was a good amount of people here. 

((Side Note: It's sad that these restaurants didn't seem to last against other Mexican restaurants. Like Chevy's, sad face, another one bites the dust. It was on our regular rotation of Mexican restaurants, but these days my fave is Rubios, and hubby's fave is Chipotle.

Got a chicken burrito w fajitas, rice, guac, sour cream, pico, cheese and all 3 bottle sauces(mild, medium, chipotle). It comes w tortilla chips and there's a bunch more salsas to choose from near the fountain drinks. Great flavor although the rice is a little bland if you try it alone. Price I didn't mind Bc it's a huge burrito and plenty of chips so you're not going to be hungry. I believe it was around$15 w a fountain drink.",J0jDVpn8IIDlHUMgL6JRJA,0,0,4,v4SoOlgAZeBdpzN9Jbk7bQ

Staff were very friendly and helpful. Service was fast and competent.  

The restaurant was clean. There was plenty of seating.

Here, even after not getting paid, the employees stayed and worked and this is how they are treated? (Same person owned all 8 of the stores in Vegas)

When you are really tired of paying the exhorbant prices at the restaurants in the casinos, try something like this.  You may find a hidden gem.  If nothing else, it'll give you a quick break from the smokey casinos.",tmmEeNlrppyARtYNg-EpLg,0,0,3,k28ymsYw1Ra3jdV7-ZXhSA

Baja fresh is a lifesaver when staying near by.  It is a cheap option (for the strip), that has ok food.  It is great for those nights that you will be going out to clubs, the food is not too greasy yet is filling enough.  The guacamole is yummy and the their is never a line.

  Worth the wait? Oh yeah! They have a salsa bar with fresh made salsa, including a mango salsa. Jalapeño and banana pepper slices too. Soda fountains with free refills.
  The only down side is they charge extra for cheese, not a big deal, and for salad dressing. We enjoy it every time we come!",J-tXqq87e6jsjeSmMm-SXA,2,0,5,axnJpUxgDaG5VomD3hNaYA

Are you serious, Baja Fresh? Your burritos were amazing! I've eaten a ridiculous amount of both fancy and cheap burritos in the past... but for some reason - your burritos were just SO good!

I ordered a ""Build Your Own Burrito"", with Carnitas and all the works. I split a burrito with my fiance, and not only was it incredibly delicious - but I was really full off of my half! You also get some complimentary chips and salsa with your meal, so that will help fill you up as well.

My friends were just as amazed with your deliciousness, that we couldn't stop talking about it for the rest of the night. Not only that, but your service was fast and friendly too...

Good to know! If we're in your neck of the woods again next time, we'll be back!",FmoHNtcIw6reY7IX5eV97g,0,0,5,rkcwUdSeItK5ZAENi7ANLQ
