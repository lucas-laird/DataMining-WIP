17886,2010-02-19,0,AyEtowSGi9vx0-xFfrgjWw,"I don't usually like to write a review after only one trip to a restaurant, however, this place is AMAZING and I just had to write a review.  My husband and I went here for breakfast and both had the continental breakfast.  The bagel with chive cream cheese with smoked samon and capers was all tasty, but not a stand out item.  The stars were the croissants.  We tried plain, chocolate, and apricot.  They were all buttery and flaky and perfect.  The favorite though was the apricot.  Any time I can see whole slices of fruit on a pastry, it's a good sign.  Words fail me at this time in how to possibly describe the wonderfullness that is the apricot croissant.

Now, the reason for only 4 stars.  Usually somewhat slow service doesn't bother me and is easily overlooked with good food.  Hovever, the service here was pathetic.  When we arrived we were the only ones in the entire place.  After taking our drink orders, we didn't see our server again for 10-15 minutes.  This after she had just told us to let her know if we wanted our bagels toasted.  I guess we were supposed to walk around searching for her after we got our bagels from the bar?  A huge group of people walked in about halfway through our meal (all going to a Paul Mitchell convention and all wearing entirely black and sporting outlandish hair styles...annoying and loud...).  I thought, surely the servers will have to come over more often with so many people here now, but no.  Still waited forever for our check.

Next trip, we will be back.  Maybe I'll get to try the yummy looking desserts at the pastry counter.",5j8vesz-PYh8EGSkYrIh3A,0,0,4,408pUBJI4ksycLKXiapdHg

The coffee macaron was featured on Food Network - and they're worth the trip.  I'm not a huge coffee fan, and I thought they were pretty tasty - nice meringue crunch on the outside, and a subtle coffee filling in the middle.  I won bonus points with the family when I presented these after returning home from a trip.

Unfortunately most places don't do Brunch in the middle of the week in October, fortunately Payard has great lunch options, and, of course, the best options for dessert. Located in Caesar's Palace next to the Payard shop, this bistro might not be noticed by those walking by, but it's heaven for those who enter.

Food:
Delicious: Louvre, George V, eggs benedict on a croissant (I'm jealous I didn't order it)
Yum: Brioche french toast w/ berries, side of Canadian bacon, side of hash browns

Service:
The hostess and waiter were very friendly greeting us in and out, food came out still warm. 

Total Damage:

I've also had the eggs benedict next door.  It was indeed good, but I think it was overpriced at $18.  The hollandaise was lighter and nicer than any other place I've been to though.

362127,2013-04-30,0,AyEtowSGi9vx0-xFfrgjWw,"We got to the restaurant at around 8:00pm and were seated right away. The place was intimate with the center being the kitchen so that the prepping and cooking were visible to everybody. Pretty Cool!
 
However...
1.       Understaffed-No service...
After we sat down, no one came with water nor menu until about 10 minutes later. Soon, we realized there's pretty much only ONE PERSON serving the entire restaurant. He rushed from table to table trying to get water, wine, menu, take order, serve food, clean up and did not have time to check up on anyone. If we needed something, we had to wait for a while before he even looks up or walks by. The place is supposed to be relaxed, but with the one waitier running around, it actually made me a bit anxious and unable to enjoy the meal as much.
 
2.       Food was mediocre.. at best
It's a unique experience to see the chefs making the food in front of you. However, watching them cook was definitely WAY BETTER tasting the food. I ordered the dinner special which came with appetizer (Lobster Bisque), entrÃ©e (Rack of Lamb), and dessert (Vanilla Vanilla). The Lobster Bisque was just mediocre, and definitely not worth the price. My friend had the cheese soufflÃ©, and that was delicious. I was really disappointed in the lamb. The lamb was really soft but not tender. It was awkwardly sweet... the sweetness did not match nor bring out the flavor of the lamb. The dessert was good.. but I'm sure I can find something way better for half the price
 
3.       RIPPED OFF!
My friends and I all go the dinner special, which was at a discounted price for appetizer + entrÃ©e + dessert. Instead of telling us that they were out of most of their dessert before we started ordering, the waiter decided to wait until we were done with our appetizer and entrÃ©e. He gave us the option of either compromising for what they have left over, or he'll just ""charge us for what we had""... which would have been the same as what we would  pay for the special anyway. There weren't that many customers in the restaurant, so we know they already knew in advance that they were out of dessert. We did not appreciate the shady way they do business.

While staying at Cesar's recently for a medical conference, my husband and I stopped at this lovely every morning for a quick bite and coffee. We try to eat healthy which is not easy while traveling. We each had the yogurt and fruit parfait with a large coffee EVERY morning. Normally these sorts of parfaits are loaded with super sweet yogurt and with a few crappy pieces of fruit, sometimes even frozen/thawed fruit but NOT these! Payard's parfaits had huge, fresh, sweet, delectable blackberries, delicious blueberries, strawberries and NO melon - YES! The yogurt was only slightly sweetened and vanilla I think. I would prefer a plain Greek yogurt but theirs was not overly sweet and a pleasant compliment to the berries. These suckers were top notch I'm tellin' ya!

During my stay in Las Vegas, on days when I had a meeting or event to run to and needed a quick lunch or  breakfast, Payard was my top choice.

The dining partner ordered a chocolate hazelnut cake. I scarfed what he could not finish. It was obviously made with good chocolate.

736689,2013-12-30,0,AyEtowSGi9vx0-xFfrgjWw,"We had two breakfasts and one lunch at Payard over the course of three days. I know, we really liked it. And we might have had a fourth day had the food quality and service been more consistent.

First, the service. In the three times we were there, it felt like the waitresses and managers were trying to hustle us in and out. Yes, I know you're busy. And yes, I know this isn't a two hour affair type place. But simple courtesy and good manners should always come first. No speaking sternly to the customers when they're just trying to order or understand something on the menu. Not pleasant at all.

Next, the food. For breakfast we tried the classic eggs benedict (twice!), lobster eggs benedict, and chocolate french toast. For the benedicts, the hollandaise sauce that came with the classic was tangy and flavorful, but the sauce that came with the lobster was bland. The benedicts are served on a croissant which was a nice change from your standard dish. For lunch we tried the cuban sandwich and crepe madame... the cuban sandwich was hands on the winner.

All in all, Payard has potential. If they can improve the service and be more consistent with their hollandaise sauce, I might not be able to pry my husband away for another other restaurant.",ZJFL6lVmsv2vU4ewg4Jc4g,0,0,3,xRG_DyJdWaDZSGtjrgVltA

It's a lot smaller than I expected and you can see the chef cooking in a small ""kitchen"" in the middle of the restaurant. I decided to have the Croque Madame which came with a nice side salad and baked tomato. The salad was nice and refreshing but the sandwich was a little too heavy for me especially with the Vegas heat. 

I liked the crunch the outside of the sandwich had but I think they can go a little light on the cheese next time since the sauce that comes with it is pretty rich. For dessert, we had the Georges V and the mousse was so rich and delicious. The waiter told us it's one of the most popular desserts and I can see why.

Excellent authentic French pastries.  Enjoyed the mille-feuille (Napoleon)-spectacular!  I thought the pastry cream in it was perfect, but my husband felt it was a tad too sweet. Pastry portion flaky, delicate, and as delicious as could be!  Four stars rather than five for the following reasons: somewhat limited selection of pastries (though the term quality over quantity comes to mind...), we got ice cream as part of our treat and it was TERRIBLE (grainy and lacking in flavor), and for my husband's opinion regarding sweetness.  Would be helpful if Yelp split the Patisserie from the Bistro for ease of browsing reviews.

861261,2014-08-30,0,AyEtowSGi9vx0-xFfrgjWw,"I've lived in France and eaten more than a few times at 3 star Michelin rated restaurants - like Auberge de L'ill, Le Meurice, Le PrÃ© Catelan and the like - so I think I can recognize an outstanding meal when I eat it. I've also eaten at the Payard Bistro a few times, and to me, the experience was comparable. Not that this is an experience in creative and daring culinary cuisine. Payard - to me - is all about recreating classic dishes at their very best. That's not an easy feat for a tiny establishment, mainly catering to a brunch and lunch fare ranging from eggs to soups, salads and sandwiches. 

But I don't care if half the French food I crave isn't available here (though I would die for a truly classic ""Les Halles"" French Onion Soup) - the eggs benedict have that perfect hollandaise, and adding Lobster doesn't diminish the ""purity"" of the dish either. The Croques Monsieur almost brings me to nostalgic tears (but why isn't Madame on the menu too?)

I've never had Quiche Lorraine this good in the USA (everyone is welcome to tell me where I haven't gone and what I've been missing out on) The NiÃ§oise Salad (What? - Americans can't understand the French description of ""Salade NiÃ§oise""?) was the only slight disappointment. It was delicious, but not fully reminiscent of the classic dish I'm used to having in France.

Next time I'll try the Onion Tart, and/or maybe a Tomato & Buffalo Mozzarella Panini - I'm looking forward to this chef's ""Frenchification"" of that Italian classic.

Each visit has been with a different friend - none of whom have been to France or have that haughty snooty attitude which comes from loving the French's haughty snooty attitudes - and all have gone wild - non stop, not shutting up about the enjoyment over the food. So I'm guessing most will love this place.

Located just in from Caesar's Palace main entrance this intimate and cozy bistro has impeccable service. Unless you finish your cup of coffee in one go - I defy you to be able to drain it any other way.

2 things to get: 
-chocolate covered rice krispies (perfect combo of crispy from the rice kris pies, chewy and sweet from the marshmallows, and bitter from the dark chocolate. now only if they added some fleur de sel to balance all the flavors! Payard and I should collaborate)
-almond chocolate croissant (sliced almonds on the outside with an almondy paste topping, filled with dark chocolate on the inside. i wish they could toast the croissant a bit)

there's also a small cafe in case you'd like to sit down for a hot breakfast. 
there's also small tables outside the shop to enjoy your pastry and gelato!

1069314,2011-09-16,0,AyEtowSGi9vx0-xFfrgjWw,"Payard was one of my favorite restaurants in New York before it closed. I remember having a lovely meal there with my family some years ago. When I saw it in Caesar's I was so excited, and I knew I had to try it again. It did not disappoint. We got this $50 prix fix, which included a glass of champagne, amuse bouche, three courses, and a glass of wine to pair with the entree. Great deal and delicious, what more could you ask for?

For the amuse bouche we got lobster sliders. My friend is not a fan of seafood, but she still ate this and liked it. I wish the lobster taste could have been a little stronger though. For appetizer she got the onion soup and I got the salad. Her onion soup is one of the best I've had, it was warming and sweet. The salad was also delicious, the bacon bits added a crunch and saltiness that I enjoyed. For entree I had the fish and my friend ordered the filet mignon, though we ended up switching. The filet mignon was cooked perfectly (I like it still red-ish in the middle), and the peppercorn sauce was flavorful and so scrumptious. 

For dessert we got two of the choices from the patisserie. I honestly can't remember their names now, but one dessert particularly stood out. It had raspberry and chocolate mousse, but there were flavors infused into each other and such, and even the marshmallows on top were special.

The shop itself is beautiful and fairly easy to find inside Caesars.  The staff was very friendly, but surprisingly unfamiliar with the product.  I tried a Vienne pastry ($6.50) that consisted of a thin vanilla sponge cake, chocolate mousse, orange marmalade, soft caramel and a hard chocolate coating.  The flavors were well balanced without the orange overpowering the rest and overall tasted very good, however the chocolate coating had an unpleasant waxy  texture that lingered in my mouth and stuck to my teeth at the end.  
I purchased several filled chocolates ($1.50 ea.), but thought the variety was limited.  The white chocolate and passionfruit ganache was my favorite.  The lady waiting on me gave me the wrong caramel (I asked for coffee, but got chocolate).  These were good, but not as good as other high-end chocolates I have tried.  The execution was nice, but the chocolate decor was very basic.

After strolling around Caesar's Palace, including the Forum Shops (which you should visit too by the way), my honey and I decided to go check out Payard for a little snack.  Honey bunches bought me a dozen assorted French Macarons.  $28 (yes, for 12 macarons), but TOTALLY worth it!  The flavors that were included were: Coffee, Chocolate, Vanilla Bean, Lemon, Blackberry, and Raspberry.

Now, let me tell you, I am no macaron expert, but these French macarons??  D-I-V-I-N-E.  Each one was so FRESH, flavorful, moist, light, and fluffy!  I even took them back home on an airplane, and 4 days later they still tasted fresh - as if I had bought them that day!  Oh and they come in a cute little box that is sealed with a magnet.  How cute and clever!

My favorite flavor by far was the Vanilla Bean, followed by the Coffee and then the Chocolate.  You could see specks of vanilla bean in the cookie of the Vanilla Bean macaron.

When we visit Vegas next time, we will for sure be going back.  Can't wait to try their fresh pastries and desserts (which looked exquisite in the case by the way!).  They also have assorted chocolates, candy, sandwiches, crepes, and coffee.

I wanted a quick, real, breakfast alone before having to work a conference booth later that day by myself. I had a berry breakfast crepe and orange juice. 

The crepe was very light and delicious. They make it fresh and only between certain breakfast hours. Huge glob of creme with some not too sweet berries. The orange juice still had some pulp. Prices are on par with everything else on the strip. $6 orange juice. $13 crepe. I sat at one of the small tables and just relaxed.

My friends and I were in Vegas from May 27th-30th for Isabel's Bachelorette Party (I'm the maid of honor). We made a somewhat solid vow not to eat out so much during this trip to save money and brought our own food. But we all failed miserably. We only ate one full meal in our two bedroom suite once, and that was for breakfast on Sunday. We had snacks too and ate some of those as well. But since we were out and about for most of the trip, we couldn't help but spend some money on some food. We suck. lol.

One of my friends, Kerri (one of the girls on the trip and a foodie), recommended this place after we refused to wait on long lists for Hash House A Go Go and Max Brenner. We had parked at Imperial Palace, so we walked from there to Caesar's Palace to Payard (I had called Max Brenner as we were walking and they had about a 30 min wait time). When we arrived at Payard, the first thing I noticed was the sophisticated design of the patisserie and bistro. There was a bit of a line to get food, unlike the other places where you had to wait to get seated. Before I got into the line, I browsed the menu and noticed that the prices were a little high for food. I thought that since the food was a little high in price, it should taste amazing. I got back in the line and was set to order an egg sandwich with an oj (which cost $6 by the way....GAH). The rest of my friends had ordered crepes, so they had to wait a little. As soon as I got to the register, the girl told me that they were out of egg sandwiches. Needless to say I was a little disappointed, so I decided on the Croque Monsieur. It is essentially a grilled cheese sandwich but with melted cheese on top and ham, melted swiss cheese, and bechamel sauce inside. With the oj, it cost me a little over $17. I waited about 5 minutes for everything. The sandwich came in a really nifty container. I was hoping that the oj was a little larger, but I settled. When I bit into the sandwich, I was in heaven. It was the best ""grilled cheese"" I've ever had, and the fresh squeezed orange juice was perfect. Everyone else enjoyed their crepes. I ended up trying Isabel's smores crepe, and it was really delicious. 

Overall, I thought this place was great. The prices were a little high, but the service was great and the food was tasty. Whenever I do come back to Vegas, I might have to come back. Hopefully they will have the egg sandwich this time :)",JAWpwyfRiRjgr0PDUrm00Q,1,1,5,p2OAQoE8dPkwd2FRpC615g

Their gelato and sorbet have these addicting thick texture and intense flavors. The macaron flavors are not as distinct as Bouchon's but the small bite size made them quite lovable. The texture was just average though. They weren't as chewy and fluffy as I would like. The other pastries were decent.

We also paired this brunch w/ some outstanding Bellinis ( or peach mimosas, as they called them ) & wow!  Were they tasty!!  Real peach puree & champers - quite a treat!!

As we were departing, we grabbed some macarons for later....... they were extremely disappointing

We chose a box of 6 for $14.  At this time, I'd also like to point out that their box of 12 was $32.  That's MORE expensive than if you got 2 of the 6-counts.  Where's the logic in that?!

There is also a vast difference in the level of service you'll receive in the restaurant vs the pastry counter.... we're talking night & day!

Restaurant-side = nice as can be. Laid back.
Pastry-side = tired & haggard. Rude & not worth the effort

Upon approaching the counter, there were multiple people on multiple registers.  They proceed to assist everyone before telling me I have to go to the lefthand side of the counter.....but I'm the only person standing there.  So I head left & when I tell the girl what I wanted, she then makes me walk back to the righthand side of the counter, where the macarons are - exactly where I was standing before! - to show her which box I wanted.  Crazy!

After we got back to the room & opened up the cookies, they had very little flavor & almost tasted stale.  Laudree & Pierre Herme have ZERO competition from Payard.  These are a pass for sure - save your money & tastebuds

The line went from zero to ten people in 3 minutes as lunchtime set in... and the girls behind the counter seemed slightly falling behind... not so much overwhelmed... just like maybe management didn't have quite the perfect game plan for a lunchtime rush.

I don't like spending 7 minutes in line for lunch (I'm guessing but I'm a good guesser)... and that's a long time.

Banana Tart - This was sublime. The flavors and artistry of this little dessert were amazing with banana & vanilla rum pastry cream on top of a sweet, thin tart dough .

Seasonal Strawberry Tart - Very solid. Beautiful fresh, ripe strawberries perched atop of sweet custard & fresh tart.

Parisian Macarons - My favorite part of this Patisserie and what everyone is currently clamoring for. They can't keep the coffee macarons in stock and on our 1st visit they were already long sold out before we arrived hence our 2nd visit the very next day. We tried atleast 6-7 different flavors but my favorites were the red currant, chocolate, coffee & passion fruit.

The sandwich is listed under breakfast but I ordered it for dinner without knowing. It has ham, Swiss cheese, and bechamel sauce on white bread. It's delicious and doesn't taste like breakfast to me! The sandwich is pricey but it's way bigger than some other things I've ordered on the menu. All the cheese on it really fills you up. 

The dessert I ordered is called Chocolate Decadence. It's very rich but light. I think I remember reading on the display that it's a flourless cake...I think. I would definitely split this because it's so rich.

First off, Payard is actually a three part restaurant, here in Caesar's Palace. It's a restaurant, with a smaller, order at the counter quick-cafe style section, as well, as a ""Payard Express"" which isn't even connected to the restaurant or to-go counter, but rather, closer to the casino.

We went to the cafe, to-go section. At first glance, it's a pretty space, but seriously, what isn't in a Vegas style hotel these days. The selection, even for a quick bite, looked pretty slim. It's ok, I thought, smaller menu usually means a more finely tuned menu! Or, so I thought. 

As I was in a group of five, we all ordered different things, with the intent to try a little of everything. We ordered; a croque monsieur, a chicken and mushroom crepe, a banana and caramel crepe, an almond croissant as well as a regular croissant.

The chicken and mushroom crepes were just plain T-A-S-T-E-L-E-S-S. I mean, NO seasoning whatsoever. The croque monsieur tasted good, HOWEVER, I've had ice that was warmer than this sandwich. It was heated up, extremely unevenly! Too bad, as this was the tastiest thing we ordered. The banana caramel crepe was ok, as were the two croissants.

Oh, and the service? HORRIBLE! The women working here, all had attitude! No one had a smile on their face, which I couldn't care less about, but God forbid you ask them a question! I asked a woman behind the counter, what time the restaurant portion closes at night, she looked at me with a blank stare and said, ""they're right next door, why don't you walk over there, and ask them"".

It's a shame, I really did have high hopes for Payard. Should have stuck with Bouchon!

I was in a desperate need of some pastries, baked goods and was hunting for macarons... enter Payard.
Right out of the gate I saw macarons and got excited. Then I found out that they're all pre-made, prepackaged and sold in packages of assorted flavors. How lame is that?! Super lame. Nibble nibble bleh. Not impressed. 
I decided to order their s'more crepe. What a let down. It's pretty hard to mess up a crepe. There was plenty of chocolate which was good as I love chocolate. There was next to no graham cracker on this crepe save for a few crumbs sprinkled sparingly on top of the whipped cream. The whipped cream is not home made and tastes funky. The marshmallow drizzly bits were tasty but definitely lacking. This was really a chocolate crepe that bumped into another crepe and had some of that other crepe's ingredients on it; like when you order French fries and your friend orders onion rings and you find that one onion ring hidden in your fries... except not awesome like that. The crepe itself was a bit chewy. Really... this was not an enjoyable breakfast at all. 
My vacation companion disliked their espresso to the point of not finishing it, throwing it out and offering to pay for both our coffees if I would go find a Starbucks. Starbucks coffee is better than Payard's coffee... seriously?!
The thing that is even crazier about this is I saw an ""express"" version of Payard elsewhere in the hotel/casino. Really?! Payard is already like a fast food version of a bakery. Next thing you're going to tell me they have McDonald's Express... oh, wait. I guess a shorter wait for bland food is a good thing though.
If you're not used to quality baked goods, crepes, macarons, etc then this is probably going to be an okay spot for your sweet tooth to get a fix but if you love quality and tasty treats you're better off passing on Payard.

Never buy pre-boxed macarons. I kind of already knew they weren't going to be good... but since we were in a rush, friends decided to split up the $28 box of pre-packaged macarons (12 total?).

They were brittle, dry, and the filling way too sweet. Sizes were pretty small too. Can you say, most not worth it macarons ever??

What they did have were muffins, butter & almond croissants, cereal, bagels, parfaits, and a variety of fresh fruit.  While all excellent, there was no way I could eat that much carbs.  My stomach had enough after one almond croissant, which had a perfect crunchy outside and moist center.  Service was excellent, and the bistro's yellow and brown decor looks like something out of Charlie & the Chocolate factory - in a good, French way.

2) There's nobody actually at Payard (unlike the lines at the other patisseries), and there's a good reason for it.
3) The shop and employees look really sad because the decor, layout and color scheme don't do the place any favors.
4) There's a machine that is supposed to dispense chocolates (free), but it doesn't work anymore or was turned off to save them some money.
5) They make macarons but they're only available prepackaged (and they looked dried out and chipped up in the packaging).
6) The Opera Cake was dry and slightly flavorless.
7) The Napoleon had the right flavors but the pastry had dried out completely and you couldn't cut through it with the plastic knife they had available ... major disappointment.

After a light lunch, my friend and I went to Payard for dessert.  He got the almond croissant and I had gotten the macaroons.

Almond croissant:  Not very impressed with this one.  The actual croissant part was pretty delicious.  There was a sugar glaze and sliced almonds on top which added a very nice nutty flavor.  So the outside, delicious....Inside, however was a different story.  There was an almond center that resembled a very moist muffin, almost cake-like.  The flavor was not very good.  I'm not sure why people like it.  It reminded me and tasted like playdough... But to each their own I guess.   I found that it lacked flavor and the consistency was 'off.'   That's just my opinion, apparently it's a hit, so I guess you can try it just to be the judge yourself.  They also offered a chocolate croissant, but we didn't try it.  It probably tastes better than the almond croissant...Heck ANY croissant would probably taste better than that playdough almond filling!  

Macaroons:  I've heard amazing things about these macaroons, therefore I took a deep breath and shelled out $10.81 for 6 of these small ass french cookies.  I had faith that they would be AMAZING...and...THEY WERE FREAKING AMAZING!!!  I could never justify spending $10 for 6 of these silver dollar sized pieces if they weren't just the most delicious macaroons I've ever tasted.  They come in a pack of 6 and NO you do not get to choose which flavors (not sure if they offer them differently inside the Payard restaurant).  They are pre-packaged and if you would like to choose your flavors, you would have to order them online.  The flavors per package included (and in order of my preference)

Vanilla
Strawberry
Currant (where else can you get currant macaroons)??
Chocolate
Coffee
Lemon

They were made perfectly.  Crisp outer shells that were delicate and cracked with the most minimal pressure.  Inside the shell was a soft, chewy, thin center.  The filling was a perfect ratio to the cookie itself.  Not too thick of a layer of filling.  I took the tiniest bites to savor the flavors, but that's how I like to eat macaroons.  I've wolfed them down before, and the flavors just are not that exciting if I don't eat them slow.  

Anyways, if I had just only eaten the almond croissant, I would have given Payard's a lousy 1 star.  However, because of the macaroons, I gave Payard's FIVE stars!!  I would have taken away one star for having to drive to the strip and finding parking and having to wander through the casino and for having to pay $10.81 for them, if...they just weren't soooo freaking good!

I went on a search mission to find some real French Macarons in Vegas. After some research online, i came down to 3 places that have them (or should have them according to online reviews)- Jean Phillipe, Payard Patisserie, Bouchon Bakery. To my surprise, only Bouchon had the best deal, biggest macarons, and the cheapest price (when comparing sizes).. Jean Philippe should be ashamed of themselves for even advertising the fact that they sell macarons. All they had was puny 6 tiny macarons in a bag (size of a quarter) for $10.. Same thing with Payard. As much as they advertise themselves, and as much aura as they create around them- shame on them too. They didn't have any macarons except for some puny little pre-packaged bags that was way overpriced..

All i can say, when it comes to getting real French Macarons in Vegas- the place to go to is Boucheron. Payard, i give you the lowest score for falsely advertising what you really don't have in your shop. Shame on you..",mzN9dyBM35pbRDD7O-EB-g,1,1,1,feoAeMsDVSc_31pVC3hzXg

I ordered a ham and swiss quiche since it was not something you can find very often. It came with a very small side salad and small tomato.  She asked if I wanted to add potatoes.  I said yes although for the $22 price tag, you'd think they could throw a few on there and it would have sufficed but alas no, it was an extra $5.  Good thing is that the potatoes were hot and tasty and you got a lot.  I couldn't eat them all.  The quiche was thick and quite good.  Some ordered just the regular bacon and eggs and that was $18.  I am giving stars mostly on quality of food.  It was tasty but I would not get any basics as it is quite pricey.  If my quiche just came with a few potatos, I feel it was worth the price.  Otherwise in general it is expensive for breakfast.

Payard is a patisserie and cafe in Casesars Palace (near the gaming floor).  In addition to the food on site, Payard offers many attractive food gifts (like gourmet chocolates).  The shop has a nice high-end look to it and some of their individual desserts are impressive looking (they look similar to the individual desserts at Jean Philippe at Aria).

I recently watched Wolfgang Puck talk about how much he loves the macarons at Payard on the Food Network so I decided to give them a try.  The macarons were not available individually.  They were sold in a bag of 6 for $10.

The package indicated that the macarons were assorted flavors, but all the macarons were the same flavor, which was like a mix of hazelnut and almond.  The nutty flavor was strong and good (sweet, rich taste to the macarons). 

Unfortunately, the texture was not right.  I am not sure if it was because they might not have been fresh, but the macarons did not have that contrast between the slightly crispy pastry top and bottom with the soft and chewy center.  Instead, it was just soft and chewy all around.

Service was quick and okay.

Despite Wolfgang Puck's love of these macarons, the macarons did not appear to be the signature item here (they were hard to find and were not as lovingly displayed as some of the other desserts).  For a better macaron experience (both in flavor and texture), you should check out Bouchon Bakery at The Venetian.  If you do come here, you may want to try one of their attractive individual cakes or chocolates instead.

We wound up getting the S'mores crepe, which had marshmallows, graham cracker crumbs, and chocolate sauce. It was pretty sweet and served hot iff the griddle which helped melt some of the marshmallows.  Overall not bad, though i think JP in Aria has better crepes.

If you're staying at Caesars, Payard is your main option for breakfast/lunch/snack besides the food court (starbucks and smashburger) & their sit down restaurants. Over the years I have tried quite a bit of their menu. Sandwiches are decent (but also LV strip priced). Crepes are standard ($9-$12) and Coffee is forgettable (in taste, not price $4 for a small regular cup).

The almond croissants are what initially brought me to Payard and are the main reason why I continue to return whenever I'm in the area. The almond croissants are flaky and buttery with a perfect amount of almond paste and heaping amounts of powder sugar.

1857196,2014-06-10,1,AyEtowSGi9vx0-xFfrgjWw,"Came here for a table of two for breakfast on Saturday 05/10/2014 and waited only 15 - 20 minutes, it was about 10 - 10:30 or so. The dining room is intimate and small, I think their maximum occupancy sign stated somewhere between 40 - 50 people. The kitchen is set up in the center of the restaurant and the dining area sort of wraps around, a circular restaurant setting if you will. Looking in to the right are sofas up against the wall - we didn't get an opportunity to sit on that side and instead sat at the same table two days in a row. We ended up on the left where the window facing some of the shops were.

Lobster Eggs Benedict on Croissant - I ordered mom the Lobster Eggs Benedict on Croissant. It comes with generous chunks of lobster atop a buttery croissant split in half with two poached eggs slathered in hollandaise sauce. I had a bite and the first thing I noticed was how crispy the exterior of the croissant was, but not dry. The butter aroma was so fresh! I mean, I have never tasted a true butter croissant until that day. It was the perfect balance of slight sweetness, crispy but yet flaky crust, and moist but not soggy inside. The eggs of course were perfectly poached, whites were not runny and yolk was not overcooked. And the hollandaise! I haven't had really good hollandaise but this was not too overwhelming and complemented the dish very well. Especially with the chunks of fresh and succulent lobster which was cooked to just done and not rubbery.

Steel Cut Oats and Sauteed Berries - I ordered oatmeal. I know it sounds boring, but after trying it with their sauteed berries, I was a super happy girl. The steel cut oats were cooked to a creamy consistency with the perfect bite. The portion was generous as you can see. The sauteed berries were a mixture of raspberries, blackberries, and blueberries. I'm sure sugar was added and the berries were quickly sauteed to release the juices but maintain a slight bite and not turn into a pile of mush.

Steel Cut Oats and Caramelized Apples - The second time around I ordered the oatmeal with caramelized apples. The waitress then asked me if I had tried their sauteed berries... So when I did try the apples, I asked for the berries again! The apples were good, but I just like mine a little bit more tender and this didn't come out warm like the berries did.

Cappuccino and Coffee -  I think Payard by far had the best cappuccino of all the restaurants we dined at in Vegas this year. The aroma was dark and bold, but not bitter or acidic. It had the light smoky flavor characteristic of a lot of french-style roasts. The milk was not overly foamed here, yielding a creamy consistency. I find some places over-foam their milk and the cappuccino ends up being dry. Coffee was good as well - nice dark french roast, low acid/bitterness, not sour.

Service - service was excellent and they had no problem bringing me an extra side of berries for my oatmeal when I had already ordered the apples. They also offered me a cup of coffee to-go when we got the check.

Bakery/Chocolate Shop - I browsed through their chocolate assortment and decided to buy this container of chocolate covered nougat. So I was a little taken by surprise when I bit into one. I thought it would be a soft nougat center, like the nougat I got from Jean Philippe. But it was crunchy with small pieces of nuts ground into it. It was still good mind you. The green ones were white chocolate and the brown ones were dark chocolate. This was a satisfying crunch of sweetness and I may be buying more of these types of chocolates as I find them. It's probably less unhealthy to get the crunch from an actual nut (like chocolate covered almonds), but that sugar rush from the crunchy sugar is just so much more fun.

Location - You can find Payard Patisserie and Bistro inside Caesar's Palace. From the front lobby entrance, go towards the casino and go straight to the back. It is diagonally across from the buffet and directly across from Rao's. The bakery is obvious the but the restaurant is a little hidden - facing the bakery, go to your left and it's right next door. I recommend reservations as the restaurant is small.

1886087,2016-05-16,0,AyEtowSGi9vx0-xFfrgjWw,"The first thing most people think about in the morning is ""coffee"". During both of my visits to Cesare's Palace I came here everyday for caramel macchiato and a croissant. The first few visits were good, everything was enjoyable including the pastries and ice cream/gelato. There were never many people and I soon learned why, because the experiences grew progressively worse, especially the service. The first incident, I had a thermos and I wanted it to be filled with hot water and instead they told me it was safety hazard. They instead filled five cups with hot water and they did not care to give a tray. If you ask me I think that it was more dangerous carrying five cups of water instead of one insulated thermos. What made this even worse was that they charged $20 for not tea, but hot water and they handled the situation poorly, being very rude from the beginning. In my opinion they made it more dangerous and my visits to Payard would end on my second visit to Cesare's Palace. Like all the previous times I ordered a caramel macchiato and this time they said that they don't make them even though I had ordered one countless times before. Instead they made a caramel latte and all of the coffees cost around $5, but this time they charged me $7.03. I had only $7 and they did not accepted it, instead they took out the caramel without asking. Really? Is caramel that expensive that it's over a $1 extra? Also could they not have given it to me even though I was $0.03 short? The problem was with the same two girls that time after time were EXTREMELY rude and not just to me, but others in line. By then I asked for the manager, because they could not act this way any longer. The manager was helpful and made me another coffee also a chef by the name of Adel (sorry if I misspelled his name) came and apologize for the experience. I now know that there is a Starbucks on the other side of the hotel and I would rather walk father to a friendlier and less expensive place than deal with these sassy women. I understand that sometimes you have a bad day, but this was constant and is no way to treat customers that way and I really hope this problem can be solved, because I like this place but I don't want to get upset everyday of my vacation over a cup of coffee.",Gd9n9T2FAxrrAuSyAHsPbg,2,0,3,K3TWtgOx0CyiN-2kd4SHbg
1893713,2012-07-17,0,AyEtowSGi9vx0-xFfrgjWw,"Try the almond croissant. I loved the almond filling along with the crisp outside. Although, it should really be classified as a danish rather than a croissant, since it doesn't have the layered buttery quality that authentic french croissants do. But a very good danish at that :)

My sister and I have a fondness for hazelnut, so the Louvre dessert was a match made in heaven! It had wonderful hazelnut flavor that melded nicely with the chocolate mousse. I also loved how the bottom had an unexpected crispy texture that went well with the creamy surrounding. It's a very dense and rich dessert. Perfect for two in my opinion.

As for the brunch/lunch menu:
I had the Crepe Madame and opted for swiss cheese (you can choose swiss of cheddar) and had the egg scrambled. My sister had the ham and swiss quiche. Nothing spectacular. We came to a consensus that  while the food was ok, they could have improved it by adding some spinach, or tomatoes for taste, but It was fine. I had fun watching them make my crepe though...

I searched for a nice brunch spot on yelp and made my reservation at 9:50am for a 10:45 spot that was available via OpenTable. We got to the restaurant at 10:30 and checked in knowing that we were early and we would probably wait.  We were asked to sit and we patiently waited less than five feet from the two ladies that checked us in. (One was Filipino and the other seemed to be French) 

After we checked in a group of four came in asking for a table saying they had a reservation but both the Filipino and French lady said there was no reservation.  After some hub bub and complaints about not having a reservation, they were promptly seated. We didn't think it was a big deal they sat before us because we'd be upset too if they lost our reservation a d we didn't know if their misplaced reservation was before or after ours. Besides, we were early so it was fine. 

Afterwards a string of parties came, both larger and the same size as us with no reservations, and we're seated almost immediately. We felt that was strange and I walked up the two steps away I was to the Filipino lady and waited in front of her to be acknowledged so I could ask how much longer we would have to wait since it was now 10 mins past our reservation. 

When the Filipino lady looked up from what she was writing, she looked right at me, then looked beyond me to the line that was forming and stated she would help who was next. 

I was surprised that she looked right past me and the guy behind me came up next to me and said he would like a table for five. 

A bit pissed, I loudly said ""Excuse me. I'm standing right in front of you. I just had a quick question. Can you just tell me how much longer we have to wait?"" 

She then asked me my name again,  when my reservation was and what time I checked in. She couldn't find the time I checked in nor remembered me checking in even though I was five feet from her the whole time. 

She then called the French lady who looked at me and asked me what time my reservation was, what time I checked in,  etc. She also didn't remember me. 

She also intimated that I had never checked in and I walked in now. 

""I've been standing right here for over twenty minutes now, it's past my reservation time,  and you let three other parties with no reservations seat before us. I just want to know how much longer we would have to wait.""

They kept looking at the pad and not making eye contact with me and asking what time I checked in,  trying to figure out if they had made a mistake or if I was lying. 

At that point I was fed up so we left. The Filipino lady was totally clueless and I was getting tired and offended trying to prove myself to the cold French lady.

1958401,2012-03-14,0,AyEtowSGi9vx0-xFfrgjWw,"Payard is a gem inside Caesars Palace. My husband and I got something from Payard every day of our trip to Vegas this past weekend, and all of it was delicious.

The to-go area has a wonderful selection of all varieties of treats, from gourmet desserts to ice cream to sandwiches to made-to-order crepes. I tried the Crepe Madame for an afternoon snack on our first day (ham, cheese, and a fried egg inside a crepe - what's not to like?), and it was so delicious I got it again the second afternoon. My husband tried the mint chocolate chip ice cream the first day, which was great, and a nutella crepe the second day, which was absolutely delicious. We have visited Paris, and while nothing compares to the crepes you can get there, this one was pretty darn good. They also have iced tea that has a very distinct and unique flavor - I'm not certain what it was, but it was definitely better than your average iced tea.

On our last morning at Caesars, we ate breakfast in the restaurant portion of Payard - what a great decision! I had eaten there several years before and remembered how good breakfast was, and I wasn't disappointed. I ordered the Eggs Florentine and my husband ordered the Eggs Benedict. Both were served over a croissant and were very generous portions. The eggs were perfectly poached and the hollandaise sauce was fresh. My husband ordered a cup of coffee, which I tasted - it was as good as any cafe creme I'd had in Paris.

On our way to check out, we also picked up a box of French macarons for the road. These were a bit pricey and weren't quite as good as macarons we'd had in Paris; I would skip them next time.

Francois Payard was also in town while we were there - it was interesting watching him coach his Vegas staff, especially after seeing him as a judge on Top Chef Just Desserts.

If you are staying in Caesars, save a breakfast for Payard, and some room in the afternoon for a crepe. Some of the best food we had in Vegas!",HxAP2FmQmBPAFN8OAs_PnA,0,1,5,AvMdLyhkgEIC_V93rMZ9jw

My boyfriend paid and HE was the one who said excuse me. No way does he look like a Susan. Everyone else ran by, when he finally got someone else's attention, they couldn't even find his ticket, and asked for our receipt, they had lost our order. When we finally got our crepes, they didn't give us our drink, said we didn't order one. My boyfriend asked for his receipt back, which they had lost too.

Considering the other places there are to eat in Vegas, it's kind of a rip to pay the price for continental breakfast here. To be honest, the breakfast quality and pastries are better at Bouchon by far (lemon curd scone -- to die for).",h9RUaaHa5kcQKqtJ-sgS0Q,0,0,3,PCiGAL7YQ2TXCpLjJn4-Ig

The omelet I had tasted great and was cooked perfectly though. My wife had eggs bacon and potatoes which she commented were all very tasty, but not worth the $22 price tag. Seriously reconsider if you want breakfast. There are plenty of restaurants on the strip at the same price point that offer better breakfast options that don't include an overdressed salad as a breakfast side. 

The waitstaff was cold and not very inviting. We didn't have the same waiter once through the entire meal so it was hard to tell who was really serving us.

Arriving early, my friend and I shared a latte, a almond croissant and a classic ham and cheese quiche from the joining cafe. All of which blew my mind! For brunch, we moved over to the restaurant.The decor was nice but a little Vegas-y. Service was so-so. I was disappointed that our server could not really talk up the desserts, when that's what it was all about for us. We all shared a Monte Cristo and a croissant eggs Benedict. Both were good, but the hollandaise was a little too acidic. When the dessert menus came, I noticed the same desserts a few feet away in the case were $2 less then on the menus. I figured this was a plating charge and it accounted for sauce and garnish... Wrong! Our server just went over to the case, grabbed out 4 desserts and smacked 'em on plates, complete with the slice separating parchment paper. 
Up to this point, I felt very infatuated with idea of eating at Payard's. I love his sugar and chocolate work, and I am a huge fan of his pastries. I really expected there to be some art, or some WOW factor to the desserts in the restaurant. But I suppose I over expected... Payard's Bistro in Vegas is just another tourist/calorie trap. Save some cash and go to the cafe counter for the same yummy food. 
Enrique, the exc pastry chef standing in while Francois was building his empire, was a great chef. He showed us the kitchen during service (!), and we are very grateful. He was passionate and devoted to quality ingredients, a key quality for every chef. He also wants his kitchen to learn and create, as well as have a voice.

Payard is a rather small restaurant, and I got the feeling they tried to squeeze as many tables in as possible. I understand this, but it's not exactly enjoyable to have your waitress' butt in your face while she's helping the table next to yours. Also since you're sitting like a foot away from your neighbouring table, it gets loud. 

On to the food. Payard is famous (apparently) for their eggs Benedict. I have to admit my lobster eggs Benedict on a croissant was delicious. The croissant was crispy, buttery, and flaky. The lobster portion was generous, and the poached egg was cooked perfectly. No complaints about the food, just the ambiance and atmosphere. 

We also purchased some macarons to take home with us. I was very disappointed in them. They had no real flavor. They just tasted sweet. The macarons from La Tour Cafe at home were way better.",G2wNh4VLDXWnaDp6EtDmLA,2,0,3,eav4dcD3M3xIy6tkr08iXg

Note that we didn't actually go into the Bistro but the pastry shop open next door that served snacks.  The date of visit was Tuesday, June 24th around 5pm vegas time.

The reason for this one star review is due to the lack of service, attitude and follow up from a restaurant/bakery located in a world class casino and not to mention the lack of care of a quality product of the general manager who just gave me excuse after excuse for reasons why the service was justified.

As the lady started to scoop my ice cream, I asked for a waffle cone.  She acknowledged, but still proceeded to not give me a cone until the manager came in and I had to ask again but received rude facial expressions from both the manager and cashier.  It was as if I had put a steaming pile of cow manure under their nose....

As we got up to the front to pay there was confusion and mass chaos as the cashiers were serving random people who walked up rather then serving the people like me who were in line.  They had no idea how to use the cash register let alone how to count money... this is vegas people what the heck is going on?!?!?!?!  

The pistachio ice cream was sub-par at best, the buffett has better I do NOT recommend anyone to go to this place for a snack if they're waiting to get into the buffet, it's a waste of time and money and quite frankly it may kill any positive vibes you may have of a world class casino.",7zOxJUeYQEu0P_BU2lCITQ,0,0,1,Pk6wuuIt1YqTKCrBV_36jg

But the reason I came here morning after morning were the crepes. Made right in front of you, these eggy delights could be filled with chocolate, strawberries, marshmallows, whipped cream, and anything you could think of to create huge plates of ridiculous sweetness. Or filled with meats and cheeses for a savory meal.  Or they could be made simple, the way I like them, with just butter and a bit of lemon sugar.

The express counter in the chocolate shop offered various breakfast and lunch dishes - bagels, Croque Monsieur, coffee and espresso, sandwiches, salads, etc...

In addition to the cafe/chocolate shop, there is also a (really) small sit down restaurant that offers a fantastic continental breakfast buffet along with breakfast, lunch, and dinner menus.

Well, sorry Wolfgang , but I must contest and declare Pistacia Vera's macrons as king. They have better texture, bolder flavor, are larger, and overall more yummy. If you're ever in Columbus, OH give them a try! 

But, like I said, great customer service. They kept the line moving and their crepes looked really delicious, but I didn't have time for them.

2591097,2014-01-09,0,AyEtowSGi9vx0-xFfrgjWw,"My review will strictly be on what I ordered:

Chocolate Decadence - This surely was decadent, but after a while it just tasted so one dimensional.  It's great to taste, but not to consume as a whole.  It started off as bitter then rounded out at the end.  Great mouth feel.

Louvre - While I LOVE hazelnut, I wish there was more of a pronounced hazelnut flavor.  What attracted me most was how the description stated that there is a hazelnut wafer inside.  Unfortunately the wafer absorbs the moisture from the mousse and because soggy, to the point where it is difficult to distinguish between mousse and wafer.  While indulging, I was searching for that crunch factor.

Chocolate Macaron - Texturally all the macarons were consistent and delicate.  As for this, the chocolate was very subtle.  Not too sweet nor too bitter.. somewhere in between, which I think most people would enjoy.

Pistachio Macaron - True pistachio flavor.  Loved it.

Passion Fruit Macaron - MY FAVE! However I would have preferred the ganache to be made with white chocolate vs. dark.  Passion fruit pairs amazingly well with white over dark.

Raspberry Macaron - I was unsure about this one because it had an almost rose-y aroma in the back of my throat as I chewed it.  Certainly my least favorite of the bunch.

Vanilla - True vanilla bean flavor.  Wonderful.  

Mint Gelato - Minty of course, but definitely not overwhelming.  Texturally, this wasn't a rich gelato.  It was actually icy in texture, which I find quite odd.  

Dulce de Leche Gelato - SO DISAPPOINTED.  The gelato itself was a standard base flavor, but even the dulce de leche swirled throughout didn't have that nice, rich, caramel flavor.  

OVERALL:  Awesome place for locals and tourists.

i saw an episode of ""the best thing i ate"" featuring payard's macarons and wolfgang puck's smiling face as he bit into one of them. i love macarons, i adore mr. puck, and these two put together was definitely irresistible. 

never mind the hidden location of the pastisserie. look beyond the dark wooden interior. forgive the disorganized staff. i was there for macarons and only macarons. oddly, the macarons were not displayed nor sold individually. they come as prepackaged in 6 different flavors for $10, not too expensive considering its fame and location. 

i expected the same reaction as mr. puck's on the food network show, but i cringed my face in disappointment. they were definitely not the ""best thing i ate"". given the size (tiny, tiny and tiny), it's probably hard to bake them to that perfect crispiness outside and softness inside, but the cookies themselves had no textural variance. of the 6 macarons, no flavors were exotic nor unique, if you compare them to paulette's, and even to bottega louie's. some had overwhelming flavors (strawberry) while others were too mild to detect anything other than the almond filling (chocolate).

FYI Macaroons and Macaron are not the same.  Macaroons are these coconut small baked goods.  French Macaron is these two cookies that are sandwich together with a specific flavor.

I walked all the way from ARIA to Cesar's Palace in a search for Payard's in particular French Macaons.  I spoke to one of the works, and told them I was looking for French Macarons and she said she wasn't sure if we had any and I just had a shock look!  It was only around noon.  I didn't know they were that popular.

So she asked her manager and thankfully they had some in the back and hurray I got it!

I didn't even hesitate and I just ordered a dozen for my girlfriend who likes them very much.  These are good eats and are expensive and worth every penny.  

I have attempted to make Macarons several times and it's very difficult. It takes a lot of techniques to get the batter correctly.

The store had a lot of stuff to try.  They serve fresh crepes and assort types of chocolates in nicely boxes.

Overall, these Macarons were very different from all the Macarons I have tried.  The shells were very hard and smooth, great texture.  When you take a bite, the shell breaks and the middle is soft, following with cake middle.  The filling wasn't that sweet at all; I think it was just right.

It was not your typical tiramisu.... it was more like a layered, trifle mousse. Which is not bad... and trust me .... I licked the fork and scraped the sides of the container it was so good. Very creamy and melt in your mouth. It was just different than the norm and it definitely took care of my sweet tooth. 
Cost $7. 

And then there was this AWESOME looking chocolate flourless cookie.... it was like $5 so I couldn't bring myself to buy it instead of the tiramisu which is my all time fav.

The next day, I treated myself to a warmed chocolate croissant and a cup of ice cold milk. Ahh....just thinking about it now I'm getting all fuzzy inside. The chocolate was not too bitter, not too sweet and paired beautifully with the butter flavor of the pastry. I also took home a bag of madeleines, which I portioned out to myself over the week to make them last. They were divine.

The whole restaurant comes in two parts:  The larger side was dedicated to small dessert-like pastries with a lovely presentation, with prices around $6-$7 range.  

I went with a friend to the bistro side, which was a lot smaller, and a bit more intimate.  We were seated immediately.  Since there were two of us, and there were two choices for the prix fixe, we decided that we'd get the opposite and share them.  

I started with the lobster salad, which was a very good springy and tart salad of mixed greens.  The dressing was sweet and also tart, and it was served with three slices of lobster tail.  Since it was cold, and there were so few slices, it was hard to taste the lobster in the very bold vinaigrette.  

The other appetizer was spinach and a mushroom and onion tart.  The tart was very delicious, with a very memorable and earthy flavor to the mushrooms, and the tart was so flaky.  The spinach also had a very light dressing which made it very delicious as well.

Main course was a baked salmon dish, which was good, but we were warned that sometimes the fish doesn't cook through, which I said was entirely fine with me, being a fan of sushi and all.  The other main course was a sausage dish that really gave that umami goodness that you crave.  

Finally, we could choose from any dessert on the menu, which worked out great, because each one was about $7 on its own...  Seriously, you simply can't go wrong with any dessert here, so I'll that to your discretion what you want to pick.

Cheese sandwich, $12) and large latte (you can skip it). I thought it's going to be like a regular breakfast sandwich but I'm totally wrong. Why this sandwich is yummilicious? They cover the whole white bread with good quality cheese and grilled until it's got the good crispiness. There's also gooey thick cheese inside with ham so when you bite through, you'll get the crisp and gooeyness together. Don't drool when you read this, please! ;) Cheese lovers out there, you guys will know what's this Foodie lady (me) talking about. Warning: this sandwich is not good for people trying to watch their figure (I believed nothing wrong to cheat while you are in Vegas like me). Just go to the Payard Express to get breakfast because it's not worth it to pay $25 over for a breakfast things. Even the express will cost you almost $20 but with the latte (not a good latte and costed $6, skip!!). In my opinion, I rather get Earl of Sandwich's breakfast sandwich (yummyyyy) and go to Starbucks/Coffee Bean to get my coffee. The downfall of this place is the Customer Service is totally sucks.

(It's interesting that all the 1, 2, and 3 stars reviews are of the pastry counter and the better reviews (at least the one I glanced at) are of the dining room.)

We've eaten lunch at Payard three times over a span of one year.  We've always had great food and excellent service.

The first time at Payard was with a group of five.  Two of us had the Croque Madame (a Croque Monsieur w/ egg).  The others had the charcuterie platter (alas, no longer on the menu): salami, prosciutto/jambon, pate de foie gras, cornichon, several kinds of mustard; chicken pannini; roasted pepper soup with a shrimp salad.  We all had a taste of each.  All dishes were simple yet top-notch in quality and taste.

The second time was just with my SO.  She had the shrimp salad.  I had the soup of the day (potato leek) and the beef panini.  Outstanding again.

The third was on Jan 28, 2010.  Two of us had the prix fixe (as already reported, a fantastic deal at $19): asparagus salad + sea bass, and mushroom tart + couscous w/ roasted chicken and lamb sausages.  Both were amazing, especially the lamb sausages!!!  I had the angus burger.  I ate the whole thing!  :) The desserts included with the prix fixes are good, too.

The service was efficient, friendly (but not overly so), polite (but not obsequious).  The dining room is not huge, so it's not very noisy even when full: great for a relaxing brunch or lunch.",OEKo94b5Dofy2TssYyn4zw,0,0,4,74ZzHen2DzjeYsOTRUl1pA

Coffee was good, standard. Almond croissant was good. They had a thin crust or shell around it that gave it a nice outer crisp. Inside it had a filling, though filling not almond flavored. I think that having a little almond flavor would have enhanced the filling. Sliced almonds on outside of croissant. I bet if it was warmly fresh, would have been great. Croque monsieur was quite delicious. I was impressed. Toast or bread delicately crisped to perfection, outer cheese topping a little creamy and tasty. Ham was a bit cold though inside. I feel it should have been warmed like the rest of the croque. The cook probably thought the rest of the toast would have warmed ham. Everything else about that croque was fantastic. Accompanying salad, some mixed greens, was perfectly seasoned. The croque was $16 with salad, but if you go to the casual eatery outside/next door that has the coffee bar and bakery, $11 without salad.

3169897,2014-10-15,3,AyEtowSGi9vx0-xFfrgjWw,"Just once I wanted to try a non-Starbucks coffee while on my recent vacation to Las Vegas.  At home, we pretty much only have Starbucks so it's always nice to try other versions when we're out and about.

We ordered two coffees on two separate trips.  The first was an iced mocha, and it was wonderful.  Sweet, but not overly so, just like I like it.  Also picked up a bag of caramel popcorn to snack on at the hotel.  To be honest, I'm not even sure we ate the popcorn cuz our hotel kept leaving turndown snacks for us on our bed every evening.  My husband might've dug into the bag, but if not, it was a pricey little table decoration.

A couple days later we went back to try their hot coffee.  Ordered mochas to go, and while we were waiting I watched one of the cooks make crepes.  At that moment, I really really wanted breakfast except that we'd already planned to eat somewhere else.  The crepes looked like a master prepared them - and perhaps that's true.

But back to the coffee.  You know how Starbucks tastes, and then when you go somewhere that's not Starbucks you feel like the coffee tastes more authentic, like the Italian version of a latte instead of an Americanized one?  Well, this is what you get at Payard - authentic tasting lattes.  It was just sweet enough to cut through the bitter coffee taste (I don't like coffee; it all tastes bitter to me), but not so sweet where you walk around all afternoon with a tummy ache.  And the more you drank it the better it seemed to taste.  It passed the test, and I recommend it to anyone who measures all their coffee by Starbuck's standards.

Kind of wishing I had something to say about their food since they had a pretty decent looking menu.  Too bad I'm not a local, or else I'd visit again (for another coffee at the very least).",5n-q5h4xYeJVSNk1TKMMeQ,5,4,4,uwi9b_VtlQbGa5dD2Goetg

Brioche French Toast w/ Sauteed Berries, Whipped Cream: this was good, but not great. Mama's does french toast better. the sauteed berries and whipped cream made the french toast too soggy after it settled down

Service: Seating was limited so we had to wait a good 10-15 minutes. Once we got seated our server was very friendly and responsive. She came back to refill our drinks often and constantly, along with checking to see if we were doing alright with the food. The only thing we didn't expected/liked was the $3.50 charge for hot water, slice of lemon, and a mini jar of honey (which they wrote as hot tea set up on our check).

Price: About $20-25 per person",rn3iFc59YJSUmr_9csUyqw,1,0,5,NZzyX2p90byQGpRcH6Jcdg

The bistro is nice and cozy and you get to watch the chefs cook up your food in the middle of the restaurant. My husband had the brioche french toast with sautÃ©ed berries, it was some of the best french toast I have ever had. I had a hard time deciding because it all looked and sounded so good I wanted a croque, quiche, and eggs Benedict. I settled on the Benedict on the croissant and I was not disappointed. The eggs were cooked perfectly, the sauce was perfect and the best part the croissant. I could have eaten just that it was so buttery and flaky I was sad when it was gone. We also had passion fruit mimosas which I think they used real passion fruit juice Instead of syrup which I really appreciated. They even gave my husband a cup of what he says was great coffee, to go. We then Stopped and picked up a Sicilian, a lemon tart and some macaroons to go. I had a hard time deciding. The Sicilian was good but I wished I had gotten something with espresso or chocolate instead. The macaroons while expensive and not the absolute best ones I have ever had, were pretty good, I think the pistachio one even had real pistachios in it instead of just flavoring in it. When I'm in the area I will definitely be back here, 4 stars though because it is a bit overpriced $80 fir breakfast for  2 of us plus $32 for the take home stuff and in the restaurant there was something sticky all over the seats, my cup had major marks left on it from where the last person drank it, they need to really scrub the rims of the champagne flutes and I wish I had asked them to pack the desserts in separate containers because they had become one dessert in the container by the time I got them back to my hotel room.",OA4qBwe_f-166YohzKhcmA,0,0,4,Z-9AEqhYrykwlB5xVS-AYw

This shop is actually kind of 2 in 1.  One half is the bistro that serves meals and the other half is more the bakery/coffee shop.  I frequented the latter.  In my many visits, I had a chocolate eclair (creamy chocolaty goodness), a pasty called the Louvre (ganache, chocolate mousse and hazelnut wafers), chocolate decadence (another mousse, fudgy concoction), and of course a variety of macaroons.  My absolute favorite was the louvre - it is a knock you off your seat, rich chocolate and yummy hazelnut (which I am a sucker for).  

My complaint here is their service, or maybe more precisely their set up . The line starts at one side, but you can't see the pastries until you are basically at the register to pay - so everyone walks around and it gets confusing (and the attendants don't seem to be much help).  They also do not have all their pastries correctly marked.  Some of the signs were off, so just make sure what you think you are getting is what you actually get.  Prices were what you would expect to pay for dessert at a restaurant.  I thought it was worth it!

3295777,2011-03-13,0,AyEtowSGi9vx0-xFfrgjWw,"Prix fixe all the way. Best under $25 meal i've ever had in vegas. And it's 3 courses. I think that says a lot.

People are obsessed with the buffets in Vegas. Yes, the Bellagio has a decent buffet, but other than that, I don't get much enjoyment out of going to any of the others. This trip out, I just downright couldn't stomach the thought of venturing into another buffet.

Enter Payard. Here's a place known for its pastries, line as long as a Vegas buffet line, just to get pastries from the cafe. If you venture around the left corner of the cafe, you will notice a tiny entrance for dining. Inside, you will find a very small room with a limited number of seats. This is where you want to be, my friends.

I as well as 3 of my friends each ordered the $21 prix fixe. I started with the mustard chicken salad appetizer. The chicken seemed like it was just packaged breast, not very good, but the salad itself was great. So much so, that my friend had to get the recipe from our server.

Main course was Chilean Sea Bass, which as foodies know is most often a snare for generic menu item posing as fine dining. Not this time! Crispy thin fillets of bass, seasoned perfectly and then nestled atop a delicious cylindrical polenta cake, riding atop shoots of sauteed baby asparagus. The asparagus, mind you, had a wonderful flavor (a hint of soy sauce, I am guessing). And then pooling around it, a tangy, yet smooth red wine reduction that went perfectly with each component on the plate. Each morsel of polenta that I forked off of the cake readily absorbed the wine reduction upon dipping. Tres bien. If I could steal this dish and recreate it at home, I would make it every time I had guests over just so I could flood my massive ego with their praises.

And then, of course, for dessert...your choice of a large selection of baked items direct from their famous cafe. I had the Napolean; it was delicious.

I had a  milky cappuccino and an okay chocolate croissant  -  lot's of chocolate.  Most chocolate croissant don't have enough chocolate in them. This one, though, in every bite, had chocolate.

Okay I know we are in Vegas and things tend to be pretty expensive... but that does not mean you should pay a lot for bad tasting food! 

The only reason I wanted something really bad was to put it on my website and since the store looked pretty I wanted to give it a try.  I was keeping an open mind and giving it a chance.  I wasted $10 for a bag of 6 or so mignardises.  They were bland and had a gritty texture.  I almost gagged eating this.

Made a reservation. Which was really smart of me cause the place was pretty packed for a Monday. Service was slowish, there was only one chef and it was like 1:30 pm and I was getting pretty hungry. 

However, once the salmon croque Madame came, all negative thoughts ceased. I took my first bite and mmm. The sweetish bread and cheese with the smoked salmon? TOO perfect. The salmon croque Madame reminded me of my childhood favorite monte cristo sandwiches. 

Anyway, my brothers ordered their soup of the day - clam chowder. It was thick and creamy. So they were too full from that and only ate about half their entrees, which was an omelette and the angus beef burger. I shamelessly stole bites of the angus beef burger. I can barely cook - but let me tell you, the medium rare patty with caramelized onions and sundried tomatoes in between what I think was a pretzel bun, with a slice of melted cheese on too was soo f'ing good. I couldn't stop eating it. 

My mom ordered their brioche French toast with sautÃ©ed berries and whipped cream, it was yummy too. The berries were warm and the bread had a sweet taste to it. I added a side of Nutella and that was a good addition :)

It might help to ask for directions, and if the servers can't point it out, ask for Rao's (the famous Italian joint across the hall). But I assure you that finding the famed Patisserie is worth your while.

I, admittedly, found out about this place via Food Network. As one who love macarons, I had to come by since I was there. 

Since we were already there, we also ordered some ""extras"" (snacks and goodies) to devour. I recall the Lourve, which is a domed hazelnut mousse topped with a dark chocolate ganache. YUM. A dynamite Napoleon which whose crust was very flaky and yummy. Along with a couple other pastries.

Oh and then there's the price... their stuff doesn't come cheap. A bag of macarons (about 6 I'd say) costs about $10. Each pastry is about $7... so yeah... But I suppose it's Las Vegas, things don't go for that cheap there.

They do serve bistro options as well like quiches and sandwiches like panini's.

The Classic Croque Madame Sandwich - a simple and wholesome sandwich with tasty deli ham, melty swiss cheese, and bechamel sauce (dunno what that is, but it must make it taste awesome) between toasted bread with baked cheese and a sunny side egg on top. Ah, thinking about it makes me hungry!

If you've ever had a monte cristo sandwhich, it's pretty similar, but not deep fried, so therefore not as sinful tasting. 

I had the tirimisu for dessert this time - probably my second favorite taste-wise (i adore cheesecake factory's). The presentation and size of this was perfect. It comes in a dish that looks like real glass but is actually plastic. If you walk over to the pastry side next door you'll find the desserts they serve in the restaurant here, other tasty treats and souvenirs not served at the restaurant, and last but not least, plastic silverware that looks like real metal!

Notes and Tips:
-The restaurant is tiny so its not really for big groups. We went with 7 people and there was only one staff doing all the tables. He was able to get us all that we needed, but he looked pretty stressed out!

-The Monsieur Sandwich is the same sandwich but without the egg. The baked tomato in the menu description does not come in the sandwich, it is on the side.

-Sharing is not recommended if you are really hungry. If you're planning on getting your own dessert, or are looking for a light meal, then it is doable.",VubrZCbupbcYlyyWVvCKpg,1,1,5,P_3wO4qJ3tRNSs-DCesQWQ

Every fifteen minutes, an individually boxed truffle comes out of each of the three openings. Luckily there were four of us, so we took over the machine, standing in front of each opening. The anticipation was killing us, but we felt like Charlie winning the golden ticket when the tiny boxes finally popped out. And they were worth the wait!

Our waiter was less than friendly, but the busser was so kind and personable. The bread was fabulous!! French bread and Rosemary focaccia.

The macarons come in a $12 pre-packaged bag (6 assorted bite-sized macarons) and were all stale and flavorless.  None of them had a chewy texture that a proper macaron should have.  

We also ordered a couple of their dessert crepes - which all range from $12 to $15 each.  They were all mediocre and drenched in the same chocolate sauce.

we started off by sharing a caesar salad...had anchovies and a poached egg. it was by far one of the best caesar salads i've had. i followed that with eggs benedict on a croissant instead of an english muffin. it was so light and tasty...i'm a big fan of eggs benedict in general but usually get weighed down with the hollandaise sauce, but the hollandaise at payard had a big zing of citrus which just made it that much better for me. my friend had the braised short ribs and she liked that as well. we both followed it up with dessert...i mean, come on, it's a patisserie...of course you have to have dessert! i had the beaux arts, a cassis mousse, and my friend had the louvre, a chocolate and hazelnut mousse concoction. both were great and can also be purchased at the walk up counter right next door.

after we were done with lunch, we popped in over to the walk up counter and got a ""picasso"" truffle...dark chocolate infused with earl grey tea. a perfect ending.",j8aF-ZCiSfKySt00chEeyQ,1,0,4,EWmtnxWfTnnoseipGwBikA

The place was packed on a Sunday morning and the wait was a tad long but the ladies working the crepe station, the pastry station, and the coffee station were all hustling as fast as they could.

I ordered a bunch of pastries for the whole group:

-Almond croissant
-Cheese Danish
-Blueberry muffin
-Chocolate chip muffin

They all looked good! I didn't try everything but nibbled on some of my family's pastries and then had the almond croissant which was nice and flaky. 

I did get a hot soy latte to go with my pastry and it was good!

I also got some Rochers to go as gifts for people and also bought one for our family. They are good!!! There's one canister that comes with white, milk, and dark chocolate. I still might prefer a ferrero rocher due to the hazelnut spread (nutella makes everything tastier) but I'd still say the rochers were worth trying.",oJXh6bJfAM7krX5MyxCf7w,3,0,4,Iir6DF0IZymZdtz8d0ExOA

I found the decor to be quite charming with a high-end appearance which I really liked.  The wait staff was super-friendly and attentive.  I think we had at least 3 people happily waiting on us and making sure everything was alright.  The bistro kitchen is creatively situated in the center of the dining room so we can watch the chefs freshly prepare our meals.  They, too, were quite amiable, take pride in their craft, and are genuinely pleased to see their clients enjoying their cuisine.

My spinach quiche was fluffy, creamy, and absolutely delicious.  My sister had the braised short ribs, tender morsels of melt-in-your-mouth goodness.  My other sister ordered the croque madame, a ham and cheese sandwich topped with a fragrant, crisp coating of broiled gruyere and finished with an egg.  Each bite was heaven!

And who can forget the desserts?  Payard is known for being an incredible patisserie.  It's funny, I don't remember what we had exactly, but I can tell you that everything was to die for, so make sure you save room for sweets.

3794277,2009-02-03,3,AyEtowSGi9vx0-xFfrgjWw,"We made the mistake of ordering sandwiches here, instead of pastries.

This reminds me of a souped up corner cafe/kiosk (or a gourmet Starbucks/Coffee bean) you find inside a mall, that emulates to be a coffee/tea/juice spot with an over-extended menu. 

Just like Starbucks/Coffee bean, the pre-made, clear-wrapped sandwiches are sitting in the display case at roughly $10 a pop. 
Personal preference: I don't like it when sandwiches are pre-made sitting in display cases. However, they do toast/warm it up for you. 
Sometimes, keeping it simple is the better way to go. It would be better if they just kept it with coffee &amp; pastries to go. 

Overall: I wanted some chicken sandwich with my salt. Good golly, I have no idea how they prepare all their sandwiches. I was so disappointed with the saltiness, I tried the other sandwiches - which were equally, if not more salty as well. Hmf.

My friends ordered the original brioche French toast and the lobster eggs Benedict on croissant. The French toast was said to be too sweet to enjoy or even finish for that matter. The Benedict on the other hand was quite enjoyable and by far the best breakfast dish. It had generous lobster chunks atop a flakey, buttery croissant with a decadent hollandaise sauce. For $24, it was well worth the price, unlike the other offerings.

The French Toast here was really good but it was a bit too sweet. The berries that came with it were warm and really delicious but I feel like it was just a puddle of sugar on my plate.

As much as it was good, just be prepared for the sweetness you are about to consume. If I were you, I suggest the Lobster or Salmon Croissant. Out of this world!


Seating in this place is small. We made reservations a day ahead of time and it was well worth it in case you reach a busy day. This place also has an express cafe next to it if you're in a hurry but that cafe also has extremely limited seating so I suggest you grab a table as soon as you can or you're better off holding it with you while you walk around.

The dining room is pretty small and the service is sub-par. We had to get up and help ourselves to plates and napkins for several of us in the party. I thought we were going to have to go make the food ourselves.

We started out with the assorted pastry basket. The almond croissant was one of the best ones I've ever had. It was flaky, not skimpy on the almond in the middle, and absolutely delicious. The blueberry muffin was okay - it was slightly denser than I prefer, but the taste was good. We also had a cheese danish -- the pastry was great and flaky, but the cream cheese in the center was a little odd.

Then our entrees came - I got the croque madame which is ham, bechamel and swiss cheese in between two slices of bread with a sunny side egg on top. The sandwich was good for the first few bites, then I felt like I was going to keel over from a heart attack. They had put cheese on the outsides of the bread, which was slightly overkill. I like cheese, but cheese inside the sandwich, outside the sandwich, topped with bechamel is a little much. It's a good sandwich, but you could probably share it with someone and avoid clogging all your arteries. The salad that came with the sandwich was a little soggy.

If you go to Payard, get an almond croissant or other pastries to go, and that should satisfy your craving for French food.  I don't think I would go back other than for that.",cSNER_qF_bb1t7kN0kZ44Q,0,0,3,ms-En7K_ifykdQM1ijMAWA

Lemon - Yuck, I didn't take a second bite
Coffee - My favorite one out of the bunch
Strawberry - Super yummy and my other favorite
Vanilla - Yummy too!
Blueberry - OK but nothing to rave about

The texture is actually what I""m looking for.  The outside shell of the macaron was good; light flaky crisp cookie.  But when biting into it I was expecting a chewy, fudgy center, but instead, it was cake like.

Good taste, but I expect a better texture. I'm in a hunt for the best macarons in Vegas :)",ksYpOznbD-22wYpTiacHwA,1,1,3,reY-0TDEycEn5kt9rwnHEQ

I'm no expert when it comes to macarons, in fact, I've only had it once or twice before my experience with Payard.

During my visit to Las Vegas, I've wanted to check out Payard because of the famed grandfather clock, and I got that chance the day when I had to wait in line for the Bucchanal buffet at Caesar's Palace. It's a convenient location, to be situated right across from the buffet. My guess is they probably had an increase of business from the people who had enough of the wait for the buffet during holiday seasons, I know I was tempted.

Which girl doesn't love sweets, right? Couple that with the famed grandfather clock that pops out free truffles, which in itself is a masterpiece to marvel at; and the outstanding reviews on yelp, I've built myself quite an anticipation and expectation for Payard.

While I was waiting in line for the Bucchanal buffet, my stomach started its daily protest and I thought to myself, ""This is the perfect time to visit Payard and get myself those famed macarons."" So off I go to the dessert land.

And... can't be more disappointed.

First of all the macarons were prepackaged inside a plastic bag and were put inside the fridge, which seems like what a mass-production factory would do to packaging goods, but was not attractive at all when it comes to what I assume is top-tier patisserie.

There's no label telling you what flavors are inside, so you'll just have to depend on your palate, or yelp review. I assume the green one is pistachio, and since a lot of the yelp reviews rave about this particular flavor,I decided to start with this. I tried sniffing it, but didn't smell any particular flavor other than something sweet. Next tried biting, and the top layer cracked while the inside remained chewy. But still... I didn't taste anything remotely close to pistachio.

The macarons were small in size, about two bites and I've finished one. So it didn't really help when I only have one of each flavor and each of them was so small that I couldn't distinguish any distinctive flavor for any of it, except coffee.

For ten dollars a bag, my conclusion was I was eating six sweet whatever thingy that was filled with food coloring, and occasionally stuck to my gum if I took too big a bite. I'd rather pay the ten dollars at any bakery and have something that even though tasted too sweet, at least gave me the wonderful aroma of something that came fresh out of the oven and what I could call, comfort food.",R2JIyDE_GQ-DdBwPvix9gQ,0,0,2,hUiq7-6kzb9ZIru1DhfoHA

These sandwiches didn't come with the sides that were shown in the sample plates; I should've asked about that.

Payard Patisserie & Bistro has an extensive selection of savory dishes and sweets, but my visit was limited to a grab-and-go from their side counter where they have some baked goods in a glass display.

The regular croissant was remarkably buttery and soft inside, with a golden crisp exterior outside. I would be hard-pressed to name a distinctly better local rendition (granted, I haven't been everywhere). The orange and almond brioche also was nice and chewy. The flavors coming through but not overbearingly, and the light dusting of powdered sugar didn't throw the balance off at all.

Ever watched those insanely nerve-wracking pastry competitions on the Food Network with the petit fours, and mini desserts, and sugar showpieces, and chocolate showpieces? 

Now find yourself in the middle of Caesar's Palace in a small, well, enclave, where the endless jarring of sensory overload suddenly melts away and you're surrounded by subtle colors and scents...  This is Payard Patisserie and BIstro.  Francois Payard is a very famous, award-winning chef.  I'm not sure if he's M.O.F.  But, he is a portly, jolly-looking fellow.  He was there, dressed in jeans and a chocolate-colored chef jacket, making the rounds on opening day of his new patiserrie in Vegas.  My own personal Santa Claus.

I was so thrilled when I heard this place would be opening the day I was in Vegas.  I had traveled to the state of Nevada to take in some outlet shopping with me maa and my sister at the stateline.  We stayed overnight, and I was so consoled to know that this place would finally be open.  It was such a tease walking by the ""Coming Soon"" wall with the delicious little desserts painted on the wall...  Finally, I get to taste this man's creations!!

The menu features crepes, sandwiches, Croque Monsieur on the savory side; as well as parfaits (hee hee), ice cream, pastries, and of course, those gorgeous looking tarts and such.  We ordered a ham and cheese crepe, a croissant and one decadent dessert called a Vienne with dark chocolate ganache and caramel and orange marmalade and a thin wafer cookie at the bottom.   Aaoaooahaaaoahah it was soooooooooo good!!!!  It was gorgeous and delicious and decadent and lovely and beautiful and velvety and gooey and...just all these damn adjectives.  I could go on and on.

The shop itself is small.  There's no doorway, just some openings around the edge.  There are swirling designs that extend into some of the spaces right at the entrance, with all sorts of goodies displayed in glass.  The colors are all fairly subtle, but so semptuous--lots of chocolately browns and tans.  The chandeliers totally looked like those sugar showpieces made of pulled and blown sugar.  

After we ate and gambled away some time, my sister and I returned to make some purchases at the store.  I wonder if we were among the first to purchase anything aside from the ready-made foods.  The cashiers seemed a little rusty on what items correspond to which names.  I purchased a ""purse"" of truffles and some beautiful pieces of chocolate with assorted nuts.  And I bought two pieces of individual chocolate, you know the perfectly square ones with all sorts of gorgeous decorations at the top.  I purchased a white chocolate rasberry and a dark chocolate with Earl Grey infusion.  I am saving my appetite for all this.  I didn't want to find myself chucking them back on the long and horrendous ride back from Vegas.  I will certainly report back when I try them.

I hope many of you can visit the patisserie in the months to come.  I'm eager to know if there's more coming, or if there are any menu changes.  Happy eating!!",zA12DnH8zntG3HzXpmrYBg,2,2,5,pGpBtnk-q4kGxVMjOzxamg

The croque madame, quiche and eggs benedict were all very tasty. The croque madame bread was nicely crusted with cheese and the egg was perfectly cooked. Much better than any of the other cafe type joints in most of the hotels. 

I had what was one of the best almond croissants I have ever had. Ask them to warm it up for you! It makes all the difference. Only drawback is the seated portion of Payard is on the smaller side so unless you get there early, expect a wait.

It's not a big restaurant so come here early on the weekends if you stand a chance at a table. Decor is definitely a nice Paris patisserie feel to it. The menu is reflective of a French pastry shop with some American real breakfast classics. 

The menu has an excellent breakfast selection : brioche French toast, quiches, croque sandwiches, eggs, omelettes and different types of egg Benedict types. Lunch menu has appetizers, salads, sandwiches and some main plates. All in all something for everyone! 

I had selected the lobster benedict as this was one of my last meals (in sin city) and why not go out with a bang! We ordered this with a side plate of bacon and Canadian bacon. It was rich, decadent and generous. Not sure I can eat a lobster eggs benedict at many places in my life so you have to live a little! Probably one of the most decadent breakfasts I've eaten in my life. It ranks up there with a crab cakes benedict. If seafood and eggs are your game you would love it! My wife thinks seafood in the morning is gross. For me being half Asian I love it! Makes me laugh! Good stuff! 

Their espresso and coffee is on point also. Bonus points for understanding good coffee. Many restaurants fail miserably at this but Payard doesn't dissapoint.

Payard is not easy on the wallet, but if you can get past that, it is a treat to eat at, or pick something up to go.  My wife and I ate there for breakfast two days in a row, not counting stopping in for a snack (best ice cream sandwiches EVER...see below), and for cookies at their express place in the casino.

The breakfast sandwiches are first class.  My favorite was the Salmon Croque Monsieur...delicately smooth, smoked salmon and cream cheese between luxuriously buttered pieces of bread.  Very rich, but very delicious.

Another favorite mentioned in reviews regularly, was the almond croissant.  We had it both at room temp and toasted.  I liked hot, my wife liked it better not.  It was really a tremendous pastry either way...ask for it how you like it!

Our favorite items there were the ice cream sandwiches...At $5 a pop, we had $20 worth in one sitting.  I know that sounds gluttonous, and maybe it was...but they came in 4 flavors and we weren't leaving without trying them all...and it was money well spent.

The magic is that these are two French macarons, about 4-5 inches long, with boldly flavored, creamy textured ice cream in between.  Perfect bite, after perfect bite.

I love the house coffee.  However, I like my coffee with a lot of cream so I usually ask for an extra cup.  I pour half of my coffee into the other cup, happily put in a ridiculous amount of cream, add sugar, and I'm happy!  And someone else gets to indulge in the other half of the coffee.

My friend and I arrived right around 12:30 after having scoured Caeser's Palace and locating Payard waaaaay in the back by the entrance to the convention center space. Payard is a cafe that does crepes, sells macaroons and other confectioneries, and sandwiches. Also, it is a very small bistro that serves breakfast, lunch, and dinner.

The dining room in basically a round room set around the chefs cooking right in the middle. It is an interesting set up, but not one I was very fond of. First off, the chefs were wearing baseball caps. I don't know why this was such a turn-off to me, but it's probably because I don't expect to sit down in a French dining establishment and watch my food being made by a dude in a baseball cap. *shrug*

Let's move on to the food... I started with the artichoke dip, which I thought was magnificent. It was not too soupy, nor too thick and there were actually large chunks of artichoke in it. The bread crumbs on top added a lovely compliment to the dish and the pita chips were a good balance between soft, and yet crunchy on the edges. That being said my friend ordered the Shrimp Panzanella, and it came out looking like a house salad from Chili's with two large shrimps dumped on it. Meh!

Second course, we both opted for the Sea Bass because neither of us were interested in eating chicken. Honestly I am glad it was served with mango salsa because if it had not been I would have been horribly disappointed. The sea bass was cooked very well, but the portion was small compared to the HUGE polenta cake it was placed on. I thought the polenta was strange - it almost tasted/looked like an ugly cornbread muffin from Marie Calendar's (credit to my friend for that description). 

Lastly, dessert - absolutely delicious! Decadent, yummy, chocolatey! Oooo! I had the pont neuf a wonderfully decadent chocolate dessert. If anything I would suggest going to get the desserts here and just eating them on a table outside the cafe. Really the restaurant portion is lacking in the ambiance you would expect while eating French food, especially at the price tag they have here.

They also give you a basket of bread - we had two different types, but I later saw a few tables with three different kinds.  You only get to choose between two options for the appetizer and entree, so we tried both.  The portions were not tiny as I had expected them to be.  We got the:

-Asparagus Salad - This wasn't a real salad.  It was basically white and green asparagus drenched in oil and balsamic vinegar along with ciabatta toast.  It was quite a lot of asparagus.
-Mushroom Tart - Excellent!  Mushrooms were not overpowering and the tart was light and crisp with a semi-sweet cream sauce.
-Sea Bass with Bok Choy and Chocolate Soy Sauce - I think this might have been frozen and not fresh because it came in a round filet.  However, it still tasted good - the sauce was excellent - along with a couple of baby bok choys and carrots.
-Lamb w/ Chicken Cous Cous - Yummy cous cous.  Lamb was cooked very well done in flat sticks akin to flat sausages.  
-Swiss Relief - Mango Mousse and Pineapple Souffle surrounded by Meringue.  I love meringue, though this desert was overall quite sweet.
-Sicilian - Madeline sponge cake filled w/ cream cheese mousse, cranberry jam, and crushed pistachios.  We got this one bc it sounded interesting, and it was!  I liked the cream cheese part the best (sort of like cheesecake) but I wasn't too fond of the sour cranberry jam.

It's so elegantly decorated, I enjoyed just looking at the lights and decor while I ate. Tables and chair seating surrounding a round kitchen in the middle. 

Service:  the waitress was excellent. Super friendly and attentive.   She even threw in a few mini Tabasco bottles when I admired them. Food came out fairly fast.  They could use some bigger water glasses though. 

Food:  I tasted the French toast next to me, and it was very good. I ordered the Lobster eggs Benedict. Wow. It was so decadent. I thought they might put a few shredded pieces in the sauce, but it had big chunks of lobster on it. Plus they serve it over a croissant to make it even more decedent. You have to try it!!!!  It was so yummy!!!

Overall: I really enjoyed the breakfast.  I would love to come back and try the lunch. The Lobster Benedict was just so good. Talk about spoiling myself!  What can I say, I deserve it! :P",-50XWnmQGqBgEI-9ANvLlg,6,5,5,eGoJR48zkYlLHUwLdd7itA

As a local sometimes it's difficult to get to the strip but this is worth the trip. After you park it's a little difficult to find. You actually have to go down Appian Way. This place is near the new buffet. It has a casual side where you can go through and pick up quick things and it has a very small restaurant.  I had the frisÃ©s salad with a fried egg which was so good then the special was Bronzino and then the dessert I had is beyond explanation.  It was like kind of a compacted chocolate and vanilla mousse cake with ganache spread all over it and roasted peanuts throughout. I can't even express how good it was.  This is worth trying for the dessert alone and I think you can go to the express part and just grab some pastries and be on your way.  I will definitely do that next time.,m96igVtonhN98jfF63lr8Q,0,0,5,2C23DLpyUkf9fSTw2if9MQ

The crepes go for around 9 bucks each. Just for something that sounds like 3 ingredients for each. If you would like to add more fruit, 2.50. I think 3 for ice cream. It came out pretty expensive, I think just for a simple breakfast, but its Las Vegas :)

4665023,2014-04-19,2,AyEtowSGi9vx0-xFfrgjWw,"Wow, so sad to have to write a review like this. First off, this review is for the restaurant side, and let me just say that the people working there and the service is VERY good. The people are nice, friendly and attentive.
They just have some other serious issues that bother someone like me, I guess. We all have our own experiences, expectations, and opinions.

While I was standing there waiting, this may not bother you, but I come from the school of Germaphobes. The hostess dropped a menu on the floor and just picked it up and stuck it in with the rest. I know for a fact that that menu would have some floor residue on it and it's going to go right onto your table, where you'll eat off of. If it was me, I would of set it aside to be wiped down when I had a moment.

Moving on....

We were seated and I noticed:
1) a hair on my placemat
2) dried residue on my bread plate
3) crusty dried food on my fork

Then the food came...
-broccoli quiche ($18/$19?): it was just okay, but not worth the price tag if you're also getting the hair and crusty food on dishes and utensils.

-Salmon Benedict ($21): the hollandaise, good thing I asked for it on the side, was thick as molasses, not good in my opinion. 
The salmon is WAY TOO Salty, I'm a house cured salmon lover and this was almost inedible! And trust me, I like my food on the salty side.
The eggs were suppose to be poached but were overcooked and the yolks were like hard boiled. There were also egg shells in there too, swallowed some and spit the ones that I could out. Oy.
The croissant was the only good thing on that plate. 
I called the server over and she was very apologetic and asked if I wanted anything else or to see the menu. At this point, I was too disappointed from also looking at other tables' food, that I didn't want anything else at all. Then the restaurant manager came over to apologize and wanted to see if I wanted anything else. She was most lovely and sincere.
The problem in this place doesn't lie with the service or people, it has to do with, most importantly, the cleanliness and then the food. The level of cleanliness was not on par with the Prices that they charge.

4702224,2014-09-21,4,AyEtowSGi9vx0-xFfrgjWw,"I've had Payard on my list for some time, so Fall Restaurant Week was a great opportunity to visit. Lunch was just $30.14 for three courses plus wine (I can't remember the red choice, but the white was Ferrari-Carano Chardonnay).

The space for dining is very small, so it's a good idea to make a reservation (via OpenTable). The setting is elegant, but casual. It's a great spot to meet friends for a nice brunch. Service was fantastic as well!

Lobster Eggs Benedict on Croissant ($23): I've heard great things about Payard's eggs benedict, so I had to order it. Plus, it's the only menu I've seen that serves lobster on your benny. A buttery, flaky, amazingly delicious croissant is split open to make way for a pile of lobster meat (tail, claws, etc), two perfectly poached eggs, and creamy hollandaise. It's heavenly. Everything was good, but that croissant - whoa!

RW MENU

Tomato Tartine with Shrimp: Diced tomato salad with basil shrimp on a puff pastry. This was seriously the BEST tartine I've had. I mean, a tartine could be anything thrown on top of bread, but that's just it - the delicious puff pastry is what made this dish! The pastry was fantastic and the shrimp was tender and flavorful. Why isn't this on the regular menu?!

Fish of the Day: Barramundi with eggplant ratatouille and romesco sauce. I didn't really care for the barramundi - it's a tougher fish and there wasn't enough flavor in the ratatouille or sauce to balance its mildness.

Black Angus Beef Burger: Peppercorn sauce with kettle chips and mixed green salad. The burger was prepared medium rare and so juicy! The peppercorn sauce was a nice addition as well. 

The server presented eight of their beautiful pastries at the end of our meal for us to choose. I didn't have the RW prie fixe and I still got dessert! How lovely. They have many more pastries that wasn't presented, so there was a list as well and we were more than welcome to choose something that wasn't shown.

Sicilian: Madeleine sponge cake filled with cream cheese mousse, cranberry jam, dusted with ground Sicilian pistachio, and topped with a cream cheese crumble. This was not as good as it sounded or looked. The cake was nice, but the jam was solid and difficult to cut. Not sure if it was supposed to be like that or we had a fluke, but it was blah.

Louvre: Chocolate mousse, hazelnut mousse, and hazelnut dacquoise. I've heard ravings about this pastry, so I knew I had to try it. Yummmm. Creamy and decadent. Really lovely.

Lemon Tart: Lemon curd, almond cream, raspberry, and almond crust. I love lemon everything. The crust was fantastic and I liked the fillling as well. I personally prefer more cream than curd, but it was still delicious.

We went to check out the counter after our meal and I made a couple of pastry selections to take home. I was also obsessed with the Garlic Rolls served with our brunch, so I bought five to take home as well. It's not ususally offered for purchase and I needed to request it with the manager (It was 5 for $4.25). I got a regular Croissant and an Almond Croissant ($4.25/each). Their croissants are so flaky and delicious. The almond croissant was amazing! I would definitely stop by just for an almond croissant to go. Oh, and don't forget the clock tower that dispenses chocolate truffles in adorable little Payard boxes every 15 minutes. The lady at the confections counter was so nice - she gave us three truffles (there were three of us) so we didn't need to wait!",TdYKJgSgY2GF_YJnwsi5yQ,6,5,4,NxpDv0UKk-bysflHnBIZvA

The restaurant is very small.  On a very non-busy time, it's very quaint and would be a nice little place to stop, however, during busy times this place is just weird nuts.  Hard to relax, cross your legs, or whatever, and I always felt like someone was behind me or to the side of me.  One plus is that the main kitchen is actually in the middle of the restaurant, you are actually 20 feet from the chefs and get to watch the cooking processes.  The other side of this restaurant is this is a lot more 'bistro' and a lot less 'patisserie' - if you are in for some pastries you might want to move along.  

We had the French toast and the eggs benedict, the French toast was perfect, berry compote fresh and great compliment to the French toast, perfect 5 star.  The eggs benedict was a little over poached, lobster was perfect and the portion was large, I would give it a 4 star, the hollandaise was a little too tart for my liking.

A local discount at ANY of the strip hotels would be nice since we keep them open in the lean times. 

I was pleasantly surprised and will go back to the hotel just to eat here. It has a few tables but is mostly a take away food place. I was stuck in a long line behind some conventioneers from a gynecology convention but these docs were tame and polite so it was tolerable.

This place is beautifully decorated and pretty similar to Jean Philippe at the Aria/Bellagio.  They have sandwiches, crepes, pastries, coffee, desserts, and other baked goods.  If my stay in Vegas had been longer, I would have tried their crepes.  

Anyhoo, It was about 9:45am when I arrived, and there was a line, but it was moving fairly quickly. I asked the lady behind the counter if she knew which desserts were flourless. I was impressed that since she didn't know, she offered to go inside and ask the store manager.  The store manager wasn't 100% positive either so she also went inside and asked the pastry chef.  After a couple of minutes, she came back and told me that the Sweet Relief and Chocolate Decadence were, indeed, flourless.  I was impressed that they were willing to stop whatever they were doing and confirm for me.  Some places didn't do that, and they shall remain anonymous.    

I ordered both to go and ate the Sweet Relief right away.  It's a giant meringue with pineapple mousse and small chunks of mango inside.  It tasted very light, delicious, and refreshing. I'd definitely get that again.

I ate the Chocolate Decadence later that night, and it was pretty good.  There was more dark chocolate than I would have liked, but it was very soft, spongy, and moist.  Dark chocolate lovers will like this one. If the dark chocolate flavor wasn't as intense, I would have called this my favorite.",9ZvScLtxqxGmIpgP-AeMNA,3,2,5,YTX8EeuxLrXjx0ENdp08BA

Nice place to stop by, but still a little pricey compared to non-strip places. They charge an extra $1 for add-ons, versus the $0.50 at Espresso on the other end of the Forum Shops.

Got a few pastries and spotted on the counter a tube of french macarons. I'm a macaron junkie who hasnt found the perfect one in Vegas yet and crave the perfect macaron from back home in LA. I had to get it as a treat for myself.  I mean a french patisserie should do it up right? NOPE. They were like any other cookies, no finesse of a soft and moist inside with a crunchy outer layer that turns into a chewy goodness like a french macaroon should. No nice cream inside- it was some jams and plain chocolates that would've been decent if the macron was actually made right. They were quarter sized, tiny and $16 for like 8 of them. What a disappointment and a rip off!! I wasn't expecting something close to my favorite back home, but I thought they'd at least do it justice.  

Pastries were good though. One was a opera like cake and that was okay, a pear ganache was yummy, and a good hazelnut one.

Located inside the Caesar's hotel (not the Forum Shops) you'll see this little bistro with a cool looking clock (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/AyEtowSGi9vx0-xFfrgjWw?select=HK3bDDmzc9XWsm7OY_05Og).

What sucks is that you don't get to choose the flavors, everything is preboxed to go.  Not exactly sure as to how fresh these little bad boys were but the texture and flavors were similar to what you'd find at Paulette.  I'd have to say that I think Paulette's were a bit better in my mind.  Perhaps it's the fact that we didn't get to pick and choose the flavors or the fact that one of them was damaged in the box.

It's all nicely done, though I'm not sure if it's that much better than anywhere else - certainly as good as most decent bakeries back home.

I will say that on our last visit, our crepe was not freshly made, but produced rather quickly from somewhere mysterious.  It was still good - make sure you ask about the daily crepe special flavor which is not listed on the crepe menu.

There's a strange gear-filled machine in the center of the place that's supposed to dispense little chocolates for free every so often.

We walk in for brunch at 1045am on a Friday. The guy seating us gave us a weird look, but I didn't think much of it until later. The bistro wasn't busy at all, there were a couple of tables there. Based on the reviews it looked pretty  promising. We understood that it was going to be pricey and we were ready for that. But the price we were paying for the food was not worth it. We ordered an omelette, French toast, eggs your way, and a croque Madame. It was a sad morning in Vegas. Nothing was special. Only 1 for a crispy croque Madame, but other than that...it was not anymore special than a breakfast at Denny's that would have costed no more than half for 4 people. 

The thing that pissed us off the most was the odd service. I hate to say it, but we are raising the YELLOW (Asian) CARD. When we were seated, it took 15 minutes to get water. Not a big deal, we were talking and what not. Finally placed our order and another couple was sat to our right 10 minutes later. They immediately got water and their order taken no less than 5 minutes just being there. We ordered coffee earlier, but the other couple was given coffee and their beverages first along with these tiny side plates. Once we got our side plates we waited for this bread basket that we saw on everyone's table. We watched bread baskets fly by us and around us and nothing landed on our table. Our food arrives and so does the table next to us. They get their bread basket. Keep in mind, no one has asked for a bread basket. Every table has one. 

So we think to ourselves...what are these small plates for?! 

Every table around us got a basket of bread and butter from the bakery next store. And baskets were handed out all around us. Smh. Not like we needed the extra carbs, but it took sooooooooo long to get breakfast. 

As they came to collect the plates, they collected the little plates first that were still clean. Not a crumb in sight. If this was because we were Asian, that's just sad and pathetic.",HXM3Na7T9yqdq1c09SgNrw,3,0,1,FCl3yWy4lvWUJIS_SaFEoQ

Tried a little bit of everything here...great menu offering at a steal of a price!

To start, Wild Hibiscus Mimosa. One came with the Restaurant Week menu...good!  They have many other flavors...I just wanted to try something different.

First course was Escargot! Great rendition, flavorful and tender. I scooped up every bit of the leftovers with the bread afterwards! Yum...good to the last bite.

Entree was the Black Angus Burger ($18): Peppercorn Sauce, Kettle Chips, and Mixed Green Salad. Burger was very juicy and flavorful, but the peppercorn sauce was pretty tame. I thought the veggies were a little distracting as well, but good burger overall.  

For dessert, I had one of 12 choices....and I chose the RIGHT one!!  

The Louvre ($8): Chocolate Mousse and Hazelnut Mousse with a Hazelnut Dacquoise. This was AMAZING. I haven't had a dessert that has blown my mind for a little while...I seriously was smiling with each bite! I will be back to grab this to go!  If you love hazelnut anything, you owe it to yourself to drive to Payard JUST for this...it seriously is THAT good!

Setting is casual cafe...wait staff was very fast and efficient, not so much friendly or smoozing...which I didn't need anyways.  Quick with the refills and the check...great lunch!

I will be back for that damn Louvre!

It seems like she ignored us on purpose. I got our coffee only after several minutes.",hXhXXvETyZEbo5PPb3hHbQ,0,0,1,MQ_Y-ilPXxJboL0fBsBsIA

I've heard of casinos making it hard to find the exit, but never one that made it hard to find the restaurant! We had to ask for directions from no less than three employees. It *was* worth it though. The $14 ""basket of pastries"" (which was at least $5 more than it should be) was excellent. You get to choose three. I have absolutely no complaints about the yummy chocolate banana walnut muffin. The orange almond brioche was good but not orangey enough, and was actually a little bland. The almond croissant was the best of the bunch. It was just the right amount of flaky with a light dusting of powdered sugar.

The $16 almond toast (at least $7 more than it should be) was good, but it kept gnawing at me that it wasn't that different from what we make at home. All we needed to make it Payard-style was to add some slices of tomato and a fried egg.

The food was excellent but the prices so high for what we got (and I'm used to Bay Area prices), I had to knock it down one star.

I've been to Chef Payard's New York store, and enjoyed the desserts there so we were very excited. Reservations were at 9:00 pm and we left almost at midnight. We ordered the dessert tasting which came with 3 dessert courses we select from($45) and added the dessert wine tasting ($20) to that. It took forever for each dessert course to be served to us, we could definetly tell it was their dry run.  It was a treat that Chef Payard was there making the desserts himself along with some other chefs.  The desserts were definetly delicious, along with the wines. But I'm giving this place a 3 star because of the service and hoping it will get better our second time around.

The vegetarian quiche with sundried tomatoes, broccoli, and artichoke hearts makes for a delightful melt-in-your-mouth light brunch. Payard's is definitely worth a visit if you love pastries and sweets, although it comes with a hefty price tag, too ($4/pastry).

5199187,2012-02-15,10,AyEtowSGi9vx0-xFfrgjWw,"I may be a closet quiche-lover. Some mornings I wake up, and it is the only thing I want to eat. Somehow, though, I only have quiche twice a year it seems. Is quiche really this evasive? Not at Payard. 

When I woke up craving quiche on The Strip, I decided it was time to give Payard a whirl, and when the first item on the menu was a broccoli and tomato quiche, it was the only place for me! We had to wait about 15 minutes for a table, as the  restaurant is quite small, but I was just fine with that because I wanted that egg pie delight!

How was it? It was good. The texture and flavor were everything I hope for, but I would have loved more broccoli. The crust was a bit disappointing as it didn't have that pleasing texture that breaks smoothly when you apply pressure. It was the teeniest bit chewy, perhaps a result of overcooking. It came with a tasty side salad and a ""roasted"" tomato that was a bit cold and covered with spices that I could have done without. I would have appreciated a simple, beautiful, truly roasted tomato. 

The food was not disappointing really, but what was disappointing was the dining experience. The service is delightful, but it is a small spot, so if you come as a party of two, you will likely be seated within hearing distance of another party. Then, you get to spend your meal listening to the latest ins and outs of family drama or how the Caesars business center is a ripoff. Am I nosy? Perhaps, but it is hard not to hear when they are less than one foot away. This factor would probably prevent me from heading back immediately, unless I have a large party that can simply talk louder than everyone else!",qewG3X2O4X6JKskxyyqFwQ,12,10,3,sn61BfouRko4Dz0yW07v_w

Ordered crepe supreme, cuban press sandwich and opera cake.

Crepe supreme ($11.00): buckwheat crepe filled with chicken and mushrooms smothered in a mornay sauce.  I guess I don't like wheat when it comes to crepe.  The chicken has a weird smell and I don't care for its sauce.  The sauce is too thick yet very bland. I couldn't even eat half of it.

Cuban press sandwich ($10.00): shaved lean roasted pork loin, provolone cheese, pickles, dijon, mojo marinade on ciabatta bread.  The meat is good but for some reason I don't really care for it.  I usually love cuban sandwich.

Opera cake ($7.00): good but slightly too sweet and heavy.  It's almost like eating full cream instead of airy mousse.  I prefer Jean Phillipe's pastries because I don't feel guilty eating them since it's so airy and not too sweet.

What is that noise?  I saw everyone was staring at the clock.  I was leaving but I had to know what that was. 
Clock guy: Don't go away!!
MC: *I heard: go away* what?
Clock guy: It's coming
MC: What's coming?
Clock guy: The chocolate?
MC: For me?
Clock guy: yes, free chocolate.

Thanks clock guy.  I got a box of yummylicious truffle inside a cute box.  It's so delicious and I detected happy hour inside the box.

The service is not friendly except the clock guy.  You really need to smile and say thank you and please do not run over your customers who are waiting in line.  Yes, you did it twice, monsieur.

I usually go to Crepe Expectations in Henderson - yup, I pretty much travel all over the valley for good eats - but, wanted to try Payard based on reviews and they use buckwheat crepes like in Paris (crepe expectations uses more of an egg based crepe, still delicious, just different). Overall, Payard makes a good crepe, but strip crowds are not my friend, though it usually doesn't bother me, on this Sunday there was a convention in full swing, I waited in line bout 15 minutes to order and then, they mentioned crepes were busy so, there was a 20 minute wait. The upside, at least protocols call for mentioning the wait/backup. I thought that was nice.

I ordered the Crepe Madame, sans the ham, which leaves cheese and egg for $10.50. It was good but I wish they had more topping options especially if you are holding the meat.

Bottom-line, I am glad I tried it, but, probably won't go back unless I am already in Ceasar's and hungry.",krdKDJfXT4EKZwWcOrW2wQ,1,1,3,fQaMFTiiVYggFeWljbQOkQ

It was actually dinner time, but we had planned on just snacks and dinner afterward.  I was tempted to get a crepe since I was pretty darn hungry, but decided to just grab gelato instead.  I ordered good 'ol fashioned chocolate.  It really hit the spot, creamy smooth.  Kids and my wife had a variety of flavors including mango sorbet, raspberry sorbet, coconut and vanilla.  There's plenty of space to roam and look at other options on display as well as a few tables just outside the actual restaurant. 

Service was quick and friendly.  The cashier had some very good suggestions.  My daughter was just hoping to get three small scoops, since she eats like a bird anyway.  However, the server didn't tell my daughter that three scoops was going to be GINORMOUS!  Prices are fairly reasonable for Caesars.

There was also a convenient bar right outside with TVs, video poker and charging stations under the bar itself, which came in very handy.  Both are located right outside the Bacchanal buffet inside Caesar's Palace.

We didn't make reservations for breakfast.  Oops.  Thank goodness they were able to seat us.  It's a brief menu, but the items on it sure did sound delicious.  I was torn between the Lobster Eggs Benedict with waffles and the Salmon Croque Madame.  In the end, I chose the Salmon Croque Madame.

Wish I picked the Lobster Eggs Benedict.

But the food was delicious.  My food came with two runny eggs (I like runny eggs) on top which heightened the flavor of the dish.  Without it, my dish would probably have been ""blah"", and I would have been terribly disappointed.

The service was lacking.  For such a snooty place, I felt our waiter was a bit rude to my friend and I, consistently serving the table next to us, and ignoring any of our breakfast needs.  Yes, water was refilled and coffee replenished, but not by our waiter.  Our waiter barely ever stopped at our table.  To the waiter who served us, you are lucky you were redeemed by the smiling man who refilled my water.  But the tip was for you, and I hope you realized that.

We took a quick stop at the bakery/cafe/bistro place next door to swipe some other goodies like packaged chocolates and an almond croissant for the road.  The almond croissant was delicious.

5279134,2009-10-14,3,AyEtowSGi9vx0-xFfrgjWw,"Fortuitously as I was making my way toward to the entrance to meet my friend I happened past Payard and decided to stop in just to browse.  Speaking with the friendly young lady behind the counter I was informed that since they were getting close to the end of the day anything left in the case was buy one get one.  ""Bogo on amazing french pastries?"" I thought - I'd be a fool to pass that up.  Selecting two they were packed into a pretty plastic container and I went to meet my friend.  Offering my pal his selection he told me he had just finished dinner with his wife and was stuffed - but he did try a bite of each.

Starting first with the Tiramisu - not French, but a must almost anywhere I see it - the dish was served fancifully in a plexi-glass square.  Layers of vanilla mascarpone, rum soaked lady fingers, cream, and dusted with cocoa and a bit of chocolate drizzle the dish actually hid a surprise - a core of Raspberry.  While my sister would have been greatly upset by this unannounced guest I have to admit I liked the manner in which the fruity sweetness balanced the dark cocoa tones and heavy rum.

The second dish, one of Payard's signatures, was vastly more impressive than the tiramisu - it was called Louvre.  Featuring ""Chocolate mousse and hazelnut mousse with a hazelnut dacquoise"" and topped with a thick 72% dark chocolate shell I can only compare this dish to one thing (something that doesn't do it a bit of justice,) a nutella version of a peanut butter cup.  With the gelatinous shell giving way to a milk chocolate mousse, then hazelnut mousse, then a hazelnut cookie...a beautiful blending of textures, tastes, and not heavy at all.

All said, Raku with tax and tip, a cab ride, coffee, and two pastries from Payard cost me less than Colors of Caviar would cost a la carte at Guy Savoy - sure ""Colors"" has vastly more ingredient cost, but that just goes to show that for the discerning foodie you can indeed do some fine dining in Vegas without totally breaking the bank.  While I'm certainly not going to say that a split meal at Raku and Payard is in any way comparable to dinner at Savoy or Robuchon, I do believe that during future culinary trips outside of Ohio I'm going to make sure at least one place is ""off the beaten path""",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,4,3,5,OTGNRPcKQelFPvSs-Sp6tQ

Overall, this is a nice place. I'm giving it 4 stars based on the tasty food and the atmosphere. Things that might get it bumped up to 5 would be: stellar service, lower prices, more menu choices.

There is not a lot of variety to choose from. We ate at both the sit-down cafe with servers, and the take-out section next door. Both are overpriced and mediocre. The only items that are decent are the quiche and some of the pastries, such as the almond croissant. 

For the cafe with servers, the ham and cheese quiche is good, and it is paired with some salad. The continental breakfast comes with 2 drinks (coffee, tea, milk, or juices), 2 pastries, and fruit salad for $22. The almond croissant is yummy, but the cheese Danish is not flakey. Some of the berries in the fruit salad tasted funky, and upon closer inspection, it appears that some  of the raspberries has gone bad with black spots. When I pointed this out to our waiter, he said that the black dots around the top of the raspberries were just stains from blackberries. I have posted a photo so you be the judge. 

For the take-out eatery, we got the CÃ´te d'Azur and Exotic smoothies ($12 each), and they were a bit too runny for my taste. The ham and cheese crepe was soggy, and the chicken cocktail sandwich was quite dry, especially the chicken. 

Overall, for $40-55 for two people, Payard is a bit pricey, and the food is not up to par. I would only come for the almond danish and maybe some other pastries. Think of this place as a bakery rather than a restaurant.",28GvL338IP1NZHmQMrK6gg,3,0,2,CirVYyi9M6Oddv_mH_dw1w

The service was one star, barely. We were a party of three, and we did get seated fairly quickly (within twenty minutes) for a Sunday morning. We sat down and figured out fast what we wanted to eat, since we were all pretty hungry. 

Then we sat and waited for someone to come over and greet us, give us water, ask if we wanted coffee...anything. Waited and waited and waited. If we hadn't already invested almost 40 minutes by that time (waiting to be seated included) we would have left. Finally someone came over to give us water.

I didn't care for some of the attitudes of the employees working there. Not all of them had an attitude, on the contrary some were extremely sweet. However the cashier who rang us up just wasn't really friendly. 
I figured this place was expensive but we didn't want to go crazy and order everything that looks good so I asked how much a large coffee was. And she looked so annoyed that God forbid I asked about the price of something. So she responds, "" a dollar more than the small"". I don't see why you couldn't just tell me the price of the large. I don't even know what the price of the small is. I just didn't care for the way she responded.

In the center of the shop, an intricately scrolled chocolate clock stands majestically, its gears accented with a bronze patina, releasing chocolate truffles down chutes as it chimes. That its chime is reminiscent of Pink Floyd reminds you that you are still in Las Vegas.

Payard's artisan chocolates, caramelized almonds, coconut confections, macaroons, and preserves are also available for purchase in the shop.

I've heard so much and read about Payard PÃ¢tisserie & Bistro at Caesar's Palace and didn't think about trying it because I felt it's no different then any other Pastry restaurant in Vegas. I was looking to avoid having a heavy breakfast so I can watch my diet and my Mom suggest I eat at Payard because it's so quick when you're on the go. But really, I just wanted grab a quick bite and head back to my slot machine. LOL

I only ordered a cheese danish and large coffee and came out pricey as always. The food was average, noting special, next time, I'll order a bigger meal to write a lengthy review. Staff at Payard very helpful and informative about their menu and the store reminds me of the pastry bistro at the Paris Hotel. I'd come back to grab a quick bite or have a sit down lunch, for now, I'll give it another shot.

I loved when the waiter brought me the dessert menu and told me I could choose from any of them. I half expected a cup of sorbet to come out, since the desserts are $7 alone.

However, when you want a real breakfast that doesn't include chafing dishes or thirteen ways to cook an egg, you come to Caesars. Maybe after a few successful (or not) rounds at the craps table or a few pulls at those fancy (and loud!) slot machines, travel your way to Payard. 

Once there, you'll order the coffee. It's La Colombe! Strong, delicious, and a taste of Philadelphia. (Quick tip: They constantly fill your cup with coffee. You never see the bottom of the cup during your meal!). Then, you order the lobster eggs benedict. No need to even see the menu. Just trust me, and order it.

It's decadent with luscious chunks of lobster, a perfectly poached egg, melt-in-your-mouth goodness of a slightly tangy hollandaise sauce over a flaky and crusty croissant.  It's delicious and very filling. $21, and so worth it.

Over at the bake shop, order the louvre! It's a beautiful work of art and a chocolate lover's dream. It's a small cake filled with chocolate and hazelnut mousse covered in more chocolate. 

Once you're done, head over to the unique chocolate clock that hands out truffles every 15 minutes! You're a winner every time.",i84YDhPbxtq9F8ipmtR5vg,4,3,5,UDA2H58X5CJrXswutvQ1Kg

Anyhow, my girls got the actual breakfast - quiche and eggs, while I opted for the tasting menu.  The halibut was cooked medium rare, and served in a tiny casserole pot, complete with thinly sliced potato and tomato, in a beautiful presentation.  The butter was over the top, but I hardly ever consume it, surely it's okay?

Espresso is delightful - strong, crisp, slightly acidic....mmmmmm.......

I had the iced latte from the patisserie on the day we left and it was a bit disappointing.  More milky than strong, but still delicious.  I wish I had gotten a sandwich, but having a one hour flight wouldn't be wise to spend $10 on a sandwich.",T6zcfyO8eR2Py9V_bK_K4w,0,0,4,L7Y1t-YcHEaP8SXmxRyxOg

Breakfast Nosh:  My cousin waiting in line at the crepe/ice cream counter... this line was ginormous.  Luckily, not too long she realized that there is a seperate counter for coffee, water, etc.  She bought her water, her coffee and amerged from the crowds quite quickly to the table I was stitting at.  She immediately directed me to the coffee counter where I got my own water, coffee and a nice cup of fruit.  The fruit was kinda pricey ($8) but it was delicious, fresh and most of it was cut up into smaller pieces, so you do get your money's worth of the fruit, because it's packed in there. 

After Dinner Dessert:  After a splendid dinner at RAO's Italian Bistro, we decided to pass on dessert and swing over to our good ole pal, Payard.  After 3 glasses of wine into the evening, we ended up buying a berry napoleon, six macaroons (assorted flavors), and two white chocolate covered strawberries.  Prior to going back to our room to have our ""cousin dessert and wine (yes, we stopped off at the gift shop for a bottle of wine) slumber party.  Here's how that went down: 

 - Berry Napoleon:  To die for.  Flaky.  Not to sweet. You could still taste the berries and it is not overpowered by the creme.  Delish!  Definitely our fave of the night. 

 - Macaroons:  Okay, these are the flavors i remember:  Pistaschio, Strawberry, Lemon, Raspberry.... and 2 more i forgot.  Delish.  Soft, with a hint of yummy flavor.  You want to keep eating just to enjoy the flavors. 

 - White Chocolate Strawberry:  This was your standard chocolate strawberry.  If you crave it... get it.  But it wasn't something you couldn't get elsewhere.  

Day we were leaving Vegas:  My cousin wanted to buy some macaroons for her dad.  They ran out of all the smaller bags.  So they were telling her she would have to buy the box.  The box is not cheap. She ended up not getting it.

I sent him the link in case he had time to pick me up some and he did :D 

He brought back home two pre-filled 6 packs of assorted Macarons and told me that you had to order in advance if you wanted specific flavors.

He bought macarons but by the time he landed in San Jose, they became crackarons. Since they were in the plastic bags, they got smushed into his backpack. I didn't mind at all since I was blown away by how good they still were! 

I must say that it was indeed the best macarons  (or should I say crackarons) I've ever tasted...

""Vanilla - Induces the simplest of sensations, providing an enticingly enriched twist of a classic taste.
 
Pistachio - Is an amply nutty experience with the subtle pleasure of the original French staple. 
 
Coffee - Evokes the pleasure of sipping on a cup of the finest brew while incorporating a delightfully nutty flavor.
 
Raspberry Lychee - Smoothly surprises the senses with a sharp, yet satisfying touch of raspberry and exotic flavor of lychee.""
-Description taken from the website (I just learned that Payard came from NY's chef francois payard) http://www.payard.com/

So we are very lucky to have a Payard on the West Coast since it's only in New York, Japan, and Korea at the moment. 

Around the Bay Area, I thought that I preferred the fruity flavors like passionfruit and lemon only because they weren't overpoweringly sweet... However, Payard makes them perfectly.. The coffee tasted just like coffee and the pistachio was one of the best I've ever had. The Pumpkin Spice even surprised me a little because I'm not a fan of pumpkin. Vanilla was one of my favorites. 

I'm gonna have to return and buy a box of 20 macarons, pick up another dessert, and try lunch there.

We settled on a lemon sugar crepe ($7) with strawberry ice cream (add $2.50). I love lemon and this crepe was pretty tasty, but overall still quite plain. Next time I would go for the berry or Nutella crepe. The addition of the strawberry ice cream added some contrast and additional flavor to what would have been an otherwise very boring crepe.

We also purchased ten small chocolates ($1.50 each). They are available in pre-packaged boxes, but are cheaper when you select them from the display case (and you can pick the exact flavors you want!). My favorites were the praline truffle and the coffee flavored ones. They were all rich and creamy and easy to share and savor. 

Seating at cafe tables is available just outside of the restaurant, just stay away from the casino area if you don't want smoke engulfing you. (Take out also available.) There are also restrooms right around the corner and even an available outlet if you need to charge your phone. ;)

Before my trip to Vegas, I made sure to bookmark Payard Patisserie.  

Francois Payard, famous pastry and chocolate Chef from France.  His only West Coast Patisserie and Bistro is here at Caesars Palace. 

Set right in the Casino near the restaurants and the Apian Way shops, I was so excited when I finally saw the big glowing ""Payard"" sign! I had died and gone to pastry heaven! 

Upon entering you notice the beautifully arranged and fully stocked truffle and chocolate counter.  Further walking in, my eyes finally laid on the pastry counter.  Just as the chocolate was fully stocked, so were the pastries.  Now this is exactly how to sell a product. No matter what time of day, even in late afternoon to evening when pastires are usually sold out, Payard continously restocked sweets to entice folks like me.

I didn't know where to start.  But here's the damage:

* Banana Creme Tart:  The custard on the was flavorful and fluffy. There was a nice subtle banana flavor throughout, but minimal sliced banana's in the tart.  Overall, you get banana flavored custard. 
* Fruit Tart:  I'm a fruit tart lover.  A must for me when I go to a bakery.  The fruit tarts here at Payard were prepared beautifically with a good variety of fruits on top...but the crust on the top was too soft, and broke apart very easily.  I like to eat my tarts with my hands, so it was quite diffcult to do so with this kind of crust.  
* Apple Tatin:  Refreshing dessert with whole apple slices in the middle.  Texture was a bit too jellow-y in my opinion but caramelized perfectly on the exterior. 
* Lemon Tart:  Skip.  Way too lemon-y to where the sour flavor over powered everything else in each bite.  Also way too sweet to where one bite ruined my palate, you can even feel some of the sugar crystals left over in the glaze. *yuck* 

Payard Patisserie also has a crepe counter and a delicious display of Gelato's as well.  Holy moly!  I also ordered myself a cup of the Mango flavor.  I like my gelato icy and they did an awesome job here.  The mango flavor was powerful and refreshing.  
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/AyEtowSGi9vx0-xFfrgjWw?select=fQu-0yoC5jj0Hw7RTcVq3g

While the desserts weren't bad here, it's the prices that were a bit painful.  Each pastry was $7.00 each, and a regular cup of the gelato was $5.00.  

The staff here at the bakery are also very incompetent and unfriendly.  It wasn't even busy when I visited, and yet they still don't have the energy to ask if I needed help.  Apparently there is only one line to order for all three different counters.  They neglect to inform you of this one line, so I'm left standing the other counters waiting for service like an idiot.  

Overall, Payard Patisserie does a great job in terms of presentation, nothing particularily stood out for me, as certain items had too much overbearing flavor, or not enough.  They failed to balance sweet and savory in my opinion.  

Will I be back?  Maybe...but please hire more informative and helpful staff.",uMpWu7hSowxC2v25Nv9wbg,11,10,3,6eUW-HcncuFM08rpkPkfFQ

I got the assorted pack of Macarons--Vanilla, Pistaccio, Raspberry, Chocolate, Coffee, Passionfruit.  They are quite pricey compared to my favorite Macaron bakery in Chicago, and since this is ""Payard"" I was expecting taste bud bliss at first bite. 

The flavors were amazing--the raspberry and passion fruit being my favorite. Every flavor true to it's namesake. But the light crunch of biting into a macaron just wasn't there.  It was like biting into a soft cookie--and I really don't like soft cookies--give me a bit of crunch anyday.  Now these just may be how Payard makes their macarons, but color me a little disappointed.  Plus packaging in a cellophane bag?  Every place I've purchased Macarons uses little boxes--you don't want to crush those little gems up!

Perhaps they need to look that word up in the dictionary because this place doesn't deserve the title in the slightest. A lot of the items are prepackaged. Big deal, you have macaroons and croissants. That does not make you a patisserie. The pastries were very limited and shortly after 8am they barely had anything and it's not like the place was even particularly busy either. The employees aren't the nicest either. They make you feel like you are disturbing them by ordering. It's totally not what I expected at all. Skip this place and go down to the Bellagio instead and go to a proper Patisserie! Jean Philippe is the best you are going to get. At least they have an actual assortment of baked goods and desserts.  

That being said Payard's almond croissant was just okay and unnecessarily overpriced. Were the almonds made of gold or something? I know it's Vegas but come on!

5886766,2010-02-10,2,AyEtowSGi9vx0-xFfrgjWw,"During a recent trip to Vegas, we had a few places in mind that we just had to try; Payard was one of those places. It's located somewhere in the maze of a hotel that is Caesar's Palace... both times we ate there we nearly got lost, but alas we were able to find it and indulge in some of the yummiest breakfast/lunch food in Vegas. 

Payard is made up of two parts; there is a breakfast/lunch sit down restaurant and an attached walk-up pastry/chocolate counter. We tried both parts during our vacation. First was the actual restaurant... we slept in a little too long for breakfast, but we ate lunch and were able to get a couple of lunch items that were very 'breakfast-y' anyway. First thing we noticed was the decor... the set up of this place is awesome; the colors and overall style of the place is just very vibrant. Additionally the kitchen is a circular area in the middle of the restaurant... so nothing is hidden; I love that! 

We ordered the french toast which came in a bed of fresh fruit and some kind of fruit flavored sauce. The flavor was amazing, not too heavy but very rich and flavorful. Next we ordered eggs florentine which was served on a crispy crescent roll... and we also got a side of bacon. All in all each part of the meal was near perfect... taste was outstanding and everything just seemed very fresh. A couple days later we also tried the pastry counter, and ordered a ham/cheese sandwich type thing (don't remember the actual name they called it) along with an apple crepe. Just like the restaurant itself, it didn't disappoint. Heavy on flavor, not too greasy, and oh so rich... it hit the spot perfectly. 

Payard is the type of place I love... solid food and a classy atmosphere, while not being ridiculously priced. It's earned a spot for us as a 'go-to' Vegas breakfast/lunch spot from now on. Can't wait to go back and try their full breakfast menu. This place gets my stamp of approval, next time you're in Vegas if you can find this place... give it a shot!",9Lskp3870EP6fGbI9V6ZMQ,3,3,4,oBIWgrO23qrwoDuZPynv2w

Two days we found ourselves grabbing a bite here to go. The first day we had coffee with  a muffin and a pastry. I had a blueberry muffin which I found on the dry side. One companion agreed that the muffin was dry, the other felt it went well with the coffee. The cheese pastry tasted like any other cheese pastry. Nothing special except the $4+ price.

The second meal here we had actual breakfast. I had the veggie crepe. While ordering, I was quickly reminded by the cashier that these items were premade and could not be customized in any way. Ok. No problem. I liked that there was a menu item with no meat, cheese or sauce. The crepe was made with a buckwheat crepe, which was also appreciated. I don't remember the name of the other crepe ordered, but it was creamy with chicken. I hear it was good, but the person who ordered this felt nauseous after the meal. I'm not saying it was due to the crepe, but it might have been. The last item was the croque monsieur. I didn't did dare take a bit because it looked gooey and cheesy.

The restaurant is located right beside their big pastry shop.  It is a very cute, small and intimate place with less than 15 tables.  The kitchen is clearly an open concept and positions itself right in the middle.  On the night, it featured a Mexican chef.  The smell of food was good enough to prep your brain for saliva secretion.  Service was excellent.  Staff were polite and very friendly.  Menu is relatively small comparing to most french restaurants but we can live with that.

We ordered braised lamb shank and a steak medium wear but no appetizer as we were not very hungry.  Our dishes came together on warm plates at a reasonable speed.  Presentation was good; definitely had put some thought into it.  The potato and veg side dish were fresh, sautÃ©ed and seasoned just right.  But the main lamb shank and the steak were both on the dry side.  My husband's steak was done passed medium.  More like a well done.  Taste-wise, the steak and the shank were a-ok but not outstanding.  It would be much better if they had given it more time and ingredients during the marinating process.  

We regretfully told the waiter about the dryness when he came checking but we were almost done.  He immediately apologized for it and notified the Manager.   For a pleasant surprise, he offered us a complimentary tiramisu in return.   It turned out the tiramisu was EXCELLENT!  it was one of the best we have tried.  It was smooth & creamy with the right consistency.  The cake layer was moist and smooth with a good balance of rich dark coca and coffee.  

As we were about to leave, the table next to us was really happy with their dishes and told the chef & manager that ""these dishes are exquisite and phenomenal beyond words to explain"" but we don't know what did they order.

The decor? Preps you for dessert! Everything just reminds you of chocolate chocolate chocolate! Mostly dark brown hues complemented by lighter beige.

Croque Madame

The best one I've ever ever had! Not just even slightly better, 10 times better than all the other ones! The bread was toasted to perfection, somehow they worked it so that it was flaky on the edges (perhaps some toasted cheese). Everything worked really well together from the egg in the middle to the cheese they melted on top and then of course the super toasty bread that I just loved. There was salad on the side too.

Eggs Benedict served on a croissant
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/AyEtowSGi9vx0-xFfrgjWw?select=VTDmXd1AdVBLlo31ow1Uyg
When they first put the plate in front of me, my first thought was that they had over toasted the croissant! But then, as I dug into the rich hollandaise sauce with the perfectly poached egg I understood why. They definitely were not light with the sauce and combined with the egg, it needed the crunchy toasted croissant to offset some of that richness. Plus if it wasn't toasted enough it would've become just a very smushy croissant instead. So delicious...but so rich. Order this...but make sure to switch plates halfway as the amount of egg yolk and butter will put you in a food coma for the rest of the day.

Macarons
I was a bit disappointed that these were already packaged up and not sold individually, but oh well. Yummy nonetheless. These were made with the cookie being very light and the jam not extremely sticky. Neither was it chewy, just melt in your mouth. So light that if you bit into one, the whole thing didn't just crumble away but held together. The flavors they had in the 5 pack I believe were chocolate, coffee, strawberry, raisin, and lemon. All very good with the flavors being very natural and non artificial tasting.

Chocolates

Had to try these of course right? He is known for this stuff...and rightly so. The chocolate shell is made so that when you bite into each piece it doesn't just crack away but goes with the filling. And each piece had so much clear flavor for such little bites. My faves were the rocher noir and the truffles.The rocher noir was dark chocolate and wafers. Oof...I could eat a whole bag of these, very very addicting. Light and fluffy yet crunchy at the same time. The truffles...melt melt in your mouth!!!

I'm definitely coming back here next time I'm in Vegas. Oh...don't forget to check out the macaron tree in the front display too!

Berry crepe: Small yet delicious. I do think that Jean Phillipe has better sweet crepes as the crepe skin here is a bit too dense (its folded into a square) for my liking.

Banana caramel crepe: I actually did not like this too much. Too sweet for my liking and the skin seemed even denser as it was drenched in heavy syrup. It's not bad for those of you super sweet tooth people though.

White chocolate mocha: VERY good! Sweet and you can definitely taste the white chocolate (most places just taste like sweet syrup). A hint of light espresso...very yummy!

Fruit cup: Fresh fruit...VERY fresh fruit. I don't like how the melons and pineapple were chopping into tiny pieces, but I can see how some people would like it. Fruit is sweet and yummy, but for $8...owch.

Savory madame crepe: Swiss cheese, ham, sunny side up egg. Wow. Each bite was overflowing with melted cheese and it was just a mouth explosion! I would definitely get this!

Chocolate trio: White chocolate is AMAZING! Sweet and delicate...dark chocolate is yummy too, light and not bitter. Surprisingly, milk chocolate paled in comparison to the other two, but it wasn't bad.

Macaron: Pistachio is full of nutty almond-pistachio flavor! DELICIOUS! Passion fruit is also full of flavor and good, and the vanilla bean blew my mind! You can taste the vanilla bean (none of that fake vanilla crap) and it is definitely the best I've ever had. The purple macaron which I can't figure out what it is...is not so great. That one tasted completely off, but other than that...amazing!

Overall, this place is big competition for Jean Phillipe in terms of savory crepes and drinks. Less of a line and smaller store than Jean Phillipe, making it a good alternative as a breakfast or quick snack place.",0uEqdNTVj-I7zM83bbcgsg,0,1,4,1agzKB88427uMb_c67l5iQ

I was skeptical at first, but I decided to go for it as all my other friends ordered the steak and eggs.

They actually give you a large generous amount of lobster on top of buttery flakey croissants. I was stuffed.. It was definitely worth every penny. I tried their steak and eggs, no where near as good as the lobster eggs benedict.

Pricey, but amazing",zpB6UXczhM2vYpBjwlwbJg,4,4,5,pI_ZtJCXw3jEtJ_JfK5rpg

Upon approaching the little Patisserie I thought it was decorated quite nicely, but it was missing something. It wasn't as inviting as I expected. As I approached the display cases I was let down. I felt like the disappointed kid in the Willy Wonka film that blurts out ""That's all?"" when the little gum pops out of that fancy machine. The delicacies in the display cases didn't look amazing or enticing at all. 

I decided to sample a pistachio eclair because when I lived in Florence there was an amazing bakery near the Lion's Den that had delectable pistachio eclairs that I adored. I must sadly report that the Payard pistachio eclair didn't satiate my longing for one of those Florentine pistachio eclairs. The ganache on the top was too sweet and gooey and they had shoved some raspberry filling in there along with the pistachio filling. I'm a fan of raspberry but I didn't welcome the presence of the raspberry because I purchased a pistachio eclair not a raspberry eclair! the Raspberry was overpowering and I felt like I had just eaten a raspberry eclair. booo! 

I was there with a few of my cousins and nothing they ordered tasted good to me either double booooooooo! What a let down!",5DgFmyjW6hkBtXtTMKl4tA,1,1,2,clpy0Sk7CpoA9qmV8Y0hzg
