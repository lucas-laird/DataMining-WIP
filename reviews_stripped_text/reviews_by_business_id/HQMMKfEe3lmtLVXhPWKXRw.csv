Ono Pork Hash, a good tasting Hot Dog (not just the cheap mystery meat kind), only thing the Teri beef was dry, maybe over cooked? Fresh steamed Manapua is back in Vegas...No more frozen kine from the drugstore. The Gracious Aloha Spirit is alive and well!  Going to miss them at this location. Retro Bleu is staying but Joe's is going to their own place 12/27/2017. Going to have to drive little farther now for Joe's Island Grindz.",KuLSk4xfWAK6YWpDYaUfFw,0,0,5,BGNO4LzIFYK8y-uxhh7XbA
1284128,2017-10-01,0,HQMMKfEe3lmtLVXhPWKXRw,We lived in Hawaii for two years and fell in love with the local food. Managua and pork hash we're always excellent on the island. Love the plate lunches as well.   So when we moved back we looked everywhere and nothing was as good. I found this place today on yelp and immediately went over. The wait was a big long but well worth it. The shoyu chicken is definitely excellent. The pork hash almost makes your toes curl it's so good and the char siu manapua were the bomb. Only things I didn't care for was the Mac salad but that's ok cause we are very satisfied with the food. Thank you so much!  Would have had picks of the other food but was to busy eating to take a picture.,e0v4eYy3R6jPRWio3F6gxQ,1,1,5,1in356Tfo7mlOcd-3OovBQ

Their pork hash is like da kine my Daddy would approve of, large generous portions of steamed ground pork with water chestnut and all the right seasonings in a two-bite bundle. Ask for the hot mustard and shoyu so you have the right dipping sauce. The manapua here is also huge--a hot, steamed bread blossom filled with traditional Chinese style BBQ pork.

On a Friday, I had their Hawaiian plate lunch special with laulau, kalua pork, poke, mac salad and steamed white rice. Oh my, it was enough to feed a family! Plenty leftover for dinner or breakfast. Makes me do a happy hula.

Also, the guys here hustle to get the orders in and out quickly and they are super nice, too.  When I mentioned I wanted the staff at hubby's business to try some, they gave me extra pork hash so everybody could have a taste.  Just so happy to have a place nearby that has ono (delicious) Hawaii home-style food!",WlhETinld_UJHcFp6F8C0Q,7,2,5,NvFvh1H11R0M6wA07QRewQ

Enter Joe's, temporarily operating out of the Retro Bleu space in the CSN Commons through Tuesday. They have a limited menu of island specialties, including pork hash, manapua, and chowfun. But I came for the Spicy Ahi Nachos!

Spicy Ahi Nachos- a huge portion for $12, topped with avocado and spicy tuna garnished with spicy mayo sauce and furikake, all on a crunchy base similar to wonton strips with a salty-sweet flavor to them. They're addictive! But for the sake of knowing their range, I also tried the aforementioned hash and manapua, and both were solid. They're ending service in this location Tuesday but will be premiering service in their own location at the end of the month.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,16,13,4,KutMo1iHkdFCT_R3kj87Ug

We drove all the way here from South West just to try it out, they ran out of everything real quick especially the lau laus on Fridays.

Only gave three stars because the posted price on yelp and other sites for the manapua (which was very good, almost as good a Libby's in Kalihi).  Internet price is $2 but when you go here it's posted at $2.75--that's a .75 cent increase which is very high just for manapua.  Three guys running the place and they were very friendly and open to wala'au with the customers-good feeling.  Don't go by the yelp menu prices because they are so wrong.  I'll be back for the ono manapua sometime down the road but with the price it's a little to high for a constant buy.",fYBwTpuyK5ujW2vZs9OWlQ,2,0,3,WTRjaoDFFsdvsNtZqNHe8g

I've lived in Vegas for over 20 years and I have seen Hawaii restaurants and plate lunch places come and go. I was excited when I found out that this place has pork hash and Manapua. My Dad used to buy it at Char hung sut and Libbys in Hawaii. Needless to say I haven't eaten pork hash in Vegas for nearly 15 years....only the ones in Chinese restaurants...bleh. Anyway, it exceeded my expectations. They were tasty and exploded with flavor. They are new in town, so give them the Aloha support they need!!

It was horrible and i cant believe they actually stayed open and subjected their customers to that heat. I got a dozen manapua which cost me about $35. Nothing special and you could tell it was the frozen kine.,gdNqeHBoOsBt4eKJ-0AJTQ,1,0,2,mQtpWVJnVaTt0pXWhSiD3g

I was craving some saimen but I've had better than the bowl that I had here. I didn't like the noodles that they used and the broth could've had a little more flavor. I ended up adding soy sauce to the broth (I never have to do that). The pork hash is goood, they are huge!

The pork hash dipped in hot mustard mixed with shoyu hit the spot and the manapua had just enough of everything.  The filling/dough ratio was perfect, bread...soft and delicious.  I would love for them to have more varieties of manapuas  in the near future (such as my fav..black sugar manapua!!).

We decided to order a small order to sample. Had a small order chow funn, pork hash and manapua.

Let me tell you EVERYTHING we had was onolicious!!!! My favorite is the pork hash with some hot mustard and shoyu, auwe hit the spot! Plenty meat inside and real juicy and plenty taste. Call ahead to place an order they make it fresh!!!

Manapua was ono as well, filling was very tasty. Hoping they make some baked ones in future.

Chow funn another one hit the spot! Charsiu, veggies and the noodles. All so good.

Local people run this place from Hawaii (hence the name) real friendly and efficient. Will definitely be back again. Maybe a whole pan pork hash for myself next time. Still gotta try the plate lunches!

10.95 2 Choice - small portions....
Mochiko Chicken - the chicken was not crispy at all. Using Mochiko is supposed to give an added texture and more crunch.
