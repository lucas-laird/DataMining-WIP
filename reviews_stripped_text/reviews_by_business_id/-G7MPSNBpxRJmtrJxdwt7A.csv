It took a minute before my brother and I were waited on even then. Though there were only two other tables with guests. We're black they were hispanic, maybe that had something to do with it. But, once the server came and told us she spoke little English and us a little Spanish, service picked up and she began to check on us just as often as the other guests. I Ordered the small breakfast. Which came with fried plantain, a fried egg, sour cream, creamed beans and a tortilla. The beans were very smooth and pureed. They were super flavorful I recommend you get them.  the tortilla was thicker than a traditional tortilla but very tasty as well. My brother had steak tacos. We both enjoyed our food.

729741,2013-06-16,0,-G7MPSNBpxRJmtrJxdwt7A,"The place is THE WORST Salvadorean restaurant I've ever been to. A friend & I went on a Saturday night & they have a guy singing karaoke for entertainment. The music & his singing were UNCOMFORTABLY LOUD. We could barely hear each other. I ordered a liquado with banana & it was DISGUSTING. It tasted nothing like it should taste. I gave the waitress the drink back, told her it didn't taste right, & asked for a coke. She came back with a diet coke. She finally brought me a coke can with no glass. I asked for a glass. She brought me a broken one with a chip on the top. When we received our food all the pupusas were piled on my friend's plate & she placed an empty plate in front of me & walked away. The pupusas were mostly filled with bean & barely any meat. We finished our food in a hurry because the karaoke guy's music was so loud we couldn't have a real conversation. They NEVER asked if we were doing okay or if we needed anything. NO REFILLS on our drinks not even my friend's water. We asked for the bill & we noticed they were charging us for the liquado with banana drink that we returned. I told them I didn't drink it because it tasted wrong & the waitress stated that they made it for me & they make it different than all the other restaurants so I needed to pay for it. I refused to pay & she took it off the bill. We paid & promptly left. There are prices are low because the QUALITY IS BAD. If you enjoy HORRIBLE SERVICE, GROSS FOOD, BROKEN DINNERWARE, POOR STAFF ATTITUDE, HEADACHE INDUCING MUSIC, & A TERRIBLY DISAPPOINTING RESTAURANT EXPERIENCE then this is the place for you.

3786751,2015-03-15,1,-G7MPSNBpxRJmtrJxdwt7A,"Very disappointed. Had previously been here three other times 1st time amazing (busy , waited aproximately 10-15 min but great food completely different people and cook... 2nd time around 1/2 of the previous waitresses where gone and took a little longer even though their was only one other table with people waiting in the entire restaurant.. from this point forward its all gone down hill. This time around it was just a disaster. Looks like all new management and waitresses. I asked our waitress and she said most girls left and that she was new.
There where aproximately 5 tables in the entire restaurant including us with people, so not too slow or supper buissy either.
1st thing bad (we where served Really Hard Chips)
2nd they brought my husband an orchata that tasted burnt.
3rd When placing my order I explained to our waitress that i wanted my egg whites cooked but my yolk still runny/ blanditos/ tiernitos (spanish :) ) I literally said it those three ways for her to understand what I wanted and she gave me the look like she didn't really understand but just nodded. At that point I noticed that she wasn't writing anything down. Being a previous waitress one thing I learned is that you write everything down and if you don't understand something you ask. But i figured she might have photographic memory and will remember everything. 
My husband ordered two sides of cheese....

To top it all off, we had to wait aproximately 45min after all that only to get the following 

2 sides of cream instead of chesse....then when i asked is this for us? she said my husband ordered it...when stepping away i asked my husband he said no and when she returned with my order she said oh im sorry it was cheese you wanted right?? Then placing my plate with one semi burnt egg and one egg that had been leaked and over cooked... even a child could have done a better job. I then proceeded to tell her excuse me ! .... (still trying to be polite ) these eggs are a little too cooked for my liking. She then said ...thats how runny eggs are.. I then told her really, then with my finger i poked both eggs and said nothing is comming out from them so you are telling me these are runny? She then said oh i guess one popped and I said Im sorry im not going to eat that... she said well ill see what i can do.
If you are a new waitresses and some one is telling you something is not right you do not argue especially if they are correct.

5499411,2016-02-19,1,-G7MPSNBpxRJmtrJxdwt7A,"The owner/manager that runs this place gives the worst customer service and acts like she doesn't want your business. I went there to buy pupusas at 9:30 pm. The restaurant closes at 10p. When I ordered my food, I initially ordered 3 pupusas and side of chips to go. I had a friend with me and she wanted to try one, so I told the waitress if one of the pupusas could be served for here because my friend and I wanted to split it. (When she 1st wrote down my order she didn't hesitate to point out that they are about to close and that I have to hurry up with my order- as if It was inconvenient for coming in at that time to spend money in their business). So when I asked her to make one of the pupusas for here, she said we are not serving any food for here, the open sign is now off and we close at 10 and we still have to mop and we leave at 10pm. There was a lady that butted in and started reiterating the same thing the waitress was telling me and I asked for the manager, she replied ""yo soy la manager"". I looked at here and was stunned that a manager would treat customers like that. I said this is the 2nd time I come in here and both times I have been made to feel rushed and almost as if I am being kicked out. She said ""we are not kicking you out"". Anyway, after arguing back and forth for about 2 minutes with this lady, I sat down. I was talking to my friend and I made the decision to ask for a refund and leave. I asked her for my money back and the manager said ""we can't give you your money back"" and I said ""yes you can and you need to give it to me now. "" I don't want to eat here, I will never be coming back. She told me ""you can go ahead and ask the bank for your money back"" and I said ""no, you're going to give my back and that's it."" Finally she told one of the waitresses, ""daselo"". Before she told the waitress to give it to me, I asked her that I wanted to speak to the owner and she replied ""Yo soy la due√±a"". I was even more shocked that this person would treat customers in this manner and make them feel so un welcomed. They gave me my money and I left. I will never be going back to this restaurant. They don't want my business because they want to clock out right 10p, them I'll take my business elsewhere. If you want to leave at 10p on the dot, then close at 9p. You can't start closing an hour before closing and expect customers to know you don't like sit down orders 30 minutes before the restaurant actually closes. I've seen restaurants that allow ppl to finish their meal, even after closing. Plus it was only one damn pupusa that I was gonna share with my friend. We could've definitely eaten that in the 30 minutes left before they closed. I wouldn't even give it one star, but I can't post the reviewing out putting one and I have never taken the time to write reviews for any restaurant I have ever been in, but this was enough for me to actually spend 10 minutes out my time to let everyone know this place has the worst customer service.
