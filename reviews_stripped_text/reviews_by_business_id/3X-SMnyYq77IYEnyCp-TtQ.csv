DO NOT GO HERE IF YOU ARE IN HURRY OR HUNGRY!!!!
Because service is so slow. I guess we went during a shift change because we had one rude waitress take our order which she took totally wrong and was in such a rush to leave that she didn't even let us know that we were going to get a new waitress. We had to wait a good 30 mins for a side salad to come out that I even asked if our order was put in because we wanted to just by for our drinks and go elsewhere that is just how long they took with a salad then at that she only brought one salad when both of us had ordered one. I got the cheeseburger and asked for it medium and it was brought out well done and nasty so I only ate a little bit and ate the bread and butter they took with the salad instead. My husband ordered fries with his dinner and they took him mashed potatoes which he didn't even bother to tell them anything because if he did we would probably still be there today waiting for them . Then we had to wait for the check to get brought to the table. While we were waiting for our food a party of 5 arrived and were sat down and I guess they were never asked what they wanted to drinks or to ordered because they got up and left. Smart move!

Our wait time was less than 5 minutes, the breakfast menu was small but pretty varied, and the food was better than I had expected. The boy ordered the Cinnamon Roll French Toast, which was decadent and delicious (according to him - I don't go for that sweet stuff early in the morning) and I had the basic 2 egg breakfast. Eggs + sausage = ok. Hashbrowns = FANTASTIC, so it all balanced out.

It's decent food, decent portions, decent prices and all just a few steps from the elevator.  I can roll out of bed, hit the cafe and be at the pool in no time.

I'd recommend the cinnamon roll french toast, or maybe the belgian waffle - both are great.  They also make a mean omelet.  

Lines can be long - if you're Platinum of Diamond level of the Total Rewards program you can skip the line - my favorite perk of Total Rewards - but otherwise there is often a little bit of a wait - but the line moves pretty quickly.  

Haven't had lunch or dinner here.  I guess I'm usually up and awake enough by then to venture out into the sunlight and find something a bit more exciting.  But for that early morning breakfast when you're too sluggish to get out and walk the strip, it's a great option.

I've been to the flamingo plenty of times and have passed it each time without noticing it. I wish i could have kept walking this time..

But we couldn't since my hubbys out of town family from texas invited us.

As we walked up the hostess was busy trying to ""unwrinkle"" a 5 dollar bill.

Everyone at the table ordered the steak fajitas but me. There were 8 of us.  I wanted to be different but i should have just stuck with the pack. I ordered the chef's special, which was pasta in basil cream sauce. 

what a mistake! it was a if someone put big rigatoni noodles in afredo sauce and then added a butt load of basil. i ended up just eating the chicken and left everything else. gross! never again will i order that. then 15 minutes after im done my poor tummy started to hurt. greatttttt -_- now i REALLY will have a butt load of basil LMAO.

The workers were unbelivably and undeniably sweet. Though they were of much help in the front, it lacked a bit of work back in the kitchen.

Moment #1 - 5:00am-ish.  We'd been partying at Tryst and were starved after a night of dancing.  We decided to get a bite at the Wynn's all-night cafe.  We sat down and waited.  And waited.  And didn't see anything on the menu we liked.  And waited.  So, we left and decided to take a chance on the Tropical Breeze, located back at our home base, the Flamingo.  Success!  Service was very fast and friendly, and my grilled cheese was divine.  My chocolate milk was not at all chocolatey, but you can't expect miracles all the time.

Moment #2 - About four hours later we're up again, raring to go.  Time for breakfast!  It's always so hard to decide if you want something sweet or savory, so my friends and I ordered eggs and decided to split one order of waffles.  Except....10 minutes after placing our order we realized that we forgot to ask for waffles.  Oh noes!  Panic!  Call over the waiter!  Hurry!  Explain the situation!  He ran to the kitchen!  Our food arrived!  No waffles!  AAAACKK!  He ran back to the kitchen and came out with our waffles!  Sigh of relief....the day was saved.

Moment #3 - 6:00am-ish.  Totally starved after dancing at Body English and playing at Hard Rock's casino.  Seriously, I was sitting at the blackjack table, not even excited when my friend hit 21 because I was too busy fantasizing about a Tropical Breeze grilled cheese.  I could literally taste the buttery crunch of the bread and the yummy melted cheddar.  We leave Hard Rock with our winnings, get to the cafe, and dun-dun-duuuuuun - grilled cheese isn't served at 6:15am!

 Our waiter looked like he was planning on jumping off the top of the Flamingo after his shift. He took 20 minutes to come and take our order and seemed to conveniently forget whenever we asked for a refill or a side of something.

Mind you it was Sunday night. The place was dead, yet the service was still slow. But that could be due to only a small staff working as well. Actually they can't use that excuse because I have been to places where a waiter/waitress handled 4-5 tables efficiently. 


So the bottom line on this place? Think Denny's/I-Hop/Diner. Nothing really special.

The atmosphere also can be considered nothing really special. You walk around and BLAH its right there. 

Plain and simple it's a place to eat if you are hungry and there is nothing else available that you feel compelled to travel to.

I ordered the Prime Rib--yes I know right, a prime rib at this joint. My GF ordered Beef Fajitas.

My prime rib was just ok. It was satisfying, came with fixings like veggies and baked potato. It looked to be a little overcooked on the outside but once I started going at it, it wasn't too bad. 

My GF's Fajita plate was a sizzling affair. However the taste was just average. The quality of the meat were of lower quality cuts. Also only a few tortillas were included when the portion of meat was enough for double the amount of tortillas they gave.

The thing is I don't really  have anything ""BAD"" to say. The service could be better, and the food was just average, but if you look at this place before dining here, IT IS EXACTLY WHAT YOU SHOULD EXPECT.

If you are expecting a lot more, then your judgement on the obvious should be checked. If they couldn't even do ""average"" well, then I would start dropping stars. However, the stars deducted were due to service and value. The price was a little high for the portion. Although portion was good, it was still priced significantly higher than what you would expect based on quality. 

There are soooooooo many better places to eat in Vegas. I'm not saying not to go here, but if you have other options try those first, but if those fall through, expect average from this average place.",Qv0xMxEs9XHEqI_9zb8vcQ,0,0,3,0Yfwmhl37Fq2lHhKiuEv0w

Mongolian Beef:  Too much sauce.  Beef was chewy, but acceptable.

Buddha's Delight:  A lot of vegetables, but again, too saucy.

General Tsao's Chicken:  The best of the bunch, but it was pretty much a fancy way of saying, ""Orange Flavored Chicken.""  Half of the plate was piled with steamed broccoli.  Whatever.  It's good for you.  Overall, anything with fried goodness is usually a winner.  Ha ha ha!  Yin and Yang strike again.

Lo Mein:  Noodles were smoky and tasty.  Standard fare, yet it was the first dish to be finished.  MSG, I presume?

Oxtail Soup:  The broth came out lukewarm.  Bah!  We asked our server for more broth and to have it piping hot and she was able to deliver!  Fortunately, it tasted much like most other beefy soups I've had at authentic Chinese restaurants.

To top it off, our server was fantastic as she kept checking regularly to make sure we were OK and she had a genuinely positive attitude at all times.  Smiles made a big difference.

We were seated for dinner and there was roughly 5 other tables with people seated but the rest was pretty open...so basically not a large crowd that night. It took 10 min to receive waters, and our server never came. We finally saw two servers walking around and they completely ignored us. One looked as us and walked over to the register to chat with whomever while another waitress looked as us and started cleaning down tables. 

We asked the hostess who our server was going to be because no one gave us the time of day. She said she didn't know and that they would be with us shortly. Instead of getting upset, we decided to wait a couple more minutes. Turns out, more servers were in the back talking to each other which I saw from my seat. 

One waitress came by and said ""Ill be with you in a moment"" while she gave the table next to us their food. She then finished serving the table, walked away, and never came back. 

Yup, that was the final straw for us. We got up and left...in the process, my sister spilled her beer all over the table. Well, that gave them something to finally do.",vQQfeaYtC6pW10RirOpR3w,0,0,1,-n9Yx5KfPRsY7DBqsN_AQg

I sorta expected it to be lit up, but it was pitch black outside.  So alas, no tropical birds to take photos of like I'd hoped.

The food was your typical diner fare, but slightly better.  I had a great open faced turkey sandwich... the turkey was moist and thickly cut.  The mashed potatoes were also excellent.  The wait staff was really pleasant.

I didn't really dig the location... to me it was too close to the casino floor to be enjoyable.  It's difficult to eat and carry on a conversation with slot machine noise in the background.

As I am about to sit down, Abraham, the counter busboy/man, waved his hand in front of me signalling me not to sit down. Well, I came to Vegas to drink and party so my squats were a little weak and I ended up sitting down, but was able to quickly get back up, scoot away from the chair and counter, so as to not disturb Abraham while he was in the zone of cleaning the counter. Once he was done, the napkins and flatware were set, he gave us a glance and let us sit down upon which he asked us what we would like to drink and quickly got those out to us while we perused the menu.

Donna our server took our orders, but wasn't really helpful with suggestions. I was debating between the bacon omelet and the bagel and lox. I asked if the omelet was greasy (because the menu said it was loaded with bacon) and her response was, ""I don't know, I don't think so"". I opted for the bagel and lox and was super happy with my choice. The presentation was pretty impressive for a Casino cafe and the lox didn't give me any GI issues. My friends both got omelets and were satisfied with their meals. The food wasn't super impressive, but again, its a Casino cafe so no one was expecting it to be.

The bus person dropped off flatware wrapped in napkins with some kind of black I-don't-know-what smeared on them. Could we have clean napkins? ""Of course!"" was the reply, and the bus person then dropped off three more place settings. This time, two were clean and the third had the same black crap on it. Try again. 

With three clean place settings, we checked out the menu and discovered that only half of the breakfast menu was available 24/7. I couldn't get pancakes like I wanted, so I settled for an omelet. What I got was a large lump of scrambled eggs with bacon and mushrooms, more of a scramble than an omelet. The hash browns were white and undercooked, with black parts in them. Apparently the eyes of the potatoes were not removed before they were grated for hash browns. I ate half the eggs, pushed the gross potatoes around on my plate, and ate the toast, the best part of the meal.

I was seated promptly at the Tropical Breeze cafe, a spacious, unassuming place with booths and tables, typical of many Vegas hotel indoor eateries. What wasn't typical was the food. I ordered the Cobb salad my first night, and was served with the biggest, best salad I've ever seen, big enough to serve 3. Since there was no French dressing, as I'd ordered, the waitress brought me 4 others to try, a truly nice gesture. Additionally, the banana cream pie I ordered came as an artistic arrangement, large, and with 3 puffs of whipped cream and blackberries surrounding the pie; excellent!
I returned the next night, and had the Shrimp and Crab Louie salad; I'm not crazy about crab claws, but the shrimp were huge and tasty, with plenty of them. I also had a banana liqueur drink that was awesomely delicious, all in all a fine meal.
I wasn't that hungry my last night, so I ordered the Yang Chow fried rice, no dessert this time, and it satisfied my craving for Chinese quite nicely (I'd planned on the Mongolian beef, but the fried rice piqued my taste buds upon exploring the menu).

Personally, I don't like patronizing a second time outside my comfort of my home city but my parents are bargain hunters and know nothing of fine dining so I must resort to horrid food on vacation, ironic sort of. 

For dinner, I had the chicken alfredo penne. Everyone ordered pasta since it was a deal that included garlic bread sticks (like Olive Garden) and a plate of Caesar sald. The salad had 0 croutons on every plate! It was definitely dry, but for less than $10, my expectations are not high. The bread sticks did not taste like garlic, but more like salt and seasoning sprinkled on top of some immaturely heated bread sticks. The pasta was definitely lacking taste and moisture. I wish my pasta was fettuccine. The evening server was very considerate and was far different than the afternoon waitress the next day. 

The second time I dined here was for lunch. I couldn't decide what to order since my options were not very extensive. I just went with a Philly Cheesesteak with steak fries. Took forever for the food to come out and when it did, I was given chips. I don't know how that mishap worked it's way though but at least I was given fresh steak fries for compensation.

the fries were really good -too. . . fat and crispy and perfect. 

The side salad was 2.99 and was essentially lettuse, carrot, tomato and cheese, but for the price I have no complaints.",vbDpA74-ukZaZmxJuLnXsg,0,0,3,cuDGoI5Yf1yR9MM279Z0WQ

4753444,2014-01-03,3,3X-SMnyYq77IYEnyCp-TtQ,"Will the bad reviews ever end??? This place was terrible just terrible. It was terrible in every way. Let's break it down shall we. 

Let's start with the service. Apparently if you don't decide what you want fast enough, which means within a minute of you sitting down, that means that you are to be ignored completely as if you never make up your mind. That's what happened. I decided what I wanted and sat and waited. Not even my drink order was taken. There was a lady walking round for Keno and I decided that I would play. I asked her a question which she answered and she said she will be back in a few minutes to pick up my card. I filled out the little card and she never came back around to pick it up. The entire time before that she was coming around literally every minute or so and when I fill out my card and want to play she disappears like a fart in the wind. After all that my server finally decides to grace me with his presence after about 20 minutes and take my order. And while I was it I asked for a drink too, because I forgot to mention I had asked him for a drink the first time he came around and he never brought it so I asked for it again!

Oh the food. I don't what was more abysmal the food or the service? I ordered a Greek omelet that had kalamata olives,spinach, and feta cheese. Typically when I order an omelet I get eggs and whatever ingredients that are in it are mixed into the eggs thus making an omelet. Well I guess here they have different ideas of what an omelet is supposed to be. When my order arrived there was a huge glob of eggs with a ton of spinach mixed in, maybe 3 olives in this huge mess, and huge cubes of feta cheese all over the top of the omelet not mixed inside with the other stuff. I have had an omelet with these same ingredients in the past and that one was great but this one was just plain gross. It was way overcooked and the flavors were not balanced. The toast that came with it was like cardboard. No butter on it at all. the hashbrowns were the only thing was halfway decent so I just ate those. 

Overall obviously a huge disappointment. I have had much better experience in other Vegas cafes in other casinos. This one I would just skip it.",upQW7sPfOfh0brmyq2byEg,1,1,1,dbWe5FjqloN_wF2PGfFH5A

4925959,2008-05-28,0,3X-SMnyYq77IYEnyCp-TtQ,"Holy crap, was the waitress at this place a BITCH!

Had a completely awful experience at this place.  At about 9:45pm I was to the point of fainting, in an effort to minimalize the number of times I ate per day in order to maximize the fun in Vegas.  My companions were equally as weak and lightheaded, so we went for the closest place to eat that would accomodate our various criteria (veggie options, relatively cheap, and had to have roast beef sandwiches-as per one of our party's demands.)

We were seated immediately by 9:50 and given menus.  The waitress took 15 minutes to even make eye contact with our table (and it was NOT busy in this place, she was in the back room.)  When we went around the table and began to order, she informed us that it is now 10:05 and that they were no longer making the food on the menu she had offered us, and that we could only order from one of the three pages we were given.  

WTF!

We complained vociferiously that it was not our fault she was taking a snooze in the back and wasn't on her game, and that they should honour us paying customers who arrived before their cut off time and who were provided with dinner menus-not the late night menus.  No go. We were stuck with appetizers only.

40 minutes later, I had my greasy chicken tenders, 3 carrot sticks and 3 sticks of celery.  They did not bring the sauces (bbq and ranch) described with the item-and when I requested them the waitress looked at me as if I had just told her I wanted her to wash my car with her tongue. So I got treated like I was being the bitch, when really I just didn't want to eat the nasty ass chicken without the fake flavors that were described on the menu.

Overall, my companions were disgusted with their meals as well, especially the nachos.  The only person who seemed pleased with their choice was our friend who ordered a chocolate shake.

Next time, I will just eat somewhere before even going into the Flamingo because this is an experience I do NOT want to repeat!",Qt2ZNrrfYL0eG0MqMEiqVg,1,0,1,MbFQCA__12PyNLbibSgCJQ

4957700,2012-09-30,0,3X-SMnyYq77IYEnyCp-TtQ,"The food here is decent, but it's not great. I ate breakfast here during a recent trip to Vegas. 

We were in a group of seven people, so we had to wait a while for a table. Once we were seated, I took a gander at the menu, and I really didn't see anything that looked good, which is kind of odd for me. I don't consider myself to be a picky eater, but nothing on the menu piqued my interests. I asked the waitress if they could just make me an omelet with American cheese, and she said they could. 

It took a while for our food to come out. A long while. And when the omelet finally did come out, it was just OK. Nothing to write home about. Pretty average. And since this is Vegas, everything is priced high. That omelet, while decent tasting, wasn't worth the cost. There simply are better places to eat breakfast that cost the same and have better food. 

The service was good. Our server was a friendly older woman. She did sort of disappear for a while when we were waiting for our food to come out, but other than that she was good.

The chicken strips we ordered were surprisingly good. Crisp, crunchy, not too oily crust outside. Chicken, nice, tender & juicy inside. Rest of the food wasn't too shabby either. Little bit of a shock considering the other reviews. Maybe we caught them on a good night?

Hey, I do a lot of trade shows in Vegas and would always rather eat here than suffer through the slop the convention center doles out in the food courts. I always try to hit this place up for lunch over the crazy crowds and long lines over at the convention center. I'm usually able to find a spot up at the counter, or grab a small table to go over my notes on while eating.    

It is what it is - typical diner type food which is the normal breakfast, lunch, and dinner offerings. Plain and simple with a few exceptions on the menu. Decent prices consistent with what most casino diners charge. Service to me in all the times I have eaten here has always been pleasant and attentive enough. I'm not that demanding to begin with when it comes to a diner, so I guess I'm easier to please than most.  

Many times for lunch when here I will order a turkey club sandwich - roasted turkey breast, smokehouse bacon, and provolone cheese with beefsteak tomatoes, leaf lettuce on whole wheat. Hold the mayo, use mustard, and get the bacon extra crispy. Along with a side of cole slaw and a big ol' pickle this totally satisfies my hunger until dinner time. Nothing amazing but decent enough.

Reliable and dependable like a pair of old comfortable shoes that gets the job done. The Tropical Breeze Cafe is a casual spot if just looking for some standard diner fare to hold you over until you hit the higher-end restaurants along the Strip for dinner.",YttDgOC9AlM4HcAlDsbB2A,5,3,3,60tV-0byuEEH8FYRJ-HF6w

Don't get me wrong, the staff was really friendly and nice seeming. But they also brought me toast when I asked for biscuits. And kept forgetting to bring my girlfriend the milk she asked for.

When we walked in, the decor was dated and it vaguely smelled of cigarettes and mustiness.

At any rate, the coupon we bought was for Tropical Breezes Restaurant and on a fluke, we just happened to try to the classic cheeseburger.  WAIT, I'm getting a flashback.

This was literally one of the top 2 burgers I have ever had IN MY LIFE.  It had a large patty, the seasoning was plentiful (but not overly so) and it was dripping juice.  It may sounds sorta gross but it was like a burger symphony....umm, maybe that's a little lofty but it was DELICIOUS.  

The only detractor was the $3 CAN of flat Pepsi that no one told doesn't have refills.

Several years ago, this use to be a Korean restaurant and now Roy's Raw Deal now occupies it. I was looking to try a different sushi restaurant instead of my usual, ""Ken's"" on Foothill.

The size is very intimate and the staff were very friendly. Roy always ask if you're allergic to any types of fish and that's very reassuring to know he cares about his customers. It can get busy on the weekends, so it's best to come as early as possible to get a good seat. Patrons are friendly and has the small town feel. 

Sushi was very very fresh! 

Service was excellent!

We were staying in the Flamingo and didn't want something too heavy and close to the elevators, so we decided to eat here, inside the Flamingo. The cafe was just worn out as the rest of the hotel and casino, no frills here! The decor of the Cafe and the rest of the casino was still stuck in the 80's, when they last had their massive renovation.  Our waitress was friendly and seated us right away, our drink orders were taken 15 minutes later and took a while for us to receive our drinks and get our food orders taken and served. 

Other customers were complaining that their food was taking longer than usual and the waitresses were running around, looked unorganized in my opinion. Our food arrived after 40 minutes and was on par with Denny's breakfast, with inflated prices. 

Of course, all the restaurants and cafes inside the strip hotels are tourist traps! What can you do when you're hungry and don't feel like walking a few blocks for something cheaper.
