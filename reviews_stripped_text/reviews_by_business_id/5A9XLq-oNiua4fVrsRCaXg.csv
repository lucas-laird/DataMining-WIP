I had to go back and ask for more. All the workers had attitude. Never coming back here again",eItsj8sG3zrdOnQw9W5rDw,0,0,1,DEhDVmn9OlGxJXgUQTgYcw

The cashier was ringing them up, a 2nd cashier opened and rang up the person behind us, then would have rang up the next person behind me if I had not brought up that I wasn't with the people in front of me. They had assumed that we were with the family up front. We also ordered a passion fruit ""fruit tea"". We were told that there would be a 3 minute wait. I said ok as we were going to eat in the food court while waiting anyway. We had already finished eating when I checked to see what had happened to my drink. They never started making it, so I had to wait again after waiting an initial amount of time.",3pOT6kBzbnzY2knY9HS1wQ,0,0,1,Sa1-jIVtRXfHSBvFJVZX5g

Have to recommend this place for everyone that is visiting the U.S. If you are looking for a quick bite and happen to be at a mall - look for this place. It's one the best Chinese food I've eaten. Everything is made crispy with a thin layer of sauce. I recommend the Beijing chicken - its my fav. But everything on their menu is pretty good. Even the side orders of fried rice and noodles. I know you guys opened a lot of stores in America but keep them coming! Maybe come north to Canada too?,HAM8B6kiAmhTFXzsE_HfSQ,1,0,5,m8BH3Ejt7iIhDOXARYepsw

Always out of a lot of menu options and half the time the service stinks but the other half they are nice. I spoke with manager and it's evident where the problem lies. She is not at all friendly and just stares at you. I feel bad for the employees. She is quite the bad apple!,XjlbI_pLnGoHqcJtz7-bPA,0,0,2,SGTSCmD6AutFIrEcJcx6XQ
