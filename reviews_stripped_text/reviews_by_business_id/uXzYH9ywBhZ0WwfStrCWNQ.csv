742614,2016-09-11,0,uXzYH9ywBhZ0WwfStrCWNQ,First off when we walked in there was no one else in there on a Sunday afternoon should've tipped me off..my son and I were not that hungry so I ordered two kids size sandwiches and I understand I ordered different than what was on the kids menu but why would I pay $16 for two .. It would've been cheaper to order one sandwich and split it!! Also the employees could've informed me as well before making the sandwiches and when I asked how much those two were together they couldn't give me a price... Size the fact of her three employees and their standing around and no other customers the bread was to our vinegar made it real soggy real quick I've never had that problem at any other sub shop,mYgoa8sxSBJpcmC3BLytmw,0,0,2,HQhpIBlRuaZ2N_yD5Dtsig

What this Jersey Mike's franchise did was exactly what I knew Jersey Mike's to be.  The bread could not have been fresher, the build was perfect and the staff, especially the manager who served us and constructed our Jersey shore delicacy was exceptionally friendy and professional.  If you're from the Jersey shore, don't hesitate to call this location home... we certainly didn't.  And yes, #11 still reigns.",JlCGKDkEiNyDfYqrU7GFVg,0,0,5,-579zSvHiIvDIqz8cbixAA

1827644,2017-07-09,0,uXzYH9ywBhZ0WwfStrCWNQ,"I rarely follow up a post with another one for a positive review, but this JM location may be the best one in Vegas, hands down. Anyone who's lived other places knows immediately that LV, considering it's a town based on hospitality/service(at least for tourists) ironically has the most unprofessional, apathetic and mistake-prone food service I've ever seen. Anywhere. Almost every other time I eat out or pick up food somewhere they screw it up and I end up getting a free redo(which I'm not complaining about, but that just ends up driving up prices for everyone else ultimately). 

After a small mistake almost a year ago, they have been spot on A+ whenever I order food. Alex is an incredible manager who I feel now pays special attention to my orders because I usually order through the app and even if it says 25 minutes he has it ready in 5 -10, I live very close by and never have to wait a second. The food is fresh, tasty, and very customizable through the pretty intuitive app. Are there better sandwich places? Probably. But they can be expensive with inconsistent food quality and I've had to boycott more than a few for piss-poor customer service. So by showing good management skills and attention to detail, Alex has not only retained but increased my patronage when I want a sub. If only other places in LV could figure out this simple concept. Thanks Alex! I appreciate it. JM rocks, def one of my faves. Check out this location you will not regret it ever.",_kQkkZUKOmJBD6t0CA-eHQ,0,0,5,EYhssDgxEP9VTV6wX7D1OQ

Everyone raved about the fresh, great-tasting sandwiches.  Also, he was generous in providing us with coupons for future visits, which I will be sure to use.

They always do a really good job making sure everything is up to their standard. My only issue is that there is one guy there who tries to work quickly but he only ends up working sloppily. Taking the extra 2 seconds to do your job won't kill anyone but it'll stop you from getting mayo on EVERYTHING.,7BPNf4ZDn-WJ4tvDI4gFBA,0,0,5,mZ08nSU3ELJZEd2rSu0kkQ

And its not just this location either, every one I've eaten at is divine. I love, love, love the bread. Crispy on the outside and a nice loose crumb on the inside with a nice chewy texture. I tell you what, you can have the best ingredients in the world for the insides and ruin it with crappy bread but these guys have it right. A good sandwich starts with the bread! Period! The only slightly annoying thing is with JM, if you pay by card, you're presented with the guilt tip option on the card swipe device. Not that I'm against tipping, tip all you want but I don't believe it should be forced or asked for.",CwzhFRwIkYFGkaggG0sTlA,0,0,5,gQRzm1eciv8WY8b_siXlKQ

4062312,2018-04-03,0,uXzYH9ywBhZ0WwfStrCWNQ,"Meh. It's like something that will do the job in a pinch. I do like that they slice the meat when you're ordering, but wouldn't mind more cheese offerings, like cheddar or jack. And I'm not a big fan of their bread... it's sorta heavy and almost flavorless, so it's nice that they now have a rosemary-parmesan option.
And i understand the quality of the sandwich build is random, but i want everyone to care about every single bite.

This was going to be a 3 star review, but they get a bonus for having pretty good cheesesteaks.",P1inNb4W6_M_fFY5M2s_fA,0,0,4,6hUdMfzaVCuDq_J5Yy_ECA
4170650,2016-03-11,4,uXzYH9ywBhZ0WwfStrCWNQ,"As a general rule, I'm not a fan of subs. I'm more of a hot meal person. But I decided to give the new Jersey Mike's a try since it was on my way to work and I had a coupon for a free sub. Free food always tastes better than paid for food.

I was pleasantly surprised upon entering this fine establishment. It was clean, uncrowded and the staff was alert and friendly; not like the listless nubes they have at Subway, staring into space wondering where they went wrong in life and mentally planning your demise. Jersey Mikes hires future CEOs. The kind of people that will take over major corporations while briefly reflecting on a simpler time spent making sandwiches for assholes like me.

I ordered the Supreme Club, which is basically a club sandwich plus roast beef. They have a production line setup and my sub was made within 30 seconds. I got it ""Mike's Way"" which means they put lettuce, tomato, onions and a special vinaigrette with herbs on it. (Mine was no onions, add pickles). I exchanged my coupon for the sub and my happy ass was out the door. I got to work, threw my lunch in the fridge and went about my business.

I retrieved my east coast sub 2 hours later and was disappointed to discover that the bottom bun was mostly mush, due to grease seepage. Bummer. It did not, however, affect the taste. The sub was still delicious. Best cold meal I've had in awhile. I recommend eating right away if you opt for the special vinaigrette.

Kudos Jersey Mike's. I will be back with my coupons. And my opinions.",wFL2RrJvTsOVRU6gnRd2WQ,1,0,4,ymDWr4HQu7yJOg3dJA3zww
