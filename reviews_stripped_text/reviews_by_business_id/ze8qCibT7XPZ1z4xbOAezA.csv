595646,2015-11-10,0,ze8qCibT7XPZ1z4xbOAezA,Came here a few days ago with a few friends bc we were craving for chicken fries. Saw the drive through light still on so we assumed it still open. Rolled up and was asking nicely to order. And the girl that was closing just turned the light off for the answer without even saying anything. Like you could've atleast said sorry we are closed but guess not. Thought that was really rude. Not gonna back come here again just cos of the poor customer service.,wIrNAd6D8y8WFCAWfJl23Q,0,0,1,B2HAl6aEv4tAfO_YQfrydA

I came by here yesterday to order my husband a vanilla iced coffee. I am not really much of a coffee person so I did not try any but my husband liked it. Service was just average.
But what is really great about this particular Burger King is that they offer free wifi (not password protected), which was actually pretty fast. So I just poached off of their wifi while my husband and I sat for a few minutes to relax our feet and check our emails and such (I really wished there would be more places on the Vegas Strip that offered wifi for free). 

Overall, average experience, thus the 3 star rating. 

By the way, this Burger King food court area (there are 2 food courts in the South Premium Outlet) is located right in front of the customer service booth. If you have triple A, make sure to stop by to pick up a discount card that you can use for the majority of the stores in the outlet mall for additional savings.",3UIa8YVjETNwJwnOl4SEdg,0,0,3,YwI3IxHC950Bzi11OuKJqw
2861491,2011-12-04,2,ze8qCibT7XPZ1z4xbOAezA,"Wow,  I'm really surprised that this location has yet to be Yelped.  This particular BK Lounge is located inside Las Vegas Premium South Outlets (better known as the Belz Outlet to those who've lived in Vegas for awhile).  There isn't much to be said about Burger King.  We are all familiar with its' offerings and prices.  I don't really venture to Burger King for killer food, its more of a convenience factor.  Anyhow. . . A- Okay on this BK. 

Pros:
  *  They have the Whopper on the Breakfast menu. I thought there was breakfast whopper, but no.  Just the regular whopper on the breakfast menu.  Strange, but cool!
  *  open a little earlier than the mall.  If you find yourself needing to be one of the first consumers at a store in this mall, you can come here to grub prior to getting your shop on.
  *  I got a 10% discount.  I've been here enough (sad but true).

Cons:
  *  No Drive Thru window (obviously ... it's in the mall)
  *  Super loud in the food court especially during lunch hours.  Don't expect to be able to talk to the rest of your party without having to yell across the unbalanced table.
  
Overall:
  Again, this is Burger King.  If you don't know, now you know.

Tips:
  *  You can request your favorite music video while you eat in the food court ( regular texting fees apply)
  *  If you are going to eat there with someone and you want to converse while eating, avoid sitting under the flat screens that are suspended 12 ft. in the air blasting music videos.
  *  Bring cash.  Yes they take plastic, but there have been numerous times that their credit card machine goes on strike.  I speak from experience.",G1O-KAFicH00OW14aPfw3g,2,2,3,1zs-IcSC3H6XajcImX2TQA

Hard, room temperature, chicken fries. Much to my dismay, my stomach continued to growl due to lack of food, as I couldn't eat them. I don't think I'll be returning to this location. Maybe the king is somewhere else.....",2LaXC_AW4I0EBU9FhzpOgg,1,0,2,tQ1qpPbdWHcIAqmouG1F_w

The place isn't bad, but it's hard to find good court locations that can compare to standalone restaurants. If you're at the outlets, then it'll work, but there's a full-size Burger King just up the road that's grand, as well.",umpKz5SA6UPEs0_bsuFKfA,0,0,3,4jYirUjCkkQuPFHGFhl34g

There are not any food options at the two different food courts at this outlet mall.  This Burger King is the best option when it comes to having a meal here.  It is not one of the best Burger King locations that I have been to.  The menu is the same as the other BK's.

When you come to this outlet, try to make sure that you eat something first.  If you're really hungry, then this is your best bet.",whINg-cC-FiAv_ATDGMDTg,0,0,2,Dbnlk7yMbECoZmJCnE2EhQ
