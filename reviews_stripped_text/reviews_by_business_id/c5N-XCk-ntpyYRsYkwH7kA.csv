That's not the case here. It's sparkling clean, they have a nice wide open floor plan, and quite the comfortable atmosphere. 

The servers and bartenders are friendly and welcoming. They appear to be genuinely interested in building rapport with customers. 

The food was great. The burger was juicy, thick, and flavorful. They cooked the peppers until they were tender, not mushy or soggy. 

We indulged in the old fashioned cocktails which had a little kick. I can appreciate the fact that the bartender didn't rip us off with weak drinks. 

The fried pickles were served sizzling hot, crispy and spicy. They're pickle chips rather than spears which makes the perfect fried pickle. It's not too wet and doesn't stay scorching hot for too long. 

I'll definitely make regular visits here. They offer entertainment on Friday nights. It's near UNLV, so expect a younger, rowdier crowd to blow in around the evening hours.",INHFOcLzPBFAEO9QHbQ6Pw,1,0,5,RZQmCJniND8fCUzaA8dpKg
726518,2017-03-06,1,c5N-XCk-ntpyYRsYkwH7kA,"Probably the worst service I've had in my life. The bar is nice and food looked great. However, I feel as though the bartender had either a very bad day or something very tragic happened in her life. From the start she uttered rude remarks to my friends and I, such as ""Of course you are on different tabs."" We felt slightly uncomfortable, nonetheless I continued to be polite. However, I feel she crossed the line when she told me that I ordered incorrectly off the happy hour menu (which is the only menu I had in my hand while ordering) and that I needed to mention to her that it was happy hour for her to honor it. She followed that by telling my friends and myself that we are rude and have been rude since we walked in, even though I was only in the bar for 10 minutes and had only a single interaction with her. I was utterly shocked, thinking she possibly confused me for another guest somehow. I can honestly say that she treated me like she had a personal vendetta against me. I hope that she was just having a very bad day and that this type of behavior is an outlier from her normal actions. 
I work in the service industry at a very high volume venue in Vegas and have never seen this kind of service from anyone on my staff. I felt so uncomfortable that I had to leave immediately after hearing all the remarks she was making. I will never be coming back to this bar again because of the woman who bartends on Sunday at 5pm. 

On a side note, the male bartender was very polite.",ve56ZXvmMkdkeYeRBvzLng,2,0,1,H5ISII08M17vfBgCJBm6bA

Only disappointment is that we were given the happy hour menu and discussed it with our waitress and never were we told that happy hour ended an hour earlier. Not in writing or verbally. So when our bill came we asked about the prices and we were then told happy hour was over. Immediately the waitress realized the mistake and took it to her manager without us saying anything. A few minutes later the manager comes over and quickly says that all he can do is give us the ""industry discount"". Ended up being $6 off our total bill which was not even half of what it would have been if we got the happy hour deal. He spoke so fast and admitted they were wrong for not having it printed on the menu then walked away immediately without even giving us the chance to discuss.

We went during the last half of happy hour and the food was pretty great. Props to the cook. We had chicken fingers, wings, and zucchini fries. Everything was delicious! Easily one of the juiciest and crunchiest chicken fingers I've had, but I don't think we'd ever go back solely because of the crappy service. 

There was only one barista working, so I can understand her feeling overwhelmed or aggitated (even though there was roughly only 5 other customers aside from us). She was rude and I'm not sure she knows how to work in hospitality. We also ordered some chicken fingers to-go and when she served us the order on the plate, I had to remind her I asked for it to-go. To which her response was, ""No you didn't say that."" After a few moments of awkward stares in silence, my boyfriend had to just come out and ask for a take-out container. She should be fired, honestly, seeing as others have had the same crappy service from probably the same female server.

Burgers are the specialty, and as my favorite server Crystal put it, you really can't go wrong with any of them.

We ordered based on the recommendations we read on here. We got the 2 am tots, zucchini fries, deviled eggs and the chicken wings. I guess we had too high of expectations because the food is simply just okay. It's bland and really doesn't have much of a flavor. I will say this, the 2 am Tots we're good. I'd maybe order 2 since they are on the smaller portion side. The deviled eggs had a good presentation but the taste was just not there. Imagine a taste like a deviled egg platter from Albertsons and just add  pieces of bacon to it. Still trying to find a good wing spot, these just didn't cut it. The sauce they put on them has an over powering ginger taste. I found myself having to wipe some of the sauce off because it was giving me a weird after taste. The zucchini fries were a bit on the soggy side, they could've been cooked a little longer. The wasabi ranch sauce doesn't help them one bit, we dipped the zucchini in it and never touched it again. 

Now the bartender was also our server. She was fantastic. Girl was the only one there and managed to take care of the entire establishment alone. She was definitely on her A game!!!

The door was locked so we had to press the door bell. The bartender came and opened the door for us and checked our ID because only 21+ year olds are allowed in there. 

We took a seat at one of the tables unsure if we were allowed to because many bars only let you sit at the bar after a certain time but the bartender was also our waiter and was very attentive. He quickly grabbed us our water and took our order when we were ready. 

We order their amazing Bangin' Wings to share, a whole pound of wings. They only have one signature sauce and it really is delicious. It is a little BBQ-y and just a perfect little hint of spicy. They also give you a homemade dipping sauce which is a lot lighter than ranch or bleu cheese but still good.

I ordered the BBQ Burger. It had this wonderful blueberry BBQ sauce on it. I loved it. It also had amazing white cheddar cheese melted on it and thick meaty bacon but still crispy. I didn't read the menu thoroughly and didn't catch that there would be pulled pork on this burger as well but I ate many bites without noticing and it was so good but once I pulled it off it was even better because I love beef way more than I do pork. The buns were toasted and buttered perfectly. I got the fresh fruit for my side instead of fries and they gave me fresh, juicy strawberries and blueberries! Yum! 

Boyfriend ordered their Degenerate (Hangover) Burger. It was super savory. It had all the toppings that make that perfect ""hangover burger"" - like an egg, bacon, onion strings etc. it was SO GOOD. He stuck with the fries for his side and they were perfectly crispy and salted. They also make a homemade ketchup that kind of tastes like sriracha and ketchup mixed together... it was interesting.

Overall, we loved the food here. Everything was amazing and the inside of the place is so spacious and modern. It was also quiet and very peaceful. It looks like all the furniture is new and the whole place is super clean. You're allowed to smoke in here but it doesn't at all smell like smoke, it is very well ventilated. The waiter was nice (he even lit my boyfriend's cigarette for him!) he always made sure we had everything we needed. The food came out quickly and was warm!

Every time I've been to Bar Code there's either been an issue with the beer (Kirin had some serious flaws) or they were out of beer. Last night when we went they were out of Kirin, Stella, Elysian Space Dust, and one other draft beer. The staff was very friendly and apologetic, but if you're going to carry that much draft beer, it'd be nice to actually be able to drink it.

But.. their food saves them. The menu is definitely mostly burgers, which I wasn't really in the mood for. They have a breakfast menu served all night so I ordered a Breakfast TABLE sandwich, which is a BLT with avocado and a fried egg. I wouldn't order this for breakfast necessarily but it was friggin awesome. Like why have I not had a BLT with a fried egg before? The bread soft but sturdy, the lettuce was springy and fresh and the sandwich itself was huge. The fries were decent, I don't really like hand cut fries. I wish they could serve tater tots as a substitute for fries but the server informed us that they portion the tots out for the 2am tots appetizer which.. doesn't really make sense to me. I had a bite of my boyfriends BBQ burger and it was great, though not really my style. Somehow they stack BBQ pork and bacon onto this burger. It's a monster, but very good. The last time I was here it was happy hour and we ordered a few of the appetizers. I remember liking the fried pickles and tots. Really good happy hour deals. 

The bar is rather large, with 3-4 different seating areas besides the bar. They also have a patio, though it faces right onto busy Flamingo Road. It was a good spot to catch a Golden Knights game, play shuffleboard and hit the jukebox. There's a stage in the corner and I think they have karaoke or comedy nights or something, though I haven't checked that out. If you're looking for a burger and want to watch a sports game or gamble in a less smoky dark bar this is a good pick.",rYPjqZO89ABei1fsZBSUbA,0,0,4,m6pOboDS8vy_XoyUS_XpuQ

Gastropubs often straddle the line of restaurant and pub. Here you have your typical wines, beer, and liquor... and then you also have your bar food, but with a tad more quality and served with a sprinkle of fancy, if you will. 

My friends and I stopped in on a weekday, catching happy hour. (Every day: 3p-6p, then 11p-2a) I was pleasantly surprised at how clean the bar was, open layout, with shuffleboard, pool, darts, etc. If you look closely, you can muster out the memories of the evolution of this bar: Murphy's Law and Barefoot Bob's Beachbar. My only gripe is that your clothes will smell like you fell into an ashtray afterwards. 

Service was good. Our waitress was patient and kept checking in on us. I tried the BANGIN' WINGS (bbq wings with bleu cheese)  and the PICKLE SCHNITZELS (deep fried pickle slices). Both were appetizing and great to munch on in between sips. My Jameson and ginger ale was only $4 for HH. Their appetizers are also half off during this time. 

So yeah, this bar was pretty chill. The clientele was a mixture. Despite its proximity to the university, it wasn't quite college central like you'd find at Stake Out, and although the food exudes the vibe of Park on Fremont and amenities like Gold Spike, it's not quite downtown hipster either.

The waitress didn't acknowledge us for a several minutes so we went and sat down at one of the four high tables they have towards the middle. She came to the other tables around us twice and didn't say anything to us. So we got up and went to the bar.

Again sitting there we didn't get asked if we wanted drinks or food. The entire visit was about 20 minutes before we decided to leave and head to the Crown. Where, may I add, we were greeted immediately.

I went with a group of six for lunch (1pm) with only 4 other customers in the restaurant and still seemed to get the bare minimum of service. There was only one female bartender working the bar and the restaurant. It took some time for us to get waters, iced teas and half the menus provided were happy hour menus that weren't valid for 3 more hours. 4 out of the 6  burgers were correct however completely cold along with the fries, the ""vinaigrette"" for the salad is red wine vinegar only, and the burger ordered with a veggie patty came as a turkey patty so that burger had to be completely remade. Taste wise the fries were good but would have potentially been amazing if they weren't cold. Those who ordered turkey burgers from our group said the taste was really good and was a large patty however would have been better not cold. I don't eat meat so i love that they have a veggie burger that also looked to be made in house which is even better but the lack of service is worth it for me. Also to get our bill i had to go to the bar and wait till i could wave her down. 

My final complaint is that during our visit, next to us were two ""models"" being entertained by two men who we later realized we're going to be photographed for the restaurants promos. One of the gentlemen is i'm assuming an owner or manager because he's in half the instagram photos and we still managed to receive poor service with them just 2 tables away.",AeGPePY0FG7_Mu0CHck3GA,3,0,3,QWA50tIPM-c44YIk_yHgXQ

I'm not sure, but I think they use a blend of different cuts of meat and I think even a little pork.  The flavor of the meat is just too good to be regular hamburger alone.  Even the chicken fingers are worth getting every time you go.  There is nothing frozen about anything we have ordered there.  The one thing I can say negative is that it does tend to take a little longer to get our food than other places, but I can honestly say that it is well worth the wait because we know that it will be great.  If it takes a couple of minutes longer to make a great burger, then I am all for it!  I know the place doesn't look like much on the outside, but they have done a great job of decorating and making it look and feel like a great place to hang out on the inside.  It is extremely clean on the inside....I am really picky about that.  Everyone I I take there is pleasantly surprised, when they walk through the door. They have a pool table, shuffleboard, TV's to watch the game, and I believe video slots at the bar (I don't gamble, so I can't say I know for 100% sure).

What the heck took me so long to give Bar Code Burger Bar a try?  The bar is clean, the service is excellent, and their burgers are phenomenal.  Their burgers are all house made.  Each patty is a combination of ground chuck, short rib, and brisket.  If you love meat, then you'll love Bar Code Burger.  Their burger is huge, juicy, and packed with a ton of flavor.  I tried their Hangover Burger (cheese, egg, onion strings, and bacon) and the BBQ Big Burger (blueberry BBQ sauce, smoked Boston butt, cheddar, and bacon).  Both were delicious.  And here's the other good news, their burgers won't cost an arm and a leg.  A burger with fries cost around $11.  Want an even better deal?  Their food is 50% off for locals on Monday's. Bar Code has 8 different burgers, including a lamb and turkey burger, 2 types of dawgs, 3 chicken sandwiches, wings, and even a few breakfast dishes.  But if you ask me, it's all about their Hangover Burger. 

Bar Code Burger Bar is spacious, has a ton of flat screens, about 10 video poker machines, a pool table, and a shuffle board. Keep in mind that Bar Code is a bar and smoking is allowed.  Bar Code is ventilated well and I didn't even smell the smoke from the 3 smokers at the bar.  

The overall service at Bar Code is top-notch.  I could tell that our server wasn't just passionate about her customers, she was also passionate about their food.  She almost guaranteed that we would be very satisfied with their burgers.  And you know what?  I was extremely satisfied.",y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQ,16,11,4,qpgU6m4BMjMUiJ2Q7qQEWA
4085948,2016-08-31,3,c5N-XCk-ntpyYRsYkwH7kA,"Murphy's Law. Barefoot Bob's Beach Bar. Now, Bar Code. 

Bar Code has gone the Gastropub route. With all Gastropub joints, they have this vague speakeasy/vintage type of feel with usually decent bar food but at gourmet burger prices. This is one of those places but was pleasantly surprised by the burger quality and the drink prices. 

The draft list did have some great choices. I was taking advantage of the Apocalypse IPA by 10 Barrel Brewing, which comes in around 7% ABV. A glass was $5. I thought that was a joke. It was so cheap that I had to get another one later. You know, twisting my arm here.

The menu looks like something that failed to get into The New Yorker. The Bar Code Burger description especially made me laugh. The two most hilarious items were: ""proprietary short rib"" which I had no idea what that meant and ""newcastle onion jam"" which I figured it could also be classified as Liverpool onion jam as I also had no idea what that meant. 

Great thing is that this all translates in the language of taste. It was a delicious burger. I don't know if it was the foreign jam, the bacon mayonnaise, or this copyrighted short rib(TM) but the flavors worked together. The burger was moist and flavorful and the bun, the foundation of any good burger, didn't get soggy or gross. They didn't even ask us how we wanted the burger cooked, but there's probably only one way to cook Bar Code's Proprietary Short Rib (TM) all rights reserved.

What they can keep is the Bryan's Tot Bombs. The description only says, ""a labor of love, smoked tomato mayo."" What you get for $8 is 12 tater tots whose insides are more like mashed potato consistency. 12 of those. There were four of us. That menu item needs an actual description. 

I want to love this place. I loved the previous places in their weird unique ways. One thing that concerns me is that it feels like just a place. Murphy's Law was... a place. That was both a Steelers bar and a Cardinals bar. Barefoot Bob's was supposed to be Beach themed, but it was Murphy's Law without the Steelers and Cardinals banners. This feels like Murphy's Law but with food served on fake newspapers and some garnish sprinkled on top.

In the meanwhile, I'll keep drinking these $5 craft draft beers and keep a positive mind.",y1b_9KmwNUWG1AS3CazFLA,5,2,4,wPjyK2F1UjJ8y3AQnzl_iA

So that was interesting. 

The second time was during a VGK game.

4238515,2018-06-05,1,c5N-XCk-ntpyYRsYkwH7kA,"I've dropped into Bar Code many times before but never actually hung out there.  I would go to support my secret boo Tino's weekly comedy show that he hosted there. (In my head he was my boo, but don't tell him).  I would go to support the local comedians, maybe chit chat for 20mins or so and go home. Well in the past 3 days, I've been back twice since Saturday night.  I've been sleeping on this spot, literally up the street from me, this is you ULTIMATE local hang out spot.  

Bar Code is located on on Flamingo (nw), in between Tamarus and Spencer. sits facing the street.  At times some may perceive 'local' as some little dim-lighted hole in the wall, a place that is filled with smokey, sticky floor and old mismatched stools .  This is not that kind of place, well-lighted, in the day time natural light is giving light to the bar, so the house light are low.  At night, lights are up; not too dark not too light.  Outdoor seating is available and TV mania, on every wall, above the bar, in the little corner areas of the bar.  It doesn't matter where you sit/stand you will see whatever sport that is showing that day.  Very clean establishment, facilities clean and even though smoking is allowed, the ventilation is so great you can't even tell. Which is very important to me, especially when I'm going to eat there...epic side eye.  Dare I say 'Cheers for the 21st centry', huh, huh?  C'mon, manager was on the floor the entire time.  Here's the thing, I didn't even realized he was the manager until he introduced himself.  Once the game started it got busy, Brent help with orders, making drinks, cleaning tables, moving chairs around.  He never sat down, when he wasn't cleaning or serving he was mingling and interacting with customer.  Hence he stopped by our table to ask about our experience thus far and how did we like it.  (That's very Sam Malone-ish) The way the entire crew worked was like an orchestra, if the Knights played like the service that was happening in the bar WE would be up 2 instead of down 2 and coming home in a must win situation. (that's neither here NOR there).  

Got there around 430p, HAPPY HOUR is from 3p - 6p.  Awesome menu, great selections, prices range from $3.95 - $10.95, very reasonable.  As soon as sat down, I was greeted, id requested and order taken all in the 1st 5mins of me sitting down.  Talk about customer service YES PLEASE, and Thank you!  Yelp America let me introduce you to our bartender/server was LAUREN! (she freaking ROCKS), so on point with the service, excellent customer service.  The bar got busier as the game went on and yet she worked the hell out of her area.  We were all help in a timely matter, there was never a time that I was looking around to order anything,  Before I could Lauren was already there or had already checked on us.  We didn't have to worry about empty glasses, water always filled. Very cool laid back type personality, super cool vibes, very chill individual.  Y'all go check Lauren out, she is there everyday at 4p.

This is a local bar that is giving out lots of local love.  If you are in the area go check it out, go visit Lauren and Brent


We order the fried pickles, deviled eggs and bangin' wings:
5STARS - fried pickle: well seasoned crunchy outside, firm crunchy pickle inside.  So damn good, I forgot there was a sauce, you don't even need the sauce, they are fine alone.  But the sauce, eh y'all that sauce tho...it's a  creamy Sriracha ranch, I'm just saying, I almost took my finger an ran it out the inside of that cup.  Together it's a nice little explosion.

1STAR - deviled eggs: the presentation was nice, but I was really feeling it.  For me personally it was way heavy with Worcestershire sauce, it over powered my palate, that was the only thing that I could taste.  And, they a were runny...I'm sorry...and this is why you try to make happy hour, therefore you can try something at a fraction of cost, it's 50/50.  This was not to my liking, this is just my opinion, go try them out for yourself and make your own call on them.

5STARS -  bangin' wing: fried wing, no flour, no batter, tossed in a in-house bbq sauce.  The bbq sauce is reminiscent of Carolina style but has a little more sugar than a vinegar based bbq sauce would have.  Has a kick to it, the heat kind out sneaks up on you.  Even tossed in sauce, the skin was still crispy an chicken super moist.  I'm a not a blue cheese person, so I went ahead and had ranch on the side, like the true fat @$$ that I am.

We tried 2 of the burgers. The Americana Burger & The BBQ Big Burger. Both were excellent. Both were served with house made fries and Siracha ketchup. The Americana is pickles, onion strings, mustard, & ketchup with American cheese. The BBQ is Boston Butt, cheddar, & blueberry BBQ sauce.

I, also, had the Jade Budda cocktail which was a kiwi/lime concoction. It was super light, refreshing. A perfect summer cocktail. Kudos to Anna for dreaming it up and sharing it with the world!!

The best part of this dining experience, aside from the fantastic burgers, was the stellar service. We never waited long for anything and both people that helped us just seemed happy to be there...Which made us happy to be there.

Despite the cloud of smoke you have to go through to get here... It's worth checking out. I could see this being our new burger place.",4guhHcnzrximsz-DeEvskg,2,3,4,wJXuYums3saiS2TW5U-euQ

Very clean and open space.Outdoor patio as well.  The menu is awesome! Try the wings ( ask for extra crispy) and the burgers are a must!  There is calamari, zucchini fries, and other yum bar fair with a notch up.  Drinks are all yummy. The kiwi thing is super bomb ( forgot name) ;)   Plenty of diverse beers on tap and service is on task. There is a pool table, darts, shuffle board and karaoke (check for nights/hours). Jukebox available and buzztime trivia, multiple tvs and gaming.( and for those that still find this odd in Vegas - yes, its a smoking establishment) No possible way you can be bored while hanging out here. I gotta admit I have one complaint tho- the blue cheese dressing is horrendous. I know not that many people choose it over ranch but I do and seriously- don't do it man! I tipped the cook ten bucks last visit just to beg his boss to change it up.   ---- Yep other than that though, order ranch and have a kick ass time here.

Ordered my first beer from the bartender she was super fast and personable.  We ended up placing 3 banks of tables together in the back since our group was 16.   We looked over the menu, conversed and caught up on old times.

The bartender came over and was our now our server.  I ordered a half order of the zucchini bikini fries and the Green Chile Cheeseburger with fries.  The waitress informed the group there is only 1 cook tonight so to be please patient.  I have no problem with that a appreciate the honesty instead of waiting and wondering if they forgot my order. 

The ZUCCHINI BIKINI FRIES :  extremely tasty, the tempura batter was so light and it was cooked to perfection I loved 

The GREEN CHILE CHEESEBURGER: Super juicy and flavorful with just the right amount of luck a very hearty burger indeed.  The fries were amazing as well with the siracha ketchup.  

I did try the SQUID VICIOUS as well again extremely light batter and cooked perfectly.

The quality of the food is above and beyond what you'ld expect in a bar atmosphere and that is a great thing!  Will be coming back perhaps next time to play shuffleboard, darts or to shoot some pool.

The display was decent but the burgers were amazing, I've never had a better burger, I ordered the Big BBQ Burger medium rare and it was amazing, I also had a bite of the Barcode Burger and it was even better!

Far from your basic neighborhood bar food, Bar Code delivers on the classics but with a twist, sticking with the basics and executing well!

Venturing in during happy hour, the order turned appetizer heavy to capitalize. Great value daily from 3-6pm & 11pm-2am, along with drink deals as well.

I've tried quite a few burgers here, and on this visit, the ""Hangover Burger"" ($11.95) : Bacon, Fried Egg, American Cheese, Fried Onion, Code Sauce & Fresh Kennebec Fries. Excellent breakfast style burger, good for any hour! Very fatty, juicy & messy, steakhouse thick patty, nice crunch bringing it together. Too bad the patty was overcooked this time, but still enjoyable even at medium well.

A must have every visit, the ""Chicken Strippers"" ($6.95 HH) : Buttermilk Brine, House-Spiced Breading & Code Sauce. Extraordinary fingers, very juicy with a delicate breading, full of spice & flavor. Recommended!

And of course, the ""Pickle Schnitzels"" ($3.95 HH) : Spicy Dill Chips & Sriracha Ranch. Great rendition, thinly sliced and crispy, with a bit of salt. I love fried pickles, and this one is a steal at the portion and price during Happy Hour.

We decided on Bar Code due its close proximity to UNLV and because of its stellar reviews on Yelp. Our visit happened to coincide with Bar Code's happy hour (3-6PM), which as perfect for us. 

Franziskaner Weissbier ($5 HH): Similar to a Hef, this beer was light and smooth. 
House Wine ($4 HH): Crazy cheap wine that was actually pretty decent tasting. Bar Code had multiple house wines to choose from. I went with the cab. 

Not Your Mom's Tots ($3.95 HH): I think these tots were among the best I've ever had! According to the waitress, most items on the menu are made from scratch, including the tots. They were served piping hot and were absolutely delicious. The 'code' sauce served with the tots amplified the goodness x10. 5/5

The bartender was awesome. She checked in on us frequently and even kicked out a creepy geezer who was bothering us. Kudos to her! The vibe of the bar was a little off though, which is why I rated Bar Code 4 stars versus 5. The music is pretty loud here and very random, going from NSYNC to Alice in Chains. This place definitely has potential, I think they just have to find their niche.

5279836,2017-08-17,2,c5N-XCk-ntpyYRsYkwH7kA,"Recently celebrating their first anniversary, an eastside location not far from UNLV placing the 24/7 joint far from tourists and their unwavering willingness to pay Holsteins or Gordon Ramsay $15+ for nothing more than an All-Beef Patty, Lettuce, Tomato, Onion, Mayonnaise, Ketchup and a Pickle, Bar Code is something of a hidden gem for in-the-know locals, Executive Chef Joe Valdez and his team turning out Food far better than they need to at a price that low-balls The Strip without sacrificing creativity or quality.

Difficult to peg as a place for craft Cuisine from the street, a single story along East Flamingo near Blueberry Hill and the Sketchers Outlet largely blending into the background with a sign that simply suggests it might be a good place to ""Eat / Drink / Play,"" those entering Bar Code will find the interior surprisingly modern, several LCD Televisions centrally located and perfect for watching sports while well-lit alcoves contain darts, shuffleboard and pool tables.

At this point amassing a fair number of regulars, the lunch and after-work crowd said to get fairly large in addition to the typical flow of traffic on game days, it was with greetings from a lone bartender/server that two friends were seated just past 5:30 on a Saturday featuring little more than the NFL Preseason, Chef Valdez present along with one other in the kitchen and happy to chat about his background which started here in Valley before stints in Colorado and years working in the Red Robin test kitchen.

Present at Bar Code from the start, a gig as Sous-Chef quickly seeing him advance to the lead role thanks to hard work and a willingness to go the extra mile in order to make the Restaurant's collection of Burgers, Sides and Salads stand out in a city where there is never a lack of competition, it was after several minutes of candid conversation with Chef Valdez that the decision was made to defer an order to the young man, the meal divided into two Appetizers, two Burgers and ""Dessert"" lasting just under an hour as the Rams took on the Cowboys.

Not drowning out the game sounds with a jukebox, a welcome change compared to places like Aces & Ales or B.A.R. that cannot seem to get enough Journey or Def Leppard regardless of the time or event, it was after a few minutes further perusing the menu that Joe emerged from the kitchen carrying two trays including the lightly fried ""Squid Vicious"" and hand-breaded Chicken Strippers, the Calamari tender and nicely spiced beneath a crispy coat of Panko while the later was Pickle-brined and herbal with a lightly adherent layer of breading that was flavorful and practically oilless.

So far so good, the Code Sauce of Ketchup, Mayonnaise and ""secret"" Spices pairing well with both Appetizers and advisably kept to sauce Fries, it was after another ten minutes that Chef Valdez once again arrived tableside with two of Bar Code's signature Burgers, the 70/30 blend of Brisket, Short Rib and Chuck forming a juicy backbone to housemade Blueberry BBQ, Pulled Pork and freshly fried Bacon on the BBQ Big Burger while the restaurant's eponymous signature gets funky and fragrant with Beer-braised Onions, Bacon Aioli and Blue Cheese.

Grilling the Buns before service and making every Sauce, Jam or Aioli on-site, a labor intensive process most would not expect from a Video Poker and Sports Bar so far east of Las Vegas Boulevard, it was after a few too many fresh-cut Fries had been eaten that Chef Valdez at last arrived with ""Breakfast for Dessert,"" the French Strippers described as a dish he'd invented for his girlfriend making one say ""what waffles?"" as hand-trimmed strips of Chicken Breast brined in Buttermilk were just as crunchy and juicy as those served earlier, but without the Dill and instead laid on a bed of custardy Challah Bread with Fresh Strawberries, Whipped Cream and Housemade Strawberry-Vanilla Maple Syrup.

****Going well above what is necessary for a 24/7 restaurant in Sin City, and smart enough to keep the menu well-crafted and focused rather than offering sub-par versions of ""everything for everyone"" Pub Grub like so many others, Bar Code rivals any Burger-centric spot on the Strip in terms of quality with prices that are about 33% less.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,11,6,4,kOjisomscaK7T_bBW-GKfA

Very refreshing, sweet and tart all at the same time. I ordered the 2AM tots and was not disappointed. Crunchy tater tots covered in cheddar cheese, sour cream, tomatoes, and bacon...YUM! My friends were happy with their burgers and chicken strippers. They even got their drafts at $2.00 each (GO VGK!) bc of the game. I'll be back, and I can  wait to try out the rest of their selections.",dEz2UFdllf3jONMZQgJuWQ,2,2,5,LgXSvDqh4nkghGc4dXJ32g

The food was good. Not fantastic, but good. The burgers were very greasy and the buns fell apart quickly. They were thick and a decent value for the money. But... we got there at 6:30 and they gave us a happy hour menu. So we ordered a couple of half priced appetizers. The portions, however, seemed half size. Tasted fine, but not much of a deal. Especially considering happy hour ended at 6 and we paid full price! It wasn't a big deal, but why give us a happy hour menu if its not happy hour? Also we went for trivia, but it was just buzztime device trivia. Seemed kind of silly to advertise live trivia and have a host when all the questions are just on the device. I wouldn't go out of my way to go back, but I wouldn't avoid it either.",NZ2Nad5rO6oTU6YNXwDajw,0,0,3,QDvOW-xKuhbwXamIrnooKQ

When I left the bar, the man proceeded to give me lip about how the bar prohibited guests from wearing motorcycle helmets inside the bar because he ""didn't know if he was being robbed."" I told him off for making such an idiotic comment and he became hostile and approached my bike as if to push me off. After he realized that I wasn't faxed, he got into a red pickup truck and drove off.

5534034,2018-04-17,1,c5N-XCk-ntpyYRsYkwH7kA,"Picked this up and despite an ordering issue the burger was made fresh and fast. 

Got the BBQ Burger which was this thick delicious patty topped with pulled meat, a perfect BBQ sauce that was just the right amount of sweet and served on lettuce (asked for no bun). They put too much lettuce so I just ate the meat but it was fantastic. This burger literally oozed with flavor, probably one of the best I've had in awhile.

For the side got the loaded tots, and they were awesome, a little on the salty side, but it made sense since it was nacho cheese and bacon which are both salty. I look forward to trying the fried pickles and zucchini. I wish they had a sampler platter of the tots, fries, and zucchini.

Easy to get in and out of and would definitely eat here again.",S_7OkmN0BicgWEt2oMmzIQ,1,0,5,O7olEe94G5qV8z7teRIIiQ
5539881,2018-05-03,0,c5N-XCk-ntpyYRsYkwH7kA,"Let me start by saying ....the food is amazing. Initially i was going to give this place a four star. The two times that i have been here haven't been the best experiences. The first time we came during a golden knight game and it was busy & they were short staffed. Our waiter paid no attention to us. We ordered food and drinks and our drinks sat empty for over an hour before asking us if we wanted more, which we did. When we cashed out she apologized and gave us drink coupons so i let it slide. 

The second time we came it was again during a golden knights game and it wasn't as busy as the first time. My boyfriend and i were one of the first to arrive and the same waitress greeted us and remembered us we got drinks and fries. Second round came fine and then my second drink sat empty for over an hour. When it was almost time to leave our waitress charged our card for someone else's tab that was $60. Our tab was barely $20 since we ordered happy hour drinks. 

Overall the food and establishment is good. I don't think it's the waitresses fault entirely for ignoring us. However the bar needs more staff for nights like Golden Knight games. 

I will consider returning on a night where it's not a golden knights game to re-evaluate my review but so far i am not impressed.",VGP8W1rCyn3e5etCuaEmUA,2,0,3,Rd5Djh4pIioBHwMhrN9gCg

The 8 air purifiers in the ceiling working overtime trying to rid stench from the cigarette soaked walls were louder than the music. It doesn't matter if they have fancy food or craft cocktails if the ambience is off. I give it a few months. Oh yeah and the bar tender investigated our drivers licenses like they were fake! Clearly over 21 and they're Nevada ID's! Thanks for the bad vibes. I will not be back.,bO-nWIf6OnVpZtnX2MCVyQ,7,1,2,dHaGsHI6wZbl7DlFgjAEaw

The stars of the show were their chicken strippers and Americana burger. 

However they seemed to have some issues with expediting the orders. It was an awkward wait between our bites and our burgers. When the burgers (Americana, code chicken) came out they were both over cooked. I had requested medium rare but there was no pink in sight. The burger still tasted amazing but would have been phenomenal if it was juicy too. 

My boyfriends fried chicken sandwich was also dry which is weird because the chicken strips were so moist.",CMu9FmdK8xpiawJowJuGQg,1,0,3,yHitwU2U2NMJd9rBxIMD_w

The place is a Smoky bar which can't be helped I guess. There isn't a lot of table seating but they do have a pool table and a small stage where they have comedy night.  I ordered an American burger and was pleasantly surprised at the flavor and quality.  There are several other interesting burger choices for me to try when I return.  The burger was stacked heavily and about my only complaint, if you can call it that, was how messy it was to eat, ultimately dripping over my hands.  I would have preferred a little less sauce.  The fries were good as well.  The friendly bar staff and many televisions make  it a great place to watch a game.  I will definitely return.",wnO99pBbGqwqOoTQM25iCw,7,4,4,rvh2aG9qu5MlYTeCMa7EgA

We came in on a Friday night around 8pm and Lisa promptly greeted us and gave us the lowdown on the menu. I started with the Jade Buddha drink, a refreshing citrus drink with Absolut citron and muddled kiwi and lime.  My burger choice was the Big BBQ Burger with applewood bacon, Vermont white cheddar cheese, and blueberry BBQ sauce: delicious!  The fries that accompanied the burger were tasty as well, but I didn't care for the sriracha ketchup, instead opting for the Heinz variety.  Service was attentive and I liked that the bar wasn't smoky or too noisy.

A buddy and I walked into this spot on a Sunday afternoon and saw there were a handful of people at the bar watching the NHL playoff game (non Golden Knights game).  We were greeted right away and found seating at a table near a row of TVs.  As much as we wanted to watch the Bruins/Lightning game, I wanted to also watch the Angels game and my buddy wanted to watch the GS Warriors.  The dude that seated us found no trouble in accommodating.  We now were watching three games on three TVs.  NICE.

The burgers we ordered were a great surprise. Both so damn juicy, proportioned well, full of flavor. I got the BBQ Big Burger ($11.95) and he got the NYC ($11.95).  Both were so good, we ended up cutting in half and giving it to the other.  I got mine with a side salad which didn't look appealing but was fresh enough for me to finish.  The fries too which my friend got, had a homemade taste and were so damn good.

I want to definitely come back again because there's so many different burgers.  Bar Code is truly a Burger Bar and I want to try them all.",HixtBO7z5OW5bo_6qo6D_g,3,3,5,hmTuBg-Ewg60Ho0jP4boVQ

The bar is quite spacious with 3-4 different seating areas to the bar. They also have a patio that faces Flamingo Road.
