My order arrived in the specified time and was hot and fresh. I got a large pepperoni pizza and medium wings all for $19.99 and it was so worth it. The wings were fully cooked and had just the right amount of wing sauce. I would absolutely order from them again. They also have great customer service and will deliver out of their service area for a reasonable fee. I'm located in 89166 and my fee was $5.

Unlike true NY pizza, the sauce was flavorless and barely there.  Also missing was the greasiness and the convenient packaging consisting of a flimsy paper plate and a brown paper bag.  Aww the memories....anyway, despite the slice being a bit too dry for my taste, I give it 3 stars because of the joint's convenient location, the price (7 bucks and some change for 2 gigantic slices and a 20 oz fountain drink) and because in my opinion, it is the closest thing to NY pizza I have found in this town (or west of the Mississippi for that matter.).",6bOfuBHdPJ7ubwiGR-Tcig,0,0,3,UbSKsFfgsQXKwsa8jjxCzQ

Being a native New Yorker (Brooklyn STAND UP!) that has recently relocated to Las Vegas, I was very skeptical when they advertised ""Authentic NY Pizza"". 
Even in NY there are so many Italian owned pizzerias that don't offer the quality they once did in the past. They use canned, unflavored sauce and offer extremely thin slices. 
Sabatino's brought me back to NY PIZZA in the 90s. The pizza was oily, but that's exactly how I like it! The slices were VERY LARGE (again, how I like it) and the two slice special was priced well.

690944,2012-07-24,2,zY6f_cFY8HTI3hLlJj3SOg,"This is the partner of Rocco's Pizza- which we have always enjoyed in Summerlin. Aurelio's used to be here and I am GLAD it is gone! The whole inside has been re-done and it is lighter, brighter and above all- CLEAN (something sorely lacking at Aurelios)!

We were greeted promptly, and our server with the golden voice (literally he has a radio voice!) apologized that he wasn't able to serve alcohol yet, but there was soda (even though some of the machine wasn't working) and the alcohol license was in the process of being approved.

We ate in and ordered the Monday night special- a 16"" cheese pizza for $8.99 and added some toppings on one half, and a house salad with their home made Italian dressing.

Our salad came first- typical house salad with iceberg, carrots, a few cucumbers tomatoes and some rather thick cut red onion (thinner might have been better-it was a strong onion!). Their house dressing was good, but not amazing (at least it was home made!)

Pizza was great! Loved the thin crust and the toppings were quality. Not too much cheese, great sauce and plenty to take home! It tasted very much like what we had at Rocco's.

Service was attentive and we were informed of some other interesting menu items we might like to try on our next visit. Water (or other beverages) were kept filled, but no one hovered.

Half way through our waiter informed us that he was also out of the home made canollis....but he also hoped to get those in this location soon. I asked him if he had the zeppolis like Rocco's and he did produce some! They were not fresh...when they are - they are divine, but points for trying and not charging.

Whilst eating, another table sat next to us- an older lady and son/caretaker. She asked for coffee (they don't have that yet), then tried ordering no less than 5 items that they didn't have (yet)! She was very frustrated....and I have to agree! It was explained to her that they use the same menu as their other store- so there are many items they don't have yet at this location. I think I would have preferred a paper menu that was accurate to what WAS available....not promises as to what was to come. At some point bring the full menu of the other location in- but it really is frustrating to order (or want to order) things they do not have. Even at 8 days young (which we all were reminded of several times) the menu can be set. Everyone understands kinks at a new place.....but that many missing items a week in will ensure people will not return or the place opened too early. This being a multiple location establishment, it isn't THAT hard to open it with a mostly full menu available- at least food wise.

Other than that minor irritation, we will definitely return! To have a full meal, with leftovers for $20 (with a good tip) was amazing! I welcome them to our neighborhood and hope they get the alcohol and dessert soon!",1llLRrB6uFwACTleMfoYuA,1,1,4,1G_rpm2VPUyjPMcX8kE3TQ

The ingredients like sausage and pepperoni are very good.  Some pizza places are hit or miss as far as sausage and this place hits.  The wings are very traditional american and well made.  While I have seen a trend for fusion style wings or exotic flavors, this place does traditional american style wings and does them well.

-cheese pizza was dripping with grease
-house salad was bland iceberg, tomatoes, onions, and a few stray cucumbers
-salad dressings were clearly from a bottle and then put into plastic containers
-service was not good. we were not greeted at all when we walked in. instead, we waited, then walked to a booth on our own and a server finally came over. when she did, she was reeeally awkward. she forgot our drink orders. she left halfway through her shift and didn't tell us we would be getting a new server.

At the last minute I decided to order Italian food for delivery. Every selection I chose was amazingly delicious ! We had garlic knots and cheesy garlic bread and a seafood salad and another seafood dish (I think called Seafood Heaven?). Meatballs (soft and yummy) a pasta dish with chicken and sausage (nice and spicy ~yum !). Trying to recall what else but it was so easy to place my order online and choose a delivery time. The time I chose was 6 pm and the food was delivered HOT and ready to eat at exactly 5:55 pm. Very very satisfied !! Adding a tip to my bill was very convenient as well !!! I'll definitely be back !!! Highly recommend this restaurant !!,GUgo7Dg6-cSh--1VS7XCZQ,3,0,5,lTCviow536z8c4JSCxmxcg

1345678,2013-02-10,0,zY6f_cFY8HTI3hLlJj3SOg,"Actually was on the way to have a gyro at a nearby establishment which happened to be closed upon arrival.

My son and I opted for a slice of pizza instead.  I thought it was strange that we were the only 2 people in the restaurant on a Sunday around noon.  There were 3 people who came in to pick up carry out, but nobody else coming or going during our lunch.

I asked if their gyro listed on the menu was available in only a sandwich or as a platter entree.  I was informed that they can't serve gyros because of the lease agreements the competitor has, but it's on the menu because of their other location.  First disappointment.

Upon selection of a couple slices of pizza and a pastrami & corned beef sandwich on marbled rye, I struggled with the way the waiter, who was obviously fighting a cough, continued over to cut the 2 slices from the pie in the counter, while coughing over his arm several times.  Although diverted from our food, I still cringed watching this.  I think asking his colleague to take care of this would have been a much better option.  She, instead ate a slice of the remaining pie off to the side of the restaurant while we waited on our food.

I was looking forward to a good NY pastrami & corned beef sandwich, typically served piled high on warm marbled rye.  What I received instead was a thin corned beef only sandwich on toasted plain rye bread. Pickles on the side, and the ""NY style mustard"" was curiously similar to plain yellow mustard.  Not quite what I was hoping for at the price.

Anyway....this was just a little disappointing in both service and food.  There are far too many options out there to even bother revisiting.  I'm sure their carryout pies are fine for the local community.",6x3aIb8SLZcOFcHEcWBLog,1,0,2,RASTSEtu3Jf1pQYJyonNUA
1347088,2017-06-27,0,zY6f_cFY8HTI3hLlJj3SOg,"Sabatino's used to be my family's favorite pizza restaurant and we always recommended it to friends. Unfortunately, that has changed. Starting with a few weeks ago, my family ordered the #3 family special which was 2 medium two topping pizzas, 18 wings, 2 small salads and garlic knots. After we picked up our food and arrived home we discovered our pizza toppings were incorrect on both pizzas, we were given chicken tenders instead of wings, and the garlic knots were burned. After calling, the employee hesitantly and irritably offered two free toppings on our next visit and 12 free wings, even though the deal was suppose to include 18. The next week we called to place our order and instead of the free toppings the kind employee comped one of our pizzas. We opted for delivery this time and after waiting longer than the time quoted the delivery guy called and said he was at the wrong address and needed the correct one. Our food arrived and was cold. My family was hungry so we ate it anyways. 
Today was my last and final attempt with Sabatino's. I planned with my grandmother, daughter and mother during my mother's lunch break for work to meet here. We sat at a booth and waited to be greeted. The server passed by our table 4 times, no eye contact, no verbal communication. After 15 minutes of waiting, we got up and left. We took our business to Gyro Time next door and had great food along with great service. It's sad to see a great place come to this and I hope they can become the great family restaurant they once were.

1472462,2014-05-08,1,zY6f_cFY8HTI3hLlJj3SOg,"Tonight I would be lazy, so I ordered some pizza.  I had never tried Sabatino's before and decided to give them a shot.  

I ordered my pizza in excitement over what will soon arrive at my door.  Salivating on my couch dreaming of that sweet, sweet pie.  

After some time of watching TV. My dreams of Pie started to fade.  I looked at my watch and an hour had passed.  I asked my roommate if he thinks they got lost.  He made a joke about my mom.  We both laughed, it was good times.

 I called in to check on my order.  The nice person on the line said it will arrive in a few min.  I informed them that if the food does not arrive soon I might end up eating my dog.  I love her dearly but a man needs to eat.  

30min later the doorbell rings.  FOOD AT LAST! I screamed.  I walk outside to collect the goods.  I ask what took so long? the driver didn't seem happy and he just said ""Here"" and sauntered back to his car.  No apology was needed.  I just wanted to know what happened.  He might have had to slay a dragon on the way over.  I'm cool with that.  Dragons are dangerous. 

As I walk into the house my roommate put my dog down and turned off the oven. We open the box in amazement.  PPIIIZZAAAAA!  It looked pretty good.  We both took a slice and cheered to our meal.

We took our first bite, looked at each other and frowned.  The pizza was not that good.  The crust was hard like wood and the toppings were greasy.  We thought that maybe we didn't believe enough.  It worked for Peter Pan, why not us?  Alas, we were wrong.  Happy thoughts and all could not help us.

It's been about an hour since I have eaten and my stomach is growling like mad.  It sounds like 2 Honey Badgers are trying to escape.  My roommate is breathing super heavy.  It might be the food. or that he is out of shape.  Time will tell.  If he is dead by the morning I will have to edit my review.

FANTASTIC!!!! The pizza was that perfect mix of the right crust, tasty sauce, plentiful toppings and cooked up just right. A lot of pizza I don't eat the outer crust as it's usually too thick or too crunchy, but I couldn't wait to get to the outer crust, the outside was golden brown, while the inside was warm and soft, kind of reminded me of the fresh baked Italian bread my Grandpa used to get at the Napolitano bakery right out of the oven. The service tonight was first rate to be sure. From the moment we sat down, they took our drink orders, and served us up some of their delicious garlic knots. They started serving the pizza shortly after, and it was hot and the cheese was gooey, just the way I like it. The group favorite tonight was the double bacon, and there was a lot of bacon!!!!

Staff was excellent! Super friendly and even offered us free oven-fresh zeppolis the minute we sat down. Fried dough covered in confectioners sugar this early in the day?  Why not?  Warm and fresh!

Sabatino's has a ton of great lunch specials - including build-your-own stromboli and calzones - but we were here for the pizza. I ordered a slice of cheese pizza with a side salad which ran about 5.00 I think.  The slices are huge - with a crust perfect for bending in half and imagining you're eating at the counter of a shot-gun pizzeria in the Bowery. I liked the crust here more then Dom DeMarco's - thin, but with the perfect amount of toothiness.  No cracker-like crust here!

The salad was pretty much what I expected, the standard American iceberg salad fare with chopped carrots, red onion and a basic Italian dressing. Not fancy or elevated, but I wasn't particularly expecting that.  

I can't say enough about the staff, really. The gentleman, whom I assume was a manager or owner, was super attentive and immediately made us feel at home. This is the kind of neighborhood place that could easily become a regular stop.",KFWOn7x19RmrO6kzTJYmrQ,1,0,4,YRjkHAiH4SUn0r3bPTS6kA

Service- the person I talked to was alright. He was monotone and you could tell he was tired or just didn't really care. The delivery guy was awesome though. Made me laugh and was very kind. 
Food- the salad was just torn iceberg with an abundance of shredded carrots and sliced onions, 2 cucumber slices and 3 tomato pieces. The vinaigrette was pretty good actually. I mean it did the job but nothing to crazy. 
High-5 to the pizza maker. I asked for double mushrooms and definitely got them. The sauce was kinda gross though. Really acidic and way to much oregano. Maybe from a can? Not my favorite. But the crust was good and the toppings were on point.

We got garlic knots on the house, so good! The cheese pizza was great, crispy and a nice crunchy crust. The meat lovers and hawaiian wasn't as crispy but it was weighed down from toppings. They only used the best toppings, you can taste the quality.  The desserts looked fantastic, I wish I had more room to try them! 

The kids meal was awesome, my son was beyond excited for a pizza slice bigger than his head! 

So we got 2 slices of pizza, a drink, a kids meal, a hot pastrami and a slice of pizza for less than 25$

The staff has always been extremely friendly to us. The dine in was my favorite experience because they gave us an order of their delicious garlic knots while we were deciding what to order (That's at least a $5 value right there). Their food can be a bit pricey depending on what you decide to order, but they have specials basically every night of the week that give you bang for your buck. We went on a Wednesday night and it was a large one topping pizza and  6 chicken fingers for $20 (you could also get this deal with wings if you wanted, but we like fingers better). Easy choice.

2826188,2012-08-04,1,zY6f_cFY8HTI3hLlJj3SOg,"I can only give this business two stars.  I ordered a simple veggie pizza for takeout and was told it would be ready in 25 minutes, a reasonable amount of time for a Friday evening.  I arrived 25 minutes after the order was placed, payed, and was then told that the pizza was not ready, but that it was ""the next one"".  I then watched at least three other takeout orders come out of the kitchen before my simple pizza arrived, some 20 minutes after the stated ready time.  No apology for the delay, no offer of  a free cannoli or something for my time, just a timid ""thanks"". 

The pizza itself was just okay, certainly not worth the wait time.  The crust was thin and chewy, not crisp, but a good texture.  However, it seemed to have been made with almost no salt so it was exceptionally bland.  The sauce was barely detectable except for an occasional burst of dried oregano; definitely a supporting player and not a star of the show.  The cheese was good, not great, but good.  The overall balance of toppings to cheese and crust was very good - the only very good thing about the experience.  The toppings were mushrooms, onions, green pepper and tomatoes.  The pizza suffered from the flaw of most veggie pizzas in that the onions and peppers were undercooked.  The mushrooms were sliced very thin and, like the sauce, often undetectable.  The tomatoes were good.

Had the service been better I could have given Sabatino's a three star rating.  I might go back in a year or so to see if they have worked out the kinks, but I won't be returning any time soon.",HNFdBDFby5gg6nMjqZXehg,5,0,2,lRYeLaZ78qoH9328Onz8Xg

Then someone new started taking orders (Kendall) and things went down hill. The first time she took my order she couldn't stop laughing with an apparent co-worker. When we received our order it was not correct. The second time again, the same disregard for the customer. And again the order was incorrect. We let it go as we loved the food and thought well, new young people (as we have been there) tend to be into their friends and not into the customer service. However, the third time now, I'm upset! I order regularly and to get bad service makes me mad. I work hard for my money and when I have to order food instead of having the time to cook I would like what I asked for. I mean money doesn't grow on trees, right? 
I ordered again tonight as i worked late and wanted something I usually love and yet again, I get Kendal taking my order with the attitude that it was a bother to even take my call. I ordered a plain cheese pizza and 2 house salads. How can you get that wrong? Because I have an allergy to carrots (they create hives) I specifically stated NO CARROTS but, extra onions that I did not get that at all. When the order finally arrived I was displeased to see that my salad have extra carrots and no onions even, when she knew specifically (as she repeated it) that was what I wanted. 
I received my order incorrect, yet again (for the third and last time). I called and asked to speak to the manager who was Sarah ( who let me say,
 had the attitude as this was no big deal) so I could explain my disappointment. She as well, acted as it was no big deal. If anything, she was worse than Kendall. I let her know my concern and how upset I was and she had not one worry in her tone. I mean she said they would refund our money but, no feel of any loyalty to regular customers in any manner what so ever.  I admit I was extremely upset as when you love a place to order from and to be treated so poorly its disconcerting. Now, we have lost a place that we loved to order food from and find a new one (which is exactly what we will do now). 
I recommend you find a new place for food as the customer service (especially from a manager Sarah) to act and make you feel crappy as she did.

Where as, Aurelio's had good pizza, but rude, incompetent people working there, Sabatino's has good people, but the food is somewhere between mediocre and awful.
We went for the lunch special, all you can eat pizza, pasta, salad and garlic knots, $7.99.

Pizza
Where most all you can eat pizza buffets have a variety of pizzas, here it's cheese pizza, served by the slice. If you want pepperoni on it, it's a dollar more. The slices are large, you can fold it over to eat, if you dare. Be careful this pizza is so oily there's oil dripping everywhere. It's lite on sauce, which I like, but there is no flavor might be just tomato sauce and oil. The cheese is normal. The crust has a chemical taste, can't describe it. I tasted it while eating the pizza and narrowed it down to the crust by tasting the crust by itself.

Pasta
You get to choose the pasta type and they put marinara sauce on it. Again the sauce is so oily, it's disgusting.

Garlic Knots
They were pathetic, the garlic knots at CiCi's are considerably better. They were missing something, oh yeah, Garlic. These were like bread knots basted with butter or oil, some kind of lubricant.

Salad
It looks like bagged salad, you pick the dressing.

This is suppose to be NY pizza. I've never been to NY, but I doubt this is what their  pizza is like, since I've heard so many good things about NY pizza. I had pizza from Manhattan pizza, I don't know if it's just a name or called Manhattan because it's NY pizza, it was good.
Save yourself a trip and try somewhere else. For the price, Graziano's is a much better choice, Round Table would have been a much better choice. CiCi's is a better choice than this place.

Update:
I received this from the owner. 
Comment from Robert H. of Sabatino's Authentic NY Pizzeria 5/1/2013  
'Once again...... I have many former New Yorkers who just love our pizza. Perhaps you do need to take a trip to New York before judging us so harshly :-)""

Am I to understand, by your comment, that if I went to New York and had a pizza and pasta and it was the same, oily and tasteless, it would somehow improve my rating of your restaurant?  Let me clarify something, my co-worker and co-eater (who's Italian). the day I commented on, is born and bred in New Jersey, has eaten plenty of ""New York Pizza"" in NY, he also felt the food was too oily and the knots lacking garlic.  8 )",rAa-LxHwU8IP989kvMUJSA,0,1,1,mbTN5iuOKZNdJgPsmRjHCA

There were 3 people.  One couple and 2 guys each eating by themselves.  I walked in, someone looked right at me and kept looking at the tv?  Wow I know I looked rough on weekdays but geez.  Ok whatevs...don't make a show of it girl, they're going in the back to cook something you might want to eat.

SO-I orignally was thinking I'd just get a slice of pizza....ohhh I wish i had taken a pic of it...if this pizza was less than a day old...all the moisture was vaccuum sucked out of the area it had been sitting.  Have you ever puchased a pizza and left the uneaten portion out all night.  Yah, me neither #whitelie.  But it looked like that.

I ordered a calzone, which by far was the worst calzone I had ever tried in my life.  How, how do you screw up bread and cheese?  Have you ever had a bad grilled cheese sandwhich?  Even when burnt they're delicious!  Somehow they managed to have the dough overdone and the cheese was a runny ricotta and mozarella mess.  Marinara, tasteless and super greasy(?).

To give you an idea, I immediately ate a pepto tablet when I was done.

I don't think I willl try this place again.  I'm usually for giving people second chances, but this was so terrible, I'd just really like to walk away from the entire experience.

I called in to see if they had any specials going on and since it was Monday, The girl on the phone suggested the ""Monday Special"" to me. Mondays you can get a large cheese pizza (dine-in or carryout only) for $8.99 (regularly $12.99) plus tax and $1.50 for each additional topping. I thought that was a great price to see if I would even like it or not so I ordered a ""Pepperoni Pizza"" for pick up. The ordering process was easy and I appreciated the great customer service the girl taking the order gave and going over the specials with me.

When I arrived the place was full of people so I took this as a good sign. The inside isn't very big, but clean and cozy. I walked over to the cash register and was greeted by a nice young girl who rang me up and went over the weekly specials with me while my pizza was being boxed up. She also gave me a menu to take home and look over. It wasn't too cold of a night so I asked for some paper plates so hubby and I could eat our pizza at one of the many tables I noticed outside on the way in. Plates, pizza and now drinks in hand we headed outside.

When I first opened the pizza box it didn't look that appetizing, but we all know looks can be deceiving and that was the case this time. The sauce on the pizza is really what stood out to me. The sauce was just tasty! The cheese, crust and pepperoni were good. I had some that was left over for lunch the next day and it tasted just as good, even cold! I will be back to try other menu items!

Pizza sizes are medium (14""), large (16""), extra large (21"") and Sicilian. 

They have over a dozen lunch specials, but here are a few:
-slice of cheese pizza and a side salad for $4.99
-slice of cheese pizza and 1 garlic knot slider for $5.99
-2 slices of cheese pizza for $5.99
-any regular sized hot or cold sandwich and fries for $8.99
-spaghetti with marinara and garlic bread for $4.99

All lunch specials include a drink! Lunch specials are currently from 11 am - 3 pm.

They offer delivery with a minimum $12 purchase and deliver pretty far out so call and check to see if they deliver to you.

If you are looking for an affordable family meal you might want to check out their ""all you can eat anytime"" deal. It costs $7.99 and includes cheese pizza, any pasta with marinara, and a side salad. I am assuming when I walked in and saw so many people, that they were taking advantage of this deal, but who knows. 

Tuesday and Wednesday if you buy any entree, large or extra large pizza at regular price, you get a 2nd of equal or lesser value for half off. Dine-in or carryout only.",Fv0e9RIV9jw5TX3ctA1WbA,27,19,4,MlX9KVTLjivn3ECVwToSdA

We were honestly shocked at the honesty and willingness to correct the mistake. In a short time the driver returned with the correct pasta. Most importantly everything we ordered was delicious!

Customer service for the most part is fantastic. 4 stars! Why the 1 star rating you might ask...

They charge $2 per topping ($2.50 for premium toppings). That makes sense, you are the store, you make the prices. 

They charge $2 per topping for any size pizza. I order an extra large or a personal pizza, either way, I pay $2 per topping.

When I asked how that made sense (after already paying for my $20 personal pizza with out thinking about it), the cashier said that no matter what size pizza it is, they always put 8 oz of each topping. You get the same amount so you pay the same price. Alright, seems fair. Next time I will just buy an extra large and end up with more pizza out of it.

I got my magical billion dollar pizza to find that my $2 worth of olives was actually about 5 olives total. There is pretty much no way on God's green earth that 5 olives is 8oz. And if there was a way... It would not be the puny amount on my pizza. I am going to go weigh my pizza.

This is kind of sad, because I literally live 5 minutes away from the place.  When I have the craving for NY style pizza?  My thoughts automatically wander to someplace across town like Broadway Pizza (sorry guys).  That place makes an excellent pie.

Pizza at Sabatino's looks pretty good and for the most part comes out fresh.  But the crust for me just isn't as tasty as I'd want it to be.  I dunno, maybe it's just me and maybe my taste buds are just out of whack.  Either way, I just don't see myself coming here that often for a slice of the pie.

Sabatino's does have some decent specials, $5.99 for two slices of cheese pizza and a drink.  They also have a pizza buffet going on for $7.99 I believe that comes with:

-Cheese pizza
-Salad
-Pasta with marinara
-Garlic knots
-Drink

We had this buffet to give the place a go but was a bit underimpressed.  I mean, if you're going to offer a buffet, why only cheese pizza?  My guess is to keep the costs down.  I don't mind cheese pizza (when it's good and cheesy), but Sabatino's was light on the cheese.  The salad was basic bag salad with some tomatoes and red onion added.  The pasta was just penne with marinara sauce.  Their sauce wasn't anything special, I hate saying it but it's possible it wasn't made in-house.  The garlic knots?  I've had better.  Wasn't worth the money per person for their buffet.  I rather have stuck with $5 per person at the local Cici's pizza.  There you know you're not getting 'authentic' NY style pizza, but you get more choices.  

Service was ok, a bit slow but very friendly.  It's possible we had a newer server helping us out.  Restaurant just wasn't that busy on a weekend, it's kind of a sign that folks might think Sabatino's is run-of-the-mill.

First off, the food arrived super fast!  We got it almost 15 minutes earlier than the quoted time. We tried pizza, chicken, and pasta and everything was hot.  This is always good with us because we are always down to eat!

The food itself was ok.  Nothing special, but not bad either.  The pizza was a thin crust style and a little on the greasy side.  The baked ziti was ok, but again nothing special.  The chicken fingers were pretty good, but tasted like most bar chicken fingers.  Again nothing special.  Everything tasted ok and will do if you are in a pinch, but there are plenty of other places in town with great food that I would rather visit first.

I also think the prices at Sabatino's are high for what you actually get.  Our meal was $45 and I think it should have been about $27-35 max.  I have no problem paying to great food, but this place is too high, in my opinion.

In stark contrast to the sandwich I had on my first visit to this establishment, the stromboli I had on the second was a winner.  I was about to order a build-your-own three topping 'boli when I saw the menu ready eggplant, roasted red pepper and smoked mozzarella calzone/stromboli.  That sounded great so that is what I went with.  I also ordered Abita Amber beer on draught.  As I sipped my beer and watched whatever sports news show was on TV while waiting eagerly for my 'boli I was brought a bascket of garlic knotts.  These twisty little nubbins of dough were hot and fresh.  Not to mention delicious with their garlic topping and fresh marinara asuce for dipping.  These knotts alone were worth the second visit to a place I originally did not put much stock in.  And then came the stromboli looking all wicked good.  It was stuffed with cheese, pieces of red pepper and some strange looking but awesome tasting eggplant.  The eggplant looked batter fried rather than breaded.  Regardless,  it was good eats.  I ate two of the three large pieces of the stromboli and took the other home.  Can you say breakfast?  I'm a fan now as even as leftovers this stromboli was fantastic.

Been our go to for authentic NY pizza and meatball sandwich for a long time (fiancé is from NY so is a must that we order the best) but since we just learned about new owners when we called in our order we questioned the guy on the phone about changes to the food. He assured us it's the same.  
No. No it's not. They get 2 stars because the positive is that I didn't have to cook and they delivered. 
Meatball parm was not toasted and pretty dry (no sauce). Meatballs were different and delivered in styrofoam. Prior to ownership change the sandwich had good amt of sauce, toasted and wrapped in the paper lined foil. 
I always have a small pie with olive oil instead of red sauce, pepperoni, black olives and extra cheese. The crust is normally thin, as authentic NY should be. 
Not anymore. It was thick, like frozen crust, can't be sure there was olive oil, cheese is not the same quality as before and let's not forget that it was cold. 
They used to be so much better than Rocco's but now they both are terrible and there is no good place to get authentic NY pizza that we're aware of. Apparently it was one of the cooks that bought the place. He's clearly gone cheap.  Sorry Sabatino's....we were regulars. We won't be back.",NwUGfcy15bdlQDsCoCQ-mg,4,0,2,nF0KrBLDf-Q_WVM9vTMyBw

The order process: by phone it is easy as pie, in person it's the same. By Yelp's eat24 feature,... Not so great. This place is popular and typically the eat24 orders go last in line. 

The ambience: I've only gone on weekends and can say most employees are trying to deal with the rush as best they can but it can seem a bit chaotic. Pizza boxes stacked high, a thing NYC joints do to prepare for rushes; here it looks like decor (I hope I'm wrong). Also lots of photos of snowstorms back in NYC... Why be nostalgic about that I'm not sure of.

The wait: back in NYC waiting 30 min is ideal, but 50-60 minutes is the norm. In the suburbs of a suburban city, 60 minutes is outrageous, however it seems to be the norm here. Even when I ordered by phone and stopped by after the prescribed 15 minutes I still waited about 10 more. When ordering online it took literally an hour... Oy vey..

And now, the pizza: 
Cheese, excellent. Sauce, herb-y perfection. Crust: thicker than old-school city slices but crispy. All together it reminds me of today's slices back in NY.

I was not impressed. Their Greek salad on the other hand had fresh lettuce, tomatoes, plenty of kalamata olives and red onions and feta. Balsamic was flavorful but nothing spectacular. 

The fiancé had the turkey club sandwich with wilted lettuce and old gritty darkened tomato and cheese that was dried out on the edges and stale bread. It was a terrible debacle of bad ingredients and poor design. Sandwiches aren't that hard. Start with fresh ingredients and the rest follows along. 

Sabatino's will not be going into my speed dial for delivery. I'd give the salad a 4, pizza a 2 1/2 and the sandwich a 1.",-AGXyI_K8StzQ7CGehQ2tQ,4,1,2,JyiCPkKJuWkNksIOtI0Qsg

5140027,2013-01-18,0,zY6f_cFY8HTI3hLlJj3SOg,"Easy 5 star...here's why :

The pizza is awesome.  These are huge NY style slices...definitely need to be folded.  Crust is thin and yummy...toppings and sauce are good.

I am a HUGE pizza fan, of all shapes and sizes, and my entire life I've been a pepperoni lover...fan...connoisseur.  But after a visit from Sabatino's, my life has changed LOL.

You gotta do their sausage topping.  It is amazing!  It is slightly sweet, full of spices and flavor.  This blew away their pep topping, and made the slices.  OMG great!  See if you agree!

The other reason why this place is an easy 5 star spot....the prices are stupid cheap.

I felt like I was robbing this place.  $7.99 for an AYCE cheese pizza, garlic knots, pasta, and salad?  And no, this isn't some ghetto or nasty buffet style food spot (don't let the ""food showcase"" scare you away...they don't serve that food to us!).  It is an extra $1 to get toppings, and an extra $2 for any way you want em.  So for $9 we got all this food!  And yes, the AYCE is all day.

Since you already know how good the pizza is, I will fill in the rest.  The knots are pretty good, not mind blowing, but good.  The pasta is ok...but I won't bother with them again.....I have become jaded with excellent pasta from Italian spots in town.  The salads I didn't touch..but the company said they were ok.

They also have 2 slices + drink for $5.99 or something like that.  These slices are like 4 regular pizza place slices.  

Service is also pretty good.  The server was friendly and refilled and requested often enough.

Yes, it is worth the drive.  Give it a shot!",eZZyuJDouIg4p-GYB3PV_A,4,0,5,TqZtpV1AoKu_ZXm5_8fOZg

Very clean and spacious. The atmosphere is bright and happy and has plenty of reminders of some of what NYC is about. I particularly love the black and white pictures of the city, old and new. One of the things I love about them the most is that they have pictures of other NYC boroughs other than Manhattan. Bronx, Queens, Brooklyn, and they may even have Staten Island. It's a very comfortable and colorful restaurant that invites you in and invites you to stay a while. The restrooms are kept very clean and stocked.

The service is adequate. Friendly, efficient, nothing to rave about but it works. Its what is should be and nothing more. 

The food is what gives this place 4 stars instead of 5. It's just OK, but for the price, it's good. You can get your usual two-slice deal here for about $6 which isn't bad if you're looking for a quick substantial meal for a good price. They tend to get a bit inconsistent with their pizza slices. Sometimes it's E 116th Street perfect, and sometimes not so much. The last time I eat there I couldn't fold my slice in half without it falling apart with is not a good thing. Other times the crust is perfectly thin and sturdy. The sauce to cheese ratio is excellent.

We ordered the monster and at other restaurants they normally fill the pie up so you much you cant see nothing else. Here the toppings barely filled up the 2nd largest pie they make.

The grease on the pizza wasnt overly excessive but I did have to ask for extra napkins to soak it up on the two slices I consumed. This was telling me they were using low quality toppings.

The garlic knots were very tasty and the tomato sauce they served with them was bland as well but you could taste the tomato so congratulations I guess?

The wait staff was very patient with this being our first time and their menu being a cluttered mess of Italian food Im sure they are used to a million questions before a party is ready to order. I spent a few minutes trying to determine if this was a pizzeria or an Italian pasta restaurant? 

The wait staff kept or drinks full and checked on us throughout our meal without being obnoxious about it. (I did have to explain what Canadian Bacon was though and that just seemed like something they should automatically know)

The Angel Hair Pasta wasn't real Angel Hair(full size pasta isn't Angel hair) and the sauce was similar to the pizza and was so weak my GF asked for Tabasco to add flavor to it.

The decor is cool sports memorabilia and I was able to glance at a football game from my seat so it seemed like a cool place to grab a slice (they sell it by the slice) and watch a few mins of a game. The TVs arent at the best angles for all the seats so make sure you get their early to ensure you are able to get a good view of the game.
