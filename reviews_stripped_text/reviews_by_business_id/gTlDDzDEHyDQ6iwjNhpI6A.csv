That said, what is going on with this place!? I haven't seen the owner in months. I visited on Sunday and though they have 4 people working the dining room, service is a disaster. You have to beg for water and napkins. My water was refilled once in the whole visit, but the check was promptly delivered before we finished eating. 

The food quality is WAY down. I couldn't cut the chili chicken with a knife, it was dried to jerky. My favorite, richly flavored makhani is now a strangely over spiced lackluster sauce. 

The overall quality has taken a major hit in the owner's absence. I can only hope he returns and whips that place into shape!",ppANxDeIeRY5xEkiRCkJCQ,0,0,2,VOucEuPfOoKUG5Ft2fFb4Q

98925,2014-01-20,0,gTlDDzDEHyDQ6iwjNhpI6A,"I was wondering if part of my less than ""a-ok"" experience was the result of dining alone. I often find that single diners don't get the same quality of service as larger parties - I've always thought that this is due to the lower expected tip - who knows.   In this case I ordered an appetizer, soup, and main course, but the soup came out first and while I was about 3 spoonfulls into the soup, the appetizer and main course arrived.  Of course, by the time I got to the main course it was cold.  When the manager visited the table to ask me how things were, I told him how the food had been served and his response was to smile and walk away.  Otherwise, the service was prompt and pleasant.

I had lamb filled samosa for appetizer which was overcooked and the meat dried out.  The Dahl (lentil soup) was watery and tasteless, and the $12 dish of lamb curry had about 7 small chunks of meat hidden in a lot of sauce.   For $2 extra I got about 2 tablespoons of chutney and another $2 for an equal amount of spiced pickles.  The best part of the dinner was the onion stuffed naan.

Mount Everest could be mistaken, both inside and out, for a fast food joint, except for the white cloth napkins and tablecloths.

Again, if 3 stars means A-OK, then this place should be 2 1/2 stars for Just OK.",B3tQ-TJ6Ca_AxKn15VAEEA,0,0,3,gYlBoy1_FGgzzyU4IwdmZg

After eating at Mt. Everest , it's all downhill. ha ha get it? that's right my friend, you will never have it as good.  
So far I have only been here for the lunch buffet. Here at least once a week. sometimes twice.  My only previous experience eating Indian was when I lived in nyc for 20 years. There is probably 2 million indian restaurants there....one for every cab driver. Let me tell you my friend, even the best one there could not compete with mt. everest. I remember the last place i used to eat at, called CHOLA. Supposedly it was great. Always packed with indians. Their food was always greasy and made me feel tired afterwards (probably from chemical, or cheap quality?)

Mt. everest is NOT like any other indian restaurant you have eaten in. The food is NOT greasy!!! The quality of the ingredients is fresh, and of high quality. I don't know how they do it...EVERY dish at that buffet is a solid TEN. 

I wish they would raise their buffet price to keep all the riff-raff like you yelpers out. Sadly, this place gets jam packed at lunch. 

The best part is that a corona is only $3.50. I really appreciate it when restaurants don't try to RAPE customers on liquor prices. Actually the food is the best part.

wait the best part is the great indian music videos on tv there...wow, those guys know how to deliver a show",fgEnOQU8Mo9dXz6bXwIGyA,2,0,5,ZeFu-9P0ZZHKnX6IHAR0cQ

A note to the owners if you read this. Get rid of the florescent lighting and add more soft lighting. Maybe get spend a bit to warm up the atmosphere and you will have a winner restaurant! good luck.

Really, all the food I've had here has been excellent!

I also love their lunch buffet.  It's a good deal at $10.99, and there is always great variety.  I've been able to try many things that I would have never ordered (goat curry - yum!) but there are also always some of my favorites.  Their dinner menu is reasonably priced (especially with a Groupon) but the lunch buffet is definitely the deal to get if you're in the area at lunch time.

The first time I went the location was a little scary - it's on the corner next to a gas station and Mariana's supermarket and the outside is not super bright.  I was a little nervous, but as soon as I stepped inside I felt much better.

We like Indian food and based on the reviews were looking forward to this place.  It was virtually empty when we arrived, and we were seated immediately.  I mentioned our coupon for $25 off with a purchase of $45 or more.  So we had to eat a lot!  Easy enough!  Our waiter, who I think was also the owner/manager, suggested the Tandoori chicken to start as an appetizer,  Eat a few pieces and take the rest home , which is what we did.  The chicken was that awful red color that you find on most tandoori chicken, but it was very moist and delicious as were the onions and peppers served along with the chicken.  Side note:  We have only had tandoori chicken at one other restaurant in town that wasn't that awful red, and it was the best ever.  But I digress.  

We ordered two kinds of naan, garlic naan and lamb filled naan.  The lamb filled naan was OK, but didn't have a real lamby taste, but the garlic naan - OMG  I could have made a meal on just that.  I wanted a lamb dish for my entree and Rogan Josh was suggested, and it was delicious.  Very tender and the sauce was perfect.  Put some on my lamb, the rice and scooped up some with naan.  My husband got a fish curry.  It seemed to me to be very much the same sauce that was on the lamb but with fish chunks in it.  I wasn't crazy about it, but he really enjoyed it. We also had a cauliflower and potato dish that we really enjoyed. I forgot to order raita, which I usually love with Indian food.

We too got a complimentary rice pudding dessert , which unfortunately we were too full to finish.  But it was delicious too, so next time I'll make room for it.

I didn't notice the neighborhood.  It's in a strip mall with a large Mariani's supermarket behind it.  It's not inexpensive, but definitely not over-priced.  While it is number two on our list of favorites, it is somewhat less expensive and definitely closer to home than our number one, so we will definitely be returning very soon!",-8bfKCvDClxD3iKX9o7J5w,1,0,4,mUu5iUI3zLWteey2JNG20A

When on site at my client in Las Vegas I cannot wait for my lunch break so I can jet down to Mt. Everest India Cuisine for my much needed Indian food fix. I became aware of this place after searching Yelp for an Indian restaurant and have never looked back.

The restaurant is just a couple of minutes away from my work site so the lunch buffet works out really well. I can immediately sit down, order my plain naan bread and start dishing up.

The food is always flavorful and there are always very many options to choose from. They take care of the vegetarian and the meat lovers between us. I take particular joy in the Chana Masala at this venue - a delight which is shared by one of the waiters who told me this a while ago :)

I love the fact that I can go back to scoop some more of any Indian curry with which I can enjoy the remainder of my naan bread. I have ordered a Chicken Tikka Masala take out with Mt. Everest before and that sparked off my 'must have' mindset with which I now approach every trip to Las Vegas.

I confess that I will easily come here more than once per single work week because that is how good the food is. And as for the price - you will hardly ever convince me of better value for money elsewhere.",xmRm33U_krXAJlrnwVud7Q,0,0,4,AlgRI3FuBKI1BV3TiydnLQ

The food is delicious; there's various traditional options, including basmati rice, samosas, chicken dishes (e.g., chicken tikka), dal makhani, and other vegetarian dishes.  There's also fruit.  The buffet actually has a good variety of food.  

My absolute favorite is the sweet rice, which is orange colored and has peanuts (or cashews?) in it.  I have a sweet tooth and love rice, so this is the best of both worlds for me.  I'm not a huge meat eater, but am not vegetarian either so I end up loading up on the sweet rice.    

My runner-up favorite (or actually maybe tied) is the naan.  Whoa nelly, the naan is ALWAYS warm and soft.  We always get a basket that has plain naan and naan with garlic.  The garlic naan is super good.  Although I'm sure it's a huge faux pas, I love getting the orange marmalade from the buffet (for the fruit) and putting just a little on the naan.  That's my dirty little secret at Mt. Everest.

Overall, it's a great place to have lunch.  It's generally busy or at least half way full.  I think it also feels a little nicer because the tables in the center of the restaurant have linen table cloths.  Oh!

I remember hostel messes in India doing that to keep people from eating too much??? I agree with some of the reviewers here that the Owner/waiter needs to have an attitude makeover. He scowls if people ask for another round of nans.Thankfully his cellphone did not go off while we were there...And rice pudding as a desert! I can't remember when a Indian resturant got away with pulling that stunt off. India has so many wonderful deserts and surely rice pudding is somewhere down at the bottom of that list....If you have to eat Indian in LV, maybe this would be my recommendation just because others are worse (Mint-ok, Origin-terrible)",s3tcE8idZDP3WTHpGvbzOg,0,0,3,AYbiLbQsDL2z1qfgNPeY0A

I don't know why, but my husband and I always order our ""staples"" when we go to an Indian restaurant and we can be pretty particular about them.  Things were no different here.  Our staples are: Saag Paneer (called Palak Paneer here), Vegetable Korma, Mango Lassi, and Garlic Naan.  Because we had a restaurant.com coupon, we were also able to order Paneer Tiki Masala and Vegetable Samosas.

Normally at other Indian restaurants this would be a ton of food for us which (sadly) we can finish if we are hungry enough (but we are giant pigs).  Mount Everest takes the cake for largest serving sizes in the valley.  We had two boxes of leftovers!  You are definitely getting your money's worth here.

Not only are the portions huge, but this is some of the best Indian food I've had.  They have given my beloved Mint a run for their money.  The Paneer Tiki Masala had great flavor and lots of paneer.  Plus the paneer was fantastic- it was denser than most paneer and had a very mild flavor.  I could be wrong, but it seemed like it was made fresh.  The Vegetable Korma was mildly spiced (in a good way) and was loaded with a large variety of fresh vegetables.  The Saag Paneer was a little different than what I'm used to, but I still enjoyed it.  It was a little milder, had a lot of cream, and the spinach was well-blended.  All these dishes we ordered medium, but they were pretty mild on the spice.  I think we could have could have ordered spicier and been ok.

The free Papadums were good and I enjoyed the mint and tamarind sauces.  The mango lassi, while having a very interesting intense orange color I'm not used to, was very good as well.  The vegetable samosas were gigantic but a little bit on the greasy side.  The garlic naan had every inch covered in garlic (hooray!) but seemed a little uncooked in the middle.  

The service was very friendly but a little slow at times, especially when the place began to fill up.  The building may be a little iffy on the outside (what is that, an old Pizza Hut?) it was very nice on the inside and very clean.  Plus they play Bollywood movies!

Oh, and did I mention that they gave us an extra giant order of rice for all our leftovers?  For free?

Overall, this is a great place to enjoy some delicious Indian food.  Just be prepared to take some home!",ELfzWgdf64VBLi5z1ECItw,6,3,5,7zcKkTELe3CBGZ8c6akLRA

Thank god at least the mango lassi was good. People who have never tasted the actual Indian foods will think this is the taste of Indian foods. This is not Indian food flavor. It is tasteless.

I visited this place first time in September, and ordered chicken tikka and some other stuff which was okay enough. After that we visited this place once again because we wanted to grab quick lunch - and it was a complete letdown. The two stars that I am giving are for the fluffy and warm naan bread that they serve and the decent service. But that's about it.
The lunch buffet was bad. No second thoughts about it. The chicken tandoori was the driest that I ever had. The chili chicken tasted like it was from a bygone era. The whole non veggie menu tasted like it was recycled. The veggie courses were poor as well - everything tasted like it was half cooked or made with quantity in mind.

I was glad that the outward appearance of the restaurant had been mentioned, as it may have kept me from going in if I had just been driving by. Once you enter though, it's a great environment with the white tablecloths and napkins. As someone dining alone, I particularly enjoyed the Bollywood playing in the corner. It kept me entertained while I was waiting for my food, which was an excellent break from the standard of playing with my phone. I ordered the Chicken Tikka Masala, which is my basis for judging a restaurant (much like Pad Thai at a Thai restaurant). The sauce was amazingly creamy, and had a slow burn to it, which I find the hallmark of a good sauce. I want the spice, but not at the expense of the flavor. The naan was perfect with a crispy edge and soft center. Ideal for sopping up the sauce. 

But even more than the food, the service was phenomenal. Everyone is very friendly, but give you your space. My water never got below half-way full, and I can put away water like a camel, so that's impressive. And when I had a problem, they were endlessly gracious and worked with me while I figured it out. Few restaurants would take the time or effort to come up with a mutually satisfying solution the way that they did.

End result: If I lived here, I'd weigh a million pounds because I would eat here all the time. As it is, I'll have to settle for stopping in every time I'm in town.",EAhkdF_b_jGHC_GhExb06g,0,0,5,6zk2_Gnvkp1Gcx6pebiIYg

After spending 25 years in a part of the country where Indian food ( great food at that ) was as common as a Starbucks - I got used to my week having curry stains on my fingers, and then it happened, I moved.... and moved to a place that not only did not have Indian food, but the town had not one red light, nor anyone who liked THAT type of food. Uggggggggg.

Then on a trip to Las Vegas, I found Mt. Everest, and fell in love!

The wonderful people there understand what great food, friendship, and service is. I had even left a book there and they held on to it for over a week until I could return. I wonder if it was my subconscious having me forget it so that I had to go back for another wonderful experience. Yummmmmmm !!!

To top it off, they even called me a cab. I felt like royalty, and left knowing that I have not only found the best food in Vegas, but that I had also made friends. 

I will soon be moving my business to Vegas, and know that when I return there is a place with friends, and great food, to come to anytime I get the urge.

The chicken tandoori was a little dry and mostly smothered in bell peppers, onions, and cilantro. Cilantro??? Had I known about the cilantro I would have requested without it. No basmati rice either although it specified in the menu that it came served with rice. Tikka was exactly the same.

Fell sick after eating this food and that ruined my whole trip. Please don't take people's health for granted. I wish I could give minus stars.
Now let's describe this in detail. First they served complimentary papad which was soggy. After all it was complimentary.
The vegetable korma had literally big pieces of vegetables. Ok option is you cut it and eat. What if the potatoes are not cooked, well in that case u can't cut. The cauliflower pieces were so big that I wondered whether they even had a knife in the kitchen to use it.
Now the next was goat biryani. It had sweet corn in it, who puts sweet corn in a goat biryani. Well they just used the ready to use cut vegetables and that has corn. Plus they had all kinds of dry fruits which was never mentioned, people can be alergic to some kinds of nuts. Now the million dollar question, how was the goat. Answer is amazing and normal human being teeth can't chew it. It was so hard that I literally had to throw away most of the goat pieces. It seems that they thought that they had to simply put goat pieces in the rice. FYI the goat has to be cooked well before putting it in the rice. I can go on and on but never mind, all I can say I will remember this place for a long time.",Wv1E2s6LIZhcdZBsaJqrtw,1,1,1,4RRyh38jhr53KRJ31NFv5g

727230,2015-05-01,0,gTlDDzDEHyDQ6iwjNhpI6A,"Wanted to try Indian food in Las Vegas. Since my last visit there were over a half a dozen establishments. We picked this place because it had a good yelp rating. When we got there around 830, the place was ratehr quiet. Its a spacious restaurant but when its not packed (on a Saturday night), you start to wonder. It took a few moments before they got our table ready and a little coaxing for them to come an take our order. Although we were in no particular hurry, they did not seem to be anxious to serve us. I must confess the staff were in uniform and when they finally got to us, they were very pleasant.
The best part was the food. We ordered Shahi Paneer and Bhindi Masla. (we were vegetarians). The food was delivered by someone who seemed like an important person (could have been one of the owners - he was not wearing a uniform) and in an almost ceremonious manner !! The flavoring was very balanced (we asked for medium), tasteful, well presented, hot and in adequate quantity for two. The Naans were fluffy and fresh. My acid test for North Indian restaurants is the paneer tikka masala but the shahi panner gave me enough evidence that the chef knew what he was doing. We finsihed our meal leisurely and just as we  were finsihing up, we noticed the other tables were filling up. After it was Las Vegas and perhaps we were there a little early.

744181,2016-07-28,0,gTlDDzDEHyDQ6iwjNhpI6A,"Straight up some of the best Indian food I  have ever had. I took my girlfriend there a few months ago for her birthday as she's never had Indian food before but always wanted to try it. The restaurant is in what looks to be a former Pizza Hut or maybe a KFC and they set up the buffet trays where the cash registers used to be. Despite the former use of the space, they managed to create a very nice ambiance inside, dark and with banging Bollywood songs on the TV. Those were some great music videos and our waiter was very knowledgeable about the actors/signers and movies being shown and was happy to share. 

As for the food, as I already said it is some of if not the best Indian food I've ever had, and I'm no novice. I found that if there's  something not  on the menu that you'd like, ask and they'll make it. I'm partial to goat vindaloo which they didn't have on the menu but were more than happy to make. My girlfriend got chicken tikka masala. Both our curries were a 10 (which was a tad  ambitious for her) and the spice was very good. The vindaloo was done perfectly as was the chicken. I've found a lot of places when you order a 10, they just dump a bunch  of cayenne to heat it up, but it was clear it was an across the board spice increase  and you could taste the difference. My girlfriend also had  a mango lassi  and while I'm not as familiar with them as I  am curry, it seemed really really good. 

As I mentioned, my girlfriend was  a bit overzealous in ordering a ten and while she managed to eat it, it was still a bit too spicy. The manager  must have noticed she was having issues because he offered  us a free serving of gulab jamun for her troubles. They definitely earn top marks for service as well as food.",MoDOi4cryc7STQ4A_RHSrA,0,0,5,f8Wzt_cveWaSu1pg-xwvsw

Figured a lunch buffet would be a good way to sample a variety of dishes. The buffet line itself wasn't very large, smaller than anticipated. The standouts for me were the samosas, chicken tikka masala, and goat curry. The goat curry was almost like a very tender beef pot roast. Unfortunately I think the tandoori chicken suffered from being on a hot buffet line because it was extremely overcooked and almost inedible, though you could taste the flavors. It was a bit of a shame.  There was also an eggplant and potatoes dish that was extremely tasty.  

Unfortunately I got full quicker than I wanted to, and one plate for me was enough. Though I wanted to go back for seconds of the tikka masala. 

Service was efficient, with several of the guys always pitching in to refill waters and take away used plates. Don't know if dinner time is different, but at lunch the employees seem to not wear any uniform and just wear casual clothing.

First, the price is great at under $8 for the lunch buffet. The manager and staff were very nice and attentive. We were seated right away, so no wait around 12pm.

I tried everything, the chicken curry, chicken korma, veggie korma, palik paneer, dahl, soup, rice pudding, etc. with a hot Indian chai.The veggie korma was very creamy and seemed even better than the chicken, though the chicken was really good. This isn't diet food and we had a very light dinner since we were full all day. I saw some people get the buffet to go, which seemed like a good idea. At $8, you meet or beat the price of most other lunch spots.

Other stuff: chai was as it should be. Nothing super special, but I'd order again. The garlic naan was different, but we prefer regular naan. The garlic changes the flavor of the food too much. Regardless, it's nice having warm, fresh naan brought to your table instead of having it sit on the buffet .

went back yesterday for the lunch buffet and it was seriously disappointing. 

the food wasn't as good as it use to be (before the place got popular). the food seemed to lack the love and attention it use to receive.  much of the buffet items weren't even refilled, one of them just had sauce left, ALL THE MEAT WAS GONE. (f.y.i i even checked before i left to see if it was refilled and still NOTHING.)

service wasn't all that great either. the owner was busy on the phone the whole time, didn't give much attention to his customers.

what was good before WCAP (went cheap after popularity):
+ we use to be seated and now he just points to a table for use to go to.
+ we use to get our water refilled without having to ask and now i have to wave down the waiter. 
+ we use to get the bill brought to the table, now we have to go up to the cashier
+ the rice pudding dessert use to actually have the consistency of pudding and now its super runny

Probably enough food for four people, but it was so good that we polished most of it off.  The vegetarian platter came with an appetizer of deep-fired vegetable fritters - well seasoned and not a hint of grease.  Also a rice pudding dessert - sweet and light.  A standout was the homemade cheese in the palak paneer.  Also the naan.  The chicken tandoori was the best I've ever had.  So often it can be dry and stringy.  This was juicy, tender, and perfectly seasoned.  There were two servers, both gracious and helpful.  Although this place is close to the Strip, it was not touristy.

We stood by politely waiting, until he pointed us to sit *with his CHIN* - the phone still strapped to his ear, never once addressing or welcoming us to sit by words!   I was surprised, but didn't say anything.  

The restaurant itself was really dark inside, there were no lights turned on at all, just a little natural light coming from the small heavily curtained windows.  Nice surroundings and kind interactions make food taste better in my line of thinking, so this restaurant just failed in these respects.   

The buffet itself was fine, nothing was amazing nor was anything bad.  After we sat with our food, the same manager brought a basket of naan and actually TOSSED it down onto our table as he walked by without even making eye contact with us, still jabbering away on his phone.

They had a big selection of veg and meat dishes and also a south indian sambar and idli option. The place was very busy and it took about 15 min. after we had served ourselves to get a naan.
The good items on the menu were:
Kheer(rice pudding)-amazing!
samosa-nicely seasoned and not greasy at all
butter chicken-very good
roghan josh( lamb)-very good

The not so good:
dal makhani-dal was not cooked completely and was tooooo salty
kadhi-it was made very well but toooooo salty again
pakora-dry and hard
white rice-dried out

Since they were busy, it was very difficult for us to get the attention of the server(who was the only one doubling as the cashier as well). We gave up and didn't get a second naan. It also took forever to get the bill so we finally walked up and paid at the register.

The lamb did not have that gamey lamb taste and several of us who do not normally eat lamb went back for seconds (and thirds??).  The samosas were the best I have ever tasted (my husband is Indian) because they were not overwhelmed by potatoes.  You could actually eat one and still have room for the rest of your meal.  The service was excellent and based on the variety of different customers we saw enjoying their lunch Mt Everest India's Cuisine is clearly a favorite and worth the short cab trip from any Vegas hotel.

1213205,2017-11-28,1,gTlDDzDEHyDQ6iwjNhpI6A,"Wow. As in W-O-W. Full disclosure: I never thought I'd stumble upon my favorite traditional Indian restaurant in the middle of the Mojave desert, but this was no mirage yelpers. Mt. Everest is hands down some of the most delicious Indian I've ever tasted. 

Right off the bat, this place has got a great atmosphere. Colorfully decorated and dimly lit with upbeat Indian music and a friendly and attentive wait staff. I felt welcomed right away and was glad to find that the menu was just as accommodating to me with its many vegetarian dishes. My biggest problem was narrowing down to a few dishes because truth be told, I wanted it to order up everything on that menu. But I started off with just the complimentary papadum, which was spiced with cumin and went perfectly with their mint chutney. 

Let's just hit the brakes for a second here so I can tell you about this glorious green creation that became my favorite mint chutney ever to grace these tastebuds. It was just divine. So fresh and so smooth with the perfect balance of spice and herbs. My best advice? Arm yourselves with multiple sides of it and get ready to add that magic to the everything you eat - you won't regret it. 

I started things off with the samosa which was flaky on the out, fluffy on the in, and stuffed with a yummy compilation of peppered potatoes and peas. Then I moved right on over to the vegetable pakora which didn't disappoint with the light and spicy batter (both integral mint chutney moments here, people). Then, as I was at this point very familiar with the art of going ""all in"" (RIP all my chips at the roulette table), I ordered up the whole Vegetable Thali which came with vegetarian appetizers and palek paneer, daal, and kofta. The paneer cheese was delicious, the lentils in the daal were too, and the kofta was a mix of delicious vegetables in a creamy tomato sauce, topped with nuts which really kicked the dish up a notch texturally. I also ordered the aloo gobi and the potatoes and cauliflower were cooked just right. 

In a lot of cases, I'll order Indian with a high spice level only for the dish to come lackluster and plain as ever in the spice department. This wasn't the case at Mt. Everest; everything I ordered had me feeling like one of my girl Daenerys' dragons and I loved every minute of it. 

Garlic naan was hot and fresh with great buttery and garlic flavor, the basmati rice was light and the perfect compliment to all of the plates. And the rice pudding was the first I've ever finished when ordering up the vegetarian dinner plate. It was an excellent cool down to a fiery and flavorful feast. At the end of our meal, the owner came to introduce himself and offered to make us another dessert especially for the table. After feeling like I ate my way through India itself and then halfway into Bangladesh, I declined - but you better believe your girl will be back to cash in on that goodness someday in the near future.

If you're visiting or in the area, I can't recommend this place enough. There's a reason it's racking up these five stars fanatics. Whether you're a local or just a passing tourist, Mt. Everest will have you feeling like you hit the dinner jackpot.",IBMwQKNEiWTfdVKuum-Hxg,3,1,5,8JdN0LqamvoAAG1q6G30rg

Pros:
Plenty of variety - Chicken tikka, tandoori chicken, saag paneer and so forth. The naan is freshly made, but be sure to mention custom requests such as Garlic naan etc while you are being seated (or they assume you want it plain).

Cons
While the food quality ranges from good to excellent, the customer service is lacking, depending on the season. The owner is a really chill guy, but he seems have 1 person working ALL the tables sometimes (which gets chaotic during lunch rush, and customer service suffers).  I've noticed he's hired more staff lately, but I suspect its only seasonal. My note to him - Keep your location well-staffed :) 

I love their carrot dessert (gajar halwa), which is light years better than the sugary Gulab Jamun. They have a salad bar, which is decent.

My advice to readers - You better make sure you are leading an active lifestyle, if Indian Buffet is your goto for lunch. Although the food here is tasty delicious goodness, its not really good for your body :/ Authentic Indian food isn't this greasy or creamy, and most Indian people don't eat like this.

Because of the health implications of eating such loaded items, I tend to go there once every 2 weeks...maybe once a month.",lnupF_o5d3Cu4oZy9FyK9Q,0,0,4,B_cA0r_m28oyv9ZfhkCuhw

The lunch buffet I would give 8/10. Options were more than the typical Indian buffet I visit. They are generous with their meat portions, and quality as well. The dinner steps up the class a bit from lunch but with reasonable pricing still. Some may find the Indian TV music station playing in the background a bit distracting, but we found that it added to the ambiance. The food quality and spice complexity was improved over the lunch selection. The portions were large. We shared an order of momo(dumplings) and 2 entrees between 3 people and had leftovers.

Like previous reviewers, this place is owned by Nepalese. When you drive up it looks almost like it is dark, not open from the outside, but I think thats because of the glare stuff they have on the windows for the heat during the day time.
The service was great.
We ordered a vegetarian Thali and I ordered the Mt. Everest Thali, which came with lamb, tandoori chicken and butter chicken, along with the vegeterian options.
Normally at other indian restaurants I never get appetizers with the Thali. This came with the usual Paperdums, which had both mint chutney and tamarind chutney, which was made fresh you could tell.  In addition to that we got pakoras, fried califlower, and appetizers size chicken pieces and lamb.
Ours came with dessert. Rice pudding and Gulab Jamman. The best we have had thus far. The Gulab was nice and firm and the syrup was thick not watery like I normally have experienced. 
We also ordered chai. It came in a big 32 oz cup, like a take-way, and was made fresh because it was pipping hot. My boyfriend wanted to go back the next day just for the tea!
Highly highly recommend this, especiallyif you know your indian food, much better than Tamba on the Strip.",r-yz9OAIi9FQ614RCg6_lg,0,0,5,D8PY_U0i56YSDSeN2UGOhw

Everest was recommended by my Indian doctor (not for health reasons) and it is everything for which I could have hoped. You can expect all the usual fare prepared well and to order. I am vegetarian and my girlfriend is vegan. We were guided through the menu very kindly to support our dietary needs and a couple dishes were altered to further that cause. Can't wait to return. 

#2-Wonderful food and they really work hard to make things right. My girlfriend is vegan and ""assumed"" the vegetarian dishes were vegan. Nope. Many of those contain yogurt or are served with a dollop of butter. The owner quickly took care of this and made something special that was completely vegan.

My Everest at 29,028 feet is the highest mountain on earth and one of the most beautiful sights and wonders of the world. Lucky to have flown over it in 1998 and taken some priceless videos and photos. 

 Wednesday September 20, 2017 Las Vegas, Nevada got a similar rush and thrill as I had an amazing lunch at Mt Everest Indian restaurant on W Sahara Ave:

1) Tasty, wholesome, lovely food prepared and served with a lot of love. The brown lentils and kidney beans were to die for. The potatoes and cauliflower dish was done just right and the flavors were so distinct and unique. The garlic naan bread was probably the best I have ever had. It was hot, fresh and had that lovely garlic that just stimulates your taste buds. Big smile!! The raita or yogurt with diced cucumbers, tomatoes, onions and spices was the best I have ever had. It was cool and not creamy and lumpy. Bigger smile.

2) Beautiful staff who were so caring, proactive and warm. Lunch hour was packed and they sure kept the flow going with grace and class. Loved meeting the very sweet Nepalese chef in his awesome Nepalese hat( or Bhadgaunle cap) who came out to check on the items and wished me with a great smile.

3) $10.90 for an AYCE featuring 6 non vegetarian items, 5 excellent and ample vegetarian options, a great and fresh salad and pickle bar plus multiple v good desserts and fruit is beyond sweet.

4) Perfect getaway from the strip. It is almost 2 miles west of the casinos and  I-15 on Sahara Ave and Valley View with no crazy traffic and loads of parking.

5) Clean place! The staff is on top of the buffet. 

6) Clean, air conditioned and stocked rest room.

This was perfect. My review is the 1092nd review of this wonderful restaurant. I concur, I loved Mt Everest!!",NdvDnzlmNNywx4g286-Hbw,15,14,5,TGomwwU4O1rMBAkLSioicQ

1. The food is just so flavorful, Hot, Abundant, and authentic! (50% or more of the place is full of Indian people eating here... So it must be authentic...right?!)

2. They are on top of filling your water! 

3. It's only 10.99 for all you can eat! ALL YOU CAN EAT!!! Come ON!

The owner always recognizes me and I probably come once a month. Some times 2x a week. Or have a dry spell of 3months. It just hits the spot, when you need to get in some great good that is unlike anything else.

When my family came into town, they were craving Indian food.  As driving around the neighborhood, we happen to come across Mount Everest. This was my first trip to an Indian restaurant in Vegas since living here. Upon arriving, we were greeted with quick and prompt service. All the workers there were very kind, and quickly assisted us with whatever we needed.  We tried out their lunch buffet.  My family knew what they wanted to eat, I, on the other hand, was taking my time as to not knowing what I was eating nor I didn't know half of what the dishes were.  So, I kept it plain and simple and had the chicken tendoori, basmati rice, and also tried their stew.  All was good.  My family enjoyed each dish they got and loved every meal they ate.

I came back again the second time around this time with a friend.  We actually both enjoyed our meals.  I kept it simple again, ordering the usual, the tendoori chicken with basmati rice.  My friend ordered some chicken curry dish also with rice.  We both had the plain naan and it was very good.

1721266,2012-09-08,1,gTlDDzDEHyDQ6iwjNhpI6A,"Being Indian and all, I can cook Indian food fairly well, but I seek out Indian restaurant for the beautiful diversity of regional specialties that I just don't know how to cook or do not have the equipment to cook (eg. Tandoor oven). In the 3 years, that I lived here I have yet to find an Indian restaurant that blows me away, but Mt. Everest is one of the ""better"" ones. 

Came here on a Saturday night around 7:00 PM. Not the best looking place from the outside, but still hopeful this was a diamond in the rough. The parking lot was full however, surprisingly there were only two other tables filled. However, towards the end of our meal the restaurant filled out.  My husband and I got there before the other couple joining us (it is one of their favorite restaurants).  The staff immediately greeted and seated us.  We had a few moments to look around...decor is a bit dated with the dark green upholstery, but well kept.  We ordered a bottle of wine from the limited but reasonably priced popular wines.  Once the other couple arrived, they were immediately recognized as familiar faces by the staff.  

Prior to ordering we were served complimentary papadoms with the tradition mint and tamarind chutneys. We ordered Tandoori Chicken as an appetizer. This is a great value given there were atleast 8 pieces.  It came out sizzling hot, serve on a cast iron skillet.  I wanted to love it as its sight and sound captured my senses, but it was missing that aromatic smell.  That is right, it was not aromatic or flavorful...kind of bland for Tandoori, but nothing offensive and definitely well prepared.  Still worth getting, because it comes out fresh and sizzling, just spritz with lemon and sprinkle  salt it is more than fine.  

Shortly after our main dishes came out--palak paneer, chicken tikka, rogan josh, garlic naan, and a side kachumber salad.  First off, the portions were plentiful, and more than enough to feed four hearty adult appetites and two for lunch the next day.  The palak to the palak paneer makes that dish silky, creamy and very comforting, but could use a bit more spice although it was ordered at a level 6 on spice scale (1 to 10).  The chicken tikka was tasty and familiar in the sweet, tomatoey style...I prefer it slightly less sweet, but again, well made and worth trying.  The rogan josh's flavor was complexly layers and my favorite dish; it almost like my moms!  However, we ordered it at a level 10 spiciness, but it was much milder than expected.  Although I don't eat bread, according to my fellow dinners the garlic naan was fresh, warm and soft.   The kachumber salad was standard.  

Throughout our meal,  the manager/owner(?) kept checking to make sure we were satisfied and of course, asking if we wanted more wine once we finished the bottle we order.  He gave us generously filled glasses for $5, and we had a friendly conversation.  

Overall, the food was prepared with quality ingredients and with care, but lacked a bit of seasoning.  I haven't returned to many Indian restaurants in Vegas, but I am sure to return to Mt. Everest because the food is good, well priced, and the manager and staff is friendly... a special combination lacking in most Indian restaurants.",ejBGQeL177ECBqgMXe7sdg,1,1,4,fC1Qaxwv0G82WM7Vz34xBQ

Chicken tikka masala was a good size for the $13 price tag, which included the rice. Garlic naan was worth the upcharge: delicious, soft, and flavorful, with a garlic scent that wafted through my car as I drove home. 

My disappointment came when I finally tried my entree. For a spice level of 5, I tasted absolutely no spice. And the sauce had a sweetness to it that I am not familiar with. It wasn't necessarily bad, but the dish didn't have the kick to it I was craving. 
Chicken in dish was in large chunks, sauce was a smidge on the thin side.

When we went inside, it was nice and clean.  White table clothes on the tables and we were seated immediately by a nice man who turned out to be the owner.  The menu has plenty of selection and it was hard just settling on one thing for myself.  I had two other people with me and we ordered the garlic naan, chicken biryani, chicken tikka masala, and lamb curry.  I also wanted shrimp curry, but I thought it best to not let my eyes exceed my stomach.  Our food arrived quick enough and the portions were huge.  We all shared what everyone ordered, as that is how it arrives...typical of Indian cuisine establishments that I've been to.

The garlic naan was excellent and so was everything else.  We ordered the mild spice level on everything, mostly because of my wife.  I could have handled it a bit hotter, but I'm okay with mild.  Everything was excellent.  The chicken tikka masala was the biggest winner of the night and the best I've had anywhere.  It was seasoned perfectly.  The biryani was amazing, too, and I've only had better in one other place (Amber India in San Francisco).

When we were all stuffed, we still had leftovers.  Our drinks were always kept full and the staff and owner were very nice.  The owner offered us dessert but we were simply too full to eat any more.  He insisted and gave us some besan ladoo (I think that's what it's called) on the house!  They were very good.  We were impressed and appreciated the gratitude he showed us.

Don't let the neighborhood scare you. Only a lil sketchy. The food is spectacular!! Best Indian food we ever had. EVER. we tried the Mt Everest thali which was plenty of food for 2 big eaters. The naan is yummers- both plain and garlic. Even the lamb, which I'm pretty picky about was so tasty. Not gamey at all. Our favorite dishes: chicken tikka masala, saag paneer.

There's a reason Indian restaurant lunch buffets are so popular -- all the curry you can eat and lots of varieties.  Mt Everest knows it and does a great job with its buffet.  Options of vegetarian curry, lamb curry, chicken curry anchor the buffet offerings and they are all tasty, although a little lacking in spice (those looking to set the ""roof [of their mouth] on fire"" will be a little disappointed).  

What makes Mt Everest's buffet exceptional are the additional offerings -- delicious samosas, sweet sticky rice, soft basmati rice and free, warm, garlic naan on the table.  All of which makes this the best Indian buffet in town.",wOSHvuJEJflUEesNLno51A,2,1,4,LBsEtiMg4TMChwx9AlYTqg

Before making the long trek home, we knew we wanted to have our last meal in Vegas away from the mainstream, away from the crowds of new tourists and old cigarettes, so we went online and found Mt. Everest. Indian food is among our favorites, and my partner in crime has a lifelong relationship with Indian food in Los Angeles, so we were eager to sample food that was so highly rated. We were SO not disappointed!

We were immediately greeted by the warm smile of the owner, and the most incredible smells pouring out of the kitchen. The menu was fun to read, with engaging descriptions of what was in each dish, and I had a hard time choosing. We had samosas, Chicken Vindaloo, Lamb Korma and Lamb Biryani... Perfectly spiced, richly flavored and full of chunks of meat that melted beautifully in our mouths. The naan bread was so light and fluffy, I had to check to make sure I actually made it to my mouth. 

We could not finish our food (and, by the gods, we TRIED), so we carefully packed it up and hoarded it across the desert like we had the Queen's Jewels in the trunk...

The dal was over salted, the mystery curry that was yellow with unknown fried things in it was just salty peppery chewy fried things....kind of gross.

And best of all, fragrant, delectable Indian cuisine - at a $10.00 lunch buffet!

The disappointment of the non-working drive through window was completely forgotten once we experienced the excellent food.  It was so good that we kept embarrassing ourselves, ""mmm!  Mmmma!  Oh my gosh this is so GOOD!""  

Every dish was fresh, seasoned perfectly, not greasy, gamy or too salty.  Occasionally they even changed the food, putting out a completely different dish in place of something that was there before.

The naan was amazing.  I could go there just for the naan.  They offered more, but we had to say ""no thank you,"" because the rest of the food was so good.

The vegetarian dishes were at a separate warming table than the chicken dishes.  This speaks volumes for how they care for their customers, and I'm sure the vegetarian customers appreciate this.

The service was impeccable.  Our water glasses were kept full.  Even the water was good - no chlorine taste.  

They didn't bring a check so we paid on the way out.  But that might just be how they do it there, which is fine by us.  We gave the highest tip percentage that we give due to the fine service and quality of food.  We will definitely be back.  This is now officially our place for Indian food.

2250572,2010-08-10,1,gTlDDzDEHyDQ6iwjNhpI6A,"I never thought anyone could take the title away from Tamba on the Strip, but this is my favourite Indian restaurant, be it buffet or dinner, in Las Vegas.

I'm a vegetarian, so I can only comment on the meat-free dishes, although my husband the carnivore seems to end up using all of the same adjectives I do: subtle, complex, smooth, consistent, rich, plentiful, varied, fresh...

We've been visiting Mt. Everest since it opened over a year ago, but it was only last weekend that I got to try their Navratan Korma. A-ma-zing. Buttery, spicy, and not stingy at all with the paneer.

One thing I should confess is that I do love paneer dishes, save for that one most people love (sag paneer), so when I encounter an Indian buffet with only vegetable dishes, those vegetables better be pretty special to win me over. Mt. Everest is one of the few buffets where the vegetables are so tasty that I don't need a paneer offering to feel satisfied. (That said, Mt. Everest always has some sort of paneer dish, and when it's my nemesis sag paneer, they usually also have a kofta (dumpling) dish. Also, they always serve pakora, so I never lack for a ""hearty"" item on the plate.) I especially recommend their bombay aloo and any dal dish. One vegetable I've never seen at Mt. Everest is mushrooms, but otherwise the veg section is often a surprise.

Another point in Mt. Everest's favour, per my own tastes, is that they always offer samosas (small, light, pleasant) and vegetable pakora. Again, I like an Indian buffet that doesn't leave the more substantial offerings to the meat eaters. I also appreciate that the pakora is of the ""funny shapes"" variety, which I prefer to the greasier ""pressed patties"" you sometimes find elsewhere. (I'm looking at you, Bollywood and Samosa Factory.) The pakora tend to be small enough to not get overly dense, but - unlike my former fave Tamba - Mt. Everest never leaves you with tiny pakora ""droppings.""

The dessert selection is certainly smaller than on some other buffets - almost always a sweet rice and a type of rice pudding (the names escape me). They're both solid fare, but I seldom seem to save room, so it's a bit of a non-issue for me. (It's saying a lot when I can love a buffet that doesn't offer pappadums or gulab jamun.)

The naan is billowy and brought hot to the table. When we finish, we are always offered more. (Sometimes we are also often offered garlic naan, although after reading others' reviews that may just be a perk for the regulars. No worries - if you come here once, you too will be a regular soon enough.)

Most of my comments above pertain to the buffet. If you like the buffet, dinner at Mt. Everest will not only impress you, it may spoil you for all other Indian places in town. How can something so delicious for lunch be even better at dinner? Perhaps it's being able to get exactly the dish you want spiced just how you like, but somehow they exceed expectations with care that goes into individual dishes. I particularly recommend the shahi paneer. It is now the gold standard by which I measure all ""creamy + nutty"" sauces.

I realize this review is very gushy, so I'm racking my brain for some sort of flaw lest someone think I'm on the payroll. I could pick on the location - a former Burger King in the Mariana's supermarket parking lot - but you know what? It's so nice inside that you'll never notice. The decor is simple but comfortable and fastidiously clean. It's not an ultralounge. It's not a reimagining. It's just a restaurant with terrific food and the occasional Bollywood video playing on the corner television.

Service is always very friendly. You will never want for ice water, and the staff takes a genuine interest in how you are enjoying your meal. The only way they could make me happier is to offer cooking classes. (Please? Please?!) 


Oh, wait, I do have a criticism! Sometimes, I think the mattar paneer is just a teensy bit too full of peas... yeah, that's the best I can do. Sorry. Mt. Everest is simply rather wonderful In fact, it is the sort of restaurant for which Yelp should offer a sixth star. Mmmm...",l9YOhaPYvTJi_qfD3Y-wBQ,4,4,5,4U-8k4DPY9Q44tCfzmmKAA

I usually like to order off the menu at places like this but for some reason it seems like Indian places in Vegas prefer to do buffet only for lunch. After seeing a bunch of positive friends' reviews of this place we figured it was a fairly safe and solid choice

Given the time we arrived, I'd say the buffet was still fairly full since the lunch buffet ends at 3 pm, however, we never saw it refilled while we were there. On my first plate I tried a little bit of everything which meant I had a pretty full plate to work through. The stand outs were the curry chicken, tandoori chicken, and chili chicken, which had a little kick to it. The veggie samosa and sweet basmati rice were ok...and are probably an acquired taste. Fresh naan was brought to our table and it was warm and delicious! Not burnt, old, or cold like some other places. After the first plate I was already pretty full and just got seconds of the chicken dishes I liked.

We wanted to try their milky balls =P for dessert but they were all gone by the time we were done eating so we had to settle for the sweet rice pudding instead, which I believe is called kheer?

I was one of the first ones in that dinner time at the restaurant.  Checking this place out why they have Mount Everest all over he place.  Mmmm thinking to my self maybe they like that place. I knew it was part of China the big country but learning something new. It was also part of Nepal - a country just above India.

I had many question about the food they served and why it's not Indian Food. Finding out that Nepali's are very similar food of Indians but some of them look a bit Asians.  I asked the server and he told me that some food would just have a bit twist but other then that it's the same.  

I asked the server what's good to eat and he recommended me to try out a dish that had a varieties of different types of Nepali food. It was priced $$ right for the fact that you get a sampler first, 3 small dishes, pita bread, and rice.  After you think your done they ask what type of dessert you would like to eat and they have many different types of dessert that I never knew.  

When I was done they also had this different type of breath mint that cleaned your mouth.  Very different from American style were we just get a mint candy and tooth pick.  It was like a tea seeds with other types of seeds and they add a mint flavor and it works like the mint but I guess better.

2318022,2012-01-26,1,gTlDDzDEHyDQ6iwjNhpI6A,"Have eaten the lunch buffet here at least 15-18 times over the course of 3 years, and I must say that Mt. Everest is finally in it's prime. I immediately sensed a new chef 2 visits ago, and my guess was confirmed by the owner. The owner was visibly excited about the new chef's contributions, smiling and describing all of the new dishes. Tastewise and lookswise, the buffet has never been better. It costs $1 more than before, but it is worth it. 

The Sambar soup is perfectly seasoned, the new dishes (Chicken Chili, Vegetable Korma) are colorful and tasty, and the overall spice level is kicked up one notch closer to a straight-up medium. The Chicken Mahkani is masterful and complex - as good as some of the best Chicken Tikka Masala-type curry I've tasted. The Dal Mahkani is a 3 or 4-bean variety and is much improved over the previous chef's version. Great Samosas and Aloo Vegetable varieties. Very importantly, the buffet console is boiling hot so all of the food is steaming hot and remains hot on your plate several minutes after you sit down at your table. This is a huge detail that can make or break an Indian buffet. Mt. Everest nails it - keep it up! 

Business seems better than ever, which is a good sign that I'm not the only one who feels like this food has gotten really good. Typical to an Indian lunch buffet, the fresh-baked naan and roti are complimentary, but the whole wheat roti is especially good here - one would expect it to come out traditionally thin and flat, but the Mt. Everest version can be mistaken for a puffy naan bread - a nice surprise. Whole wheat roti has taken the place of white basmati rice in my Indian lunch diet.

Buffet plates and bowls are clean and shiny. Water glasses are refilled constantly, every single visit. Finished plates are picked up quickly. Overall service is great. My only warning is you may smell like Indian food for the rest of the afternoon, so if you are on your way to an important meeting in a small office space, maybe bring a change of clothing if you are self-conscious about that kind of thing. I guess this is proof that when you eat the lunch buffet at Mt. Everest, you are immersed in a cauldron of Indian deliciousness.

Go now and get it while it's hot! I've waited this long to write a review because if I really care about a place I want to make sure it's right before friends go try it for the first time. (see my Cravin' Cajun review).",W1AFbtC37Q1RzdrKS51NmQ,4,2,5,ztLy1zw9Rc7ADJIP5CUoNQ

Of course, since we were there for lunch - we got the buffet.

Well, wow.  I have been back like, 7 times in the past month since that initial visit.  It is by far my favorite Indian lunch buffet place.  I had 3 in the running but Mt Everest is on top.  First, the price.  I believe it is 10.99... not bad.  Second, the choices.  It has the most choices I've seen!  What could make this place better?  If their labels were more specific.  I love the way some buffets put ""vegetarian""; as a 75% vegetarian I like a quick reference guide to vegetarian options.  But... with my minor knowledge of Indian food I know what most of their dishes are.  If it were my first exposure to Indian food, however, I would be S.O.L!

Also another thing they could make better.  Their naan.  I don't like their naan.  I like buttery, garlicy soft guusy naan.  This is not my favorite place for naan (Saffron is).  If you like medium-textured, little buttered, barely garlic-ed naan then you would like it.  Other than that, it's so good!   Their choices are amazing.

Final thing (this is the Nutrition student in me):  They are so sanitary!  One of the only Indian buffets I've seen with in-place ""sneeze guards"" on their buffet.  Their buffet is actually buffet style so it has the coverings.  Furthermore, their bathroom has a sanitary spray above the handle.  How great!  So even if nasties don't wash their hands, I won't get their germs from when they open the bathroom door open.  Foodborne illness is no joke, yo.

The oil from the veg noodles dripped out in the plastic and the chicken biryani was palatable.. Barely.

The had a perfect crisp on the outside and beautifully seasoned potato filling inside. Then for our entrees, I ordered Lamb Vindaloo and my wife ordered Chicken Kurma, and we both ordered garic naan to go with it. (Unlike many other Indian restaurants in town, Mt.

Wow, I was a little surprised.   I had heard so many good things.  Perhaps this was just an ""off"" day for their lunch buffet.

Let me explain that we were not treated badly, we were just ignored for the most part.  I tried almost everything on the buffet and I enjoy eating Indian food and was looking forward to lunch here since the day before since I had never been.

That said... 

I have been to several different Indian places here in town and after reading other reviews I didn't know exactly what to expect.

The service was barely there and the lunch buffet (about an hour and a half into service) was messy.  The steam table was occasionally being ""refilled"" instead of changed out.  At least, theoretically, the food that was there at the beginning would only last till the end of the lunch hours. There were a few other cleanliness issues but I'll leave it at that.  

The tap water served in the cloudy glass could not be overlooked. 

The items on the lunch buffet itself, some overcooked, were just okay at best.  Other items bear only slight resemblance to the preparations I've had at other Indian places.  I really do enjoy Indian food and I really went into this WANTING to like this place.   

There are a lot of Indian lunch buffets in Las Vegas and if you have the means to go to a different one... *sigh* ...go.",lL-wNa0TKK6LXrlcVmjYrQ,3,1,1,98polbDyymdeMOZfi01AJQ

everything that was served here is literally made with a heavy hand of authentic Indian spices with traditional cooking methods.

The chicken tikka masala is perfectly creamy filled with chunks of juicy chicken that give a strong beautiful punch to excite your taste-buds. The meat to sauce ratio is great, you literally have meat in every bite.

Palaak Paneer is thick and creamy filled with slightly crisp chunks of paneer to accompany every spicy bite. I know a lot of places have issues with over and under salting this dish but honest this is probably the best i have had in a long time.

Vegetable Korma had a yogurt taste to is making it super delicious. I really enjoyed how the curry for this was not too tomatoey in taste but more of a orchestra of flavors each playing there part.

The naan is hot and fresh offering garlic and regular.

Chicken Tikka masala was bland and watery.

The price is right, at $10.99 per person. I also like how the lunch buffet is served every day from 11am - 3pm, which allows me enough time to catch up on my beauty rest on the weekends.

To my surprise, it was above average, very enjoyable; but mind you, not out of this world mind blowing. Plus, a small ounce of hatred flowed through me when I found out that they no longer served garlic naan for the lunch buffet...Man! I was really looking forward to that! 

I appreciated their authenticity in the spice department. Whew! They don't mess around. Some of the items on the buffet such as the veggie samosas and the malai kofta, had some shocking heat and I loved it! I didn't care for every dish they had available on the buffet - Some were too starchy or dry, but no worries, there were more than enough options to get me stuffed silly. 

Here are my favorites! 
- Fresh Baked Garlic Naan Bread - they were on top of refilling our basket and making sure we had hot, crispy, fluffy and fresh naan throughout our meal.
- Sweet Rice (basmati rice sweetened with honey) - It had a very faint sweetness and flavor of honey, plus I loved the color!
- Saag Paneer - The cheese curds were a little on the overcooked and hard side, but the spinach curry was very deep and flavorful. 
- Malai Kofta - It was interestingly sweet and packed full with flavorful spices, I loved the spicy kick it had. I really enjoyed dunking my naan in this one. 
- Chicken Tikka Masala - The curry flavor was rather weak on this one, but it was very rich and creamy. The chicken was very tender as well. 
- Tandoori Chicken - The chicken was tender and moist. 
- Veggie Samosa - Spicy city! I loved the unexpected spices that came through in each bite. It woke my taste buds up! 
- Mint and Tamarind Chutney - Refreshing and sweet. They both paired perfectly with all of the dishes and the naan. I especially enjoyed them with the samosa and the spicy curries! 
- Raita - Very refreshing and cooling for the heavy and spicy curries. 
- Rice Pudding - We loved the sweetness and the consistency with this rice pudding.

I'll Pass: 
- Pakora - very dry
- Aloo Baingan (eggplant and potato) - wasn't too flavorful or memorable. 
- Curry Chicken - boring flavor
- Chili Chicken - dried out
- Yellow Dal - too thick and flavor was not exciting 
- Chana Masala - not memorable on the spices and flavor 
- There were many other buffet items that just didn't stand out to me.

After our lunch I had a minor stomach ache - but I'll blame that on my hangover and all that alcohol that was in my belly. Tsk tsk naughty.",u_wqt9RshdZsoj8ikLqoEQ,12,10,4,sRg7smqg1zRrQ7oZy-gBgQ

This place was really great. The flavors were great and very fresh. I agree with all the reviews. I do think the service was a bit slow. It seemed the hostess was also taking orders and closing tickets.  We had a show to go to so we literally had to take the check up to the register to pay our bill.

We arrived for the lunch buffet  which runs from 11 to 3pm for $10.99 per person.   They also serve dinner from 5 to 10pm.  For me, a buffet is the best way to experience food you are not familiar with.  Trying to guess what will look and taste good by reading a menu can be next to impossible.   

I thought the Everest crew did a great job during my visit today.  The staff was efficient and friendly and it looked like only two people running the front of house of 30 tables or so.   The food selection was a good variety of one side that had all vegetarian options and another with meat offerings.   They featured about 12 different menu items including basmati rice, tandoori chicken, chicken Tikka masala, lentils, and one of my favorites was the pancake like balls soaked in syrup.   All of the offerings were hot and flavorful.   Once again a good reason to experience the buffet is because the food always comes out fresh, hot and often when you have a full restaurant. 

Once we were seated the server brought out a fresh basket of Naan bread.  So happy they brought this to the table the bread was hot and had a perfect char on the exterior for extra flavor. Yum! Speaking to server on the way out he said they change some of the buffet offerings daily so you might have a different experience each visit.

2690128,2016-09-21,2,gTlDDzDEHyDQ6iwjNhpI6A,"NOTE: Mt. Everest is the tallest Mountain in the world and it's in Nepal. When you enter this restaurant it's clear that it is Nepali with the Buddhist prayer flags, photos of Nepal, and the drape of Swayambunath temple image of Buddha's eyes hung up on one of the walls. Although, many of the dishes are Indian and the lunch buffet has many Indian dishes, a significant portion of the restaurant's menu is pure Nepali food. Being a Nepali, it's disappointing that the restaurant needs to be advertised at 100% Indian to retain and bring business. I just wish customers would recognize that it's both Nepali and Indian. They are two different countries with similar cuisines. 

Anyway, hope some readers found that educational! 

Now for the FOOD! As a lover of Nepali and Indian food, this restaurant is top notch. Definitely one of the best I've been to the in the United States. It rivals restaurants in Queens, New York which probably has the highest density of Nepali restaurants anywhere in the states. My partner actually thinks its even better than our favorite place out there. 

We came here twice in two weeks when we were in Vegas for rest stops during our epic road trip. We both focused on entirely on the Nepali food side which is on the left. Their chicken chilly is AMAZING - so on point with the flavor. Perfect amount of onions, bell peppers, and loaded with tender and fresh chicken. 

Their goat meat is as good as my mama makes it,  especially the gravy. A lot of Nepali restaurants tend to under cook or have really tough pieces of goat meat, but everything is so tender here, it's incredible! Chicken curry also absolutely delicious. The second time we were there, they had toor daal, so I had a traditional plate of dal, rice, meats, and vegetables and even ate with my right hand. The very traditional way of enjoying Nepali cuisine to the max! 

Also, my partner and I bought a bunch of orders of Nepali momos to go, which they have on their menu outside of the lunch buffet. Simply delicious. So authentic. Loaded with tasty meat filling! Loved having it later at our leisure. 

I also tried all their Indian dishes and they're just as amazing. I especially like the vegetarian kofta. Each dish is perfect. I typically find that restaurant's that have both selections master one or the other. Mt Everest is a slam dunk at South Asian cuisine. 

Whether you live in Vegas or are stopping through as a tourist, get your behind off the strip and come here for amazing Nepali and Indian food.",HS1xj2PfkdhkmQaW6hJXqQ,8,4,5,c3ZfNe4D87N5rqSenw_V5g

And this dish comes with potatoes and a assortment of flavors. The sauce was tomato based and creamy. It came with rice, and if I could, I would eat it all day.

I really like the strong and bold flavors of Indian cuisine, and also the quality of the sauces, which tend to be very smooth, with supporting notes of texture like cashew or other items to provide some 'tooth' to a dish.  I found the sauces here to be very heavy, a bit 'gloppy' and just lacking in quality - the sauces just weren't inviting to me.  Actual taste of the sauces was ok - serviceable, but nothing great.  

Also, lamb was pretty tough, and chicken had small bones (the kinds that should not be in a dish, small enough to catch in one's throat and cartiledge - just unappetizing.  Paneer dish we had was one of the better items, but sauce still had that heavy and unpleasant texture.

Flash forward to today, and that is still pretty much what I eat when I go for Indian. 
We have only been to the buffet, so I can only base my review on the lunchtime offerings. I highly suggest that as you are being seated, you ask for garlic naan, if that is what you want. I stress, WHILE you are being seated. They are fast at this location and you will end up with plain naan if you don't speak quickly. They encourage you to start right away and your water will be waiting for you when you bring your first plate to your table. The naan will quickly follow. The samosa is vegetarian, along with a few other dishes. I have only had samosa, dal, rice, tandoori chicken, garlic naan, yogurt mixture and kheer. They are delicious. The only thing I would like to see is plain yogurt. I am not fond of the yogurt mixture, but I eat it because I cannot imagine eating  Indian food without yogurt... naan and/or roti. My man loves this place so much that he does not want to go back to Mint. I think Mint is good, but have had a plate get cold while I waited for my naan.
The staff is pleasant and the place is small, but has air conditioning.

When I pulled up I was surprised to see a drive thru but then I realized it was closed and the employees were using it to park their cars. Upon walking into the restaurant, I noticed the buffet in the back corner looking sad and unsanitary. I sat down and shortly after we were brought out the papadum and were asked what we wanted to order. The papadum and sauces just weren't good and to top things off the basket it was in was not cleaned. I shouldn't have overlooked this but I did because I was craving Indian food. I ordered two mango lassi's, garlic naan, malai kofta, chicken makhani their speciality, and basmati rice. The mango lassi's were brought out instantly. This one was not made well, was overly sweet, tasted artificial, and was not thick enough. I was able to stomach mine but my dining partner wanted to send hers back. I asked the Asian man if we could send it back and he giggled and said no. Then our Indian waiter comes over laughs and says Mango Lassi's our supposed to be sweet and I said I know I have had my a Mango Lassi before but but this overly sweet, he begrudgingly took it back. 

Our entrees come and the portions are huge. Both of the curries had that artificial taste and reminded me of curry at a food court. The chicken in the chicken makhani was dry and the fat was not trimmed off properly. The veggie balls in the malai kofta were extremely hard on the outside and not very moist on the inside. The garlic naan was tasty but once again it was brought out in a basket that was not clean.

3248235,2009-11-29,1,gTlDDzDEHyDQ6iwjNhpI6A,"When I saw Mt Everest getting ready to open I was initially a little put off by the locale - in a defunct Burger King building, next to a gas station, in a grotty parking lot outside Marianna's Mexican Supermarket on West Sahara. 

Eventually we tried the extremely reasonably priced lunch buffet for $8.95 and were immediately blown away by the quality and variety of food here. I am a meat eater and my wife is a vegatarian, but there is so much for both of us. 

The Chicken Makhani and Chicken Tikka Masala (these two rotate so you will get either one of the other) are both wonderful and there's always a few delicious vegetable dishes that are cooked and seasoned to perfection. Vegetables that I would never consider eating elsewhere are somehow transformed into pure delights.

Also excellent is the selection of pakora and the large, delicious Samosas (I usually manage to polish off three of these).

Freshly cooked naan (so fresh you almost burn your hands if you aren't careful) is so good you could make a meal out of it and some of the sauce from the buffet alone. Our hosts usually offer us our choice of plain or garlic naan - or even both. They are eager to please their customers here at Mt Everest.

Quite often I can tell when an Indian restaurant is going to be good by the number of Indian people eating there - Mt Everest attracts a diverse mix of clientele, yet does not fall into the trap of becoming too westernised.
If I have one small criticism it is that Gulab Jamun (a personal favourite) never seems to appear as the dessert on the buffet, but this is an extremely minor complaint.

The dinner menu is extensive with as many as ten options for each base type of food (veg, chicken, lamb etc). At dinner you get a free serve of papadums along with well priced servings that were a good 30% cheaper than in some of the local competitor restaurants and possible TWICE the size - Extremely good value and the dinner time Butter Chicken could be the best I have ever tasted.

Note: You might want to look over all 1 star reviews of Mount Everest (and for that matter, all Vegas Indian restaurants) with a critical eye. You'll notice they are often from people who have written no other real reviews. I strongly suspect there's some ""review wars"" going on between different establishments. You'll notice they will always claim that staff are ""rude, disrespectful, etc"" - There isn't an Indian restaurant in Vegas I have been to where the staff have been anything short of gracious to the point of humble and Mt Everest is no exception.

Lamb samosas- Too dry. 
Chicken Tikka Masala- Not the most flavorful masala we've had. Felt like something was missing. 
Lamb Curry- This was my favorite dish. The lamb was super tender, and the curry sauce was savory with the right amount of spice.

Being in Vegas, almost every restaurant seems to have a good number of reviews and that fact deceived us. The people who dined here and gave these good reviews seem to not have tried authentic Indian food and thereby this restaurant ended up having a 4.5 rating with 1200+ reviews which paints a completely wrong picture altogether.

When we arrived, there was a little wait time. The lunch buffet had some really mediocre dishes. Even the choice of dishes seemed pretty boring and everyday like. When you go to an Indian buffet, you expect some lavish dishes, but here you won't! Tandoori Chicken and Fish Fry were overloaded with red food color and were both bone-dry and no flavor. Awful! How can they mess up a Samosa? I can go on talking about how bad every individual dish was but it is only going to sound redundant because everything was so below par.

3400238,2013-07-02,0,gTlDDzDEHyDQ6iwjNhpI6A,"We decided to try this place based on it's pretty consistent Yelp reviews, and we're glad we did. A few reviewers have mentioned the sketchy surroundings, but I say if you can throw some carpet, a few tablecloths, and the drapes from an old bordello into a defunct Burger King and come up with a perfectly comfortable dining room, more power to ya! 
I have loved Indian food since I first discovered it during a brief sojourn in London, when it seemed that the only options were steak and kidney pie or starving to death. (I chose the latter. Valar Morghulis)! Anyway, as a person who considers curry to be more of a drug than a food, I'm usually prepared to like what I get in Indian restaurants, which is a little meat floating in a sea of delicious sauce which you happily sop up with some fluffy, toasty naan, and fill up on the rice.(I'm getting hungry again just thinking about it). The difference here was that there was plenty of tender, juicy meat in that sauce; apparently a side benefit of keeping the rent low. Hope they don't get too big for their britches and move to Summerlin. Goodbye, meat! 
I adore Chicken Korma and theirs was perfect; rich creamy sauce with just a little sweetness and those complex, spicy undertones that keep you coming back for more bites long after you're full. Chicken Tikka and tandoori were both served sizzling and still moist and juicy. The favorite appetizer, in a unanimous vote, was the lamb samosas. They were golden little pockets of pastry stuffed with seasoned, finely ground lamb, but the best thing was what wasn't there: My sister didn't find a hard thing. Mind you, if there is ground meat involved, be it burgers, sausage, meatballs, whatever, she ALWAYS gets the hard thing, and the rest of us have to suffer along with her. It's one of life's little miracles that she didn't, and practically worth a sixth star.
Will definitely return to try the lunch buffet, but don't be surprised if they raise the price after our visit.",-qj9ouN0bzMXz1vfEslG-A,2,1,5,Tjr24RlhiImxrf7fPEyjdw

You can smell the aroma of the spices... so good.  You'll see/smell what I mean when you walk in.  We went for dinner.  Because I had ""just a taste"" of Chicken Korma from another restaurant, I had to try it at the next Indian restaurant I went to. We also ordered the Goat Curry, the Chicken Biriyani (Rice), and Garlic Naan.  We ordered the Korma and Curry in mild.  

Once we got our food I went straight for the Naan to dip into the Chicken Korma sauce to get a feel for the spice level.  Some places you order mild and they give you extra spicy.  So for me my first thought was ""oh, this isn't bad, it isn't spicy at all, maybe we should have gotten a level up.""  Then I took a bite of the chicken by itself and it was nice and tender... and then it came, the flavor of the spice kicked in and magic happened.  The spice level was perfect to my liking.  I took the sauce of the Chicken Korma and spread it on the Garlic Naan as if it were jelly on a piece of toast and that there was magic in my mouth.  After you bit into that, there's a hint of sweetness and it's amazing.  

As for the Goat Curry, I love the meat itself.  I wish we had a lot of meat that came with it.  Because the Chicken Korma sauce was awesome, I wished the Goat came in that sauce instead.  But the Goat Curry was still good. The Chicken Biriyani too was full of flavor and awesome. But to my liking, I would have taken out the raisins and the nuts.  That's just me tho. I'm not a fan of fruits in my entree.  And the Garlic Naan was delish!  So good that we ordered more to go!  This place just became my favorite Indian restaurant hands down.

I am a fuge fan of Indian curry.
I found this restraint from YELP
and decided to come MT indian's cuisine.

We arrived and asked a table in the corner.
It was packed.
First, the best boy prepared table for us forks and knives etc..
He was holding our knives from the sharp part( where we cut the meat) with his hand.
And  instead of putting them on the table nicely, he actually throw the forks and knives on the table.
Napkins and forks knives spoon  all were soppy on the table.
It was completely unprofessional service.
But it looked he didn't mean doing it.
so we accepted it.

Waiters were friendly, they talked to my kids friendly too.It was nice!!

We ordered a chicken curry, tandoori chicken  and samosa.
The Curry and samosas were very good!
Actually it was really good.we really enjoyed it.
But tandri chicken was so so.
It wasn't look fresh to me.
While we were eating , my husband found little cockroach walking on the wall.
I was scared but we tried to tell the waiter quietly.
My husband said ""Now, I saw cockroach on the wall.
Here you see?""
He looked it and he said with not surprising face ""it is hot in here so.."" 
Soooo????
He crushed the cockroach with the curtain on the wall.
He didn't wipe and he was just said sorry there is hole in the corner so""
Sooo?
I asked ""Hole?""
then he smiled and said ""no, no, it is not big hole  small hole we gonna fix tomorrow""

as we already ordered chai so we had to drink.
We still tried to enjoy the chai but it was so so taste.
And I checked the window glass but  there were  any cockroaches but I noticed the window glass looked so oily.
I Also noticed the window counter was dusty.
The Waiter brought free rice pudding.
Actually it was good.
My kids loved it.
While drinking tea, I was remembering and thinking that 
""When I arrived this restraint, I first checked the bathroom it was not dirty so we decided to eat here.
But actually I was so wrong...""

...And I came back to the reality from the thinking

And... I saw something moving in my eyesight.Something brown at my napkin on the table witch I wiped my mouth with.
Yes, it was another Mr. Cockroach.
I was surprised and screamed little big voice.
Because Because ... I didn't expected a roach on my table.
But with my screaming, No One other table were  looking at me except one couple next to us. The man asked me with serious face 
"" what was that ?!!""
I told him quietly ""I saw a cockroach"".
And He said "" I knew it I thought I have seen one too and starting to check around his  table.

While we were talking with the man , Mr roach went to on the floor .
The waiter came and asked"" Is everything ok?""
I told him about Mr roach was on my napkin.
The waiter saw it and stepping on it with his shoe and said sorry to us.

Wow.what a experience!!!
They billed 45 dollars and we put 5 dollar tips.
We had worst  experience and for sure this is the last time to eat this restraint.
I am writing it because I hope every restraint owner are honest.
I know some restraint owners are really honest and loving their job hospitality and respectful to customers.And hard worker, clean job and good foods.
My questioning is why 600 people are giving 4.5 stars???

I was craving Indian food so decided to check out this place for their lunch buffet. The interior is a bit worn, but it is clean and the workers are all very friendly.

There were a decent amount of dishes in the buffet, but not all that many to be honest. All of the food was tasty, and there was a good variety. Chilli chicken made an appearance again, and I'm starting to think this Indo-Chinese dish is a Las Vegas Indian buffet staple. While chilli chicken is indeed a very popular Indo-Chinese dish, I never saw it in Indian buffets when I lived in California or in Virginia. 

The meal comes with freshly baked naan, and there is no surcharge if you want garlic naan, though it does take a little longer to prepare and you have to ask for it. Water is included and served in cute mason jars, and the servers were pretty diligent about refilling waters and clearing used plates.

Overall, at $10.99 for a lunch buffet, Mount Everest is a good value and has decent food. It is not the best Indian buffet I've ever had, and nothing particularly wowed me or stood out, but it is a solid restaurant for sure.

P.S. I find it ironic that the restaurant is called Mount Everest India's Cuisine even though Mount Everest is located in Nepal. xD",lQCY0csLfjdDn6cdVq43UA,0,0,4,rYk6POUNayLF7tN6mMrg9A

3459581,2010-08-17,1,gTlDDzDEHyDQ6iwjNhpI6A,"What's up with me? 2 Indian buffets in 4 days. That must be a first for me. I don't think I've been to one for six months prior to this. My craving for the Indian buffet had not been satiated by my visit to Mint and so I was determined to have a good experience today. 

After extensive research on Yelp I decided to try Mt. Everest. A co-worker of mine agreed to join me (ditching his diet) thanks to the fact that Shari S had described the Naans here as being ""billowy."" We made the long 10 mile trudge to Mt Everest from the office. 

This buffet is seriously amazing. For a little tiny place charging 8.99 per person, it seriously hit every craving and made us happy campers. There is an extensive vegetarian selection in the buffet: soft Basmati rice with peas, Palak Paneer, Punjabi Kadi, Malai Kofta, Dhal, Cauliflower and Potato Stirfry, Sambar, Idly, Samosas, Pakoras and a myriad of chutneys, yogurt, salad and dips. I have only good things to say about every single dish on the buffet. Tasted good and the ingredients were all fresh. Indian buffets frequently omit primo dishes like Paneer (indian cottage cheese cubes), Kofta (indian dumplings in gravy), Samosas and fresh (not frozen) veggies in their food. Mt. Everest did no such thing...they spared no expense and made this buffet experience fantastic. 

My co-worker who eats meat couldn't stop raving about the creamy Chicken Makhani, Lamb Curry and the Samosas (he went pretty crazy with all the chutneys). 

And yes, the garlic naans that came with the buffet (we asked for garlic) were billowy. And extremely tasty. 

My only gripe with Mt. Everest is the dessert selection. They had sweet rice...which really is a cop-out dessert. But I settled for their fresh fruit selection (oranges and watermelon). I would give these guys a 4.5 stars (taking off a half star for the dessert) but since I can't on Yelp, they get a four. Next time, if they serve Gulab Jamun I will be more than happy to up it to a no-questions asked 5 star review.

It's truly heartwarming to see an Indian buffet keep it's quality consistent even after being open a while. Mt. Everest really did warm my heart and brought back some of my lost hope in the Indian buffet genre in Las Vegas.

The garlic naan is a MUST. And I recommend it with some plain yogurt on the side! For main courses I really love the lamb (or vegetable) korma and the chicken tiki masala. I get both on medium (5) level and it still has a good amount of spice!! I'd say those two sauces are my favorites since I've tried others that are not as memorable to me. I don't love the chicken tikka but probably only because I'm a big sauce girl! I also really enjoy the okra vegetable dish! Full of flavor!

Though the talk of slow service is true I'd say the food is too good to pass up and don't mind the service. I also like to finish my meal with a chai tea at the end.

Usually at an indian buffet there are at least 2 items that get left on my plate...Not here, the only thing I didn't care for was the potato samosas, and that's strictly due to the too thick, not crispy pastry surrounding the well spiced potato filling. The butter chicken was good,made with a mix of white and dark meat,and had a nice deep flavor throughout the chicken and sauce.  The paneer palak was wonderful and flavorful with a kick of chilies, My partner in crime enjoyed the veggie Korma greatly, as did I, it was creamy, with well rounded flavors and tasted very unique compared to other veggie kormas I've had. Heck it put mine to shame! They didn't shy away from spice or heat as some indian places do to adapt to American palates and I dig them for it.

This called for a visit that was long overdue, so we scrolled down the list and picked the highest rated place in town which was Mt. Everest. At $10.99 for a lunch buffet of a pretty good spread that would please just about any palate:

Basmati and Sweet Rice, Jhukuni Aloo, Vegetable Samosas, Punjabi Kadi, Palak Paneer, Mattar Paneer, Gajar Halwa, Chicken Curry, Goat Curry, Chili Chicken, Chicken Makhani, Tandoori Chicken, Salad Bar, Assorted Chutneys, Naan, and Rice Pudding. I tried every offering once, then went back for seconds and thirds of my favorites, the sweet rice, goat curry, punjabi kadi, and both paneer dishes. Honestly one of the best lunch deals in town.

Service was great, water glasses and our naan basket was replenished quickly, and you can watch and listen to some Bollywood action while enjoying your meal. Looking forward to returning, and this time, no need to wait for that blue moon!.....ALOHA!!!

I ordered lamb biriyani, keema, plain rice and garlic naan. Everything was amazing! It was far too much for me alone but I like to take leftovers home for the next few days. The biriyani was particularly flavorful and with lots of meat which is lovely! It's really hard to find keema in the USA at restaurants and this was a treat for me so I added as an extra...

It was shocking to see it had a drive thru window and the neighborhood is a bit sketchy but not scary. Once inside it was very small, dark and stuffy warm. We all three had the buffet and it was about 12:45 when we arrived so you'd think it would be well stocked. The chicken korma was all sauce, no chicken to be seen and of the rest of the dishes, some were sparse, some were old looking with sauces separated and the Tandoori chicken was only dark meat and not nearly crispy enough on the outside nor cooked well enough for me inside. The samosas were cold & too doughy and I didn't like the rice being sweet, I prefer savory with veggies in it. The chili chicken was tasty but also very greasy and the vegetable korma was good and I enjoyed the spiciness of the food, it packed a heat punch. Naan was just okay, I would have ordered garlic naan if given a choice but service was sluggish and we were fairly ignored. My daughter needed water since all of us had empty water glasses and no one refilling so I got up and poured all of us a glass of water from pitchers they had sitting nearby.

I've been a regular  here since my kids were 4 and 6 yrs old and now they are 6 and 8 yrs old. The problem I have is this, they don't tell you much kids pay for buffet. In the past I've only paid half so I thought that's okay,  when I came here this weekend I paid full price for both of my kids even though they did not eat as much as me and my wife and so I wondered. Any other buffet restaurants in Vegas they would have paid half price, since they are just kids. Most restaurants (casino or not) based their pricing on children's age, if your kid is over 11 or 12 they pay full and so on and so forth. I asked the guy who took my payment on why my kids pay full price when they are 6 and 8. He told me they based the price on how much a kid should pay based on much they eat, I say what??That is ridiculous, what if my kid is not a big eater, how can they assess this, by putting their plate on a weighing scale? I feel like I was scammed and for that this restaurant just lost a long time and loyal customer. It's misleading, I might even think of bringing a complain to BBB. Going somewhere else next time, for everyone else please be warn, if you bring your kids you don't know how much you will be paying.

3876137,2014-04-27,1,gTlDDzDEHyDQ6iwjNhpI6A,"Of all the Indian places in Vegas... this is a frequent stop for me! I am pretty stuffed and satisfied everytime after dining here.  The restaurant seems like a family owned business and the customer service is wonderful!! They are super nice, friendly, and seem easy to get their attention if you need anything. There's also a TV playing in the corner with current Indian movies with plenty of bollywood dancing and hip current Indian music.  

The usual dishes we order are: 
 - appetizers: vegetable pakora and samosas, thinly spiced cracker (don't know the name of it - sorry)
 - main dishes : tandoori chicken, palak paneer, chicken korma, chicken makhani, lamb curry (rogan josh)
 - sides: garlic naan and rice

The appetizers are very tasty and a good size that come with a mint jutney sauce and a spicier sauce.  All the main dishes are very good also.  Warning though, if you ask for spicy... these dishes can definately make you sweat like a banshsee!! just ask my bf!! I like them milder and ask for mild or a level ""3"" and they are delish.  Maybe ""5"" or higher will be too spicy and possibly not enjoyable... but up to one's palate.  The tandoori chicken comes out on a sizzling plate and the chicken is so tender and tasty, always a safe bet.  The chicken makhani (butter chicken) is my absolute favorite! The korma and curry are pretty rich in spices and have very distinct flavors to the dishes.  I think the palak paneer is alright but reminds me more of creamed spinach - so maybe a pass.  

This place is small and cozy but usually hopping with customers.  The food may come out a bit slower when they are busy but it's worth the wait.  Always happy with the food and service here that makes me keep coming back for my Indian food fix!!  I really need to come for the lunch buffet which looks like a great deal for the same food.",B3b42NmqmcuGgFzOoYuRCg,4,3,4,tG926oWbm8m597xdkP8GKA

If my life is a buffet I hope it's just like this place - cheap quality food!

So, I'm not a huge fan of Indian food. Well that's kind of an unfair statement because it was only my second time trying it. We got here about 1:30 on a Tuesday and it was pretty full which is a pretty good sign.

They bring the naan to the table and who doesn't love a basket full of naan- if you don't, then I probably don't wanna know you because it's a basket of heaven. So please move on from my review. They have a good variety of food, which is fantastic when you're trying to find out what kind of food you like! I wasn't a fan of the tikka masala that a lot of people talk about but I loved the chili chicken! I expected the tandoori chicken or chili chicken to be dry because chicken is dry a lot at buffets, but it was cooked superbly! 

The service was pretty good. They're quick with taking the dirty plates and refilling the water - which is so necessary with the spiciness! All in all I'll probably be back!",ERcsc0YO5CCUbkC8EV2INg,0,0,4,M_K2WqrTipv8wBLercGkdw

FOOD: 10/10 

Reason being is because the food here is diverse and encompasses all common aspects of Indian food. Unfortunately, most places offer one or two specialities, and the rest is bland. Ever dish at Mt. Everest is a speciality because I can't find any other place with better food.  NO GREASE, NO FUSS, AND LOTS OF VARIETY!

And I have worked in food industry as a floor manager for 3 years. Extremely friendly, and sincere. Two things that are rare in this world! 

AUTHENTICITY:

Chicken Tikka - sweet
Dal makhni - bland. And no trace of salt.

The minute I opened the door, the aroma of Indian spices welcomed me in. It brought back memories during my years in The UAE. The place looked clean, the staff were friendly, attentive and helpful....and the food was really good. They serve hot buttered naan with the meal. I requested garlic naan and they happily obliged. I excitedly went around the buffet to check what they had to offer. The first thing that caught my eye were the samosas. It was hot, freshly cooked and pretty good. More doughy than what I'm used to but still good. Then I see the chicken curry and goat curry in the very corner...boom! Be still my heart!  Those two dishes didn't disappoint at all. The goat pieces were so tender and the gravy was addictive. The chicken curry was equally good. I couldn't stop dipping my naan in the gravy. The chutneys totally complimented the curries. I also tried their chicken tikka and their chicken tikka masala. They were ok. They also had about 4 vegetarian dishes but everything pales in comparison to the curries. For dessert I tried kheer and gulab jamun. Their kheer was refreshing and not overly sweet  with a slight cardamom taste. Gulab jamun is good too but too sweet for my taste. 

The place got pretty busy around 12ish. They had a lot of South Asian clientele which is a good sign. The owner, Prakash is nice and friendly. He was constantly making sure that our needs were met. We left happy and full. 

Price for a lunch buffet : $10.99....definitely not bad!

When I think of buffet, I think of mediocre food lined up under the heat lamp. The food here is all good quality.

I really like the fact that they offer honey rice here. I can't handle spice too well and honey rice has a hint of sweetness that balances well with the spices from curry. I would highly recommend getting their spinach paneer (cheesy spinach curry) and lamb curry (lamb is super tender). 

As for dessert I like getting their rice pudding and fresh fruits.

I'm not experienced in Indian food, run-ins with curry and the occasional purchase of naan from Costco were about all I knew.  But wow...what a flavor bomb Mount Everest is!  Very unassuming restaurant on the outside..BAM!  Get your taste buds ready!

If you're very new to Indian food I urge you, start off slowly.  The multiple (and I mean multiple) spices used to make a majority of the food can be very overwhelming.  Indians are not shy with spices and they will throw everything in the book at you!  That can be a very good thing!  Wake up your senses!  Tastes from everywhere will be making your brain go BOING!  To be honest there must be a dozen or more critical spices used in Indian cooking, all present here at Mount Everest, I'll just name a few:

*Cardamom
*Clove
*Black pepper
*Cumin
*Coriander
*Nutmeg
*Mustard seed
*Fenugreek
*Turmeric
*Saffron

Are you ready?  Thought I was but I really wasn't!  For your best options, go for the daily lunch buffet.  You get to try a little bit of everything that Indian food has to offer.  There are some definite familiar dishes along with a few that are great starting points for newbie Indian foodies.

Only a beginner?  Go for the tasty Chicken Tikka Masala over a bed of their Sweet Rice.  Sweet, spicy, but not too spicy!  Also go for the Tandoori Chicken, marinated in yogurt, garlic, ginger & herbs then grilled over charcoal.  Delicious!

More experienced?  Go get it with their Chicken Curry or their Goat Curry (yep), try a Veggie Samosa or Pakora.  Don't forget the dipping sauces!  Raita, Mango Chutney, and Tamarind are ready to accompany all of your entrees!

Vegetarian?  The buffet also offers a few good options like Palak Paneer - homemade cheese cooked with fresh spinach & herbs.  Or the Aloo Kauli - potatoes & cauliflower cooked with tomatoes, peas, cilantro, roasted cumin & coriander.  

Please, please, please don't look a gift horse in the mouth - each table comes with a basket of freshly baked naan bread!  This is critical!  The curries, Hell just about everything goes excellent with the naan bread!  It's sooooo good!  Sop up all the extra goodness off your plate with a piece of naan!  If you get a chance order a basket of the garlic naan as well.  Carbs be damned!

Mount Everest is possibly the best Indian buffet around currently.  If you go for the lunch buffet be prepared to wait.  Tables are often full with regulars!  But it is totally worth it for the flavor explosion you will be receiving.  The price isn't bad either, $10.99 a person...what a deal!  Eat to your heart's content!

I've only been to Mount Everest for the lunch buffet, but I hear the dinner buffet as well as the regular menu is on fleek as well.  I will have to come back to give either of them a go.  But for right now I am happy with my lunch buffet for my Indian fix.  I will be back!

We had the vegetable samosa to start- it was a tad salty but with the two chutneys, they really balanced out.

We also had:
Chili Naan- was good, not spicy at all

Chicken Tikka- same as tandoori chicken but boneless. It was good, some pieces were a little dry but overall pretty good.  I don't understand the french fries on top though...that kinda threw me off..hmmm.

Lamb Vindaloo- delish.  Lamb were actual pieces of lamb, not the ground lamb like some places use.  Very flavorful, not too gamey.

Aloo matter- potatoes and peas in a sauce, again, large portion and large chunks of potatoes

Overall- everything was excellent, medium spice still gave all the entrees a little kick.  I just asked for hot sauce on the side to add to my food since I really like it spicy.

Will definitely be back, next time with my daughter as I know she will really enjoy it!  No butter chicken on the menu but think I'll try the chicken korma next!",LltbT_fUMqZ-ZJP-vJ84IQ,2,1,4,_yb_R8QOBEiYlqMyRgLpXQ

Service: Lunch buffet time has always been busy from all my visits. The staff moves quickly to keep the drinks fresh and to clear the table as you take down the buffet.  They keep the platters on the buffet line fresh.  All the food is hot and seems to have just left the kitchen for maximum freshness, excellent.

Food: Everest has some excellent Indian food for the lunch buffet.  The Tandorini Chicken and the Chili Chicken is the best I've had.  Sweet rice compliments them both well.  The Saag paneer (spinach & indian cheese) with the bomb garlic naan is such a great team.  Curry is also very tasty.  This is high quality Indian food at an Indian Lunch Buffet.

Value: Lunch Buffet is amazing value at $11.99.  This is one of the few buffets in Vegas where the value exceeds the price considerably.  I'll eat until I'm full, wait 5 minutes grab another plate, then another 5 minutes and shoot for half plate.  This is THE place to go when that Indian Food craving kicks in.

Ambiance: It appears to be an old Burger King which they attempted to convert a nice restaurant.   It appears, most of the capital was utilized to ensuring the food is high quality for the price versus making the place look pretty and I'm so ok with that.  I'm here for the bomb Indian food but it's not a place for a dress up night on the town.  I appreciate how they label the food on the buffet line as I'm a novice of Indian cuisine.

This place has always delivered when it comes to the food.  I can't reiterate how amazing the value of the lunch buffet is and the fact that you don't want to wait, really helps with managing the time.  Check it out and enjoy yourself...=)",AyjqBovADgbskmLrIBOMlQ,30,21,4,fbpkT-2W-shxZ1vTP5iMxw

If it's your first time, I recommend going to a dinner first to get a meal that you are expecting and want. I don't recommend the lunch buffet for the first time because the food will not be as fresh or made with quality and that may ruin your view on the restaurant.

BUFFET ITEMS:Vegetable korma, yellow daal, chana masala, vegetable samosa, sweet rice, basmati rice, vegetable pakora, chicken tandoori, chili chicken, chicken makhani, chicken curry, goat curry and the BEST part was that they had my favorite GULAB JAMUN!! 

The chicken curry was very flavorful, it had a great balance of creaminess and spices. It also contained big chunks of chicken which is what most people tend to skimp on (abundance of protein is always a plus in a buffet dish). I was surprised that they had goat curry (gamey stuff is not my cup of tea so this one I did not try). The gulab jamun were little balls of perfection. 

SERVICE: our server was very attentive and quick to refill our glass of water.

I subtracted a star b/c although the gulab was legit, they only had the gulab and rice pudding for dessert. There was no mango pudding or the carrot halwa the sweet carrot dessert, but I guess you can't have everything. I also wasn't a fan of their naan that they offered. A good naan has a little bit of crispiness and SOME flavor. This NAAN HAD NO FLAVOR whatsoever and was very thick and heavy. It was more of a PITA than a NAAN.

And the staff? Will do nothing. Just leave it to you to be abused, potentially in danger, or defend yourself.

IF YOU COME TO THIS RESTAURANT, AND HAVE A CONCEALED CARRY PERMIT... wear your gun. Hell, open carry it in this neighborhood... the people outside as soon as you park and surrounding the building and strip mall are SKETCH.

There are literally riff raff walking around drunkenly harassing patrons with impunity. Even starting fights.

And if you don't want to wind up in a fist fight just getting Indian food and trying to relax...

I'd keep yourself strapped. That goes for ANYwhere else in this neighborhood.

I figured this place was an exception. But there are no exceptions in this part of town.

And if  you have anything to lose, then you have everything to protect. Because some of this riff raff clearly has -nothing- to lose.

The people who own it are good people, honestly. They're not some uncaring idiots. They DO care about their patrons. They're honest, hard working people with a great menu selection.

But they're hardworking immigrants from India. They don't want to get involved in things better left to bouncers, etc. They're a family owned business and I understand that they don't want to pay the overhead for security.

Setting: It's in the Mariana grocery store plaza but the restaurant itself looks like it used to be a taco bell. The employees park their cars where the drive thru used to be lmao. Inside of the place is a standard with booths around and tables in the center.

Service: The gentlemen here are very friendly and attentive. Usually they make their rounds often so you never come back to your table with your previously used dish still waiting there for you. 

Food: I probably have the tastebuds for nepalese/indian food as the next american that thinks panda is good but I love this place. I'm sure there's a place somewhere that has more authentic food but hey this place is just so darn tasty! The tikka masala has so much herbs and flavors while the goat curry meat is so tender.

For an indian person I don't do as well with spicy food as one might expect.  This was a great balance of flavor amidst the kick in my mouth.  (I did ask for mild)

I came here for dinner and not going to lie was a little turned off by the outside.  Very seedy looking place.  Then I stepped inside and saw that it was decorated in a comfortable manner.  Clean and efficient enough.  (at least for appearence's sake!).  They brought out some papadum and a couple sauces to go with it.
I ordered the shahi paneer which was good, (not the best I've ever had but again i'm partial to homecookin). 
One little complaint I had was that I needed to ask for water a couple times as I tend to drink a lot of it while eating.  This is usually a given at higher end places, but as there was only two people working and it was rather busy i'll give them benefit of the doubt.  Also when I asked the waiter if I should try the shahi paneer or the paneer tikka masala he said he didn't know because he didn't eat vegetarian food.  (in a slightly rude manner)

Momos are like spicy xiao long bao with thick skins, or if you know real authentic Mongolian food (not those food court type places that basically reheat a pile of Americanized Chinese dry noodles for you), it's closer to a spicy buuz than an XLB.

This is Nepalese, not Indian. Our first time the owner took the time to explain some regional differences. It was clear that he is passionate about and proud of the food and culture of his people.

Aside from the owner, everyone was also attentive, polite, and good with refilling our waters.

We enjoyed everything we ordered here, not just the momos (though we liked those the best), and, what with the generous portions, ended up with enough leftovers to feed ourselves for days after. Mango lassi is pretty good here, not the best but nowhere near the worst.

PROTIP: Never bother with the buffet, not just here but anywhere. Everything is much better (though more expensive) if you order it off the menu because they make it for you to order instead of it sitting out congealing for the entire service.

Unfortunately you have no choice but buffet at lunchtime. It wasn't bad for a buffet. The tandoori chicken especially was tender and juicy, surprisingly not dried out. Some of the dishes even had a bit of kick for a buffet! (Usually buffets are pretty mild to cater to the lowest common spice denominator.) Favorites were the palak paneer (saag paneer), some aloo (potato) dish, tandoori chicken, vegetable samosas (relatively crisp considering they are sitting out on a buffet), chicken curry, and gulab jamun for dessert. Naan was also good and moist, not hard and dried out. Chicken tikka masala is on the sweet side. The goat curry was really tough, which was strange because it has been pretty tender when we've ordered it a la carte for dinner.

My husband and I took my parents here and it was all of our's first time. We decided to come for their buffet hour and we enjoyed almost everything they had to offer! We didn't touch any of their desert so I can't speak for it. I am a pescatarian and even so, I try to eat as little fish/seafood as I can so it is pretty hard for me to find a place where I can get a balanced and delicious meal. But his place has a whole steam table of vegetarian options for me! When I first tasted Malai Kofta at Angara Indian Spice (which is actually closer to me) I thought to myself, I think Indian food might just become one of my favorite food which includes to Filipino, Thai and Sushi/Japanese. Since I wasn't familiar with Indian food and was quite afraid to gamble on ordering something I have never heard of or didnt like how it looked, I didn't get a chance to explore more of the Indian cuisine until one of my good friend told me about Mount Everest. The price for their buffet is unbeatable for the amount of option they had to offer. Now I can say I have tried just a good amount of Indian Cuisine to make me love it too! I'm still working on memorizing the dishes' names. Malai Kofta and the green/spinach tofu thing (Saag Paneer?) are my favorite! ahhh I'm craving it again! Lol we had been coming here every other weekend. My husband and I would love to come every week but we are trying to avoid eating too much rice. So we have to sacrifice and wait and go every other week. Tomorrow for sure well go back. ^_^ .\/.

The exterior doesn't shout yummy Indian food; but the interior was nice and clean. I always check the restroom to see how well it is maintained before dining somewhere. It also was quite clean. There are booths against the walls & windows with round  tables in the center. There were several families and a few couples dining. 

What I really noticed was that everyone seemed to be having a good time and the conversations from the other tables could not be heard from where we were sitting. I thought that was a plus because you could have a private conversation or laugh at jokes without disturbing anyone else. They did an excellent job at seating their customers throughout the restaurant.

All in all, we were impressed with the quality, portions and price of the food. For starters, you get a basket of papadum with two little dipping sauces. We ordered Lamb Vindaloo (classic spicy lamb w/potatoes), Chicken Jel Frenzi (chicken with bell pepper, onions, mushrooms in sauce), Aloo Kauli (potatoes & cauliflower), and two orders of naan (garlic & keema/lamb). The dishes had wonderful sauces with excellent consistency for sopping up with naan. Everything was fresh, hot and yummy. 

The service was good. The waiter never let our water glasses get empty. And the food came out as ordered in a timely manner. I will definitely put Mt. Everest at the top of my list for non-franchised Indian dining.",F_PGwNib2ntDfosxfCzciw,0,0,4,nrs739cYIRvlQB15Vebq3w

Everest is quite a distance from where we live, we hadn't been back in over a year.  But I missed the place, and felt bad that the owner had always been so nice and accommodating to us, and didn't think we were being upstanding citizens by not rewarding his hospitality.

Not only did he remember us, he even remembered the fact that I hate overly salty food!!

I ordered a glass of the house Woodbridge Riesling, and for $5 got something rare: a FULL glass.  We thought we'd order a mulligatawny soup to share, in addition to the Mt. Everest thali that we were also going to share, but the owner talked us out of it, saying I'd find it too salty.  Now that's service!  He suggested the Chau Chau soup instead, which has noodles, onion, cilantro, and tomato.  It had just the right amount of kick and was very tasty.  And not salty.  

Having the thali was definitely like coming home again.  A large appetizer platter of  goodies, including a delicious samosa, tandoori chicken, beef kebab, and lots of pakora filled me up before the piece de resistance, the large silver tray with my favorite - palak paneer - which had a goodly amount of the paneer, lentils, chicken tikka, lamb curry, raita, and the dessert, kheer.  We had asked for kulfi instead of the kheer, and for it to be served at the end of the meal, since it's frozen.  No problem - we got the kulfi, and were told to keep the kheer anyway.  Everything was excellent, except for the lamb, which was tough.  I could have said something, but who needed more food?  We took some leftovers home anyway.

The rice was perfect and not overcooked. Since I am vegetarian and absolutely love spinach, the saag was my favorite. Everything was seasoned well and had just the right amount of spice. I am glad this restaurant did not go light on the seasonings to appease some delicate palates.

I'm glad it came in a clean glass because at Bollywood they gave me a glass with a whole bunch of fingerprints all over it. That was a turn off!

I thought the only way to get my fix was to fly back to the Bay to get it, BUT then I came across this place!

I have probably driven passed this place a billion times before I considered to try it and honestly, it wasn't until I saw the awesome ratings from Yelpers before I decided it was a GO. Boy am I happy I did! EVERYTHING on their menu is so flavorful and rich! My boyfriend and I LOooOoOOOove this place. It's inside of what used to be a Burger King in front of the Mariana's Supermarket. The area isn't aesthetically pleasing, but don't you dare judge a book by it's cover! Their service is hospitable, kind of quiet and shy, but hospitable nonetheless. 

Their Mango Lasse is amazeballs. Their chai is alright, probably wouldn't order it again though. The Papadams (spelling?) and the little sauces that get served before you order are so dainty and delicious! 

If you ever come for their Lunch Buffet, don't plan on eating for the rest of the day, haha! They have an awesome selection and everything is fresh! We're so excited that we found this place. The boyfriend and I were talking about how we don't know why Indian food has such a negative social stigma when it's actually delicious. But I guess we don't really mind.

The restaurant is clean with ample parking and easy access in comparison to many other Vegas restaurants.

People have typically low expectations when going to a lunch buffet, but we were blown away by the quality of the food. I personally prefer vegetarian Indian dishes, and they did not disappoint. Aloo gobi was the best I'd ever had. The potatoes and cauliflower were cooked to the perfect tenderness and  had the perfect seasoning. The palak paneer was unique and savory. Chana masala was more acidic and fragrant than I am use to, but it was a welcome change. Don't get me started on whatever that sweet rice is called, it's orange, and is made with magic and cashews.

The non vegetarian dishes were quite good as well. The chicken tikka masala was creamy without being heavy. The goat curry was delicious, savory and perfectly cooked. The flesh fell off of the bone and was more tender than I thought possible of goat meat. 

After I mopped up the delicious remnants of my meal with the fresh crispy naan brought to my table, I realized not once did I find my water glass empty. The hosts were very friendly, and checked on us often at our table. Prakash, the benefactor of the restaurant, stopped by to make sure the food was to our satisfaction. After asking about taking some gulab jamun (a must try) to-go, he brought some over free of charge. Beautiful man.

I called in and the menu on Yelp really helped me order since I never been here before. This place was recommended by one of my clients that says she always comes here because the food and service is exceptional.
I called-in the order for pick up and a gentleman helped me. I ordered the food items then towards the end I was confused because I wasn't sure how much I should order for 2 people. Then he said, are you ordering for tomorrow lunch as well? I guess I ordered too much. Haha! He said that he recommend removing one entree from the order and that should be more than enough for dinner for 2 people. I appreciated this because it was a lot of food! The gentleman was very professional and nice. 

The food was fantastic! So flavorful, delicious and fresh! The garlic naan was a bit addicting. Chicken tandoori was very satisfying. You cannot go wrong with the food here. If you are into Indian food or you are a first timer, you need to come here and try! I cannot wait to come here with a group of friends.

One thing that I think would make this place even better is background soft Indian music to make the experience better. Just my thoughts :)",LZqp0nX_kOCSS8tybxA4Hg,1,1,5,Jp2bxF50FxgOQO8d1xrJIw

There was channa masala, palak panneer, dal, brinjal masala and couple more. I liked only the palak panneer. My wife is a vegetarian and to her, the vegetarian spread was just ok and naan was fine too. She was not very impressed. I moved on to the chicken items like tandoori chicken, chilli chicken, chicken tikka masala, chicken curry and goat curry.

Many of the items on the lunch buffet vary from day to day--some days there will be chana masala, some days vegetable korma, etc.  It's always great.  I actually like ordering from the menu better, though.  The owner is a very nice guy and works hard to make sure his customers have everything they need.

4794049,2013-05-05,0,gTlDDzDEHyDQ6iwjNhpI6A,"Right off, I'm very stingy with giving out stars and I'm not likely to assign any value to the outside of any place.  This restaurant is not much to look at from the outside but is a medium to small restaurant that is pleasantly decorated inside with a friendly staff.  The lunch buffet is served in some of the nicest heated tables (one iced table for the cold menu) with covered chafing dishes.  The food is kept hotter than any other buffet with dishes refreshed regularly.  The one meat table is separate from the vegetable tables, a nice feature for vegetarians to avoid cross contamination.

Every dish was delicious.  Although I would have liked to have one main potato dish (there were potato samosas and a great mixed vegetable dish with potatoes) and would drop up to half a star for the menu selection, the food was fresh, perfumed, and not overly South Indian hot.  The obligatory Tandoori Chicken was both flavorful and moist.  I suspect that the heated tables and covered chafing dishes help maintain the quality of the food.  The pakora were a little crunchy, maybe not perfect, but tasty.  Given that there are no half-stars, the only negatives were not worthy of dropping to four stars considering our overall satisfaction.

We arrived for a late lunch, around 1:30, but the food was great and refreshed before the dish was emptied, keeping the quality up.  The plain naan arrived before we were back from the buffet and I would have liked to have garlic naan, but no one asked.  I guess it is important to ask right away for naan other than plain, but the plain naan was good.  The service was fine with dishes cleared and water refilled, but a little invisible and surprisingly shy.  For any questions, just call out for them -- they really don't want to disturb your meal.

Overall, the fixtures were superior, the dining room was kept clean, and every dish on the buffet was terrific.  Not quite the huge selection found in some of the buffets in Silicon Valley, but it was all good.  Hard to believe that any other Indian buffet in Vegas will beat this spot for quality and value, this is now our go-to Indian restaurant for Vegas.",X7Bi3A--woVII5Zpg-tUEQ,1,0,5,Oh44nv2RODLM4VNBznSs7w

That part of the meal was underwhelming. The sausage was very dry and the battered veg was just ok. Neither was too tasty. 

There was a variety of 4-5 V and NV curries that were served along with rice and plain naan. The naan was incredible and had a bit of a crust which I've never seen before.

The food:

Finally some heat with my lunch buffet food. The food here isn't too spicy it has just enough heat to get the job done. You start in the vegetarian section which has some amazing dishes then move your way to the meats. I love the chicken dishes and the goat curry is one of my favorites. You then move onto condiments and desert. Make sure to grab some plain yogurt and chutney to dip your naan into. 

Service: 

If anything is low just let the owner know and he has them cook it right away. Service is excellent water or soda glasses are kept full. If you come in after they stop cooking for the buffet the owner will let you know when you walk in. He will also ask you to go take a look at what he has out to make sure you would like to stay. 

Also don't forget if you are just driving by during the lunch buffet hours you can grab a to go box and load it up for the same price as the lunch buffet.

When I asked them about not having rice kheer dessert, they said it rotates with other different items (that day had a mango dessert). Darn. To my surprise, he brings out a complimentary bowl of kheer. Awesome! It is one of my favorite desserts; so simple, yet so good.

We decided to get the

Mt Everest Special ($21.99) Which comes with: mixed appetizer, salad, papadam, chicken tikka, dal makhani, palak paneer, lamb curry, chicken tikka, rice, naan, raita. For dessert gulab jamun and chai tea.  We did not really get what was on the menu as we didn't get salad or our dessert but Kheer rice pudding instead. I didn't realize this until looking at the online menu for this review. Either way- it's alot of food but would have been nice to get what we ordered. 

The mix appetizer was some grilled sausage, chicken tikka pieces, a samosa and little papadam bites. It was a very big plate and was super filling. The main dishes were decent with the paneer being my favorite. My one thing was that the paneer and the dal needed a bit of salt, but still good. Raita was more tangy and watery than most I've had, but was good to dip my naan in. The kheer was very nice and not too sweet.

Chicken Korma ($12.99)- entrees come with rice. It was decent, but was more yellow curry flavor than other kormas I've had. 

We also got some garlic naan ($2.99) thinking that there might not be enough naan with the mixed plate but if we didn't order this the plain naan would be more than enough. 

The amount of food for two people with that is crazy. We had leftovers which I had for two separate and still very sizable lunches. We would have been very full and satisfied with just the mixed plate, but we had a restaurant.com certificate to use. 

Service was okay. They started off good with drink refills when they came to drop off food. After a while they were doing tasks and seemed to be really into it towards of our meal so we sat there for a while needing things. 

Overall, the food here isn't my favorite Indian but decent. It definitely is the most value large portions than any others I've been to.",n86B7IkbU20AkxlFX_5aew,6,3,3,e_2M_LTaQuPRrNEun7uGVQ

The server and the manager were so incredibly polite. They periodically checked on me to make sure everything was to my liking and my water cup was always filled to the brim!

The food was awesome! A variety of lamb and chicken curry. A few vegetarian options. The samosas were on the salty side but still incredibly delicious. They had plain rice and a bright orange sweet rice which was awesome but I preferred to eat the plain rice with all the sauces and meats. The naan was fluffy and as delicious can be. ! I managed to scarf down a whole basked by myself!  Next time I'll be asking to try the garlic naan too. I saw a table next to me order it and it looked awesome!

The tandoori chicken was just a slight bit dry and we had to wait a bit for the naan to come out.

Overall a lot of Pros:

+Every dish had a unique curry flavor...wasn't the same curry taste in multiple dishes
+Food was hot and fresh...
+Food quality was good, you'd think you ordered a la carte
+Service was excellent...water was always refilled promptly
(the guy that gave one star and said they used tap water...not the case today)
+Love that paneer spinach and cheese thing
+Chili Chicken was good

We were there early enough so that when the cooks brought out the trays, they too took some plates of food from the tray into the back for themselves. For me that means no monkey business in the kitchen...you always assume there's not but I've seen too many episodes of Kitchen Nightmares.

The goat was so-so...kinda fatty and lots of bones, was hard to find a good piece in the whole tray...for $10.99 perhaps that's not enough to cover a lamb substitute and maintain profit.

I think what was missing today were my sweet monkey balls that seem to hit the desert spot and some beef korma...my favorite dish...I think they had it last time.

Despite this not being as good as I first remembered...it's still the best Indian buffet I've tried (been to about 3)

Indian food is like Thai food to me...the more spicy it is, the better it tastes!  You get much more flavor and depth in the curries and misc, so it's much more enjoyable!

And the Garlic Naan of course! The most ""garlicky"" I've had...so much flavor...yum!  I think we ate three baskets while we were here LOL.

We ordered the bhindi masala (okra dish) and the palak paneer (spinach and Indian cheese) dish with a garlic naan.  It surprisingly came with basmati rice which was nice since we didnt order it.
The bhindi masala was really good.  Probably the best one I have had so far.  Full bodied flavor and not slimey.  The palak paneer was tasty. I like that it was too pureed and had some texture left in it.  The garlic naan was dripping with ghee or butter or oil and my friend said it was really good.  It looked liked really good naan.

5228652,2014-09-29,1,gTlDDzDEHyDQ6iwjNhpI6A,"After a very long night Saturday night, my fella and I woke up around 11:30 absolutely STARVING.  
We got up, got ready, and ventured out, neither of us really knowing what we wanted to eat.
Our first choice was closed on Sundays (boo), so as we were driving back towards the house, I pulled up my trusty Yelp app, and did a search for nearby restaurants. 

Mount Everest was the first one that popped up, and with such a high rating, we decided that since we hadn't had Indian food in a long time, we would give it a go!

We walked in, and were smacked in the face with the most delicious aroma!  It smelled like all the beautiful spices I miss from my Indian friends cooking for me back home in Chicago. 

We were greeted and shown to a table, and told that we could go ahead and start on the buffet whenever we were ready.

For $10.99 per person, I thought that the buffet was nice.  

Lots of choices!  
First round, I tried almost everything...I was a little stand-offish about the goat curry.  I've never had goat before and was nervous, but I did try it second round.  
My favorites: 
Daal (lentil soup):  really spicy and full of flavor.  Its good on its own or over the basmati rice. 
Chicken Tikka Masala.  Uh.  YUM.  Tender chicken in a rich and creamy sauce...mmm.
Vegetable Samosas:  Delightful.  Lightly spiced, and delicious.  I went back for thirds of these, and they are really nice with the mint chutney.
Naan:  I had hoped for the garlic Naan, but alas, we only got the regular.  That's ok.  It was AMAZING.  My fella's favorite of the day was the naan dipped in the tikka masala sauce.  SO delightful!

I liked the Aloo Baingan (eggplant and potato), but it was just a tiny bit too spicy for me.
I found the goat curry very thin/greasy looking in the sauce, and it was honestly hard to get a couple pieces of meat, as there were so many bones.  It was a little fatty for me, but the flavor and cook was good.  I would be willing to try it again.  

The tandoori chicken was just kind of ""meh"" for me.  My fella loved it.  I'm not usually a big fan of chicken on the bone though, so I know that had something to do with it.

Service was polite and quick.  Our water glasses were never empty, and we received our naan in a timely manner.  I loved the Bollywood music and videos playing too.  

All in all, this was a good experience for me.  It wasn't mind blowing, but I found the food very tasty.  I would definitely return, and recommend it to anyone looking for good Indian Food.",renPzRDqMZpMaHiCD_e1_A,5,1,3,HE5Xk0kqOK4bYSZWgGF0sA

Located on West Sahara Avenue and easily overshadowed as it sits low in the Mariana's Supermarket parking lot, Mt. Everest India's Cuisine has been serving Las Vegas a wide variety of Northern Indian specialties since 2009, the full dinner menu replaced by an $11.99 lunch buffet 7-days a week from eleven o'clock until 3pm.

Family owned and operated, the space essentially a fifty-seat box with limited lighting thanks to heavy curtains, those entering Mt Everest will pick up the scent of Cumin and Turmeric before even opening the street-facing front door, a staff member tucked into a hostess booth to the right offering greetings while one of two young men offer a choice of seating options.

A simple operation a lunch, Televisions displaying Indian Music Videos providing entertainment above steamer trays containing approximately two-dozen choices, it is with a basket of Butter Naan that the meal starts as diners gather plates and small bowls, the majority of the protein centered around Chicken though a look at the dinner menu shows a much greater variety including Lamb and Seafood.

Admittedly a little underwhelmed by the Naan, the two wedges provided flatter than that found elsewhere and a bit dry when taken on their own, the Bread nonetheless proved serviceable for scooping up tangy Raita or creamy Spinach with small chunks of springy Cheese mixed in, the vibrant orange Rice as fluffy as Basmati with a hint of Nuts and light Sugar that went very nicely with the baked Eggplant and Potato dish as well as the spicier flavors to follow.

Finding Potato and Onion Samosa's downright addictive while similarly flavored Pakora came across a bit too oily, Goat Curry was a welcomed sight that packed a lot of heat around tender bone-in chunks of Meat that proved to be worth the effort, the Tandoori Chicken varying from piece to piece in terms of moistness while the Malai Kofta ate something like big Gnocchi in a base rife with Onions and Tomatoes in a creamy base.

Drawn to the Chili Chicken against better judgement, the fear of indigestion at work looming, it was surprising how well Mt. Everest's Chefs managed to balance the Peppers with pungent notes of Garlic and Ginger, the Yellow Dal scooped up with Naan clearly the source of a lot of the Turmeric mentioned earlier while ubiquitous Tikka Masala featured big slices of Chicken Breast bathed in a sauce milder than many with a notable linger of Coconut.

Finishing off the rest of the Naan with Mango Chutney, the Jelly-like spread also a nice addition to Rice Pudding served room temperature with restrained Sugar, those looking for something sweeter should turn their attention to the hot tray of Gajar Halwa tucked amidst the savory items, the natural sweetness of ground Carrots ramped up by Fruit, Nuts and Cardamom - basically molten Carrot Cake without the flour.

***1/2Admittedly no expert on ethnic Buffets of any sort, the low prices that attract many raising suspicion about ingredients, Mt. Everest executes the majority of its dishes well while offering a good variety at a fair price, the intrinsic limitations of serving from steamer trays mitigated by a good crowd that sees items replenished frequently.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,7,7,4,XWoPap9y-XekjLQwkzK-GA

It was just plain naan and I wasn't expecting much but man I was wrong. It was the perfect piece; slightly sweet, chewy, salty, and so perfect. I would order fifty of these when I come back.

They give you a basket of papadum with mint and tamarind sauces.  We started of with samosa (they're like potato-filled empanadas with ginger and spices) and aloo tikki (fried patties of mashed potatoes in chick pea batter).

Mango Lasi:
Creamy mango shake. 5/5

Veggie Samosa:
You get two pieces for $4.  The crust was the right thickness and wasn't too doughy.  You can definitely taste the spices.  I had to use the tamarind sauce to tone down the heat a bit. Very filling. 4/5

Aloo Tikki:
You get 2 patties for $4. Crispy deep-fried mashed potatoes.  Very filling as well.  Great flavor. 5/5

Palak Paneer:
I was looking for the cheese on top since that's what I'm used to.  4/5

Garlic Naan:
I love this stuff.  We had 2 orders. Hot, garlicky and buttery bread to scoop/dip saucy dishes with. 5/5

Chicken Tikka Masala:
My favorite Indian dish.  We ordered mild but it was still quite spicy...but it burned so good. 5/5

Kulfi:
A mild cheesy ice cream and you can see pistachio bits. 4/5

Gulab Jamun:
My favorite Indian dessert. They're like hot cheese dougnuts in simple syrup. 5/5

if, like me, a great meal in a quiet place is what you're after, run, dont walk, to Mt. Everest. Prakash and the fellas serve up some of the tastiest Indian cuisine I've ever had. 

don't let the neighborhood (it's quite safe) or the former pizza hut exterior deter you, as soon as you walk inside it feels like an oasis. and the delicious smells of curry and tandoori greet you.

the chicken tikka, served sort of fajita-style, was tender and delicious, and spiced to perfection. the saag paneer, one of my favorite indian dishes, was savory and so inviting that i kept going back to it as i ""filled in the corners"" at the end of the meal, when i'd already eaten too much. we also had their lamb curry which was not a ground lamb curry but featured a generous portion of cubed lamb shoulder perfectly cooked and tender.

Unfortunately, lunch is ONLY the buffet for $10.99 [it is not clear if this is ALL-YOU-CAN-EAT].  A menu is only for dinner.
The buffet had a ""sneeze"" shield with sticky notes with handwritten names for whatever was under the shield.  The labels were for the Indian name of the dish; not very helpful if you're not an Indian speaker.
The ""wet"" items were soupy and the ""dry"" items were dry to an extreme.  The two best items, IMHO, were the chicken curry and the white rice, while the others were forgettable.  The condiments I normally associate with curry [like coconut, peanuts, grated onion, etc. were absent; although the chutney was present, but unremarkable as chutney].
I would hazard a guess that those giving five stars are native speakers and are familiar with the food in the buffet.  Since I'm neither, this made things awkward.",JhTFqM9-Bd5BSiuo6ROMnw,0,0,3,2bRj57weIhwGZoWI6y0qnA

We began with chicken momos, that were fresh and had plenty of flavor with and without the sauce. 
We then got the chicken tiki masala, chicken curry, lamb korma and vegetable biryani. 
Each dish was unique and the flavors built off one another. Our water glasses were never empty as the spices climbed, a true testament to the service. 

Both the garlic naan and the plain are perfect accompaniments to the dishes and really round out the meal. 

From the moment stepping inside and breathing in the fresh scent to leaving Mount Everest makes you feel welcome whether it's your first time or old regulars.

Running short on time we were not able to get to our original destination. While on Sahara we passed by this place and good thing because my heart was set on Indian. Seeing that most of my friends has written so highly of this place, it was worth giving a try. For $10.99, the lunch buffet is one amazing deal. 

I wasted no time, got a plate and created a mountain that would give Everest a run for its money. Saag Paneer will always be my favorite. I spooned some onto my plate and was elated with the large cubes of cheese swimming in my spinach. The sweet rice can be eaten on its own as a dessert like the similarly florescent orange rice found in Vietnamese eateries or used to balance out the spice in your favorite curry. I ate it with my meal and it contributed a nice contrast to everything else on my plate. The Aloo Gobi was seasoned well, but did not have much cauliflower. The Goat Curry was tender and did not possess the gaminess that people normally complain about. The stew did contain many small bone. I spent some time picking through to be safe. The tandoori was dry on the outside and moist on the inside. I have never seen that before, so it was not a total bust. If there was an aspect to complain about, it was that I was not at the table to order garlic naan. Plain naan just doesn't do anything for me anymore.

5390839,2012-06-11,15,gTlDDzDEHyDQ6iwjNhpI6A,"Just got finished eating at Mount Everest for their lunch buffet and I'm literally reeling in pain at my desk.  This opening line would work much better if you couldn't already see the 5 star rating I'm giving them.   Yes, this is that Sushi Mon all you can eat and then some, pants button undoing type of stomach pain, and not the having flashbacks of the Subway employee not washing his hands while making your Sweet Onion Teriyaki chicken sandwich type of pain.

I wish I could describe what I ate in detail, but the truth is I have no idea.  On the first plate I tried everything on the right side of the hot buffet items, which resulted in a plate of rice and an assortment of deliciously spiced veggie and chicken dishes along with some Veggie Samosas and Pakoras.  After a while, sauces were blending into each other, pakora were getting smothered with various other items, left became right, black became white, and soon a harmonious melting pot had been achieved on my plate that rivaled any buffet experience I've had.  With each bite I had no idea which item(s) I were eating, but they were all fantastic.  Some of these bites provided quite a kick and the quickly refilled iced tea and water were much appreciated.

I had no need for a 2nd plate.  I had no room for a 2nd plate.  Someone should have stopped me, but alas, they didn't.   Walking up to the buffet line, the only game plan I had was to try everything on the left side that I didn't try the first time.   Chicken Curry, Chicken something else, Chicken something else.  Done.  Unfortunately I also couldnt resist some more Daal, some more samosas, some more pakora.  3 bites in I knew I was in trouble.  12 bites in I started to hurt.  20 bites in I tapped out.   Now an hour later I'm finally starting to recover...

The spread was usual, not a great lot of variety, but enough to satisfy your Indian food craving. The good thing was that the food was pretty spicy and flavorful. Not bland at all. The naan bread was soft and just amazing. Except the palak paneer ( spinach and Indian cheese) I think everything was made to perfection. The carrot halwa ( carrot pudding) was good too. The yellow daal tasted homemade, just how my mom would make. The butter chicken and goat curry were good too. 
I always get excited when I see momos ( Nepalese Indian dumplings) on any menu. We ordered those with our buffet. But they were nothing close to what you get in India. 
However, a decent place to have Indian food in Vegas. And it is around 15 min by cab from the strip.",MfLgwyk_6C853bbNxwGoUQ,1,0,4,TMUtGbvTerY6h5gj1669HA

5636434,2017-07-16,0,gTlDDzDEHyDQ6iwjNhpI6A,"The usual disclaimer: I have not visited this restaurant. This review is regarding my recent delivery experience. 

I love Indian cuisine. I'm no expert on it though; there are a few things I like a lot, but many dishes I haven't tried.

I ordered the Chicken Korma, a tandoori plate, and regular naan. The Chicken Korma was described on their on-line menu as ""mild."" Now, I generally like spicy food, but I sometimes prefer a mild curry, so the flavors of the spices are present and the protein can be enjoyed. If this Korma was ""mild,"" I'd really hate to think how spicy their Vindaloo is! It was also of a consistency more suited to hummus than to curry. I never got a chance to taste the chicken in the Korma (I usually find myself ordering a curry just for the sauce); the curry itself, while unexpectedly spicy, and thicker than I prefer my curries, was still quite flavorful.

The tandoori platter consisted of some white meat tandoori chicken nuggets; predictably dry, but well seasoned and a great pairing with the tamarind sauce. Also a samosa, which I haven't gotten to yet; some very lovely, moist lamb kebab; and these little fried things which I've never encountered before, but were quite tasty.

The naan, I'm sorry to say, was very dense and a little too moist, possibly because of the way it's packed for delivery. Naan is my favorite flatbread; this fell a bit, well, flat (really, no pun intended!). 

I think I will order from this establishment again, but I'll put a request in for the chef to ensure that the mild curry I order is actually mild, and perhaps I'll try the garlic naan, for some added flavor.",UL4bxNpzHk5V-xDrF7H5fA,0,0,3,_vJ8BR9xOZs3IYszmmo6wQ

We both felt it was one of the best Indian buffets we had been to. So much so, that I ate a ton of food and couldn't eat another thing for the rest of the day. Standout dishes were the chickpea curry, the sweet rice (never seen this before!), and the warm carrot dessert.... so tasty! The chicken tikka masala wasn't the best I'd ever had. Complaints include: we finished a full plate of food before getting the opportunity to ask for naan (they didn't bring any to us), our booth was in a weird corner you had to squeeze into, and their women's bathroom wasn't super clean (although I imagine that was from a recent customer and not due to a general lack of cleanliness).

5641010,2014-09-27,0,gTlDDzDEHyDQ6iwjNhpI6A,"We were looking for an Indian buffet place for lunch, so a quick search on Yelp threw up Everest India's Cuisine with good reviews so we decided to give it a try. As usual I was skeptical of any Indian place with good reviews but decided to give it a try hoping to be proved wrong. Mount Everest is located on Sahara Avenue not too far from the strip and has sufficient parking so location and accessibility is fine.

When we entered at peak lunch hour on Sunday the place was packed which I took as a good sign. As the restaurant is small and tables are cramped close to each other so seating is very uncomfortable and navigating to and from the buffet is painful as you void bumping into other diners.

The dishes were standard fare that you will find in any Indian buffet. The appetizers included tandoori chicken, samosa and some fried potato dish. Butter chicken, saag, chili chicken and mutton curry were entrees. Then there was steamed rice and dal and lastly gulab jamun and sweet rice for desert.

Taste wise what stood out to me was that every dish was bad. Not just one or two items but everything that I ate was the text book definition of bad Indian food. Tandoori chicken seemed to be boiled and then doused with a lot of color as it lacked any flavor at all and was stone cold. The samosa seemed to be undercooked. The pan fried potato were limp and seemed to be days old. The butter chicken was barely edible. Chili chicken tasted gross and the goat in the mutton curry was undercooked so was chewy (not one person in our entire group could eat the goat). The naan provided at the table was thin and overcooked so it felt like a crispy flatbread. We asked for garlic naan which was better but it came at the fag end of the meal so it was almost useless. The gulab jamun was one of the worst that I'd ever had and the sweet rice was forgettable. I also noticed that there was no biryani in this buffet.

Service was also slow. As mentioned garlic naan was provided at the end of the meal. Plates were not cleared quickly so we ended up stacking them in one corner which made the small table feel even more cramped. Even stacked plates did not prompt quick service and at one time we were scared that the plates would topple over and cause a mess but that did not deter our servers from ignoring them.

At the end of the meal I was happy to be out of this small, cramped, claustrophobic place with terrible food. A sentiment echoed by each and every member of our group that ate here.

Price wise it was $10.99 which is typical for Indian buffet's but what I can't get is the high ratings for this place. unfortunately another Indian restaurant that did not live up to its sky high ratings. Obviously won't make the mistake of returning again.",HdrdiwMYkhWI49lmNPeziA,0,0,1,_fE5jy10NW44TUC4YWwMdQ

My brother had to point out that it was a rather crappy part of town, but I didn't notice anything. Granted there were a lot of bail bond signs around and title loan locations, but that does not mean it is a bad part of town.

Walking into the place, I was hit in the face with the smells of India, but not like it hit me in the face with a metal bat, more like a large fluffy pillow. We were seated and given our menus. As some of the others on here have said the mixed platter is excellent, the waiter is also very hydrating.

I'm not from Vegas. I have been to this restaurant twice, with my friends. The first time was on a Sunday morning, 10 minutes before they opened for a buffet. Everything we ate was fresh, all trays topped up. The service was also at par. Their goat curry was one to remember.

The 2nd time we went there was a little late in the afternoon, on a Sunday again. But somehow I did not get the same experience (with the food especially) that day. It was okay but nothing exciting. Oh and by the way, do NOT get their mo:mos. It's HORRIBLE. We tried both chicken and veggie and both of them sucked.

The owner (well, I don't know his name but I guess he is the owner) and guys who work there are very cheerful and accommodating. Their space is a bit cramped for a restaurant that offers buffet.

Granted it was only for the lunch buffet, but I guess I don't know if it will get any more than marginally better for made-to-order entrees.

Now, the food in itself is pretty good - decent flavors, ample choices for buffet.  But it's not very spicy.  At all.  That's actually a big deal because I think part of what makes curry & masala what they are is the distinct kick they produce.  

Service is spartan due to the buffet nature, but is pleasant when provided.  Place wreaks of herbs, so I'm thinking maybe they need a bit more ventilation.  Area is a bit fishy, but out in the open so not too worried about safety.

In all, it's a fine place for Indian food but you'll leave wanting to see if there is something better.

I love Palak Paneer, and this place has some of the best in Vegas! I love it, everyone is always kind in serving and even when they are busy, it's still a lovely experience. Don't forget the complimentary na'an at lunch... Very yummy!!",AxTTTiHFVmOMo7mrH3qDUw,0,0,5,C9HM_NGRzvfmrfUOmOg21w

My wife and I took a little bus ride over here on one of our annual trips to Vegas (honeymoon this time yay!) and man was it worth it.  We love Indian buffets, but in the Midwest the quality level can vary quite a bit.  Mount Everest hits it out of the park.  Price was incredibly reasonable (10-15$), they had just about every Indian food I've ever had available, and the taste was sublime.  Mouth-watering delicious.  The staff was polite and friendly too.

The bus ride was very reasonable.  We bought a Deuce Bus 24 hr pass ($8) which was also good for the city bus, so we were able to hop one from the strip over to there.  Its a pretty quick ride and the neighborhood seemed fine.  I've snagged the Duece pass each time I've been in Vegas and despite being slow at times its one of the best ways to save money when out on the town.

If you are an Indian Buffet lover, this is my favorite of all the ones I've had, so definitely make the time and give it a stop.",lcrcput-8GMw6St64LIr9Q,1,1,5,gZrV_ZsogTDlCZu_M4mfLQ

Very casual lunch, and very nice family atmosphere for dinner.
I have been to both. I prefer the lunch buffet. 
Its hard to have Indian cuisine for lunch for me because most places seem more upscale and a dinner style establishment.
Not here! They make it very inviting and laid back! 
The buffet option gives opportunity to learn about most dishes you have never ordered before. It was great! Sample some of everything.

My favorite was the Palak Paneer. Spinach with homemade cheese. If i could eat this with every meal for the rest of my life I think i would!
Chili chicken is very good too!

The spice level was perfect for me, If it gets too hot try a mango lassi drink!
I don't usually drink sweet stuff with my meal, but this drink actually compliments and cools the spice! Very good!

I came here with a frequent patron who claimed this place is the best in Vegas, and even she said that the food didn't taste how it normally should. The flavor profiles were all off. 

Chicken tikka masala- 1 star. The curry didn't taste right. no richness, not much buttery or creamy flavor. 

Paneer saag with chicken (spinach dish)- 1star. I wasn't too impressed. Nothing too special about this dish.

Aloo gobi (potatoes and cauliflower) - 1 star. Cauliflower was overcooked, mushy, and lacked flavor. 

Garlic naan- 1 star. The dough was undercooked in certain areas. 

Samosas with minced lamb-2 stars. 
I've always gotten potatoes or vegetarian so lamb was a first. Inside was good, but the breading was really strange. It was super doughy and over-fried making the texture almost as crunchy as biting into a rock. Not like I know what that's like...

Service- 5 stars. Our glasses were constantly full, they are on top of their game. 

The highlight of my dinner was the green sauce and tamarind sauce they give you at the beginning with some fried stuff. That's about it. I'm a bit afraid to give this place a second shot after my experience as I was really looking forward to it.",B1829_hxXSEpDPEDJtYeIw,9,1,2,RACQTY31B11uD_-V6aJkjA

I'm a Brit, we know , or think we know, everything about Indian food. We grow up eating the stuff, there are more Indian restaurants in England than Mickey D's. Really! Would I embellish? Maybe but I don't think so in this instance.

Anyway, Friday night and the kids ditched us. Outrageous I know, but gives Wifee and I a rare chance to eat what we want. ""Yuhi K. recommends a place down on Sahara"" I explain. ""Who is Yuhi K.?"" asks my leader. "" She knows about food"" I explain unconvincingly.

It is a long drive down W.Sahara from my hood and Wifee is viewing my choice with suspicion. "" It will be great"" I proclaim ""be patient"". 

Mt.Everest sits in front of a slightly rundown strip mall but parking is easy and my expedition was a success.

We were greeted promptly and offered a table or booth. Booth. The greeter/server guy seemed to be the owner. He was great. Recommended a great beer, Taj Mahal, 1.5 pints of frothy cold delight, Wifee grabbed a nice cold Chardonnay.

We started with a mixed dish of samosa, kebab, chicken tikka and some other stuff. Fantastic and more than enough to share.

Mains: I had a Mushroom lamb dish, I am asked how spicy I would like. being a big shot expert Indian food eater , I asked for 7/10. Too hot! I'm such a wimp after many years away from Blighty, Really quite pathetic. I tell my server/owner/guy. No problem! He took it away and brought it back re done at a more acceptable spiceness. ( I'm pretty sure that's not a word, sorry). Delicious! Served with rice and a garlic naan. 

Wifee has Chicken Saag, she ordered 6/10 on the heat scale. Perfect!

Water was always topped up, drinks were offered frequently. Really great and we are going back. Often.

After seeking some yelphelp and thanks to fellow yelper's review - we decided to go to Mt. Everest. The place is not ambient or upscale..It is very casual and less attractive...but the best part was the food and then the service. We got in that night close to getting the kitchen closed...and there was a huge party that was leaving. So it took some time for the restaurant folks to have us seated. Once we were shown our table, the owner Prakash made sure we are comfortable and took our orders. We had a good mix of Veg and Non Veg order. We ordered that night Chicken Pepper Fry, Chicken Biryani, Goat Biryani, Shrimp Biryani, Naan, Aloo Gobi, Veg Biryani and one more veg gravy....(don't remember it now)...The food was a mix of Indian and Nepali style. The service very prompt and we got our first order Chicken Pepper Fry and it was not that good - we felt like it was taken from the leftovers of that afternoon buffett..however the biryani - all of them were presumptuous quantity and excellent taste..so it out beat the chicken pepper fry. The aloo gobi was excellent and it was perfectly made. 

So our first night in LV experience was very satisfying. We decided to go there again before we head out to the Airport for our return flight. This time, more or less we ordered the same menu item. We did give Mr. Prakash the feedback on the chicken pepper fry. He acknowledged and let us know that he is going to the let the chef know to make it a better and he did. The food was amazing but the real 5 star is for the service that the restaurant provided.

I have dined at most of the Indian Restaurants in the Valley and crown this place the Champion of Indian food in Las Vegas. 

Eat with Confidence

I have been to other Indian restaurants here in Vegas but by far this place has the most tasties Indian food. Service is also quick compared to other places, definitely 5 stars from me.",nB4FUchmLUQhKkJKAs0Vxg,0,0,5,muH_6AE-ehR3AYkvpuhOgQ
5922899,2016-03-08,1,gTlDDzDEHyDQ6iwjNhpI6A,Look I'm no Indian food connoisseur. What I ate there seem to taste OK.  The big problem for this place is that the bathroom was infested with roaches and they have a glue trap on the floor with a bunch of dead roaches on it.  I don't care if Martha Stewart was in the kitchen cooking I can't eat from a roach infested place. I will say the staff was very nice so unfortunate,fuMLnjEjt3_GM5rc0XJY2Q,3,0,1,CdCuA0BUGE_SGulq4LYAZQ
5929217,2014-07-09,2,gTlDDzDEHyDQ6iwjNhpI6A,"This place is horrible, DO NOT come here!!!
The food is of substandard / poor quality and the service is horrendous.

What restaurant brings their naan as soon as you sit down? Ps - the naan tastes more like bread than naan

And they server never refilled out naan - he was busy watching cricket on his tv behind the counter

The samosas were very oily - refried

The gulab jamun were uncooked in the center - defrost?

There weren't many Indians when we there, which is a tell-tell sign that it is not catered to Indians!",BxNBl3VrzLBAkwpJ3EUgXg,0,0,1,cpI040LIhpyJRKqSIlVCdw
5930925,2018-02-26,0,gTlDDzDEHyDQ6iwjNhpI6A,Good food for Indian in the area. Bit far and middle of nowhere but worth the drive when craving good Indian food. Other places in area not as great.,5rWLrTuOH_coANRmS-t-og,0,0,4,MaAqKIFcp5rL8ekH4ATSCA
5932176,2018-03-21,0,gTlDDzDEHyDQ6iwjNhpI6A,"One of the best Indian food restaurants I have found. I have tried most of the vegetarian dishes and loved them all. Very flavorful dishes. The restaurant atmosphere is not anything fancy or special but, it is cozy. The staff is always friendly and knowledgeable but, the service can be slow depending on how busy it is. The lunch buffet is a great value and one of the few places where they serve samosas as part of the buffet (usually costs extra). I would give the food 5 stars and the staff and atmosphere 3.",PtDadWXwzDJUqXbnY0lO9Q,0,0,4,pipOpl1eynCrBjrqYe2OUQ
5942758,2016-12-26,0,gTlDDzDEHyDQ6iwjNhpI6A,For god's sake can we make a better Indian restaurant. When I say better not just better food but better interior and hygiene. Even if this place has 1000+ reviews it's a run down place compared to any other dining place in us . I am giving one star for such pathetic mentality. Please improve the look and feel,lKnt4suy3aHt_3TVezHILw,0,0,1,3huFZm1nQuI5oRVfmVeoKQ
5944416,2013-01-27,1,gTlDDzDEHyDQ6iwjNhpI6A,"Mt. Everest's food is good. It covers Indian cuisine from different parts of India, which is nice. The lunch buffet is HUGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGE! Like waaaaaaay tons of options. I like that they have sweet rice, because that makes me think of my mom's sweet rice, and well nostalgia makes everything taste better. They have a nice selection of meats too. I've NEVER seen a lunch buffet serve goat meat. Gotta give the props on that one. The naan is fresh and fluffy. I like that they give you both plain and garlic naan. Their roti is decent. Overall, it's a good option when home-cooked Indian food isn't happening.",cuCf5ydDSmXAgAeCf8ELtA,1,1,4,9cbF1zRtEU5oWnvpAQ3lOQ

Everyone else's food smelled so good when we first walked in, i was really excited, even though I don't typically care for Indian food. We ordered a bottle of wine and a few various dinners and naan, which we did wait a little while to actually receive, but it was so worth the wait. Everything was amazing! I had the Chicken Tikka Masala, which I would surely order again. The owner was also there making sure that everything was perfect, he even brought my friend out dessert for her birthday :) We will definitely make the trip back across town to eat here again.",AlrjseLlHFZ3MzQ7S8DbmQ,0,1,5,7xxidCYCg1Wc0YBMeepdFQ
5949682,2015-03-05,0,gTlDDzDEHyDQ6iwjNhpI6A,I love this place!! This is my 4th time coming here. I live near Henderson and it's worth the drive and traffic. I'm 9 months pregnant and am craving spicy lamb curry With mix vegetables. It smells so delicous in here and outside. The customer service is amazing as always. The place is clean and the ambiance is relaxing especially after having a hected day. Will continue my loyalty at this restaruant!,5U0xR6gLovxvnEKfn0eG1Q,0,0,5,Rm0-_o5mhrn3vdNHRf-ChQ

If you're in the mood for Indian and you're in the area it's worth a visit.",NMx2Zxf2aLukc5SoDK5ypQ,2,1,3,41ljjEU1F2PsLcwCZzuK2Q

It's Nepali food more over than actual Indian style .

Food is too oily and also very greasy",1DSsKAwj5DFlXCkAN_-mPw,0,0,3,gum5sTdNrp7AYwzb4tgVOw

So you can probably share with a group of people.  Worth trying if you are in the area, food has great flavor and service was good.
