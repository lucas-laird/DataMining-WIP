For Las Vegas, this is pretty cheap, but it just seems ridiculous to pay this much for Panda Express when a three-entree plate at a Panda Express anywhere else would probably be $7-8. 

If you can afford to do it, I definitely recommend eating elsewhere, but if you're in Vegas and trying to save money, this isn't a bad option since prices are inflated for most chains in Vegas.",amMS0iKEWH22luVKLHPvZQ,1,0,3,m7uRlPrxAdb6MimbvJ8RDA

I had never experienced anything like it. There was a young woman texting on her cellphone while I waited for help. Two people waiting for assistance, a gentleman in front of me and I. I am an avid texter so I decided to be patient while she went on texting.
   Much to my surprise, a young man arrives (in Panda Express uniform) and starts kissing her. It was more than the average kiss...lol! She turns to the counter and a bit frustrated makes an attempt to take our orders.
   By this time, I'm already contemplating just walking away a few more steps to the other food vendors, when a very nice Asian woman comes to the rescue and starts taking our orders. The food was great.
   I know it's fast food Panda Express; I do not expect red carpet treatment here but the kissing part was a little extreme lol! For that reason, I am giving it 2 stars.",tzx0sXXZzn9q3qoq7b4Ujw,3,1,2,xFpwqoPyPO2N5uGhGPCihg

Granted, its on the strip, it was wildly busy, long line; we waited our turn. It was very loud there, so it was a challenge to get our order in; I ended up with rice vs chow mein (which they did correct, and I appreciated that). The problem was with the cashier, Richard. I assume because of the noise level he was having trouble understanding our drink order; however, after two failed attempts to get the order right, he completely lost his cool and began repeating his questions to us in a very pissy tone of voice (the kind of attitude you take when you are talking to someone who you think is very, very stupid) without giving us time to respond. I eventually had to cut him off and tell him we were trying to order he just was not listening. At that point he stopped speaking whatsoever (other than a final, snotty ""thank you"") and finished the transaction. I am a general manager of a large retail store, and whenever I observe any of my associates behaving in this manner with a customer, I remove them from the selling floor and discuss what the issue is that is causing their inappropriate behavior and how to correct it. None of this happened at Panda; Richard simply moved on to the next customer with the same surly attitude. Now I am sure this location makes money hand over fist, and my one opinion wont matter to any of them in the least, but we will never give this store our business again, no matter how badly we are craving Orange Chicken. If you do give this store your business, avoid Richard at all costs.  His offensive belligerent attitude left a very bad taste in our mouths.",toRed-U-LS2kFZiWZMRwoA,0,1,1,3EnntL9SxU5Kehk5Z5Q_3A

Vegas is incredibly expensive and finding any place where you can pay $20 for two people to eat and be satisfied is good enough for me. And you're probably drunk anyways...

I stayed at the Venetian, so I came here twice and it's so busy that the food is always coming out. Does that mean it's fresh? Nope. What it means that at least it's not sitting there for hours. 

I tried the fried rice/noodles (bland), the orange chicken (good), beef & broccoli (good), and the teriyaki chicken - which was the best thing after the girl poured sauce all over it. Also, get the LARGE drink - it comes with free refills. After you're done, have them fill it up again and pour some alcohol in your drank. Be practical!

Really unnecessary. First of, the cup didn't come out of her pocket. Second I told her prior to purchasing it that I wanted to try the drinks, so it's not my fault she grabbed a large cup already. 

The previous night my father in law purchased food and the food tasted like it has been sitting all day and was never replenished. The breading on the walnut prawns were chewy and not crispy anymore and the veggies were soggy. 

I won't be returning to this location ever and wouldn't recommend it to anyone. Not even for a drink. Two days in a row the drinks were flat. Small portions with old tasting food. No thanks.",RwBO2Qupt5rrXe13RsUYPA,2,0,1,R_E634ThHn1eqhNvnBrHwA

The food is fresh wok'ed and hot but watch your wallet because you will be paying through the nose to eat here. Yes, this location has super high food court / tourists prices. My 3 item plate and small soda came to $14.00! Fourteen dollars! I nearly fainted. The food is standard and the employees didn't want to give me a free sample of one of their new dishes -- they looked at me like I was from outer space when I asked for a sample. 

This is one of the only places in the Fashion Show Mall food court that offers free refills that you get to refill yourself. Buy the small soda and refill it all you want. They have Pepsi products. I tried to drink 8 cups of Diet Pepsi to get my money's worth. At least the food was good.",BQkC6RneYfvfG6wRe0hsvQ,0,0,3,L4qyMoFFPeXYxrlsZG6P6g

I ordered the Mandarin Chicken Lo Mein which was basically some chicken, bean sprouts and thick flat rice noodles (kind shaped like udon but longer and squared off).  They actually had to cook this so it took forever...definitely not fast food.  But at least it was fresh and not overly oily.  I also enjoyed the icy iced water they gave me.  

I watched the workers check the temperature of the food, change out the soup and basically clean every 2 seconds in between each customer.  I would have to say this was a fairly pleasant experience.

The food they serve is like any other dishes you would find at any other panda. Nothing too special. 

Their one entree and one side bowl is less than 8 bucks. They also label the amount of calories each dish has. The calorie count can be found on the menu under each dish. (It's in a small white font, so it may be hard to find at first sight.) The calorie count was helpful cause once I saw the calories for the fried rice, I went with the veggie sides, which by the way is less than 90 calories per a serving. I'm in Vegas I need my bikini body!!! (No bloating please!!) Not that the orange chicken helped... 

The lady at the from counter was so cheap! My friend asked for some extra fortune cookies and the lady denied my friend. How cheap is that?!",1_aWNbm6gEgV_Lme_lZ3NQ,1,0,3,0Q7AzRCZPn6Tc0xIoQ8jjw

The second time I got fried rice and sweet fire chicken, which was mostly sweet, but if you add the chili sauce it tastes even better.  The server didn't give me as much chicken as my other friend so I told the manager and he gave me extra :)

The fried rice was good, and garlicky, just the way I like it.

So, when you stroll across Panda Express, the hidden senses would wake up and wpuld unconditionally take your steps in there. Then, upon realizing the varieties of wok curries in there .. you would probably start calculating as how many times would you need to visit to finish those all up :D

Now, people might argue that they have eaten better food at such places and all but given this is a type of makeshift fast food Panda Express is quite impressive.

The wok tossed curries which aren't sweetish are absolutely lovely .. like firecracker chicken, chicken with string beans, broccoli beef, asparagus and meat and a few others.

We were 3 people .. went here twice thus were able to master more than a few dishes :) ..

Took a plate with 2 mains .. once .. covering most of the stuffs and loved them all. Probably the least favourite was the teriyaki chicken, it was a bit dry the first time but absolutely lovely the next.

And with their prices and occasional coupons (if you are charming enough to let them give you :P) the place is pure gold :) ..

And it is lovely to see how efficient the staff is .. I mean the girl behind the counter would serve for you .. take your bills .. if she is free would clean up the place .. mop the few things people carelessly throw around .. and what not..

Overall, I loved the place .. have heard that it is coming to India as well .. sure shot success here :)",lp9ii-j9zST7ongiYvzEwQ,0,0,4,V5H0-sU_YBxwDvlylqvpLQ

The quality of the chinese food there was typical chinese fast food quality. I got their chow mein with broccoli beef and angus beef steaks. The meats themselves were a little too salty for my liking but it blended well with the chow mein. 

I also got the Thai milk tea boba and it was terrible. It had a very watered down flavour and the boba was really hard. They also overload the drink with too much ice and made the flavour even more watered down. I decide to give it 3 stars still since they aren't supposed to be known for boba and their food was alright.",ij8pgp30VMVUiXYCLjdd0Q,1,1,3,t5zOhfX8gn2XgVoOms7bBA

I have been eating at this one for the past two weeks every few days and the food has been good. My only complaint about this one is the fact that the people serving the food all have varying portions. One day I feel like I'm getting barely anything and I'm still hungry, the next day I can't even finish my food. I have been ordering the same dish the past few times and the food has been fresh and very tasty.

I order the 2 item and 1 side combo plate. My side is fried rice when it looks fresh and I accompany that with Sweet Fire Chicken as item 1 and Mandarin Chicken as item 2. 

I was skeptical to try the Sweet Fire Chicken at first because I don't like spicy foods and it has a spicy sticker next to it.. but the guy behind the counter told me it just had a small kick to it. He let me try a piece and it was deicious.
