Went there because of an article i read in Las Vegas magazine but the article was way off and they did not have the food that was featured in article. Talked to long time water at this restaurant who said the have never had the meal featured in article. Would not refer this restaurant to anyone!",b_wWN03l_y2EhnbSdK9Vyg,1,0,1,XfcmiWH4jBpUfFFj6f3EBA

I actually hesitated to write a review because I don't want one of Vegas' best kept secrets to get out, but this place really does deserve 5 stars.  I was a bit worried when Fitzgerald's became The D, but Don B's has stayed the same and is just as good as ever.    The restaurant is conveniently located in the 2nd floor gaming area, but it's very quiet and comfortable inside.  You can't smell any smoke from the casino.

Let me get to the best part - the food!  The filet mignon is hands-down the best steak I've ever had in Vegas.  The prime rib is also excellent.  One of these days I'm going to branch out and try a ribeye.  Each entree includes a generously sized potato (fried, baked, or garlic mashed) or rice, and a bread basket.  You can add a salad, side dish, or soup for only about $6.  In the last 5 years, the price of the entrees have only gone up a few dollars.  Service is always friendly, efficient, and best of all, not pretentious.  They won't rush you to finish your meal.  The tab won't break your bank (unless other Vegas steakhouses, where a steak alone sets you back $60).  Don B's is every bit as good as the Strip's many steakhouses, if not better.   I hope you enjoy it as much as I do.",8SN6B3cUKkonmN2WEabjyA,4,0,5,F1XAoddFHdm1255fmQ1cHg

We decided to wander into The D (formerly the Fitz) to see what the new owners have done with the place. We went upstairs to see Don B's & there was a WALL where the entrance used to be! Turns out Don B's no longer exists & they moved the entrance & made it into a different restaurant! 
SO SAD!!!! It really was one of Vegas' best kept secrets! Guess I really don't have a reason to go into that casino anymore. :-(
On a side note, I really like how Fremont has been cleaned up! The outdoor bars are kinda cool. BUT, even with so many more ""slushie drink stations"", I will STILL only go to The Bayou for that. They have been there at least since 2001 when I moved here, probably a lot longer.",DVXyzEsbFM9nfkvDP6-2IA,0,0,5,mnOPlZ0a5DNTVpKqu4v1lA

The bread was the only thing that truly needed improvement. It's hard and hurts your teeth but the butter was freshly whipped and was like HEAVEN!
