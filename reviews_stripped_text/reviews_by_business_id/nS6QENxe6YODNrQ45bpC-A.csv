Taste- Soft steak with provolone cheese  and nice crunchy bread .

Portion- Got the double Philly loaded with meat and came with lots of salty Fries.

Service - Kind owner helped me with my order and very kind and accompanying me and my friends

32960,2015-02-04,1,nS6QENxe6YODNrQ45bpC-A,"Me and several of my co-workers ordered lunch from Cafe Verdi, as they were one of the few delivery places with somewhat decent reviews in the area. We each ordered the 5 piece chicken finger meal off of Grub Hub. One was an order of garlic, one was for something titled garlic Panamanian, and the last for an order of mild buffalo. When our food arrived, each order was the same (what I assume they would consider just garlic). Luckily the prices were the same for each order. When my co-worker who ordered the food called in to point out their mistake, a rude man told her that garlic and garlic Panamanian are supposed to be the same, that's just how his manager wants it displayed on the website. Maybe they were actually trying to enter it as garlic parmigiano, but due to their obvious and ongoing lack of attention to detail, confused an Italian cheese for a small Central American country. The only order that was credited back was the mild buffalo, as even though the others were two different menu items, they both had garlic on them, so same difference to Cafe Verdi apparently. The overall quality of the food was mediocre at best, and we discovered that their restaurant was once featured on dirty dining. In summation, mediocre food, terrible customer service, geographically illiterate, and filthy. Needless to say, we won't be ordering from Cafe Verdi anymore.",GakftQlV5RiUpKYtnfZR2w,1,0,1,Mq9-NsM7EIqaJvfD8JCF_g

537082,2013-02-11,0,nS6QENxe6YODNrQ45bpC-A,"I had the misfortune of ordering food from Cafe Verdi through Eat24 yesterday and it was by far the worst delivery experience I have had since being in Las Vegas.  The ordering online through Eat24 went very smooth.  They estimated 60 minutes delivery time, which I was not happy with, but since they don't tell you the estimated delivery time until AFTER you order and pay, what can you do?

Well, 60 minutes came and 60 minutes left and no food.  So I used the Chat on Eat24 to find out about the order.  Melissa said she checked with the restaurant and that it was out with the driver and it would be there in a few minutes.  So I waited.  

After waiting 20 minutes, I chatted with Melissa again and this time she told me she would call the restaurant and find out about the order.  Funny, I thought that is what she had done the last time, but this time it did take her longer to answer.  She said it was definitely out with the driver and would be there in about 10 minutes.  So the ""few minutes"" that she had told me 20 minutes ago was now going to be 30 minutes. 

Well, finally the food arrived - Meatball sandwich with frys and a pizza, 95 minutes from when I ordered.  The driver offered no apologies.  I took the food in and put in on a plate and took a bite of the sandwich.  It was ICE COLD!!!  As were the frys.  The pizza was at best warm.  So after 95 minutes, I needed to microwave my $30 dinner.

This is no way to run a business for either Eat24 or Cafe Verdi.  I figure they are both the blame.  This is unacceptable and I will use neither again.  I recommend you do as well.",rRoRimhov-pMPN0uKogGyQ,0,0,1,q6-BQOpj5FhYOBlWSIs0yg

Cafe Verdi is open 24 hours, and the food is okay. It's not top of my list, but it's open and it delivers, and when you can't take lunch before 3.30am, it's the best out there.

However, this past order will be my last, as I placed an order online during a quick 15 minute break, with an estimated time of 30-45 minutes. After a little over an hour I called Cafe Verdi, and after a very lengthy hold time, I was told by what sounded like a very frazzled manager that the delivery guy left as he didn't have a room number. Now, I've ordered from here quite a few times before, and mentioned that I work at the front desk. It's not like a new customer. Never before has that ever been a problem.

The guy offered to knock $6 off the offer, and said it was really busy but he would get it out as soon as he could. Another NINETY MINUTES PASS and it's still not here.

Oh hellz naw.

I called back the restaurant and was put on hold 15 minutes until the phones unceremoniously dumped me. I had myself a little woosah moment because now it had been two and a half hours and I was pissed, and it's not like the food is worth that kind of wait. I called back, finally got the manager again, who sounded like he was surprised (I can act surprised too, buddy), and I cancelled the order.

Ten minutes later, the delivery guy finally shows up, and I told him we cancelled the order. As I walked away I heard him go, ""Oh, come on!"" and he's lucky I was at work because I had half a mind to take him to task for such a pissant response (pardon my language, I have stronger words I'd rather use).

I won't be ordering from here again. It may be the only thing open at 3.30am, but I'd rather get a mocha from Starbucks to hold me over until I can get real food with people who give a hoot.",8prr02BTumjFLYSLmMpO1Q,8,1,1,US_Sc1LUl-A0VDT5ljz95g

First time I received the wrong sandwich, and this time, after I specifically asked if sandwich was hot, and even asked to make sure bread was toasted, I received the sandwich cold including the inside; obviously it was mildly microwaved, while my co-worker's different sandwich was toasted. If I hadn't inquired ahead of time what I was getting, it would be ok, but the fact that not only I asked to make sure sandwich is grilled or pressed, but bread and chicken were microwaved instead of grilled was just wrong. Bread was also a few days old because when I tried to press everything inside so I can take a bite, it started to come apart. 
The only reason I gave it 3 stars is because this time they offered to send me another sandwich, but I declined, because I already ate mine, and did not want to wait another hour to have my lunch. But the thing is that food should not be microwaved under any circumstance, and when you ask for something, you expect to get what is promised. I could have ordered something else, but they confirmed what I asked for...

I've never had a problem with this place, we use to order here all the time after partying the night away. The other night, we come staggering home from fremont street and decide to order our regular, 10 inch pizza and wings. Of course the food itself is not that great, but its 4am and there isn't too many other options at that hour. We waited 2 hours for a food, which we realize, there is lots of other drunks following our foot steps in search of their late-night snacks. After 2 hours, we call and they tell us the driver came, and we never answered the door or the phone. First off, we live in a highrise, with a door a man. The door man ALWAYS calls us before they let someone up. It doesn't matter if your my Grandma or the Cafe Verdi delivery guy, he is going to call and make sure it's okay if they come up. Well, we never got a call. Neither did the driver. According to the front desk, no one ever showed up with a pizza during those 2 hours. The person on the phone from Cafe Verdi goes on to say ""We have had problems with you guys not answering the door before."" Well that is a lie. I don't know if they confused us with someone else, another address, or something. Of course we bitched them out and I got them to reverse the charge on my credit card.

The yelp responses from the manager say it all. He won't respond to my concern and happily ignores all complaining guests but pointlessly responds to 5 start reviews? Lol not smart at all!

I ordered dozens of times, had a problem once, was nice and just wanted a little discount on my next order. Waited and I finally spoke to the manager and was blown away. The management or owner was so pathetic and rude the way you handled it. Literally didn't care or even try to listen to my concern at all. Waited over 2 hours for cold food and got no credit!!???

If they just would of tried I'd of likely ordered again but they'll never see me again!

1 problem which docked off 1 star, we ordered the specialty deal with 1 pizza with 2 toppings, choice of chicken tenders or wings (we got tenders) fries, and a 2 liter. Our pizza barely had any of the 2nd topping which made us have to deal with an all Olive pizza with only a tiny bit of bacon. We aren't cry babies though that like to complain and leave 1 star for something so minor. We do sure hope that next time we will have an even amount of bacon with our olive pizza though. Besides that, the chicken tenders were extremely quality, tasted really good, fries are the bomb diggity, they gave 2 cups of ranch, there we napkins in the bag, and a lot of ketchup packets which made me happy (: and although the pizza lacked the 2nd topping, it was still good pizza! We order through Uber Eats during late night hours and the food always gets here in a timely fashion, so all the people that have bad experiences due to delivery should really use their brain and use a different method of delivery cause Uber Eats always works very well.

Luckily, my trusty Eat 24 app let me know what in the area was a 24 hour delivery service, because I had no desire to get out of bed to get her food. I'm on vacation and she's not pregnant. I love her, but no.

We ordered the double Philly with everything, garlic fries and jalape√±o poppers. Asked for ranch (not listed as a condiment in the app, you have to ask for it in the special instructions) and they delivered. Poppers weren't anything to rave about, just the usual. The garlic fries? I LOVED them. **Warning** if you don't enjoy a STRONG garlic taste and stank breath at 3am, don't order these. If you're a rebel and feel like making your significant other kiss your stank breath mouth before bed (toothpaste doesn't kill it) then balls to the walls! Do it!

But the glory of the whole meal? That Philly. So, so good. And SO MUCH FOOD! Wanna know how good it smelled/tasted? It literally woke my friend up from an alcohol induced coma enough to text me from her room and ask if I was cooking steak. Also, there was enough food to share between all three of us. 

The only thing I feel shitty about is I didn't tip the guy (because he was 20 mins late) and I was sick of hearing my wife whine. So, my message to the delivery driver:

Seeing as in the menu they pride themselves on making the pizza any way you'd like even in quarters! I didn't think that was too outrageous or a lot to ask... and a 2 liter of coke with a side of ranch. Time quoted, 45-60 mins but probably closer to 45 because we're close. Okay cool. Thanks! 

After an hour and a half our food finally showed up. Forgot the 2 liter, they didn't put it on the ticket. Okay as long as I didn't get charged for then whatever I guess. Start getting the food out, no ranch.

The pizza crust is cracker like, the sauce now is overly seasoned with oregano, the vegetarian pizza now includes inedibly large dollops of raw garlic, the strombolis are no longer rolled which sorta makes them not calzones, the wings that arrived were under sauced and under fried. I haven't tried all the other stuff on the menu because why would I? It looks like the new owners have added a slew of Mediterranean dishes which I haven't tried. For all I know they might be good.

As the only place in my area that I could find to deliver, my hopes were not high. I ordered via grub hub at 2:51, they were supposed to arrive at 3:55, and finally at 4:10 it was here. I must say that while the food was lukewarm and 15 minutes late, it was actually quite tasty. 

The personal pizza was smothered in salty cheese ans the sauce was light and sweet. The crust had a slight sweetness as well and was soft and pillowy like a bread stick.

The mozzarella sticks were lightly breaded with no crunch. The ranch dressing (as requested) complimented the flavor perfectly.

Even the chocolate cake beat the typical plastic-wrapped pizza joint standard. It was fluffy and not too sweet. 

It all reminded me of the kind of junk food you find at at a baseball game- a greasy, artery-clogging,  guilty pleasure. This place is undoubtedly a go to for Superbowl parties and hangovers. The prices are great too- but unless you like to waste money DO NOT order delivery!! What should have been a $15 meal came out to almost $30 with a staggering $8 delivery fee and a 20% tip.

First off anyone who would order from this cave must be desperately hungry and not thinking there options through. Which I was. Here's the low down with this dumpster... 
I made an order at 9:13 AM the food arrived around 11 am. What a joke.
The order was for chicken tenders NOT SPECIFIED TO BE DRENCHED IN HOT SAUCE, but to include an order of the 3 sauces. Ranch, hot sauce and BBQ sauce.
The chicken tenders came  lately around 11 am. 2hours later.
They where DRENCHED in hot sauce, to the point of an uneatable marinade of sloppiness. Ranch never came and poor quality bbq sauce. 
The eclair was the only eatable thing but was too sweet and tasted like an artificial sweetened product of poor quality for the price of 3.25. (not worth it)
The french fries where literally damp. Soggy and uneatable. There where even flecks of green mold on the edges of the fries. I'm surprised this place is approved by the health code in las vegas. 
Now this is where it gets even more crazy and im not writing this because i have any personal issues, im writing this because of how they handled there business with me.
I had almost cried when my order came because i was just so hungry and it was terrible i couldnt eat it. I called the place to ask for an exchange of chicken tenders. I told the man how i ordered the sauces and how they did not specify they prepared them drenched in hot sauce. The man started SCREAMING and shouting at me and actually insulted me by calling me ""stupid""! I said look, either way your going to have to fix my order to plain tenders or give me a refund. He said he will not fix the order and that If i want another order I will have to pay for it?? how absurd is that! How can they mess up an order and not offer a replacement? That is foreign to me in the restaurant business! I didn't even eat the chicken because of the incorrect preparation. I then felt so sour in my stomach because after being called stupid by lawrence he then raised his voice again in a hostile nature when i asked for a refund. He said good luck trying to get a refund! Well I called  my bank and made sure I did. I had to hang up on him because of him screaming and shouting. It was so bizarre.

My mozzarella sticks were fine but my onion rings literally had NO onions in them at all it was just breading, I thought maybe it was just a few but every single one had no onion at all. Our total was just under $30.

5199479,2011-04-03,5,nS6QENxe6YODNrQ45bpC-A,"Things to celebrate: It's open 24-hours. Our service was really charming. The gentleman behind the counter paid more attention to what I wanted than my husband. My husband said, ""We'll take half vegetarian,"" and he said, ""I think she wanted spinach."" He was right! (I even appreciated the part where I heard him yelling ""F*** this. The only people who are suffering are the customers,"" I couldn't quite understand the problem, but it had something to do with cold fries. Regardless, I support anyone who supports a customers' right to hot fries!) The flavor was delicious, meaning the sauce, toppings and cheese were all doing their job. 

Things to lament: If you are dining in, the surroundings are a little shabby. The crust, although it is thin, is a bit doughy, not crisp, which means it is great for dipping in a sauce of your choice, but not a superb pizza vehicle. It was easy to cut, though! I got a little pizza belly following our late night meal here. If it weren't for the post meal feeling, I may have stuck with 4 stars.

I saw two fellow diners noshing on some Caesar salads that looked big and fresh. I was a bit envious. 

Overall, definitely A-OK, and the place for your 24-hour pizza delivery needs. I noticed plenty of orders heading out to the casinos when 11pm rolled around!",qewG3X2O4X6JKskxyyqFwQ,9,3,3,MH7zg3kc6GVDBHkCQqGblA

Way too much sauce however. Found myself scraping off most of the sauce just to eat them.

He goes to his car to get change brings back the change throws the change on the desk and says to her, ""next time pick up the food yourself"" how unprofessional is that??? 

we will never be ordering from Cafe Verdi again. When we contacted the manager nothing was done. A half A*# apology was given making an excuse for the driver stating he was stressed out. WHO CARES! we all get stressed out but you don't treat your loyal customers poorly,

After browsing around yelp for about 30minutes I ended at cafe Verdi. 

The online ordering had some issues, so I ended up calling the restaurant to order. Phone gets picked up and she informs me that the wait was going to be 1 hour 15mins due to there only being one driver. Since I prefer ordering in advance I was fine with it. Very polite, took my order, made it quick and before hanging up once again informed me with the wait time. So very satisfied with her service. 

I ended up waiting about 1 hour and 45 minutes. By the time the order was here, I was starving, looking forward to my food. However very nuke and though the bowl looked huge half of it was sauce, with very little noodles. As hungry as I was, and the what I had to go through, and there not being much food to it I still managed to not finishing it which the bread and sauce went to the dogs plate. 
However quite satisfied with tiramisu. Highly doubt it was made in the restaurant, but I will give credit for it satisfying my sweet tooth. If it weren't for that and my mimosa I had with my meal, I would have had to cooked something up for myself. 

This time I had gotten delivery but it's not that I was dissatisfied with the entire meal so I will be going in as dine-in and give it another try.",AsqGY-mvNg4KEyIEtjkQow,5,1,2,arLdLnyhSMhm2nIL_3KmtA
