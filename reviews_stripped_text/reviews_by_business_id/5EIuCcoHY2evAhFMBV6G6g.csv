The selection of dishes is very limited and not too exciting.  The food is passable.  The service is actually pretty bad - they have food runners who never know which person or even which table the food goes to and waiters that are experts at zooming past you avoiding eye contact.

61096,2012-10-11,0,5EIuCcoHY2evAhFMBV6G6g,"So this past Saturday I joined my friend and a group of her friends for dinner here. I was kind of bummed as I was ready to get my part-tay on, but they had been drinking for a couple days already and were already  tired and worn out. I think this is why they hadn't figured out where they wanted to eat and go out on a Sat night, which you know you can't do in Vegas if you expect to go somewhere good. They also didn't really feel like searching out a place outside the Venetian, which is why we ended up here. I kind of had a let down feeling as soon as we walked in. It was only about half empty and really quiet - just not Vegas on a Saturday night. 

Our waiter was nice enough and I felt bad for him because this group was really set on not getting any fun cocktails, apps, desserts, so I give him a star for putting up with us. He was really trying - I hope he gets a job at a more popular place soon.

But other than him, everything was kind of lackluster. I ordered the special - salmon, which I thought was good. I also had a cosmo, which was right on point - thank you bartender (although the glass was not even half full). The prices were ok for what we had so no real complaints.

However, I hate to say it, but both my friend (she also ate the salmon) and I had an upset stomach soon after eating. No one else in the party did, which makes me think something about the salmon was really off - I did notice that both of our pieces were very inconsistently cooked. Anyway, I still thought it tasted good but it definitely killed our night, as my friend was way more ill than me and she went back to her room. Yes, on a Saturday night, so you know this wasn't just feeling a little out of it. F me (and poor her!). But on a good note, I still had fun gambling for a bit before going to my room (the next morning was absolute hell on my stomach though). 

Bottom line - go somewhere else if you want any resemblance of a fun Vegas vibe. If you want some place quiet and you have a robust stomach, by all means...",ZJCWUrxd2YzEj5yLshYn8A,0,0,2,tPNRE0zFypRY64QLwV6fvA

I had the burger (French Restaurants make the best burgers) and it was delicious. The fryer was broken so it came with breakfast-type roasted potatoes, which weren't very complementary. For dessert I had a scoop of vanilla ice cream with my french press coffee over the top, which was amazing. 

My primary gripe with this place is how old it feels. The dining room we ate in felt like someone's Grandma's house, and not in a good way. The formalities like table scrapping were nice, but seemed forced and awkward. Especially because the only other table had kids and they were running and screaming everywhere.

We walked in with a little trepidation as there were no other customers on a Saturday night.  One single thought racing into my head, ""My God, what have I done"".  I can assure you though, the reason for the emptiness was indiscernible to me as I left quite content.   Both my companion's and my steak were cooked to perfection.  The wine list was adequate to entice a wide variety of tastes.  Our dessert was better than acceptable, but not memorable.  The fresh dinner bread was plentiful and warm (even at the last seating~ 9:45pm ish).  Our champagne was served at the perfect temperature... something usually forgotten in the bustle of a busy evening.

588444,2010-12-31,0,5EIuCcoHY2evAhFMBV6G6g,"My friend and I came here on Christmas Day for their pre-fix Christmas menu, and it was our first time dining here.  We decided to each order something different from the courses so we could try more items.  I opted for three courses, while he chose four...

First course:
- ""Lobster Bisque"" (lobster medaillons, creme fraiche) - this was pretty good, the bisque itself was flavorful and not too thick.  There were small pieces of lobster, could have used more.
- ""Warm white & green asparagus"" (w/poached egg, truffle creme) - okay, asparagus was just like the name stated, warm.  I like my asparagus cooked so wasn't a fan of the crunchyness.  The poached egg was the best part of this dish.

Second course:
- ""Seared Sea Scallops"" (truffled orange braised endive, orange spice) - the scallops themselves were good, a nice flavor from the grill.  My friend loved this dish, and loved the orange marmalade-type stuff that came to compliment it.  I thought it was bitter and continued to eat the scallops minus orange stuff.

Main Course:
- ""Black Cod"" (artichoke barigoule, linguine tomato pasta, olive oil, lime) - this was the dish I chose.  Cod was seared and had a nice flavor to it, not over or under cooked.  Pasta was good, although it was your standard linguine.  I liked the taste the olive oil/lime sauce added to the dish.
- ""Rib-eye steak"" -  I think this is what my friend got, either this or filet...can't remember since I didn't try it because I don't eat land-roving animal (only fish/seafood).  Whatever it was he seemed to enjoy it and cleaned his plate. He said it was cooked just right.

Dessert:
- ""Cheese selection"" - I chose this one.  It came with 5 different types of cheeses (a bleu, goat, fontina, brie and can't remember what else), jam, tiny raisin toasts & walnuts.  The brie was my favorite, blue was typical. I didn't try the jam, not a huge fan, and the toasts were nothing too special.  The walnuts made a great compliment when eaten with the goat and brie.
- ""Spiced Pumpkin Confit"" (cinnamon-pumpkin ice cream, streusel) - this, I thought, was disgusting.  I can't remember exactly what I didn't like about it since I only tried one small bite, but I remember it being somewhat bitter and the flavors didn't go together.  He liked it.  Guys will eat anything.

As for wine I had a glass of pinot noir, as I do w/almost every dinner out, and it was good.  I cannot remember which one I had...

Our server was on top of our needs, although it seemed like quite a bit of time between courses.  She was somewhat cold and not overly friendly.  The restaurant itself has a nice feel to it, a somewhat romantic envirmonent and kind of old world, classic french design.  There are many little side rooms connected to the main dining room they were seating people in, or can be used as private dining rooms.  We were seated in one of those smaller side rooms & had it all to ourselves...it felt a little secluded & we were the only ones in there.

Overall, this was a good experience due to the food.  Prices are comparable, maybe a tad more, to Mon Ami Gabi & Comme Ca.  I have eaten at both and I still highly prefer Mon Ami, Comme Ca would be my second choice, and Pinot third.",9xBDxlvOPBT8I2L9lVSqxg,2,1,3,NmJwQ6k6Ww8Bmt_3xbUkYg

My husband started with the caprese.  It tasted like it had recently been thawed (parts of it were still partially frozen).  The tomatoes were mealy, disgusting.  For my entree, I had the Veal Cheeks.  The meat was grey and tough, it also tasted like it had previously been frozen and possibly cooked in a microwave.  I guess the sauce was ok.  My husband had the diver scallops which he said were ok.  He tried my Veal cheeks and we both agreed that they tasted like the mystery meat found in high school cafeterias across the country.

Not only did he name them but was very informative about where they come from and answered all my questions! John even made great wine pairing suggestions! I can guarantee that I bought more wine just to try out his suggestions after the first one was spot on! I don't know if they do that with every table but if so it's genius! If you get to eat here I also suggest the escargot! It was so delicious we scrapped the plate clean. Maybe I will order the charcuterie next time and see who surprises me with a guest appearance this time!

Went here for a group dinner on a Saturday night. It was the only steak place I could get a last minute reservation. Now I know why. Our group was seated and browsing the menu when we saw a roach crawling across the table. Being the girly girl that I am, I screamed EEEWWW and told my friend to kill it. Everyone in the dining room looked at us all snooty because of the ruckus we caused, but umm eeew roach! What would you like me to do quietly and calmly ask it to go away?! 

Anyhow, the waitress apologized and moved us to another table. We should have left, but being on a schedule and all, we reluctantly ordered our food. Our table had porterhouse steak, chicken, and a fish entree. Good size portions, some were seasoned ok while others were too salty. Overall, didn't hate it but didn't particularly like anything either. 

The service of the staff was ok. The guy refilling our drinks and bringing our bread was on point.  However the waitress could have been more attentive given it was not crowded and she should be kissing our asses after the roach incident. The Manager never showed up at our table to apologize nor offer a discount. I probably should have complained but I don't know I just didn't. At a place like this I guess I felt like I shouldn't have to fish for a discount. I know at a ""dumpy"" chain restaurant like Claim Jumpers I'd have an apology and free something automatically.

Located between the Palazzo and Venetian hotels(on the concourse that joins the two) Pinot Brasserie had all the makings for a great night out but fell short when it came to the level of service but the food was spot on. 

First of all, the bar. We sat at the bar and tried to get a drink. The bartender was busy wiping glassware and talking to one of the servers. Hello? We're here AND we have a show to get to so we were on a bit of a timeline. 

When we finally got served, the service was functional but certainly not personable or friendly. Maybe the bartender was going for the ""French aloof"" affect- but he couldn't pull off anything other than disinterested. 

We were seated in the corner of the restaurant at the perfect table. In looking around it was clear the care that went into picking out the interior of the space. Word has it that celebrity chef Joachim Splichal actually went to France to pick out several of the pieces. True or not- the ambiance is delightful as you are able to sit in these intimate little rooms like being in someones home. 

Unfortunately, our server seemed to have the same attitude as the bartender. We also told her we had a show to get to and she just shrugged and said she would try to hurry up the kitchen. Now just so you have all the facts- the show was at 9 and we were in the restaurant at our table at 7 so I really didn't think this was going o be a problem. 

But the star of the evening was the food. We started with the Lobster Bisque. Absolutely decadent and delicious! For my entree- I went with the black cod served over a bed of tomato pasta. Perfectly done and also delicious. How could the kitchen turn out such great food only to be served by servers who really didn't care, I wondered? 

Dinner for 3 ran about $300 including cocktails. And did we make the show? Yep, with about 30 minutes to spare. 

The food was terrific, the ambiance delightful. Too bad they couldn't have servers that matched the rest of the place. For if they did- this certainly would have been a 4 star review.",ZYZNcugF3xUEGyLOVGiZ0Q,1,1,3,NrujAqEmUs0Hb9y_LQCX2A

Wife had onion soup, REALLY onion-y.  Tasty but after so many bites, she had to leave it alone as it was too overwhelming.

Many of us ordered filet mignon and were underwhelmed.  It was far from bad, but for the ducats you're throwing down, and the expectations of a Joachim Splichal joint.... well, now we're venturing into ""for real?"" territory.  I have had better meat at several steakhouses that are less expensive.  It was a good filet.  But far from great.  In fact, ordered it medium and it came out at least medium rare, possibly even rare (on the border.)  

Wife had pumpkin ravioli, which was pretty tasty, but inconsequentially portioned for the price.  We get it, European style, but, we ARE in the US now, so a happy medium might be achieved with a bit more bang for the buck.  3, count 'em, 3 ravioli squares.  

Was nice to get a sampler of complimentary desserts (very much a fan of the tarte tatin and creme brulee, but the chocolate souffle was not that good.  Significantly underwhelmed, and both samples were left unfinished.  My advice is also to stay the hell away from the strawberries and goat cheese.... holy God, what a horrific afterbirth of taste.  

We had some decent wine and not too bad of a glass of muscat for dessert.  Took forever to get a mixed drink at the table (nearly 20 minutes.)  And we went on a Sunday night when the place was 2/3 empty.

We certainly had a ""good"" meal, but I've had so much better at a fraction of the price, both in Vegas and back home.

I advise the carnivores to hit up Lawry's (it's off the Strip but if you've been, you know you're always getting quality) or Fix at the Bellagio.",j8ZZTMPIY9S3S3HV9862gw,0,0,2,ir7ZADpeND0OLPPi0oCnKQ

 My boyfriend and i had a later reservation 930pm (restaurant closes at 10pm)... and we were a bit nervous that we would be rushed. To our surprise, we were not rushed at all, and  were able to enjoy a delightful dinner in the front room.

The restaurant has a rather extensive wine list - moderately priced. We enjoyed a bottle of Pinot Grigio. 

We started off our meal with a caprese salad, field greens and crab claw cocktail.  The caprese salad was amazing. I love caprese salads and it was the best mozzerella cheese that I have ever had. The tomato was poached whole in a white balsamic dressing. My boyfriend had the field greens with carmelized pears, pecans and a not too sweet dressing.  The crab claw cocktail was served with a not too spicy, fresh cocktail sauce. The crab claws were large and very meaty.

For our entrees we got the ribeye steak and lobster tail. For $45 my boyfriend said that his ribeye was cooked to perfection. My lobster tail came deshelled and cooked perfectly as well.  Both portions were larger than other restaurants. 

Our meals ended with a great chocolate souffle cake with a great sauce. Definitely try the chocolate souffle if you are here! 

Service was absolutely great- as mentioned above, we were one of the last tables at the restaurant, but our server didn't rush us at all.  Our bus boy was very attentive with our water, plates, bread. Over all had a great dinner experience.

I will definitely be back again!

Had the baby field greens with smoked duck breast with cranberry. 
Green lip mussels - Served cold.. and super delicious.
Surf and Turf (~ 6-8 oz Filet and half a Maine lobster (maybe 1 or 1 1/4 lb lobster)
Cheese assortment
Black pepper chocolate creme brulee.

If you gotta choose only one appetizer between the salad and the mussels... go for the mussels.  The surf and turf was nicely prepared.  (Steak was perfect at medium rare.)  Lobster was cooked with a ton of butter, so at least be aware if that's not your thing.  I'll eat lobster any which way.. so it's all good.

And the black pepper chocolate creme brulee is something unique.  A nice blend of spiciness and creaminess.  I'm not a big chocolate dessert kind of guy, but this was nice and different.",gT95gl8aW69A_76ayn_YDA,0,0,5,9pPZ8OWgfiEaK4I2nRgF8A

The great thing about Pinot Brasserie or any of its sister restaurants is that on the boulevard of fine dining and trendy restaurants, its not trying to be either. Its a restaurant that focuses on mainly the food and the dining experience. Its not about being seen or one more restaurant to cross off your list. 

I came during the week to have our ""ladies who lunch"" lunch..LOL. My bestie had her newborn with her so we decided on a later lunch to avoid the crowd just in case baby would start crying etc. The lunch crowd was about dying down and the hostess was so nice and smart to shove us in a quiet corner away from most of the guests. 

This is what we ordered: 
Escargot - It was good, not the best we've had, but good. 
Oysters - Excellent, wish we had more. Fresh and light. 
Nicoise Salad - Seared ahi tuna served along with all of the standard accoutrements. 
Mussels - It was good, not the best we've had, but good. It came with perfectly seasoned fries. 
Gratin Dauphinois - Scalloped potatoes...Excellent. 

Service: 
Everyone we came into contact with was so pleasant and helpful. The only annoying thing is that I asked if my salad came with croutons/bread. I told her that I couldn't have it. It came out with a slice of bread topped with tepanade and an anchovy. Ugh!! I'm okay with just removing the bread. I'm not as sensitive as those with celiac disease, but it was just as annoying. Not her fault, she just wasn't aware or informed  with dealing food allergy/sensitivity. Thats a management  or training issue.

We came here with some clients on Thursday evening at 6:30... there were 7 of us.

The night started off promising with friendly wait staff. 

We ordered a few appetizers..:
Lobster Bisque... good
Marinated Artichoke... OK
Caesar Salad... Pretty good
Escargots...  good

For Dinner we all tried a few things.  I got the roasted half chicken. and found that it was rubbery.  Yuck. 

My issue here is with the service.

We ordered 2 bottles of wine, that took FOREVER to arrive.  After we placed our order, we had VERY limited access to our server.  We wanted to order dessert, but it took so long that by the time the server finally appeared again we had decided to ask for the check.. getting the check was another wait.. when at that point all we wanted to do was leave.

1865745,2008-01-03,0,5EIuCcoHY2evAhFMBV6G6g,"I ate here on New Year's Eve. They set all the place settings with top hats and crowns which said ""Happy New Year"", a horn and a lei. The ceiling was covered in gold and silver balloons. 

They had a special menu for that night. Basically, my carnivorous tendencies are limited to chicken and fish, but no shellfish. Nothing on the menu for that night had either of these two options. When we made the reservation we made sure it would be fine for me to order off the regular menu. After we sat down and told the waitress this, she looked rather shocked. She checked with the chef and he said he had the materials to make me a French onion soup and a rotisserie chicken. The soup was good. The broth was hearty, there was lots of cheese and it was very filling. Next came half of a chicken on a very generous bed of mushrooms and accompanied by a gigantic cone of french fries. I love mushrooms and they tasted great with the chicken. I also enjoy fries so I wasn't going to turn them away, but I'm confused about how or why they added to the meal. They seemed sort of independent, like a rebellious teen forced to be there.

My fiancee had an oyster soup, cheese ravioli with truffle oil and rare fillet Mignon. He liked the soup and I can confirm that the ravioli were tasty. He said the fillet Mignon was the best he'd ever had, better than at Fleur De Lys. 

For desert I ordered the chocolate souffle. By the time we were ready for desert they ran out of the souffle and without asking me which desert I would prefer our waitress brought me one of the other 3 deserts. She brought me the same one my fiancee had ordered. It was a chocolate molten cake which tasted exactly like the one you can get at Chili's. I would have preferred one of the other deserts such as creme brulee, but as she plopped this one down in front of me and told me it was ""very good, it's like a chocolate molten cake"" I stared dubiously up at her. 

The other awkward thing about this place is that our waitress smirked through our dinner, as though we were amusing her and to be tolerated.  She especially seemed to enjoy when I ordered a half bottle of wine to drink by myself.  Maybe I'm wrong about this, but I don't think I am. It was very odd. 

I would go again because the food is good, the atmosphere is relaxed, we aren't likely to get the same waitress and if you sit in the interior dining room, you can't see the constant parade of tourists.",v2o0W7SerYsFxA_vuB0UtA,0,0,4,jmAcbcJVYa5XJb1rYw0hEQ
1880194,2007-04-17,0,5EIuCcoHY2evAhFMBV6G6g,"I have to admit that in the past, I've had problems finding a memorable dining experience in Las Vegas. Pinot changed all that.

The dining room was comfortable. It seems that many new restaurants that want to the diner to feel a sense of history try too hard. This was not the case with Pinot. Although I knew that this restaurant has only been here for a few years at the most, it had an ambiance that suggested decades of service. 

Their wine list was more than impressive. It had to have been at least 20 pages long and featured wines from the four corners of the earth. One could get a tad bit carried away in its pages. The bottles range from around $40 to well over $1500.  Thankfully they also serve wine by the glass. We each had a nice glass of a Barbera/Merlot blend which was $10/glass. 

As for the food:  My wife and I decided to order a half dozen oysters along with an endive salad as appetizers.  The oysters were fresh and full of flavor.  The endive salad was astonishing. The endives were garnished with walnuts, Roquefort, and orange zest; which was an unusual, albeit brilliant, combination. I had never tasted a combination of endives and orange zest in the past, but they compliment each other. The mixture of the sweetness of the orange and the bitterness of the endives is a taste that everyone should experience.

Dinner: My wife had a short rib that took little coaxing to come off the bone. I'm convinced that all she needed to do was snap her fingers and the meat would have complied. The short ribs tasted like pot roast. That should be enough for you. I had the braised ginger-citrus pork belly, which melted in my mouth. 

Dessert: The chocolate souffle. We honestly didn't think we would be able to have dessert. However, the waiter suggested the souffle and mentioned that it would take roughly fifteen minutes to bake. Deciding that we weren't in any hurry, we decided that a souffle was a great idea. Besides, fifteen minutes is ample time to let our stomachs do some digesting.   I can assure you that it was well worth the wait.

There were a few snafus during the meal. They brought out the wrong salad at first, but quickly replaced it. Plus, they need experience in making a cappuccino. The one that  was served to me was more like a latte with thick foam floating atop, which is not a cappuccino.  Neither of these incidents took away our pleasant dining experience.

All in all, the complete meal cost $135 without tip, which is reasonable for a restaurant of this caliber.

I ate here for lunch. My friend and I shared an appetizer and entree. I ordered the escargo, and he ordered the leek tart.

My escargo was bland. Bland Escargo!? Really? It was so bland that I scooped up some of the butter from my bread and put in with the sauce. It helped, but I was still disappointed.  

The leek tart and side salad, on the other hand, was delish! The balsamic dressing they use was to die for.  While our waiter came to speak with us we dropped the whole Culinary students thaang on him and he told us that he had gone to Le Cordon Blue....we got a good laugh because the pastry teacher he had transferred to our school, and we had fun picking on him.

Later when we were done he gave us our check and told us that management would like to buy us a desert. I looked at my friend as said,""It is my birthday, why not?!""  He gave us the desert menu.  Creme brulee? Ive done it a million times, Cheesecake? Can get it anywhere. Souflee? Would take too long.....but, oh whats this? Roasted strawberries with a balsamic reduction infused with mint and vanilla, served with fog goat cheese?! I'm there.

We ordered it, and soon the waiter came out telling us that management would like to buy us each a glass of wine to pair with our desert. 

Yes please!

I don't know wines yet, (give me another year to start on that) but it was a sparkling wine that went perfect with the AWESOME desert. Woah! Those flavors blew me away!

Oh yeah...Pinot Brasserie. Having been back to Vegas a few times now since my first uneventful marriage almost 10 years ago, I have to say I'm getting more impressed with the Venetian and seeing a definite separation of class between this and other hotels. Maybe I'm getting older, maybe I'm getting wiser, and maybe I'm just getting a hell of a lot pickier. 

I can't remember much of my meal at this point, but looking back at the meal it still leaves me with a smile so that's a good sign. I remember the hostess being especially gracious and warm and the server being very detail oriented and professional which added to the air of a certain class the room gave off. I'm not saying, it was classy but it definitely was quiet, serene and allowed myself and my boyfriend to have a nice meal away from the dreadful gambling floor only a few meters away.

I'd suggest you pass the french onion soup if you're on a date. You'll never get a graceful bite out of it.

We tried a few places and not happy with what the others were charging for the room fee and all of the other fees they like to add, we decided to go try Pinot Brasserie and see if we liked the food enough to have the reception. 

So we tried the place and both agreed the food was tasty. So we decided to start the process of booking the reception. They didn't have any hidden costs or added costs once we started this process either like other places in Vegas. This was by far the easiest and best process of the wedding to put together. Everything else had some bumps in the road but not here. Relieved our stress big time. 

Victoria was the event lady and she was amazing to deal with. My wife handled all of the communication with her and couldn't be happier. Which means I couldn't be happier. We also had a few things we wanted to do like bring in an iPod and amp to play music during and that wasn't a problem. We decided we'd like to have a candy bar as a thank for the people coming. Another thing that wasn't a problem. They made sure it was set up. Everything went smoothly. The waitress who was the main one for our table was probably the best waitress I've ever had. She was great I wish I could remember her name. 

We paid for an open bar for 3 hours and another thing that just went smoothly. The drinks kept coming and everyone who came enjoyed themselves. Cost was as low as they probably could go. Everyone was complimenting the food, especially the garlic fries, which are one of those things that are very hard to please everyone. The steak was cooked perfectly and our vegetarian guests also really enjoyed their dish. 

If its good food you want, they have it. If you want good food and a wonderful place to have a reception, they can handle it.

Our waiter, Fab, was as attentive as we wanted him to be.  He poured the 2001 Joseph Phelps Insignia we brought in as quickly as we wanted it and let us linger before we settled in and ordered...the 20 ounces of Chateaubriand with both Béarnaise and Bordelaise sauce for two.

photo 1-1Our steak, ordered medium, had been sliced and placed on a medium-sized platter over roasted potatoes, spinach and mushrooms.  We didn't need to order appetizers, salads, soups or sides as the dish would definitely cover us.  Fab suggested we dip into both sauces - which we did - for the perfect blend.  I noted some dill in the Béarnaise that made it that much more tasty.

We also offered Fab a taste of our wine and he poured himself a splash.  He lingered as long as we wanted him to...as we discussed wine and ended up sharing photos of our children.

Note: When we chatted about wine Fab mentioned how people sometimes tell him what they smell or taste in a wine before sharing it.  He said that makes the experience entirely subjective.  He himself suggests coffee following a meal and described one selection as, if I remember right, a dark earthy roast with a hint of honey.  He said, with a sly smile, that he made up the honey part!

After our leisurely meal Fab brought us a Belgian chocolate soufflé with vanilla sauce on him, as a thank you for sharing our wine.  Rich and warm, it was impossible not to eat the entire dessert though we were amply full from devouring our main dish.

Then, you guessed it, we couldn't resist a little coffee - only because it was guaranteed fresh as it is served in individual French presses.  I don't recall which we had, mine was decaffeinated and my husband Eddie's was full strength, but Fab did serve it with a small metal pitcher of honey that had been warmed and slightly watered down.  (He didn't need to tell me that using it would add that hint of honey we were looking for.)

In conclusion I'd have to say the combination of outstanding service (Fab was assisted by Javier in bringing and removing our plates) and an equally outstanding menu.  In a place like Vegas, where the experience is everything, it was nice to find an experience that we would welcome experiencing again and again.

Joachim Splichal transported his Pinot restaurant from LA to The Venetian, and it is one of the classiest places in town.  Elegant dark wood, brass and copper accents, mirrors, and other decorative objects contribute to the Parisian bistro atmosphere.  Incredible food (enjoyed a lobster sandwich for lunch), excellent service, rarely a crowd, and, BTW, children under 12 eat free here!

The service was fast and efficient.  We had to wait maybe a little longer than was ideal between a course or two but overall it was great.  I think we were lacking in bread at one point (this was important to the oyster eaters).  

Overall, the food was wonderful, too.  I ordered lobster bisque, crab cake, halibut and crepes Suzette.  Everything I had was delicious.  My dining companions ordered some other items and they pretty much enjoyed everything.  One thing they absolutely raved about was the oysters on the half shell.  They loved the sauce that was served with them.

They have a very extensive wine list which focuses on wines from California, Italy, and France but has many others, too.  The list also had quite a few at lower price points and then, of course, a lot as the prices crept up.  There were some very high-end choices, as well.  We chose a lower priced wine (a Dolcetto) and it was very enjoyable.  There were plenty of wines available by the glass but there were, of course, a lot more in bottles.  I would like to take some time and venture through the wine list here.

Overall, this was a very pleasant dining experience.  The price was very reasonable for what we got and I would definitely return.",tIP5tmJzK2jFKJh6lE-_Ag,2,2,4,U0lE6IRjqsJy0JoU-FQ3Dw

2693801,2010-02-11,0,5EIuCcoHY2evAhFMBV6G6g,"The wife and I had a pleasant dinner at Pinot during a recent stay at the Venetian.

We started by splitting an endive salad... they literally split it onto two plates, which was a nice touch, but the two halves were so small as to be almost comical.

My wife had the lobster for her main, and it was really perfect. She did her best to extract every morsel while remaining as ladylike as possible.

My entree was duck breast, and it was fairly good, but there was a thin vein of gristle that kept it from being among the best I'd ever had.

We ended up skipping dessert because of the richness of our entrees, but we did have a couple of nice glasses of wine. I've since forgotten the producer, but mine was a delicious Washington Pinot Noir, while my wife had champagne.

Our server was very nice and patient with us, which is always appreciated.

We really like the atmosphere at Pinot--it is elegant without being stuffy.

Odd that both times I've been it wasn't very crowded - perhaps they get a very late (post 9pm) dinner crowd.  Their caesar salad wrapped in prosciutto is beautiful, and served with a white anchovy (don't say ""eewe, anchovies"" - it's really quite delicious) and some crunchy bread sticks for croutons.  The lamb was amazing - perfectly cooked to a rosy pink medium rare, and melts in your mouth.  The service was great, even though we had a very large group.

The food was actually pretty good overall, with a generous portion of moules mariniere soaking in a hot tub of butter, wine and garlic, and a Flintstones-sized short rib that was fall-off-the-bone tender.  The only negatives were the duck breast which was tough and chewy, the service which was painfully intermittent especially given how empty the restaurant was, and the utter lack of soul and character.

2873122,2012-12-16,1,5EIuCcoHY2evAhFMBV6G6g,"This place had so much potential.  Too bad the service was so bad.  The waitress started off strong.  Great personality, lovely table side manner. Took our drink order, in this case 3 tap waters with lemon.  I neglected ask for no ice. But that's my fault. So attempted to remedy  that by asking for a cup of hot water.  We also requested 3 straws. 

On to the food.  The bread was warm tasty and the butter was firm yet melted easily into the carby treats.

As starters we had 1 Caesar salad, 1 order of escargot and 1 lobster bisque. All 3 items were generous in portions with very good flavor. Still no hot water or straws. My daughter was only 1/2 finished with her lobster bisque when our entrees arrived, In fact all of us were still working on our appetizers/starters when the main course appeared so  they began to remove items from the table (while our forks/spoons were still in mid air). So before I could blink  the lobster bisque was whisked away to make room for my daughters entree.  When I protested they did offer to bring it back but it was already out of view so never mind. Still no straws or hot water

Main course was sea scallops, creamed spinach (that's what daughter wanted as entree) and mussels.  The creamed spinach was more like spinach with watery cream.  If you have ever enjoyed the creamed spinach from the Palm, then you'll understand why steamed spinach floating  in cream was such a disappointment. Didn't eat.  Server saw that we were not eating it and removed from table and our bill.

Sea scallops were over salted and served under cooked fingerling potatoes. Didn't finish.  My motto is why waste calories and carbs on bad food. 

I did not try the mussels but husband and daughter said the were very tasty and there seemed to be a lot of them.  No  separate bowl was given to discard the shells so the shells ended up precariously perched on the edges of the plate.

As I was picking disappointingly at my food and DD and DH were still eating, they started to clear the table.  Seriously? They were mid bite when the waiter started removing plates, only after he had the plates in is hands did he say: were you still working on that?  Meanwhile still no straws and no hot water.

Needless to say we skipped dessert.  Bill was $97.00 with no drinks, no dessert, no coffee, no straws and no hot water.  I have seriously had better service at Applebees.",wlvyqW9J2ivNj-9lW0pkUw,1,1,2,P1wov6zCW6RDCn2AXVJIYA
2927690,2014-02-03,0,5EIuCcoHY2evAhFMBV6G6g,"I arranged and attended a corporate dinner here for 20 or so people. I worked with Victoria and was very pleased. Also the staff, Kathy and our servers were all excellent. 

Some things I particularly liked about this place:
1. The menu options were good. We offered a salad, soup or mussels, scallops, pork cheeks or Ribeye and dessert. They prepared a special soup at our request and it was a great option. everyone in our party really enjoyed the food. we offered several desserts but people were pretty full after the dinner. 

2. Ambience was great in the private room and we even had a private reception area which made our party even better. On the ""needs improvement"" side, I wasn't crazy about the entry or the interior of the rest of the restaurant. Our guests didn't really see this so it had no bearing on our event. 

3. They were also very accommodating to late comers and folks who left early. Someone asked for something off the menu and they were accommodated with no fuss. 

4. We had nice assistance with the wine selection and were able to take away the unfinished and even a few extra to help meet our minimum as our crowd was on a non-drinking kick. 

I would recommend hosting an event with Pinot Brasserie for the skilled staff and nice presentation. If they are full or you need another location check out Postrio. They have a few private rooms that are very pretty.",fxhlx2QgK2LlGNN44wOx7w,2,1,4,c3FAaljWkyrS4aPbpm_KIA
3014480,2010-09-08,1,5EIuCcoHY2evAhFMBV6G6g,"I'm not sure why people gave such low reviews, because in my opinion this place is great.  We not only love the ambiance but the lunch menu is nice and the portions were large.  I can understand the 2 star review recently for the escargot because, in all honesty, it wasn't classic.  It was more of a deconstructed version and most people aren't into that, I guess.  Anyway, on to the food.

The food was outstanding, from the burger and fries to their sea bass, and up to the souffle.  We had the following:

Course 1 : Escargot - okay, I get it.  Like I said, it's  deconstructed version with lots of thinly sliced garlic pieces, diced tomatoes, wine and cream sauce with a bit of butter.  The flavors were very bold and a bit too much for my taste.  

Course 2: Lobster bisque - this is what a real bisque is.  There's a fine line between chowder and bisque texture, and theirs is smooth, not too creamy and not too watery, and the flavor of lobster is strong.  There's a bit of liquor as well, which was nice, and the drizzle of marscapone with a chunk of lobster meat was wonderful.  I loved every drop.

Main Courses: Their burger with fries was wonderfully juicy, large, and yummy.  The meat was seasoned well, and the aioli was a nice touch.  Fries were crispy and not oily.  The sea bass was beautiful, with a crispy skin, which is what we look for, and perfectly flaky meat.  The bed of veggies was a bonus.

Dessert: Souffle - yum.  Fluffy, creamy, and hot out of the oven.  You can't go wrong with chocolate anything, really.

Price: under 80 dollars.  Fabulous.

Service was impeccable, food was delightful, and the ambiance was reminiscent of an outdoor cafe.  We will be back for more.",o68A_3bAJTge-ioGXHdxKA,1,1,4,FWSvghLaP-rH7DB0AlPPUQ
3061201,2012-04-20,0,5EIuCcoHY2evAhFMBV6G6g,"Had lunch April 20th, 2012.   

I had the Bibb Lettuce salad with crab meat, avocado and a light vinaigrette.  $14.00   All the ingredients were fresh.  There was missing a key ingredient for this salad to be a success.  Ground pepper helped the flavor.  I should have ordered the small green salad with blueberries, peaches.   

Main course was the Bouillabaisse.   This plate is presented well with black mussels, salmon, two large clams, potato wedges, reduced onions and a Langostino on top of it all.   $32.00     Also, freshly baked sour dough buns delivered one at a time.   

I accompanied the main dish with a delightful Malbec Trapiche from Mendoza, Argentina.  $13.00

My companion had the black mussels.   They came in a small casserole dish and were loaded with shallots, garlic and butter.   They were tasty, however, I would have preferred less butter.   The order of mussels includes garlic fries which were impossible to stop eating .  

Dessert with shared the pecan pie which is a huge ball of pecans in syrup.  The bottom of the dish had a thin pastry dripping in deliciousness.  The top of the pecans had a Cinnamon ice cream ball.  

After eating we looked at the dinning rooms.  There are four areas.   A main large dinning room, one small intimate back ""cellar"" type room.  An abandoned outside area and a front of the restaurant side room.    Lunch was slow .   During two hours we ate, there were six tables of guests.     According to John, our waiter, the evening time will be filled completely.

3118231,2013-02-11,1,5EIuCcoHY2evAhFMBV6G6g,"Pinot is one of my favorite restaurants in Sin City, and I've eaten at quite a few of the higher end places in town.  It's certainly not the most expensive of the bunch, but in terms of price/performance it blows any other place I've tried at the Venetian (including Bouchon), or at the Wynn or Bellagio.  

Pinot is located on the Venetian's restaurant row near the meeting rooms, and is somewhere on the spectrum between a Bistro and formal French restaurant.  The interior is warm and inviting, with an old world ""Le Grand Salon"" feel to it, sporting leather booths with white table cloths surrounded by antique mirrors and wood paneling.  The atmosphere is more cozy than formal, so you can show up in denim and a sport coat and not feel out of place.

The food has never disappointed, and I usually do one of their prix fixe dinners with the wine pairings (although they do have a comprehensive wine list if you want to fly solo).  They also generally have foie gras (which we can no longer get in LA) on the menu in some form or another, so often I'll order that as an appetizer with another entree if I'm not in the mood for a multi-course gastronomic adventure.  

The service here has always been top notch, no complaints. Very professional and never intrusive.

Note that the dining room closes between lunch and dinner, but they offer an ""Intermission Menu"" in the bar from 3pm to 5:30pm.

Ah Pinot, I miss you.  I may wander from time to time, but I'll always come back. I've been away for longer than I'd like, but I'm very much looking forward to our next evening together.

3365630,2009-08-17,5,5EIuCcoHY2evAhFMBV6G6g,"Finally I'm writing this review.

One of goodies that you will encounter while walking around the Venetian hotel or maybe the Palazzo (I don't remember...).

 Pinot is a restaurant that needs to be tried at least once. Interestingly there are two PInots in LA, and I haven't tried any of them. So, when Pinot was on our way, we just got in.

 There is a reason why french cousine is considered one of the best. I'm one of the top defenders of this idea. Why? Because there is no other next it, to cook a lamb, and tasting it so damn good that you even forget what's your name, because it's that good.

The atmosphere at Pinot is very dark. The crowd was mostly on the older side, but that's good, because people start to appreciate good food at older age (maybe, not really), I'm definitely one big great food  appreciator without being really old! (Serisouly what does the age got to do with it?.....pause) 
*****
My french cousin was lost in translation, so we the clueless ones ordered the Fromage Plater  as an appetizer (apparently the French eat cheese after the main course, therefore my cousin's confusion).

The chef chose 5 types of cheese, they were pretty wow-ish, with different types of crackers, honey wax, fig jam, and grapes. It was a nice way of creating appetite for the entree.

One thing that sparked my eyes when I read it on the menu, was the Lamb, done medium with herbs and the perfect seasoning, which was so tender and delicious that was melting into my mouth and captivating my taste buds all over. 

Just that one lamb, was enough for me to form a great opinion for PInot, even though our waiter was a bit mentally challenged. (He brought three times the wrong bill, and each time would take him 20 minutes to come back but I don't hold that against PInot)

So, Pinot =Lamb dish with rich Pinot Noir

My waitress was pleasant, but inattentive. My mom ordered a caesar salad for herself, so it was a nice surprise when we both got plates. Until we got the check and saw they had charged us for two.

The caesar had a strong flavor, which I like. It was nicely plated with an anchovie sliver, slice of prosciutto, and breadsticks. Overall, delicious.

We ordered a fruits de mer for two. Everything was fresh. I did get a bit of sand in a couple of my oysters. I was willing to overlook it. I was a bit upset about the rolls, however.

I asked that either several rolls be place at our table at once, or that we receive rolls continuously- to balance out our fruits de mer. The waitress assured me they would. And yet all night long I received one roll.

Finally we had dessert. The tarte tatin. Delicious. I ordered and Irish Coffee with it-  inedible. It was pure whiskey. And while I enjoy a strong drink, I did not order whiskey with a splash of coffee- I ordered an Irish Coffee.

This is not a nightclub, you're not doing me a solid by mixing me strong drinks. And while I do enjoy whiskey on its lonesome,  I'd like an Irish Coffee to top off my meal.

Anyway, just as a note they do not 'refill' your glass. If you order a soft drink and ask for more, you will be paying for a second drink. Wouldn't have minded if someone had told me.

This may seem like a harsh review for me, especially since i float those 5 stars out like candy, but it's really because I had high expectations based on the reputation and presentation.

And it would've been nice if my waitress actually paid attention. The bus boys took better care of us than she did.

we got there and were promptly seated, got a look over at the menu, we placed our orders. as we waited for complimentary bread & butter, a couple sat adjacent to our table after we did.. and they got their bread&butter before us.. then they got their appetizers before us.. and their entrees.. and desserts.. they actually were able to leave before us.. before we even got our desserts!!

all the waiters/etc moved around so quickly for some unknown reason.. the diners were all very relaxed and it was a quiet atmosphere, so why were they all hurriedly running around? shrugs. 

the decor is retarded. it's pretty, then it's casual with knotted pine stained in an oakish color.. combined with odd formal sconces with red silk shades.. with old venetian aged looking mirrors... it was very mis-matched and in a very bad way. the only thing i liked, was the dark grey ceilings with gold crown molding and grand chandeliers that hung from them.. 

i've had my fair share of tiny portions of pretentious food, but this place was just retarded. 

for appetizers, we got escargot, grilled baby octopus, and the foie gras. the octopus was way too lemony, and the foie gras was overcooked.. escargot wasn't special save for the sauce which was the only thing that saved the appetizers. 

for entrees, i got the salmon lyonnaise, .. salmon was dry and definitely overcooked.. my cousin got scallops and it wasn't anything spectacular.. my aunt got veal cheeks and short of the zucchini, it tasted like a popular vietnamese dish (thit kho).. 

and for desserts, my aunt and i got the same thing, one each: belgian chocolate souffle, and my cousin got the chocolate croissant bread pudding, which was the chef's special dish.. chocolate souffle was boring. we make better ones at home, this was far too cake-ish.. wasn't fluffy enough. and the bread pudding was bland.. and dry. 

we were definitely not impressed.. and after figuring out that the Patina Group owns this one, and the others in SoCal, we were further disinterested.. and it made sense as to why we weren't impressed. the Pinot Provence in Costa Mesa was nothing to be of huge acclaim, it all made sense as to why Pinot Brasserie was nothing exciting either.

The food was also lacking. The escargot was very subpar. I am used to it being drenched in garlic and butter but this was tossed in an odd sauce. I had a French dip and the bread was fairly dry. My friend had the oysters and although they were good, they came out without an oyster fork and horseradish.

Caesar salad has a unique presentation, whole romaine lettuce leaves wrapped with a thin prosciutto strip and a bread stick.

The onion soup was hot and tasty with a nice cheese top with French bread croutons inside the broth.

Entree

Let downs: 

Mussels that had been sat under a heat lamp and the top half (of, to be fair, a very generous portion) were overdone.  Pot was so hot those inside were still cooking.  Ok broth, nothing special.

Barramundi was overcooked.

Rabbit and Duck off the menu (Saturday around 9pm)

Note to bartender - a Kir Royale does not require sugar.  It's not a Champagne Cocktail.  Was horrified to taste that sweetness at the end.


Other dishes were ok-to-pretty good.  No ""wow"" dishes.

Nice enough room.  Server was a nice guy, very casual, probably very experienced, but our order in several areas was messed up.  Don't be afraid to write things down....

We were sat in a bit of their Siberia but sense anywhere else wouldn't have changed the overall experience too much.

Anyways, sadly enough.. on a weekend, this place isn't full and it doesn't really get full.  I think the jig is up.. people know this place isn't great.

There are some things that are good here.. but unfortunately steak is not one of them.  The steak seemed to be a poor quality one... and it was overcooked.  This is sad since this place is supposed to be a French steakhouse.  Garlic fries weren't all that either... okay.  I guess you can't make fries that good.  I thought the mussels were delicious though.  They were better than the ones at Bouchon.  Oh.. I did like the Pinot Grigio we also ordered.  But it's a bad sign when the main course isn't that good.  I got the ribeye and it just was blegh... very big dissapointment considering how much it was.  It was on top of spinach and mushrooms.. those were decent.  But come on.. you have to be good at what you're known for.

The service was good though.  Waiter was very accomodating.  Was able to take potatoes off my sides and instead just give me more spinach and mushrooms.",z_9oeZ5aN8g8AzPNENht8w,2,0,2,8blfFu4dP9jd-u8cMyx1VA

As most of you have professed, the Escargot is not stellar.  This was definitely not my favorite form of preparation but it was also not my appetizer.  I had the Lobster Bisque to start and I sopped up the bottom of the bowl with bread, it was very good.  For my entree, the Striped Bass - Prosciutto-potato hash, lemon beurre blanc.  This was cooked perfectly.  It competes in flavor and texture to my favorite RM Seafood.  Delicate flavor with a skin almost as crunchy as a chip without being overcooked or charred.

I didn't review the wine list, but they do have a very nice selection of top shelf bourbons to tickle even my fancy (Woodford Reserve, Bookers, Bakers, Makers, and several more).  The heirloom tomato salad was pretty good, but certainly not anywhere near AOC's in Los Angeles.  Most of the people I was with enjoyed their meal, and I was no exception.  I would say however the braised pork belly was on the dry side, really surprising when you consider the cut of meat and how the fats should have kept it nice, moist, and falling apart.  I didn't try the chocolate souffle myself, but the chocolate-lover in our group rated it highly.

4974447,2009-09-10,4,5EIuCcoHY2evAhFMBV6G6g,"After hearing decent reviews about Pinot Brasserie's involvement with Restaurant Week, we decided to check out their lunch menu the past Sunday.

As we approached the hostess, she asked if we were there for Restaurant Week (which we were), and gave us a seat inside.  (In retrospect, I wish I had asked for a seat in the 'outside' area so we could have access to the pedestrian area.  The front room we were seated in reminded me of someone's dining room.  After taking our orders and getting our beverages, hot bread rolls and cold butter arrived a few minutes later.

Starter:
* Onion Soup Gratinee ""Baguette, Gruyere cheese"" - The Husband and I both chose this dish to start, since the other options were both salads.  The cheesy goodness from the Gruyere cheese really makes this dish.  Otherwise it's just onions and bread in a broth.

Entree:
* Croque Monsieur ""Ham, Gruyere cheese, Creme Fraiche"" - This is what I had initially ordered.  But the neighboring table got an order of the Linguini Pasta and I could smell the wonderful garlic scent rising from her dish.  I was immediately enchanted and wished to change my order.  (Thank goodness it was before the soup had arrived, so the waitress was able to make the change.)

* Linguini Pasta ""Mussels, Littleneck Clams, white wine broth"" - When the waiter placed the dish in front of me, I waited for the steam bath of garlic to envelope me.  It didn't.  I took a big whiff and I could hardly smell any garlic.  It also looked a bit less than that neighboring party's dish.  Hmmm...As I started to separate the mussels and clams from their shells, I took a bite of my pasta.  Pretty heavy on the white wine broth and not much else is what my final thoughts were.  I found myself putting pats of butter into the dish to give it more flavor.  It was just okay, not something I would order again.

* Roasted Chicken ""Tarragon-sherry jus, Pinot Garlic Fries"" - A generous portion size for lunch, I was surprised that The Husband went this route since we're not fond of the dry chicken problem.  He really thought it would be different here.  The chicken laid on a bed of mushrooms which had a heavy wine sauce.  In the end, the chicken was dry, especially the breast section.  (He learned his lesson.)  The side of fries were good, although we had to ask for a dipping sauce.

Dessert:
* Chocolate Croissant Pudding ""With Wild Turkey Sauce"" - Unfortunately, they were already out of this dessert by 1 pm.

* Creme Brulee ""Burnt custard"" - Dessert took awhile, and at least it was worth waiting for.  They do their creme brulee very nicely here.  A large service area for the burnt sugary top, a nice texture and taste, and a satisfying dessert overall.

Service was decent, nothing exceptional though.  Things took a lot longer than we felt necessary, and I'm not sure if it's because they purposely want you to have a leisurely meal or if they just run slower.  I did notice that not everyone was offered the Restaurant Week lunch menu option, which does make me wonder why.",rt3PC7WCgCKsoufmQJELfw,5,5,3,RBj04sOJUXpYyWZFGm95jw

5094811,2011-11-14,4,5EIuCcoHY2evAhFMBV6G6g,"Outstanding lunch spot.  Dinner slightly underwhelming.

Another find in my crawl through the Venetian trying to avoid food court food while grinding my day away.  

The lunch menu offers very good soups, salads and sandwiches.  Smaller portions but delicious.  The classically French, lobster bisque is rich, velvety, and delicious.  Topped with creme fraiche and bits of lobster that just make this comforting classic.   Escargot is also good eats.  Prepared in the usual way but brought to life with some fresh frisee tossed in a truffle vinaigrette.  Finally, the charcuterie.  Nice selection of cured meats and pate.  Add some bread and a glass of wine. Oh yeah. (So sometimes I drink when I play poker; no law against that).

Only fault, the Croque monsieur.  At first glance it nears classic perfection then you bite in and... creme fraiche?  That's like putting mayo on a hamburger.  Sorry to my Canadian friends.

Dinner adds some excellent dishes but looses the cafe feel.  Standouts include the seared foie with an outstanding mandarin orange relish and vanilla sauce, a fantastic poached pear salad with salty, pungent goat cheese, and an outstanding bouillabaisse.  Every piece of seafood cooked perfectly in the deeply flavored, seafood broth.

The wine list is almost entirely French. Very well chosen with good emphasis on lesser growths and regions.  Very good offerings by the glass.  Pours are small, prices are high.  Bottle pricing is much better and lower than most in Vegas.

Service is OK.  Can be slow at times if large groups come in.  Sit at the bar and its all good.

5279086,2009-10-11,0,5EIuCcoHY2evAhFMBV6G6g,"Arriving early I was told I could take a seat inside while my table was prepared.  Sitting down in the bar area I was instantly glad I'd made a reservation - possibly the busiest restaurant I saw during my whole trip to Vegas the average wait for a party of 2 was 30 minutes!  After approximately 5 minutes I was led to my table - a small two-top at the edge of the main dining room and thankfully somewhat isolated by the intensely loud interior of the restaurant.  Greeted by my seemingly overworked server I was asked if I wanted wine and when I declined she simply disappeared for approximately ten minutes, a theme of absence that would recur frequently during the meal.
 
Eventually returning to take my order and fill my water glass I had spent plenty of time browsing the unique Cali-French cuisine of Chef Eric Lhuillier and when I asked regarding the foie gras on the dinner menu I was told that the chef would be glad to prepare it - placing my orders I was left to wait - again for an excessive amount of time. Thankfully in my server's absence another young man took the onus to attend to my water glass while another well dressed server brought me a couple of fantastic dinner rolls.  Served with small chunks of cold and unsalted butter the rolls were served piping hot from the oven and had a great ratio of crusty salted exterior to soft and airy interior - they were actually so buttery sweet that adding the table butter was entirely unnecessary.  Being sure not to overfill like the prior day I limited myself to only two pieces of bread and plenty of water while I waited.
 
Arriving literally after the table across from myself had ordered, eaten, paid and departed, my first dish was indeed my special request from the dinner menu - and while there was nothing special about the service at this meal, the dish continued a theme of quite exceptional food that was started by the rolls.  Described as ""Chaud froid of seared foie gras - Pickled pineapple and heirloom radishes"" the dish was actually presented as a large pile of artisan greens and shredded radishes with great snap and pieces of duck confit intermixed over the top of two medium sized lobes of warm seared foie atop a chunk of incredibly tart yet savory pineapple.  While clearly following a formula of balancing the unctuous foie with the sweet components of fruit and adding greens for texture I actually loved this preparation for the pickled pineapple and the manner in which the acid mingled with the foie.  The foie itself, while good, notably did have a couple of small veins that clearly would not have ""made the cut"" at a higher end restaurant - regardless, for an item not regularly prepared at lunch it was quite nice.
 
Finishing my foie the plate was left on the table for some time (the table across from me still sat uncleaned as well) before my main course arrived - and even after delivery of my dish the empty plate remained.  Service issues aside, the food once again impressed - this time a classic Croque Monsieur served with crispy garlic frites and a small salad with oil and vinegar.  Not usually a fan of fries I will say these were superb - the best I'd had since those at Bouchon with their Croque, actually.  Served with gruyere and crème fraiche as opposed to the more traditional Mornay or Bechamel sauce I have to admit I liked the ""tang"" from the creme and the combination of the buttery brioche, savory cheese, and well prepared ham made for an excellent sandwich - not as good as some, but vastly better than others - and something ""different"" than the norm.
 
Happy with the food thus far I knew dessert was a must - it was just a matter of deciding on one.  With balsamic strawberries, apple tart tatin, and souffle there were so many options - but clearly the bread pudding stated to be Chef Splichal's signature was the obvious choice.  Beginning with a buttery and rich croissant the dish was bound with a thick vanilla custard and studded with rich chunks of dark chocolate forming pockets within the admixture.  Delicious on its own the square of cake-like pudding was topped with a sweet strawberry and accompanied by a small vessel of buttery bourbon creme that only served to enhance the sweetness of the dish while accenting the subtle notes of the chocolate and vanilla expertly.  While not as ""fancy"" as a souffle, definitely a worthy ""signature"" dessert.
 
Finishing another glass of water I paid the bill - nearly $50 for lunch - and left a modest tip.  While I fully admit that I'm a bit choosy when it comes to my service there is nothing worse than a chef's vision being compromised by the front of the house.  While the food wasn't as amazing as many places in Vegas and the service could certainly stand to take some lessons from Keller's team at Bouchon I'd consider a return visit in the future if Vegas didn't have so many other great options.

We were waiting for a 3rd person to join us, and they didn't bring us bread until she arrived, though the bread guy was walking around offering it to other people.  Our server also spilled water on my menu and forgot to bring us steak knives.  Everything was brought to us in a timely manner, and they were prompt with the water refills and bread delivery once our 3rd person arrived.  

I definitely enjoyed our dining experience here.  The food quality was well worth the full price on the menu, though I think their service could be a little better for what people end up spending.",4U6ERqlxOzo7AGCLHfymtQ,0,0,4,I-lhfo4ZYGeHiAacDc5OZQ
