102130,2016-09-13,2,amwEhW6y9PZtq5ZYNJhQBA,"O.M.G. best food ever. I went with my husband and my two girls. I have no clue where to start. There really isnt many tapas choices in Vegas. Do not go in here and only get one thing because yoy would just be missing out. This was my first time trying one out and I was not disappointed. Barcelona Tapas just opened a week ago inside the Artisan Hotel, they have another location in southern Highlands that has excellent reviews. The ambiance if the entire place plus the restaurant is absolute perfection. To start we had the  red and white Sangria which is house made and was probably the best Ive ever had. We got theFried Goat Cheese Balls, Shrimp al Ajillo(AMAZING),  Apple Menchengo Salad, the Chicken Skewers and the Steak Skewers. I literally LOVED everything. Once we finished we then got the Beef Carpaccio, the ribeye Bites, the braised beef tacos, a second helping of Fried Goat Cheese Balls, Barcelona Fries. Thats all I can really remember lol. Everything was absolutely superb. I didnt know what a carpaccio was so I didn't finish that but it was absolutely delicious. I believe anyone that goes in knowing what that is will not be disappointed. For dessert, which i was already stuffed but had to say what the heck!, we had the Sweet empanadas, Chocolate Tres Leches cake, and the Flan. Wow, wow, wow.
I would say my stand out were particular but honestly, I cant choose. When i first saw the menu I thought it was delicious. Actually eating there exceeded my expectations so high that  everything was my favorite.
The chef, Edgar came to check on us a couple times and was friendly. I was glad because i needed to praise his outstanding menu and skills in the kitchen. The owner Gilbert was very hospitable and looked truly please with our satisfaction, lastly our server Nancy was absolutely incredible, loved her and her personality! 
This is a 10 out of 10 place. A must go for anyone that visits Vegas as well as locals looking for a place to eat. I havent been this satisfied with a restaurant in a very long time!! Definitely will be back and try even more items on the menu!!
P.S. the only reason I didnt capture any photos is because every time something came out I would be too excited and would jump right in and by the time I remembered that i needed to take one everyone had already devoured everything!",TvP6j_rMcd1TjS4TQDbdew,2,0,5,vRG4XDOgT4IpAYIFQmoTNg

We used a groupon, which brought our total to $10 and some odd change.  So, basically we paid $10 for a beer, glass of water & some ketchup as everything else was inedible.  I love food and I will practically eat anything, especially when I'm starving......which I was.  I have never had such a bad experience as I had here.  The fried calamari was waaaaaay, way over done and fried so crispy that the calamari was dried up and broke like glass when I tried to eat it with my fork, but I still ate what I could which was about 1/4 of it.  My fiance got a stuffed burger, which was stringy and undercooked........how in the hell is ground beef stringy?  It looked absolutely disgusting and I think he took about 2 bites out of it before giving up.   After ""dinner"", I was left with stomach pains most of the night......so my suggestion is if you are in the mood for tapas, look somewhere else.",Y3I_-ccBqY2u8yJGg6Wszw,1,1,1,CXeJju44hfO1y3m7ofR0BA

We ordered a couple of tapas, the stuffed artichokes (super yummy) and the potatoes. I loved them both. The paella, however, was missing some flavor, overall it was good, but I think could improve. The serving was huge however -my boyfriend and I could not finish it all and ended up taking a lot of it home for leftovers. The man who was serving us, Gilbert, was very attentive, kind, and genuinely pleasant company. The ambience is very cozy and romantic. Parking is valet only.

1480585,2018-06-13,0,amwEhW6y9PZtq5ZYNJhQBA,"The food was decent, but didn't have a strong Spanish feel.  The biggest disappointment was the Serrano Ham Platter, which is supposed to come with Manchego cheese.  What arrived was instead a block of white cheddar cheese.  And the Serrano ham was pretty much prosciutto from the local market.  When we complained that it wasn't Manchego, the waiter communicated back from the kitchen that it is Manchego.  It clearly wasn't Manchego and it bothered me that they lied about it.  It kind of ruined my taste buds for the rest of the meal.  We also ordered the Veggie Empanadas which was decent, patatas braves which were ok, but not worth the $7.99 price, shrimp al ajillo which was good, and fried goat cheese which was also good.  Had the cheese been real Manchego I would have given a higher rating of 3-4 stars, but because the kitchen lied, I had to give a worse rating.  

The restaurant is hidden in the Artisan Hotel and was completely empty when we ate there.  It was a bit spooky because of how empty and quiet the restaurant was for a Saturday night.  Our server was extremely nice and accommodating making the meal somewhat pleasurable.",d13uLpOZJpMMTWKjSmOyLA,0,0,2,8DxoqlUFFiIlZBtJH9FodQ

1966581,2016-11-21,1,amwEhW6y9PZtq5ZYNJhQBA,"THIS PLACE IS AMAZING!!! I love me some tapas and Barcelona totally delivers on not only the food but also the service. I've eaten here a few times now and every single time I come I leave happy and full. It's so hard to find good paella here in Vegas. Usually it's the lack of real saffron that's missing in the dish or the seafood is whack. Not the case here. Real saffron to give it that rich color and savory flavor, and a true mixture of seafood; clams, mussels, squid, shrimp, scallops oh my! Another great seafood dish is the shrimp ceviche which is made a little different than your common Mexican ceviche, such great flavor! Not to take anything away from the focus of the dish, but the chips are remarkable. Freshly made in-house. For me, even if the ceviche is good, bad chips can ruin the whole dish. Barcelona delivers on both. 
During another one of my visits I had the garlic pork sandwich which is a house favorite. I could tell why. You can taste the garlic flavor, which isn't over-powering, but enough to give the pork that extra flavor. The coolest thing of all though is the coleslaw they add on top of the sandwich. The sweet and cool flavor of the coleslaw balances out the pork very nicely. 
Last but certainly not least, the service. Tee has been my server each time I've visited. Her customer service is superior and she truly provides a memorable dinning experience.

First off, the decor is...weird. The restaurant is in a ""boutique"" hotel, and well--you'll see when you enter the lobby that this is not your typical hotel. I thought it was weird and off putting, but you might find it interesting. 

Second, the food was good. I got the pork taco lunch special. The tacos were pretty good although there was way too much meat for the tiny tortillas. The rice and beans were okay, but they were definitely not fresh and were kind of mushy. 

My mom got the gazpacho, and that was kind of disappointment because they blended the tomatoes, cucumbers, and oil all together into this consistency that reminded me of apple sauce. The soup was orange! As someone who went to Barcelona for a week and tried probably 20 gazpachos there, I never encountered a gazpacho like the one this restaurant serves. The color and consistency was definitely a turn off. 

Finally, the service was okay. The waiter seemed happy to see us, especially since we were the only party there for a good 45 minutes. However, the food came out a bit slow.",wvu0O_livp8-U1Jn-arFEA,0,0,3,3uCHQ-4gJYWgLzKmpGwB-Q

I tried multiple things but for some reason the spaghetti and meatballs really stuck out to me. hahahaah yeah right? Of all the things...probably because the meatballs are some spanish seasoned version and the tomato sauce has wine in it? Don't know for sure but damn it tasted gooooood.

I tried several of the small dishes; the (regular) sliders, veggie/chicken/beef empanadas, both hamburgers (they have a classic and a Spanish version?)...yeah over two weekends I tried a TON of food. Blew close to 4 bills total? Yeah obviously I would go back for more.

The only criticisms:

1. Some items were not as rich in flavor as I would have expected/hoped.  For instance when I compared one of the shrimp dishes (I think in a garlic sauce) with say the chicken empanadas, the latter was noticeably not as seasoned or flavorful as the prior dish...it's almost like they went over to Trader Joes (does Vegas even have one? fuck it...say Smith's or some shit instead), bought some frozen empanadas, nuked them and served them to you. Not that they tasted bad...they just didn't stand out as anything exciting. Needless to say I only ordered the chicken empanadas once. And note that I gave this whole empanada thing more than one go (3 goes actually), and none of them really stood out w.r.t. flavor.

2. I ordered one of the soups and it was lukewarm at best. Nuke the soup next time...I like my soup HOT...HOT like your wife lol...like about to burn my tongue off hot~

Awesome restaurant, worth visiting, great menu with tons of options. You gotta walk through a CREEPY AS FUCK SWINGERS HOTEL on the shit side of the strip to get to it (not downtown but more so next to Palace Station...yeah *THAT* shit side) but the food and service make it worth your while. That and there are dispensaries within walking distance~ #WEED

---Overall---

Service: A+. Friendly and attentive~

Food: B. Could have been more flavorful, hotter, etc.

Atmosphere: A+. Way brighter than the rest of the hotel

Value: A-. I made multiple trips...'nuff said~",-kkq4fbhtnbnYAPpxpnvHg,2,1,4,ckESrcPUGprRUdGuA3zYVQ

I made a reservation on open table to dine here for lunch after seeing the good yelp reviews and it was a total disappointing experience and I would never ever ever come back here again. Especially after I called the restaurant manager and he did nothing to try to remedy the situation.

We arrived at the restaurant to be told that one of the rooms was taken out by a private event, no problems, I was told that we could still dine by the bar. So we sat down by the bar and the whole place was empty, which is never a good sign. Our bartender told us that he couldn't order food for us because the restaurant and the bar are two separate things. Super weird! He had to actually pick up the phone and call the server to come take our order, and the server didn't come for a good 10 minutes.  She finally came and took our order, very briefly and didn't really explain the menu to us. 

We never saw her again, 45 minutes later, we still didn't get our food so we had to get the bartender to literally phone call her again to come and bring our food. The food actually also didn't taste good! For the Price we were charged which was strip prices, the portions were very tiny, presentation was very lacking and so was the taste.

We contemplated ordering more food, because we were still hungry, but we ended up not ordering anymore because we didn't want to wait another 45 minutes for food. Then we asked for a bill, only to be told that the drinks and food had to be paid on a separate bills. What a pain!! The bartender and then phone called the server again and for another 20 minutes she never came to pick up our bill. We had to literally walk back into the kitchen to chase her down. Oh and we never got any drinks from her either.

I also asked to speak to the manager, and no one came. Later in the day I called the restaurant and spoke to the manager, and he didn't do anything to remedy the situation.

Not only was the food incredible but it was made with love. Each dish is made fresh to order and you can taste the creative care in each dish. The happy hour prices are great and the sangria is made in wine barrels which creates an incredible smooth taste and easy to want to have multiple! Trust me, you will want multiple! 

We met the owner Gilbert who owns the restaurant with his wife and he was lovely and helpful in choosing the dishes. 

We had the beef empanadas- SO GREAT. Fresh, and the aioli to dip them in is on point. 

The sangria was one of our favorites! Top quality and you can tell that there was a lot of time put in to create them. 

The mac and cheese was so yummy! The fresh menchego cheese was so great topped with fresh bacon. 

We also go the stuffed artichokes. So great! The sauce on the artichokes you can tell was homemade. 

We ended with their cappuccino and tres leche chocolate cake. They make their dessert in house it was really yummy but next time we want to try to empanadas dessert. Their coffee tastes quality also. I didn't catch the brand of coffee they use.

This place wasn't terrible but I wasn't wowed either.  Service was nice enough.  We came in around 11:30 am and besides one other patron, we were the only ones there the entire time we ate.  Our group was a party of three and we ordered 6 tapas (small plates) and still left feeling hungry. 

We ordered:
-White Sangria (free with Yelp check in) - Really light and refreshing. Compared to other sangrias I've had not much fruit mixed in with the drink though.
-Tacos al pastor ($6.99) - Smaller street tacos style, the pork was seasoned really well and the sauce on top had a nice kick to it.  The pork was a tad dry. 
-Pan Fried Dates ($6.99) - Bacon wrapped dates with blue cheese, tasty and one of my favorite dishes out of the bunch we ordered.
-Patatas Bravas ($7.99) - Potatoes with aioli sauce on top, we found this dish extremely salty.
-Barcelona Salad ($10.99) - Light salad with a light dressing, nothing terrible, nothing memorable.
-Surf & Turf ($13.99) - Bacon wrapped filet mignon and shrimp on top of mashed potatoes.  Tasty but the dish came with a small amount of filet mignon and only one or two shrimp.
-Zarzuela de Mariscos ($23.99) - Seafood dish with shrimp, calamari, mussels, clams, some type of fish, and rice drizzled in a sauce.  Out of all the dishes we enjoyed this the most and the sauce wasn't too heavy either. 

Overall, I don't see myself coming back here.  If you do decide to come here I would recommend not to come here with a massive appetite.  This place is probably better suited if you're only going to get drinks and a dish or two to snack on.",hgfqysg2htnJI5bvtIIUjg,3,2,3,E-zxj-9OXcch4m8jq_R22g

Secondly while the service was good and the food good, they turned off the music during dinner. We really felt uncomfortable. Maybe they were trying to tell us something.
 My review is based on the difference in quality of the sangria and overall atmosphere in just a few short weeks. Leave it to Vegas to go from zero to zero in record time, only the rich survive.

1. Customer Service is awesome!! The waiters and the entire staff are really sweet and very attentive. 

2. Pork empanadas are amazeballs!! Soft, flaky, and flavourful! Everything you need from a great empanadas is served in this fantastic pastry.

3. The decor is very interesting and really is a conversation starter. BRAVA!!

4. The sangrias are really tasty and very authentic.

5. The menu really provides a lot of options! At a tapas place its important to have many options to tantalize your client's palates............

Which brings us to what went wrong. 

You can mess up anywhere......except for the food. And that's why such the low score. We ordered the bacon wrapped dates and that was burnt. The croquettes were undercooked and the mushrooms weren't cooked all the way through. The kitchen was pretty lazy. 

And by itself that's pretty bad. But it doesn't stop there! *sigh* Upon walking up the attendant was mopping the floor and there were cleaning products everywhere. It took them a while before we were acknowledged. They hadn't even turned on the lights which troubled me because how exactly were they cleaning? Then also there was lots of construction everywhere in the bar which made me somewhat concerned about the safety of those elements surrounding our food.

So all in all this place has tons of potential but hasn't made the mark quite yet. Looking forward to seeing it after some time to see if it's improved.",uZXFsy7Ef_AgT7hXsgmAUw,1,0,2,KEX17ClsEqWe2PuTKGdFfw

The hotel had some insane pool party at the same time. By insane, I mean it was so fucking loud you couldn't even hear yourself think without screaming it out of a loud speaker. 
The staff kept apologizing...I don't even think they knew there was a hip hop party that was to take place that night. It was so loud from the bar right outside the restaurant. 

My only complaint is that they were clearly understaffed. it took a good 2 hours just to eat. Our waitress was super nice and attentive as much as she could have been. 

The dishes. They were awesome. This is the best tapas I've had in town. 
Our favs:

Beef Carpaccio 
Surf & Turf - wow. This dish was amazing. 
Pan Fried Dates

Everything we had was awesome. We had a lot more, but those three really stood out. We wanted the paella, but we'll come back another time. 

One thing they could improve: the alcohol selection. They have a very ""merh"" selection. 

They did have live music while we were there, which was excellent. Once the club music stopped, that is.

I definitely want to go back soon to try more dishes. This place is fantastic!",-xDW3gYiYaoeVASXywTPgw,24,17,4,CiRvJJvz2gUzcqAlAS8CqQ

The atmosphere was not bad but had a slight BO smell initially. Liked the deco. We ordered the carpaccio... omg! We really could not tell if what was on the plate was real meat... I was more like a brown spread with a fanciful drizzle of chipotle mayo... which was also on the other dishes we had. We were super shocked at the steamed clams. The clams were served in an overpowering red sauce... 3 out of 9 clams did not open. Gross! The sangria reminded me of punch with seven up. Awful.",MYeGTDLvEHqrN4JXlSIWTw,0,0,1,DLTTxesP-uoni0SKvYV7hQ

I never eat pasta, but they were a comfort food dream and some of the best pasta I've ever had. The sauce was wonderful. The server said they make all their own sauces. The rare steak on the Surf and Turf was done to perfection. The Pan Fried Dates are always a must and never disappoint. My family and I have loved and been frequent patrons of another well known Tapas restaurant in Las Vegas, but since the Barcelona opened we think it's  better food at a better value.

5511844,2017-05-04,0,amwEhW6y9PZtq5ZYNJhQBA,"Oh me oh my. This review is of The Barcelona, the restaurant attached to The Artisan. This place is funky and cool and the bar is super fun BUT the private dining room is cheap and tacky. Like a back room that they stuck a table in and installed a dimmer to the fluorescent light. Seriously. I was so sad when we showed up. I immediately turned the dimmer down as low as it could get. Maybe we should have turned it off and asked for candles.

The food was meh. The ribeye tasted great and the mashed potatoes were yummy but soggy frozen vegetable medley out of a bag?! Really? Are we that far off the strip that people are so drunk or high they don't taste things? Maybe so. Fortunately the company of our dinner party was so fun, we would have had a blast at Denny's but I was really sad that I spent so much $$ on such a pathetic venue. I think my guests didn't really notice and everyone had a good time but this is what you get when you organize an event from afar (we're from California). 

However, the bar is so so so funky. Mirrors on the ceiling. Crazy art everywhere. Boobies! I would definitely recommend coming back for the after-hours shenanigans. I have a feeling it gets crazy.  Why can't they just extrapolate some of that atmosphere into the restaurant? I wish they'd hire me as a designer. It has a TON of potential. It's a shame they are wasting it.",fBH-rOPVbgbMlRFGLGOmrA,0,0,3,p8NczMVzoH4Y8lmKV6aXgg

Eventhough the waitresses and the chef were trying to be helpful when they saw the error on Yelp after sitting us at the table, the patio they sent us to afterwards, was under construction and there was no place to sit and eat. Long day drives and misinformation on Yelp can be very frustrating.",lZ0Mx20zx1IQFnXGZL-4PA,0,0,1,mQ6dw6k2K-W-9_mwLeAWNA

I'll start out with the atmosphere. ...  very kook, kitschy & relaxed. The staff was great, the service was wonderful and the food was simply phenomenal! We started with the white sangria pitcher (cheaper than the 4 glasses we drank together). Then had chicken skewers, the stuffed dates, beef empanadas and Parmesan basket. For our next round we got the beef sliders and piquilo peppers.  While we wanted dessert, we simply had no room left. This is definitely a hidden gem inside the Artisan hotel on Western.

I don't know if it was because there was just one server or what the case was, but it really killed a night out with friends. I ordered a coffee and only received it when I asked another employee  for it when she dropped off our food (about 25 mins). I would have asked our server but he never came back to the table. Waters were refilled once. I'm assuming friends of his came in because he stayed more at their table than the other 4 tables he had combined.

Luckily I stuck around because the food is quite good. Two dishes: the shrimp diabla and the fried goat cheese. Diabla was spicy but not overpowering, we'll balanced and complex. Fried goat cheese was delightful.

5802942,2017-06-02,0,amwEhW6y9PZtq5ZYNJhQBA,"I'm a fan of the Southern Highlands location but did not have a good experience at this location for a handful of reasons. We asked if they offered an all you can eat menu like the other location and the server told us they don't... reason she gave was that this location doesn't cater to locals like the other and they focus on serving the dishes at a higher quality.... this seemed like a shitty thing to say considering we were all locals and it's also shit talking your very own business.  Me and a friend were contemplating the white sangria and the server offered to bring us out a sample... seemed like a lovely gesture but we were brought a warm sample in a half inch tall disposable shot glass.  This probably wouldn't have been so annoying if it didn't follow the server's speech about how they provide higher quality here for non-locals. Also, we had three dishes not come out at all and when we asked the server she said they were out of those items... would have been nice to know that earlier into the meal so that we could have ordered some alternatives.  The setting of this restaurant is really cool and the dishes are really good, but the Southern Highlands location provides just as good quality and MUCH better service.",sD_uLJBHHozK-poMkY2l7w,0,0,2,zHvEjFtlrMTkO1KC1Oxnuw

We ordered the albondigas, piquillo peppers, pan fried dates, stuffed baked mushrooms, and salami banderas, all part of our usual favorites rotation for Barcelona Tapas. The best way I can describe it is that the kitchen seemed really lazy -- thrown together dishes, ingredients missing, sliced cheese thrown on top. As a big fan of Barcelona Tapas, I was sorely disappointed. Would have possibly 3 stars if rated in a vacuum (really, 2.5), but knowing that the original location is so much better than this, nope.
