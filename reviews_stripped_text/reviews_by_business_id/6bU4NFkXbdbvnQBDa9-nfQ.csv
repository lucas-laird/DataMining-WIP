It's not quite like home cooking but close enough. I just love their Crispy Pata, probably one of my favorite dishes they make.

My favorite food there is their BBQ sticks!  There's just something about filipino BBQ sticks that just make them the best ever!  They have either pork or chicken.  

I have noticed that this restaurant has too many pork dishes, more than any other type of meat.  I was hoping for chicken adobo but they usually only have pork, or pork sinigang instead of beef sinigang.  Also, I personally am a bit picky with where I get my dinaguan but decided to try it here one day.  It was a bit soup-y, where as I like the texture kinda thick, and there was not as much meat in it, it was whatever the thin, hard part of the pig is.    

Overall, I am still a fan of this place.  But I will admit, I do mainly go here specifically for their BBQ sticks!",eqf73ESNk8UrVCVJvlW5tA,1,0,3,KA0ik24I5p1cruGUH7zbkg

I don't really do fast food too often but I will be coming back to this spot often. It's really inexpensive too, like 7 bucks I think for two items and rice. It's similar to like Panda express where most stuff is already prepared. But the flavors of what I bought were just off the hook. Been here twice, the second time I had a little accident and my tray dropped all of my stuff on the floor.

If your hungry expect to pay more for more food because portions are a little on the small side. 

I got the usual rice with chicken BBQ stick. I got the combo which only came with two sticks of BBQ. Each stick counts as one item.

1488955,2015-05-23,2,6bU4NFkXbdbvnQBDa9-nfQ,"I've been coming to this restaurant for several years now. It's your typical Filipino restaurant with all the menu options you find at other places which makes it mediocre. My family owns a Filipino restaurant and a mini grocery store in New Jersey. So, I know how much work owning a restaurant is like.

Anyway, for me Fiesta Filipina is hit or miss. I usually order food I don't normally make at home. Food are sometimes too salty and other days they are perfectly seasoned. Some of the dishes are floating with grease than others. It would be nice if they can filter out the fats/oil. 

I ordered the 2 combo with bikol express and the caldereta. The bikol express didn't taste the same when I was here the last time. I was disappointed because that's one of my favorite entree. Anything mixed in with coconut milk I am likely to order. I ordered the caldereta and it wasn't too salty and it has a great tomato base flavor with great garnish peppers and olives. I prefer my meat cut a little thinner rather than serving it as thick chunks, but the meat is always tender. 

Overall, this is one of the many places around town I would rather go to eat Filipino food. I just wish they can be more consistent in how their food actually taste. I can see how non Filipino diners will be confused when they are not accustomed to the cuisine. However, the lumpia shanghai and pancit are always great! I dine here quite often because it's between my 2 job locations when I miss eating Filipino dishes.",pm7K54T6OmsDHREtiVBWGQ,5,4,3,UKBkFHMjFyLEgoudvz7gUg

This place is awesome when you are super hungry and are craving rice, and don't want to wait for your food to come.  It is ""buffet"" style behind the counter, meaning you point and pick what you want.  They always have a stack of barbecue sticks waiting for you.  But if you like, they also have dishes you can have made to order, like ""palabok"".

Awesome place to go and pick up food if you have relatives or friends in town and don't feel like cooking. ;)

Place was decorated with native style furniture and bamboo accents. Typical Filipino Buffet style entrees.

Sinigang na pork (soup/stew with vegetables and pork):  Good amount of pork with just the right amount of sour and salty broth flavor that's so heart-warming!

Caldereta (beef stew based on tomato sauce): Tender and Tasty pieces of Beef with its Succulent sauce makes for a Very Successful rendition of this dish! 

Beef Steak (stir fried / boiled beef slices and onions): Explosive Flavors of garlic, lemon/ycitrusy sweet and soy sauce infused within the thin fall apart beef slices and sauteed onions. Extremely Tasty!

Crispy Pata (deep fried pig): How could this not taste good.. Crunchy, Chewy and Porky! Dip it in the soy/vinegar sauce and Enjoy!

1999534,2014-03-02,1,6bU4NFkXbdbvnQBDa9-nfQ,"I've never had Filipino food, and once we walked in to the basic menu and tons of unlabeled food on display, BF confessed it had been years and he had no idea what to order. Which of course just means that we ordered nearly everything: two of their two-meat plates with rice, and a bunch of other added-on take out containers of sauces and stews, plus this and that from their appetizers and desserts section, and we were out the door with a gigantic bag of food for  $25.

 I have only a vague idea of what each item was, but it was ALL delicious! The pork adobo and a beef stew dish were probably my favorites, the crispy pata was too indulgent for me, the lumpia were downright sinful and had surprisingly little grease, the grilled skewers of chicken and beef were both very flavorful and not overly charred or burned, and the fried intestines were super salty for my tastes- but BF loved everything that I had the slightest hesitation about.
There was a vegetable and shrimp crispy pancake thing that was just alright to me, but BF raved about, and I felt that way about the dessert we had- a skewer of round balls that looked like donut holes, had a chewy center, and a slight maple-syrup-like aftertaste.

Not only did we pig out, but there were lots of leftovers. Knowing what we like here now will likely make future trips much cheaper- two 2-meat plates with rice for under $11 is amazing pricing for the portions given here.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,3,4,4,pMBuzTsEl8cJBp9RnX46pA

We planned to hang out one night after work, so he offered to pick up some food for us. I have only ever tried lumpia so I told him to get whatever. For a 2 item combo, depending what you get, it is like $6-7 and comes with white rice. We both had combos, and then he ordered lumpia and pancit! There was so. much. food. He came home with:

Lumpia shanghai
Pancit
Pork Adobo
Beefsteak
Bbq chicken skewer 
Beef stew (this has a proper name but I don't know what it is)

My favorite things were the lumpia and the bbq chicken skewers. The lumpia are bite sized, and come with a tasty sweet chili dipping sauce. They are seriously sooo delicious I couldn't stop popping them into my mouth. The bbq chicken was really good too. You get 2 skewers of chicken that is marinated in 7-up and other spices and seasonings

I did not care for the beefsteak. It was very gelatinous and there were chunks of fat swimming around in the bowl. I did like the pancit, which is similar to chow mein but has a much different flavor. I was soooo full after all that food and went into a food coma for about 4 hours. The price was amazing too! He got all that food for around $25 and we had plenty of leftovers.

I was really looking forward to trying the crispy pata, but they were all out. I also want to try the Halo Halo which is like a sweet shaved iced, and turon, which is a sweet lumpia roll. As Arnold says, I'll be back.",JYcCYNWs8Ul6ewG5kCYW4Q,3,3,4,DhI9gBq-aOAh74Cnho7T6A

I came to know that an old professional colleague of mine is now a Las Vegas resident and was quite surprised to received my unexpected call. With his directions, we eventually met at this Filipino restaurant for a quick lunch, for I intended to be driving back to LA afterwards that day.

However, the quick lunch turned out into a seemingly endless feast of Filipino cuisines and delicacies, as we talked about old times, the best of times, as well as the worst ones in the Philippines and in various countries we've been while deployed overseas.

I was glad I relented coming to Fiesta Filipina, instead of insisting for my friend to come over for buffet at the restaurant in my hotel.

Incidentally, the word ""Fiesta"" in Filipino language means feast, and that was really a sumptuous feast we had.

The next time I'll be in Vegas, I'll definitely come by this place near the southeast corner of Jones and Desert Inn.

However, I have to say that I really liked my food from Fiesta Filipina. My wife got pancit with BBQ and I got a two item combo. She sent me off to get it. I think I was the only non-Filipino there. I didn't recognize all of the items, so I had to point at things and ask what they were. I decided on banana leaves in coconut milk and kind of like a pork stew. I also got us fresh melon juice and some garlic peanuts.  Everything was very good. I have been to many Filipino restaurants with my wife, and this is hands down my favorite.

2505722,2012-10-12,12,6bU4NFkXbdbvnQBDa9-nfQ,"Fiesta Filipina is one of my go to spots for Filipino food whenever I'm in Vegas. 
I like the location, selection of food and overall atmosphere of the place.

Most Filipino restaurants in Vegas are on Maryland Parkway but this one is located on Jones Blvd. It's in at the corner of a small strip mall. I like this location because it's easy to find and get to. It's also not too crowded.

The place is small and cute. Their decor is very Filipino with welcome and goodbye signs in Tagalog. They have kawayan bamboo wood decor around. Their back wall has a neat collage of Filipino celebrities who have frequented the restaurant. There are flat screen TVs on both ends of the restaurant where people can enjoy the latest sport game on cable or something on  the Filipino channel.

This place is not a buffet, instead it is turo- turo (Tagalog for point point). There is a display of food ready to eat and you point to which dish you want. They have a vast selection of traditional Filipino foods like kare-kare (meat in peanut butter broth), caldereta (beef stew), Filipino bbq skewers (chicken and beef), beef steak (beef with onions), menudo (pork stew), sinagang ns isda (sour fish soup) and lumpia (Filipino egg rolls).  If you don't want anything from the ready made dishes,  they do have some items that you can order and they can prepare especially for you like crispy pata (fried pork). For drinks, they have Filipino cantaloupe juice and various sodas. They offer dessert too! They have halo halo (Filipino shaved ice) and turon (Filipino banana egg rolls). 

On my last visit here, I tried the kare-kare, the chicken skewers,  the beef steak and the turon. The kare kare broth on top of the white rice was a winner. I also liked the tender chicken skewers that surprisingly had a spicy kick to it. The beef steak had lots of shredded beef with onions. This one was good but a bit oily. The turon was a nice treat at the end. Crispy and sweet, the turon is a good deal for a $1. Like my previous visits, I left happy and full! I also had plenty of left over to take to-go.

I'm a Kapampangan, and early in life I was taught what good food taste like. Does this place taste like my grandma's legendary cooking? I've been working in professional kitchens for the past 6yrs, under really great chefs, and no one came close to my grandma. But their food is good enough, better than others actually. They specialize in Kapampangan food, and theirs are the most authentic Kapampangan food I've had in Vegas, aside from the ones we cook at home of course. 

They have really good crispy pata, pancit bihon, bicol express, bistek, and lechon kawali. They even have karioka which my mom loves. The only negative thing I can say about this place is that they need to stick with the traditional Kapampangan halo-halo with pastillas and macapuno, instead of the Tagalog version, and  their pancit luglug/palabok needs more consistency and flavor; they need to readjust their sauce recipe and put more shrimp in it.

I take the girl here for an after the gym treat. SMART. I got that itch that Filipinos get when they haven't eaten anything unhealthy in a minute. I talk her into going here so we can munch on chicharon bulaklak (deep fried pork intestines), lechon kawali (deep fried pork), and sinigang na baboy (a soup with pork and veges in a sour tamarind base). The bulaklak was ok. I had trouble finding the vinegar. Usually restaurants have a seasoned vinegar sauce ready to go. I had to make my own with whatever sauces and makings that they had on this small table. I had trouble looking for the secret sauce that makes all lechon just that much better. Mang Tomas!?! Where the pho'k are you?! I find it in a  weird container. The sinigan was up to par but wasn't nearly as good as the other restaurants around the way. Both me and the girl only liked the sinigan there. 

Maybe it was an off day today or maybe I better get my eats at the other spots around the way. I'll give it one more try on these main items. Allthough their crispy pata is pretty on point here. I will give them that.

Dined in and they put all the food on a plastic plate. I'm assuming it's for their convenience so they don't have to deal with dirty plates but would be nice to have a more decent plate. Of course they only have plastic utensils. Felt like I was at some sort of family gathering. Ha. 

Some dishes we got were luke warm, and some were cold. I guess this is what happens when you have a display without a heat lamp. Everything was way too salty for me. Perhaps I'm not used to Filipino cuisine? Though the noodles they had were pretty tasty, everything else we got were just ok.

Our primary home is in San Diego and we go to Erlinda's (previously Conching's) and their Filipino food is excellent with healthy portions and very consistent delicious recipes (we know as we go there often).  Fiesta Filipina Cusine  pales significantly to Erlinda's.  First of all, they a bit stingy with portions not only on rice, but with their ""ulam"".  Their prices are higher with very small portions.  We didn't mind initially about the portions but when we returned a 3rd time, their adobo (both chicken and pork) did not taste like adobo.  They doused it with sugar along with some tomato base--almost like a menudo more than adobo,,.it was very undesirable for the palate.  After this incident, we decided not to go back.  We are now looking for a better place to go.  Sorry, but we cannot recommend.",gFgL0TanRmJZE54lZVSrTQ,0,0,2,VApi44kzJyBGYcm-RJ7Yuw

 Luckily we were taking it home because it was ICE COLD in that place! Really freezing like a walk in.
 So now I'm confused. Not sure I'll go back, but enjoyed the flavor. It was early but we were the only ones anywhere near the building.

5018238,2016-08-12,1,6bU4NFkXbdbvnQBDa9-nfQ,"This probably is the best Filipino restaurant I've been too. Usually, I don't really crave or want Filipino food because the other places I've tried have been alright. I always thought it was more appetizing to look at but lacks in taste when you actually eat it. 

This is a fast food type restaurant where most of the food is already prepared sitting under heat lamps. Some stuff looked very adventurous and exotic but I recognized the staples like lechon, pork and chicken skewers, adobo, Pancit etc.  I got the combo with a beef stew and lechon. My friends ordered a bunch of different things and we all shared. We also ordered the crispy pork Patta. I loved the lechon here. The skin is so crispy!!  The pork is a good mixture of fatty and juicy. People who don't like fat won't appreciate it but I definitely do!  The beef stew I got was really good too. It was flavorful, although a bit oily, but the meat was tender and not stringy or dry at all. Loved it. I also liked their Pancit and meat skewers too. The Patta was huge!  It was really crispy and comes with various sauces. I prefer the Lechon better because the skin was crispier and the meat is more tender. 

What I didn't like was all the food was super oily, and the halo halo was a big disappointment. The ice was shaved very corse and they didn't put a lot of condensed milk so it was like eating ice with jelly in between bites. Could have done without it. 

All in all I would definitely come back for the lechon!",CQZpblGIHeMlD7KqNP7J7Q,2,3,4,Fh2XMLQyBVW6e-7DD5Qf2w

However, I don't think it's good to grab later on in the day....a few days ago I stopped in starving...since I needed to get groceries at 168 and I'd pass out before I can make it home to make dinner. It was at night maybe around 7-8 and I don't think the food has been changed at all and didnt look fresh so I walked out and went to a sit down Chinese spot instead. Bummer. I have been craving filipino food, but not when it's not fresh. 

So if I'm around early, I'll stop in for turo turo....if its late at night I'll have a go only on their cook to order crispy pata.....mmmm always a wonderful heart clogging treat and made to order palabok.",n86B7IkbU20AkxlFX_5aew,6,2,3,MllABXg4-fqb_wAdbsxSMQ

It's super yummy but not something we eat all the time so when we eat it this out favorite spot to get it at. They also serve typical Filipino dishes you can order a plate or ala carte. They also cater so you can order trays for your party's or gatherings. Perfect for when you don't want to be standing by a deep fryer frying lumpia all day. Just make sure you gets some bbq on a stick with some pancit. That's my fav ;),r0j4IpUbcdC1-HfoMYae4w,0,0,4,BN-SLvpurQmmdIHxcIg31w
5086877,2016-02-01,5,6bU4NFkXbdbvnQBDa9-nfQ,"I was stoked when my sister in law mentioned that a new Filipino restaurant opened so close to home. We decided to check it out last night. I haven't visited their other locations so I wasn't aware this place is ""turo-turo"" (cafeteria) style, basically you just ""point"" or tell them the food items you want from the ready made entrees they have. Selection was plentiful from the popular lumpia shanghai (eggrolls) to pork and chicken bbq, kare-kare, dinuguan, pinakbet, beef steak etc. Of course they had lechon which was really good. Great meat to fat ratio and crispy skin, nothing worst than a fatty and soggy lechon. Even at near closing time, the food all tasted as if they were just cooked not too long ago. But what excited me the most was they had Jeprox, what is that you ask? As my husband describes it, an abomination! Lol it's those dried fishes that they fry and are so stinky but ohhhh so good! You can't get any more authentic and local than that! 

They have several combo variations but the most popular one is the 2 entrée with rice for $6.99 which is comparable to most Filipino places. They also have items you can order ala carte like Sisig and Crispy Pata. An order of Lumpia is $5.99 for 15 pieces. For dessert they have Halo-Halo, Turon (banana lumpia) $0.99 among others.

The place is clean and inviting, much like dining in your own home. The staff is friendly, courteous and efficient in taking orders. It's nice to finally have an option close by when you're craving Filipino food but mama isn't in the mood to cook. We'll be back.",JqjAthJThuVYgTh4iWDZ2A,10,7,4,7B-Yy8Gith9MhzkOJLGuDQ

She never asked us what the problem was or if there was anything she could do to make us happy.  I am very disappointed at this place and won't be coming back.

I stopped in for some takeout.  We ordered chicken skewers and Shanghai lumpia.  Let me tell you, both items we ordered are AWESOME!  Perfectly flavored and prepared as one would expect.

This restaurant is more of s mom and pop place and I like that.  The food is prepared and set out almost like a buffet style.  The staff on the other side serves it up and then you pay.  Very efficient system.

5355566,2015-08-02,8,6bU4NFkXbdbvnQBDa9-nfQ,"If you're looking to get some authentic Filipino food, then Fiesta Filipina should be on your list of Pinoy places to try out.

The decor was quaint, wooden, and very reminiscent of traditional Phillipine household decor. I really liked the vibe of this place; the staff was all friendly and ordering went smoothly. 

It's a turo-turo place (tagalog translation: to point), so you basically point to the dish you want to order and then you pay at the end of the line. It's an easy way to try a lot of different foods in one place, to be honest. Don't expect super fancy dining either, what you see is what you get -- traditional Filipino dishes. 

I had the two item combo plate which comes with steamed rice and two choices of entrees. I picked the sinigang na bangus (milkfish in a soup that has a tamarind base) and the classic Filipino beefsteak. What a good deal because it was under $10!

The portioning for the sinigang na bangus was one fish steak with some soup, but they could've thrown in some veggies other than ginger. It had the superb sour taste, which means they put the right amount of sampalok (tamarind) in the soup.

The beefsteak was PERFECT! It had the strong kalamansi taste (more citrusy) which went well with the tenderness of the beef and sweetness of the white onion. It really was marinated to the right taste... It's making my mouth water just thinking about it! It's THE perfect pairing to your steamed rice. The steamed rice, however, was a little more on the wet side, which isn't ideal but still good to eat.

This is a good showcase of Filipino heritage. The kind of food they have out is the kind of food you actually have to (and want to!) try within the Filipino food realm. 
Oh, and they have good BBQ skewers! Ang sarap!",QtGXr3Y74fnWfdWpGJIldw,10,8,4,b7dRolHWPtJGLtmUYOMgvw

I've always left happy and full whenever I ate here or ordered food from here. The food does end up on the oily side though -- which is why this place only gets 4 stars.

My favorite here has GOT to be the crispy pata. Good for the tummy, bad for the arteries. Haha! I love eating crispy pata with just rice. Yum, yum, yum! I always bring my out-of-town peeps here!
