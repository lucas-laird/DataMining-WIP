It was the person who made our pizza. I couldn't even discuss what happened with the owner because he just kept saying that I needed to order my pizza correctly in a crude manner... I ordered a pizza with no pork (please do not put salami, ham, pepperoni or anything that has pork on it, the guy who took my order understood that) I really don't know how I could have made it anymore clear than that and I am a nice person so I'm not yelling or being rude at all. I will not be spending $39 plus a $4 tip to this place again; the pizza and gyro was ok and the owner did ask how our pizza was when we were leaving.",bs-8hLC2-egfKn_s7cIuLQ,0,0,2,fcJEBG7ct-3pY866S0Aq2Q

Now, the guy at the first one (on Tenaya) was the most friendliest, nicest, helpful man I've encountered in a while. There was an error with the online ordering, so my pizza was at this location (Charleston). Now the man at the Tenaya location was very concerned and helpful with helping me get to the right location and apologized for the error even though it wasn't on his account. This was awesome and I will make sure my encounters are only with the Tenaya location.


Now, the nitty gritty of this crap. We walk in, not greeted, the man sighs as if the appearance of my life is the absolute most disgusting piece of any human experience. I pay and we leave. I got two pizzas and garlic knots. On the way home my kid was starving so I hand her a garlic knot, she bites it and hands it right back. I taste it, it's not bad but it is chewier than a pack of Super Bubble. Not only were they chewy but on every single one, one side of the knot was extremely hard the. So the tops were perfect, the middle chewy, and the bottom hard as wood. I could understand a few or maybe even half BUT EVERY SINGLE ONE!? The pizza is sweet, not in a good or a bad way, just in a weird way that I had never experienced before. The pizza is okay, it was not hot when I picked it up, so maybe that's a factor. I kind of went into it expecting New York style pizza but that's not at all what this is.

First of all the pizzas are pretty big. It's a good amount of food for what we paid. We like more expensive pizza places so this was surprisingly great. 

The pizza tastes pretty good. Not going to lie it's not jaw dropping amazing. Hence only 4 stars instead of 5. But it's waaaaaaaay better than I thought. And we are seriously picky pizza people lol crust is kinda thin but that's to be expected with the style. Great amount of topping coverage. Not too much sauce. Decent amount of cheese. 
We got the supreme. 

We also got cheese sticks and wings. Cheese sticks were great and came with plenty of red sauce on the side. Wings were nice and crispy. Not a lot of hot sauce on them though. The wings did come with a TON of fries. Had to dig for some wings but that's not much of a complaint lol 

Not to mention we were pretty far from them and ordered delivery. Only took about half an hour. Food was still piping hot and fresh at the door. 

I would definitely recommend these guys. Only thing is when ordering through grub hub it was REALLY difficult. Items would disappear from the cart. Then appear twice. Then wouldn't accept our card.

1448102,2016-06-08,9,ai8nfTBNvL579cjIuqZajQ,"Typical pizza takeout spot with saucy pies, various apps, salads, and lunch specials. The pizza is their forte, but I can't say I'm the hugest fan- as others have mentioned, the sauce is a bit too sweet for my liking and it was a touch greasier than I would have liked. However, the slices are huge and reasonably priced and a $4-5  slice is filling enough to be your entire lunch! The pepperoni is solid but the veggie slice is my go-to.

The salads are huge and fresh, and the gyro version in particular comes topped with tons of tasty protein. They also offer their gyros with fries as a cheap lunch special on Wednesdays, though I didn't particularly care for their tzatziki as it was mostly plain sour cream. Each day has it's own discounted special, though. 

Service is pretty stellar- the guys working take my order, make it fresh, and have it ready in under 10 minutes even when I don't remember to call ahead. Dining in here IS an option, unlike other takeout-exclusive spots.

Really? $3 dollars in material and 10 minutes for $22? You should be ashamed! My original thought was he could have made a happy customer had he either cooked the size pizza I wanted originally, or offered me another for free.

It's in a small strip mall on Durango and Charleston, right next to CVS and Popcorn Girl. After moving all day, cooking was the last thing we wanted to do, so we decided on pizza. I found this place via yelp, and from there found their menu online. They have pizza, wings, sandwiches, salads and appetizers. They also have lunch specials, and what caught my eye was their anytime specials. One of the specials is 2 large cheese pizzas for $19. Seems like a good deal! Any additional toppings are $1.50 extra. So I got one just cheese, and then added pepperoni and sausage on the other, and an order of garlic knots. Total came to $28 and the guy who took my order said it would be ready in about 20 minutes. He sounded busy so I told him not to rush. 

We showed up around 30 minutes later, and the pizza was just coming out of the oven so it was fresh and hot! A minute later, the garlic knots came out and I saw the guy brush the tops of them with butter. I knew they were going to be good.  I also added a couple sides of ranch to go with the garlic knots. So we get home and the pizza was just OK. The sauce is a bit sweeter than others, and the crust was a bit flimsy. The garlic knots were also just OK. I really liked the marinara sauce that accompanied them. I think it is the same sauce they use on the pizza. The ranch though, was bomb! It is homemade and has a delicious garlicky flavor to it. So yeah this place was just OK, good but nothing amazing. I may be back to try the wings and possibly another pizza special.",JYcCYNWs8Ul6ewG5kCYW4Q,2,0,3,Q2ATFp2UZxmv1T_yvw_dyA

So we order it another night when both of us are too lazy to cook. this time we use a coupon deal that included an order of hot wings and soda. We both fill up on the pizza but I managed to get in two hot wings just to try them out. They tasted fine. But they weren't. Nope, not even close.

That night I was sick beyond belief. FOOD POISONING from the hot wings. They were either undercooked or were left out for too long or something.

DIng, ding, ding, we have a winner!

Orders hot wings (with fries), Gyro (with fries) & jalapeno poppers.

Ordered over the phone for pick up. Gave special instructions for the gyro (only lamb, sauce and lettuce, no onions or tomatoes). Wanted my hot wings medium and extra ranch.

The gyro was for the hubby, so i didnt try it. He stated that it was good with lots of lamb but the cucumber sauce was lacking something. 

We both ate the jalapeno poppers and i have to say they were the best poppers i've ever had. No joke. So soft, yet crunchy. So juicy and good. The sour cream inside was perfect! Gosh, i want some now!! They tasted homemade, not bought. Being a foodie, i can tell the difference.

The fries were good. Not soggy, but crunchy. Their ranch is good. Plus they followed the instructions and gave us extra.. for no charge! I personally thought they gave way too many, I couldnt eat them all. I guess i should stop complaining. 

My wings were good. At first sight I thought what a rip because it looked as if they had no sauce. But then I noticed the sauce was some what at the bottom and once I tasted them I realized it was the perfect amount. It made them nice and sauced, not soggy. It was a good amount and i left 2, which my hubby ate.

The prices at this place are well worth it. 

It only took 15 minutes for our food to be ready. Pretty good, normal amount of time.

First the pasta was AWFUL, there was no flavor.. at all. There was melted cheese on top and I couldn't even taste that. Alfredo is supposed to be creamy, yummy, and this was far from it. Ive literally had better from the grocery stores freezer section. The pasta itself was mushy, really mushy. The garlic bread tasted like oil, no garlic taste at all, no butter-y goodness, just oily and tough (like chewing beef jerky)

The pizza was weird, like the crust was almost cardboard-y, the sauce had a strong sweet taste like they added to much sugar, its got a strong basil taste as well. The cheese had no flavor again, it was almost fake tasting. The sausage I got on it reminded me of ground beef thats how SMALL the chunks were. 

The salad was even odd. For one they put it in the SAME bag as the pasta which means it was warm, and sweated. The tomatoes were slices (how much energy does it take to chop a freaking tomato) and the cucumbers were soggy. Lettuce as meh, but what got me is the ranch was gross. It tasted like a cole-slaw dressing mixed with ranch. Sweet and mayonnaise-y with an odd powdered ranch taste. 

The soda was good though, perhaps its because they didn't make it. They took over an hour to deliver and they are less than a mile away.

3203601,2012-03-01,9,ai8nfTBNvL579cjIuqZajQ,"In a world gone mad there is very little someone can hold on to as true, as right, as constant. Rex Marvin is that person. Rex Marvin's search for the greatest food and the most huffable gasoline makes him the tragic figure that in literature would get the girl, save the day, and have the most severed heads in jars in his basement (if it was a Disney book).  The good news people, is that all of those things in real life are true.  If you consider a graveside ditch near the freeway to be a ""basement"".  Rex does. Recently, Rex was accosted for no reason.  Rex and his woman, Three Legged Midget Maggie, were minding our own business.  Rex was casually tossing TLMM up in the air until she was able to grab onto a ledge and let herself in.  Rex tossed her and she didn't come down. A sure sign that TLMM has accomplished her mission. Rex turns around to have 4 metro cops staring at him. They were big. They were not smiling.  Rex decided to break the ice.  Rex asked ""How many buy one get one free garden hose or industrial blacktop sealant coupons does it take to get 4 cops to walk away and pretend like they saw nothing?"" The next thing Rex knew he saw flashes of light. Rex smiled. Darkness. Rex woke up on the floor of a squad car while the cops talked about the loser they beat and were taking into custody. It must have been someone else.

Rex's left eye was shut but he saw that they had stopped at a gas station. They talked about food. They were getting gas station pasta. The smaller one looked back to check on Rex, and said that he was in the mood for ""frozen noodles in sauce"". Rex closed his eyes and tried not to vomit at the idea. He felt with his food that the back door wasn't closed all the way. Rex dislocated his wrists, slipped off the cuffs, and pushed the door open...and much like the time Rex woke up in Candice Bergen's bedroom...he was out before something that could never been taken back happened.  Not going to jail...no Rex can do hard time...but smelling heated frozen pasta is something that Rex will not endure.  Rex has endured more than most. Remember, Rex lived in drag as Jodi Foster's lesbian lover for 3 years...Rex HAS ENDURED! Still everyone has a line not to cross. One of Rex's is frozen pasta...the other is participating in the underground black market 8 track tape racket...lucrative, but Rex only needs to lose 3 toes to know that some money just isn't worth it. Rex has brains.

Rex needed to cleanse himself from the memory of that awful experience...so Rex ran. He crawled. He climbed into someone's trunk. He eventually reached the closest place he could find...Manhattan Pizza.  It is in a strip mall behind a bank and near a place that sells fancy popcorn, and none of that bodes well...but ignore the warning signs and go in.

There are a few staples in an Italian restaurant, and one of them is the Chicken Parm. If you can't make a lights out Chicken Parm then you should close your doors. Manhattan makes a very good one. The chicken is tender, the batter is crispy, the mozzarella is good and the sauce is great. Their red sauce is excellent. Just the right amount of garlic and acidity. The pasta is always cooked well, never over cooked and mushy. The next is meatballs. Manhattan makes a very good meatball; it is almost all meat and no unnecessary fillers. Lastly, can it make a pizza...a great pizza...and Manhattan...excels! Rex is more the New York style pizza kind of man. If you like a doughy crust, you are a hick, and this place might not be for you. They do put a lot of toppings on it, and that is a good thing. 
The truth about Manhattan is the same truth people say about Rex Marvin...almost everything is good.  There isn't too much Rex hasn't tried he didn't like. The fried foods are all good, with a nod to the mozzarella sticks.  The pastas are all good and have good sauces.  The Alfredo could have some more parmesan cheese in it for Rex's taste, but you shake some more on and it is good.  

The prices are too high. Period. The food is good, but Rex finds himself not going because for the same amount of money there are better options. If they dropped the prices Rex would eat there a lot more.

There are a lot worse places to go than Manhattan especially for the pizza. They do a very good job at New York style pizza, not perfect but a very good job.  They obviously care and try hard to make a quality product.  Sometimes they succeed better than others, but it is never awful. Rex can appreciate that. Just like Three Legged Midget Maggie, sometimes it takes a few throws, but she always tries. She always gives an effort...and in the end of the day...that means something.  Rex doesn't know what it means, but it means something.

Mahattan isn't Rex's first choice. It isn't even his second or third, but in a pinch it is good. It is really a 2 1/2 star place. Order right, catch it on the right night, it can be very good.

It was still piping hot and it was cooked perfectly. Being the last customer of the day it's normal to worry whether or not the food is prepared right. No worries here, the pie was great. 

I ordered a pepperoni and cheese and it was spot on. It was very flavorful and the cheese was cooked perfectly. The dough was the perfect crispy and they put the perfect amount of sauce on the pie. You can tell that the pepperoni was not on the cheap, rather it tasted of a higher-quality pepperoni. I also ordered the cinnamon breadsticks and they were fresh and cooked perfectly also. 

The two gentlemen that delivered my pie were friendly, unlike a lot of places that deliver.

3516822,2013-08-11,17,ai8nfTBNvL579cjIuqZajQ,"I have passed by this place several times and finally decided to give it a try for dinner. When I went to pick up the pizza it wasn't ready yet so I had a chance to chit chat with one of the employees. They are very proud of the pizza here. I was told they use 100% mozzarella cheese, fresh (never canned) ingredients, crust that is made from scratch daily, and the pizzas are cooked in brick ovens. Aside from pizza they also offer calzones, burgers, subs, chicken fingers & wings, gyros, pasta, ribs, salads, sandwiches, and appetizers. 

They have pizzas in sizes 12"" (meduim), 16"" (large), 20"" (giant), and 28"" (colossal) inch. I like the variety of sizes and the 28"" sounds interesting! I just decided to order a 20 inch ""Pepperoni Pizza"" that ended up costing a total of $18.37 with tax. The pizza wasn't bad. I liked the flavor of the sauce and amount of cheese. I don't know if they use garlic in the sauce or crust, but I tasted a distinct garlic flavor that I liked. The 20 incher was to big for me and hubby, so I had leftovers to take in my lunch to work the next day. I found the price of the pizza to be flat out ridiculous! Sure it tasted good, and I would eat it again, but not without some sort of really good coupon.

I was given a menu with my pizza and discovered they have a variety of specials. If you are just wanting pizza then they have a walk-in special for the 12"", 16"", and 20"" inch sizes, but I still didn't find it a fair price at all. They have different specials if you are ordering more then one pizza, or want to mix it up and have maybe pizza and pasta. You can also just stop in for lunch and order pizza by the slice. From 11 am - 3 pm they have a different daily special. The ""Daily Special"" is priced at $6.99 and comes with a soda. These prices don't sound bad for what you get. Here are the current daily specials:

*Monday - any pasta with garlic bread
*Tuesday - any salad with garlic bread
*Wednesday - lamb or chicken gyro with fries
*Thursday - phily steak or chicken philly with fries
*Friday - meatball sub or chicken parm sub with fries
*Saturday - pastrami sub or french dip sub with fries
*Sunday - italian sub or ham and cheese with fries

Delivery is offered with a minimum $15 purchase with-in delivery range of the store. Catering is also offered. If you want to order online you can do that too right from their website.

We've ordered chicken tenders from here many times and were charged for them but received chicken wings instead. This has happened multiple times. When going back they did not even apologize and  they just took the wings back and made us wait for the chicken tenders to be made. Horrible customer service. The food here is WAY OVER PRICED.

I ordered a large cheese pie and was really excited to get home and eat it. My review may be one sided since I'm not a huge fame of red sauce, much less sweet red sauce, which is what was on my pie.

The location is easy to find and 5 mins from my place, I walked in and was not greeted and felt awkward. I let them know I had placed and order after a man from the back came over to me. My pie was ready, but I was not offered any cheese or peppers. 

The pie was just ok, we actually had left overs for 3 days, which is rare with pizza. The pie is a decent size, and the cheese is somewhat plenty, but the texture wasn't quite right.

I honestly don't know what it is that we love, but the pizza tastes so good! It's the crust and the sauce and the cheese. Aaahhhhh, cheeeese. The crust is a perfect thickness, not thick like a pan and not greasy at all and not too thin that it will snap or break in half. The slices are a great size and you can fold them!!! I love folding pizza, it just makes it taste so much better.

The cheese always tastes fresh and the sauce is neither sweet nor salty.

My husband always orders hot wings with our pizzas and he thinks they taste great. They also have these 2 foot pizzas that are made for large parties. Huge pizza!

We have never had any rudeness with any employees and they have always been nice to us.

4838457,2016-11-11,0,ai8nfTBNvL579cjIuqZajQ,There are 3 top pizza places in Las Vegas and this is one of them. When you walk in it feels like a New York pizza place even the booths remind me of the ones in some of the best fast service style joints in NYC. They have a 30 inch pizza! That's as wide as a standard door! And the price is great too. Lost a star (would only be half a star if I could) for the chicken philly cheese steak that was a little dry and burnt bun. Their pizza will is way above average though.,MaG80i7XnyA6P7feRUKeEA,0,0,4,fhBpAGpyABfc2fekPi89WA

New to the area, I wanted to try a local pizzeria instead of the usual Papa Johns. Knowing we were going with the 28"" colossal pizza, I preordered it. The gentleman on the phone (I think was an owner) was professional, personable, and guaranteed our pizza would be ready at the time I needed it by. 

We were not disappointed. The pizza was so big, I had to fit it in my trunk. Our group of self-proclaimed foodies, ate damn near the whole pie! Having soooooo many options to eat in Vegas, its hard to become a regular at a place. I don't foresee that becoming an issue with Manhattans. The pizza sauce is a sweet, the cheese on top was the right amount, the pepperoni spicy. 

Great local business, give it a try. I think it might be pizza night, tomorrow :)",VhNZAYpP7XV0ZB3VsiQQmw,0,0,5,iG7Ey2cXYtwZxNJehBLy9w

 I'm still in shock over what took place. I'm running an event at the JW Marriott and decided that pizza and salad sound just right after a long hard day. I ordered because the pizza sounded good and they deliver. I ordered a Large pizza $16.99 and a Large salad $5.99. The total was $32. with a $2.50 deliver charge and tax my total should have been $27.28.

After the driver left I decided to look up the prices as it didn't sound right. Sure enough I was over charged. I called up and the guy on the phone handed me off to the guy that placed my order. He had a very heavy accent. He first told me they changed their prices yesterday. To which I challenged and then he said the delivery charge is $7 and when I told him that on the phone he told me the delivery charge is $2.50 he then said the Large Pizza is $19.99 to which I said no it says $16.99. He then said since I did half and half so he charged me for 2 medium pizza's to which I said you don't even have a Medium on your website only Small and Large. He then said well the difference is the tip to the driver. Of which I said you don't get to decide how much I tip the driver. He then had the nerve to tell me that I'm over at the JW Marriott having fun, he can charge me whatever he wants and I should just enjoy my pizza. 

I then realized that since my cell number is an 818 area code that this guy thinks I'm a tourist and is fully taking advantage. Not only am I a Las Vegas local but I also run events in Las Vegas. He said that I shouldn't be arguing over $5. It's the principle not the money and I don't like being taken advantage of. 

Hopefully this happened to me because I do question things and I will speak up. I hope this review will help save someone the frustration. 

As for the food. Here is my review. The salad was good, no complaints. The pizza was OK, not bad but not great or even good. I'd say it was similar to Papa Johns. 

There are way better pizza places in town and especially on this side of town. If you want deliver go with Papa Johns if you want awesome pizza try Eastside Pizza or Nathans. Not only will you be very pleased with the food but you don't have to worry about being taken advantage of.

Domino's Pizza is better than this pizza!

NY Style?  NOT even close!  Been to NY many many times and this does not even come close to NY style.

The crust is THICK and NY style is THIN!

There was so much Basil on the one pie and over powered everything else to do with the Pizza!

The second pizza had pepperoni and they added no were close to the amount of topping of the basil.

Next, their site says $2 delivery charge but once you CLICK pay you are charged a $5 deliver charge.  They do not have their own delivery drivers but out source to some driving company.  

The DRIVER was VERY rude!

So 2 medium pizza's with one topping each cost $26.00!

If you want GOOD NY style pizza then may I suggest  ""Upper Crust"", ""Rocco's Pizza"" or ""Mark Rich's Pizza"".  In vegas this is the CLOSEST NY style pizza places I've ever had.",lOdPa2iTgNrhCy8ImOwhNg,2,0,1,kp1YsttLQfhore826ilsvg

The last time I ordered the eggplant it was such a disaster I'm afraid to order again. It was not only overcooked to the point of dryness and burnt eggplant, but they had, for some reason, put ricotta into the mx somehow, creating a weird graininess. I don't know if they botched an order, mixed two orders together or what and then tried to get rid of it by sending it out, but it turned me off altogether.

This is a killer good pizza joint. 

Philly cheesteak pizza -- 5 out of 5 as close to a outstanding pizza I have had. There sauce is really good almost like a creamy Alfredo sauce cheese witch to me makes the pizza is high quality stuff. Also this is a pie that you can fold has nice shape and taste to the dough. This is def. a lighter style pizza not too heavy seasoning are nice on the pizza also good quality steak. A must try.

Also got chicken wings--  these comes french fries witch I was a little shocked at first and thought I got the wrong order. The Chicken wings are jumbos really good and clean tasting not fryer like witch is nice. Also the french fries where really good to also came with celery and carrots . Ohh get the blue cheese dressing I think its in house made and just amazing !!

Barry V you need to try this place .
