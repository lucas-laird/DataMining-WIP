My girlfriend stated that the chicken was mushy and bland.  After one bite I knew we would not return because of the look on her face.  My dish was a bit salty for my taste.  1 star because the place was too dark for the lunch hour (what are you hiding???) and there was a leak on the floor coming from the bar area...AND I don't like to see my girlfriend frown when she eats...next...",BRgdkgZoq5ePvGa9X6n7Ag,2,1,1,9EY1LI1fTh0iweQUP8zGLQ
446277,2016-08-01,0,4NxIM5xpIEem1IkEkz2I7Q,"This place is good for a quick lunch. You get chips and salsa while you wait for your food. Once you place your order, the food comes out rather quickly and they tend to be prompt with bringing the bill. 

Their menu is large. They have all of the familiar dishes with the familiar (proteins/queso/salsas) served on: burritos,  tacos, tamales, chimichangas, fajitas etc. They have burgers, breakfast dishes, menudo, and even some regional specialties. I enjoy their Pollo entr√©es (tequila or Diablo chicken), but if you don't want to spend much, they also have lower priced lunch specials. 

At lunch time on a weekday, we never have to wait to be seated. This is a very casual restaurant (and kind of old looking inside) so if you're looking to impress a date,  you might to step it up a notch and look elsewhere. If you are just looking for good food, this is a decent place.",INHFOcLzPBFAEO9QHbQ6Pw,1,1,4,lBVeckq-_qYOr_HuK_JAnA

I have been back occasionally and the food is consistently authentic Mexican food and the wait staff take good care of you.  I have had Mexican food at other locations in Las Vegas, but  I think this place out  does the rest by far.  The prices are reasonable and they have a nice lunch menu.

I'm glad he did because this place is a pretty nice lunch spot. Service is fast here and were continuously receiving refills on water, chips and salsa during our meal. I wasn't sure what to get and opted for a supreme carnitas burrito w/ green sauce. It was a ton larger than what I was expecting and was very filling, as they were generous with the meat, beans and rice inside the burrito. The carnitas pork was chopped and moist, which I liked...some places do carnitas shredded or fried, which I don't like as much. Will definitely be keeping this place in mind in the future when going out to lunch near the office.",zBi_JWB5uUdVuz3JLoAxGQ,2,0,4,lB7Ugoe-BeCRpcQ-p4nmhg

You're not paying for atmosphere, but great service and good food! 

My business partner and I stopped in for some soup. She ordered the Tortilla, I ordered the Albondigas.
The Albondigas, had 3 large meatballs, but chunks of vegetables in a nice tomato broth. 

We also split the mexican shrimp cocktail. One of my favories, shrimp, cucumber, pico de gallo and avocado emerged in a sweet tangy tomato sauce. Will definitely order again on my next visit.",Zb2T6JhcBGzgc6RWmldbDg,1,0,4,KCbTzq8IC08Ht6iEUI68yA

We happened in here, on our way to meet some friends for cocktails. Deciding we wanted to have quick bite before.

The interior could use a little love, but has all the charm of a cute little place.

Even though the dining room was busy, I felt very taken care of by the waitress,
I ordered the cheese enchilada with green sauce.It came out hot and tasty. 
And the menu is not expensive, even the seafood dishes which I saw coming out of the kitchen. And they looked really good!

I would go back! Would I travel across town to go, not so sure about that. Would I suggest it after a day of Outlet Shopping?? HELL'YA!",y5rqDe6uO06WKZ26-Pla8g,0,1,3,KKWbLn_p_uWpiuSZ_eU9ZQ

The food is decent and the prices are in line with similiar establishments. I chose the beef chimichanga from the list of lunch specials. If I remember correctly, the price was $6.95 plus a beverage. The lunch specials are offered with rice and beans. I opted for all beans and no rice. I think all the waitress heard was ""no rice."" I received it as ordered. No rice and No extra beans. Next time I'll order ""no arroz. doble frijoles.""  The chimichanga was actually quite tasty, but not very large. The service was fast and friendly enough, complete with plenty of chips and salsa. The salsa was great, however, the chips were cold. Good, but cold. This wasn't some place I would drive out of the way for, but would visit again. Overall, it was ok. Nothing to prompt an extra star, but also nothing to be too disappointed about either.",18xIAA444UuAWwEWiPCW-A,1,1,3,P4TpWjnJ6xs1BJKH40RZsw

I've been going here for lunch for over a decade and they are always quick to seat, serve, refill and get you your check in lightening speed. 

During lunch I never have to wait for a seat. The owner always walks around and chats with the patrons. I see many of the same folks each time I go. It feels like home to me... comfortable, casual, and good food.

My favorite is their salsa... it's sooo good!

Rumor has it they are moving to a new location next year. I look forward to their new home...as long as they stick close by and promise to not change the food!",X21PenoIOsBQB4gQyAJ8DQ,6,6,4,xoC1uw2IrHxk377Goek5sg

This is the only halfway decent restaurant close to my office, so I am a regular here.  Service is also friendly and fast.  The chips and salsa are pretty solid and the lunch specials will fill you up and not break the bank.  I highly recommend the #5 Chile Verde Burrito plate which comes with refried beans and rice.  I've also tried the adobada taco and it's pretty good, although not as good as Tacos El Gordo.  This is truly weird, but I really love the water at this place.  Yeah, I said water.

4146948,2013-07-03,2,4NxIM5xpIEem1IkEkz2I7Q,"I am not overly impressed by La Cabana.  I ordered a lunch special consisting of a shredded beef soft shelled taco, two pork tamales, rice and beans.  The taco had good enough flavor but the shell was soggy from sitting in a foam box and basically steaming in its own juices.  The tamales had the right meat to masa ratio but was a bit bland.  The red sauce was almost paste-y.  Some more spice and some more salt would have been a nice touch.  The rice, on the other hand, had too much salt for my liking.  I almost always eat all of my rice from a Mexican restaurant.  Not today.  And the refried beans I don't think were cooked all the way through.  I found a couple of crunchy beans and so I did not finish them.  If there is a silver lining to that gassy cloud it is that the beans were almost obviously homemade.  I don't know the last time I found crunchy beans in a can.  At $10 for this meal, I am disappointed. I don't know that I will be back.  But at least I gave La Cabana a try.

I stopped by looking for a quick cheap meal and was pleasantly surprised. 
The ambience and the service was good. This place seems popular for lunch with more than 7 full tables. The chips were so-so (flour?), but the salsa was good. 
I had the tacos al pastor which were good.

5278096,2015-05-01,3,4NxIM5xpIEem1IkEkz2I7Q,"La Cabana was voted best place to get lunch for under $10 by the Review Journal's ""Best of Las Vegas"". La Cabana gets a solid three stars - not overly impressed but not disappointed either. This small restaurant is located right next to a UMC and Clark County's Social Services. I was in the area and chose La Cabana because it was the closest eatery that popped up in the Yelp's app search bar. 

BREAKFAST BURRITO ($7.95): Comes with a side of beans and rice. The burrito has eggs, hashbrowns, onion, cilantro and cheese. Of course I said hold the onions! Overall, a tasty burrito. 3.5/5 Rice was better than most I've had at Mexican restaurants and the refried beans were average. 

SERVICE: La Cabana's was real busy at 12PM on a Tuesday. I had to stand awkwardly by my lonesome for about 2 minutes before I was seated. Servers aren't ones to chat or smile, but they're efficient! 3/5

COMPLIMENTARY CHIPS AND SALSA: Chips were a bit crunchy and the salsa was boring. I only ate like 3 chips, which is unusual since I usually eat the whole basket! 2/5 

Random tid bit: I second Heather H.'s opinion that the water tastes good here!

Worth a Return Visit?
This isn't in my neck of the woods, so probably not.

My lunch was pretty basic and it consisted of two
chicken enchiladas with beans and rice. It took an extremely loooooooong time to receive the food which I thought was unusual. I looked around a couple of times and there was not that many people dining with us. When the food finally arrived, I was a
bit surprised. How hard can it be to make tasty enchiladas? The sauce was really bland and virtually had no flavor. The chicken didn't appear to have been seasoned. In the past my meals were not amazing but not as bad as this particular lunch. 

I understand with the Neon project taking place that they are going to move from this location. I am hopeful that the new location will warrant better food and more stars! 

I have to say that although it took forever to receive my order, the service was still really good and this is the reason for the third star.",Y3PQ5P_R7jcgiIS_1dIv-w,5,3,3,wWbpbVHG0xvVQrF_2Qojeg
