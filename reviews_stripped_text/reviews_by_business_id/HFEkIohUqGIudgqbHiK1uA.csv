Scrambled eggs are real and not powdered like at a buffet. Service is usually very good have had 1 semi-bad one though. Never had cold food. Coffee never dry. No upset stomach. Just always consistent. Tables,seats,floor,windows,utinsels,cups,and plates are always clean. No smoking.
 Some things I don't like,but still consistent. We always have to ask for more cream,sugar,and jelly. They are provided at the table just low or empty. The Steak with steak and egg's is thin. They ask you how would you like it cooked and I don't know why. Rare or Med rare is impossible. Tell them medium and it well be well done! It's just to thin! Better deals on that elsewhere. Home fries aren't fresh potatoes but the wife digs them. You are going to pay over $10 per person. Biscuits and Gravy are $10.99. I've don't think I have ever seen them over $6-7 any place else.

I'm sorry I tried twice and I'm afraid of coming back here after the last experience. The first time i came here with my sis and the guy, the food AND service was awful. I thought I'd give it another shot and I did-- and I don't know what the hell I was thinking. I should've left when the guy and I walked in and the place only had about 8 patrons including the both of us. We were seated and the lady seemed nice. Scanned the menu and looked at the prices, and it seemed pricier than the other breakfast places. Anyway, to make things short, we were seated, drink orders were taken, lady said she'd give us a couple of minutes--uh, more like forever. She even apologized she said she thought we were still looking at the menus, but really we were looking at our phones(YELPING..). The guy ordered steak and eggs(15 bucks) and I ordered two eggs(over easy) with a side of toast. Again, we waited. Not as long as we did earlier but it seemed like a while. THEN, the food came. Oh wait did I mention they ""don't do medium rare steak orders"" here. And it all made sense. The steak was bad! I mean it stank and it was old! Not to mention the fact that it made my bf sick. I should've told him to stop eating it when I smelled it. Uggh... And then came my eggs....how do you mess up eggs??!?!? Over easy--not sunny side up. Damn it cracked egg...

I really wish we enjoyed this place as much as the others did. But really? I'm probably being  generous right now by giving them two stars.

Unfortunately, we have been directed to not wear our uniform off base and even after telling them that, they still refused to offer me a discount. I am not greedy, nor do I expect people to always give the military a discount, I just appreciate it when they do since it makes me feel like the country we are supporting and defending are also supporting us. 

I will most likely still go back to the cracked egg for their good food and coffee but just wanted to give the other military members a heads up of their discount policy.

536872,2015-12-31,2,HFEkIohUqGIudgqbHiK1uA,"So I have been coming to this Cracked Egg pretty much since it opened years ago. I say I average at least once a week or more either for lunch or breakfast.  Often hit the other locations as well depending on where my day brings me. That's a lot of pancakes.  

Always been a fan, and sad to say that the poor experiences that I have had most recently actually prompted me to create a yelp account. Normally I would just voice such concerns to the manager, but sad to say I don't really think he would be receptive.  He seems more interested in socializing than he does running this place to the standards set by the other Cracked eggs.  I hope the owner reads this, because i am one of those regulars that would always tell his friends about how good all of these restaurants were.  Not going to happen again.  I speak from experience as a customer, and as an operator. 

My last visit ,  four other tables seated... 10 minutes for a waitress to stop talking to her friends that she was eating with and come take my order.   Another 15 minutes  before the order came out (eggs, bacon, toast, fruit). This has become pretty much a routine occurrence.  Staff- I am not paying to watch you eat and socialize with each other, and your friends that you bring in.  And for life of Gordon Ramsey- don't sit down and eat yourself, then get up, not wash your hands, and then bring me my order when you feel like it-  WITH a mouthful of food!!!  Who does this??

Portion sizes have always been consistent as a rule with this brand. Lately, they seem to vary from huge to tiny.   Food costs must be a treat to chart here.  Flavors always varied, I guess depending on who is cooking as of late.  Cleanliness?  Brush crumb on floor- then step on throughout day.  

Oh BTW, the spill on the floor that nobody cleaned up... almost caused me to kill myself. But hey, as long as  the staff have time to text on their phone and update facebook between sitting down to chat with friends...what's one more dead customer right? 

No follow up on refills or up selling on staff's part anymore.  I am sure the owner is glad to know that rather than supervising, the manager generally leaves well before the staff at closing. Seen that at least a half dozen times in the last two months.  No side work, or clean up being done when slow.  Have seen tables take ten minutes to get bused, floors routinely filthy, and bathroom a horse wouldn't use. 

3 Visits in the last two weeks. Each one more disappointing than the last.  Staff generally unorganized and disinterested.  A continuous flow of new employee faces over the last few months tells me their is a general leadership problem.  I remember years going by where the same cashiers, busboys , waiters and waitresses were on like clockwork. At my last visit,  I heard one waitress tell another that she wasn't told if she was working  tomorrow????  Wasn't told yet by closing???  Communication is key in hospitality. 

Attention to detail no more.  The staff might not care about my $200 or so a month they will be losing in the future, but i am sure the owners might care about the 50 other customers like me who have been noticing the same race to the bottom.

they were OKAY. the menu was super exciting to look at but the overall experience was mediocre.


my bf and i ordered (we ate half and then swapped) :

""the Californian"" (half a avocado and two full slices of bacon in the omelet and some jack cheese on top) 
  -it tasted good, but it wasn't anything special, probably could have made it at home for less than i paid for.

""the GVP"" ( lil mushroom, lil spinach, half avocado and muenster cheese topped with sour cream) 
 - wished there was more filling to it, it was mostly egg. tasted almost the same as the other omelet.
 
it comes with toast or coffee cake and hash browns or potatoes. 

when i first saw the plate i was surprised at the portion size!
... but then  remember how much it cost.   $10.  

i left that restaurant filling unsatisfied.

by all means the quality is much better than denny's or ihop, only if you want to shell out the extra bucks to pay for it. 

if you're on a budget, i would suggest making you're own breakfast at home, unless you're a horrible cook, its going to taste around the same.

But if you go after 8:30 on a weekend, expect to wait a long time (outside) to be seated, once you're seated it will take a while before anyone takes your order, your food will take a while (get the coffee cake, it's made daily, and will make the long wait time to get your food feel shorter), and you probably won't see the waiter again once you get your food (we usually order our food when they take our drink orders, otherwise you wait a lot). Paying the bill is done at the same counter as the check-in so it gets crowded. The Cracked Egg on Cheyenne has the same food and MUCH BETTER service.

955284,2013-02-28,0,HFEkIohUqGIudgqbHiK1uA,"This place reminds me of Babystacks because of the similar presentation of food and portions! Cracked Egg's menu, though, is a bit bigger (not inferior though!) It's a breakfast/lunch place open from 6am-2pm Monday-Friday and 6am-3pm Saturday and Sunday.

We came here on Saturday around lunchtime. It felt a bit weird when we saw a $5 bill at our table when we got seated. Of course, we assumed that it was for the waiter and that it had been from a previous visitor. When our waiter came, he surreptitiously slipped it in his pocket. Haha no worries. Our drink runner was nice, but I got the feeling she was a bit inexperienced (e.g. spilling drinks, telling us she need to clear our table in order for use to be seated). Not a big deal though.

The menu came with plenty of add-on options and pretty exhaustive menu full of breakfast/lunch choices like skillets, make-your-own skillets, burgers, sandwiches, and even just the simple stuff like eggs and omelets. Definitely fun to check out.

I got the Huevos Rancheros and my boyfriend got the Mexican skillet. The eggs were intertwined with the flurry of cheese, jalapenos, beans, salsa, and giant dollop of sour cream on top. It comes with your choice of hash browns or seasoned potatoes. I got the seasoned potatoes which came in its own dish of small cubed potatoes poised perfectly in spices and fried. A bit crunchy on the outside, but soft on the inside. The dish was definitely LDL-cholesterol-inducing. But whatever, I'm here to eat and cure post-First Friday regrettable drinking habits.

At first I thought their portions were small, but that was just the presentation. Our skillets came in sleek oblong casserole bowls served on white plates so it kind of fooled me for a second there. By the end of the meal I was dying to finish the last bite. I felt it was perfectly portioned and tasty too! It had this ""home-cooked"" feeling to it and completely savory, mouth-wateringly good. Surprisingly, my Huevos Rancheros wasn't doused in grease like I was expecting it to be, (haha like that's still any better for you at all) so I wasn't chomping down on anything oily. And my plate WASN'T dripping with fatty oil on the bottom like at Denny's. Adds to the quality of the food for sure. It's the little things you have to think about that sets the joint apart.

This place is a step-up in quality and taste from your usual Denny's and IHOPs for your usual prices ($5-$14ish). Of course at your local Denny's there's that sexy super value menu for that quick bite, but hey, this is yelp and you want a quality breakfast/lunch locale off the beaten path right? It's worth a venture that's a great restaurant--clean and courteous. Service was attentive for me! Make sure to sign up for their loyalty card service if you plan on frequenting! There's some perks involved and why not? I know I'm definitely coming back here.",tQvoC8V-kvw6t0VIBbrd9A,1,0,4,AzRpI54-4vS2D8mdqR2qxg

1033787,2017-12-25,0,HFEkIohUqGIudgqbHiK1uA,"I used to enjoy going here, but unfortunately, its service has gone considerably downhill, and I really wouldn't recommend it these days.

On my last visit, I called ahead for pickup, and I was told it would be 10 minutes.  When I arrived 10 minutes later, I paid and was told it would be right out.  For about the next 10 minutes, I watched what appeared to be my meal sitting out while other meals were shuffled around it.  When it finally arrived at the host's station, I expected to be handed my meal, but instead, the woman working there set it on top of a stack of chairs and went back to sitting around looking miserable.  I've had the displeasure of dealing with this woman the past few times I've been there, and she always seems over everything.  After a few minutes went by, I asked her if that was my meal sitting there, and she rolled her eyes and said, ""Your meal had a diet Pepsi.  I don't see a drink sitting here.""  I assumed someone else might have ordered the same thing, so I went back to quietly waiting.

After 30 minutes of waiting, I asked the man at the station if he could tell me if that was my meal.  He said it wasn't, so I resumed waiting.  After 45 minutes of waiting, he said it was my meal and handed me the bag and turned away.  When I asked him to have it remade, he seemed surprised, and I had to explain that I didn't want to eat a meal that had been sitting out for the better part of an hour.  To his credit, he did go immediately to the kitchen and have them expedite it.  Nearly an hour of waiting later, I had a meal in-hand.  Unfortunately, the meal I received wasn't even what I had ordered.

I ordered a very simple breakfast: two eggs, over medium, potatoes, and sourdough toast.  They keep a great deal of toast on-hand when they get busy, and the potatoes were also already made, which I know because I had ample time to watch the process.  All anyone had to do was fry up two eggs, and yet I got wheat toast and barely cooked eggs; I would hesitate to even call them over easy since the whites weren't done.  I would have said something further, but at this stage, I had waited an hour for a simple breakfast and really just wanted to get out of there.

There are a number of better places in the area these days, and given the prices, I don't see how you can justify waiting an hour or more for mediocre food that doesn't even match what's ordered.  I paid nearly $14 for my meal, and I would have had a much better experience going across the street to Trader Joe's and cooking it myself.  Do yourself a favor and either only go at odd hours or don't go at all.",6bxaJdPq0Brj6uDKKktCmw,0,0,2,UfgSF-mjZCUEOqRpMHeb3A

The interior was clean and had a lot of the traditional welcoming breakfast place type feel.  The service was excellent.  A coffee cup never went empty and the waitress took a lot of special requests.

I would say the breakfast food here is good, but does not separate itself in any way shape or form from what you could get at any other breakfast place in the valley.  Sometimes there is something to be said for simplicity and I can respect that.  I'm not asking that the menu become some fusion high end kitchen.  The chicken friend steak was not very crisp, which for me is the make or break point for a chicken fried steak.  The gravy was good, but lacked that extra bit of flavor to set it apart.

All that being said, this is a great place to go if you want a simple, traditional breakfast place.  This place is great for the traditional east coast tastebuds and preferences.",rvVoA0LRk78csKFPxMHUNQ,1,0,3,xfWpDbUVvh5ts425-y5kIQ

Coffee cake didn't arrive until after our breakfast came and then server only brought us one then after he realized it brought another one. After that we didn't see the server for at least 1/2 hour.  Both of our breakfast were bland and after I salted was still bland. Hash browns were burnt to a crisp. So much so that you could pick up a piece of it and it was like a wafer.

We woke up, knowing we would pick him up at noon and thought - goddamn it, I deserve a good breakfast after all this! And the Cracked Egg is that kind of place. This is food and service that could mend you, body and soul...

I ordered their croissant sandwich and my date ordered an omelette with bacon, cheese, and avocado (the serving of avocado was very generous - for those wondering). We both opted for hash browns. The hash browns here are WAY better fare than you would get elsewhere, although they are greasy to a fault. Still, it's like IHOP hash browns on steroids. These hash browns would make IHOP hash browns pee their pants in fear. It reminded me of something my grandma from Oklahoma would pull out in the morning, made in a skillet - low on presentation, high on deliciousness and love.

The wait was manageable if you're an early riser, service was extremely prompt. We received several offers of more coffee, water, milk etc, were asked if everything was good, from many different waiters and our main waiter was smiling, happy, and clearly a kind guy.

We went on a Tuesday at 11 and, as you might imagine, it wasn't too busy. Service was fast our server was very nice and informative. However the reason I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5 is because she was the only one who seemed like she wanted to be there. The host was on her phone more than she was helping guests or doing side work. The guy who, at first, I thought was a manager was sitting in a booth my entire meal talking to friends or family and also on his phone.

I had the Veggie Skillet with toast and their coffee cake. First off, a big wow on that coffee cake-light and sweet and not heavy at all.  Veggie skillet was packed with all of the ingredients- mushroom, peppers, tomatoes, spinach and potatoes. Veggies were almost perfectly cooked, maybe first few bites of the spinach was not cooked enough, but overall it was very enjoyable and filling. The potatoes were spot on.

My S/O and I arrived around 11:30 and waited only about 15 minutes. Our waitress came by shortly and were handed a menu. There are no pictures just words on a double sided laminated paper. I ended up ordering the Eggs Benedict Olé thay came with hashbrowns while my S/O ordered a giant omelet that came with potatoes and coffee cake.

The portions were huge and the food delish! I love perfect eggs (lol) and this place sure satisfied by liking. My S/O finished his omelet but passed on the potatoes. The coffee cake you may ask? It was so so soooo good.

I have never tried coffee cake before but it was great! It didn't taste like coffee (so not sure where the name comes from) and was filled with custard! My S/O isn't a fan of custard so I happily scooped the plate clean. 

So why 4 stars? Well, after ordering our food and watching people that came after us receive their food, we were starting to wonder if they forgot about us.

The staff was friendly enough, nothing to exceed customer service standards, but met my expectations.(keep in mind I've been the Gm at a national chain restaurant for 10 years). The server greeted us after being seated for 4 minutes. We gave our beverage and food order. Two coffees, 2waters, chille Verde rancheros/seasoned potatoes, big bad wolf omelette w/hashbrowns & SD toast. Drinks came quickly. Coffee tasted like coffee, after all its not a ""coffee shop"". Server came by the table 3 times to warm up our coffee before we received our food. Our order took 22 minutes to reach our table. Acceptable, considering the restaurant volume and the fact that we had ordered""specialty items"", as opposed to eggs & toast. My chille  Verde rancheros was AMAZING! The pork was tender and juicy, the sauce had excellent flavor. I will be returning for this dish. My husband was hesitant about the omelette due to yelpers reviews. He went for it.

Very similar to The Egg & I down to the seasoned potatoes and hustle & bustle. The noise level is very loud, it's what you'd expect of the breakfast/brunch crowd. So if you're looking for a nice quiet breakfast this place isn't for you. In case the line to be seated is longer than expected, look for the tiny bench midway between the restaurant along the kitchen. If it's a particularly chilly morning, try to grab a seat there while you wait. It'll give you time to check out the daily specials menu board. 

Many options on the menu. The Californian with egg whites always hits the spot. I'd pass on the coffee cake though, it's more like a square piece of cake with frosting drizzled over the top. Sadly, it didn't taste like coffee cake at all, boo. Good prices but the service can be hit or miss.

Today, I got there at 1:30. It was very cold in there as if they turned off the heat and when my wife, daughter and I got our coffee, it was cold. The waitress oppologized and explained that since they close at 2:pm, they shut the coffee machine down for cleaning and closing at 1:00 and put coffee in carafs. She threw it in the microwave for us to heat it up, but honestly, it made it slightly bitter. With as good as the food is (it's excellant, BTW), they must get a lot of business during the morning, so it's hard for me to believe that the owner can't afford to leave the heater and the coffee pot on until 2:00!
A secondary and mostly unimportant complaint is that I got only coffee and my wife and daughter got coffee, and both got the cracked croissant breakfast and shared a peice of the coffee cake (I highly recommend the cake). The total bill was $35 plus tip minus $8 coupon. So still basically $35 for two breakfasts out the door. That's pretty pricey. We still come because we can't resist the food or the coupon!

Rolled up here on Saturday around 11:30am.  25 minute wait!  Luckily, it was an absolutely beautiful day and we had no problem waiting outside. :)

When we were sat, we were greeted immediately by a guy taking our drink orders.  There were four of us and he promptly brought us our drinks (water, coffee and orange juice).

We ordered:
*Bacon & Eggs- scrambled eggs, a couple slices of bacon, seasoned potatoes and toast or coffee cake. ($8.25)
-Three out of the four of us ordered this dish.  The eggs were nice and fluffy!  You get I think three pieces of bacon.  I'm more of a crispy bacon kind-of-person and these were a little ""rare"" for me, but my husband liked them!  The portion is HUGE!  In fact, I ate most of the eggs, two tiny pieces of the seasoned potatoes (which covered half of the plate), one piece of bacon and I was stuffed!

*Build your own skillet: eggs, cheese & sausage ($9.25) and it comes with seasoned potatoes and toast or coffee cake.
-My husband enjoyed his skillet, which again was a huge portion.  He LOVED the coffee cake which had caramel in it with a thin drizzle of icing on the top.  I wish I had room to try it- it looked yummy!

I would definitely come back here.  I would love to try some of their ""funky"" dishes, if I had someone, err two other people, to share it with!

My friend had the peanut butter stuffed French toast which wasn't so good. Too much peanut butter, it stuck to the roof of my mouth. The coffee was weak like they are trying to save money on coffee grounds. Don't waste your money on coffee here! 
       Their coffee cake that comes with some of their breakfast entrees left something to be desired. It tasted ok but was too dry. I liked the chocolate chips in them though but still too dry for me. Hey chef - add some sour cream to the batter. It would help with the texture!
        My BF had the Joe's scramble with hash browns. The scramble was really good but the hash browns were ok.

I got Tori's tortilla with turkey sausage subbed for the chorizo. I got the coffee cake which was good..I was expecting something denser but it was super light-textured. Another  yelper suspected a cake mix but I bake a lot and it seemed house-made legit. My husband got French toast and eggs...I had a bite of his French toast and it was good. My burrito was excellent...packed with veggies and scrambled eggs and cheese...I was super happy they have green Tabasco too. 

Second visit was with my mom on a weekday morning. We were seated quickly and were soon drinking coffee. We both ordered a special - sweet potato skillet with cranberry sausage and eggs. We also got coffee cake. Like the first time it was super fluffy and had a good flavor but I'll just get toast next time and save some calories for eggs and cheese ;)

Skillets were good...I would have preferred more veggies and fewer sweet potatoes but I am a big veggie fan so take that Into account. I would have also liked something more acidic thrown into the mix so I ended up asking for my fave green tabasco again. 

Service was good, nice variety and good quality of ingredients. Next time I plan to try lunch.  They offer coupons every month on their website but make sure you check that out before you go as they need to be printed.",45mRoEbA_IvHIyUHpiABBw,0,0,4,A0CeELX3HI9Ol9PJ-lr9eg

After checking my Yelp! bookmarks - I was happy to be reminded of the newer Centennial location of the Cracked Egg as we'd been going to the original Cheyenne location on and off for about 8 years now.

This location is a lot less crowded with a shorter wait time and a much larger seating area - all decorated in a traditional country-kitsch motif.  I liked the fact that they have enough room to set the tables further apart here, it makes the space feels much more open and airy.  I'm a big fan of the Cracked Egg's Veggie Benny and it was equally as great here.  Two English muffins topped with spinach, poached eggs and hollandaise please - diet be damned!  I prefer my breakfast with hash browns rather than fried potatoes and they do a good job here - taking the time to let the outside get all nice and crispy while the inside remains soft and buttery (if there's one thing that makes me sad, it's undercooked hash browns).  The service was friendly, welcoming and efficient.

2356919,2012-05-06,0,HFEkIohUqGIudgqbHiK1uA,"OK I like the place too.  But let's not go crazy.  

The eggs are fresh, but they also seem to shy away from actually seasoning anything.  My egg sandwich (i forget their cute name for it) was good.  Bigger than it needed to be and served on a croissant.  They really should grill that croissant a little so it doesn't get so soggy.  The seasoned potatoes are good, but could be hotter in my opinion.

The biggest problem with this place is the service.  After waiting for your table you are greeted by a server who seems entirely overburdened.  There is certainly no passion and for me that kind of ruins things for me.  After I wait 30 minutes for a table, I am excited to sit down and eat.  Having the serve kill that excitement is just disappointing.  Also, this is not the cleanest place I have eaten.  the booths are dirty and the place seems a little dingy.  The toilet was broken... but no one from the restaurant knew... nor when I told them.. did anyone care.  That's sort of how I feel.

I ordered The Greek omelet. It was a three egg omelet with spinach, tomatoes and Feta cheese. The edge of the eggs were a bit crisp but the ratio of vegetables to Feta cheese was perfect. The portion size was appropriate for the size and sent me home with leftovers.

The layout of the restaurant is a bit weird. I like sitting in the section off to the side rather than where the door is. The front section is a bit cavernous and feels ""warehousey"" I am aware this is not a word, but it seems like the best description. Despite that, I am willing to tolerate it cause the food is good.

I think my favorite dish here is the Chicken Fried Steak. Smothered in country gravy and served with your choice of  eggs, potatoes and toast. The steak is nicely breaded, superbly crispy and mouthwateringly yummy. I like to step it up a notch and sub the toast for biscuits with even more gravy. And of course I like scrambled eggs (when I like eggs) and the seasoned potatoes. My second ""usual"" is the Monte Cristo. 

You know the saying, ""stick to what you're used to."" I should have heeded that one morning. I tried their raspberry french toast. Eww. Not happy. Not sweet. So unappetizing to me that I barely made it through one slice. Their presentation is a bit lacking but really what can I say. As far as local breakfast places go, I'm usually not in it for the presentation. Heck, most of the time I'm not even awake enough to appreciate it.

The portions are pretty generous and the service is quick and friendly. My bf likes it, I like it. The hot chocolate is good. All in all, a win win place for me.",zc1tkew_l8-INmYk7TAPmg,1,1,4,nZmgUaxxzKXp1cuMxZmA0A

I guess its an okay location, but it looks like a place would be fitting for retail stores like Radio Shack or GNC. Doesn't really fit very well, but it is a nice place. 

Inside was a bit decent, a bit roomy and seems clean. When we did get to our booth, we did find it odd that one side is roomy then the other side of the booth. 

The staff seem kind of nice. The one who sat us down in our booth, didn't seem to happy. But the waitress that took our order was upbeat. The busser on the other hand, had issues. I'm sure there are a softer way to put dishes in a bucket, instead of making clanging sounds, to the point where it irritates our ears and makes us twitch every time he drops a plate in the bucket. So that was kind of annoying, either he doesn't know how to be gentle with dishes, or he's not really happy that he has to make the dishes clang and make us twitch. Uncool, unprofessional, and uncalled for. 

The only thing that's making this okay, is the food, the nice setting and the waitress being nice. Otherwise I would of probably experience better if the staff look like they didn't want to work. 

The food on the other hand, I really enjoyed. Had the steak and eggs and cooked to my satisfaction. So I give the cooks a very good recognition as well. 

I guess, if you don't mind some of the staff being unhappy and there for the food. Then I would recommend it. Otherwise, I would try something else, if you want to be in a more upbeat kind of place that won't make you feel uncomfortable.",VsL7I-dRjo4eToDC7Un_3Q,0,0,3,C3miQGSRcZ4enNsWzz-dOw

This cafe is on the busy side, and seats fill up quickly. Seating is somewhat limited within the front of the restaurant. I wound up sitting at the bar area where servers tend to leave silverware & napkins to be rolled next to my plate. Not cool. They apparently didn't get the hint after I pushed the silverware container away, remaining oblivious as to the reason why I moved it.

Check out needs to move faster. Only one cash register, and the line can get long to the point where your butt is in someone's face due to where they are sitting. That's no exaggeration.

The place is small so it gets loud here very quickly as it starts to fill up. There is no outside seating either so that does not help with how loud and how packed it gets. There is no waiting area really, there is about 2 or 3 chairs if those are taken then you can go outside and sit at one of the 3 picnic tables if those are not full otherwise you stand around outside or sit in your car.

This time I got the build your own skillet with hot links, chorizo, bell peppers and spinach. The problem with was that the chorizo was dryer that sand at a beach the potatoes that come with it was not seasoned at all they tasted really bland (like I put them in a skillet waited to they were cooked and then started to eat them right away) then there was literally like 3 leafs of spinach in the whole thing, had me upset.

Then there is the coffee cake that's suppose to be on point, ummm no it is not. It tasted like white cake with some melted chocolate chips and some time of cream cheese glaze (what you would find on a cinnamon roll) it's served nice and hot but that's just trickery to make you think that you are getting a fresh slice but in reality they stuck it in the microwave before they bring it to you. Oh and the orange juice is the same price as a gallon in the store which I normally wouldn't have a problem with but the fact that it is such a small glass is where I run into the issue for that items.

The best part of the whole experience there was the waitress that waited on us. She prompt with everything and extremely nice as well. Also the food and drinks amen out quickly as well.

3413945,2014-08-03,1,HFEkIohUqGIudgqbHiK1uA,"This review is kind a tale of two aspects of the restaurant.  Let's start with the positive - the food (which is what you come here for in the first place).  And it was awesome.  Our group had the breakfast croissant sandwich (with scrambled eggs and ham), the eggs benedict and a short stack of pancakes. Everything was great.  The sandwich had perfectly prepared eggs with melty cheese and flavorful ham.  The croissant was huge and delicious.  Just the right amount of flakiness. The short stack of pancakes were perfectly done and delicious.  As for the benedict, it was awesome.  The hollandaise sauce was excellent, the eggs were perfect.  Just delicious.  With the exception of the short stack, the dishes came with excellent seasoned potatoes.  Easily five-star food and one of the top two breakfast meals we've had since moving here last year. 

Now the negative - the service.  Our waitress was really clueless, while drinks were served promptly, after our order was taken the waitress disappeared for like 10 minutes and then came back to tell us she forgot to put the order in.  We got a half-hearted apology, but clearly it amused her too because she giggled throughout.  So she walks over to the machine and starts typing in the order, then has to flee back because she can't read what she wrote down for one of the order.  Our food did come out fairly quickly after that, but she dropped the plates off in a hurry and wandered off before I could even tell her that we had no silver ware. So we had to wait for her to wander back to get that.  I realize that everyone has bad days and mistakes happen, but the sheer volume of screw ups here was unacceptable.  One-star (at best) for the service.  

Given that great food and abominable service, I'm going to split the difference and give Cracked Egg 3 stars.  I'm sure we will be back at some point, because the food was great, but the service was certainly concerning.",76xS0Vin4uT25XKaxbsvmQ,2,1,3,QL3xxCfiIM-pxrl1CHeDWg

For starters we waited at our table for a good 5-7 minutes. I get it, it's Saturday morning and it's busy. We already knew what we wanted but she took our drink orders and left. Now worries we could order when she returns. Having worked at a breakfast joint before (the Egg and I) I get my favorite corned beef hash. My husband orders the burrito enchilada style but the waitress insisted that torri's tortilla was better and she would just get his enchilada sauce on the side for him. Our food came in a decent amount of time.
But, well I've Never been to a breakfast restaurant where they do not serve hollandaise sauce with corned beef hash. And my husband saw they had a pork green chili sauce and wasn't too fond of the enchilada sauce.
Well......we waited and waited literally 10 minutes for our waitress to finish taking orders for the other table (she's quite friendly and a chatter box) and asked if mine comes with hollandaise and she said she could get some for me and I asked her for some pork green chili sauce and she said sure. Couple minutes later she comes back and the green chili is literally diced green chili. At this point our food has gone cold and I was busy eating my side of hash browns that I was filling up. When I took a bite of my corned beef hash, it tasted like just hash browns. I removed my egg and I was surprised that there were a few strips of corned beef. The rest was hasbrowns and bell peppers. $12.25! Really? Our meal came to &45 for party of 3 where 1 was a kids meal. And when asked how was everything and I replied not too good. They said oh.

As far as the hash browns, I won't be getting them again. The seasoned potatoes that my boyfriend got were delightful and I tried not to eat them all. I will definitely be getting them in the future!

I've known the Cracked Egg was there, but I was sticking to what I knew. Alternatives in the area include the stellar fine dining of IHOP or Mimi's Cafe. I'm pretty sure those two places also serve as alternatives for nursing home field trips on the weekends. 

We actually tried the Cracked Egg on the recommendation of a friend, which is funny since we don't actually have any friends. That is how good it is. 

I like the portions and the food is much higher quality than IHOP. You can literally taste chicken suffering in IHOP's eggs, so the eggs with slightly fewer injected hormones are refreshing and appreciated by both my digestive system and my delicate pallet. The food has been good every time I've visited the Cracked Egg. 

They also have a rewards card you can get and add to your ridiculous reward card collection, and they will send you a pretty good $8 coupon each month. It actually turns out cheaper than another breakfast place even without the coupon. And I enjoy it more, so it's a win either way. Except for my digestive system because it doesn't know me and it doesn't understand my life.

I gave 4 stars instead of 5 only because their service is sometimes on the ""ignoring you"" level of bad. I expect a minimum of mediocre service every time because I am such a demanding customer and stuff.",mtpQBE8yTL8oTo0KrJcd9A,5,5,4,1kmlFCT_SXrjp-lAMVzYlQ

4014543,2013-08-15,0,HFEkIohUqGIudgqbHiK1uA,"The wifey and I love getting breakfast on Sunday morning.  I don't know, something about it seems envigorating, like getting ready for the next week.

We in Las Vegas have no shortage of breakfast places to indulge at to carry on our day.  The Cracked Egg is located right off of Ann Road, right across the street from the nearby Yogurtland and Walgreens.  Real close to the Centennial area.

The Cracked Egg has been voted best of Las Vegas on three different years.  So yes, especially on a weekend the restaurant is bustling with patrons needing their morning cup of joe.  The kitchen is hopping, and the smell of bacon and eggs can be quite intoxicating to the senses.  

The menu at The Cracked Egg is quite diverse, covering a whole realm of breakfast and lunch staples.  Lots of egg dishes (yeah you bodybuiding protein lovers), and lots of fresh ingredients.  You have scrambled egg dishes like the 'North Shore Scramble' which comes with bacon, tomatoes, onions, jack & cheddar cheese, and sour cream.  You have your Eggs Benedict plates, a common staple in most breakfast eateries.  There's breakfast choices like French Toast and pancakes on the ready.  You have your skillets like 'The Chili Skillet' which comes with chili, onions, and cheese.  Seems their big seller is omelettes which they call 'Fluffy & Folded', they crank a lot of these out of the kitchen.  That day we tried 'The Greek' which came with spinach, tomatoes, and feta cheese.  Most dishes come with either seasoned potatoes or hash browns (which I love well done), and your choice of toast or coffee cake.

In summary, the food is OK.  I mean the omelette was good, the hash browns were good, and the coffee cake was pretty darn tasty.  But I dunno, I just don't see paying around $9 for this.  In fact, a lot of the dishes just seemed a tad overpriced.  Call it the economy, call it inflation, it just seems damn expensive!  Maybe it's because I can see myself at home making a similar dish without much fuss.  I do like how the food looks mostly fresh, and appreciate the cooks since making an egg right is one of the hardest things to do.  

The service was great, our waiter kept our coffee cups full and our water glasses topped off.  Even on this busy day, which in itself is a feat.  Nice guy, lots of energy, and good with holding multiple plates of food.  A necessary skill!

The Cracked Egg is also open for lunch, and that menu looked pretty good.  There's sandwiches like 'The Club' with turkey, ham, bacon, swiss, avocado, mayo, lettuce, and tomato on wheat.  Or salads like 'The Cobb' with chicken, bacon, ham, cheese, bleu cheese, avocado, hard boiled egg, tomatoes, and croutons.  I love me a club sandwich so this I may have to try if I ever go back.  They also have burgers too.  Same thing though, almost $10 for a lunch item is a bit high in my book for what you are getting.

They also have a new gluten free menu for those of you with this sensitivity.  That alone takes a lot of breakfast places out of the running, and having an entire menu for folks with gluten sensitivity probably helps ramp up business a bit. 

I like The Cracked Egg but it's not one of the places I think of first when I want a hearty breakfast at a tiny price.  This place borders more on the gourmet side.  I'm happy as a clam with two scoops of hot rice, two eggs over easy, and two slices of SPAM!  So what do I know??",QCtHk02W_Asu2LFfdmGQDA,2,1,3,DoZhD53FANl1Tekd7_d_8g

Breakfast at Broken Yolk is as good as it gets, but expensive, crazy busy and with long waits.  I expected the same here, but got the opposite. Wasn't busy for breakfast and food is decently priced.  However, another opposite is that the food was just okay, not great.  I expected Broken Yolk type servings and taste, but got more of IHOP/Denny's taste.  I'm not saying the food was horrible, it was just okay.  

I had the Cheeseburger Meat Lover's Skillet.  Satisfying, but wasn't too far off from Denny's version.  Portion wasn't that big either, but not complaining about it since it wasn't over-priced. 

Service was just average as well.  Seated right away, but it took a little time for our orders to get taken.  Remember, it wasn't busy.  Also a little disappointed that my water wasn't filled until after I was done eating.

 I had the coffee cake again and though it is pretty good it's not good enough to have to throw the rest of the meal away.  I had the omelet with all the meats thrown in because it sounded awesome.  Good in theory with poor execution.  Instead of fluffy folded eggs it was basically cracked eggs with meat loaded into in and all scrambled up in a round shape.  You'd think it wouldn't matter but it was burnt and tasted just awful.

My boyfriend ordered orange juice, bacon and eggs that came with coffee cake and hashed browns.  (You can also get toast or potatoes if you don't want coffee cake or hashed browns.)  I ordered a greek omelette with the same sides as my boyfriend and requested egg whites only.  I expected the waitress to give me a hard time about egg whites or tell me it'd be an extra charge but she did not!  Other places I have been to usually have at least charged me extra.  The waitress quickly brought me a coffee, my boyfriend his juice and also two piping hot coffee cakes.  I couldn't believe how delicious the coffee cake was!  It had an angel-food-cake texture with chocolate chips and cinnamon crumbles.  I was in heaven and weirdly had never had coffee cake before with coffee.

I visited the location near Centennial Center but our waiter told us there was a total of 4 locations in Las Vegas and 1 in Henderson.  

Positives
1) Menu was fantastic and had plenty of options to choose from.  Whether you want a basic breakfasts of eggs and meat with a side of hash-browns and toast or classic breakfast scrambles, omelettes, & skillets you are covered.  Don't miss out on the variations of French toast and pancakes either and of course you can also get eggs Benedict.
2) Service was exceptional!  Very friendly staff, greeted immediately upon entering and seated quickly.  Had my first cup of coffee as soon as we sat down and my cup was never empty.
3) Restaurant ambience was nice and comfortable!

Things to Know
1) This location was very intimate and seating inside the restaurant was limited so know if you pick a busy time the wait can be fairly lengthy.  They offer some outside seating as well.  Came back for a second visit around 10:00am on a Sunday and were told the wait was 45-60 minutes.  The food is definitely worth the wait but consider coming earlier; my first visit was around 7:30am and the place was busy but we sat immediately.
2) Parking at this location is limited mainly due to the size of the complex the restaurant is in.",bK83JqfkLOOayKXjoaR62A,0,0,4,0umhtnn9THxW-nJgi8XjYA

But dang it, they're so good! They deserve all the Yelp Love. 

This is the perfect spot to bring friends, family, a date, or to go by yourself to recover from a wild Vegas night. It's so cozy. The staff is super down to earth and professional. Not perfect but eager to be which is great. Their menu items vary from standard to unique - giving all the picky eaters something to choose from. I looove their Benedict's. My husband loves their omelets. And if they offer coffee cake - GET IT - bc ugh I dream about that fresh light fluffy amazing piece of heaven on a dish. It's so good, I momentarily lose my manners and (look what's over there?) fork up the last bite before my husband can claim it. 

My only minor discomfort is that the wait can get long so we get in, get fed, and quickly pay up and leave so someone else can get seated. Hardly anything to cry about though.

4482818,2017-12-18,0,HFEkIohUqGIudgqbHiK1uA,"I was going to leave one star but i like the food. 

Went in this morning and it was busy as it is on a Sunday, went at 10:15 to start waiting for my family's 10:30 meet up time. Was told about 40 min. My husband was meeting us and he had to leave by 11:20 for work. We had 6 people in our group. 
  
 They started to seat tables fairly quickly so I went inside and asked how much longer and he said less than 40 minutes now because they're seating people so fast. I watch them seat three people at a table that could easily have fit 6. A few times they did this. Instead of just sitting in order you should look at the larger groups and make sure they're seated so they're not waiting over 45 minutes before being sat while EVERYONE else gets sat. I looked at the list several times and they skipped over us and kept seating people.
   
Eventually my husband just had to leave because he wasn't going to have time to eat (it was 10:54 and we hadn't been sat yet-I put my name in at 10:15) so we reduced our party to 5 people and I made sure we were sat the next tabIe. Ridiculous. I understand you're slammed on a Sunday morning but when you see that you have a table of six people and you just continue to sit 2 and 3 people at large tables that could accommodate a party of 6 it doesn't make much sense. The turnover for tables that can accommodate 2, 3 or 4 people(which was pretty much every group) was opening every 10 min or so. 

So seat the large party of six first and then you can easily seat those other people quickly. It seemed like younger people running the front area who probably don't realize to do this and who don't care. We then waited 20 min or more for our food and watched everyone around us who sat after us getting their food first. 

Not going to come back here this is the second bad experience with this location. Last time we we're completely ignored by our waitress she only came to take our order and give us our check. She helped every other table around us but ours for some reason she literally forgot about us and other people had to bring our food out and check on our drinks etc. we've been to this location many many many times, that will be the last time.",ONmrBUu1qhSiXwrVkqj8Rg,0,0,2,dvqFGRDT1FKsSWDG9mslIA

The egg of the omelette was dead dry, and the vegetables inside were sad and did not really came out with good flavors. I added chalula, salt, pepper, catsup, perhaps some tabasco, still was not a good omelette. My crispy potatoes were crispy, a little on the burned side.

Been a couple of times and definitely is my spot for a friendly brunch. The servers we've gotten the 3 times so far have been nice and kept up on our drinks throughout...nothing makes me more upset than having a mouthful of syrupy delight and zero to wash it down. I had full drink the whole time. Was busy but we got a table right away twice and once just a simple 5 minute wait while a table cleared. We go closer to when they close so we probably scrap by rush. 

Now onto foods-

1st time
Benedict Ole- YUMMY! Diced chicken and green chiles were a nice twist to this benedict and went really well all together. Probably my favorite non sweet dish so far.

Peanut Butter Stuffed French Toast- Really nice, served with bananas. Only downfall was it was very rich, but since my BF and I share dishes it broke up the richness so that we can enjoy more than a few bites. 

2nd time
Joes Scramble- beef, cream cheese, spinach, scallions, cheddar and jack cheese . Good and big portions, again I got a side of their potatoes included and I like em. Nicely fluffy eggs, not overcooked.

Daily Special on the whiteboard- Special K covered french toast with fresh fruit. This was yummy! I love cereal and french toast (I do Captain Crunch at home but rarely make- messy). This wasnt overwhelmingly sweet or rich than our last french toast, just right.

3rd time
Montecristo- Turkey, Ham, cheese sandwich battered and fried. One of my guilty pleasure foods-  and they do it right here.  I guess everything is better deepfried like a twinkie, but here it was not soggy and served right away.
Waffle with fruit- yummy and simple comfort. 

UPDATE- 6/12/10 Got the Joe's Scramble (ground beef, spinach, cream cheese, melted cheese) this was simple and good, but not a favorite. Croissant French Toast- this was yummy, eggy, and buttery. It came with a nice spread of bananas, blueberries, blackberries, strawberries that were all very fresh. 

Overall has been pleasing service and food so will come whenever we actually wake up early enough to have brunch on weekends. This is definitely a favorite breakfast spot....Yummy and I'm not that big on breakfast really.

UPDATE 10/24/10

Got the Ole Benedict. Still yummies. Still my favorite. Service is consistently very good and friendly. Quality breakfast is a real treat when you're a night person and today we woke up early enough to come before they close.",n86B7IkbU20AkxlFX_5aew,3,2,5,vsFKue2orK5OutKVOUxhdQ

Their breakfast is good (I've converted many visitors to coffee cake lovers) but don't overlook their lunch selections.  Actually, a wild idea, you can eat your lunch for breakfast!

They have some really great-tasting soups.  They do seem to change daily so don't be afraid to ask, it never seems to be written on their whiteboard.  In the past, they've had split pea, clam chowder and chicken tortilla.  

My favorite is their burgers.  They are very fresh tasting/looking.  These are burgers that I crave!  They are always cooked perfectly (medium for me, well-done for the hubby) and always taste so good!  They are large in size and well worth the money ($6.95 - 8.25).  We like the basics so we stick to cheeseburgers and they are always good.  Although, when it is a special, I love their mushroom burger.  I've yet to try their Kobe burger ($11.95) but I will add it to my must try list from this place.

Think of the coffee cake as more of a sugary pastry. The coffee cake has chunks of Oreo in the loaf and is topped with a sweet icing. It's served warm and in a generous portion size. 4/5 

HAM & EGGS ($7.99): My mom got hers with seasoned potatoes and over easy eggs. This a hearty breakfast for sure! She was very content with her breakfast meal. 4/5

CAKES & EGGS COMBO ($8.99): Two pancakes, two eggs, and two sausage or bacon. My dad was a fan of this combo! I stole some of his pancakes and they were moist, thick, and fluffy (basically everything you would want in a pancake). 4/5

CHICKEN SANDWICH ($9.99): My husband decided to be the odd ball and opted for lunch instead. He chose the seasoned potatoes as well - these tasted like french fries and were more lunch-y than breakfast-y. He said the sandwich was good and cleared his entire plate. 4/5

SERVICE: Our waitress was pleasant, accommodating, and stayed on top of things. Kudos to her for handling our party of 6 so well (two kiddos were in tow). 

The Cracked Egg is a solid spot for breakfast. It's even better when there's no wait!

Service was lacking and while they were busy, I made eye contact with our waiter several times while he stood around chatting with the other staff. We received only one drink refill (which was long before our food arrived) and had to wait at least 15 minutes after finishing for our check.

I had the ""country benny"" (biscuts and gravy with a poached egg) which was bland and tasteless. Making matters worse was the fact that it must have sat out for a long time while my wife's food was prepared - cold and the breakfast potatoes (uninspired but decent enough) were soggy.

I am not the type to send food back, but I would have had our waiter bothered to stop by.

I was impressed that the front staff seemed to actually care when I responded honestly to the standard, ""How was it?"" during checkout. They offered to get the manager and I'm sure would have made it right, but I had already decided not to return.

For Denny's it would be acceptable, but for nearly $15 a plate and an hour wait? I think not.",929r8bJ3dzW_d3jpwUxYVw,1,0,2,k4mlrbl07i5KHt9d564pCA
5399077,2010-11-26,0,HFEkIohUqGIudgqbHiK1uA,"I have had mixed opinions on this restaurant for a number of reasons. 

The good: 
The country fried steak and eggs are delicious! The portion is huge and the piece of country fried steak keeps it's crunchy composure when covered in the gravy. 

Omelets- I haven't eaten a bad omelet here. The options are endless and all get served with nice fluffy eggs and those scrumptious fried potatoes! 

The service- Is always top notch. Drinks are always refilled and you never have to wait 30 minutes for a check. 

The not-so-good: 
Eggs Benedict- I once ordered this entree and the piece of ham had a huge piece of cartilage in it. It spanned across half of the piece of ham. It was so unappetizing that it took me almost 6 months to return here to eat. 

The long wait time- If you are unfortunate enough to get here after 9am on a weekend or on a holiday, be prepared to wait. I have waited in excess of 30 minutes for a table of 2. I attribute the long wait to the lack of non-IHOP breakfast joints in the Centennial Hills area. We need an omelet house over here!",erJ1HQwavgZx4996SMIxrA,2,2,3,3tjBMDkKKLY_El0uhP4Pnw

Yeah, there is a reason they don't have their prices online. It was around 10 dollars for their 'stuffed' french toast. Let me tell you what stuffed means to them. It means two slices of toast with some kind of cream cheese filling spread in them. And where does the raspberry come from? The five raspberries they throw on top of it. But I could look past this, I guess, as their way of making stuffed french toast. I surely don't expect something like Ihop, since this is suppose to be 'home cooked meals'. But when your stuffing is so miniscule it's like you spread a small amount of butter on toast, it is very disappointing.
Then came the omelet with the hash browns. It wasn't great. Not bad. But not medium either. The potatoes were ok, then again you shouldn't be able to mess that up, but the omelet was just....eh, I guess is the only reaction I had to it.

Hash browns were a bit under-seasoned an limp, so ask for extra crispy if that's your thing, and go with some salt. Pumpkin coffee cake was good, even if the rumors are true that it's from a box. It was gooey and moist and delicious. Coffee is decent too, though not super strong. Service was very quick, once we were actually seated. (see below)

Major downside...we came on a Saturday morning when there was obviously a crowd waiting, which was fine. We were told the wait was about 30 minutes, which was fine. We went outside because it was a bit crowded inside. After about 15-20 minutes, we got a little chilly and came inside. We were told there were some benches around the corner from the hostess table, so we went and sat down. Another 30 minutes later, I decided to check I see how far we were on the list, since we had been there for close to an hour at that point. The hostess showed me her wait list, which revealed that our name had been crossed off long ago and that at least half a dozen people had been seater after we should have been. When I pointed to my name, the hostess said ""Oh, well I called your name."" All I could say was that we had been right outside and then inside on the benches around the corner. She did seat us pretty much immediately at that point, but did t seem the slightest bit apologetic that we had been skipped. 

Overall, good experience. Just maybe don't go during peak hours to make sure you don't slip through the wait list cracks.",jAfNCily5aWlTobQyhwRjg,0,0,4,x9K1NV-V4XluJwR9V70C7g

After a wonderful rest at a buddy's home... My brother and i were starving. Granted my brother has to work, i'm here in vegas to rest before tax season madness begins. Regaining my vigor after my health setbacks.

I dont know if its my looks that made the people be rude... Ah what the hecks...

Decor:
It is nice.

Service: 
I like to do live yelp tips/updates because at that initial moment, the experience is pure. Over time, human nature allows exceptions and logical reasons why people act the way they do. I dont know the waitresses name so i just snapped a pic of her (upload later but its in the tip section). She was extremely rude, rough, and rigid at first. This already ruined our experience!!!! 

My brother is like Maila. Both of them will privately air grievances and just relents with the shittyness that is unjustly placed before the... Good for them i will publicly air my grievances. And if i dont directly say anything to them + remain quiet... I am done, best to remain silent. Done deal. Will never return. So why two stars? 

I dont know what happened. My bro thinks my live tip was read. The waitress showed another side with amazing service but my mouth was already ruined and im extra assholey when ravished. Jesus is merciful, i am not jesus. A rebellious sinner at its almost finest. And the coffee cake was superb. Bomb diggity. If the service started out prestine along with coffee cake this would be five stars.

Food.
Commercialized. The egg white veggie ommie with green chilies was good yet not great. 

Brother hates toasted toast and wants it lightly toasted. More so warm soft bread. They burnt the bread and he was peefed. Why not ask for another? Cause the the waitress was a complete bitch and we wanted out at this point. Waitress decided to become nice after we began eating.

Hash browns were undercooked. Whatever. I shouldnt be eating this much starch anyways.

For this joint's sake, i hope our experience was an isolated one. Considering all the eateries for us Non-Vegasians to consider, i will not be returning ever again.",cTA0xNt7i6bTAR8geI8m_w,11,12,2,wnOmzcd8W5Aj01GfmXEWPQ

Went on 9-13-15 around 12:30 PM for brunch.  

The wait was pretty long...which wouldn't have been so bad but the foyer of the restaurant is like 5 square feet so most people had to wait outside or huddle together. I was getting sweaty and hangry by the time we got a table.  

Once we were seated it got so uncomfortably hot in there...I saw one poor woman asking for more napkins to wipe the sweat off her forehead.  The backs of my knees were dripping sweat down the booth.

Otherwise? Well.... it was fine until the last few times.

My family and I love it's convenient location and, due to the coffee cake, we frequent there at random intervals. Sometimes my husband and the kids and I, sometimes just my sister and I when she's in town.

However, any time they sit us in the back, the service goes DOWNHILL, VERY fast. I recommend you insist on sitting in the front in order to get decent service.

On top of that, something was particularly odd yesterday and I doubt we will be going back after this incident. Now, my sister and I ARE large women. So booth, though we CAN handle it, isnt exactly the most comfortable. Most times they ask us and we take whatever we can get because usually the place is so packed and we want in bad enough that we take booth or table, whichever comes first. However, yesterday, the place was relatively empty, but instead of asking, the guy who seated us just shoved us into a booth in the back, while several tables were open in the front. I guess we werent pretty enough to sit in the front?

Let me explain how us in a booth works. I sit in the corner (being the smaller of the two), then the booth table has to be angled, pinning me in, so that she can fit to sit.

A table was sat down about two or three minutes later. Our waitress tended to them first. I guess she didnt see us. She then rushed over to take our order. I requested coffee. She says ""yeah, but what food do you want?"", rushing us through making a food order. So... we did. We hurried up and ordered food.

So... she brings coffee and cocoa for myself and my sister... then the coffee cake a few minutes later. After a time, they then bring our breakfast.

I take two bites of my breakfast potatoes and then she's already bringing us the check! It took longer for her to bring us coffee cake than it did for her to bring us the check after bringing us food. Truly... I had a pair of sunny side up eggs that hadnt even had the yolks broken yet when she's pushing the check on us already. I turn it away and carry on my breakfast. Several minutes later, she comes BACK with the check! I again turn it away. By this time, I notice that the man who seated us is talking to the waitress who tends the front, and they are pointing at us and talking in great length about us (It's OBVIOUSLY about us). He then proceeds to sit at the end of the counter (we were in the corner of the back where we could be seen from the front if you were at the counter) and ate a meal... staring at us the whole time. It was SUPER awkward. When the waitress pushed the ticket on us the third time, I got the message and left over half my meal there, taking the hint and getting the hell out of there.

I'm not sure why they wanted us out so bad, but fair enough... we wont be returning. Too bad. The coffee cake is REALLY good.",LtdPQ-KS-eUoTDgCsjikyA,0,0,2,FszxiQsmHjC_tNVDcjfH5w

The place was packed.  Recovering from a bachelor's party from the night before (don't let your mind wander - it was playing Super Mario Bros. in Mount Charleston until our eyes bled), we needed a place to sober up, but we only had an hour before we had to head off to work.

When we walked in, we told our hostess this time constraint.

Her reply?  ""Oh, that shouldn't be a problem.""

So what our hostess didn't tell us, after seating 4 additional smaller parties, that there was a boisterous wedding brunch on the other side of the restaurant and that our table would be greeted after the (one of two) servers was finished taking their order.

So they failed to communicate, but we'll have to deal.  After all, we had heard the place was remarkable.

After 23 minutes without a ""Hello,"" and a waiter serving all four of those parties sat after us, the five of us started to get up - it's not a dine and ditch if you don't receive anything.  Only then did a waiter (casually chatting with a cook) dashed madly to our table looking suddenly concerned.

We rattled our requests off, and 40 minutes later we got our food.  I do remember the food being above par (after all, we had heard the place was remarkable), but the service left such a bad taste in our mouth, I will not step foot in the location again.

The wait was over 30 minutes.  We weren't told that the counter was first come, first serve however. I guess not too bad for mid-Saturday morning.  The waitress was extremely rushed.  I asked if the corned beef hash was chunks or minced.  She said small pieces that are minced.  I watched the cook divide a plate of eggs into 2....not what I want to see.  The corned beef was strips.  I tried to eat it anyway but it tasted watered down...no flavor.  

Very loud, small environment.  Not what I was looking for at all.  Much better breakfast options in town.",9Ms5wpxVloadWFvDbb77kg,4,4,1,eBXQvV_DEEk9qPHvmJ6ECw

The decor is so warm and welcoming, and the service is always good. Breakfast food is usually breakfast food, but I actually CRAVE this place, its so good! They have a big menu too, so there's always an opportunity to try (and love) something new every time you come. I've been to two of their other locations and it's consistently good with great service at each one. Don't go to ihop, go to cracked egg instead!",g_AhgIEyx7J3NVsOPoalhA,0,0,5,JhEdusky04DYjLYgWLlhtg
5900462,2018-04-10,0,HFEkIohUqGIudgqbHiK1uA,"We love the Cracked Egg for breakfast / lunch! Usually a wait no matter when we visit but never to long and they have a great rewards system which mails us coupons.

We sometimes get breakfast but we love their burgers. My wife thinks it's the best burger and it is her must when she wants a burger. She made me try it many months ago and now I end up ordering it too when we go.

Compared to the other breakfast options in the NW, we think the Cracked Egg is the best!",gPnezUoB9AcxE_qeBR_Dsw,0,0,5,VAP1VHITIsEmSRjPFyQQOQ

They use frozen diced potatoes and smothered in gravy means a very small dab, if you want more it will cost you. Waitress never even asked if we wanted more coffee. The only good thing was the coffee cake. Find somewhere else, this place is not worth the hype",vgjLo3iUrG4Y-JG5Of_6lw,0,0,1,lddM45W7YnVFr7qNxJkWrA
5907573,2016-11-12,0,HFEkIohUqGIudgqbHiK1uA,Just moved to the north west and came to try the cracked egg with my family it was an awesome breakfast experience. Great kids menu.

I do wish that they had a decent waiting area though. The patio would be perfect if there was shade or heat, depending on the season.",lNzLRJ4qaJtJBRATrhI0ig,0,0,5,1GMBy-33ecVazami_8IMpg

Breakfast AND Lunch! The reason I go back, is the service. It's the same employees time after time with wonderful service. They remember you, sometimes your order. They don't rush you on busy days. The food is always out in no time at all! 

Order the kicking potatoes with 2 scrambled eggs on top and a side of salsa and sour cream. You won't regret it.",mD2upXCA_ViF88pNgodIAQ,0,0,5,upVyuieoz5EmGzEBlDuqRw
