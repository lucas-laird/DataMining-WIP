The sea bass ceviche was a bit spicy for one of our guests but I enjoyed it and there was no fishy taste at all. 3/5

The saltado de pollo (chicken with veggies and rice) was okay. I'm not sure if it is supposed to be served on top of fries or that is an American addition. The fries get soggy from the sauce so it's best to eat those soon. 3/5

The chicken dish above was served with spaghetti and I mentioned it was supposed to be served with rice. The waitress attempted to argue with me until I pointed at the menu specifying white rice not pasta. I'm not sure whose mistake it was but I merely pointed at the item instead of attempting to pronounce it. 

We also ordered the Alfajores (corn starch dessert) which were tasty and hard to stop eating. 4/5

I think it's worth a try and would probably go back for more.",RU5fBHNbpqs4CjJiQt7PiA,1,0,3,WudOOc73nwnioJiG6Xftfg

I caught this place on a drive by and saw a plate of Lomo Saltado on the window so I stopped in...I haven't had a plate of it in years, and it's one of my favorite South American dishes...it was FANTASTIC.  I didn't have the appetite to try anything else, but I'd go back for the Saltado anytime.  The green salsas (forget the name) are perfectly fiery and great.  They even serve the toasted corn kernels making it all very authentic. A bit on the pricey side is my only complaint.",Pdkr6ajlAYWApTOXbni2hw,0,0,5,9E47g-TIF0RFEL5K-T4sDw

445439,2013-09-29,0,zt9RLUIU32fZYOBh2L0NNQ,"A couple friends and I decided on this place as a last minute change of plans. They had been there before but I was a ""noob"" to the restaurant as well as Peruvian food in general.

The restaurant atmosphere is somewhat inviting, lightly dimmed, warm colors with murals on the wall. There were about 4 or 5 other people dining so it wasn't really busy. We were seated promptly and after the waitress took our drink orders, we all decided on 3 orders of Lomo Saltado and an appetizer order of the Papa Rellena.

The first thing to come out was supposed to be the Papa Rellena, but that wasn't what showed up on our table... instead it was an order of Papa a la Huancaina. Now, normally I would complain about the waitress getting it wrong, but after being corrected, she apologized quickly and got us the right appetizer while comping the incorrect one. So one star for fixing that mistake with urgency and sincerity.

Here's the odd part... my friend clearly said THREE orders of the Lomo Saltado. During our appetizer round, one order of Lomo Saltado came out. It was weird that the waitress brought out just one but we figured ours would come shortly following that. After finishing both appetizers, there was still only one order of Lomo Saltado on the table. When we asked her about the other orders, she emphatically stated, ""No you only ordered ONE Lomo Saltado."" Ok, if we're asking about the other two, how can you emphasize one?! As bewilderment and frustration slowly showed on our faces, the waitress apologized and put in the other two orders.

I will say this... although the service was not up to par, the food was delicious. The Papa Rellena was some kind of beef stuffed potato loaded with savory spices. Mix that with salsa on the side... perfection! Even our free appetizer was delicious, potatoes in a cream sauce that left a little spicy zing aftertaste. I enjoyed the Lomo Saltado as well. Imagine a saute of red onions, steak and tomatoes in a soy sauce/cilantro sauce with french fries at the bottom.. DELISH! Served with a side a rice, this meal was complete! 

Now this is my first time trying Peruvian food and I could be wrong about how good it was, but I know my taste buds always do a good job of not lying to me. Now if only the service would improve, I'd be a die hard fan. Right now, this place will have to settle for 3 stars.",53hTHxGUy7AC8Oz7BE7-3g,1,0,3,lT9NcS3Btio0_9QyHJTaFg

The pictures of their food are quite enticing, so I thought I would try again a few months later.  As we walked in, the first thing that hit us was the blaring hip-hop music from a radio station  with weak reception, mostly all static.  We were greeted and sat with menus but no drink orders.  We waited another 10 minutes before we had our drink order taken.  Waited another 15 minutes before our lunch order was taken.  Their specialty is a Peruvian spiced chicken, but were told the chicken might not be ready yet. After checking, it was ready.  My girlfriend ordered the chicken, which came out almost immediately.  I never saw my dish.  When asked if my dish was coming, we were told her chicken was done, so it was brought out first.  After waiting another 15 minutes of waiting for my dish (Remember, this is my lunch break), they took her dish to put in the oven to keep it warm (we wondered if they took the salad off the plate first).  another 10 minutes passed and after wondering where our server and food were, we left a $5.00 on the table for the drinks and left.",nrtJfnL_JjgFvJ_X9uBheQ,0,0,1,HrhOqtLFI7ejYhksObF4zg

I've been to Peru over 30 times and I've been to all the Peruvian restaurants in NJ, NY, etc...even the ones in Miami, Chicago, and Long Beach. Inka Grill is the best place in the US, period!!! The ingredients are top notch, the food is always fresh, and the flavor is 100% authentic. They have items that hardly any other Peruvian restaurant in the US can make properly. 

As an appetizer, you can't go wrong with the Chicharron de Calamari o Yuca a la Huancaina. For a drink, you have to try the Pisco Sour. It is much, much better than the ones you get at Sushi Samba or Tanta (even better than all the Lettuce Entertainment places like Nacional 27 in Chicago). As for food, wow!!!! I've been here at least 10 times and the ceviche is amazing and served authentically, the lomo saltado is so flavorful and perfect, the tallarin verde is always juicy, flavorful, and reminds me of how my mom used to make it. 

As for dessert, you have to try the picarones!!!! No restaurant in the US can make them perfectly but Inka Grill can!!! Also, try the lucuma ice cream. Lucuma is a fruit that only grows in Peru and has a unique/distinct flavor. Not many restaurants serve these wonderful and unique treats!!!!

2046551,2016-07-04,0,zt9RLUIU32fZYOBh2L0NNQ,"We were feeling adventurous and decided to try Inka Grill. I'm vegetarian so I was skeptical as to what Peruvian food I could eat. We ordered the Passion Fruit drink and the purple corn drink (the exact name escapes me). Both were delicious!  For an appetizer we couldn't decide between the boiled potato or the yucca. They were kind enough to give us a little of each. We had never had yucca and were pleasantly surprised. I had the linguine with pesto sauce and it was more tasty than the one I had at an Italian place last week. My hubby had a grilled chicken breast dish with rice and veggies. I can vouch for the rice and veggies being tasty. He said the chicken had good flavor.  We would come back here...although I will need to be in the mood for pasta, since that's the basic nod to vegetarian entrees.

2263328,2012-06-11,0,zt9RLUIU32fZYOBh2L0NNQ,"The Inka Grill replaced Little Dumpling a few months ago, and is more of a disappointment than an improvement. The chef/owners of Little Dumpling were very flexible in creating tasty vegetarian renditions of nearly any Peruvian or Peruvian-Chinese (Chaufa) dish on the menu. On my only visit to Inka Grill, the waitress simply pointed out the very limited vegetarian options on the menu. This may have been because there was no cook in the kitchen and she was getting nervous about the possibility of having to prepare our meal herself, but I will get back to that in a minute.

I settled on the fried yuca a la Huancaina (as a vegetarian, I was left with two options: yuca or potato?) and my husband ordered the ceviche de pescado. We also ordered a pitcher of chicha morada. We were served a carafe, containing just enough for one glass each. I've never seen that before. The flavorful Huancaina sauce was great, but the yuquitas had bit of an off-flavor, possibly from the frying oil. My husband's fish ceviche was good, but he prefers the ceviche at Mi Peru. The waitress returned to the table and seemed relieved that we were pleased with our food. ""The chef was late, so I started cooking until he arrived. I just thought, ceviche, it can't be that hard!"" I laughed at her honesty, but found this horrifying and unprofessional (if the cook abandons the kitchen, close the restaurant!), and we opted to skip on entrees. I would have tried the picarones from the dessert menu, but they were not available. Typical.

Other changes that have been made under the new ownership include dimmer lighting, fancier (smaller) dinner plates, MORE flat screen TVs lighting up the walls, white table cloths covered with paper, irritating top 40 radio station, and higher menu prices. They really haven't fixed the place up that nicely; I can still see the very casual, best for takeout place that it used to be as the Little Dumpling. It's still not the kind of place you would take someone on a date, though I feel like they want it to be. I can name a Peruvian restaurant that underwent a similiar ""transformation"": Che Inka Chicken/Grill recently went out of business. Even though the food was not bad, the experience can't be awarded more than 2 very disappointed stars.",PSI7wvuqEhhV9Jh_fP2eZQ,3,1,2,lg-OTccEW-a7sUG0390BTw

I ordered the 1/4 chicken plate that came with fries and a salad. I actually asked for rice instead of the fries but I guess the chef forgot. My waitress gave me a side of rice for no extra charge :)

Ceviche: I think there were TOO many onions but definitely an appetizer to order. Large portion and the flavor is good if you like lime! 

Lomo saltado: Marinated strips of beef stir fried with tomatoes, onions and FRIES and served wit rice. Very good! My friend thought it was salty, but I didn't think so.

My brother had the Lomo Saltado and I had the Milanesa de Pollo (always my favorite). Both dishes were flavored amazingly. They came with salad (with the best dressing). Loved the sauces (the green is my favorite). It was great to have a Pisco Sour too. Since then, we have returned with different friends and family and the food is always excellent and reasonably priced.

Out came the yuca, a small portion considering the price, but ok. Still no pisco sour...when we asked the waitress, she said the gentleman that makes them had stepped out, but we would get our drink as soon as he came back. 25 minutes passed by before one of the ceviches came, then 5 minutes later the chicken. When the second ceviche was brought out 10 minutes AFTER the chicken (I still don't understand why both ceviches weren't served at the same time), the waitress suggested we get something other than the pisco sour.  When asked what happened, she just stayed quiet. We ordered 2 beers.  

The portions were adequate, nothing spectacular or to rave about. The portions of the fish pieces for the ceviche were a bit large. Chicken was good, not overcooked, seasoning was alright. Again nothing worth coming back for.
Our waitress checked with us one time to see how everything was, the next time she came by was with the bill. What a surprise! There was the pisco sour in all it's glory being charged on our bill.  When asked why it had not been removed, she stated that the 2 beers would not be charged, however the 2 beers at $3.50 each should have been $7, not $8. When this was pointed out, her reply was, ""oh, yes, he'll give you back a dollar, when you pay"".  Really? We asked if the manager was available and was told he only comes in for dinner time.  We texted him a message to the number under the cash register, still have not received a reply.

If the manager can't trust his staff to make adjustments or corrections on the bills, then he should have an assistant manager during the hours he's not there.  Terrible service, definitely not worth going there.  Much better Peruvian food elsewhere in the valley.

Oh, and BTW. The cashier didn't give us the $1 after all.",wNgs6nQlKdieo4rbKcw8gA,7,0,1,Oa6JUkISWW4GrCiKRy35tQ

I ordered tiradito, a ceviche-like dish. It need salt, but was the best thing I had. I also tasted the yucca in huancaina sauce. The sauce tasted like it came out of a can or packet. Not only have I had better huancaina sauce at other Peruvian Las Vegas restaurants, I can make better huancaina sauce at home, and I'm not even Peruvian. 

The service was also terrible. When we were paying for the meal, our empty appetizer plates still hadn't been cleared from the table. The service was slow, which is surprising since we were the only people there. Our waitress was on the phone taking an order when she brought out our food. She's also the person who made our drinks, which were not good and overpriced.

If you want good Peruvian food, go to Mi Peru on Horizon Ridge. It's not as good as Peruvian food you'd get in Miami, L.A., but it's the best you're going to get in Vegas. At least you won't want to ask for your money back like at Inka Grill.",c2wGkrX311rMD9vUH23FvQ,3,0,2,as1lQ3nlFHoGGgMZANsH6A

3577096,2014-06-01,0,zt9RLUIU32fZYOBh2L0NNQ,"I went here with my girlfriend a few days ago. The location is nearby our house, easy to get to and find parking and all that.  The place has a number of booths that are not very comfortable (think hard plastic from fast food restaurants) -- it would probably seat about 10 groups of 4 people.  It was not very busy and there was only one server/cashier on duty.  

My girlfriend ordered ceviche and purple corn juice for a drink and I ordered one of the combos that had sausage, pork, chicken breast, and a chicken skewer with french fries. I noted that towards the back of the menu they had some Peruvian/Chinese dishes, weird.

The ceviche arrived in a reasonable amount of time but it took over 15 minutes from the time the ceviche arrived to when my food was served.  I hate this at restaurants.  Don't stick a plate of food in front of someone when the other person has nothing to eat.  

The purple corn juice had an intriguing flavor.  I didn't like it or dislike it really.  My girlfriend said the ceviche was amazing.  The pork I had was oddly spiced but I'd eat it again, the chicken was really good, but oddly the ""sausage"" was literally just a hot dog.  I'm used to sausage being a hot dog in Japanese, but in Peruvian?  Whatever.  The fries were good.  At the end of the meal we were served fortune cookies.  I guess more of that Chinese/Peruvian influence.

Anyway, I really disliked the service and how long it took to get my food, especially considering that it was not busy.  Some of the food was really good and some was not so good.  The price was fine.  I doubt I will ever go by myself again, but with other people then sure.",ykWNHp1RXcmx6PYH921UrQ,0,0,3,pSWjzHN4wBHT7CSbmYTYaA

I had the 1/2 roasted chicken and the taste was AMAZING.  We also had a beef saltalldo and it was just as AMAZING as everything else.
