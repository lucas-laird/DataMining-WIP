The sliders are pretty good and we were pleasantly surprised to see they had a veggie burger too.",0FLitOamJs4GV0Tcw5AHOg,0,0,4,NngTlgrmByz0BSM7pf1ZiA

It's Friday night and that's what I do, and I was just trying to get home in time for dateline . Anyways , I start gambling get a drink or 2 before ordering to find out , this pts (trop and 95) doesn't have the glorious pts food and they rented out their kitchen to quickee burger . Whatever . Feed me . 

So I order a brown bag special ( 3 or 4? Sliders and fries . And mozzarella sticks . I was buzzed and any food would be good . But now I'm at home drunk and this shit is sad. The fries are burnt . No seasoning . SALT nothing . Sliders  flavorless DRY as ballllllls . . Mozz sticks u can't fuck up and still not special . So basically I spent 12 dollars to eat crap as dry and cardboard tasting like the Vegas desert . It's like eating dry toast off a cactus .

A McDonald's mcgangbang ( put a double cheeseburger inside a hot n spicy .... Trust me) for 3 bucks would have been a better investment . 


The staff was nice tho . But sorry your food sucks . This is why I need to stick to tall cans and my own food",S4WlTQXloBXwnl0SWDdnbg,1,0,1,cNY9nKx5iczqbEoJEyr4-A

I understand it if you are a little short staffed, but let me know within 5 minutes of taking my order. I placed the order because I was hungry. 30 minutes after the order was canceled, you are still showing as available for delivery on the Eat24 app. Get it together.",FW-U6120E6pV0QMpmkFjZA,0,0,1,_BbCr6L_sb-UUXSi9zYiOQ
4946873,2016-08-06,0,hgwkI7cx-ki7cWOSzzyTLw,"Had a Groupon for what looked like a Fast Food Restaurant. Instead my GPS takes me to PT's bar. We walk in anyway and there's nothing resembling a restaurant side. The bar tender sees us but doesn't say anything.  
We just ended up leaving and getting a credit back from Groupon. 

Not sure what was going on there. This Groupon is false advertising when they don't tell you it's in a bar.",P4CFpSV_ZJui9jZXSVND0w,0,0,1,e84rgLoGhnowOpN6cTZ_oQ
