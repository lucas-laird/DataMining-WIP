A friendly hostess seated us immediately, and a waiter was at our table to take our drink orders in a moment. The restaurant ambiance was a welcomed escape from the usual Fremont Street chaos... until the live entertainment passed out tambourines to a table full of kids... and encouraged them to make as much noise as possible throughout her Beatles tributes. Then for a moment it was Karaoke hour as she passed the mic over to a customer who wanted to belt out ""Sweet Caroline"" (and suddenly we wanted the tambourines back). 

On to the food! Warm, soft bread was served promptly (though the olive oil and balsamic were a little behind). We ordered the meatballs in marinara sauce and the Luna Rossa pizza. Both were pretty good, but honestly nothing to write home about. 

The service is what redeemed my experience at Luna Rossa. Our waiter was very attentive, quick and polite and we were welcomed and thanked by the hostess. The ambiance would have won me over as a fan if the tambourines were torched and mic reserved for the paid professionals.",D1y2N4GekReGtJUyHfBy1Q,0,1,3,5XX3U8DAtg44V9UVMCi1RQ
138295,2012-06-23,0,FvC3W9E6rXUYx-cTxbnUiA,"Seems like a very random location for this restaurant, but I'm not complaining! Bf & I wandered in while we were exploring Fremont street and shared a Casertana Pizza (buffalo mozerella and basil) and Crostini della Tradizione. It was more than enough food for lunch, and our bill was around $20.  The pizza was a bit soggy but still very good. Not too heavy on the sauce which, in my opinion, is perfect. The crostini was one of the best things I tasted my whole 6 days in Vegas. Simple but SO good - I'd go back just for that.  

We did feel a little out of place as everyone else in the restaurant (4 or 5 other tables) were speaking Italian.  A group of 4 were seated RIGHT next to us, while most of the restaurant remained empty, and they proceeded to give us semi dirty looks throughout our stay. It was awkward. 

All the staff spoke Italian too, which was pretty cool.  Our waitress was fairly attentive and we didn't have to wait long for our food. You can eat outside, or inside if you want to pretend you're somewhere other than Fremont Street.",inho5MbDJc6A3HCwRgd8-g,0,0,4,XapbKFIJlIHpPDXVAeh7Lg

I have never been to the original location but had a TERRIBLE experience today at the Downtown/Fremont Street location. I went with two other people and we ordered the meatball sandwich, filet mignon sandwich and lasagna.  Lasagna and meatball sandwich were both cold and flavorless.  Am assuming that this was previously frozen and microwaved before it was served to us.  Also, the water glasses and silverware were very dirty. We were very shocked when we received our bill... All items that were ordered were supposed to be part of the lunch menu and were supposed to include drinks.  We were charged $3.75 each for our sodas and by that point we all just wanted out of the restaurant. It was really expensive for a previously frozen, microwaved lunch.

One, I love the name. ""Red Moon"" is something that catches my attention right off the bat. They have a little bar at the front and the dining area is pretty big, but not too big. You need a code to get into the restrooms, which I find very safe. Downtown folks and bathrooms can get a little crazy sometimes, so I appreciate the thought from the owner(s). 

As for the food, quite delicious. We had their Capri salad, lasagna, Margarita pizza, and just a simple sausage and pepperoni pizza. All that was perfect for four of us. The Margarita pizza was my favorite. The lasagna was pretty darn good too, but I have had better. 

The only thing that was not perfect, though he was very very nice, was the inattentiveness of the waiter. It took him awhile to realize we needed more drinks and to come check in on us.

The whole downtown experience was quite new to me as I'm usually a stay-on-the-strip kind of guy. However, this area is quite interesting and a lot more popular than I thought. Needless to say, things are more affordable around here. 

As for this Italian restaurant, it's a pretty good size restaurant. I came here during lunch and had a pleasant experience. Don't expect a quiet romantic setting as this restaurant is on the busiest street downtown, but that goes without saying. It's more of an upbeat, festive environment. The food was a pleasant surprise, I had the Seafood Risotto and the NY Steak. For dessert I had the Tiramisu and the Creme Brulee. I really recommend the Tiramisu, it was delicious.

Well with a first impression like that you would expect this place to be more casual...nope they are trying hard to be upscale...trying was the key word here :-/ At first I walked away because the ""singer"" was super loud on the key board. I get they want live entertainment but I would much prefer something on the softer side than that noise. My hunger for pizza got the better of my judgment. 

The food was pretty decent....I had better pizza but what really threw me off was when I ordered their artichoke, prosciutto, mushroom and olive pizza I didn't expect it to be all segregated...I like my topping to co-mingle with each other :-) What I did love was their bruschetta toast topped with mozzarella, prosciutto and sage butter :-) That was pretty awesome!

A co-worker and I went for lunch as its next to the new Denny's on Fremont Street and wanted to try somewhere new. We ordered the calamari and caprese salad for the appettizers. The calamari was good but, the sauce could have used some ""umf"" to it. The caprese was really good. I would have liked a little balsamic for it but, I just added some salt. I ordered the spaghetti ai pomodorini. My only request was no tomatoes (not fond of cooked ones) and to use angel hair instead. What I got was angel hair in butter. No flavor what so ever. There was hardly any basil or garlic. 
So basically, we had an expensive work lunch ($50 for both of us) and it had no taste. Now I'm not a cheapskate but, I want what I pay for.

When we first got there, they tried to seat us inside, but we were having none of it.  There was a guy playing the guitar and singing into a microphone, so it was LOUD and it was BAD.  So we decided to save our eardrums from the terrible music and sit outside :)

They had a limited late-night menu, but there was still a good variety of dishes on it.  I had the broccoli alfredo, and that was really good.  It really hit the spot.  I liked my friend's bruchetta, too.  It was very fresh.

So I docked one star for the annoying music (it's Vegas, surely you can find someone better!) and one star for the service.  Our waiter was friendly enough, but it took close to 45 minutes!

In Vegas you're eating at the best restaurants in the country and dropping $$$$$, or you're at a buffet.  Luna Rossa is one of the few middle ground restaurants.

4451898,2012-11-17,0,FvC3W9E6rXUYx-cTxbnUiA,"I will start off with what is good about Luna Rossa, since this is an update, I have been here on 3 occasions, all with different outcomes. The first time here I ate at the bar and it was a good experience. The second time, I ordered pizza from the take out window. While a bit pricey - still good. Lastly, I came here for dinner with friends on a Thursday night. Now, not my number one choice to dine on Fremont Street, but I relented to my friends who wanted to go.

First of all this is what Luna Rossa is - an Italian restaurant serving mainly pizza (out of a window, no less), that is attempting (and failing) to be an ""upscale"" (HAR HAR) restaurant on Fremont Street. Their menu reflects this, especially the dinner menu. Not one item on their dinner menu is under $10. I'm no cheapskate, but the menu itself falls incredibly flat. Appetizers that they didn't have. Pizzas that with so many toppings the thin crust becomes soggy in the middle (yeck!), and overpriced entrees!  I am not paying over $10 for spaghetti and meatballs unless I am sitting in a nicer looking dining room in a place where people aren't zip lining outside, okay? AND people better be dressed nicer, because obvi this place doesn't have a dress code.

The place itself looks like an eatery - not a fine dining establishment. There is PAPER on the tables for God's sake. My friends and I had the following -

Salmon Dinner Entree - One friend didn't want pizza so she got the salmon, said it was pretty good. BUT because me and my other friend ordered pizza - she did not get any complimentary bread. Yes, Luna Rossa will refuse you bread service if someone in your party orders pizza. RI-DIC-U-LOUS. It says so right in their menu.

Artichokes, Olives, Proscuitto, Peppers Pizza - I don't remember the real name, but I remember what was on it, because  with all of those toppings the thin crust became soggy very quickly. It was like eating moosh pizza in the middle especially.

Here's the kicker - Luna Rossa charges you an 18% gratuity - NO MATTER WHAT. You had bad service? Too bad, you've already been charged. There's only three of you eating? Too bad, you've already been charged.

What is this shady business? (OK - they have it printed in the menu, but that doesn't make it any less BS.) Even if our service had been outstanding, which it wasn't, it was just basically good service - I wouldn't have tipped MORE after the restaurant has the audacity to force a required tip on me. I think they're probably doing it because of their location. Perhaps they have a lot of tourists who don't bother tipping? I don't know, I don't care. But I do know one thing - I will not be back here, and I will certainly tell my other local friends who hang out downtown to steer clear of this place as well.",hZfzVrhsCQ9JDAb2jYoJNQ,3,0,1,cGryQPh_noi89hED8EwtvQ

It's not the best Italian food in the world, nor did I expect that from a small, tourist-friendly walk-in establishment on Fremont Street.  But it puts out respectable food at decent prices with better-than-average service.  

My wife and I found this place based on a recommendation from a Tix-4-Tonight worker at the 4Q.  For $2, we bought a voucher that gave us half off a second entree.  Why not, right?  We tried Luna Rossa, liked it, and have gone back a half-dozen times in the past year or so.  

After a few hours on Fremont, I'm never really in the kind of shape to give a review worthy of submission to Food & Wine magazine.  What I can report is that having grown up on Italian food in northern N.J., I can safely recommend the risotto, carbonara, bolognese, and rigatoni al funghi.  

One weird thing I ran into:

I bought a large beer at the ABC store on Fremont.  I then walked down to Luna Rossa to have dinner.  They told me I had to finish it before I could come in.  Fine, whatever.  Then, I noticed that other people were bringing in their drinks (the football beers, the oversized fruity drinks, etc. sold on Fremont).  I asked the waitress why my low-rent beer was being discriminated against.  She told me that they allowed drinks purchased on Fremont into the restaurant (the touristy-type drinks) but not cans and bottles.  Personally, I prefer policies that make sense.   

Again - don't forget to buy the voucher and save some $$.
