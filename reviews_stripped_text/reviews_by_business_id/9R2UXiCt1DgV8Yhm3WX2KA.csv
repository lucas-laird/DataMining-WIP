She forgot to give me my drink and when I asked her for it she tried to give me the size below what I ordered. When I asked for the right size she practically insisted I take the smaller one.

Best part was when I got back and ate my food and realized that my fries were cooked in the same fryer the do the fish in. Pretty sure those are supposed to be separate.

Anyways, I ordered 2 McDoubles ($1 each), 2 Hot N' Spicy ($1 each), 2 Bottle Water ($1 each), and 2 Apple Pies (2 for $1), and a Large Iced Tea ($1 each no matter of the size or type of drink). My total was $9.50.

Picture the scene... It's 11am and you just come from a nice hotel to walk into this famous authentic (one of the first) McDonalds of it's kind... it still has the original cool trash cans and signage from a bygone era, complete with vintage Chevvy out front. 

Sound good so far right?

Now as you are about to walk in, you notice a load of homeless people's suitcases at the front door... ok no problem, this is Vegas after all...

First person you see: A huge transvestite black guy, making lot's of strange sounds with shredded paper all over the booth, it was pretty scary.

Next booth: 3 homeless guys making a lot of noise and arguing about unimportant random things... the floor is covered in white chalk frothier shoes and the table covered in litter.

At the checkout the staff are very unusual too... I couldn't figure out if the person serving me was male or female??? Next checkout had a really old lady with a deep husky voice shouting something at someone in the back... 

Enter more homeless people! As I looked around, I noticed that actually, over 1/2 of the customers were either homeless people or possibly homeless (hookers/drug addicts?) just hanging out in McDonalds all day!

Even the bathroom had homeless people inside washing...

Now, I've got nothing against this at all, but I'm not sure that McDonalds is the place for this type of a hang out. It really did put me off going in there again.

Overall the service was average... I noticed the drive through was backed up over 10-15 cars though at least, so maybe the management need's to change and a security guard put on duty in order to reduce this sort of thing going on? 

If it were me, I would allow homeless people inside of course! But just not let them sit around all day filling up the available seats and also make sure that they act appropriately.",SzYNtW7FMSrKSDxXzGXtvQ,0,0,2,k70xSH35h2vAUaR0nyQ18w

It is not a bad system at least I know my food will be properly made. There is staff available on the off chance that one needs help. I ended up ordering just a single hamburger and it hit the spot.

Sat for a good long time this morning at about 7:30 waiting to order a McMuffin meal with a large coke. 
They offer two drive thru lanes however both I and the other car waited what felt like forever until the other car backed out of the drive thru. I finally placed my order and proceeded to pay. 
The person never greeted me but told me my total. 

As I was leaving I noticed my coke had maybe 3-4 Ice cubes in it and was flat and lacking carbonation. I mean come on McDonalds is known for how delicious their cokes are. 
My food was also cold. 
I tried to call the number on my receipt but the phone just rang and rang. I filled out the survey on my receipt this time because this is ridiculous. They charge more than other locations because they are so close to the strip and provide horrible service and serve flat sofas and cold food.

For instance, the daughter was hungry and I was in a rush to get ready for an event and this McDonald's was across from SLS, which at the day of our visit to McDonald's was not open yet and therefore did not have functional restaurants yet. We went through the drive thru and it was easy and manageable.

This is a typical McDonald's with nothing to make them more memorable than other locations (in a good or bad way). But if you are staying in the vicinity and in need of fast food, do try them. Their drive thru is also open 24 hours so they are very convenient if you need calories late at night (which happens a lot in Las Vegas, go figure!).

I have pretty low expectations when it comes to McDonald's to begin with, but this has got to be one of the most poorly run locations I have ever been to. I am staying at a hotel nearby and have been over to get a quick breakfast and coffee the last few days. Both experiences have been frustrating to say the least. 

My first experience involved a 15 min wait for a couple of coffees and breakfast sandwiches... Which wouldn't have been so bad if it wasn't 7:30am and empty...what the heck took so long?!? The employee dishing out the food apologized for the wait and asked if I would like a complimentary pie for the inconvenience. I said yes and asked for an apple pie. When I got back to my room, I had discovered she put 4 pies in my bag, all cherry. I had to laugh. 

This morning we returned again for a quick to go breakfast. After a 20+ min wait, the order was initially incomplete... Good thing we checked the bag before we left. They then stuffed the missing sandwiches in the bag and sent is on our way without so much as an apology... When we got back to the hotel we discovered that one of the sandwiches was wrong and they had prepared the coffee incorrectly.
