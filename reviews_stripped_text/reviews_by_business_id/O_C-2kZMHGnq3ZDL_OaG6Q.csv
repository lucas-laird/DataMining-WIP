Lunch. Unplanned. Desperate for food before noon and wanting something other than Italian or new American. Default to Morel's since we were staying at the Palazzo.  A steakhouse, a French steakhouse. No expectations and not wanting steak.   Could be a disastrous choice. But French star chef cannot be too bad a choice.  Bouchon made us beleivers in French with American sensibilities. Not seeking an experience, just lunch.   
She had the Slow Roasted Turkey Club and I was torn between 2 choices: Seafood Fettucini(me not wanting Italian but a sucker for anything seafood) or the Pork and Veal Meatloof. Our waiter said the Meatloaf for sure.  Done.   A paired glass of red, chosen by our server again.   A sandwich is a sandwich. But this one was memorable in its taste, freshness and the play of ingredients. The bread, Campagne , sliced thin was just the right handle and carb. Meatloaf is meatloaf.  Ground meat. Simple.  Well Morel's creation was a revelation. Texture, taste, finess of flavours accompanied by silky Youkon Gold Potato Puree aka mashers.   Wow.  If you do ketchup with meatloaf this one doesnot need any condiments to make it sing.

How the simple, unassuming plates are done speaks volumes of the chef's ability. Nothing overdone. Just ordinary crafted into extraordinary.

Trusting our server  who could have suggested the higher priced Fettucini and any possible higher priced glass of wine, gives me confidence in a 2nd visit.

Unplanned, no expectations often rewards with a new discovery that must be renewed on another visit.",_HzMxiXDcKvy9-FiEuxJ_w,0,1,4,Ip4EBjt5ectIO85mEz0R1w

The tuna was bland and not quite fresh. Just average. The oysters we had though were fresh and tasty.

All 4 of us ordered ribeye steaks. When steaks arrived, the other 3 were definitely ribeyes. But mine absolutely looked like a New York steak. I asked the busboy who brought my dish if mine was indeed a ribeye. He said yes. I ate a few bites in and knew it was not a ribeye. Our waiter walked by several times without asking how our steaks were but noticed him looking at my steak but no mentioning anything. I finally flagged him down and said this is definitely not a ribeye. He said ok an brought it back to kitchen. Then few minutes later manager came to me and said they are making me new piece of meat. I asked if indeed mine was not ribeye but manager said he didn't know but that my new steak would be out soon. 
All I wanted was acknowledgement that they screwed up and apology. Did not ever get it. Even when waiter came by with new steak I asked him if my old meat was New York steak and he said when it comes to mess ups , he just mentions it to his manager and let's him handle the kitchen and he also said he just washes his hands when it comes to the mess ups. Ridiculous that not one person took accountability and apologized for error. All they said was my new steak would be out soon. Wow. That was total turnoff. Especially when we are staying at the Venetian hotel , it was not representing the experience of the hotel. Bad bad bad. Spending almost $500 for the four of us but getting a poor problem resolution experience. Just apologize, people!

It is romantic, but it took FOREVER to get a RAW steak. We had to wait 15 minutes just for 2 for drinks! Medium Rare does not mean raw. We should have sent this back but were in a hurry to get to a show. No wonder there was no wait at 9pm on a Saturday night. There's just way to many places to go that are better quality. They did a fun table-side salad presentation. That was probably the highlight of the meal sadly. Go to Cut instead. It's only a few steps away. This place needs some work.

At check in, we received a 20% off coupon, so why not??  We noticed the Happy Hour was about to begin...double score!!  

We were told that happy hour is either on the sweltering hot deck overlooking the strip or at the bar.  We opted for the empty bar to partake of the 2 for 1 drinks.  The menu offered one selection of whiskey, vodka, gin, etc.  My BF wanted whiskey on the rocks, she informed us they had no whiskey!!!???  WHAT??  OK...no problem, he's flexible and had the gin instead.  I'm sure VEGAS runs out of alcohol all the time...!!

We ordered Kobi beef sandwich and fish and chips (off regular lunch menu, not happy Hour selection).  We LOVED it and ate every last bit.  Just as we were enjoying that feeling of finishing a delicious meal and sipping on that last little bit of drink, the waitress's Tourettes Syndrome rears its ugly head...""OMG, I've never seen 2 people finish and order of fries before.  You guys ate everything on your plate.  I've never seen that in my 6 months of working here!!:""  By now, the bar area is a bit fuller and people are starting to look over at us!  We are not overweight or overly sensitive people so, we laughed it off and joked back, but I was like WTH is wrong with this lady???

I guess maybe there was a stray dog tied up outback that was supposed to get our scraps because I have never seen someone get so excited and shocked over an empty plate before

If you want to eat in the restaurant, I suggest wearing your thickest skin, eating only half your meal, or doing take out...",ZK8bzqtf2aBb47b15Zva6g,0,0,3,N_8gD8bEMitlQY9Pd5GSVA

I had reservations for 9pm on a Friday.  Although my husband and I were a bit early, we didn't get seated until 9:20.  It wasn't that the restaurant was busy, it's just that the staff were moving at their very own super-slow speed.  We were asked to be seated in the bar, which was perplexing when we could see that the restaurant was more than half-empty.  (And: half-empty on a Friday night? Bad sign!)  The bar staff didn't acknowledge our presence until the same second that the hostess was finally coming over to seat us.  

The whole meal was uninspired, and service was glacially slow.  The cocktails were mixed by an amateur.  The appetizers were bland and plated poorly.  My petite filet mignon was also plated poorly: why was it just tossed onto a massive platter, instead of using a plate that was of a more appropriate size?  The steaks were well-cooked, although they weren't the superior cuts of meat that I had expected based on the price.  The pommes frites were nice, but the other sides were cold, and we couldn't find a server to actually do something about it.  The sommelier kept on recommending bottles that were twice as much as we had said that we wanted to spend (and really, it's not that hard to recommend a bottle of Bordeaux in the $250 range).  When we booked the table, we had been planning on having a cheese course and then apertifs and dessert.  We bailed on that after appetizers and mains took over two hours.  

Go get a table at Bouchon.  Order cocktails.  Chat with the sommelier.  Order the steak frites.  Don't skip dessert.  Every single aspect of the Bouchon experience is miles better than Morels.  Bouchon is less expensive, the service is better, and the food is amazing.

Hostest seated me and my friend very quickly no reservation.As you walk in the dinning room they have a cheese cooler next to the wine cooler. Server was with another table so the sommelier addressed us rather quickly and helped us pick our wines for dinner.Had onion soup as starter it was hot with alot of flavor. I was having the Branzino so he paired Roussette De Savoie which is a dry white from France. It paired well with my Branzino. Pan seared crispy skin rich and creamy mashed potatoes. This was awesome so fare. My  friend had the New York Strip rare with pesto pomme puree. The pomme puree was very good the steak come with a jus over it on a sizzling hot plate all great if you want a medium steak not rare. Meat was not rested either. She had a glass of Dios Triumph which is a Zinfandel dry as well.We added sauteed green beans in foie gras butter shallots, garlic, lemon juice. These where just blanched nothing else no salt or butter. For dessert we ordered the Creme Brulee and Profiteroles. The chocolate sauce for the profiteroles was broken and not a sauce. 

Our Server Jerry C was very apologetic all night he removed the green beans from the check. So when I told him about the chocolate sauce his says he will let the chef know. He then come back and say the chef says its supposed to be a thick chocolate sauce.

203674,2016-04-23,0,O_C-2kZMHGnq3ZDL_OaG6Q,"Honestly, I wasn't expecting a whole lot - I promise.  We ordered the steak frites and croque madame.  Steak frites -  fries were good - the steak tasted like it was seasoned with taco seasoning.  I didn't know French food was seasoned with taco seasoning.  The meat was good - tender - juice - but tasted like taco.  The croque madame  was delicious.  It came with a side of homestyle breakfast potatoes.  What they failed to mention was that they put bell peppers in their homestyle potatoes.  One of us is allergic to bell peppers and so we had to send those back.  Luckily, they were kind about switching the potatoes for fries.  They did not remove anything from the bill.  What got my goat was they said they had a credit card processing had crashed and therefore would not be able to accept credit cards as part of the payment.  This restaurant is connected to the Palazzo and Venetian and has that open tab capability so that hotel patrons are able to charge their purchases to the room.  The way the waiter and manager presented the situation was that the whole hotel's system had crashed along with their own and so charging it to the room was not an option.  First, they could accept credit cards if they were manually entered.  Okay, one of us trekked back up to the room and got our discover card.  Then, magically the discover card could not be processed either when they tried putting it through.  Can you pay with visa or cash? No, no I cannot.  Are you serious right now?  We paid in cash - which is not something I wanted to do because that money$ was set aside for gambling not for paying for food that was supposed to be charged to my room or my credit card.  I call the hotel guest services to see if there's an issue with the whole system at the hotel - guess what- NO IT'S NOT!!  It was just the restaurant's malfunction.  Had I known that - I WOULD HAVE NEVER STAYED - why would you misconstrue the situation - making it seem like it is the whole system in the hotel and not just your restaurant?  That's some shady business.  You made me resent my whole dining experience because I felt bamboozled into eating at a place that was going to give me glorified tacos and allergic reactions - then make me feel bad for not wanting to pay cash because their system is broken.  Blah - not worth a return visit.  Buyer beware !",9RY6gQaj1qdTgn84H1QaJw,0,0,2,oP5FMi8znuNNcp0cXLhOiQ
222633,2012-04-13,2,O_C-2kZMHGnq3ZDL_OaG6Q,"I've never wrote a review before, but my experience at Morels was so bad I had to write one.

I was in a party of 10 people staying at the Venetian.  It was easy to get reservations, and we got seated promptly.  From there it all went downhill.  It took about 15 minutes just for the waiter to bring us menus.  After that, another 15 minutes to get water and order.  The restaurant was pretty empty at this point too.  After we ordered, we waited about another 15 minutes until we asked for some bread.  They decided to bring out the butter, but no bread.  15 minutes later, here comes the bread.

We finally get our steaks.  I ordered mine rare, and to be honest it was a little too rare, but it was still edible.  Someone in my party also ordered rare, and the steak was literally raw.  After eating about half of the horribly cooked steak, we finally had the waiter bring it back to actually get cooked to rare.  Get it back, it's still too rare.  So we sent it back again, and this time when it comes back they plate it on a small bread plate instead of the normal dinner sized plate.  So all in all, it took them three tries to cook a steak to rare, and it still wasn't cooked that well.

We were already pretty upset because the service had been super slow, and they couldn't cook a steak right.  Somehow, it gets even worse.  We get the bill and we all pull out credit cards to pay.  Morels isn't the cheapest place, we had to spend close to $80 a person for our steak and sides.  The waiter comes over to inform us that they can only have 3 credit cards on the bill.  3 credit cards?!  Are you kidding me?  At a restaurant in the Palazzo/Venetian, where a steak costs at least $50, and you're going to tell us as we start to pay that you can only use 3 credit cards on the bill?  The reasoning?  They say it's not built into their software to be able to use more than 3 cards.  BS.

We had to ask for a manager.  The experience had just been horrible, and not being able to use as many cards as you want for the bill is inexcusable, especially for a more upscale steakhouse in a hotel where every other restaurant can take more than three credit cards.  How are they going to expect everyone to be able to fork out close to $100 in cash?  In a casino.  Where you could easily lose all of that money and only have a credit card.

We asked to speak to a manager.  The manager just stood there agreeing with everything we said, saying he's only been there for a month and that for some reason, he's able to put in 5 credit cards instead of the 3 that the waiter can do.  I'm not quite sure why he's all of a sudden allowed to use 5 instead of 3, when apparently it wasn't built into their system to use more than 3 cards.  Absolutely ridiculous.

All in all, the food wasn't that great, they couldn't cook a steak, and not splitting the bill to however many credit cards you want is absolutely ridiculous in a Las Vegas upscale steakhouse.  I'd give it a 0 star if I could.  Horrible, never coming back, and you shouldn't go either.

And the other thing, this review is probably going to get taken down which is a load of BS.  I know at least three other people in my party wrote a review telling about this horrible night, and Morels was able to delete it.  I might just save this copy and check every day and keep re-posting this review.  This place was that bad.",KaY53aqMZQedAuhuaiNLTw,3,0,1,wsTAdIhEuetgErEV6sTkbw

I returned a month later early enough to catch breakfast. I had the banana stuffed French toast. It was perfect, crispy on top and soft inside. My party also enjoyed the seasonal fruit, with a side of bagels and organic bacon. The fruit was fresh and came with vanilla yogurt to dip. The mini bagels had a wonderful chive cream cheese spread. The bacon was crispy. Again, delicious food and great service. This time I also sat outside facing the south strip.

Then we waited another 30 minutes for a piece of bread. One of the steaks that we ordered was raw in the middle and took them 2 times to re-fire the steak to get it to a rare center. I went with a group of 10, so when we went to pay the check, we attempted to split it on our credit cards. We were then told they could only split it on 3 cards. The reason I was given is that each transaction costs a fee, so they only allow 3 cards. Each dish we ordered was $60+ with sides, drinks, tax, and gratuity on top of that. Ridiculous to say a transaction fee on at least an $80 charge was the reason why they would not allow us to use more credit cards. After arguing for a while, they then claimed the system would not allow more than 3 cards to be used at a single table. That again was a lie because later on a waiter came over who overheard and told us he knew how to pay the bill with 5 credit cards. We had to call a manager over who again said the system only allows 3 cards. After a round of arguments, we got it all settled.

It took over 45 minutes to just pay the bill. The whole dinner was a waste of my time and I will never go back to Morels. Too bad 0 stars is not an option on yelp reviews.",fgFNnhNbIz3Cvp_gBCOqpA,0,0,1,wMQitYp_cQx6AhVdgmdfQg

Banana stuffed French toast - two layers of hearty brioche with bananas in between. Very good but I thought the brioche was a bit dry; fortunately the cinnamon, maple, and copious amount of bananas made up for that. This is actually a good dish for sharing as you could separate the two layers of toast without make a huge mess.

Grilled chicken and proscuitto panini - Excellent. Bread has a perfect crisp and the melted-cheese-to-protein ratio  was spot on. Came with a hefty serving of frites which were delicious and salty (how I like them).

I washed everything down with a bloody mary, which they make at your table to your specifications. I ordered mine ridiculously spicy with Grey Goose. Best damned bloody mary I've had in recent times and worth every penny. 

Service: outstanding and worthy of a higher tip. The tableside-crafted bloody mary was in a service league of its own.

Good flavor of the steak

Good service...till food dropped

Cons....
Poor service once food arrived

Ends of steak charcoal not char broiled

Creme Brulee....ick custard was way over cooked and tasteless

How much was that glass of wine....

Sat at bar...all of the usual places I would normally go were full or hosting private parties.  Ordered NY strip med. rare and brussel sprouts.  Good service and banter from the male/female bar team.  Food came, ordered a glass of wine. Steak was a bit over temp but not enough to be objectionable...
However the outside was charged to the point it was hard to cut thru.  The ends where the steak tapered down had enough of the crust that the burnt taste? overwhelmed the good parts.  Sprouts were good.  Now that the food was dropped getting the bartenders attention was a fail.  Finally had a bar back order a creme brulee....at least 20 minutes elapsed before it arrived.  The custard was way over cooked and rubbery...to top it off it was tasteless.  Called it a night and got the check....umm $85 for a glass of wine....the bottle is only 16 or so more!

Our server, friendly and attentive, gave us several delicious fromage recommendations to accompany our charcuterie platter.

Four of us decided to share our meals, of which we decided on the Petit Cut Filet Mignon, the Bone In ""Eye"" of the Rib Eye Steak, the Halibut special, and Seafood linguine, with sides of truffle mac & cheese and sauteed green beans in foie gras butter. Everything was so delicious and we weren't even able to finish it all. The meats were tender and flavorful while the seafood was fresh and very delicate in texture and taste. The accompaniments were rich and ever so buttery good. I ate more than I should have and was very happy to be wearing my non-form fitting dress that evening. 

At $86 per person, for one cocktail, appetizers, and one meal per person, split 8 ways for 9 girls is not bad at all. The food was heaven, the dining experience was enjoyable and what locked in our 'large party' reservation was that we weren't subject to a pre-fixe menu, just because our group was larger than 6 people.

My husband and I arrived at the host stand and informed the three girls behind the podium that we were there to join them for happy hour and asked if it was available on the patio. The general reception was less than warm and we were told that yes, happy hour was available on the patio and in the bar. 

Intending to head out to the patio on a cool November night, I asked if there were heaters and was told, ""uh, yeah, not sure which have propane..."" seeing where this was going I decided just to sit out there. The girl that escorted us back was literally sneering at us and when we got to the patio, she pointed at the first table and said, ""there."" Not exactly host-like.

Sitting at the high top table, we noticed that there was a serious wobble in the table. So serious that when anyone adjusted in their seat, our waters spilled a bit. We asked our waitress if we could move to one of the many low tables on the patio, and we were told that those are reserved for dinner and that they would be full (later I am assuming) but we could sit inside. I asked if an exception could be made due to the fact that the table was broken and I was told no so we moved inside. 

The happy hour is two drinks for one and you can share but only if you are sharing the same thing so no mixing and matching. I ordered the happy hour white and my husband the Kronenbourg. The funny thing about two for one is that it basically takes that price of one drink down to what it would cost in any other city so it isn't really a deal if that is what you are looking for. We however, were not looking for a deal per se; we were looking for cheese.

Reading the reviews, the cheese selection was supposed to be one of the best in Vegas. I am quite the cheese lover and actually know a fair amount about cheese and like to be challenged and try new things. I was expecting a much more robust program including explanations and descriptions. There were none and our waitress didn't seem to know too much except for what was ""good"" which isn't really helpful when describing something as complex as cheese. 

Regardless, we got five cheeses and when they didn't have one of the ones we ordered, they gave us an extra one (which was nice-ish since she gave us the one we specifically said we didn't want - weird) and subbed out the one we ordered with another one I didn't want since it is a cheese I get regularly at home. A choice would have been nice. 

Ultimately, we had a huge amount of cheese, some booze, and were hanging out in Vegas so we were fine however if I want cheese again, I would head to the Wynn's Le Cave which has less to choose from but a much more knowledgeable and  friendly staff.",hcnL04OtvkDQvBVXFYw25g,0,0,2,pkx5Jr57_hCuXeWm2WnAog

Robert (Tall asian gentlemen) the manager, came to the table and did not want to comp the whole meal. He asked if there was something he could do and I said to comp the whole meal but he said no.

THE BEST VALUE IS LUNCH AT THE PALMS IN THE FORUM SHOPS.  Great value $19.50 for huge salad, filet mignon with mushrooms, fresh hot potato chips and hash browns and coffee.

Since we were staying at the Palazzo, we just dropped by around 8pm and they were able to seat us.  However, the only reason we were able to get a seat is that the outside patio was open.  While they had a few heaters amongst the tables, ours did not have one.  So we were quite cold throughout the dinner.

First off, let me say that the food is very good.  I don't think there was a single complaint or issue with the food.  I had the bone-in rib eye, and it was superb.  My colleagues also enjoyed their entrees.

That said, here was the bad during my dining experience.  First, we asked for a wine menu, which our waiter completely forgot when he came back to take our order.  So after ordering a 2005 cab from Napa, we received a 2006.  Unfortunately, my colleague didn't notice this, and he was the one who had selected it and approved the bottle.  Second, after we were served our entrees, we asked for steak knives.  They could only scrounge up 2!  How can a steakhouse run out of steak knives?  I don't know, but they did.  Finally, I would have expected them to move the heaters around as they become available from tables being vacated, especially given how it was cold that night.  It wasn't until I mentioned it to one of the waiters that they made any effort to move them around.

So, while a restaurant may have great food, the overall experience can be ruined by a lack of quality service from the staff.  So I give them only 3 stars out of 5.",yTd8NoA4N5cXIrfESzjjeg,0,0,3,GvlFdVTotQfh3eBQj21j3g

The environment is spacious and light. The menu is large and diverse, with a great cheese selection as a lot of normal steakhouse fare. Service was attentive and flexible. Great overall environment.

At a restaurant of supposedly this caliber, that is a big faux pas.  The manager then proceeded to try to convince us to drink it anyway - and explained that it was their last bottle and the other comparable ones are too expensive for them to honor the price they quoted us.  We had to send back our steaks once because they came before we even had our first glass of white (apperitif) delivered.  Our steaks came before our wine, and we had to ask for silverware.  Again, this would be fine at an Outback Steakhouse, but you shouldn't have to micromanage waiters at an upscale steakhouse to bring knives and plates.  To Add insult to injury, the filet mignonette came with a slightly astringent and gritty ""dry rub"" of "" a ton of ingredients"" including rosemary, cumin and cayenne pepper.  At $52/8oz filet that is not what you expect at a steakhouse.  At a minimum you should indicate the spice blend on the menu (waiter confirmed it is not mentioned).

Overall the food was adequate. Nothing special, and certainly not worth the price, even for Vegas. There are so many other better steakhouses within walking distance.
It was the service, and how we were treated by the manager that capped off a miserable night. As we were being seated, I noticed a couple leaving without having ordered, that was the first clue. First, everything  was brought out at the same time. I kid you not. Appetizer, salad, soup, sides, and steak. I wonder if they would have brought out coffee and desert had we put that order in also. I really am not exaggerating. They all came out at the same time without any explanation. However, the person ordering the soup was not given a spoon. After dropping off the food, no one came back by to check on us. We flagged down a busboy after 5 minutes and he went to get a spoon. He must have been distracted as he did not come back, but a few minutes later he dropped off two spoons to the couple next to us who had just ordered. I got up, found our waiter and had a spoon brought over, almost ten minutes after the food was brought out.
With the waiter now at our table, we ordered a second round of drinks, only to have a lemon drop spilled on the poor woman who had been forced to wait on the spoon.  After that, the next server who came by was a good 20 minutes clearing our plates. At this time I asked for the manager. One would think he would come over on his own, but then again.
After explaining the situation, he said he would ""tap dance on our bill,"" and commented on ""how nice and easygoing we were with the situation."" when the doused patron mentioned that her satin blouse was likely ruined, his reply ""send me dry-cleaning bill.""  Wow. I was little surprised at how flippant he was. Maybe he made the assumption we could be blown off easily as we where so laid back about it.
Here's the kicker, he took the spilled drink, the cold soup, and $25 off the bill. A cab back to our hotel to change before going out was more than that.

The Pommes Frites were solid but nothing special. We ended with the chocolate souffle and it didn't disappoint. With two glasses of red wine, the total was under 200 bucks with 30% tip which is a bargain in my eyes.

Where to begin...
I ordered a cocktail with a lime - it came to the table - they whisked it out of my hand and handed me another drink - with a lemon.... Okaaayyyy.

I ordered the filet mignon medium rare - it came blood raw... I sent it back - and all they did was re-fire the same piece of meat - which was a subpar piece to begin with.... Having already cut it made it very dry when they served it to me again.  When I pay for a $60 small filet - cooked right and not dry would be nice.  The bernaise was horrible - there was one flake of tarrigon in the cold oniony goo.  And I guess there must be more than one person dining at a table to be served bread - which the people literally sitting right next to me - let me know that it was really good... I guess I'll take their word for it.

So... One cocktail, one glass of house cab, one small filet, one baked potato plain, one serving of bernaise = an even $100.00.

I had a very disappointing experience at Morels in Las Vegas. An otherwise good and respectable brand, this particular restaurant is not only sub-par to its other locations, but very below average when it comes to restaurants in Las Vegas. 

Let's start with the food. When I order a $62 steak (their Prime corn fed beef Rib Eye sans sides) I expect it to be awesome. Not OK. Not Mediocre. But simply awesome. It wasn't worth the money I spent on it. I could have gone to a real steak house (aka. Cut, Del Monico, Morton's, Mastros, ..), spent less money and gotten a better steak. The steak was blend not cooked medium-rare as I ordered. Too bad no service personnel was around to help me out, which leads me to the next chapter of disaster.

Over the course of the dinner, I must have dealt with 4 to 5 difference waiter and waitresses. There were long absences where nobody was around to help us out. I knew something was off whey they seat you at the worst table in the house (that table next to a busy door), when the restaurant is half empty and stayed so throughout the dinner. They messed the oysters I ordered, forgot the wine, and disappeared on us. 

Lastly, what's almost the worst part, is management does not care the restaurant is falling apart at so many levels. On my way out, I happened to bump into a manager and briefly alerted him about my experience. I wasn't looking for a refund or a voucher, I had already paid at the time. The gentleman just did not care about the lack of quality and shrugged it off.

Las Vegas has tons of great restaurants. It has many great steak houses - stick with what you know if you want to spend some good money and skip Morels.",dBbmf0hGiRrlxSAUjvLOiQ,2,0,1,fTkdDlrUNQ50u34b7D0d0A

Most people ordered some form of steak, I had a 35 day aged NY Strip. The waitress suggested to me that the steak temp be medium ""in order to fully release the flavor"" -- since medium is how I usually order my steaks, I agreed.

The table's food soon arrived and I started eating my steak at the narrower end of the NY and it was fine. By the time I got about half way through my steak, it was essentially raw and not just in the middle but through about 80% of of the steak. Looked around and two of my clients who ordered steaks also had them extremely under cooked.

Called the waitress over and showed her my steak -- there was really no way to dispute the doneness. I'm not even sure it was safe to eat even if you like a med-rare steak it was well under done. The waitress agreed and offered to bring it up to temp.

Over the years I've learned to never send food back and ask for it to be fixed. Better to just walk away from a bad meal. I told the waitress not to bother and went back to talking with my clients and associates. 

Eventually the manager approaches, apologizes and makes a token offer of a drink or a dessert to me for the trouble. I wasn't really that hungry and was with clients, so not wanting to make a scene, I simply said no thanks. The manager apologizes again and says he has spoken with the kitchen.

My company was picking up the bill, so I didn't press it, but what floors me in all of this is: 

1. If you pay $64 for a steak it better be cooked correctly. If anybody had simply checked the temp of *any* of the steaks at our table, they would have realized the problem. It should have never even been sent out.

2. At no point did the manager offer to pick up the cost of the steak, offer us a free meal, anything. He simply shrugged his shoulders and walked away, thinking he had done all he could.

3. There was a big conference staying at the hotel, we were all in business attire, but the manager didn't seem to consider that we were with clients (or that maybe I *was* a customer of the host, since I didn't pick up the check). Or maybe he did realize and didn't offer the comp because we were going to expense the meal.

If it had been just me or my wife and I on a date, I would have probably pressed it a bit more. If it had been a $20 steak, I would have probably just written it off, but for $64 you expect perfection or near perfection.

Needless to say I will never bring a customer to Morel's again nor eat there myself.",QntKuUlgDw0s4WBqKWOQRw,3,1,1,xqatfpdxiUCw5iKk2zu6ww

I dont know what the low raters are talking about - if you dont appreciate fine dining...go to freaking Denny's - its likely a better fit for you.

We had 5-star service and the menu/wine list was above excellent.
There is something for everyone and every price range on the menu - and you'll have a hard time deciding between the seafoods, steaks or poultry.

We started with the French Onion Soup which was excellent. A much bigger portion I would expect for a starter (be cautious of this..it almost filled us up before dinner) and I had the 18-hour slow braised beef rib (OH MY GOD!!!!!) and Hubby had a barramundi fish special (awesome)

I dont normally eat meat (I'm a Flexitarian) but was tempted by the Slow Braised Short Rib which is rare. I can never eat red meat ever again, as it will never compare to the pure perfection that was this dish. You touch the meat with your knife (which short ribs will usually vary from tender to like a shoe) and the meat fell apart. The sauce was mind blowing and I couldnt get enough.

The whole barramundi thing with my husband was quite comical to us. The waiter looked at us with our funny accents and treated us like we were a tad too 'common' for his eclectic tastes. He gave us the whole 'lesson' on Barramundi fish and we told him we love barramundi as we are Australian and its an Australian fish - we grew up on the stuff. 
He insisted we were wrong it was a New Zealand fish and also corrected us on how to pronounce it - 'barra-mooooon-dey' (its an aboriginal word.. trust us, we know how its pronounced and that wasn't it) So we spent much of the meal saying Barramundi in sentences just to watch the steam come out of his ears. He was a slightly pretentious waiter - but they are the best kind. He knew his menu and his wines and his service was excellent. Just a small case of 'pole-up-butt' syndrome.
 
Another small touch I LOVED and which sometimes goes unnoticed: Hubby and I were dressed up as we were about to go to a show - the waitress who seated us automatically looked at what we were wearing and swapped our napkins to black ones. I hate getting white napkin fluff on my black clothes. It was an extra winning touch.

They had a fine range of after dinner wines and grappas, but I couldn't fit any more in which I regret. I really wanted to try some of their great cheeses they had on display in their cheese room. We will definitely be going back again.",36jlvrYDtIaUljRlHOTkjw,1,1,5,6-B_mPrwdj-8vGl5sRHi9w
1282296,2014-11-18,0,O_C-2kZMHGnq3ZDL_OaG6Q,"I had not heard of Morels even though I had dined across the way at Lavo's. I ashamed to say it I had become a celebrity chef snob in this town.  It's easy to get wrapped up in all the hoop-la and forget what is at the core of eating out... the food.  I actually planned on having a rack of lamb at Delmonico's that night until I was convinced otherwise by my business associate. 

Morels may not have the celebrity chef attached to their name but they don't need the hype. If you are a true fan of the dining experience, do yourself a favor and come here. The star of this location is you and the food that is presented exquisitely. 

Maybe you're thinking I'm talking crazy bashing Ramsey, Emeril, Bobby Flay or any other of their likes. By all means that is not what I am doing because I enjoy eating in restaurants they attach their name and will continue to frequent their establishments. What I am saying is that Morels does it better in Vegas as far as I am concerned. Although who I am but a humble foodie who was privileged to meet executive chef Carrera who has been cooking for the owner for over a mere of oh 25 years. 

His attention to detail in his plating, seasoning and selection of prime cuts doesn't grant him a TV show but it should.  His humble nature as he explained he approach to cooking makes him even more remarkable. Why you may ask? Well I'll tell you... His focus is on his craft not on himself. He lets his dishes speak for himself and not the other way around. 

We were treated by the chef to a sample of Tuna Tartare, although it was only bite sized, it was a mouthful of delectable flavor. I knew this bite size treat was a good sign for things to come. 

The Grand Plateau DE Mer was presented to the table and sadly since I'm allergic to shellfish, I could only enjoyed watching my dinner guests satisfy their palettes. It looked fabulous and the attention to detail was duly noted in the lobster. They take the time to extract the tender meat from the claws and carefully fold them whole into each half. The sauces stacked on top were seasoned to compliment the snow crab, shrimp, lobster and oysters. At least this was explained to me by those enjoying this dish. This is one that should be shared because it would be a feat to finish alone. 

Although I was delighted to see how this dish was enjoyed by others my stomach began to be shellfish and grumble waiting for my entree. Yeah that was cheesy but at least I briefly laughed when I wrote it but I digress.  Finally my Colorado Rack of Lamb with a honey-mustard crust ordered medium rare arrived.  Ordered any other way would be a crime and a dishonor to this beautiful creature who sacrificed its life for my enjoyment.  

A moment of silence please... 

Ok moving on the lamb sit on top of a wine enriched rosemary bordelaise sauce that was not over-powering or too sweet.  Every bite was tender and it balanced well with the bread crust which drove the flavor home.  This is now the best lamb I have had in Vegas and my only regret is not trying it sooner than I did.

I paired this with potato dauphinois which is similar to scalloped potatoes just on a whole different level. The potatoes had this crusted on the outside from being in the oven and the center was soft from the creamy consistency of the sauce. All in all it was amazing and the portions were reasonable, I had room for desert.

I had, from what I remember because I was in a midst of a foodie comatose, the chocolate dome.  It was an amazing finish to a great meal.  If you can look past the hoop-la of the celebrity chefs, do yourself a favor and focus on what matters the most... the food.  Morels is sure to satisfy your every craving and then some. 

By the way, if you were wondering my lamb was better than what I normally have in town at near by Delmonico's.",xBvDrnp8Kl45aXkuRTeRvA,0,0,5,G3gWoenEj9v-n1pXqa1WWQ

Petit Plateau De Mer - 4 Shrimps, 6 Oysters, Octopus Ceviche, Dungeness Crab - FRESH. It's the seafood freshness that you can't describe. The octopus ceviche was very disappointing tho - didn't even touch it after tasting it. 

Crab Oscar Benedict - served on a non-traditional bread, but wasn't bad. I almost prefer this bread instead of the traditional English muffin. 

Mussels Marinire - Mussels, Garlic, Shallots, White Wine sauce, side of fries.  The fries soaked in white wine sauce with garlic and shallots made this dish.  However, the mussels were over cooked, the shells were broken and dried out, and the mussel were shriveled.  Since it was over cooked, the white wine boiled away leaving less sauce to enjoy.  So the best part of it, the sauce & fries, was short lived.  If they cooked it just right I'd come back for this dish.

Service - nothing spectacular. They didn't neglect you but they didn't go above and beyond.

I'm giving it 2 stars only because my 18 hour braised short ribs were pretty decent ... It would have been better had it not been COLD. When they said ""18-hour braised"" I didn't think they meant it would feel like 18 hours had passed before you got your food. 
My entire party's food was cold. We had ordered some drinks and wine, and had to wait at least half an hour for us to get our drinks.

Although the fondue appetizer was excellent, the steak I ordered (a $67 filet minion) came out cold.  Ice cold. Like it was in a refrigerator..... cold.  Weird. When I reordered the steak, it came rare (instead of medium as ordered) 20 minutes later. I just don't understand it.  After two swings and two misses I decided to call it quits and asked for my check rather than wait another 20 minutes for another steak.  To make matters worse, the manager didn't come out to say anything, he left the waiter (from another table) explaining and apologizing to me (my waiter had disappeared). Then, when I specifically requested the manager, I waited almost 15 minutes for him to appear.  I think I have a good idea where the problem is here.  Great product, great servers, but really crappy management.  I'm not sure what to say here because I really wanted to like Morels, but there are two things you must do when charging almost $70 for a steak. It must be hot and it must be the right temperature. Also, in a place like this, if a customer has a problem, the manager should be out immediately solving the issue. Morels misses on both of these points. It's clear to me that this manager was not interested in his customers or his team's performance. Very sadly, I give Morels 1 star and advise them to find new management.

We also had the lobster risotto, which was super oily and really heavy, even for an appetizer portion. But at least it had generous chunks of lobster!

When our bill came ,our server said he couldn't take the coupon and to talk to our hotel or the Grazie desk . Ok , no big deal .

Instead we gave $25.00. As he walked away with the bill in hand , he opened it and rolled his eyes . I'm like really . Are you serious . Why $25 and not $28 for the tip ? Well first like I said the food was delicious but $40 for oysters etc . The night before , we ate at Table 10 , Emerils restaurant and it was waaaay better than here . Price , quality and service. I understand this is a French restaurant but way overpriced. I mean $ 25 is $25 . I don't know what he was expecting. Lesson learned here . Won't be returning here . Table 10 , I highly recommend. I think we could've gave a $30 tip and he still would've rolled his eyes . Ppl shouldn't be greedy and thankful for whatever they get . Also for this being a French upscale restaurant, the music they played was Elton John Benny and the Jets , Journey etc . Come on . Oysters $40 side of asparagus $14 but we need to listen to this kind of music in a fancy restaurant. Looks like we were the ones who should've been rolling our eyes .

Everything was off to a great start...the entrance/grand lobby of the Palazzo (impressive), the very nice and laid-back environment (sure beats the crap animation show and music at the SW), the excellent service, the 3 fantastic bottles of wine (sommelier's choice), the oyster/lobster appetizers, excellent side dishes...I was ready to chalk it up as a 5.  They got everything right so far, and heck, all they have to do is serve a decent steak.  Then I got the Kansas City steak (essentially their NY steak)......it was horrendous.  They didn't cook it properly.....asked for medium rare, and this could barely pass as a suitable rare (I know, I know, some people ask for a cold middle).....we're talking 85% red-pink and 5% grey.  I finished about 2 bites, but  I'm not one to complain, and besides, I'm not going to return the steak and have them use their special sauce (I wasn't feeling too hungry anyways).  But at the end of the meal, I let our server know.....another member of our party criticized his steak as well (too charbroiled.....at a place like this, wtf?  Not as bad as mine, but still crap).  Our server took our steaks away to show the chef.  I've been to places where they would take the steak off the bill...fine not both, but maybe one.  I could really care less about the money...it's the whole principle of it, you know?  Either way, we weren't the only table complaining......the table right next to us, this older gentleman sent back his steak as soon as he took his first bite.

Either way, everything but the steak was just fine.  But it's a steakhouse...they're not supposed to mess up.  The chef did give us tiny little cookies afterwards (""on the house"").  What class.  But the reason why I'm not giving this place 1 star is because the other members of my party enjoyed their meals.

I must admit I have been spoiled by the fine steakhouses in the Bay Area, CA.  But I would have expected more from Morels.  My best guess is that if I go there again, I'll probably have a great steak.  But first impressions are also important......",5cI0ayj4VWMoD-YEPqUNUA,1,0,2,RFTdpgxoI6aRrKhIYWQUgw

Since we were staying at the Palazzo, we decided to eat dinner at Morels before heading out for the night. It's nice to be able to get dolled up and arrive at the restaurant without having to take a taxi (especially since it was about 100 degree outside!!). 

We started off with a cheese platter. We told the self proclaimed cheese monger the various cheeses that we liked and he brought out a selection of 6 cheeses that he thought would match our tastes. I actually only liked 1 of the cheeses - it tasted like parmigiano reggiano (LOVE). However, everybody else at my table seemed to love the cheeses. 

As for our entrees, we decided to share multiple dishes, family-style. We ordered the halibut, filet, bone-in ribeye, the linguine special and a side of truffle mac and cheese. My favorites were the linguine and mac and cheese, of course, as I am carb lover extraordinaire. The halibut was well cooked, but lacking in flavor and the steaks were comparable to say.. a Ruth's Chris, with a 20% mark-up.

All in all, good meal with great company. I love how my girls can eat a big steak dinner before going clubbing. That's how we roll.",F_av-YrDAOgmdEV9a7WX_Q,0,0,3,u0qr5G2h-_nrf0CsQHG2-w

- I was lusting after the escargot for our appetizer and was told about 10 mins after I ordered it that they were out.
- When we arrived we were told our table was running about 10 mins behind, so we went to the bar. For my pre-dinner drink I ordered my standard dirty martini w/ blue cheese olives. The waitress at the bar told me they may be out of the blue cheese olives so I asked if they could stuff some for me. She gave me some snide comment about it. For a French restaurant at this price point I should have never been told they may be out - did they run out of olives or blue cheese? No. They may run out of those that they stuffed already earlier in the night - stuff some more.
- My mother and I ordered the special, fillet w/ crab on top and 4 asparagus spears. I didn't ask the price, so that was a bit my fault if I really cared, but the regular fillet of the same size was about $30 less than the special turned out to be. Not worth the ~1oz of crab on top of the fillet. Even besides that, the fillet wasn't great. 

It feels like nit-picking when looking at what I've written, but for a nice dinner out, where we took my Mom & Dad out for their birthdays, when in the end we had a $600 bill for 4 people, both my fiancée and I had the same 'ehh, not worth it and won't go back' feeling of the entire night, especially the 'ehh-ness' of the food. And these that I listed were not all of the small deficiencies we saw throughout the night. Hoping that a manager reads this and corrects his staff. Of all of the wonderful, high end restaurants in Vegas that I've been to, this is one I will not be recommending not visiting again.",P4gPkP8uMXq7Zr5PoGTnAA,0,0,3,vh2nygE_0742NV24Va2-FA

1689354,2014-08-07,0,O_C-2kZMHGnq3ZDL_OaG6Q,"Our group of 10 dined at Morels in August of 2014. We make a trip to Las Vegas every summer and typically eat at one fine dining restaurant a visit. I personally go to Las Vegas at least twice a year and try to average 1 - 2 fine dining meals a trip. Earlier this trip my fiancee and I ate at Barrymore and we both felt that the meal at Morels was significantly better.

The reasons our group enjoyed our meal at Morels:
Service: I was the last of the group to arrive, so I do not know how the host / hostess did with the initial greeting. I do know that our party was seated promptly and professionally. Our waiter (Jake, I think) did an excellent job of answering menu questions and making recommendations. We had one vegetarian in the group and the chef made her a special pasta dish that was not on the menu. The support staff, sommelier and management were all extremely friendly and attentive.

Food: The food was OUTSTANDING. We had 2 meat and cheese plates to start things off and they set the tone for the rest of the evening. Our group ordered oysters in the half shell (they had 4 varieties that evening) and those of us that ate them enjoyed them. Morels offers a Caesar salad for 2 that is prepared tableside and it is delicious. 80% of the group ordered steak, breaking down to 6 filets and 1 porterhouse that was split by 2 folks. I was one of the guys enjoying the porterhouse and it was fantastic. All steaks were cooked to proper temperature. In terms of side dishes, I had tastes of the asparagus, mac n' cheese and french fries. I felt the mac n' cheese was very good and the other 2 sides were solid. The french fries are skinny cut, not thick steak fries. We also ordered a few desserts, my personal favorite were the doughnuts with jam. The overall quality of the food was excellent.

Atmosphere: Our reservation was for 8pm on a Saturday night. The restaurant was not very crowded when we arrived, and the atmosphere was comfortable and enjoyable. There was one other large party at the restaurant when we were seated and their presence did not affect our service or enjoyment of the dining area. After our meal, we went out on the balcony, which overlooks The Strip, and enjoyed a few after dinner drinks. By the time we left, the dining room was significantly busier but not too loud. 

Like any good steak restaurant, your meal will not be inexpensive. The question is: Do you feel like you got your money's worth at the end of the evening? Our group's response to this question is an overwhelming ""YES!"". I would not hesitate to recommend this restaurant and plan on going back in October.",PpKfJDqUAtHC0yLD2EeFXA,2,0,5,z9yT3aYFZOPYUnDhqfcDOQ

I chose the Croque Monsieur.  A delicious French originated sandwich! They mold this sandwich together with country ham, gruyere cheese & sauce mornay enclosed in sourdough.   Each bite was delectable.  The sauce had a rich flavor which was drizzled over the entire sandwich.  It really takes a grilled cheese to another level.

Unfortunately our brunch did not start off on the right foot.

Upon seating us the hostess gave a little big of an attitude when we commented that it took a little long to set up tables in what appeared to be an empty and ready restaurant. 

Other than the 'tude from the hostess everything else was fantastic. It's a shame too because I would have probably given them 5 stars if not for her. Our server was great, very attentive, very nice. My mimosa was perfectly made and they also offer a Bloody Mary bar.

I want to take a moment to focus on the quiche Lorraine here......................AMAZING

It's buttery, salty from the bacon, sweet from the caramelized onions, flaky and so damn great. No joke the best I've had in this city. I've also lived in Paris many years ago and I fondly remember gaining 20 pounds in just six months over quiche Lorraine there! 

The restaurant is beautiful with a bistro feel that has very sexy art all over the place and our waitress was kind enough to give me a few postcards with the artists info who is Tom Cannon. The art is perfect and they also have a beautiful outdoor space that overlooks Las Vegas Blvd. 

The food is really great here and did I mention they have quiche Lorraine? Ok let's get through this and the highlights without losing my focus. The tuna tartare was fresh and light. The cheese fondue was decadent and fun to dip & eat. The crab omelet my friends ordered was fluffy and delicious and my quiche was out of this world. I remember every bite...:)

We sat timely for a 7:30pm reservation and were a large party of 12. After about 10 minutes, a waiter came and took our drink orders. About 20 minutes later, our drinks came. About 30 minutes after that, we GRABBED our waiter and asked him if he was planning to take our order. Finally, he did. 

We placed a relatively straightforward appetizer + entree each order. About 15 minutes later, 3 out of 12 people received Caesar Salads that they ordered, but nothing else. Not until we called for the manager, and then waited another 10 minutes, did the remainder of the appetizer orders come.

Brunch menu is massive, with griddle, egg, and more lunch/entree options, as well as featured specials, where we found some of the best dishes.

The gratis beignet starter course was appreciated but not particularly enjoyed, I'd save my calories for a cappuccino. By far the favorite dish at the table was the imported mushroom souffle, which had a great rise and a rich Gruyere flavor in addition to the morels themselves. The Banana & Mascarpone-stuffed French Toast and Bananas Foster Pancakes were hits with those who favor sweeter breakfasts, but I tend to go more savory. 

The classic BLT sando with added avo is served with a mountain of fries. The bacon portion is huge and perfectly crisp, but the pesto-mayo was a bit too subtle for my liking. I recommend getting extra on the side to dip your fries, too. The sandwiches in general are huge, and the French Dip another in our group got was massive.

 If your entree is not enough food for you, adding on the French Onion soup is always a safe bet. If you're sharing, I suggest the ""Almost Famous"" Mac and Cheese, which had a great sauce and was amply portioned even without adding protein.  As for the dessert course, we had some technical difficulties with the Baked Alaska, which I did not care for but was enjoyed by others in our group. 

Staff was fairly accommodating of our antics, and we had a great group table in the middle of the dining room, allowing for a view of the interesting selection of wall art featured here... to say the least.

I have been to just about every strip steak place and this is hands down my least favorite. And not just by a little bit, by a rather large margin.I love steak and I love French so this should have been a match made in heaven, perhaps how much I looked forward to going here tainted my view but it was so bad it can't all have been my bias. Just look at my review record- I have enver given 1 star to anything else- I am a pretty soft judge


First- my reception.

I had just spent an inordinate amount of time playing poker at the Venetian. As such I was not dressed super formally- khaki shorts, polo shirt, tennis shoes- more than acceptable for vegas lunch. This is on a Weds about 230pm. The host ( a dude) ignores me for about 5 minutes while he is on the phone than finally, reluctantly, brings me to a table. It is then about 20 minutes before I see my waiter. During this wait I am drinking some water and happen to empty my glass. The water guy comes up and starts pouring the water before the pitcher is over the glass and misses the glass for a solid 3 seconds soaking the entire table and myself before he notices. I ask to move to a dry table. He tells me ""maybe"". At this point I look around, I am one of 6 people in the entire place. Eventually I get moved.

My Order
I try to get the exact same thing my first time at every steak house here for comparison- bone in ribeye, potato side, tartare. The waiter comes up to my table and I try and get my order in as quickly as possible since I have already been waiting. 

me: ""Tenderloin Tartare, Bone in ribeye medium rare, potato dauphinois""
him: would you like to hear about our specials
me: no
him: well then what would you like
me: Tenderloin Tartare, Bone in ribeye medium rare, potato dauphinois
him: im not sure we have that
me: which part
him: uh... the potato

it only went downhill from there. He didn't write anything down, came back twice to ask to clarify, and then brought tuna tartare. The tuna was actually the highlight of the day.

The Steak
I like steam rare to medium rare. That being said, I will eat just about anything. The steak that was brought to me was not even grey, it was so dark grey throughout I doubted if it was actual meat. It looked like an overcooked mcdonalds hamburger inside. I first cut a piece off the end and decided to give them the benefit of the doubt- maybe it wasn't like that in the middle. It was. 

Now, a quick note about me. I don't really ever send food back. I'm a gambler and I think ordering food is sort of a gamble- in this case I gambled and lost. Also, if a kitchen has already screwed something up I don't have much faith in them fixing it so generally I just let it go.

And that is what I planned to do here. So my waiter comes back and says ""how is everything"". The following conversation ensues

me: The steak is way overcooked, its inedible, can I get my check
him: It looks fine to me

Ok, thats annoying. Still, never argue with stupid people right...

me: just the check please
him: I'll bring that right out

15 minutes later the waiter comes back with another waiter

New waiter- I'm sorry sir, we cannot send that back, it looks medium rare to me. 

At this point I am flabbergasted. Was I getting punked? Could I actually be eating in a professional restaurant? Let alone a nice one in Las Vegas? Could anyone working in a steakhouse for longer than 3's of minutes think this was medium rare?

me: I'm not trying to send it back, I just want my check

Another 10ish minutes go by and I get my check. I choose to pay by way of the credit card. I put it in the little wallet thing and stand it up so all can see the card sticking out of it. At this point I look at my watch and think to myself ""how long could this take"". Turns out quite a while. After another 10 minutes I look around and I can't see any other customers in the place. I take my check and walk to the front where the host and 3-4 waiters are sitting in the bar area. I ask my waiter to run my card which he sighs and then does. Also, they charged me for the tenderloin tartare which is 1 dollar more than the Tuna....

I then walked outside across the street and ate at stripburger.

In closing, Carne Vino greater than Morels",s-591-mtIyP7F1Lffw98jw,11,5,1,uvX8rzeMsWgGXsDId6TDbg

If you get a seat outside and you're lucky enough you can watch the Treasure Island show. Or if you're unlucky enough stay there during a show, all a matter of perspective.

So the meal which was priced at 50.12

Onion Soup Gratinee
 - Overall this was the best fancy named french onion soup i've had. It was rich and...soupy...it was good. Normally i don't order french onion soup or onion soup but this was good. 

Baby Iceberg Lettuce
 - Pretty much a wedge salad with three wedges. Bacon cuts were nice and thick and wonderfully smoked but the blue cheese dressing was way too rich and plentiful.

Mediterranean Branzino
 - I did enjoy the sides the came with this Mediterranean SEABASS but for the fish itself...yeah i forgot what seabass tasted like. Way too buttery as well.

Profiteroles 
 - enough with the fancy names...These are little puff pastries filled with vanilla ice cream and includes chocolate sauce. At this point of the dinner all of us were way too stuffed to even consider dessert but it came out anyway. I enjoyed the ice cream more then the pastry due to my need to live to eat another day.


Morels relies on the older French ideology of cooking which heavily relies on rich and heavy sauces to enhance food. Totally different and may be a bit heavy on you if you're more used to lighter aromatic dishes of today's modern dining experiences.",7A7FOLZZKL0iokQVOAEbgA,1,0,3,IV99U6rgkZ8PxJ3tLTSJQg

Located in the Palazzo, Morels is classy, but not stuffy, restaurant with great service and really nice outdoor patio.  They have a nice brunch menu, filled with all the normal breakfast foods such as eggs, french toast, eggs benedict, crepes and pancakes.

I wanted something light, so I opted for the Beet and Apple Salad (Candy Beets, Walnuts, Mixed Greens, Humbolt Fog Goat Cheese, Balsamic Vinaigrette, Honey
Drizzle)....delicious!  The honey brought out the sweetness of the beets and apples.  For me, the stand out was the Handcrafted Blood Mary, which they made table side.  Fresh horseradish, roasted tomatoes, fresh herbs, Tabasco, fresh ground pepper...equals fresh and delicious! It was really fun watching them make it.

I also tried a bite of the Eggs Norwegian (Sautéed Spinach, Poached Eggs, Toasted Brioche, Hollandaise, Smoked Salmon) which was delightful and surprisingly not that heavy.  I really liked the use of brioche because it was nice and buttery!

Overall, a nice spot to chill with your friends with mimosas or handcrafted bloody marys!  (The artwork inside is racy, sexy and surprising).",OmJFxyx7bL-2W4W8c-sZ7A,2,2,4,KkFd1j_cV6UtsVsorUViLw
2012435,2015-04-06,0,O_C-2kZMHGnq3ZDL_OaG6Q,"It just did not impress at all. For $140 bill for two I expected much better from a French restaurant. 

The place was nearly empty on Sunday at 9pm. This should have meant better, more consistently attentive service, but no. It took a good 5 minutes for our server to show up with the menus. Take queue from Denny's and have the hostess give the menus to the clients - it works! Our server was ok, but I felt she did the bare minimum in checking on us and being friendly. 

After a little while the attentiveness improved by the assistant waiter who would refill our beverages on time and without us asking. 

Now on to the food. It was OK. Not bad but not great either. We had mussels and the halibut, and did not find either to be anything special or with some unique twist that would leave a lasting impression. The potato dauphinois side lacked seasoning, and was underwhelming.  The $37 dozen of oysters was fresh and delicious. 

With so many restaurants in Vegas, having a restaurant with many mediocrities is a sure way for another more 'hungry' competitor to take over and wow the patrons.  Unfortunately for Morels, it needs improvement in consistency across many departments to stave off the hungry competitors. Otherwise we are sure to see some new eatery open in its place soon.",3irUJORP8qO5epRgDv69Sw,0,0,2,LrMwcAXxIb1EBFsx5fKT1A

Food from apettizers of oysters to the lovely dry aged steaks are just to die for with the mushroom sauce.

Dinner started off with an amuse bouche of rib meat with red pepper cream on a crostini.  It was a good bite.

For an entree, I had the filet mignon with bernaise sauce.  The filet was super tender and the bernaise sauce was incredible.  My only complaint is that the filet was cooked weird - it went from medium well on one end to medium rare on the other end. (I ordered it medium).  

For a side, I had the truffle mac and cheese.  Hands down the best truffle mac and cheese I've ever had.  It was incredible.

The food was absolutely delicious. We started out with the tuna tartar, which was fresh and very tasty. The onion soup was just ok. It had a little sour taste to it which is something that I am not used to, but that is just a personal preference. I had the 18 hour braised ribs, my husband had the 28 day filet mignon medium well, and a friend had the sea bass. All was very very good. The steak was one of the best I have ever tried. The ribs were delicate and simply melted in my mouth. The sea bass was also very delicate and cooked just right. The drinks were delicious and they did not skimp on the alcohol. 

Overall, expect to pay a lot for dinner. We paid $300 without tip for a three coarse meal for 4 people. The steaks does not come with a side so you will have to order one if you want more than meat.

I love Restaurant Week because you get to enjoy good food and it's for a good cause. A portion of all proceeds goes to help the Three Square food bank in Southern Nevada. She made a reservation online using Open Table for 11am. Morels is located in the Grand Lobby at the Palazzo, right next to the hotel check in and Lavo. We arrived promptly for our reso and it was found right away. We asked to sit outside on the patio and we were seated at a table in the shade. 

The Restaurant Week menu included a 3 course meal of either breakfast or lunch. Dinner is also available later in the evening. My friend and I opted to do both breakfast and lunch and share everything. The first courses were seasonal fruit and yogurt and a Greek salad. We got to pick our mains and we chose steak frites and classic eggs benedict. And for dessert we got vanilla creme brulee and a strawberry crepe. I also ordered an orange juice, and she was supposed to receive French pressed coffee as it came with the breakfast, but it wasn't until we were well into our second course that we had to flag someone down to bring us the coffee. My friend also said she would have probably ordered a bloody mary from the cart they had, but was never offered. That is the only gripe I have to say about Morel's is the service was lacking. 

Food wise, everything was delicious. The seasonal fruit was fresh and paired nicely with the vanilla yogurt. The Greek salad was like a wedge salad with tons of olives, feta, and tomatoes dressed in a light vinaigrette. The steak frites was an 8oz piece of skirt steak and fries. The steak was cooked perfectly medium as we requested. The fries although plain were quite tasty. I dipped them in some ketchup. I enjoyed the classic benedict, which was 2 poached eggs, country ham and a generous amount of hollandaise atop a thick piece of brioche bread. Last but not least, dessert. The vanilla creme brulee was fantastic. I loved breaking into the sugary shell and indulging in the smooth vanilla egg custard underneath. I could have eaten the whole thing, but I had a delicious strawberry crepe waiting for me. The crepe was light and airy, filled with a lovely whipped cream and then topped with strawberries, bananas, and chocolate sauce. For both of us we spent around $32 with tax and tip which is not bad when brunching on the strip. We both agreed that we would definitely come back to Morel's.",JYcCYNWs8Ul6ewG5kCYW4Q,4,4,4,ZRCMnaURv7RhKaBVfSmDdA

2091413,2015-11-25,1,O_C-2kZMHGnq3ZDL_OaG6Q,"Skip this place at all costs. You've been warned. 

It should be a sign that a French steakhouse on the strip is completely empty the majority of the time- because ANYWHERE else would be a better choice. 

Over priced for the quality of service, ambience, and food. 

Service- HORRIBLE customer service. Just awful. I'm not sure who was our actual waiter because our first waiter made a HUGE, clumsy, rookie mistake (I don't want to go into details about that, because for benefit of the doubt it was a freak accident, not an everyday occurrence) and was swept away before he could even apologize. At least 3 other waiters took his place. Unfortunately quantity didn't equal quality. All lacked professionalism for this being a more ""classy"" restaurant. The real problem though is the manager. The manager of this restaurant needs to take charge, have a mandatory customer service training for his staff, and remember that the customers are important and it is his job to make sure they leave happy, full, and satisfied! The way the ""clumsy mistake"" was handled was NOT okay. Not by a long shot and that was definitely the worst part of the whole dining experience.  

Ambience- It was basically empty except one or two other tables. This was 730 on a weekend night. Besides the actual restaurant, the bathrooms looked like they haven't been remodeled since before the Palazzo was built, and the soap used to wash your hands is the same kind you get at the dollar store, Softsoap, and it was obvious water had been added to it to make it last longer.  

Food- food was just okay. Not bad, but not something worth going back for. There are better steaks that are cooked how you ordered them, all over the strip. The tartare was served with what looked and tasted like ruffles potato chips. Sauces and salts were brought to the table without an explanation of which was which. 

If you want a ""fancy"" meal on the strip, or are craving a good steak, don't just settle for this place because of convenience or short wait time! There's a reason! You will be disappointed.  

As a side note, we were given a name and email by the Palazzo to express our experience at Morels, whom we emailed within an hour of our meal. It's been over 72 hours and we still have not received a response.",lesibuEJWVqTtrLSeEk95A,1,0,1,fhRZy2oQealoW7zOZgm78A

My drink order was incorrect and they made it seem like it was my fault .

My $60 rib eye was stringy, had some gristle and was barely warm on its presentation.

I'm a wine and cheese whore so I love places that offer different wines, cheeses, and wine pairings. We ordered the 5 charcuterie (hope I spelled that right) plate along with the 5 cheese plate which included cow and goat milk. All selections were great and this was just the appetizer!
For our main dishes, we had the petit filet and the rib eye. Both steaks were delicious, can't say the same for the Mac n cheese side, but the taste of everything else made up for it.

We were a party of 11, so not ridiculous, but certainly not small.
Things seemed to start alright and the water and wine we ordered were poured often, but then it went downhill.
I expect higher prices in Vegas, but $26 for crabmeat cocktail and it's barely enough for one person is a little ridiculous. The shrimp and tuna were no different. Good for one, but sharing is optional.
The meal? Pretty much everyone ordered steak, as you do at a steakhouse.For me, I ordered a bone-in ribeye. After I ordered, found out they didn't have it. Ordered the prime ribeye. 
Then we waited. For literally an hour. I think they forgot to put it in and then realized their failure. Why? Out of 10 steaks ordered, 3 were done properly. I ordered medium rare and it was purple on the inside. One ordered well and it was bright pink. Medium well came out medium rare if they were lucky; it was bordering rare. I think they forgot, slapped them on the grill quick, plated and sent them. For a $65 steak, it should be perfect. And the sides? Small, one person sides and overdone. The brussel sprouts were basically black.
We had a better meal the night before at the burger place near the food court. Avoid this place.",-fCCDyJd7YM7SrLrM_h8zQ,0,0,1,Xg_luBrKvZ6-AYVuiK-xMg

the early dinner unfortunately had to be cut early for me to catch my place - the kitchen wasnt able to pump everything out in the 30 minutes the bartender had promised.  had the escargot which was out of the shell, sauteed with red wine and onions, and some pork, was good.  the oysters were pretty good too.  then the filet with poivre sauce and the foie gras add on - had to be put into a plastic box for me to take on a plane.  i saved it to dine with the BF once i got home and accidentally over cooked it (i know i know!!) but it still came out delicious (yay).  also brought home the chocolate dome dessert which was TOO sweet for me.  peanut butter, chocolate and gold flakes.  but the BF loved it.

2298068,2012-05-18,1,O_C-2kZMHGnq3ZDL_OaG6Q,"My biggest regret of the entire trip to Vegas was walking past CUT, Carnevino, and LAVO to eat at Morel.

I took a gambling and fine dining trip to Vegas with my brother and a close friend, and after a good stretch of gaming we decided to satiate our hunger in one of the fine restaurants around Palazzo.  We walked around, past the restaurants listed above (which are all on the top 40 Vegas list), into Morel.  

Truth be told, the main draw that led me into Morel was that the hostesses were very easy on the eyes, so I thought this was the kind of establishment that employed these kinds of people as waiters as well.  Now that I think of it, it was very naive of me, because everyone inside waiting the tables were men.  Respectable and well dressed, but men nonetheless.  

At the hour we dined, there was only one other group dining, so they could have put us anywhere in the entire room.  They chose to put us right next to the station that all the waiters were standing by.  They could hear every word we said.  One of us offhandedly mentioned that we could use more bread, and one of the waiters came over to inquire if we needed anything.  While this might sound helpful, it was really nothing more than annoying.  I'm sure you can understand what it feels like to have no privacy when you want to share your opinions of a new restaurant between friends.

The restaurant itself boasts a fantastic view of the strip, and of the T.I. show that's just across the street.  We chose to sit inside because the weather was a little warmer.  The bar area is quite modern, with a couple of flatscreen TVs playing the Celtics game, but the restaurant area boasts nothing.  It didn't make me feel like I was paying $70 for a steak.  Maybe I'm alone in this opinion, but if I'm going to be paying so much for a meal, I want the entire package: good food, good service, good ambience.  The only positive thing I could say about the ambience was that it's quiet, which is doubly annoying if the thing I wanted was privacy (no extra noise to drown out our conversation).

And now, onto the food.
Ribeye Steak, $64, medium rare, comes with sauce and no other sides.  Is the concept of having sides (vegetables) along with the entree that foreign in fancy restaurants?  Maybe it's not normal in a French restaurant?  I don't know.  Morel doesn't have sides with your entree.  You can order another side for $9-$12.  We ordered fries (yeah, don't ask why we paid $11 for fries), mac and cheese (we're not the fanciest of people), and this other potato dish.  The potato dish was the best.

The steak itself was the worst cut of ribeye steak I've ever tasted.  The only thing that was good about the steak was that it was medium rare, which surprisingly many places manage to screw up.  The steak was bland, the sauce was tasteless, and even the fatty part of the steak which I usually enjoy regardless of how the rest of the steak tastes was very disappointing.  Worst.  Steak.  Ever.  This also includes the ribeye I got at Chili's.  Yes.

What else can I say about the restaurant?  The waiter didn't seem happy to see that we wanted to move a couple tables away from their immediate zone.  This would be understandable to me, except that with a bill of $240 the tip easily exceeds 4 hours of minimum wage labor.  

The toothpick came in an individual wrapper, and that was nice.

Go to Table 10 instead, or splurge and go to CUT.  Save yourself some time and money.",JAk9ZsDAzZo5FMfEgqj9ZQ,1,0,1,xC1jwjsVRG58X3bCtJkx4Q
2307478,2012-10-18,0,O_C-2kZMHGnq3ZDL_OaG6Q,"Here's the deal, I've been here probably 10 times over the last several years. The service and the food are hit or miss. Its not the people, it is a management problem. This becomes clearer after you get to know they staff, who are very friendly and, I think, are doing their best given the leadership.

Let's start with the negative, the principal issues are food quality and inconsistency. You can have a great steak one week and a marginal steak the next. It could be cooked the way you ordered one week and the next its like you got someone else's order. Too many people service one table, you never know who is in charge because the guy or gal who appears to be your waiter, is on again off again. I think this is because when they are slow, they spread servers too thin. I've had good and bad servers, last night I had Eldifon and he was above average.

On the positive side, they have an expansive wine list covering California, France and  Italy; the values are not there in terms of price, but they have selection. I was there on October 16 and the sommelier was great, he recommended a very good montrachet that was 3.5 times its retail, a little high for an '09. 

Though terribly inconsistent in terms of what they may have from time to time (management not minding the cheese list), they have one of the best cheese lists in Vegas and in the West when its in order. Too boot, they have about 20 bottles on the 'by the glass list' that are good for pairings with the cheese. They could probably do a better job of helping people make decisions, but, again...

This is a diamond in rough shape. I would not do an important meal here, but if you are willing to go through some bumps its not a bad spot to try out. There are certainly worse!",nEfoNXJwplObiJ38zts7IA,4,0,3,iIc5y29QB6bHEfyc95x9XA

We decided that fondue for Christmas sounded perfect, so I made reservations for 7:30 at the Morels at the Palazzo. We arrived at 7:25 and we're told our table would be ready shortly, so we took a seat at the bar and waited...and waited...and waited...until we were finally seated at 8:05. No apology, nothing at all.
The waiter greeted us and brought some bread rolls, he asked if we had been to Morels before and we said we had on several occasions and we told him we were looking forward to the fondue. He asked if we were planning on ordering the fondue and we said yes. He left and said he'd be back. After disappearing for several minutes, I had to flag him down so we could place our drink and food order. We finally ordered our drinks, an order of bruschetta, and the fondue. He told us he'd already placed the order for the fondue. OK. 5 minutes later the fondue arrives...it took another 10 minutes to get our drinks, and still no bruschetta. Now, I love the fondue at Morels, and having grown up in Switzerland I know fondue...this was terrible, it was so bland and flavorless. To make matters worse half way through the meal the flame under the pot went out, and by the time they replaced the base the cheese had now become a cold, hard ball of bland cheese. The bread rolls tasted as if they came straight out of a plastic bag. They did bring us a cheese and an olive spread which was probably the best part of the meal. We were seriously disappointed, and on Christmas it all just seemed even worse. We will absolutely return to Morels at the Grove, but this Vegas Grinch ruined Christmas. In fact, we were so disappointed we skipped dessert...and I LOVE dessert.

This area probably wouldn't have been so bad, but this area also doubled as the smoking section for a family of Russians who decided to come out for a smoke while we were eating...not ""da harasho"" for us. So if this didn't make you feel like you were in the ""minority section"", I guess the lack of space heaters would. Every other table had at least one/two space heaters in the vicinity, but we got ZERO on a slightly nipple chill'n' night. When we asked Roger our server for one, he just responded with an off-the-cuff response that there weren't any space heaters (we're out of propane/not working). This would have been slightly tolerable, if we had just popped in unexpectedly, but we had reservations well in advance because this was for a bachelor party (also our tables and chairs didn't match the rest).

So why did we not get the attentive service we should have? Maybe our party looked young, and they didn't feel as though they had to go the extra distance, but whatever the reason, Roger didn't come through as he should have although I should say he was very professional in managing his ability to hold on to whatever tip he could hope for. Also his other assistant Mano (don't know the spelling) definitely did do a great job because he did most of the work (not a shock he was minority, haha).

I looked up a few restaurants to see who had a seared foie gras on their menu, and I was happily surprised that Morels had it, especially since we were staying at Palazzo. How convenient! I called the restaurant on Thursday to make sure they will have foie gras on Friday and they said yes.

We didn't get in to Vegas 'til really late Friday night, our dinner reservation was at 9:30pm. The moment I sat down and saw the seared foie gras on their menu, I knew I was in for a treat. To my dismay, when I was ready to order, our waiter informs me that they were out! Really?! You're out of foie gras??? He says that they sell so much on a daily basis, especially to Californians. Uh, hello?! That's me!! He went back to the kitchen and confirmed that they were out 'til Monday! Seriously?! The chef did NOT plan the menu accordingly. How can you run out of such a 'hot' item, especially right before a busy weekend? I couldn't believe it. My 4.5hr drive was a waste. My weekend was already off to a bad start. I was devastated.

The cheapest food you can eat is at the Grand Lux Cafe, where the food sucks by the way, and the free drinks you get when you sit at a slot machine. So we were in for a little treat when we sat  down at Morel's French Bistro. 
As soon as you get seated the waiters will pamper you. I personally hate that kind of service, but, we were all tired of gambling and a little babying was not too bad. 
We sat down and the waiters do that napkin thing onto your lap. Then several waiters come out to help you pick your wine (which was unneccesary cuz I'll ALWAYS pick the cheapest bottle n e way) and they wait next to you till you make your decision. 
We started with some soup de jour which was some really buttery bacon-ie ham-ie chowder. It was too buttery for me but good.
Then came the mussels for an appetizer which was pretty good.
I chose the seafood fettucine which the sauce tasted like the soup i had and BAD OYSTERS. I couldn't even taste the lobster or the clams. I already had the mussels so basically i had more soup de jour with pasta.
Then my bro's plate came which was the sirloin cooked medium. And my fiance's plate which was the same cooked medium-well. I had a bite of each and they both tasted GREAT. We had the artichoke side which complimented the large portions of meats. 
The meat dishes were very plain (a big piece of meat plotted on a big plate with no decor) but the taste made up for what was missing. For all the money you'll be spending you'd think they'd put a little more on the plates, eh?
So, i learned the next time i go to a steakhouse, STEAK is what i'll order. GEEZ.
The bill came out to about $250-260? and we left a $100 tip (because of the service and it was around Christmas). So it was worth getting pampered for that amount of cash or was it all PRETENTIOUS???

They start you off with a roll and butter and French music overhead (French Country, the French rock-n-roll, then French Traditional...you get the picture).

We had toast with butter and raspberry jam ($2.50) didn't need it - too much food by end of meal but it was tasty.

I had the Veggie omelet, it comes with mixed greens or potatoes, stick with the greens. Lighter, tasty and hubby had the potatoes - nothing to write hone about. Save the calories for something else. The omelet was around ($15).

My husband had the Chiliquiles with potatoes, around the same price as my omelet - I did not keep my receipt but it was around $50 for lunch.

We ate at this restaurant on 4/17/18. According to the server, the restaurant was unexpectedly packed. We only had two hours to dine before catching a flight out. She was frazzled, but very nice and tried hard to accommodate us.  Service was slow, but we appreciated that she was trying to help, so we made the best of it.  The food was subpar (i.e., couldn't finish the oysters because they weren't fresh)--maybe because they were so busy? Told the waitress, but no offer to make it right.  Again, maybe too busy? 

Halfway through the meal, our main courses hadn't come out and we asked to have it packed up so we could catch our flight. What I haven't mentioned is that the three guys who ordered steaks at the table next to us had complained that their steaks were not cooked according to order. The tables were so close, we couldn't help overhearing.  One guy actually sent back two steaks. He cut into the second steak, saw it was too rare and told the manager to take it back.  Now, here's where our order goes South.  

We get to the airport, ready to dig into our main meal, open the steak and its the exact same one the guy on the next table had--cut right through the same place we saw him cut.  At first, we stared in disbelief. Then, realizing it was $250 later, all we could do was shake our heads. At the very least, this was disgusting and tacky; at most, it violated standard health codes. No excuses.

Word to the wise, this isn't the restaurant you want to dine at if you're looking for a good meal.  But if you find yourself eating there and you have to pack food to go, check your takeout before leaving the place!",TFh9ZzDnyKUuibcsNp8PvA,0,0,1,eFv22tU_cylC2SN9flBcaQ

New York Sirloin 14 oz, Grassfed:  C-   Didn't even pass.  I ordered it medium.  To their credit it was prepared ""medium"" all pink in the middle, but it was TOUGH.  TOUGH.  

Potato Dauphinois:  C+, barely passed.  Nothing like Prime Steakhouse Gratin Dauphinois (NO COMPARISON)

The biggest disappointment, however is when our main dishes arrived at the table. We were a party of four and all of us received our steaks cold. If that wasn't enough, two of our steaks were over cooked. After dinner, we got a few desserts to share for the table, one of which was baked Alaska. If you've ever had baked Alaska, it's not a difficult dessert to make. The baked Alaska was the worst I've ever had. The cake was frozen and they poured way too much 151 on it when the flambe'd it.

I asked for medium rare and I would say the temperature was a bit uneven with the middle rare and the exterior a bit more well.  Seems like an issue with not letting the steak come to temp before cooking or just a by product of uneven heat in the broiler or pan.  Overall the steak was good though and came with a nice salt selection and a side of sauce bordelaise.

2999504,2015-04-16,2,O_C-2kZMHGnq3ZDL_OaG6Q,"Quick Look: Quality restaurant w/ some flaws that need to be addressed by management. One of the best raw seafood bar's in the city. 

In Depth Review: We are local Las Vegas foodies and enjoy the fine restaurants in this city on a regular basis. Had Morel's on my list for a long time. Finally had a chance to experience it on a Thursday night in April of 2015. It was my ladies birthday and we wanted Oysters/Shell-Fish. We found Morel's by doing some research online. We made a reservation for 8:30pm. Requested a private booth. When we arrived the booths were full and we were advised to grab a drink at the bar. We were OK with that. 

Here is where we ran into major issue #1 - 

Went to the bar and ordered two Hendrinks gin and tonics w/ lime.  We were informed they were out of Hendrinks (and all top shelf gins). We thought the barkeep was joking. He informed us that they had a private event a few nights earlier, said they were gin drinkers & cleared them out. Shocked by this response as I know that most quality Vegas establishments will restock quickly after such an event. In addition, they can always borrow from another bar/restaurant they have a relationship with inside the hotel. Finally, they can borrow from the massive inventory the hotel keeps on hand at all times. 

The bartender was named Brandon and he was very nice and friendly. He made some great suggestions for alternative drinks. We were bummed that we could not enjoy some quality gin drinks with our food, but he made us feel better about the situation. In addition, he poured us some complimentary birthday glasses of Champagne in honor of my wife's birthday. Classy touch. He's a great asset to this restaurant. 


After a 20 minute wait past our reservation time we were brought to our booth. The restaurant was 60% filled. It was a clean and nice room. Great sight-lines, minimalistic decor (typical French restaurant). Only advice would be to turn the lights down a few notches, it was too bright in the room to create an intimate atmosphere. 

Our server identified himself and was super attentive. He knew the menu inside and out and made some killer recommendations. 

We ordered the ""PETIT PLATEAU DE MER,"" which translate into petite platter of seafood. It consisted of 4 Shrimp, 6 Oysters, Octopus Ceviche &  1/2 Dungeness Crab. The cost was $60. Well worth it for the freshness we received. It was delicious. I will go out on a limb and say this was one of the freshest raw seafood platters in Vegas. I highly suggest you order this if you go to Morels.

For our appetizer we ordered ""CHEF'S PRIME BEEF TENDERLOIN TARTARE."" It consisted of Quail Egg, Truffled & Potato Chips. It was unique. I could taste some fancy homemade ketchup in the mix. My wife though it had a Chipotle flavor. The server confirmed that they do indeed use a homemade ketchup and mustard when preparing it. It was wet and sticky in texture, not your typical beef tartare. With that said, we enjoyed it. 

For our entrees we ordered the Colorado Rack of Lamb ($52) and the 18 Hour Braised Short Rib ($37). As a side we ordered the steamed asparagus ($10). The short rib entree was decent. The meat was a bit dry and over cooked. I have tasted better, for far less money. I did enjoy the fresh bacon pieces on the plate. The Colorado rack of Lamb was good. My wife mentioned it was in the same category as the rack of lamb at every other god restaurant in the city. But at $52 it was higher priced than than those other restaurants. You would expect to have a superior cut and plate at that price point. The asparagus was as expected, tasted good. Think both entrees were also good, just not amazing. 

Here is another area of opportunity for the management to improve upon. Clean up and fix your confusing wine list. It was on white printed computer paper, hole punched and put in a cheap binder. The first three pages were dirty and had been torn from the rings of the binder. The wine list was almost impossible to read. Not sure who designed this, or who approved it's use? It's not a quality look at all. I will attach some pics so you can address it. We were ordering $20+ glasses of wine from a menu that looked like something you would find at the local diner. 

We ordered the ice cream as a desert. It was a delicious ending. They put a candle in the desert for her birthday. Nice touch. 


In summary: We spent almost $400 for a birthday dinner experience at a fine dining restaurant. The service was fantastic. The raw shell fish platter was superb. Unfortunately the entrees were mediocre. The wine list confusing. The bar not fully stocked. Not the 5 star experience we had hoped / paid for. Few tweaks and Morel's can be a top contender.",yuoaisepxm6QaBKiBxz6AA,2,1,3,ClgV6ztgHFVOvC-ltvU-YA

Palazzo is a beautiful hotel in the heart of the strip, and Morels is the perfect restaurant there.  Its decor is sexy and chique, using black and white with hints of wine, and very sexy paintings on the main wall.  As we entered the restaurant we were greeted by two lovely ladies who sat us indoors near the windows.  

Our server was more than helpful, and as usual I asked for suggestions for lunch.  He brought out the dinner menu because their steaks are always available, and I went with their 100% Kansas raised bone in new york, medium.  For starters we had a charcuterie of  proscuitto and salami, complimented with 3 types of cheeses: a blue cheese blend of goat and sheep milk, as well as a brie and capricorn.  It arrived with some walnut cake slices, fresh honey comb, walnut spread, as well as a mini baguette sliced to eat, grain mustard, mini pickles and pickled onions.  All of it was savory, beautiful, and incredibly wonderful to eat.  With the steaks we ordered mushrooms sauteed in truffle butter, along with pomme frites with an out of this world truffle mayonnaise made in house.

All of the food was heavenly.  First, the cured meat was freshly sliced nearby, and we watched the chef slice it deli thin along with the cheeses.  He was meticulous with the plating despite it being a casual appetizer.  The cheeses were fabulous.  I am not a blue cheese person, but I will eat that blue cheese we ordered every single day if I could afford it.  The honey comb along with the walnut cake was amazing, as was the other two cheeses we ordered.  

As for the steaks--I couldn't be happier.  The carry over made the steak the perfect medium that I desired.  With nothing but salt and black pepper to season, as well as a teaspoon of herb butter on top, it was thick, juicy, and worth every penny.  The side dishes weren't just side dishes--they were meals in themselves!  Mushrooms were just the right texture and seasoned well, and the pomme frites were the best I've had in Vegas.  I love a good fry, but when you add a dipping sauce like a truffle mayo that they make, it's to die for.  I wanted to smother it on everything.  I could taste the hint of lemon zest and black pepper as well.  It was fantastic.

We ended the lunch with their signature souffle.  I've had one before at Wolfgang Puck's, and it was fair. This, however, was incredible.  Soft, fluffy and light as it should be, the dessert itself wasn't overpowering and because they used premium cocoa, the sweetness was well balanced.  Their vanilla bean sauce was so good.  I wanted to lick the plate when I was done.

Overall, a great meal at under 200 dollars.  Well worth the price tag.  In Vegas, it's easy to spend a lot of money at a restaurant that serves mediocre food.  Morels, however, is worth every penny.

Make the trip.  It's worth the time.",o68A_3bAJTge-ioGXHdxKA,5,1,5,BZ_z1oGM63h4EuFauen5gw

All i can say is that I was really disappointed and ended up feeling a little sick for the rest of the night.  We called in advance to see if they could do something special for her birthday (like a dessert, etc. that said Happy Birthday) and they immediately told us that they didn't comp any desserts but that they could do something on a dessert we chose (which we agreed to).  

The service was a worse than what I had expected and the food was definitely worse than expected.  3 of us ordered the salmon and my other friend and I ordered the short rib.  I heard the salmon was a little undercooked and underwhelming.  The short rib was a huge disappointment - it was very dry and while it was tender, it didn't really go down very well.  I even had to ask for more sauce in hopes of ameliorating the situation, but the sauce didn't help that much.  The mac and cheese was delicious - maybe the best part of my meal.

We ordered two desserts to share all around and we even went to remind our waiter to do write happy birthday on at least one of the desserts and we were assured that they were taking care of it.  The two desserts came and none of them had any writing on it.  Then after we were eating for 5 minutes, a third dessert came out with a candle.  It was a pistachio souffle and we were all surprised at how nice it looked.  Until the bill came and they ended up charging us for it even though we didn't order it.

The bill ended up coming out late and after we wrote clear instructions on how to split the bill four ways, there was a lot of confusion and it was clear that they ran our cards a couple of times before figuring out exactly how to charge a specific amount.

We were just at Bouchon the day before this breakfast... granted we hit the peak of lunch time and our waitress was super nice in trying to salvage the deal, but I now believe Bourdain in his comment of ""high class fast food for a price"". Of course after that disappointment I was almost hesitant to shell out some more cash just to be deceived by the glitz and glam of Las Vegas strip restaurants.   But ok, I couldn't help it. The organic eggs and sides woke me up and dragged my two limbs downstairs to fill my empty stomach.   

Came in and the hostess seemed unorganized, but it did take her only five minutes to get our party of five in a comfortable round table In the middle of restaurant.  Decor was very modern and almost sensual in a good way.   I can see how the colors, and the moldings would work beautifully at night with dim lights and not so dragging with a hangover look during the daytime.   Our waiter was great and knowledgeable to a degree.   Coffee selection, I would almost say limited... but then maybe I'd have to correct myself on that one.  It was actually a well chosen selection of the average and exotic brew or should I say press.  Our waiter suggested Rwanda on a French press and it was definitely a cup worth waking up earlier than high noon in sin city.   I thought my order was good, I opted for the crab benedict which was prepared clean and tasty as expected.   But from the whole meal, one thing that was unforgettable was the side of organic ham. Oh that tiny bite of organic ham... I'd like to order a whole hind of it and make it my pillow.   That was by far the juiciest ham I've ever tasted.   That ham will take out your Grandma's holiday ham anytime. Yes, that's right, I'm talking sh$t about your Grandma's dry, chewy and overly sauced ham.   Morels may have to share their secret with me here, becuase that one was perfect. It was salty, sweet, juicy, plump, not chewy, and seared properly on all sides.
 
And so, I can say that Morels offered me and my party a true hearty breakfast.   I just wish for next time they can deliver me a breakfast in bed.  Hey, it is Vegas...  you never know.",4gJ5kLvlsdlkKnKIDruBgw,0,0,5,sk9OHIp8GPfu0WpOL-snBQ

Unfortunately, the rest of the meals were sub-standard.  One of the other steaks was also ordered medium rare and was sent back since it was overcooked (it arrived warm/hot pink in the middle).  And then we waited. And waited.  Our waiter showed up (amazing!) and told us it was coming.  And then we waited some more.  Then the manager showed up and told us it was coming.  And then it showed up a minute later.  All said and done, almost 30 minutes passed between when the first steak was sent back and the second one was delivered.  

Not only does that make it awkward with the rest of our party eating, it also ruins the ambience of the table and is quite frankly unacceptable.  I wish I could say that they got it right but the second steak was worse than the first one.  It was essentially raw (read: cold and red throughout the steak except the far edges) and could only have been thrown on the grill for 30 - 40 seconds at best.  By this point, we had all finished eating and didn't want to continue the ordeal.  

But wait...here's the best part.  They charged us for that steak and when we asked that it be taken off the bill we were told no...your steak was cooked to perfection. 

Sorry guys but no it wasn't.  When you can compare one medium rare steak to another one and visibly see the difference, it's not cooked to perfection.  While restaurants define medium rare slightly different, a quick web search of the definition of a medium rare steak shows the following:

""A medium rare steak should be warm through the middle with a hint of red. Most of the center of the steak should be pink. The sides should be well browned, the top and bottom charred to a dark brown color. This steak should have a firm surface but soft in the middle.""

It's not supposed to be COLD and RAW in the middle.

Restaurants are about more than the food.  The ambiance, the attentiveness of the servers and the attitude of the management all factor in.  
 
Good customer service means working w/ your customers to resolve a problem when it arises.  For a $60 steak they ruined what should have been a pleasant meal and the manager's behavior was beyond unacceptable.  Their refusal to even discuss the poor service and food left all of us appalled. 

Oh yeah, and they don't do anything special for birthdays (like a cake or dessert).  

Never. Going. Back.

I have had lunch and dinner at this facility several times. We normally eat on the outside patio and try and time it so that we can watch the pirate show happening at the Treasure Island.

Whether it is lunch time or dinner time, I have always ordered the following items:
1. Dozen Oysters on the half shell
2. Some potatoes
3. Bone-in Steak (Sometimes during the lunch hour they did not offer it on the menu however they accommodated me)
4. Bottle of Merlot and in most cases the Duckhorn

The Oysters (West and East Coast) were always fresh with virtually no odor and tasted very very good. They turned this appetizer around very fast. The Steak is always cooked to perfection and is very flavorful. You put all this together with a bottle of Merlot and you got yourself a delightful evening.

The staff is always knowledgeable and very courteous. At times months would go by before I visit there again however they have always remembered me.",m7H3pTs9yaaY3R9ML98X4g,1,1,4,hyf1k61kf1uuS9eWKswHWA

Service was meh, we were seated 15 minutes after our reservation which was odd since the place was NOT BUSY and simple things like water and lemons were hard to negotiate. Consistent with other reviews was the sheer lack of options for seafood. But with a good size group, there were plenty of dishes to comment on:

1. Calamari Appetizer: @$24 this plate was small, really small, but there was plenty left on the plate when we were done because it was room temperature, dry, and chewy. We should have sent it back but we were too busy sending back mains...
2. Chicken was served raw, and not ""pink"" or undercooked, it was simply raw in the center. Stomach turning.
3. On the flip side, the grass fed NY strip was ordered medium rare, but came out well-well done. 

We ordered several other dishes, but they were totally forgettable. 

Memorable comment was:

""I would send this back if I were at Long John Silver's, but this place won't make it better if they do it again.""

I'll start with the good stuff first. Decor of the restaurant is absolutely beautiful.  I have dined here twice; once for brunch and once for dinner. In the morning the restaurant is so nice and bright. You can't tell from the entrance of the restaurant, but they have huge windows inside that brings in so much light into the restaurant.  Which is a nice change from being inside casinos all day!  They also have patio seating as well that looks out to Las Vegas blvd and treasure island. Service was great(one of the reasons I gave them three starts, not one).  

The bad. FOOD. So for brunch, my particular dish was half good half bad. The potatoes that were on the side were the worst.  It basically felt like they were premade earlier that day and sat around and once ordered, they were scooped and came delivered out to my dish.  They did not seem fresh at all. They were not hot.  They were cold and stale. The rest of my dish however was delicious. Now for dinner, I had the exact experience. My food just didn't seem hot or fresh. I had this crab appetizer that came with bread. And boy that bread looked toasted with butter. But once you took a bite into it... you regretted it instantly. It was so stale and not even warm!  That's when I came to the conclusion that they pre made some items on the menu and it just sits around. 

I would skip this place and just trek over to Bouchon in the Venezia tower. Sad to say since they have a great location. Right in the entrance of the palazzo. Not far from taxi and Las Vegas blvd.",iMXBMup0pYKaFeMTTNSDWg,0,0,3,DuhQG7Ak1icvgM0X9p6InQ

The crab benedict was a delight to look at.  The taste was also pretty good.  Fresh crabs, a delightful citrus hollandaise.  However, the poached egg was cooked solid.

4ish stars for food/atmosphere/etc.
5 stars for service

Full disclosure: this was the ""let us make it up to you meal.""  Constantin, the new general manager, saw my review on Yelp and contacted me to apologize for my terrible experience (the first true apology I received, mind you) and wanted us to come back so he could make it up to us and show us how Morels has changed.  He seemed very earnest and I'm fairly open minded, so off to Morels we were!

Constantin came right over after we were seated to say hello and thank us for trying them out again.  He briefly explained the menu he had planned for us and introduced Matt, our server.  Honestly, Matt seemed a bit nervous at first; I think he was concerned that we were super snotty or something, but after we chatted him up, he calmed down quite a bit and opened up a lot.  He was a good server and a cool guy! 

On to the food:
Amuse Bouche: Fresh Crab Salad on a homemade truffle potato chip.  Crab was excellent and the mixes of textures and salty/savory was great!
Oysters: Yummy Kumamotos; super good, as would be expected.

(There are wine/champagne pairings in here, but I dont recall what they were; they matched wonderfully though!)

Appetizer: Chef's Prime Beef Tenderloin Tartar: omg so good!  The quail egg and truffle chips were an excellent complement to the quality beef. I normally wouldn't order beef tartar, but I would order this again!
Iron Cast Roasted Branzino: I was very impressed with this dish.  I'm not a huge cooked fish person, but I recently tried the branzino at Angelini Osteria in Los Angeles.  Angelini is a favorite of mine but I only tried the fish because Wolfgang Puck praised it on Best Thing I Ever Ate.  It was alright.  The branzino here at Morels was so good; cooked perfectly, nicely moist, and served with a nice beurre blanc.  
Petite Cut Filet: Pretty good.  I enjoyed the quality of the meat and the preparation.  There is an interesting cumin-based rub they use that might scare off some diners; I liked it but it did overpower some bites for sure.

Our favorite cheesemonger, Jake (who is now a server) came by to see if we had any preferences and proceeded to hook us up with some amazing cheese.  Matt then had the gall to bring us dessert!!! I can't recall the name but it had some fresh fruit and a meringue mixture.  I'm not doing it justice, but it was a nice bite or so. I was far too full!

Before he left for the night, Constantin came to check on us one more time.  He was the consummate gentleman and totally made up for our previous experience.  While I 100% stand by my previous review, I'm sorry that we experienced Morels at such a down point (with the previous manager) and thought so poorly of the restaurant for so long.  Thanks Matt for being a great server! And, thank you to Constantin for having faith in us as customers to know good service and food when we see it.  

We're very excited to go back!",-lh59ko3dxChBSZ9U7LfUw,10,7,5,EojyAygyHoOK_xXfiA4ojw

We walked in around 11 a.m. on Saturday morning.  It was quiet.  We were seated right away and waited on - meticulously - by three people throughout brunch.  We were three women and the gentlemen waiters were helpful, polite and prompt.

The brunch menu looked divine, but I'm a sucker for cheese.  I was impressed by the selection of cheeses and charcuterie.  I talked my friends into having cheese fondue with me.  Yes, for brunch.  So there.

The fondue arrived and was the perfect balance of wine and cheese.  Neither was too strong.  It was a symphony of taste that I never wanted to end.  The bread was crusty and soft, fresh and fragrant.  SO GOOD.

The coffee was strong - a fair trade Rwandan blend - and I loved it.

Then we shared the fries with the seasoned mayonnaise (divine!), a plate of saucisson (a dry salame thing made in France, that I love) and a smoked salmon flat bread.  The saucisson was sliced wafer thin and served with more yummy bread, sweet cornichons, pearl onions and a fancy, stone-ground mustard.  My tummy was full and my heart was singing in tune with my taste buds.

Great atmosphere, comfy chairs, right on the strip with indoor (what we opted for) and outdoor seating.

Check this place out.  I *will* try their dinner menu on a future trip to Vegas... but I am craving their spectacular brunch.  And, next time, I *will* sample something off the delightful Bloody Mary cart.",ZXJ80SFdNBIIoKyTYHZ-Xg,4,0,5,vsRDQ2q-cfBAVV3E_dkG6A

Saying that this meal was amazing is an understatement. I received some excellent recommendations from the waiter for what cheeses were best. I was not disappointed! These cheeses were nothing like I've ever tasted before. The prosciutto was heavenly as well. It was quite an experience! My boyfriend and I were talking about our 'Cheese Date' for the rest of the night. Highly suggested for foodies that love cheese!

My one complaint (This ALMOST brought it down to a 4) was that we made reservations for 4pm (Only 2 people), but they were not able to seat us until at least 4:30. What?",n5kvsYIIPUVrARu0pkaazQ,1,0,5,A5at4u23WmQ5yBhZ6Igfgg
3394733,2016-08-22,0,O_C-2kZMHGnq3ZDL_OaG6Q,"Let's put it this way: we like this place so much we ate here twice during our last trip. With all the restaurants to choose from in town, that should say something!

We've eaten breakfast, brunch, lunch and dinner here on various trips and have never had a bad meal. The waitstaff is also excellent. Attentive, accurate and if you get Tito or Sal, funny as well!

Some general notes:
Breakfast - skip the Bloody Mary cart unless you have a special request. The bartender can crank one out that is just as good in half the time. This last trip I tried the Turkey Hash - diced turkey, potatoes, sliced jalapenos, grilled brussels sprouts topped with a sunny side up egg, served in a sizzling hot cast iron pan. To die for! The wife's fruit plate had excellent selections of perfectly ripe fruit and melon. The omelets are huge and stuffed with all sorts of goodness.

Lunch - Good burgers, good steaks, great service.

Dinner - If you get the chance, try the Tasting Menu when it's offered. The steak tartare is quite possibly the best I've ever had. The steaks are great, the short rib transcendent. You really can't go wrong with anything on the menu.

We were bummed when Society Cafe closed next door at Encore, but Morel's more than makes up for that loss. Excellent bar and good wine selection as well.",AaCUrnB9ma-ZhytPj3Fh1Q,1,1,5,LXNEj9WgmpWeEdbpD04wxg

We also tried the truffle Mac and cheese and I thought it was not good at all. The rib eye was very tender and yummy. But the sides all come a la carte and the $10 mashed potatoes my husband ordered tasted like pre made microwave food! The wait staff was extremely friendly and willing to accommodate us.

3455250,2013-08-14,1,O_C-2kZMHGnq3ZDL_OaG6Q,"Well, we should've gone to Bouchon. 

I met up with a friend at Morels for breakfast. Lately, we've been on a French food kick and have been breakfasting at various French restaurants; Morels was next on our list. Essentially, it's a 2-Star dining establishment that can be ranked alongside Denny's and Ihop. I'm not insulting those establishments, but why would anyone pay good money for that kind of food? If I wanted Denny's, I would've gone there. The food was definitely not worth the caloric intake and the cash withdrawal from my wallet, but at least Morels will never receive business from me again.

Market Fresh Seasonal Fruit ($11): ""Market Fresh"", yeah right, far from it. The plate consisted of a mix of melons, several pineapple slices, a SINGLE strawberry that was sliced up for us to share, and some random blueberries for ""garnish."" In the center of the plate was a bowl of plain yogurt. We also received some honeycomb that was less than a teaspoon.

Free Range Egg Crab Omelette ($19): I chose this over the Croque Madame, which I originally wanted to try; however, I can't say if sticking to my original decision would've changed my experience. The omelette comes with a choice of either a house salad or Country Breakfast Potatoes. I'm not exaggerating when I say that my entire meal was bland. I even had my friend try some of my food to make sure my taste buds were functioning. Both my potatoes and omelette desperately needed seasoning. I don't like adding salt and pepper to the food that I order, but this could've been the first restaurant meal where I was about to do so, except we didn't have any salt and pepper on our table. I did request some Dijon mustard. That somewhat added some life to my meal, but Dijon wasn't suited for it. On a positive note: there was real crab meat in my omelette. 

Crab Eggs Benedict ($20) This was what my friend ordered. The presentation of her dish almost made me regret having ordered my omelette, but it was all looks. Her order was also flavorless and lacked seasoning. 

Costa Rican Pressed Coffee ($5): Decent for being a $5 cup 'o joe. It's robust and had more flavor than what I ate.

The service is in need of improvement, and it isn't up to the quality I'd expect from a dining establishment at The Palazzo. We should've considered the chair with the hole in its back, and the awkwardness of the service staff -- specifically, the busser, who lurked around our table.

Lastly, if you make an Open Table reservation, double check that you're awarded your dining points. Morels failed to add 100 points to my account. 

I said it in the beginning of this review, and I'll say it again: We should've gone to Bouchon.",epkRB3J_oBEiyiwahvdmGg,6,4,2,lq6MqEjBCkW283oQyCSAUA

I think the bartender was doing double duty as the server, which meant we got our food when there was a lull at the bar.  Lunch literally took an hour and a half, and we didn't receive all the food we ordered. Which was a good thing because we were so satisfied with what did come that there was not room for the additional items.

I went on a business dinner with 7 associates, and found the steaks to be good, but very pricey, the wine list very overpriced, and the appetizers and add-ons a complete rip off.

But the kicker was we ordered a large lobster  (at nearly $150) for the table to share.  After we'd eaten through a bit of it, we found that one of the claws, about 30% of the overall meat, was totally undercooked - to the point of being raw.  Their flip response - how about we toss that opened claw back on the grill for you.

That's terrible service - and not how you should treat a table that's bringing you a $200 a head spot of business.

The menu is extensive with something for everyone from vegan options to filet mignon. I usually order a steak or their chicken and waffles which are both amazing. Although the steak could've had a bit more seasoning this time, the service is always exquisite enough to come back for.

The Serbian waitress we had was attentive despite having a table of 20 plus to service as well. The table had asked for more umbrellas for shade and she moved 6 all by herself. It speaks to the level of dedication she has for her tables since not one of her coworkers came by to assist much to our dismay.  She kept the drinks coming and had our water cups always filled.

We had a full tasting menu with wine which gave us a much broader view of what Morels had to offer. Some of the highlights were the Chef's Prime Beef Tenderloin Tartar and the Roasted Branzino. I love quail eggs and paired with the truffle chips the beef just popped with flavor.  The Branzino was cooked perfectly. It was moist and had multiple layers of flavor with the skin intact. Of course the oysters and cheese selection is second to none. Both were great again and I would go back for that alone. 

Our service was much improved and again it felt like a completely different experience than before. I love to see a place take our experiences and reviews seriously. If more restaurants took the lead like the new general manager they would truly start to understand their customers.

3519847,2017-12-30,42,O_C-2kZMHGnq3ZDL_OaG6Q,"I've been coming to Morel's since it first opened and with all that comes and goes in this town this restaurant is still striving for a good reason. I usually like dining on the outdoor patio, but it was a bit chilly on my last visit, so we sat inside. I made a reservation for a party of 10 and the restaurant had a nice table set for us to enjoy brunch. We were checked on often and the server was great about splitting checks. 

I started out with some French Press Coffee that was enjoyable. The coffee would have paired great with the complimentary beignets sprinkled in a good amount of cinnamon and sugar that they brought to the table, but they were chewy and not hot. Bummer. 

Onion Soup Gratinee ($10) - This soup shouldn't be passed up! It was cheesy and rich with flavor. Perfect way to start you meal or even a nice lunch on a cold day. 

Banana and Mascarpone Stuffed French Toast ($16) - I'm so glad I ordered this because it was excellent! Others that tried some at my table loved it and said they would come back just for this. I'd have to agree. The outside of the french toast had this delicious crunch of cinnamon flavor. On the top was a decent amount of tasty bananas, the syrup was very good and the inside had the perfect amount of yummy filling. I also added a side of bacon for $6, I think it was 5 pieces, and it was thick and very good.

Imported Mushroom Soufflé ($15) - Egg whites, morels, gruyere and sauce mornay with a side salad. Flowing high above the ramekin, this was one tasty dish. I'd definitely recommend the french toast and this dish for breakfast or brunch. 

French Dip with Au Jus ($17) - Sliced prime rib, emmental cheese, caramelized onion and horseradish cream served with a side of fries. This is what my hubby ordered and he asked that the horseradish cream be left off which wasn't a problem. The sandwich could have been a smidge bigger, but wow that prime rib had such good flavor! Fries were also good. 

Almost Famous Mac and Cheese ($10) - This was cheesy, creamy and the portion was big. Can't say I'd want this as my main meal, but it works as a shared side dish. 

Baked Alaska - I'm not sure what this cost because my friend and fellow yelper, Jessica P. was thoughtful enough to treat our table to this dessert. I have to say it was comical when we all had our cameras ready for when this dessert was brought out and lit, but it was one failed attempt after another. Let me tell you a lot of rum was poured on the meringue before we finally had some flame action going on. The dessert was good, but there was definitely a strong taste of rum in each and every bite and while that usually shouldn't be a problem wanting more alcohol in certain things, it was a bit much on this dessert. 

During brunch they have bottomless mimosas for $25 and a handcrafted ""bloody"" cart where for $17 you can have a Bloody Mary or Maria handcrafted table-side. Definitely a solid brunch, lunch or dinner spot. Morel's is located inside The Palazzo.",Fv0e9RIV9jw5TX3ctA1WbA,67,63,4,ZjqA4Po-fxw0kzXVCMyTSQ

Well, we were still sitting there at 7:30 waiting for our food and it wasn't like we ordered a lot of appetizers or salads to start.  Tables that came in after us were done before us and granted we had a party of 10, but if you can't handle that large of a table, don't offer them!

Our server was also possibly new, but was enthusiastic and was trying his best. We were confused when asking for recommendations and had 2 different servers give completely different reviews of what is on the menu.  We also  noticed a lot of staff just standing around, so it appears that maybe part of the problem is management.

The ""family size"" sides are very small, certainly not large enough for more than 3-4 people to share. The food was just okay so for the amount of money we were spending we've definitely had better!  We had reservations to see a show at 8:30 thinking we would have plenty of time so we ended up eating as fast as possible and running out to get a cab.

Oh well, next time I won't make the same mistake. 

I did have a seat out on the patio, which was nice on a beautiful March Vegas day, but the view doesn't compare to that of Mon Ami Gabi (the French steak house at the Paris), although it does offer a glimpse of the strip. I had some time, so I didn't mind waiting a long time for my meal, but it took them forever even to bring me my coffee, which I desperately needed, and which ended up being the highlight of the meal: Strong, delicious and French press brewed. They bring complimentary beignets, which is nice, but these were cold, and nothing to write home about. I had the banana and mascarpone stuffed french toast.

After emailing the manager of the restaurant (which is really rare for me) they got back with me and offered to take care of me the next time I was there.

Fast forward 9 months and we came here again upon staying nearby.  This time around the service was great and we were both happier with the food.  We got bottomless mimosas, french onion soup, my girlfriend got the BBQ burger and I got the flat iron steak & fries.  

The prices seem like they are all over the board.  For example crepes with strawberry, chocolate, and banana are only $11, but onion soup is $10.  You can't order a single mimosa, but the bottomless mimosas are $25.  

Anyway, regarding the food, I'll note we were there for weekend brunch and were given complimentary fresh fried dount type things.  I can't recall the name but they were pretty good.  The onion soup was very good.  Good amount of bread and cheese in it and my girlfriend who doesn't like onions and had never really tried onion soup before enjoyed it greatly.  

My girlfriend's said her burger was OK, but again here we ran into the same problem as with time before.  We are both picky about ingredients and when I got the french dip months ago it had spinach on it, which was not listed on the menu and which I don't like.  This time with the burger it had tomatoes on it but my girlfriend doesn't like tomatoes.  You may think it's totally normal not to list things like tomatoes and lettuce for burgers and I agree, but they DID list lettuce as an ingredient on the menu.  Whatever...

My steak was decent.  I usually don't like fatty steaks and it was fatty, but it was good.  The only bad thing was that the steak was really devoid of seasoning.  I've never salted a steak but I had to add salt to this one.  As for the fries, we both agreed they were fresh, but were also lacking seasoning.  

Long story short, we like the food quality but don't care for the seasoning (or lack thereof).  The prices vary from appropriate to a little high but at least this time the service was good.  We may come back again, but I think my girlfriend will go back to crepes, which she liked the first time, and I'll try something new.",ykWNHp1RXcmx6PYH921UrQ,0,0,3,lv2DwyMML7QUy2I4LmHPuA

But I'll start by saying, my steak was nicely marbled, and cooked properly, their fries were very nice as well, and the salad was lightly tossed in a vinaigrette and not overly drenched in the stuff.  Service, while pleasant, resistant to the idea that, I don't want fucking potato salad with this cut of meat, I would like fries... Don't ASK the chef, tell him that's what I would prefer - and he'll do it regardless of how much he hates the idea.  So, based on all of the above, I'd have given them 3 stars.

BUT

Firstly: They have, what might possibly the best cheese selection in Vegas.  My doctor hates and loves this place for me... I'm turning 30 soon, and he tells me I should take in more calcium in my diet to help my bones finish their structure properly.  Most people drink milk - I eat ooey, gooey, smelly, stinky cheese to fulfill this request of his.  Unfortunately, it's going to give me high cholesterol when I finally get the blood test he's been asking me to get for the past 3 years.

Secondly:  They have a fantastic beer selection.  I've been to quite a few places in Vegas, but this place seems to have the best selection in beer. AND they don't have Bud Light on the menu THANK GOD - A serious beer menu for a serious beer drinker.

We were all very hungover and we're dying for a good cure in brunch but unfortunately, we left with something to be desired.  We all got different things and everyone had complaints about their food.  A couple people received the wrong orders and everyone's food was less than ""yum"".  People who ordered medium rare burgers got well done on stale looking broiche.  The ""most popular brunch item""- the crab omelette, was dry and tasteless.  My turkey club sandwich required a bunch of salt, pepper, and ketchup because it was completely void of all flavor.  Also, it was supposed to come with avocado which was missing when I got it- when I pointed it out to the waitress, she left and while I thought she was getting me a new sandwich, she was actually just getting me half an avocado instead.  Glad I paid $15 for a bland sandwich with ingredients on the side so I could make it myself.  But not gonna lie- I squeezed my iced tea lemon on the avocado and added some salt to it and that ended up being the tastiest part of my whole meal.  And the fries were good too but I'm not sure how you could really go wrong with fries anyway.  

Then there was the service.  We were stuck paying an 18% gratuity due to the size of our group but that's certainly not the type of service we received.  Considering this is a fairly nice restaurant and food wasn't cheap, I thought service would be better.  The waitress was clearly over us and annoyed. Our tab was off by $80 and it was taking awhile for us to figure it out and that irked her too.  Yes we were there for a couple hours but the restaurant was almost empty so what did it matter?

Two of us Ordered 2 ""specials"" which were filet mignon Oscar style - medium rare. Inconsistency is in this kitchen's name. These guys don't even salt their protein!!! Aside from the fact that the outside of the steaks were over charred, almost to the point of burnt, one of the steaks was raw inside, while the other was just fine. The manager wouldn't even take it off the bill, he wouldn't even come out to talk to us about the bill. All he said was ""I'm sorry for the sashimi, I'll have them cook it more thoroughly."" To my surprise he had them cook the raw pieces rather than re-fire a steak from scratch. Needless to say that re-fired steak was not eaten, as it was over the desired doneness.

The hollandaise sauce that came with it, was metallic tasting, good thing they left it on the side, and it was all crusted over like it had been sitting there for a while.

I ordered the swordfish, it was cooked right, but was missing seasoning - can someone say 'salt and pepper'

The only good dish was the sea bass. It was cooked right, and the broth that it was in was delicious. We also had a creme brûlée, and that was actually pretty good.

I didn't want to cause a scene with not having one of the filets taken off the bill, so we just left.

I had high hopes for a great steak dinner at Morels, given that this very upscale restaurant is located in the fairly new and decidedly fancy Palazzo.  A few years ago I had one of the best restaurant steaks ever at Delmonico in Palazzo's little-sister hotel the Venetian, so I think it's reasonable to expect even better quality from the higher-end hotel.  Unfortunately, in my case the experience fell well short of my expectations.

We were seated quickly at around 7pm, at which time the dining room was relatively empty and a large crew of servers stood at the ready.  The room itself is fairly low-key and classy, with interesting art hanging on the otherwise plain walls.  I like the decor, but I wouldn't mind seeing a bit more design effort.  The front part of the restaurant where you come in features what looks like an oyster bar with a dark wood theme, and I wish they had carried that aesthetic throughout the rest of the dining room.  As it stands, you'll spend your evening staring at relatively unadorned light blue and white walls and large view windows facing the Strip.

Our waiter was quite chatty and informative, giving plenty of suggestions and lots of insight into Morels' impressive cheese and oyster menus.  My buddies and I were in fact very satisfied with the cheese and oyster plates that we ended up ordering as appetizers.

Morels also offers an extensive wine list, with a varied selection of wine styles spread across a wide range of price points.  However, one thing that bugged me just a little bit was the nature of their wine service.  Morels keeps a sommelier in their employ, but this person doesn't bring out the wine list to help you make your selection.  Instead, you choose your bottle, and then the sommelier appears with the bottle and pours it for you.  When your glass gets low, he swings by your table and tops you off.  Now I'm all for sommeliers, but wouldn't it be better if he showed up earlier and guided you through the wine list, helping you make a pairing based on the food you order?  I'm a wine novice so I certainly would have appreciated the help.  As I said, not a huge complaint, just kind of odd.

So onto the entrees, and here is where most of the stars got deducted.  First of all, the food took a while to show up.  Of course, this is pretty typical for a fancy restaurant, but by the time our wait started to feel long, the room hadn't really filled up yet.  That said, I am generally willing to give the kitchen staff the benefit of the doubt.

When our sides failed to arrive with our steaks, and none of the many servers carrying the steaks acknowledged that we had even ordered sides, my mild lack of enthusiasm turned to full-on disappointment.  We tried to wait out the 10 or 15 minutes as our sides were hurriedly prepared and brought out; they turned out to be pretty decent.  The steaks, however, were really, really average.  They were cooked to temperature and had nice marbling, but they tasted plain and unseasoned, with hardly a trace of that meaty flavor that a $50 dry-aged steak ought to have.  It was the first time in many Vegas steakhouse trips that I contemplated using the dipping sauces.  To cap off the meal, I ordered my customary espresso for dessert and it turned out pretty poorly; all evidence pointed to old coffee beans.

All in all, the dining experience was mildly enjoyable, but heavily marred by the deeply unimpressive entree.  For the same price, I've had much, much better experiences (and steaks) at Cut, Mesa, and Delmonico.  Sorry, Morels.",mytkOxFAZst4F0_WtsHp-A,2,0,2,66bc-p7kAwZV2FoAwjyguA

Sometimes, the food makes up for the ambiance.  In this case, it did not.  The bread used for the croque madame had a strange consistency to it (lumpy) and the quiche lorraine tasted a bit too custard-like. The Honduran coffee, lobster mac and cheese, and skirt steak and eggs were (just) okay, but I was aiming a bit higher than what Morel's achieved.

About a third through my steak, which was medium rare-rare, I found what looked to be a numbered tag or label - similar to what you would get if you ordered food and had to wait - at the bottom of my dish, drenched in steak jus and all. They were decent enough to waive the bill, offered to replace my meal, and asked if there was anything they could offer me to drink, but by that point I'd lost all appetite and just wanted to get out of there.

The patio was a bit loud due to the TI Sirens show going on, and our table was small, but it was nice to be outdoors right on the strip.  Three of us started with the shrimp cocktail appetizer, which was four huge, delicious shrimp for $12, I believe.  All four of us had the filet, which was slightly overcooked for our preferences, but was delicious nonetheless.  The service was fairly attentive, but nothing out of the ordinary.

When he asked to get the steak recooked, it came back nearly burnt on the outside. My other friend ordered the same thing and got it medium well. For a steakhouse, I would think this should be their best dish. I got the 18 hour braised short rib. Actually, it wasn't that bad at all! The sauce they provide goes really well with the meat, and you get a little bit of a ""side"" with it, so it help take a break from all the meat. The only downside was the meat was a bit on the dry side if I didn't pour the sauce all over it.

We were in Las Vegas for a weekend and wanted to have French food but didn't have the time or money for a really fine dinner so we opted for brunch. We debated between Bouchon and Morels but finally decided on Morels because they make Eggs Benedict, Bouchon doesn't. 

There were four of us plus a little one. We sat at a beautiful round table and were treated like royalty from minute one by a friendly staff. They were complete professionals, keeping the table clean and stocked. First they brought us fresh beignets that were light and not overly sweet. We ordered French press coffee -- which was incredible and not the least bit gritty like the kind I make at home, espresso, a ""virgin"" latte for the kid, and handmade Bloody Marys. Oh boy, are these a treat! Seriously, these ALONE are worth a trip.

They bring out a cart full of fixings. Their own homemade tomato juice, hand grated horseradish, fresh chopped garlic, limes for squeezing, etc. Marcos, our waiter, talked us through the entire process of making the drink and graciously allowed three of us to copiously snap his picture. It was fun! The Bloody Mary was incredible. At $14, I don't know how they break even! I could have had three more. Yum, yum, yum.

Next, we ordered breakfast: Steak and eggs (with frites), a crab omelet (came with brioche), Eggs Benedict with crab, and French Dip -- mine. I thought the sandwich was delicious. Great bread, delicious sauce, perfect touch of cheese, tender meat. The frites were fantastic -- I tried them but got a salad instead. I heard rave reviews on the crab, very tasty and tender, and tried the omelet. It was amazing. So was the bread. Everything was delicious.

Overall, incredible time. Relaxed but our every need was attended to. We lingered and felt no pressure to go. Our bill came quickly when we wanted it. The timing on everything was perfect. Only one thing -- my guy's hashbrowns were not hot. He's big on HEAT. Marcos took them off his plate -- so he could still eat the omelet -- and got new ones made.

Coffee - From Rwanda. Very good!

OH! I didn't try it because I saw it on the way out, but they have a bloody mary cart the waiter can bring buy and create to taste. Gonna try it next time.

We started with the three cheese sampler and told the server he could choose (they have way too many cheeses to choose from). He ended up bringing us a four cheese sampler as he was (his words) ""on the fence as to if you were going to like one of them."" How nice! I then asked if he could split the $16 iceberg salad into two portions, ""no problem."" The salad was beautifully presented like we had ordered two of them.

It was really empty since we were the first ones there for lunch. But service was still pretty slow throughout the entire meal. -1 star there. But I really enjoyed the food!

Had the oysters for appetizer, very fresh and pretty fatty. For the main course, I had the Pan Sauteed Sole which was excellent. The accompaniment with the spinach, vegetables, and the SAUCE! Oh my gosh I think the sauce was what made the dish excellent (and of course the fish was perfectly cooked so it's very tender). 

My sister had the steak frites which I thought was great too. She thought it was too well-done and even though I agree with her, the taste was great and because it was a thin steak that it wasn't too tough. 

Overall I liked the food and I will definitely return just for the sole if I'm craving for fish. But it's not one of the must. I would probably invest my time in another French restaurant in Vegas.

I've been going to try Morels during Restaurant Week but never got to it.  I called last week to check that the patio was open for breakfast and that it was heated.  The woman I spoke to said, ""Oh yes!  It's very nice.""

I was there close to opening time this morning.  When I went in, I asked the host if the patio was open.  He said, ""Yes, but it's cold out.""  I replied that I knew and I had dressed warmly.  I was shown to a table facing TI.  During the 45 or so minutes I was there, I had no company on the patio and the heaters were not on nor were any turned on for my benefit.

Having read the Yelp reviews and the menu online, I think I knew when I went I would be ordering the mascarpone stuffed French toast.  I also got the Kenya AA Oaklands Estate coffee that was done in a French press.  I got a glass of tomato juice and some tabasco to make my spicy breakfast drink.

The French toast was excellent.  When I ordered, my server, Carlos, asked if I wanted the syrup on the side which was my choice.  The French toast is a nice sized round of tasty bread filled with mascarpone and topped with fresh strawberries, bananas, and a few raspberries.  The cinnamon on the toast and some crunchy sugar on the berries added to the fine flavor.  The syrup was good, but I could use it sparingly the French toast was so good.

Carlos brought me a second pot of coffee and I enjoyed sitting there watching the workers do some painting of the walls.  I hadn't seen any graffiti from New Year's Eve partiers, but maybe they were just cleaning up some foot prints where people jumped the wall to get to the closed Boulevard.

I would have given Morels four stars but for the heaters.  When you call ahead and get a yes answer and then it's not true and no one offered to light the one right behind me, it's a service let down for me.  Carlos was a fine server and we talked about where he had parked NYE so he could get to work and back to his car with the street closures.  He gave me some tips I'll put to use next year when I do go to the Boulevard or close instead of watching on TV.",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,6,5,3,6YHytZe_geKr5i15uq0J5g

Look, I get that every good restaurant in Vegas has overinflated prices, in fact I have chastised other reviewers for commenting on that in previous reviews of other restaurants in Vegas.  But when an experience is bad, then that price just slaps you that much harder.

First, we did not have a reservation.  But the restaurant was half-empty.  They proceeded to walk us to the farthest back table, as if we were wearing escaped state pen prisoner garb.  It's hard to get the ""vibe"" and atmosphere of a joint when you are miles away from another diner.

The next major issue was the service.  I think the best word to describe it is just clumsy.  The waiter seemed disinterested.  The wait staff themselves were just a mess (at one point trying to take the side of mushrooms that was half full when we were not done eating).  When bringing the bottle of wine, they attempted to just pour it, without even  the courtesy taste.  A friend threw the hand over his glass before he could, but good grief, this is just a common courtesy.

The food.  Bland, under seasoned, boring, and meh.  Just meh.  I make a better steak and I make better mushrooms, and I'm not a great cook by any means.

I made a reservation for our group on Opentable for 11 on a Sunday. When we arrived there was no wait and we were given the choice of dining on the patio or inside. Summers in Vegas are no joke, so I was slightly apprehensive about dining al fresco in June, but the patio was nicely shaded and quite comfortable. 

Service by our waiter Richard was good, he was friendly and did not seem put off by the fact that we were ordering from the RW menu or that we would be sharing our meals. We decided to go with the Classic Benedict for $20 and the Steak Frites for $30, both 3 course meals.

All of the food we had was well made and tasted great. The fruit was fresh and the greek salad has a delightfully light vinaigrette dressing. Our steak was tender and cooked exactly as we had requested. The benedict was a great portion size for sharing, with yummy smoked ham on brioche. Our third course was desserts; a creamy and decadent crème brûlée as well as a crepe served with chocolate sauce, strawberries, bananas and whipped cream. 
 
The only issues I had with our meal were minor service related snafus: 
-I would have ordered a Bloody Mary from the cart however at no point was it offered.  
-The breakfast we selected came with french press coffee, which we had to ask for.
-Third course came out as we were still very clearly working on the second. 

Even with these minor issues, our time at Morels was very enjoyable. I left happy and full, and would gladly return to dine there again.",Ae4uXwFHp-5fGrt6OONaXw,8,7,4,Yll38gzlHZm0Sn2tfGs9Bw

The last one is not something I enjoy, but that's just how it is in Vegas. At Morel's, high prices was the only expectation of mine they met. 

Let's start with ambiance:
Nothing luxurious, fancy, or pretty about it. Boring. 

Food:
All average and pretty tasteless. Not worthy of the prices whatsoever. We were a party of 14 (3 of them being kids) and not one person liked their food. At a price tag of over $1500, that's a sucky way to start a Vegas trip. My salmon was dry and tough, the steaks undercooked and flavorless, and the sides extremely flavorless. Even the mac and cheese just tasted like pasta off the kids menu with some butter and Parmesan. 

Service:
A huge disappointment. The busboys were extremely attentive with refilling waters so there's a plus. The hostesses were straight up mean and were gossiping about us, in front of us. Um you're a restaurant not bouncers at a club. You should be pleasant. Our waiter was incredibly rude and just didn't seem to care at all. 2 seconds after I ordered my cocktail I decided I wanted wine. Annoying I know, but it was a quick change of heart. The waiter pretended to check with the bar and said they already made the drink. How do we know he pretended? We saw him!!! Not a huge deal, but lots of little things like that plus a rude attitude and it equals no beuno service.

4107223,2017-09-10,3,O_C-2kZMHGnq3ZDL_OaG6Q,"Aside from concerns about what I actually ordered and apathy toward the complimentary app, I quite enjoyed this rare trip to a Strip restaurant.

I made my first visit to Morels French Steakhouse & Bistro for a Sunday brunch with Yelpers to celebrate Christie L.'s birthday. Morels is in the lobby of Palazzo and has patio seating, but we stuck to an indoor table. Perhaps others know of a different parking garage entrance, but I took the elevators nearest to the ramp at Palazzo, which is a short walk across the casino floor away.

We were seated promptly after about 7 of us had gathered (for a reservation for 10) and immediately set to trying to decide what to pick from the vast Summer Brunch menu. I stuck to water as my beverage, but others had coffee brewed in a French press or even a Bloody Mary. Maybe the coffee would've been wise after my bout of insomnia. It also seemed to pair with the complimentary ""beignets,"" which weren't all that fresh (judging from lukewarm temp) or enjoyable chewy.

My particular order was the Crab Benedict (billed as $20) with a side of Housemade Country Potatoes ($5). The potatoes didn't exactly go with the entree, especially if utilizing the side of ketchup, but they were filling, properly seasoned, and thoroughly cooked. The benedict itself was pretty decent, with two perfectly poached eggs on a thick-cut airy slice of brioche, and a creamy Hollandaise over it all. I could've done with more diced asparagus and a little more crab, and there were two bits of shell remaining in the latter.

My tablemates allowed me to taste some awesome stuff though. The Imported Mushroom Souffle ($15) came out billowing over the ramekin, and it tasted delicious. The Banana & Mascarpone Stuffed French Toast was even more delicious, with plenty of caramelization on the toast. The Onion Soup Gratinée ($10) was the last of three dishes that I'd confidently recommend off one bite. It was so cheesy and rich in caramelized onion.

The rest of the items could be worth a try, although they wouldn't be at the top of my list. I also liked the Bananas Foster Pancakes ($17), although the maple syrup outshined the bananas and pancakes.  The Almost Famous Mac & Cheese ($10) was enjoyable despite its simplicity. It was creamy and rich in cheese flavor. Last, but not least, the side of bacon ($6) was simple but thickly cut yet crunchy. I would trust their bacon based on this.

We shared the Baked Alaska ($14) for dessert. The waiter had some trouble lighting the rum, but we did get a waterfall of blue fire in the end. The rum flavor was easily found in every bite too, and the meringue, cake, and ice cream were pretty tasty.

Although my own entree was somewhat underwhelming, I would go back to Morels for a Strip-worthy special occasion brunch. Just make sure you're not with any puritanical party members or else they might be concerned with the wall decor, which prominently features a series of paintings of nude, paired figures of opposite sexes.",_VMGbmIeK71rQGwOBWt_Kg,7,4,4,TKT27n25aoiexCbnOhvApQ

The service (crappy attitude, but more on that later) is generally good and so is the food.  I would say the food is actually very good.  Be sure to try their steaks and seafood.

All that said...... Yes,  I am the asshole that is going to give this place a one star.  Was it one bad night?  Probably.  In this case I'm just not going to forgive.  I'm taking the contrarian, glass half empty view, they-didn't-care-about-me-so-fuck-you kind of attitude.  I've been to plenty of great places, and I'm a great customer to those that ""get it"" and know how to serve, especially when they charge top dollar.

I was there with a total of three people.  All of their wait staff seemed to be pretty responsive, and attractive to boot.  Our waiter was charismatic.  Too bad we didn't have a female.

At issue is that my friends and I were going to order entrees with a little bit of an appetizer to get us going.  And that's where our waiter came in.

He basically started **selling** us on the big appetizer platter.  That it'd be good, it'd be perfect for the three of us, that we'd enjoy it... A real sell job.  It got to the point that I started thinking, I wonder what I can afford as a monthly payment... And where do I sign the lease papers before this dumbshit has to go back to ""talk"" with his ""manager""?  It was THAT bad. 

We thought, fine. Let's get past this.  It's generally good to trust your waiter for recommendations, right?  We go for the appetizer platter.

The sommelier stops by to assist with their very extensive wine list.  Again, a sell job.  The sommelier is having us go through the $400+ list.  This guy is selling pretty hard.  We instead go for a bottle from the regular list that's a little lighter on the wallet.

Appetizer comes in on a cart with three waiters to set it up.  Holy shit!  Appetizer alone is a frickin meal and a half.  All great quality, but just complete overload.  Since we trusted the waiter on his advice, we do courteously inform that it was just too much.  

His response?  Eh, that sucks.  Just eat as much as possible.  

So we struggle through the massive appetizer platter.  Then our main courses come.  Again, fantastic food, but just WAY too much.  

As we're going through the meal, the armies of wait staff zoom by our tables.  I overhear from a few, how they sold this expensive dish or that bottle of $1,000 alchohol.... So everything put together I'm thoroughly pissed.  I'm feeling like we were completely fleeced by this waiter.

Food was really good though, we just had nowhere to put all of it.  The waiter had the nerve to ask us about desserts after we had made it perfectly clear throughout the meal that the food quanitity was insanely too much.  

And the bill for three, all in with gratuity ended up being a little over $600.

My advice if you do come here:  1)  Know the menu beforehand and what you want to order, 2) Don't get fucked by the waitstaff's ""advice"".  They're in it to make a buck, not take your dining interest to heart.

It certainly is on par with Bouchon and Delmonico's with perhaps a better selection of oysters and the shrimp / scallops were out of this world. Cooked to perfection.

The cheese board has introduced us to some of our favorite cheeses ever and they have an extensive selection of wine, well priced for the Vegas strip location with experts that can guide you in the right selection.

With that said, the grass-fed Kansas NY strip steak was completely average. I ordered it medium-rare and it was cooked properly, even though they've been known to have a hard time cooking a steak to a diner specifications. I had wanted to order some asparagus but they were out, so I got artichokes instead - these were only okay. So yeah, the steaks?  A total miss.

The seafood on the other hand... we got the seafood platter and it. was. phenomenal! The shrimp cocktail (which is usually just average) was the best I've ever had. The texture of the shrimp were just perfect, the chilled crab delightful and the oysters were fresh! They shuck them to order, and have a varied selection of sizes that span the east and west coast. These fresh fruits from the sea were served over crushed ice (how else?) accompanied by fresh lemon, mignonette (no shallots or black pepper to be found though), cocktail sauce and a whole grain mustard mayo. Wonderful! 

They definitely boast the most fantastic cheese selection in Las Vegas. My only concern is that they do not seem busy enough to possibly sell enough cheese to be turning it over quickly. With cheese, as soon as you cut into a wheel, the quality of it begins to go down. However, everything I had was delicious, especially with the fresh baguette, house made date spread and honey comb.

The charcuterie platter was equally delicious and a fantastic savory compliment with whole grain mustard, cocktail onions and cornichons! Mmm. Cured meats are my kryptonite.

I was informed by a former manager of the restaurant that Morel's had the best French Onion soup in town.. I found this to not be so. It arrived at the table not quite hot enough, not enough cheese, although the broth was robust it still seemed to be lacking something. If you're there and it's what you're craving, then okay.. but definitely not worth going out of your way for.

The pistachio souffle with cherry ice cream was more than worth the wait and I'd highly recommend it! I'm a sucker for a good souffle, and Morel's can do theirs right.

The wine list is also worth a mention as it is varied and lengthy and well thought out with a lot of interesting bottles.

Shrimp Cocktail : Fabulous! Really fresh; Chilled to perfection; Beautifully presented. The only thing that could have made it slightly better for me is a lemon wedge.

 French Onion Soup : Jeff loved it! 

Baby Iceberg salad : I ordered with no bacon. Really crisp and tasty. I really liked the sun dried tomatoes. 
Asked for salt and was presented with a variety of three. I have never seen this before and thought it was a great touch.

Filet: Cooked perfectly rare; Juicy

Mushrooms: Nice size portion for two; So tasty; One of my favorite things! 

Mac and Cheese: None for me but my husband said it was good. Not to rich; not to cheesy; Again nice size portion

For our Cheese course we chose a variety of three after telling our server what we liked in our cheeses he did very well with suggestions. The cheese monger presented the cheeses and was very nice. We had a Mimolette/cows milk from france, Cashel Blue/cows milk from Ireland and the ""most stinky but interesting cheese I have yet to experience The Grayson/cows milk from Virgina US.

Located at the Palazzo hotel http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/O_C-2kZMHGnq3ZDL_OaG6Q?select=q_XliEMMc_vle_IYjdF3kQ, Morels is a nicely designed space, done in dark understated yet rich tones, accented by Murano chandeliers and Tom Cannon's enormous, in your face art, all of naked female form.  

As an aside, Tom Cannon must be a real lover of breast implants.  Not one boob in his paintings looked natural.  I couldn't decide if it was art or more of a cartoon-type work, but as the idiom goes, ""The boob is in the eye of the beholder"".

Some of us opted for the terrace, as for the rest of us - there was not really any other available place to wait.

Once seated, we found our server Rick to be friendly and efficient.   I still don't like it when a waiter announces his name, especially in an upscale restaurant.  I've never heard anyone call ""Hey Rick"" at XIV.  Depending on people's age and preference, it's always either ""Excuse me"", ""Waiter"", or ""Excuse me, Sir"".  Why do I need his name?  I'm not planning on exchanging Christmas cards with Rick...  

I ordered Onion Soupe Gratinee and 18 Hour Red Wine Braised Short Rib, which was a mouthful, even before I got any food.  My date shared a Petite Romaine Heart Salad, served tableside, for two or more, with a friend.  For the main course, he ordered Grilled Halibut.  Almost everyone else ordered Kansas City Steak and Choice Filet Mignon.  We already had cocktails, so we shared 2 bottles of Red, don't remember which, but I do remember that Rick said that decent wine starts at $75.00 a bottle at Morels...

My soup was delicious, rich, full of onion and cheese flavors, and a good size.

As to Petite Romaine Heart Salad, I was told that it was good, but that Petite applied to the size of the salad instead of that of the romaine hearts...

Then came my favorite part of the evening.  Our entrees arrived.  It was like a beautifully orchestrated symphony.  Seven waiters plus waiters' assistants all descended on our table at exactly the same time.  Things were moved, knives were placed, glasses were repositioned, and all our seven entrees magically landed in front of us
at the exact same moment.  Talk about food orgasm, this was service orgasm!

My short rib was excellent, you could really appreciate the tastes embedded in it in 18 hours.

My date's halibut was OK, I was told, but it looked really tiny.  
All side dishes are extra, by the way, so if you want a side of steamed asparagus, for example, that alone will knock you $14.00.  If you want a different sauce - that's extra too. 

Now to the steaks.  Of the 5 people who ordered them, 2 or 3 complained that the cut wasn't what it was supposed to be, that the beef was too chewy, and one complained of an overcooked steak.

http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/O_C-2kZMHGnq3ZDL_OaG6Q?select=CIYQHfa3dExTAv4OMLw-ng

To make us feel better, we were comped two desserts for the entire table of 7 (a little stingy, considering, if you ask me).

So, based on my food alone, it would have been 4 stars, but given the bad steaks in a steakhouse, and prices that I thought were too high, the most I can give is 3.  

Knowing that I will be writing a review, I, very not ladylike, craned my neck to see what my date was paying.  Two entrees, two appetizers, and about half a bottle of wine (maybe a diet coke too) - around $200.00.

Ouch.

If you happen to go there on a cool evening, sit on the terrace, you'll have an amazing view of the Strip AND you can see the Sirens of Treasure Island show that's across the street and runs a couple of times a night.",DUS7E1bmqBF62iQG8RaRuA,17,17,3,FYnngoEHPOU-uuKQU400Vw

The decor of this place is gorgeous, and that brought it up to 3 stars. That and the service was pretty good. 

My family came here for a quick fondue with some drinks before going to the pool or heading out to the strip. We LOVE fondue and were salivating at the idea of a fondue appetizer. We ordered it for three, and three proseccos. 

The fondue was pretty bad. I mean, it was cheesy, but it tasted like a cheese sauce more than an authentic fondue. Even worse, the bread they gave us had NO crunch at all. It seemed like a white loaf that had been sitting there or not baked to a crisp. 

We ran out of bread and asked for some different crispier bread, and he brought back baguette pieces. They looked great, but upon touching them I realized they were also soft. No crunch at all. 


For 30 dollars for the fondue, it was a total let down. If you love fondue, please don't order this. I've had fondue in a lot of places, including Switzerland, and this is a joke of fondue. 

Prosecco was good, service was good, and decor was good... But at a place like this, expensive ish food shouldn't be so 'meh'",x-W0OQiUdNLsoMhg6GfXSg,1,1,3,6Qelxv13R-RjIU3g4pC6PA

4366665,2010-05-25,0,O_C-2kZMHGnq3ZDL_OaG6Q,"My co-workers and I are in Vegas on a business trip; two of us are foodies. All of us really wanted a good steak, so we researched our options and decided on Morel's. Not being Vegas neophytes we didn't expect prices to be inexpensive, but info online indicated a good steak for $35 - $50. 

We arrive around 8PM and are seated promptly. We are greeted right away and our waiter, Paul, was all over us pushing us to order right away. As we're reviewing the menu and prices, plus the cheese list, we figure out that the steaks start at $55 and go up from there. Guess you can't believe everything on the Net.  

We ordered cheese so we could decide what else to have and ordered drinks. The drinks took a while to arrive; our waiter, who a short time before had been all over us trying to get us to order, now seemed to have no time for us, even though the dining room was not even 1/3 full.

Soon, a party of about 10 businessmen is seated near us. We three women become invisible. A dining experience that started off a little odd went thoroughly downhill from there. We weren't expense-account businesspeople, didn't order lots of very expensive wine and cocktails, didn't order expensive steaks. Having been in the business, I know how waiters think:  3 women, not spending much = poor tip. 

Paul:  your tip would have been great had you not decided that we weren't worth your time.

We ordered a drink that never came, waited an hour for entrees, had empty beer bottles on our table - certainly not service that lived up to the high prices. I complained to Paul the waiter, who then declined to look at us again until time to drop the check. He did send the manager over who apologized, comped a round of drinks and bought dessert. In the meantime, entrees arrive, and the salmon entree one of us ordered was inedible. So we sent it back and declined to re-order, figuring it would take another hour and 1/2 for any more food to arrive. Paul the waiter decided he could talk to us again after the manager gave us dessert and more drinks, but by then the damage was done.

Folks, I give this one a ""don't even bother"". Anyplace would have had better service, better food and somewhat less stratespheric prices. What a disappointment.",iyFT9D39KwuY8NCuX2FW4Q,1,0,2,BajbWrlVWVSF04cD_LMvgw

My wife ordered the petite filet mignon (8 oz). Really nice char on it and a delicious pink. Really good piece of meat. 

However it was the Bacon and Tomato risotto that totally won me over. I make risotto all the time at home (it's my thing if you will) and heaven knows I've had bad risottos at restaurants. I recognize it's hard to pull off in a restaurant setting. But that's what made the following so spectacular.

Let me just say this is one of the better risottos I've ever had. Sticky, smoky bacon, heirloom tomatoes that exploded like delicious firecrackers in your mouth and that finish of fresh basil was to die for. If I had one complaint it was that the fava beans almost seemed lost, but not enough to make me regret this dish at all.

Fresh fruit
Seasonings
Pristine Service

Things you will find at Morel's:

Overpriced menu items for the quality being served
Odd, bumbled service
Under-seasoned food

My friend and I decided to do breakfast at Morel's. We have somewhat of a tradition going on of trying new places to eat at. Our most recent jaunts have been to French places. Morel's comes in at our number three experience at a French restaurant on the strip and it is dead last based on service and food.

The reason for two stars has to do with the food primarily. I can overlook poor service if the food is spectacular, but Morel's is putting out average food parading as fresh French cuisine. With so many other better options to eat at on the Strip Morel's should be ashamed at what they are plating.

To begin we ordered the fruit plate. An assortment of tragically cut mediocre fruit is what was served. Blueberries that were not fresh, but looked as though they had been frozen for days. ONE strawberry haphazardly cut, a measly portion of pineapples, cantaloupe and honeydew melon. I could have gotten this assortment of fruit at Denny's, in a bowl, as a side dish, without the $11 price tag. Truly a waste.

I had: Crab Eggs Benedict. While the presentation was perfect the execution was poor. It was plain and simple: BLAND. The crab was tasteless, the bread was decent, the entire dish - didn't seem to be seasoned at all! To add to this, there was no salt or pepper on the table. I realized I should have salted and peppered my dish about halfway through it and at that point I basically said screw it, I'm just going to finish it.

My friend had: Crab Omelet with a side of potatoes, mushrooms, and peppers. This was touted to be amazing by our server.... it was also bland, lacking any real depth or flavor. The dish sorely needed salt, just something to make the potatoes pop. I've had better breakfast potatoes at numerous establishments that could beat these by a long shot. My friend ordered a side of mustard just to give her meal a bit more kick to it.

Costa Rican Pressed Coffee - At $5 for the press this is a bit of a splurge, but honestly the coffee was the best part of my meal.

Service - Our server was nice, but the busser didn't bother to acknowledge our table's presence when we sat down. We were approached by a server who wanted to take our order AFTER we had already put in our order with another server. I mean, stuff like this I might dismiss at other restaurants, but not at a place where I'm paying $11 for a plate of fruit. STEP UP YO GAME MOREL'S.

Overall - I will not return here. There are numerous other places in Las Vegas to find a good breakfast. And honestly if they can't do breakfast right I have very low expectations of their dinner service and quality of steaks.",hZfzVrhsCQ9JDAb2jYoJNQ,4,2,2,A_lcI6P5K_ezyrBHU8spjg

From the get-go, it was bad.  The hostesses were a little brusque and seemed disinterested in seating us even though the restaurant was virtually empty.  She even tried to seat us at a table directly facing the incoming sunlight instead of moving us to a booth in a further location away from the glare.  We had to ask her to move us and she sighed, implying that it was a hard thing to ask of her.  It was extremely frustrating.

The wait staff was nicer and were very accommodating to our complete ignorance of their menu and specialty cheese.  I ordered the chef's special short-rib ($52) and the rest of my table had a gran plateau ($145!!!), which is a whole assortment of the ""chilled seafood.""  This included ceviche, shrimp, oysters, 1/2 a dungeonous crab, and a lobster.  

Frankly, the food was alright but definitely below my expectations, especially for the prices they were charging!   The short rib was tender but something I could have cooked at home.  Nothing very special.  And the chilled seafood tasted as if the seafood had been sitting in the freezer for a while.  Again, not all that special.

Overall, the food and price was not good.

The decor did not salvage this place either.  There was no harmony to the place.  The blue and gray theme gave an air of depression and the lighting was less than perfect.  The booths' hanging lights were very classy and appropriate, but the lights outside of the booths were morose and in a dark washed cherry wood.  It clashed horribly since half the restaurant was themed modernly and the other half was Victorian/classic.  

Though it was an experience, I don't think I'd recommend this place to anyone.",027VHcm-5CSB5vwGTLFU3A,0,2,2,VqKAgpJLvnIcBkiho7XM7A

4514725,2012-11-13,0,O_C-2kZMHGnq3ZDL_OaG6Q,"Here's one word that describes our experience at Morels:  decadent.  We were in town to watch GNR at The Joint, and I wanted to find a nice restaurant to celebrate my husband's birthday.  I read some of the reviews and was slightly apprehensive, but I took the plunge and made the reservations.  

Although we were 30 minutes late, the hostess quickly sat us.  As other people have mentioned, the dining room at Morels is quite beautiful and elegant.  There's no smoking allowed which makes the dining experience that much more pleasant.  The clientele is a diverse mix.  To our right was a couple that was dressed in smart casual clothes (think dinner attire on a cruise).  To our left diagonal was a guy in a t-shirt and jeans with a mullet.  To our right diagonal was a party of 6 dressed in cocktail attire.  So in case you were wondering what the dress code was, it was fairly lenient.

We had three people helping with our table.  I, unfortunately, can only remember Mike who was the ""captain.""  He was sensational as was his team.  Service was exemplary.  We never wanted for anything.  

Our evening started out with two piping hot dinner rolls served with olive paste and creamy butter.  Then we were served the soup du jour which was a seafood bisque.  It was described to be similar to a lobster bisque.  The bisque was creamy and just hot enough to sip.  Along with the soup came the bibb lettuce and crab salad as well as the tuna tartare.  It was a very fresh and citrusy salad topped with a subtle and light tarragon dressing.  The combination of the peppers and the sesame oil in the tuna was a perfect ratio, not too overpowering on one side of the flavor palate over the other.  For dinner, my husband ordered a petite filet mignon with a side of country mac & cheese.  Though I didn't taste the pasta, I assume he enjoyed it since there was nothing left in the bowl.  I did, however, taste the filet which was cooked to a perfect medium, slightly pink in the middle with a nice velvety brown coating on the exterior.  It came with a side of bordelaise sauce which was a nice complement to the steak.  I ordered the 18 hour braised short rib.  Just when I thought that The Farm's short rib couldn't be topped, I was proven wrong by the dish that the chef at Morels prepared.  It was tender, had a unique flavor, probably brought on by the lardons of bacon which were part of the dish, and the quality of the beef was superb. We topped off our meal with what can only be described as a mind-blowing dessert:  the hazelnut & gianduja chocolate dome.  Try it and you'll see.

Two more items on their menu which we found impressive:  they offered Duvel and Chopin.  We dined a several places in town while we were there and nobody had either of those two items on their menu.

Lucky for us, there's a Morels closer to home at The Grove so we won't be missing it for very long.",VVUix2L3n_blO0VQ08Gi0Q,1,1,5,eaT5XFvUm81WNTaBYd3Esw

Like Napoleon
Surrender to the Ribeye
Don't forget the wine

As with my previous reviews of other Vegas restaurants, please remember that most everything in this town is priced 10 to 1000 times what it should cost anywhere else in America. If your not ready for that, maybe Branson is more your style. 

On to the Review!

On any occasion necessitating a gathering of men in Sin City, the ""Steak Night"" is usually the highlight of the trip. Its a right of passage for Gentlemen of Means. Red Wine and Red Meat. This trip was no different. 

The meal began with a knowledgeable staff taking us on a tour of Australian vineyards. 3 bottles to be exact. Each complimenting a different portion of the meal. All 3 . . . EXCELLENT. 

Morels is a la cart (like any fine steakhouse should be). For a man there is only 1 cut of meat that you are allowed to eat. That is a ribeye. Morels had several different rib-eyes. I went with the grass fed. It was excellent. I had it medium (as any man should do). 

The table split 6 different sides, my absolute favorite being the Truffle Macaroni and Cheese. It was very good. My lease favorite was the mashed potatoes. They were simply average. 

I concluded the meal with a cappuccino, some sambuca and the profiteroles. All delicious. 

I don't want to take anything away from Morels. It was an excellent meal. Its just that for a Las Vegas steakhouse I expected more. There was nothing that made this place shine above several of the other places I have eaten. When you get together with your friends once every few years you expect the best.

The first part was the service was very slow or at least our waiter was. His name was Jesus and he came over and introduced himself and took drink orders to start. The problem was he brought back the wrong drink for me, and his 5 oz pours were very stingy for the rest of my party. He told my gf that the beer she wanted they did not have and so he said he would get something else. We did not see him for another fifteen minutes and so we just grabbed another waiter who I asked to get me to get a different drink and order one for my gf. Also he took our orders. Jesus only showed after we got our new drinks.

Secondly, why this is a two instead of a three is the price. When I buy a $60 stake I want to know I'm eating a sixty dollar steak and sadly it was not up to that standard. If I paid $20 for it I think this place would deserve a three but for that price I was not blown away.

Overall, this place is so-so, and for the price you can find something that you will absolutely love some place else in vegas.",trRUwWOAGoBvrIx8P4vFKw,0,0,2,X0R0Illern_tRzKlB3y7yw

I do not ask for much in a Crepe. All I need it to be is light, airy, thin, crispy around the edges and have a even light Maillard reaction across both surfaces. The Chefs at Morels met all those Crepe requirements on both dishes. I am a big fan of Gruyere so you cannot trust my opinion on their choice of Cheese as it is most likely biased. The Gruyere in their Crepe was of excellent quality. It had lots of nuttiness and fruitiness. You just know that wheel has Switzerland stamped all over it. The Mushrooms were properly sauteed and seasoned. I had read reviews where people say that their food had no flavor. I am a big proponent of letting the staff know your if food is bland. Thankfully, I did not have this issue on this trip to Morels. 

The Toast was a couple of pieces of Brioche, some Jam and Butter. It was a good breakfast accompaniment but nothing I didn't have at home.

We came at the end of breakfast, around 1030am and so the restaurant wasn't that packed. In fast we were probably one of 10 tables there, and outside was closed since it was a bit windy. We ordered two cocktails, both of which were excellent, and necessary since when your in Vegas you are required (by law perhaps? :p ) to have a drink with every meal. My boyfriend ordered the french toast while I have the croque madam, I really liked my sandwich a lot but I have to say that my boyfriends meal was really what impressed me. The french toast was very nicely prepared and the flavors were off the charts, mine was a little heavy on the cheese for such a meal early in the day but that's mostly my fault since I knew it was quite the cheesy sandwich prior to ordering it. We had a $50 OpenTable gift certificate, so those always tend to ease the bill a little when traveling but still paid $70 out of pocket when all was said and done. I have to say for breakfast, for $120, it better be one REALLY nice breakfast, and although this was an excellent breakfast, the price really gives me pause. I believe this restaurant might have more to offer for their dinner menu, but if breakfast is going to run you this much I would expect the average dinner to two around $200-300 depending on what you ordered. 
With this is mind, would I come back here...only probably with an OpenTable gift certificate, otherwise I would most likely choose a different place for breakfast.

I have no idea how much the meal would have cost us if we had to pay.  I was able to find the price for the salad at $19.  Filet Mignon at $53, and Salmon at $33.  I'd say the price is average for a restaurant like this in Vegas.

Food gets 4 stars.  Not the best, but certainly better than average.  My French Onion Soup was probably the best and biggest I've had (the cheese was tasty and stringy, not rubbery, all melted on top of the toasted slice of bread), while my enormous 14oz sirloin (standard size) was good and cooked to my liking, but I felt like they added an unneeded sauce or something.  I did enjoy the mashed potatoes.  Loved the dessert of 3 different creme brulees (my favorite two were the pistachio and the vanilla bean), but unfortunately no one at my table was able to get more than half down because like I said, they kept us too long and we missed the beginning of our show.

The atmosphere was pretty interesting in its variety.  Definitely upscale, but I liked the fact that to get to the dining room, you have to walk by an appealing glass case stocked with gourmet cheeses.

You start with gratis toast, strawberry jam, and butter.  The jam is legit.  It's housemade and it was fantastic.  Were I to return I would definitely get a couple of slices of toast again.

I went with the chicken and waffles and also tried some scrambled eggs and potatoes off of another plate.  I also had a glass of orange juice which was very good.  Way better than I was expecting.  Clearly fresh squeezed and chilled.  Best OJ I've had in a long time.

The chicken and waffles comes with a lot of chicken.  I gave a couple of pieces away and still had plenty.  The waffle is nice and crispy but it's dry.  It sucked up the syrup like a sponge, I had to ask for another serving.  It's a good waffle, I had better on our trip, but it was good.  The chicken is crispy but needed seasoning.  I enjoyed this dish enough to order it again, but I imagine were I to return to Morels I would try something else, because the chicken and waffles weren't so good that I MUST get them again.

The eggs and potatoes were decent but had issues.  The eggs were scrambled too hard, they were fairly overcooked.  Also, my brother ordered the eggs with cheddar cheese, and all they did was lay a piece of cheddar on top rather than scrambling it with the cheese.  I am guessing this is why they were overcooked, they cooked the entire thing under the salamander to get the cheese melted after they had already scrambled the eggs.  The potatoes weren't seasoned in any way I could discern.  Once you added salt and pepper they were okay, but this was another disappointment.

We had a great lunch, I was catching up with old friends from my time living in Vegas.  They kept refilling our bottomless mimosas ($25) and did not rush us at all even though the meal had been over for around an hour.  Very hospitable.",JXHrhT72U6sZJQSkFfNzjw,4,1,3,7fP3Z049glZC64NOtrEwjg

The bone in rib eye here is really good - it's cooked well - when you ask for medium rare they deliver on that perfectly and it's seasoned well.  In case you get tired of the old salt and pepper flavoring, they offer you three different sauces to dip the steak in.  One is a salsa mix, another is au jus, and the last is ... well, just as delicious.

I've heard recently that it's not as good as it used to be, but I've only got fond memories of this place.

It'll run you about $120 a person if you have a drink and appetizers, which I highly recommend.  Make it a complete meal, it'll be worth it.

We also opted for the wine pairing, 4 wines for $20. A great deal overall, but be aware the wine pours are a tasting only, so about 1-2 oz each.  The courses are all reduced from full sizes, but with the four it was satisfying enough, however the food itself was fairly standard.  Starter course: Curry Shrimp (very good) / Fried Calamari (not as tender as it should be). App course: Beef Slider and fries (Beef overcooked, Fries very good) / Mussels (Very small mussels and the broth too watery and salty to be enjoyed with bread). Third course: Greek Salad (some of lettuce was bitter, but olives were wonderful) / Caesar salad (very standard). Entrée course: Top Sirloin and Potato Puree (well cooked and good) / Same Top Sirloin but added Crab Oscar (Cooked to temp as requested, but crab was very tiny and strings of crab (canned?) and Béarnaise was pretty hard to find on top).  Overall the food was good, and nothing that would be sent back to the kitchen, but was a bit too normal for the reputation of Morels Steakhouse in Vegas.  The service was top of the line, from the seating through the end of the meal.  They  all were aware of our celebration, and from host to server to manager, all congratulated us on our anniversary, along with a complimentary dessert of Crème Brule, which was the best part of the meal.

It was almost like he really wanted to be somewhere else, I know I did at this juncture.  I ordered their $17 Bloody Mary which was served with ZERO ACCOUTERMENTS! No celery, olives, shrimp, etc. REALLY? I asked Waiter A about the paucity of the drink and he asked- what did you want in it! NEVER-MIND! 
Note, still no water. 
""Waiter A"" was also no help whatsoever in navigating the menu. My spouse was unable to get an understanding of how the meal was prepared. Example- Wife - how is the Oregano Chicken prepared? Waiter A - It's Chicken flavored with Oregano. Wife - Thanks.

The food?  I'm a better than average home chef.  I've cooked better steaks at home using high heat methods on my Big Green Egg or pan frying and finishing with a butter garlic glaze.  I was very disappointed with the steak. Nuff said on that..

We had a Crab Appetizer, Caesar Salad, of course the house rolls, and Steak.  I had the bone-in Strip blackened medium rare with heavy spice and a $25 glass of 2009 Cabernet S.  My colleague had the fillet -medium.  

The best part of the experience was our waiter a native of Acapulco named Tino (I believe).  He was friendly, funny and thoughtful.  I'd give him 5 Stars.

IME the vast majority of the Strip restaurants tend to be soulless and robotic -- they're like machines where a big-name chef put his name over the door then left the local staff to dutifully crank out a set menu for mobs of tourists.  I'm used to having mediocre-to-meh-competent overpriced meals on the Strip.  

At Morels, I was there mid-afternoon (in between shifts -- usually not a great time to get good food) -- yet the food was delicious and tasted like somebody had really been paying attention when they made it, not just doing it by rote.  Steak was high quality and correctly prepared.  Fries were delicious and hot fresh.  Side dish, salad, dessert, all good.  Good selection of wines by the glass.  Service was attentive.  

I suspect the experience may vary depending on how busy they are.  I was there with only a handful of other guests....I tried to go back one evening and it was mobbed, mobbed, mobbed -- it's in the lobby of the Palazzo so an easy meeting place, esp when there's a conference with thousands of people at the Palazzo conference center.

The service is pleasant, the view of the Strip is serviceable (much better at night because it's right across the pirate show at Treasure Island), and the food very reasonably priced for Palazzo standards (lunch for 2 with 2 drinks each is only 100). The problem is that Morel's does nothing to distinguish itself from the overcrowded bistro market in Vegas. Even in the Palazzo/Venetian it's going up against Bouchon and Pinot Brassiere, not t speak of the other bistros all around the strip (Payard, Mon Ami Gabi.. the list goes on). As a result the restaurant is almost always empty: the last time I was here for brunch there were only 6 more guests in the patio and none inside. For a restaurant that does much OK (service, food, prices) it's hard to write a good review because it is just fine in all categories but superb in none.

5279456,2015-10-28,3,O_C-2kZMHGnq3ZDL_OaG6Q,"Located off the lobby of The Palazzo and, as such, easily missed by those visiting the property who are not checking in, Morels could easily be seen as the ""third option"" steakhouse in a resort complex housing Carnevino as well as Delmonico, but a close look shows several differences, a leisurely breakfast or brunch on the outdoor patio providing a great opportunity to take them all in, particularly the city's greatest cheese selection.

Part of a small group, another location found at The Grove in Beverley Hills, Morels spins French on the traditional ""big meat"" concept and going so far as to produce their own wines a glimpse at the interior speaks to the grand brasseries of Central Europe with large nudes hung on walls and an airy, spacious layout while an oyster bar sits up front to tempt those without time or interest for a table within.

Sitting with two friends and a trio of children at a spacious table of three two-tops fit together overlooking the sunny 9:00am Strip below, it was admittedly as guests of the house that a sizable meal was taken, the feast essentially comprised of four courses with children's orders thankfully taken first as two-hours of restaurant rumors and banter proved a challenge for all but the 2-year old, the staff doing an admirable job of expediting plates...and an even better one of trying to clear space for what was decidedly too much food.

Perhaps not going to the lengths of Batali or Lagasse in terms of meat sourcing or buying produce from the very best purveyors around, suffice it to say that those interested in coffee are well advised to elect service from French Presses featuring roasts from Equator, for although priced at $5-7 per person depending on the bean the quality offered from Thomas Keller's preferred brand are easily the best in Sheldon Adelson's complex, particularly with free refills arriving promptly as cup-after-cup was downed.

Offering Mimosas and Bloody Marys mixed tableside it is with pillowy beignets that each brunch at Morels begins, and although granulated sugar would better be replaced with the powdered stuff of New Orleans the oilless donuts proved quite light, as did the leafy greens dressed in fruit and balsamic with a great kick added by Laura Chanel's ever creamy chevre.

Attempting to sample a good variety of items, rather than just focus on obvious 'breakfast hits,' it was with four savories ranging from sandwiches to benedicts that meal marched on and although the picked crab crowned with a perfectly poached egg was unfortunately overwhelmed by a touch too much lemon while a steak requested 'medium' was tender and tasty despite being served nearly blue atop a bed of sauteed onions, both the chicken sandwich and risotto were exceedingly well executed - the former particularly intricate with the nuttiness of Comte playing nicely off peppery arugula bathed in buttery Mornay.

Assuredly taking the opportunity to explore a recently updated carte du fromage, something Morels would be well advised to emphasize both at the tableside and in advertisements around the resort, it was with a great deal of effort that selections were limited to a mere ten options and weaving a wide swath of beasts, countries, and textures one would be hard pressed to make a single bad choice - the aged Canadian Cheddar particularly on-point while both the creamy Brie and Stilton-Sandwich Huntsman were equally well selected, palates rejuvenated between bites by candied walnuts and date paste made in house.

Never one to skimp on sweets, though admittedly a bit disappointed that nearly half the desserts are unavailable at brunch (as is the cheese fondue,) it was still in pancakes, French toast, and a lovely rustic tart that the afternoon concluded, the Pacojet crafted quartet of ice creams exceedingly rich and creamy with the marshmallow studded lightness of lemon meringue the best amongst the crowd.

***Neither trying nor succeeding in any way to steal the thunder of other Steakhouses within the Venetian/Palazzo complex, Morels is better appraised as an upper/mid-range option to be celebrated for its differences, the early opening hours offering a significant upgrade on Grand Lux in terms of service or setting while the fromage, coffee, and ice cream are Strip-side second to none.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,8,5,3,YPaCl4DvGLvy83omxCVbpg

It's a very classy place, with clean, classic decor, nice art on the walls, dim lighting. The modern glowing green Exit signs were the only thing that detracted from the very nice appearance of the place. Walking in you pass the fresh seafood on ice by the bar, and then their cheese area and charcuterie.

The cheese and wine menus are both extensive and both come from all over the world. I chose a glass of white wine to start. In order to save ourselves the trouble of picking out cheese, we just went with the cheese fondue (though they had a cheese expert that I'm sure would have been happy to help us with our cheese orders, had we asked). I'm quite happy with that choice, as the fondue was excellent.

The entrees were equally delicious. I had the brick chicken, which was incredibly tasty. It was probably the best meal I had on that trip to Vegas. My friend reported that his wet aged steak was very good as well. The frites with truffle mayonaisse were also good. If you are a steak connoisseur with money to burn, they have Japanese Wagyu steak for $185.

I was too stuffed for dessert so I didn't get to try that.

Despite having a 3-man team dedicated to serving us (and I counted 7 people that brought us food or interacted with us, excluding the hostess) the service wasn't quite as attentive as I would have expected. It wasn't bad by any means, but we had to wait a bit for someone to take our orders, and sometimes for water refills. It was certainly not enough to keep me from going back there.

Prices... well, it's Vegas, and a restaurant in a hotel on the strip. What do you expect? The prices were about on par with the location and the caliber of the restaurant.

One other thing, they have a nice patio area above the strip overlooking Treasure Island. Unfortunately it was a cool, extremely windy night so we didn't get to enjoy it.",JozaD0E6fVMFnWL7DTaTCw,1,1,4,YXGofVNidxjxO-W5Ugx3cg

I started out with Kumamoto oysters on the half shell and my entrée was Linguini Clam. The oysters were ok... not super fresh, but still good. The clam in my linguini were definitely not fresh though...It was pretty bland too... nothing to write home about. I tried some of the duck rillette.

Like other restaurants on the strip, Morels offers beautiful ambiance, great food, attentive service, good wine selection ... Yet, without being pretentious. It offers outdoor dining, but it was closed for the night because of they forecast rain that day. We got there early, and ordered wine and champagne at the bar and sat outside.

i dined there on valentine's day. They have a special pre fixe menu for the occasion, but also served the regular menu, which I think is great. I would have been pretty upset if I couldn't choose and HAD to order the special menu.

There were 2 of us, we started off with sharing a fondue and then a dozen of oysters. They have a cheese bar, and as expected, the fondue is delicious. I don't know why I ordered seafood in a desert, but the oysters are great. Then, we had a filet mignon with a side pommes frites and the ""18 hour braised beef short rib"". The filet was juicy and done perfectly, but the presentation is ""very interesting"". There was the white plate, with the piece of meat in the middle and a slice of butter on top. Just that. I understand the simplicity and to showcase the steak just by itself, but I don't know if it looked that appetizing. Anyways, the fries were alright, but the truffle mayonnaise dip is fantastic. The short rib is of course really good. Tender, flavorful, but what could have gone wrong with braised rib. We were very full and didn't have dessert, but I would love to try their cheese plate if I come again.

On a side note, Morels is located almost right on the strip across from Treasure Island. When I made the reservation, I thought it would be nice to sit there, and be able to see their show. Well, I guess I had a long dinner, because I saw that show once at the bar, and again and again during dinner; and they lasted like 10 minutes. The explosions of fire, fireworks, lightings were rather distracting the second time, and a bit annoying for the third, even when I was dining indoor. It has nothing to do with the restaurant itself, but it might be something you want to consider when you book a table here for a date.",kfyuweJkT9CMXSjZq0uHcg,0,0,4,Xygzo2hMA68EYa08-1GoGQ

Park near the entrance closest to the check in desk will make finding the restaurant easier. I made a reservation for 6:00pm, but my friend and I got there early. It was not a problem and we were seated without delay.

Our server, Mike, was amazing. He gave us great suggestions on wine and dinner options. He came by often enough to let us know that he was around, but kept away while we were eating or talking. When he got a chance to visit, he was funny and entertaining. Waters were refilled at half glass and food came out in a nice even flow. The service is definitely one of Morel's strong points.

My friend and  started with a cheese board. The ten year aged cheddar with salt crystals was magnificent with the fig spread and honey comb. Sweet and savory is always a winning combination. Paired with a Syrah, I was in heaven. A great start that was about to get better with a half dozen of the kumamoto oysters each. They were fresh, briny, and succulent. It was so hard not to suck them all back. Yet the wisest choice was to savor them. Next, I got the fresh fig and arugula salad. I am not a huge fan of blue cheese, but it balanced out the sweetness of the figs well. This dish had everything. It was creamy from the cheese, crunchy from the walnuts, sweet from the figs, salty cheese, spicy from the arugula, and perfectly dressed. Could this meal get any better? It sure can with a medium rare 14oz. 28 day aged grass fed NY sirloin. The steak needed very little. It comes out with three selections of salt and a few granules is all it needs. The black salt had a nice smokiness to it. To finish our meals, we got a scoop of black currant and green apple ice cream, as well as the vanilla almond profiteroles. The large list of ice cream flavors is impressive. They have a mixture of common favorites and some innovative flavors. Some that caught my eye was the orange honey, pear, black currant, and green apple. The profiteroles came with a side of warm chocolate sauce in a small container to ladle out on your own. There was no semi-sweet chocolate left when I was done. The candied almond slivers was a nice touch for decoration and tasty too.

I can not rave any more highly about my experience at Morel's. So FIN!",N3oNEwh0qgPqPP3Em6wJXw,1,1,5,rn7RdMO-JDYSo0teZmqGww

The weather was wonderful, so we perched on the patio, which is great for taking in the views and people, but elevated and set behind a fountain to protect your experience from the strip commotion.  The service was exceptional.

Quality is where Morels excels over many strip competitors.  Every item offered is consistently of the highest quality, and crafted with precision.   I love their massive cheese list, offering many cheeses from all over the world.  The cheese menu is well organized by cow, goat, and sheep milk; then it is sorted by texture.  The meat and rillette (pate) selection is considerably smaller, but all high quality items with detailed descriptions.  Next time I want to order the Scottish Salmon rillette.

The charcuterie presentation includes tags on each cheese with the name, description, and region.  We ordered the 3 cheese, 3 meat board, which also showed up with the most delicious honeycomb and fig preserves.  Our 3 cheeses:

1.  Mimolette Extra Vielle - Nord-Pas-de Calais, France (Firm Cow's milk) - salty and a little nutty, once banned by the FDA

2.  Valencay Pyramide - Loire Valley, France (Semi soft Goat's milk) - mellow and savory, one of Napoleon's favorite cheeses

3.  Idiazabel - Navarra/Basque, Spain (Firm Sheep's milk) - buttery, nutty, smokey; pairs well with salami and cured meats",KmBPYlD00BupKSwWxOWA6w,1,1,5,B6tWyY2MsWCenPBy7Ive7Q
5401478,2017-06-19,2,O_C-2kZMHGnq3ZDL_OaG6Q,"This is a review for breakfast. We went this morning and I ordered the American breakfast, which comes with three organic eggs, which I ordered sunny side up, and potatoes and a choice of meat, so I picked bacon, all organic. It also comes with brioche, yet only one slice of brioche like one slice of bread, not the classic two slices that one expects with an American breakfast. French pressed coffee or orange juice are included, and I ordered french pressed coffee. 
The coffee is very good. The breakfast itself was just OK. I would not order it again. I did not like only one slice of bread being that I ordered my eggs sunny side up to dip the bread in them. I also think that if you are going to advertise American breakfast, make sure that it is by standards and everybody serves two slices of toast, not one. The bacon was thick and it was delicious so that was very good. My friend ordered a side of sausage links and they were OK. The potatoes were a huge disappointment for me. They were not spiced well and in fact tasted earthy. I had Ketchup to go with them but I would not want to order them again.
My friend ordered a free range egg crab omelette that came with a lovely side salad that looked really good and a slice of brioche toast. She said the omelette was not that great and it was quite large. The salad was just ok too. 
What I was not impressed with was that, at the beginning, they bring out these triangle like bread dumplings that are covered in sugar... One of my friends said it tasted like churros. I thought it tasted like pure sugar. All I know is that it was too sweet and that is not what one is served in Paris, as this restaurant is considered a French steakhouse. I would have rather had an extra slice of brioche with my breakfast then those bread dumplings.
The restaurant itself is lovely and the service is very friendly. Therefore, breakfast was just OK to not so great and it would not be my first choice in the future, although I would not ever order the American breakfast again and would not recommend it.",leY7FqJ3NKPzpM5awAQ2-Q,0,0,3,lERgzlVDSTEGiz7NTW4bUQ

This visit was not the case. The waiters were unfriendly and robotic. We were the only people out on the patio and it was the perfect night for it.

The wine selection was good and my husband and I ordered a Red Zin. It took about 30 minutes for our table to receive our drinks. We both were happy with our drink choice. The rest of the evening was spent ordering as much as we could ahead of time since our waiter would take forever to get our orders out to us. As far as the food goes, we ordered appetizers and were given no recommendations. We had 12 people at our table and an appetizer was enough for 2 people. It would have been helpful if they had suggested we order multiple for the table or just given any sort of direction. The appetizers were very bland.(tuna tartar, crab salad, shrimp scampi). My husband ordered the filet mignon and the order came out incorrectly. It was under cooked and they forgot the sauce that was supposed to be on top. Since everything took forever to come out he had to wait additional time to eat his food. The sides that came with the steak were underwhelming as well. They were also very small, about 5 pieces of asparagus for the whole table, again some direction would have been nice! The french fries were dry. I did like the mushrooms.  I ordered the Salmon which I typically would not at a steakhouse since it's risky. The Salmon was cooked perfectly but everything about the dish lacked flavor.

5479838,2009-04-20,0,O_C-2kZMHGnq3ZDL_OaG6Q,"On a trip to Las Vegas recently with my boyfriend, we were wandering through the shops at the Venetian, and I saw a sign for ""Date Night"" at 7 restaurants in the Venitian and the Palazzo.  We weren't sure if we were going to do it, but later that day we decided to check on it, and sure enough we thought it sounded fun, and Morels sounded the best out of what we like, so we went for it.

The ""Date Night"" is some sort of Prix Fixe menu (3 courses for $40) on Wed-Fri until sometime in mid April.  We got there and the place seemed very nice.  Looking at the three courses, we were amazed at the deal we were probably getting since one of the items on the Fixe menu was $38 by itself.  We both got the menu, and we ordered some cheese as a cheese course between the entree and the desert.

For those who don't know, there is a ridiculous cheese bar.  By ridiculous, I mean ridiculously awesome.  There are around 60 types of cheese, and just trying to choose some for sampling was overwhelming in its own right.  We ended up choosing some English Cheddar (because the bf is from England and complains about the American Cheddars), a strong blue, and some Camembert.

The Fixe menu consisted of three courses, soup or salad (he chose salad, I got soup), salmon (which looked a bit boring) or braised short rib (which we both got), and profiteroles or a lemon tart (I love lemons so went with the tart while he got the profiteroles).  

The soup was amazing.  Seafood corn chowder.  Very rich and delicious.  I think my bf was jealous, but he wasn't going to say anything about it.  The entree was phenomenal.  Lately, all the short ribs I have had were super fatty, greasy piles of meat, and this one was fairly lean and just falling apart.  It was served with cauliflower puree, bacon, and a few vegetables.  The cheeses were to die for.  I could go back here on any trip to Vegas just to get some cheese.  We also got some prosciutto with the cheese and some sweet and spicy almonds.  The almonds were quite tasty, and the meat was divine.  The cheeses were served with fresh honeycomb and date puree, both of which went well with the cheese selection.  I also got some sweet wine to go with it, and it was amazing.  The ages port was also one of the best ports my bf has ever had.  The desserts were tasty, but not spectacular.  The two best things were the cheese and the short rib.

The service was great too.  Always attentive, and our water glasses were constantly being filled.  I'd recommend this place to anyone, especially if they are doing a Price Fixe event!",t8aJIHxkutRlWMRNSvpq6w,0,0,5,ajDAorMgkJiWoF0GNIs-3w

1. Proximity to the strip.  It's right by the Palazzo entrance.  Easy for us to run out and see the fireworks in 30 seconds.   

2.  They were serving the a la carte menu unlike a lot of other restaurants that night doing some $250+ per person prix fixe bs.  I'd rather just do the full meal deal at Joel Robuchon instead paying that kind of money for overpriced NYE menus at Comme Ca, Koi or holy crap god forbid Sugar Factory.  

3.  STEAK

Our starters were the ""Onion Soup Gratinee"" and the ""Pan Seared French Rougie Foie Gras"".  The soup was a 3 out of 5.  We prefer our onion soups a little more robust and wine flavored where this was kind of sweet.  It was a hearty portion as it should be for $10 but not worth ordering again.  

The foie gras on the other hand was deeeeeelicious.  It was accompanied by caramelized red onion, candied apples and balsamic reduction.  There's just something about the fatty and unique flavor of the duck liver with fruit that I can't get enough of.  Restaurants in Vegas like Andre's and Gordon Ramsay Steak do it really well and this was right up there.  

For the entree, we chose not to mess around and just went with the 32 oz porterhouse for two prepared rare.  They served it tableside and it came with roasted rosemary potatoes, fricassee of baby turnips, sauce Bordelaise, onions & carrots.  We asked to keep the bone as always either in hopes of being ambitious a few days later and using it to make beef noodle soup at home or just gnawing at the bone while walking down the street like a couple of insane canines later in the evening.

The steak was very good.  32 oz is a monster cut and we were only able to finish half and box the rest.  I actually preferred the sirloin side over the filet this time around which was kind of surprising for me.

All in all a very solid choice for steak but still not close to the best steaks in their own building thanks to Mr. Batali and Mr. Puck.  I would come back here for happy hour and also when it's warmer to dine outdoors.",8DEyKVyplnOcSKx39vatbg,13,9,4,zG54BglhCnIMmRfiv1-10Q

CHOCOLATE MOUSSE - Chocolate Toffee Cookie. This was delicious.  Very light, not too rich or dark.  Yummy!  The cookie was good too.

We didn't really need to look far at other high end restaurants as Morel's and another steak house was in the hotel. Morel's didn't have high reviews but I based my decision on the posted Yelp pictures. 

I made a reservation through Open Table but didn't really need make a reservation for Saturday night dinner on the long Memorial Day weekend (it wasn't that packed). 

Experience and atmosphere was nice. Patio seating is available that overlooks Las Vegas Blvd and Treasure Island/Wynn/the mall (corner view). The service was awesome and the food was delicious. We had steaks, pasta and the raw oysters. A plus was that Morel's had a children's menu!! SCORE! You seldom have children's menus at high end places, this helped out as I had my young son with me. Raw oysters ($20 for 1/2 dozen) was super fresh and tasty. My ""prime"" rib eye Bordelaise was good ($66) but a bit over cooked, I asked for medium rare and it was almost medium. Mom's linguini clams was good, the pasta sauce was perfect for dipping the bread and Morel's added tons of clam.

They cooked the steak perfectly (for me) and I made a valiant effort to conquer the steak. It was the cheeses that undid me. If I just avoided the appetizers (or get a smaller steak!)

Got the ribeye, medium rare.  It was dry and flavorless.  Not overcooked, but an average piece of meat.  Maybe because it was a Weds night and the place was seriously dead, maybe 5 tables taken?

And notice the knife they give you, its not serrated, which makes cutting like feel like your sawing a wild game instead of aged steak.

And shouldn't this place have steak fritte.  These guys should go the simple route.

5650426,2012-06-08,0,O_C-2kZMHGnq3ZDL_OaG6Q,"5-star review for LUNCH ONLY!
I'm not a huge fan of their dinner, to be honest (mostly because there are so many other better options in this fabulous city).

My family and I make it a point to dine here for one of our lunches every time we travel to Vegas, which is luckily 5 or so times a year. They have a seasonal menu, but they generally keep their best-sellers. They also have a splendid brunch menu, and with this they serve mini donuts/beignets of a sort, rolled in sugar; when warm, these are like starting the meal with dessert (uh, who said that's a bad thing?)

So, without further ado, I have three extremely crucial words for you: GET.THE.QUICHE. This is like no other quiche I have had in my life (and I've had my share). It's like they imported it right out of France, because this is to a T exactly how they make it in le Paris. It isn't thick to where the egg takes control over your taste buds...it's so airy and fluffy, but still has the slightest crisp on the outside layer-- you essentially won't have to chew this dish because it's so creamy and fluffy. Embedded throughout this piece of absolute heaven is applewood smoked bacon (the thick cut kind!), perfectly carmelized onions, and a cheese, possibly Gruyere? Deceivingly light, this is one rich piece quiche. It comes with choice of pommes frites or salad, and the fries are on par with some of the better thin fries I've ever had. 

Now, for the other options (almost overshadowed by the masterpieceofquiche). The Croque Monsieur is also quite tasty and has just the right amount of ham-layering to cheese ratio. My dad frequently gets the omelets  and they are also worth ordering if you're looking for a more savory option. On normal days, they serve some bread (conjoined twin pieces) with a pesto-like dipping sauce (we also get butter with the Hawaiian sea salt sprinkled across the top as that's what they used to serve..you'll have to request it, probably). 

For dessert, you cannot steer wrong from the sorbet/ice cream selections. With a wiiiide array of flavors, you can get three scoops served in a cross-cookie type of concoction alongside a dollop of whipped cream and strawberry slices. Try the vanilla almond ice cream and the coconut sorbet...Mmmm, palate-cleansing after a flawless meal.  

Steve used to be their best waiter, but he no longer works there. Nevertheless, we've never had any issues with their lunchtime service. GOOO here!",qT4Tnxde6kNokU5G4Fhv4A,2,0,5,aU5I_EpSzDlr2KyAaSJ6YA

I had the crisp skin Scottish salmon with baby carrots and lentil, it was very delicious.  Tried the petit cut filet mignon and melted like butter in my mouth.

I'm not a big fan of French food because I've had bouchon and mon ami gabi here in Vegas and both was really bad. No flavor and oily. I decided to give this place a shot with no expectations and it wasn't as bad as I thought. 

I had lunch here with my boyfriend and his parents, so we ordered family style. 

Niçoise Salad- first time ever trying a French salad and this was so good. The Niçoise salad had seared yellowfin and anchovies with quail egg dressed with summer vinaigrette. I was completely taken by surprise and it was way better than my Cobb Salad. 4/5

Flat iron steak & frites. Frites are fries, just a fancier way of saying it I guess. They were fried to crisp perfection and not too overdone. Steak was surprisingly good. Not the best but not bad coming from a French spot. It was a light season of a simple recipe of rosemary and salt and pepper with a nice tender. 4/5 

Seafood Platter- west coast oysters, dungness crab claws, and humongous cocktail shrimp. Great appetizer if you're willing to dish out for it. Oysters were okay.. Not sweet as I expected since it's suppose to be. Other than that, everything else was delicious, even the Italian aioli they made in house for the crab was great. 4/5

Seared Scallops with Cous Cous- perfectly Sears scallops. Light white butter sauce. Not a fan of Cous Cous though. Scallops would've been good either by itself or accompanied with a greenie. 
3.5/5

Seafood Fettuccini- light pasta dish. Clams, shrimp, mussel, garlic, and Chardonnay white sauce. My Boyfriend didn't like it because he likes creamy based sauce. This dish isn't meant to be like those heavy Italian dishes. Not bad but not omg good.  3/5 

Cobb Salad- huge portion. Couldn't finish. But the dressing had WAY too much vinegar. 2/5 

Overall this place was good. But if it weren't for the $150 Credit, i wouldn't come back because it's really expensive.",5M1Kjx4seOmwODw4XZFTPg,1,0,4,A9AE-91VA7RF_oc9rT9Vug

It comes in a small ceramic pot bubbling with the cheese melted over the bread on top of the oniony soup. Very delicate flavor and not at all salty. - Mushroom & Lentils Soup - Soup of the Day - soft lentils with mushrooms - dad liked it! - Mushrooms and Gruyere Crêpes - 2 huge crêpes smothered with creamy mushrooms. So delicious! - Short Rib Sandwich with green salad - very tasty short rib that you can cut with a fork! - Fish & Chips - Beautiful fish cooked in a light batter with home made yellow tartar sauce. Chips are thin strips of potato deep fried. Our order was a little slow in coming out after the soups came out. After waiting 25 minutes or so, our waiter finally reassured that our entrées were coming out. Most of the dishes that were leaving the kitchen were breakfast plates. Ours was more of lunch items.

We were initially presented with a salty Olive Tapenade, butter with Hawaiian Sea Salt, and delicious soft warm rolls.  Quickly following were Wild Caught Prawns that were cold and meaty, and a Horseradishy Cocktail Sauce.  My other preliminary course was a crock of excellent sweet Onion Soup Gratinee with a large and well-deconstructed crouton and well-melted Comte and Gruyere Cheeses.

Both of us then enjoyed the night's featured Surf & Turf Special of Filet and Half-Lobster.  We each received a very nice lobster half and a nicely seasoned 8 oz. Filet with little char cooked perfectly medium rare as ordered.  The lobster meat was sweet dipped in either drawn butter or specially requested Buerre Blanc, and ran out just a few bites ahead of the Filet.  Excellent whipped Mashed Potatoes accompanied the combo entree.  Three flavored sea salts were also provided: Black Hawaiian Sea Salt, Smoked Black Sea Salt, and Red Hawaiian Sea Salt.

We finished with very good Classic Profiteroles served with Candied Vanilla Almond Ice Cream and Malted Chocolate Sauce.  I just wish there had been more ice cream.

Our booth back was hard but seating was otherwise comfortable, with a nice cushioned bottom.  Sensually appealing fine art adorned several walls.

However, the quiche Lorraine was unsavory, gelatinous even.. and when we asked for the server to have them cook it a bit further, she came back and told me that the chef said, ""that's how he makes it."" Then, after all, the server also ""miscalculated"" our payment, and kept cash from us. A little coaching for their team would be helpful. When we spoke to the manager, he was dismissive, and inconsiderate. We WILL NOT be back.",nVK00oKUk4asStkaOR09uw,0,0,2,noJ_8wkKzeb_5z5b9oHLfA

Terrace is pretty (get a table with an umbrella!). Wish they didn't allow smoking out there.,K216wWvJYRzT1AHO4C0kWw,0,0,4,YaSrcf3EF1qKrJJvkbpADA

Chelsea and Mohammed both talked to us about wine, scotch and food. 
I got a nice Yamasaki, which the bartender Mohammed seemed to know a lot about. He spoke to us about the history of and other great recommendations. Then with dinner had a bottle of wine, which the Som recommend, but for the life of me I could not remember the name.
Food came out, which was ok, had the petite fillet, which was cooked right. But honestly it's not a Gallagher's steak. 
The Brussels sprouts were cooked too much for my taste, then we finished dinner with a nice Suntory Whiskey Toki and good laughs with the bartenders! 
Again the bar is where it's at for this place.
Would really recommend again if these guys are working!",9Q56krOx55gTdGsmQY-pqw,0,0,4,GfzNWGJ4Yx1hRhxKhAB7uQ

Steak Tartare was maybe worst thing I have ever eaten in Las Vegas. Strip that another guest had was fair at best. Food is definitely not their strong suit. Left YardBird where we'd eaten the night before to try this place and was really disappointed to spend money on food here when we were at a perfectly good place. Have a drink here, but save the money on food and go somewhere else...food terrible.",hdwv3-8g6oyMLTyyr0oYGg,0,0,2,AnLjWywgeFcHy-0JSlxOOw

I ordered two Kettle One Martinis with olives
The service was slow but what the heck
The martinis were $18 each which I get, they have tremendous overhead.
But when the bill came I noticed there was a $6.00 charge for for food
I asked the manager what this food cost was and I almost fell out of my chair when he said it is for the olives.
I have managed restaurants and bars and have travelled the world,  and have never been charged for olives in a Martini.
Wow. Wow Wow
I will never ever see them again
Beware they may charge you for bread with your dinner
Joke
Freaking joke!",2JD0fDgWf_XHbR-H86jDWQ,0,0,1,2HqML-qjBs0EVGGfgjU5Nw

It was around 4pm on a Monday and we were able to go to patio seating easily, though we needed the host to seat us, and they needed to take our name down as a reservation. I got the Grimlet, it was refreshing - came in a glass. I guess I was expecting it to come in a bronze cup thing, though I had seen customers at the next table with one.  My friend had a salad and it was a small portion, but looked delicious, I ordered the calamari, which was $20.00.  It was good, but not spectacular like I had hoped. The server was gracious and so seemed the rest of staff. 2 drinks and two side dishes later, bill came out to be approximately $80.00 (incl. a $15 tip).  So, I'd say it if wasn't for the experience and patio view, I wouldn't spend that much for a restaurant again.",TXbIl_9ogHdALGlqYl3NvA,0,0,4,HAc0uZbNcU6vWIZmTSEGwQ

Since we were watching a show that ended at 8:45, we didn't have many options. Plus Morels was also the only place that had absolutely no wait time. In fact, I think I only saw a handful of tables that were occupied, which at first hand doesn't look like a good sign. We look pass that and since my date had never been here either, we decided to stay. The server was very nice and helpful trying to guide us through the menu pointing out the right things to choose from. We ended up splitting a salad and a steak, and also got the mac & Cheese, you can not forget about the mac and cheese. Next time I am in Vegas I will absolutely be back here just for the mac and cheese even if I am not in the mood for a steak. The steak was really good and they even carved it for us. They brought out three different types of salt to rub on the steak but I preferred it without the salt. it didn't really need anything. Just make sure you get it cooked medium. The salad is where I have to knock off a star though. There was three pieces of lettuce and a few very small chopped cucumbers and a couple very very small shrimps in there. Wish I had taken a picture to show the size. For the price of the salad, you'd expect a nice fulfilling salad. I think I will skip it next time and recommend others skipping it as well. Other then that, everything was great, it is a romantic restaurant so definitely a place you would take a date. The prices are on the higher end, but I don't mind spending money on good food and good alcohol. Unfortunately, we had no additional room for any dessert, but maybe next time since The Venetian is my go to hotel to stay at.",oHKuvhYdT9O5i1msyamzGA,0,0,4,ty-vp1750sI8RtWpg_C2wQ

Ignored us a dozen times walking right past us after taking our menus without asking if we were ready to order, never asked us how the food was probably because we had to flag down another server with arms full of dirty plates (taking care of her own party of 8!!) who was nice enough to take our order.  He never apologized or got any better.  
Next: table was not ready when they tried to seat us, he never brought utensils/napkins (had to be brought after the food was served) and the poor guy had 4 tables.  The food was actually good, however he blamed his poor service on the bartender and the kitchen being backed up. 


We will pass on this restaurant next time",j0_XdHvT3PjLqRqd2foehQ,0,0,2,gJhiW15oLPxErR8RNGOmOw
