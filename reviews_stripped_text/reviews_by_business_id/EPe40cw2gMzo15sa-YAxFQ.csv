Fresh food as well so it is the best place if you are looking for healthy food after the gym. Highly recommend for you guys to try it. I had Island Style Teri Chicken and it was so good with mixed veggies and spinach.,8WkVB5omBN7nM2ZwAFMjaQ,0,0,5,CzYvhg4LezkUyeDxxSkxwg

The teriyaki tri tip is probably my favorite, it is so good! I'd like to also comment on how affordable it is. Compared to other healthy cafes, it is a fraction of the cost. If you're looking for some good clean eats- definitely give this place a try, you won't regret it.",54QlTVJi8uzmk5nz0uFFNA,1,0,5,we7SDNtlykP0an3OO6zhhg
