352829,2015-06-14,0,I2mnA_OCnIdua0FhW03cUw,"Maybe it's just me... But i thought it was a little pricey for the amount of chicken tikka masala (plus small side rice). I ordered with no spice since I was also feeding a toddler. It was really sweet. I wasn't too fond of it. I'll try with the usual spicy next time for the real taste. To be honest, I've had better, tastier non-spicy tikka masala elsewhere. I'll still come back to try other dishes.

Since this is an ""express take-out"" I was expecting it to be that, with food made, laid out and ready for the staff to scoop into an entree box... But it's not.

The place was really hot. No AC. Maybe they're still working on it? It felt better standing outside. Small place, not many choices on the menu. The cashier/waiter/cook was nice. Doors didn't open on time at the hour. I had to call after giving them a few mins. They could improve presentation of the place by blocking the very open view leading to the back. But it's good to see the cook washing his hands after handling money :)",9Kgz60mivLD10Xrs5WB5Zw,1,0,3,Z1HdHoj6qk3FdPFlyxuFwA
610692,2015-09-09,0,I2mnA_OCnIdua0FhW03cUw,This place is awful. Food was expensive and flavorless. I was tricked by the 5 star reviews and deeply regret wasting money at this place. I only hope that I don't also get food poisoning. Only time will tell. Worst Indian food in Vegas and worst I've ever had.,WmzpIArBlwuLn7KiKtP_hg,1,0,1,TptNxxIgxfa5HPraZOZxoQ
868583,2016-02-13,0,I2mnA_OCnIdua0FhW03cUw,Way overpriced and the food is very bland. Definitely won't be ordering from here again. I had the lamb vindaloo and it was borderline watery. It was takeout so I tried salting it but even salt couldn't make it that appetizing. I also had garlic naan with papadam with mango chutney and achar. Altogether my bill was $30. If you want good Indian food go down the road to Saffron. It's more affordable and lots of more flavor.,3XgscAzLsjY2EaUqu_GyUw,0,0,2,L9y0uT93L5WbtZXknB4K1g
1102986,2016-06-18,0,I2mnA_OCnIdua0FhW03cUw,"I lean closer to 3.5 stars then 4, but they don't give you that option. 

I honestly, will get food to go again if I don't feel like driving across town, to go eat in at an Indian restaurant. 

Chicken tikka masala, and chicken curry was actually really good. 

We asked for extra rice, because the rice portions are small. However, we had enough leftovers for two more meals the next day. 

There are only two negatives which is why I lean more towards 3.5 stars. 

1. The naan was very disappointing. It had good flavor, but for my taste needed more garlic. It was also very rubbery, dry, and a little burnt. They need to work a little better on their naan.

2. For take out, and quick express Indian food it is a little pricy. For one order of chicken tikka masala, chicken curry, naan, and extra rice cost us about $45.00. I think it was worth it, but I feel for a take out restaurant it should be a little less in price. 

Overall, I definitely recommend those two dishes if you are craving Indian food in the Centennial area, and don't feel like eating in anywhere or driving far.",n2HyyuQ18NnsB2slsxt37Q,5,0,4,xfm6O9T1ElcVXJ6_l7D0VA
1474225,2015-07-02,0,I2mnA_OCnIdua0FhW03cUw,"Getting the food took quite a bit longer than than they said it would be, and it was extremely hot waiting inside. 

The food was really delicious, but very pricey. The chicken tikka masala was a container full of sauce with a few small chunks of chicken and a small container of rice. I'd have expected to pay under $10 for that amount. Maybe the lunch specials are where it's at!",gRVwhMOLdosrz2KY932hoA,1,0,3,IeLOXx4zlc3o9vtU3LyLCQ
1594007,2016-04-12,0,I2mnA_OCnIdua0FhW03cUw,I love Indian food but the price for take out is not worthy for me to return.  The tikka masala is delicious but they give you too little rice and then ask if you would like more rice at a crazy price added to the already high price!   The take out containers they use melt inside your food so half the top of the rice we had to throw away!  I am very disappointed with the price and quantity and quality of their cheap plastic containers!  Most likely not returning unless they change!,3nm5ssIwcfHn8J0318Hsjw,2,0,3,Up76ZP5rS8xxvMxHwAeSbA
1707953,2015-10-28,0,I2mnA_OCnIdua0FhW03cUw,"The food was delicious. I had the chicken tikka masala, potatoe cakes with a yogurt sauce and the regular nan. The chicken comes with rice. It was enough food for me to share with my mom and have some left over for work the next day. I ordered medium heat on the curry and that was quiet spicy (and I can handle spicy). It was a bit a pricey for one order of food but filled my Indian food craving.",9peRQNqhd_uqt-Rh83zwjw,0,0,4,ycv3riWkBenWkInwil75Fg

2618229,2015-12-24,2,I2mnA_OCnIdua0FhW03cUw,"I have had the opportunity to try several of the Vegetarian dishes from Mantra Masala and have not tasted one I did not like.  I might prefer one over another but all of them are loaded with flavor that keep me wanting to explore the rest of the menu.  

One of my favorites is the Channa Masala.  This dish is made with garbonzo beans, tomato, potato, onion and flavored with roasted cumin.  I cannot get enough of this dish, I would eat this every day.  The Channa is served with a side of rice but the portion of this dish for this price can easily feed two people.  
I have also tried Aloo Gobi...very delicious with the cauliflower I my favorite way to eat this vegetable now.  The Mutter Paneer is also the best way to eat peas besides chicken pot pie.  The Dewane Handi is also very flavorful.  Any one of these dishes will tantalize your taste buds.  

I am a new fan of Mantra Masala from the first dish I tasted it keeps me coming back to try something else.  This location is a takeout only location with only two tables for waiting and I am sure they would not mind if you sat enjoyed right in the small dining area.  I hear they have a fine dining location in the southwest on Warm Springs and Durango which I have not visited but might make the pilgrimage soon to pay my respects to the chef who creates this authentic Indian Cuisine.  

Do not forget to get the fresh made Nan bread.  The Garlic Cilantro Nan is amazing.  The mint sauce that accompanies this traditional food is so refreshing and unique I could drink it by the gallon.  

I was very satisfied with my visits to Mantra Masala.  This take out only location is very convenient for me to call in an order and pick it up after the long drive home from work.",8fsZcLADFrPTbGrFqMACpg,5,2,5,L3fNKsGhnwA5nO2g7HhnGQ
2789090,2016-02-27,0,I2mnA_OCnIdua0FhW03cUw,"I had the Mantra Masala Mixed Grill and my wife ordered the Mutter Paneer. The spices used for both dishes were excellent. The Garlic Nan was very flavorful along with the tamarind sauce they give you. The one downfall to this place are the prices - pretty high in price for a take-out restaurant. When I'm in the mood for Indian food again, chances are I'll go to a sit-in restaurant since they at least give water to drink while you wait. Plus I wouldn't feel as bad paying more to be served. Recommend dropping the prices to obtain more business. HINT: Don't always expect top, quality cuisine from a take-out joint...I guess that's why I liked this place? Or maybe it was just that good...",M0QwqtKi6jQI45IeJjKaeg,1,0,4,QKqf_W7tZst5eaXY5g5fWw
2907035,2016-07-30,0,I2mnA_OCnIdua0FhW03cUw,I love the food here and I bring my family and friends  every chance I get. Hopefully they will make this place a sit down restaurant rather than a to go place but the food is ready in a reasonable amount of time.

3073204,2016-08-11,0,I2mnA_OCnIdua0FhW03cUw,"I really wanted to LOVE this place.... I really did... but after we placed our order of two entrees and an appetizer, and it came to $50... I was done with place....

You cannot eat here, which is no biggie, but theres only two tables for people to sit and eat at if they wanted to, or wait for their food. 

The entrees come with rice but it isnt even enough.. There aren't enough portions for the price you pay.. It would have been cheaper for me to buy and make the food on my own at home.. and it would taste better! 

There is WAY too much cilantro in the food, in every single dish... I got 4 small mussels in my mussels appetizer.. The lamb was mealy in my lamb manta.  I wanted to finish my food just because of how much I paid for it, but it doesn't taste good.... 

One thing too, when we got home, none of the food bowls were labeled so we had to do taste tests to figure out whose was whose instead of just taking a second and writing on the lid what what was... 

I wanted so badly to love this place but the price, the food, the lack of rice and portions etc.. I just can't... I will take the menu though, and look up the recipes and make them at home so that is a good thing? 

I hope that this place gets better because i want to give it a second try but not for the price!!! For $50, I expected as much food as I get at the chinese restaurant for $30 across the street!",-vzpBcNM6cwqnzLprHECmg,4,0,2,MWUClw9KLmjgcK_CZSXCHQ
3692985,2015-09-27,0,I2mnA_OCnIdua0FhW03cUw,Worst Indian food I've ever eaten. Had Lamb Korma and Lamb Vindaloo. Both dishes were served with super tough lamb and the flavors were just not good. The garlic naan was stale and some pieces were rock hard. Spent $50 on a meal and ended up throwing it away and eating popcorn for dinner. This place is a joke.

4682820,2015-05-23,0,I2mnA_OCnIdua0FhW03cUw,"My wife and I debated on getting separate meals because of the $15 per entree cost just to try someplace new. I'm glad we ended up just sharing because splitting the Garlic Nan and Chicken Tikki Masala was just enough to satisfy the both of us for lunch. The bread is a MUST, especially with the soup. Our final bill was just over $19 but I have absolutely no complaints. Very happy that we decided to give it a shot.

I called in the order and drove over to pick it up. The inside of the restaurant must have been 85 degrees inside. It was so hot that I was literally soaked with sweat after waiting a mere 4 minutes for my order. How can a place that hot be sanitary? The garlic Naan was meh ...okay. I wouldn't say it's any better than the kind you can buy at trader Joe's. The Tikka Masala chicken had great creamy flavor and would've been perfect if the cheap Styrofoam it was in didn't break inside the bag and spill. The rice was was cooked as it should be, nothing special. The price was high, another negative.",erJ1HQwavgZx4996SMIxrA,7,2,3,NSjXsSPlVwTeeygBgdM7rQ

All of them are just okay, not great and not bad. The chicken was dry and the regular Nan was kind of burned. I definitely had better Indian food in many other restaurants. The food alone probably deserves 3 stars but the value probably is right about 2 stars. For the price that they charged I expected much better food than what I got.
I probably won't be back.",lW9B0GUMNjjdmo7JU3vRWg,3,0,2,TYrVDGWAog54HIbizQm4iQ

The price for the chicken tikka masala (14.95) is what I usually pay at a sit down Indian restaurant with linens on the table.  I figured that, if the food was good, the price would be worth it but the food was not good! The chicken was not all white meat and it was gristle filled with chunks of fat attached! The sauce was not well cooked so it separated into a watery mess when I put it over rice and on a dish at home (think undercooked spaghetti sauce!).  The sauce was also heavy on the tomatoes and very light in the Indian spices! The rice was not jasmine rice but some yellow rice out of a package.  In short, this place is way over priced and under spiced! It is too bad because they could do a great business if only they took care and produced a higher quality product. As it stands, this food was a giant rip-off!  Save your money...",vl3xdjqA_0o_-ZG_mmqrqw,1,0,1,uBuCp5786w-axrFxSurMvA
