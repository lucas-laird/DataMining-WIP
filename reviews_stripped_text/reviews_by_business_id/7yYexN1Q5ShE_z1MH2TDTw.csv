2068,2016-08-21,0,7yYexN1Q5ShE_z1MH2TDTw,Awful customer service. Lady was rude when we got there. Left us standing at the counter to order for five minutes. Came back and didn't ask if we were ready or  anything. When we finally got our food my burger the animal was over cooked and my oldest son's(10) chicken basket was under cooked. Needless to say he got food poisoning. My older brother recommended this joint. I was not impressed either by the certificates they had displayed from 5-6 years ago. I will not return ever.,uypTljdvpVpU4A_3eRRmUQ,1,0,1,4do95uO6Xi9Z9l5kHrDUSw

The worst part is it smelled if sewage and the shack is run down in need of maintenance. Customer service is horrible. The cashier  stepped away when I was waiting to order snd was in the back on the phone yelling and cussing. The cook finally came and took order.

The shake was described as a custard ice cream shake but it tasted like crushed ice-milk with that consistency too. If thats a  custard milkshake, which I have eaten, then im a blonde lol...
On the plus side was that they put a lot of bacon on the bacon cheese fries. But, thats about it. Needless to say, im never ordering from this place again.",eKN_yPlQx_8GI_yVKQOYDQ,2,1,2,L90mqS2qhkflum8OOgnluQ

I inform him I have a coupon I purchased for $14 for $20 worth of food. He confusingly looks at me, like it was an inconvenience. He states I have to purchase $30 worth of food to get deal which didn't say on coupon. We ended  spending $17 more than expected. When asked about food recommendation, counter person read menu items & provided no help. The music playing & odd fellow reminded us of a Quentin Tarantino movie. We relocated to seats outside. It took about 20 mins
to get garlic remano fries, pastrami melt, pastrami burger & root beer float. All items were large & burger single patty. You would think odd fellow would tell us it was way too much food for us but instead he provided no insight or details. We did not even youch burger & had more than half of fries left. After eating, he oddly offered cab which we already called for. Overall, food was good & don't mind hole in wall experience just didn't appreciate service!!

My experience here was one of the worst in Las Vegas. The pastrami is mediocre at best. It is extremely salty. I assume this is because it is fried in the same grease as the burgers and the mixture causes additional salt to be added. The garlic fries don't actually have any chopped garlic or the like. They are bathed in garlic salt. So disappointing. Further, the person working was extremely rude. I asked for some water -- you would think that after spending 17.00 on a burger and fries that they would let you have a cup of water. No, she wanted me to buy a bottle for 2.00. Her excuse was that they had no filter so they could not serve tap water. Overall, avoiding this place will save you disappointment and 20.00+ dollars per person. Lots of better places to eat.",Xmbg0lUpmxKFiB0teo94EQ,1,0,2,CFijqB5FED5kLFEmATQ29w

Wow where to begin... As soon as we walked in this place smelled of sewage!!! The only one older  Hispanic lady working, very rudely said something happened... Ok things happen...

We order 1 sandwich, ranch fries, and 1 custard prep shake. Mind you we are the only customers for about 10min. She hadn't even begun our order. Now a car pulls up in the drive through, they order. We go outside because we can't stand the smell of sewer... I come back in about 35min later, I see she's running around the kitchen, still just only me and the 1 drive thru client... Now about 45min later, I finally ask what's going on. She (the older Hispanic lady) very rudely, almost yelling at me says I should wait more... 

Close to an hour later, we get our order, I see she hands 1 sandwich to the drive through order an then ours... It took this lady 50+ minutes to make 2 sandwiches, 1 fries, 1 shake... 

Shake was as thin n blended as a milk or even water, the fries were so so so freaking old it almost made u throw up...

The onion rings and garlic fries were good. However, there is no way that the onion rings are beer-battered. Also, 20 minutes after eating half of the chipotle burger I began to feel sick.

106623,2011-09-21,0,7yYexN1Q5ShE_z1MH2TDTw,"Whew, I think I finally recovered from eating here yesterday! Three of us split the Three Squared Fry and did not finish it. This thing is out of this world, even bigger than the last time three of us hit it. Mountains of fries, chili, bacon, cheese, 3 eggs and a whole lot of other stuff! At $16.99 it might be their most expensive item but the price is right if you're sharing. 

Even better than the fries are the custard shakes, so so tasty! The small is a whopping $4.99 but you do get 20oz which is plenty. If there is any left over after filling your cup, Brian the owner will probably top you off for free. He is sort of a goofy dude and thinks pretty highly of his food, but he is doing something right as this place has survived longer than any other eatery in this little shack. 

The wait takes a while so I wouldn't recommend using the drive through.  The inside is small and not exactly clean but the food would probably kill you before any of the dirt, and the two A/C units haphazardly stuck in the wall do keep the place nice and cool.",uj4iopBWA0RjpqoJ5xz_vQ,0,1,4,b1NJEOaJOdodtIAMr27X1Q
124281,2012-11-08,0,7yYexN1Q5ShE_z1MH2TDTw,"There's a trio of burger locations in the East Tropicana area of town that are kind of lumped together as classic, 'must have' places to try. I have already visited and been pleasantly surprised by The Dispensary Lounge and The Badger Caf√©, it was only a matter of time before I visited Sammy's LA Pastrami & Burgers. I've received plenty of comments on the three, and have equally read plenty about them on the internet. So after finally closing out the set, how does Sammy's stack up with the rest?

Sammy's has two locations in town, the aforementioned East Side location, and another on the west side of town also near Tropicana. Both locations are basically small shacks, and I was completely surprised to discover that there was actual seating inside the building for customers. The menu has a large amount of completely unhealthy-sounding items like sandwiches, fries, burgers and hot dogs all with an insane amount of toppings you may not expect or just question how they would all fit. This is definitely not the place to visit if you want just a plain burger and fries, as this is clearly not their approach. Kind of reminded me of Rambo's Kitchen actually.

After much deliberation I decided to go with the steak burger: a single patty topped with ribeye steak, grilled onion, bacon, provolone cheese and steak sauce. What came out was just as expected: huge and messy. For such an insanely complicated burger and toppings, the bun is surprisingly well proportioned. It was grilled and crispy, yet soft and gooey inside and very tasty. The steak had good flavor, but the Worcestershire-like steak sauce became far too overpowering about halfway through. The onions and cheese were ok, but not too noticeable in all of the meat flavors. The bacon was a bit too hard; it had ok flavor but again was lost with everything else. The actual burger patty had very generic beef flavor and was very dry. You're clearly getting this for the novelty and toppings, and not the patty unlike Sammy's two local rivals which really thrived on the quality of their meat. While some people may like a giant, messy burger with too many toppings, I prefer something a little simpler and dare I say, healthier than this offering. While the flavors were all good, it was a bit much.

The garlic romano fries were decent; the heaps of seasonings on my skinny fries were enough to make my hands even filthier than they already were from the overly sloppy burger. They were good for a while, but by the end when they got cold they weren't really the same. And believe me, even the small is more than enough for one person, and if you're eating them with a burger you won't give them the proper attention while you're trying to handle all your toppings.

My next issue is the cost; sure you're getting quite the serving size and an excessive amount of toppings, but my meal came to $14.78 with burger, fries and drink. If you're strictly comparing this to the other two from this grouping, it's more than double the cost and not in the running. Even not comparing this to the other two, I'm not sure if I would pay this much just because there's too much going on for me. Maybe I'm too much of a burger purist? I like a quality burger, not an attraction with insane toppings, and that's exactly what you get here. If you're into extravagant toppings, by all means visit Sammy's, but if you're looking for just a quality burger at an amazing price, either The Dispensary Lounge or The Badger Caf√© are your best bets in this grouping.",0G9BcXSQscv_GnhlNwFfjw,1,0,2,42d-9mAfIyTN8mFsU9JtaA

The food here is pretty damn tasty overall, but because of the attitude I received this last time. Sammy's is pretty pricy, but worth it, most of the time. This last time I ordered two of there standard small pastrami sandwiches and a large drink. After the guy at the counter finally got around to taking my order and giving me attitude because I was looking at other menu items, it took him another five minutes to give me my drink. This may not seem like a long time except that there were no other customers, inside or in the drive thru. I asked for easy ice and he filled it to the top with ice. When my sandwiches arrived, they were a bit small. I get more meat at Subway. At $24 for two sandwiches and a drink, I expect more. Other customers came in and got the same attitude, some left. I've been to Sammy's several times and had great experiences, especially when the owner is working. He loves his business and it shows in his enthusiasm. I'll be back, buy if that same guy is working, I'll turn around and walk out.",-gQZ1BfxbXEN8XuoYBJd2g,1,0,3,t8lVDg5jWJqgsxsST8z_Rw

Unfortunately I""m not a pastrami fan so I can't comment on it's namesake, but I can say that I am a big ass bacon cheeseburger fan.  That is one of the burgers on their menu. It's dinner, then breakfast, and even sometimes lunch the next day.  Are you ready for this?   1, or 2 if your up for it, 1/2 lb burger patties, 1/4 lb cheddar cheese, 12(TWELVE(A DOZEN)) strips of bacon in between a bun.  Epic Meal Time would be proud of this burger.  8.49.  or 10.99 for a double.  

Ok so my second favorite burger is the italian.  It's a couple patties, about 1/4 to 1/2 lb of sliced italian beef, white cheese, and their oh so good giardiniera.  Under 10 bucks.

Their fries are really good as well. Lots of seasoning, and some are even meals themselves.  They got homemade lemonades, shakes, teas, they even got shaved ice.

I've been inside to order once and the guy behind the counter is really cool.  And if you're gonna hit the drive thru, you can call first and have it ready because everything takes a bit to prepare.

I think I might stop later today and try the zombie burger.",0jh6FM1kd6ecYs1ESjFZKA,0,1,4,hs9A_mElgOv40i5_W9Ctiw

425616,2017-01-09,0,7yYexN1Q5ShE_z1MH2TDTw,"OK, so I went based on the hype and the video online. I will talk about the customer service and the food.  First the food. I was alone and I ordered a pastrami sandwich and an order of onion rings.The pastrami was average, at best, and the onion rings were soggy. I won't mention another restaurant in my review here because I think that is rude, but there is a chain of Pastrami places in the LA area where I live and their Pastrami is far more flavorful. Sure, Sammy's gives you a lot of Pastrami. But it is a lot of very average pastrami. I could order two sandwiches at the LA chain, get more pastrami that tastes better and still pay less than Sammy's sandwich. And there is no excuse for soggy onion rings.

Now, the customer service. It was bad. First, it took 20 minutes to get a simple pastrami sandwich and onion rings. There weren't that many people in front of me, only a few. But 20 minutes for an order does not a fast food place make. While watching the cook, it seemed like she wasn't good at multi-tasking and working ahead, something important for a cook in a place like this. While ordering I was trying to get an idea on size, I asked how big the 10 inch sandwich is and she responded ten inches. Yes, I could figure that out. I thought maybe she could show me. I watched as someone else wanted to change her order and the lady said that because it was in the computer, there was no way to change the order without charging her again. The ipad ordering system was in charge and helping a customer wasn't. Not to mention, when you pay, it asks you if you want a printed receipt, but they don't have a printer. So your only option is an emailed receipt. This place takes their procedures as more important than helping a customer.

Someone I know in the LA area told me she was thinking of driving to Vegas just to try this place, based on the hype.

They kicked out everybody including me I told them that I drove there 20 mins and paid gas and I want to get paid. But who cares!!! If mr bipolar has his episode then people should pay for it!!!

Drive-Thru:
Sammy's L.A. offers walk-in and drive-thru services.  We waited a really long time for our food but looked like only one guy was working the cashier and grill.

The one order of chili fries was enough for us to share and still had plenty leftover to take home. The food was really good and tasty and I really enjoyed it ...and the only reason I'm not giving them a 4 star rating is because the overall appears of this place. It looks run down and somewhat dirty inside. If they were to clean it up and make it look nice it would be a lot more welcoming. I also didn't like the fact that their hour sign indicate that they closed 10pm and the cook was rushing some customers that walked in at 9:12pm and as soon as he handed the people their order, he put up the closed sign on the door and it was only like 930pm...so be sure to call before heading there just in case they decide to close early",duRoYUYWNPqNU1yGqxncYw,0,0,3,oAIi699xzqwnnlpnPokOoQ

We planned on the drive thru and tried calling ahead for faster service. We called four times on the drive over only to have no answer and a voicemail. We pull up in the drive thru, our order is taken and we wait 25mins before we see the worker again. He handed us our food and then wanted to take care of the bill. We had a coupon which he gave us a hard time about and told us we should have given it to him sooner. Well- you should take care of the bill before you give us our food and it gets cold in the car. That was wrong... He took about 5mins after we gave him the coupon to even come back and tell us the new total. We gave him the money and we even received wrong change back. I was hungry and at this point level 10 fuming that we were in a drive thru for what ended up being a half hour for a sandwich. He got a pastrami which he loved, and i got a Philly cheese steak. When looking at the menu and it mentions peppers on a Philly, one will always assume bell peppers because that is the norm. Nope, onions and jalape√±os, not what i expected. They also kept the seeds in which made some bits quite spicy. I will not be ordering that again. Overall, I was more displeased than I can ever recall with a food service. Oh, and at the drive thru wall, there is a sign stating to call ahead for faster service. That would be nice if they would pick up the phone.

669124,2013-12-11,0,7yYexN1Q5ShE_z1MH2TDTw,"I had heard of this place via the Travel channel.  This is for the Tropicana Ave location.

As I looked them up over the net i saw that they delivered.  So since i was on the strip I thought I would call and check to see how far they delivered.  I don't know who answered the line when I called but I asked what was the delivery range? He replied in such broken english that it could not be understood.  I asked again. He replied in the same way with some other words that could not be understood.  At that point I said never mind and hung up.  I then just got in the car with my friends and decided to drive over.  Mind you, this location is very small and back off Tropicana so you have to pay attention when looking for it.  

We decided to go inside and see what the place is like before we order.  Mind you parking is limited.  It was a little after 8pm and they did not close until 10pm.  Walked up to the door and it was locked.  All lights were on but we saw no one inside.   We knocked a few times then saw one person who motioned that we had to go through the drive through.  There was no sign indicating dining room hours. Soooooo we piled back in the car and went around. (Thank goodness we were the only ones there at the time you will see why later) 

We pull around to look at the menu and decide what we wanted. They have a big menu but we all wanted to try the pastrami.  We then pull up to the speaker to notice another sign that said pull up to the window to order. (Really?) We pull up and the guy ask us our order in a heavy accent which sounded very familiar to the person who answered the line when I called.  Note: check the video here on yelp of one of the guys they talk to.  I think this is the guy I am speaking of.  We wanted 5 pastramis with various different things on them and as we ordered he seemed to be in a hurry.  When asked to repeat the order he repeated it incorrectly, so we went over it again.  He said he had it but his english was poor at best and made it difficult for him to communicate what we ordered back to us so we were sure he got what we wanted.  After about 5 mins of trying to be sure he understood what we wanted we canceled one pastrami out of frustration. (I am glad we went to the window to order as it never would have worked through the speaker)  So we waited 20 minutes for it to be complete. Turns out he was the only person there.  You would think that with all the write ups about this place they would have more people working there at prime time.  So when we finally got the food we checked it and he did get the fries incorrect but we decided not to wait and just go on.  By this time there were 3 other cars behind us and I decided to pray for them and the time they had been waiting and would have to wait!!

The pastrami was actually good(the meat was tender with good flavor and bread was soft and good) as were the fries but the frustration of trying to get inside, ordering, and wait made it a less than great experience.  Note: they use a 3rd party service to deliver. They do not deliver themselves and there is a service charge.  Lastly, they ran out of mayo!!!! How do you do that at a burger joint??!! 

I would only go back around lunch time when I could go inside.",9AzckYC_B6wJ45XPY8-KIA,0,0,2,NJfinqLKAnFfEtNiLhIxqw

Parking nearly nonexistent.  16 persons in the dining room is a full house, but they do have outdoor seating.  The area IS slightly on the questionable side, I drove around the surrounding area.) but that doesn't deter me from seeking good food. The ambiance? Well, that also doesn't deter me.

That said, the L.A. pastrami I had, (reg.) was heavy on the pastrami. The only criticism is that it needed to be a bit more peppery. The roll it came on,  a little soggy, dropped my high expectation for this sandwich considering all the rave reviews. Maybe I'm being a little rough, maybe I'm just spoiled having had Better in Los Angeles.  But I want that taste here! Continuing...Plenty of mustard and could have used a few more pickles. Over all this sandwich, out of 10 napkins, this was a sixer.

I think if they use a better roll and pepper up the Pastrami and maybe offer some of those yellow peppers for heat, they might have something.",pi6vmI4MCR52OBuxxJ3Kiw,4,2,3,rLEv_z1gcXnWhXaieA4gjw

Of course I opted for the Pastrami Burger...a triple one! This thing was huge, but very, very delicious! I was so happy that I had a huge smile on my face after the first bite. My buddy and I also ordered the gyro fries, which was basically a gyro sandwich all on top of french fries! That alone was a meal in itself! The portions they serve are huge...and I eat a lot.

I went to the location on Tropicana (as this review is for) and went through the drive through. I should have turned around after seeing how low budget their signs and graphics were (this would turn out to be a reflection of their over all attitude). I then drove up to the window and waited for around 4-6 minutes. I thought they were closed (even though it was 6pm on a weekday) because no one came to the window. I did see other cars and saw some customers walking in the front. Finally a guys comes to the window. He doesn't speak much English. I explained a few times we were ordering 2 reubens one with corn beef and one with pastrami (you have the choice here which is nice). We ordered the fries and onion rings and some drinks too. He just closed the window when I said the drinks. I wasn't sure if he was coming back or got my order or even understood it. He never even told us our total or how long it would take. 

At least 13 minutes passed by while we sat in at the drive up window. I did try yelling a couple times but no one came back to the window. Lucky we were the only car there. After 20 minutes I got out of the car and went in the front door.

There were about 10 people all standing around impatiently and I saw this dirty disgusting kitchen with one guy (fresh over the boarder) working by himself. One couple canceled their order and walked out. He didn't seem to even care. I don't blame this guy since he was working his butt off and was really sweaty (which was dripping all over) and he didn't have any help. Needless to say after I went back in the car and got the food over 1/2 hour had passed probably close to 40 minutes. I asked the worker if he was the only the one and he said in broken English that the owner wouldn't get him any help and told him he can work by himself. 

When we got home both the reubens were very fatty. It was like a dead flesh flavored chewing gum. The lemonade was awesome (the only good part of the meal), the fries were just fried frozen potato sticks, the onion rings were nothing special and everything was way too greasy. They also didn't have any ranch available. The one employee said he had been too busy to make the ranch. 

The owner of the restaurant  should be hung, drawn, and quartered. How dare you leave this poor immigrant by himself in there to fend for himself. This place screams health hazard and disaster all over it. 

This just goes to show you. What you see on TV can be a totally different experience. I do hope the owner(s)/manager(s) get their acts together and makes this place better for the real customer experience.",L8mt1u1DoxH1oA-IQhawbA,0,0,2,lk_wVHcpRbDlSRNT9KH9IA

I liked it enough to purchase additional coupons for it, but I would only go once a month or once every 2 - 3 months.  I live on the West side of town and this is on the East side of town so it wasn't all that convenient..

I had gone the other day after picking up a friend from the airport and when I presented my coupon I was told that as of November 1st, he, the owner was no longer going to accept the coupons.  I said I had more coupons at home.  He said I should bring in what I had and start using them before Nov 1st.   I had 5 more coupons.  

The next day I called him to verify the use of the coupons.  I also asked him, since he wasn't going to be accepting them anymore can I use more than 1 since there was going to be 4 of us going there the next day.  He said, ""one coupon per email per day"".  I said fine.  

Next day rolls around and I bring in 3 friends, he said I wasn't going to be allowed to use them.   He said the rules state 1 coupon per month.  I said but you told me the other day, PLUS I called yesterday.  All he could do was repeat the rules of restaurant.com of one a month.  He said he loses money every time the coupons is used.  After he and I both were repeating each other in frustration, I finally got him to admit, ""well, I changed my mind"".

At that point, my friends who I had also just picked up from the airport started to chime in to tell the owner off.  I was quite embarrassed that this was happening in front of my out of town guests.  (After I had told them what a great place this was for pastrami).

At that point, we decided not to give him our patronage.  I will never be going back there again so his statement can hold true...he will lose money.

I would have been perfectly all right if he did not say to me to bring the rest of the coupons in or to tell me when I called that I wouldn't be able to use them.  NOT for him to tell me AFTER i get there.  How inconsiderate!",wcah6DV2AjuVDacc8Kb-DA,10,1,1,00eLmDJiMvsePbaJMVpY8w

One Lady working cleaning tables and cooking and taking orders she was doing her best but very short handed because of this every plate came out at differant times.  No forks or knives i guess owner was showing up around 5 pm to bring some plastic ones she mentioned.  Bottled water was from local super market and 1/4 of sodas were out.  Obvious this business is not a priority of owner or owners. Pastrami sandwhiches were decent and seasoned fries,  oil was probably not hot enough to cook the onion rings they were soft and not much flavor.    Very limited seating and patio was not set up so if maybe more than two more familys had shown up they wouldnt have a place to sit occupancy of building is max 10-12 .

1st time.... the lady at counter has a horrible attitude, but I figured it was early, they just opened and she hadn't got her day started. I ordered the Original Pastrami dip. The cajun fries, and a large pomegranate lemonade. $20! Wow!!!! Not to mention, She was the only person in the building and it was around lunch time. She continued to take another order before even starting on mine... didn't give me a drink as I waited. It took between 45 minutes to an hour to get my food.... and still NO drink! When I asked, she acted as if I was a bother to her, told me ""1 minute"" while she took another order and started their food. After, now I know was a full hour, and 1/2 my sandwich gone, she gave me a $5 pomegranate lemonade, that was 75% filled with ice. 
2nd time... not too bad of an experience, but for me and my wife... we ate 2 small pastrami sandwiches, shared a small garlic fry, and each had a large lemonade $37 WTF!!! 
3rd time.... we thought we got smart, so we bought the yelp coupon ""$14 for $20 of food. Then, we went to Circle K and got 2 XL sodas for $.79 each.  When we got there the same lady with a shitty attitude said no outside drinks. She said... ""I sell drinks here"" I said, ""We're buying your food, and I don't want 2 Lemonade's for $10 this time"" she rolled her eye's, so my wife just put the drinks in the car. We ordered 2 small pastrami sandwiches and shared a garlic fry. Total was $28. We tried to use the coupon, but she said we had to print it out, and couldn't be redeemed by phone.

The Good: Large portions, good food, personable manager, decent price. I see other people complaining about the fact that the manager talks to them a lot. But, I rather enjoyed having a food buff who likes to chat and keep his customers informed on new and existing product. The homemade tzatziki (for gyros) sauce was delicious. My wife has eaten several Reuben sandwiches from several places and she said this place had the best. Watching the robotic meat slicer was cool.

The Bad: I assume the manager makes bank, so it's a wonder as to why he would want such a small location in such a rough looking part of town. It looks about as small as a taco shack. There are only about 7-8 tables (4 inside, 4 outside). Also, there is no REAL parking lot, we had to park in the back lot of an abandoned building sitting next to it. Both buildings are neighbored by a very crummy looking apartment building with a buncha tweakers and wannabe thugs walking around. I wish the manager would open a NICE locale in Henderson, then we'd go constantly.

We arrived about 11:20 am, and were meeting friends at 12:30 pm on a Thursday.  The time was perfect, a few people came in to pick up orders placed ahead of time, a few people came in and ordered lunch to go, we had our choice of inside tables.  The reviews had already prepared us for service to be a little slow.  Frankly I didn't mind at all, I understand why.  The lady working today was very nice, and when it was our turn at the counter, very attentive.  It is a very small kitchen and if I was the one working in that space, I wouldn't want anyone else in there with me.  It is also why it would be best to work one order at a time, there is not a lot of room to lay out multiple orders in process.  It also means there won't be time for chit chat with a server while you wait, it gave us more time to talk to each other, and we were not rushed about placing the order or eating.  When the food does come out to you, it is worth waiting for.  Portions are more than generous.

This is the newer location.  The original store was opened on Decatur Blvd.  The way we found this restaurant was we were looking for a Dunkin' Donuts but by the time we found one, it was already closed. (Boo!)  Well, we decided to grub somewhere we couldn't find in San Diego and away from the Strip.  

Anyways, we found this place through Yelp!  We walked in and we were greeted by Lou.  Dude was cool, very friendly and helped us out with our questions about the menu.  

Basically, he said everything on the menu comes in two sizes - big and BIGGER!  No lie!!!! Well, this place is definitely not for anyone who is on a diet or who doesn't have an appetite... the portions here are MEAN!!!  Everything is also made fresh... the fries, the burger patties, the pastrami slices...

I ordered the ""Zombie Burger"".  Why do they call it a Zombie Burger? My guess is that after you finish grubbin, you'll be so dayam full you'll be walkin around like a zombie... That's just a hunch, but f*ck, that's how I felt... 

My friends and I also shared an order of 502 Fries... OMG! Delish... 

If I were to compare this to another restaurant I've been to, I would say it is similar to Hodad's in San Diego... but, with a lot more selection on the menu... 

I was definitely satisfied and I would definitely come back here again... After our first visit here, this place has become a ""must visit"" every time we come to Vegas... Cruise by and see for yourself... but make sure you bring your appetite...

BTW, I have a feeling Guy Fieri will be visiting this place soon so we might be seeing this place in Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives... if he does, well, you'll know this place is legit for sure... :)",Jw9-FFeOmTWeznebGY2D0A,2,3,5,sNj2tlSFU_mH2kswoBGuIg

My wife and I shared a pastrami sandwich and the pastrami was tender and flavorful.  One of the best pastrami sandwiches we have had.

We shared the 502 fries and that was delicious.  The chili had great flavor and wasn't too spicy and anything with rib eye steak on it is great.  We couldn't even put a dent in those fries the first time and were eating leftovers for a few days.

My daughter had the chicken fingers and those were cooked well.  They are not processed but fresh tenders that are hand battered.  The batter was crispy and the tenders inside were moist.

My friend got the Philly cheesesteak and his wife got the gyro and both said that the sandwiches were tasty and delicious.

Service was good too.  There was one guy behind the counter that was the register and the cook.  His name was Kevin and he was very friendly and very helpful in navigating the menu.

The ambiance of the restaurant needs some work.  It is a little run down hut with only a few tables inside, six or seven.  When on the street, it is hard to find since the building is so small.  The tables and chairs were old and wobbly.

Burgers got messy. I don't mind messy burgers, it happens... But they didn't have a restroom for customers to wash their hands after. They had a sanitizer dispenser but it was empty and we asked for napkins twice. (They literally gave us 2 napkins each time)

1662817,2016-09-10,1,7yYexN1Q5ShE_z1MH2TDTw,"I went to Sammy's after my friend and I saw it featured on some TV show. I went there years ago, but wasn't too wowed by it to go back or write a review. So, now that it's fresh in my mind, here's my honest review. 

First, I'll start off with the negatives. The shop is small and looks very run down. The drive thru intercom doesn't work and there is a piece of paper covering the menu that says to pull up to the window to order. Seems very ghetto. It could definitely use a facelift. You'd probably think it was closed if it weren't for the giant advertising posters pointing you into the lot. The lot itself is small and parking can become limited very quickly.

If you're going to the drive thru, expect a long wait. I've had to park my car and turn it off both times I've been there. If you see someone sitting at the window already, don't even bother: you'll probably be waiting there forever and they don't have the decency to tell you to move your car so that they may take additional orders. The whole process seems very disorganized.

Despite all of the negatives, however, Sammy's serves up some delicious food and in huge portions! Even if you've got an appetite, I'd order something to share instead of individual plates. It might also ease of the blow of the pricey menu. There have been a lot of complaints about customer service, but the service I received was great.

Overall, Sammy's stinks when it comes to their visual appeal, but if you're willing to wait for a delicious, fatty meal, this is your place.",l--K3xQWVqs93iFhAoEYag,4,0,3,U_SRdiesiLBxpZfFMVCulw

My husband saw the review for this place on the Travel Channel and we made it a point to stop in Las Vegas specifically to give this place a try on our way home to So. Cal. from Lake Powell.  HUGE mistake! My husband had the Pastrami Melt and before even finishing his last bite he had intense stomach cramps (approx. 4:30).  We spent the next two hours waiting for my poor husband who got serious food poisoning. He had not eaten anything since breakfast so we know with 100% certainty it was from the Pastrami Melt. I am not a fan of pastrami so thank goodness I didn't touch the pastrami. 

Aside from the hubby getting sick he didn't feel the Pastrami Melt was any better than others he had eaten elsewhere. The chicken in my chicken sandwich was extremely thin, not even a full chicken breast half. The chicken sandwich at Chick-fil-a is ten times better and less expensive. They won't give you a glass of water (we don't drink soda) but will gladly sell you bottled water. Only good thing was the Garlic Romano Fries. 

Overall the place was quite dirty (floors needed sweeping, tablecloths dirty and torn), very small and extremely hot inside. It's 113 degrees outside and they are too cheap to turn on the A/C??  Oh and no bathroom for customers.

Lets start-off with drinks, As explained to me by the nice lady who took my order apparently their drinks are somewhat pricey-er starting at the $2.79+ range for lemonade however their 'small' cups are actually 24oz which i found pretty awesome despite being mostly ice; That being said after trying their 'Mango Lemonade' i almost wanted to chug a gallon of water, The lemonade was overly sweet with an almost concentrated texture and the quality of the lemons used, tasted more like Key-Limes to me also it didn't appear to have any actual mango presence.

Being from the East-Coast we're used to always having fries with our Gyro's, Its unethical to have it any other way. Needless to say today i was really dissapointed by Sammy's, I'm still trying to figure out what Gyro or Burger place actually sells Gyros without fries? Its simply unorthodox specially when pricing seems to be less-frugal. I paid $15 ($22 total) for a Gyro that didn't even come with fries or tzatziki sauce honestly i'm all about supporting our local joints but this one really let me down big-time, Instead of tzatziki sauce i received what appeared to be some odd thick white cream/paste which wasn't very good and had somewhat of an off putting flavor. 

Needless to say after today's experience i was left with a bitter taste in my mouth [no pun intended], When it comes to GOOD food i certainly have an open wallet but in this case the price simply DOES NOT justify the food received; I feel that for anyone to pay $15 for a plain gyro is almost insulting specially when a 10lb sack of potatoes is only $1.99; As a business-owner myself i refuse to see how adding fries to the meals hinders this restaurants profit margins in any way.",-m5GK6m4hQiZwl8fpSJkYA,1,1,1,XrdQMo28UGH19Q38zgmOCQ

Also, the sandwiches were pretty small. I seriously don't mind paying $12 for a good-sized sandwich, but these were barely worth $5. For the price, I will not return to this place.

Oh yeah, here's another thing: Their stereo speakers are blown. They need to take care of these A.S.A.P. Considering the place is just a stand and their food is being sold at the prices they're asking, I'm sure they have enough money to buy a new set of speakers. The owners must be cheap.

I had gotten the http://restaurant.com gc, despite the fact that I had to spend $50 in order to get my discount AND it had to be dine-in only.  I had done my research and learned that Sammy's was basically a shack w/ 4 tables inside and some outdoor tables as well.  I was a bit worried about having to dine in cuz I had my lil ones w/ me and didn't know if we'd have to eat outside in 100+ degrees.

So being the mom that I am, I decided that we'd get to Sammy's at exactly 11a (when it opened) and hoping to be the first ones there to get an inside table.  We got there at 11:15a and sure enough we were the first there.  In fact, they didn't even unlock their front doors yet!  We got in, and the place had a/c on full-blast.  We even had to go back to the car to get jackets for the kids, they were freezing.  But this in no way is a complaint!  I was thankful for the a/c.  

We ended up getting a ton of food. 
-2 LA-style Pastrami sandwiches:  hubby loved it, SIL said it was only ok.
-garlic fries: YUM, crispy thin fries with lots of seasoning
-fried zucchinis: looked like chicken nuggets but w/ zucchinis inside of course, pretty good, loved the breading
-buffalo chicken wings: unfortunately this wasn't that good, the sauce is very light.  basically it was fried chicken wings w/ tabasco-style sauce poured over them
-zesty ranch chicken wings:  i actually liked these but a tad too salty, once again, it's just really fried (i.e crispy) wings w/ a ranch flavored powder dusted over them.  When I ordered them, I had an image of wings covered in ranch dressing goo.  Their version was probably the better choice anyway!
-chicken gyro sandwich:  this was for me since I couldn't eat beef.  It's pretty much hearty portions of marinated chicken wrapped in a pita bread covered with tomatoes, cucumbers, onions and tzatziki sauce.  Messy to eat but yummy.
And finally the much-hyped strawberry lemonade:  nice and refreshing.  it definitely got a ""two thumbs up"" from my kids, they drank more than they ate!

A final note regarding dining w/ kids.  This is definitely best for take-out.  Although we had to dine-in, I wouldn't recommend it again in the future for my family.  There were no high-chairs and really nothing that shouts out ""kid-friendly"".

He heard from other people that the food was good, but it was a little pricey. Trying to find the place was easy. It's about 5-8 minutes away from where me and my boyfriend live. 

As soon as we found it, to me it was a little odd. It being like a hole in the wall kind of shop. My first thought was it only had a drive thru. Going thru  to find the order board, i noticed a box, thinking it was the ordering box. Come to find there was a sign saying to drive to the window after we know what we want. So we take a few minutes look at what they got, and figure out what we want to eat. 

I got the BACON PASTRAMI SANDWICH with GARLIC ROMANO FRIES. My boyfriend got the PASTRAMI FRIES and the PASTRAMI BURGER.  The portion was a good size. My fries was the skinny fries seasoned in garlic salt. My sandwich was like a loaf of bread you would get at subway, almost, with layers of pastrami, onions, mustard, provolone cheese and bacon. I think the sandwich said with tomatoes but never have any. 

When we were done, we drove up to the window. Had one car in front of us. They waited about 8-10 min for their food. While we were waiting the guy comes out the door and takes our order. At first we're like ok?! so we put in our order, my boyfriend asks for mayo no mustard and the guy makes a sarcastic comment about how they""re rated the best in vegas, and their pastrami is juicy that you don't need mayo and asked if we own a very popular shop?. Then he said NO I DO!. So we just kept ordering and let it pass by. Finally it was our turn to get our food. We probably waited about 10-15 minutes more from when we were behind the car in front of us. It got to the point where i literally turned off my car for about 5 minutes.

They slowly started getting busy. The parking was limited. then finally we got our food. 

overall I must say the experience wasn't that great. Waiting long for our food, having a sarcastic food server, and the space being small.

Food was very good
Very good selection of items on menu

Cons:
Over priced food
The staff was rude, especially this Hispanic lady who acted like she owned the place.
Building was terribly run down
They don't offer free soda refills (not such a big deal if it wasn't for everything else and the rude way I was told this)
They charge a $1 surcharge for using a credit card, again, not that bad if it was displayed properly. They have a sign (about 4X6) on the counter that was turned around backwards and not visible.
Again, the Hispanic woman was a very rude person and she was also the cook that day.

I gave this place 3 stars ONLY because of the food taste, otherwise it would have been a 1 star review.

NOTE: Sandwiches come with no side, no chips or fries, etc. They are highly priced, but they are fair sized, just too high of a price for them.

The owners work like dogs to deliver you great food. And the prices are not bad.
The downside is that the place is small with only five tables, the drive up window works but it does take a long time to make each order it from scratch, and ordering ahead can be hit or miss.

The plumbing in the place broke and it smelled like someone pooped. Sadly only one lady working. So the food took over 35mins and I was the only one in there.

The sandwich was just OK. The pastrami was tough and very fatty and chewy. 

Fries were terrible. Really old and had been sitting out.

Milkshake was the wrong one. She gave me the banana chocolate one. It wasn't bad but would have rather had what I ordered.

Service was absolutely horrendous. Made an online order with fried mushrooms only to find out they didn't have any breading for anything. So I said let me look at a menu and I'll get back to you. So my buddy and I came up to place our orders. He places his. Then just as I'm about to place mine, she starts reading off both of our orders. Well I hadn't placed mine yet. I was gonna order a double pastrami burger and an order of gyro fries. She said I had already ordered a small fry... I said no I didn't. She said its too late cuz the girl in the back had already started the small fries. I don't see what the big deal was. Just add some more fries and turn it into a gyro fry. No big deal... Well I was furious. They finally got me what I ordered but I was still very dissatisfied cuz she kept insisting that I had ordered a small fry...

Anyway, let's get to the food. And why this place gets 4 stars... ABSOLUTELY PHENOMENAL!!! The burger was one of the best I've ever eaten. And the gyro fries were a delicacy. The food was so good that I ate it slowly and savored every bite.

Upon first glance it was a small ""house"" looking structure.  Upon opening the door there was an unidentifiable smell.  I would like to think it was the food that was cooking.  Once we took care of the logistics of the $100 in gift certificates we were carrying.  We decided to go for it and order a wide variety of food.  Most of the food is deep fried. I don't regularly eat deep fried so I was cautious. 

I really liked the deep fried zucchini.  The batter was a soft bread like batter instead of a bread crumb batter.  It added a bit more bread taste than I was use to but dipped in the ranch it was good.  We also tried the mushrooms with the breading.  These I found too small to have such a heavy breading on them.  It tasted like an overload of breading with a button of mushroom taste in the middle.  I didn't like that.  The onion rings were the best.  They were tasty.  

I also don't eat a lot of meat, but I ordered the pastrami to give it a try.  The pastrami itself was good.  It wasn't too thin and it wasn't too salty.  It had a hearty taste.  My sandwich had the egg and bacon with it.  The bacon was overcooked but the egg tasted good on the sandwich. 

I was surprised when we discovered they had no restroom. Unfortunately for us, the business next door was already closed so our evening ended with a drive to look for a restroom.

I gave Ida my order over the phone, when I arrived she didn't have it. I had to explain it all over again, the cook was standing behind her. I paid $31, I order chicken basket, chili cheese fries and pastrami burger.
Let's just discuss the food it's horrible the pastrami is very fatty and is complete grease. I ate one bite and put it down in the container. My husband had the BBQ chicken basket and it tasted like buffalo sauce. And I paid extra cause there was bacon on top of the fries. 
Once I made it home with my meal and we both tasted it I called and left a voicemail with 30 mins. I am there when they open the next day and I tell Anna what the problem was she personally tasted the food, herself. She wanted to argue with me about it being buffalo sauce verse what I ordered which was BBQ. I told her that's why the whole meal is in the box because my husband can't physically eat it. If you eat something and it doesn't taste well or its something wrong with it you return it.

My sandwich today was perfect. A satisfying half pound portion of thinly sliced steamed meat piled high on a soft roll with mustard and pickles. Just like I described above.  Excellent! The meat was sliced perfect to stay tender and not over cooked to make it chewy or tough. 

LA Pastrami has a ton of other items they serve on the menu I must try. Burgers, fries, homemade ice cream and the list goes on and on. I did not expect such a list of offerings from this little run down pastrami hut.

The food is really good. Both stars goes to the taste and quality of the food. Hubby had the 502 sandwich and I had their Philly cheesesteak with cheddar cheese sauce, with added mushrooms.

Hubby also ordered their custard shake and that was also delicious. It was very creamy and not overtly sweet.

The service was definitely lacking. Very bad customer service. The lady was not friendly or helpful at all. We felt we were a bother to even be there. So I didn't order anymore than that one sandwich even though I had wanted to try other dishes too. I think we found the secret to getting just decent customer service at least.

It doesn't take long once setting foot inside this dump to realize that you are in the wrong restaurant and you should have kept driving.  Everywhere you look there is nothing but filth.  The walls are dirty, the floor is dirty, the customers are smelly and obese, but the biggest piece of filth is the owner himself.  He talks incessantly, and has an ego like he's 7 feet tall when he is really about 4'11.  All he does is brag about how awesome Sammy's is.  On top of this he is extremely rude to paying customers.  

After paying about $8 more than the food should actually cost, you have to be lucky to get a seat at one of the three dirty tables.  Most likely you will be waiting about 25 minutes before your food is ready.  At this point you are probably starving and hoping the food is as good as the owner talks it up to be.  I'm sorry to say that you will be sorely disappointed.  I had a burger and some of the so called delicious fries.  I would rate the burger at or below that of your average fast food place.

There are other items without it but having only gone there twice, I got at least 98 more to go! Yay, more reasons to go!

I gave them 4 stars because their items are a bit pricey, but you do have the big portions factor. Their fries alone is a meal in itself so when you do order it, make sure you have people with you. That's why by the time I ordered my pastrami burger, fries and a drink, it came out to about 15 bucks. Of course I can go without the fries next time but that is still about 10 bucks for the burger and drink. Hay, I didnt say to eat there every day unless you wanna have an early death.

As any fast food eating American would do we pulled out the Garlic Fries and took a few out while we were driving away. Yes they were hot as expected. But they were so salty and hardly any garlic flavor. We were expecting minced garlic and to our surprise it was only garlic salt with more salt - YUCK.
The pastrami was very thinly sliced but was very fatty. Not typical of ""LA Style Pastrami"" as advertised. The sandwich roll was hard and not fresh. Could it get any worse - YES, the pickle was not put in a separate wrapper as I asked, so the pickle juice made the inside bread soggy. I do not like pickles on my sandwiches. The portion of pastrami was very skimpy.

So I got out my cell and pulled up the Yelp app and found Sammy's. Since we were staying at the Tropicana (ugghhh) it made sense as Sammy's was just down the road.

Before and when I got there I really had no idea what I wanted. All I did know is I was starving and wanted a bunch of whatever it was gonna be.

Since it was a later dinner, 8ish, the place was pretty empty. The guy behind the counter (Bryan) basically explained the menu. In a nutshell he said they could make anything any way we wanted it.

Bryan ended up talking me into getting the ""502 Fries"" with jalape√±os on top. I can't remember what the wife got but it was pretty impressive as well.

I also got a special iced tea of the day type thing and BS'd with Bryan as he worked the drive through.

He tried to talk us into the Vanilla Custard shake. Considering how gargantuan my fries looked like they would be I passed as i didn't want to have to be rolled to the rental car as opposed to me walking to it.

Bryan made one up anyways for himself and saved some on the side for us to try. We were glad he did as it was wicked good.

Just about the time our meal was ready some locals walked. They just kind of looked over and chuckled as my food was set down.

I was warned to not start at the top and pick all the goodies off as my ""left-overs"" would be somewhat blah. He said to start from one end and work my way towards to the other end. That way each bite would have all the goodies.

When I raised the white flag I was told I did fairly good as i had killed off just over 1/3 of the fries. Man I was stuffed!

When it was all said and done, I was very satisfied with the food and company. The locals were pretty cool and talkative.

Don't go here expecting it to be your standard $5 burger joint. It isn't.

My bill for two of us was around $30. Considering how long I was picking at the leftovers in my hotel room it was worth it.

2868651,2011-12-31,0,7yYexN1Q5ShE_z1MH2TDTw,Searched Yelp for a good pastrami sandwich shop in Vegas. Thanks to all of the Yelpers for the great find. I doubt I would have eaten at Sammy's without the great reviews because from the outside...Sammy's doesn't look like much. The food is a 4.5 and the dining area is a 3. The pastrami is moist and the bread is soft and tasty. One of the better pastrami sandwiches I have ever had. I also had their garlic fries which was really good as well.,B55mxy8G9RidvJdZJ-RvRA,0,0,4,lRvNl_wLPkeI_1eMnRz7OQ

The steak fries did not resemble the ones of years past.  The meat portion indeed could not possibly be the weight that it claims any longer.  Also the fries were mushed under all the chili and the little shreddings of ""rib-eye"" were dark, burnt and sad looking.  

The wings are now fried until burnt as well and the sauce is on the side now.  Completely ruining the aesthetic appeal of ordering ""different styles"" of wings.  

The menu is now handed to you and the prices are just as high.  Quality is not up to par for the prices any longer.  Food yet not perfect as I was used to was still pretty darn good tasting though.  Hence, 3 stars.",ZngF2uBYrqyFjXd6LvuluQ,6,3,3,NhEL8jmvb6MIxMOtsR6Kpg
2898746,2012-09-24,11,7yYexN1Q5ShE_z1MH2TDTw,"This place is kind of crazy, and when I first walked in  there, the manager was having a pretty funny argument with an out state idiot who was insulting Las Vegas for no reason.   I didn't know what to make of it, but I had a old restaurant.com coupon for this place, and my friends wanted to eat Pastrami in a very bad way.   So I looked at the guy, and told him could I order, and have a nice day.    Everyone sitting down in the small dining room, gave me a look of Oh no...but I didn't care, I was beyond hungry, and so was my friend and her daughters.    I don't know if he left because I was trying to be cool, or maybe he could feel my friend was about to go on a  PMS induce rage on him if he stood in her way of ordering.   Well, the guy jumped in his Arizona licensed Oldsmobile, and burned rubber out on Tropicana.  Sadly, he got a ticket from a Metro officer who was nearby in the other parking lot..   Oh well.

When I finally got to the counter, it was a task in figuring out what to eat, because the menu is set up with a unique selection of burgers, sandwiches, and hot dogs.   I didn't know what to choose between a Pastrami burger or that monster cheeseburger.    My friends choose the Pastrami burgers, but I went for the Big Ass bacon cheeseburger, and we shared the large order of fried Mozzarella, and the Garlic Romano fries.    

Our order came out in 15 minutes, and I was taken back on the size of this burger.   It was ridiculous in size, and I have to admit it took two meals to put it down.   I really like it, and the only other burger I liked better than this at the time was at Create (which sadly closed).   The fries were good, but my friend told me it not up to the quality and standard of her former work place called, the dive (the old fashion show mall....she always does that)  but she still enjoyed them.    

The manager/owner was very cool, and didn't add on the 18%  to my bill for that restaurant.com coupon, and because of that we got a couple of milkshakes for her daughters.   I have to admit, I'm a sucker for a good Hand scooped milk shake, and Sammy's did make a good one.   

Finally, I been to The Hat in Monterey Park, and I have say Sammy Pastrami is very close to them as far as flavor for their trademark name.    Sammy does cut their meats a little thicker, but it's still a good corned beef.    If you're asking why a four star?   The parking sucks, and the place is very small, also it hard to turn into coming from Henderson.....but in the end...I'm a pretty big fan of this place.",ePWsbOWDTJcgIus-BFuKpg,13,10,4,i9SmE2JDoc011dFNTAokPg

The fries could have been better, but I didn't really expect much considering. Why such a low review? Well, we went through the drive thru and even though there was only 1 other person in front of us it took over an hour. Honestly, I probably could say closer to 1.5 hours, but I fear no one would believe me because that is just insanity. If it wasn't for getting several people on board and figuring out their order prior to going there - as in if this was just for me- I would have surely left and gone ANYPLACE else. I just kept thinking, well, surely it will be soon. I can not imagine what the heck was taking so long? It's just outrageous. 

Honestly, no matter how good the food is, I will never be back. I don't have the time to wait 1-2 hours for a sandwich. It should also be noted that I only ordered 3 sandwiches and 1 order of fries. Although all of that is regardless because the majority of the wait was before he even got to me. Also, when I asked for a receipt he looked at me like I was crazy and handed me a scratch piece of paper with nonsense written on it.

We walked in to a little hole in the wall type joint which I don't mind.  However, it could have been cleaner.  At least wipe down the table in between customers.  We had the vanilla lemonade, cheeseburger, sweet potato fries and onion rings.  Everything was HUGE, but the burger could have been seasoned better in my opinion.  I was feeling super fat that day so I decided to get the gyro to go.  Now THAT was the piece de resistance!  Best gyro I ever had.  Seasoned extremely well, sauce was excellent.  The only drawback to sitting in the place was that the owner talked us to death!

I will say this I tried the original LA pastrami the medium size and got the garlic fries and damn they were both extremely tasty and massive .The only issue I had is it is a very expensive thing to splurge on but you are getting quality so for all these reasons I'm not giving it a three and I'm not give it a five, 4 stars is right where deserves,  unless you move to a better location and lowers the price a little bit then it will be a five but you should go get your grub on if you're dying for a solid pastrami sandwich with some awesome fries",dmOKXLjffo-mTgdcMw7FsQ,0,0,4,ckJ85xq0yRJiODvjC4NnIQ

Their location on Decatur has only a drive-thru and walk-up window (seating outside), but at this location you can walk inside to order and they also have a dining area. I noticed a $14 for $20 yelp deal upon checking in, so I purchased it. The guy who took my order was very nice, but had some issues figuring out the yelp deal. He called the manager and it all got straightened out. 

The portions here are big, so hubby and I shared. We started out with ""Fried Mozzarella"" priced at $8.69 for the large and side if sauce. These weren't bad at all, but not the best I've tasted either, above average. I've had the ""Garlic Romano Fries"" from the Decatur location and loved them, so at $4.59 I ordered them with a side a Sammy's Sauce. The fries here were consistent with the ones I had previously, so they tasted great! Next I enjoyed my half of ""The L.A. Pastrami"" priced at $10.79 for the large. The pastrami was very tender and had good flavor. It also has mustard, pickles and cheese on it. This sandwich even comes in a extra large size! Even their small sizes are fair, so if you get a medium size or larger, it's very possible you could share with someone depending on your appetite.

Luckily, I hadn't ordered them with ranch lol. I think they would have been better plain. The fries were weird. I couldn't even tell there was garlic oil on the fries Honestly. The fries didn't have a ton of flavor. I got most of the flavor after I was done eating them. Overall, okay food.

The place itself is small but nice. The staff were friendly and accommodating. It seemed a little slow fir the people who ordered after us.

Their credit card machine was down, and I had no cash on me, and a nice gentleman by the name of Douglas who was sitting at a table close to the register  eating a large pastrami sandwich and fries got up and payed for my meal in cash. I told him that I couldn't accept his generous offer,  but he insisted on the one condition that I one day also spread this pay it forward attitude, because if everybody did this once for someone else, then the world would be a better place.

Little did I know that this hole in the wall joint will provide us with the best sandwiches and burgers in town! Brian perfected the art food to an exact science.

We ordered 502 fries- a pound of fries with chili, rib eye steak, pastrami, jalapenos, and grilled onions. 

Pastrami burger MOUNTED with two handfuls of pastrami! you could barely see the bun.

I got the gyro and we also got a Chipotle burger. Brian served us our food and even gave us step by step directions on how to eat every meal.

ALL WAS AMAZING! By the time we were done eating all of what we had we could barely breathe. but we pushed to try a custard milkshake. I tried the mango milkshake, but if you're going to try a milkshake try one thats off the menu the BANANA OREO MILKSHAKE its amazing. It tastes just like pie but in liquid form. We also tried the pomegranate lemonade and the strawberry lemonade to go with our meal. We walked out being four satisfied customers, and definitely a proud regular.

The amount of food they offer is more than what you paid for and definitely worth every penny. The best part is they offer you great conversation and the best sense of humor for FREE.

We ordered to go because we had to get back to the office. Yes, the place is sort of a dump inside and small but sometimes those places are good.  I was a bit turned off when the guy got up on the counter to turn up the air conditioner that is jutting out of the wall. 

When we got back to our office, we opened our styrofoam boxes and were shocked (and disgusted).  The phillys were drowning in yellow processed cheese (almost soupy). I have never had a philly like this and did not expect it at all. I couldn't hardly eat it because it was so messy. The meat was tender and flavorful but you couldn't get over the amount of cheese that it was swimming in. Very salty, messy and not worth the trouble.

As people came in and saw the tables, they would look at one another and think out loud, ""What have we gotten ourselves into""?

If I can give one gripe about this place is the location, location, location, this place is truly a dump of a place, the AC half works, the inside has no welcoming feel to it. Although the nice cashier was very friendly, this place truly needs to be relocated. This place has strip pricing but none of the fun ambiance that the strip provides. Their parking consists of 4 spaces, so if their taken you have to park near some sketchy apartments next to the grease trap. Now this place does Uber eats if you don't want to swing by yourself, unfortunately they are prioritize so you do have to wait a good 20 mins to get your food with a bad AC unit. The food itself is pricey for a burger joint, but it does all come in larger options so great for sharing. Their pastrami starts at $10-$18. I got a 10"" but could only do half, I got a large order of chili cheese fries and only did half as well. Both food items were very filling and great. If this place was a few blocks further up this could be Vegas best kept secret. Although I gave this place a 4 star rating due to its food portions and taste, I will say the run down little shack really lacks a great seating option to enjoy your meal, the price is only worth it if you plan on sharing, but this place is far from a date location or a family friendly diner. Definitely a place worth trying, but not sure I'd bring my friends or family out here to eat definitely not at night or in the summer at least This is the first review that I've had mixed feelings about though.

I go to retrieve my food and the order is wrong. Like they misunderstood I wanted cheese on 1 order. Then I got 2 pastrami sandwiches instead of a pastrami burger. So my order needed to be corrected. The cashier was very apologetic and gave me a lemonade for the inconvenience. Which took another 10mins so I just nibbled the fries and half of 1 of my sandwiches. The sandwich was DELICIOUS!!! The fries weren't great. They were just ok. Once my granny got her cheese she said her food was good too. My pastrami burger was massive and tasted good, but it was just an overwhelming combo for me.

The chipotle steak burger was spicy.  If you can't take the heat then that is not a burger for you.  It packed a lot of flavor but a bit too spicy for me.  

The pastrami melt was good but got a little too salty after awhile because it was loaded with pastrami.  A bit on the greasy side.

Garlic Romano fries - shoe string fries with some garlic and romano flavor.  Really thin and crispy but not much flavor.  

The pomegranate lemonade was pretty good, a bit sweet but that comes from the pomegranate syrup.  

Root beer float large came with like half a tub of ice cream.  The cup was literally full with ice cream.  The key to this place is everything must be huge portions.",AgfwqflEQL1VTDF3IMw9Og,1,0,3,V2EBgUFRPZc55udyxaueMw

Back in the day, you had real good, big beef patties not the factory pressed pink slime molds full of filler and preservatives and nitrates.  The gourmet burger is all the rage these days.  Back when Carl's came out with the $6 burger, people scoffed at even paying $5 for a ""$6"" burger.  Today, nobody blinks an eye paying $5 for a sh tty burger.  The pastrami burger here is $8.  Not a big deal, because it's basically a burger and pastrami sandwich mixed together.  So it's like you bought a $4 burger and added a $4 pastrami sandwich and just got ride of two layers of bread.  I really liked it, because you could taste the pastrami, it was thick and meaty.  Some places like Subways I imagine the pastrami is transparent or just nasty fat with some vein of meat.  This was the real deal.  The only reason I heard about this place was because it was next door to Boiling Crab where I ate.  The one next door was closed so I actually looked this one up and drove across town for it.  The fries were also nice and big, not the skinny ones you get at McDonalds.  It was old-school fries.

The food has taken some of the best flavors from around the country, and put it all into a small joint. The food is absolutely worth the drive from any part in the valley. Some may say the food is too ""greasy"" or too ""fatty"", but that's why you don't eat there every single day.

Make no mistake, when they hit it, it's a home run; can't stop eating. When they miss, I throw away what's left of what I ordered. I'll give 2 examples (of many) to emphasize what I mean. The mini corn dogs: when they have the correct batter and such on hand they are delicious. When they don't? They try to concoct a different batter that makes the dogs un-bearable. Sandwiches are the same in my experience, total hit or miss. One night I was particularly fiending and ordered a meal with mozzarella sticks. Are you ready for it? Multiple of the mozzarella sticks were... EMPTY! Just a shell with no cheese at all. I've never experienced anything like that. It's like they have different cooks at different times and you never know what you're going to get.

I'm a big proponent for consistency when it comes to food. Although they can be really GOOD, the bad outweighs the good unfortunately. Typically, I don't rate a place based on one visit. At least 2 or 3 should show a good foundation. 

I don't know if owners changed or whatever, but quality definitely isn't top priority. I so want to go there again, but I opt for somewhere else because I never know what I'm going to get.

I even got around to trying their custard shakes, rib eye steak fries, fried mushrooms, gyro, big ass bacon cheeseburger, corned beef sandwich, and lemonades in the 3.5 years since I wrote that review. In fact, I'll bet my husband and I have eaten there/picked up takeout 25 times since I wrote it. But those days might be over.

The customer service has become literally a joke. Like, we'll have to steel ourselves with jokes about how bad it'll be this time before we walk in the door so we won't boil over with anger. It used to only be bad at night, and then on weekends, and now basically any time, any day. We can be the only customers in the joint, or we'll wait quite a while because they're busy. It doesn't matter. Why should I have to put my ""I'll be nice to you no matter what""/""I work retail"" face on *when I'm the customer* because you guys are so rude? It hit me how backwards this was after we headed home and joked about how they must deal with unpleasant/hostile customers. And just forget the drive thru. Come inside. 

(I will note that one afternoon/early evening I got great service, but it was because there were 2 people working; it was a relief because I was with my family in from out of town, but that's been literally the only exception. Why is there usually only 1 person working, especially at night? Isn't that dangerous?)

Also, the quality/construction of some of the dishes vary widely depending on when they're made. The meats are usually the same amount (I'm guessing they use a scale), but sometimes the bread will be cut weird, or their special fries will be insanely heavy handed with sauces or the chili... and the next time less than even pictured. I mean I guess it's all about who's making the dish, but over the years you'd think things wouldn't de-evolve, you know what I mean? Especially as prices have gone up (I get it, stuff costs more), you expect at least some regularity.

All in all, their food is delicious. Sometimes I literally crave it. But they make you pay for it, in dollars and patience. See ya, Sammy.",0daa3lYsz2iFumNX-Ay3Qg,2,0,2,ugz_xp90kTKjvooKFA6SSw

Although the flavor was similar to ""The Hat"" in Cali, the meat was very dry as if it spent too much time on the flattop. There was what seemed to be ""Crusties"" from the dirty flattop (no, it wasn't pepper) on the meat and bread. Sadly I threw the sandwich away after spending a small fortune on a large to feed my wife and I.  Again, similar flavor as a true LA Pastrami but the quality was very disappointing. After all the good comments I read about this sandwich, I was expecting high quality and received Subway quality pastrami. I did have an excellent shake though and this shake deserves the 2 stars I gave.",xWLoYvvH1pzrCa0nW31UTA,0,0,2,lrX70nEOgdGw4CQZrbiz1w

Found a discount of BOGO Sandwiches today and upon entering it only honors $10 credit...  why not just say $10 credit instead of BOGO * 
Prices in store are not synced with the prices online which is also displeasing.  Also, they are cash friendly, you pull out your card and expect a 20% surcharge with All plastic payments

First time coming in; food was well prepared, the pictures are easy on the eyes, and the sight of others  plates I was ready to order 1 of everything.  The chili cheese fries with an egg OMGoodness must see it to believe it!

Second time coming in I ordered pulled pork and they were out of so ordered 2  L Sammy Pastrami's but upon ordering such a large sandwich the bread fell apart meat and everything soggy No Crispness or attitude. 

Overall experience 2 stars for a place to have Pastrami. I would rather recommend Rum Runner freshly made customizable and more bang for your Buck.

Amazing Pastrami here!!! The food is made to order (warm, fresh, good eats), but the wait is well worth it. When we visited, there was one other customer besides us (during lunch). We have a favorite sandwich (we've been to the other location as well), the LA Pastrami (pastrami, mustard, pickles, & melted provolone on good quality rolls), so we were able to use our restaurant.com certificate (no longer participating, sad face). Mmm, such ""high quality fast food"" as the owner stated in the feature. The flavor of the pastrami is delicious, the meat is lean, not fatty or greasy. (I've had pastrami at other places so I have a pretty good frame of reference. My fave growing up was Max's in SF, my uncle worked there and we enjoyed the food, good memories too. I do want to try a famous deli down the line, though.) On one hand, you want to take your time, but on the other, you just want to down it. Ranch fries takes the fries to a higher level, what flavor (it is saltier, though; again, this is where you break all your diet rules). Generous portions on the sandwiches, and fries, for that matter. Such a large menu (so many yummy options and possibilities---burgers, chicken sandwiches, melts, pitas, fries & starters, chili fries, wings, strips and shakes besides drinks), but we've gotten the same items because it is that yummy. And you know, we'd probably get the same things next time, too!

The place is small (but clean), could probably be in the ""hole in the wall"" category"" if one just based it on the inside seating (four to six tables, with chairs, maybe?). There is seating outside, as well (umbrellas). And of course, the drive-thru window. The cashier, who was new, was training, but she was very nice. The manager was going through procedures with her. 

The website is pretty user-friendly (a plus). You can order online from either location and you can also purchase gift cards online too.

Home of the 502 Challenge: a 6.5 pound meal, 2 pounds of fries, one pound of chili, one pound of steak, one pound of cheddar cheese, and half a pound of grilled onions and jalapenos, at $24.99. Saw this on the Travel Channel feature, too.",fiGqQ7pIGKyZ9G0RqWLMpg,4,3,4,OO5qdOF0ClQQmKqkY-j3Iw

Maybe my Reuben wasn't as fatty as I remembered.... Anyway, came here again before leaving Vegas and got a chicken cheese steak (or something to that effect) along with a small order of sweet potato fries. 

I was supremely disappointed with both. The meat used for the chicken was the kind of dark, shitty, low-grade crap you'd get from a bag of precooked Tyson at the grocery store. Guys, really, this is not the kind of meat to use in an $8 sandwich. I'm not saying it's all got the be organic white breast meat, but when every single bite produces some weird cartilaginous chunk, I take issue. And the buns they use are way too rubbery. I felt like a dog chewing on an old tire with each bite.  

You know what's great about sweet potato fries? If you cut them up right and give 'em a good crisp in the oven, they're fucking delicious. 

How can this be easily ruined? Coat them with enough salt and seasonings to cure a rump roast from Paul Bunyan's blue ox, Babe. Have you ever eaten something so salty it was almost painful? This is that thing again.",4lng77gRdpRb24o91sSihA,4,2,3,zeUFtonJZhsIlEJzASMlWQ

4315122,2010-05-11,0,7yYexN1Q5ShE_z1MH2TDTw,"I have never heard of this place prior to browsing the pages of Vegas restaurants on the Restaurant.com website.  I read the reviews here- and figured that we had to try it.

First I want to say that this location is not in a sketchy part of town as someone else mentioned.  I grew up in Vegas, and this is just an older part of town.

Parking is okay.  It's actually kind of hard to figure out where you are supposed  to park, but we were informed that next time we can park at the old Al Phillips cause that place in un-occupied.

So lets get to to food.  It is so hard to decide what to get.  We don't like pastrami, but the menu is full of things that aren't pastrami.  So we ended up with burgers.  My husband had the Big Ass Bacon Cheeseburger.  It was good- and huge.  It has a ton of cheese- really, it's a lot.  Almost too much.  The fries were decent, but they are like shoestring fries and we aren't really a fan of those- a friend of ours says they have fatter fries, we'll have to check next time.  The strawberry lemonade was AWESOME.  The hamburger meat seems a little bland though- maybe add some season salt?  Luckily the burgers are piled with a bunch of other stuff that's got some flavor so it's still good.

The building is kinda like a little shack.  The indoor dining area has 5 tables I believe and each table seats 4.  There is also outdoor seating.  I don't know if they have highchairs- I didn't see any(they do have a kids menu though).  I don't know about a customer bathroom either?

The guy who rings you up is the owner I believe.  He kinda talks A LOT- well not kinda, he talked about random things to all the customers eating almost the entire time we were there(he also liked to brag about all the food and how good it was).  Don't get me wrong- the food is good, but I think some of it is a bit overdone and impossible to eat and it's not like I was in food heaven while eating it.  So if you want a quiet lunch- eat outside.

This place is good and the prices are good.  We will return.",4TGnP1M77mFXaMQjY2joyA,1,0,4,BZuWQytjJ-3UrMx65cMx-g

They would be foolish not to put this place on that show.  The food is delish & the servings massive.
I am hoping that one day soon we will see another Sammy's location in North Vegas.
I can honestly say that the Fries are the best I have ever had.  From the assortment of seasoned fries, to the Bacon cheese fries.  Heavenly.  And the great thing is they are never greasy.
My personal favorite is either the Pastrami sandwich or the Pastrami fries.  Who would have thunk to put Pastrami on Fries?  My co-workers alway order the 502 Fries.  A pound of Fries topped with 2 different meats, chili, cheese etc...yes it is a heart attack waiting to happen.
I have also tried the Big Assed Bacon Cheeseburger.  It was a bit too big for me but it was so so good.  My son loves the Chipotle Burger.  Everyone I have ever taken to Sammy's has loved the experience.  Both locations bring your food to the tables. As many drink refills as you can handle.  It is for sure...service with a smile.

The guy behind the counter was very friendly and patient as we perused the overwhelming menu. I chose the ""gyros fries"" pretty quickly and asked if the large was enough for 2 people. My husband stated he was starving so usually that means he will eat enough for  2 all on his own. I ordered the regular size and he finally decided on the philly cheese steak and ranch fries. We shared a large iced tea.

The place is small, but not uncomfortable. The food came out rather quickly. The iced tea was great and fresh. The portions were huge. The regular fries was definately enough to share. My husband was a little skeptical about that but then I pointed out he would have enough room for a custard shake. He was right on board with that.

The fries were a good mix of vegetables and meat. Everything was fresh and the tzatziki was to die for. My husband loved the ranch fries and said his philly was ""very tasty"". I realized there was no way we were going to finish the amount of food we ordered so I suggested we just pool our efforts and eat as much of the gyros fries as possible and take the rest home.

So to sum up, service is great, food is great, portions are huge. It does seem a bit pricey but not when you consider the amount of food given. As a matter of a fact if we would have just split one entree it would have been a pretty cheap dinner for 2.",pfMmuVgggj14f9bb16IwXw,0,0,4,QAGOlDBGgDN6x3FUf4eVNw

My boyfriend and I got there around 2pm last Thursday and the place was empty.  The owner, Bryan, took our order and assured us that his place is legit as it was super crowded earlier (not that I doubted him).  He was really friendly and funny and made for some good company while we ate.

Now on to the food, we went with the 502 Fries and the L.A. Style Pastrami Sandwich as well as a fresh squeezed strawberry lemonade and a mango milkshake to wash it all down.  My lemonade was nice and tart, the way I like it.  I also tried some of my boyfriend's shake and it was very custardy and yummy but unfortunately didn't taste mango-y at all (Bryan made a really big batch and was nice enough to give him refills).  Anyway, the star of the meal was definitely the pastrami...sooo delicious!  When Bryan brought out the 502 Fries, my jaw dropped.  That thing was HUGE!!  Together, we ate maybe a third of it before giving up.  I couldn't even touch the pastrami sandwich (my boyfriend did finish his half though so kudos to him).

We left Sammy's stuffed and armed with leftovers for dinner (they still tasted surprisingly good 5 hours later, lol).

This location is a bit bigger with a few tables inside the walk up counter, tables outside, and of course, their drive through.  Two people worked here when we went - one working the back and the other working the front.

Sticking with what they know best - pastrami, the Husband went for the Pastrami Burger ""A 1/4 lb burger topped with Sammy's famous pastrami, mustard, pickle & provolone."" ($7.59)  He was also convinced to add a fried egg on top as well (99 cents)!  Since having their pastrami sandwich only a week ago, this burger is big but not quite as big as the sandwich.  But then again, it's loaded with hamburger meat, pastrami, and now a fried egg.  So, it's a serious burger.  He was digging it and ate it all up himself!

I was sticking with their signature fries and again went for the Garlic Romano, this time a large for $4.99.  Their large size is HUGE compared to the medium at the other location. I have no idea why!  We easily finished the medium before, but we didn't stand a chance with the large here.  Yikes!

We also shared a large Handmade Pomegranate Lemonade ($3.99).  Originally I asked for a frozen lemonade, but the guy working the counter suggested the regular one would be better.

After we put in our order, we took a seat outside to enjoy the spring evening and our food soon arrived.  The counter guy also came by to ask how we liked the food and even gave us refills on the lemonade.  Sweet!  He was definitely a friendly one and he knew more about when the place was going to be featured on the Food Network too.

Of course, we didn't finish the fries but the Husband brought them home.  He said they tasted even better the next day after a few minutes in the toaster oven.  Lucky!

Fast forward to this week and here i am in Vegas with my wife and 6 year old son, and of course when its dinner time....i suggest my book marked Sammys. It was 6 p.m. on a Tuesday.

We drive here and first off, its aittle shack and the inside is kinda....Um.....dumpy....., the tables are wobbly, the plastic table covers were kinda nasty and now im feeling hesistant and wonder if we should leave.

We stay and i ask the cashier if the XXL $15 pastrami sandwich is big enough to share, he said yes so we order it, a large garlic fries to share, a bacon cheeseburger for my son and a large drink..came to $35, 

Wait a second.....now that i think about it....the XXL was $15, so are you telling me a bacon cheeseburger, large garlic fries and large drink was $20? I wonder if i was over charged...HMmmm...oh well whatever.

Anyway back to review:

We get our fries about 10 mins before everything else, even the drink. They were plentiful and tasted pretty good, nothing mind blowing, and maybe could have used alittle more garlic. I mean they are GARLIC fries.

My sons bacon cheeseburger was good and was decent thickness. 

The $15 XXL pastrami sandwich tasted  good with little fat, but my problem is for a XXL $15 sandwich, that bad boy should be over flowing with pastrami, it was ok size wise but i expected bigger, id hate to see the regular sized sandwich. After it was done, i asked for extra pickles....when i got the sandwich there were 4 pickles in a tiny cup you would normally put ketchup in and none on the sandwich. Do they normally come with the sandwich? Cause asking for extra on a $15 sandwich, i expected alot of them but no major biggie.

Now heres my biggest gripe. The cashier was a super nice black guy and he was doing EVERYTHING by himself. I felt bad asking for extra napkins, and then asking for mustard, and then asking for an extra plate cause i was taking him from doing 5 other jobs all at once. 

He was answering phones, making food, taking orders and handling money WITHOUT gloves. I personally think handling money, answering phones and then going to make my food without washing or using gloves is fu*king disgusting. Do you realize how dirty cash and phones are? Im in Los Angeles and that shit is taken so seriously. Theres a awesome burger joint 2 blocks from my home that i go to all the time, and about 3 months ago i went in and the same shit was going on, i walked out vowing to never return, fast forward 90 days ago and they were closed for 30 days due to ""health reasons"", i dont know if thats why, but i hope so....thats nasty as hell. As we walked in Sammys, my wife says ""look....hes not wearing gloves"". Why risk our health and eat there anyway? I dont know...hunger, i guess.

Anyway....the food was decent, the prices were a tad high and the appearance and health risks were horrible. Will i be back....sadly, no.

So im giving it 3 stars and thats generous because the cashier was really nice and the pastrami itself was pretty damn good.

For a place that brags about being on television, please hire another guy and buy a box of friggin latex gloves for the cook.",CrAxoHzqCSnD9IozjiB1Og,4,0,3,h9xJFBRjJ-64b8qwfeymng

First, this place is a dive which in our mind is a good thing. One of the owners was running the front counter and what a real character, he was telling us stories, knew all the customers and was the live of the party. Funniest part is we order the Onion Rings which were amazing, but when my GF asked for tartar sauce .. OHH the look she got!!! He was like.. Ahhhh NO.. He gave us burger sauce instead and it was good.. We were given clear instructions on how to eat the Philly as it was sooo messy we ended up with a fork in the end anyway.

But just to double up on the fact- did your food taste good despite the wait? It always does to me. So good, in fact, that once I roll up I have to roll up twice, three times, and sometimes even four times in a row. They serve good-food-realness here.

The owner and grill guy was the only one there during a rush, so while it's fast food type food, it may not necessarily be fast. Did not mind though when there is good company and conversation. 

I was thinking of a link sandwich and the guy said that one was just okay. So I asked to be hooked up with the most popular thing, the LA Pastrami. I thought it was rather good...Nice flavor on the pastrami, good melty cheese and lots of mustard how I like it. It may be too much mustard for some that do not love the condiment though.  I'm from LA, but I don't really know what makes it LA style actually except I notice we do hoagies, melted cheese, mustard, pickles (sometimes jus) outside of delis. It reminds me of places like The Hat, Johnny Pastrami, Okie Dog, etc. that I grew up eating. I definitely will come back when I get a hankering and figure their Ruebens will probably be pretty damn tasty. 

I just got the small one, but it's very filling. I would say if you get fries or something, get one to share for the table, unless you want to have major itis later trying to put away all that. 

I tried a bite of Tigers gyro, which is surprisingly pretty fucking good. Not what I would expect from a non Mediterranean spot to have something that is better some Greek spots in town.

5251650,2015-06-02,2,7yYexN1Q5ShE_z1MH2TDTw,"I saw Sammy's featured on a Travel Channel best eats special so I looked them up online. I saw they had this east side location so I decided to give them a try Monday night May 1st about 8:30 pm.

First impressions when you pull into the place is it's very small, basically a shack and it's pretty dumpy looking. I initially pulled into the drive-thru and saw a bunch of signs saying to pull up to the window and ask for a menu. I pulled around and there was already an SUV in the drive thru window- engine off and lights off. I figured that was a sign of a long wait so I parked and went inside instead.

The interior of the restaurant is not going to win any style awards. It's small, cramped and very shabby. As others have mentioned in their reviews, the kitchen looks disorganized and a bit dirty. 

The next thing I noticed that others have also mentioned is there was only 1 person working the place. A young lady who looked a bit overwhelmed running around trying to do 10 things at once.

While I was waiting to have my order taken, I checked out the menu. It's 4 pages of all kinds of stuff. Sandwiches, burgers, loaded types of fries, chicken, shakes, and smoothies. A bit bewildering.

After the girl on duty finished up a huge order for the group in the SUV at the drive thru (about a 15 minute wait), I got my order in. I chose a gyros sandwich and garlic fries. There was also a guy ahead of me who had obviously been waiting a while who finally got his stuff and left. After about another 10 minutes (about 25 minutes total wait) I had my food and left to eat.

The food: The gyros sandwich was adequate. Not great but OK. The meat was not fresh off the spit but pre sliced. It was a bit dry. The pita was fresh and slightly toasted and the other toppings- tomato, onions and tzatziki sauce were all good. They did however sprinkle on some herb mix that was a little too strong and seemed out of place on the sandwich. The garlic-parmesan fries were hot and crisp and quite tasty.

The main problems I had with Sammy's were the service and prices. The prices on most of the food items is pretty high IMO. My gyros and fries ran something around $13. There are no specials or combo meal deals I saw to save a few bucks. Everything is ala carte. Seems to me charging as much as they do they could definitely afford to put one or two more people on staff. Just look around and you'll see it's obvious they aren't putting any money into the upkeep of the place! I don't blame the poor girl working for the long wait.

There is an abandoned dry cleaners building next door, and a tool place next door? So you park in driving areas...that block the entrance from Tropicana. 

This is a very small restaurant, old, extremely run down and just not clean. There's only 1 lady behind the counter cooking and taking orders, there's only one other couple in here ahead of us - they have already ordered and sat down. 

We are at the counter standing there for nearly 5 minutes with not even an acknowledgement. I'm already ansi and ready to go (my boyfriend is the more patient and forgiving one) and opted to stay because he really wants to try it. 

So we wait another 10 minutes til she cooks the meal of the party in front of us, before she even says hi, or takes our order. I'm pretty understanding, but customer service wise - just say hi, acknowledge that you know where here and that you'll be right with us. I can see that you're by yourself..that would've left a better impression. (Tangent, sorry Im still hangry and waiting for my food.) By no means was she rude, once she actually started talking to us, possibly just frazzled.

The Chipotle Steak Sammie (steak with cheese, chipotle, Cajun spices and fried egg on top) was alright. It was cheesy. The spices they used kind of made the sandwich taste a bit strange. The egg made it tolerable.

I've been coming to Sammy's for years now and I have a number of items I circle around on. The Chipotle Burger is wonderful, the Steak Burger is mighty and it's worth combining the two and have yourself a Chipotle Steak burger as well. When I stray away from burger land I have to say that the Italian combo is one of the best sandwiches I've ever had. I love that thing.

The meal fries are all awesome and great to share at a table. Make sure you have at least four guys if you're hitting up a large.

Oh yes, finally... the shakes--the CUSTARD shakes. These things will kill you but it's totally worth it. DO NOT get a large. Seriously. Don't do it.

Before going to Sammy's, you need to remember what it is: it's a man food type place. The portions are large, there's a lot of greasiness and fat going on (oh yeah, and runny eggs on some of the burgers). It's also a pit. There's four tables, some of them are uneven and frankly, it adds to the charm of the place.

Tip from a long time patron: Don't go to Sammy's and order a regular burger and fries. Don't. It's not because either item is bad but because the menu is WAY more interesting than that.

Additional tip: If you're an obnoxious customer, do not expect that being obnoxious will get you anywhere at Sammy's. Bryan, the owner, does not care how much you badger, complain or threaten. You may even get mocked by him should you choose to take that approach. I almost hope for this sort of customer whenever I drop in because watching the mayhem that ensues tends to enhance the meal.

I love this place and I almost always eat here with ""the guys."" There are no salads. There is no ""light"" menu. These are burgers, the way God intended.",6jQo4-rmGAl1wUoRdCgl0A,2,2,5,mXZiu3tn-YtcV4osJQt-fQ

The provolone and the roll on this sandwich made it a little heavy and sometimes masked the flavor of all the good pastrami.  I'm a bit of a traditionalist having grown up with this type of food, and it is a big no no in kosher land to serve meat and cheese together.

Price wise though, this is a bargain compared to the other Pastrami sandwiches I have had in the area.  The M Resort was charging 10 bucks, and Capriotti's charges 7 dollars with hardly any meat in the sandwich.  This my friends was also 7 dollars for a ""regular"" size and it is huge and overstuffed with hot tasty pastrami, easily could be split by two people.

Next time I will try the Reuben.",PomQayG1WhMxeSl1zohAUA,3,0,4,wp_mdMrD-mCDjKgFvO7Siw

I use to LOVED this place but today I went and ordered shoestring garlic fries, an old default, and wanted a hot dog. No hot dogs anymore and when I received my fries, which were $7.49 btw for a medium order of garlic romano fries, they were no longer 'shoestring' they were a small bag of soggy regular fries covered in cheap parmesean cheese, definitely not romano like before. They were absolutely gross. I went in and inquired about the fries, the menu still states they are shoestring. The lady at the counter first denied that the menu said it then, once another customer validated me by showing her, she then admitted they had changed their fries recently. I asked for my money back and also pointed out that there was a $1.00 credit card transaction fee she had neglected to inform me about, so I went ahead and informed the other customers waiting in line prior to leaving, they were also unaware.

Short story: we played it safe and got bacon cheese burgers and shared medium Romano Garlic fries (myself and my husband) and a chicken basket w/ regular fries for our son. Food was ok. Minus the chicken, tasted a bit freezer burned and like the oil needed to be changed.

The garlic fries could have been better but the Romano and garlic flavors were a bit over powering. I didn't mind it too much. The burger was piled high with hearty bacon, massive amounts of cheese and the bun itself was tasty. 

I did notice the gentleman working the counter was alone. He was manning all stations, register, grill, phone and drive thru. I saw he ignored a car because he was dealing with someone at the counter. I made a note to make sure I enter the door. Not only to make sure I'm serviced, but because I feel that had I not been able to stare at the man, he would not have washed his hands while preparing our food. I saw him wipe his hands on his jeans a couple times and made sure I had a clear view of the food prep.

Only reason why I brought this place down is that it took damn near longer than a restaurant to get my food. Why did it take that long you ask? Well for one thing there was ONE worker, don't ask me why there was only one, maybe everyone decided to call in sick just that one day I was there, boy what luck I had, or they seriously only have one worker (god I hope not they have more than one worker, this place is too good to have only one person working) well, this one worker was working everything, cashier, cook, drive-thru, but what did impress me most was that with only one worker he still managed to get our food very very very tasty. If this place wasn't so far from where my sister lives I'd try to come here more ofter and man do I wish we had a Sammy's joint in the Bay Area.

We ordered pastrami fries and some chipotle chicken wings. Man, did those two orders satisfy me and fill me up. The son got a plain cheese burger and that alone he said it was worth 4 stars. If the boy likes his burgers you can damn sure believe that this place is good. This place is known for its pastrami burgers but we decided not to get it this time around, but you better believe that next time we enter this joint we will be ordering a nice juicy pastrami burger.

There little shop is pretty small so you might wanna consider taking it to go if it's not to packed inside, but either or it's worth waiting for an open seat and eat your food freshly cooked. Price-wise it's pretty decent for the amount of food you get, seriously get a shizz load and I wish I'd took a picture of it to show the portions and how good it looked before I ate it, but I got to excited on how delicious it looked and I'm glad I didn't wait to take a picture because the food here is just as tasty as it looks. I feel sorry for other places that serve pastrami because there is no other place as good as this. Move over you fake imitations that serve pastrami *ahem* togos and subway. 

If you want some good quality pastrami, it's worth coming here instead of stuffing yourself with some cheap pastrami at other sandwich places. I just wish my experience at this place was much better, because this place does deserve 5 stars. I want to come back here and get better service so I can bump up their rating because my first experience just seemed like I caught the place on a wrong day, but I do gotta be fair because the rating involves everything about a business not just the food.

The place is more like a shack and the interior is tiny, with only 4 tables. Generally, the owner Brian runs the front of house and he is very entertaining and talkative. However, the last time we were there, there was only 1 guy running everything and he was super overwhelmed and we waited quite awhile. He was very apologetic and friendly and I honestly felt horrible for him because he was so slammed. But, the food is always worth the wait!

I usually get the pastrami sandwich, and it is truly fantastic. It is great for Las Vegas, but wouldn't hold a candle in New York. I have also tried the Italian beef sandwich, it had a great kick to it and was very tasty. I like to pair my sandwich with the garlic Romano fries as they are crispy and perfect. They also serve fries covered with meat that can serve as a meal. They are amazing if you can find some friends to share with. The chili on the fries is delicious and pairs well with the steak and pastrami. Of course you might feel pretty terrible after, but they are so good. They also have creamy and delicious milkshakes that are definitely worth a try. 

Tip: You do not need to order anything in the large size! The small is a large in any other restaurant and the large is mindbogglingly huge. I also recommend going across the street to the Pinball Hall of Fame for a perfect date night!",p9TNT6pNKRuvBSzNf27JkQ,1,2,4,86aLNjkye7qyAALaDDbZpA

Utilizing one of the local delivery services, we ordered the truffle fries, onion rings, bacon cheeseburger and pastrami sandwich. While the onion rings did not arrive at all (they were out), the other items did, and they were all terrible.

It looked like the bacon cheeseburger had been put together inside the takeaway box, mustard and lettuce all over the place, and so much water/grease/something in the bottom of the box that the bottom bun had turned to total mush. 
Same with the pastrami sandwich; bread un-toasted, wet, and soggy. The truffle fries were overcooked and wilted.

The total came out to $80.27!!! Now I'm not one for being cheap and will definitely pay for a well cooked meal but $50 plus tax just for 3 Pastrami Sandwiches was extremely irritating and that's without the cheese that was upsaled.

In-and-out THE burger to measure up against, can't touch it in any way but price. 
Five Guys, which is a great burger isn't allowed through the door. 

Sammy's has the BEST BURGER I have ever had. 

Which one? You ask.... 

Pick One, is the answer. 

I am working my way through the menu, Pastrami Burger, Classic Burger, Fat Assed Bacon Cheese Burger, Zombie Burger, the last one I ate was the Chipotle Steak Burger and have yet to find one that I don't follow by saying Oh My God, that was the BEST BURGER I ever had.

ROOKIE MISTAKES?
Sure I have made a few. 
Ordering the fries by Myself, was definitely one of them. Make no mistake, the fries are GREAT, even plain (not to mention the many awesome flavors you can get them in) but they are huge, tasty, and gone! Leaving you with the BEST BURGER ever and maybe not quite enough room to place it all.
So, don't be a rookie and order fries unless you brought backup. A friend or two, means you can enjoy the BEST BURGER EVER and the fries too!
Bryan is a character, fun loving and easy going, But asking for ketchup may get you in trouble.... When he tells you the fries can stand on their own, believe him! (Sneak the ketchup when he isn't looking if you have to!)

After enjoying the best burger of your life, you will be completely full and MIGHT be tempted to get up and walk out feeling completely satisfied. It would be a mistake. You wouldn't know about the hole left in your soul, unless you order a shake to go. THE BEST SHAKE I have ever had. Chocolate, strawberry..... Pick a flavor of delicious happiness to sip on.
