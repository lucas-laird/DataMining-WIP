great tasting food
healthy choices
reasonable prices
peaceful setting with great views, especially outside
great kids menu

The bad:
Try to avoid during kids field trip lunches for obvious reasons
they closed!  looking forward to the new opening...I hope they maintain the high quality and reasonable pricing.
the last few days they were open prior to shutting down was disgraceful...they really phoned it in.",Bhg3OZxwkiwz7DB2DjwRoQ,0,0,4,MChrTgT0_AQGL5afcJmYeg

My friend and I arrived at 10:00am -- I believe we were the first ones to arrive. The staff, including those that I could see working in the open kitchen all appeared to be happy and in wonderful moods. 

We ordered The Burger (cooked medium) with French Fries and The Portabella Burger (vegetarian) with a Salad.  And because the morning was nothing short of perfection, we sat outside on the veranda -- the outdoor seating area is large, overlooks the preserve, and has a fabulous view of the city.

The Burger is fantastic. The bread is soft, toasted, and buttery. The bacon is thick and crispy. The meat is of quality and was cooked perfectly. 

Feedback: Serving the fries in a bucket is cute, but it causes them to be less crispy. Next time, I'd ask to have them served directly on the plate.

The Portabella Burger is fantastic as well. In place of a beef patty, the ""burger"" patty is actually a large portabella mushroom.  With the addition of marinated roasted peppers and hummus, this dish has a Mediterranean vibe about it. 

Feedback:  I would have liked a bit more hummus and the salad to have been a tad more substantial, it was a bit skimpy.

I will return, again and again! 

---- 

My Order....

BURGER $9.50, + Cheddar
angus patty w/bacon, lettuce, tomato, cracked pepper mayo, brioche bun.

PORTABELLA BURGER (vegetarian) $9.00, + $1.00 for salad

My business colleague suggested meeting at Springs Cafe for a business lunch. The space was beautiful, clean and had free wi-fi! The food was fresh, quality and healthy. I got the bento box special with pork belly and forbidden rice. The pork belly was perfectly cooked and tender, the rice full of flavor.  My colleague had the fish tacos, which looked tasty and our client had a panini, which she said was full of flavor.

The staff was very attentive and helpful and everything was very well priced. I will definitely be bringing clients back in the future!",_fxN9uqWTH0vIB4k_8x12w,4,3,5,WMU3IlmTL9iSJA4T3lZMCA

Unfortunately, today it was quite disorganized and the staff didn't seem entirely sure of what was happening. 

We were offered beverages but told that any alcohol would be an extra charge. It was at the end of the meal when we inquired with another server about the inclusion of a mimosa that we received one. 

The food was cold, which probably had to do with all of the doors being open and the breeze blowing in. It didn't seem as though the items were made in house and it took some time for items to be replenished. The setup and placement were somewhat strange, too (ie the bacon was placed by the bagels and salmon on a wood tray - so definitely not warm). 

When my family got up to use the restroom, the server cleared their plates and beverages. We were not offered any refills either. Our server was very sweet, but seemed confused and overwhelmed. We saw her twice during our experience - each time she ran by our table it looked like she was holding too many dishes and needed to put them down. I guess I expected a bit more with the $30 price tag. We stayed maybe an hour and probably won't return.",A_n8VaF8cv8-eBNz84no7w,0,0,1,bA9DGUJm39T-V49fDn0z_Q

I took friends from out of town. Wanted them to have a locals, ""non-Vegas"" experience. They loved the place.  We all ordered the ""breakfast taco"" from the Sunday brunch menu. Turned out to be 3 little tacos which would've been fine, but they were COLD. The little corn tortillas were tough and chewy. There was almost no egg, but there was a long strip of bacon (cold) in each one, hanging out the ends. Terrible presentation. There was something that we decided was cheese melted onto the little tortilla. It had a slice of avocado and supposedly sour cream. The whole thing was very skimpy. I was embarrassed. My friends kept assuring me it was fine, but it was not. 

I have been to the SP many times and have always loved taking people there. I will think twice, though, about doing it again.

I would like someone from the Divine Cafe to reply to this and let us know what happened. Was the chef not working this day? Was this a new offering for you and you didn't really have it together? What? Please tell us this was a one-time goof-up and not what you will be serving  for other Sunday brunches.",Jy9LdvAHx39Jk8mZS6bm0g,0,0,2,RDFY2n7WJFGfxl_9XL3bsA

I was in the middle of texting with my wife so I picked a table on the patio.  I hadn't even set my belongings on the table I chose when I was immediately  approached by a lady who did not identify her self, but in a negative and unwelcoming tone asked me ""Can I help you"" !  Now I was a little thrown on why someone had approached me in this manner.  I replied I'm going to set my things down, sit here and then order something to eat, she replied ""well you have to Order up front"". Ok I said and she went away mumbling or muttering something.  When ordering I saw her in the far SE corner of the cafe with some other people, none including her were in any type of uniforms, she had dark hair and was wearing a brown/white and black dress or blouse so I guessed she was a manager or something.  

Now I have no problem with people approaching me and asking if I need help with something, I welcome assistance,  but the manner in which she approached me led me to believe that the way I looked or the way I was dressed made me stand out in her eyes.  Maybe the fact that I was Hispanic got her attention.  I don't know.  Either way we met.  

Sometimes it's not what you say but how you say it and given that she may have been the Manager at Devine Cafe, her approach might have been better receive had it sounded more like 

"" Good morning and welcome to Devine Cafe is there anything I can assist you with"". 

See and hear the difference.  

This lady for whatever reason made me feel like I wasn't welcome and she came over to let me know.

KETTLE CHIPS: Brought to the table upon seating, decently fresh and nicely seasoned. Provided ranch for dipping? A fresh salsa would be way better!
DEVILED EGGS: four egg halves topped with kalamata olives, simple but tasty, with a low $4 price tag.
CHEESEBURGER SLIDERS: Nice chargrilled taste, thick patties, topped with lettuce, tomato, and burger sauce.
ARTICHOKE AND CHICKEN NAAN: The highlight of our mini-meal! Served like a sandwich, think of a Panini made of naan, filled with cheese, artichoke, a bit of spinach, and strips of grilled chicken. This would make a good lunch option, generous portion.

In addition to all that tasty food, the service changes from walk-up to table service when they transition to HH. The young ladies who attended to us were super friendly and genuine. Looking forward to coming back!",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,15,10,4,hA-ZZRIbWxFjFazKoPNS7A

So sad to write this, as this has been our place for so long. I'm not sure what's going on at the restaurant there but things have definitely changed. The past few times we've been there it's taking an extremely long time to get our food. And we're not talking peak times we're talking just on a regular day where there aren't that many people and there's a 20-plus minute wait just to get a couple of entrees. This last time we went kind of did it for me. I got the fish tacos after waiting a really long time again, we ate... it wasn't til the last taco that I realized there was a thick black piece of hair in there. I brought it to the servers attention... they all stood there talked about it looked at it didn't say a word to me so we just left. As much as I love this place I don't really want to go back after that. They don't seem to care and that was just damn nasty. We eat out a lot and this was one of our regular spots. I'm kind of bummed.

Old review...
Love this place. One of our secret ""locals"" spots. It's a cafe set up so nothing fancy but clean and comfy. The food is actually pretty damn good. Better than average lunch places. Prices are about what you'd pay for a meal deal at some nasty fast food place $8 to $9. Big portions and pretty presentation. Fountian drinks and some infused waters and different flavored teas available for refreshments.
It's a little hot during the summer but view is awesome. You can see the whole valley from the balcony. Highly recommend for businesses lunches or a quick meal out. Wish they were open longer but think they close at 3pm. Would be cool if they served dinner.",U6Yb2BFi-5tDyqD_9aeSlA,1,1,2,zqJa6Bk20S58mTaD_rvZrg

We ordered a turkey melt and a chop salad both with avocado in their description. The cashier mentioned they were out of avocado for the melt. The salad still came with the avocado. I inquired, out of curiosity, why the one came with it and the other didn't. One of the servers mentioned that they were instructed to only provide avocado to those who order salads. I then asked if I could speak with a manager and was told there is no manager on Sundays. I asked for a supervisor. The server said hold on let me grab someone for you. We waited 20 minutes. Nobody ever showed. Add to the remarks that the coffee was cold. I went in wanting to like the place. Truly a shame.",pasrJI-LWX6fqyM_9ZiFKg,0,0,1,r7bymwYcn-p3bnwrzHDzyg

This place is so pretty and it has so many details that I love from the decor, fresh flowers to the lighting. 

Why the 2 stars? 

The food here is just awful. I've been here multiple times and I remember the good ol' days when Wolfgang Puck was running the show. Here are my thoughts -

The teriyaki chicken bowl serves up precooked chicken and frozen veggies on mushy rice with a very heavy bottled teriyaki sauce. Skip it.

The turkey wrap comes with wet meat. Yep, wet in just a wrong way. It's also cut into 3 pieces without any tucked end so when you take a bite everything falls out of it. The fries aren't fresh.  Skip it.

The pizza is ok. The crust is too thick & chewy for my liking but it's way better than the other items mentioned above. 

The salads are probably the better options here as well but the meat is still precooked. 

The chicken Milanese is dry and the chicken is sad as it's just been reheated most likely in a microwave. 

This review in general just makes me sad. I love the location and space but the food just tastes awful. I hope somebody brings a new seasonal menu to this location and stops serving precooked meat. Also, the prices are far too high for this kind of quality.",LNPyE5X1K5B_flcTCH9StQ,35,31,2,ilQx6h1OdQW5KyiT_DGTIQ

Why would you put bacon with cold fruit and not with the hash browns and sausage?  Why would you not put a pan of scrambled eggs out?  Why would I have to stand in the omelet line for scrambled eggs?  Why does it take two ""chefs"" with 4-6 pans going at the same time over 7-10 minutes to make an omelet?  Why was I ignored after standing in line for an omelet?  Very disappointed, but willing to give this place another shot...but not anytime soon.",QEHoYKMynY7LaAnzsVXR-w,0,0,3,sTNhj4r34UaR9SeUL906uw

I noticed this time around, it changed names and it took some convincing from my hungry boyfriend to just eat here while on our Springs Preserve date than venture off campus. That being said:

We ordered the chicken pesto pizza $10 and a burger (boyfriend never mentioned the name) $9-10 ordered medium rare. The views are beautiful and so relaxing with their floor to ceiling windows overlooking Springs Preserve and the Vegas skyline from the northwestern perspective. Food didn't take long and they brought it to the table. My pizza was definitely not just a personal size. It's good enough for two super hungry people or three people snacking. DELICIOUS. The oils from the cheese were everywhere and when you pull the slice, it had that glorious stretch of soft fresh cheese...the way pizza was meant to be. Johnny's burger was pretty good, better than I would expect. It looked like a gourmet burger with a half pound or so patty cooked medium rare with its juices still intact on a brioche bun. All the condiments you need are already on the table including hot sauces. Oh, and the fountain drinks include a dispenser of water infused with mint and sliced strawberries. With  a squeeze of lemon, it was amazingly refreshing and tasteful for the hot summer day.

I was pleasantly surprised. Definitely had the midrange cafe prices but service, food, and quality was there. Good stuff.",fGRzUxh3oDdLbhkr1Lr8Cw,0,2,4,zyt3ygx1rmPrvjWdduhcmg

The bacon and date flatbread was excellent and I'm not a big fan of dates. I would come back and order that though. I would give that five stars.  

I was not impressed with the sliders on the happy hour menu. Actually very very disappointing. The whoopie sauce was basically ketchup and the buns tasted dry like they had been sitting out for days. The meat was way overcooked and lacked any flavor. 

I had a bite of the lotsa mozza salad. It was good. It didn't look like a traditional salad. It was on a polenta cake that tasted like cornbread and had marinara and arugula on top. It was quite good. I would recommend trying it. 

Also had the chicken Verde nachos. They were huge! Not very impressed with the taste though but nothing really that bad about them either. 

Just whatever you do don't get the sliders or else you may never come back. Glad the other people I came with ordered better than I did and let me sample a little bit of everything on the happy hour menu.

2045504,2016-02-09,0,W1Yr6c2XDx_RBjb6WsV-aQ,"Having seen brochures for the Springs Preserve since long before we moved to Vegas, I thought it was an over-hyped ""pseudo-outdoor"" attraction. And while there is a bit of that (pseudo-rock formations), I am sorry that we waited 3 years into our residency to get here. It's a really educational and beautiful place. 
But the most pleasant surprise was the Divine Cafe. Located on the 2nd floor of the same building that houses the gift shop [and the ""nature exchange""...an awesome idea], the cafe has a small but tasty menu. We were expecting the stale hot dogs and bagged popcorn that most zoos or amusement parks offer; instead we lucked into a new ""favorite"" lunch/brunch spot! This is real Vegas quality food...and we are talking from the perspective of a couple of spoiled Vegas foodies! The burgers are high quality, the shoestring fries are 'divine', the charcuterie plate (while not quite up to the standards of the Andiamo version that I adore) had an assortment of yummy bites at a very decent price. We can't wait to go back and try their brunch and pizza selections!
And like every place in Vegas, the cafe serves a nice selection of adult beverages...again, at a very reasonable price, esp. relative to Strip prices.
If your guests are bored with the Strip...or if they have KIDS, take them to the Springs Preserve. We will be doing that...and we won't make a trip to the preserve without having lunch or brunch at Divine Cafe. Not only is it GOOD food at good prices; but oh, the VIEW of the Strip from the patio.

My friends had the salad bar, a cobb salad, vegan burger and flat bread sandwich (5th friend also had a bento box). The Springs Cafe is all about healthy eating and natural foods so I should have ordered something of that standard.

I want to go back because my dining companion's lunches looked SOOO good, but I definitely will NEVER order another bento box.

Food - we ordered Chicken Milanese, Teriyaki Salmon bowl & rootbeer float with oreo churros - generous portions and were all yummy. They have fruit infused water for all which was great. We're looking forward to trying other items on the menu. Its good to have options beyond the usual burger and hotdog when you are at a park/museum.

Price - reasonable though everything is $10+. Reasonable becoz portions are generous and bcoz prices at themeparks and the like are usually pricier. 

Ambiance - dine inside or outside. The patio has good view of the mountains and of the Las Vegas hotel bldgs. The patio provides enough shade. We dined in September so it was comfortable outside I just dont know how it is in the middle of hot hot Vegas summer =) The whole place is generally clean and well kept.

Service - there seems to be adequate staff... but the food was served longer than expected. But we didn't really mind as we were enjoying the birds while we sat at the patio. All staff from the cashier to the server and table guy we're all very friendly.

We ordered for Brunch on a Sunday around 2PM
1) Chicken and Waffles- Chicken was super dry chicken breast and not served hot. The waffles were super chewy and eggo-waffle-ish (actually ego waffles tastes better) served with slices of orange and straberries- Not recommended
2) Buffalo Chicken Flatbread- 8 pieces of slightly chewy cheese with chopped buffalo chicken- not recommended
3) Cesar salad- Large portion super tasty and great crunch- served with a parmesan crisp (chicken or salmon can be added for 2-3$ extra)
4) Egg Frittata- Super tasty and not very eggy- super cheesy and yummy- served with a side of tatter tots (unusal but good tasting)- Very recommended
5) Bloody Marys- WEAKEST DRINK EVER- We dont even think there was alcohol in it- My friends kept saying it tastes just like tomato juice- spice blend was not present and seems like it comes out of a premade container

Overall the food the was OK. I wish i could give it better stars- the thing that made this worth it was the view. 
Lastly one thing they need to learn how to control is the at least 5-8 pigeons that kept flying around the TV screens and above our heads. My friends kept screaming because the birds were flying so close to us. Also on Sundays please play the NFL games outside!!! Would be an extra bonus

Decent food and a surprisingly gorgeous view of the Strip is the main draw of the Divine Springs Cafe. I came here on Thursday for the Happy Hour special which is from 4pm to 8pm and offers bar food and a decent selection of beers. 

I went with the tater tots, that were free with a donated toy to ""Toys for Tots"", and the Chicken Nachos. I also sampled the house chips that we're placed on the table as soon as  sat down. This place is by no means a hot bed of foodie activity, but a more a refueling station after exploing the preserve.  

The food is on par with most bar bites, nothing was terrible, but it also wasn't mindblowing, it was just good. The Nachos are a huge portion and definitely shareable and the house chips were nice salty snack before we were inundated with salty carby treats. 

They only offer Happy Hour on Thursdays and the menu is pretty limited, but it's perfect food for socializing and catching up with the homies. I would recommend coming here during the day, this way you'll have a chance to snack on their full menu.

I have been here several times since the new change - and I have to admit, I like the new changes they have come up with. There are a few staples, but they also incorporate a lot of new dishes, and that has got my taste buds singing.

Last time I came out here I had the Bento Box, my daughter the grill cheese, and the other couple I was with shared a burger meal. I loved the Bento Box - a little greasy for the egg roll, but everything else was just right!

The specials are swapped out more frequently - and that is a good change to see! It's nice to see fresh ideas moving in, and get the future generations touch of good meals! You can definitely see the urge to please from the employees as you wait for your food. They show genuine concern for your happiness during your meal, and if things are delayed they are genuinely apologetic about it all!

The menu was decent--a good mix of soups, sandwiches, pizza, etc. There is also a weekend brunch menu. My Mimi ordered the burger with fries and I the portobello burger with sweet potato tots. They were tasty and filling, especially since we were hungry from traipsing around the gardens and the Origen Museum, but nothing to gush over. 

The space itself is very large and open. A major plus is that there is a balcony that overlooks the Preserve, so you receive an excellent view of both Downtown and the Strip. It was too chilly to sit out on the balcony, but the large windows sufficed. I did walk out to the balcony later to snap some pics, and yep, it's a great view.

It's out of the way for most tourists visiting the Strip or Downtown and it's a destination most locals don't think of when looking for a meal, unless you're also visiting the exhibits at Springs Preserve. With a kitchen led by Steve Piamchuntar (former chef and owner of Nosh & Swig) they're serving up some surprisingly good dishes for lunch and brunch.

Chef Steve has brought his refined skills and whimsical and modern touch to this cafe. With their recently changed menu they're offering a diverse menu with plenty for adults and kids, alike. Standard American fare like caesar salads, burgers, and pizzas are available. While the burger ($9.50) was decent, non-typical dishes make this place shine compared to other cafes in town. Singapore chicken cups ($9.50) are lettuce wraps with balanced sweetness and savoriness. The pressed chicken milanese ($11) is a must. It eats like a sandwich but has flavors that are fitting for any larger meal. For brunch the pan dulce french toast ($8) was great. More like a creamy bread pudding with bread soaked through with custard, it's perfect for those wanting to satisfy their sweet tooth early in the day. And, to polish off a meal try the root beer float ($6). It's accompanied by an Oreo dusted churro that's as good as any you'll find in town.

My meal was fully comped, but I did tip appropriately. They're typically only open for lunch or brunch, but are open Thursdays and have happy hour specials and live music.",C2C0GPKvzWWnP57Os9eQ0w,14,12,4,ipjyuy76gdRkKCmvrSoU1w

The cafe/venue itself deserves 5 stars all on its own because it is very large and can accommodate large parties, families, or intimate dates inside OR outside.  Outdoor seating would be my preference because it provides a panoramic view of Las Vegas.  You can see downtown as well as the Strip.  However, the indoors gives off a rustic vibe with doors and windows that still have access to that beautiful view.  There's also live music inside which, in my opinion, is uncommon in this city.  For all those reasons, this place is worth a visit.

Their happy hour menu is very limited, but has just enough variety.  They have their own cocktail drinks, a nice selection of bottled beers, and wine.  I was most impressed by the food portions.  We ordered nachos, calamari, and the date flatbread.  I thought they would be tapas style, and boy was I wrong.  The portions were very generous, and for the price, they're almost a steal considering the atmosphere of the restaurant.  Food was great, but my favorite was the bacon and date flatbread.

Had their BBQ pork sandwich, served with homemade crinkle cut chips (very tasty). The BBQ sauce was very smokey flavored, thick and a good balance of sweet and savory. Well done Culinary Institute!

We ended up spending the entire day at Springs Preserve because it is such a large place and there are quite a few exhibits to see, trails to walk/ride, and plenty of places to practice photography.

Since we're locals, we only paid $20 to get in ($10/ea.) and, at the end of the day, they allowed us to turn that $20 into a $45, two-person annual pass!

I took over 500 pictures that day and only spent time in about 60% of Springs Preserve.

I cannot say enough about our wonderful Catering Coordinator, Cindy Yang. She was absolutely a dream to work with. Out of all the vendors I worked with, she was the ONLY one who was seamless all the way through. She responded ultra fast to all of my husbands dozens and dozens of emails. She arranged the most lovely tasting for us before the wedding and met with us numerous times at our request, always pleasant and smiling. After each time that we met up with her, we would stay and have lunch afterward. Every meal we ate at the cafe was soooooo yummy, making me feel very confident that the same level of detail would translate to our reception dinner.  

My whole life I have attended weddings with crappy food. Now, I totally get why people most likely skimp costs on food, being that I spent an arm and a leg on my own wedding meals...but one of the things I swore I would never do was have bad food at my wedding!!! It was high priority to me. 

We ended up kicking off with a cocktail hour, including open bar and a fruit and cheese display outside on the balcony. I was not present for this (taking photos) but I heard it was wonderful!! The dinner for our guests started with Caesar salad, followed by a plated dinner with a double meat entree of steak and turkey (I LOVE turkey, hate chicken!) with garlic whipped potatoes and asparagus. Our vegetarians were delighted with the chef's creation of a light, fresh orzo pasta in place of the meat (it was DELISH!!!!!) I have to say... our food was DIVINE!  EVERYONE complimented us on how delicious our food was and how it was the best wedding food they had ever had! This pleased me beyond measure! Also, knowing that my guests weren't leaving and hitting up In and Out Burger after they left our wedding made me feel that it was all worth it! 

Diving Cafe had such a professional staff, and the head chef overseeing our dinner executed a perfect dinner. The cafe has such a spectacular view of the entire strip from the balcony and the the venue itself is so lovely. It fit perfectly with our ""desert"" themed wedding. 

Other things to note, they supplied the table linen and tableware. BONUS!

I thought it was odd that the boo burger didn't come with any veggies - no lettuce no tomato, nothing. Hello, isn't this place is supposed to promote healthy eating? No veggies? Why?
So basically I got a bun, a burger (which seemed like it came out of your grocers freezer) and a slice of cheese. It reminded me of food while eating in a school cafeteria. Not $9.00 worthy at all!!!
The kid's meals also had those darn frozen dino nuggets and pizza sticks that you can find at Walmart.
Is the food fresh here or what?
Too bad about the food as the view & setting in this restrauant is beautiful.
I know the employees are students but whomever is instructing them needs to step up his/her teaching quickly or there won't be anyone to serve.",_ijx1PqANQVFLGNWCibdig,4,1,2,0FC67QJntMbdnbDoGL8aTw

One of the healthier kids combos we've seen in a while. Our kid loved it.  I had a glass of their Chardonnay, which was fruity and crisp. My husband had their Lager on draft..

I was also kind of hot as late May in Las Vegas is starting to warm up.  To complete my experience I thought I would give Divine Cafe a try.  It did not disappoint.

I ordered a burger because I was hungry.  I ordered an iced tea because I was thirsty.  I ordered a salad because I was hot.  It did not take long for my burger to come out.  And it came out perfect.  I asked for medium and that is exactly what I got.  It was still pink in the center and taste like quality fresh beef.  I had juice dripping down to my elbow so you know it wasn't dry.  The toppings were good too.  A nice thick slice of tomato, greens, super crisp bacon.  It was a fantastic burger.  The salad was pretty good too.  I like the greens they used.  And the cucumber slices were a nice touch.  I would have been upset about not having my choice of dressing but it was exactly what I would have ordered anyway.  A delicious vinaigrette.  The one complaint I had about the salad was the 8 inch long stripps of carrot that looked like orange noodles.  They were kind of hard to eat as they were too thin to be picked up by fork the way everything else was.  Other than that, no complaints.

I was fortunate that the staff at the order window saw I had left my bag from the gift shop at the counter.  I had a couple of things in there I did not want to leave without.  Like my ball cap and sunglasses.  I was worried when I could not find my bag but then I noticed they had pushed it aside and were waiting for me to collect.

During happy hour Thursday's 4-8pm it's 5 stars. Right now probably 4 stars because the coffee tasted pretty trashy, and expensive for lacking in flavor brew ($3).

For food I decided to go with the garden sliders and a side salad. The sliders were not really a veggie patty, but more of a veggie mush. I wish they would have been more patty like, but overall the flavor was still good. (3.5/5) The salad was also a nice touch, very fresh.

4655136,2015-10-19,16,W1Yr6c2XDx_RBjb6WsV-aQ,"Every year I have a tradition of hiking the trails of the Springs Preserve when ghosts, goblins, wicked pumpkins, and other haunted creatures adorn the park. I never got to experience the nightime Haunted Harvest. Knowing that I was going to be in the park all day, I decided to have lunch in the park's Divine Cafe. 

   My expectations of theme park /cultural center food is convenience over quality. However, Divine Cafe exceeded my expectations. It wasn't really a shock because I had been there before to enjoy a beverage. The restaurant did have a positive vibe. Heidi Knapp Rinella in her September 25, 2014 Review Journal article ""Springs Preserve's Divine Cafe True to its Name"" says it best:

       ""The Springs Preserve doesn't have to have
        a cafe. But, like the preserve, it sure makes
        life a lot nicer.""

  As soon as you exit the elevator or climb the steps above the gift shop, you enter a divine space. Your eyes immediately overlook the counter and football field of tables, chairs, and even sofas toward the glass walls with one of the most divine views in Las Vegas. This is a divine vista including a panorama of the Downtown Las Vegas skyline with the Stratosphere and Las Vegas Strip skyline framing the open spaces of dessert and wetlands. When it comes to eating with a view, Divine Cafe is a jackpot. The two places to enjoy the view are from inside and the patio. The inside is like a glass house where many tables are front row.

  Ordering is relatively easy. There are menus outside and at the entrance. I ordered the burger with fries and a fountain beverage. After a Yelp check-in offer for a free beverage with an entree it came to less than $11. The burger was made of the finest ingredients. This was a thick burger with tomatoes, bacon, mayo, and provolone cheese. The fries were plentiful and flavorful. The bottomless cola was refreshing. The condiments on the table made dining a better experience. 

  I was impressed with the service. Immediately the friendly lady greeted me when I walked inside. When I asked if the burger included cheese, she mentioned the four choices the menu omitted. She happily accepted my Yelp check in offer. Minutes after I put my number on the table, a friendly man brought my food to the table. He also cleaned up the plate. Another aspect of good customer service is confidence that no funny stuff is going on with my food. Divine Cafe has an open kitchen where I could see my food being made. Likewise, I know that it is being freshly made. On another note, Divine Cafe is especially clean. To my olfactory scent, the bathroom smelled more like the scented air in the Aria than a public restroom.

   Just like Springs Preserves, Divine Cafe provides a terrific experience at a great price. I was very impressed. Hopefully one day I could make their Thursday Happy Hour and take in the sun going down over the panoramic vista of Downtown and the Las Vegas Strip. Or maybe I'll return for their new weekend brunch. Until then, I will reward Divine Cafe with a review of four stars that says ""I'm impressed!

5027589,2016-12-03,1,W1Yr6c2XDx_RBjb6WsV-aQ,We are members of the springs preserve and eat at this cafe all the time. Monday we went to the cafe  with our homeschool group. It was 4 moms and our kids. All of us  ordered food for us and our kids. 3 of the 11 kids we had with us have special dietary needs. Some are vegetarians and other have gluten and nut issues. When we came in and sat Down a man approached us and welcomed us. I informed him that we would all be ordering food but asked would it be ok if the 3 kids with food issues ate what their mothers brought for them. He said that was not a problem. So we all proceeded to order food for the rest of us. Which was 12 of us not including the 3 eating Their own food. As we were finishing ordering this very rude women started pointing at us and talking to the other workers. I said excuse me is there a problem? She said yes there was that those kids can't eat their lunch in here. I explained that they had food issues and the rest of us had purchased food. She rolled her eyes and said food allergies really? I was so embarrassed and uncomfortable. She said that the owner would never let that happen and that if she came in she would ask is all to leave. I have never felt so unwanted at a restaurant in my life. The owner would ask a group of moms and their kids to leave a restaurant because 3 kids have food issues that they can't help? I find that extremely hard to believe! We go to other restaurants that don't have an issues with this. This is the first place to ever give us a hard time. After we all got our food and were starting to eat she was still pointing at us while were eating and talking to another worker. It was so awful. We could not wait to get out of there. We come to the springs on a regular basis with our school group and we will never be back to this restaurant. We will do our lessons and go somewhere else to eat.

I would have given them a 5 star review but the only reason I couldn't was because they cooked the spinach on the Veggie Benny instead of using fresh spinach leaves. This is more of a preference of mine vs an actual knock on the cafe. The rest of the menu was diverse and had many great, light summer type meals.

I personally enjoy their salads, which are fresh and tossed with just the right amount of dressing. Their pizza is 8 slices, and large enough for a small family to share. The place is clean and neat, and the ambiance is just incredible.
The staff is less than impressive. On each of my last three visits, I have particularly had bad experiences with the cashier. The first time she mistook my order and did not charge me for a third drink (I ordered a kids meal and three extra drinks, she mistook the drink that came with the kids meal as one of the extra three). When I grabbed my fourth drink from the fridge and turned to leave, she yelled ""Ma'am, you have to pay for that!"" As if my paying $60 for lunch suggested I was trying to lift a juice box. To top it off, she had me go to the back of the line to pay for the drink. I let it go. 
On my second visit, she mistook my order again. No big deal. We corrected it then and there. All was fine, but not the best, because I couldn't help but think ""Really, same person... Again?!""
Last weekend, I went for a third visit after a long afternoon of roaming the preserve. I placed my order, and believe it or not, the same woman mistook my order. I had to repeat it slowly and holding the most uncomfortable eye contact... ever. At this point in my review, I feel completely confident in stating this person undoubtedly recognized me, and had absolutely done this on purpose, because such stupidity is just not possible. Anyways, we had lunch. Washed our hands, made it down the elevator with a stroller, 5 children and friend, when my oldest realized he dropped some money at the table. We all rush back up to look for it. Alas, it was gone. I held the door as all of my tribe walked out of the restaurant, but my oldest B-Lined to the cashier. He asked her if she had found any money laying around, and she had the nerve to lean over the counter and say ""Honey, no one is giving you money here.""
To the establishment's management, unfortunately, I will no longer be giving my money to the rude, smart mouthed, but none the less beautiful, young woman at your cash register. 
Your food is great. The price is appropriate and the variety of food is healthy and tasty. But, the general customer service has left this mom feeling very disgruntled. Luckily, the Springs Preserve allows for food and drinks to be brought in.",U0txm3B2AOPUBJsPXWhp_Q,1,0,2,QTTub7SPMcLhXEZUAHzOJQ

5336999,2016-02-29,0,W1Yr6c2XDx_RBjb6WsV-aQ,"I've been meaning to check out this cafe (and the Springs Preserve) for awhile, and am happy to say it's definitely a place I'll be keeping on my ""go to"" list.  As other reviewers have pointed out, you don't need to be a member of Springs Preserve to go to the Divine Cafe, although I would highly recommend making a pleasant day/afternoon of it and seeing the Preserve, along with the Nevada State Museum which is also there on the grounds.   It's extremely interesting, educational and also great if you have out of town relatives or friends who are bored with the same old same old hotels, bars, Strip stuff.  

Divine Cafe is wonderful to get away from  the noise, congestion and tourists - that's why so many locals have found it and enjoy going there for a bite.  It's located on the second floor near the Origen building.  You can take the elevator or stairs to get there.  It's a very open, clean and attractive space with indoor and outdoor patio seating.  If you sit on the patio/deck as I did, you can get a beautiful panoramic view of the surrounding area, the Preserves, and off in the distance, the Strip. On a lovely day with cooler weather, it's certainly one of the more pleasant destinations around!

You order your food from a nicely varied menu that serves up food every bit as good as any restaurant in town. As others have pointed out, this is not some cheapo snack bar with crappy burgers and hot dogs.  This is quality food.   When you place your order, they give you a cute little table holder with your order number.  You can sit anywhere you like, indoor or outside.    Yes, the prices are a bit on the high side, thus my four stars, however, it may be worth it to you for the location and quality.  I had the Angus burger ($9.50) and it was very good.  High quality beef, bacon strips, arugula leaves instead of the usual lettuce....I was very pleased! I ordered it ""well done"" and guess what?  It was cooked PERFECTLY!  None of that icky red beef that seems to be the ""in"" thing for burgers these days.  And the meat patty was still wonderfully juicy and had that top sirloin flavor that you'd expect from high quality beef. The bacon strips were also perfect - neither too thick nor too thin, crunchy yet not chewy as is often found on burgers today.  It  came with fries which were nicely seasoned, crisp, and flavorful.    

In addition to the burger, I had the hazelnut beignets which came with TWO yummy dipping sauces - raspberry and caramel.  Price:  $6.00.  Again, a bit pricey but there was enough for two, so it was definitely splittable.  Total:  a bit over $16.00.  But hey, this is sort of a unique place, in the Preserves, with a view, so I guess you'd have to say you're paying for the ambiance.  The food is very good and is really  better than other places I've been, both on and off the Strip.  Bottom line, I'd for sure go back and would be happy to bring out of town visitors here for an enjoyable day of browsing the Spring Preserves and then topping it off with a lovely lunch/brunch on the patio looking out at the view. You can also order beer and wine, although I didn't check that out.  I can see how it would be really nice to sit with a drink for awhile there.   Servers and staff were friendly helpful and very professional.    

Divine Cafe opens at 11am (weekdays), 10am on weekends (brunch),  and closes  at 3pm, so be sure to time your Preserves browsing to end  back at Divine Cafe around 1:00 or so, you don't want to feel rushed to eat and leave by 3pm.   Thanks Divine Cafe, for a very enjoyable meal!  Looking forward to doing brunch next time and having  the french toast! I'm sure it's fab!",r1Z8dxSnd7T4XEAhVUoA0Q,5,4,4,mQblFEe8KpV1fQb5z4jKag

My husband enjoyed his fish tacos and my kids could have split a kids meal, the pbj and grilled cheese sandwiches were huge and the fruit bowl that comes with the kids meal is huge too .. all for $4 per kids meal (sandwich, fruit and milk).",GPQEegLxfYuCew6HD5ff0w,0,0,4,iZJWk_t2ay4wBAjZEOlGVQ
5364427,2015-08-06,0,W1Yr6c2XDx_RBjb6WsV-aQ,Excellent food. Nothing like you would expect. We ordered the happy hour appetizers Chocolate filled beignets and the Bacon and Deviled eggs. Not only was I surprised about the presentation but the food was excellent and very flavorfully creative!!! I say give this place a try. You'll be just as surprised as I was. The only thing I would say is that the food takes quite a while to get to your table.,Duew9xoGUgMmo5Okflctig,2,1,5,7sG9O_U5FGDjOSPSa33DGw

5378503,2017-08-15,0,W1Yr6c2XDx_RBjb6WsV-aQ,This is one of the best places in Las Vegas that probably not too many people know about. I've been a member of the Spring Preserve for over 4 years and have had many experiences here from the museums to the numerous events held here. My family is here whenever we get a chance. The café has good food and happy hour on Thursday (this is a good excuse to spend an evening at the Preserve minus the kids). You also get a panoramic view of downtown and the strip from the café's balcony,pczQiBA6irhjwq9ymLsbZw,0,0,5,hPEro3-hE0tTXzY8H7wrog
5418416,2016-04-17,0,W1Yr6c2XDx_RBjb6WsV-aQ,"I almost hate to write to this review because sometimes you want to keep a great secret all to yourself. That's what I feel the Divine Café is - it's a place that not many people know about which is a shame because it's such a great place. It's a very open, casual place where the mix of customers seem to all be enjoying their meals. We go to the Divine Café every Saturday unless something comes up or I'm out of town and it seems like I always have the burger with cheddar cheese. These burgers are huge and come with either salad, fries, or their homemade chips. They are topped with lettuce, tomato, bacon, and a really great pepper mayonnaise.  I've had great burgers here in Vegas, but for me all those other burgers don't compare to the burger here. This is the place with the best burgers. I always take the family so I've ""tasted"" other items from their menu and have to say that I have enjoyed everything I've tasted there. 

The Divine Café is located at the Springs Preserve so after eating we walk the trails or see the exhibits they have to offer. As members we get ten percent off our meal. The staff is always friendly - from the person taking our order to the person who brings the food to the table. It's a great place. The café has a great outdoor seating area that gives you a great view of the city. We love to sit outside and enjoy good company, good atmosphere, and good food.

When I have out of town guests come to visit you know that before they leave Vegas they are going to the Divine Café.",K5U3d-0881vBBy84wJlK8w,3,4,4,BTyFvRC2YcMaNaqlhWdy_w
5435913,2016-02-22,0,W1Yr6c2XDx_RBjb6WsV-aQ,"Divine Cafe is connected to the Spring Preserves, but there is no need to be a member to dine here. If you are a member you get 10% off of your meal and membership is worth it IMHO. After having a delightful lunch you can explore all the Spring Preserves has to offer!

I almost always eat outside, where you have a fantastic view of the Strip. This last visit I shared the Cuban Sandwich with sweet potato tots  and  Pizza Blanca with my boyfriend. The pizza was terrific!  And my new favorite sides are the sweet potato tots. 

The outdoor seating area does have heaters when it is chilly. Happy hour is on Thursdays 4pm to 8pm. They sometimes have classes on how to cook too.",HLY9oDcVBH9D25lU4X_V5Q,3,3,4,v0MTXOINe4LP5Iwl-hi0EQ

We've attended a few of their  special events (Fathers Day, Mothers Day, etc), the Thursday night happy hour numerous times and quite a few regular lunches and we've NEVER been disappointed.  

The food is excellent and very affordable, the service has always been top notch and who could complaine about the fantastic view??

If you're looking for a great place for a brunch, lunch or happy hour, you couldn't do better than Divine Cafe at Springs Preserve!

Also an excellent place to bring out of town guests, such a beautiful place to stroll around after a great meal!",qHmuuVsrXFTxM3ni1HyvIQ,0,0,5,oWWACvwOTPMGZHLow6Svhg

5583172,2013-11-17,1,W1Yr6c2XDx_RBjb6WsV-aQ,"Most of us have gone to a theme park and been greatly disappointed by the food services.  Usually prepackaged, microwaved fare or fast food level, or super pricey)   Even the great San Diego Zoo has mediocre food for the most part (although if you search they do have some gems).  So I have to say I was pleasantly surprised at the Springs Cafe which offers well prepared, gourmet style lunches and entrees at reasonable prices.  I had a ceviche salad that was excellent.  The hamburgers were great and the sides excellent.  The sundays were tasty.

This isn't a gourmet location though and the service is underwhelming, the ambiance mediocre. In fact the service was very poor, they tried to bring our deserts (we got free sundays with the coupon on the flyer) at the same time as the meal. Then when we got them to understand we wanted them to wait on delivery, they got mixed up as to how many we ordered.  Also the food takes a while.  But the food is worth it and even the picky eaters I was with enjoyed their meal without complaints, not an easy task.",wnO99pBbGqwqOoTQM25iCw,2,3,4,e2HoFTp2evn74lK6DbSooA

The Divine Cafe at the Springs Preserve is serving up some good eats and it doesn't seem that many people know about it.  I came here several years ago and it's changed management since then.  All that matters now is that you should come and check it out.

The patio has a great view of the Strip or you can sit inside where there are plenty of tables as well as high-tops.  Located at the Springs Preserve, I've seen a mixture of customers, from business folks having lunch meetings to moms and kids eating before or after their time exploring the Preserve.  Being in the Springs Preserve is part of what makes this café so divine:  you can use the trails to walk or run, visit the museums, then grab a bite here.  
The menu offers salads, small bites, burgers, sandwiches, pizza (gluten-free crust available), a kids' menu, plus the excellent desserts.  You should come here if you want to have the root beer float with the Oreo-dusted churro or the Hazelnut Chocolate Beignets or just have both; I've had both and they're both highly recommended.
Service has been top-rate and there is just an overall relaxed vibe here with people enjoying the atmosphere and their meals.
Discover Divine Café soon and see what you've been missing.

*Note: you can get a trail pass for free if you just want to walk the grounds without paying for the museums or exhibits, especially if you come on a regular basis.  I come here with my girlfriend and her baby and we just use the trails.
Just stop at the ticket booth first and they'll give you a pass.",7Oe6ikklTjVBbEFw9emLcA,12,12,5,jKTNTp-kbtkhLqtKf_sQjQ

I love the variety of food they offer and the specials. It is near my work so every now and then I come over and dine here. I really enjoy their fresh, creative salads, the flatbreads are tasty and just last week I tried the special being tacos since it was Taco Tuesday. The service is good and looking out over the Springs Preserve into the city is absolutely beautiful not to mention relaxing. I love that they have a happy hour on Thursdays where one can come have a drink and listen to some music before heading home. As we all know driving up the 95 kinda stinks at the old 5:00 hour. They also offer creative cooking classes which I have yet to try as I am not Giada but maybe I will get around to it someday. This is a great kick back spot and we need to support this place.

Went thru half of the burger and I had to stop. The quality of the food is really poor.
There is almost no taste in the food.
The quesadilla is not any better .....
Overall it's worst than bar food .... 

Recommend to hire a chief that cares about the food he serves and add some flavor in your food....
