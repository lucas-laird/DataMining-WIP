It is $50 a person minimum, the servers take forever to get around to you, and their burgers are not only cold, but tasteless. I have had better food from someone who was grilling outside of a grocery store. Oh, and if you have the audacity to ask for extra pickles, the server will look at you like you have leprosy. This place sucks. Go to McDonalds, at least there you know you are paying for shitty food. The only reason that this place gets even one star from me is that the little corn dogs are pretty good. You can buy little corn dogs at a gas station though. In reality, this place should get .5/5 stars. Horrible.

She had really long blond hair passed her waist.  Anywho, we had a Groupon for 4 drinks and 2 entrees.  It was supposed to come with passes to get into the club.  We didn't mention it because we bought it more for the food but no one said anything to us about it either so you will have to ask about that.  Between the 2 of us we ordered The Ainsworth, The Blind Stud, The Off Suit, and the Hot and Spicy Margarita cocktails.  All were good and gave us a nice buzz to start our evening.  For food we had the Tuna Tartar Tacos and the Hot Buffalo Wings.  The wings weren't too hot but they were tasty and juicy and came with celery and carrot sticks and blue cheese for dipping.  The tacos had a crispy taco shell which wasn't quite what I expected but they were okay.  They had too much sauce on them though.  Overall, the food was okay and the drinks were good but a tad pricey at normal price.  But, this is Vegas and all drinks are expensive.

The place is nice, not too big the bar only had about 8-9 seats. 
They have another bar in the middle of the place looking straight towards the karaoke stage(more like a step with a mic) and the big screen TVs.
I'm not a big fan of TVs in the bars like this one, but I guess they should have them for the karaoke night. That night they were playing ""Wedding Crashers"" and ""The Dark Kight"", to me this is not a great use of big screens in a bar like this one.
The drinks were good and you should always ask for a tall glass, since it's the same price but is bigger :)
Don Julio will cost you $12 in regular hour and the cocktails will be $15.

For our party, there was a good dj, and silhouette dancers projected onto the tv screens (I'm assuming those screens usually show sports and the like). The drinks were good and reasonably priced by Strip standards.  My only complaint was that it seemed under-ventilated for the party space (no air conditioning), so it got quite hot, quite fast.

I was not there after 9pm, so not sure how it changes. On a Friday night at 7pm we had no problem getting a table (the tables are nicely set-up and could set groups well). This could be a very fun place to relax later in the evening, especially since they had some great drink specials.

The drinks were fine. We had a TravelZoo deal for 6 cocktails for $30---which was about right for the drinks we got.  I ordered the Blind Stud, which was grapefruit vodka, absinth and ginger beer. It was good, but a little sweet. My companion ordered the Hot and Spicy Margarita.  They were out of jalapenos, but our server went to the kitchen after bringing our drinks and got her a side of sliced jalapenos--it was fine, slightly spicy, but a little too sweet.  We finished our night there were a few extra dirty martinis, that were not dirty at all (we had to ask for extra olive juice to be brought out since they were mostly just vodka).

Before I plow into that stuff, here is the important parts: 

Food: reheated, terribly average for the price.  We noticed the mac and cheese had a Cheez-it crust (weird the diner mere 25 feet away serves that exact dish for $5.99) yet the Ainsworth's was dry and needed more cream, I had a burger and the bun looked like it had been smashed and the avocado was so brown it looked rotten, sirloin sliders were pathetic (but we only tried those because they messed up the order and sent it by mistake).  Menu itself is pretty small.  Go to Mr. Lucky's and get the food warm and with fresh condiments.

Drinks: watered down and served in Vegas style tiny juice glasses.  I would get one and save yourself the trouble, or just get one from the cocktail servers on the floor of the casino.

Service:  we had a wonderful waitress who was personable and fun...but after we had asked for nightclub suggestions, she suggested only one, but minutes later the guy (wearing an Ainsworth t-shirt, trucker hat) who had shown us to our table came over and said ""I heard you ladies want to know about clubs for tonight.""  How great right?!  Skoti as his card said (which also says he's the marketing and social media manager for the Ainsworth) told us he could get us bottle service at the hottest nightclub for that night, the same one our waitress suggested (go figure!)....off the property.  And not only that but it would be COMPED!  We would just have to pay tax and gratuity (only $175) to HIM, not the club.  And just to make sure we got in, he was going to leave the Hard Rock, take a cab with us, accept payment on our behalf outside the nightclub...all out of kindness and great service.

Apparently, we look like idiots.  When we started asking questions he threw out, ""this is Vegas, this is how it works, you pay me then I pay them"" & ""no one has questioned this deal before.""

Thankfully, we were born at night, but not the night before, so we decided to finish what we could and get the check and go.  Only now, the nice waitress was gone, she didn't even make eye contact with us (not even to bring the water and drink refills we had been waiting half and hour for)...we now had some angry server who had zero patience for us trying to split the bill to pay with cash.  Sadly, we hauled ass out of there and cringed every time we had to walk by the rest of our trip.  I hope someone from the Paige Group in NY sees this and realizes they have an employee who is tainting their Vegas outpost by trying to take money under the table from guests.",0t5pRoUDUxYQCrkF_aLDuA,2,0,1,jDudtCKDeBCwOHaKVgy9xQ

We negotiated the bottle price with the host, they agreed to give us $300 for a 720ml Ketel one, including 4 monsters, mixers and tips, not bad huh... But it was just a small lounge after all, they needed bottle business. :) 

Of course we couldn't finish that bottle, ended up having people over to help us drink it up. Everybody was nice, polite and fun. The couple at the table next to us gave us champagne, we gave them our vodka, very friendly crowd! 

They have a DJ spinning, a small dance floor, it was not crowded at all, that's why I love small lounges, much better than night clubs, and less super drunk and aggressive guys too.

3372666,2012-09-12,2,pCunE3wX3W7LUQHcr17Hxw,"I had the pleasure of spending the NFL's opening weekend at The Ainsworth, which just opened on September 4, 2012.  Our buddy had his bachelor party in Vegas, and what better way to cap it off than an entire day of football and hot 5 way action (parlays, that is).  In a town that caters to everyone's vices, it's hard to believe that Vegas lacked an upscale sports bar with food and in-house sports book.  Thankfully, The Ainsworth has transplanted their successful sports bar in NYC to the Hard Rock Hotel in Vegas.  Just be sure you make reservations for your group ahead of time.  We had reservations for 10AM and stayed until the last game, as did a majority of the other tables.  Also, the table must run a $50/person minimum tab (food and drinks), but if you're staying for the morning and afternoon games, this won't be an issue.  

The food menu consists of your standard bar food:  wings, fries, burgers, and an assortment of sliders - all ranging from $10 to $17.  Beers were around $7 and cocktails ranged from $11-$15.  

I took off one star because of the space's design.  I'm gonna try and paint a mental image here, so hopefully this will help you picture the space in your mind.  I've also added some photos to help.  The wall above the bar houses one large flat-screen flanked on both sides by 4 smaller flat screens.  The perimeter wall directly opposite the bar is lined with 5 tables and 5 smaller flat-screens.  In between the bar and the perimeter wall is empty space for the standing room crowd.  Most sports bars elevate the tables and chairs along the perimeter walls on a raised surface.  They do this so your view isn't obstructed by people standing between you and the TVs.  The tables at Ainsworth are at ground level, so you maybe jockeying for viewing position with folks standing by the bar.  The photos were taken before the game started - so people were just starting to enter.  The crowd was only an issue for the first couple hours as the standing room crowd started to dwindle as the games progressed.  Luckily, the manager will be more than happy to put on whatever game you want on the TV directly above your table, in case your view is obstructed.  Otherwise, it's an easy fix if they decide to make a design change.",VJjJG82xVcNYjwIX-20iCQ,6,3,4,GUkg0wi1zcxCGAUt3FhDjA

Knowing this event was happening, I wish they had more bartenders and servers on staff, but the few that were working appeared to be doing the best they could to keep up with the large crowd. During the day The Ainsworth is a sports bar and at night it turns into something with more of a lounge/club vibe. I was only here during the day and they had sports as well music videos playing on the many tv's mounted all over. They had about 8 specialty drinks on the menu and offered bottle service. There is also a food menu that has appetizers like wings ($13), quesadillas ($11), tater tots ($11), onion rings ($13), jalapeno poppers ($17) and fried shrimp ($23) as well sandwiches like BLTA ($16), pot roast sandwich ($17) and a top shelf grilled cheese sandwich that has a crab cake in it with a $17 price tag. I'd recommend coming here during HH since the prices seem high on certain items. Even though drink and food menus were passed around, I only saw people ordering drinks, so I never got to see if the portion of the food might have been worth the price. If watching sports is your thing then i'd recommend this place during the day if you are used to paying casino prices and don't mind it. I'd come back if it were for a specific event like this visit was for or if someone I was with wanted to stop by for a drink, but I wouldn't come here on my own just for drinks or to hang.",Fv0e9RIV9jw5TX3ctA1WbA,35,36,3,-6WNe5yrEYH3oqen7bvsdg

I came in for the $5 happy hour, ordered two basic cocktails (1 spirit+soda mixer) each were charged at more than twice the posted price and nothing was done to fix it. The extra money won't kill anyone but dishonesty in any establishment should not be condoned.
Furthermore, when I expressed my disappointment with the manager he told me that a dark'n stormy had sloe gin in it among many other ingredients which have no place in such a cocktail. It's rum and ginger beer, any bartender should know that.

Nope, not even once! I could understand if it was really busy, or even slightly busy but I don't even think the first time that there was 10 people in the entire bar.

I couldn't get the waitress' attention so I found a manager who took it back.  However, I later heard him stating that the food couldn't have been cold since it had just come out. If that was the case, the server must have stopped at the minus 5 bar first because the tater tots, chicken and cheesesteak were actually cool to the touch, not even luke warm.  Anyway, while we were waiting for round two,our waitress came up and said ""we checked your food and it was cold so we didn't want to serve it like that so we are getting you new food.""  This was funny since they did serve it like that and I was the one who took it to the manager.  Still, we were treated to a shot which was classy.  However, the food arrived and it was clear they took our food and reheated it. The cheesesteak which had the cheese on top when it arrived now had it melted and mixed, the rolls for the cheesesteak were stale on the ends, the tater tots were hot but overcooked and the chicken was dry.  I will take up the groupon issues later with groupon directly.

We had a great time drinking for a few hours after though so for a bar, this place still rocks but our dining experience was disappointing.  Drinks are, like most hot venues, pricey (14-15 per special drink, 10-14 for well) except happy hour (see previous review.)
