They have really good iced tea, avaiable in 3 flavors- including unsweetened peach black tea and passion berry (amazing!).  Their coffee is fair trade organic and varies daily.  They have a small selection of pastries and some breakfast and lunch options (vegan friendly).  They have a good breakfast burrito with eggs, potatoes, beans, cheese, fresh avocado and lots of spinach.  There are comfy seats and a bookcase full of books, however they are only open till 8pm.  Awesome eclectic staff, super friendly and knowledgeable about their coffees.  I wish they had a larger/better pastry selection and were open later.  We need a place in Vegas that is comparable to the living room in SD, and this is the closest I have found so far!  I so wish they'd open one in the Summerlin-ish area!!",dEgO4_n8thLMbG1dKfFMHg,0,0,4,Hu4-DKakumqEqlAG1yGD6w

They care about their product (i.e. took special care to re-pull my espresso when it didn't meet their high-quality standards) and their customers (i.e. stamp-cards!).

I've sampled espresso from more Las Vegas coffee houses than I have fingers to count on, and this is by far some of the best I've had in Vegas.

I was recently introduced to one of the smoothies that isn't regularly on the menu, it was called the ""kitchen sink"", or something along those lines, and WOW, Its lightly sweet and full of healthy goodies(and vegan, of which I am as well).  One of the best smoothies I've had locally.

They have many vegetarian options on their menu (not so sure about vegan as I'm not a vegan).  Great value and a great place.  I will continue to make them my coffee stope as long as I am traveling to Vegas every week.

I ordered the Hazelnut Latte and the Alien Burrito.

The Hazelnut Latte was fantastic, and one of the better lattes i've drank. The coffee and the hazelnut don't overpower each other. You don't taste the bitterness of the coffee and you don't taste too much of the hazelnut, just a hint of it. 

The Alien Burrito is a vegetarian option. It has cous cous, refried beans, hummus, tomato, red bell pepper, and lettuce in a spinach tortilla wrap. I used to think that being a vegetarian would be the worst thing ever because i'm always thinking, ""what the hell do I eat?"". But if there more vegetarian options like this, it wouldn't be too bad.

If it weren't too far from my side of town, I'd start my day off with a soy latte from here every morning. When my sweet tooth wants to be unleashed, I'll go for their nutella, creme brulee, or caramel vanilla lattes. Hungry? This place has an out of this world alien burrito. The raves on this dish don't lie. Also, don't forget to overlook their vegan coffee cake. It's not always offered so when it is, take advantage of it. It's another winner in my book.

Staff is welcoming and friendly. Ambiance is chill-great place to study or to catch up with friends.

The place is a bit small and it tends to get overcrowded at times but what they have to offer compensates for that. They've recently extended their hours and close at 9 p everyday with a happy hour from 6-9 with $2 lattes and $1 pastries. Win! Plus, during the holidays, they offer a holiday menu. The spank me santa, sugar cookie, and butterbeer lattes are my go to ones. 

Definitely a fan of this place and can without a doubt say, this is my favorite coffee shop in Vegas. Check it out if you haven't yet!

100106,2013-05-20,1,UMqfeCItzQ2glr4d9apGlA,"WHERE SHOULD I START?!
I remember seeing this place for at least three or four years and praying that they'd stay open being that it's a local coffee place in a deserted strip mall. Don't know why I never went in till this past winter and HOW I REGRET NOT GOING IN SOONER!
I go too much now! (Even had to make a Mint budget for this place- I'm that bad lol!)

LOVE all their gourmet coffees. 
Favs: Mexican Mocha, Creme Brûlée. (The only one I don't care for is the Truffle Berry one. But it's my boyfriends favorite!) 
Really diggin their iced teas, favs: Orchard tea... went in yesterday though and I guess it's changed to the south western or something? Forgot the replacement's name. Their Passion tea as well. 
Their Green Tea Iced Latte is really delicious too!

Some picky pros: they offer almond and rice milk for the coffees (I don't like cow's milk much). I also like their different options of sweetener for the teas as well; raw for me. They have some glasses with a water dispenser that you can help yourself to at any time. They have a drive-thru!!! Praise the Lord for this on the days that I'm running late to class/work!

Their happy hour is wonderful- starts at 5pm- dollar reg. coffees and pastries! Love getting their vegan coffee cake, blueberry scones, chocolate chip pumpkin muffin.

The atmosphere is cool, great place to study when it isn't too busy. The weekends can get a little crazy but it's worth it. The sweet owners lurk around and hang out there. I do miss the loveseat-like couch they had in one corner but the new L-shaped bench definitely accommodates more people. The outside patio is really cute. They make the furniture, neat-o.

Lastly, their staff is just lovely. Everyone is very nice and outgoing!! It's just got a very warm feeling every time I go in there. That's what I can appreciate about a place: when you make a customer having a bad day peel a smile on their face. Service!

I've had better, sure, but this is a MUCH better option than the corporate giants. As per my usual order, I just got a coffee with room and added my own cream. Considering I was actually able to pick out real flavors from the coffee, I'd call this a win. The only bad part was having to wait for them to actually brew it, but considering they offerred me a free drink card for waiting, all I got from that experience is that they actually care about making customers happy.

The only reason this is a 4/5 review instead of a perfect score is that the coffee was good but not great; that's pretty much the whole reason. Anyway, next time I'm in Vegas, I'll definitely come back here for my brew.",InR6HZ4Vgvrgb0hdeG8Ixw,0,0,4,vhT6KESOL35mHI3ZzQjDOg

First off I have to admit that I DON'T like coffee. With that being said I was taking a risk, and possibly opting for a smoothie or tea once I arrived. I went with my younger sister, and although she is only 10 years old, she loves coffee.

As soon as I walked in I noticed all the tables and chairs were taken except for one. That meant it was a to-go order for me! Everyone was busy doing something, reminded me of an actual coffee shop, like the ones you see in movies. I really liked it. 

I felt like such a newbie! I ordered a Creme Brulee Latte and my sister order a Caramel Vanilla latte iced. We also ordered the Alien burrito. Out of my excitement to try this coffee I forgot to order it with soy milk instead of regular, being I am lactose intolerant. Luckily I had my pills with me!  Hurray! The food and coffee was ready in minutes. As soon as I took a sip of coffee I realized how much I now loved coffee... well, at least from Sunrise Coffee! My sister's latte was just as delicious! Ah I can't explain the amazing-ness. 

The burrito was where I was a bit stunned. I had read raving reviews, but when I tasted it... it felt like it was missing something. Like salt or meat? I am not a vegetarian or vegan therefore I usually like meat. It was still worth a try. As soon as I got home I added extra avocado, salt, more vegetables. I didn't like the fact I had to fix it up a bit myself, but the taste itself was much better afterwards. I love vegetables maybe I can ask for more if I ever decide to order it again, but I most likely won't. On the plus side, might I mention how healthy and guilt-free I felt afterwards?!

 I will definitely be back for the coffee and possibly try some newfood items on the menu.",i-y3RYc1uTk7XlVFxdQrzw,0,0,4,O6Lrp0ihQ78Xc2_ifw0j8g

When I first starting going to Sunrise Coffee it wasn't nearly as busy as it is now.  I would sit there for three or four hours and see no more than 20 people come and go.  But I think with all these wonderful reviews they are accumulating a much larger fan base! This is the exact opposite of drive-thru coffee, so it takes more than 30 seconds to prepare a drink, but it is always worth the wait.  Some people stand right by the bar and stare at the barista while drumming their fingers waiting for their drink.  Which really irks me because it distracts from the laid-back environment where it is almost impossible to NOT sit down, relax, and stay awhile.  The employees are friendly, personable, and seems like they get along well with each other and enjoy their job.

Since we've been customers for so long this review comes after not once, twice, or even three times of our order being messed up - this is coming after #4. The three biggest errors have been giving me dairy on my vegan bagels/burritos, and with 5 years of ordering food dairy free I know these haven't been my mistakes. The most enraging experience was when regular cream cheese came on my bagel, I took a bite, and spent the rest of the day with cramps and bubble guts (Yep, from one bite).

So, cool, they can't get an order right anymore, but the service is terrible lately too minus a few familiar faces from OG baristas. It's one thing to make a poor excuse for an iced hazelnut latte (literally making drinks is your job?) but a whole other thing to be super rude when all I wanted to do was exchange it for something drinkable. 

I did stop ordering anything besides pre-made diary free pastries and tried to switch to cold brew to prevent further drink errors but somehow was charged $5.90 for a medium cold brew in my own cup & won't be going that route anymore.

572175,2010-12-10,3,UMqfeCItzQ2glr4d9apGlA,"So, even though I've sworn off caffeine for the foreseeable future, I get talked into visiting a local coffee place by my girlfriend and my housemate. The girlfriend just wants to go because she's seized by a sudden need for a pastry, and my housemate wants to go because he is harboring entrepreneurial aspirations and wants to scout out the local market.

So, okay, I go. Never mind that this is like asking a newly-recovering alcoholic to take a tour of a winery. I go.

Sunrise Coffee Company sits just west of Pecos on Sunset Road and looks like your run-of-the-grinder Starbucks knock-off, except that their selection of snacks is even more limited. (So the Princess had to settle for a muffin!) But there's a BIG DIFFERENCE: they really know how to serve a beverage. They focus on quality ingredients to make drinks that would put the average green-aproned barista to shame.

Because I'm on the caffeine wagon, I order a peppermint tea, which irks me, because I just can't see paying a coffee price for something that's essentially made by dunking a bag of leaves into a cup of hot water. So, while the Princess raves about her mocha and my housemate raves about his latte, I get stuck with aromatic broth.

Then I take a sip....

Wow. The tea is pungent with mint and yet somehow manages to avoid the bitterness that often is the aftertaste of such herbal strength.

Which is to say I'm happy that I went to Sunrise Coffee Company and I hope they have continued success in their uphill battle against both the economy and Big Green. I plan to keep coming back.",waadolhBnW9k2YexoLruLg,2,1,4,eHjbcqOE1naUEDlmg01nBQ

583307,2013-01-23,0,UMqfeCItzQ2glr4d9apGlA,"Hands down the best coffee shop in Vegas, and my personal favorite obviously.

I'm vegan, and I am a regular customer as I usually stop by a couple times a week on my way to class in the morning to get my coffee and bagel fix. I'll start by saying that their coffee, tea, and vegan food/pastries are delicious. They have the most amazing pumpkin spice latte, which is what I get almost every time, along with an everything bagel (all of their bagel flavors are awesome) with vegan cream cheese, and sometimes one of their vegan pumpkin chocolate chip muffins. I am never disappointed with my order.

Also, more importantly, the service at Sunrise Coffee is phenomenal. Every single employee there works hard, always has a smile on their face, and they are all some of the nicest people I've ever encountered at a food establishment before. In fact, I stopped by today on my way to class, and drive-thru service is always very quick and efficient, but today it took a just a little bit longer than usual (which was TOTALLY okay with me, it was no problem at all). I already had my coffee and pastry, I was just waiting on my bagel, and as soon as the kind woman working the drive-thru opened the window, she immediately apologized for the wait (which was not even long), and proceeded to hand me a free drink coupon for next time.

Sunrise is SUCH a sweet local place for getting work done, enjoying good coffee & coincidentally, going on dates! Long story shortened: my sister and her fiancé met at Sunrise Coffee. Since it's such a special place for them, when he was ready to propose, he enlisted myself and other sister to help with the details of the night. We asked the staff if we could rent out the patio and they would not accept any money, but were so excited and helpful that they strung bulb lights just for the occasion. They also let us come early and decorate the patio with rose petals and candles, as we packed it full of 40 people. They stayed open an hour later than normal and even made a special playlist of love songs for the night. My sister was completely caught off guard and we celebrated the engagement with the happy, friendly staff of Sunrise, drinking hot cocoas and eating their delicious baked goods & chocolate.

So I ate, but the nature of my allergies mean there is a bit of a delayed time between when eat and when I get sick. 
And I got, very very sick. 
I kept blaming other things, thinking the other restaurants I was choosing were making me sick. 
I was wrong. 
I came in to eat today. They once again confirmed everything was dairy free. 
I sat waiting to eat and when a women named Adriana came out and said ""sorry, the gluten free bread and the egg are cooked with dairy"". 
I sat stunned. She gave me my money back, but she didn't even give me apology, just an excuse about how baristas don't know about the menu. She was visibly annoyed with me and apathetic to what I was trying to say. It was insulting in the highest degree. 
This is a restaurant that advertises for people like me to eat there. Each time someone walked into the kitchen and confirmed,  I was safe to eat.

Whatever dietary restrictions you have, whether you are vegetarian, vegan, gluten free, dairy free, etc, It is not safe to eat here. Your preference will be disrespected. Your allergy ignored . Like me you could become very sick.

Food is delicious, especially the croissant egg sandwich - FYI for low-carbers they can turn any sandwich item into a salad.  While they are clearly into natural, organic, vegan food, it's not done to the point of excluding everything else - they still provide normal things like half-and-half and Splenda.

It's an extremely welcoming place, and even when it's busy, there's always a seat somewhere.  The crowd is an interesting mix - everyone from cops to bikers, professors to students, families, startups having work meetings, etc.  The owners are often around (though you wouldn't be able to tell them from the staff), and they have personally put a lot of hands-on effort into developing the store, giving it a unique character.",g-9s-AbJb70Sc-gHx47b2w,1,0,5,U51b9lUidJQ70bmEX2-sAQ

1024630,2012-05-31,1,UMqfeCItzQ2glr4d9apGlA,"Situated just a few miles away from UNLV lies Sunrise Coffee, the third of  The Rebel Yell's independent coffee shop explorations. Located across the street from Sunset Park, just down Sunset Road. You can visit Monday through Friday from 6 a.m. to 8 p.m., Saturday 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. and Sunday 7 a.m. to 6 p.m.

From an initial glance just driving by, the spot might not look like much -- but then I suppose what coffee shops do? A closer inspection reveals a wholesome little abode with a quaint little patio containing oddly awesome tables, and a sticker on the door proudly proclaiming its fair trade coffee usage.

The coffee house is populated with various art pieces, comfortable chairs (especially important for long study sessions), a couch and a bookcase full of reading material.

An initial glance at the menu left me in quite a conundrum -- did I want the Nutella or crème brulee latte? A tropical frappe or peach iced tea? The ""Candy Cane"" holiday espresso looked great too. With all these decisions, I decided to ask the barista, and ended up with the Nutella latte, iced, and also decided to give the ""Alien Burrito"" a try.

The Nutella latte was absolute deliciousness -- a blend of indulgent decadence,  perfectly balanced with the espresso. My only regret was not getting a larger size. Fortunately, while Sunrise strives for wholesome, organic food and coffee, their prices are still very reasonable, with a large 20 ounce gourmet latte only running $4.45, and the same size frappes only going for $4.85. Why do I ever go to Starbucks?

Next up was the ""Alien Burrito"" (full title: ""Aliens Left a Burrito in the Middle East""),  made up of couscous, beans, cheese, hummus, spinach, tomato, avocado, red bell pepper, cilantro and ranch, all housed within a spinach tortilla. Most know me as a bit of a carnivore, but despite a lack of meat, this burrito was delicious. And if you look at the ingredients, you can see why. The best part? It runs about the same price as a burrito at Chipotle or a sandwich at Subway.

I don't know why I ever had the whole ""Oh, organic? It'll probably be overpriced"" misconception, but Sunrise Coffee has quickly changed that. And it's not just because of their prices, but the atmosphere, the excellent coffee and food as well.

I was so embarrassed but the barista came out so quickly to make sure I was ok, he cleaned up my mess and even got me another drink. The whole process took less than 5 minutes. He was so nice about it and efficient. I just want to thank them for being so kind and on top of it.

Not a huge coffee drinker, but their Mexican Mocha is probably the best drink on the menu...however I am a bit of a London Fog lush.  The Nom Nom Burrito and the Alien Burrito are the highlights of the food menu.  As noted in other reviews this place sells only vegan/vegetarian food items from what I've seen.  However, if you're an omnivore like me, you can definitely get stuffed and get your grub on pretty easy here.

The place is constantly updating it's furniture, art work, music list (which is actually quite eclectic for a place that has a total hipster vibe to it).  Their sweets also seem to be changing constantly.  Which can be a bummer.  I used to love snacking on their banana walnut muffins...which they used to make all the time.  Now I haven't seen those in like a year and I hardly get any of their sweets anymore.

The staff for the most part are fairly approachable and friendly.  Some actually make an attempt to remember my name (which goes a long way for me!) and will start up a conversation with me.  You can tell a lot of them at least give off the vibe they really like working there...quite a few have been there for years.

Negatives:  The consistency on the food can be off.  It's amazing how I can get a pretty tasty Nom Nom Burrito one day and a very bland one another day.  Same thing with the drinks, though drink issues I would say are at a much lower occurrence.

It shouldn't be a horrible reflection on this place.  They represent Vegas well for a city that is not known for it's coffee/cafe scene.  But consistency issues have stopped me from being a weekly customer.",P9CsaNB6IkQyVeJXh21q7w,0,0,4,0JtcKHgpsjZHHkJIdqtXNg

For example today they told us that happy hour doesn't apply to drive through orders. Today is the first time I've heard that. I've been here many times before and ordered happy hour drinks through the drive through and never been told this. When we told the girl that helped us today this, she said that we were probably helped by people that didn't know that policy. Well it wasn't one or two occasions. It's been at least 30 occasions that I've gone through the drive through for happy hour and never been told this. Also, the girl that helped us today wasn't to happy. Maybe she was annoyed that we asked a lot of questions. 

 On one occasion the person helping me told me that lattes were not part of happy hour. 

Also, you have to order a ""latte with vanilla"" instead of a ""vanilla latte"" to get a happy hour vanilla latte. Is it just me or isn't that sort of ridiculous? 

Additionally the person helping us is different every single time. I think I've only seen the same person twice. 

Sunrise coffee is almost a 20 minute drive from me, which I'm happy to make but not if service like this continues. I've been visiting less frequently in the last few months and I stopped recommending it to people because I'm not sure what kind of service they'll turn out for friends and family I send, especially since most people I know are coffee aficionados.",g_4xMnDJrAAMzWT8TfYmWw,1,0,2,zAuwPT8rN9R31H3ialzGvA

This little piece of heaven is not only locally owned but its an all organic coffeehouse! That in and of itself is reason enough to check it out..but its soo much more!

However, once they got popularity as a kind of ""hip"" coffee place, their music became always loud, which not only bothered me to get my work done but also made me (and other customers) to raise voice to have a conversation. As a consequence, the noise level is pretty high. I don't want night-club atmosphere at a coffee shop, nor do I want to yell at my friends to have a conversation or use ear plugs.

1520928,2016-09-29,8,UMqfeCItzQ2glr4d9apGlA,"It's been over 5 years since my last review and fate would find me down in this neck of the woods today.  I was in need of rocket fuel to help propel me back up to NW side of town, so I stopped by.

When I used to work on this side of town, Sunrise was often visited.  The owners, staff, food, and coffee were TOP SHELF....PERIOD.  Who the hell would want to visit a corporate....and I hate saying it......""coffee shop,"" when you are within a quick drive to this Las Vegas GEM?

I pulled into the drive-thru, and noticed the vehicle in front of me was waved to the window.  I skipped the inoperable squawk box and waited for lead to retrieve their order and punch out.  I reflected on previous experiences and smiled.  When I pulled up, I was met with smiles and ordered up a coup of iced, double dirty chai from a friendly gent.

When the window opened again...I was handed my beverage, by another smiling and friendly gent.  I immediately smelt the strong oder of espresso emanating from my drink.  My olfactory senses were confused.  This never happens at the ""other"" place.  I am a consumer slave and sap for convenance.  There is NO Sunrise Coffee on the other side of valley.  The multiple, multiple dirties I have consumed from ""you know who,"" don't illicit this type of physical response.  Sunrise.....How I have missed you!

With purchase in hand, I pulled forward longing for that first sip.  When it happened...I marveled at the precision and craftsmanship of my muddy chai.  Not the ""Sloppy Joe"" of flavors from ""place with the mermaid as it's logo,"" but crisp, clean, and surgical.  The sort of CRISP, CLEAN, and SURGICAL flavor one would get off of sucking on the bosom of glacier... after tasting tap water your whole life.

The buzz from these two shots cannot be equaled by four ""big business"" shots.  Those shots are the same kind one would get after drinking 6 cups of Folgers.  It's a mechanical and industrial sort of feeling.  The Sunrise espresso high is different.  It's colorful.  It's warm and earthy.  I was in a happy and productive state for at least two hours.

Thank you Sunrise Coffee!  Five years and still solid.  A solid FIVE stars, and perhaps my most favorite coffee shop in Vegas or elsewhere.",HJj82f-csBI7jjgenwqhvw,12,8,5,rQdamHz7i_r3JzhD9gfw6g

First visit, I came through the drive thru. I ordered drinks and 2 breakfast sandwiches. I was told the sandwiches would take 10 mins. I was willing to wait since it was first time trying the place. I pulled the car up in front of the store to wait. After 20 minutes no sandwiches and iced drinks melting. I make my way to the door and the employee walks out and says I couldn't find you. I was 1 of 4 cars in the parking lot! How the hell couldn't she find me!? My coffee sucked by the time I got home and sandwiches were ok. 

Wanting to give them a second chance to redeem themselves, I decided to give them a chance this morning.

Now for today...in the drive thru again. I order the same thing. This time, my sandwich quote time is 15 minutes. I ask for the coffee to be made after the sandwiches so they wouldn't melt. Guess what the drive thru girl said?! ""NO, I am running a cue here."" I respond with, ""So you would rather me wait with my drinks melting as opposed to giving me my whole order fresh?"" She responds, ""That is how we do it, I have to."" I think it's needless to say I drove through the drive thru without making a purchase. 

So moral of the story...NEVER VISIT THIS ESTABLISHMENT UNLESS YOU WANT TO WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY!!! I HAVE NEVER RECEIVED THIS POOR OF SERVICE AND LACK OF CARE FOR A CUSTOMER'S REQUEST. ANY PLACE THAT WOULD RATHER GIVE UP YOUR BUSINESS THAN ACCOMMODATE YOUR SIMPLE REQUESTS DOES NOT DESERVE YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY!

The coffee/espresso drinks: so far in my past visits, I've had their drip coffee, orange mocha latte over ice and a creme brûlée latte. All the drinks i've tried are superb! Especially the orang mocha latte. If you are familiar with the orange flavored chocolate slices they have during Christmas time, the one wrapped in a blue foil, this latte taste EXACTLY the same---DELICIOUS. What's pretty cool too, is that they have a hemp milk substitute~~~ 

The food: two words---- Alien. Burrito. BEST VEGAN WRAP EVER. I always add mine with tofurkey, and spice it up with sirracha. It has couscous, hummus, bell peppers and spinach. Good food that is GOOD for YOU.

They roast their coffee and espresso in house; sometimes when you go in you can smell the coffee being roasted and it adds even more to the experience. I know they're using freshly roasted espresso which comes through in their drink quality. I typically get a macchiato or black coffee because their beans are the strength of their drinks and I can't get it any where else keep this .  
         In Vegas there is a debate, samba latte or sunrise?  The espresso and drip coffee quality at sunrise is no doubt superior.

Quite frankly, I don't care about the fair trade, all vegan stuff but I do like the expansive and varied collection of books they keep around.

The only real gripe I have is that they only have two people working during peak time handling both the inside service and the drive through so it takes a while to get your order taken and then to get your  order made.  Not a bad thing when you plan to hang out there, but it is annoying when you're on your way somewhere.

I ordered the creme brulee almond milk latte.  What I was expecting was a vanilla flavored latte with a bruleed froth top.  What I received was a latte with raw sugar generously sprinkled over the froth.  This was fine for me since I like my lattes this way.  Crunching raw sugar in between sips of coffee is a satisfying feeling. Still, I can't help but wonder how amazing the drink would have been with blowtorched sugar crystals. The boyfriend ordered a cold brew.  It was strong, smooth and refreshing on that hot September day.  In addition to our drinks, I picked out a lemon strawberry muffin.  The flavor combination sounded intriguing.  The muffin wasn't as moist as expected, but still a pleasing texture.  (I personally prefer a drier pastry with my coffee)  It was a good size, perfect for splitting, and wasn't overly sweet.  The muffin itself was lemon flavored and had strawberry jam swirled inside.

And with the lack of cold and wet comes a lack of inviting public (indoor) spaces to sit and talk, sit and read, or sit and work--otherwise known as the local coffee shop.  Which is the part of the reason that I am such a huge cheerleader for Sunrise Coffee and tell everyone that they should drive to Sunrise no matter what side of town they live on.  

Sunrise is one of the only independent coffee shops in Vegas.  And they've done a great job making a caffeinated space to inspire creativity, wakefulness, conversation, and community.  It's a space that's rare in Vegas.  But it's also an inviting space with the options of comfy chairs, tables, outlets to plug in a laptop, and at least one larger table for a group meeting.

Beyond the space, Sunrise offers great coffee (organic, fair trade, and well-roasted), delicious steamed milk coffee drinks (one of the few places in town offering a cafe au lait and Mexican hot chocolate).  And if you want a healthier breakfast option or vegan food options, they've got you covered.  

Bottom line: I'm in love with Sunrise.  It's proof that we can have the sun and outdoors of the desert and not give up the cozy nooks and tasty warm drinks of the colder cities.",wOSHvuJEJflUEesNLno51A,12,9,5,PwgcciI8r1MDtCcox-HT7A

The interior has nice wood tones, plenty of seating and large windows, although it can feel a bit cramped when it's a packed house. But the outside patio is large and has lots of seating too, which is especially nice when the weather permits. The coffee is good and varies day to day, but it's a bit weird that they don't have a dark roast. The employees are all very nice and the vibe is very hipster, but not in what can be an exclusionary way. They always greet customers when they walk in. They also keep the shop VERY clean, always wiping down the tables and perpetually mopping and sweeping the floor. The pastries and baked goods are very good and varied; I haven't had any of their wraps so I can't comment on those. 

The only drawbacks, if there are any, is that the shop is relatively small and can be very loud when it's bustling. Also, the employees usually have to yell over the crowd when their drinks are ready, so that can be quite loud as well.

First of all, I love that they are strong supporters/advocates of fair trade. Second of all, I'm not sure if it's always like this but when I first stepped in, it was DEAD QUIET. Luckily, I loved it since I had some studying to do! A great place to chat but a even greater place to get work done! The ambience is intimate with a hint of hipster. (: 

I ordered the creme brulee latte with stevia, almond milk, and sugar-free syrups. DELICIOUS! It tasted like a good ol' creme brulee latte with a deeper taste of almond milk (my fave). As I sat to get work done, I later got hungry & thirstier and ordered the vegan alien burrito with the veganaise (vegan mayonnaise) on the side. It was perfect: fresh, clean, AVOCADO-EY, crispy, delicious! The iced peach tea I got was also a great way to cool off in the suffocatingly horrible Vegas weather!

I also had to try out the Hakuna Tea Latte, since I have seen a few reviews on how amazing it was. I substituted for Almond Milk and it was to die for. I was close to getting another one! It was that addicting!

It was quite busy during the time we went but not too busy to the point where we had to wait for a table to be cleared.

Areas of opportunity. The service is a bit lacking. After the person in front of me was helped, it was at least one minute before anyone acknowledged that I was standing there. It's understandable if additional tasks need to be done before taking my order, but say to your customer, ""I'll be with you in just a moment."" By not doing so, the customer feels awkward and you miss an opportunity to show you want their business. 

No one introduced themselves. As a result, there was another missed opportunity to make a connection. A simple, ""Welcome to Sunrise Coffee. My name's ________, and you are?"" can go a long way toward making a loyal customer. 

There was no conversation made. This is another missed an opportunity to build rapport with your customer. As a result, there was no relationship started. Try, ""How's your morning going so far?"" or ""Is this your first time here?""

I'm kind of a tea snob, and it's the first thing I like to look at when going to new coffee/tea places. I was happy to see that they served loose leaf tea. I like to 'test' places when they serve loose leaf tea, by ordering one of their selections of green tea or white tea. They have my favorite tea, Genmaicha [green tea with toasted rice], so I ordered that. When I received it, I was happy to find that they had not burnt it or over steeped it. Yay. The only thing that bothered me was their black tea. It simply states 'black tea.' That's definitely one of my biggest pet peeves in any establishment. I want to know what type of tea I'm drinking, not simply if it's black,green, white, etc.

I also ordered their breakfast burrito. They way they described it to me sounded super delicious. Eggs,beans,tomatoes,spinach,potatoes, and probably a couple other items that are escaping my mind right now. It was an alright burrito. It was pretty big which was nice. The thing I didn't like about it was that none of the ingredients were really incorporated with one another. As I said, the burrito was pretty big - so every time I went to take a bite of it it was either just all potato, or all spinach, or all beans. There was also very little egg in the burrito, which was disappointing because when I think of breakfast burritos, I picture the main thing in it as egg.

I haven't tried any of their coffee drinks, but my friend did and loved their latte with french vanilla and hazelnut in it. I probably wouldn't make the 20 minute drive to that side of town just to go to this place. But, it's definitely somewhere I'll return to when I am in the area.

The herbal teas here are excellent.  Great selection and their brewing techniques are meticulous.  They do sell the loose leaf tea for take home as well.   Unfortunately, I haven't been able to replicate the results at home but I'm also too cheap to get good water.  I tried a latte once as well, and it was pretty good.  Very smooth and not bitter.

I did want to try the food before writing a review.  I got to try the elf bread with whipped honey at a Yelp event and that was very good.  It's supposed to give you all the nutritional requirements of a full meal.  Recently, I got a breakfast burrito to start my day.  Unfortunately, I got overwhelmed at work, couldn't eat it until 1 hour later, and can't really chew anyway right now (long story).  But the egg, beans, potato, and salsa I picked out with my fork was still pretty good, even cold.

Food, atmosphere and people are all vegan-friendly, but not in that judgemental, over-bearing way. They're just happy. The music is happy. The tip jar is happy, and unsurprisingly overflowing. 

Food is good (3.5 stars) but the atmosphere is overpowering positive. I'm 5 stars even before I took a sip or a bite.",WRiS2BiHblDHN-9SQlR_BA,1,1,5,Mm2QhbIF5vmyL1vsdtBiQQ

They have a jug of water set out and glasses next to it, somewhat of a rare find in coffee shops.  I bought coffee beans from them and that coffee was really good as well.

Sunrise is a local coffee house that excels at customer service while offering a nice selection of quality options.

They are probably best known for their Mothership Roasters Coffee, but they also have several good loose leaf teas that are sure to please. I also look forward to enjoying one of their tasty wraps. The Alien (Left a Burrito in the Midwest) is my go-to option.  It's a vegetarian option that leaves me satisfied and never missing meat. The Alien consists of a tortilla wrap with couscous, beans, cheese, hummus, spinach, tomato, avocado, and red bell pepper. If I'm not eating eating the Alien I am probably enjoying the similar Nomnom Breakfast Burrito featuring a tortilla, eggs, vegetarian beans, potatoes, cheese, fresh spinach, tomatoes, avocados, sour cream and a bit of cream cheese. Other items are also great, but I keep returning for the Alien.

Sunrise Coffee is on the opposite side of town for me, so to make the trip was questionable since I haven't been to this side of town for awhile. 

After reading many great reviews and a friend recommending this place, I thought since I have the day off, why not explore. Great find! 

I had the tofurkey sandwich and a matcha tea. The sandwich was good, and full! Avocado, nice thick slices of tomato, nice handful of spinach. I'm not a fan of siriacha in sandwiches, but instead cooked into a dish. Surprisingly I loved it as a sauce for the sandwich. 
The tea was good, with no additional sugars. Just iced was perfect for a hot summer day in Las Vegas. 

Everyone here is productive and not the typical gossip team behind the counter. When there were no orders, they were either cleaning up or checking up on customers. 

It has a very hipster vibe from the customers themselves. But still a great place to dine in or eat out. 

I'll come back when I'm in the area or have friends visiting. 

Specify if you want vegan, vegetarian or gluten free. Most of the items are vegetarian, just request vegan if you are. There are vegan dessert options too...none stood out to me, so I decided to opt out the sweets for now.

Arrived around 5:10pm on a Thursday evening. 5-8pm is happy hour. $1 small hot/iced coffee, $2 hot/iced latte, and $1 pastries.  UMM WHAT?! Seriously!? Happy hour coffee version!? Yes please. This is better than freakin alcoholic beverages for happy hour. Sorry....but I much rather choose iced coffees over alcohol ANY DAY. ANY FREAKIN DAY.

This place have a bunch of syrups to add to your coffee/beverage. They got your usual vanilla, chocolate, hazelnut, caramel, sugar free. And then you got your orange, coconut, almond, marshmallow, peppermint, raspberry, strawberry...etc. It's an extra 45 cents to add flavoring. I probably sound like such a newbie for getting all excited over the wide varieties of syrups they have. Are all private coffee joints like this?? Sorry...I was so used to just Starbucks before moving here to Vegas lol.

So I got a small iced coconut latte with nonfat milk. Total cost: $2.45. Can't freakin beat that. $2 for an iced coffee at a coffee joint?!?!? That's heaven for me. My boyfriend got a 16oz iced mocha frap. That cost $4 with some change. Too bad this place is pretty far from where I live otherwise I'd be here wayyyyyyy moreeee often.

From its hand-lettered signs and its pretty cappuccino designs to it's quirky local art for sale and hand-doodled paper cups on display, Sunrise is a needle Starbucks-soaked haystack of corporatism.  It is sure to be appreciated by the more-than-average coffee lover, tattoos and all.  Free wifi, discount pastries in the afternoon, a variety of seating options make self-proclaimed snobs like me feel right at home.

Great background music, which isn't too loud if you're trying to get some work done.  Art on the walls, table by restroom supporting local events and businesses.  

Even an antique-looking gong by the door if you need some om in your day.

My favorite thing is the specialized lemonades they have, however they only have these during summers. But they also have speciality drinks every time I go in, that I get in every time!

They have a cute outdoors patio that is cute for pictures. As well as inside is also super cute, and a perfect place to just come sit and do Any work. 

They open up at 6am which is perfect for me, since I work at 7am and it's the only coffee shop open that early in the morning besides from Starbucks!",5qBTq4XLs-3ch4AxRXXNmg,0,0,5,oAT-osuVRGojOZ4SZKzxsg

Pastrys: The peanut butter cookie is like no other. One day they offered to serve it warm. I thought...oh ok thats nice of them. But then it arrived with a small amount of peanut butter spread on top. WOW is all I can say. I didn't want to leave, and it took all of my will power not to order another, then another, then another :) . It doesnt stop there, I just tried the Sunrise Muffin. Its like a bran muffin with cranberries and raisins. Again unbelievable. 

Beverages: Besides the fact that its all organic, its just plain delicious. I had the organic tea recently and I must admit it was quite refreshing. This is my new Sunrise Coffee summer drink. In the winter its as simple as cashiers chose. I walk in say "" what do you recommend today"" and they deliver absolute perfection in a glass. Sunrise stands up to the big boys coffee club all on its on. 

Service: Everyone here seems to be in a good mood. Not a hello i'm forced to smile at you because its my job kind of mood, but genuinely happy. I think they actually enjoy working here...Weird i know.  They are knowledgeable and will explain all the ins and outs of whatever you order.

2861028,2015-06-05,1,UMqfeCItzQ2glr4d9apGlA,"A few friends and I decided to head here to grab a coffee, maybe some food, and talk for a bit because they love this joint. So, being a lover of trying new spots, I agreed!

The location has a fairly decent amount of parking in front and around the building, which is great for when you want to meet people for a coffee. 

Walking into the building it's what I expected a coffee shop to look like. Dark rich walls, lots of different sized tables to accommodate 2 people and a few for larger parties or studying and a lounge-y area near the front for more comfortable group seating. There is also a small patio to the side which is where we sat. Provides more room for bigger parties and extra seating for days when it's a bit packed (such as today). What I love about the patio is that it's somewhat covered with a vine like wall on one side shielding some sunlight, but also let's in small patches through the vine and the sides. It's pretty open which makes the place seem bigger than it may appear I be outside. 

As for the service, the lady at the counter was very welcoming and provided great suggestions for types of drinks, and the food they serve. (They do have Vegan options and their menu seems pretty healthy without lacking flavor which I enjoy). I had even started with ordering a latte first (in which there are a BUNCH of flavors) and then went back to order food after seeing other tables around us with good food and bakery items in front of them. 

A plus in which most people come for is the latte art that they do on top of their hot lattes and sometimes on other hot drinks as well. Each latte art is different so expect a something unique each time :) mine happened to be a cute kitty face, while my friend's was a sweet dinosaur looking thing (once again...it was unique. It could've been a snail. I don't know LOL)  while earlier another friend got a flower. 

Overall, good atmosphere, friendly service, and the lattes, bakery items, and cafe foods are delicious. I recommend coming in and trying a couple things with friends!",sGIGOFKg_yTd76cDPs6pjA,1,2,5,9Ww0p2DmnQVQDwfq4-Si6Q

Then I walked in, and saw all of the UNLV students sitting at coffee tables taking care of projects/ homework. It is definitely a place for students to study, since a cup of espresso goes with any book! 

I ordered the creme brûlée medium coffee, which to my surprise, they upgraded it to large for free since they didn't have any medium cups at the time. My husband ordered a French vanilla coffee. We both enjoyed the coffee due to the fact it wasn't Starbucks. Then we sat and had the NOM NOM burritto, and for it being a vegan burrito wasn't bad at all!

They have a variety of coffees and many delicious coffee creation.  My first love has always been the Mexican mocha and Nutella !  If your not in the mood for a sweet drink the French press and standard drip are great!  If Mike is there he will give you the run down on what he has been roasting.  Not to mention he is a genuinely nice guy who cares about what he is doing and the coffee he is roasting. 

But for me what pushes Sunrise to a perfect 5 are the barista!  If you are a morning person you will get to interact with Amanda and Becky.   Two ladies who are always willing to shoot you a smile, talk with you about your day and suggest some great drinks (Amanda introduced me to the green tea latte). 

If you are there at night (like me) you get to hang with Mae, Jet and Michelle!  Whether you are; exchanging witty banter with Jet while chatting about life, putting your faith in Mae with her many creations accompanied by talks about the adventures of the day or having Michelle convince you to try a matcha shot with a chaser or good conversation, you will always feel welcomed when coming in the door.

Sunrise Coffee is truly one of those constantly great spots. The food is always on point, the coffee isn't bitter, and it's a great place to get some work done. There can sometimes be a line, but it moves fast. 

My most recent visit to Sunrise included an Alien Burrito. This coffeehouse favorites' full name is, ""ALIENS LEFT A BURRITO IN THE MIDDLE EAST"" according to their website. Not only is that a mouthful, but also is a delicious vegetarian delight. Which is filled with couscous, beans, cheese, hummus, spinach, tomato, avocado, red bell pepper, ranch, and wrapped up in a tomato tortilla. Out-of-this-world good., too much? 

I've tried a few other things here like; the Multigrain Egg Which, the Breakfast Croissant sandwich, and the PBJ Nutella concoction which is orgasmic. There are all fantastic! Like I said, this place is constantly good and always puts a food fueled smile on my face. 

This being a coffee based spot, of course I've tried their caffeinated beverages and they are beyond the normal range of coffee perfection. My go to is still the Iced Americano, but I like no frills or sugar in my coffee. K.I.S.S baby! 

PRO TIP: In a rush? Avoid the beanie-wearing hipsters, who are on a cliché filled road to hell, and hit up the drive-thru.",i_DR3vdE73nVm2GlMbGpGA,8,7,5,WuHJtpz1zS8MXpyYt_2XeQ

1. The employees are friendly and welcoming, and very fast and efficient. They love their job and it shows in the consistent high quality of service.

2. The food is absolutely delicious! I highly recommend trying the Alien Burrito (Vegan option is the best!), which is truly out of this world! ;) 

3. Best coffee in town, hands down. Starbucks should learn from these guys! 

4. To make things even better, they offer delectable vegan and healthy options on most of their menu items. 

5. Best chocolate chip cookies you will ever eat. Period.

The lights outside weren't on yet because it wasn't dark when I left but my friend and I made a mental note to come back after dark next time. 

I saw some people studying, some writing papers and others just hanging out enjoying some coffee. 

Their menu offers a wide variety of items but what stood out to me was the truffleberry, Nutella and creme brulee. I asked the guy at the register what was in the truffleberry and he said chocolate and berries (might have been raspberries). My friend and I decided to go with hot Nutella latte and a creme brulee latte. A medium and a large came out to be around $9, which isn't bad considering Starbucks prices have gone up within the past year.

We got our drinks within 5 minutes, maybe less. I like my drinks on the stronger side and forgot to tell them less sugar... It was very sweet. Still drinkable but sweet. I also didn't get a hazelnutty taste. I had my friend try it and she couldn't put her finger on the taste either. It wasn't bad, but it didn't blow me away. My friend enjoyed her creme brulee, saying it had a burnt sugar aftertaste. I tried it and it was ok. I think next time if I order a latte I'll ask for less sugar or stick to their classics or pour over coffee.

There's a big variety of drinks on their menu, including some of their specialty drinks. Keep in mind they also have a small sign near the register that shows their other ""seasonal"" drinks.

The little details, like the latte art on each cappuccino, are much appreciated. They also have special deals, usually in the form of free drinks, found on their Yelp page.

I visited for the first time this morning. I had heard a great deal about your shop and your coffee roasting establishment. When I entered the store it was clean and every looked and smelled amazing. I talked to a staff member and discussed how I thought they would have something with egg as a meal item. I was informed by associate that a couple blocks down was the roaster and they were open with a great deal of items.

I jumped in my car and drove the 5-7 minutes down the block. As I was looking for the store I was having an issue finding it. I called talked to an employee who told me where it was. I told them great I would be there in seconds. They responded great!

Moments later I arrived. The store was locked up and closed. I was shocked considering two employees never mentioned they open in over an Hour from the time we talked. As I walked back to my car I saw what I thought was a customer pull up. I mentioned that they where closed thinking they also where given mis information. The individual states he was the manager. I informed Him what happened and he seemed as if he did not care. I jumped in my car drove back to the first location. I ran into the same employee and again no apologies just a shrug. 

The food and coffee where amazing however the customer service was terrible. It took what should have been 5 minutes more like 30-40. I felt it was important to give you a heads up since you make incredible coffee and bake goods I would hate to have poor customer service ruin your name / business.

I've always heard amazing things about this place. I've also seen tantalizing pictures of beautiful coffee creations. I was really excited that I had some time to stop by and see what the commotion was about.

I was starving and decided to get a wrap. My friends advised me to get the Alien Burrito. It's a perfect blend of beans, lettuce, tomato, quinoa and red bell peppers in a tomato-tortilla wrap.  I'm not sure what they used to flavor the quinoa and the beans, but it's absolutely delicious. They don't skimp out on the size of the wrap either. I ate half before my workout and the other half post-workout. The most perfect vegetarian wrap I've ever had!

I didn't get to try any their coffee drinks, but my friend just had just ordered a cup. It's really a work of art. The designs they get on their creations are really pretty. So pretty in fact that I wouldn't want to drink it! But I ended up getting their Italian soda flavored with raspberry and passion fruit. This was only $2. Light and refreshing. Not too sweet. Perfect compliment to my Alien burrito. 

Ambiance is great. A quaint and little shop with good seating. They even have a little bookshelf full of books. Not noisy like your typical coffee shop - you can actually hear what people are saying to you! There were a handful of people studying here as well. I wish I had known about this place during my undergrad days. I wouldn't have been studying there too!

While I was standing in line, I saw that there was a little sign. Something about how they have Happy Hour from 5-8 PM which their small coffee is $1. Win! Whether I get their $1 coffee or pretty latte in the near future, I know I'll be happily sipping with a smile on my face.",1EvZSNmhYmyPIElblCeMdA,1,1,5,N2y2FZ5hvSqvU0V74Jj_bQ

2. The food and drink, I got the breakfast burrito- Vegan style. It was delicious and really filling with a lot of fresh tasting ingredients. The avocado was green, the lettuce was crunchy. I know that sounds silly but I hate consuming food that tastes like it has been there a while. Coffee was delicious, and tasted very strong and very fresh.

Place is very easy to find and there is plenty of parking to go around.  We made our way inside and it had the typical coffee house feel.  A little worn down, (tile was becoming discolored, plate that our food was served on was chipped) but all in all it was clean.

The seating inside is a little to cramped for my taste. Outside had more room, but if was very cold on this days adventure so we sat inside at the high bar.

The menu overhead does not list the wraps / food they offer,  just the drinks.  That menu is in paper form found by the register.  We went with two vanilla latte's, the Alien and Nom Nom wraps.

The coffee was very good and exactly what I was looking for.  The wraps were both average, and nothing out of this world. 

All in all this is an above average coffee shop. Some minor tweaks, IE updating the interior and plate wear, while spacing out the seating would definitely up the rating.

Although I could not see my self dinning in again, I will defiantly swing through the drive through for a nice cup of java. Three and half stars would be my rating, but I will round up to four as a result of the nice cup of java and friendly staff.",-zq5x_Dxub8k0YOWvqn2Rg,3,2,4,9dZF7nfXy8RBwais_dVu6w

The Guatemalan bean was $3.95 and the Ethiopian was $4.95. My buddy got the Guatemalan and I selected the Ethiopian. I shared we were from out of town and first time visitors so I was able to convince the friendly barista to just charge me $3.95 and he agreed. Good guy!

Well, it was the right choice because the notes of the coffee was really enjoyable and light, very nutty and fruity. I would definitely order this again if I were ever to return which I probably would go out of my way to come here for good coffee whenever I'm in town again.

These guys had a five star review the moment I walked in! Local artist's canvases hanging all over, beautiful interior (I think it was an old Starbucks) and a bookshelf full of everything. After 5  years, I picked up a Terry Pratchett and started leafing through it. The laid back vibe and the friendly surroundings make it so unique in a city like Las Vegas.  The decor is modern and every couch/table set was different...I spotted a couple of Ikea pieces (I'm an Ikea junkie like that) and there were some accent chairs...everything looked so cosy and comfortable and most importantly LOCALLY UNIQUE.

I ordered a small hazelnut latte...yummilicious...I didn't have to add anything to it...the waitress hand-delivered it to me. To eat, I ordered a breakfast croissant sandwich sans egg. It came with spinach leaves, avocado, cream cheese, slice of what seemed like provolone and tomatoes. Just the right, clean food for a good start to the day. It was delicious (never thought that such simple food would give me so much joy). The coffee and tea menu here is extensive and everything seems so well-thought of. They have a few burritos/sandwiches (all of which could be customized). I think I may hang here everyday. 

The staff was hilarious...they whipped up my drink and food, served it to me at my table and they were so sweet. While I was eating, I heard their conversation behind the counter.

Honestly, they could have served me a dog biscuit and I would have still been in love with the place just because it's such a local gem. I wish they were open late...imagine having poetry nights, guitar players, wannabe Justin Biebers all getting their act on here.

This is now our go to place when we're in Vegas! We've had a few things from this menu;

Alien burrito: Beans, hummus, cous cous, tomato, cheese, spinach bell peppers on a spinach tortilla. The flavor was good, though the balance was of ingredients was off..i;e there was an overload of spinach and not much else but that definitely depends on who's making the food. 

Nom No,m burrito; I wasn't wowed by it. The flavor was lacking...I'd definitely give it 3 out of 5 alone. The idea is great but it just needs more seasoning. 

This morning I had an everything bagel with vegan cream cheese.. I really love the fact that they have uncommon vegan breakfast options cream cheese. Their conscious effort alone gets them points in my book. 

Fiancee had a tofurky sandwich on an everything bagel loaded with all kinds of goodies like vegan cheese and cream cheese, tofurky,,tomato, spinach and avocado. She really enjoyed it...it was loaded and had great flavor. 

I can't say much about their lattes and hot coffee but I must say the ice coffee and frapps had good flavor but were inconsistent over the course of the weekend.

Overall I really love this place for the cute seating, chill ambiance and awesome friendly staff but I just think they need to step up the flavor game as well as making their food/drink taste more consistent.",fUB80jEl7hUP4vVmKMCkmg,0,0,4,kOQVvTnk81-UUoAuZsVToA

The girl who helped me was friendly and knowledgeable when it came to the drinks I had questions about. I have tried both hot and iced coffees and they were tasty. One drink I recommend is the Orange Mocha it was very good and a drink I'd totally get again. When it came to the White Chocolate Mocha I thought it was good, but not great. I don't live near this location, far from it actually, but when in the area I'll be utilizing the drive-thru for more of that tasty orange mocha and they have other flavors I'd like to try.

3520768,2016-08-07,0,UMqfeCItzQ2glr4d9apGlA,"Feeling grumpy after losing too much money in Vegas? I think a cup of Nutella Latte at Sunrise Coffee will lighten up your mood.

Sunrise Coffee is located approximately 6~7 miles away from the Strip and the overall atmosphere is pretty hip with some trendy & smoothing background music (personally this is a great place to study). To my amazement, Sunrise Coffee actually has a drive thru! That gotta be the 1st non-franchised & family owned coffee shop drive thru I've visited.

Outlets are limited here (so pick your table wisely) & there's free self serving iced water. You will find many vegan & gluten free breakfast options. Once your are done with your drink & food, you can return both cups and plates at the pick up counter (you'll see a tray).

***

Alien Burrito (tomato basil tortilla with couscous, beans, cheese, hummus, spinach, tomato, avocado, red bell peppers and ranch dressing, $6.75): Not sure whether I actually like tomato tortilla (pretty rough texture). Pretty good for veggie burrito - I could taste both sour cream and avocado. The portion was fairly big too.

Nutella Latte (hot, small 12 oz $3.70): Oh wow ... sometimes it only takes that one sip to determine how great the coffee is and this latte belongs to THAT category. Oh such a glorious drink - aroma, sweet, and creaminess were in perfect balance. Normally you would think Nutella is really sweet - well not with this cup of latte!

Nope, the Vegan pastry options lured us in. 

We arrived rather late in the day, so it's understandable that many of their items were sold out. We got a muffin, which we ate the next day. It was pretty darn scrumptious. Moist, soft and just sweet enough. If it's that good ""day old"", I'm sure it is even better when eaten the same day.

We got a latte from the hipster baristas. They were all smiles, which should be the norm, yet sadly isn't always. They did put it in a paper cup even though we wanted to drink it inside. No big deal, yet I always prefer my drinks in ceramic if I'm not traveling with it. 

Despite several Yelp photos, latte art isn't their specialty, yet the latte came out smooth and balanced. The best coffee I had in Vegas, although that isn't saying much.

Maybe with all the desert heat, Vegas doesn't necessarily specialize in brewing coffee, yet here is Sunrise churning out java that's nearly as good as you'll find in the best coffee brewing locales, such as San Francisco Bay Area.

They have a lot of options to choose from, so I asked the barista what their bestsellers are for someone who likes sweet drinks. She recommended 3 Lattes: Nutella, Creme Brûlée, and Butterbeer. I chose Butterbeer.

Having a super sweet tooth, this wasn't too sweet for me.. and I wish I asked for an extra pump of sweetness or something. Caramel/butterscotch was good, Cinnamon was very pungent, which could be a pro or con.

I ended up ordering a small jasmine tea latte with almond milk and a croissant egg sandwich. My friend ordered the same drink with a vegan alien burrito.

The lattes we ordered weren't anything to rave about, but it may be because of the almond milk itself. When our food was brought out to us, the server was kind enough and the portions were very big. I guess the food is supposed to be cold, even for a breakfast croissant, but it was good. I like the fact that they use veganaise instead of regular mayo.

I've also tried the Nutella, Butter Beer, & Mexican Mocha. All tasty drinks and definitely worth a try. They offer all different milk types including Soy, which is free, and Almond Milk!
I haven't tried any of their food or snacks but they have a pretty decent selection and I see people eating in all the time so it must be good.

AMBIANCE: Great coffee shop feel without being Hipster dirty. Always busy with people reading, working, or socializing.

SERVICE: Genuine, friendly employees. All very personable and welcoming. It's awesome how some of them remember you even if you're not a local. If they ever make a mistake, they're really cool about it and will fix whatever they messed up on.

My drink of choice, iced mocha, is well-made, not too sweet, and generally consistently good. The staff is very friendly, service is good, and only occasionally does a vagrant wander in and ask if you're going to finish your muffin (ok, this did happen, but only once and I have been here scores of times, the mgmt handled the situation courteously). The cruelty-free menu has some delicious offerings, and the muffins are all especially good.

If I have reservations giving a 5-star rating, it is based on the following: the seating is not entirely comfortable, other than a corner couch, I think there isn't a cushion in the joint, and my old rear likes a cushion. In other words, the tables have hard chair seating and it doesn't promote a ""sit and relax"" atmosphere as much as a ""have a coffee while getting some work done"" atmo, which seems to be the bent of most of the crowd anyway.

My only other issue is that almost every time I've gone there has been someone smoking cigarettes on the patio, and when it's nice outside, inside the music (good music) is loud and the tables are full of computers and hipsters, sometimes you want to sit on the patio and breathe fresh air (as fresh as it can be being 50' from Sunset Road). A ""Please Do Not Smoke"" sign on the patio would be a welcome addition, since some people do not have a sense of courtesy in and of themselves.

As a side note, I really think it's time coffee joints quit charging for ""alternative milks"" - they are no more expensive than cow milk, in fact probably cheaper, and becoming commonplace for people to order, so cut it out already! An extra .60 on an already $5 cup of coffee is OVERKILL.

I highly recommend Sunrise as a place to grab a coffee, meet a friend or business associate, or just read or get a little work done. Just avoid the patio if occupied by an inconsiderate dragon.",p5a01lekVQY5jadQZN2xjA,0,0,4,qhxIutNftLc8KR_52Dap8A

I have thought about it for a while and decided that the only way to describe the Alien Burrito is YUM-MAZING. I had to make up a word to describe its tastiness. It is so good that I actually can't eat any more Alien Burritos for a while because I ate one every day for like 3 weeks and over dosed because that is the kind of YUM-addict I am. My inside fat kid never quits.

Let me explain how I love coffee: I drink coffee black. I think cream and sugar is for people who hate coffee. I won't drink Folgers unless it is an emergency. Like the kind of emergency where someone died. I am a coffee snob. So it BLEW MY MIND when I realized that Sunrise roasts their coffee beans in house. Are you kidding me, who does that? I'm in love. 

I don't drink lattes and other coffee drinks but I'm sure they are fantastic, too. It is difficult for me to imagine that anything at Sunrise is anything short of amazing. I'm sure they use real espresso machines and not those automated ones Starbucks switched over to. 

I'll admit I was a little bit freaked out that they had the iPads for ordering because that is so cool I'm probably too old to be in there. However, the service is super friendly and the hipster vibe is not uncomfortable.

I really think this is what Starbucks aspires to be and maybe what it was in its youth. You really owe it to yourself to check out Sunrise if you want to have a real coffee shop experience. I am also going to bring this up at the next vegetarian meeting because I think the Alien Burrito is the holy grail of vegetarian food.",mtpQBE8yTL8oTo0KrJcd9A,5,6,5,_2BNWH8AVtFdEctoeBhOdA

Their caramel vanilla iced latte is on point without being overwhelmingly sweet and their americanos are seriously to die for.   

A new favorite of mine to switch up the pace and in an attempt to lessen my daily coffee intake: I've taken to asking for their mint matcha green tea, iced and with enough milk to essentially make it a latte. The result? A light, creamy peppermint patty like concoction with just a hint of green tea. Nom! :3
 
As for the atmosphere and the aesthetics of the place? I can not rave of this place enough. 
Like a good cup of coffee (lol), the shop is saturated in consistent, cohesive and understated little details that don't necessarily slap you in your face upon first glance but are appreciated nonetheless when brought to light. 
Extension cords, outlets are a plenty and are strategically hidden under a couple of their banquet style study/dining tables, their community board is usually packed with interesting local clientele ads, events  and offerings, fresh flowers are hidden in a corner or two, there's a gorgeous whimsical Amy Sol (for Audrey Kawasaki lovers, she's definitely an artist to check out) painting,  and my favorite?: tip jars whose signs change every other week that's bound to plant an amused smirk or smile on your face. The varied music selection that's played is also a plus. Overall if you haven't already, make the trek down here. It's well worth the try.",tQRquQ0TRMzs8B_I4AxxmQ,1,1,5,XUy-9JjVWKEtlOFkVM97jQ
3987388,2015-02-11,0,UMqfeCItzQ2glr4d9apGlA,"Oh Sunrise, you are definitely the only place with a legit latte in LV in a legit atmosphere. If you could get your service act together like it seems you should, it would be an easy five stars every time.

I first visited here on a Vegas trip 2 years ago and couldn't imagine going anywhere else for much needed caffeine. Came back this weekend on three separate occasions (twice in one day in fact). Yep, it's good like that. 

Each time however, we had some sort of issue. 

Visit 1: Four drinks - 2 soy lattes, 2 vanilla soy lattes. For some reason, one of the soy lattes didn't show up. Informed staff, obtained drink. More or less easy enough. 

Visit 2: 1 soy latte, 2 soy vanilla lattes, 1 regular latte, 3 vegan burritos and some granola. One burrito shows up not vegan - informed and they made a new one but we were waiting while starving for quite some time. We are also given two soy lattes (that's what the girl told us they were - turns out they were the two vanilla soy lattes) which means that I ended up with the vanilla when I didn't want it but felt bad about having a drink thrown away so just drank it. Bro had to go obtain the other vanilla soy latte. 

Visit 3: you guessed it, the soy latte went missing again! I watched the guy enter in the order details into the ipad, so I honestly don't know what happened. What I thought was the easiest drink (and of course mine, so I was a little more sad) just didn't show up. 

Something in that process needs to be tweaked so all of the drinks are made. Other than that, everyone that works there has a stellar attitude. There's lots o milk choices (soy is gratis!!) and there's lots o vegetarian/vegan food options. I don't usually go out for coffee unless I'm away from home or it's an outing but if I lived anywhere in LV, I would definitely hit up Sunrise every.single.day because their prices don't break the bank either. 

So here's the breakdown: Local Roasters. Milk Options. Veg Food. Perfect Prices. Almost perfect service.

The drinks are delicious and a lot of thought went into them, especially ones like their S'mores milkshake (and yes, they can make that vegan). You can get classics like vanilla lattes or caramel fraps but there's a bunch of cool options on their menu like horchatas, tropical smoothies, or Nutella flavored beverages. My husband and I have been coming here for 3 years now. We've tried about half of their menu and there are so many good drinks that we're always ordering different favorites.

The food is super yummy and their food menu also breaks the traditional coffee shop mold. There are a ton of vegan and gluten free options. I'm a huge fan of the vegan versions of the Saucy Wench and Nom Nom Burritos. My husband likes the egg croissant sandwiches and the Morning Crumbles. The more run of the mill coffee shop treats like muffins are always moist and high quality. If you can get around to trying the vegan coffee cake, cinna rolls, or blueberry muffins I highly recommend it! They are the BEST if you ask them to warm it up for you. They also have vegan butter to go with it. 

We go there often enough to recognize the different baristas but since they don't wear name tags I've never known who to name to leave a compliment for. I finally got around to asking some of them what their name was (and hopefully didn't sound too creepy!) - Michelle and May are consistently friendly, sincere and helpful. The two of them and the manager who does their woodwork, provide some of the best customer service experiences this city has to offer. The three of them are all really great and super nice. They really do make the experience.

Definitely try this place if you have a chance, the atmosphere is way better than a Starbucks and there's a 99% chance your drink will taste better! (:",213KYzrMhngwpz0FleaP0A,2,1,5,3XPnVTJpzgLpoHyA6PJJrQ

I'll probably go back again and give it another try and hopefully, they live up to the hype that this place gets. 

I had found this location on Yelp when I was researching coffee shops in my area and this one was one I had bookmarked to try and I finally got around to trying it last weekend. There was plenty of parking, mostly in the back so I had no problem finding a spot to park. They have a small covered patio area with some tables for those that like to enjoy their coffee outdoors like I do. Inside is small with lots of tables and chairs, so it seemed really crowded with no much space to move about. 

Ordering was easy as the menu is straightforward. The lady took my order quickly and drinks came out fairly quickly as well. I ordered the 12 ounce Mocha and my guest got the 20 ounce Cold Brew. If you know me, you know that my go-to coffee drink is the Mocha, so I was really looking forward to my drink. However, it was SOOO sweet. They didn't bother to mix the syrup or anything, so when I first took a sip all I got was the syrup..yuck!! My guest's drink also wasn't anything special to talk about. He said it reminded him of Starbucks Cold Brew. He wasn't disappointed but was just looking for something that would make this place stand out compared to other places and it just didn't do it for us. 

We decided to have our drinks outside on the patio but had to wipe down our own table as no one had come out after customers had left and made sure that the tables were clean. There were several tables with old cups on them and napkins still laying around and trash on the ground. Not a great first impression! And we didn't even come late. It was still in the morning. 

On a positive note, the employees did seem nice. The girl that took our order was all smiles and did explain the menu to us and gave suggestions based off of what we liked. Will come back again and give it another try.",GWs9J6lIUqrySTxl6uXO0A,44,33,3,e8wdbnPgo6UxFm0UtfFXag

Seems like the go to spot for a cup of Joe, conversation with a friend, and a little place to sit and get some work done on the laptop (thats why im here). 

Upon first entry you can tell this is a a regular spot for quite a few people as many seem to have their little places picked out, with their laptop cords ran all over and the comfort of knowing the employees as casual conversation flows all around. I find a spot first at the comfy deep seat chairs in the middle of the room and order my cup of coffee with a little flavor (white chocolate) in it to try and replicate my usual order from CBTL... my mistake as i should have just stuck with what was on the menu as it was too sweet. My next order was my lunch as i have been sitting here for the last couple of hours and i have been staring at photos of the wraps on their website so i asked them to make me their favorite. I have no clue what it was but it had beans in it and was certainly tasty as well as very healthy and really hit the spot. The service from the entire staff has been a pleasure with smiles and a solid attitude that makes you feel welcome. I think my next order to finish out my day will be the Americano which based on reviews will be nothing short of fabulous.

It was my first time at Sunrise, and I wasn't sure what to make of it, but the person behind the counter definitely knew what I needed. They peppy and enthusiastic and before long I had my tea ((chamomile, peppermint, and one other thing I can't recall)), and it did just the trick!

First of all, it was delicious. Second, my anxiety melted away, to a point where I pulled out my sketchbook and doodled without worry. Third, it worked SO WELL that I was straight up falling asleep when my friend drove me home.

Expect another visit from me, soon. I need to know what was in that tea. Such magic.

I ordered a half soy/rice latte that came out better than I expected and I'll definitely come back for another one of those. It was refreshing to find another milk alternative beside the normal alternative which is usually soy.

The coffee itself was smooth and not bitter and my drink ended up being almost $4 which isn't that bad considering a Starbucks latte usually cost about the same.

I would have tried their green tea but everything green they had on the menu no longer existed so I opted for a latte. Whenever I'm back in town I'll be giving this little gem of a coffee joint another try.

An establishment can have the BEST food and drinks in the world, but if the service isn't up to par, then customers will either never get to experience the phenomenal food/drinks or never return and this is exactly what happened to us. My mother and I stopped in this coffee shop curious as to the options. I've been here before but when they very first opened, what seems like many years ago. Anyways, we haven't been so it felt like an entirely new experience with new drinks and foods etc. We approached the counter and asked a few questions. My mother asked if they carried any Organic dairy free milk? the guy answered that none were organic except for one the soy. My mom said oh man, okay let me think. He kept saying to get soy or dairy, but my mom can't have soy or dairy due to an allergy. She then said "" would it be okay if I tried the rice and almond before I pick?"" and the guy goes "" well whats the magic word?"" and my mom said ""what?"" and he said "" PLEASE! please is the magic word. you have to be nice if you want it, we normally don't do it."" First of all, my mom was EXTREMELY kind, just asked a questions and 2nd she's a 50 something year old woman not a child. Who does this guy think he is? This slender tattooed man had the nerve to be a smart ass ( excuse my french)  and condescending while dealing with an older and new customer. He goes to pour the rice milk and GUESS WHAT!? the RICE MILK IS ORGANIC! so my mom goes "" I thought you said only soy was organic thats organic too."" He looked at it and just goes "" Oh , i dont read the labels."" Really? you work at a food place and you don't read the food labels or know about that food? What a joke. 

we left the cup he gave us and walked out.

I can hardly call myself a coffee or tea connoisseur. I drink this stuff for the caffeine. Even if it tends to taste terrible (e.g. Starbucks coffee), I still down it like it I need it to live. If it happens to taste good, then props to the drink. My brain and taste buds both become happy.

 Upon walking in, I happened to notice signs indicating they sell products that are of free trade and organic.These aren't absolutely necessary qualities for me when looking for a beverage, but I appreciate that it's what I'm getting. It was a blistering hot day outside, so I went with a simple iced peach tea, unsweetened. It was very refreshing, with a light hint of that peach flavor. The medium size tends to run a bit small for my tastes. Luckily, their prices aren't too bad. Getting a large wouldn't hurt for the next time I drop by.  

The coffee shop itself is a nice place to be in. It keeps itself subtle and music choices are very easy to listen to. I primarily went here to study, so the music is easy to tune out when my face is in my book. The couch they have there is incredibly comfortable. I could sit my buns on this thing for hours, essentially great for a study grind. There are plenty of outlets available, with free wifi as well. t's a pleasant place to be.

I was wrong in both regards. The coffee is extraordinary and priced reasonable (read: as much as I'm willing to pay for coffee- which is not much!) it was earthy and flavorful.  The Mint Mocha Frappe was a delightful combination of two delicious flavors. You can taste the dark flavors of the mocha with the freshness of the mint - without either overpowering the other. 

I ordered a vegan nom nom burrito, a breakfast burrito, vegan style. It was delicious. It had flavors and texture so often missing from vegan food and was truly one of the best I've ever had. It was a refreshing change and paired nicely with the black tea latte I also ordered. 

The staff is knowledgeable, friendly, and genuinely wanted to make sure we enjoyed our food and our stay. I'll definitely be returning to Sunrise Coffee as I continue to visit Vegas.",OFbSjSfbNR8ZIE1KCMmtJg,1,0,5,-J2filUq4Hp1GCIPZW2qVA

The table itself had flowers on it and I thought that was a nice touch. It was interesting to see all kinds of different people float on through for their coffee or treat.

The coffee isn't burnt and it's pretty smooth. I usually get the croissant breakfast sandwich to go along with my morning coffee, and while it tastes amazing, it's a little messy. That's my only gripe with the sandwich. I look like a heathen eating this thing while there's crumbs and chunks of avocado falling all over me. If anything, I should just get this sandwich to-go so I can enjoy it without other people looking at me like I'm an animal or something. 

Since I live nearby, I usually frequent Sunrise Coffee on the weekends to get some work done. It does get a little busy on Saturday and Sunday mornings with people just hanging out, getting some work done, or just enjoying some good coffee. If you decide to come here on weekend mornings, just be aware of that.

The workers are really great and enthusiastic. The best part about this cafe is the baristas that work there. Every time I go, I get great service, and everyone is really nice to me. It's what keeps me coming back time after time.

The barista behind the counter was very nice and helpful. She recommended to us the Nutella and Creme Brulee lattes. We got them iced and delivered to us while we sat at a couple of old brown chairs. The chairs were pretty worn out and had rips all over them, but that was the least of my worries. I came to Sunrise because I heard they had good coffee and I was excited for my Nonfat Creme Brulee Iced Latte! We paid a little under $10 total.

So it began! Tasted, pause for the aftertaste, tasted again. Tasted my boyfriend's Nutella latte, pause, tasted again... unfortunately... they were alright. =( 

Yummy, but didn't have that extra oomph I enjoy so much in Grouchy John's, Sambalatte's or Starbucks' lattes. I get nonfat milk all the time so I'm sure that wasn't it. Also, the Creme Brulee had a very VERY extremely light brulee taste, and I had to search hard for its notes. The Nutella had so little Nutella in there as well. If I wasn't in a rush, I might've asked for just a teeny little more Nutella. I felt like the only Nutella that was in there was drizzled on the sides of the cup to make it look pretty.

They have vegetarian and vegan options if you're into that. And I think they use free-trade, organic stuff, roast their own beans and use eco-friendly paper products. 

They have a lot of seating and power outlets (plus free wifi!) for a small coffee shop but it does get crowded by mid afternoon. The outdoor patio area is nice with just enough shade and they have bowls for water and treats for my dogs. 

The drive through is convenient, never slow, and they always give my dogs treats.

A little about my credentials:
I first got into cooking & food when I was in college. After being rejected by numerous girls and getting zero action, I decided it was time for a change. I needed a new makeover to boost my geeky image. I applied for a cooking position at a Mediterranean-Italia n Restaurant near my home and learned to cook all sorts of pastas and dishes.

4393108,2018-01-22,1,UMqfeCItzQ2glr4d9apGlA,"Sunrise is another one of my favorite places in town that I've been visiting for years. I don't live that close to it so I tend to go out of my way to visit instead of going to my local Starbucks/Coffee Bean/etc (barf), and it's always well worth the trip. It's probably a mixture of the drinks, atmosphere, and people that keep me coming back. 

The menu is filled with a variety of drink choices, flavors, and mixes along with an array of milk alternatives and options for hot/cold, caffeinated/decaf, and seasonal choices that I don't usually see around town. I don't like my drinks too sweet so I don't get too crazy, and I'm usually happy with a simple latte or coffee here, but I love having options. The price of drinks are very fair, especially with how much other places around town are charging (looking at you, S@mb@). I haven't tried many of their food choices but my favorite has to be the vegan Alien Burrito. Most of their items are cafe-type items good with coffee like pastries or breakfast foods.

Sunrise is also well known for their totes adorbs outdoor seating that gets very popular when weather is pleasant. They really optimized their indoor seating with the space they have, yeah you might have to put your sweet butt in peoples face to pass by when it's busy but overall it works and there is a range of table sizes available so you can read a book, chat with friends, work on your Harry Potter erotic fan fiction, meet up with your Tinder date (I somehow always manage to sit right next to these), or for your next pyramid scheme business meeting.  

For me, Sunrise has some of the best baristas I've come across, they almost always play amazing music, they keep the place super clean, and they always make sure I'm happy with my drinks. Even the regulars I come across seem friendly & polite.. there's beard guy who I think I see at my gym, older guy with the laptop who sneezes once every hour, girl who sits in the corner planning mischievous things, super knowledgeable dude who stands up at the front, buff bag guy who brings his smelly food to eat with him almost every time, the young group of people with accents that I'm sure are mostly runway models, and Erik with a k who always orders when I do to make sure we get confused on whose order is ready.

4451498,2011-04-13,0,UMqfeCItzQ2glr4d9apGlA,"I am both a coffee snob and a coffee-addict. The thing is, I will drink coffee anywhere, anytime, with any people, for any reason. Ya, I'll even go as low to drink Maxwell House if it's sitting in a cup in front of me. That's where my ""addict"" part comes to play. 

I am on the other hand a coffee snob. I distinctly know the difference between a decent, pure cup of coffee, and a bad cup of coffee. Good coffee has a robust taste, it is not exactly watery, nor is it creamy, it is a good in-between. Good coffee can be drunk without cream and sugar because the taste of the coffee is neither really bitter, biting, nor is it totally flat. The best coffee in my opinion comes fair-trade, organic, and brewed very well. 

Sunrise Coffee has this kind of coffee. I was somewhat skeptical as to whether or not it would please me, even with the multiple Yelp reviews that say it is fantastic. But I confess, it was held up to all expectations and then some. I only ran in to grab a cup of coffee to go (I suppose I could have gone through the drive-thru, but I wanted to see the inside), but it is some of the best coffee I have ever, ever had. I have only had better coffee at a few coffee shops in Portland, Oregon.

I wish Sunrise was not so far away from me. I ran by there because I happened to be in the Henderson area. If it were closer to me I would absolutely be there many times a week. The inside is laid back with nice music, and a very inviting staff. And there is free WiFi! Woo hoo!

The only reason it does not get 5 Stars is because of the poor location. Not just because it is far from me, but because of the strip-mall location. I wish the owners might consider purchasing a building that is not in a strip-mall because this coffee shop begs to have its own building, set apart from other places.",hZfzVrhsCQ9JDAb2jYoJNQ,1,0,4,IS5PFQW2QiLiV74MbM87ew

I should have not had to ask this but then this lady comes out of the kitchen who obviously works in the kitchen so the girl asked her and in a very rude manner she responded with ""I don't know I didn't make it"".

4542231,2018-05-24,0,UMqfeCItzQ2glr4d9apGlA,"Sunrise was just as I imagined it to be. Hipster & cute at it's finest. The indoor space seemed bigger online than it did in person but nonetheless there was a fair amount of seating inside and outside. It had a nice aesthetic inside, simple, clean, and sleek. Easy on the eyes and inviting! Their menu was simple yet still hard to choose from. I debated between the Hot Mess bowl and the Nom Nom breakfast burrito and the Hot Mess bowl won. The Hot Mess bowl consisted of potatoes, eggs, bell peppers, sour cream, spinach, eggs, tomato, and cholula sauce with a slice of toast. It was flavorful and filling. The potatoes were nicely cooked and seasoned. It was definitely something that I could whip up myself, but for $8 I will gladly pay for convenience sake. I washed my meal down with their Strawberry Jasmine lemonade. Clearly, based on my picture's caption I didn't know what I was drinking LOL but that's beside the point. IT WAS DELISH! It was so refreshing and light. I feel like the Jasmine tea helped calm the tartness of the lemon and the sweetness of the strawberry, making a beautiful menage trois of flavors in your mouth. 

Considering that this wonderful discovery of mine is on the complete opposite side of town from me, I would be more than happy to take the journey back just to have a taste of their other food and drink items. The staff was accommodating and the service was fairly fast. The day I went there was a sign up that food order would take 15 minutes or so to be made but I didn't even notice the time.

At many places, croissants often seem pre-packaged, flat, and have just been sitting inside the window the entire day. The croissant here seems fuller, buttery, slightly flaky.. (don't mean to exaggerate) but it's comparable to the ones I've had in Paris as well.

I stopped by because I had run out of coffee beans. When I visited Colorado River Coffee Roasters a couple of years ago, they told me that Sunrise was no longer their customer because they started roasting their own beans. As it turns out, Sunrise will soon open up a separate location for their Mothership Coffee Roasters brand. But for now, you can buy the beans at Sunrise.

As I walk in, I see that they have four varieties available, but nothing specifically marked as an espresso blend. So I ask the guy for a recommendation. Long story short, I went with the Guatemala Café Femenino. It's organic, fair trade, and all women farmers? Interesting. Anyway, the latte I made this morning was absolutely delicious. Good job women farmers!

A nice touch was that my cup of cold brew coffee was on the house thanks to my purchase of beans. To top it off, their cold brew was perfectly tasty and refreshing.

It's definitely nice to have a quality local spot to grab freshly roasted beans. Sunrise Coffee and the upcoming Mothership Coffee Roasters just might be my new go to spots.",YwaKGmRNnSa3R3N4Hf9jLw,11,9,5,aMiIBo9ETy3uPV6FPF72aQ

I initially decided to give it a try after a friend let me know they have vegan and gluten free options. I was really excited to see what kind of options they have for me since Las Vegas is not very veg-friendly. Unfortunately, they offer some vegan options and some gluten free options, but only their gluten free granola is vegan as well. I was pretty bummed my first visit because I was informed they were out of the granola I could have. Because I was really hungry, I opted for a banana and a side of cashew butter and a fancy coffee.

The latte I received was beautifully presented, and I love that they serve drinks in mugs rather than wasting paper and plastic. I was really impressed by their customer service. Since they were out of the granola that day, the cashier was kind enough to give me a card for two free food items my next visit. Even more impressive, he apparently found some granola after I sat down and brought it to me with almond milk; on the house. So amazing! I honestly could care less that the only option for me is the granola because it's incredibly good. Furthermore, their employees are so great I would go just for that reason.

I highly recommend trying out this locally owned, independent coffee shop. They use biodegradable cutlery and plastic cups, offer organic, fair trade coffee, and high quality, organic loose leaf teas. The only thing missing are a few different vegan AND gluten free pastries, hint hint ;)

4654944,2016-10-08,6,UMqfeCItzQ2glr4d9apGlA,"Sunrise is the spirit of Sunset. Situated off of Sunset Road between Eastern Avenue and Pecos Road six lanes across from Sunset Park and under the flight path, Sunrise creates an agreeable community environment in a disagreeable world. Over the years, I have driven to Sunset to experience the spirit of Sunrise. 

   In a city where casinos close overnight and Vegas history is instantly erased for so-called progress; Sunrise Coffee is a small business success story. It is a success story that goes back to 2008 when the owners Josh Walter and Juanny Romero opened Sunrise Coffee and turbocharged the independent Las Vegas coffee scene faster than a grande shot of expresso. Sunrise Coffee has won accolades and high ratings for their coffee and coffee house environment. Sunrise is considered by many to be the longest opened independent coffee shop in Las Vegas. 

  This award winning coffee shop is a spot that I have spent hours in. Today on National Frappe Day, I celebrated the beverage here. To be to the point their Frape is not their strong point. I paid $5.50 for a drink that was slushy and lacked the flavor of competing Frappes. It was nothing like the Truffle berry flame that I enjoyed a year ago. Nothing is perfect. However their coffee that I drank at least 40 times is close to perfect. 

  I am a fan of the drip coffee. It is a drip coffee that Sunrise blends themselves under their Mothership banner. The coffee is flavorful and strong. When you add in my Mothership visits (their sister shop) I have enjoyed their coffee at least 70 times. The coffee comes out to $2.70 for a medium. Additionally their chocolate chip cookie is the bomb. 

   The inner space of Sunrise is a contradiction to the outer space of Sunset. Across from the open grass of Sunset Park, the inside space of Sunrise is crowded. Their reputation speaks in an often nearly full house of coffee drinkers ranging from hipsters to independent people like me. From the corner couch to the bar seats and east wall booths; Sunrise is a happening scene from sunrise to sunset. It is a happening scene that extends to the outside patio. On a cooler day, the outside patio offers an unusual coffee house activity, which is watching the low flying airplanes above about to land at McCarren Airport a couple miles to the west. My favorite activity takes place indoors when I connect my laptop or phone to the outlet and go online watching YouTube while enjoying a cup of coffee. 

   Another thing that is not bitter is customer service. The employees have always been professional and attentive to the details of my caffeineated beverage. 

  Sunrise Coffee is one of the Many coffee house that I appreciate. I don't take living near Sunrise Coffee for granted. Just like the sun is guaranteed to return to sunset I am guaranteed to return to Sunrise.",0tvCcnfJnSs55iB6mqPk3w,13,11,4,SIldbeGws6IW-v435WBUCQ

The four stars are completely for the staff. The three gentlemen behind the counter were very polite, friendly, and hilarious (when I asked for a spicy chai, one of the baristas joked that he could add chili powder for an extra kick). My latte was ready in what seemed like only 30 seconds and off I went.

Unfortunately, the chai tea latte was NOT what I expected. I'm not deducting stars for this because maybe I underestimated exactly what a ""dirty"" latte is. It seemed very bitter and grainy to me, not at all like the normal sweet and spicy lattes that I enjoy.

Ordered the tofurkey sandwich (veganized - tofurkey, vegan cheez, tomato, spinach, red bell pepper, hummus on whole grain bread) and my friend got the An Alien Left a Burrito in the Middle East (hehehe), veganized - spinach tortilla w/ beans, vegan cheese, hummus, couscous, and veggies.  I had a bite and it was nummers! I'm gonna get that next time for sure. 

They also have a black bean sandwich (not veganizable) and breakfast items (can't wait to try the breakfast burrito!).  Reasonably priced coffee drinks, lots of teas (including a very tasty local organic ""Summer Orchard"").

Very friendly staff, and we got our food and drinks really quickly.  Was surprised at how inexpensive it was, bonus! 

Looks like it would be a fun place to hang out with a few friends on one of the sofas (they had several board games).

Sure, there are a lot of Starbucks, but I mean a place that has coffee that doesn't taste like water.  This lack of coffee houses is especially true near where I live in east Vegas.  There are a couple, but none that really have the feel I want.  

But alas!  I have found a place.  The coffee was very good, the cappuccinos are great, they offer the option of a french press, and even their iced coffee was great!  The coffee was from Klatch Coffee, a small family roaster in Southern California, and you could tell they took the extra effort to find a great roaster.  

I don't know if this happened to anyone else, but after endless terrible cappuccinos I thought that maybe I'd never find a great cappuccino in Las Vegas.  But when I got my first sip of the cappuccino at Sunrise Coffee, it was more than just a sip, it was a renewed faith in Las Vegas coffee.  The coffee was flavorful, yet smooth, and when combined with perfect froth it created a great cappuccino.

Today, I tried the chai latte with almond milk & the vegan nom nom burrito. My latte came out at the perfect temperature...hot without burning my tongue when I took a sip immediately after it came out. It also wasn't too spicy as some chai lattes can be (Starbucks chai is the worst!) Although I'm not a huge fan of soy replacing non-vegan items in vegan food, I did enjoy my burrito. It stayed true to it's name as I ""nom nom'd"" every last bite of this tasty wrap. The veggies inside were fresh & crisp, and the combination of the flavors would satisfy even a non-vegan (which I am). 

Everything came out in a timely manner, and the customer service is great! They also have free Wifi, which is a must for every real coffee spot. I found my new breakfast place of choice! I look forward to trying ALL of the menu items, and I will update accordingly.

The indoor environment is super cute and the staff is nice. Lots of seating and great for getting work done. Access to plugs as well. The outdoor seating is extremely beautiful and full of greenery! Excellent vibes. Friendly staff as well.",X5U6cb3nscdEuT5OJGnK_A,0,0,3,lESa-zx3ojufBi8Pk67sIg

I randomly came here since I had to wait a couple hours before the class started and I was quite surprised at how wonderful of a place it is. 

The baristas are so friendly and knowledgeable about their drinks. They play great music, display nice artwork, and have a bookshelf full of books (some appear not to be the greatest selection, but that's okay) and the clientele that come in regularly are all artsy and studious type of individuals so it's a nice crowd to be around. 

The drinks I've had were fantastic. I've had their caramel frappe, white mocha frappe, and butterscotch beer frappe. When you sit in they serve their drinks in the cutest little mason jars! That made me really happy for some reason. It was just a unique touch. 

The only reason I give it 4 stars is because of the size of the shop and due the to popularity of it, it can be hard to find seats and you may feel a little squished when you're sitting there on a busy day. The outdoor patio seating area is really cute, but still not enough space especially if the weather doesn't permit outdoor seating. Other than that, I love this little gem of a coffee shop.

5030861,2014-05-13,1,UMqfeCItzQ2glr4d9apGlA,"I have been on the hunt for a perfect coffee spot. I work from home, and love mixing it up scenery. Let's hit the basics:

1. The location is right off the main drag making it a pretty straight shot to get to. 

2. Convenience Factor: There is a drive-thru which is perfect if you are on the go. If you are here to stay, there is ample parking!

3. Ambiance: There is the cutest outdoor seating area that makes you forget that you are essentially surrounded by a parking lot. This is a ""Don't Judge a Book by its Cover"" kind of shop. What I mean by that is from the outside, you are not sure it is going to be anything special, especially if you don't see the outdoor seating. When you walk in, you immediately feel at home. It is spacious and offers plenty of seating. The lighting is dim and relaxing and the music is not played so loud that you cannot hear yourself think. It is the perfect spot to work, study, or just meet a friend. Don't believe, go check it out and you can see people doing all of the above!

4. The good stuff: I was excited to hear that all of the coffee was organic! They only roast a medium blend which at first was off-putting but it was a delightful cup of coffee! The barista was extremely friendly and helpful. Since I was there to stay, my coffee was served in a nice ceramic mug. I did not try the food this trip, but their pastries look delicious and their vegan options are impressive!

My final thought is about the climate! If you spend several hours in a coffee shop like I do, temperature is important! Some cafe's seem to freeze people out or some get too hot - since you don't control the temperature, this is important! The temperature was great all day. Not too hot, not cold. It was honestly just right. 

I will definitely be coming back!",uyoUkPvmVjFMcjs9NIomAA,1,3,4,v15AU2ZX08xKoFO06JhnKQ

5041573,2013-09-14,0,UMqfeCItzQ2glr4d9apGlA,"Feeling a little under the weather, I decided to suck it up and meet one of my dearest friends at the coffee shop to have a latte and get some work done.  I've heard so many great things about this place and thought this was the perfect opportunity!  

It's located on north side of Sunset Rd after Pecos, if you're driving west bound.  It's in a small building, detached to a strip mall, like everything else in Las Vegas.  When you walk in, you're greeted by the beautiful aroma of espresso and a very warm staff.  They are fun, vibrant and ready to help.  Also, the place wasn't busy when I arrive, but man!  It's filled up quickly!  People sitting around the tables and couches, great conversations, working on their laptops.  Such an amazing coffee shop feel!  

For my drink, I got the large hazelnut latte, hot and in a mug for $4.05.  When they called my name, I picked up my drink, only to find out that they beautifully decorated the froth into a leaf.  WOW!! I've heard of some coffee shops doing that but to see it in person was an amazing thing!  What was better than that, the latte was actually THE BEST latte I've ever tasted!  So creamy, lightly hinted with the taste of hazelnut and warm, but not too hot.  This drink was AH-MAZE-ING and completely on point.  

I also got the peanut butter, jelly and banana sandwich for $3.45.  Omg, it reminded me of my younger days as a small kid.  The peanut butter wasn't chunky, however, so creamy and flavorful.  Btw, it's organic!  Huge plus.  Then add the strawberry jam and sliced bananas in a couple of multigrain toasted bread and you got heaven in a sammy.  Highly recommended for those who want to get in touch with their inner child. 

Listen folks, I will definitely rave about this place for time to come.  In fact, I will get my happy butt here on the weekends to do some work from now on.  With the free wifi, why wouldn't you?  This place has got to be my top favorite coffee joints in Las Vegas.  Btw, from 5pm-8pm everyday, they have happy hour.  $1 hot or iced small coffee, $2 hot or iced small plain lattes and $1 pastries.  Hello reason to come back!

Their customer service is also fantastic. One time they took a little long to make my drink and they gave me a coupon for a free drink the next time I came. And it was ANY drink free, not just a small coffee or something.

They have an interesting coffee selection, the pumpkin spice is better than most. I'm a Harry Potter fan, so I was delighted they make Butter Beer, I think it's only great cold, I would not recommend getting it as a hot latte. The Creme Brulee you just have to taste it to believe it.

The croissant was soft enough that it just melts in your mouth,  Egg was scrambled just right.  It came with avocados and tomato and something that I have never had or seen before in a sandwich. It wasn't lettuce but instead leaves.  Yes, like leaves on trees.  Anyone that has been here before know what these green leaves are?  Reason I'm asking is I'm going to attempt to see if i can make a sandwich similar to this at home.

For food I ate their tofurkey 'wich, which was pretty good.  Definitely a tasty lunch snack.  Their 'NomNom' burrito was the best breakfast burrito my girlfriend had ever eaten.  For avocado lovers out there, when they say there is avo on something, they do Not skimp.

My boyfriend and I started coming here when it first opened years ago and it was love at first sight... or taste. Yeah, taste works better. We love the vegan alien burrito, the granola for a happy tummy and just about every coffee drink on the menu. Oh, and the pastries! Don't even get me started on those. If I didn't live so far away I would probably eat a muffin every single day. Not even kidding.

The staff is always nice and most of them seem to recognize us. We met the owners Josh and Juanny a couple years ago and they have always made us feel special. We just love them! Truly genuine people.

I discovered these guys when I was trapped in our corporate office which was essentailly next door. I became addicted to their fabulous coffee, tea, and sweets (food too).

I will always suggest to ANYONE that they go there for their coffee, for their culture, and for their finding other like minded cool folks to commiserate with.

I hope they are able to expand their coffee empire across town too... they roast their own beans now and I tell you the two of them are just kicking Henderson butt and taking LAS VEGAS NAMES.

I have never had a cup of coffee, tea, chai (yeah I know it's tea), water, or anything else here that wasn't top notch. If I were in Las Vegas more I would be here more... when I provide gifts to co-workers it's usually a gift card for these guys.

If you want a cool place to hang
If you want great coffee/sweets/food
If you want to feel like you are part of what's happening in Las Vegas/Henderson

GO HERE ex post haste!

Coming from Seattle, I'd like to think I have some taste in coffee, yet my inability to handle coffee seems to contradict this. But iced nutella latte? I am in! Living the past year in Seattle, this place definitely makes me feel at home in a city that couldn't be any more different. Quaint, intimate, and welcoming - not to mention, the music selection! Indie music is always okay with me, especially when they play my favorites (they did).

Meeting up with a friend, we both ordered the Alien Burrito. Hers was regularly prepared, I ordered mine Vegan with vegan cream cheese and mayo. A few minutes later, a spinach tortilla wrap with refried beans, copious amounts of spinach, red pepper, hummus, and vegan condiments came out. A few moments after that, it was half-devoured, and I was already stuffed. It was delicious! The fare was reminiscent of Seattle - good food, fresh ingredients with a conscious state of mind. 

My friend and I spent the next four hours just conversing, eating, and drinking. But what I enjoy the most is the friendliness of the staff. Never once did I feel uncomfortable or pressured to leave once I was done. They were polite in taking away our dishes, and left us to our own agendas. Quite frankly, the music had my won over from the first few minutes. With the food and staff in consideration, I may never leave.",rzatTfGhdFwgyfAP9yhPLg,0,0,5,kSl_O86EZhjd4j1R6FvkTQ

1.  They can lash out, and post awful things in response, which I've seen a number of businesses do.
2.  They can reach out privately to the customer, and sincerely apologize, (also stating that they will be having a meeting to correct the behavior...)

This is how I found myself back at Sunrise Coffee so soon after my visit a couple of weeks ago.  I was less than impressed then, but the day after I posted my review, I was contacted by the owner.  
He apologized profusely and sincerely, and stated that there would be a meeting to address what I had referred to as ""snarky attitudes.""
That impressed me.  For an owner to reach out on a personal level, well...that scores big points with me.  

Well. 
Whether it was the meeting, or I just happened to be there on an off day last time, today's visit was night and day. 

I walked in, and the vibe was better.
The shop was packed, but employees were smiling...even the girl who was dealing with a rather difficult sounding customer was super sweet.

Service was polite.  Friendly...everything I had expected!

The coffee, again, was delicious.  Today I tried the Truffleberry, and wowza, is THAT delicious!

Strawberry Corriander Muffin

Drip Coffee

Visited occasionally in the past for coffee en route to the office, but overlooked for pastries as items were previously outsourced, a return visit to Sunrise Coffee was planned the moment rumor was heard that all muffins, cookies, and confections were now crafted by the team at sister-shop Mothership; plans to meet owner Juanny Romero at 9:00am just a mile down the street prompting an early stop that showed the brew as bold as ever while the relaxed vibe and free WiFi offered impetus to stick around and enjoy a trio of pastries crafted with top tier ingredients and balance bolstered by creativity as well as skill.

A icon of the local coffee culture since 2008, and as such a veritable forefather to the current scene slowly creeping towards the Strip and Western Suburbs, Sunrise Coffee has long featured the locally roasted Mothership brand of beans and with fanciful lattes, espressos, cappuccinos, pour-overs, and presses available it was instead in a medium cup of drip that I invested, the effect of light roasting readily apparent even in the simplest option as fig and caramel tones coated the tongue,

Moving on to pastries, each item individually plated by one of four friendly youngsters tasked with everything from barrista duties to crafting sandwiches from organic produce sourced from a farm in California, the glass case at Sunrise is a bit more straightforward than the counter of Mothership, but with some similarities and a focus on balanced flavors the only question becomes where best to invest one's appetite, the seasonal cinnamon roll a good first choice as caramelized pineapple finds balance in light yeast with the sort of frosting that never seems cloying, but rather a semi-sweet delivery mechanism for the cinnamon and butter tones beneath.

Passing on a scone that had previously wowed on Green Valley Parkway, instead choosing to focus on muffins exclusive to Sunrise, it was with bites of the strawberry and  corriander iteration that the tasting progressed, and with a supple crumb and flavors that bridged savory to natural sweetness the follow-up was no less remarkable, the bitterness of dark walnuts proving an admirable foil to overripe bananas as  homey autumnal notes rang through with aplomb.

Now perhaps best judged as the casual sibling of brainy sister Mothership, Sunrise Coffee Roasters continues to turn out some of the city's best brews, and for those looking to sit, sip, savor, and perhaps enjoy a sandwich there are few better places to do so in town.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,10,11,4,vlPEAi9SMg4QtxvVOvjp2g

Five very big stars.
My husband and I came across this place on our way to an early movie at Galaxy Green Valley last Saturday. We did our due diligence and scoped the place out on yelp and their website.

I knew immediately that I wanted to try their Candy Cane Latte being that I am a big fan of anything minty. I usually just like drip coffee but I was feeling fancy. The coffee shop itself was just marvelous. I loved the empty frames hanging from the wall. I was a big fan of the varied seating options available: comfy chairs, tables, pub style- tables and stools. Plus the cool enclosed patio outside and the eclectic collection of books to read on the shelf.
My husband ordered the Mexican mocha and when we both received our drinks, a little bit of magic happened. Every sip was just awesome. I loved and appreciated the latte art. I loved the perfect ratio of foam and steamed milk. I loved the perfect hint of mint. I loved the mug that the latte was in. I loved every single thing about my drink.
My husband wanted me to try his (he loved it too), but I would have to share some of mine and I wasn't willing to do that so I told him I'd just take him at his word. :)

20 oz later, I decided, I'm going to order ANOTHER drink. This time I tried the Nutella latte. The husband also decided to get another drink and he picked a hazelnut latte.
Again, it was another 20 oz of loveliness. It had this great bite to it - it was different but perfect.

So, 40 ounces later, I was feeling quite content with myself. I would have loved to try the wraps or a pastry, and I will next time - but I had a lunch date planned so I stuck to just 2 LARGE mugs of wonderful.

For any coffee aficionado, for all latte lovers city-wide, I must say that Sunrise Coffee is as charming as they come. The staff was super friendly, the place was spotless, but most importantly, their was a piece of pride made in every mug there.

Coming from the westside, I always look forward to my monthly morning visit to Sunrise Coffee. Today was a fluke; it was 1:30 p.m., on my way to a 2p appointment just a block away from Sunrise (3min away).  I figured I can sneak in a quick cold brew and a PB&J. Well that was a mistake. I placed my order at 1:33 and at 1:53 I was starting to get concerned that someone dropped the ball because a PB&J probably takes all of 5min even if it were your first day on the job and, they weren't even busy.  

Finally someone on staff noticed and was aware enough to see that a customer was clearly at angst about sonething. They made it and brought it out in under 2min. See, it can be done.  In the end, I had all of 2 minutes to scarf down that sandwich. They were sincerely apologetic and acknowledged that it was not communicated to the kitchen.  I'll accept that albeit does not change the domino effect it caused the rest of my day.  My world runs on 30-minute increments; all it takes is one to screw up the flow. Go to Sunrise when you're relaxed, have your computer to do work or just hang out but, if you're  a go-getter where you need the people in your day to have a sense of urgency, you'd be better off elsewhere.",6_OsfMU6GhlnhKE1g28r9g,0,0,2,HLl4vTqUJF5GKbEa80vZ-g
5372890,2011-04-21,3,UMqfeCItzQ2glr4d9apGlA,"This quaint little coffee shop offers everything that Las Vegas lacked for so long. Overran by Starbucks, there was a minute chance that an independent place could thrive. Unlike the other stores that have come and gone, Sunrise has everything it takes to withstand the pressure from the big corporations. The coffee is fair trade, the tea is loose leaf, the food is better than most restaurants, everything can be vegetarian or veganized, the atmosphere is relaxed, the staff are helpful, and they have live bands that play on occasions. With all of these ups, I cannot think of a negative comment. 

Upon checking in for checking in for the first time, you get an offer for a free iced coffee. I decided to save it for another day as an incentive and reminder to come back. I had ordered the Alien Burrito even though I abhor most of the ingredients with a passion. I know very few people who hate cream cheese, refried  beans, ranch, or mayo as much as I do and a combination of these items would usually have me gagging. When I had ordered, I asked for no cream cheese and ranch. The person taking my order asked if I would like to get the vegan version, subbing a vegan cream cheese and mayo instead. While hesitating and cringing, she assured me that it was a better alternative and fewer calories. Not wanting to be one of those people who refuses to give certain foods another try, I trusted her, and caved. Before she started making it, she gave me the option of having Sriracha sauce. If you love Vietnamese food, the spicy red sauce makes pho even better than it already is. As advertised, it makes everything better. I won't go overboard and say I will be layering all of my foods in mayo or cream cheese, but I won't be averse to getting this burrito again.",N3oNEwh0qgPqPP3Em6wJXw,1,2,5,G_l_vvAuJ3g6gV4_DAOCeg

Sunrise is a cute, independent coffee shop with good drinks and food and friendly staff. In a town awash with Starbucks (isn't every town now?) it is such a relief to find somewhere different. 

Had a perfectly good black coffee and a really good vegan nom-nom breakfast burrito. Happy to see somewhere that not only has vegan options (great for those of us with dairy issues), but has really interesting options as well. All the pastries looked really good, too. The staff is definitely rocking the indie coffeehouse vibe, but they are surprisingly friendly and fast. I am clearly jaded from my years of living in Portland.

The main issue I see with this place is that it appears to be too successful for its own britches. The interior is pretty small and although they have made the most of the space with tables, chairs and a communal seating area, it just isn't enough. When I was there the place was packed both inside and on the outdoor patio, with no free seating anywhere. So many people in one small space made it feel a bit claustrophobic and you could hear everyones conversations. If the space issue could somehow be remedied without losing the charm of the place this would be the ideal study spot.",A_dC3FJOqvlsDEiDyMrzlA,2,1,4,DftDSrWfVMb2lvWN13W-nA

Strip mall coffee shop, but it's got a decent vibe.  There's a little nook in the corner with some couches and a coffee table, a high-top community table , another bigger table, and then a ton of two tops around.  There's some counter-top seating along the west wall too.  Outside that west wall, there's a nice looking pergola that's got another dozen or so two-tops/benches.  It's a little split brained - the outside seating has these organic looking chairs, while inside they've got a lot of metal and light wood in a kind of standard, modern coffee shop feel.

Looks like they use Mothership Roasting.  I hadn't heard of them, and a quick Google search turns up a super hipster looking website for this Vegas based roaster - copper Hario V60s and Buono kettles with subway tiles in the background.  The drip coffee I had was solid.

I'm from out of town and when I work in vegas I have to have my morning coffee, and this place really is a treat.

They have two La Marzocco espresso machines, which really make a difference on how your coffee comes out and the foam. Hey, some people care about this stuff...

I had the breakfast burrito and it was good! Maybe a little heavy on the potato, but it was pretty tasty.

Why not 5 stars?
If 5 stars was PERFECT, then 4 is really good. If I'm being really picky, the coffee flavor could be a little stronger, maybe a darker roast? Also, the food wasn't out of this world (as far as what I've tried) but overall, for the price, it's a great local coffee shop.

- Very friendly and laidback employees! It feels like I'm hanging out with friends who just happen to make coffee and suck money out of my credit card while doing so
- Every drink I have tasted is either good or really good, which is rare since I'm pretty picky when it comes to coffee
- Seating and outlets!
- Outdoor seating for nicer weather; also dog-friendly
- Organized and visually appealing menu
- Prices affordable especially for the quality you get
- Drive-thru available for those in a rush but I'm sure that can't be fun for employees

DISLIKES
- The horrible traffic due to construction
- It can get crowded aka lack of seating aka don't come in a huge group (a testament to their popularity)
- Closes early (not a surprise for a coffee shop of course, but it's nice to study at midnight sometimes)

My personal favorite: Truffle berry latte less sweet! Harmonious blend of raspberry and chocolate.

Hanging out in a coffee shop is a requirement for anyone living in Seattle, so I've grown to appreciate the art of spending a few hours relaxing in a local shop. I should immediately confess that I am not a coffee drinker, but I can appreciate a good cup of tea. Upon entering Sunrise it was immediately apparent that it could easily be located in Seattle. It is very inviting, there are couches, a bar, a patio, and a bookcase. There are delicious looking pastries and lunch options as well. All of the coffee drinkers that I have visited with really loved their drinks, particularly the Nutella latte. I appreciate their tea selection and also the caffeine free menu (I was very recently pregnant and needed some caffeine free options). My favorite caffeine free option is the homemade horchata, who would have thought? 

The staff is always really friendly and patient. I also love the tip jar, there are usually two choices and you put your two cents (hopefully more) in the jar that you most identify with - for example - Star Wars vs. Star Trek. So creative and definitely encourages tipping!

Although my office is nearby, endless construction along Sunset causes it to be quite difficult to make it here in a reasonable amount of time. Initially, I decided to give Sunrise a try after a friend let me know that they offer several vegan and gluten-free options. I was quite excited to see what the offerings were since Las Vegas is not the most veg-friendly/gluten-free friendly city. Unfortunately, although Sunrise does offer some vegan options and some gluten free options, their gluten free granola/one daily muffin selection are the only options that are vegan as well. I was rather disappointed after my first visit since I was informed they were out of the granola and muffins I would normally be able to have. Because I was really hungry, I opted for a banana and a side of cashew butter and a fancy coffee.

The latte I received was beautifully presented, and I love that they serve drinks in mugs rather than wasting paper and/or plastic. I was also really impressed with the overall customer service. Since they were out of the granola that day, the barista was kind enough to give me a card for two free food items my next visit. Even more impressive, he apparently found some granola after I sat down and brought it to me with almond milk, on the house (so awesome!). I should probably also add that I could honestly care less that the only options for me are the granola and/or muffins (if available) because they are incredibly good.

I highly recommend trying out this locally owned, independent coffee shop. They use biodegradable cutlery and plastic cups; offer organic, fair trade coffee; and high quality, organic loose leaf teas.

The outside windows are heavily painted, so you can't really see inside. When I walked in I was surprised to see the place about 80% full with people and their laptops. Its much bigger inside than I imagined, as well as having an outdoor patio. Now I know why the parking lot is always full....I always thought it was people going across the street to Sunset Park. 

The staff was friendly and patient with me because I'm not a coffee snob, and I just wanted a iced coffee, preferably a mocha. The lady explained a couple of my options and I went with the cold brewed version with a little bit of cream and white mocha flavor. The coffee was smooth, no bitterness, and needed no additional adds. Delicious!!!!

This is definitely Hipster central. Almost every guy in here was sporting a beard, checkered shirt, and jeans...even on a hot afternoon. Most looked like they had never seen the sun. I don't know about you, but when the temperature is above 80, you will find me only in shorts, flip flops, and a nice comfortable lightweight shirt. It wasn't like the coffee shop was A/C'd down to 70. I just find this a bit....strange. Almost like ""Hey lets go to the coffeeshop"" ""OK, I'll get my hipster wardrobe on and we can go"" LOL. Now don't get all offended, this is just a simple observation. I only saw one other guy wearing shorts out of 20. 

Another observation is that other than their own group or partner, no one even looks at anyone else. They are either buried in their laptop or other device. No smiles, no human interaction. Its the exact opposite of a bar/saloon atmosphere.

The coffee is good. They feature some Mothership Roaster blends as well. They have a drive thru. Prices didn't seem too bad, my small iced coffee came out to $2.32.",wXZS42D0L8hoCiSh2Krc_A,5,7,4,usBv20I9oSWDZG7-wbWu-g

5797211,2012-04-21,1,UMqfeCItzQ2glr4d9apGlA,"THIS. 

This is what coffee shops are supposed to look like (at least in my opinion!)

I've never walked into a coffee shop until Sunrise, and there's shelves of books to read at your pleasure. Books of all kind, non-fiction, fiction, do it yourself, educational. Coffee shops have a staple for being the place to go to become ""enlightened"", ""informed"", ""nerdy"". I was immediately fascinated by this when I was waiting for my nutella frapuccino. Wait, *nutella* frapuccino? Oh, yes. Might I add this is a genius coffee with the best of both worlds?

I don't believe every single item is of an organic and vegan quality (obviously creamers and milk aren't of vegan quality), but I love their outlook on presenting the best cup of coffee or tea in the most sustainable manner possible. I guess when you're already a tree hugger, you might get giddy about that. But seriously, it was more so the allure of the shop itself, with its shelves of alluring books, that drew me in more than the taste (and this isn't saying the taste was bad, it was really delicious!)

The tastes of coffee and teas here will appeal to your taste buds different, because yes, they use quality ingredients that aren't processed or haven't been loaded down with other preservatives or extra sugars (like some other yelpers noted). It's important to keep an open mind when crossing over from your local Starbucks into an organic, vegan certified coffee shop.",5bT16QvBp6t33vIfqtJahg,2,2,4,fs8d0ebTxAPU8QTEkn8KTg

5819356,2010-07-10,0,UMqfeCItzQ2glr4d9apGlA,"I recently moved to Las Vegas from Orange County, CA. Having lived there my whole life, I had grown accustomed to fine coffee mini-chains like Peet's Coffee & Tea, Deidrich Coffee, and more recently, Kean Coffee.

The aforementioned establishments go out of their way to deliver a competitive product to consumers without insulting the tradition of coffee. Every other national chain I've ever been to utterly fails to do so.

Thus, when I moved to Las Vegas and was deprived of the local coffee shops I had come to love, I quickly set about trying to find something to replace them. Las Vegas, having the reputation that it does for fine dining, would surely have dozens of high-end coffee shops that employed a skilled barista or two... or so I thought.

I've lived here for about 6 months at the time of this writing, and Sunrise Coffee is the *only* place in this town where I can get decent coffee. On top of that, they use Klatch Coffee, roasted by a family from Southern California whose reputation I know well.

Their staff is friendly, their baristas' skills are competition-grade, and they play excellent music. Free Wi-Fi and plenty of seating and power outlets make this place a great hang-out as well.

If there's one thing I could suggest to the proud owner of Sunrise Coffee, it would be this:

Please open a store in the northwest-ish part of town! Driving 25 miles for your coffee is worth it, but getting to be quite expensive!",eIEyAIWfwo4u5gi-2SiOIA,6,5,5,9BdiN1lDcs6akTUxTQot8Q

The baristas wear smiles and appear clean and professional. I was pleased to see assurances of organic products and fair-trade practices. I'd probably rate a three or four if I hadn't ordered a drink.

I asked the barista a few questions (e.g. ""What's the difference between the espresso and traditional menus?"") but she had difficulty answering any of them. Moreover, she seemed to resent my curiosity. (My friend had a similar experience a few days earlier when he called to ask about brew methods.) Still, I ordered a mocha and paid a fair price.

My drink came out after only a short time, but such timeliness hardly helped me appreciate the barista's handiwork. The mocha was overwhelmingly sweet (they use chocolate syrup, sauce, AND powder) and I've yet to detect the flavor of espresso.

I've explored some of Seattle's and Southern California's best coffee shops, and Sunrise comes nowhere close to the worst of these. I'll choose Starbucks over Sunrise anyday.",-TqgbDujKd9RoeFlu-p-aQ,1,1,2,j5WrPWnc74wn8C1NG7MCKg

My issue is with the drive-through window. And, this is not the first time I've had this issue.

Am I wrong to expect at the drive-through will be priority service? Isn't the assumption that I'm driving through because I'm going somewhere? And therefore that I'm kind of in a hurry? If I have time to hang out, I would've come inside and eat delicious food off a real plate instead of out of a cardboard box. I'd be drinking my coffee out of a real mug, instead of out of a paper cup.

I pulled up to the window and ordered at 10:04. I pulled forward and waited. The guy came and took my payment. I waited some more. He came back a couple minutes later and gave me my coffee. I waited some more. And waited. And waited. And finally a different guy showed up and handed me my sandwich. No, ""Sorry it took so long,"" no ""I apologize for the wait."" Just ""Waiting for your food? Here.""

That was at 10:22. 18 minutes. During the normal course of my day, 18 minutes is no big deal. But sitting my car with the air conditioner on and the engine running and wasting gas, 18 minutes was enough to throw off the rest of my schedule before I had to be at my final destination.

Sunrise is cool, indeed. But perhaps, they should consider closing the drive-through window. They're certainly not meeting the expectations of what I think a drive-through window should be for. If you're going through provide drive-through service, than make it good. Otherwise you are just reduc by what should be a five star teview. 

Update June 7: last two times through, Sunrise has redeemed themselves. There is a very nice young lady working the window who is exceedingly efficient and very polite. This morning, my time through the process was three minutes and part of that was the girl asking how my day was going so far. This is a HUGE difference and what I consider an ideal way to deliver great customer service. Thanks Sunrise. You box says ""Sunrise loves you.""

It has a typical hipster vibe but isn't pretentious. It's very clean. There's comfy chairs and tables with plenty of outlets. I wish the space was bigger with more seating because it can fill fast. There's a nice pet friendly patio.

Service is usually fast and friendly. I usually get a warm and what seems like genuine greeting. They use compostable eco friendly cups. I don't mind paying a bit more for my coffee knowing the business practices utilized. 

They have a good assortment of coffee and tea. My nephews love vanilla milk/vanilla steamers. The latte art is beautiful, and part of the reason it's best to sit inside and slowly sip and savor the latte. I'm a fan of the brimstone and they have seasonal lattes year round. I tried the pistachio white mocha, pistachio flavor was weak. I prefer a bit more than a hint of flavor, but that's personal preference and I'll just ask for more next time. They, or rather sister company,mothership coffee, provides the beans. Don't forget to get a stamp card.

This place is a total fail!!! Reminds you of Austin / Seattle??? Where the heck are you from, Bellevue? This place is a bogus wannabe coffeehouse in a stripmall. You can still see the remnants for the Starbucks-esque corporate sign outside where they haven't bothered to remove it properly! Ugh.",__3Lm1VjoOK5WHL2tt4Z6w,1,0,4,yuejL-a4tBaITUpVtO2qaw

They have a killer coffee menu full of everything from Cold Brew to a seasonal Butterbeer latte. In a hurry? Head through their dive-thru and they can get you right through! Gotta love a local spot that offers an easy way to take stuff to-go without getting out of your car. 

Personally, I head into this spot for a cool locale to open my laptop and grab a bite. I reside on planet earth, but my favorite grub is their Alien Burrito. A tortilla stuffed with hummus, quinoa, beans, avocado and all the goodness. It's fresh and filling. Totally hits the spot. I'd love the option to add bacon, but this is a vegetarian spot. I can deal. 

The staff here is always super nice and full of energy. That's just what the caffeine doctor ordered when you're heading to a coffee spot.",NhgU7RhuYYFmpkb1jlYJ6Q,24,21,5,zyQ_kblJ6T6lFe8jg8G4Sg

They have a lot of different coffees and teas, and all the usual drinks you'll find in a Starbucks - both hot and cold. So far my favorite is the hazelnut latte. 

Sunrise Coffee also serves up a lot of delicious food and pastries. My favorite is the ALIEN burrito. It is out of this world! Our kids love the PB&J sandwiches. I'm also a sucker for the pumpkin muffin. 

The café itself has a very cozy interior and friendly staff. There is also a nice outdoor seating area. If you're in a hurry, relax (pun intended), they also have a drive through. 

Give this place a try, and you won't be disappointed!",K2ZoDG-9QAi5ErTAVRW8pg,0,0,5,LF3it5-_zV114YnPm9NTHA
5891115,2010-08-24,0,UMqfeCItzQ2glr4d9apGlA,"Love this place. Hands down, it's one of the best coffee shops in Vegas. The soy latte is very very good.  ""summer specialties"" are great, try the ""iced vanilla fog latte"". The place has free wi fi and has a cool vibe during weekends. I often go on sundays just to unwind while reading a good magazine/book.

edit: after more than 4 years and lots of coffee, I still think Sunrise Coffee is the best coffee shop in all of east LV. I also buy whole bean bags from the in-house roaster ""The Mothership"". The expresso blend is quite good and a great option for getting the freshest roasted coffee in the city (besides Colorado River Coffee Roasters, located in Boulder City, which takes 2-3 days to deliver by mail).",2Qc7AAk2xQhxKrD7cJ3kxg,0,0,5,ANYyZ5mh1O5mfDdj_vPwtw

5918375,2013-09-16,1,UMqfeCItzQ2glr4d9apGlA,"I came in at about 2:30 on a Friday afternoon to have coffee with a friend!  I walked in and the place was packed!  We were lucky enough to find a table.  Outside seating is also available but it was a bit hot and humid out this day.   The coffee is organic and is roasted in house and tastes wonderful.  I love the idea that they are environmentally conscious and offer their coffee in a mug if you are not taking it to go!  However the blended drinks come in a plastic cup but even that is made from recyclable material and is compostable.  

My friend ordered the Mint Mocha Coffee and I ordered the Caramel Frappe both with non-fat milk, of course!.  My friend said that her coffee was the perfect blend of mint, mocha and coffee and she was really impressed!  I loved the Caramel Frappe!  Perfectly blended to a great consistency that did melt super fast!  The drink had just the right amount of sweetness and quenched my caramel hankering.  

There was a sign stating that there was going to be music here that evening.  I'm guessing that this is a common occurrence here.  

They also have a nice collection of books if you would like to sit and read.  

We were here for about 2.5 hours and with the amount of people that were here the entire time I truly believe that this place either needs to expand or open another location.  It was also hot in there or they were having AC issues or maybe a tactic to keep people from staying to long.  :)

5918705,2010-08-19,2,UMqfeCItzQ2glr4d9apGlA,"I am rarely on the SE side of Las Vegas, thus rarely gets to visit or review any businesses in the area.  But Aug 17, 2010 was one of those rare days when I get to explore the SE side of Las Vegas.  
After ramen at Yokohama Kaigenro, then a brief stop at Seafood City, we eventually ended up here at Sunrise Coffee. From the outside it didn't look very impressive. However, that changed immediately after opening the door and stepping into this coffee house with a warm and inviting aura.

The lady behind the counter was patient and cheerful in helping answer questions for us first timers.  I ended up ordering their Superfruit Antiox ($4.45), and it was simply tasty and very refreshing. It definitely hit the spot on another 100+F day in Vegas. If you Yelp or check out Yelp reviews, you will undoubtedly also see their promotion for a free traditional cappuccino (2 oz. espresso, 2 oz. milk, 2 oz. foam, but their version is larger and served in an 8 oz cup), as long as you show them your UNLV student ID. This promotion is for Aug 2010, and I am sure they will have something else for each month of the year.  If you are into latte art, they do that too, even on the free cup of cappuccino.

The decoration is cheerful, and some of the walls are adorned with art works from local artists, just like at many coffee houses across the country.  They also have a bookshelf full of books (ranging from techie books, aka A+ Study Guide, to various genres of novels), perfect for relaxing with some light reading material while enjoying a cup of joe or other tasty beverages.

They also serve sweets, like danishes and cookies, which are $1 after 4pm (if I remember it correctly). But usually by that time of day, their selections are rather scarce (because their is only 1 cookie and 1 danish left when we arrived).

While I was here with another Yelper, there was a decent group of ladies of varying ages + 1 man, who was part of a knitting club.  It was cool to see that groups like that have a nice neighborhood hangout to meet at and enjoy their activities, and shooting the breeze.

I give this cool coffee house a 4 stars for the friendly service, cool inviting ambiance, tasty beverages.  I too wish they can xerox themself to another location in the SW, so I don't have to make quite the  pilgrimage to enjoy the atmosphere and refreshing beverage.",RQlnSCjuqMnhR3Qk6j4KoA,5,3,4,DmHyN38fVg_6guwh1gFVDw

They also give away free stuff and give discounts if you're lucky to catch the announcement on their Facebook page. Friendly and hip. My only complaint is that they play the music a little loud sometimes. It is good music typically though. Also, they need a bigger shop.

Needless to say as a San Franciscan I was skeptical but Sunrise uses bold flavored beans in their espresso drinks and the finished product is quite tasty.

It's a quaint little hipster joint in the middle of nowhere on Sunset but it's well worth the trek cause let's be honest, no one lives around where it's located.  The menu offers plenty of options for coffee beverages and foods. They are able to make most items regular, vegetarian, or vegan. So everybody wins!

The alien burrito is seriously addicting. Coming from a meat and rice girl, I love this dish and am fully satisfied with everything in it. It's just deliciousness wrapped up in a red or green tortilla.

This place has spoiled me though. Because their lattes are so good, it's hard to order a latte elsewhere now because you know it just won't be as good as the Sunrise lattes.

So if you're in the area and want some yummy coffee or food, or even if you aren't, Sunrise Coffee won't disappoint.",V93YZAMFAF4eejiIPRs0zw,0,0,5,LjHTDTj0XBaTfZ6BvGtPaQ
