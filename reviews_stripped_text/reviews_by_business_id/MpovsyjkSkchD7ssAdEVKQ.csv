167762,2009-07-03,0,MpovsyjkSkchD7ssAdEVKQ,"This was a huge and bitter disappointment.
The ambiance was darker than I prefer, but understandable for the effect the restaurant is aiming for.  The waiter made a subtle hint at tipping by  stating his helper and he work ""as a team.""  I didn't appreciate that.  
All items on menu are al a carte - not an issue.
The salad was good, as was the freshly baked  bread(s).
My guest &amp; I both ordered the rib eye steak - med. rare.  Sides were yukon gold potato puree, and grilled onions with wild mushrooms.
The steaks and the sides arrived at the table lukewarm - and I like my food HOT.  The steaks were about 30% fat.  I mentioned both the  temperature and the fat to the waiter.  He tried to convince me the fat content was normal.  To be fair, he did offer to have another steak cooked for me - I declined.  I know wild mushrooms are supposed to have an ""earthy"" taste - but not supposed to have actual earth in them.  They were gritty.
The dinner ended up costing $200. without drinks or wine.
I can duplicate the menu at home for a quarter of the cost and it would be far superior.  
The cook should have a serious talk with his kitchen staff and wait staff on getting food to the table hot and without dirt in it.
I do not recommend this to anyone who has a good idea of decent ""steak restaurant"" food.",llGAONe4UfhzfascT-I72A,1,0,1,Kj0TP_mDpZ0Nj9G7AkI-7A

179639,2010-07-20,0,MpovsyjkSkchD7ssAdEVKQ,"I came across this restaurant because I was actually interested in Mr. Charlie Palmer's other restaurant, Aureole, at the Mandalay Bay after seeing him guest judge on TOP CHEF, where he gave the challenge of pairing pinot and pigs for one of his annual events.

I noticed that Charlie Palmer Steak was having a summer promotion, 3 course dinner + unlimited wine pairing for $48.00.  Every week, they have a new cut of meat.  I made the dinner reservations for a party of 5 about a  week in advance and on the night of the feast, I'm proud to say we were all blown away!  The ambiance was modern but with a twist.  Dim candle lit room for a romantic unforgettable moment type of vibe but well balanced with the dark wood for a touch of masculinity.  

We were sat promptly after checking in.  Every girl had a waiter to help pull out our chairs.  We were served bottled Fiji water and had deliciously warmed varieties of breads.  There were cornbread, sourdough, french, and wheat rolls.  I loved how when someone from  our table got up, a waiter would come and fetch our current table napkin and replace it completely with a brand new one.  No empty water or wine glass.  Every time it started to get low, there was an immediate refill.  They're so Ninja!  

We started of which their cheese platter.  It had 3 different types of cheese that I cannot remember but it was served with seedless sliced red grapes and bits of honey comb.  I loved the sweetness of the honey it played on the cheese.  It was accompanied by warm and fluffy brioche.  For our 3 course dinner, we started off with a watermelon salad.  It had a mild goat milk cheese and a balsamic dressing.  It was light and refreshing.  Our meat of the week was a grill New York steak.  It was cooked to perfection.  No one had any complaints about their steaks.  For the sides, it was served family styled.  We had grilled baby asparagus and oven roasted fingerling potatoes.  It was a satisfying meal.  On top of that, we had the most knowledgable and nice sommelier.  He was very generous with each and every pouring.  He also took the time to walk around the table to give us a breif description of each wine.  I think our table alone, help finished a couple of bottles.  For our last course, we had a chocolate covered hazelnut creme.  On the side, they threw in homemade chocolate chip cookie ice cream sandwiches for us.  I felt soo special that night.

Everything about this place, from the food to the service and the decor has definitely surpassed my expections.  It's no wonder Charlie Palmer is who he is with soo many great accolades.  He deserves it and I'm just happy to have tried his food.",bJ7BUQoUiC7vgOICe_49-g,5,2,5,HKWyewIBIFeQQRHNf7njMg

207471,2011-02-16,0,MpovsyjkSkchD7ssAdEVKQ,"My fiancé and I came here for Valentine's Day. When we first arrived, I was blown away by the hotel and the decor was amazing. We walked in, and were ignored by the hostess for a minute or two while she reorganized her menus.

Once we were seated, a waiter (waiter #1) came to take our drink orders. We ordered water and requested a wine menu, which was brought by a different waiter (waiter #2) who offered to help us with the wine selection. 10 minutes later, we got the water, and 15 minutes after that we got the wine.

Another different waiter (waiter #3) then brought us bread, but we realized we only had one bread plate. Our first waiter walked by, so we asked for a second bread plate, but he took the one we had and gave us a different one, so we were still left with only one plate. He also asked if we would like to order any wine, but we let him know that waiter #2 already took our wine order.

We requested a second plate again from waiter #4, who correctly brought a second plate.

Our food was then delivered, and it was fantastic. I had the surf and turf; the lobster was very flavorful and cooked to perfection. The steak was a little rare for my liking; I ordered it medium rare, but it was closer to rare-rare plus. My fiance ordered the bone-in rib eye, and he loved it. 

After we were finished, waiter #4 cleared our plates and brought us the check. We put in the credit card, and waiter #1 came to ask us if we wanted dessert or our bill. We gave him the bill that we had received from waiter #4 to cash.

Overall the food was great, but the service was sub par for a restaurant of this quality. For the price, it was not worth it.",PdFhAPZZpbJ-AxVTKyEW0A,1,0,2,61P10Ovku9Kq47Um5H7YaA

I ordered the surf and turf. The lobster was ok. But the filet mignon was completely dry. I had even asked for them to cook it medium, and the meat was no where near pink inside nor was it tender or juicy; it was pretty much well done. 

The only thing I would say that I did enjoy here was the mashed potatoes and the bruseel sprouts as the sides. But I mean you can never go wrong with adding truffle oil into mashed potatoes, it makes everything 10x better.

244869,2011-10-05,0,MpovsyjkSkchD7ssAdEVKQ,"Upon a recommendation we started our meal with Charlie's unique Caesar salad. Three hearts of romaine were rapped with Serrano ham, the tastiest white anchovies I have ever had, and then dressed with a homemade Caesar dressing and croutons. This was hands-down the best Caesar I have had. While we were eating out salad, the drunk guy at the table next to us advised us to order these ""hatch chili peppers"", which are apparently a rare pepper only found in New Mexico and have the tendency to only be good two months out of the year. I am glad we listened to him because these grilled hatch peppers were amazing. They had a delicate flavor with a thin crisp skin. Some of the bites were spicier than others but the taste was similar to an Anaheim pepper mixed with a Serrano - fantastic. I ordered the 20 oz. New York strip steak and my friends ordered the Porterhouse and Hanger steak. All the steaks were prime cuts of Omaha beef, perfectly seasoned with coarse salt and pepper and then scorched under the broiler. Each steak had a nice crust and some grill marks, but wasn't over powered with char or that grilled taste. My NY strip was sheer perfection. The two-inch thick hunk of meat was melt-in-your-mouth tender, and just had the most amazing after taste.

We also ordered the sautéed spinach and Yukon gold puree for sides. The mash potatoes were very good but lacked a bit of salt. The spinach was perfectly executed. It was cooked beautifully, having seasonings that nicely accompanied the leafy taste, while not having any bitterness what so ever. The spinach was definitely the best rendering of the boring vegetable I have ever had.

All in all, we could not have been more impressed by Charlie Palmer Steak. The steak was probably the best I have tasted while the appetizers and sides made the meal even more memorable.",lL4sVOfmnrrwUDYW9lAilw,0,0,5,L4IaaPvW_pQcPXDX-u9AOw

One of my buddies made reservations at CPS based on a recommendation from a colleague.

We were seated promptly as we entered, and our drink waiter was quick to take our order.

After some perusal of the menu we decided to skip the appetizers and go right for the main course. They did bring out a selection of breads all which were very good, my favorite being the cornbread.

I ordered a bone in rib eye, our table shared sauteed spinach, crispy fingerling potato, pureed potatoes and broccoli rabe.
I also ordered a side of fondue bleu cheese for my steak.

The food was delicious and immaculately prepared, the steak was very flavorful and the reduction sauce they ladled over it was perfect.

I then had the peanut butter bar dessert and they also gave a complimentry apple spice cake(I may have this wrong it was some type of cake with apple slices in it as garnish) with my friends coffee, both were delicious.

I still rank craftsteak as the best meal I have ever had but CPS comes in the top 5.

This place is meant to be enjoyed and if you get are able to get out of here in under 2 hours you are doing yourself a disservice. The service is beyond amazing and the waiters and sommelier were kind and informative. Even though we had a late reservation and were there until closing we never felt rushed. 

The cold seafood platter is amazing. Everything was prepared perfectly and the red pepper aoli is to die for. I'm not normally a dessert person but the mint ice cream sandwich is amazing. The mint is a true to taste herb mint (not the fake mint flavored ice cream you get from the supermarket) and the dark chocolate crisp went perfectly with the port we ordered.

It has in intimate dining room and above all no kitchen in the dining room.  On our last visit which was Saturday night we noticed a delightful improvement in the overall attention with not only our waiter, wine steward but also the manager, Kirk Perry.  He came over to our table at the beginning of our meal and introduced himself to us and said he would be overseeing every aspect of our dining experience. He checked back with us throughout our meal.   Both my husband and I were so impressed with his caring, professionalism  and above all, personal attention to every detail that evening.  It was my husband's 80th birthday and we were so satisfied that we decided to go here for this very special occasion.  

The food was elegantly presented, the timing perfect and above all delicious.  We like to take advantage of the Cut of the Week which is a pre-fix menu with wine.  The price at $48. is a bargain.  We get a notice in our E-Mail each Monday so we know what they are offering for this week.  I found out that they also have another pre-fix dinner called Tribute To Michael Jackson for $49.

First of all, the wine steward was pompous and literally dribbled red wine all over the white tablecloth as he poured.  Didn't tell us what the wine was so I had to ask the bus boy as he came around clearing plates.  Now with Cut of the Week you also get a wine pairing - had to ask for more wine and the steward acted like he was definitely bothered.  The food was not good - steak very tough (Petite New York), the 'purple' smashed potatoes looked like they were from a newborn baby....greenish in color (get the drift?) The meals came out at different times and the waiter came out with a smart remark telling me that he only had 'two hands'!  Very rude service and poor food.  Now, I know that Charlie Palmer has a good reputation in some circles but at this particular rest in Vegas he should take his name off the list!  So, so looked forward to going there and was soooooooo very disappointed when I left.  Not one for my books in the future!  Of course, do they care --- hell no!  We'll never be back - so be it!   Plenty of people will with millions going to Vegas annually.  That is the problem with 'celebrity chef' restaurants - there are many and they lure people in with their name, good, bad or indifferent.  I've not been to one yet that really makes my day.

I was surprised to find that they had two prix fix menus that were beyond reasonable for a steakhouse!  They have the Cut of the Week where it's a set menu that includes a starter, ""cut of the week"", two sides and dessert.  However, I went with the Tribute to Michael Jackson option because it gave a bit of flexibility - there were two or three choices for each course. This was a few weeks ago, but both options were $48 or $49.  I believe the Cut of the Week came with wine pairings, making it even more economical but I wasn't in the mood for wine that night.  Anyway, I opted for a delicious salad, bone-in filet mignon and  hazelnut chocolate bar.  The salad was your basic bibb lettuce salad with a nice light, not too thick, ranch dressing and bacon - nuff said.  The filet was deliciously charred and cooked to perfection.  If you like Nutella, you will love the dessert.  I had to force myself to stick to my ""leave something on the plate"" rule.  It was soooo decadent.

Took the groom to be here for a bachelor party dinner and we had the time of our lives.  Kudos to the classy and unparalleled service provided by the entire staff here. 

It was memorable and everyone had a great time. Since this was the most important event for the groom I was thrilled that everyone enjoyed themselves.

The waiter was awesome and helped us work through a dietary restriction/substitution and the Sommelier was great. Would definitely come again. wonderful dinner, great company, great staff, great ambiance.

its off the strip a bit but it is 110% worth it.

549509,2011-11-09,0,MpovsyjkSkchD7ssAdEVKQ,"I was here with bunch of friends for a weekend out at the Sin City.  My friend was able to find a deal on a ""Cut of the Week"" prix fixe menu that was going for about $50 with unlimited wine to boot.  The meal came with bread, salad, and 3 side dishes (including asparagus, potatoes au gratin, sauteed mushrooms) and skirt steak as the meat of the week.  It also included unlimited pairing with 2 selected wines (1 white and 1 red).  Granted I'm not a huge foodie and my palate is not as discerning as some, but the meal was fantastic and even a better value.  The meat portion was huge, but most of us still managed to devour it all, it was so good, perfectly seasoned and cooked med rare.  The side dishes were also very good, though slightly on the salty side.  But $48 at Charlie Palmer??!!  with liquor??  The ambiance is very upscale and service is very attentive, worthy of a high end steak restaurant.  I'd highly recommend this place for a great meal in a cozy, upscale environment which is both suitable for a date or bunch of drunk friends (ok ok you still should at least wear a button-up shirt and have closed toe shoes).",HfhbTGKRejV-YVcsGkuGLw,0,0,5,WHuGTx2HYXbTO4HBPXGN5g

557662,2015-08-14,0,MpovsyjkSkchD7ssAdEVKQ,"Spent the night at the newly renovated Delano hotel and was looking for good steak before my flight in the morning.  After much research, I opted for Charlie Palmer Steak House at the Four Seasons Hotel.  First I am glad that this restaurant has a full menu bar which allowed me to eat without sitting at a table for one lol.  The bartender recommended a Mai-Tai to start which I enjoyed and had  two for the night.  For appetizer I ordered the Citrus marinated wild Baja prawns which if I paid more attention to the menu, I would not have ordered it since it was a cocktail shrimp.  Thought it would have been cooked in a citrus sauce so not what I expected but decent...why such beautiful prawns are cocktails is beyond me.  The bartender did not charge me for the prawns after I explained my disappointment but not due their fault but mine and I ate only 1-1/2 shrimp out of 5-6 provided.  The Main course per recommendation from the bartender was the bone-in Rib-Eye and an add-On of half a lobster for an additional $25.  The steak was cooked to perfection of medium rare with, as expected, rare near the bone.  The steak was well marbled and as stated earlier perfectly cooked.  Now the flavor was...I was not blown away.  The seasoning was not spectacular and I should have ordered a bernaise sauce of truffle butter to supplement the flavor.  I love the steak seasoning from Cattlemans of Indian Cliff in El Paso Texas, they know how to flavor a steak.  The lobster on the other hand was delicious and wished I ordered the 2lb lobster instead but this is a steak house and steak will be the main course.  For dessert, again recommended by the bartender, I had the coconut tres leche  can.  I like the cake, being I am a Hawaiian boy, which was moist with freshness if the thinly sliced strawberries, Crispy coconut flakes, a mild mouse, a strawberry sauce, and a dallop of coconut ice cream.  Many ingredients that combined to pleasant dessert.  

-Atmosphere/ambiance, beautiful restaurant in a beautiful hotel 5

-Service, I had the bartender who was on point 5

-Food, being I had high expectations due to advertisement as best steak house after only 4 months opened, I have to give this restaurant a 3.  I enjoyed the lobster and dessert but I wanted to be WoW'd by the steak and I wasn't.

I wish I could award a half star for 3-1/5 stars but I just wasn't WoW'd.  By far, the Cattlemans at Indian Cliff s a far better steak house, granted I did not eat the $35 and once Kobe beef but that's beyond my budget.

Total cost $138 for the meal with a $50 tip since they comp my appetizers.",Wzy2ZFexKxFPqFk7AMy52Q,1,0,3,7ZGxaVLIp4Y55JTe5ttqgg
597200,2015-06-21,1,MpovsyjkSkchD7ssAdEVKQ,"This was one of the most overrated restaurants I have ever eaten ate.  My husband and I love a good steak; and had the fortune of living in NYC for years and getting to eat at all the best steakhouses. If this one was in NYC I don't think it would stay in business long. We were at The Four Seasons for a 3 night mini vacation. We decided to go here on our last night. The prior nights we went to Aureole (excellent) and Verandah next door - also excellent. This one fell flat from the start. The biggest thing was the service. They have the typical steakhouse multiple servers - and they were so slow tending to our needs that I almost got up and poured our own champagne from the bottle we ordered. To start; my husband has the raw tuna and I had oysters - both were the highlight of the meal; and excellent, but of course involved very little preparation. For dinner I had the filet and my husband had the bone-in New York Strip. My husband's was above average; the filet was below average. 

When the bill came there was no pen so we had to ask the host for one (we wanted to charge it to our room). He made a big deal about wanting to verify that we were actually staying the hotel. If that was the the only weird thing I'd be OK. But they also made a big deal wanting to verify the champagne we ordered. Together, that was classless.

The only defense I have for the restaurant was that it was restaurant week and the place was packed with people ordering the $50 prix fix. The couple beside us ranted and raved about their steak and told the waiter its so good, we never get to do this, the only place we go out for dinner is Burger King. If Burger King is your normal restaurant, then this place is probably good. If you are going for fine dining, I'd take a pass. If you want to try a Charlie Palmer restaurant; aureole is 1000 times better.",PLuiwU7Strc-VVs4psyoPQ,2,0,2,bYjf0YBM9-GIhR6FnGCt1A

Overall I have to say I left somewhat disappointed.  The service was not at the level one would expect for a steakhouse in the Four Seasons, and quite frankly even for a steakhouse in Las Vegas.  It took very long to get the waiter to come over once we had been seated.  The waiter, although apologetic about the delay was not really very informative about the menu, acting pretty much as a note taker as we told him what we wanted.  After the meal nobody took our dishes away for enough time that we needed to flag down another table's waiter to get it done for us.  He was NOT very happy about it, and made a LOT of noise with our dishes as he cleared the table.  (Perhaps a small hissy fit)?
Steak was very good, potato au gratin may have been  Stouffers frozen.  
The Sommelier was very helpful and knowledgeable and helped pick a great wine that was very reasonably priced for the quality.  A bright spot in an otherwise underwhelming and average dining experience.  If it was Outback Steakhouse then OK, but not for Charlie Palmer's.

I was here while on my bachelor party this past Saturday. We chose Charlie Palmer's because they had the Cut of the Week deal for some of my cost conscious friends. Out of 7 of us,  4 ordered a la carte, while 3 got the Cut of the Week. 

The food was all excellent. As far as the steak,  the quality of the meat and the preparation were as good as any I've had. The appetizers and sides were all very enjoyable. 

The kitchen also accommodated a change to the Cut of the Week deal, which, to be honest, no one expected. It was a welcome surprise. Also, at the end of the meal the kitchen sent out two complimentary deserts for the table, which was a really nice touch. 

The half-star only comes off because of slight service issues. Other than that it was a great meal and a high-quality steakhouse.",lo5FaEr3lKgPbu4wbmSoeA,0,0,4,uM4ASACUXlZDsIW09VZs2A

781178,2009-06-08,1,MpovsyjkSkchD7ssAdEVKQ,"Sadly, the steak was disappointing! 

So we were in vegas for a quick trip and wanted desperately to go to The SW Steakhouse. We tried making last minute reservations but they only had 5pm and 10pm available and since we didn't want to eat with the blue haired patrons or eat with the wait staff, we decided to explore our options. 

Cut also only had a 5:15pm available and Carnevino had no openings... so I went down my steakhouse list and found Charlie Palmer Steakhouse. Anticipating a booked night, I still called and was surprised by how many openings they had. I originally asked for 8pm and then changed it later to 7pm and with each call, there was a ""sure no problem""... All of this should have been a precursor to our meal. 

My steak preferences are as follows:
I like when steak is seared with a crust and then finished in a really HOT oven. I like when steak is seasoned with a bit of salt and pepper prior to being cooked. Good steak should never be covered in a sauce. Finally, I like when they take out a really hot steak and finish it with a little bit of butter. Is that too much to ask? 

Well the steak that I ordered at CP did not have any of the above. In fact they poured a wine reduction that they called a ""jus"" and it lacked all taste. 

I would never go back...",_msI30l45R5-jWxVqR4eIw,0,0,2,d_xrn51Gbz7gcJDsdV8Wfw

I thought wine was included, but when the wine didn't come, I thought I had read the menu wrong.  No, after reading the yelps here, I missed out.  For a restaurant of this caliber, that shouldn't happen.  I'm all for a relaxing dinner, but the dining room wasn't slammed and dinner dragged on.

A bread basket was delivered to the table.  We devoured the warm corn bread and asked for more.

Caesar salad with prosciutto and and anchovies was one of my favorite courses.  It was a good-sized portion and since I had already ate a piece of cornbread I was good.

Main course was Kobe style skirt steak w/mushrooms and chimichurri.  Mushrooms were delicious and chimichurri was very tasty.  I could have used a vat of that chimichurri.  I know a skirt steak isn't as tender as a filet, but I had to fight it with my non-serrated knife to cut it into polite size pieces.  Fortunately, I did keep the steak from flying off the plate.  Now that I'm typing up this review, I should have sent it back.  Sorry, Charlie.  

Sides were better than the steak.  I had fries and beans amandine.  Fries were still crispy at the end of dinner. 

Dessert was a butterscotch bundt cake w/carmelized bananas and ice cream.  The bananas and ice cream were good.  Bundt cake was underwhelming in texture and flavor, and could have been more moist.  

The restaurant also provided a plate of ice cream sandwiches for the table.

This was my second dining experience at Charlie Palmer Steak and the food did not let down.  I started off with the butter poached Alaskan King Crab Spaghettini.  Simply put: outstanding.  The noodles were cooked perfectly, crab did not have that sometimes-salty seawater flavor - instead it blended perfectly with the sauce (which was not overly added).

For my main course I chose the dry aged 14 oz bone in New York strip.  The steak was cooked/seasoned perfectly and loaded with flavor.

Dessert I opted for a molten chocolate soufflé with a side of Gran Mariner sauce.  Again, the dessert was made perfectly and the complimentary ice cream cookies were an added bonus.

As for the food, I cannot say anything bad at all.  This would easily be a 5-star review if it were not for the service.  Our server, who complained loudly to the hostess about being overworked, sat us down and stated ""I will bring bread over immediately"".   His version of immediately meant us asking three different servers for bread and another server twice for drinks.  After our server took our order, we again had to ask multiple servers for drinks and we did not see our server until after our main courses came out.  The last part of the lack of service came when one member of our group noticed that her steak was overcooked (there was no doubt about it as the dryness of her steak could be observed visually without even cutting into it).  She asked for a second steak - no problem was the response.  However, some random server came out and proceeded to tell her that the lighting gave the steak the impression that it was overcooked - even though she took a bite and saw that it there was no red (she ordered medium rare) in the entire steak.

Again, Charlie Palmer steak - 5 stars for the food.  The lack of quality service knocks it down only 1 star because the food was so good.  Highly recommended.  Can't forget that the live band took my request and played it!",astxDnsj9c_R7A1wSFpFxw,1,0,4,yUdDIZE8ZLDlPlpJn8kd2Q

     This visit was immediately dampened by an unfriendly greeting from the hostess who marched us to a side alcove table away from the main dining room.  Because this area was a little dark they had a big screen video on the wall above our table, which created an unpleasant and garish atmosphere.  We said ""no way"" and she then showed us to a similarly dismal table for two near the bar with my view being a blank wall, again not in the main dining area.  We were not happy and her only response was ""We are bought out tonight and nothing else available"".  OK, what was my reservation all about?

Within 5 minutes they had cleaned another nice table in the main dining area and we were moved.  All was well again.  I do think it is a lame excuse to say ""We are so busy tonight--so many convention reservations--blah, blah, blah"".  Hey, you are in the restaurant business; treat all of your customers as friends and guests to be successful.

However, additional patrons arrived toward the end of our meal.

A variety of breads were delivered to our table and our drink order was finally taken, but we still had not seen a menu. We grew impatient so I dug into the bread, sure enough that's when our waiter appeared with menus in hand.

We opted to start with citrus prawn cocktail and Caesar bib salad. We selected Filet Mignon and Veal Delmonico as our entrees and chose to share a side of Parmesan potato gratin. We devoured the basket of delicious breads while we waited. The corn bread was particularly notable.

Our appetizers were excellent. The filet was prepared with roasted shallot jus. The Delmonico was served with peppercorn sauce. Both were flavorful and tender. Although, as a matter of personal preference, we rather have sauces served on the side. The potatoes were outstanding; a crisp crust formed across the top and the inside was rich and creamy.

Our bill came to $146. In the end, service was sufficient, but I'd expect a higher caliber from Charlie Palmer and the Four Seasons. Nonetheless, it was a fine meal.",ZsUSGU1-L1ImomLZjXxxTg,2,0,3,zcBc083gI2f6CvOldKfDng

I have been to one other Charlie Palmer Restaurant and had a good experience and therefore thought that the quality of food at the steakhouse would be just as good.  I am a local Las Vegas attorney and routinely frequent many of the higher end steakhouses in the Las Vegas valley including Del Frisco's, STK at the Cosmopolitan, The Capital Grille, etc.  The prices at the Charlie Palmer's Steakhouse were comparable to other high end steakhouses and hence I expected that the quality would be on par.  I ordered the 40 oz Tomahawk Bone-In Ribeye which cost $110 (not including side dishes). The steak had very little marbling and was overcooked.  Put simply, the steak lacked flavor.  Moreover, at no time did the waiter ask me about the quality of my cut, which for a high end steakhouse is unusual.   Perhaps, the chef that night was having an ""off night"" but I am unlikely to return to Charlie Palmer Steakhouse.",Hy7kJ7LVF98CS49mQ5Fz2w,0,0,2,f56uT3qOMSJGY_GEWevHCw

I booked a table just for myself during a business trip. Got there a few minutes ahead of schedule and the hostess tried to seat me at the bar (""are you sure you want a table?""). Yes, I want a table to eat properly!

Finally got a table, towards the back of the restaurant in an area that they were setting up with more tables. Felt like they seated me in the middle of the backstage.

I went for the prix fixe menu: salad, 16Oz steak with sauce and two sides and desert. All with bottomless wine pairing. I asked for the dressing to be on the side and no sauce on the steak. I thought the waiter was about to scream and kick me out. He clearly did not like special requests...

Anyways, the food came out and was great. The somelier was kind and explained his wine choices.

Not super affordable but what good steakhouse is, so this was expected and would have been fine if they held up their end.  There were seven of us and we wanted to have a nice dinning experience.  The waiter was not the worst waiter ever,  he just didn't seem all that interested in our satisfaction, when one of the servers brought the wrong entree he had to check with the waiter who was standing about fifteen feet from our table,  without acknowledging error or apologizing he checked his computer screen and redirected the server.  My steak was not good and not terrible but at these prices it should be excellent or at least good. We asked for more bread and after a while had to ask again before it was delivered.   I could also see the waiter  ""marrying wine bottles"" at his station in the dinning room ,  not very classy,  (not to mention not legal in some places). The soup was very good.  Basically  just not the fine dinning one would expect from a place in this location with these prices. 
I expected to return for another try at this place but haven't had the time so let me say that after writing my review I was contacted by management and they were very interested in making things right.

Our waiter was animatronic with his delivery. We heard his same uninspired delivery with other diners. When he took our order he at least had a disingenuous smile; until we passed on appetizers. We didn't see him again until we were done eating and had to ask someone to find him so we could get our check. We were going to have desert but gave up 20 minutes after dinner. He finally came back with a butterscotch creme brûlée with nothing on it as a gift for our anniversary (free but not good). And now that it was tip time he was a new man. Totally transparent.

And that is their Cut of the Week menu, which serves a salad, meat dish, 2 side dishes, a dessert, and unlimited wine (1 red, 1 white) for about $50.

I think everything was pretty tasty, except for the steak, unfortunately. It tasted dried and overcooked, even though I asked for medium-rare. Kind of unfortunate as I really wanted to like the place. I can't help but wonder whether all their steaks are the same quality as what I had, or how much more better their regular steaks may be... But maybe I shouldn't be complaining for the price I paid. The service was good, and the place was not crowded on a Saturday night. I still have to give the place kudos for offering such a great deal in an city bent on squeezing every last penny out of you.

No need to follow trends, and do what so many chefs do, make a chain and quality goes out the door. While CPS is in a few other cities in America, it feels like a one of a kind, that listens to their base clientele.  going for loyalty, rather than assumed market demands for something else. Chef Steve is super talented, the Soms, the server, and full staff are a flawless orchestration of what needs to come back to Vegas. It is located in the Four Seasons, and somewhat hidden, it is a gem that sparkles once found. The lighting is perfect, romantic even, and sets the tone. I don't even feel like I am in Las Vegas when I'm there. I feel like I am in a true resort, somewhere on the coast of California.  This place hasn't lasted 16 years just because they have steak.  They have the BEST steaks in all of Vegas and Charlie Palmer keeps to his roots and identity as a chef, and my dining experience reflects that. Our server stated he had been there 16 years and looked as happy and proud of his work. Please go!!!! You will feel like a VIP and the only table in the house, they treat you well!

1219524,2012-08-07,0,MpovsyjkSkchD7ssAdEVKQ,"I ate at Charlie Palmer with my boyfriend a couple of weeks ago in July on our last night in Vegas for our date night dinner without the rest of the group. We loved it!! We had booked a reservation and planned on having the ""cut of the week"" prix fixe menu. We were happily surprised to find out that the entree was actually lamb (the description of the prix fixe menu says each week the chef selects a 'unique cut of beef' so we were expecting beef). It was my first time eating lamb so I was happy to try it out. 
The atmosphere was very nice. I personally love very dark, dimily-lit atmospheres for dinner, and this was the perfect level of subtle lighting that gave it an intimate and warm ambiance. That really has an impact on the whole meal experience for me. 
The prix fixe meal comes with 'bottomless' wine, a white that comes with the salad, and then a red that comes with the entree. The white that came was a blend of some sort, I can't remember exactly, but I believe something blended with a pinot gris. We definitely liked it. It was refreshing, on the dry side but not overwhelmingly so. I tend to prefer slightly sweeter wines, and I ordered a glass of the Reisling that was available in a glass from another server who was not our main server (in addition to the white) since I thought it would probably be less dry than the white we had. I felt sort of bad ordering a glass of a different white wine in addition to the white that was served to us, so I explained to him that I definitely enjoyed the white we had but also wanted to try their Reisling as well. He was totally understanding of this and didn't act as if it was a stupid request. They also brought a bread basket that had a few different types of warm fresh-tasting bread. Very good, but didn't want to fill up too much and ruin the dinner. The salad was tasty and its presentation was nice. It was basically a round slice cut from a head of iceberg lettuce sitting flat on the plate, dressed with a creamy greek dressing and veggies on top. It had a nice balance of the dressing to crisp veggies and lettuce. Very good palate awakener. 
The entree was delicious! I loved the lamb! My first time ever trying it and I was very pleased. It was moist and cooked perfectly. The sides were also great! Our sides that night were Israeli couscous and ratatouille. Wow! They were both delicious. The couscous was moist and flavorful and the ratatouille was very flavorful and fresh tasting. The 2 sides complemented eachother very nicely--the creaminess of the couscous with the freshness of the ratatouille. They did bring us the red wine with the entree but I personally can't really handle drinking red wine unless it's organic/sulfite free because of headaches, so I drank very little of it just to try it out. 
Well, we were both stuffed by the end of the meal and I didn't finish my entree. I probably ate about half the lamb portion and I was FULL. Also, the sides were more than enough to satisfy both of us and there was still some leftover that we just couldn't eat. 
The dessert was the perfect way to end the meal--it was a tiny but flavor-packed lemon tart with a dollop of frozen greek yogurt. Definitely cleansed the palate and left a sweet but fresh taste in my mouth. Great way to round out a delicious dinner. 
The food was fab, and the atmosphere made this a meal to remember!! And at the price of $48.00 per person, (*especially in Vegas!*) this was a great value for the quality of the food and service we received! Charlie Palmer definitely delivered!",DN-oiyosdtx2KKrrF6x4Kg,2,0,4,mEBHi0sIogpQouhXRriF1A

We had to take the Deuce to Mandalay Bay just to eat here, which we didn't mind since we got the chance to explore different hotels and visit the Shark Reef. 

We ordered the Porterhouse to share, along with wild mushrooms and bone marrow. The prices were decent, but the steak was definitely not as tender as CraftSteak. Too bad we ate at CraftSteak the day before, or we would have been more impressed.

We ordered Vanilla Cheesecake for dessert, and it could have been richer, but I guess that's up to your personal preference. 

It was also my first time trying bone marrow - it really didn't taste like anything. Maybe the pepper covering it overpowered the original taste, I just don't think it's worth it to pay almost $10 for the little bits I scraped off.

This year's menu included chilled pea soup with crab, burrata and tomato salad, Wagyu steak with poached egg/bone marrow fried rice, mashed potatoes and veggies, and white chocolate cheesecake with candied hazelnuts. I loved the soup, which was both delicate and hearty, and the burrata was fresh and tasty. My husband was a huge fan of the fried rice, but because I HATE poached eggs, I took a few small bites and was done. Although we both ordered our steaks medium rare, mine was a little tough. And while I thought the dessert was good, my husband proclaimed it one of the best he's ever eaten -- if only there were a few more of the candied hazelnuts. (Again, I'm not a big fan of cheesecake, so I'm not the best judge.) 

Although the food was great, the real draw is the unlimited wine pairing. We each had several glasses of the red and a bit of the white. The staff was attentive and not stingy on the refills, which is always a plus when it's ""all you can drink.""

For dessert, my husband had the fresh berries (generous serving) with crème fraiche, and I had the classic crème brulee.  

The olive bread that is served before the meal is very good.  There are pieces of moist olives in the bread, each bite having a pop of the briney olive.

Unfortunately, the $60 bone in rib eye was a huge disappointment.    There were a handful of good bites but not the thick steak and big bone that I normally get from a good steak house but more like a Kroger steak.

Upon entering the dining room, the vibe did not change much.  It was relaxed for an upscale steakhouse.  I loved it...

Service...excellent!  The second time my wife and I went here, we asked the server what his favorite side dish was...he stated that it was the gratin potatoes.  At the end of our meal, he offered a side of the gratin potatoes to go and ON THE HOUSE!  What??!!  I've never heard of that happening before!

Food and beverage...The first time I went here, I ordered the filet with blue cheese over it.  Steak was good, but too much blue cheese.  The second time I went, I opted for the rib-eye with bernaise.  It was awesome!  The wine list is ridiculously over-priced.  We ordered Silver Oak and I think it was over $300!

From the Service to the Food leaving me with an impeccable impression and enjoying a restaurant that still follows expert high standards for service that you can clearly see in EACH AND EVERY employee! Pride passion and dedication is what I witnessed last night and it was a relief considering this is my anniversary dinner! With that being said they nailed it making it a perfect dinner, better then expected of course! The food was great! If you haven't heard of the cut of the week, please look it up! Because it is clever to go that route weather you are going on a budget, or just going for a special occasion and want to have a little bit of everything. We did the Colorado Lamb T-Bones with Harissa Powder giving it a unique flavor that matches perfectly with the wine. For those who know how big I am with wine, I can tell you the Somm is really a Genius for the Angeline 2014 Pinot Noir. That wine is kind of rare considering it was produced in a drought, and the flavors of cranberries and orange zest really bring out the Harissa Powder on that Lamb! Now on to this Black Velvet Apricots. The California  Brie really stands out because it is grilled i assume as a whole on the Wax side letting it taste outstanding as you experience literally "" A Grilled  cheese"". Now Eat that with the watercress that is tossed in a clean balsamic, and a piece of that apricot giving you an experience I guarantee you haven't tasted! 5/5 for the salad. Roasted farm squash very nice; Sweet Garlic Pomme Puree, nice to clear the pallet for the next incredible bite of Harissa Lamb! Last was the Panna cotta with coconut lime. More Lime the coconut, but the Shortcake Crumble balances it out with a beautiful texture allowing you to enjoy every bite vs some panna cotta dishes that leave you putting down the spoon as an intake of ""Too Savory"".

It's quite surprising how good it is for only $49. However, there can be improvement in the service department - staff can be more attentive and less defensive/confrontational about diner's requests. More specifically, when asking to have our steak re-cooked (I asked for medium rare and my dish arrived with much more rare center than expected - it became difficult to cut through and there was quite a bit of bleeding), the server insisted that it was our fault for miscommunication of the cooking style. I did not appreciate having this argument at what seems to be a fine dining establishment, over a small issue of how to cook steak. My boyfriend's father cooks steaks on a daily basis at his restaurant; I think we know the different degrees of steak doneness.

Had fingerling potatoes-good, potatoes au gratin so-so and broccolini which was very good.

My first impression of this quiet, refined steakhouse inside the exclusive Four Seasons hotel was WOW as I walked in, and ""wow"" food and drink is exactly what I received in this richly appointed restaurant. This has to be one of the best joints in a city loaded up with great restaurants, and a breath of fresh, quiet air to be sure.

Somewhere in my reading about Vegas I came across the ""best restaurant deal in Vegas"", that being a weekly dinner special at Charlie's, which includes the Bottomless Wines. I took advantage of it and concur: BEST DEAL in Vegas. A grand total of 48 bucks for their special which includes weekly curated selection of ""bottomless"" reds and whites. And yes, that's all you care to drink, within reason. 

The chardonnay I had was sublime and insane (Sbraga Ranch), and the red (I was past the remembering point...) was very good. USDA Prime Strip Steak that week, plus the salad, sides, dessert (peach tart) and the wines, all were first class and flavor-loaded.

From public servant to being treated as royalty!! 

We had the luxury of enjoying perfectly prepared kale salad, filet mignon, candied Brussels sprouts, au gratin....and decadent chocolate peanut butter bar dessert.  

Never have I had a bread basket with so many choices. Corn bread, olive bread, sourdough, wheat...and more.  So happy the accompanying butter was the perfect temperature and easy to spread. 

Kale salad had the best balance of greens I've ever had...so often their is a bitter leaf somewhere in a green salad...not so with this one. The dressing was very light but very flavorful....with the perfect amount of Gorgonzola.  

The filet was absolutely perfect.  It was accompanied by roasted garlic cloves and balsamic reduction.  

Loved the au gratin potatoes....rich, creamy sauce with a hint of garlic and the perfect amount of broasted cheese on top. 

Very impressed by the dessert...I'd really like to know how they made it...the crust was crisp and very light...hard to determine what it was exactly like  chocolate, but not, with a layer of peanut butter mouse.   Subtle peanut butter flavor, not overbearing, topped with scrumptious dark chocolate ganache and a dollop of whip cream. 

So many of the staff members took the time to say thank you to us...which after this very tragic week was much appreciated.  

Everyone from the bus boy to the manager provided us with such exemplary service.  Never was a glass empty.

1734053,2012-09-02,5,MpovsyjkSkchD7ssAdEVKQ,"2012 Fall Restaurant Week Dinner #2. What a great dinner.

It was Saturday night. We arrived earlier than our reservation time, but seated immediately, even got a booth as we requested.

I posted a picture of their Restaurant Week menu, along with the food pictures. Each course had one selection, except for the first where you can choose between salad or soup. They also offered a Wine Pairing as an option for additional $25.

1st Course
Silverado Corn Chowder with
Grilled Rock Shrimp & Jalapeño Bacon

2nd Course
Petit Medallions of Filet Mignon &
Butter Poached Lobster & Bordelaise Sauce

Sides
Creamed Spinach
Truffled Potato Gratin

3rd Course
Chocolate Peanut Butter Bar with
Dulce de Leche Ice Cream &
Dark Chocolate Sauce

Many places participating in Restaurant Week gave more selections to you could choose from for each course. After our meal, it was very clear Charlie Palmer didn't need to give choices. The menu they selected was near perfect, with each course satisfying your taste buds, with a little bit of everything.

I'm not a soup person. I rarely order it anywhere. However, I had friends rave about their corn chowder, so we had to try it. My boyfriend and I rarely order the same thing, but boy am I glad I had my own bowl. It was poured table-side,nice and hot on top the grill rock shrimp and jalapeño bacon. As we watched it pour, my boyfriend both were anticipated it to be thick hearty and heavy, as most chowders are. Nope, it was light and bursting with flavor. As I devoured each spoonful, I got a different taste with each one, a slurp of chowder accompanied by that amazing shrimp, or a little salty and spice with that bacon. I can't believe I've written this whole paragraph about soup. It was that good.

When I read that the entree will be Petite Medallions of Filet Mignon, I thought what many people might think, that it would be ""petite."" I've eaten at enough steakhouses to understand the restaurant language of menus. I was pleasantly surprised to see the portion was very substantial, even for my boyfriend and his huge high-metabolism
appetite. More importantly, it was cooked medium-rare to a tee. Incredibly tender, it melted in your mouth like a filet should. The lobster was juicy and buttery.

Of the two sides, the star that took the show was the truffled potato gratin. It had lots of truffle flavor, creamy, and so comforting. A dish I would love someone to bring for every holiday meal and put on my table. The creamed spinach was good, nothing to complain about. My boyfriend isn't a fan, and I was too busy scraping the bottom of that potato gratin bowl.

I've never had Foie Gras before. I declared that the next time I dined at a fancy restaurant, I'd order it. I think it's one of those dishes you definitely have to try more than once. It was decadent, rich, buttery, and fatty. I took small pieces and ate it with my filet. I can't say it was love at first sight, but I enjoyed it. The verdict is still out till the next time...

Last but not least, the Chocolate Peanut Butter Bar dessert. Served with almonds, dark chocolate sauce, and dulce de Leche ice cream, it was heaven. You ever have a plan when you look at your dessert and say to yourself, ""I'll just have a couple bites, because I can't possibly eat that whole thing..."" Well, that was my exact thought when I picked up my fork. Guess what? It's not what happened. Bite after bite, I loved the dessert even more. Even with the dark chocolate, which I usually think is too rich and bitter for me, as I took a little bit of ice cream, a little piece of the peanut butter bar, and maybe an almond, my tummy was seriously just doing the happy dance. My boyfriend finished his dessert and pointed out the complimentary miniature ice cream sandwiches they gave in addition to our bars. He said they were great. I had a bite, but I was still in a haze, completely captive and enjoying a very intimate moment with my peanut butter dessert.

The service - this is something I really don't need to mention, because it was what anyone would walk in expecting at a place like this. The water was always filled, the courses came out with precision timing, the crumbs were cleared off the tablecloth, every empty dish or plate was cleared away within seconds. Our servers were friendly, smiling, helpful, and of course, amazingly attentive. As we settled our check, we told them how much we enjoyed our dinner there, and they expressed their gratitude and welcomed us back. We were happy to hear that Charlie Palmer almost always participates for Las Vegas Restaurant Week.

So, to sum it up, I patted myself on the back for choosing Charlie Palmer as my last dinner for this fall's Restaurant Week. It'll be on the list of restaurants to consider for future special occasions.

1760084,2015-08-24,0,MpovsyjkSkchD7ssAdEVKQ,"This was a nice place, a good break from the insanity of The Strip. 

I started with the baby iceberg, which came with a chipotle dressing instead of the typical bleu cheese.  That was a nice touch, and so was the sweet corn.  They weren't too heavy on the bleu cheese chunks either which was nice.  It was a really good balance. 

My main course was the filet mignon.  It was cooked really well with a flavorful crust.

For dessert I got the berries with sweet cream.  This was my only disappointment.  The amount of cream was tiny for the amount of fruit I got.  I expected more of a dessert instead of a bowl of raspberries and blackberries.

I made a reservation a week ago for my birthday. I called them on the way there to check and see where the best parking location was and was told that they didn't have my reservation. How do you lose a reservation?

The guy who answered the phone made us another reservation but 30 minutes after what we had originally planned. We live twenty minutes away and were already there so we showed up early and were put in a really awkward table in the corner behind a giant pole. We asked to move and were told all the tables were reserved! The restaurant was EMPTY!

We waited five minutes for our server to even come over and acknowledge us. The girl who brought us water was very nice and told us that she would go find our server. When he finally came over and took our drink orders, he rolled his eyes when we ordered only one cocktail and then he never came back.

We sat at the table for 20 minutes and then decided to leave.

For entrees, I had the filet mignon, hubby had the ribeye, kids shared the roasted chicken. Wonderful, this really is one of the best steakhouse we've dined at. Everyone else pales in comparison.

The hostess was excellent.  The restaurant is very nicely appointed and relatively quiet for a packed house.  The service was top notch--my dining companion had a steak that was a bit overcooked--and the waiter immediately had another steak prepared, which was then delivered to our table by the manager herself.  

We were fortunate to be there for Restaurant Week--so they had a special menu for the occasion.  I started with a mixed green salad which was fine, and then had an excellent steak and lobster main course.  My steak was perfectly prepared and lightly seasoned, and the lobster was delicious. An excellent cheesecake accompanied by pistachio ice cream finished the dinner.

Our table ordered a starter of the calamari and the foie gras. The calamari was the best I have ever had anywhere! The sauce that it was sitting over with a spicy sweet honey like sauce. The right amount of spice was added to it. The hit of the table for sure! The foie gras was rich and creamy as well. Perfect over the flake biscuit. 

Main dish I ordered was the NY strip cooked medium. The steak was lightly seasoned with salt and pepper and I had ordered a side of their peppercorn sauce. Wow! Steak was so juicy and delicious. I didn't want to put the sauce on the top! Mushrooms as a side dish was a hit. 

Last was dessert and I ordered the cheese cake. This was a crustless cheese cake that was very soft. I haven't had anything like it before. I won't look at cheese cake ever the same. It was so silky and with a little tart note to it. To replace the crust they had little ginger cookie grumbles on the plate to use to eat it. So nice!

First, you can use a room credit here if you are staying at Mandalay or Four Seasons. You can charge the meal to your room if you show photo ID. The lobster bisque ($16) wasn't the best I've ever had but it was pretty good! The lobster fried rice was fun and tasty. Pro tip: get multiple sides and share. They come with serving utensils.

The bone in rib eye ($60) is their showcased steak. It was huge but Pete did not leave a morsel on the plate. They don't advertise it but they will serve a petite filet mignon (8oz $45). The filet on the menu is 10oz for $52. They also didn't state creamed spinach on the menu but they do offer it. I loved how they made things off the menu. We also got truffle Mac and cheese and Brussels sprouts.

We were too full for dessert but the waiter brought us out complimentary chocolate turtle cookies. I was too stuffed to even eat my free cookie but Pete loved his.

I came here on a girls weekend with my aunts and cousins, so that's why it makes this story especially interesting.

We arrived in Las Vegas on a Friday night, had reservations for this restaurant, and were super excited to eat here. We had heard great things.

We were seated in the back, at a nice large table for the 14 of us. The waiters immediately came to our rescue and asked us what we wanted to drink. The drinks came out PERFECT. I ordered a Long Island Ice Tea. It wasn't too strong and the sweetness of it was perfect.

The food was also great. My two cousins and I have super weird allergies... I am allergic to shellfish and some peanuts, one cousin is allergic to anything with gluten, and another cousin is allergic to egg yolk and mustard. I know, you are wondering how the hell we got anything to eat here! Well, the chefs were extremely patient with our allergies, and even brought us gluten free bread!!! The menu is workable to any allergy; you can literally order anything you want on the menu, and they will cater it to your allergy, or even just to your specific taste bud.

Overall, I really enjoyed my experience here. They had extremely awesome customer service, and they really made us feel very welcome. 

It is quite pricey, so bring a few bills with you if you want to go all out... oh! and also, BRING A FLASHLIGHT!!!!!!

We were offered the ""chinchilla"" table right next to the door but opted for the booth table located at the back of the restaurant. (So much more cozy and romantic.) Although on this particular night, it so happens that a couple across from us was celebrating their 45th anniversary...so sweet. The atmosphere and the service was top notch: waiters noticing when you leave the table for the restroom and they come and fold your cloth napkin. 

Hubby and I ordered 2 appetizers: oxtail ravioli and potato/leek soup
The ravioli was served al dente (just the way I like it) with an incredible sauce. The pasta was the star but then you get a little surprise of the flavorful meat inside. When the soup arrived...yes it was served table side showcasing the ingredients inside the soup first, the waiter then poured our hot and creamy soup in the bowl (a big portion enough for two). You thought the ravioli was good enough, this soup took it out of the park. Loved loved it!

Our main course: 18 oz Ribeye with onion jus and a twice-baked truffle potato. Um....so juicy, tender and the meat just melts in your mouth. The potato of course was super delicious, moist and flavorful.

We were stuffed by the end of the night that we opted out of the dessert portion. Blasphemy right?!

The dessert was pumpkin pie and cheesecake. Very good.

Then we had the T-bone which was quite large, it wasn't of course as good as Peter Luger or Mastros but it was ok.  The steak included the side dishes so it was nice not having to order it on the side.

We are experienced Vegas steak house clients (SW, STK, Circus Circus Steak, Capital Grill, Ruth's Chris) and we were so disappointed with this visit to Charlie Palmer's. We made a reservation for a special occasion and this was not mentioned when we checked in at the host desk. Service was just OK, we were really not made to feel welcome at all as we had in past visits. My husband's steak was not properly cooked (we both asked for medium rare, mine was perfect, his was almost raw) and the server ARGUED with us about it - amazing. At that price point, even if he asked for well done and it was raw you DO NOT ARGUE, just bring it back. We wanted wine by the glass, saw that it was $11/$12 per glass but it didn't specify the winery on the wine menu, asked the sommelier for his recommendation. Unfortunately we did not check the bill carefully and we eventually discovered that the wine was $28 per glass, shame on us, but one more mark against them that night. The food was OK, just OK for the price point - at that cost you are looking for the total experience, which Charlie Palmers has always provided in the past - we were so, so disappointed. The special occasion was just never mentioned - this has never happened before. We will not be back anytime soon.

On a recommendation my wife and I along with some friends chose Charlie Palmer Steakhouse for dinner. We were promptly seated upon arrival at a sizable table for our party of five; however, the chairs were awkwardly arranged and required some uncomfortable shifting and straddling of table legs. The service while friendly seemed to be mildly disorganized to the point of being somewhat intrusive.

We were asked four separate times if we needed assistance; however, it is the wine list that needs the help. We found the selection to be extremely lacking and incredibly overpriced even for Vegas. A ""budget"" Bordeaux at $95 was reluctantly selected and even more reluctantly accepted after tasting. The wine had not spoiled but was by far one of the poorest quality Bordeaux's we have tasted, deep apologies for not remembering the vintner.

The table bread may have been the highlight of the evening and I applaud the chef for producing a cornbread that my wife thoroughly enjoyed, she hates cornbread... I will also give a nod to the butternut ravioli soup; it was flavorful and with a rich consistency. Sadly this is where the praise ends.

Main course was bone-in rib-eye and the potatoes au gratin. The steak was properly cooked but had the consistency and taste of something one would order from Sizzler. The potatoes were undercooked, overly starchy and lacking in overall taste. When paying for a premium aged steak I expect to be delighted by every bite not struggling to put the meal down to justify the premium price tag. Everyone in our party ordered something different with similar results.

Vegas is all about knowing when to walk away and we didn't bother trying the desserts. As hard as it is for me to dislike a steakhouse, I have to strongly recommend against visiting this establishment. For your money you are better off at Morton's or Sinatra (Encore).

2293284,2014-03-14,3,MpovsyjkSkchD7ssAdEVKQ,"Nestled in a deep dark Netherworld cavernous hole somewhere between Mandalay Bay and the I15 Freeway, this little hot spot sure packs a punch, to your wallet.  It also look like my grandmother was the head interior designer.  I've seen better design aesthetics in a Wichita Hometown Buffet.  

Dry and Wet aged steaks sounded amazing so we were excited.  When I asked if they were aged in house and found out no, they're aged ""somewhere in Arizona"" I got a little weary of the $70 Porterhouse and even more weary of the $40/oz Kobe (4 oz minimum and they help you with the math).  The steak was fine otherwise, just fine.  Save your $ for David Burke or a real steak house where they age in house.

Every single other item we had was 1 star.  

Fois Gras Terrine - I guess I missed the terrine part but to me you don't advertise Hudson Valley Fois Gras and then put a cold hot dog on the table.  Expected a nice piece of seared Fois.  Poor presentation, gross in general.

Asparagus Almondine - flavorless logs of cold green mush.

Au Gratin potatoes - Rather have Betty Crocker boxed from my mom in 1989. 

Bone Marrow - cold gelatinous fat 

This place is clearly accustomed to serving Bubba and Janet Johnston from Columbus Ohio who have never even heard of Wagyu let alone seen it on a menu.  The service was poor (we saw our server once during our meal, I couldn't even find him to complain about the Oscar Meyer Wiener Terrine so we just choked it down instead). Although I will say that in general, I have rarely been blown away by the food in Vegas.  I think the attitude on the strip is, ""these people are on vacation from the mid west and don't know a thing about food or service so lets give them mediocre food and overcharge them"".

I rarely write reviews, this place was just comically overpriced and sadly underwhelming.  Choke job Charlie P!  I expect more for $225/person I guess, but that's just me.",VCYQ_1yXZhSZyYWkbBTGQQ,5,0,2,GRzO-P03eoEMgudZkV17Og

2318861,2012-08-31,0,MpovsyjkSkchD7ssAdEVKQ,"My gf and I dined here last night as part of our Restaurant Week excursions. 

I made reservations for 8:15 and upon arrival, we were seated immediately at a cosy booth near the bar. I really liked the seating arrangement for tables for 2. They are like ""half-booths"" and you are seated right next to your dining partner. Also, our booth was at the wall immediately adjacent to the bar, so I could see the entire restaurant from my seat. Also, I really enjoyed this location because I could hear the soft tunes from the playlist that was being played at the bar - a nice mix of Coldplay, U2, Lana, etc. 

We were immediately greeted by a waiter who asked for our water preference and brought us the cocktail and wine lists. My gf really wanted a sweet, strawberry flavored cocktail. They didn't have it on the menu, but they had a similar orange creamsicle type beverage. I asked the waiter if the bartender might be able to make something similar with strawberry - he returned within 5 minutes with exactly what we wanted. 

Another waiter brought us bread and explained the menu to us. I was temped to diverge from the restaurant week menu, but really wanted to try the corn chowder. I had the corn chowder, the only entree option (filet medallions and lobster) and my gf had the caprice to start. All dishes were delicious. We also had garlic spinach and truffle potato gratin. Those dishes were also good - a bit heavy and the potatoes were very ""truffle-y"" but I was not disappointed. The steak and lobster were cooked perfectly. The filet medallions were not the best cut of meat I have ever had nor the tastiest, but I was satisfied with the way they were cooked and their overall flavor. The side dishes were large and neither of us were able to finish our meal. 

After dinner, they brought us each dessert which was a small ice cream sandwich looking thing that was kind of peanut-buttery with creme brulee ice cream (tiny scoop) and some chocolate sauce. It was delicious. Small, but delicious. I was already stuffed from dinner. 

Overall, the service was great. One complaint though is that there were about 4 different waiters coming to our table at different times, so it was difficult to know who was taking care of us. Generally, I prefer one waiter, maybe two, so that it is more of a personal experience. 

The atmosphere here is wonderful and just the way I like it. Dim lights, classy, and tables spaced far enough away from one another so that you do not feel like everyone can hear your conversation. 

Really nice meal and I am happy I chose this restaurant. 

Tip: If you do not want to self-park at Mandalay and then walk the miles it seems to take to get to the Four Seasons, there is a lot just outside of the entrance to the Four Seasons where you can park and then walk up the driveway towards the hotel entrance/valet.",1pqyIOcWh-EEHOR9AHUkWA,5,1,4,FQZRCdHsSeRKAv1t7WIEyQ

2334606,2008-08-03,0,MpovsyjkSkchD7ssAdEVKQ,"This steak restaurant located on the lobby floor of the Four Seasons Hotel is not to be missed. Not very crowded at times and thats a good thing. It seems like every steak restaurant in Las Vegas is filled to the gills and annoyingly loud. I have eaten at least 10 different steakhouses in Las Vegas and this is the classiest and still my favorite. It feels like a cross between an updated clubby steakhouse sans booths, and an elegant, dark, and nicely appointed restaurant. One different aspect is the smoking section. Its this seperate beautifully sectioned off area filled with overstuffed, beautiful and very comfy cushions. It gives a feeling of a more relaxed classy dining experience as oppossed to big booths to eat large slabs of meat. I still choose to dine there and I already quit smoking years ago.

The service is excellent and extremely attentive. It will feel like you do not wait for anything. The bartenders understand the importance of paying attention to making a cocktail instead of just pouring liquor to the top and adding a splash of something.

Of course if your there for steak, the most important aspect is the meat itself. Quality and portions wise, it ranks up there with the best, but its not the best. The meat is wet aged and I prefer dry so thats why I am probably put off slightly. If you prefer dry aged beef only, this is probably not for you. I always get the bone in ribeye and never left hungry or dissapointed. Everything else is a la cart.

This is a very beautiful classy way to enjoy a steak in Vegas. Bachelor parties are better off at 9ine at the Palms (Which I also have been privy to). Much more livelier and raucous, filled with the ""beautiful people"" but the food and service suffer accordingly.",aKQL8qFwhAo0uMRaseICOA,1,1,4,T4jo4aaRFoWGxgkMYysFbQ

While they are priced pretty high (to be expected at a legit steak house), they are amazing.  So, definitely make sure you try a couple of them when you're here.  The service is also amazing but it does borderline on a little excessive from time to time.  We were here for a bachelor party and I got the sense that some of the guys were not in their element with a guy pouring water over their shoulder every 10 seconds.  

Now, as far as the food goes, sadly, this is where the disappointment comes in for me.  Everything was pretty good but I don't want pretty good when I go to a Charlie Palmer restaurant, I want amazing.  The portions are huge so that is nice but I tried a few of my friend's dishes (in addition to my 3-course prix fixe dinner) and they are all ho-hum for me.  The wine that accompanies the prix fixe dinner is ok at best but since it is all you can drink, I don't really think I should complain too much.

My parents have been coming here for years, and I was finally able to go recently (New Years day). Since my parents have been here often, they built up my expectations *extremely* high--and this place exceeded those expectations! 

I ordered the cut of the week (3 course menu with bottomless wine pairings), which was an amazing deal, and all of the food was beyond delicious. The first course, wedge salad, paired beautifully with the wine! One of my all time favorite food and wine pairings (and I have done my fair share!). 

I have to admit, I am a very, very picky eater when it comes to red meat, and the main course was a petite filet. The filet was divine!!! I barely had to put any pressure on the knife to cut through my filet--a perfect medium rare!!! I will have dreams of that filet until I can return again :) hands down, best filet I have ever had. The sides of Brussels sprouts and mashed potatoes were wonderful, too. For dessert, I had creme brûlée and though I was really full, what little of my dessert I could eat was so delicious!

So here's what the special consists of for $48 excl tax and tip (and each week it changes - check their website):  salad, ""cut"" of meat and desert with unlimited wine pairings.  The chef chooses the menu and accompanying wine and I must say he chose very well.

They have a small plates menu also - we decided to try a few of those and were delicious (tried olives and boccacini with red peppers).  

Honestly cannot say enough good about the menu selections (we had the bone-in New York which was soooo good) but the selections change weekly.  The salad was an arugula and watermelon/feta - was perfect (we all agreed that the small amount of dressing on the salad paired perfectly with the peppery/bitterness of the arugula).  The salad course had a white wine pairing and the NY had a red wine pairing (a blend 90% merlot and 10% cab) - both were excellent!  We also shared a giant twice-baked potato with truffles (per Tony D's review) and loved loved loved it!   The staff was excellent - very friendly and attentive.  The chef also greeted us which was a nice treat (along with the great desert) - super sweet (pun intended)!!!!

They are closed on Sunday/Monday.  They are obviously looking to lure in some locals with the tv spots and I must say that I'm glad I was lured....well, I usually say that in the right company :-)

Have a well-crafted cocktail (perhaps a Sidecar or ice cold vodka martini) in the lounge and prepare yourself for an excellent experience.  Service is exceptional, always nearby but never hovering.

When we arrived, they said that was not available.  After our waiter conferences with the chef, the manager, and several other people who met in hushed tones in the back and then asked us who exactly was it that told us that a fixed price was available, they offered us a salad, a strip steak, and two pieces of ravioli each.

However, this place missed the mark for us. We got the New York Strip for two, as did our friends. We ordered ours medium rare and they ordered theirs medium. Both came out cooked the same exact way. Food was ok, service was horrible. As much as these places charge, I expect great service. Our busboy was on top of it, but our waiter was non existent. He took our order and he checked on us once. Our water glasses went empty, my friend asked for a diet Coke that was forgotten about, we asked the busboy for the Coke and it came about 15 minutes later! I don't know if it was a staffing issue or what but it was not that busy so there is no reason for the bad service. The manager? Came around and asked how everything was, but we hadn't been there long enough to really gauge our experience at that point. We also decided mid meal we would like wine, and asked for a wine list which was never brought to us. Overall a very disappointing experience.",NS3B17yHv2lBJfGuwSmVNw,4,0,2,W8JPSb0n5E9I8zhcwR4QsQ

Starting off with the service, the service was impeccable.  Very well trained and knowledgeable staff, very easy to just get into a conversation with. Attentive to every detail. Outstanding service.

The food:  the caesar salad - was worth having, and I would highly recommend.  
There is a twist to their salad, they add some prosciutto to their romaine hearts, and it was pretty awesome to taste.  Big enough to share, or if you are really hungry get your own.
The filet was cooked very well. Its on the larger side, so between the main dishes and few sides, you will not leave hungry.  
Great wine list, and the bar itself is worth hanging out in for a few hours.  Great drinks.

Probably one of the better steak houses to come to in Vegas.",4oOTe6v2RGea2Q1xQHe5dw,1,0,4,ul9c0oxTI_BCiC2Rv09i4Q

We had 2 waiters who were supposed to work in tandem.... Neither one ever asked if wanted another drink, if we had questions about the menu, EXPLAINED the menu, asked how we were doing, if the meal was OK, etc. I guess each waiter assumed that the other waiter had taken care of these things. They were completely disinterested in us, even after I explained how we felt overlooked and forgotten. Rude and ridiculous. Just awful. There seemed to be a restaurant full of waiters running around looking busy, meanwhile only 1/3 of the tables were full with customers. We had a third waiter who poured the flights of wine with each course. He was nice. My husband and I came here for a much needed romantic night away from our kids. It was an awkward and upsetting dinner. Although we are in our 30's, we look young for our age. Maybe they didn't take us seriously?

2810245,2014-02-17,1,MpovsyjkSkchD7ssAdEVKQ,"First off, I'm not normally one to complain...I was a server myself before and know how hard it is to put on a ""perfect"" evening for a large group.  There is no such thing as perfect, nor do I remotely expect it.  What we experienced at Charlie Palmer Steak at the Four Seasons Hotel in Las Vegas however, can only be described as pathetic and insulting.

We were there for a Valentines Day wedding party dinner with 27 people, with the bride and groom paying for dinner including a wine/beer/cocktails package for everyone.  We were told there was to be an open bar for 3 hours.  For starters, the wedding couple was surprised to find that the setup they were expecting (a standing/mingling area for drinks/appetizers and a separate sit down table for dinner) was not provided.  Rather there was simply a cramped back room stuffed with a table for 27.  Oh well, moving on.

IMO from the appetizers to desert, the staff showed their incredible lack of competence, care and integrity.  Appetizers that never made it down to our side of the table because they didn't distribute them properly (big plates, hard to pass around).  Drink orders (at least 4 requests by my wife and I, and a few from others around us) that went ignored.  Whatever, we took it in stride as we didn't want to complain with the wedding party there - and they did bring wine out a few times during appetizers and the main course.  Small pours however.

From there on however, more waiters disappearing without bringing our drink orders.  
Not responding to our requests for wine.  Making excuses like, ""We're busy preparing the cake, we don't have time to serve wine"".  What? With all the servers there, you don't have one guy that can pour wine (after you've ignored our requests and empty glasses for the last 30 minutes)?  I was dumbfounded at the response.  

Finally the guy came back around to pour wine...but by the time he made it to my wife and I, he had little left.  He poured about 2 ounces in my glass and then unbelievably poured literally a FEW DRIPS into my wife's glass and then walked off.  NEVER TO RETURN.  From there on, I asked at least 3 times for wine only to have them tell me they'd bring it...when they never did...then ultimately ""sorry, no more wine, serving time is over"".  What?? 

It gets better.  Then they start serving the cake...only to apparently run out before serving at least 4 guests.  Again, my wife and I...and the Groom's own Mother!  As they are serving coffee and picking up finished cake plates from people right across from us...it wasn't remotely apparent to them that they left many people unserved for cake and coffee.  I didn't say anything because I was just too disgusted/dumbfounded at that point.  At that point I was just sitting back, watching the carnage unfold.  

Finally, another 30 minutes later when we're getting ready to leave (about 9:45pm), the waiter comes over with a bottle of wine and offers me a glass!  What??  After all that, you now offer it??  I promptly told him, no thanks, no longer interested.  I had literally ""lost my appetite"".

In the end, I feel like these guys took attention away from what should have been a more enjoyable wedding dinner party.  IMO, they RIPPED OFF our friends who paid $250 PER HEAD to have an open bar, wine and beer service.  IMO, they added insult to injury with the way they handled things.  This was literally the worst ""fine dining"" server experience I have ever had and I feel inclined to share this.  I will never step foot in another Charlie Palmer Steak house.  These guys were absolutely terrible.  I strongly urge you to reconsider hosting any dinner parties at this establishment.",CQO6XAzpiuJJAEugbKvQYg,5,1,1,YPgnXgI-tpMlrnZ3zcMG4A

We recieved drink service once throughout the entire meal and had to go find our waiter for the check about 30min after we finished eating and no one had come to check on us.

The service was incredible but mine and my wife's steaks just both weren't that great.  If I were at some cheap steakhouse where I pay $20 for a steak I wouldn't mind but when I'm paying $40+ for a steak I expect more.

My steak (NY Strip) came out slightly overcooked and it was just really tough.  Again, $20 steak I would expect that, but for $40+ that just wasn't acceptable.  On top of that, it was also just bland.

I tasted my wife's steak (filet with a scallop jus sauce) and I thought it just tasted awful and came out undercooked for her.  The steak itself, again, was bland but it was hard to notice since it was drowning in the sauce.

The sides were good and our appetizers were good, but the steaks were just so mediocre.  It's sad because our expectations were so high from the Dallas location and we hoped the Vegas one would at the very least be comparable.",WuEJ6lcHcNrtEAK1YgIqhA,0,0,3,sG-mtbaXk3933-0JmNEoew

My only beef (pardon the pun), was the stuffy service and the condescending maitre-de; other than that it was spectacular.
The week we were there, we got the following:

A nice lemony salad with shrimp: really good;
A filet with maetaki mushrooms: I'm not a huge filet fan but this one was pretty awesome;.
A garlic pomme puree: smooth, creamy, garlicky and delicious;
Honey glazed baby carrots: tasty, but a little cloying... if i were the chef, I'd add some herbs and/or finish with a squeeze of lime.

We asked them to decant our wine which they did back in the kitchen l guess which is odd.

3049421,2010-09-17,0,MpovsyjkSkchD7ssAdEVKQ,"It took me a lot of hours on Yelp to decide where to have a top notch steak while in Vegas. I mean, it's not like there are 431 steakhouses in Vegas or anything. I am going to do my best to cover all the bases here, but I gotta be honest. Charlie Palmer Steak delivered one of the greatest and most synchronized dining experiences I have ever had and this is how the story goes. 

The location:

Located inside the four seasons hotel, the restaurant itself is a bit darker than I enjoy, but it's a huge location that is very inviting. There is a very nice bar located near the front that seemed to be a bit dead. More than likely that has more to do with the fact that if your reservation is for 7PM you get seated at 7PM. That is how it went on Wednesday night, so I am not sure how it works out on the weekends when there are more folks in town.

The menu: 

Very extensive menu that hits on a number of different price points. They give you an opportunity to go small, medium or big and big is B-I-G!!! They have what's called the ""cut of the week"" which is a pri fix menu option that includes 3 courses and two sides for $48. That's a great deal for the amount of food they serve. 

The Food:

I knew before I sat down that I was going to pay a premium for dinner and that wasn't an issue for me. I was just hoping that the food would be off the charts good and I would get what I paid for and that's exactly how it went down. 

We ordered oysters which were from the pacific northwest (I forget the name but I'm not hypercritical about the specific types of oysters when I dine at a high end restaurant) and they were amazing. Perfectly chilled, perfectly shucked and almost as fresh as the oysters I get here in San Francisco. My date doesn't even dig oysters and she loved them.

My date for the evening, Lizzy, ordered their ""cut of the week"" option and it was as follows:

First course Bib lettuce salad

The lettuce was too large to eat and probably could have been chopped to fit on the fork. The blue cheese was really strong for my taste but the bacon lardons were perfectly crisp and delicious. Overall the salad was good, but nothing special.

Second course 16 oz. NY Steak

The cut was a very large portion and it was cooked almost perfectly. It had a bit too much gristle for my taste but it Lizzy killed it so she clearly didn't have a problem with it. Seasoned well, tender and the sauce that accompanied it was flavorful and a great addition. 

Dessert Meyer Lemon Creme Brulee 

Custard is not my thing but I tried it. It was a bit too tart for my taste buds and I wouldn't order it. 

2 sides Baby Broccoli and Garlic Mashed Potatoes

Baby broccoli was cooked just they way I like it. Crisp, bright green and still crunchy but cooked all the way through. Garlic mashed were good. It tasted like there was a bit of truffle oil goin on but I was focused on the red meat more than the starch. I mean, I didn't come to Vegas for the mashed potatoes. Feel me??

My Entree  Surf and Turf

Wonderfully seasoned and perfectly cooked filet mignon. Melt in your mouth good and absolutely amazing quality on this cut. Each bite tasted better than the previous bite. half tail of Maine lobster, cooked perfectly, with drawn butter and it was stuffed with a truly delicious mix of lobster, lobster stalk, fresh bread crumbs and a few special ingredients the waiter left out. Lobster meat was pulled away from the shell, which is a nice touch b/c who really wants to sit there with a bib on shucking lobster from the shell? I sure don't. 

Dessert

The waiter comes out with these tiny, fabulous house made ice cream sandwiches, compliments of the chef. They were too kill for! The cookies were soft, delicious and the ice cream was a creamy dream of wonderful. We could have eaten about 8 more of those bad boys without an issue. 

The service

10 out of 10. The waiter was friendly, he knew the menu up and down, answered all of our questions (and we had plenty) and was on top of his game. A step further. Our waiter had a party of 8 and a party of 6 seated as we were eating dinner. Instead of ditching us all together, another waiter came over to make sure we were doing ok and was also on top of his game. The communication between waiters, servers and the rest of the staff was absolutely perfect and I had never seen anything like it. Something as simple as pouring water in a glass was handled with such care. The waiter would hold a napkin over the glass each time she/he poured making sure we didn't get splashed. At times, they were a bit too fast for their own good. They took away my fork, knife and small plate after they cleared the oysters, but I'm not complaining because I was flat out impressed by the attention to detail. Each and every person working the room had a smile on their face, they were chatty but not too chatty, they took pics of people who wanted them to and it was truly a top notch dining experience and I can't wait to head back for more.",ENtSjbekFHjltp2TFkstHg,3,1,5,-jOUzx137T9SV7TXU5hUCg

3096492,2011-01-04,1,MpovsyjkSkchD7ssAdEVKQ,"This is a truly posh and swanky restaurant, located right below the Four Season's hotel Las Vegas. We had a gift card in the amount of $400 and used it 2x while visiting Sin City. The only drawback is that you have to search a little around for the restaurant since it's located inside of Mandalay Bay. 

We ordered the surf and turf with a few entrees and were very pleased. The lobster was fresh, soft and very meaty. I would also say that the steak was premium quality. 

The food was sensational, but the real bonus is the fine customer service this place offers. We had no less than 3 different staff members waiting on us at any given moment, each doing their best to make sure we had a great time. 

Finally, their coffee is some of the best I've had in Las Vegas. I ordered a carafe, and polished off the whole pot. I can't say enough about superb this restaurant is.",gXjrG6Y-OXYpQH3nCIcTlw,1,3,4,UP5WcwFT68nWGtNrJ3LWmQ

3126939,2015-08-18,1,MpovsyjkSkchD7ssAdEVKQ,"First off, steak was delicious.  Also had the tomato soup and ravioli for starters. All excellent. 

Went in for the promo.  We had a nice bottle of Cabernet that we decided was better to enjoy at a steakhouse when I wasn't coking.  Server was rude and had no clue of the no-corkage Monday promo that is ALL OVER the Charlie Palmer LV website.  Wine sommelier came over and took the rude-level up a notch. Literally told us he would ""allow us"" to drink our wine in the restaurant, and that we are getting charged the corkage fee.  At this point I pulled out my cell phone and showed him the promo.  He came off very defensive and never apologized.  Both employees left us with ""Let me check with my manager.""  Neither came back to let us know the status of the promo, which in the end was applied. But it's the lack of tact that left us with a bad taste. Is this not in a Four Seasons resort?! 
(Silver Oak Napa 2010 if anyone is interested). 

AND, while all of this was going on, an 8-top was having separate issues with their server and manager. They were NOT HAPPY.  

AND, all the while the table next to them were having serious issues with their service that they WALKED OUT mid-main entree service!  

The bussers and food runners were amazing.  The kitchen seemed to be going well as we didn't encounter any timing issues with the food, and the quality of the beef was excellent , as well as the cooking temp.  Ordered cocktails as we got seated and those were delivered timely and tasty! 
We arrived 15 minutes late for our res, my bad, I had the time jotted down incorrect , but the hostess took us to our table with no problems.",fKYFJ8zbCHl0P76M9CZ61A,0,1,3,27oQs9NPeGKEE_qibNjbbg

The clientele fit the surroundings for a high end luxury restaurant. And the live jazz/dinner music was such a delight to listen to during our meal. 

However, everything was delicious up until the steak arrived. The salad was blend of Oak Lettuce, Crunch Grapes & Camembert cheese which was paired with a fantastic Moscato (and I don't really care for white wine). I ordered the NY Strip rare because I love the flavor or the meat, but it was a bit tough. In fact, so much so that it was hard to cut through with their steak knife. My jaw was left aching after my meal and although the meat tasted savory the work it took to eat it took away some of the enjoyment of eating the steak. The Pecan pie with Caramel Ice cream was so delicious and a great way to end our meal. 

I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone who would like to see how the other half live, just don't expect to be blown out of the water.",7AENCr56ijU5oOmNSbWljw,0,0,4,Hbfw6IIOaDr4UGrDdm0-WA

3136718,2015-09-01,0,MpovsyjkSkchD7ssAdEVKQ,"I went to Charlie Palmer to celebrate my brother and SIL's tenth anniversary.  At the bottom of the Four Seasons Hotel at Mandalay Bay, the restaurant is absolutely beautiful.  We had a private room to accommodate our party.  The menu was a set 3 course meal with 2 choices for each course (The Michael Jackson Tribute Menu).  They actually printed new menus with my brother and SIL names which was a really nice touch.

So for $50 I got a three course meal consisting of roasted tomato soup , a bone in filet and carrot cake, with bottomless wine pairings for the first two courses.  Before I start on the dinner, I just want to mention the bread basket had some of the best cornbread.  Now for the dinner.  The tomato soup was tasty with 2 crispy wontons with mascarpone cheese and served at the table.  I've never heard of a bone in filet, but it was tender & perfectly cooked medium rare.  I usually like a fattier cut like a rib eye, but the filet was the best I've had.  I suspect it was the bone.  The carrot cake was moist and the serving size for the desserts was huge.  I don't think anyone could finish their dessert.

Service was impeccable and they also accommodated 2 children under 5.

For $50, this has got to be the best deal of any high end steakhouse in Vegas. The bone-in filet would be $50 at most places ala carte, so I'm not sure how they throw in a first course, dessert and bottomless wine pairing at this price, but I won't complain.",3HgHp-SWWhauBxhK7K_skw,5,0,5,RAT_uxu9BMCJaHIstDp2fA
3141724,2015-08-22,0,MpovsyjkSkchD7ssAdEVKQ,WOW.. Where do I start with Charlie Palmer Steak?? Listen I have to be honest about this place. I was extremely nervous booking my reservation here for my anniversary due to all of the mixed reviews. I was so afraid of not receiving good customer service and from reading the reviews some of the staff has been rude. Well I am here to say that I was fortunate enough to visit them on one of the nights they delivered! I made my reservation for originally 9:00PM through opentable but ended up changing it to 9:15Pm instead! I love that you can modify your own reservations without actually having to call. Upon arriving we were greeted right away from a nice gentleman who seemed to be the manger. He confirmed my reservation and actually gave us the choice of having a booth and sitting next to each other or a table where we would be sitting across! So because it was my anniversary of course we choose the booth to sit next to each other. For starters they brought us two glasses of champagne on the house for our celebration! What a nice gesture! We didn't order any appetizers because my partner ordered off the prix fixe menu which already included a nice salad! Very tasty I might add. The special for that night included a Porterhouse Pork Chop (cooked medium well) and for my dish I ordered the Bone-In Ribeye (Cooked Medium) with a Blue Cheese Fondue on the top. WOW again! I will have to say one of the best steaks I've had and not to mention I do believe it was worth the $60! I have to shout out my server for being so involved and helping the celebration of my anniversary go fabulous! In addition to the chocolate cake that came with the prix fixe menu we were brought some of the sorbet's of all different flavors! Each and every one of them was delicious! All in all I would say that I will be returning on my next big occasion.. or wait maybe even before than! Thanks Charlie Palmer!,qPVtjjp8sNQ32p9860SR9Q,1,0,5,ulHWNujgu-Yji3wuSqDi3A

We both ordered the filet mignon. I had the ahi trio, he had the jumbo shrimp. The ahi carpaccio was the best out of the three. The shrimp was good. Overall we felt like the food was under seasoned. It would have been nice to have salt and pepper so we had the option to season our food.

The service - it started out good. The server was initially friendly. Early on, him and the table next to us realized they had some kind of connection. That's when our service basically ended. We got our appetizers before the table next to us and heard the waiter ask the runner why he did that. He checked in and chatted with the table next to us, refilled their glasses, gave them extra food ""compliments of the chef."" We barely got a second glance.

The food runners were very nice and accommodating. The GM stopped by and checked in with us. He was very nice but at that point we were over it.

The dining room lighting was mostly dim but varied and was brighter in places where there were floor lamps. Overall it's a romantic atmosphere. There is a choice of banquette and table seating. We were seated  in a banquette along a glass wall separating the restaurant from the bar area and found it to be very loud. We requested a change to the opposite side of the dining room and it was much quieter. 
Service throughout dinner was prompt and attentive starting with water and the bread basket. There was a nice selection of fresh bread, olive, rye and corn.  All food items were large portions that resulted in take home for another meal. The appetizer of Wild Baja Prawns was delicious with a tangy cocktail sauce and served over a carrot salad that added a nice crunch. The side of asparagus was grilled perfectly, al dente and the puree of potatoes were creamy. The size of the Filet Mignon is not listed on the menu but our server Yash said it was 10 ounces. Both of ours were cooked perfectly but too large for us to finish. The complementary birthday dessert with a candle was a pleasant surprise. Six scoops of sorbet with three flavors, mango, vanilla and raspberry.

I had the wagyu short rib with sweet and sour beets and horseradish cream.  It's as if The chef forgot to season the beef- it was so bland.  Short ribs are typically so tender that you can cut them with a fork.  Not this. I struggled with cutting it with a knife because it was dry.  The beets were fine, but the horseradish lacked the spicy kick that is typical of horseradish.  I also had hamachi sashimi to start.  This was underwhelming.  The best dish was the potatoes gratin.  These are very good.  The creamed spinach and Brussels sprouts are good as well.  We tried the Pineapple Upside Down cake for dessert, and this was underwhelming and dry.  I was intrigued by the thyme ice cream, so I ordered a scoop of that- except it came in an interesting ""rack"" of 6 scoops.  Had I known and was told, I would have gotten some other flavors.  Couldn't eat 6 scoops  of a single flavor that was just so-so.  The service was friendly but slow.  A few of my dining mates sent their plates back because they were cooked incorrectly.

Space was beautiful and quite.  No problem getting there with a short cab ride.  Was a relief to be away from the loud masses of people for a while.  I had read about this restaurant on several review pages, so we knew to ask for the Michael Jackson tribute and cut of the week options.

First course a delicious Bibb salad with a French pairing of white wine blend was very good.  Excellent bread basket and attentive service throughout.  Our next course of filet was superb.  A perfectly cooked melt in your mouth filet was accompanied by a delicious sauce and a small amount on garlic mashed potatoes.  We were surprised at the large portion of steak for the price point.   The pairing with this course was a red Shiraz from California.  I wasn't overly impressed with this selection, but it was acceptable.  Finally out third course included three full desserts.  Yes, three.  I was in dessert heaven.  Unfortunately too full to eat too much of it, but he chocolate cake is calling my name from our hotel fridge right now.

3330237,2015-10-06,2,MpovsyjkSkchD7ssAdEVKQ,"We were there this past weekend. We were staying at The Delano and wanted to go someplace for a good steak. Their website advertised ""best steakhouse..."" And they had such great Yelp reviews we thought we'd check it out. Here's what I expect when dining at a finer establishment 1) to be seated promptly at my reservation time 2) for the waiter to be polite and engaging 3) the food to be great enough that I want to return.
My husband ordered the spinach salad and I ordered the Bibb salad and we ordered the porterhouse for 2 that comes with truffled potatoes. The porterhouse comes with a $105 dollar price tag but since we wanted good steak that was fine. 
Both salads came out and both were underwhelming. My husbands spinach salad was ok but the dressing was overpowering even though they drizzle it in for you at the table. My Bibb salad was the opposite. It was supposed to come with bacon, my salad had 3 tiny scraps of it. The dressing was bland and the salad wasn't cold just more like room temperature. Bibb lettuce is best served cold to retain crispness. 
We ordered our steak medium as per the waiters recommendation. We wanted it slightly pink in the center. What we got was well done around the edges and rare in the middle and it wasn't good. It's a big portion but it just wasn't good. It had no flavor, it wasn't juicy and it was just bad. The potatoes were alright but again the flavors were very overwhelming instead of subtle. 
I have no idea why this steak house gets such great reviews. In my book the one thing that should have been delicious was a disaster. There was nothing good about the meal and the service was ok.",jWgLN7o6_UA_WrqKuzIWBA,1,0,1,X7803VYZbf6ct7CYA-yqXQ

3338642,2010-07-01,0,MpovsyjkSkchD7ssAdEVKQ,"Sure I was intrigued by the Wine Angels at Aureole in Vegas.  Who wouldn't  be?  Yet, was it enough to pull me into the restaurant?  As someone who usually finds ""special effects"" movies boring and lacking in substance, it left me a bit leery.  However, after years of hearing about how innovative Charlie Palmer is as a chef (some of these raves from friends whose opinions I value greatly) and watching his restaurant empire grow, I am happy to say I finally have tried not one, but two of his restaurants.  In order to give both of these restaurants the attention they deserve I am writing about them in two parts.  This, the first part, will detail my outing to Charlie Palmer Steak in Las Vegas.

Nestled inside the Four Seasons Hotel, it is a nice departure from the rest of the Vegas Scene.  Don't get me wrong, I do love the hustle, bustle and noise of the whole strip scene, but it is also nice to take a short break from it for a more refined experience.  That refined experience is definitely reflected in the decor of the restaurant. The arched doorways, ceilings and ochre walls hint at Southwestern Spanish Architecture, while the dark mahogany paneling and furnishings give it an Upper East Side Club Room feel.  The mix of these two styles work beautifully together in creating an atmosphere of relaxed elegance and sophistication; taking two old world styles and making them somehow modern.

I experienced Charlie Palmer Steak as a party of six. No, I didn't eat enough for six people (although it did feel like it), it was myself plus five others.  A table full of foodies with everyone wanting to try out as much as possible, we had a fairly wide range of the menu at our table.  I will do my best to cover as much of it as humanly possible. :)  Sadly the photos that I took did not come out (need to remember to bring a flash camera!).

While four in our party waited for the final two, we enjoyed a glass of Tamarack Cellars Merlot 2007 (nice full bodied with flavors of raspberry, black cherry and hints of chocolate) and took in the atmosphere.  When the final two arrived, the game began!! Not only did we order a full array of appetizers, but our crazy group made a special request to the chef to make us potato chips (not on the menu), and he did!!  And by the way, the freshly made potato chips were awesome.

On to the appetizers!!  I had the Wild Arugula Salad with Roasted Beets, Oregon Blue, Pecans and a Sherry Vinaigrette.  The arugula was fresh and crisp and the presentation was beautiful with slices of roasted beets and a puree of beet.  The combination of elements came together perfectly for a perfect salad.  The rest of the table shared several appetizers. The Ahi Tuna Carpaccio had barely hit the table when it disappeared and additional servings were immediately ordered (I think that says it all!!).  In rapid succession, Seared Hudson Valley Foie Gras, Oysters on the Half Shell and Brocconcini Mozzarella w/ Cured Tomatoes arrived at our table and were ooohed and aaaahed over.  Like the arugula salad, the presentations were just right and  inviting.  Everyone thoroughly enjoyed the appetizers which lived up to Charlie Palmer's image of being a pioneer of progressive American cuisine.   The fusion of classic American cooking with Soba Noodles and a ginger lime vinaigrette (Ahi Tuna Carpaccio) or Foie Gras and White Plum Tart expands the concept of American cuisine to a whole new level that left everyone chomping at the bit for the main course.

For the main course, Surf and Turf (Roasted Maine Lobster/Filet Mignon), Filet Mignon with Roasted Shallot Jus, American Kobe Beef Tartare and Crispy Skinned Japanese ""Suzuki"" Sea Bass were thoroughly enjoyed by the rest of our group.  I feasted on a plate composed of sides: Wild Mushrooms w/ Carmelized Onions, Garlic Broccolini and an order of the wonderful CP Steak Fries. just thinking about the amazing flavors on my plate is making my mouth water as I write this. There were also sides ordered for the table: Lobster Rice, Sauteed Spinach, more CP Steak Fries and a Truffle Baked Potato.  The Truffle Baked Potato was amazing, but so rich that I didn't have much room left but to have a small bite.

At this point I thought that I might have actually been restrained enough to leave the restaurant without having someone roll me out, but then dessert was ordered.  Everyone shared an order each of the Warm Summer Fruit Crisp, Strawberry Vanilla Ice Cream Terrine, Chocolate Peanut Butter Bar, Chocolate Brownie Sundae and a selection of Fruit Sorbets.  I initially swore to only take little tastes of each to be able to experience them, but my resolve was not strong enough and I hate to admit that I had more than a taste of each.  I just couldn't resist!!  

As we wrapped up our meal and prepared to leave, I had to admit that I was impressed with the entire meal, both presentation and ingenuity in blending flavors.

3364409,2014-01-07,0,MpovsyjkSkchD7ssAdEVKQ,"I can't begin to explain how disappointing this experience was.  Let's start with the food.

Based on other Yelp reviews, we ordered the fois gras as an appetizer.  It was interesting at best.  I thought the presentation of the fois gras was not very appetizing.  2.5 stars.

For the main course, we ordered the bone-in ribeye (we were at a steakhouse!) as well as a salmon dish for our daughter.  The salmon dish was worthy of 3 stars, not bad.  It came out lukewarm, which was okay for my daughter but now other diners would have liked it that way.

The rib-eye.  We ordered it medium.  The first one came out medium well plus (if you squinted you could see some pink).  It was the first night of our New Year's Eve vacation so we thought we should have it right.  We sent it back (in hindsight, a mistake).  The second one took a long time and when it came out it was rare (not medium rare...rare).  Just to make this wasn't our bias, we asked the manager to come to the table and asked him what he thought the meat temperature was and he said rare.  By this time, we had already eaten the sides, ate a lot of bread (which was actually very good), so didn't want to have the kitchen attempt #3.  The manager was very understanding and took the entree, as well as the other entree and sides off the bill.  All we ended up paying for was a bottle of wine and the appetizer.

The sides we ordered were brussel sprouts and onion rings.  I would give the brussel sprouts 4.5 stars and the onion rings 2 stars (about the level of a fast food restaurant in both appearance and taste).

The wine list was not very good.  Only moderate number of selections overall and very few good ones between $75-300.

Pretty sad that a upscale steakhouse can't get the meat temperature correct.",zl_-zhvO1SrTywpQ0pDphg,4,0,1,3Td52lQh8WDFLMLI2v-B4g

3473873,2014-01-08,3,MpovsyjkSkchD7ssAdEVKQ,"Probably the most overrated restaurant in Vegas.

Over the years I have had disappointing experiences at Charlie Palmers. I am a big fan of the Four Seasons... I have had great vacations at several of their properties. I have never understood why the Las Vegas Four Seasons has continued to maintain its asscoiation with the Charlie Palmer Restaurant... they aren't in the same league.

My latest foray was at Thanksgiving. When I learned that my parents made a booking at Charlie Palmers for Thanksgiving diner... I was disappointed. In the past I had several dinners there but was never impressed. About five or six years ago, prior to turning vegan, we had a Thanksgiving diner there and I remembered it as being extremely mediocre... I hadn't been back since. 

We had a booking for about twelve people. I called the restaurant two days prior to let them know about my families food restrictions... myself, my wife and my two daughters (10 &12 years old) are vegan. At first they said there was no way they could accommodate us and suggested we book somewhere else. Then when the Manager noticed that we would be canceling a group of twelve, she said she would check with the chef to see what he could do. She called back and said they the kitchen could offer us a choice of pasta with vegetables or a risotto for our main courses. I ordered the risotto for my wife and I, and the pasta with vegetables for my daughters.

After arriving for dinner... we ended up skipping the first course as their was no vegan option, then we were served a very plain salad. When our main courses arrived we all looked at each other with deep concern. What was presented did not look appealing. Well we all took a few bites... our risotto was flavorless mush... my daughters pasta hardly had any vegetables and was also flavorless. I thought they'd be the easy ones to please... they love pasta.

The food that was served was appalling... I have no idea how a chef in a first class restaurant would ever let such poor food leave their kitchen. 

Needless to say we walked out... we were all starving... so it was off to Yard House down the street. 

I eat out at numerous upscale restaurants and rarely do I have a problem getting a vegan meal. In fact Steakhouses often provide me with the best options.

I do not understand how a supposedely first class restaurant can make a commitment to provide a restricted meal, on Thanksgiving, and then make as little effort as possible to deliver a decent product.

Clearly there were red flags going up when I called ahead to make arrangements for our food restrictions... my mistake to not take heed.",Zu3iAO48TU-zOU_cL7BJSA,6,0,1,iXamYLSVc6krmKi9bBs7BA

The interior is quiet, elegant, and dimly lit -- perfect for a romantic night out or if you just want a dinner where you can converse with the rest of your party without screaming over music.

Our meal was one of the better RW dinners we've had. They started us out with a kobe style beef tartare amuse bouche.

The salad with caramelized black mission figs, Oregon blue cheese, and a sherry shallot vinaigrette was a great earthy mix of sweet, sharp and tart.

The petite sirloin was nicely charred and tender. It was accompanied by a butter poached lobster tail filled with stuffing and succulent lobster meat.

The dinner also included sides served family style. Both the sweet corn succotash and Russian banana fingerling potatoes were delicious.

Rounding out the meal was a creamy, and surprisingly light, citrus cheesecake with pistachio olive oil ice cream.

It was a great meal in a nice setting, but service was spotty. After being seated, we sat around for a good 10-15 minutes before we flagged a waiter down to take drink orders. After that, service was slightly more attentive, but far from a personalized, engaging experience. There were two waiters for our table and both seemed like they wanted to be elsewhere.

You'll find Charlie Palmer Steak in the Four Seasons Hotel part of Mandalay Bay, which probably explains why the restaurant is so expensive, even by Las Vegas steak house standards. 

We ordered two appetizers:

Corn chowder, which was delicious, filled with sweet corn, cream, and king crab.

Fresh oysters, which were indeed fresh, briny and terrific. 

For entrees, my wife ordered a filet mignon.  It was cooked and seasoned perfectly and my wife declared that it was one of the best steaks she has ever had.  We've tried many dozens of high-end steak houses around the country and specifically in Las Vegas, so that is saying a lot. 

I ordered a bone-in dry-aged strip steak, kind of pricey at $54, but also cooked and seasoned perfectly.  

Charlie Palmer also has an excellent wine list although the wine prices are exorbitant, but you'll definitely find a good bottle or two on the list.

Bring a shawl or wrap if you are sensitive to a draft and cool temperatures.  The Server told us the hotel ""upstairs"" manages the temp and the restaurant gets the shaft. Nothing can be done to warm things up, apparently.

The meal started with a mixed assortment of bread which included warm corn bread which was great. I actually loved every part of the meal, but especially the oxtail ravioli, and warm potato and leek soup. 

The ravioli were al dente and full of flavor while the soup was creamy and delicious. The soup was served table side? with a bowl of lobster (i actually didn't notice any caviar) presented first and the soup poured over the seafood for a nice presentation. It was actually a large portion and we didn't want to finish it for fear we couldn't eat the rest of our meal. 

The meat were divided into separate plates, and had a great char flavor to it. Again it was really dark so i couldn't really see the color of it. 

Along with the steak  we got the baked potato, which was more like mashed potatoes presented back in the potato skin. The truffle oil (i presume) made the potato tasted great and we destroyed it.

charlie palmers is a classic steak house joint.  meaning it's murky with candles and fine linens.   it's classy inside but not too full of itself. inside guys were clad in jackets or even  t-shirts and they even had the world series on near the coaches, albeit snowy and grainy.  (you would think a high end place like this would have an hd feed.)

a jovial waiter showed us to our tables.  my friends and i were famished from a day of loitering, gambling, and gawking so we tore into the bread.  to be honest i don't recall what it was but it satisfied us. between the four of us we ordered the filet mignon (2), rib eye, and a ny strip.  all these fancy steak houses say their steaks have been dry aged for x amount of days, weeks, years, decades, millenia, etc.  to me this reminds me of saying you can put lipstick on a pig but it's still a pig.  i'll stick to this assertion until i have a dry aged steak that knocks my socks off or beats what i can get back home in rural iowa.  

i sipped on a jack and coke to dull my hunger pains.  just as i finished off the second jack, my rib eye appeared.  it was shaped like africa and grilled medium rare, just the way i ordered it.  i let a  bit size piece sit in my mouth and waited.  as a steak connoisseur i relish this brief passage of time, from the moment a steak touches my taste buds and the info relayed  to my brain for decoding.  it's akin to watching a beauty pageant and waiting to see who will be the new queen and who will be the first runner up.  you really want a certain contestant a while back as your favorite to win but you never know  until the end.  it's the same with steak-you really want it to be great but never know.

and the winner is ...

not charlie palmer but a steak house to be named later.   the rib eye was tender and pink but it lacked the sweetness and depth that i'm looking for in a top notch steak.  to me it needed a bit more fat.  a sublime rib eye is marbled well which gives the steak flavor and a more lively texture.  my friends' filet mignon had a bit more taste which surprised me, but i've had better and even cheaper before.

all in all i think charlie palmers is still a solid place. their sides were outstanding with impeccable service. and the classy but non fussy ambiance is refreshing in vegas.  but i'm still searching for the perfect steak house.",XvDFIDtQHeeMzQg21KHUDQ,3,1,3,mvYXQ-k-7mdrEPR_IeYWgQ

What a disappointment! Service was OK but the meal was terrible. Maybe it was because it was a fixed price menu. They would not let us order off the regular menu. Our bill was over 700.00 for 4 I would gladly pay that for a great meal but this was a HUGE disappointment! My husband had to request 3 steak knifes before he got one that cut thru his steak!!!! And the reason we were given was they get dull in the dishwasher!!! This is suppose to be the BEST steakhouse in Vegas and you can't cut the steak! We have been in others where the steak cuts like butter.

We live in San Diego but I will literally fly back to Vegas just to go to Charlie Palmer Steak again. The service was probably the BEST service we have ever experienced. The sommelier gave us a quick description of the part of Italy where the wine was from.  I believe it was Steven, the manager, who personally had a wagyu burger made for my son (off menu). When it was a bit overcooked for him to eat, they took it off the bill- no questions asked.  We had planned to just take it home and my husband would eat it later!

3923464,2013-03-11,0,MpovsyjkSkchD7ssAdEVKQ,"Cliffs Notes: Service awful; food definitely not good enough to make up for it; poor value to boot.

Visited here as part of a group of 6. Visit coincided with Restaurant Week 2013, but that's not why we were there; nevertheless, the waiter immediately pushed that menu - he didn't even bring us the regular menu or wine list, only placing the Restaurant Week menu in front of us.

Right away some others in my party decided to do the Restaurant Week menu, and the waiter refused to allow others to order a la carte. I can understand requesting the entire table stick to the same tasting for a multiple-course extravaganza that makes serving different numbers of courses too awkward and difficult, but a 3-course appetizer/entrée/dessert combo is typical enough that it just should not be a problem.

Service continued to be very bad throughout the night. There's just too much that went wrong to list, but highlights include:  A busser clumsily refilling waters all night, splashing me once and another party member twice; a nearly 40-minute wait for the steak; said steak winding up being severely undercooked anyway; a food runner managing to drop two pieces of bone marrow onto a party member's dress and not even bothering to pick the pieces off the floor, leaving them scattered around our feet; and nearly getting run over by a waiter hurriedly pushing his serving table around a corner, him having to stop so suddenly that utensils flew off the side. The raw volume of problems combined with the staff's generally blasé attitude show a systemic customer service issue at the restaurant, probably due to lack of sufficient standards and training.

As far as the actual food, the potato leek soup was pretty good as was the truffle scalloped potatoes - but the steak was just way too salty and over-seasoned (and again, severely undercooked - as in gushing red when I requested medium rare). The salad and dessert were just OK. The wine pairings tasted awful and were a horrible deal at $25. Reading other reviews here, maybe it was supposed to have been a ""bottomless"" wine pairing, but this was not explained to our table nor were we offered refills. I certainly would have chosen a quality-over-quantity alternative for wine had it been mentioned. Maybe people who just want to get toasted off cheap wine are the ones who appreciate it.

Given my good experience at Aureole a few years ago, this was certainly very disappointing. I would normally feel inclined to try the regular menu to give the place a second chance, but the numerous service issues and lack of concern demonstrated by the staff leave me disinterested.",65Bcz8_Rbbrcz_HGpq9Y-g,4,0,1,EX87oxFWgShXKD4_k-monw

3973954,2013-03-15,2,MpovsyjkSkchD7ssAdEVKQ,"*** Review is for Spring 2013 Restaurant Week menu ***


First the food:

The bread basket was brought a fair amount of time after I ordered.  I was told there was honey wheat, ciabatta, white, something else, and their homemade corn bread. As you can see from the photo, the basket was mostly corn bread which was good, but another piece of bread was just plain.

For the first course,  I ordered the potato leek soup with lobster, sour cream dumplings, and jalapeño bacon crumbles.  The dish was presented as a bowl with the lobster, dumplings, and bacon in the bowl and then the soup was poured from a server onto the ingredients listed.  I was asked if I wanted some freshly ground pepper.  When I said yes, the server began a hunt to find a pepper grinder.  Evidently they had been put away from the day before and hadn't been brought back out.  The soup wasn't very hot.  The dumplings were the best part of the soup.  I also liked the bacon.  As you chewed it, the jalapeño flavor was released and left a little heat in your mouth for the next spoon of soup.

There was no choice for the main course.  It was Australian Waygu strip steak with a bone marrow flan and some wine reduction.  I ordered my steak black and blue.  It came out medium rare.  The steak looked a bit like a rectangular hockey puck and it cut about the same.  Inside, it was tender, but the outside was damn tough.  The flavor of the steak was nothing that I'd remember past the immediate bite I was consuming.  It was bland, also.

Course 3 consisted of two sides--asparagus and truffled pave potatoes.  The potatoes were absolutely the blandest thing I could eat.  I ate the truffle pieces that were on the top and enjoyed that the most.  Pave potatoes is their slang for fancy, stacked, thinly cut potato slices with no flavor.  The asparagus was OK.  It was crisp and better than being cooked until it's soft and mushy.  

For dessert, you had a choice of cheesecake or cheesecake.  The menu was different from their Restaurant Week menu online.  The mascarpone cheesecake on carrot coulis had some sorbet and pineapple pieces.  It was good.  It was not the chocolate peanut butter bar I was hoping to order.

The service:

I was stunned by the lackadaisical manner of the staff that served me last night.  I saw my waiter twice, when I ordered and when he brought the bill.  I saw the person who delivered bread and non alcohol drinks 3 times, once with the bread and twice for iced tea.  I saw a bus person three times when he came to remove dishes.  

The score for my pink wrapper test was 50/50.  One test was a fail and one was a pass.  No one came by to ask how the meal was.  I waited a long time before the liquid person came to ask if I wanted some more iced tea.  In short, people just didn't seem to care.  I had more conversation and rapport with the young woman seated at the table next to me than I did the staff.

When my server brought the bill, I asked him to do me a favor.  I asked him to tell the chef that medium rare was not black and blue.  He hesitated for a few seconds as if things didn't connect and then said, ""Oh, it was cooked too much?""  He left the table and never said another word.  It was then that I started to fill out the comment card, something I rarely do.  When the server came back with my credit card slips, he curiously removed the salt and pepper shakers from the table.  Did it look like I was going to slip them into my pocket?

As for the ambience of the place, it was nouveau dark as this photo shows:

http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/charlie-palmer-steak-las-vegas-3#ZR8UVgbVry2CagHkQEp4lA

For some reason, after I was there for about 15 minutes, the lights came up half bright for about two minutes and then went back down to this level.  Cozy, romantic, and very dark are all appropriate words.  What really got me the most was looking toward the other room and seeing the reflection of a basketball game.  It was coming from the bar/lounge.  Can't we do without TV in a restaurant like this.  This just bugs me to no end.  If I wanted to eat in a sports bar, I would have.

I really was disappointed by this whole evening.  With so many great steakhouses on the Strip, I won't be returning to Charlie Palmers.",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,8,1,2,QHWZrxOdGeoymSnsfJc2VA

The nice thing about Charlie Palmer Steak is the slightly laid back ambiance. Not nearly as stuffy as Mastro's. People are in Vegas for a reason. 

Normally a Rib Eye man, but had the 16oz. New York Strip medium rare, and did not disappoint one bit. Sides: Had the Potatoes Au Gratin and Brussel Sprouts/Pancetta. Desserts: Had the Chocolate Peanut Butter cake and the Apple Tart with ice cream and caramel. The tart was definitely the stand out of the night.

4012981,2013-03-15,0,MpovsyjkSkchD7ssAdEVKQ,"Restaurant Week 2013.  

I was ready this year!  Last year I ate at Verandah for Restaurant Week Fall 2012 and so I knew where to park (the big lot outside!).  I had a late reservation from overdosing on fun the last two nights but also since my friend gets off at 9:00pm.  in short, Palmer Steak is closed on Sunday's and I'm guessing the staff was pooped out from a long week because the service was nothing like we had at Verandah last year.  

I don't know why but we had butt squeezing seats last year, this layout looked exactly like Verandah and once again I get a butt squeezing seat!  Damnit, next time I'm going to be picky with the seat.

But onto the food, my soup was good.  The soup for my first course was a potato lobster soup.  The dropped sour cream and bacon crumble inside added a wonderful taste to it.  Bravo, I love soup with this chilly type of weather.  The main attraction was supposed to be the Australian Wagyu Strip Steak, I don't know.  Maybe I would have to see this cut before believing it was a short cut portion of an Australian Strip Steak.  Loved the asparagus and potato that came with it, these always pair well with steak.  Dessert was the peanut butter sandwich thing placed on top of a dark chocolate sauce with an added scoop of dulce de leche ice cream.  I liked it but I really wanted the cheesecake!  

In all, I came here because of everyone's raving reviews last year.  Unfortunately, I couldn't really taste the fat through the meat of the medium rare steak?  I love RW because it affords us the opportunity to try different restaurants I would normally not give a second thought to.  And the biggest thing for me is that it may make me a regular returning customer, I may return again to try their Cut of the Week that the server was explaining to us but we'll see!

We loved our bone-in rib-eye steak with a side of truffle potato and garlic jus sauce and whipped horseradish cream.

Their roasted cauliflower and spicy peppers were good but waaay too salty.

Their creme brulee was the best desert of the night...made with tiny bits of real fruit and golden crusted NOT burnt.

The other members of our party loved their key lime pie dessert.

I did wish that the chocolate peanut butter dessert tasted more peanut buttery.

Yes, this place was expensive, but not out of the price range of the upscale Las Vegas steak houses.

4048634,2016-06-15,3,MpovsyjkSkchD7ssAdEVKQ,"Couple of friends and I wanted to go to a Steakhouse for Restaurant Week this year and after seeing that Charlie Palmer offered a pretty good deal, we couldn't resist! We're glad we did because this place did not disappoint!

We parked at Mandalay Bay and walked over to the Four Seasons, whose entrance is located by the lobby of MB. Once you're in the Four Seasons, the restaurant is located on the lower floor so take the grand stairwell and you will be led towards Charlie Palmer and their other restaurant, Veranda. 

We were immediately welcomed as we walked in. We made a reservation a couple days before and it was a nice touch of them to acknowledge us by name. We were seated and handed their regular menu and their RW 2016 menu. 

With the RW Menu I went with:
Billi Bi Soup- WINNER OF THE NIGHT. The soup is first presented to you with just the mussels and garnish then the soup is poured in front of you. The soup was creamy, delicious, and full of flavor! 
Surf & Turf- Meat was tender, juicy, and well-seasoned. Really enjoyed the lobster stuffing that accompanied the decently sized piece of lobster meat. It had an interesting taste that really complemented the taste of the steak!
Lemon Tart- Best way to end the meal, tart but light!

We all received a glass of red wine and white wine to pair with our appetizer and entree. And in case you were wondering...yes, it was a bottomless wine. Between the five of us, we also received 3 sets of Creamed Corn and Mashed Potato to share which was more than enough for us! 

Service was also flawless! Our server Reymond stopped by our table regularly to make sure everything turned out great, the bussers immediately filled our water glasses whenever it's almost empty, and their management team even stopped by that we were well-taken care of! 

Overall, everything was amazing! Considering the price we are paying for Restaurant Week, we received PLENTY of food that left us leaving happy and stuffed!",uS2rQ9oyAJ1nOMbL0YL2lg,3,3,5,jrYOt2FutXN_70m4T7Yc5g
4060928,2014-09-22,0,MpovsyjkSkchD7ssAdEVKQ,"Probably the best meal we had in Vegas.

Our group of 9 girls had an early reservation for our first night in town, and we all agreed it was easily the best meal we had in during our four-day stay.  We all ended up doing one of the prix fixe menus because they were an AMAZING deal.  Three courses plus bottomless wine pairings? Yes please!

My bone-in filet was cooked perfectly, and the sides were amazing as well. We left the restaurant pleasantly full and ready to start our night.

The only service misstep was at the end of the evening. When paying, we asked if it was possible to separate some of the check (annoying I know. We were prepared for a 'no', but wanted to ask anyway).  The server was visibly frustrated and snapped at us ""you'll have to give me some time if that's what you want.""  We ended up just putting it all on one card as we had a show reservation to make and needed to get out of there.  I understand that it was annoying to the server, but at a restaurant of this caliber I wouldn't expect a server to snap at patrons or show visible annoyance no matter what the request.

4061583,2017-06-28,1,MpovsyjkSkchD7ssAdEVKQ,"I'm reviewing on the restaurant week menu that seemed like an amazing value at $50 with a bottomless wine pairing.  Stopped in with my old school classy wine friends to catch up!

Service: 4/5 Our main server and his assistants provided the service I'd expect from a high end steakhouse.  We didn't feel like we were treated differently because we were ordering from the restaurant week menu.  They kept the wine glasses filled throughout the evening and the entrees came out in a timely manner with a smile.

Food: 4/5  Below is the Restaurant week $50 Dinner Menu
Market Salad - Fresh Vegetables and dressing and served at perfect chilled temperature
Surf + Turf - Smaller portions expected and that's what we received but both the lobster and the petite filet mignon were very tasty.  There was more Lobster stuffing vs Lobster but was still good overall.  I had my Filet Mignon medium rare and it was perfect.
Sides - Creamed Spinach and mashed potatoes came out family style and the portions were more than enough to the 4 of us
Key Lime Tart -  I enjoyed the tart while as it was not too sweet.  My friends were hit or miss with it.
Truffle Mac N Cheese - We couldn't resist and I'm glad we ordered it.  A smaller serving than anticipated but very, very tasty.  Highly recommended and for me cheese = bae

Value: 5/5 $50 for a high quality meal and 6+ glasses of wine was excellent.

Ambiance: High End Steak house steelo with lots of wood and dim lighting to set the mood.  Not noisy but definitely not quiet either with tables of patrons talking.  Great ambiance to match the Four Seasons Hotel it was located in.

For restaurant week, Charlie Palmer by far has had the best offering overall.  The bottomless wine pairing can't be beat but the premium food and ambiance really makes this offering an incredible value.  The courses were small in portion, but rich in flavor that left us stuffed. We'll update the review with a non-restaurant week visit in the near future.

First course -Tuscan Salad Baby arugula, buffalo mozzarella, aged balsamic paired with Pinot grigio Italy 2011

Main course -Whole roasted all natural Rib Eye with root veggie and red wine natural sauce. Paired with Atea Evodia Spain 2010

Sides: Parmesan potato gratin and white clamshell mushrooms

We were seated at a small table. Luckily my husband asked to move so that we could easily enjoy our meal with all the elbow room needed. We started off with the oysters and tuna tartar. Everything was on point and I could have had another half dozen oysters easily. They put just enough salt on the oysters to give it enough flavor. Tuna tartar was great! No stringy bits and it went down pretty smoothly. 

I wanted the surf and turf and that is what I got. My filet was pretty dang tender at medium rare and the lobster was good. The ritz cracker stuffing with the lobster wasn't my favorite though. It was really salty. My husband requested his steak to be medium rare as well but it looked like medium well to me. He didn't want to send it back and it was gone by the time I finished so I assumed he enjoyed it somewhat.  The Parmesan potatoes were a bit of a disappointment. It looked delish but the lack of seasoning was a turn off. It just tasted like mashed potatoes with no flavoring and a cheese crust on top. The artichokes were ok. It was nothing worth yelping about. I asked my husband how the sausage tasted in the artichoke and he said that I wouldn't  have enjoyed it. It looked like Vienna sausages from a can. 

The s'mores bar was on the cut of the week menu (which is neat and budget friendly). I asked for that and they made it happen. It wasn't overly sweet and pretty good. The cookie ice cream sandwich was alright. I love soft cookies and I know hard cookies work well with ice cream sandwiches. 

Overall service was good. It did take some time for them to pick up my check but they have a lot of people working there. I am just not sure I would choose CP as my go to steakhouse. 

PS. The Pom martini was delish!",sa5zd7bwBQzajQB48Y9SUw,4,3,4,6UykDx54pTsnbs6r0rgECQ

My fiancé and I celebrated my birthday here last night and we were amazed by our experience.  The romance of the room is created with the dim lighting and touch of red in the chairs.  We were given in my option one of the best tables in the house, a corner booth. Our waiter was beyond friendly and helped us pick our dinner. 

We started off with champagne for the celebration and our taste buds were delighted with the ahi tuna appetizer.  I went all out and ordered the ribeye oscar style.  One of the best steaks I have ever had.  Of course the ribeye is a generous size so I get to continue the experience at home with my left overs.  For dessert, we ordered the fresh berries and a cappuccino.  It was a perfect ending to our perfect meal.

We were beyond tickled when the manager and chief checked on us to make sure we were enjoying our night and meal.

Charlie Palmer is another top of the line steak house that Vegas has to offer. The food is fantastic, the decor is elegant (as you would expect situated in a Four Seasons property), but not ostentatious. The service was great.

I judge a business by how they treat their customers and I can attest that CP values the patrons that walk through their doors. I've been here several times with my girlfriend, and we have always had a pleasant time, with the exception of one off night. I sent a nicely written email to their customer service explaining that the night seemed off in a way and let them know that I would still be coming back regardless. The way they handled that email sets this company apart from so many others.

The assistant GM got into contact with me and went above and beyond anything I imagined. Adam's actions on behalf of the company all but assured that CP will have a very long time customer in myself.

The food is better than N9NE and the staff is knowledgeable and attentive. If you get a chance to check out Charlie Palmer Steak in Four Seasons, do yourself a favor and go.

If you are budget conscious, they have the Michael Jackson Prix Fixe menu with unlimited wine pairing for $49.00 per person or the Cut of the Week with unlimited wine pairing for $48.00 per person. Last weeks cut was a deliciously prepared t-bone, cooked to perfection. I could go spend more than that on alcohol alone anywhere else.

This is a great date night spot or a place to get together with friends for delicious food and conversation, but don't take my word for it. Check it out yourself! (anyone catch the Reading Rainbow reference?)",0gVZ1P_TkOUwwcaYVAScPw,4,1,5,eLohouoai-RB-ABmYoJtew

Make reservations ahead of time and you should have no issue with being seated when you arrive.

We had cocktails before dinner, and then chose to order from the extensive wine list.  If you ask for the Sommelier and it's JB, he will be able to guide you through the list with ease, and you will be delighted with his extensive knowledge and exceptional service!  Our server was not as personable or as charming as JB, but he did make sure we were happy with our dining experience throughout the meal.

The menu is simple, with a few unique updates on the classic steakhouse fare, nothing too flashy, but a refreshing take on old favorites.  Below are a few highlights from our dining experience:

Chef's Choice Sashimi :: Buttery yellowtail with a light, tangy ponzu that cut through the richness of the fish perfectly - a definite must try!

Seafood Tower :: Overflowing with seafood, the crab legs and oysters were my favorite!  Comes with a light cocktail sauce and plenty of horseradish.  The shrimp were a bit overcooked for my taste, but they were huge and full of fresh flavor.

Kagoshima, Japan Kobe Striploin :: My husband did not leave one bite left on the plate!  It was cooked to a perfect medium rare, accompanied by a red wine sauce that was just as good as the steak.  A rich dish, so come hungry if you plan on ordering it.

Sorbet Tasting :: Light & SO refreshing!  Really unique flavors, a great way to have a bit of something sweet after a decadent meal.

Overall Charlie Palmer is a steakhouse oasis tucked away in the Four Seasons Resort that is definitely worth a visit!  Cheers!",90sTc0TQ7F1Uj5NGiIE30Q,1,1,4,hxE71uDzF6vkct1kFpbLrw

The ambiance is elegant and quiet--a welcome change in Vegas for most. The service is excellent--attentive and warm without being overly present. Cocktails were perfect. We know Charlie Palmer from his Healdsburg location. The menu is similar to a lot of steak houses, where you order the flesh part ($$$$) and then pay for sides which are usually enough for a number of people. I saw from Yelper reviews that they had a prix fixe but the waiter did not give us this menu until I asked for it? Oversight? Maybe, who knows. Anyway that prix fixe is a great deal. For $58, it's three courses with the steak cut of the week, sides, a beautiful dessert and get this ""a bottomless wine glass."" Two of my party had this and when the sommelier kept coming over with different wines we were like, ""I think you're at the wrong table."" Not paying attention to detail, we had missed the bottomless wine line! Prices are high--it's Vegas, go big or leave the strip? Not being a steak person I had a pretty amazing spinach salad that was blessed with a softly cooked egg and insanely good mustard dressing on the side. I also had a pasta appetizer that was just OK. They will do a good job cooking your steak just they way you want it, and considering the wildly expensive Vegas prices, it hits the mark nicely.

The location inside of The Four Seasons made this very easy for a weeknight meal. The Four Seasons is easy to access since it isn't in the middle of the Strip and all of the traffic. We were immediately greeted by a valet and told that the $24 valet fee would be waived since we were dining at the hotel. The restaurant is a very short walk from the front door. I liked that I didn't have to walk through a casino to access this restaurant.

The host at the front warmly greeted us as soon as he seated the party in front of us. He provided us Restaurant Week menus as well as the regular menu. The regular menu looked great for a future visit, but we were set on RW for this visit.

The service was excellent from start to finish. Our waiter was professional and timely. We were checked on regularly, drinks refilled constantly, and all courses were presented with an explanation of what we were being served. The service definitely met if not exceeded the level of service one expects at a steakhouse.

The bread basket that is brought out before the courses was great. There was a nice olive bread, cornbread, and a regular crusty bread. All of the breads were delicious. The Bibb Lettuce Salad was simple with some bacon and ranch, but was good. The RW menu also included bottomless wine. We were served white with the salad and red with the main course. The red was on the dry side and was my favorite of the two.

The Surf & Turf was very, very good. The steak was prepared perfectly with a well seasoned char on the outside and tender meat inside. The stuffed lobster had nice pieces of lobster and crab with a tasty stuffing. The jalapeno creamed corn was very tasty and the jalapeno didn't overwhelm the other flavors. The smashed potatoes were good, but not the most exciting side this restaurant offers. The finale to the meal came in the form of a Lemon Tart.

The restaurant gives a classic feel - tables dressed in white tablecloth and dim lighting to set an intimate atmosphere.

I wish I remembered our server's name! He provided us menus, waters, and gave some great recommendations. We started off with a bottle of the David Arthur Cabernet (Cab is my personal favorite paired with steak and this Cab was phenomenal!) and took a moment looking over the menu. We wanted to split the Porterhouse for 2 but unfortunately they were sold out for the evening. We decided to go for the NY Strip Steak and a couple sides.

- Bread basket
Came out shortly after our waters. A variety of breads (cornbread, rye, sourdough and others) served with butter. My friend loved the cornbread!

- Truffle Mac & Cheese
Strong truffle flavor but that's to be expected - you can never go wrong with Mac & Cheese! Very creamy and delicious

- Sautéed Spinach
Holy sodium overload! For someone who loves salt, this side dish was a bit salty even for me. It was sautéed in garlic which gave it a nice flavor, however, the garlic was overpowered by the salt 

- NY Strip Steak
Cooked to perfection. I asked for mine medium and my friend asked for medium rare and the chef cooked the temperature exactly the way we wanted. The meat was incredibly flavorful, tender, and juicy!

Our server stopped by throughout our dinner to check on us which was nice. There were also several others who came by to replenish our waters. What very attentive servers!

Overall I enjoyed Charlie Palmer. I would give 5 stars for the elegant ambiance, excellent service, and juicy NY Steak - 2 stars for the sodium enriched Sautéed Spinach. Highly recommend a different side if you decide to dine here!",WJhQpdUHoFCtpU6gHFjVlQ,15,10,4,pzArWMtts61p3arLGTBBGg

4525841,2013-01-14,0,MpovsyjkSkchD7ssAdEVKQ,"Greetings fellow yelpers!  I've been on a bit of a hiatus from yelp due to my busy schedule.  However, that doesn't mean that I haven't been eating excellent food for the past couple of months.  So I am back to review some of the restaurants I've been to.

The wife decided we should check this joint out and thanks to all of you yelpers, we went for the cut of the week special.  Its 3 courses and bottomless wine pairing.  Pretty good deal for such a high end restaurant.

We started out with a salad that was disappointing.  Iceberg lettuce, tomato, beet, and feta? cheese, and a vinagrette.  The salad looked sloppily made and the beets were sliced into these very large chunks.  The wife is a salad lover and she did not finish her plate.  That says it all.  Came with a pinot grigio.

The main course was Osso Bucco and it came with sides of haricot verts and polenta.  I thought the Osso Bucco was very tender and flavorful, nice deep rich gravy to with it.  Then the wife gave me a slice of her Osso Bucco.  Tough, dry, lacking in flavor.  Very disappointed that such a highly thought of restaurant could not cook two Osso Bucco the same way.  I was going to give this restaurant a 4 star review but after tasting the wife's Osso Bucco, I docked it a star.  The polenta was nice and creamy and the haricot verts were cooked just perfectly... crisp and clean flavor.  Came with a french blend red.

For dessert we had a carrot cheesecake with a coconut lime sorbet on top..... perfect.  Gave it a slight tartiness to go with the creamy cheesecake.

As I said, if I had only eaten my own meal I probably would have given it 4 stars but the wife's Osso Bucco was so over cooked that my wife is probably writing her review and giving this joint 2 stars.",MJ0Wphhko2-LbJ0uZ5XyQA,0,0,3,txLZ82URSPiZ8cEH1lHHEQ
4526838,2015-08-14,0,MpovsyjkSkchD7ssAdEVKQ,"Easily one of the two or three best restaurants in all of Vegas.  Located in the ultra elegant Four Seasons, you are treated like a high-roller as soon as you pull up in your cab and the doormen greet you.  The restaurant is exactly what I want when I go to a high-end joint.  Quiet, dimly lit, and inviting.  They even sometimes have live piano music.

The best thing I can say about an upscale restaurant is that it knows how to be classy without being snobby.  On one summer trip, I did not plan to go anywhere ""fancy,"" so I did not pack long pants.  I called and asked if I could come in shorts.  Without hesitating, I got this response: ""Yeah, sure, just come in.""  Hello???  One of my biggest gripes is restaurants that insist you dress up in long pants and a blazer in 110-degree weather.

But all this would be meaningless if not for the food.  On my first visit, I started with the foie gras, brilliantly accompanied by - get this - a mini pineapple upside down cake!  If you know foie gras, its fatty richness pairs exceptionally well with something sweet and fruity.  This is among the best I ever had.  I was jealous of my friend's gorgeous Caesar salad, plated in an original way I never saw before.  I had it on my second visit, and it was killer.

Though a steakhouse, I have never had a steak here.  I am sure they are great, but I cannot resist their stuffed whole lobster.  At $70.00, it is as good a deal as you can expect at a restaurant like this.  And it is big - and best, it is shelled for you.  The least messy lobster you will ever eat.  The Ritz cracker stuffing - which initially gave me pause - is delicious.  A little melted butter (okay, a lot), some lemon, and a little salt is all you need to put you in lobster nirvana.

If you are a foodie like me who thinks great steak and lobster are the hallmark of a superior restaurant, you will not regret dining at Charlie Palmer.  Outback this ain't!",Fu8KXUDLOvNkxr7xWme7Ag,0,0,5,hV-XiE3YtXOmgQTsgkvoXw

We went for the steakhouse classics: Shrimp Cocktail, Caesar Salad, Steak and Potato. Such a straightforward menu, executed to absolute perfection. The shrimp were wild Baja prawns that were big (not too big) and delicious. The Caesar salad was so snappy, crisp, with creamy dressing (not too much) and garlicky. The filet was simply seasoned and cooked perfectly. I opted for the Au Gratin and my wife got the mashed - not sure which was better. I loved my Au Gratin - which were broiled on top to provide a little crunch. I also got a bleu cheese sauce on the side that was to die for. The wine list had a good variety of big and small wines. I am fully aware that I sound as if I work at the restaurant, but I don't. I simply wanted to give props where props are due. I am a businessman and I have to go out to a lot of dinners over the course of the year. I can safely say that this was one of the best meals I've ever had.

In short, everything was fantastic. The ambience was dark and romantic with cozy booths. The service was friendly and attentive without being overbearing. The food, wine pairings, and cocktails were completely on point. We wanted steak and we got tender, juicy steak.

We had their three course ""Cut of the Week"" dinner with unlimited wine ($48/person). It was funny because we had heard about the three course from a friend (which was also the reason why we decided to try it), but we probably would have never known otherwise. It's not on the menu and our waiter didn't even mention it, but it really is a great meal at a great price. The only other place it was mentioned was on the board outside the restaurant.

We had the endive salad, the hanger steak with corn succotash and mashed potatoes, and a raspberry chocolate dessert. I was really impressed with the salad, steak, and sides (not really a dessert person). Everything was flavorful, well-balanced, and tasty! The only problem was that service was never around even though there were only like four tables! We kept trying to flag down a server and they would just be standing around conversing in the corner. The wine was okay but not spectacular, but at unlimited refills I am not complaining.

I'd definitely recommend this place for a meal. The food is excellent (and with unlimited wine to boot!) and memorable, but just be wary of the service (which is why it's a 3 instead of 4).",oEvsA_IvL0yRyI7d4lT-IA,1,0,3,5EAQX61aFt2VtnOuunRqZg

Most had the cut of the week deal for the bottomless wine, but the veal osso bucco ended up being pretty solid.  The tomato soup was meh.  The stone fruit trifle was not bad.  The wines were meh also, but what can you expect from an AYCD wine offering.

The great thing is that they allowed the diners who didn't order from the prix fixe menu to join in on the bottomless wine.  All-in-all, we had a great time.  Good food, good service.  Wouldn't hesitate to eat here again.

1) We were seated quickly for our reservation
2) Waited 10 minutes for a server to come over.
3) Waited 10 minutes to get one drink from the bar, the server forgot about it.
4) Ordered a glass of wine, the server never brought it, we had to ask someone else to help us. This also took 10 minutes. We are at 30 minutes for two drinks and a server to come to the table.
5) Seafood appetizer came out with no small forks that were needed to eat it.

At this point we made a observation/complaint that the service was horrible. Shortly after the GM came over and poured a bottle of wine and apologized. Although they tried to make up for this diabolical when going to a fine dining establishment it should not have gotten this far in the first place. 
6) The filet's were tough and had little to no flavor. I have cooked better ones on my grill that I have purchased from the grocery store.

I give it a two out of five because when you go to this type of restaurant the service should not falter and the food should be of a certain quality. In this particular case Charlie Palmer Steak failed.",alTEAtRFUY3tU7RmjKP_zQ,1,0,2,wMP9AN_An1DCC2CO3EzV3w

The restaurant has simple neutral colored decor but still elegant. It is a little romantic with its dimmed lights and red accents. Comparable in price to all steakhouses in Vegas but just tucked away a bit because Four Seasons does not have a casino. Little foot traffic is always good for convenience though! 

I had the Bibb Salad. Filet Mignon, sides galore, and Hazelnut Bar. 

The salad was tasty. Again, clean simple flavors. Appropriate portion. 
The Filet was good. It was cooked very well. I wouldn't say it was the best steak I ever had but the sides made up for that. 
Of the sides we got I recommend the mushrooms, whipped potato or au gratin (BOTH Great), and haricot verts! 
To end the night, I had the hazelnut bar with was delicious. It was so good and although it is about the size of a snicker bar I think it's perfect for two.

I recall having a 7- or 8-course prix fixe dinner at Valentino in Santa Monica that, after tax and tip, cost something like $230 for two people. That was a memorable experience, and one that I will talk about and cherish forever.

But with this restaurant, you spend that amount (or, in our case, more: a new record of $250 for two people!) to get a 3- or 4-course dinner that meets expectations but does not surpass them in any way. To use a sports analogy, Charlie Palmer finishes the golf course at par, when you really hoped it would sink a hole in one somewhere along the way.

The starter? Good.
The steak? Good.
The cocktail? Good.
The dessert? Good.

But nothing was great or mind-blowing or made you close your eyes and just go, ""Mmm... delicious."" The decor was basic -- it felt like I was in a hotel, when I really wanted to be transported to another world and forget where I was.

And I couldn't believe how lax they were with the dress code. My friend and I showed up in our best, and were dismayed to see couples walk in where the guy wasn't wearing a tie or had his shirt untucked or was wearing jeans or, in one case, khaki shorts! I feel these people should be turned away at the door -- it definitely makes the place feel less classy.

Would I eat there again? No. That doesn't mean it's bad -- not at all. It's just, for me, not worth the price. I'd rather have something that leaves a bigger impression on my senses than on my wallet.",5gyWm65pkaKCcElAGP8Q7w,1,0,3,uxUkfn4eIy9A0DStmGrNOA

Flat iron steak was tough. And small. For $42? Bzzzt! Fail. I can see how they were trying to have a fancy marinade, but it didn't quite do it and certainly didn't compensate for the cheap feel of my cut of steak.

Truffle Mac & Cheese. Underwhelming. And odd. For $12? Seriously? If you're going to attempt a gourmet twist on comfort food, it's at least got to be better than the comfort food itself! Not a good sign if M&C from Dickey's BBQ is richer and creamier and yummier.

Scalloped potatoes. Meh. Lame. Definitely not the cheesy, bubbly delight I remember from years ago. I guess I can excuse them because they must have been those dehydrated ones from a box from the supermarket.

Noticed a wine stain on the tablecloth just after we were seated. Or was it ketchup? They moved us to a new table.

I'm not going to say it was horrible. The bread basket was fine. The ambience was fine. Service was fine. Gets one star due to lack of value for the money.

The food is delicious and they are always switching up the menu items and keeping it fresh. This is sometimes a negative because last year's salmon over lobster risotto was an absolute to die for dish. Dishes like filet mignon are a mainstay. This year's Ritz cracker stuffed 2 lbs lobster took the winning medal. It was so filling that my husband barely ate any of the sides we ordered (lobster fried rice, sautéed spinach, and au gratin potatoes).

We celebrated our anniversary last night and they had champagne for us. We figured that was ""the treat"" as we know from previous years they always do something special like a dessert. This year they topped it and then some. After being deliciously stuffed to the brim with our meal we decided to forego dessert, but I still had to have my coffee (opted for the latte). Well, next thing we knew our server brought us cheesecake (I don't know flavor, but delic!) and two chocolate chip cookie ice cream sandwiches. Unbelievable. They truly made our night special.

The service was spotty, we were not even sure who our server was as no one introduced themselves or greeted us. I  actually felt that i was in a Game of Thrones episode and the waiter was one of the faceless men. Does the waiter have a name? i guess not!

In any event, we  proceeded to order our meal from the faceless brethren, i ordered a NY strip, medium and my wife an 8oz filet. To my horror, my strip steak came out covered in cloves of sauteed garlic! Not what i requested, or would ever do to a prime cut of beef. 
The faceless waiter said he could scrap the garlic off and ""re-fire"" the steak. Are you kidding me? At $58 they should have replaced the steak. So they re-fired the steak, which I had to politely return once again, as it was so chewy and was almost impossible to cut without rocking the table. Perhaps i should have ordered the oysters, clams and cockles? 

It was at this time, I was approached by a faceless manger. Does the manager have a name? Nope! How can the lack of social graces in what is supposed to be a high end establishment be so prevalent? I mean you don't have to know my name but please introduce yourself and make a party feel welcome.

To their credit, they did eventually replace the steak, and got me a beer for my inconvenience. 

Does this restaurant have a name? Yes, Overrated!

5095005,2017-10-13,20,MpovsyjkSkchD7ssAdEVKQ,"Year in year out, a solid steakhouse that never fails to impress.

No DJs playing, no 64 ounce food challenges, just one kind of wagyu (albeit a stunning A5 from Kagoshima) and just a handful of cuts of American beef.   The most exciting change, The addition of a butchers cut.  Charlie Palmer steak is becoming a true classic steakhouse, solid in every respect.

Very minimal raw bar selections. Requisite fresh seasonal oysters on the half shell and jumbo prawns cocktail with a nice horse radish imbued cocktail sauce.  Salads, yes. Starters, yes.  None sampled ever, as the menu beckons you to beef.

Steaks are USDA prime and very well trimmed.  Excellent searing, even cooking, always to temp.  The flatiron, a butchers cut, is incredibly tender with excellent beefy flavor. Want more beer flavor? The dry aged bone in strip is excellent. Although the dry aging is not prolonged, the resulting beef has a slight nutty, blue cheese funk and pronounced umami notes.  Keep the sauces away from this one or the complexity will be lost.

The Kagoshima A5 ribeye is outstanding. Like others from the region, this is extremely sweet, the fat viscous, not cloying in the mouth with a clean, mild beefy flavor.  Order this extremely rare for the best enjoyment. The price has actually fallen since last reviewed, ($30/oz, 3oz minimum).  Unless you are really hungry, do not order more than 6 ounces. The beef is extremely rich and will fill you up.

Excellent, moist pork chop. Thick cut, cooked medium, nice pork flavored. The standout however is the Ritz cracker stuffed Maine lobster. A blast from the past, but the buttery, distinctive Ritz cracker flavor, soaking up all the lobster goodness that goes so well with the sweet, just cooked through tail meat.

Standard steakhouse sides. Top props to the potato gratin and extremely buttery Yukon Gold purée.

Impeccable steakhouse service. Friendly and proper.

Very good wine list. Some vintage depth. Very well chosen including some hard to get gems. Standard resort markup.

Beef; it's what's for dinner.  Ahhhh.",oeAhRa8yFa9jtrhaHnOyxQ,32,28,5,BmdLL2oRcRrkS9UWR71GRg

My brother and I were seated fairly quickly by whom we later found out was the assistant manager, but the service was overall disappointing. Given the cost of the food and location, I really expected more in terms of service.

We had the foie gras to start and it was delightful. My brother had the bone-in rib eye and I had the NY strip--both of which were cooked perfectly. However, they neglected to bring the entrees out at the same time. My brother sat waiting an additional 5 minutes before his came out, and I waited to eat with him. No apology for that from the staff. We had the asparagus and the mushroom medley as sides and those were also made well. For dessert, I ordered the marbled pumpkin cheesecake with buttered popcorn ice cream (like it said on the menu), but got a plain cheesecake, no ice cream. And it took 15 minutes to come out. While it was good, we did not finish it because we were so upset by the response by management. 

We complained about the dessert and the assistant manager was very nice. The regular manager then came to the table and was a condescending jerk. They took the cheesecake off of our bill, but basically apologized that WE didn't appreciate the flow of our meal. It wasn't the cheesecake that was the issue, it was the lag between courses, mistimed entrees, the lack of keeping our water glasses filled, and overall jerkiness of the general manager. We ate early and it was NOT busy (there were only three other tables of couples when we got there).

From the MJ menu, chose the Caesar Salad with bone-in Filet Mignon served with mashed potatoes and a Hazelnut Chocolate Bar dessert. Each course was well presented and tasted excellent.

Since we've been town we have been trying to decide which steak house to go to and finally decided Palmer's, and it was a great choice. The atmosphere was classy, inside  the four seasons hotel near Mandalay Bay Resort. The Food we ordered was all great. (shown in pictures if you want a visual) The shrimp in the cocktail was very fresh and the sauce had a sassy sweet taste, the tar tare was French style and very well seasoned, if you close your eyes you wouldn't know it was raw. I really enjoyed the Iceberg salad, the dressing was just enough and bleu cheese was the real deal. The Short Rib was very rich and tender, the best I've ever had. The bone in Rib Eye was the most tender perfectly cooked piece of meat on the planet, I wish I had more. For Desert it was the Chocolate peanut butter bar which was something out of ""GRAMMAS"" kitchen and the biggest surprise of all was the Lemon Tart which was completely original and extremely well presented. 

The only imperfect thing about Palmer's was the service wasn't as good as I've had at other high dollar facilities. As of right now I'm calling number one for Steak In Vegas but there are still more visits in the future, Vegas has dozens of prime steak houses.

5140150,2013-09-07,0,MpovsyjkSkchD7ssAdEVKQ,"Came here for RW!  

Started off with the Foie Gras Terrine : Nutella, Raspberry Spaghetti, Figs and Texas Toast. Buttery smooth and creamy, Nutella worked surprisingly well! The Texas toast was warm and also buttery, so the terrine spread smooth. The Raspberry spaghetti, figs and fruit added a touch of flavor and consistency.  One of the best ways I've had Foie Gras with sweets!

First course was Australian Wagyu Carpaccio with Truffle Salad. Carpaccio was tender, tasty, and melt in your mouth! The salad was salty, so the truffle taste was hidden.  I ate up every bite of the beef, but left almost the entire salad, and I love truffles :(

Main course, Bone-In Filet Mignon: Bone Marrow Flan and Port Wine Reduction. First bite, I noticed it was a little ""cooler"" than I am used to...then I realized it was cooked rare. It was pretty tender and flavorful, but towards the bone, I started to hear it Moooing lol. Port Wine reduction was ok, a little distracting personally. No real char on the outside...they probably oven cook it to temp with no major sear.  Bone Marrow Flan didn't do much for me either.

The sides, Parmesan Potato Gratin and Jalapeño Creamed Corn.  Both were creamy and yummy...I liked the melted cheese on top on the potatoes. Good stuff!  And it was very tasty corn! I didn't notice the jalapeno at all though...so no, it was not spicy in the slightest. I did scoop out pretty much all of that corn though! Yum

And for dessert, Chocolate Peanut Butter Bar: Caramel Ice Cream and Chocolate Sauce. This was super rich and tasty! I love peanut butter desserts!  

Service was a bit slow, steak was cooked wrong, and overall the food was good but not great.  A-OK in my book...

Maybe I'll come back and try the cut of the week deal when the time is right.

5144143,2014-03-13,0,MpovsyjkSkchD7ssAdEVKQ,"Had the Restaurant Week menu along with an order of the oysters. OMG, such fresh, meaty tasting oysters (was told Panko? from Washington) with a fabulous cucumber mignonette. The bread basket had several choices and the cornbread was very moist and delicious with the sweetened butter, and the olive bread was good as well. The first course of pea soup with crab was very fresh and springtimey tasting. The crab itself was a bit too salty but when mixed into the soup, tasted great. Then the burrata and strawberry tomato with balsamic was just scrumptious. Super fresh and creamy burrata, tasty and lightly sweet tomato. Again, the greens on their own  tasted oversalted, but if eaten together with the other components, it was just fine. The Australian wagyu was the most boring part of the meal, the sides of spring vegetables and mashed Aligot potatoes were average, but the Poached Egg/Bone Marrow Fried rice was quite unctuous tasting. The Caramelized White Chocolate Cheesecake with Candied Hazelnuts was just okay. But the oyster, burrata, and the pea soup were such standouts that I will definitely be returning here soon.

Bread basket: hot, fresh cornbread was the best cornbread I've ever had. Sadly this cornbread was the highlight of my meal..

Ahi Tuna Tartar: *Yawn* just wasn't that interesting of a preparation. The tuna was fresh, but I can't say I enjoyed this dish very much and I'm a huge tuna fan.

Filet Mignon ($42): Depressing that a 10 oz steak is the smallest steak on their menu, but I realize that's common nowadays. The menu description reads ""roasted shallot jus"". I didn't give the description much thought until the steak came out covered in brown goo. Why cover up a perfectly cooked top quality piece of beef by covering it with gross sticky goo!! While my steak was great, I really had trouble getting past the brown sauce. It didn't taste good, and texturally it really bothered me to have liquids all over my steak.. for $42 I can find a tasty steak elsewhere.

We had some side dishes, but despite the fact that I sampled them just 15 hours ago I've already forgotten them all .. yawn.

There are so many delicious steak spots in Vegas, I can't say I'd ever return here, but for those that like their steaks covered in sauce this might be your spot..",kmE8w5Y785eZmodsx0V6Ag,3,1,3,JOVQVYxWUuP0QtmcMOk0wA
5270958,2014-01-24,0,MpovsyjkSkchD7ssAdEVKQ,"The menu was different.  It was a menu in tribute to Michael Jackson and the Michael Jackson ONE by Cirque du Soleil show at Mandalay Bay.  

SLOW ROASTED CHICKEN Cauliflower / Hazelnuts / Truffles
Everything was tiny.  I received a chicken thigh and one piece of broccoflower cut into small pieces.  It wasn't even a full thigh.  It was the size of an organic chicken thigh, not a thigh from say KFC.  The skin was thin and crispy which was nice.  However, it had way too much salt on it.  The meat had an odd rubbery texture that was hard to cut.  It felt like you weren't cutting real chicken.  The sauce was decent.  There were little slivers of truffles on top of the chicken.  The couple next to me ordered the same thing and had their dish split into two plates.  They both received more cauliflower than me.

CHOCOLATE PEANUT BUTTER BAR Caramel Ice Cream / Dark Chocolate Sauce
For a ""bar"", I found it to be lacking in texture.  The whole thing was soft cream except for this thin layer of peanut butter and chocolate at the bottom.  It was razor thin.  There was some chocolate sauce smeared on the plate and a few peanuts on the side.

Our waiters were all over the place.  One dropped a dish.  Another couldn't figure out who ordered a side dish.  After running back and forth for a few minutes, he just left it in the middle of the table for ""anybody who wants it.""  Luckily, the person who ordered it discovered it was there before people started eating it.  My friend asked for some cracked pepper.  I watched the waiter acknowledge and then walk over to the side to chat with some coworkers.  After a few minutes, she requested the cracked pepper again.  He said he had completely forgot.

5279879,2018-01-21,3,MpovsyjkSkchD7ssAdEVKQ,"Located at the far south end of what most people consider ""The Strip,"" a concealed attachment to Mandalay Bay, lofty price point and lack of gambling making it the sort of hotel inhabited by mostly well-heeled jetsetters, it seems safe to say that Four Seasons Las Vegas is not a place most tourists will seek out, yet for over a decade Charlie Palmer Steak has stood its ground despite no lack of nearby competition.

Styled as a classic American Steakhouse and one of five for the restaurateur behind Aureole, a location directly off the lobby and next to Veranda placing the deceptively intimate room in prime position for those arriving via Four Seasons valet or the Mandalay Bay staircase, it is immediately upon approach that guests are greeted by a hostess at the podium, her subtle manner of dress and waiters in suits a far cry from the short skirts and jeans worn elsewhere and largely mirrored by diners.

Elegant without being 'stuffy,' subdued lighting and linens mixed with leather, wood and patterned carpets creating a refined ambiance that is unfortunately subverted by overly loud pop-tunes and the gleam of sports television at the bar, it was shortly after seating at a rounded booth that a man approached offering Cocktails, the list of top-shelf classics enticing but set aside in favor of the Sommelier-suggested Wine Pairing.

Probably best-known by 'foodies' for the ""Cut of the Week"" Tasting menu, a three-course Prix-fixe that changes weekly and offers Salad, Beef, Sides, Wine and Dessert for just $58 per person, it was after perusing options that the decision was instead made to give the kitchen carte-blanche, Chefs Eduardo Lalo Saavedra and Tomas Espino rolling out a nine-course Dinner over the course of 130 minutes.

Not the sort of place for tableside theatrics or imaginative reinterpretation, Charlie Palmer's self-designated ""Progressive American"" cuisine instead focused on pristine ingredients treated with respect to yield great flavor, it was with a glass of Rose that house-baked Bread arrived prior to course one, the small cubes of Cornbread sweet, crumbly and addictive while others were soft and fluffy, the arrival of Chef-selected Sashimi unfortunately leaving little time to enjoy the sparkling Val de Mer as drapes of Yellowtail and Hamachi dressed lightly with Soy paired far better with a semi-sweet Riesling.

Making short work of the six slices of Fish with Chopsticks and finishing the Wine sip-for-bite, the pours requested as half-normal volume given limited tolerance, it was with golden 2015 Kracher Beerenauslese coating the palate that Chef Saavedra's Torchon of Foie Gras was spread on buttered Toast, the classic pairing expectedly working well as did White Grenache with Short Rib Ravioli, though the texture of the filling was a little dry and may have been better were the Meat shredded.

Progressing a little too quickly, the presentation of a Bibb Lettuce Salad with Beer that was declined in favor of unpleasantly sour Sauvignon Blanc providing an opportunity to slow the kitchen down by cutting Greens at a leisurely pace, it was shortly after the last bits of smoky Bacon were forked up that a generous slice of Ora King Salmon was joined by 2016 Talley Chardonnay, the smooth citrusy profile playing exceptionally well off the flaky Fish and also quite nicely off wilted Chard dressed in vibrant Vinaigrette.

Marking the final savory course with a serrated blade and Syrah, an off-menu array of Charlie Palmer Steak's Prime USDA Beef accompanied by two ounces of A5 Kagoshima Wagyu plus Root Vegetables, Mushrooms and Truffles one of the most beautiful and delicious Steak presentations in recent memory, it was as Coffee was offered that the Sommelier presented 2014 Dashe Late Harvest Zinfandel, the thick Purple Wine from Sonoma County creating a sort of Peanut Butter and Jelly combination with Charlie Palmer's ""Candy Bar"" though perhaps a bit too heavy for the Mango Panna Cotta that is virtually weightless but texturally pleasing in support of Sorbet and cooked Persimmon.

Unable to pass-up Apple Pie, the ten-minute baking time welcomed as Coffee was sipped at the end of a fairly heavy and fast meal, it should probably be unsurprising that Charlie Palmer Steak's version of the American classic is a beautiful rendition given the quality of his produce, but the true star of the show is actually the tangy Crème Fraiche Ice Cream that makes a fine dance partner for Brown Butter Streusel and Caramel.

****Easily seen as just another 'me too' Steakhouse in a city where every hotel has to have one, but in reality the sort of contemporary American restaurant where great ingredients are showcased in a manner that is accessible to a wide variety of customers at a price that is far more accessible than many, Charlie Palmer Steak has withstood the test of time for good reason and with Chef Saavedra at the helm there is no reason to think that is going to change anytime soon.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,10,8,4,rkNHwsythOGQJtE2_UutUw

My husband and I were staying at the Four Seasons for our first anniversary and had dinner reservations here. After reading other Yelp reviews, I had high hopes for a wonderful evening. Our waiter brought our menus and I asked about the Cut of the Week. He proceeded to tell me it was a lesser cut of meat and didn't recommend it. So we ordered lobster bisque soup, a bone in rib eye to share, twice baked potato, brussel sprouts and a glass of wine. The soup didn't arrive but our steak came out quickly followed by the potato and veggies. Steak was cooked properly at medium rare but the inside of the potato was COLD! Brussel sprouts were tasty. The problem could have been easily rectified if our server ever came to check on us. We decided to start eating so the steak wouldn't get cold. Finished the steak, didn't eat the cold potato. Finally waved down a bus boy who brought our server over. We told him we didn't get the soup and the wine never came. He asked if we wanted them now and we said we did not. As we're talking to him, the wine finally arrives. I've had more attentive service at the Sizzler. Even though this restaurant is located inside Four Seasons, it is not owned by Four Seasons and may explain the lack of customer care.

Nutella, raspberry spaghetti, black mission figs and Texas toast. The terrine was perfectly smooth and creamy which is why it worked so well with the Nutella.  The warm Texas toast just makes the terrine smoother and creamier.  The raspberry spaghetti lacked flavor - it added color to the plate and that's about it. The figs added texture. 4/5 

Australian Kobe Beef Carpaccio:
Came with truffle salad. The salad would've been great had it not been extra salty.  The carpaccio itself was excellent...the salad ruined it! 3/5

Charred Bone-In FIlet Mignon:
Came with bone marrow flan and Port Wine reduction.  The bone marrow flan was good. We always gets our steaks cooked medium-rare...we got rare and the thing was still mooing. I'll eat a steak as long as it's not a hockey puck but if you're a steak place shouldn't you be able to cook medium-rare? 3/5

Jalapeño Creamed Corn and Parmesan Potato Gratin:
These sides were really good. The creamed corn wasn't spicy at all for having jalapeño. The gratin was delis and the melted parmesan on top was great. 4/5

Chocolate Peanut Butter Bar:
Served with caramel ice cream, and chocolate sauce. I don't like peanut butter and chocolate together but that's just a matter of personal preference. The ice cream was good and I finished it then gave the friend the half of my peanut butter.  I mean, the peanut butter wasn't too bad since it wasn't really that pronounced - I was just not in love with it to finish it. 3/5

The night we went, there was an event (some business mixer) and no hostess was there so we were quite confused. The service was quite bad. I asked first server that came to our table for the RW menu and he said he'd get it but he never came back. We were waiting for somebody to come to our table again but that took 20 minutes! Second server came to our table asking us, ""are you guys ready to order?"" uh...it's quite difficult to place an order if we don't know what's on the menu! My patience left and ate somewhere else.",tH0uKD-vNwMoEc3Xk3Cbdg,3,2,3,aF-G6DpZ2CFHbY6Zsm4U2g

We've been here more than a few times during our Las Vegas visits and I can't recommend this place enough to others! Obviously their claim to fame is steak, and they're not lying... but they also have a lovely menu of other entrees worth trying. Side dishes here are served ""family style"" and I highly recommend their potato gratin. YUM!! They also have a great selection of wines, wonderful customer service (and wine service) and a relaxed, classy bar to enjoy happy hour cocktails in before dinner. Every time we go to Las Vegas we try to book dinner here at least once. Kid friendly?

Decor was a little outdated, especially considering the rest of the restaurant collection at Mandalay Bay/Four Seasons. 

Cocktails were perfect. I ordered the El Diablo & it came with a single long ice cube in a Collins glass, literally the way it was meant to. Extremely refreshing! My boyfriend got the Old Fashioned & that was also a hit. 

Our food was amazing. I got the filet and my boyfriend got the rib eye. Both steaks came out according to temperature & literally melted in our mouths. Garlic au jus & bearnaise sauce were delightful additions as well as the potato gratin & creamed spinach. I would have liked the potatoes in the au gratin a little less firm & a truffle addition would have been nice. Overall, one of the best steaks I've had in Las Vegas. Dessert menu lacked anything to write home about. We were disappointed that some of the gems people wrote about on Yelp weren't on there (ice cream sandwiches, peanut butter bar, smores bar). Pineapple Upside Down Cake tasted like an dry old fashioned donut with pineapple baked into it. Although, we were given chocolate cookies upon leaving & that did seem to quench our thirst for something sweet.

I often stay at the four seasons and its convenient for company dinners. It's generally been fine... not stellar but good, last night the service was so awful I'm compelled to write my first review after so many OK previous visits. 

We had reservations for 6 of us and checked in 15 mins late.
We had to wait another 15 mins to be seated with plenty of empty tables around and we weren't seated until one of my partners said she really needed to sit down. We waited easily 10 minutes for our drink orders to be taken, another 10 minutes for them to be delivered. During the meal when the waiter bothered to check on us the drink orders we made were lost.. just not delivered. Drinks we didn't order were delivered. The waiter did not take the girls orders first, he started with my wife then just went around the table in order. Generally $200/person level restaurants take the ladies orders first. Our order took almost 30 minutes to arrive and one of the medium steaks was blue (less than rare).. we had to send it back. 
It was an internal company dinner, we laughed it off but honestly for almost $200/person it should have been... and could have been much better.",dg2Ztv6YLhejFo626YH55Q,0,0,2,vZ8ll5ZwgPSqpwJkDXLXLQ

The service wasn't very good. We got there for an early dinner at 5:30 and were one of two tables in the place. It took about 10 minutes to get menus and then another 10 to get water. The steak was not great at all. I had the surf and turf which is lobster and a filet mignon. The steak was not tender or soft or the way it should have been. The knife to cut it was more dull then my spoon. Either the steak should have been the way I expect an expensive filet mignon to be or the knife should have been super sharp so that I didn't notice. I was basically sawing my steak the whole time. The side of blue cheese fondue was delicious, but it was basically just a TON of blue cheese. We also got the Parmesan gratin and it was basically liquid potato mush. The only thing that was super delicious was the dessert. The Meyer lemon creme brulee was amazing.

Our waiter was terrible. He only had our table to help and he kept sitting at the bar and watching some hockey game. I had to wait too many times for my water to be refilled. I will not go back.

5374153,2013-03-14,0,MpovsyjkSkchD7ssAdEVKQ,"Spring Restaurant Week 2013:

This was my second stop on my week of overindulgence and gluttony. Saying that it was a 3 star experience amongst the greatness I experienced this week is not a lose. It was just the attentions to details that brought down the overall rating.

The food was decent. It would have been better if there was a little more option and the food coming out hotter. The potato leek soup with lobster and sour cream dumplings had a rich and balanced flavor, but was plagued by its lukewarm service. The proscuitto wrapped heart of romaine lettuce caesar also had this problem... Just kidding. It just was not special. I did enjoy the fresh anchovies filets and the presence of fish in the dressing. It was not drenched in it either, which was nice in contrast to the saltiness of the cured pork.

There was no option for entree. I was excited because it boasted a cut of wagyu with truffled potatoes and asparagus. The plates were not hot so the food cooled by the time it hit the tables. The sides were cooked in pans and were piping hot. They were the best part of the meal and came in a generous portion for three. The steak itself did not taste like wagyu. It was on the tougher side and had no presence of marbling to it. At certain spots, it was dry. 

As for desserts, they ran out of the intended offering and subbed out the peanut butter chocolate bar. It was light and I was thankful because this was the second steakhouse on my trek through Restaurant Week. 

My friend saw that they offer a beef tasting menu for $120. I am intrigued by this. Just hope the quality will be better than the one set for this event.

Another aspect that dragged down our experience was the ambiance. It was all dark with shadows. Nothing popped or made for a great focal point in the restaurant. It all just blended together into a bland atmosphere.",N3oNEwh0qgPqPP3Em6wJXw,2,0,3,sO6rLtN8_5FenYjwJgt9Eg
5387568,2011-11-08,1,MpovsyjkSkchD7ssAdEVKQ,"Calling all carnivores!!  Charlie Palmer Steak (located @ Four Seasons hotel - next to Mandalay Bay) offers a special menu that you have to know about to ask for called ""Cut of the Week"".  COTW is a prix fixe menu paired with 2 Bottomless wines, 1 white & 1 red for $48 served Tues-Sat weekly.  There is always a red meat in the COTW, which could be various cuts/preparations of steak, lamb, veal.  Also includes a salad, 2 family style sides, & dessert.

I didn't understand the whole ""bottomless wine"" part until I finally enjoyed COTW.  The service is absolutely fantastic.  Both of my wine glasses never emptied.  There were at least 2 servers dedicated to just keeping an eye on everyone's wine glasses who quickly topped my glass off every time I had taken more than 2 sips.  I didn't even realize how much I had drank until we were walking out because my glass was always full.  Can you say tipsayyyyy??  I slipped as I was stepping on the escalator and cut my arm.  Seriously, only Me!  Yes, I already had a driver for the night because of the words on the menu ""Bottomless wine"".

You really can't beat the outstanding food and service quality for under $96 for two people before tip.

On our first ever visit to CPS we had a slight service mishap, which they more than made up for.  Approx a month prior we had booked reservations for an April Friday evening because close friends from out of town were visiting us.  When we arrived we were informed that a group had reserved the entire restaurant for a party and they could no longer honor our reservations.  We were clearly disappointed because no one had taken the time to call us before we got dressed up and drove over with dreams of beefy goodness that can only be derived from Charlie Palmer.  However, they walked us into their sister restaurant in Mandalay Bay, Aureole and told the hostess to comp all of our food because they could not honor our CPS dinner reservations.  Furthermore, they told us that they would take care of our first round of drinks upon our next visit to CPS.  They really did.  They also know us by name and face on every return visit since the mishap on our initial visit.

My only minor complaint is that over the past 2 months they stopped offering different wines on the COTW.  Of late they offer the same 2 wines every week: 2009 Chateau Montfort Vouray Demi Sec from Loire Valley & 2008 Universo de Los Andes Malbec from Argentina.  I REALLY  REALLY hope that CPS goes back to varying the COTW wines on a weekly basis.",KmBPYlD00BupKSwWxOWA6w,6,0,5,XmBubTJ6lWAbI1o1JQTpQA

This place was an old favorite of mine that I somehow put on the back burner for too long. Being that I have had a ton of friends birthdays lately it has been a nice excuse to get CP back in the rotation!

First, it is so nice to have a fine dining option without having to walk through a loud and smokey casino. It is so easy to valet at Four Seasons without dealing with the Mandalay portion. As soon as you walk in the restaurant is just a few short steps away.

This time we started at their bar so we could finish watching the baseball game. Tommy the bartender took great care of us as we ordered an appetizer and drinks. He was very knowledgeable and even though they did not carry our first choice of beverage he was able to make a perfect suggestion that paired perfectly.

After the game we moved to a table so we could have more privacy and catch up. I opted again for the Cut of the Week while my friend chose a prosciutto wrapped romaine salad and swordfish on a bed time of crab risotto. Once again the Cut of the Week menu did not disappoint. It started with an apple arugula salad with blue cheese. The main course was a fontina crusted pork porterhouse wish smashed taters and kale lollipops. Desert this time was a baked Alaska style banana split. Oh and we can't forget the bottomless wine pairing!",BbwldZQM1i89cAvV7fce3A,9,5,5,uXKnj7o-6MKaToprL9w8nA

The restaurant was amazing. We did one of their preset menus, and I was glad we did. Everything was so amazing. The bib lettuce salad was the most amazing salad I've ever had in a restaurant. The lettuce actually tasted clean, compared to other restaurants where the lettuce tastes like dirt. The filet mignon was beyond amazing. So wonderfully seasoned and cooked to perfection. There were wine pairings with each course, and it was all you can drink! 

Our waiter was the absolute best as well! Unfortunately his name escapes me at the moment. My husband told him it was my birthday, and he brought me a huge slice of chocolate cake, along with the dessert that came with out meal. He also brought us a sorbet selection sampling.

Started with salad which was ok defiantly towards the bottom of others I have had there.

Next the New York steak was not a New York steak, it was a paper thin Latin American style cutlet with nerves and odd pieces running  through it. Sides were ok and desert was good. Wine pairing here was always well done and the red was spot on a Spanish Grenacha but the white was a monkey bay sauv Blanc that you can buy for 5 bucks at any grocery store.

I know that the wines are bargain wines but they had always done a good job finding off the wall brands or regions which made the wines at least interesting. 

I hope management reads this part.... This has been a great Vegas secret for a long time and has always felt like a deal, the main cut needs to be something of quality. what was served was embarrassing to the restaurant and the Charlie Palmer name.

There was Mario Batali and Tom Douglas in Seattle earlier this year, Hubert Keller, Rick Moonen, and now finally Charlie Palmer.  And Mr. Palmer actually cooked my dinner!

As people have expressed in their reviews here, Charlie Palmer Steak has one of the best specials going on the strip that I have ever seen, their ""Cut of the Week"" prix fixe 3-course menu with UNLIMITED WINE PAIRINGS for only $48 per person.  Yes you heard me, ALL YOU CAN DRINK WINE PAIRINGS.  This is no cheap wine either, my friends.  This is the good stuff.  One of the courses we had was this wonderful Bastianich Winery selection, which goes for probably $40 per bottle.

This particular week the courses were:

First Course:
Composed Salad - organic watercress, poached pairs, goat cheese mousse, hazelnut Vinaigrette.

Main Course:
14 ounce Grass Fed New York Strip Loin - with caramelized sweet onions and smoked sea salt

Sides:
Butternut Squash Risotto, Roasted Root Veggies

Desert:
Dark Chocolate Spearmint Bar

Without going into massive detail about each course, everything was pretty spot on and lovely.  Except the steak.  Not my husband's steak, my steak.  It was weird, the flavor was completely different from his, and it was tough and bland.  

You're probably wondering why I gave a tough and bland steakhouse five stars.  Since it tasted so differently than my husband's it was an obvious execution mistake, so I sent it back.  They were so apologetic and went to recook it.  When it came back, it was one of the best steaks I have ever eaten.  They said, ""chef made it himself,"" and I looked up and there was Charlie Palmer himself running around in a cook's jacket.  Very impressive, and it was amazingly cool.  On top of it, we got a complimentary truffled baked potato, which was amazing.  Every time I have had a truffled potato dish in a high end restaurant, I have been disappointed.  This was perfect.

Anyway, I have seen some great selections on the cut of the week menu.  A few weeks ago they had some snake river farms beef selections.  If you have not had snake river farms waygu beef, it is absolutely amazing.  I believe this is the American Waygu beef that Cut uses on their menu as well.

So to wrap things up here, try Charlie Palmer Steak mainly for the cut of the week menu.  I can't compare it to other high end steakhouses on the strip because they don't have such an amazing deal, but my husband and I really loved this meal and are looking forward to going again.",PomQayG1WhMxeSl1zohAUA,2,2,5,jDjGIU2iS6lKxdnBsFwWAw

Since it was raining when i arrived back in town, and I always wanted to go here, we went to dinner.  There were 3 of us; we all ordered different things.  To be fair, the place is pretty, really pretty, and the staff is nice.  The salads/app's were good, although what they called home made mozzarella cheese tasted store bought, but the heirloom tomatoes were spot on.  My significant other (we'll call him the one who doesn't like to complain) and his niece ordered filets well done, like hockey pucks, so no review there, not fair!  I ordered the porterhouse medium, and asked if it was ""plain grilled"" without sauce or topping, my preference.  My steak came with this thin mushroom sauce and mushrooms on top, which I like, but didn't expect.   Especially after asking.  The meat was good quality (it should have been, it was expensive, I recall $70) We were too full for dessert.  In summary, I thought this place would be better.  Many other choices, although this was certainly convenient located in the 4 seasons.  Not too pricey for 3, with drinks and apps and dinner, no dessert, about $300 without tip.  If you want plain grilled high quality steak try somewhere else.  If you like sauces, etc, this might be for you.

The service was a bit slow, which I attributed to the crowded restaurant during CES as any great restaurant is fully booked during this week.

We ordered the oysters, Hamachi, and Shrimp appetizers. They were all great and a hit. I really enjoyed the Tomato Caprese salad, as the mozzarella cheese was truly fresh and tasteful.  I ordered the filet Mignon and it was perfect other than the fact the meal arrived on a cooler side, again I attributed it to the large party and crowded restaurant . But when my coffee arrived lukewarm, I was not very pleased as it seems that a restaurant of this status should pay more attention to he service, the meal is great if served properly.

Instead: Ribeye. Porterhouse. The more aged the better. And rare, like mooing.

5734617,2013-04-12,0,MpovsyjkSkchD7ssAdEVKQ,"I honestly think this is a middling four. It's not a three, but it's maybe a tiny bit weak for a four. 

Dining with a family member, we split a couple appetizers: their caprese salad and the seared foie gras. The salad was outstanding. Nice, flavorful ripe heirloom tomato halves (not slices, but big meaty halves) paired with some decent mozzarella cheese (needed a little more salt to my taste) balsamic vinegar, and a very nice, slightly bitter, green and fennel root salad. I loved the large tomato chunks, and I'm a sucker for fennel in salad like this. Coupled with a night light dressing, this was a hit. The foie gras on the other hand...wasn't really up to the same standard. It's a nice sized helping of simple seared foie gras, but on top of a pineapple upside-down cake. Seriously. The cake and the liver really do nothing for one another. We each had a bit of the combination, and then just ate the cake, cleansed the palate, and set in on the foie gras. The liver itself was pretty rare, which I guess it OK with me. I think I'd just rather have this in pate rather than ad a whole piece of liver. I don't think we'd order this again. I would say I'm a little disappointed that they didn't have the traditional steak house soups. No lobster bisque? No french onion? Just a spring garlic soup, which yours truly is not ordering when the word garlic is in the name.

For main course, each of us had filets, medium rare, with a side of the royal trumpet mushrooms and the bleu cheese fondue. The steaks came out looking very dry - almost cold. Not sizzling, not glistening, nothing. It seemed odd, but they were definitely served on hot plates, weren't cold, and tasted pretty good. I think personally, a little more salt and pepper crust would have been good, but they had good beef flavor and were very tender. I liked the mushrooms as a hearty compliment - very meaty, large mushrooms in a nice brown gravy. And the bleu cheese fondue was very good - mild and creamy, great with the filet. I usually don't get sauces with steaks, wanting them to be able to stand on their own, but this was nice to have. Maybe I'll do it more often.

Finally, we opted to skip dessert. Kinda. First there were complimentary little ice cream cookie sandwiches. Which were good. And then, since I had mentioned it was someone's birthday, was a complimentary butterscotch creme brulee, which was quite nice of them. This was actually very good. I wouldn't probably have ordered it myself, but it had great rich butterscotch flavor, silky smooth texture, and a nice burnt (but not too burnt) sugar crust. Very well executed. So I guess we got dessert anyway.

Final note - their iced tea is some kind of...mango or fruit flavored tea. It doesn't say this, and they didn't say it, and we didn't ask for it. But it definitely is flavored. Some people like this, some people do not. We...tend not to. That fruit flavor gets really floral in tea. Just be warned if that's not your thing. I'm surprised they didn't say anything or call out that it wasn't standard iced black tea.

So do I come back? Wellll...no. Four stars, right? That's good? But in Vegas, my bar is so high, and there are so many other steakhouses and other great restaurants, that if I had to make the choice, I would opt to try something new or duplicate at another spot. This was pretty good, but not good enough to make me want to come back right away at the expense of other spots. But I think it's better than Foundation Room (in the same hotel) if you're looking for a traditional steak.",tPufvUuxXLJOMYQ7gzsMVA,4,0,4,gdGoQuCfBBMyzVAJ00nf_A
5745414,2016-12-31,0,MpovsyjkSkchD7ssAdEVKQ,"We came for my daughter's birthday, and we've been here about three times for the cut of the week, and frankly each time, the quality of the food seems to have deteriorated.  The service is still impeccable, and the staff is quite good, but we really come here for the food.  

Of the seven of us, four ordered the filet, two got the miso black cod and one got the short rib.  The breads were nicely filling.  We started with the salad, which was fine.  The bibb salad had a buttery flavor and match nicely with the ranch, but it was not particularly memorable.  The sauvignon blanc and the Spanish garnacha that came with the meals were uninspiring wines, and I eshewed a refill.  The filet was tender, but did not have much flavor, no char at all.   Our waiter was gracious in taking back the two miso cods because they were too salty.  When they returned,  they were slightly less salty, but lacked flavor.  It was as if they were marinated too long in miso and were stripped of their natural taste.  The house offered a few complimentary side dishes, which was appreciated, but even those were not quite up to the standards we had expected.  None of the sides were completely eaten, and frankly I don't remember any of them.  The creme brulee was nice, but again not memorable.

There was a nice small ensemble playing Christmas classics, and they were pretty good.  Our table was a little in the back, which was nice, but a large table behind us were quite loud, and it would have been nice if they had sectioned them off as it was the first time I've experienced a party-like ambience at a Four Seasons restaurant.   Our bill came and our waiter told us the manager took off a considerable amount, but not counting the complimentary sides, they took off the miso cods, which was fine.

We were wowed by our first visits to Charlie Palmer--the quality and taste of the food matched the waiters' professionalism and the pleasing environs, but I have to say I was disappointed by this last visit.  I expected better of the Charlie Palmer name.",1wEGvdhBdxaoTC7PKHdzYQ,0,0,3,XAO-GsXkpejOEfvr2UBZzA

I was sitting at the bar and the bartender said to give it a try because the veal chop it came with was the best... he wasn't wrong. The first course was a salad which was quite good, the second course was the veal chop with roasted vegetables and some type of potato. The veal chop was amazing and the roasted vegetables were the perfect match, I didn't eat the potato, but they sure looked good. I decided to forgo dessert so they happily substituted a cappuccino. The bartender I had was awesome, and he wasn't kidding about the unlimited wine... the bar scene was very lively so I hung out for a while and probably went through a bottle myself (he continued to pour for free even after my meal had ended).

We came here for a beautiful night out on Saturday for our 7:30PM reservation.  It was all glitz and glamor inside this fancy dark restaurant.  I got The Cut of the Week while he had The Tribute to Michael Jackson.  Two three-course meals, he clearly chose the better one.  Let's break it down:

* The Cut of the Week [changes weekly but we'll still talk about it]:  

First course was ""Baby Iceberg Salad with Late Harvest Corn, Bacon Lardons, Creamy Blue Cheese. Wine pairing was a Riesling, St. Urbans-Hof, Mosel, Germany.""  It's basically a 60's-style wedge salad with a flavorful dressing and some bites of sweet corn and chunks of bacon and bleu cheese.  It was light and refreshing and a great way to start off the meal.  I ended up having two glasses of Reisling and I have no regrets.  That perfectly chilled, crisp, white wine.   Yum.

The main course was ""Marinated Culotte Steak with Truffle Butter with sides of Garlic Pomme Purée and Haricots Verts with Pancetta.  Wine pairing was a Merlot, Opolo, Summit Creek, Paso Robles.""  I had it cooked a medium rare and it was perfect.  The seasoning was on-point, there was the perfect amount of pinkness, and the sides were great.  Since the husbie's three-course didn't come with sides, I shared mine and we still couldn't finish.  The potatoes were so smooth and creamy and oh so garlicy while the green beans provided a nice sweetness to the savory meal. 

Dessert:  Warm Apple Coffee Cake with Bourbon Vanilla Ice Cream.  What a perfect way to end dinner.  I had a second glass of Riesling with dessert and I was happy.  Now let's talk about that Tribute to MJ!

* Tribute to Michael Jackson [you get options for your courses]:

For his first course, he chose the Brentwood Corn Chowder with Alaskan King Crab, Bacon Lardons, and Chive Batons.  Oh. My. Gawd.  This was so delicious!  It was warm and creamy and that sweetness from the corn and crab was mind-blowing.  He scraped his bowl clean and I can't blame him.  It beats my wedge salad.

His main course was Charred Bone-In Filet Mignon with Garlic Pomme Purée and Black Truffle Natural sauce.  He had ordered his' medium rare and oh goodness.  It was sooo tender and juicy.  It literally melts in your mouth and has a great beef flavor.  It's a filet mignon so what do you expect?  Once again, blew my main course out of the water.

For dessert, he chose the Lemon Raspberry Crème Brûlée with Vanilla Chantilly and Citrus Zest Confit.  This was a citrus explosion!  It was fun and bright on the tongue and a great palate cleanser after all that red meat.

The Cut of the Week came with bottomless wine but they still offered him the same treatment. Overall, it was a fabulous dinner and I'll definitely be back again.  I hope the Tribute to MJ menu sticks around for a while because I want everything he had.  *kisses fingertips*  Awwww yiiiiissss!

CP Is located within the Four Seasons. 
We made reservations and were seated about ten minutes after our arrival. 
Between the four of us, we ordered:
Tuna tartare, shrimp cocktail, surf and turf, porterhouse for two. 
First on the list:  
1.  The bread basket
An assortment of breads. The cornbread, by far, was to die for. I typically don't care for it, but it was so moist and delicious.
2.  Yellowfin Tuna Tartare 
Pinkerton Avocados w/ Lavash Crisps and Citrus Ponzu:   Delicious.  The tuna was like butter and melted in your mouth.
We love tartare and typically choose it as an appetizer, be it beef, fish, etc.  but this dish exceeded my expectations. I could have had another plate of this and had been satisfied!  That's how delicious it was. The ponzu sauce gave this dish the extra kick and just took it to the next level. 
Citrus Marinated Wild Baja Prawns 
3.  Carrot Salad w/ Classic Cocktail Sauce: 
Cousins got this dish and they said it was delicious. They typically do a shrimp cocktail and loved how this dish was prepared - sautéed in a butter/lemon sauce. 
4.  Surf and Turf:
Maine lobster and filet. Also ordered was the truffle potato gratin.
5.  Porterhouse for two, medium rare.  
What words can I use to describe the best piece of meat we've ever had?  Fu**ing delicious?   Yeah, that's about right!   Worth every penny. We also had the truffle potato gratin and it was just amazing. The truffle did not overpower the dish at all but added another layer of flavor that perfected a typically average side. Also ordered was the Brussel sprouts which I thought were very good. They were cooked to crispy perfection with water chestnuts.  
The husband has always wanted to try  blue crab so we ordered that as well. It was okay. Nothing special. But at least we can say we've had it. 
At the end of our meal, we were given four caramel turtle cookies when we decided to not have dessert.

It was a little difficult finding this place, but once you taste their steaks, you forget about the hassle of finding this restaurant. We ordered ahi tuna tartar for our appetizer. They come out and mix the tartar in front of you and then place it on a platter. It was delicious! The steaks were amazing as well. The only thing I didn't like was the side of asparagus. They trim off the sides leaving you with no crunch when you bite into it. Overall, it was a great dining experience especially with a loved one.",H0uhBVqMajZcL_uREKKcrw,0,0,5,IP5dVpG8K3Pa1CknzEnKhg

They asked if we had a reservation, which we did not. They turned us away because of a fire drill that was scheduled at midnight - 2 1/2 hours later. They told us the kitchen was closed and that they could not prepare anything for us. Ther were several tables with people who had not been served food yet - they were looking at menus! So apparently if we had a reservation the kitchen was open?

I spoke with two couples my wife and I met at the hotel about the food there. Neither one was impressed and apparently the service was slow. I won't be back to find out.",98aiYT8rFlA05KSB_zbdfw,0,0,1,SpBuf9HUbiyiRtABbtPj9w

We ate there last Wednesday while on vacation and were seated immediately (although we were a little late for our reso)...BUT we sat there for 10 minutes before we even got a menu/water/hello! Nobody even acknowledged us for far too long! We finally got water then sat for another five+ minutes before we got menus and then the waiter briefly stopped by (he didn't introduce himself so I don't know his name but he was a larger guy), very unfriendly. He took our food order before he took our drink order...strange! Too make things worse, he took one person's drink order (4 total) and then he walked away real quickly and started chatting with another employee! ummm hello? the rest of of us would like a drink too! He came back after a minute and when someone asked where he went, his response was ""oh uh I walked over there for a minute"". Anyway, our food came out fairly quickly and it was very good. 4 stars for the food! Very similar to the Flemming's style food I'm used to...although N9NE in the Palms blows them all out of the water! 

Conclusion - If I'm spending that much money on dinner I at least expect the service that I get at Chili's!",WWUisS1rM3TGZdTDjo5x4A,0,0,2,r7HoBhSJE8w66fCII5BvWg
