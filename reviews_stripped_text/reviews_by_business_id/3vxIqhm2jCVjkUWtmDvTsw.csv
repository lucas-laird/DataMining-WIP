328549,2015-03-18,0,3vxIqhm2jCVjkUWtmDvTsw,"I lived in the Deep South for years, where fried chicken and fries are treated as high gourmet. My Alabama hometown of just under 30,000 residents had SEVEN different fried chicken joints, and that didn't include restaurants that also had chicken on their menu. There were 2 of Southern-style chicken finger places--Guthrie's (which has been around for over 20 years) & Zaxby's, another chain down South. Raising Cane's fits that mold.

Southern style fingers are reknown for their crispiness as well as flavor. While the fingers I had at Cane's were thunderously crunchy and volcanically hot (temperature, not spicy), the flavor was not really there compared to the Cane's franchise I had in Augusta, Georgia. I didn't experience the down south flave I craved. Luckily, their sauce was on point. The sauce is a standard at these places--a mayo/ketchup blend with differing doses of black pepper, garlic powder, and worcester. Cane's sauce tasted like home.

Bottom line: Raising Cane's is a chain that tastes like what Southern Style chicken fingers should taste like. A ""Box"" (another recurring combo throughout the South) consists of 4 fingers, fries, cole slaw, 1 sauce, a regular drink and texas toast. I always order an extra sauce (1 ain't enough) and a sweet tea to complete the meal. The toast is to wipe up any excess sauce. Food is cheap (less than $8 for a combo) and service is fast. Make sure to eat it immediately, while the chicken is still hot enough to burn yer mouth. The coleslaw is used to cool down yer wounds.",OKdLRP7nWMXHVHqPrkJUyA,0,0,4,TsBmFIX25LunDZj0_bnwTg

422528,2015-08-14,0,3vxIqhm2jCVjkUWtmDvTsw,"This is a MUST whenever I'm in Vegas. My Vegas trip just isn't complete without stopping by Raising Canes. One time my boyfriend and I even took a cab from the hotel just to pick up food from here. That's how badly we wanted raising canes. We had the taxi driver go through the drive thru lol. 

This place has forever raised my standards for a great chicken tenders. I have even had a dream that Raising Canes had opened a location in San Diego. What a beautiful dream...hoping one day it will become reality. I would easily sacrifice my local Chick Fil A or KFC for a Raising Canes. Writing this review is very painful, with the images of dipping that crispy chicken finger into the secret sauce haunting my mind.

I order the Caniac Box, it comes with 6 pieces, crinkle fries, coleslaw, Texas toast, two sauces, and a drink. Not a fan of coleslaw so substitute for extra toast and yes, the toast is amazing with a butter taste. The fries are average but at Raising Canes, all you need is the chicken, toast, and sauce. Use the sauce for everything, dip the fries and dip the bread. You will have to pay for extra sauce, but totally worth it.

Next time you are driving into Las Vegas, stop by Raising Canes to kick off your Vegas trip. In my opinion, Raising Canes is as much as a staple for Vegas eats such as Earl of Sandwich and Secret Pizza. Driving back home after a wild Vegas stay is depressing and sad, but stopping by Raising Canes on the way home may brighten your mood. Yes, I have done that before (3 Caniac Boxes to go please).

Finally, someone of higher authority did bring a single chicken finger in a box to my table without saying a word. I really did not care about the extra
chicken finger it is just the principal of offering a prize and not being willing to give the prize to the prize winner. I read all the fine print on the winning prize coupons and could not find where is says ""you must claim on a future visit"".

Unfortunatley for Cane's I will not be returning ever again to claim them and have been in the past a regular customer of their establisment.

Was looking for something quick to eat, but didn't want to go to any of the fast food chains we have here in LA.  I decided to check out Raising Cane's since it got good Yelp reviews.  Not having paid much attention, I realized after I entered that it's a chicken strips place.  Not really knowing what was best, I decided to order their most popular meal:

The Box Combo

I wasn't quite sure what Cane's Sauce was so I was game and decided to try it.  Had to get Sweet Tea with my combo and a little taste of the South that I like to indulge in when I can.

My order was to go and I dove right in after returning to my hotel.  The chicken strips were a little different than what I would expect from a fast food place, even a diner-like restaurant such as Denny's.  I could immediately tell these were white-meat pieces of chicken.  The batter wasn't anything special, but I appreciate the fact that they don't use formed chicken.

The fries were crinkle-cut which is also different from any other fast food place I've tried.  The Texas toast was probably the best part of the combo.  It was very soft inside and just slightly toasted enough to create a ""skin"".  The cole slaw was pretty good, too.  Needless to say, I pretty much devoured the entire meal as I was fairly hungry.  The sweet tea was just sweet enough, but not overly so.

I would make a trip back to try some of the other combos, but as with most other fast food, I would probably choose a healthier place like Subway first.  The staff was incredibly friendly, though!",K7vTmYHTnr0fjw807c8E2w,0,0,3,WN2ISBim_PP6IkenYC4clw

"" we don't have that either. ""  you mean. You're out of everything?

However, I'm a big fan of chicken fingers so my boyfriend took me here. I'm only giving it 3 stars for the following reason... when I was ordering, I asked the waitress to tell me about the secret sauce. I'm picky about my sauces. I prefer ranch and honey mustard so I was just asking her about it. Her response was well it's a secret sauce so I can't tell you what's in it. I didn't ask what's in it. I wanted to know is it spicy, mild, creamy? That pissed me off so I was in a bad mood by the time I got my food. I don't appreciate getting attitude from a 17 year old kid. It was my first time there. I was just asking a question. My food was good, but the girl at the counter ruined the moment for me with her attitude.

It is a blessing and a curse that this particular location is in the same shopping center as my work. It is amazing to see how much this business has grown. I remember when there were only 2 locations and now there are 7! It is no surprise considering that the food is so good. The menu is so basic, but it packs a little punch. The selection is variable, but a basic combo contains chicken fingers, fries, texas toast, coleslaw, and dipping sauce. 

The chicken is always cooked to perfection. (Except for during my last visit when it was overdone, but that was Black Friday and they were busy, so I guess I'll overlook that this time.) There is also a chicken sandwich available. It's just a sandwich with chicken tenders tucked inside. 

The crinkle cut fries are a little bland, but a little ketchup can always help that. Their texas toast is freaking amazing! A little crispy around the edges, soft and buttery in the middle. I'm not a big fan of coleslaw, so whenever I order, I always replace my coleslaw with an extra slice of texas toast. And that is the beauty of this place! If you find that you don't like something, you can always replace it with something else! 

The Cane's sauce is unlike any other dipping sauce I have ever tried. It kind of looks like thousand island, but the flavor is hard to explain. I have always loved it, but if you're not a fan, they have honey mustard available.

In all honesty, Raising Cane's does serve up some of the best tasting chicken strips I've ever had. And definitely the best I've ever had from a fast food joint. Every strip is fresh and prepared after they're ordered. They're super crispy on the outside and juicy in the middle but the best thing is there is zero grease on these strips. The fries were also nice and crispy on the outside and fluffy in the middle. The toast, slaw and sauce were all amazing too. Oh, and their sweet tea is perfect. Not overly sweet. Perfect. 

Prices are dirt cheap and service is fast and friendly.

It was the first time in awhile we've paid under $15 for a complete meal for two! Other than that, food was ehh okay for me.

FYI: So you kind of know where I'm coming from...I really don't eat at any fast food places, some as long since 1998. Only reason why we were here was 1. Mr. B. is a fan of this place and  2. Everything in the proximity of the outlets were all fast food and 3. I'm fasting for Lent and it's was no red meat Friday.

I ordered the smallest combo offered which was 3 chicken fingers, fries and Texas Toast and all I could think was it was super starchy! Lucky Mr. B ordered the larger combo that included coleslaw.  Since he doesn't like coleslaw and I hardly eat bread, I made a trade.  His coleslaw for my Texas Toast! I think it was a good trade! The coleslaw was nice and cold and crunchy..the dressing was a bit runny though.   Since I limit my intake of starches, I skipped eating the fries too.  Not a fan of the crinkle cut type anyway.   Chicken was good though. Good sized and pretty meaty and the batter was perfect golden brown and didn't fall apart when you took a bite. 

This place was pretty small  but easily accommodated everyone even though it was pretty busy. Set up: order and pick up your food when it's ready kind of deal.

1876830,2011-02-18,4,3vxIqhm2jCVjkUWtmDvTsw,"Yummm! That about sums up my experience at Raising Cane's. Not much more to really say other then this place has really good fried chicken. It's a shame that none have opened up in California yet, but with chicken this good, it's definitely just a matter of time. 

However, before I rave about Raising Cane's, I feel that I need to respond to a negative review about the place from a certain Elite '11 member from Henderson, Nevada that yelped how Raising Cane's is ""really expensive"" for chicken fingers and that the 5 star reviews awarded by reviewers were mostly from ""Californians who are deprived of food that doesn't taste like absolutely nothing"". Come again? Those darned double negatives can be so baffling.

In regards to the price, Raising Cane's flagship combo is the ""Box Combo"", which consists of four generously proportioned chicken fingers, French fries, a slice of toast, a side of coleslaw, a side of sauce, and a drink that costs $6.79. Hardly a wallet buster! 

Moreover, compared to KFC' similar combo meal, the Variety Big Box Meal, which consists of a drumstick, a chicken strip, popcorn chicken, two small sides, a biscuit, and a drink that costs $5.99, the price difference of $0.80 seems hardly expensive, let alone ""really expensive"". And seriously, this member has probably never been to Chick fil-A where a 4-piece chicken strip meal costs $6.49. 

And the audacity to imply that Californians do not know what food tastes like and that California is the land of no seasoning is a gross misstatement. Seriously, apart from the Las Vegas area, the state of Nevada is nothing but a large sandbox with its total population (2.7 million) being less than that of the city of Los Angeles (3.8 million). Additionally, many of the restaurants along the Las Vegas Strip are spin-offs or branches of restaurants that were started by renowned chefs in California. Therefore, I really think the Elite '11 status of this member should be revoked. 

Anyways, back to Raising Cane's. The chicken is au natural and is made from premium chicken that isn't frozen. For a fast-food restaurant this is a rarity. It's one thing to say your chicken is 100% chicken, but to also proclaim that your chicken is never frozen is a testament to the freshness and quality of the food being served. As for the breading, the spices infused with the seasoning yelped of Southern flavoring. Trust me, I've been to the South (Alabama, Texas, the Carolinas), and for a fast-food restaurant, this is as close to authentic as you will get for $6.79. I literally enjoyed every bite. In fact as I ate, I ended up taking a huge ass bite of my lower lip. Yet despite my bleeding and swollen lip, I continued to inhale my chicken fingers like a whale pausing only to catch my breath and to dip my chicken into Cane's special ketchup/mayo/pepper/spice sauce. 

As for the coleslaw, fries, and Texas toast, they were okay, but I honestly didn't give a shit because the chicken was so ""finger-lipping"" good!

In regards to the drinks, Raising Cane's has your standard fountain drinks. But the real highlight is their sweet tea, which is really sweeeeeeeeeeeeet. While I'm sure it contains buckets of sugar (hence its sweetness), what kind of hypocrite would I be if I were counting calories at a fried-food restaurant? 

So, if you too would like to enjoy being a glutton for a day, hop into Raising Cane's to indulge in really good fried chicken... and definitely be sure to wash down all that yummilicious fried goodness with Raising Cane's sweet tea.",j1981ubRRPjeRTx9UkMJ5g,4,5,4,CycV4QPTgplh-49ga_vKhQ
1882768,2010-12-07,2,3vxIqhm2jCVjkUWtmDvTsw,"Raising Canes is a great addition to any city. And Las Vegas is the first time I've seen one.  Maybe it's only in LV?  I dont know. 

I used to hate on this place, only because I knew they just served regular ol' chicken fingers.  Until I actually tried it, and I was an idiot for hating on something I never even tried.

Not too hungry on this particular day, so I kept it simple with the Box Combo instead of the Caniac Combo that I usually get. Quality was what I would expect from a typical Cane's location. Definitely have to get extra Cane's sauce! And I found out you can special order your friends to be extra crispy. Trust me it's worth it, because they have to make your fries extra fresh!

Service is excellent here, no complaints from me. And since there are so many Cane's locations in Vegas, it wasn't too packed. This would NEVER happen in SoCal. To be fair, we did actively avoid the Cane's location that was closest to the Strip. That decision paid off in spades!

Parking is incredible easy here. Thank god for that.

The menu is super simple; you order pretty much based on how many chicken strips you want. Their ""Box"" combo includes 4 chicken fingers, crinkle fries, a thick slice of Texas toast (buttery, garlicky and grilled), coleslaw and a cup of their lovely sauce, plus a drink. 

I love the following: the crinkle fries, since no one has them anymore; the chicken, which is crispy without being bready, moist without being soggy; the coleslaw tastes nothing like the slop at other chicken places; their sauce is to.die.for.; and they use crushed ice in their drinks, which I love, but I'm not sure why.

Tips: you can purchase extra sauce, but it you sauce properly, one cup should do it. If you bring your dog through the drive thru, they'll sometimes give you a dog biscuit. Any business that has a soft spot for my pup is a good business!",__RoSKn4Y5gImPoRkwJACQ,2,1,5,RWJiwxtWqmTSxTZde93k-Q

ADD the sauce and they instantly become better! The other negative is that while they are served hot, they are not crispy like they should be. The fries were really salty and the Texas toast buttery and ok.

The Box Combo - Shared this with a friend and it was the perfect amount.  I'll start with the chicken fingers.  Obviously freshly battered and fried which makes a huge difference in the overall quality of the product.  Moist, tender, crispy, and simply seasoned.  The Canes sauce goes heavy on the cracked pepper, which I didn't mind at all.  The fries will crinkle cut fries which I think are fitting to the type of meal that is being served.  The coleslaw was pretty standard and on the sweet side.  The toast well...... I mean who doesn't love a warm, crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside thick piece of white bread with butter slathered on one side? YUM!

OVERALL:  Pretty good place for what it is.  You don't find places that focus on chicken fingers so it's a great alternative for those who aren't so much into the 93457203975209384 burger joints in this country.

They are not only super juicy for white meat (cause I usually order dark meat due to the juicy factor-the breast and the white meat tenders are my least favorite) but the crispy factor was on point. It wasn't oily or flavorless. The crunch was memorable along with the taste.  
I wasn't too impressed with the fries-kinda so so- tasteless and a little oily. But the canes sauce they serve is a great dippin sauce- seems like a combo of mayo, ketchup and spices.

Pros
Chicken strips were juicy and tender

Cons
Not enough crust on chicken 
Flavor was nothing spectacular
Fries lacked salt 
""Famous sauce"" was just ehhh..

Heres the breakdown...

Chicken fingers: thumbs waaaaaaay up.  The chicken was moist and tender.  There was just enough coating and just enough crispy-ness to the outside.  I can eat 10 of them just by myself!! The special dipping sauce makes these fingers unbelievable. 

Texas toast: thumbs up!  Crispy and buttery outside.. soft and fluffy on the inside.  You can taste the artery clogging butter on the toast! YUMMM

Sweet tea: mind blowingly good.  So good that we had to grab a jug of the ish to go.  My bf wants to stop by Cane's on our next vegas trip and get jugs of the tea to mix with our booze!

Fries:  good but i've had better.

Verdict?  The chicken is damn tasty.  It may seem pricey but its a lot better than going to the strip and having dinner somewhere.  If you're looking for a good place to go after a drunken lunch on the strip head here for some meaty goodness.",f_Sv7cOH7ZLdYeZXMr2fjQ,1,0,5,AnNGr5mG7CIHewotZZiPXQ

We ordered the 6 piece with crinkle fries, a texas buttered toast, coleslaw and a huge drink all for under $10.00! The chicken was freshly fried (was worried since nobody else was in there)

The chicken strips were nice and hot, huge strips.  Good batter, the sauce had a tang and accompanied the chicken very well.  Fries were nothing special.  The toast, oh my the toast was so good!!

In-n-Out just might have some competition now.  Once i get off the plane, it's not so simple anymore; do i want chicken fingers or animal style fries?  It's so close to my parents' house that I have yet another option for food once the gambling hunger kicks in after a night at the tables.

The menu is simple: chicken fingers, and more chicken fingers.  I was baffled at how tender they can get the chicken.  I feel like i'm almost eating healthy! (operative word: almost)  The cane's sauce which I was specifically briefed on, was awesome.  What's their secret?  You could dip anything in that sauce, and I did.  The texas toast, fries, and chicken fingers all taste like little pieces of heaven when dipped in said sauce.  THE SAUCE!!!

My fiance is much less picky with fast food philosophies, and since Raising Cane's is so well-loved with Yelpers, I was convinced to give it a try, at the potential risk of sinking my teeth into Mystery Meat masqueraded as Chicken Fingers.

Well, the reward for my bravery was quite satisfying.  The chicken fingers tasted clearly to be good-quality chicken meat (more like pulled chicken, not minced chicken), moist, tender and flavorful.  The batter was also among the best, crispy without being too greasy.  The sauce is so delicious that I'd like to make this offer: if any Yelper knows the recipe to this sauce, please private message me for a bid.

Basically, they sell chicken tenders, fries, coleslaw, this great buttered lightly toasted thick bread.  And that's about it.  Oh yeah, and their own ranch style dipping sauce.  I think its good that they stick to one main thing only.  So, what you can order are combinations of the items above.

Nice hello greeting when you enter.  Friendly staff.  They keep the tables fairly clean when it's busy.  They seem to do great business whenever I'm there.

Two side notes: I hope they start opening these in the LA area.  And the bottled water - the bottled water, I don't know what it is, but it's like super cold and good.

I honestly try to stay clear of places with drive thrus, but you can't pass up regional fast food that doesn't exist in your neck of the woods.

This chain only serves ""chicken fingers"" and its mainly based out of the south. The two closest to the west coast are both located in Vegas. They boast of the ""fresh, never frozen"" deal, and you can totally tell.

The chicken strips really taste homemade, the white meat is juicy and the chicken is dipped in batter by hand. They cook them to order so the strips come out fresh, hot, and crispy, seriously like they were made in someone's kitchen. The menu is limited (they focus on the chicken fingers) and meals come with crinkle fries, texas toast, and their signature dipping sauce.",dR-nXFsZESpQMsieXvHcWw,3,1,5,xxxM9kRKV-lnsxVOCNA1vQ

This Raising Cane's is located at the Las Vegas Outlets, so you can only imagine how crowded and busy it can be.  And if you think the one on Flamingo is a better bet, think again, it's just as crowded. We came during the lunch rush, it was also Labor Day too.  They also happened to have an event going on, a race car driver was there and they had a giveaway for a ride in his car.  I shared with my boyfriend, we ordered the Caniac which is 6 chicken fingers, Texas toast, coleslaw, fries, and a drink. Just as I remember it, tender and juicy.  As some may have said before, be careful on the first bite, these things are HOT, not spicy but temperature.  I think they cook the chicken to order.  I really like the sauce, it's peppery with the right amount of tangy-ness.  I think that's the whole reason I go!  If you haven't tried the sauce you should, because I didn't at first and didn't like the chicken, but the combo with together it tastes amazing!  The fries are standard, tastes like the Ore-ida brand.  If you like sweet tea, the sweet tea is good, especially with during the hot Vegas weather.  I like that they service the drink with crushed ice, I like it better than the cubes.  Personally, I don't like the toast, I feel it needs something else.  Maybe next time, I'll spend the sauce on it to see how it tastes, maybe that's what it needs.  Enough of this fatass talk...

There are basically 4 selections to choose from and they range from a plate with 3 chicken fingers to 6...or a sandwich.  Fries and a drink included for a very reasonable price.  The chicken fingers are like nothing we have tried before...lightly breaded, deep fried, tasty and not greasy at all.  In fact after ordering ""The Box"" (4 chicken fingers, coleslaw, fries and a drink)...I really only needed one napkin.  My wife thought the chicken fingers were great but commented that the crinkle cut fries were more like the frozen fries you buy in a bag at the grocery store.  I have to agree...they were nothing special.  The much raved about dipping sauce was also very good.  A slight zing and mild black pepper taste added to the wonderful flavor of the chicken fingers.  The coleslaw was also tasty.  The restaurant was clean with ample seating...and the staff very friendly.

PREVIOUS REVIEW:
I'm new to Las Vegas and I'm a UNLV student. The school gets Raising Cane's catering for nearly every event and it's always delicious. When I found out there was one near my new apartment, I was excited to try it. 

The first day, I stopped by at about 2:30 on a Thursday afternoon. I went through the drive through and it took nearly 10 minutes for my food to come out. When it did, it wasn't very warm either. I chalked it up to a bad day and didn't say anything. 

Tonight, my boyfriend went to get take out for dinner. Once again, it took forever for our food to come out and since there was such a line behind him, my boyfriend didn't check the order before he left the restaurant. We ordered a combo and asked that instead of fries we get a second slice of toast, instead, we got double fries and no toast, even though the receipt had our order written out correctly. Also, I ordered a 3 piece chicken strips and instead, I got closer to 2 1/2. The third strip was basically a glorified chicken nugget. I really should have taken a picture. 

Overall, I would definitely recommend Raising Cane's for their food and catering but this particular location has issues, especially with to-go and take out. I'd go to another location or check out any of the other restaurants in the mall nearby.",sgTRJRhaGL__BsJcWaE3qQ,0,0,4,1-79e3_m4g20eOIEbvgrMg

Walking inside there were tons of people and the line was fairly long but it being right by the outlets could be why it was crowded, just saying lol. The menu wasn't very big, it was quite limited. I expected more variety and more side dishes. I ordered a 3 strip combo which came with fries, bread and special sauce. The chicken was good don't get me wrong but it just didn't blow me away like I thought it would. The strips had a crispy crust which is always a plus, the fries were mediocre nothing special. The special sauce looked like thousand island dressing kind of but it sure didn't taste like it, can't explain the taste but it was a bit peppery but very good. Now the bread was my favorite part of the meal, it looked like it was a grilled hot dog bun of some sort. It was buttery and had a hint of garlic, it was so good!

Discovered this past weekend, I paid $5.99 for 3 chicken fingers, texas toast, fries and a drink.  Don't underestimate this meal, it actually will make you full. Included with the chicken fingers is their famous Cane sauce which reminds me of the spread at In-N-Out. So delicious, you want it in every bite. I even dipped the toast in it. Located on Las Vegas Blvd so if you're coming from California, make sure to stop by this place before you check into your hotel (and when you're heading back too). 

Really good, satisfying food. Will definitely go again because it's cheap and worth it! Better than Chick fil A in my opinion. Only because their sauce and bread makes them unique!",DxgEnAWzPUEuXEMfhU8yjw,0,0,5,2A83BzdSgwGUx1XeiavjnQ

Once I dip the chicken (and the fries, and the toast) into the Cane's sauce, any complaints of sogginess go out the window and all I want is more sauce. The fresh-squeezed lemonade and reasonable prices ($6.29 for three fingers, fries, toast, and a drink) are also appreciated.

I absolutely love their freshly squeezed lemonade, and one trick I do to make sure I enjoy every drop of it is ask for no ice because if you don't they will surely serve you ice with a shot of lemonade.

Service
The service at this Raising Cane's is exceptional for a fast food chain. They are usually so friendly, they might even inch out In-N-Out for friendliest service in this category. They have employees cleaning other patrons' messes (more on that later), bringing patrons their food, retrieving patrons' finished trays, et al. They are truly best in show (ahem, pun intended) when it comes to service to customer. Which leads to ...

Customers
I have never met a bigger group of obnoxiously loud, rude, messy people. Not in an elementary school cafeteria will one run into such mayhem. They leave enormous messes on tables, under tables, on seats, under seats, et al. They are the loudest day and night, weekday and weekend. 

The first time I patronised this location, I imagined it was because teens from a nearby school come here to act like idiots. ""Damn, these kids really need to get the fuck out of here"" is what I thought. It was not the kids. 

It is epidemic. It does not matter what time of day I visit. This location consistently has a cockfighting ring aspect to the ambiance in terms of noise and messiness. The employees are running around trying to clean all the preposterous messes left behind; however, it is a losing battle. 

This location is a lost cause. 

--------------------------------------------------­­­­­­­­­­­­­-----------------------

I don't expect enough peace and quiet to be able to meditate at any fast food establishment. But, I also don't patronise a restaurant -- fast-food or otherwise -- to acquire a rare headache or feel the urge to stuff tissue in my ears so that the decibel levels can be mitigated.

The food is good, the chicken could use more flavour but that's what the 'secret' sauce is for.
9/10 times the fries are good. Sometimes they aren't salted enough and taste like straight potato. But there are salt packets so it's not big deal. And in my opinion the price is very fair. For a little more than $7 you can get the Box Combo.
I'd recommend subbing the coleslaw out (which is decent) for a second texas toast or more fries, extra finger, etc...

They are constantly cleaning the restaurant which I like very much since I am a clean freak, even though my room looks like a pigsty. The tables are usually cleaned within minutes after the previous customer has left, and they are constantly sweeping the floors and wiping the windows.

Reading some of my other Vegas Yelp friend's reviews, I bookmarked this place in hopes I could talk Minh into going before we hit up the outlets, which by the way is in the same area as this place!

Don't look for anything fancy here; it's just a good ol' drive thru fast food joint. Except when you walk in ::drum roll:: its clean smelling and clean looking! All the employees are actually happy to be working and even greet you! 

Since we were having a late lunch, we decided to share a meal and went with ordering:

The Box Combo:
Four Chicken Fingers 
Fries 
Coleslaw 
Cane's Sauce 
Texas Toast 
Regular Drink

There is plenty of seating inside, we found a booth but wasn't 100% clean. Maybe we sat down too quick. An employee was walking by so I asked him if he would not mind cleaning out table. Instead of the rude yeah okay. He was nice about it and even said sorry that the tabletop was not totally clean. 

Our number was called and Minh went to go get our food. When he got back to the table, the box was huge. The smell was inviting and the taste was the best! The chicken tenders were lightly seasoned and juicy! I had a bite of the coleslaw and that was pretty darn good too! Texas toast was out of this world yummi (I paid dearly for it over the next couple of days since I cannot really eat bread anymore) but it was worth it! Light and buttery this toast was thick!

The Cain sauce had an interesting taste; it was a unique and went well with the fries (which were not oily) and the chicken strips!

Raising Cane's was built from a dream one guy had. When others turned him down for loan he didn't give up instead he hustled and built his dream on his own. Todd Graves story is amazing along with his dog who the business is named after! 

I'm hoping that they will bring this urber rad fast food joint to sunny California soon, otherwise this will be on my list of must have again before we go shopping!!!",coKnuxLznH0FHb34m4ZLCw,14,15,5,Cvhwk9GRQQeeAleheHcv7g

Bf and I were faced with a dilemma: eat two buffets in one day or get a snack and then close out the night with a buffet. Me? I was down for the former, but he wanted to save room for Green Valley Ranch's Feast Buffet, so we chose to get a snack instead. We hit the location near the outlets, because that was closest to Henderson. It was 2 pm on a Friday and the booths were all full, but the tables in the middle were open.

They basically have chicken finger combos that come with Ore Ida-cut fries, 2/3/4/6-pieces, a piece of buttered-and toasted-to-perfection Texas toast, a 21-ounce drink (self-serve), a small container of coleslaw and a small container of mystery dipping sauce (looks like a combo of Thousand Island dressing with Ranch). The bf and I shared a #1, which was a 4-piece, it was about $7 and it was the perfect snack before a buffet three hours later. We added another soda for $1.59, and I like that they don't try to gouge you on the drinks just because the combos seem really affordable to me.

The chicken was crispy and moist, and it wasn't overpowered with batter. There was a generous portion of fries and they were fried to just the right touch of golden goodness. The slaw was tasty, as was the dipping sauce. Sweet tea is always too sweet for me, so I usually do about 1/2 sweet and 1/2 unsweetened for that perfect combo. I love that they used crushed ice and they serve Coke, not Pepsi. The place is clean, service is really friendly.

Cainiac Combo: 6 chicken fingers, cole slaw, 2 special sauce, french fries, texas toast and a large drink (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/raising-canes-las-vegas-3#FjvP2zipmRzAiCj7LdHOFA)

Kid's Meal: 2 chicken fingers, french fries, 1 special sauce and an apple juice box.

The guys who work here are super friendly and definitely work hard!  As soon as you find a seat, they make sure your table is wiped down.  A few minutes later, someone will walk around with food and call your name out.  

French Fries - They tasted like the Ore Ida-cut fries from the frozen bag.  It was cold, soggy and some fries were frozen.  After 4 pieces of french fries, I was done.

Chicken Fingers - They were actually juicy and seasoned well, but that sauce was nasty.  I wasn't sure how a lot of people could like this sauce because it just tasted like mayo, ketchup, Worcestershire sauce, and some garlic powder. It really had a heavy mayo taste and it actually turned me off.  When I walked up to the guy and asked him for BBQ sauce, he said they didn't have any but had Louisiana hot sauce.  So, I mixed hot sauce and ketchup and dipped my chicken fingers and it was definitely better than the weird sauce they gave us. 

Cole Slaw - Oh this was gross and had a weird taste.  I think it was loaded with MSG or something because I got thirsty all of a sudden.  I hope they can get KFC's recipe for cole slaw! 

Texas Toast - Holsum's Texas Toast from your neighborhood grocery store can be found here at Raising Cane's!   Nothing really special about their toast here, except it's soft and buttery. I've had better garlic toast at my local diner. 

Overall, the service is awesome and the workers are super friendly.  It has a family-friendly vibe and it's a perfect place for soccer moms to take the kids here after the game.  After all, the food is cheap and so is the quality.",N4K69ZdyU-B8NzVYxwjK0A,13,13,1,6GBkagsYLspy-BjHS5HVxQ

This is likely also a good place for the weekend visitor from LA to stop by on their drive back.  It's just a few short minutes from the strip to the South and has a drive thru.

The chicken fingers are juicy, flavorful, and the ""Cane Sauce"" is uniquely sweet, tangy and practically drinkable.  I was tempted to order more, but one little tub was enough for 3 chicken fingers.  In addition to this, the fries are a bit on the soggy side, but the Texas toast is firm and slightly crunchy.  In fact, this is how I imagine Texas toast should be like.

Considering all the fat and oil in a simple 3-piece meal, I didn't feel it seeping out of my pores like some fast food makes me feel.  It wasn't a pick-me-up or anything, but it didn't put me to sleep right away either.

BRING ONE TO SOCAL! 5 Stars for doing what you do, really really well.

These tenders have the crust and texture of a crunchy thick juicy piece of fried chicken, but... it's chicken tender? Definitely not like your typical breaded chicken tender.

They only have ketchup for your fries and their secret sauce for the chicken, but their sauce is all you need, I would get extra.

So now you already have a reason to come here... but wait! 
DON'T FORGET THE TEXAS TOAST, IT'S UH-MAZING! 
I always get extra toast instead of coleslaw. It has the softness and slightly sweet taste of a sesame burger bun but they cut it in 2inch thick fluffy slices and toast it on a griddle with garlicky butter. 

ALSO, I normally don't like sweet tea, but there's definitely something special about their's.

Every time I've gone there, I've had excellent service.

I never had chicken fingers piping hot from the deep fryer. It's finger-licking good I tell yah.

The Bread: I don't usually like having bread with my meals since it makes me full faster but how can you resist Texas Toast. Trust me, get 2 orders.

What to order: If you're petite, go for the 3 Finger Combo and add an extra Texas Toast. The combo comes with 3 chicken fingers, crinkle fries, Texas Toast, Cane sauce and a drink.

For you man-eaters, get the CANIAC: 6 Chicken Fingers, Extra Crinkle fries, Coleslaw, 2 Cane sauces, Texas Toast and a drink.

I don't understand why this place hasn't made it to California. Cane's will give Chick-fil-A a run for its money. Definitely the chicken fingers at Cane's are better, especially with the sauce.",BLy4QAUjzBraRRqh_Jdy1Q,0,0,4,z--PL17qqRn30fCECcG08A

and the question I leave with...

""why isn't there one in the bay area?!""

Brief Summary
- Fast Food
- Limited Menu, but good at what they do
- ONLY Chicken Fingers
- get the CANIAC meal
- why isn't there one in the bay, dammit?!

OK so first off, I was born and raised on fried chicken. All my Filipino family loves fried chicken. My favorite is Popeye's because that's what we have out here in the Bay. NOW if there was a Raising Cane's in my area, I'd be there! 

They ONLY make Chicken Fingers. Which is basically a smaller chicken strip. They're super juicy, fried and crispy. And you dip them in the special CANE sauce. I don't  know what it is about the Cane's sauce, but it's really good. I'm usually a bbq or ranch fan but man give me some Cane's special sauce and I'm good to go.

I like their simply wavy cut looking fries. They're NOT cris-cut frieds but they're pretty simple and I like that they're simple. Not overly salty and not overly crispy.

I love the TEXAS TOAST. My family is a big fan of carbs especially bread and rice. So the texas toast is somewhat similar to Sizzler's garlic cheese toast minus the garlic and cheese. I don't know it's nothing super special but it's tasty.

I usually get the coleslaw too with my meal. I've always loved coleslaw, and I wouldn't rate Cane's coleslaw as the best, I say it's decent and it tastes good. With all the food in my Caniac meal, it's a good contrast to the fried and toasted.

What do I drown it all down with? oh yes, SWEET TEA. I love tea, especially sweet tea. Which is why cane's is so great. It's simple and it's to the point. It doesn't cost an arm and a leg but you get so much food. Caniac is like 8 bucks.

For those picky and people with their noses up *ahem*, expect a simple and tasty meal. If you want a whole bunch of selection go somewhere else. I don't know why people always try to expect a lot out of a simple place like Cane's. They're good at what they do and they stick to it! Why not be good at one thing instead of being mediocre at a whole bunch of things?!

I love Cane's and hope they open one out here in the Bay Area. It would make a killing where I live. I've been to this location and another and I loved this one just a tad bit more. The people were super friendly and it was pretty busy but they keep everything going and get tables cleaned pretty quickly.",-HBdisZOrgMdw08zCWZ_kg,0,0,5,qIO3-poNEpMUGfD9WYkNUw

Location Overview:
Although this is the ""closest"" location (still pretty far) for any Henderson Residence, it is well worth the drive. The location is in a good area. This Raising Canes is next to an outlet mall and other food places. The location is good. No bad area other than the highway which is about half a mile away. A little congested with traffic but decent movement.

Customer Service:
I have gone to this specific location numerous times and I have always had great customer service. The employees show nothing but courtesy welcomes and a good experience. 

Food Quality/Quantity:
The quality of this food has been more than perfect every time. I have never had any disappointing feelings towards the food quality at this location. Everything comes out hot and ready to eat. The quantity is more than enough. I have seen a 3 piece combo meal fill up a grown man and he is plenty full. 

Side Notes: It does take a little bit of extra time for the food to come out. This location is almost always busy with customers.",e6FGtUMpBp18xfZOmpbw8w,1,1,5,vr0RXgtFt8WyhegY0LoAiw

Needless to say, my expectations were pretty high. 

Well, we ended up going to Raising Cane's on Sunday afternoon, right before our drive back home. Why we decided to do this, I'm not sure, but thinking back...wow, we were stupid! Anyone who has been through 48 hours of Vegas chaos should know that you probably won't be feeling too great by the time you're through. I managed to take a bite or two of everything - yes, the chicken tenders ARE that moist, the toast IS that good, and the sweet tea IS that clean - before I started feeling nauseous. After about 10 minutes, I had to admit defeat; I closed the lid on my ""Box Combo"", laid my head down on it, and waited for my friends to finish.

The best part was the sauce.  Most of their meals comes with one or two, but I ordered an extra for 30 cents or something.  I guess the other best part was the freshly brewed sweetened tea.

For the unfamiliar, this is a fast food joint that specializes in one thing, and only one thing - chicken fingers. That's about all there is to this place. All they have are chicken fingers, fries, bread, their signature Cane's sauce (and basic sauces like ketchup), and drinks. Nothing else. There is ONE KIND of chicken finger, so if you're expecting a place like Buffalo Wild Wings where you can go in and get your chicken cooked in one of 15-or-so types of sauce, go back to sleep. Variety is the spice of life, and Raising Cane's doesn't have it.

The staff here are always friendly and have a positive attitude, however I find it annoying the way they ask for your name if you're dining in (this is so they can call you up when your order is ready.) Can't they just give a number like other fast food restaurants? 

And then comes the biggest blow of all - the food isn't that good. These chicken fingers are so oily inside that the outer breading practically hangs off of them. I have heard of people from the office I used to work at getting sick here, and after having tried these fingers, it isn't hard to see why. The fries are nothing worth writing home about, and I think they could easily have come out of a frozen Ore-Ida box. The so-called special Cane's Sauce is just fry sauce with a few extra spices thrown in (and it isn't special and unique in any way when you consider that the Chicken Now place in the nearby Outlet Mall has practically the exact same sauce.) 

For your chicken needs, go elsewhere. This place has a limited menu, lackluster food, and nothing that really makes it stand out. Nearly any other fast food restaurant has better chicken products and more menu selections.",qnJEn88UBRXh8kTCggNOWQ,2,0,2,g5eiPBqbi4fEQt0hC0cIiQ

Heard a lot of people rave about this place, so I had to give it a try when I came to Vegas, and it was pretty good. This location was pretty busy since it was near the outlets so it was a struggle to try to find parking, but finally got in, the service was pretty fast. The menu had some pretty good combo deals I went with chicken strips, fries, and toast deal and it was pretty good. The chicken strip was flavorful, the fries weren't too salty, the bread was my favorite part of the meal, yummy! Also the canes sauce really is crack, make sure to put it on everything, yum!

Overall, for a fast food joint, this place isn't too shabby; for a quick tasty bite in Vegas, id be back here for some chicken strips and toast :)

Something about the buttery, crispy deliciousness of the Texas Toast with the creaminess to the ambiguous Cane's Sauce (similar to a Thousand Island dressing with far more pepper) - it's euphoria in your mouth.

As for the chicken fingers, they are definitely better than what they used to be. When Cane's first came to Vegas, the fingers were dry and the downfall of the place. However, they have most certainly improved - moist and perfectly fried. The fries are decent, just sub-par crinkle fries that I tend to not even order. The slaw is good, but nothing extraordinary. 
Then there's the tea - a bit too sweet for my liking, but always consistently good. 

But I'm telling you, the toast and the sauce. All you need really. If anything, get the chicken on the side.",rzatTfGhdFwgyfAP9yhPLg,0,0,4,n0O4-XaQvcKke-DQ8nj3zw

I love coming here when I go to Vegas and their chicken tenders are amazing and I should know because if you ask any of my friends what I majorly order at restaurants, it is chicken strips/tenders. Don't believe me? I order it at BJ's, Yardhouse, Red Robin, Cheesecake Factory, and even as an appetizer dish from Denny's, Ihop, and Boiling Crab and there's mooooore lol. 

Besides that, if there was a Raising Cane's, I would probably go right now. Food is great, it's a fast food restaurant and the price is decent. Depending on location, it can be packed and the seating being limited. If any case, that would be my only thing about this location.

The place size is average, but you don't really have to worry about finding a seat. A table usually opens up every few minutes. Just order at the counter and wait till they call you up!

To be honest the chicken fingers and fries aren't spectacular nothing really taste worthy. But their texas toast is what makes up for it. When that warm crunchy bread hits your lips and you take a bite out of it, you'll just know...that this is not game. I don't know how to describe the flavor but it's just so damn good! I also love love love getting their iced tea! It's always on point and if you have a sweet tooth this is the perfect drink to go with your hot meal ^^.

Pro tip! You can substitute any of the items in your order for another item! I usually exchange the coleslaw for another toast :)

-Toast-- Yum for bread lovers. The slight sweetness of it really offsets everything else.
-Chicken-- Pretty damn good for chicken fingers! Lightly battered, crispy, and moist. Made the fries an ""ehh"" for me. And I love me some fries. Oh and I almost forgot about the coleslaw. Cuz it really didn't need to be there for me.

Raising Cane's chicken fingers completely shattered all my preconceived notions of what great chicken fingers were.  So moist and hot, they should come with a disclaimer, as the hot steam escaping from your first bite will surely burn you.  I doubt that one can even find chicken fingers so good in a sit-down restaurant setting.  The dipping sauce that it comes with is ok, akin to a peppery mayonnaise, but left me wishing that I had one of those little travel size Tabasco sauces.

All these 5 star reviews must be from Californians who are deprived of food that doesn't taste like absolutely nothing. California = the land of no seasoning; I would know, I lived there for 10 years. These reviews can not be trusted. Yeah, I said it. 

Their special sauce sorta tastes like paprika, salt, pepper, and mayonnaise? The honey mustard is decent. They charge $.50 for it but the first time I went the guy behind the counter gave me some for free. 

The fries are horrid. They're like the Ore-ida frozen crinkle cut fries. The chicken is good but it tastes exactly like what my mom and I  make at home from scratch for pennies. Homemade is ALWAYS better. 

I would love it if they served their food in something more biodegradeable; eat-in orders are even served in styrofoam takeout containers that are never gonna break down. :-(

Not heavily battered or greasy. The flavors were yummy, juicy & tasty. Making me want more but my eyes are always bigger than my tummy. I could only eat 2 & saved the other 2 for the next day!

Try it bc you will be pleasantly surprised! Normally I'm a true fan of CFA that I have to admit this Raising Cane's chicken strips were just as good if not better. Did I really say that?

I love that their focus is solely on chicken fingers.  The service is always friendly and the drive thru peeps are upbeat.

However, I can't give more than 3 stars.  You would think that a place that specializes only in chicken fingers and boasts that they are never frozen would really blow you away. But Raising Cane's just doesn't do that for me.

The menu is simple, which is great.  I usually get the most popular meal ""The Box,"" which comes with 4 chicken fingers, fries, cole slaw, texas toast and their special dipping sauce (which is the best part of the meal, IMO).

I like my chicken fingers to have a crisp coating, and these just fall short.  They were almost soggy, and I just wasn't impressed (I've eaten here before and I don't remember having any complaints, so maybe their quality has just gone down over the last couple years).  The fries are nothing spectacular.  They are crinkle cut, and I think I've had better from Ore-Ida.  I find the cole slaw to be tasteless. Same goes for the texas toast.  Yes, it is toasty, but I just don't think it had a lot of flavor.  The dipping sauce and sweet tea are really the only things that save this meal for me.  If I could bottle that sauce, I would.  Also, the sweet tea is refreshing and delicious.  Although, I figure it's pretty hard to screw up sweet tea.

I also think that they are a bit overpriced.  I was there a couple of days ago and 2 meals cost $16.  That's just crazy!

5726357,2014-10-05,0,3vxIqhm2jCVjkUWtmDvTsw,"How do they make the chicken here?

I always assumed it was magic because I have never had a bad chicken strip here. The consistency in the chicken is superb. It's always very moist. The menu is basically Chicken strips, more chicken strips, and a chicken strip burger. You won't find variety here unfortunately. The Texas Toast that they have here is also very good and very popular. It's a big, fat, soft, buttered piece of toast they provide with every meal (except the kids meal, and the burger, I believe). The french fries are nothing too special and the coleslaw is decent, although I always tend to substitute it for an extra piece of toast at no extra charge! I believe the sweet tea and lemonade is made in-house and very good. I don't remember the last time I haven't had the sweet tea here.

With this location in particular, you may find it VERY packed if you come at the wrong time. I believe since it's closest to the strip, and a lot of tourists have heard about this place. You might be waiting a while and scouting for a table. They have a drive through, but you might be waiting a bit as well if the line gets pretty long.

Prices are fairly reasonable, ranging from $7-$10 depending on how many chicken strips you want and how big the drink is with the combo.

I would stop and try this if you haven't been to a Canes before. This is a big favorite for locals here in Las Vegas. Everybody that I bring here for their first time ends up being addicted and finds themselves back here sooner than later!",2y_bUd6yJcZ1soCW5nppag,1,0,4,_33R4ORSlnfC_RHd7RLXJw

However.

Cane's puts it all together and pairs it with this SAUCE that I'm sure is just Thousand Island with some black pepper but It makes everything taste better. But then again that is the major flaw of Canes as well in that It needs this sauce to really cross the threshold of beyond ""average"" because without the sauce, the chicken fingers are quite bland and have very little flavor (tasting somewhat like Church's Chicken) despite being juicy and fresh-cooked to order.

The Texas Toast is what does it for me though. I love that bread and it's perfectly grilled every time! The Fries are average fries, there to look pretty and munch on after you are done with the toast and chicken.

The price is right though and the service is fast. Can't complain too much about this place, and the ambiance of the actual restaurant is good for just sitting and conversations.

Seriously though, I was sitting on 399 reviews for the longest time, thinking about what type of ""special"" restaurant I could review. But the more I thought about it, the more I realized that I'm just a simple dude who loves eating cheap, good food.

Listen, I love chicken. I can cook chicken a bazillion different healthy ways at home. But there's one thing I refuse to do at home, and that's deep frying. It's just too messy, too much of a hassle, and I can't stand looking at all that oil. But when I'm going out to eat, it's a completely different story. I search out for anything that's deep fried.

Thanks to Yelp, I had this place bookmarked for the longest time. On the next Vegas trip, we just had to check it out. The menu is pretty simple, as it all depends on how hungry you are for chicken strips. We opted for the ""Caniac"" combo, which comes with 6 chicken strips, fries, dipping sauce, cole slaw, toast, and drink for about $8. What a steal, and it was enough to feed for 2.

The chicken strips were of high quality, not greasy at all, not frozen, and not overly coated with all that breaded nonsense. When I took a bite, it was nothing but juicy, moist, and flavorful chicken. Dipped in their ""special"" sauce, it was even better. The sauce is a bit hard to describe, but there's definitely mayo, ketchup, and various spices like garlic, cayenne, and black pepper. 

The crinkle fries were good, not soggy, crisp on the outside, which is all you can ask for. The surprise, for me, was how good the Texas toast and cole slaw were and how well they complimented the chicken fingers. The grilled toast with butter and garlic was tasty, and the cole slaw was cool and refreshing. I couldn't stop eating the stuff.

If I had things my way, I wished there was the option of more spice with everything. Maybe spicy chicken fingers, some hot sauce, or even a nice red squirt bottle of Siracha. For a fast food joint, I'd take these chicken fingers over something from Chick-Fil-A any day of the week. We seriously need one in SoCal. Now.",KFZISl5mOUJ6bu3qCUrO-g,12,8,5,4DKggvzGRJEDdqQs8d3pJA

The 3 finger combo (pic included) should be appropriately changed to the middle finger combo.  3 chicken fingers, fries, buttered toast (more butter is needed), and a 22 ounce soft drink for $7.  

The chicken was nothing to write home about.  The word Ore-Ida crossed my mind when devouring the fries.   

I can write more about my meal here, but why take up more of Yelp's space...........",4WLBYT9wHBcK-nQxiNvn8Q,12,9,2,knq3rjNRu9rFpQm05WCsXg

Staff is friendly, efficient and takes pride in their work that is seen in everything they do.  From cleaning tables, to cooking food, greeting and serving customers.
The chicken was obvious quality, white meat chicken breast in fingers.  It was moist and not heavily breaded.
Really wish they had one in Oregon",lex0WaQ3yVhhRmvL2Ln2mQ,0,0,5,GC5sIa5EdSE7EW6GxxZOHA

I ate here for the first time only a few short months ago and I can't believe I never discovered this place sooner. Every time I come in (which lets face it, it's at least once a week) the staff is always friendly and the service is quick.

For $6 I can get 4 hot, perfectly seasoned chicken fingers, a whole lotta crinkle fries, the most amazing, buttery Texas toast I've ever ate and to top it all off... I get this blissful little cup of Cane's sauce, which is to die for. Really, $6? Best value for the quality of ""fast food"" you get...I can't even get out of McDonald's that cheap.

Hold up....let me circle back for just a moment. Did I tell you home much I love the Cane's sauce? I dip EVERYTHING in it (including my fingers!). You only get one with your meal but I am willing to sacrific my coleslaw side for them to throw in an extra one for me. Plus if you need more, they're like 19 cents. Big whoop. 

This place is what dreams are made of ;) Swoon!",Z6sMdVaYrFoAOL-Kbc7b3Q,1,2,5,Nsg2c-JIVib-z7offn-ViA

If you are new, I suggest you get ""The Box Combo."" It includes all their goodies: 4 Chicken Fingers, a side of fries, coleslaw, their infamous Cane's sauce (which I think tastes like Thousand Islands with some seasoning), Texas Toast, and a drink of your choice. 
Also, if you've got a big appetite, I suggest you get ""The Caniac Combo."" It is exactly what it sounds: 6 Chicken Fingers, extra fries, coleslaw, 2 Cane's sauce, Texas Toast, and a large drink! They also have a kid's meal.

Chicken fingers are just perfect
Special sauce is on point 
Texas toast was a nice addition 
The fires aren't really that good and unnecessary in my opinion.

I always make it a point to stop here on the way in to Las Vegas and on the way out. I love everything about this place, from the sweet tea to the amazing dipping sauce!

The food is always fresh and comes out piping hot! The prices are great and the 6 piece combo is definitely enough to split between two people (but add an extra thing of Texas Toast because it is just that amazing).

The restaurant itself was pretty big. Since we were a big group we decided to order to go. We ordered the Hard Hat and passed on the cole slaw, so we got all Texas Toast. I loved it. The boneless chicken was so scrumptious. I like not working around the bone for my food, plus there's often leftover meat on those bones. The toast was delicious too! I ate more than my fair share of toast. We ordered a Pan of Crinkle-Cut Fries, which is essentially five orders of fries. Those complemented the rest of the meal so well! We chose a great place for dinner and I suggest anyone else interested in trying it out, does.

You can tell it actually came from a chicken breast! The menu here at Cane's is simple, you want chicken fingers with fries, coleslaw, Texas toast, or as a sandwich? Why complicate things? At least everything on the menu is good even the drinks! I love their sweet tea, and also their fresh squeezed lemonade, made fresh from real lemons everyday, (which by the way is not refillable and cost a few quarters more). Their secret ranch/ketchup/pepper dipping sauce is pretty bomb too, and if you want extra it's .50c more too, but hey am not complaining coz I LOVE their food! Also if you read up on their history it's pretty interesting too.

We got our meals quickly and happily ate our chicken fingers while we chatted. I'm still not a huge fan of the food, but I do like the sauce and Texas toast they serve with it.
