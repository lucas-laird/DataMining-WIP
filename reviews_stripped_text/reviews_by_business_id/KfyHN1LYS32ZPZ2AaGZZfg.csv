Tonight, I pulled into the parking lot and I parked crookedly (no one else was in the parking lot) and I walked into the subway. Some pansy little kid with the worst attitude told me to move my car. I told him no one else was in the entire parking lot being that this is at 9pm. He gave me the nastiest look I've ever received from anyone I was giving business to. His attitude was so rude, and I specifically remember this kid because he's always had a horrible attitude whenever I come in. He should not be working there if he is so miserable being there. From now on, I'm driving the extra couple miles to the next subway instead of this dump.",0eVEEn32XY5HM1KsBu3QzA,2,1,1,296PVnxGJCqbPH6lsKfSYw

When my friend went to get creamer for her coffee, the clerk yanked the basket away and said, No more!! We have to leave some for the rest of our customers"".  My friend bought a large coffee and wanted 6 creamers...that bitch had the audacity to refuse her condiments after we had each just spent over $5 each on their products!!!
Pay attention Winchells!!!  We work in a BIG BUSY office and will be spreading the word that your employees treat customers like shit!!!
We will not be spending any more of our hard earned money in ANY of your locations ever again!",C-v8Apu43MVeuFGm-8cYWg,0,0,1,Kd3eFtH3U5v8mAZPr4Sg8A

So I opted for the flatbread with chicken and provolone. When I got home, I started to smash and almost broke my tooth on the rock hard bread! Wont be going back there anytime soon.",Kw8ziiUHe4Kbti4mQTLZ-g,1,1,1,hYeMA75SwLIs0K7qcDAJIQ

2560933,2012-09-15,1,KfyHN1LYS32ZPZ2AaGZZfg,"Stood in line waiting for the only sandwich maker to finish helping the woman in line ahead of us. This gave me enough time to notice the horrifically disgusting method of curl-wrapping the sandwich around itself and cleaning off the mayo knife on the paper used to wrap the sandwich. It killed my appetite just watching it, and we left to check out somehere else.

I hardly see how a donut case coincides with eating fresh, I guess unless they've been freshly fried...  :-/",d8z9uG3SHTgkCNj5iVcG8w,1,0,1,_uZk89DclQnJRVnCqjRqaw
2598619,2014-01-13,2,KfyHN1LYS32ZPZ2AaGZZfg,"Do not give this Subway store any business.  On Sunday night, January 12, 2014 at 8:50 pm, I went to this Subway and was chased out of the store and verbally threatened and nearly assaulted by a worker there who was or maybe was the manager or the owner's son. It was because they did not have a certain kind of bread. He gave a smart ass remark about why they were out and I told him I was taking my business elsewhere. After an exchange of words, the worker chased me outside screaming and threatening to kick my ass all while his father stood in front of the store and did nothing. I called 911 and he continued to chase me, yelling and threatening to assault me. I had to go to the Albertson's across parking lot until the cops showed up. Worst experience ever in my life as a customer anywhere! Do Not Give this place your business!!!!",edJEj384w4_09sivk6VblA,5,1,1,f5uSIXrHAZ1piU5jtyC10Q
2891000,2016-10-03,0,KfyHN1LYS32ZPZ2AaGZZfg,"I've been to this Subway many times, including today. Service is always great, sandwiches are always fresh. I often get the BMT, either on whole wheat or flatbread. Super delicious. We also ordered a turkey and Swiss which was well made and savory with lots of oil and vinegar. The staff are always friendly and courteous, even when it's busy. Always had a good experience here! The cookies snd chips are also very good. We usually get our food to go; it's quick and easy to get in and out.",TmRKppBexBYGHtHaWE1w4w,0,1,5,SxrPxZn7VcSUxmU_y5_TfQ

 It was right before close so we had made it in during that last hour rush.  There was only one guy working the night shift.  I couldn't help but notice the conversation the employer was carrying on with the customers.  I guess about 10 minutes before we arrived some guys did a run out without paying and the cashier kept saying he was ""Robbed"".  Yea, I know... Just because its sandwiches that they took doesn't make it any less of a crime, but cum'on I just wanted him to stop talking over the food while he was making our sandwiches!!!

Anyway, we finally got our food and was out 30 minutes later.  That was the longest ear and mouthful Subway experience I'd ever experienced.",tzIlxRJz_Y3gXA9eNP7QAQ,3,1,1,NpXNxmz4ETg9p3LNv74fvg
3002843,2013-02-03,0,KfyHN1LYS32ZPZ2AaGZZfg,"Place was dirty.. Table, floors, counters, drink station.
The place is small and very crowded. They need to tint the store front windows or put shades. The sun beats in on the south facing windows. The donuts that are baking in the glass case as you walk in don't make the place any more appealing.
Won't return to this location.",YVQFzWm0H72mLUh-8gzd5w,3,0,2,PlWrchAVd9HaGm5bWAsRqQ
