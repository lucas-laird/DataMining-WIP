Aside from taking their time to take my order, they managed to cover my churros with an insane amount of salt. Cinnamon cream filling does NOT GO WITH SALT!! When I went to tell them about it, the lady had the nerve to laugh and didn't apologize. At least they gave me a fresh batch with sugar and cinnamon afterwards.

I get it, it's busy, but dude, this is like ultra ghetto scum in here. Tables were sticky. Bathrooms dirty. Yeah.

2762618,2018-05-13,0,AN6HjBZeEcLgekQawgmS3w,"The worst drive through ever in my in Las Vegas it's soooo bad I was waiting in the drive-through line for more than 20 min, and when I get to the screen order
they ask me to wait for a few seconds and nobody respond to me I was waiting around 10 min, and wen I went inside to speak with the supervisor or the one in charge I find a guy his name Kave i'm not sure if I spelled his name correct because nobody wearing name tag, so he told me ""i'm busy cooking so I can't take your order"", and the other lady whose taking the drive-through order "" says to me we have a bunch of locations in Las Vegas you can go to other location "" she's like kicking me out!! 
And I listen to her advice but i didn't went to Jack in the box, but I went to other restaurant. 
 Jack-in-the-Box Hiring Manager!! You should hire people who can manage this location better than losing business because I saw more than 3 cars change their mind from your bad customer service",VYVhtbbEqujIRt7zkZcbBw,0,0,1,5gqsVE5Be1nq7ech7s91Qw

2941773,2016-12-25,0,AN6HjBZeEcLgekQawgmS3w,"There are people who complain about their order getting messed up. You know what - it's hard for them to hear the drive-thru speaker box. Food gets messed up. It happens. 

My review isn't based on that though. 

My rating is based on my experience with an employee's lack of principles and morals. Order total was given, and I gave the cashier an amount that would give me change back. 

Which he didn't give me. 

When I asked about it, he turned the story around and stated that I had shortchanged him, refusing to print a receipt. Absolutely absurd.",Yv7bXizbRW48tRnb1GG9Qw,0,0,1,UOMBtT3ZWRqPRMm2-yucPQ

I gave them 3 chances. They must be doing the same thing to other customers unless it's a crazy conquincidence that is happened to me 3 times. 

I stop by here late at night to order the grilled stack munchkie meal. 

1st time: My order was done wrong, it had mustard, onions & ketchup. I called and was told, that's how they make it now. Smh. To find out, there excuse was, we have a new cook. 

2nd time: They put regular cheese instead of nacho cheese. They took forever for my order and I called the 800 number to share with them my experience & Rickie White the district manager said he will make sure this doesn't happen again since the excuse was ""we are short staffed"" 

3rd time: they didn't add nacho cheese and instead melted regular cheese. I emailed a video to Rickie again and he hasn't replied in 4 weeks.  

3 times with the same mistake. Don't take the chance everyone. Go to another location. 

Management here are rude & employees have no customer services.",JMU4hmWtKJ_fYnDgS_RFag,0,0,1,8r3Gb7gGj7_t4wWWNuCPrQ

5846630,2017-11-15,1,AN6HjBZeEcLgekQawgmS3w,"I normally avoid this location, but it was on the way home and it seemed convenient.. We had just arrived from a short road trip and decided to stop here, that way we didn't have to cook.

This location has horrible service, and seems to always be dirty. We went through the drive thru, and I ordered a couple of chicken sandwiches as well as a supreme croissant no cheese. I get my order and I check real quick to make sure there was no cheese before driving away (keep in mind it's kinda dark in the car) since it didn't have cheese I assumed it was ok.

We get home and I'm getting ready to eat my croissant, but as I picked it up, you could feel that the bread was hard. Unfortunately it was burnt! I tried taking the burnt parts off so I can try to eat it but it didn't help, the taste was disgusting. So I'm already upset cuz I had been starving and was looking forward to eating. 

At this point I had already decided to call and complain. But I'm still hungry so I figured I'd eat the chicken sandwich and then call. So I pull it out the bag, and it literally looked like someone stepped on it! I open it and it looked gross so I couldn't even eat it. Seemed like they played patty cake with it.. smh and they didn't give me a receipt either..

So I call and ask to speak with the manager. This gentleman gets on the phone, and as I start to tell him the situation, he responded as if he already knew we would call. He was quick to want to replace my food, and I wonder why? Probably because they knew the quality of food they gave me was disgusting! When I asked for his name, he mumbled it not wanting to give it to me.
Please avoid this location! Unless it was your last option lol",3ajSADFnm71e_Zcip_igWQ,0,1,1,PDS1jp_2lG-yNJiTbV6ZRg
