1049947,2017-03-12,4,vfqUUh_5KF3R7mz2XiNXGg,"Great restaurant, but terrible location for their business!

FOOD: Everything on their menu is made to order and taste fresh. I highly recommend getting the Salmon Sushi Pizza! It is my favorite item at this restaurant! The sushi lunch combo is always a great option when you are in the mood for sushi. It come with assorted nigiri and one roll. Everything tasted great, but everything takes a long time to prepare. I didn't mind waiting because every sushi piece was made with care, but if you're in a rush, I wouldn't recommend ordering sushi. They also offer hibachi and teriyaki dishes.

ATMOSPHERE: It's a cute and small restaurant. Unfortunately, it's located in a dead shopping center. Waiter was nice. Great place to get food for take out.",LTCxnnAQGaGZPHZx4KbvGA,9,7,4,E-bVYiPLdgXmS_Oe05KRxg
1435654,2017-02-24,0,vfqUUh_5KF3R7mz2XiNXGg,"This is my first time coming here and I was pleasantly surprised. It's a small restaurant, but everything is very clean and well put together. The workers/owner are all very nice and offered us waters as we waited for our order. We ordered to go and we didn't have to wait long. The way they pack the food is also organized which makes it easy to carry. The food honestly was awesome! I ordered a katsu and a Tokyo roll for myself. The Tokyo roll tasted as good as it looked (which was amazing by the way). The katsu was also really good. It was crispy and not oily at all. Plus they poked holes into the box lid to make sure that it would stay crispy. My grandmother ordered the pad thai with shrimp, and she was very pleased. She said she likes it because it's not spicy at all (she can't handle spicy food). I think we'll definitely come back.",c7yvLsrMb284dt3ZJ0s0wA,0,0,5,0SsSD6-YEYkPZ9B4lSVi6Q

I've been here 3x and so far tried most of the chef's special and never been disapointed. Service is excellent. The only negative with this place is the location as it is hiidden.

I'm glad we didn't because we were rewarded with a most delightful lunch. I had the salmon teriyaki bento box and my husband had the sashimi lunch. The salad was so fresh, the lettuce had the right amount of crunch. It got even better after that. The teriyaki had the right amount of sweetness.  The service by the owner, Ben, was impeccable.

Ben, the owner, was very kind and welcoming as he sent us a taster of their veggie tempura as we looked over the menu. Food was very visually appealing and tasted great.
Give this new spot a try, you won't be disappointed 
Great lunch specials at a good prices

3825994,2017-03-13,0,vfqUUh_5KF3R7mz2XiNXGg,"The location is kind of weird. It is tuck away in the back. It is right in between the cross fit place and the dry cleaners. When you walk inside, the atmosphere feels very relax. The music they play is very calming. The service is amazing. The waiter would always check up on us and make sure everything is ok. 

We order the squid for appetizers. It was big. It was a whole small squid. It was amazing. It was cooked perfectly and the sauce they had complimented the squid really well. It is a must try. We also got a salad and miso soup with our lunch special. The salad is fresh and crisps. The waiter also gave us vegetable tempura to try and it was perfectly fried. Not to oily but crispy. 

2 sushi roll lunch special: Sweet potato sushi and salmon avocado. The sweet potato is tempura and then made into a sushi. It is delicious and I can eat this everyday!  The salmon avocado was good. A good balance of salmon and avocado and it was fresh.

We also ordered the steak teriyaki lunch special and hibachi lunch special. Fried rice is $2 more but GET IT! It is worth it! They asked how we want teriyaki and hibachi steak was cooked. We wanted medium well and it was cooked perfectly. Their to go boxes are cute as well! 

We order to much food because we was full after the sushi and squid. But it was so worth it. Everything is fresh and delicious. Even though we ate a lot, I do not feel heavy which is nice because I can continue on with my day without a nap. The service is on point. They are all very sweet and amazing. We will definitely come back and bring the rest of the family. I highly recommend!",e7o1IGApDU8ZmFfGWOepbA,7,5,5,Gy9m8OLdLbUpDzPR6O118g

4808172,2017-04-11,0,vfqUUh_5KF3R7mz2XiNXGg,"I went here on a recommendation from a friend. The location? is hidden in the middle of a residential area so it is not on a main Street. You would think you were on your way to a friend's house instead of a great restaurant!

I went here with my daughter on Saturday for a late lunch/early dinner. My daughter ordered the miso soup, edamame and yellowtail sushi. I ordered the yellowtail scallion roll and sushi sampler. They gave us a small appetizer of thier vegetable fritter and a cucumber and crab salad/pickled dish. Everything was delicious and the service was great!

I know that posting a great review is a catch 22. The place was empty when my daughter and I ate there on Saturday. I want them to be successful and I know that with that means that they will get busy and I may have to wait awhile for the delicious food to get in my belly! 

Honestly though, I hope they do well as this really is a gem of a place. The chef and staff care about the food they produce and provide to thier customers.
