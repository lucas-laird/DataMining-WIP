For an appetizer, we shared #1 Goi cuon (spring rolls: rice sheet shrimp, pork & lettuce) for $3.50.  In the picture, it shows four spring rolls which I thought was a hearty amount.  (I was originally going to just order that for dinner.)  When it arrived, it was actually one spring roll cut in half with hoisin dipping sauce.  I thought this was definitely false advertising.  (What if we had a party of four and planned on sharing?)

For my main, I went for #9 Bun bo xao xa (Grilled lemongrass sliced beef over vermicelli and vegetables) for $7.25.  When it arrived, it looked like a hearty portion.  Then I moved the beef around noticed it really wasn't all that much.  It tasted more like a stir-fry than grilled beef.  However, the onions were cooked to perfection.

The BF wanted grilled sliced pork, but over rice.  The waitress suggested #8 Bun thit nuong, cha gio (Grilled sliced pork and fried egg rolls over vermicelli and vegetables) for $7.95, but replace the noodles with rice.  When his order arrived, it really didn't look like much.  It came with two fried egg roll halves and the grilled pork definitely didn't look like anything in the picture.  If anything, it looked like the leftover scrap meat you have when you're done grilling.  There was more rice on the plate than anything.  

Overall, we paid over $20 for our dinner, and that was not including beverages.  We left hungry.  It wasn't worth the price for what we got overall.  And I definitely didn't appreciate the misleading pictures on the menu.

2.5 stars

Sidenote: They also offer shabu shabu hot pot with beef, chicken, or seafood from 11:30 am to 9:30 pm.",rt3PC7WCgCKsoufmQJELfw,3,3,3,AHafdaxK5KV0ftwWkSWmNQ

Many Vietnamese restaurants that I frequented here, in Vegas and on the East Coast (where I am from) where far from fresh--they provided often stale traditional foods, while their Americanized fair was greasy and not very appetizing (pretty typical).  This Vietnamese place does not even offer Americanized dishes. It offers simple, Vietnamese cuisine. It tastes delicious in its simplicity and the variety is still good enough for a food enthusiast or a first timer.

The only slight draw back--the owners are also the servers, especially at lunch time. While they are very adept in the kitchen--yum--they do not speak much English and can't always understand the order. I had difficulty understanding them on a couple of occasions. I do not view this as a major drawback as I think this adds to the authenticity of the restaurant, but someone else may.

Overall, great restaurant. I am craving it right now!",wJWTjNLKFZIhq0OTXGQrsQ,0,0,5,3PP5VBKBL8Hx4y47EkalDA
