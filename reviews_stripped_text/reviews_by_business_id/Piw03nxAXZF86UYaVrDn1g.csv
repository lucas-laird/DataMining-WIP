I ordered an XL pepperoni and told by cashier, it'll be 15-20minutes.  After paying at the register I was reading a sign about signing up for the club and getting a free slice of pizza. But as I was reading it, the lady manager rudely tells me to go sit down, my pizza will be ready in 20 minutes. I walk to the other side to see if there is any more info about joining the club, but there was not. So I ask how do you join and the manager says rudely again, to go online. Then quickly turns her back to me. I leave and sit down. My order on the receipt said 1:20pm. At 1:40pm, I go back up to the counter and the manager gives me a look and says 7 more minutes. I say to her it has been 20 minutes. She says it has in disbelief. I then hold up the receipt and says the time stamp on the receipt says 1:20 and it is now 1:40. So that's 20 minutes. She then says 2 more minutes. I go sit back down and wait another 7 minutes. So it took 27 minutes to get my pizza. When I was called back up they handed me my pizza and didn't say anything. No apology for the wait or ANYTHING. Just give it to me and turn away from me. 
Soooooooooo........  one of the worst customer service experiences ever. The pizza did taste good, but there was a lot of bubbles that I'm guessing they decided not to pop while cooking.",CLgu509a9HRSj_NQHVCMGA,0,0,1,zCUKbJaNMvDIx3Sehg_4vQ

Some of the ladies working here are really nice but some don't seem to speak much English so there is a bit of a language barrier. The food was fresh and tasty though. Sometimes a slice of pizza from the food court is what's needed after a day of shopping.,ga_05brEylDLIabc3lZOgA,1,1,3,w3IUZvSjam4hfKzqcgJURw
