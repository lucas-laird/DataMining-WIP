90391,2013-06-07,0,zsQk990PubOHjr1YcLkQFw,"With a crisp, golden crust containing a fluffy white inside, the baguettes from Dakao are the perfect vessel for their banh mi.

Despite their slender appearances, the sandwiches have the right proportion of bread, pickled veggies, meat filling, and pate. My order is usually the #1 House Special (which has a few kinds of cold cuts) or the #6 BBQ Pork. I love how each ingredient is just so fresh that you can taste it in each bite.

Dakao doubles as a deli by selling spring rolls, fried sesame balls, and other Vietnamese foods. Among their drink and dessert offerings, you'll find that they have the traditional iced coffee and che. I have yet to try them, because I'm afraid that I'll butcher their names while ordering.

Upon walking in, you'll notice there's no place to sit and that it's primarily for take-out. If anything, you can drive down to Desert Breeze Park on a nice day to have a quick picnic. As a general rule of thumb, you're better off using cash at a small Asian establishment like this.

Buy five sandwiches, get one free? You could try the whole menu with that deal!",EHvPZx_EY_s4r_5K6fL6tg,3,2,5,NzxlpnSA7RNDuGcDJx60uA

708583,2011-02-19,4,zsQk990PubOHjr1YcLkQFw,"I must confess, I am a Vietnamese Sandwich expert.  I don't use the word ""expert"" lightly.  Unbeknown to me, my parents have trained me into being a Vietnamese Sandwich expert or a banh mi expert.  I know my banh mi.  In my household, this is like searching for the holy grail.  

When I was growing up in midwest, there's hardly any Vietnamese restaurants, much less, a banh mi store.  We used to drive 4 hours across the border into Toronto just for banh mi.  My parents would try every single banh mi shop in Toronto and when we find that perfect one...guess how many we would buy?  Not 5 or 10 but hundreds.  I kid you  not... Literally hundreds.  A good portion was for us but they were also for other family members and close friends.  The Vietnamese people in midwest are banh mi fanatics.   

My parents are still on the hunt for banh mi.  The several thousands that we've eaten are still not enough for their ferocious banh mi appetite.  Whenever we travel these days, they are always trying out banh mi shops... still hoping and keeping their eyes out for a good banh mi.  

So what does all this background have to do with Dakao sandwiches?  You would think I have found the holy grail by typing all that background info but no I just wanted you to know something about me.... :)

Dakao sandwiches or banh mi is pretty good for Las Vegas.  I've tried the ones at Hue Thai, SF supermarket and Thanh Phoung by UNLV.  Dakao tastes way better.  It really helps that their bread is so fresh.  I speak to the owners in Vietnamese and my filling on the dac biet or #1 is always freshly.  The pate and homemade cold cuts are not gamy and seasoned as they should be for cha (Viet ham).   Their pickled veggies can used a bit more seasoning.  I like it more sour but that's just a personal preference.  They don't compare to the banh mi shops in Little Saigon but it's pretty darn close and this place serves authentic banh mi.  

My favorite thing here is not the banh mi but the banh cuon.  Banh cuon are rice flour rolls with ground pork fillings.  I really like the texture of the rice flour of the banh cuon.  If one knows or have very attempted to make them, it's really hard to get the texture of the rice flour right.  They make it very nicely here.  In fact, it's better then my mom's banh cuon.  But don't tell her that.. it'll just be our secret.",MGRNCiPHnzBhcDULy8OSuQ,5,4,4,6ZiArVM7iaHbeXG_7WrVmg

Let's focus on the sandwich because the ambience leaves much to be desired, but with most businesses of this sort, it's par for the course.

I ordered my usual #1. Why? Because it's the same at EVERY Vietnamese joint. It's got butter, patè, and some cold cuts that most people probably wouldn't eat. Along with pickled vegetables, fresh jalapeños and cilantro. Sounds like every other banh mi, right? Well yeah...except the bread here is dope AF.

It has that crunchy, crumbly goodness on the outside and that soft luxurious interior. Ok the interior sounded like a car commercial. But I'm telling you...the BREAD here is what makes this stand out and I AM willing to come back over and over again.

I also tried the sticky rice and enjoyed it very much (being Thai, I am a huge stickler about sticky rice), though it was still a little sweet for me. Dakao was able to make 66 sandwiches I needed to pick up for a wedding and broke down the price for me pretty fairly. We only paid for 55, and got 11 free!

The only downside is the price. I live within driving distance from Westminster and Dakao doesn't come close to the prices I normally pay, but I guess that can be attributed to being in Vegas.",97Dj5h5CQUsWZrEWj3wWOg,0,1,4,HjL-eWBjcAFqWZ0Hu5YyVA

The first time I tried bahn-mi was over 15 years ago in Austin, TX.... And let me tell u.... DaKao rocks even compared to the bank mi I've had in Texas and Cali!!

The bread is always baked fresh and it is just perfectly crispy on the outside with that perfect amount chew on the inside. Such a great compliment to their mayo and pate. Honestly their pate is one of the best I've had ever... Some other places makes theirs a little sweet... Here it is savory and just melts in my mouth!!

I've tried quite a few of their sandwiches and I gotta say it's a toss up between the pork roll and the fried egg with Chinese sausage for me.  But no matter what I get its always been amazing!! :) also they have some specialty items there for sale as well. Rice noodles dishes... Spring rolls with shrimp and pork or sometimes they have it with Vietnamese sausage... I don't know what any of them are called cuz well.... Their English is lacking.... But they do know numbers which is how I normally order. Lol  siopao.... Steamed bun with pork inside with a half a hard boiled egg... Delicious.  Their specialty items change day by day and once they run out they run out so get there early. :). (5/5)

English is a hit or miss. If u are expecting to talk to someone about the different options this might not be the place as normally the ppl working there don't speak English all that great... But normally they serve you with a smile and they are very friendly and the lady that works there remembers me even if I don't come in for months... (5/5)

This is a strictly to go place.  They do have 2 tables... But they were added in the last couple of years.... And the feel of this place is still a to go.  So my recommendation is do what I do... Call ahead.... And pick up your order and go home and eat in the comfort of your home. :). 

The flavor here beats Lee's hands down in my book.... I just wished it was closer. But every chance I get... I will be back!! My favorite spot for bahn mi!!!",L3DxG0n3lRq5N2lv1QNrrA,2,5,5,HjZa2OcaoL80l5jVjEps5A

1971270,2015-10-14,0,zsQk990PubOHjr1YcLkQFw,"My husband called their banh mi dac biet or combination special the best he ever had. Stay tuned for his review. As for me, I can speak to their vegetarian banh mi. And yes, it is also one of the best I've ever had. The long, thin, French style baguette is crisp and fragrant one the outside and stuffed with generous heapings of a salty slaw type concoction. It looks like shredded tofu and something crunchy akin to perhaps bamboo? I wasn't sure, but this mixture was scrumptious. Unlike the horrific, sweet imitation pig skin filling I had in Atlanta, this meatless protein was perfectly salty, not cloyingly sweet, and very umami.

I also loved that the Dakao folks used a lighter hand with the butter. It's definitely there, but it's not so overpoweringly rich as with other banh mi joints. 

Their sandwiches are quite affordable at around $3.50 each. Service is okay to friendly, depending on who's there to greet you. (We visited twice, and there was one smaller, younger, moustached guy, who mostly worked in the back and was really nice. The other staff were okay.)

Starting with the basics, the bread here is like a rock. Way too hard and no fluff inside. The veggies don't seem incredibly fresh, especially the pickled carrots and radish. They skimp out on the meat. There really should be a lot more in each sandwich. Also, these sandwiches really should come out at least lukewarm, not cold.

Being a native of LA, I've had a full range of banh mi in my time ranging from the best to the worst. This is definitely below average in that spectrum.",RXCoHt7BBFQN_vjsb8IDjg,3,0,2,3NoJNkW2BzEVNo8mu-skYA

My hubby does not like Vietnamese food in general... with the exception of Dakao sandwiches.

I have always thought that banh mi was a really fusion dish from the get go -  French bread with Vietnamese styled fillings like pickled daikon/carrot, pate,  marinated grilled meats and assorted cold cuts. At Dakao's, it is truly the best representation of both worlds. 

For me, the bread has to be legit French baguette which means crunchy and light on the outside, soft on the inside. Dakao's bread fits this description. If you are looking for a soft bread,  this is not the place for you and you will be sorely disappointed.

I love the house special which is the classic cold cuts and pate. The hubs' usual is the grilled pork sandwich which has a nice smoky flavor. I have also tried their grilled pork meatball which is also quite delicious. For a sandwich of this caliber to be less than $4, it is one of my favorite cheap eats in the city. 

The only thing about the sandwiches are they need to be eaten ASAP given the delicate bread in combination with moist fillings. So we usually pick these en route back home from a Spring Mountain expedition for groceries. 

I also purchase their siobao which are the steamed pork buns with the boiled eggs inside. My only complaint about these are the steamed bun park could be a little less dense. Otherwise they are a nice quick affordable meal for $2 each. 

The spring rolls are alright -  there is a little too much rice vermicelli and not enough vegetables for my taste. 

If it was just sandwiches, this place would be an easy 4.5 starred joint. But their other stuff is just okay for me so it rounds it down to a 4 starred review.",h9RUaaHa5kcQKqtJ-sgS0Q,2,1,4,US9bQroHUSx7Iq-wh0I2Uw
2176565,2012-01-12,0,zsQk990PubOHjr1YcLkQFw,"Few of my med school friends and I came here for a little breakfast and coffee before our afternoon genitals and breast lab. Since there were 5 of us, we were able to get 1 bahn mi free! We tried the 2 chicken, 2 house special, and 2 grilled pork. (Of course, I got 2 sandwiches!) All three were meats were delicious, but the house special stood out the most for me. I have been always hesitant to get the house special because sometimes the ""bologna"" taste can rub me the wrong way sometime and kick in a gag reflex. But here, I liked how the different meats were in good condition, thinly sliced and were in harmony with the other ingredients. I think the quality bahn mi bread is the best in LV. It was crunchy and soft and didn't scrape of the epithelial cells lining my hard palate.

I also bought one of the deli items. It was chinese sausage and egg stuffed with vegetables and wrapped with rice paper. What a great breakfast! It was light, full of flavor, and had protein. I hope I can find out the real name of this dish but I posted a photo just in case you are interested~ Also, I got an iced coffee and it was very standard (sweetened, creamy). 

This place isn't like Lee's where you sit down to eat your sandwich. There's one table outside and one inside and they're not fancy or clean. The atmosphere in summary: Type of joint where older immigrant Vietnamese men come to grab some coffee and read their papers.

Lastly, the cashier (owner?) was friendly and helpful in answering any questions we had (i.e. What's in there?). Furthermore he was a jokester! When I asked him to slice the rolls in half, he told me it'd cost $1 per roll to slice them in half! It made me laugh because he couldn't keep a straight face (I like him!).

It's not super-convenient for me to get to from home or work, so I rarely make the journey over there.  After having a sandwich at Dakao, that might change.  DC and I stopped here on our way home from a recent trip, and boy was it fantastic.

I had the grilled pork banh mi and DC had chicken.  For starters, the sandwich is about 2-feet long.  It's a lot of food for about $4.  The bread is crunchy and chewy and light.  I could eat the bread alone, but that would be nonsense when I tell you about the rest of the sandwich.

This had your typical banh mi filling of meat, cilantro, jalepenos, and pickled vegetables.  Compared to other places I have been to, the pickled veg was sweet and added a nice balance to the sandwich.  The meat was warm and tender.  My only gripe was that the peppers were sliced into 'chips' and were not present in every bite.  This made some bites searingly hot and others void of all spice.

After finishing my sandwich I immediately wanted to get a second.  I knew that would be a bad idea, but I really had to fight it.  Even now, more than 24-hours later I find myself thinking about that tender grilled pork and tangy-sweet vegetable combo.

One thing to note - you should probably get your order to go.  There is only one small table in the place and it could hardly be considered a 'dining room' of any sort.",IlRmSTn19xM2Vi7xtjzAhw,0,0,4,kcvPfUQ4l4oBNCO_FxK4iQ

The gentleman said that he will process the transaction with 1 sandwich for $3. So, I jumped in my bat mobile and off to Dakao I go!!

Once I arrived it was all wrapped and ready to go. I did a squeeze test and it felt a little hard. With an open mind, I proceeded back to the office with my Dakao Veggie sandwich. 

A las! Back in the office and a bite I go! Indeed and which I was afraid of...bread was hard and crispy, I prefer my bread Fresh as in a hint of crisp on the outside, soft and warm in the inside! 

Although I was disappointed with the not so fresh bread and they didn't have any hoisin or siracha sauce, the inside of the sandwich tasted yummy and fresh. Tofu was sauteed with veggie soy sauce, Cilantro, carrots, daikon and cucumber was organically fresh and crispy.

2389063,2011-11-04,0,zsQk990PubOHjr1YcLkQFw,"Love this place.  I live in the Bay Area but was visiting my sister and she brought us here. Owned and run by a husband and wife team. Ah, reminded me so much of the little Vietnamese sandwich shop my parents owned when we were growing up.  Very low key, informal, family-oriented.  When we came back the next day, the husband was playing chinese chess on a little table outside--just like something my dad would do.

First, I have to say that there is no Vietnamese sandwich in Vegas that lives up to its counterpart in the Bay Area.  My sister told me that straight out.  But Dakao (which my mother said is named after a very lovely neighborhood in Vietnam, which she actually lived in) is the closest thing. If you never had a Bay Area Vietnamese sandwich and died only having had Dakao sandiwches, you'd be well enough off.  (Now, if you died only having had Vietnamese sandwiches from the Lee's down the street, then you'd be an object of pity, but that's another review.)

We went wild during our 2 visits in 2 days here.  We had their basic banh mi (yum) and their grilled pork sandwich (also yum).  They actually had pate so, a savory pastry located in their self-serve counter with a delicious buttery flaky crust filled with ground pork, mushrooms, and some other goodies.  My parents used to sell pate so at their restaurant when I was little but it's now very difficult to find so I was thrilled that Dakao had it--and made EXACTLY the way I had it growing up.  I bought 3, thinking I would bring 1 back to the Bay Area for my boyfriend but while it did make it back, I ended up eating it myself.

They also had this slimy dark green jello-like substance in clear plastic cups behind the counter.  My sister & I had no idea what this was and would have never ordered it but my mother was ecstatic when she saw it. I don't know the name but it's made from a fruit that naturally bears that jello-ey substance.  My mother said that HER mother used to eat it every single day in Vietnam but she (my mother) has never once seen it offered anywhere in all the years she's been living in the US (over 30 years).  We tried it and OMG, it was SOOO refreshing.  A little sugar is sprinkled on top to give it a slightly sweet flavor (make sure you mix it a bit so the sugar gets mixed in).  Very light and perfect for the hot Vegas days.  My sister said she was going to order it often in the future and I'm actually quite jealous that I can't find it anywhere in the Bay Area.

My sister also regularly orders their banh cuon, a paper thin rice noodle pocket with a little ground pork.  I would've ordered that had we not already ordered a billion other things.  It's a tiny place but they have so many freshly made goodies, it's like a candy store to me.

Like I said, I don't live in Vegas but whenever I visit my sister, I'm going to make sure she brings me back here.  The price, the food, the vibe, the owners, you can't go wrong.",q-2OL8n6bvGi_CHFJOXGDA,1,1,5,kyNxgTdbasDUFQ30Yq-fBg

2778504,2010-09-26,1,zsQk990PubOHjr1YcLkQFw,"With all of the banh mi reviews recently on Yelp (Misti Y. seems to write one every other day) I was craving some sandwiches. Now, I don't know anything about banh mi  and my trip to Dakao was my first time trying one. As others have mentioned, Dakao is tiny. There's only one tiny, metal patio table that seats two in their shop. So plan on eating elsewhere. 

I decided to try the grilled chicken and BBQ pork. I didn't like the chicken. The quality of the meat wasn't the best and it lacked flavor. The BBQ pork, on the other hand, was a winner. The flavor was good and the amount of pork that filled the baguette made this $3 sandwich a bargain. With the carrots, daikon, cilantro and cucumbers it was a delicious sandwich with a little bit of a kick from the jalapeños. The outside of the bread was crispy, but the inside wasn't as soft and chewy as I had hoped (old bread perhaps?). Bread is the key to making any good sandwich great, so I can't give this experience any more than 3 stars.

There was a sign that said ""cash only"" but when I asked the girl at the register she said they accept credit cards for purchases over $8.",C2C0GPKvzWWnP57Os9eQ0w,4,3,3,CmESaIIsSRrvXDnvuHOVeg

2837530,2011-10-23,3,zsQk990PubOHjr1YcLkQFw,"Don't be scared by the curiously unfortunate-sounding name, since I typically don't like to evoke images of German concentration camps when I bite into one of these heavenly Vietnamese sandwiches (banh mi).   This place came highly recommended to me by a Vietnamese colleague so when I had two friends from out of town needing a quick bite before hitting the road, I took them to this inconspicuous hole in the wall and we were greeted by a pleasant guy behind the counter who recommended that we get the grilled pork, the meat ball, and the beef banh mi (was intrigued by the sardine and fried egg/chinese sausage offerings).  
I appreciated the fact that there were some tasty Asian beverages in the fridge including Thai iced tea, chrysanthemum tea, and sweetened soy milk.  There was also the option of a refreshing glass of vietnamese coffee with sweetened condense milk if you need the caffeinated pick me up.  

The first thing you need to know is that they bake their own French baguettes every 45 minutes so you are getting a warm crusty chewy roll that encases your choice of meat with pickled veggies of daikon and carrot, meat pate, and garnished with cilantro and jalapeno.  The owner happily honored our request to cut the sandwiches in thirds so that we could sample all three.  

The grilled pork is irresistably crispy with a sweet glazed exterior, the beef is butter-knife tender like a well-cooked filet, and the meatball is broken down like a spread engulfed in a sauce that can only be described as the lovechild of a sweet and sour sauce and a marinara.  All three sandwiches share everything one could hope for in a sandwich: contrasts in texture (chewy bread vs. creamy pate vs. tender meat vs. crunchy veggies), temperatures (warm bread vs. hot meat vs. cold veggies), and flavors (saltiness, tartness, sweetness, and SPICINESS...respect those jalapenos!).  I would give this 5 stars if there was slightly more meat to balance out the bread but I'm sure this could potentially be negotiated upon ordering.    At a price of a mere 3 dollars, a 5 dollar footlong at Subway would actually be considered a scam both in price and quality of product.  My two compadres were so pleased that they both bought an extra sandwich for the road (at 3 dollars, how could one resist?).  

Definitely worth checking out if you have a hankering for banh mi or need a change of pace from your typical sandwich offerings in Vegas.",syA7uYoDjohc7gWBWaEZmw,3,3,4,wp6x0bugCKbVIZpq80GpmQ

I was kind of apprehensive about walking in, but the staff (this one lady) was nice, and took our order with a smile, if with just a few words.  The sandwiches were made in about 3 minutes (3 sandwiches all together), and we decided to order some of these sesame balls, as well.  We paid for two, and the lady, again very nice, decided to give us 3.

The sandwiches were long, but thin.  About as wide-around as Hue Thai's but 1.5 times as long.  The bread was fresh, with the perfect combination of crunchy on the outside and soft and fluffy on the side, and the filling of each was good and filled the bread up very well.  The vegetables were good, too.  

On the whole, the sandwiches were better than Hue Thai (cheaper, more for the money, and about as flavorful), but still not as good as Pho Thanh Huong...  I've still not tried a better banh mi (except maybe the $8 one at Pho at TI, but I might have been drunk, or might have been making it seem better because it cost that much more).  Since it's far out of my normal operating area, I think I'll stick to Pho Thanh Huong, unless I happen to be forced to be in Chinatown.  

Extra star for good, friendly, if taciturn, service.

The ""dac biet"" sandwich, which means ""special,"" doesn't live up to it's name. The sandwich only comes with a thin slice of head cheese, pork loaf, and ham, contrary to the photo on their menu board, which is shown bursting with meat. The pickled carrots and daikon radish mix is limp and lacks textured crunch because the vegetables are shredded so thin. The ""dac biet"" sandwich comes with pâté, but almost goes unnoticeable because it's spread thin only in the center of the bread, and you don't get a taste of if in most bites. Bánh mì sandwiches tend to come with mayonnaise spread, which the sandwiches here exclude altogether.

Even though Dakao offers a free sandwich for every five that you buy, that's not considered a perk for their skimpy  sandwiches. Maybe they skimped on our six sandwiches because they knew we were from out of town and wouldn't likely come back anyway. Well, Dakao, you're right...

The bread/baguette is fresh and the fillings are delicious, with just the right mix of meat, veggies and cilantro.

I ordered 12 sandwiches (2 were free) to take back to California with me (no foie gras in Cali), and like other reviewers stated, the sandwiches are thinner than typical viet subs. The meats inside were absolutely delicious, but the veggies, which we got separately because that's how we order when we do a bulk order, were lacking in quantity. 
We have about 5 sandwiches left in the freezer, and we're out of veggies! I guess we should have planned it out better, but most places give more veggies than Dakao. 

The bread is top-notch though. Perhaps next time, I'll split up my order into two 6 sandwich orders and hope to get more veggies. Or, I'll ask them for more veggies.

Unlike a lot of other Asian places that deal in cash money, Dakao charges sales tax, so I opted to pay via credit card... I had the cash handy if they were going to give me a cash price without tax, but no worries!

I went a little overboard, I got two sandwiches, the grilled chicken and the pork roll, the banh cuon, and the tofu chinese sausage summer rolls.  Well after that first bite of the banh cuon, I am a fan!  

Let start with the sandwich, the bread is exactly what french bread should be!  Crunchy and crispy on the outside and soft and fluffy on the inside!  Each bite is a crisp bite filled with the sweet and sourness of the pickled daikon and carrots.  NOM NOM!  As for the chicken, it's not the usual chicken I'm use to in my Banh mi (chicken thigh), instead they use chicken breast, which is not my cup of tea, but to others this may.  The pork roll was pretty delicious!  They put a spread of pate on the bread topped with thinly sliced pork rolls.  

The bahn cuon is just how I remember it to be when I had it in Hawaii!  It was so good!  Very peppery and tasteful!  Soft skin with a kick from the filling.  Top it with some fish sauce and sirrhacha, it is oh so delicious! 

Summer roll you say?  What is that?  Well to the people on the mainland, a summer roll is what you guys refer to as a spring roll.  It is the fresh roll that is non fried and stuffed with rice noodles, lettuce, thai basil, pork and shrimp!  Well instead of the original one I always get, I went for the unique one that was filled with tofu, carrots, daikon, dried shrimp, and Chinese sausage and boy was that good!  Great decision made!  

I cannot wait to go back to this place and try more things!  Oh and their ice coffee is also really good!  Only $2 for a medium sized coffee!!  I think it's cheaper than the one at Lee's!  Taste just the same!  If not stronger! ;-)",n_UcypOj7YW8gdR43XIUSQ,0,1,4,E6FIadoqOEbuLNUAOhuNgQ

4014319,2013-03-07,3,zsQk990PubOHjr1YcLkQFw,"Honestly, I've had better priced and better tasting bahn mi in the Cali area but for me, Dakao has some of the much better bahn mi in good ol' LV!  I had a hankering for some Viet food one day and we somehow ended up seeing this place from the corner of our (Asian) eyes.  Tucked into a corner right next to a hair salon, there was a small line at the counter.  I look to my left, a drink cooler, I look to my right, a food cooler, I look up...a menu of Vietnamese sandwiches!  I figure why not give it a shot.  

Dakao is a very small place that is meant for take-out or pick-up so don't plan on eating here.  They do have one tiny table with two plastic chairs, but I think those are more for decoration than anything.  So order, wait, take your bahn mi outside or eat at home.  Or do like me and take your bahn mi to the 168 Market right down the street and eat it at the food court there while people are watching you with awe while constantly getting asked, ""Where you get that?  Where you get that?""  Where indeed.

There are 12 bahn mi sandwiches on the menu at Dakao.  They each range from $3-4.  Yes, expensive for bahn mi standards for Cali folks...but not bad for us desert dwellers here in LV.  Don't forget, you buy 5 bahn mi, you get 1 free!  I for some reason have never bought only one or two when I go to Dakao.  I always get the 5 with the 1 free because usually there will be someone in my family that will say, ""Hey...where's mine?""  It never fails.  Who knew you had to feed kids constantly?

I haven't tried all 12 bahn mi yet at Dakao but give me some time, I'll get there.  I stick with the #1 (House Special), #3 (Marinated Pork Ball), #6 (Grilled Pork), #7 (Shredded Pork & Skin), #8 (Grilled Chicken), and #11 (Meatball).  The #1 seems to be the fav of the family.  If you see 'House Special' on a bahn mi menu, expect to see head cheese, pate, and pork loaf on your sandwich.  Andrew Zimmern haters be warned!  There be some Bizarre Foods in the #1 bahn mi at Dakao.  But damn...it's good!

The bread at Dakao is what does it for me.  It's a skinnier bahn mi, but the bread is not too hard on the outside, and not too chewy on the inside.  It's just right.  Pretty good French roll.  I just wish they added more fillings to their sandwiches!  They can be a bit on the paltry side with the meat and the veggies.  I love those pickled veggies!  I always have to ask for extra veggies on the side for my bahn mi, thankfully they've never charged me extra for it.  I also like some hoisin sauce on my bahn mi, luckily we often times take our sandwiches home.  

There's also a lot of Vietnamese deli items including various pastries, buns, rolls, and desserts but I always forget about them since all I do is focus on that BIG @$$ bahn mi menu every time I walk in there.  My order is easy, all I do is go, ""3 #1, 1 #6, 1 #7, 1 #8, to go, extra veggies on the side please"" and I'm done.  So easy, even an old Asian lady can do it!

Dakao takes credit/debit cards but they prefer cash instead.  Service, even if minimal, is always quick and friendly for me.  Hit up Dakao Sandwiches if you want a big bahn mi for a mini-mi price!",QCtHk02W_Asu2LFfdmGQDA,4,2,4,6lB-ZCErZBzxERc1I9D1dQ

Anyone who has stayed in a hotel room with me at Vegas will often find crushed chips on my bed, nacho cheese sauce smeared on the side of the sheets, not to mention overturned take-out boxes scattered around all over the room. 

After a Room Service FAIL back in July 2010 at the Palazzo, my friend and I decided we would no longer order room service, no matter how drunk and starving we were.

In December 2010, after getting Chinese foot massages, we decided to pick up some banh mi for some drunken eats later that night. I realize this review is over 2 months late, but I'm at home sick (my punishment for the sins I committed last week at Vegas) so I've decided to catch up on some of my Yelp reviews. As far as details go, I normally take notes on my BB so information integrity is not compromised by my alcohol-induced memory loss. 

DAKAO SANDWICHES is located in an Asian Shopping Plaza on Spring Mountain Road in Chinatown (8 min cab ride from the Strip). They offer 10 banh mi varities for $3 each. They also have various Banh Bao (steamed chicken and pork buns), Banh Cuon (steamed rolled noodles), Xio (sticky rice) and Cha Lua (steamed pork sausage) and Mon Trang Mieng (desserts) and a variety of juices and sodas.

I ordered the Combo Banh Mi which was served in a flat French baguette. 

CC's accepted with a $8 minimum.

THE MORNING AFTER...

I woke up to breadcrumbs on the pillowcase and trailed along the floor which was no surprise, but as I walked to the front drawer, laid the real SHOCKER... I found chunks of the baguette scattered all over the floor and underneath the drawer. Apparently, when I stumbled back into the hotel at 5 AM (according to my friend), I had broken off pieces of the baguette because the banh mi fixings were scant and the bread was dry. 

My more sober friend had the same assessment, she said the banh mi was really bready and dry, there was just 3 slices of meat (ham, headcheese, and bologna) , there was very little mayo and the scant amounts of pickled daikon and carrots just got lost in the bread.

I ate the Thit Nuong on the night of purchase, and I saved the Dac Biet for later. The latter held up nicely after a quick toast in the oven, which is a pretty standard result.

I won't really go into too much detail on the sandwiches. The components taste nice and seem fresh, but I don't think there's enough meat, pickled veggies, cilantro, or even jalapeno. In other words, it's kinda like Subway but with fewer veggies. The overall result, unfortunately, is that the sandwiches are not very filling, and they leave you with bread as the main after-flavor.

Maybe I'll check out some of the pate chaud or banh bao on the counters if I'm ever in the area again. Otherwise, I'm going to wait for something good from California (and no, Lee's Sandwiches does not count).",_VMGbmIeK71rQGwOBWt_Kg,3,3,3,Iz9djE_VoSgzOLB3PeCTKA

When we got there, the inside of the sandwich shop was very plain and didn't have any furniture or anything yet. But this was understandable since they had just opened up and are new.  However, they had a simple menu consisting of 8 different types of Banh Mi (vietnamese sandwiches).  I had the roasted chicken sandwich (my favorite and usual), which was very good. The chicken and ingredients in the sandwich were very fresh and tasty. Also, the sandwich was warm when I got it, so I knew that they had made the entire thing to order.

very good vietnamese sandwich

+ cons:
very small location. no space to sit down. pretty much a takeout only.

By the way, be sure to eat it within a short time of buying to enjoy the crunch of the bread or else you must toast it for optimal flavor.",6tbXpUIU6upoeqWNDo9k_A,7,6,4,F42Wg7r3qrw1m5IdZ2Qy0A

I tried their house combination and grilled chicken. They use baguette bread instead of the other kind of bread I was used to. To be honest, my review is solely based on my experiences from my home town. The baguette bread was too crispy and they were pretty skimpy on their filling. The flavor wasn't too great on the house special. I love the house special (#12 and huong lan in sac). I was hoping to get that same taste. But the meat and pate just didnt taste right.

I consider Dakao my favorite banh mi go to, but it isn't without its blemishes. I always get the vegetarian tofu option, but I should qualify this by letting you know that 2 times out of 5 they are out of this option! Not cool. When they do have it, it is the real deal because they have a special, flavorful tofu filling. I am not exactly sure what's in there, but it tastes like super savory onions and soy sauce and... good things. 

The store is super small, and we never want to sit down and eat the sandwich there. It just feels a little odd, so we end up eating in our car, and then our car smells like the wonderful, but odorous veggie filling. I am not really a fan of my car smelling like food. (We're the type of people that put doggie bags in the trunk.)

Plus, we've never been successful in using our credit card, but based on the other reviews, it can be done. Either way, I hate having to beg to use plastic.

5217660,2017-03-10,0,zsQk990PubOHjr1YcLkQFw,"I recently stopped by the Bahn Mi (Vietnamese poboy) shop by my work for lunch again and decided it was time to pen a review on this place.

When I walked in, all the other customers were speaking Vietnamese, which is par for the course at this place. I ordered two poboys so that I can take one home for supper: the #1 House Special and the #6 Marinated Pork. I rarely mention exact prices in a review, but the House Special, pictured on top, was $3.40 and the Marinated Pork was ten cents more. The most expensive poboy at this shop is $4.00, and if you buy five of them, you get one free. The shop is primarily for carry out, but they do have a couple tables where you can eat. This option may appeal to you if you're really hungry, or if you're an artistic type that likes to hang out at dives and order a black coffees at a gas stations.

The House Special (#1) is delicious. Its protein is three types of thinly sliced Vietnamese deli meats which I am wholly unqualified to identify. The Marinated Pork (#6) was equally delicious and is my recommendation for those with a less adventurous pallet.

Both poboys were dressed with a slight amount of mayonnaise, fresh jalapenos, julienned carrots, cucumber, and what I believe to be shredded sweetly pickled radish. None of those things individually sound particularly appealing to me, but the combination is in fact on point. They come with cilantro as well, but because my genes make cilantro taste like dish soap, I had them hold that. My poboys were just spicy enough to contribute harmoniously to the flavor complexity of the poboys without burning my mouth in the least. That being said, the shop uses fresh jalapenos, which, by their nature have a lot of variance, so don't blame me if your poboy turns out spicier than a drunk drag queen at a quinceniera. I've had that happen too in past. The best part of the poboys is the thin baguettes they come on, which I believe are baked on site. In any case, plenty of people come here just to buy their baguettes.
I have also tried their sardine poboy and their pork roll (sausage) poboy, both of which I also recommend. The shop sells various Vietnamese baked goods and desserts, and their cold bento box is particularly popular with the Vietnamese clientele. I tried it once, but my Western pallet just wasn't suited for many of those novel flavors. The Thai coconut juice is something I wouldn't get again, but the shop has a decent selection of Asian cold drinks to choose from.

Dakao Sandwiches is a gem, if not a hidden gem, right in the middle of Chinatown, and it is definitely worth the trip.",O0JPkrL9cBxx2u1Ka9iAXA,0,0,5,ss9FWtPH_eraHcAurgOHKA

The bread for the banh mi was really good - crispy but soft. The sandwich overall tasted fresh and well-balanced, not too salty. You do get more bang for your buck at Lee's (more meat), but I preferred the more authentic flavors and better balance of meat / veggies / bread here. 

The banh cuon seemed fresh when I bought it, but since I bought it to go and ate it for dinner later that day after putting it in the refrigerator and reheating it, I couldn't really tell you. It wasn't bad by the time I got to it. 

Just a heads up, there isn't really anywhere to sit and eat. We ended up going to Greenland market down the street and sitting in their foodcourt to chow down. 

It seemed like a lot of people called in their orders and just came in to pick up their food - seemed like regulars, too. The man working the cash register wasn't rude, but he was pretty unfriendly (not surprising, I'm used to that), but it just wasn't 4-star service. In this day and age of yelp, service is paramount and the food wasn't SO good as to be able to stand on its own. 

Next time I'm in Chinatown, I'm definitely going to stop by here to stock up on this taste of home.",GQ_2kpEee1KXZCKEtpeEfw,4,1,3,2fCrULbn758Tz1Hj5g-pHg
