I'm sorry to Lino's, I've cheated on you with a cheap whore. 

The staff was friendly and helpful, but the pizza was God-awful.
Bland as shit sauce, garbage cheese, about half a bag of flour on the underside of the crust.
C'mon fellas, if you're going to claim NY, at least give half a damn about your pizza.

Used to be Mark Rich's, now it's Giani's, nothing has changed. Sad really.

With Lino's and Novecento within 2 miles of this place, you can do better.
Next time I want a quick slice, I'll probably just go to the Sam's Club on the other side of the parking lot. Seriously.

I don't like writing bad reviews of businesses with such nice staff.

At Mark Rich's, the pizza itself is gross. The dough tasted like Pillsbury brand and I wonder if they actually make their own dough.  It has no flavor.

This was my second time eating at this location. I got a groupon online and decided to give it another try even though I wasn't thrilled the first time.  They forgot to put pepperoni on our pizza.  When I alerted the waitress to the forgotten pepperoni, she immediately ran in the back without saying anything. She came back out and said ""you're right"". I definitely felt like she should have just apologized right away, not gone in back to check that I had in fact ordered pepperoni. Then, the bill came. Pepperoni was still charged!  I didn't even say anything because we had been sitting there for over an hour and I just wanted to leave.

629466,2011-07-05,3,kUntNQ5P9IrRzEoHdRxV-w,"You know, this place is really pissing me off.  Because my brother insists on getting pizza from this place for some unknown reason when he's been drinking, I've had to deal with them a few more times, and they have really just made me dislike them even more.  

Incident one:  My brother placed an order for delivery around 8:30pm for a pizza.  Around 9:45pm, they still had not come, so I called them to see why.  The guy said that they were closing, and I said that we had called in a delivery earlier, and his response was, ""I didn't know we had a delivery"", even though I was right there when my bro was ordering.  To add insult to injury after the dude playing dumb, he didn't even apologize.  Yeah.  Nice customer service, ass.  We never got the pizza, needless to say, and I was pretty peeved.

Incident two:  A few weeks later, I was out running some errands and the bro wanted me to pick up some pizza, since I told him I am done with their crappy delivery times.  I went in, and it was kind of busy, so I understood that I had to wait a bit (even though we had called well ahead of time... and were only ordering one medium pizza).  What really pissed me off, though, was that my pizza was actually ready, but had been sitting there pretty much the whole time because the dimwitted cashier didn't bother to look on top of the pizza oven and discover that my pizza was done.  So I sat there for approximately 20 minutes for nothing.

In sum:  I hate this place with the fire of a thousand suns.  :)",XEiocbijRm1YLbZJwvAlQw,1,0,1,dGPnJs9h15S68vYHzbjRcw

TERRIBLE service. Wow. Came in Saturday with a couple of girlfriends, and our server was absolutely terrible. She took forever to bring us our menus, even longer to get our drinks out. It's not like she was even busy she was just screwing around on her phone at the end of the bar. We finally get her to come to the table and she was abrupt and short with us when answering some of the questions we had about the menu. When the food finally did come she practically slammed the plates down. My girlfriend didn't have silverware and again, we had to flag her down for ten mintues so we could enjoy the meal. Didn't get refills once, she didn't come by to ask how everything was. We weren't even half way through the meal when she dropped off the check, we still had a to go order to place and were thinking about dessert. We were long finished before she came back again and was really rude with us when we told her we needed to place two chicken parm dinners to go and she snachtched up the checkbook so fast.

At first i thought it had a good feel for a pizza place but as i waited for the food to come i noticed that the whole entire place was a hodge-podge of old pics to make me feel as if i were in some old italian eatery....but i wasn't.

I was in a strip mall in suburban Las Vegas.

I was in strip mall getting ""decent"" pizza, an ""ok"" stromboli with a sauce that kinda tasted outa the can, wings that were fried to death and a weak salad.

All of this was fine to me...because you know what they say about pizza...even bad pizza is still good.

UNTIL THE BILL CAME. overpriced for the quality

I guess because this pizza place is in the land of chain restaurant hell means they can fool the average suburbanite into thinking that paying top dollar at a mom and pop place for ""italian food"" is ok.

975004,2013-04-09,0,kUntNQ5P9IrRzEoHdRxV-w,"SO I have been visiting Mark Rich's for years regularly for their good ol lunch specials.  Where else can you take three people for lunch and the bill comes out to $15.00???  What???  I must say I know how good this place can be and its been a while since I have seen it.  The place always used to be rockin and now you go in and theres hardly anyone there.  Like I said we come for lunch....rarely for dinner so it may just be a lunch thing?  The last time I visited we were the only ones there.  

The service is always pretty good so no real complaints there.  We always order the garlic knots.  Love them.  Love love love.  We usually ask them to do ""light"" on the oil but this time we forgot. Dangit.  It was swimming in oil....and by swimming I mean the poor knots were crying for help.  We ate it anyway as we dabbed as much oil as we could.  For lunch we ordered the pasta lunch.  We always order the penne pasta with pink sauce.  Its not really on the lunch menu but they modify their spaghetti for an additional charge for the pink sauce.  The last couple times the pasta just has zero flavor.  This last time the noodles were mushy, the sauce had no flavor and the garlic bread was burnt.  Well actually I had a burnt piece and a good piece and same for the BF.

This place is just tired.  It needs a new lift or something.  I am so sad to say all this because I have always been a big fan of their pizza and pasta.  Occasionally you would see Mark in there greeting the customers and I havent seen him in years.  Maybe its the new location.  Who knows.  We do always make fun of all the celebrity pictures autographed by someone with the same pen and same writing.  Pretty amusing I must say.  Anyways, I think we will give this place a rest for now and maybe visit for dinner to change it up.  I havent given up on you yet Mark.",4Ch_27GkNV5p7I7ewlX3DQ,2,1,2,8Wy4IjTfemFoMxmYlAJEEw

We were not even a little disappointed!  i ordered the meat and cheese lasagna and my spouse had a chicken calzone.  Both dishes were excellent.  The sauce on my lasagna was EXCELLENT... one of the best I have ever eaten.  I have to assume the calzone was just as good because I wasn't even offered a single taste!  I was told the crust was light and flakey and it tasted delicious.  Our server was training a new employee so we got plenty of attention.  A+ on service.  The only thing I can suggest they improve is the salad and dressing.  The salad was nothing more than a bowl of iceberg lettuce, two thin slices of tomato and a few Bermuda onion rings.  Visually it missed the mark.  The addition of some color to the bowl in the form of a few shreds of red cabbage, maybe a little shredded carrot , an olive or two, and a few croutons would be a big help.  The Italian dressing I ordered was also a disappointment; much too oily and lacking flavor.  The salad is the only reason I did not give this place five stars.

Superior ingredients creating superior taste what a crazy concept, I know it sounds nuts but trust me it works.  Every time I go I get a large pie with pepperoni, sausage, mushroom and ricotta cheese. The flavors are off the hook and they aren't stingee with the toppings.  The ricotta is creamy and flavorful.  My only complaint is that the crust doesn't get as well done as I like it.  Dudes all you got to do is take the pizza off the sheet and lay it directly in the oven for the last 2 to 3 minutes of cooking.  This will give that nice char on the bottom and will prevent your slice from laying there like a flaccid dong the moment you try to pick it up.  I can't speak for the rest of their food, considering I've only tried the pizza. I'm not saying it's the best pie in the valley, however if you live in the northwest and looking for a quick slice this is the place to go.",AoII0-uM9z0EesGnb9YCjQ,3,2,4,kVdABJtNvZgq6G1wCoY6Bw

The Sausage Pizza Slice came out first.....it was loaded with Sausage....too much in my opinion (see pics).  I also thought the Cheese to Sauce ratio was off.....not enough sauce, the Pizza tasted dry.  The Crust was good and cooked well.....if I was rating just on the Pizza, this place would get 2 or 3 Stars.

The NY Hot Dog on the other hand was Fantastic!  The all beef dog was juicy & full of flavor.  The combination of the Fries, Green Peppers, and Onions made the sandwich taste a little like Breakfast.  It was soooo good!  I could have eaten 2 of them!  This NY Hot Dog is what bumped this place to 4 Stars for me since I've never seen this item anywhere else.

Decided to go out for pizza with some friends tonight and since I'm still learning my way around out here, and starting to see that sometimes yelpers will lead you astray, I asked a friend of mine if this place was any good since its kinda close by. She said it was but also suggested another place that was equal distance away. Since I now had a choice I decided to see what yelpers had to say about both.
Both had the same amount of stars and good and bad ratings. So the deciding factor to come here was that my hubs likes thin crust, so we were directed here. I liked that they offered GLUTEN FREE pasta and pizza. 
Our server was super nice with just a little sass that I actually fell in love with right away! It made me feel comfortable and at home. 
I asked if the salads were big and she said s large would feed 3 people. I honestly did not believe her and ordered the NY CHICKEN SALAD for myself and we also ordered a XLarge combo pizza with bell peppers, pepperoni, mushrooms, and olives.  The salad was HUGE!! I brought 1/2 of it home! And there was so many fresh crispy veggies on it! More than actual lettuce, which was fine with me! The pizza was DELICIOUS! The veggies on the pizza were fresh and perfectly cooked and everything was perfect! Not one bit was soggy like I had read in other reviews. In fact, everything about this place was FABULOUS! 
Its not a stand alone resturaunt like I expected, Infact its wedged between a radio shack and a port of subs. So when we walked up and I saw it was just a bunch of tables inside, I thought ""great, loud, noisy, and uncomfortable!"" But it was just the opposite. Surprisingly quiet, pleasant, and staff was attentive   and the place was FULL! It must have been that everyone was eating because the food was so delicious instead of talking.

Not exactly sure what it was, but I'm leaning towards oregano or rosemary. Not horrible, but not exactly playing well with the other flavors. My biggest complaint would be the crust. It's properly cooked, but still ends up being soggy. My preference is for a crust with bits of charred crust. I like the flavor, texture and structure that it provides.

If you want to eat at this place, make sure you go to the one in Centennial Center, it's awesome. Can't say the same for the Summerlin one.
I've been going here since high school, it's always so much fun and the environment is very family-oriented and friendly. I remember a few years back they used to have this balloon guy that came in and made all this crazy shit, but haven't seen him recently, so me and my friends probably scared him off.
The food is a reasonable price and super good, the pizza is what this place is famous for, but the pastas and everything else is also just as delicious! I take my mom here all the time. The waitresses are so funny and they're always so nice, it's nice to see her have a good time for a change.
The place never gets too crowded, so it's often pretty quiet in here and you can actually hear the conversations with each other. It's Seat-Yourself policy unless you have 5 or more people, so you can even pick where you want to sit.

This is truely one of the only places I'm a regular at, I recommend it to anyone!",4N-HU_T32hLENLntsNKNBg,5,4,5,eKK3ern_UGsXiUdGcWm5PQ

5278206,2014-06-03,0,kUntNQ5P9IrRzEoHdRxV-w,"It's safe to say that I am a huge fan of Mark Rich's NY Pizza. This cozy restaurant is located in Centennial Center in the Sam's Club parking lot. The restaurant is small-ish in size and the seating area is pretty compact.  Don't worry though, the noise level inside always is comfortably mellow and you still have plenty of elbow room. The walls are completely covered in pictures and hallmarks of the East Coast, building on the overall vibe of the place.  

You must order the garlic knots! My husband and I are nuts for Mark Rich's garlic knots ($2.99). They're soft, thick, and loaded with garlic. I can't go here without having an order of them. I'd also recommend the eggplant parmigiana hot sub ($7. 95) with a side order of fries ($1.50). My husband's favorite is the schwarma pita ($6.99). All the food tastes fresh and homemade. The food comes out with lightning speed too. We used a restaurant.com certificate and our total came to $13! Mark Rich's is crazy affordable and has awesome food to boot.

The service is always great. The servers are attentive and very friendly,  yet casual too. The garlic knots will ALWAYS keep me coming back for more.",U-nR7ND8CDN2x8ia73CH2Q,1,1,4,SF4NIlRX_s2tEF7XY-Fq8g

THE FOOD: This' New York' pizza is just ok. Its about equal to your below average pizza in the city. Had the two cheese slice special for $5.95, a very good price as it comes with a drink. The slices are slightly smaller than your average NY slice but not by much. The crust And cheese were slightly burnt. I felt the sauce was just right. Not too much, not too little. Not too sweet, not too tangy.  It wasn't very hot when they served it.

THE SERVICE: Pretty good. Nothing special but just the right amount of attention. Welcoming, friendly, courteous and professional. 

THE ESTABLISHMENT: Very accessible in a great commercial area in Cenntenial Hills. Very clean and cheery. They have a couple of TV's with the game on. Lots of NY flare and memorabilia. The lighting US a little low though. Most importantly they have beer and FREE WIFI!",3MwccEgTNoXgc-en9e7Qzw,1,2,3,SmB1mVu4JZVtwZ9_R9h69w

Their veggie pizza is downright amazing, and they have the best cannolis I have had. They have a very good lunch deal (until 4pm) with six options for 5.65$ with a drink. My favorite lunch option is either the two slices of cheese pizza, or the one cheese slice and a small salad. They have an extra large cheese pizza  (18 inches) for 16$, which is the best deal in the neighborhood. 
They also serve gluten free pizza here.",g8_8roieVRwGJVTpNOgbYw,3,0,5,F4alGBLYYpcULY8HHp-RMA
5528023,2011-03-04,1,kUntNQ5P9IrRzEoHdRxV-w,"My favorite place for lunch specials. I always get the spaghetti marinara, and my mom loves the meat sauce. Great prices on salads for the group, and a slice of cheese pizza on the side is less than two bucks for awesome crispy cheese pizza. Homemade salad dressings are awesome. Me and my sister have made this our regular place for years before we moved across town.

My ONLY complaint is the last couple times I went before I moved they have new servers...I always get a small side of marinara for my pizza and use leftover salad ranch...its just awesome to dip. The one new servers charges us for EVERYTHING. We always get a big salad to share, but get a couple different dressings because not everyone wants ranch. Getting charged 1.50 for a side of Italian is lame. So as much as I love this place, by the time I moved I was kinda turned off and stopped going in.",rpWCcNQD7nGVUYoU6vzCFw,1,1,4,JyeqwL6G1g4fgqPvGTxWJw
5549989,2010-04-03,0,kUntNQ5P9IrRzEoHdRxV-w,"I came here strictly because I have had a restaurant.com certificate sitting around for 6 months for this place and wanted to use it.  Little did I know that it was all the way the hell in the Centennial Hills area and it was a long ass drive.  At least I got to get familiar to a new area of Vegas I have never seen before.

It wasn't really worth going out of my way to go here, however I would like it better if it was a neighborhood joint for me.  I didn't feel like eating pizza so I had the wings and fries, and I didn't like the wings at all.  I asked them not to drown them in hot sauce when they asked me if i wanted the sauce on the chicken or on the side, and they ended up giving me a bare faint of sauce, which ruined the whole entree for me.  Wings need to be tossed in sauce the moment they come out of the fryer.  When I told the waitress the wings didn't really have sauce on them she brought me some on the side, and they still didn't taste like they should after they are tossed in sauce out of the fryer.  Yes I'm picky about wings.

Anyway, husband had a medium pepperoni and although a little greasy, was pretty good.  If this was a neighborhood place for us that delivered, this would be the best pizza ever, but being that we trekked from the Henderson area, we weren't thrilled with the meal overall.

However, this was a complete bargain with our restaurant.com certificate.  We only paid $15 for two drinks, medium pepperoni, and my wings/fries.  We won't be coming here again unless we already happen to be in the area, however.",PomQayG1WhMxeSl1zohAUA,2,0,3,aWRA8Am_URZTjVWrx16HWQ
5600084,2010-12-06,1,kUntNQ5P9IrRzEoHdRxV-w,"Maybe slightly higher than a 3 star - but not a four star.  

I have been here about 5 times.  It is a small pizzaria with a New York Theme.  The staff is very friendly.  The prices are very reasnoable.  It was cool because we ordered a ""pitcher"" of root beer - pitchers of root beer take me back to the pizzaria days of my youth...

They have decent food.  My major hang up with this place is the pizza is soggy in the middle part.  You can't fold it properly or even lift up.  The pizza tastes good but it is just to soggy - almost wet in the center.  There are 2 ways to eat it; you have to fold the point end towards the crust or you are reduced to eating the pizza with a fork!!! 

Also, Ordered a cannoli.  It was very good.  They might even make the shell homemade (if this can be confirmed I would rate this a 4).  It was the right color and it wasn't perfectly round like the a factory made shell.  I told the waitress - ""Leave the gun - take the cannoli.""  She had no idea what I was talking about.  

So - It isn't the best in town, but it will cure a pizza fix if you are in the northwest part of town.",L15JCA18Ib_vMUVJILxiSw,3,2,3,7wMZnyfRJiHDKncYtohd_w
5659387,2010-11-29,0,kUntNQ5P9IrRzEoHdRxV-w,"Ate here yesterday as a group of 10 after we hiked at Red Rock. I'm not sure if any of us had been there before, but our cars were parked in the lot and we were a bit hungry so we voted between this place and In-N-Out and pizza prevailed. We were seated right away by the kitchen around 3 ish. 

I don't know about you, but I HATE splitting things as a group. The group wanted to order three large pizzas to split between us along with garlic bread. Ugh, I always feel like I'm going to have to throw down $10 for two slices or some other nonsense. I decided to opt out of the pizza and garlic bread sharing (and bill splitting) by ordering an Italian beef sandwich and fries that came with au jus (hence the reason I ordered it) and jardinere for $6.99.  The fries were thick and gave them to a guy at our table and I ate the sandwich. It was filled with a ton of meat, but I wish there had been a bit more aus jus and jardinere. It was really yummy and I'd for sure order it again, subbing onion rings for an extra charge, though. 

Apparently the pizzas and garlic bread (half with cheese, half not) was really good, according to the rest of the group. One of my friends from Jersey also opted out of the pizza sharing and got the $5.65 two slices of cheese pizza and a sprite and she said it was ok. 

The place is covered by family photos and the owner (or I assumed he was the owner) told us who the various people were on the wall.",OLn8EvPsu4hNug8V5PF2jA,1,0,3,f3jzMG2vNqL7QeMXoUL5jQ
