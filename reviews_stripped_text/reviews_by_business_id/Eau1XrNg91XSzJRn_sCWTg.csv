      The spring rolls said it all:  full of oil, indistinguishable ingredients, poor presentation - it almost screamed ""frozen.""  The other two appetizers were not as bad;  however, the service was pathetic.  With the restaurant half full and a large serving staff milling around, our servers were MIA most of the time including the wine steward.   While we had taxied to Chinoise, we passed a billboard promoting a male dancer act called ""Thunder from Down Under.""  Our young male servers should be called Blunder from Down Under.   Including the maitre d' who bounced around the room with a glad-handing look complete with bobblehead.
      Drink beer - the wines are of mediocre quality OR outrageously priced or both.  Particularly the wines by the glass.
     Even the ambiance is a disappointment.  Dark, filled with strangely inappropriate music, the downstairs dining area is a designer failure.  The soft porn Japanese prints above the bar are laughable in a city like Las Vegas and in a restaurant owned by Puck.  Tired beyond repair, Chinoise should be closed.  Shame on you.",87nfs2EBoNLrkMd6jaQCcw,1,0,1,VFRFXMT1peuPS-ERi3LkAw

We ordered all vegetarian items except for the sesame chicken which was really good. We had a noodle dish with tofu which was very flavorful, and something called deep fried tofu, which was decent. We also had some rolls which were pretty good. I would say that it was really good, plus the place was nearly empty, so the service was great. Washed down with a nice bottle of Perrier and we were good to continue on our way. The best thing was that we didn't have that bloaty feeling some chinese can give you. The food left me feeling light and energized.",aIWXZ3MCfehI-LbxCN4arg,0,1,4,cho6LoOkt3jE93xBRLuerQ
