I ate there twice. The first time around the service was slow yet I figured its Denny's and they mights have been understaffed. The second time there and notices filthy tables. However, in both instances the staff was very unfriendly. It seems as if they were not trained. I was served by a young waiter that took 10 minutes to get me coffee after I sat down for breakfast.  Then it took another 24 minutes to get the meal.  

How long does it take to get eggs with hash-browns? We KNOW FOR A FACT it shouldn't take that long since Danny's use to have a TIME guarantee whereby if you don't get that in 10 minutes the meal if FREE. So we know it should NOT take 24 minutes.

We waited 10 minutes and no one ever came to even offer us a drink. So me and my husband got up and left. Second time same thing we went for dinner and again slow service no refills cold food and the manager was so out of it. She offered me a refill and never came back with it. Last night was the worse I ended up cancelling my food. I got mozzarella sticks and they were under cooked. So were the onion rings. Our food took at least 45 minutes so I told the manager I didn't want my spaghetti anymore she didn't bother to ask why or what was the issue. We never got one refill. We asked for a check the waitress said she'd go get it 10 minutes pass by and she's somewhere at another table taking orders when we had been waiting for our check. I'm not ever coming back to this restaurant. The Dennys down the street has way better service. And food. Check #473892 Server: Anne,C_A1tipEZc6m5eurIXdYrQ,0,0,1,gPscut1SMOwUmlY_NxWooA

When we walked in, Ron pleasantly seated us far from the door as he saw that we were cold. He then brewed a fresh batch of decaf for me after he pleasantly took our drink orders. He is the most polite gentleman and it was definitely nice to have him serve us as we were a bit weary of being the only people eating there this early. However, Ron made us feel at ease and quickly took our food order amidst doing three other jobs: answering the phone, seating more guests, and running food. We both work in restaurants, and we're pleased to see him constantly smiling and hustling, with the most chipper of an attitude. Our milkshake (I know it was 4am but sounded amazing) was brought out super quick by the man himself, soon followed by our food order, exactly how it should have come. Ron refilled our drinks multiple times, as well as every other guest's (more people started showing up). Overall, I wish our restaurant was still hiring, and I could recruit Ron to be part of our team! And by the way, he's a newlywed! Congrats Ron!

Been here 3X in two weeks before leaving a review (wanted to make sure I was spot on) The people working have been the same because ive come in during the weekdays.

Each time they've been extremely busy, had to wait a couple minutes but no biggie. 

All the servers are busting their butts off and ive seen one of them with sweat on her forehead. In the 3 times ive been there Ive never seen anyone standing around. its nice to see them constantly cleaning, serving and taking orders. 

The 1st visit I ordered their new BYOB (build your own burger) its super easy and they have a list on the table to choose from, circle choices and then hand it to the waiter. makes it super easy and fast. Only 6.99 and lots of options. I got a grilled chicken on wheat with mayo, mustard, ketchup, lettuce and grilled onions, and i added bacon and avocado for $1 each. Got a salad as my side (which wasnt a choice but i asked) The sides are fries, hashbrowns, onion rings, or fruit.  

It was at my table less than 10 mins later and simply delicious.

The following visit we came with a coupon (B1G1F), so i got the grand slam breakfast which includes your drink for 8 bucks. So for two people with drinks and tax it was 10 bucks. How can you beat that?! it included 2 eggs, 2 bacon, 2 sausage, hashbrowns (or fries), 2 pancakes. So filling and delicious. 

By the third visit, the lady knew our name, what we wanted to drink and the sides we usually ask for. Service is speedy, great and friendly. Couldnt ask for more.

Dennys is great, cheap and i cant wait to come back.. especially with more coupons! (sign up for their rewards program online!)

BTW! BRING YOUR ID ON YOUR BIRTHDAY (NO COUPON NEEDED) AND GET A FREE GRAND SLAM BREAKFAST AT ANY LOCATION, ANY TIME! :)",WaAOt_eG0_-yLpG3fI--3g,7,4,5,GtFRzb0SNe0jyPykxQJrTg

Also very understanding of people have food allergies, my girlfriend is allergic to walnuts, peanuts, corn, wheat, clams & sesame. She normally gets the Ultimate omelette with hash browns well done on both sides, no toast.

Little TIP: Fill out the survey on the bottom of your receipt online. You'll get a code, write that down for your next visit. It's usually a FREE everyday value meal, still it's worth it.

This location is the closest to my house and it used to be my favorite it town. You could say I was one of the regulars. Well, that has all changed! 

Apparently the place is ""under new management"" and the new manager just plain sucks! I am a low-carb eater and one of the reasons I love Denny's is that they will accommodate me (by letting me sub broccoli for hashbrowns / toast / french fries). I have done this for years at Denny's locations all over the country (including this one) with no hassle whatsoever. Well, guess what? The ""new manager"" no longer allows this -- NOT EVEN WHEN I OFFERED TO PAY AN UPCHARGE TO HAVE A FRESH VEGETABLE INSTEAD OF POTATOES! What? 

Second, my regular waitress informed me that the ""new manager"" will not allow them to bring out water in a big glass and will only allow them to bring out a teeny, tiny, miniscule glass of water -- ONE AT A TIME -- to customers who only order ice water to drink. See my photo of how tiny this glass is, it is absolutely ridiculous! Add that to the already understaffed and overworked servers and you are really making their lives miserable. I drink like a fish, especially when I want water. I felt so bad that our waitress had to keep running back to refill my midget-sized water glass every 3 minutes. 

Since this happened, I've been back to Denny's at least 10 times but not this one. I'm not going to set food in this location ever again. I just don't get why some managers are SO shortsighted.

When I think of going out to breakfast, I want to go to these popular little spots like the Cracked Egg, The Egg and I, or Hash House a gogo.  This particular Sunday I had a lot of running around to do and missed breakfast. I was STARVED.  One of my friends who is a super healthy eater had just texted that he was on a road trip and found a Denny's to aid in his healthy eating. I couldn't imagine what he could get at a Denny's that would be healthy OR delicious.  Boy was I wrong!

In between errands, I spotted the Denny's on Tropicana and decided to give it a try. It was fairly empty so I got seated right away and service was great.  I ordered the Fit Fare omelet with a side of fruit and it was amazing. Everything was cooked perfectly and the fruit was super fresh.  I've had healthy omelets at other breakfast places before and none tasted this good. My tummy was very happy.

In addition to the awesome food, the place is very clean and service was very quick. Perfect spot for a quick and cheap, but awesomely delicious and healthy breakfast at any of the day.",LwVUO_5jjHuJRhvl6hlHVg,1,1,5,FoJBsXD8xFXivFLsX66tIg

So, we ordered drinks and closed out, and I decided might as well order the pancakes, which took 30-minutes. It would've been fine, but they wouldn't refill our drinks. I mentioned to the GM and our drinks were refilled; my buddy's coffee half full, LOL.

We made the best of it and enjoyed ourselves. The Dulce de leches pancakes were quite good. At the end, we chalked it up as to why we never go to Denny's, and valued how much better Black Bear and other diners are... when it comes to service.

This location is also ridden with dirty tables and floors and it's a slow Tuesday morning. Dead flowers on the tables too.

My order was fine, but everything my boyfriend ordered was messed up.  I don't mean that they gave him the wrong order - they gave him food that was either spoiled or contaminated.  

The first fail was the frozen coffee. It's supposed to be your typical ice blended coffee.  He got his drink and thought, ""Oh, I'm excited, coffee"" so he took a long sip and as he swallowed it down, there was a sour after taste.  Puzzled, I asked, ""What's wrong?"" and he said, ""Try this.  This doesn't taste like it's still good.""  I took a sip and it had a really sour aftertaste. I looked at him and I said, ""What was with that aftertaste?"" and he said, ""I don't know"" and ended up returning it.  He then ordered a veggie burger, which in the past has been his favorite food to order from there.  Well, during this visit, he could only eat half of it because the frozen coffee made him sick.  So we paid for the check, and went home. As soon as he started feeling better, he ate the rest of the burger.  Halfway through, he found a long hair in his burger and he started feeling sick all over again.  

Needless to say, we are not coming back.",RQSj5OQmEFBlUQ002E5BtA,0,0,1,SjAmfLcnvjYCheYjlFxGHQ
