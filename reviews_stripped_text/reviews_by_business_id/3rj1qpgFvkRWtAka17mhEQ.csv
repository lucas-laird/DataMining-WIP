    Tonight I went in at. 6:05 pm and found a parking spot up front because it wasn't terribly crowded. It all went downhill from there. I had a coupon for a buy one, get one and ordered one chicken dinner for here and one to go.  It took forever for my house meal to come and when it did, I was told that was the last of the chicken and was asked if I wanted a menu to order something different for my take out meal. It took another long while to get the menu. She dropped off the menu and I finished my tea and dinner before she ever came back! I was so thirsty! No refills! She finally came back to get my order. I asked if I could have a refill on my tea. I had to wait forever for that. My order came and she asked for my coupon number, which I gave her when she took the initial order. She said she lost it.  I went through my emails in my ""trash"" and tried to locate it. Finally my order came and I asked for the bill.  That took another 20 minutes. I got the bill and asked where the second drink was (you have to purchase two drinks and one entree). That was another 15 minutes... Normally I wouldn't have bothered, but it was $3.29!  All in all, I was there for over two hours!!!  This is the first time in my 60 years on earth that I did not leave a tip!!

After waiting an hour and a half for a table that we made a reservation for 3 weeks in advance and watching numerous parties of our same size be seated ahead of us without reservations, I came to the conclusion these people don't understand the process of reservations. Standing in the waiting area with 3 small children under the age of 5 all as well behaved as they could possibly be at that age, I was ready to leave if it was not for my pregnant sister who really wanted to eat here. At least the manager had enough sense to cover the cost of our meal for our party of 9 however it took her an hour and a half to realize that our wait was ridiculous.

If it was not for the server who worked 20+ years at the Monte Carlo and was used to dealing with upset customers I was ready to give a review of 1 star because Yelp will not allow a 0 star review. At the least I was amble to leave the restaurant without being upset with the service however it will be a long time before I return here.

So, I had been to Mimi's many times for breakfast in the past.  It was certainly not a gourmet meal, but it was always a good place to get waffles and a side of potatoes.  Plus they had fresh-squeezed orange juice that I would always want, but then scoff at the price and decide against.

I hadn't been back to Mimi's in quite some time.  Not sure why.  But when I came back I couldn't believe how different the food was.  It still looked pretty much the same, but I guess the quality had gone downhill.

The eggs were bland, the waffle was bland, and the potatoes that I used to love were awful.  They were too soft and, you guess it, bland.  Plus the orange juice was from a carton- but the good news is they lowered the price.

My husband and I both left half of the food on our plates.  That is highly unusual.

364631,2017-04-17,0,3rj1qpgFvkRWtAka17mhEQ,"There is so much to say about this place. It is so inconsistent. Some days it is good food, some days it is so bad. The coupons are a joke. After adding 2 overpriced soft drinks, you could have just paid for 2 entrees. This last visit was a doozy however, so I thought I would share.

Armed with a buy one/get one coupon (must purchase drinks), we go into Mimi's to get some steak and eggs. Pretty easy, both entrees the same. We order, both steaks medium. eggs over medium, again easy.

The entrees come, my steak is still mooing, blood running all over the eggs. I ask the waitress to please have it cooked a bit more. She takes the steak, leaving me the eggs and returns it to the kitchen. Steak and eggs are meant to be eaten together, so I wait.

Steak comes back a bit browner on top and I proceed to take a bite. First bite was better, however as I cut into the middle of the steak, it was cold and clearly on the rare side. As the manager passed, I asked him if he could please have the steak cooked as ordered. He took my entire plate (eggs, potatoes and steak) and headed back to the kitchen.

About 5 mins later, he reappeared with a hockey puck on a saucer and proceeded to place that in front of me. This ""steak"" as hard as a rock. I asked, where are the eggs and potatoes that he had taken away, to which he responded ""Oh, you wanted those?"". 

After sawing through this joke of a steak, the manager returned with 2 eggs on a saucer (sunny side up and not what I ordered) with no potatoes. I stated that this steak was inedible and that I just wanted to cancel the order and he can keep the eggs as well.

The lovely waitress comes over and places a bill of 23.00 on the table. I explained to the waitress that this was unacceptable as I had a buy one get one coupon and the bill is the same as if we had both eaten our meal. I said, I don't mind paying for the coffees and maybe 1/2 the entr√©e that was eaten, however to pay the same amount as if we both had eaten seemed unfair.

She puts the bill back on the table and says ""Well the manager did this and now you can use the coupon again next time"". As if this is a golden coupon. As if this coupon is exclusive! Google Mimi's coupons and you will see these are readily available.

I ask to speak with said manager. I explain my situation, he looks puzzled however ends up ""as a favor"" comping the entire bill. Wow, Thanks.

443748,2015-09-19,0,3rj1qpgFvkRWtAka17mhEQ,"While wait service has always been quite good here it's an unevenness in good prep that keeps them from being stand-out.  Luckily on this visit the reason for our visit was the salmon & frites entree.  On this occasion the portion of salmon was both moist and perfectly cooked. Their salmon prep while not always perfect has remained more consistent than that of the BJ's Brewhouse down the street. It was as hoped for with the only thing missing is that Mimi's could provide malt vinegar on the side or an available option.  We brought our own to remedy that.  About 3 years ago Mimis ceased offering their salmon w/ citrus salad that was so good, offering it instead with a less successful spinach salad mix, not nearly as good.  It would be nice if that returned to their menu.  
   Our other entree was the steak & frites. The steak was cooked as ordered but was not one of their most tender we've had. There wasn't a lot of flavor to it despite the dollop of flavored butter on top, so some additional salt and just a dash of A-1 (which I normally don't use) were needed.  Still, the meal overall was reasonable, rendered better by our use of the Buy one-get one free coupon we were armed with.   We also took home a 4-pk of blueberry
Muffins for the next day's breakfast, and those muffins are unfailingly a great treat.   We'll be back to Mimi's again but likely will stay away from their steak. They are not a steak house and I sometimes forget to account for that.  They do have several savory items on board the menu to fill up on, & that's something else you can say for Mimi's....we always leave full.",awc9UwCGo3LMwcPaS121-A,0,0,4,flCDnC7q3_PmxjAKJhyApA

Entered the restaurant at 8pm on a Friday night and was greeted and seated right away, the hostess was great. Once we sat down, not one person acknowledged us for over 10 minutes. Multiple servers, employees, and a manager walked past us without saying a word and a couple even made eye contact with me.  Our menus were closed, tables near us were being cleaned and we were just overlooked. After 12 minutes we got up and left the restaurant and then I went back into share with an employee to let them know, not to get anybody in trouble, but to just let them know we were disappointed and to hopefully help them fix the process. 

When I went back inside once again I was greeted quickly at the door and I shared my experience.  The server who talked to me was polite,  apologetic, and offered free muffins.  I didn't want muffins, just wanted to let them know about the situation, so I denied them from the employee. 

We will return in hopes of better service in the future, I mean I really do like their muffins.",bgCF0GbB97KJ58F9ZjrrDg,0,0,2,ofv-sLknyvMzKNMKaExc2g

When we arrived there were several tables within our sight cluttered with the remains of previous diners.  We were told we would have a 15-20 minute wait for a table.  We were seated before that time had expired... But then we waited for about 10 minutes before being offered water or other beverages... Not acceptable especially when they were not busy.  We were also short two table settings and had to ask for them from the server.  When he bought them, he simply put the silverware in a pile on the center of the table and didn't bring any additional napkins.  We had to ask another server to bring those.  We had to ask for a replacement for one of the small plates used for bread as it was dirty.  I ordered steak and frites, my wife the French Onion soup, and our guests ordered the pot roast.  My steak upon arrival was tepid at best and either the frites died waiting at the pass or they were microwaved.  In either case they were inedible and I sent them back.  Neither of the servings of pot roast were hot and on one plate the mashed potatoes were downright cold.  I won't write off Mimi's just yet as any place can have an off night and our previous experiences have been good.  However I will be cautious and our next visit will most certainly not include guests.",WBUmw3eyAe0CoBESgeoakA,0,0,3,XonRANSjgNS4UZ5c6UDXUw

Sometimes, service isn't too bad, but I have had 2 visits that were just awful.  I think they are under-staffed.  And they don't have enough glassware or silverware - so sometimes they just run out!  This location also doesn't have any alcohol, just beer and wine.  The food quality is ok - it's the service that is bad here.

I liked the flavor and it was savory so it hit the spot. My wife had the avocado burger that she liked. We had my little nephew with us who ate a side of fries that were actually really good. The problem I had was the service. We had to ask someone for our place settings and silverware. Our waitress forgot to bring our bread basket. So we got our bread after our meal came. I asked for a refill of water that never came. We decided to order the pumpkin cheesecake so I had to wave the waitress down to get her attention. The cheesecake was terrible!

I don't care that the portions are much smaller, but the prices went up and the menu selection reduced to 2 pages.

Went here for lunch with a business client  I ordered tomato basil soup ( incorrectly listed as bisque) and a turkey pesto ciabatta which came my my voice of fries, chips or for a $1 more onion rings or sweet potato fries. The sandwich comes with fresh roasted turkey, bacon, tomato, lettuce, mozzarella avocado, and a basil pesto mayonnaise. I went with the chips and requested no tomatoes or lettuce on the sandwich. 

The person I was with ordered soup and a salad. The soups both arrived, I really enjoyed mine and he enjoyed his French Onion. An appropriate amount of time later out entrees arrived. By the time I realized my sandwich had tomatoes and lettuce on it and I also received fries (not the chips I ordered) the waitress had vanished. Although it was lunch time the place wasn't very busy, I would say they were steady but far from busy. The waitress didn't return until she brought the check and my associate had already finished his meal (no drink refills, no checkup after the food came out, nothing). I actually started to worry about her well being, had someone kidnapped her? 

I hadn't moved the plate from where she placed it when it came out. It was obvious that the food hadn't been touched at all and she asked if I wanted a box. I pointed out the fact that everything was wrong and told her I just wanted the bill because I didn't want my associate to sit there and watch me eat my lunch. I just wanted to pay and leave and never go to another MiMi's cafe again. Instead of offering me a  new correct sandwich and chips to go she returned with the bill that still had my sandwich listed.

Mimi's was nearby and I was curious about it, since I'd never been there before.  The interior is cosy and could be described as a mashup between 1920s Paris and early 20th century New Orleans.  Casual and comfy.  I ordered the ""light"" tilapia with steamed veggies and brown rice: nothing spectacular, but I wanted a light meal and was craving some fish.  My husband had the chicken crepes, which were heavy and ""too creamy.""  He also thought that the salad came with too much dressing.  Our dining companions all had the French onion soup and various accompaniments (fries, sliders, salad).

Not sure what was ""French"" about most of the menu....""French fries"" and ""French onion soup"" isn't ""French.""  To me, anyway....

Our server was very friendly and accommodating.  Nice gal.

Mimi's won't be a go-to spot for me, as I like my restaurants to have that bit of pizzazz and spice, both literally and figuratively.

it does, however, ease my pain a bit to know that mimi's started out as a small, family run joint back in the '70's.

with that said, we frequent this particular mimi's because of its proximity to our home - 2 minute drive, with traffic.

food is always good.
service is always above average.
bread basket rocks my socks!!!

it also helps to sign up for their email program where you receive coupons for free meals and such.

i would give them 5 stars but on a recent visit here, we saw a server take a pepper shaker from the prep area and while attempting to screw the lid on it, dropped the lid on the floor, picked it up, blew on it and then proceeded to screw it back onto the shaker.

2206938,2013-01-16,1,3rj1qpgFvkRWtAka17mhEQ,"I've been to various Mimi's around the country, but something seemed ""off"" about this one.

Americans are overfed and our restaurants and fast food joints give us portions that are just way too big. But this location, the portions are too small. I was dining with nine other people, and all of us were left wondering if we accidentally ordered an appetizer. 

I had the soup and half a sandwich. You're given about half a cup of soup and out of the sandwich choices I opted for the turkey on rye. I think when I said rye the waitress heard wheat (we'll get to her later) so I was given a small sandwich (about size of an iphone) toasted with the crust cut off.

My waitress was a hot mess. I don't blame Mimi's, it was hers. I came a little late and as soon as I sat down, she came over to take my drink order. I ordered water and hot tea. Within seconds she was back with my water and a wooden display with various types of tea and honey. But no tea cup. She said she'd be right back with it. She came to take our orders and I reminded her about the tea cup. She came back to deliver the sparkling champagne some ordered. I reminded her about the tea cup. She delivered some salads. I reminded her about the tea cup. Finally, after about 40 minutes of this, I went to the bar and got it myself. Of course, as soon as I walked back with it, the waitress says ""I was just about to go get it!""

Back to my sandwich. I ordered the turkey on rye with no cheese, add mustard the sandwich comes with mayo, tomato and lettuce. The sandwich was delivered to me with nothing between the bread (wheat, not rye) but turkey. No mustard, no mayo, no tomato, no lettuce. When I asked my waitress what the deal was, she didn't get rude, but she did insist that that's the way I ordered the sandwich. She messed up all 10 orders. Each time she insisted that she had taken our ordered exactly as we'd given them to her. Again, she wasn't rude, but it was obnoxious.

Of course when the check came it was another hot mess express from our dear waitress.

That would explain why everyone's favorite bread with the raisins is now a disappointing shell shape. It is now crisp around the edges. You took away one of my favorite memories of Mimi's.

The Atlantic salmon was delicious. The salmon was a bit small for $14 but it was cooked well. The star of the plate were the small red potatoes. They were well seasoned and tender. The spinach was cooked perfectly and cleaned well. It was yummy.

Being there with family, all were in a great mood and they had chosen the place. Waitress introduced herself and we seemed headed for a great breakfast. We chatted and waited and waited and waited....finally the waitress brought some of the food and explained to one party they had burned her breakfast crepes and would remake for her. My eggs benedict were ordered eggs poached medium well with no running whites. If they had been somewhere close I could have been stoic but being so runny and somewhat clear looking, there was no way. They said they would happily redo and brought me back two eggs in the identical runny white condition. I gave up. The redone crepes appeared finally and the whole plate was very beige and apparently tasted beige also!   I chased down the waitress for more coffee....chasing meaning actually having to leave my seat to locate her.... chased her to give her my coupon......then I chased her down for the bill, then I had to chase her down to pay the bill.

The first time , we did not get our soup or salad , and the waitress was very few and far between on the drink refills.  Anyone that knows me , knows i suck down iced tea like its going out of style.  Sometimes i even have them bring me 2 glasses of it.    I think i got 1 refill the entire time.... needless to say there was a drought . 

2nd time it was gorgeous outside , so we decided to sit outside. .... BAD IDEA.  Same issue with the waitress ,  very little checking up on us.  She was not even the one who brought us our food.   On top of that , they charged me for 3 of the 2 for 15 dollar meals instead of just 2 .....  no apology , no discount , no free dessert ... no nothing.  Just a 15 minute wait to get it fixed. And on our way .

Went to Mimi's Caf√© again for a breakfast date with the wifey.  I am still surprised how packed this place is in the morning.  Lucked out and asked if we could see the lunch menu as well.  Fortunately, a number of lunch items on their menu are available at breakfast (things like pot roast are not).  Not feeling too breakfast-y, the wifey and I opted for something off the lunch menu.

Mimi's lunch menu has many options - from salads, to hot and cold sandwiches, burgers, and entrees.  Many of them looked yummy.  We both chose from the sandwich and burger section.  

Wifey had the Bacon Avocado Sourdough Burger - grilled garlic-Parmesan sourdough with avocado, Swiss cheese, bacon, lettuce, tomato, red onion, pickle, and 1000 Island dressing.  She chose a side of Mimi's House Salad with vinaigrette.  She liked it a lot!  Burger was a nice size patty and cooked just right with some pink in the middle, avocado and veggies were fresh, and the bacon and grilled sourdough gave the burger nice texture crunch.  Overall very tasty.

I had the French Dip (ooh la la) - sliced roast beef on a toasty baguette with horseradish cream and a side of au jus.  I could have added bell peppers, caramelized onions, mushrooms, and mozzarella for an extra fee but decided not to because I really wanted to taste the beef.  For my side I chose French fries.  Verdict?  Not bad!  Good French Dip indeed but I've had it better in other places.  The baguette was a bit dry, but nothing some extra (extra) horseradish cream couldn't solve.  Slather that baby up!  The meat was tender and sliced just right on the thinner side for a better bite, great flavor when dipped into the au jus.  Just wish the meat portion was larger!  I probably should have added at least some mozzarella cheese as well since that would have added some unctuousness to the sandwich.  But a very good effort on a French Dip.

Mimi's Caf√© is not a bad option for a nice breakfast or lunch.  It's cozy and very inviting.  The prices are a bit more on the high side for an entr√©e, but it's worth going every once in a while for some French influenced cuisine.",QCtHk02W_Asu2LFfdmGQDA,4,0,3,HQxR9FzIGYOiIVIE7Vu50g

The booth we were shown had food crumbs all over it and the partition above the table was covered in dust.  The carpet looked filthy and the edges of the benches were stained and worn.  I ordered coffee and the mug was chipped and the plate my food was served on was so worn down it was covered in stains and scratches.  I think the worst part was that I had ordered a side of fruit for breakfast.  I got a piece of honeydew, cantaloupe and two pieces of an orange slapped down on a piece of lettuce.  What really threw me off was the whole thing tastes like they had sprayed it with orange juice.  The melons still had their rinds on them and the honeydew wasn't even pitted.

The problems started when the food came. The fruit was dried out and hard, like it had been sitting on the counter after it was cut for several hours. My oatmeal was still in the shape of the pan it had been over cooked in and was dry. Then my dads omelette was extremely small, flat, and over cooked.  We mentioned the fruit to the waiter and he replied that the fruit was cut like that. No...fruit doesn't come out solid like plastic.
So I asked for the manager and told him our complaints. We were trying to be polite about it as possible.  He said he would see what happened and walked away. He never came back to speak with us again. 
We finally tracked down the waiter to ask for the check and he told us the check had been taken care of. Very nice of them, but the manager nor the waiter told us anything until after we asked where the check was. The manager didn't offer an apology, check back in, or offer to fix the meal brought out.
Then I had to break a ten to leave a tip for the waiter, and I couldn't find the waiter again. I went to the front and the hostess told me she couldn't help me and to ask someone else.
So after all was said and done, we got change from another waitress on the other side. I left a tip for his service, and we left. The hostess didn't offer any kind of farewell when we were leaving, she had a bit of an attitude.

The sweeping waitress lingered around our table pretending to sweep, but it was a front.

I also had the Asian chicken salad with an extra side of chicken, also very delicious this salad is one of my favorites just the right amount of the sesame seed dressing. The size of the serving  was pretty big so I even had some leftover for later. Others at the table had omelettes that look very very good along with the potatoes those look delicious. I did not have a chance to try one like I wanted to.  our meal was very good. I'm sure we will be back in September.",8PlHxzCf1SFqPDBWpxrEqw,1,1,5,H2WN1NvZQcOLFZrb1o1H2w

However, we went in today for lunch and were very pleasantly surprised to find our old Favorite Restaurant is back!!!
Although it was super busy, we were quickly seated.  Stacey our waitress was bubbly and on top of everything.  Hector in the kitchen did an amazing job with food presentation.  Everything was fresh and delicious.  Great menu selections too.  To top everything off, Augustine the floor manager, heard about our previous bad experiences during the beginning of the year and came over with two free muffins.

4405950,2009-02-22,7,3rj1qpgFvkRWtAka17mhEQ,"I came here for Saturday morning breakfast.  It was pretty busy but we were seated immediately.

The place is covered in New Orleans Soul decor which was very cool but the seating was very cramped.

The menu was very extensive which lots of omelette options.
I chose the Mardi Gras Omelette sticking to the theme, the wife had the Chicken Fried Steak breajfast & the kid had Eggs & Fruit. Each breakfast came with choice of juice & bread. I had the Buttermilk spice muffin which was excellent.

The kids food came out and he finished it before we heard anything from the waitress who said she was gonna check on it. 5 minutes later it was served and it was COLD!!!

Having waited 30-4 0 minutes already it didn't take much to turn this situation worse. My wife politley explained to the waitress it was COLD & she would like it done over. NO problem the waitress apologized.

10 minutes later after everyone had finished the CFS re-emerged. this time HOT but lacking any gravy. After that was fixed the check appeared and SHIT HIT THE FAN!!

2 CFS @ $9.99 EACH - We were charged for sending it back!!!

Needless to say after a few words with the MGMT the charges were reversed but we will NOT  be returning. Not very good customer service at all.",3Vd_ATdvvuVVgn_YCpz8fw,8,7,2,wpK5t92cxe9AXhRjCd6L6g

4484448,2011-07-26,0,3rj1qpgFvkRWtAka17mhEQ,"It has been a few years since I've been to a Mimi's, so when one of the other two couples we were going out with suggested it, we agreed.

I ordered the chicken breast from the 3-course seasonal menu.  It came with soup or salad, the main course, and a mini-dessert.  I decided that for once I'd say no to dessert, and the waitress let me have the soup and salad instead of dessert.  I had the French onion soup, which was very good.  Though I love it, I usually never order it anywhere because it's always way too salty.  Happy to say that it was much less salty here, and after that and the salad, I was finished.  

Knowing that I'd be eating at home solo the next night, I took the main course home.  It's a good thing I fill up easily; otherwise there would have been no leftovers.  The chicken breast was really, really small.  It was the smaller half of a chicken breast, covered with bacon and cheese.  It came with a creamy tomato sauce with diced artichoke hearts.  If it had been swimming in the sauce, I may not have noticed the size, but I asked for the sauce on the side.  It was dwarfed by a big mound of mashed potatoes, and a very tiny bit of fresh vegetables - two broccoli florets, and two slices each of green and yellow zucchini.  When I had the main course tonight, it was good, but nothing to rave about.

Service was efficient, but not overly friendly.

With so many great restaurants to choose from in Vegas, Mimi's will never be my first choice, but it's definitely an okay occasional alternative.",m-BZLIIh5PCAKnzH0qj_0Q,0,0,3,815oBkwS1wVKRD9FRRjUHQ

The bread selection before the meal is really the only thing that stands out above the rest definitely try the bran bread very tasty. I have had both the new York strip and the French dip both were fine just not anything special for the prices they ask the roast beef on the French dip is very tough and has a hard bite to it the aus jus is lightly seasoned and nothing special and the horseradish sauce is unappealing at best really. With the steak I think maybe the cooks just aren't  well versed in the art of preparing a new York strip just making an average ho hum run of the mill chuck and again for the price just not worth what you are paying.,k5XFyzSbP1yW2nXkrh6ZCw,0,0,2,287N2Th2fXmjz1njGTOfkA

It makes you feel as though you are imposing on the staff by coming.   Of course we never know what is happening in people's lives, but I am not naming any names, so no one is getting hurt.

After being patrons since 1999 we have come to expect much better.  We were told we would have to wait 20-25 minutes for the pot pie- ok.  But you changed your authentic chicken pot pie, made of pie dough and real pieces of chicken to a bowl full of goo, pre fabricated pieces of chicken with flaky frozen biscuit dough on top which immediately became soggy. This was what I waited 25 minutes for?    It was not even edible.  It appears you have gone down hill.  

Also, we were sat right by the kitchen and it was so loud you could barely hear people at your table at times.  An employee was standing on the booth next to us washing windows. This is something that should be done after hours.

4578272,2018-04-01,0,3rj1qpgFvkRWtAka17mhEQ,"First time visiting Mimi's Cafe in a while. I was excited because the last time I went there I loved the food (especially their zucchini sticks). 
Tonight we were sat down, and it seemed like the menu had changed a lot (I could be mistaken).

Anyway I ordered the a French Quarter burger with extra dressing on the side and my friend ordered the Chicken Cheddar Mac. We recieved my food and I was very unimpressed. There was a side of dressing, but zero on the burger.  

  So I took a big bite (i didn't know at the time there wasn't any dressing) of a VERY dry burger (like even if the dressing had been on there it still would have been dry) plus the the bread was soggy and the pieces of avocado was only placed on one side of the burger (doesnt make for any kind of cohesive bite). It was almost like it had been sitting out for a bit... My friend liked her chicken cheddar mac, but did say the sauce was REALLY thin. 

I explained to our waitress, Katie, and she offered to find something else I liked. So I looked at the menu and just picked whatever I had read before bc I felt like I was on the spot because she was waiting there and I just got the menu. So, I ended up get the Turkey Pesto Ciabatta sandwich. Again, not worth the money.  There was absolutely no pesto and it (I cook w pesto a lot) looked like they used just plain mayonnaise which was another big disappointment. The sandwich was mediocre at best. Something I could whip up in 3 minutes. I ate about a 1/4 of it and then took it to go. The only thing they had going for them on that plate was the fresh fries (although they were not at all salted).
  Unless we have a coupon or someone drags me here I wont be coming back. It's just mediocre food that's over priced. 
On a lighter note though, our waitress Katie was polite and did try to make it better. My only issue with her was that I asked if I could replace the fries with zucchini sticks, to which she said I dont know and didn't even bother checking. Even if there was a price difference I would have been Ok with that, but she did nothing to find out or help. The, I'm assuming here, supervisor was nice and did ask to see how my meal was going after I had the replacement. 
Basically, not a stellar experience. Disappointed with tonight's dinner.",8Fr2Jx2vTTo7e0mUb02g0A,1,0,2,25dZ_eVLI9_cB49huyH9PA

I ordered my burger extra well-done and received a FLAVORLESS bleeding hunk of beef on a tasteless sourdough thing with rubbery bacon. Nothing had any flavor. My mother and sister got some seafood skewers, they said they were good. My daughter's Mac-n-cheese came out ice cold and there was a film over her mashed potatoes from sitting so long. Pissed me off. 

The waitress just seemed frazzled and clueless. She had to come back three times because she forgot what we ordered to drink (There were four of us), refilled my sisters Sprite with water, and didn't provide napkins or silverware until we asked her twice. But she sure brought the check out and took our money with a quickness!

We got a 4 pack and ate them as breakfast the next couple of days in Vegas. Really delicious and a good buy. Great alternative to some of the places on the strip. Affordable.

Hostess that sat us I think was crying. Her eyes were red and wet. Maybe it's allergies, but if it's not...Jesus, somebody give her a 10 minute break to cool down. Just heartless if the girl got some bad news or having a bad day and they just put her in the front to be the supposed to be smiling first face you see. 

We sat in a corner booth and the table was dirty and the drape decor in our booth was dusty. There was this sewer smell that we couldn't quite place that was on that side of the restaurant and was on and off. We moved booths and it wasn't as bad, but you get a whiff sometimes...should've left....shoudl've fucking left then. 

Bf got their Summer 3 course meal which you pick a soup or salad, a entree and a petite dessert. French Onion Soup- okay, nothing special. Chicken& Asparagus Ravioli- the chicken pieces were shredded breast and was overcooked. The sauce had a flavor about it...it was overly seasoned with oregano that you couldn't taste anything else. (We started to get our food and thats when the smell came back too- should use the other side of the restaurant if the smell is on this side of the place).  Dessert- Cinammon Beignets w/ custard inside served with chocolate and raspberry sauce- too doughy, but was okay. 

I got beef bourguignon. It was good, but this was no borguignon. It's pot roast with gravy and vegetables thrown on it. They gave me grilled asparagus on it which is a plus with me since I love em grilled. Mashed potato served with it wasn't seasoned.  I got a petite treat of the bread pudding. This wasn't petite, it was actually a pretty big serving. It wasn't good. Dense dry, and then the syrup which is normally yummy butterscotchy syrup was just syrup. It didn't taste like anything, it was just sweet. C'mon even Station casinos one comes with a vanilla custard and good syrup on it. 

Highlight of the meal for me was the free breadbasket. I like their carrot cake loaf. 

The service was attentive I'll give them that. Our drinks were refilled, we were checked on. Now if the kitchen crew and cleaning crew can get with it. Food was not good and the place isn't deep cleaned so they're slacking off. 

The BF was not feeling it and left a bit annoyed and not  wanting to come back. 

Now the kicker- I just got home and threw up, twice already. 

Yeah, we're not coming back nor letting any of our friends eat here. I have a nose and throat infection developing so I feel like shit already and no, this kind of getting sick doesn't make me throw up.

Weird to be lacking on, when it's suppose to be a routine thing? 

Regardless of the MIA bread, the meal came out pretty quick, which was expected because we were there when it was practically empty. 

The tomato soup was pretty good, but can't say that I was impressed with the ""steak"" I was served. Not cooked the way I asked, for one, and I'm also sure it wasn't even real meat. Tasted more like soybeans and earthworms.  
The mash potatoes were also lacking in any sort of flavor other than sand. Maybe a little hint of salt, but that could of been the leftover oily residue that was on my tongue from the fake-a-steak.

Our waiter seemed less than enthused to be around people, but regardless he was attentive and refilled our drinks frequently. He was probably in a hurry to get us the hell out of their before we started complaining to him.

I ordered the Half whole chicken. Presentation was nothing like the picture. But none the less, looked good. Chicken, very tender. Light skin, and very very light flavor. I don't I've ever had to add salt and pepper from the table to any plate I've ever eaten at a restaurant. 
Plus side. The fries were pretty dam good though. 

The other plate we ordered was the steak. Actually, very well cooked, it wasn't half bad. (7/10)

To order, I had the hickory smoked bacon and eggs and he got orange marmalade stuffed pancakes. The muffin that I got with my meal was piping hot, fresh and tasted delicious with the cream cheese on top. Honestly, one of the best muffins I've ever had.

The food came out shortly after, and was also piping hot and fresh. My entre√© came with seasoned potatoes that I didn't expect and they were perfect. Seasoned well and everything. Eggs were cooked to my taste and the bacon was hickory smoked indeed.

Their food is NOT New Orleans style or themed- yet the place is crawling with Mardi Gras decor. 
The food is overpriced for what you get- and it isn't that great. The best thing they have, for me, is their grilled cheese sandwich. What makes it good is that they grill Parmesan cheese on the outside, giving it a nice crunch. But I can make that at home, and make it less greasy too.

Regardless of the wait, within the 30+ mins I looked behind me & saw a manager pick food from the salad bar with her bare hands & dip it in some dressing and eat it. She did that twice. The third time she looked up & saw that I could see her so she put it down immediately & proceeded to get a little cup then still went to use her hands!

I received a lot of fries that were under friedand this little piece of chicken.  It was $12.99 for fries and 4 bites of chicken.  Everyone else's meal was worth the price.  The menu has totally changed.  new look,  less choices and higher prices.",7PD0EuTfz4S-F7L73XkheQ,1,0,2,00WwgK-xsUbK2_gHgLWa5A

The hollandaise sauce was a bit off, thick and tasted like lemon and potato. The French toast was not crisp, the texture was like a wet sponge. Coffee was ok a little better than gas station coffee. Prices should be lower for quality. All in all would not go again. I can see why so many old people go here. No offense but your tastebuds do start to go when u get to a certain age.",m9wgH9B7YpjaHGeC7zdVlw,0,0,3,3oF60yv8ZauhijDBuASwwA

It came with a low-fat blueberry muffin (didn't taste so well but that's what I get for ordering low-fat) and some fresh fruit. I like the overall atmosphere here, it feels like a family place and in a way I feel homey here. Also the artwork is pretty cool too.",QbWIYD-Ps9YzDW4a4K022A,1,0,5,fJEDElL3jKMRqnNDFjKFJQ

I ordered a turkey club sandwich and not only did my waitress take forever to get to my table but the food tasted very dry like it was sitting out. The fries I got were also so cold and disgusting. Our waiter was nice but It took her forever to come and ask what we wanted to order and pick up our check. This place in general has horrible food and service.,fc4jL9JpU8t5wQKbWqY9ow,0,0,1,QA5cQuQuiJw8-yp_aah-ng

Had a kids pancake that looked like a dog and she loved it. The breakfast tacos were very very dry but she said we're tasty. Orange juice was warm, should of been ice cold in my opinion. Staff and service was good with no complaints. Won't make it our favorite breakfast place but I'm sure we will be back.",RIqF5RnBAzetCmyAXbVZiA,0,0,3,ABbsvZwA4E9BSEuGd1TbaA
