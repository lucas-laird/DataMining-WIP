I sent my daughter in with the sandwich card ready to be redeemed - it was a little old so she asked if she could use it before ordering.  Apparently the owner Mike Egan felt that the card had been stolen and falsified because the signatures were not consistent with his methods.  He assumed the worst and was extremely rude and hostile to my daughter, treating her as a criminal.  I spoke to Mr. Egan and as expected he denied treating her in such a fashion regardless of the other eye witness accounts.  He stated that because there were so many of the same stamps/signatures it looked suspicious.  Well yes Mr. Egan I have 7 people in my family, we buy 7 sandwiches at one time so the stamping and signatures would be consistent for a transaction of 7. Rather than ask questions, he was a bully.

I had previously heard rumors that he mistreats his employees, is rude and has even had employees quit on the spot.  After this incident I believe the rumors and don't doubt any of the witnesses.  While he has a right to deny using a card, he doesn't have the right to traumatize my daughter (or anyone else) which is exactly what he did.   I can assure everyone that I will take my business to the local Subway for now on.",YNh41fvhGu2ZI6QNBnn4kQ,7,0,1,3RaRE5IojFT2HczrtYwKbw

682869,2014-09-06,3,gZFjmwpGXJK5YGnS3bjflg,"I am truly disappointed and appalled with the customer service I received Yesterday, 9/05/14 around 6:45 pm. I love Port of Subs and the fact that this is the closest location to me; however this establishment clearly could care less about their Customer Service. I walked into Port of Subs with my boyfriend after having excellent customer service next door at ""Shall We Play?"" (A Family Board Game Store, which I highly recommend visiting). 

When we first walked into Port of Subs, it was as if we were ALREADY doing or asking for too much. There were two young men and a short frumpy girl with glasses working the floor. The girl was nonchalantly posted up against the wall by the young man, serving a Mother and her young daughter. I don't know what rubbed me wrong the most...The fact that they all physically turned their heads to see us walk in without saying Hello (I mean the shop next door was busier than this place and the man running the store was more courteous. He took the time to Welcome and wish everyone who walked in a good day) or the fact that she laughed obnoxiously while she watched us walk in, like we were already wasting our time.
 
We proceeded to give them the benefit of the doubt, considering it was dead and they close up at 9:00 pm. We made it to the beginning of the line and waited for some sort of acknowledgement that we would be helped soon, but STILL no one spoke to us. The girl was clearly being lazy and had this ""I don't give a shit attitude"" and walked away from the wall as we made it to the beginning of the line. She then literally began doing all her closing duties right in front of us with about TWO HOURS left before closing. I don't know where she learned how to work or who taught her ""Customer Service"" but they need to get rid of the cancer in that store. It's apparent I am not the first to report this girl's attitude and how horrible the shop is ran, which is why I am surprised they are still in business! 
Anyway, we proceeded to wait about 15 minutes or so until the young man poked his head into the back and waved the other employee out for some help. ""Finally"" (I thought) but the girl halted him back and flat out said in front of us, 

""No don't worry about it, they can wait. Go, Go! "". 

I couldn't believe this girl! She was really making us wait for NO REASON, other than the fact that she didn't want to be there and was too lazy to DO HER JOB.  I have worked in hospitality for years and this has been the worst experience I have had in awhile! When I heard that remark I was disgusted and asked my boyfriend if he was ready to leave, since it was clear they did not want to serve us (for whatever reason). When we turned to leave the store, the girl laughed rudely and said, 

""See!"" as if we fell for her plan.

People like her don't deserve to be employed and it is disappointing to see them take advantage of an opportunity they were GIVEN, clearly she didn't EARN it.  Her job is obviously too hard to handle and people who take advantage of their Employer like this should no longer BE employed! She got everything SHE wanted, but what about the Customers? I couldn't believe she was okay with how she represented herself and this establishment. I guess we should have walked out the minute they ""acted"" like they were too busy to say ""Hi, we will be right with you!"" But as a regular of Port of Subs, I was expecting to be in and out with satisfactory service. I will never waste my business or hard earned money ever again at this Port of Subs location. 

To the General Manager of this store, I would advise hiring some hard workers who would appreciate the opportunity of employment and truly benefit your location. That unhappy girl (and I say girl because she clearly is not mature enough to work) needs to go, because that will be your downfall. Definitely won't EVER recommend someone to visit this location, but I will be back to ensure that my review and the previous customer reviews are heard. If that girl is STILL there after all the reviews she ALONE is accumulating, then I  think the only appropriate action would be to contact the Corporate Office as well as the BBB if they can't make this simple change on their own.",QIQZKv5Mbfa2CzNV0mf9uw,3,1,1,zW6V4Sv0zgF6LboWtTaUnw

I repeated my phone number 3 times because Mariah couldn't focus to input my phone number correctly. She told me that it wouldn't be a problem to give her my phone number. After striking out the 3rd time I gave her my card. 

The guy actually making my sandwich tried his best. He did a pretty good job but Mariah had already set a negative tone with a ""get out of Dodge attitude.""

I did take a year + break from this location because of Mariah's attitude and lack of focus. I decided to visit since my husband requests burritos from time to time from Roberto's. I'm vegan and decided to give Port Of Subs another chance. 

TIP- I am visiting Subway across the street or Firehouse Subs. The people are way nicer and pay attention to detail. Also if you are vegetarian you have to REQUEST to have the slicer cleaned if you are having cheese sliced. They slice meat on that same slicer and will not voluntarily clean unless you ask.

The sandwich was the best I have ever had, everything was super fresh. The girl making the sandwich today sneezed a couple of times in her arm and went in the back for something but then came back, washed her hands and put on new gloves. This kind of cleanliness is wonderful to see. Please be consistent like this ALL the time. Thank you!",G5aqrt4Mt-xqQXOwA0Uyxg,0,1,5,CmcqnGqMBKacftpPsO-Nlw

I use this location when I am at home and never had any problems walking in and getting my food fast.  Sometimes there is a line when its around lunch time but they are quick to make up what I want.  Everytime I walk in they always say hello and don't keep you waiting if your the only one there.  

Location nice and parking is easy since its a little further down from the grocery store so you can usually find a spot up front.",ip6IbczHeYOT9QVLaJVXkg,1,2,4,L6dBvqdsXMqvLRhW5lwjCg
