The place is nothing more than a tiny shack with a big light up screen on top of it, they have menus on both sides of the windows, one in english and one in spanish. 

They don't have a ton of variety, but everything is hand made, the tortillas are hand made, and mine were made to order.

The place wasn't really busy, which concerned me a little, but I thought I'd give it a try.

I ordered a Carne Asada Taco and a Taco Al Pastor. I was a little surprised when I got my order, all there was on my plate was 2 tortillas with some meat on them, no lettuce, no cheese, nothing.

They do have a small toppings bar next to the window that had 2 salsas and a guac sauce, limes, cabbage, and jalapenos, on it, but I'm not really a fan of any of them.

I squeezed some lime on to my meaty tortillas and gave them a try.

The Taco Al Pastor was pretty solid, the pork was cooked and seasoned well, but it was nothing special.

The Carne Asada Taco was rather disappointing, the beef was chewy and barely seasoned.

The tortillas were fresh and tasted pretty good, but I have to admit for $1.75 each I was expecting more than meat and a tortilla.

The only things saving this place from a 1 star review are the fact that the ladies were friendly, the food came out quick, and the al pastor was decent.

It will do in a pinch, but there are 3 other taco places within a block, so I'd say check them out first.

Oh and there are no tables or chairs or anywhere to sit, I had to sit in my car and eat my tacos",hyIVFPfm3TyPWQf0Xh9u1Q,4,3,2,HY-zHQ-VFzt5npdDvF1yWg

First up, Ricos Tacos...Handmade tortillas are always a plus, and we ended up ordering
Al Pastor,  Carne Asada , Enchiladas, and Flautas (yeah, I know I said TACOS)

Al Pastor had good flavor, but no pineapple...bummer

Asada, Enchilladas, and Flautas were decent...

Overall, good, but not good enough that I'd return...

They then expanded and have a full on taco stand going on now.  They still serve the hot dogs if that's what you're hungry for, but I've ditched them and am now turned on to the delicious Mexican food that is so good after you've had a few cocktails.

The quesadilla with carne asade is huge and they do not skimp on the cheese or the meat.  The meat is seasoned well.  I've also tried the carne asade burrito and the street style tacos, both of which were pretty good.

To be honest, I've only eaten here when I've been buzzed after some cocktails, and everything tastes good when you're buzzed.  But I can say that whenever I am feeling hungry after some late nights, I'll be the first to yell out, ""Let's go to the gas station taco stand!!!""  And that's where we always end up!",QPREECpJrp8Dj3_TK22oqg,0,0,4,a-9HVOf7bIgpg_xWvGKSwg

The area in the front was a  mess. No one had cleaned the condiment area for some time and it wasn't covered. I know in most Mexican restaurants have sneeze guards but this place doesn't have that nor do they have covers... A little bothering.

The tacos are TJ Style (Tijuana, Mexico) and the flavor was OK. It was nice to be able to eat something like this since the only TJ Style tacos I like are located in San Diego.

If we're driving by and I feel like having me some TJ style tacos, I'd take a make the visit.",77lef7kKkoOVupY-7AmieQ,0,0,3,028ZoMJ8d21jOn_1C5oYVg

Even when I was making money, I gave myself inexpensive dining treats to recharge my mental batteries.

At least every week, I thought about the tacos and yes, hot dogs I had from the taco trailer I used to see so many times on Sahara. I had to try it just out of curiosity.

The first time I went it was sunset, they forgot to turn the light sign on. I never even knew there was one. I was curious to the name, so I looked at the permit that confirmed what I called Senior Dogs even after I found out it's newer name. The sign that was lit every time after.

The cool thing was how everything pretty much was made to order, they maybe had some beef and chicken grilling in advance.

It was an easy walk from our apartment when I was home alone and wanted to go for a walk or think, which I did a lot. I worked in noisy environments. I often walked just for the peace of cars whirring by or to look at the crazy things that happen on Vegas streets.

Tacos Mexico is across the street, but I decided the trailer was a better option, then Los Tacos farther down the street if I was really hungry enough to finish a BFB. Big F-ing Burrito.

I used to sit on the cement barrier that faces the Herbs & Rye parking and stare at the awesome sunsets, cloudy and orangy. 

Working up hope was a constant exercise for me, that things would get better in looking for work.

One of those magical jobs was what I imagined, where people had ""fun"" and didn't suck the life out of you with office politics, enforced rules that didn't apply to the ""brown collar,"" and ungrateful employers and customers. A lot of people get paid on the strip to... play. Of course they shared another trait..

The sunlight was getting smaller as it sunk past the mountains and I enjoyed my soda. It was the only time I drank Coke, in a glass bottle, from the nice ladies in the Senior dogs trailer. 

I hoped so many times someone would give me a chance to make money and have fun doing it for once.",zulBnf95Ji1_LAcQKyhi8w,2,1,5,EKuR1e_o9nN72wqAngONFw
5199323,2010-07-13,3,XGCyy-JNA-nwO3T0lPth9w,"This little taco spot sits next to Herbs & Rye in the parking lot of an auto shop.  I have decided it is called Ricos Tacos simply because that shows up on their digital sign from time to time. ""Tortillas a mano"" also flashes across there, but I know this means handmade tortillas, so I am pretty sure that's not the name.

I have stopped there twice in the past year for some tacos. With that rate of visitation, I guess you can discern that I am not a super fan of the tacos. I am more of a fan in theory than in practice because I like the location and the atmosphere, but the tacos are middle of the road.

They used to have tables, but this past weekend, the tables were gone. That makes the atmosphere not as appealing. Call my urban crazy, but sitting in a parking lot actually appeals to me. 

The ladies who work there are super friendly. We asked the rather dumb question: ""What is a Quesotaco?"" So you avoid the same: It is any taco with cheese. I think it also means two tortillas. It costs .50 more. The standard taco is $1.50, which is reasonable, but not mind-blowing cheap.

As for the tacos, the tortillas are solid, although not as ""corny"" as I might like, but the meat quality and flavor are not special. The meat lacks that grilled flavor that really makes a taco pop. And, the do-it-yourself buffet style toppings are borderline unsanitary. Something about having them sitting out in the hot air with everyone touching them, including possibly flies, is not super appealing. Maybe, they should move them inside and do the toppings for you. 

Still, the sign says they are open until 2am, and the tacos aren't bad. If they bring back the tables, I could see myself landing there again just because...",qewG3X2O4X6JKskxyyqFwQ,8,7,3,H1GCR0nEz0t6b2Wxjzs4Og
