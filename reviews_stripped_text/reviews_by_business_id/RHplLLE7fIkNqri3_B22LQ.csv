1910753,2016-11-16,0,RHplLLE7fIkNqri3_B22LQ,My husband  and I must eat at this Subway at least 2-3x per week and we usually order the same thing every time.  Daisy always goes above and beyond with service and has our order memorized.  She is always very friendly and the store is clean.  Probably one of our favorite Subways in Vegas.  Will definitely keep coming back.,KEvupAO3AAscsCxrQ_NDVA,0,0,5,kx6cXagYGL5FbZ8210-sbQ

I go here frequently as it's by my house but out of the last four trips, they've been out of what I wanted to order three separate times. Come on, your Subway, IT'S WHAT YOU DO!",s2oh4aNQvQJfhGiNsQ55jw,1,0,1,VFnhuEpIhGsqh5aSmhJU4Q
