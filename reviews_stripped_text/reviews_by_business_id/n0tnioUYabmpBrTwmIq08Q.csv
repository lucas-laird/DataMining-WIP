Sherry the manager is great, Sara is awesome too, and today i met a trainee named Suhmer (summer, thats how she spells it..lol)...who was a doll...and i hope to see her again.  BUT, the new assistant manager who's name i think is Wesely (a woman) is not worth your time or,money .  She wont comp your drinks right if you put 100 in the machine she may comp you one draft beer...then charge you on any other beer..plus good luck getting good service from her...she just pays attention to her freinds and lets empty beer glasses sit in front of you while she talks .  Once she was holding my beer in her hand and talking up her friend while i was like...can i have my beer now please.   This bar would do much better if they got rid of her and hired Suhmer....Suhmers second day of training and is way better than Wesely...hands down",xBJo6if3S9zZtmLMBUBLPQ,0,0,1,o1bVfLsxuo3A908RBFh4IA

But it sucks even more that we paid $31 and change for less than mediocre food.  We ordered to go food last night.  We purchased a french dip, their November wing special and a club sandwich.  

First off the french dip was barely edible.  It had shredded beef and was over salted and way too much pepper.  That was my dinner.  My husband ate half and we threw half away.  The wings were breaded and fried and came with fries.  Pretty good deal for the price.  However hubby ordered plain with mild sauce on the side.  The wings, unsauced, were very spicy so just be aware. How is that even possible?  And the club sandwich was okay.  The bread was greasy from the cheese.  It's like they grilled the cheese and then added the cold meats.  The fries that came with the food were good.

The french dip was almost $12.00, the wings $7.00 and the club sandwich I think was around $10.00 or so.",Q2-_Zp-bzaJRBltMcj-foQ,0,0,2,VdNdbQCGjr05II11uwM5Eg

We had friends from another side of town come visit this bar because they have never done karaoke (Saturdays 11pm-2am) and this is usually a great place to do it. At around 11:30pm, we submit songs and order drinks. The bartending staff was a nightmare! Especially the red headed female that was working that night. She is by far the worst bartender I have ever dealt with. Perhaps, she was having a bad evening, but that does not excuse her eye rolling and laziness. It is because of her, that I will never return to this establishment.

Also, as far as karaoke goes, do not waste your time. While the DJ seems like a nice guy, he parades his buddies on the stage like it's some heavy metal sleepover. Very freighting to witness.

For 45 mins we waited for our food. Granted we asked for extra time to order but still 45 minutes & I'm not exaggerating this. We order an appetizer of ""mozzarella sticks""! Defiantly not mozzarella sticks more like triangles with more batter and oil than cheese!!! So gross! Then we order some nacho fries , chicken fried sandwich with no mayo and jalapeño sliders with no bacon . Well 45 minutes when we get our food it was cold as if it was waiting to be run forever. Makes sense since she disappeared. Then secondly the sliders with no bacon came with bacon and the chicken fried sandwich with no mayo had mayo on it! Talk about a server who can't listen and a cook who can't read a ticket! The server was 40% of the problem ... Every time I needed something she was no where to be found.

Besides the food and booze, they have a game area with 2 pool tables and some TV's that contain a number of games. Dont know what it actually is tho. I just know it's a touch screen and people play games on it and doesn't have anything to do with gambling.  If you wanna play some music there's a big jukebox where you can choose 2 songs per dollar and has it plays through out the bar.

Food:  Pizza was on happy hour so split one of those.  Was thin crust with a sweet sauce that tasted okay.  Also split an order of sweet potato fries.  They were also okay, but did not have much of a sweet potato taste.

Service:  There were two female bartenders. Our server/bartender was nice.  I think anytime you don't sit at the bar you risk slower service.  This was not the case really.

Price:  On happy hour pizza is 50% off which is great.  Not sure I would want to pay full price.

Until today we order an order of bourbon wings which came in a meal and a side order of fries to go. When my husband  brought the wings home and we started to eat I bit into one wing and it was gummy and smelled like they cook dirty chicken  in dirty grease. And I also noticed the wing was battered in flour and fried. So I immediately called the location on Ann road to explain to the lady Westley the situation with my food.she argued me on the phone not even listening to what the customer  was trying to express to her she displayed poor customer service and it seems like this is not the first time someone has reported her. So I told her I was on my way to show her how poorly her food was served to the customer. When I arrived I showed her how the chicken was battered and how pink and gummy the chicken was and she still argued with me and said she was calling the police and denied me my money back.

I came in with 2 guy friends. When we were approached by the waitress, I asked about their draft selection and she quickly looked over her shoulder to both taps and replied, ""honey, we have a ton.. What do you like?"" I found this unprofessional and a little rude. I asked for a suggestion, not a guessing game. 
THEN when she took the food order, she started with the guys first and tried to pick up my menu without even asking if I wanted anything. Like legit skipped over me and was about to run off to the next thing. Not okay. 
Our order had a few VERY SIMPLE modifications (tots instead of fries, extra lemon pepper for wings) and our order was incorrect when it came out. Rather than collecting the plates and fixing the mistake immediately, the waitress walked back and forth to the kitchen 3 times to ""check"" the order. Ridiculous. 
Also, we ordered fried pickles as an ""appetizer"" and she failed to let us know that they were out until she brought out the food. Shouldn't she have known that beforehand?? Did it take 50 minutes to figure out??? 
Overall, the food and experience was mediocre. I frequent PTs because it's close to home, has good happy hour & I like the pizza.

We had a school function at 5:30, so 3 of us went here for dinner beforehand.  Got there at 4:30 and were the ONLY people in the restaurant section (other patrons were just 2 people playing pool and 2 ladies at the bar drinking).  We looked at the menu and ordered at 4:40.  The waitress repeated the order to us and had everything correct.  That's when the problems started.  Here are my list of complaints:

1.) We ordered at 4:40, but did not get our food until 5:15.  Remember, we were the only people in the restaurant and we had to be back at school by 5:30.

2.) Because we had about 10 minutes to eat before we had to race back to school, we asked for the check right away.  The waitress disappeared with our cards until 5:25.

3.) While stuffing our food down our throats because it took 35 minutes to make 2 wraps and some sliders, we noticed many things wrong.  The french fries were burnt and hard.  My friend ordered a club wrap, but they sent out a bikini wrap.  We didn't have time to order another one and, oh yeah, our waitress hadn't returned still.

4.) She brings back the bill and my friend lets her know that the wrong food item was made for her.  The waitress says, ""Oh. Sorry.  I must have entered it wrong.""  and WALKED AWAY.  No offer to take it off the bill.

5.) They charged me $0.75 for my side of ranch to dip my burnt fries in.  Really?

6.) Waitress never checked on us or refilled our drinks.

Needless to say, the food was poorly prepared, service was nonexistant, our order was wrong, and they charge for ranch dressing.  We were also 10 minutes late getting back to our school.  I will never go here again.",QPREECpJrp8Dj3_TK22oqg,7,0,1,x4IaAvAySpAwKsRfVScusg

Sometimes my fellow patrons don't like my musical choices haha. Last night I had the craving for some food and thought about getting the almighty burger but opted for a healthier bikini wrap. It was stuffed with chicken and lettuce just the way I like it. I like the way they do their fries and I didn't even need ketchup.

Last night they even had karaoke which was a blast. Service was still good. I love when even though the bartender is busy they know how to keep on top of thing's. He would take orders and go in a counter clockwise motion checking up on everybody to see if they needed another drink or wanted some food.

I don't know if it's because this was one of my first bars that I love this place but it gets 4 stars from me for the good food and service.",1AYTQ-XpQwvbbShaXorsQA,0,0,4,SSF9adqyA5qz-Cwul1D8zg

I have been here a number times, mostly because it is close to home.  It is always dead in here and the few people that frequent here are chain smokers.  On the bright side, I usually get good service here and if your just drinking beer it is good enough.

I stopped by here for lunch and a few things rubbed me the wrong way.  I ordered the chicken club special and a bloody mary.  The bloody mary was $8.25.  Are well drinks in crappy local bars really 8.25?  The chicken club special was barely edible, I had to drink 3 glasses of water just to choke it down.  If you are going to offer a special - make it special or at least better than you average fare.  

Now here is what really pisses me off.  When I order the special, the waitress asked what I wanted for a side.  It was implied that a side order came with a sandwich and a sandwich usually comes with a side at all places like this.  Nobody said anything about a charge for fries or anything!  I get billed for the special and extra for the sides.  It is just a dirty trick.  The special turned out to be anything but special.  

A basic crappy bar lunch with one drink rings in at $37.  Really?  Then a tip and lunch for 2 people was over $40? 

NOTE to the owners of PT's:  You would be better off offering a better product at fair prices than trying to profit off every sandwich served.  You have about 25 tables in the restaurant part and I have never seen anyone sitting in there... and I can see why.",L15JCA18Ib_vMUVJILxiSw,11,1,1,3fmjdRGg0xx2xcoYQTBTpw
