Finally got to try the crawfish and they were the biggest I'd ever eaten. Amazing oysters too. We were fortunate to have come on a day when Lola made some special cobbler which was amazing even after stuffing ourselves with several menu items.

I don't know the exact size but I'm sure they are the least expensive, high count size at the butcher counter.  Our other friend who ordered the barbecue shrimp received five shrimp and they were only slightly larger than the ones in my gumbo. He looked at me and said ""I can't believe I'm paying three dollars per shrimp for this.""  My bowl of gumbo, my friend's bowl of gumbo, and my friend's barbecue shrimp were very disappointing.

Hostess proceeds to take us to a long table that had more chairs than what was needed. We asked the hostess if we could please be seated at a round table as requested. After 5 minutes they took us to a back room that had the round table. This room felt even warmer but we didn't want to leave since we were all hungry. The good thing is that they had fans. Ordered 3 cocktails and 3 waters and it took the waitress 10 + minutes to deliver the water and cocktails. To top it off she had to carry it all because she didn't know how to use a tray. I know they had tray's because I saw other staff using them. As for the food, it was not good. Maybe I should have waited for them to get the kinks out.

505903,2015-02-28,0,TT658qQinO6MBHP9q7rJ8w,"We have been a fan of Lola's since she opened her first place, and we always told everyone we knew they had to eat there. The food has always been excellent. The problem was that the charleston location is kinda small, and we are impulsive eaters. We rarely make reservations, and once she started getting busy they started requiring reservations. However, I don't think they ever handled reserving tables correctly, which discouraged us from going there as often. For us being comfortable is important to the enjoyment of the meal. There was more than one occasion we were told they only had the small, crowded bar table available. Even though the entire time we ate there were at least 5 tables that sat empty.

We were excited when Lola told us about her new location, it was near us and bigger, she assured us we wouldn't have these problems there. It turns out even in this larger place we have the same problems. We went in on a Saturday, we were asked if we had a reservation, we didn't. We were told it would it be 10-15 mins. We looked around they had about 10 open tables, so we asked not to be seated at one of their awkwardly long two tops, no problem. 40 mins later we were taken right past three regular sized tables to one of those two tops. When we asked for a different table the hostess hemmed and hawed, but then took us to one of the other tables. We were seated for about two minutes when the other hostess came over and told us we couldn't sit there. When asked why she said they like to reserve that table for people with disabilities, we apologized and said we didn't realize someone with a disability was waiting. She replied there wasn't anyone with a disability coming in. OK. So we pointed to another table in the back of the room, to which she replied, ""no you can't sit there either."" When pressed she refused to give a reason.

Like I stated earlier, for us being comfortable is as important as the food being good. If I am going to spend my money on a meal I want to enjoy it, and there are plenty of restaurants that want my money, and will treat me accordingly. This wasn't the first time the hostesses were less than polite. And we had mentioned it to Lola, which can only mean it is her policy.

The picture makes the bread look crusty and the expectation is that it has a little chew. The answer is no. It was like eating the sandwich with a dry sponge. :(. The gravy was also not warmed up enough as you can see in the picture and very much on the salty side. 

I also had their grits with Gouda cheese. It was good. A bit too cheesy for me... 

The sweet tea was awesome tho. !",RZ1Fq9AuQ0OkRdTzpr1NvA,0,0,2,2JfNhPSCqZvps8KirXvywQ

However, I have to admit I was slightly disappointed in Lola's. 
First we ordered the crawpuppies. They were just ok, you only get 4 TINY crawpuppies and they are definitely NOT worth the over $5.00 they charge for them. For my main course I ordered the red beans and rice. It was good, didn't knock my socks off, but decent. Not enough sausage, although I could have ordered, and been charged for, extra sausage.
The thing that really irritated me was when we asked for ONE extra side of ranch dressing (cups were tiny) for my kids chicken strips we were told there was a charge for the ranch. The server apologized and was clearly embarrassed to have to tell us that because we all looked at her like, ""you're kidding, right?"" Now, is 50 cents breaking us? No. However, it's the PRINCIPLE here. I felt like I was being nickled and dimed. Most McDonalds' don't even charge for an extra side of sauce!

Was excited to try this place as it is near home and somthing different from the chain restaurants.  We went in around 5:30 PM on Saturday night.  It did not appear very busy, with only one other party in the ""main"" dining room, a few full tables on the patio and some guests at the bar.  Nice re-decorating of the old Ruby Tuesday's.  The hostess walked us right by 10 or so four tops to a small two top - 
(we are not small people).   I asked to be seated at one of the larger tables and was told, they were all reserved.  When I said: ""Oh, really??"" while looking at the lobby and the room, she said OK, I guess I can make adjustments.  Please note that during our hour plus time there, only 4-5 other parties came in....did ALL those reservations cancel?  Our waitress did arrive quickly, and took our drink order ( just water).  My husband ordered the fried catffish platter and paid for the upgraded sides of grits and red beans and rice. I ordered the Roast Beef Du Bres sandwich with just the gravy.  While waiting my husband asked me ift we get rolls or bread, and I said I guess not?  It took some time for the order to arrive.  Hubby loved the catfish and the grits, but the portions were a bit small for the price.  My sandwich was disappointing.  It really had a bitter flavor and the gravy was lumpy.  It was like a pulled pot roast with no seasoning.  I guess all of the other mayo, mustard, etc. might make it better, but I always have my sandwiches/burgers plain - I can really taste the quality of the meat that way.  I got the fries as my side, they were luke warm and a bit limp. So I won't order this dish again, sorry Triple D - not as good as I thought it would be.   We decided to try the desserts which we rarely order dining out as we are usually way too full.  We  had the sweet potato pie and the bananas foster bread pudding.  It took about 15 minutes for it to arrive and both were disappointing.  The pie was hot with way too many pecans on top - it was flat and stringing, couldn't taste the crust.  We both had a couple of bites and then left it.  The menu did not state it was served warm - would not have ordered it.  The best thing about the bread pudding was the ice cream and brown sugar topping - I would order that alone. The three pieces of banana were hard and the bread pudding was more like a piece of stale banana bread and pretty bland. 

While eating we noticed all of the other tables were brought a bread basket, some even before they ordered.   Earlier I had asked our waitress for future reference if we had to order bread or did it come with the meal?  She said, it came with ""soupy dishes, like the gumbo"".  OK, so  why did others with just sandwiches and those who hadn't even ordered gotten bread baskets?  ( I also noticed other reviewers raved about the bread that was brought out right when they sat down.)  I know this seems like I am making a big deal out of it, but I think she just forgot to bring it- why not say so and offer it?  Between this and the hostess, it seemed like a lot of excuses, making the customer feel like they are asking for too much???
The tab was $50 for a meal and a sandwich and two desserts.  The one big thing missing was the ""hospitality"" piece that makes guests want to return.  Funny, that we found this Friday night at another new spot we tried - they acted like they really wanted us to be there and come back. We will try Lola's again, as I know any can all have an off day - and hubby loved the catfish.  Maybe this time, the ""missing"" pieces ( seating, bread, seasonings, hospitality) will be in place!  I really hope so, as I WANT to like this spot.",9H5kIOCt8b60_jk4EssALg,0,1,3,jL1J3xy3zt6udNc9V5L2IQ

The results were great-my hubby had the Bronzed Shrimp and gouda grits and I had the blackened catfish, homemade fries and greens. My husband raved about his meal and I enjoyed mine too. However, I am a collard green lover, so if you order the greens keep in mind that they are turnip and mustards and you must like those types of greens. HUGE upside-they have peppered vinegar, just like home!  

Try this place with an open mind. I will go back to try several other things. Unfortunately, I was too full to try dessert, but the banana's foster looked tasty!!!! 

I liked the available parking lot and the ability to eat outside on the cute little patio if you chose.  There were families and couples dining when we arrived and everyone was so friendly.

I asked them if they requested the bread and was told no! Still no bill no communication from the supervisor worst experience ever!! Waited so long some of our party got up and left....

1404953,2015-03-26,0,TT658qQinO6MBHP9q7rJ8w,"Confusion and mediocre food. The only saving grace was our server - Kindra.
Our visit was on Feb 26, 2015. We have been to the East Charleston several times and loved it. We were looking forward to visiting this location for some time. When our city councilman scheduled a meeting there it was the perfect opportunity to go. Arrived an hour before the meeting around 5 for an early dinner.

I told the hostess we were there for the meeting and dinner....confusion.  She  then escorted us to a nice long (high) table in the bar area and said 'They are going to meet here'. No menu's. A server stopped by and asked why we were sitting there so I pointed in the direction of the hostess.....still no menus. The bartender asked us what we would like to drink and recommended the Hurricane. Asked for a menu and did not get one...he also asked why were sitting there. Mind you the place is empty at this point. Now there is a major discussion amongst the troops. Finally our server brought our drinks and whaa -la...menu's. BTW the drinks were horrible @ $10 each. Not even close to Pat O'Briens.  I asked if we should move. ""No, No you guys are ok there.""

Next to visit our table was the bar manager asking the same question. Ugh. We about had it with all this confusion. We ordered; Craw puppies..they were rather bland but saved by the dipping sauce ($5.29), a crab cake appetizer which tasted like tuna...no chunks of crab ($6.99), and finally to complete the misery Jambalaya which was so dried out and gummy. I think it was leftover and warmed in a microwave ($10.29, plus $4.29 for three shrimp) The dish did have nice seasoning and chunks of sausage (not cajun) but rather dried out.

Now the place is filling up and four additional folks were seated at our table. Which was fun at first...until the (older) gentleman started complaining out loud that he got there an hour early to sit at 'this' table. The two ladies that he was with were rather embarrassed. Guess who stopped by next? Lola. She stood by our table and asked if we were going to be done soon as there was a large party scheduled. I mentioned what had happened earlier and that we were questioned about our location. I also stated that most restaurants have a staff pre-shift meeting to go over specials, parties, meetings....etc so at least her hostess would know what was going on. We then ajourned to the meeting room and had a nice time with our city councilman. 

Our server was fantastic and the only saving grace for the evening. She knew the menu and visited our table several times. I did mention the 'food' and she offered to adjust the bill but we declined and just recommended that she speak to the cook. 

The final masterstroke of confusion was this; By the front door was a chalkboard announcing that there was going to be a dinner with a wine pairing featuring Lohr wines for somewhere around $30/person. Nice. I asked Lola on the way out what was on the menu for the affair. She did not know.....""call back"". 

The place is big with a nice bar. There is a grill where the servers prepare the garlic toast. The meeting room is large with easy access to the bar and dining area. 
Overall it's a typical Summerlin/Sun City/Denny's kind of place with marginal food but great service.

Sorry...but this location does not hold a candle to the east Charleston eatery.
BTW...the 'large party' was Purdue alums there to watch a b-ball game. 
Sorry for the confusion.....",tIjhXTwrkDJCo070eUIuhA,2,0,2,MgvCgsfML2VI43A9wV0rPw

Unfortunately we did not feel the same way. The Gumbo reminded me of the beef gravy you get in a jar at the grocery store with 2 tiny shrimp thrown in. No chicken or sausage to be found.  My husband had the jambalaya with chicken and shrimp. It was mush. There were 3 shrimp and again we were hard pressed to find any chicken. Needless to say we both left without eating very much On a positive my husband did say he really liked their house made whisky and my sweet T was good.

1479628,2015-07-01,0,TT658qQinO6MBHP9q7rJ8w,"I love the feel of this restaurant and appreciate the Cajun recipe's by Beth. Just walking up to this restaurant is amazing with their wide variety of vegetables and herbs growing outside the restaurant doors.

My favorite item on the menu is the mushroom ragout Gouda Grits. Honestly, I could eat them with any item on the menu. I usually get them with the Bronzed Catfish or the Bronzed Shrimp. People who are not from the South might wince just a little at the thought of having this southern porridge. I know, I understand - I dined with someone who couldn't withhold his grimace that I ordered catfish or grits. In spite of this, I managed to talk him into a bit of my food and won him over on the entire meal combination. 

If you have never had grits, it is ground-corn porridge with Native American roots. Beth takes this Southern meal and adds her unique mixture of diverse elements that include mushrooms.

The draw backs of this restaurant are: The hostesses like to cram everyone in a central location unless you request the bar area, as they close down sections of the restaurant seating when it is not a busy day. This is not always a pleasant feeling for guest that would like some quiet time or want to have a conversation. I personally don't like to sit next to overly loud people, yet their central room has a huge family picnic style wooden table that divides this central dining room. It glows with lights from above and is usually occupied by a large party/family that have to yell to be heard from one end of the table to the other. When, I asked to be moved to another location when seated near this table - I was told the other room was closed. This did not make me happy. Thankfully, I was quickly accommodated by my amazing server Aaron. Good save.

The restaurant also charges a ""split plate fee"" of $5.00, which is tacky. I understand the business end and reasoning, but it's tacky to read on a menu and personally not a good way to win over a newbie customer. Thankfully, I didn't see that before enjoying a couple meals at Lola's.

With that said, you must try their Fig Delight for dessert and fresh brewed sweet tea with your meal!",jY1shXf_LQVhSoUyoXqQRQ,1,3,4,HjTzEpLUEKg5T5y2ALi6wg

I'm a cook and I make all of these items homemade with a certain approach at home and I must say I do an excellent job.. By the way my husband  ordered the spicy chicken wings..

Usually my experience at Lolas is ok nothing spectacular but today the energy was off. I asked for a table for 3 and the host asked if we'd like to sit at the bar, it wasn't busy so we did not understand why she asked that. That was odd. I told her no and we sat down in the dining area. We sat down a few minutes before 2 and by the time the waitress came it was 2 on the dot and unlimited mimosas were over. We didn't complain and ordered the mimosas a la carte. There was a mistake with the mimosa order and I joked with the girl who brought them out that she can give me two pineapple mimosas for the price of one after she insisted the order was correct,  and she returned a rude face and smart remark. The energy was so OFF in this place especially for it to be a non busy Sunday.

Christine W. and I were meeting up for dinner and decided on Lola's after reading the reviews. We made a reservation just to be on the safe side but when we walked in the place was virtually empty, we were seated in a matter of seconds so that was great.

Items Ordered:
Gumbo ($4.79)
Bronzed Shrimp and Grits ($16.99)
Bananas Foster ($7.99)

I started off with a cup of gumbo, it was very thick, hearty, and flavorful with a good amount of chicken, sausage, and shrimp. After finishing the gumbo I moved on to the shrimp and grits,it is definitely a must try, I really enjoyed it. I'm not a huge fan of grits but they really do know how to make them right here, they tasted like gritty mashed potatoes with cheese. We ended our meals with the bananas foster which was good but too bitter for my liking.

My boss grew up in Mississippi and one of the clients was from Louisiana, they both thought it was on spot and loved it.

I had mine with a coffee stout of some sort (sorry, bad with beer names) that worked perfect with the food.

I feel like jumped on plane right on to bourbon street. Just soaking all the finest things the Big Easy has too offer especially the FOOD! Lola she all about keeping too her creole background and sticking with traditional fare but doing it right way from family secrets passed on from one generation to the next. The original location I have been couple times always end up going with one of the Po-Boys. Too DIE for and the most legit ones find in Vegas hands down!! So hearing that they opened second location one much closer on my side of town. Excited! 

Second location sometimes have my doubts. I always think about ""is bigger always better"". You start to lose focus on the things that made you popular in the first place and consistency of the food more locations add. Lola not only small restaurant but great story (one that featured on triple DDD). I love seeing small business owners successful. Right off the top from the moment walked in the vibe, and everything about the interior design screams at you Big Easy. It has the old school colonial look all around, they have area that assume all clams or oysters on ice shuck fresh too order, the bar area think really nice with the brick back splash look to the many widescreen televisions around it, different chairs around the bar area from bar stools to chairs, piano in the bar area (I went for lunch no one playing but assume they do have live music), and NO doubt part of Lola personal taste not miss. She big Saints fan. Dah! You have big Drew Bree artwork. There this shelf near the bar but it feels more like bookshelf at home. Here you have the little things from the mardi gras masks, beads, jars of candy, and all these little almost personnel items. Just the patio area kind of small but had so much personality. They have big oak barrels around, plants, and not just tables outside in open space. Heck you even looking out through window out on the patio area. Just the theme throughout the restaurant got lot of personality but everything that great about the Big Easy. 

The food was awesome!!!! Like I said had my doubts. The Po-Boy went with the Roast Beef. The last time had the soft shell crab. I wanted to knock another one off the list. The bread with any sandwich make or break point for me. Po-Boy had so many imitations that once have the real thing never take step back. Lola is the only place get my Po-Boy on not place comes remotely close. Not just one thing but the BREAD really stands out for me. She gets it shipped in just for the sandwich. It not only the perfect compliment but could get bread all day long. The Roast Beef talk about lot of food. Messy. But nothing better then having the drippings from the beef, sauce, and some hot sauce icing on the cake. It finger licking good. I started with cup of gumbo. Perfect starter! Loved the fact both restaurant felt like the food was consistent. All the things that loved about the first one still are at the original and now the second location. Lola never meet owner that friendly, upbeat, and this passion for food not only saw on the show but in real life. She just happen be sitting at the bar area when I had lunch.

My boyfriend and I tried the crabcakes and a cup of gumbo all to share. The crabcakes were tasty with lots of lumps of crab. The gumbo however was very very good! I enjoyed the flavor a lot. They served it with the grilled garlic bread which I liked a lot. I really didn't want to share the gumbo with my bf because I could finish one by myself. 

For main dishes, I got the jambalaya and he got the catfish with green beans and potato salad. The jambalaya was really good and lots of andouille sausages which is so yummy!

I was really underwhelmed by their menu selection, but per the waitresses suggestion, I settled on the catfish and grits.

Not sure exactly what was going on, staff wise. We were starving and didn't receive any bread until our entrees came out (not that bread will make or break your experience, we were just hangry) and our drinks were slow to be refilled. We had to ask for utensils and napkins, but again that's just a nuisance, not a deal breaker! We ordered dessert- the banana bread pudding and the chocolate bread pudding. The banana bread pudding was great, but the chocolate bread pudding was just okay- the vanilla ice cream was the highlight of the dish (interpret that however you'd like).

The staff is as warm and friendly as the food is out of this world.  No matter WHAT it is you're getting, may I suggest one of the most heavenly side dishes you will ever eat...the Gouda Grits with the mushroom ragout.  Chef Lola was inspired by the divine when she whipped up that one.  It's not just good enough to spread onto a shoe and eat; I jokingly told her once that if I ever hit big money at one of the casinos, I want to fill up a bathtub with it and just dive in!!!

As for the other dishes, this is authentic Cajun/Creole-style cuisine.  I can remember having this kind of food when I was in 'Nawlins' last, so prepare yourself accordingly.  If you prefer your food on the milder, even blander side, this probably is NOT the place for you.  Though as far as my experience goes, nothing here is spicy enough to send you to the ER.  But this ain't bowls of Cream of Wheat, either. 

My typical meal there always starts with the Hot Crab and Artichoke dip.  Served with the freshly grilled Garlic Bread, the creamy, salty goodness of the Dip, with hearty chunks of lump crabmeat and tender artichoke pieces is hard to go wrong with. I usually pair that up with the spicy, savory Crawpuppies.  To be honest, dealing with the real 'crawdads' freaks me out more than a bit, so it's nice that they infused the sweet, briny meat into these perfect spheres that marry it with a really good hush puppy recipe, served with a tasty aioli dipping sauce. 

My favorite go-to for the 'Main Event' has become the boneless chicken breasts, which you can have one of four ways.  Mine is usually Blackened (with outrageous Cajun spices) or fried, with a choice of two sides. I would strongly suggest the aforementioned, nectar-of-the-gods Gouda grits, and the Low Country Greens, seasoned to a level that ALMOST rivals your Mama's. (And if it does, you already KNOW BETTER than to admit it!) The Country Potato Salad is also guaranteed to bring tears of joy to your eyes. But one of those two paired with any of the stunning veggie or french fry offerings will give you a tasty meal to remember.

And to insure that it stays in your memory banks for a good little while, save room - even if it means taking doggie bags with you - and go for one of Chef Lola's positively sinful desserts. 

I shouldn't - and won't - list the sins I might be willing to commit, for another taste of that Bananas Foster Bread pudding.  The Bananas Foster and the Bread Pudding, separately are enough to make your stomach do the happy dance.  But COMBINED? If they served it at a NATO ""peace summit"", who knows? We might actually HAVE world peace, and Lola would be up for a Nobel Prize! And don't forget to pair it with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. 

Running a close second to that is the Fig Delight, a sumptuous serving of sweet, baked bodaciousness that came THISclose to unseating the BFBP as the ruler of my heart. Also good with that ice cream.

To sum it up, one visit to Lola's will tell you why we, and so many other people, have become regulars.  Nobody else in the Valley or outside of it is doing food like this, and we wish for a long and happy run for this restaurant...and plan on continuing helping it along that journey!",_Mz4d66zzJUX830jTwCgIQ,3,1,5,HcOiH51v0myPRFSKPpQiyA

I got the blackened shrimp with Gouda grits and it was pretty good. The fried oysters were disgusting!!!!

I went during happy hour and took advantage of their discounted menu, opting for fried crawfish tails and grilled oysters. Sadly, the oysters weren't discounted. The fried crawfish tails were lackluster at best, tasting mostly of fried breading and something vaguely fishy. On par with your average fried shrimp from any fast food place. The grilled oysters that I had been craving were just as bad. They were tiny and overwhelmed by the garlic butter. For $25, I came away hungry and disappointed.

2979533,2016-06-11,0,TT658qQinO6MBHP9q7rJ8w,"My wife and I have started going to restaurant's we have never been to before and we rely on Yelp a lot for finding interesting and good places. Yesterday, Kathy and I, along with two friends, John and Amy, decided to try Lola's in Summerlin. None of us had been there before.

It seems that the Yelp reviews kind of ran the range but all I can say is maybe some of these reviewers were eating somewhere else and got confused. We found the service to be very attentive and friendly, as well as offering spot on recommendations concerning some of the dishes on the menu. I have to say kudos to Ashley who was our server. She did a wonderful job. And, Lola was actually in the house and took time to go to different diner's tables, including ours, to check on the food. Terrific job, Lola.

I was anxious to try the gumbo because I love gumbo and hadn't had good gumbo since the last time I was in New Orleans, some years ago. I ordered a cup to start my dinner. It was served piping hot over rice and was full of sausage and (one of my favs) okra, but all was blended into a dark, rich, thick stew that started with an awesome flavor I had experienced only in NOLA. Each bite left a slight but terrifically peppery finish. I'll be going back to have this for lunch very soon.

Kathy and I split the 'bronzed catfish' served with 'gouda grits'. The catfish was beautifully dark, without being 'blackened', spicy without requiring the fire department and moist. What was also nice was this was a thick, fat filet that served both of us and not those skinny flat pieces of catfish you see in so many restaurants that serve it.

Being a southern boy, I had no trouble deciding on the 'sweet potato pecan pie'. I was surprised at how large the piece was. I expected smaller. My first bite was heaven and each bite after the first confirmed my first impression. It was crunchy with the nuts and had a recognizable sweet potato undertaste. The best thing about it to me was that it was not cloyingly sweet and sticky, like regular pecan pie.

Needless to say, we will be going back here often since it isn't too far from home. We are anxious to try their special events, like the pre-Thanksgiving dinner, Sunday brunch and their barbeque.",ENcAGHpKz-37bObY4TVSkQ,1,1,5,wIzgZmhOsCAV1NjMe80puQ

The description read ""Oysters on the half shell, flame flavored with a lemon garlic butter marinade, topped with Pecorino Romano cheese. Sizzling in the half shell straight to your table"" but when we got them there was an unrecognizable taste that I didn't care for.  When the waitress came to take the plate away I asked her and she said that the marinade included their house dressing and I pointed out to her that the menu did not say anything about that.  Because we had eaten them they could not take it off the bill but they did offer to buy us dessert.  I just think that any item on a restaurant's menu needs to be described with everything that is included in the preparation. Thankfully we only ordered 1/2 dozen.

I do understand that the food might not be just like we would get in New Orleans, but was hoping for something close. Ordered cocktails, then appetizers. Wife got the crab cake and I got a cup of gumbo. The waitress then came back after a bit and we ordered dinner. Shrimp and grits and an oyster po boy. Waited a while and the food came before the appetizers. We told them that we didn't get our appetizers yet and then a guy walks up with the appetizers, but it wasn't our appetizers, wrong table. So, they wanted to leave the dinner and we said we would like to have the appetizers first. Then we were concerned our dinner would just sit in the kitchen and get cold. She assured my wife that ""it will be made again special, just for you"". So, they bring the correct appetizers out and the crab cake was ok. The gumbo was nothing close to a real gumbo. The flavor was all off and even the okra was CRUNCHY!! I'm not a chef, but I do know you have to cook the okra down. So, I added some seasoning and hot sauce and had just a couple of bites, and guess what? Our food comes out again!! So, we finished our appetizers and my wife bites into a shrimp and the food is cold. She sent it back and did not want it again. The oyster po boy was pretty bland, no seasoning and too much corn meal. However, the French Bread was good. So, we then order desert. Decide to go with bananas foster, which is pretty simple to make and can't really screw that up. Wrong!!! They put a raw banana in the sauce with ice cream. You are supposed to cook the banana a bit in the sauce. We cut into the banana and it was probably just peeled and put in. Then later, I got sick, just me, not my wife and had stomach issues until the next afternoon. Needless to say, we will never go back. I hope that someone from Lola's does read this and can address these issues. If you are going to represent being a New Orleans style restaurant, it should be.

When we got there, we were promptly seated in the back of the restaurant and our drink orders were taken.  My wife god a Sweat Tea and I got a water.  My wife is a connoisseur of Sweet Tea and she was extremely happy with the taste.  It was perfect, she didn't have to add any additional sweetener to it.

As an appetizer, we both got a Bowl of Gumbo and a Crab cake.  Crab cake was good.  I don't really like crab cakes but this one was okay.

The Gumbo was delicious!  I liked the melody of meats contained therein.  One thing we both noticed that was it very salty.  Almost instantly our heads started to pound, so we both started drinking more to offset the affects of sodium.

I was feeling fine after a few minutes and my wife didn't finish her gumbo.  What did I do?  Yep.  I ate hers too. It was soooo good!  But my head almost instantly started pounding again.  So I finished off my second glass of water.

Refills here were super quick, even though we were seated in the back.  These servers have hawk eyes and it's much appreciated!

For a main course my wife ordered the Catfish.  I ordered the Salmon Grilled with Fries and the Vegetables.

Food took a little while to get out, but we were busy with our appetizers and the free bread that they brought out.  The bread was nicely toasted and had a nice buttery flavor to it.

When our main courses arrived, my wife instantly loved her catfish.  I tried some as well and it was pretty good.  

My plate was grilled salmon with fries and veggies.  The salmon portion was pretty generous.  It was perfectly grilled. Not too dry.  The fries were OH EM GEE good! I have a secret (not now so) love for potatoes and it did not disappoint.  Nice, hot and crispy with the right amount of seasoning.  I almost felt guilty dipping them in ketchup.   The veggies on my plate were an assortment of onions, peppers and mushrooms in some sort of oil.  It was good. I ate it all it was so good!

We were stuffed, we couldn't possibly eat anymore.  So what did we do?  We got dessert! :)

My wife got Bananas Fosters and I got the Chocolate cake with ice cream.  Her Bananas Fosters once again impressed her and I got a bite of it as well.  It was very pleasant and sweet.

Both have great atmosphere and good servers but the food is why I go (and I often get ""food to go"").  My favorite is probably the house salad (actually called ""Signature Orange Bowl Salad""). I usually get it with the grilled chicken. Great proportions so that each bite has most of all the ingredients (dried cranberries, orange segments, lettuce, candied almonds, good house vinaigrette, celery, and that grilled chicken - might be missing some ingredients but you get the picture). YUM - literally delicious and nutritious.  I also love their hamburgers (fully dressed of course) with fries. Good heavens those fries are good and the hamburger is juicy and well seasoned - simply tastes great! My husband loves their chicken strips and the house-made ranch dressing is outstanding. I also absolutely love the chargrilled oysters - and that bread to sop up all the juices. An amazing dish - just a great mix of flavors. Their desserts are great too (chocolate cake or banana foster/bread pudding are my favorites - both moist and full of flavor and I usually share (but sometimes we each get our own chocolate cake (and comes with delicious vanilla ice-cream).

That's what I did, so Earl and I dine here on a Friday.  The price per pound of crawfish is $10.99.  I ordered 2lbs for myself and Earl ordered the catfish plate with garden veggies, sweet potato fries, an gouda grits.

Each lb of crawfish comes with a potato and a corn on a cob.  Since it is still the beginning of the crawfish season, they are still small in size.  So yes, it's more work to peel each one, but the meat is still sweet and full of flavor.  It got a bit salty for me so I had to eat it with a bite of potato/corn on the cob to balance out the saltiness.  I also had the delicious sweet tea with my meal...I had to.  2lb of crawfish was enough for me.  

While I was still finishing up my pail of crawfish, Earl ordered the Fig newton with butter pecan ice cream.  I took a bite of his dessert and I halted my consumption of crawfish to ensure I get my share of this delectable dessert.  It was so good!

First, I must say... My server was a man completely void of joy or personality or any kind of zest for ""seize the day"". No expression. Nada. 

I got the crab and artichoke dip first. Delicious but soooooo greasy. There was a whole layer of oil on the bottom of the dish. Jeez. Well, I ate it anyway. Put a ton of hot sauce on it too. 

Next, I ordered blackened chicken and a side of seasonal veggies and a salad with balsamic. My server, of course, the conversationalist he was, didn't tell me that their balsamic is basically oil, sugar and herbs. Tasty but super sweet and not what I wanted. The chicken was great, juicy and a little spicy. I added a ton of hot sauce (love it) and the veggies were sautéed well but again, sooooooooo oily. Mother of God. Heavy hand in the kitchen. It was basically swimming in oil. Too much for me. I ate them anyway. 

Shrimp Creole was the last dish. Pretty tasty but I am pretty sure the shrimp is farm raised because, o boy, do your hands smell like shrimp butt if you choose to pick them up without a fork!! Gross. But the tomato stew was great with a nice strong creole kick. 

It's good stuff, I love it, but a suggestion or two.. Pride yourselves with Wild caught seafood and ease up on so much oil. No need to drown sautéed veggies in all of that grease.

Dinner: OK. We first started in the bar area because it looked cozy so we sat there, they checked our IDs and my friend was searching for her in her purse.

I went back to eat at the bar on Friday.  It was early and it was packed.   One bartender was clearly having his bad day but Adam was a rock star.  I just wanted a beer but everything that is popular now is kind of ""yucky"" by my standards.  They popped one open for me and it fit ""yucky"" and poured me another I liked.  I would have paid for the one wasted but there was no disagreement, attitude or anything but ""let's find one you like""  POOF. It appeared.

I had the shrimp and grits.  Normally I am the slowest eater on earth.  Not only did I snarf it up in an unlady like fashion... but if I was at home I would have licked the plate.  The shrimp wasn't the star of the dish.  The gouda grits with the sausage and sauce... one word... OINK!

The new location just doesn't have the right kind of funk for Cajun.  I wish they could do something to the outside.  They are trying on the inside but it still doesn't reek Cajun to me.  What WAS appropriately funky was the pianist that started at about...uhm... 6pm? (early by live music standards)  I loved everything he played and how he played it.

I sat next to a regular who clearly knew the servers and the menu inside and out.  She was very helpful.  As she waived and talked to other people I realized a good portion of the crowd were regulars.  That's always a good thing.

My only complaint is the bar stools were heavy.  They don't swivel and they were tight next to each other getting in and out was hard.  That was minor.  There were some lower tables and chairs in the bar area close to the piano.  I'm definitely going back for the music and food on another weekend.

So when a business trip brought me to Las Vegas, I was excited to see if this innovative city could produce some authentic creole cuisine.

Service: the hostess was a little bit dry, but everyone else was very friendly and attentive.

Ambience: nice, calm at 11:30am, fleur de lis and other New Orleans inspired decor all around. 

We ordered the catfish and shrimp platter with softshell crab with coleslaw and sweet potato fries on the side, along with a cup of gumbo and crawpuppies as appetizers. The waiter assured us that most of their seafood is sourced from the New Orleans area. When the food arrived, I found that the fry batter wasn't particularly flavorful and the catfish was watery. The crawpuppies were good with remoulade sauce, but it would have been nice to see plain hush puppies on the menu. The gumbo was decent, but not as complex as other gumbo I've had in New Orleans. Halfway through the meal, we were brought a crab cake, which had a wonderful crab flavor and was one of the highlights of the meal, along with the sweetened iced tea - no gritty sugar packet required. 

Overall, this is a nice place to eat, but the food is not the best New Orleans style cuisine you'll ever have.",a7sx-5AFHUENv5A33HGnhg,0,0,4,AJvjE1jCKI27jumOvZTmOQ

I was seated promptly and was brought iced tea by a server.  Then I was left to peruse the menu.  Another server came along and asked if my order had been taken and when I said it hadn't, that server took the order.  It was short--a cup of gumbo for an appetizer and the crawfish étouffée.

Then there was a wait for the soup to be brought which was delivered by the original server.  I had not half finished the soup when the same server brought my main course--one of the things I find most disconcerting about restaurants.  The server said something along the lines about being sorry this came out so fast.  Is that OK?  No it's not, but I took the dish.  There was one other table occupied in the dining room and you can't get the courses evened out?

The soup and the étouffée were very good.  There was some Louisiana brand hot sauce on the table that said, ""One drop does it.""  No it doesn't.  I shook several good squirts and it still wasn't spicy hot but was better.  That has nothing to do with Lola's but Louisiana brand hot sauce would be my last choice in the future.

The étouffée was made with a rich brown roux and had some kick to it, enough that I didn't bother to ask for a different hot sauce.  I enjoyed it the way it was.  There was a good amount of crawfish.  Server 1 also brought me some more bread, thin slices, grilled a brief bit and nicely crisp.

For dessert, I ordered the sweet potato pecan pie with a dip of butter pecan ice cream.  The pie was very good.  It had a very soft texture from the potato and was not a custard-like pie as a pumpkin pie would be.  Very different and very good.

I've been meaning to go to Lola's for awhile but the Charleston location just isn't convenient. We drove to the new Summerlin location as the first Friday crowd packed the Charleston location with a 30-45 minute wait as told to us by the hostess. Since Vegas is small the drive wasn't long.

This location is really cute. Who ever did the decorating did a good job. It looked very comfortable, random (in a good way), and not tacky. We sat outside even though it was cold and they had heaters on to help.

I always like to try a variety of things the first time I visit a new place so that I know what to order next time.. If there is a next time.

We got a few appetizers to share: gumbo cup $6, crawpuppies $6, and crab and artichoke dip $10. I'm 99% sure the prices are accurate. I thought these prices were fair for the taste, portions, and quality except the crawpuppies.

As in not from the south I am no gumbo expert but theirs is probably the best I've had. My friends dipped the bread that came with the crab dip into it and really loved it. The crab dip had a lot of real lump crab meat in it and onions. It was good with the toasted bread. The crawpuppies were good but only came with four small balls. It's literally fried dough! I guess the craw fish in them is what makes the serving four.

I got the platter for $25. It came with fried cat fish, 2 fried oysters, 2 fried shrimp, one crab cake, and 2 sides. I was pretty full after our appetizers so idk if that's why I didn't enjoy my food so much, but I was a little disappointed in what I ordered. I'm not sure if the crab cake was the same as the appetizer one or the dinner one but it wasn't as good of a crab cake as I hoped for. Definitely average. They may have just over mixed it but it was a lot of filler. The one in the picture on the menu had big chunks of lump crab meat in it. The portion of cat fish was generous and it tasted good. The fried oysters were good and so were the shrimp. My friends both got bronzed catfish with Gouda grits and the sausage and mushroom ragout.

The last two things I got were the Gouda grits with sausage and mushroom ragout and then the bacon seasoned green beans. I really liked the grits dish. It wasn't life changing but it was good. The ragout really made it as plain Gouda grits would have been lame. The bacon seasoned green beans were over cooked and mushy.

My main gripes were the service and experience. The outside seating area sucked as people stood by smoking at times, the service was slow, and the chairs sucked. It took a long time to get our order taken.. The food was good but not good enough for me to want to go back soon. I think our server was alone so it was not good being seated outside. Overall I was a little disappointed and underwhelmed with the food after getting my hopes up seeing it on tv and them doing well enough to get a second location. I would go back but not anytime soon.

After looking at other's photos I believe we may have went on an off night as our servings of bronzed catfish were significantly less than the photos I've seen.",pZ6P_1V-bTSoYG1fg1TXzw,1,1,3,YtftlH0oClhyuBXQKyrDrg

If you've been to the location off Charleston near the Smith Center, then you know what to expect here and that's good grubbin' Nawlins' style.  Unlike the original location out here, this one has more space, doesn't seem to be as busy, and is a lot cleaner.  That being said, I'm still a fan of the original.  However, if I have choice, I'd make my way here when I'm craving the authentic stuff from Louisiana.  We dined on a mid-week night and it was far from busy.  Our servers were pretty good too.  But let's discuss what's really important and that's the food.  I got their the crab cake and their Bronzed Shrimp & Grits.  This was my first time trying their crab cake and it's huge, a creamy for a crab cake, and packed with flavorful crab.  As for their, Bronzed Shrimp & Grits, still as good as it get.  You get huge pieces of shrimp on top of their grits, sausage, and mushrooms.  This was seasoned just right and you can't go wrong with this dish.  In fact, this is the only entree that I have ever ordered when I dined at the original location.  I guess I should be try something different like their Po-Boys, the chicken & waffles, their jambalaya, or their oysters the next time I'm in.

Had I only been to Sunday brunch, I would have knocked a star off because the menu is limited (discovering right before going in the menu online and having my pick ready to go before finding that out).  

My first visit, I had a crab cake appetizer (which was very tasty) and chicken wings  - they asked me what level of heat starting with 5 and going way up from there.  I said a ""6"" and the things nearly burned my lips off but they had really good flavor.

My next visit, I had the bronzed shrimp and grits.  Fantastic flavor but damn spicy!  About mid way through, the spice again started to make me uncomfy.  I should mention I have had grits before and these were the best I have had.  Maybe it was in combo with the sauce which contained andouille sausage - which was nice too, but they were cheesy and tasty.

The staff was friendly and attentive and the atmosphere nice and ""New Orleansy"".

Once we order we were so excited, we're going to New Orleans this summer so coming here was a must. My friend ordered gumbo my other friend ordered red beans and rice and I ordered fettuccine with chicken. First off I want to say that the chicken was so well cooked and seasoned I wanted more. They brought out bread and it was delicious. We all decided to split out the males because they're very big in proportion. I had a little bit of theirs and I might add on that I'm not a big fan of a lot of brown spices. So I wasn't really able to enjoy their dish but I did love mine.

Being a Sunday, the restaurant offered unlimited brunch mimosas, a brunch menu and beignets. Unfortunately they ran out of fresh crawfish.

I inquired what was popular and my friendly waitress suggested the Drew Brees po boy sandwich - in addition, we had a order of jambalaya and beignets for dessert. Overall, the food was solid and satisfied my Cajun craving.

I enjoyed the atmosphere of this location over the original not to mention this is spacious inside even at the tables in the bar. I'd recommend Lola's if you're in the mood for some southern hospitality.",o4tYl3Hz0oDfpNn4k02DCw,39,32,4,wKN1gdmBg5XnykDpZN2i0Q

We were told we could sit anywhere in the bar area, so we sat at the bar and were greeted instantly by the bartender, Dominic. He was great. Very personable. He let me sample a few of their beers before I found the one that was right for me. 

We ordered our meals, I had the Roast Beef Po'Boy and my wife ordered Fried Chicken, side of Greens and fries. Everything was delicious.

Came here on a Sunday evening-- glad to know this location remains open versus the one in Downtown which seems to be closed on Sundays. 

Made reservations which, while there was a few open tables, it was definitely still busy.

Ordered the following: 
-Grilled Garlic Bread (definitely recommend-- the char paired with the garlic and crunch was delicious)

-Appetizer Bowl of Gumbo (enough to share with my husband-- great for warming up your appetite and to get a nice taste of their gumbo without being full for dinner)

-Catfish and Grits (DEELICIOUS!)

-Roast Beef Po'Boy (SO SO GOOD! Might not be your typical fried seafood po-boy but the mix of meat, bread, and dressings was so flavorful. The gravy was the best part-- especially sopping it up with your fries. Can get a little messy but don't be afraid to lick your fingers!)

-Bananas Fosters Bread Pudding (Perfect for sharing-- hearty, warm, and a great ending to the meal)

Generally I can't do spicy (hot sauces, sriracha, etc.) but the way this food is made is a good spice that brings a nice warmth of flavor to your mouth. We will definitely be coming back... hopefully to try their brunch!

The catfish is great not too much of a fishy flavor just the right amount of seasoning. The shrimp is grilled perfectly not over cooked. 
For appetizers we ordered the pull n peel shrimp basically shrimp cocktail. They were huge and super juicy! We also ordered the Crawpuppies. They were amazing, just like mini crab cakes. For dessert we had the sweet potato beignets. Baked to a perfection sprinkled w/powdered sugar.

+ Ettouffe: Kind of like gumbo (little kick of spice) with a scoop of white rice in the middle. You can choose shrimp or crawfish or a combination. 
+ Side of sweet potato fries: I couldn't stop eating these. Soft on the inside yet perfectly crispy on the outside. It's a big portion perfect to share.

So I went back a few weeks later and they still have issues with the A/C. Service was better but not what it should be. We asked for bread and it did not come until nearly the end of our meal. Eek!
Had the crab cake again...I really liked it. My husband thought it was so-so. The shrimp and grits were amazing.

For dessert we ordered the Lolas bread pudding. Well that one was a disappointment. It was warm in the outside and cold in the inside. There was really nothing special to it.
As I mentioned before the food was good but the service was horrible. It took 35 minutes to get our appetizer! At that point they should have brought us bread or something to entertain ourself. Then we asked for cocktail sauce and that arrived 10 minutes later. And to top it off it took about 15 minutes to get a dessert that of-course is already made! Hopefully they work on it because with that service not even good food is worth it.",wtNopFY2ybprzk4FuEbWJQ,5,4,3,isRRudQR2kENZPgEbJEODg

WE DID.
My husband and I have been frequenting Lola's since they opened their summerlin location, casually making our way through their entire menu, sampling their specials, enjoying their friendly staff, and maybe more than enjoying a beverage or two. Not once have we been disappointed by the food or service, and every time we leave it's with smiles on our faces. 
When we decided to get married and skip the whole ""big wedding"" thing. We wanted something small, just us, our parents, my kids, in a place that meant something to us. And that was Lola's. Their patio is beautiful, we all fit at the big table, we all ate whatever we wanted. Everyone raves about how good the food was, and how wonderful it was for us to be able to share that moment with friends and family. 
Obviously I recommend it for date nights, family dinners, st. Patrick's day celebrations, birthdays, anything. Go there. Eat anything and everything. Drink drinks, watch a game, enjoy live music.

4742769,2016-01-17,3,TT658qQinO6MBHP9q7rJ8w,"1,822 miles north west of the French Quarter of New Orleans, and in the middle of desert mountains might not be where you would expect to find an authentic Cajun-creole meal. That's exactly what they serve up at Lola's of Las Vegas- southern hospitality included. 

Once you pass through the the glass doors you are greeted by an ornate fleur-de-lis and drawn in further by the savory aroma of Cajun blackened dishes and distinct creole spices.  Subconsciously you (along with the other patrons patiently waiting for a table) start licking your lips in anticipation.  For those visitors seeking just drinks or don't mind sharing a table, Lola's offers a full bar along with a beer-hall-style long-table immediately upon entry. 

For Lola's 2nd location in The greater Las Vegas area the atmosphere and decor modestly highlights some stereotypes of NOLA but doesn't overdue it with kitschy stuff thrown on the walls. Instead, the cuisine is allowed to dominate your experience and memories. 

The menu offers a hearty blend of Traditional Cajun dishes and classic creole fare from fried oysters to gumbo to etouffee to jambalaya and beyond. Staying true to The Big Easy; the selection of fish dishes are plenty and how you want your fish prepared keeps Lola's authenticity pure. 

For those who seek out new dishes and enjoys discovering flavors this place offers a whole new worlds while keeping you comfortable in knowing familiar choices are ready for plating. 

This food doesn't disappoint at all.  Rich in spice, alive with freshness and packed full of authenticity.  This food is so authentic New Orleans my father ( who was born and raised in just outside of NOLA in Bogalusa) became full of nostalgic feelings of his grandmother's cooking as he savored bite after bite. He especially recommends the red beans and I the Etouffee!  

The staff is very attentive and offers great descriptions of any dish that you might not be familiar with- without making you feel foolish for asking.  For me, at the end of my meal, my plate was licked clean,  my stomach was full of great foot and my mind full of new knowledge. I'm ready for my next Cajun meal. 

Overall, if you're in Vegas looking for something you won't see on Iron Chef and if you want great food that leaves a lasting impression, get your belly to Lola's.  It's a Mardi Gras for your mouth!",1b5ghutIrDsrAcpKs1b6NQ,3,2,4,Qtr9xrgGFd1x22bJDpll0w

Positives:  The restaurant was very clean and the staff was very attentive and friendly. They had live entertainment which was also very nice. The fried puppies appetizer came hot and fresh and I thought  they were a great concept. They made a good Moscow Mule and had some interesting beers on tap, including a beer only made in the Louisiana.

Negatives: I got the chicken and sausage jambalaya. I was enjoying it very much, until I bit into a piece of chicken. The chicken had that awful flavor that it gets when it sits in the refrigerator too long. The chicken definitely was not freshly made. This was very off putting. Also the garlic bread barely had a char on it. It tasted like buttered bread.",ObQl16Vuc4sHPGKtzSGNUw,4,2,2,nKiA1GvlVZGE_KBcMNVadQ
4793605,2015-03-04,1,TT658qQinO6MBHP9q7rJ8w,"Had dinner at this lovely place this past weekend while on a trip to Vegas with the boo thang. We were meeting one of his friends for dinner who recommended Lola's and cited it as one of her favorite places to eat. I've never truly indulged in Creole cuisine so I was really looking forward to eating here after reading some of the Yelp reviews. For me- it didn't disappoint. We arrived to Vegas on Thurs night- around 6:30p...by the time we got dressed for dinner, picked up his friend and arrived at Lola's it was around 8:20 pm and the restaurant closes at 9 pm on this particular night. 

We were greeted promptly by the hostess and our server gave great recommendations on food and drinks. We ordered cocktails but the star of the night for me was the cuisine. For myself, I ordered the ""Bronzed Catfish"" dish (catfish over cheesy grits w/andouille sausage and a mushroom ragout).  My BF ordered the jambalaya and his friend- the gumbo (both which were served over rice). 

Our food arrived in a timely manner and I have to say I was satisfied. The portion size was plentiful- it came with four catfish fillets over a nice mound of grits. Now I will admit- I'm usually the first person to grab or ask for salt to season my food (old habit) but my BF always gives me the side eye so that I taste my food first. :)  The first bite of grits had me smitten- I love cheese and Gouda didn't disappoint. Between the grits and the sausage/mushroom ragout- the entire dish held so much flavor it needed no additional seasoning whatsoever.  Sold! 

Now my BF and his friend didn't quite feel the same about their dishes. My BF had never eaten at this restaurant but has had jambalaya before- he said the first couple of bites were really good but the overall dish was just ""alright"" in his opinion. No further elaboration given. His friend said the same about her gumbo- ""just alright"". Since she frequents this establishment- her offering of why the dish was just okay was that perhaps the chef rushed in preparing our dishes since we had arrived so close to closing time. It's possible- but I'm happy that I was satisfied with my dish. Enough so that the next time I'm in Vegas/Summerlin- I'll try it out again....only in the afternoon this time. :) 

Oh and I did hear that brunch on Sundays is a must try! My recommendation is to try this place out...... #happyeating",jEYEJI_9PrU9u-CR-JHM5A,1,1,4,JPEKDXNrBVlB-VESl91jog

I will definitely go back and try something different next time maybe jambalaya.  I really enjoyed the New Orleans atmosphere there .

The other location was never an easy option to get to so when looking for a fun place to eat I was excited to see this was here .

My rating is solely based on the food because I believe service can't ruin an amazing food experience .. but our server Emily didn't even introduce herself plus she got our drinks mixed up which is a problem since my mother and I both had surgery that makes us sensitive to sugar and dumping . Plus before we even realized the drinks were wrong she brought my children's drinks in adult cups and made me feel terrible for asking for cups with lids my son is only seven and my daughter is ten but with special needs (not visible ) but I didn't even feel right having her switch her drink just had to be a drink monitor 

Not only did Emily not apologize for mixing diet and regular but I legit had to ask if she wasn't comfy serving us . Then she just stated she felt like she poisoned us and very clearly it just wasn't a match .

When I return I will make sure not to have her serve me .

I accidently made the reservation thru yelp and I don't know if she treated us this way due to that or she just did not like us but definitely a coaching experience is here to have her be a little more friendly. The food however made up for it .. I saw how Emily treated her other guests and she just wasn't friendly with us which definitely on a tab that is $100 with tip kind of sucks.



I ordered two appetizers and a bread basket to start. 

The garlic bread is so delicious but there are so many better ways to fill up your tummy unless your starving id probably skip it.

Next up was the crab cake and crawpuppies both were super delicious and had the balance of flavors I look for in soul food .

I ordered the fried oyster platter and southern beans with bacon and potato salad and it's huge I couldn't finish it all after sampling my family's food but it's so good.. the oysters were fried to perfection and great quality ..

My sons burger was just a party with cheese since he's young but man it was juicy and home made and I even liked it (I don't love beef much ) but this was a win .. which my son eating makes it worth coming here 

My daughter got shrimp charlotte which tasted just like the menu states 

My mom got the roast beef po boy named after Bree's and honestly it was super delicious too

We will definitely be back to try a bunch of other stuff especially dessert .. looks like they do some fun brunch options ..

I'll just be sure to make sure I don't get Emily and hope I get good service otherwise I will be back to update my review but the FOOD is so good..

If you haven't been to either Lola's, you're missing out. I feel as though this place is a staple for Las Vegas. There aren't many Lousiana style food restaurants here. But this one takes the cake. 

This location, I prefer. Mostly because they have more options for alcohol, bigger, nicer and they have a live pianist that plays on Wednesday's and Friday's. You best believe I'll be going there for that. We were warned that Friday is usually packed though. 

The bartender, Dominic Trupiano was awesome. You can tell he loves what he does, and he's very good at it. He was super friendly and quick to serve. He also was extremely knowladgable in his liquor, so it was nice to have someone be able to pick something we'd really like. He had be try Haig scotch -- because I like more of the floral notes. It was excellent. And it's David Beckham's scotch. Nice work, Beckham. 

For dinner we had:

-Shared Cesar Salad. Always excellent. 
-Their amazing crab cake appetizer. This is one of my, if not favorite thing here. It's always crispy on the outside, and packed full of crab. This is hard to find with crabcakes. They're usually filled with other things, such as corn meal or breading so they don't have to use as much crab. Lola says, ""No""...apparently. 
-Shrimp Creole. Man oh man, was this good. I hadn't tried this yet. It was so spicy (which I loved because I've been sick) and full of peppered flavor I loved it. The only thing I don't love is the pre-cooked rice. I don't know if this is a Lousiana thing. I'm assuming it is because I've been to Lousiana a few times and a ton of places there used pre-cooked rice. Being Asian, it's one thing I will always stand against. But, the dish was still excellent. 
-Bronzed Shrimp & Grits. If you didn't know, these grits are with gouda cheese. Which happens to be MY FAVORITE cheese in the world. These are the best damn grits I've had in my life. This is one of their best dishes, and it's very easy to taste/smell why.

Owned by Lola Elizabeth Pokorny, with one successful spot already located downtown, Lola's: A Louisiana Kitchen in Summerlin opened without much fanfare amidst the hubbub surrounding the 'new' Downtown, but with the mall mobbed by crowds a short drive up Town Center Drive found Ms. Pokorny's renovated space to be a pleasant experience - the truncated and unannounced 'weekend brunch' menu aside.  Apparently once a Ruby Tuesday, with a sunny patio offering an al fresco option to those not sold on modest Mardi Gras décor, our party of three was sat quickly at a cozy four-top and with the dining room mostly empty while the bar bustled with football our service could not have been better, a duo of young ladies eager to answer questions and seek feedback while beverages remained brimming.   Happily conversing beneath upbeat Cajun instrumentals it would not be long after ordering that the first round of food would arrive and although beignets were a bit too 'bready' while Leidenheimer French Toast proved overpriced and underwhelming compared to the restaurant's signature bread pudding both the supple cinnamon roll and spicy sausage were excellent, the later a recurring theme in round two.  Admittedly a bit disappointed in the lack of oysters on the brunch menu, but soon to find solace in items offered as ""signatures,"" it was with two plates of creamy gouda grits that the meal moved on and with the stick-a-spoon-up-straight base punched up by rich mushroom gravy and snappy Andouille both the shrimp and flaky fish equally shined, an order of chicken and waffles entirely forgettable in the face of such greatness as I mopped the bowls clean with complimentary grilled bread loaded with garlic.  At last arriving at dessert, the full menu offered in addition to two specials, it seemed only proper to select the items designated as Lola's signatures and although the soft chocolate cake was light yet intense while the hybrid pie was truly a 'best of both worlds' amalgam of sweet and savory neither could compare to the bread pudding - a steamy block of custard teaming with cinnamon beneath praline crunch and brown sugar sauce tinged with rum.

Long lamented for being a cookie-cutter planned community where PF Changs and Olive Garden continue to generate long lines, Lola's is a welcome addition to the area and the sort of place I can only hope continues to proliferate West as ""Downtown Summerlin"" develops.  Obviously new and still finding its footing, particularly with regard to a 'brunch' menu that seems muddled and poorly conceptualized in its lack of NOLA favorites like oysters or crawfish, I look forward to seeing how the restaurant evolves over time and only hope that the unwieldy location does not prove too daunting for those preferring to stick to the same ol' same ol' spots further south.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,8,2,3,nQSDTOiK58MD-cJH15SEbQ

Their gumbo is tasty, as is their seafood. I tried their crawfish etouffee, and they definitely know their stuff for this selection. The missus got the blackened fish with grits, and that's definitely prepared Southern style.

The atmosphere is nice, the servers were friendly, and the drinks were strong. I had a Bloody Mary, and the missus had a Blood and Sand. I was definitely cozy post-meal.

However, with two babies in tow and knowing space is limited...Summerlin location is the best fit for those who have stroller aged children.

It was rather slow when we arrived. I clenched my butt as it was Father's Day and I was expecting chaos and a wait. But just as I told my husband on the way...nobody gives a shiz balls about Father's Day. Lol. We had reservations and so we were immediately seated. Probably because it was slow. The hostess was very welcoming and pleasant. 

I can only offer a 3 star rating because for one, I'm allergic to shellfish. Gumbo, and all that you come for gets thrown out the window. So, I opted for the blackened salmon with green beans and rice. It was literally a 2 star dish to me because my blackened fish, personally, was overcooked. Nothing exciting about it all. I mean, twas salmon. Tis all. 

I didn't expect my green beans to be like mush. It was like collard greens, bit made out of green beans. Perhaps I'm not as thoroughly familiar with southern food as I thought...but I really disliked the mushy green beans. Though, I ate the thing anyway because Iz wuz hungray. 

The husband ordered a small cup of their gumbo and had their jambalaya. He's such a whore to such dishes.  I was hoping he'd ooh and aah and spice up my yelp review, but as much gumbo and jambalayas he's had...no oohs and aahs. He said they weren't bad. Just alright. Okay, if his fatass says just alright, then it's just alright. On a sidenote, he also had his eyes glued to the start of the game 7 nba finals so maybe he wasn't fully being one with his dish. BUT! BUT! If it was something that locked his jaw out of goodness, no NBA game could.prevent that. So I'll have to have faith in his just alright.

I thought they'd bring out bread or something as you wait...I even thought they'd give bread with their gumbo or something, everything we ordered was literal. No garnishments to make it look fancy. No side pieces for flavor enhancement. You order the fish, you get the fish. While delicious food should not need fancy garnishments or bread to.scrape.your soups with...the fish would've tasted alot better had it had a lemon near it or something. I literally thought, I could've did this shhh...myself. 

We also ordered their fries which came out last! Seriously. There was a whiny baby with us who clearly NEEDED his fries because his life and mother's sanity depended on it. Hahaha. Their fries were pretty interesting though as there were different sizes of fries. There were thin and thick cuts and I feel like not having the monotony of same size cuts of potatoes is what made the fries. Weren't bad at all.

Our server wasn't bad. He just gave off this I'm a new guy vibe so he seemed timid? Hesistant? Not sure. We asked for a high chair but my husband ended up grabbing one ourselves because our waiter clearly forgot. I think he was the bartender as well? Either way he served his purpose. Good enough. 

Overall, we spent 50 bucks on 2 alcohol beverages, fries, cup of gumbo, jambalaya, and salmon. It wasnt a complete satisfying-rub-my-belly-wholly-crap that was awesome 50 bucks, but we went out...we ate...it wasnt busy...staff was nice...they had the game on...we had a nice time anyway, so mission accomplished. 

Would be come back? Perhaps. Wouldn't go out of our way and probably wouldn't be on our list of ""we should go to........""  I will note that the front of their restaurant is their garden so it's nice to see fresh tomatoes growing knowing they're self-sustaining to a certain degree.

Definitely kid friendly. Highchairs with working buckles, yay! Certainly stroller friendly if it isn't busy in there. If you need a southern fix that's not some.hole.in the wall...I'd recommend them.",MC0aQHT7mQ1WJknOD6u8pg,6,3,3,DrNApTfKNrwoqXP1Ip-fSA

We came in around 5pm which was during their happy hour and though we wanted to order from their menu (drinks are half off) they didn't allow us to order if we ate at the dining area which was a bummer so we didn't end up getting anything off their HH menu. I don't understand why it was an issue to order at the bar and just drink the drinks at our table but we just went with it. 

We went for the gumbo, crab cake, and the étouffée with half crawfish and half shrimp. 

Gumbo: 2/5 - felt like I was just eating soup from a can and I barely tasted any shrimp at all.

Crab cake: 4/5 - probably the best thing we ate out of all of the food but the portion was very small, not shareable at all.

Étouffée: 3/5 - very bland. We had to add salt but it barely helped. The shrimp was good but definitely wasn't satisfying at all.

We started with charbroiled oysters. It was very good. Esp if you like parmesan cheese. We wanted to relive our meal at Drago's in NOLA. But it was too charred. Left on the grill a little too long I think.

For main entree, the hubby and I shared a jambalaya and the bronzed shrimp and grits. Sooooo gooooood! Very good flavor and perfect spice level.

Overall, great lunch!",n28qz1Lt9ROormO7eCooOg,0,0,4,PTzJulrLVgMTfwTAu7GhEA

It's a bigger restaurant with a large bar area as well as an outdoor patio.  Located on Town Center Drive near Summerlin Parkway, this Lola's sits behind the Sinclair gas station.   I don't remember if there was ever a restaurant there, but it's definitely a nice space.  We came for an early dinner on Wednesday around 5:30pm and the bar, complete with 3 flat-screen TVs, was busy with happy hour patrons.  We sat in the large dining area where there were two other parties present.  The décor has the New Orleans theme, with plenty of fleur de lis and Mardi Gras masks on the walls.  The menu is the same as the original location's, with dishes such as gumbo, jambalaya, crab cakes, po'boys, shrimp creole, and oysters available.  Dessert items include bread pudding and Bananas Foster.  
I had the jambalaya with shrimp.  The shrimp were large and grilled just right.  The jambalaya had a nice little kick to it, but was not overly spicy.  I ate a lot of the boyfriend's grits from his shrimp and grits order since they were nice and buttery.  We had good service from our waiter the whole time.  My only gripe is that I wish they'd serve some bread; give us some carbs while we're waiting for our food, y'all. I just love bread, though.  Other than that, we had a good experience and will come back since it's more convenient at this location.  Also, there's a lot more on the menu I want to try next time, including the dessert.

The restaurant is located in Summerlin, a nice town just outside of Vegas.  The ambulance was laid back and the music was fantastic for a sleepy Tuesday night.  Lola, the owner, was present and greeting each guest as she made everyone feel welcome.  The bartender seemed to call ever patron by name and even had their drink orders memorized...

I had the catfish and grits and the pecan pie for desert.  They were both excellent choices.  Full of flavor and pleasing to the eye.  I will most certainly be back whenever I'm in Vegas",Hwner06VFlYnnjbRt_1Zhg,1,0,5,hu76QbXndD2Do0Q37JvzzA

The service was mediocre, we sat in the bar so I didn't have super high expectations on that front.  The crab cake was pretty marginal.  There was more cake than crab and seriously... squirting mayo on as a garnish is something I would expect to see at Red Lobster (not that I have ever eaten there) not a garnish I would expect from someone that calls themselves a ""chef"".  This appetizer was served on a small saucer barely large enough to hold the crab cake so that each time I tried to take a bite the sad looking leaves of spinach (not bed of mixed greens) slid on to the table.  The gumbo was a salty cup of brown sludge which was mostly rice and somewhat grainy.  The sweet potato fries were dry.  The bronzed catfish & grits presentation left a lot to be desired.  On a positive note the fig delight was indeed just that, a delight.  We got out for $170 with tip for 4 people.  When considering this included 2 HH drinks and only 3 entrees and factoring in the quality of the food this didn't feel like a good value.",is-3bMF-WGLiU2t6AxEp6Q,0,0,2,jn0Ps0Xa_PY5OokB5F17Tg
5688113,2018-05-23,0,TT658qQinO6MBHP9q7rJ8w,"I had the sample platter I think with catfish and shrimp and crab cake. 

Ok so the crab cake - I felt like saying ""Can I have some crab with this stuffing "" 

This is crab cake made with a stuffing and it just is not tasty to me at all. It was mushy and the flavor was not great. I felt like I was eating a stuffing patty with crab mixed into it. Overly stuffing. 

The fry on the catfish and the fried shrimp was On point perfection.  

Now I am a salt sensitive human I detest overly salted anything. 

That being said the catfish and seasonal vegetables had Zero salt or flavor. Like add some salt. 

My brother had the Shrimp Creole it was tasty. 

Coming from a family of fine diners and my brother being an executive chef formerly of Rosemary's who had the best food in town I can't say this is the best I've had because it is not. 

I've given it a higher review then my pallet would normally suggest because instead of now basing my review off of just the food or just the server I'm going off of my whole experience. 

Here are some negative remarks 

1. Why are you in the edge of summerlin with a restaurant setting yet not 1 manager came to our table to greet us or to see how things were going. If you want to charge people the finer dining prices or the lower end of that, then you should probably practice the art of fine dining in your restaurant. 

It's dark there , there's no real flow to a theme just Knick knacks everywhere which the eclectic is fine however not 1 personality or any brightness of cheer in human form exists in this facility. 

It would be so cool to see people happy to see other people and not just working and doing their jobs. Tell some of those men to tuck in their shirts as well. 

2. When people order salads etc and a server suggests something they should probably describe in detail what it is they are suggesting. I like the house vinaigrette did not let me know this vinaigrette is overly sweet and packed with about every herb you can imagine giving it no real direction as far as flavor is concerned. 

3. I even saw the owner there and she did not make eye contact she did not say hello or anything. Very rude and very uninviting. I own a few businesses and never would I not say hi or anything to anyone contributing to my success. Ever just horribly rude. 

Positive Notes : 

1. The server was very polite and she was attentive. 

2. The food didn't take forever to make. 

3. Even though the catfish lacked salt the fry on it was impeccable and the quality of the fish and shrimp was magnifique. 

4. The Veranda looks quite lovely  

Honestly I can't say much more. There are too many things I found mediocre. 

I'm sure if the manager had greeted the table considering there were only 5-7 tables filled that afternoon that would have raised it another star for me. 

If you want to be in the restaurant biz have hospitality in every aspect with every employee. I couldn't even tell which was the manager apart from everyone else.",I-A5Ho70uwJWZWiZRgnNmg,2,0,3,Q_5_YlqUSiTkjow_t0eZUw

Let me tell you, the Ragu that comes with the Gouda Grits was the start of the show! The shrimp and Jambalaya were great but, the Ragu & Grits... Oh boy! With the bread!!! Yes!!!

No dessert for us but we'll be back for sure.

The food not so much. They advettise lump blue crab cakes on their menu, but they served us salmon croquet. The gumbo was thick, too thick and desperately needed some fi'le. Then the waitresses accidently spilled water on one of our guest wetting him and his bowl of greens. (By the way the vegtables and fish were also bland). Instead of offering compensation they OVERCHANGED him for the meal and explained that complications with their register prevented them from doing a price adjustment. On top of that she took it upon herself to include a 20% gratuity to his bill. The nerve!

5737997,2014-12-24,3,TT658qQinO6MBHP9q7rJ8w,"Wow...... and that is NOT in a good way. We attended a birthday dinner for 8 last night. Walked in to pleasant surroundings that are mildly reminiscent of New Orleans. Sadly, that was the last positive thing I have to say about Lola's. The joint was dead at 6:30 which seemed like a big ol' warning sign. But hey...it's almost Christmas so maybe?

Service was friendly but amazingly slowwwwww. I ask the server for suggestions on the menu and he did my big no-no....""EVERYTHING"" he says.  Come on dude, there are better items that you can suggest instead of letting a new customer throw out a line hoping they are going to find the big one!  I also wonder if they were trying to emulate their idea of the big easy with this ""going in reverse"" kind of service. If so, it ain't workin'. Odd that you sit around a dead restaurant twiddling your thumbs with absolutely nothing to nibble on. Oh well....maybe the dinner will make up for this. NOT!

Dinners arrived with absolutely no mapping by the server so the expediter is wandering around the table asking where each (different) dish went. The funniest part of this was that some of the dishes had the wrong sides so nobody knew what was really their dinner. That is where the entertainment ended. 

We had a very eclectic array of dishes and NOT one of them was up to par so let me point out the worst of the bad. Crab cakes....They looked so promising. They arrived looking like a crab cake should but when I/we took a bite they were absolutely mush.....not cooked through and not warm all the way through. EEW!  I NEVER send food back but this was a food poisoning in the making. Sure enough....the crab pinched at my queasy stomach all night. The other guests said their crab cakes were mushy but they ate them anyway....... out of shear desperation for food I suppose. Wonder how they did last night? The shrimp on my grits was tiny and tough. My hubby's catfish was mush. Looking around the table, not one thing looked good. In fact, no one said a word out of politeness but it was apparent this was a huge disappointment for everyone. Jeez...eight bad dishes. Well...I guess Lola's is consistent and NOT in a good way.

Almost forgot to mention. We brought a birthday cake and they wanted $1. a slice to cut it. I brought all the equipment, plates etc. so I cut it FOR FREE. God knows a dead restaurant with bad service doesn't want to cut a small cake. To top it off, they served the worst coffee ever. (dessert) I was expecting a lovely blend of chicory and french roast but instead they served a watery substance that they called coffee (thinking swamp water)  in the tiniest cups with no refills. What a joke!!

Commander's Palace....you got nothin' to worry 'bout........and my prediction is Lola's Summerlin will not be around long. My predictions have been spot on so far but I will eat my words if they are a resounding success. BTW... my words are tastier.",Q3Y0AjsTpuJuQ-TWZOlVzg,9,1,1,oRnJczqZRGxPRZ1pL3gHhw

As she's from Georgia I thought Lola's might be a good choice. This was based on reading on line reviews and two recommendations from friends, not personal experience.
The look of the place is NOLA authentic. We were seated at a nice table in the large dining area but could still enjoy the live music from the bar area. The menu is pretty varies. Between the three of us we had the gumbo, hot wings and fries and the golden shrimp and grits. The shrimp dish was pictured on the menu and in my experience that is a good sign; I was correct. The gumbo was very good, the hot wings were crisp on the outside but juicy on the inside. The choice of sauces range from 1 5 which is a little hot to a 10 which is omg serious heat. The shrimp were delicious and the grits with the mushroom and sausage ragout were spectacular. Had we not had a freshly baled pecan pie at home waiting for us I would have tried the bread pudding. Something for next time.
Lola, the owner, was there and making the rounds to the tables in play.
