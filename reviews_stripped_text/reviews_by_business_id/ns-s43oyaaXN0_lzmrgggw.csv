The white walls and elegant chandeliers are completely breathtaking. I have visited the space a couple times, for the grand opening and most recently their famous Bagatelle brunch. The atmosphere and entertainment is unlike anything that I have seen in Las Vegas. As far as the food and cocktails, everything was AMAZING! I especially love the beef tartare, seared scallops, truffled chicken and the nutella french toast during brunch. I am usually not a huge fan or ordering chicken at a restaurant but Bagatelle's is quite delicious and a must order. They have a great selection of specialty cocktails - but I just don't feel right ordering anything but champagne! Overall, I highly recommend this place - it's the perfect place to eat, drink and later party the night away.",0D1M0DGivjiS_22LjwdtPw,2,2,4,mGCXGeF6oFQ55ae-Zf0CIA

There was also a Cirque-style performance troop there, complete with a man on stilts with a feather duster that snuck up on us a few times. One of the performers went around table to table doing card tricks and made a card that I had placed back into the deck appear in my hand out of thin air! Not sure how they do it, but we were all beyond entertained.",IiItHD3g9XoaTBHcb17lQw,1,1,5,Mcxq7Ogn9zBUdo7OmFs1cg

612180,2012-12-12,1,ns-s43oyaaXN0_lzmrgggw,"I have been to Bagatelle twice. The first time was their Grand Opening on Halloween.  Some friends and I decided to check out this new spot at the Tropicana. Their parking lot and valet services are both great and make it an easy place to get into (a nice change from all other strip restaurants and clubs!). Bagatelle is beautiful and the venue was packed. I felt like I was in Miami. Everyone in the club and at the bars and dance floor were having a great time. The guests dining also seemed to be enjoying themselves.  I only stayed for a short while on Halloween but knew that it was a place that I wanted to go back to and tell people about. I luckily was invited by a friend a week later to a Friends & Family dinner they were having. Dinner was wonderful. The bread and butter presentation was one of my favorite things. I have never had such a delicious butter at any restaurant. We shared tuna tartare, scallops, chicken, and the truffle mashed potatoes. The food was fantastic. The service exceeded my expectations. Our server was very experienced, professional, and made our experience even more fun.  We ended the evening with pumpkin creme brulee which was made to perfection. I highly recommend Bagatelle to anyone looking for a great restaurant/ club. I cannot wait to see what Bagatelle will offer this summer! I took a sneak peak outside and it looks gorgeous....",Za-oLIgSPooxAOH2P0JQVQ,3,1,4,JkerBd08p0VKA1fQP34beg

1023092,2013-02-05,1,ns-s43oyaaXN0_lzmrgggw,"This review is based on the infamous Ladies Night on Thursdays. I was invited by a friend who had a friend as a promoter like the last two girls did. However, we did not receive special attention really. 

The night consists of the appetizer which was this pretty good bread with a ricotta spread. My second favorite thing of the courses. 

Next was the salad, which was just spinach leaves and vinegar dressing. Not something I would eat because it was a little too boring for me. 

Than came the entree of green beans, mash potatoes (the had some other fancy name), and then a dish of steak and fish. Salmon I think. I do not eat fish, but my friends said it was not cooked or something. They love fish and couldn't even eat it. The steak was really and my favorite of the whole night was the mash potatoes. Those were good. 

Finally was the dessert which was creme brulee, which was awful. They burnt the brown sugar on stop of it. It was hard and nasty. The rest of it just was not good at all to me. 

I like the atmosphere of the place, but the sound is terrible. I could not hear my friends, who were sitting right next to me. The band was good, but it was way too loud. I am yelling at people just to have a conversation. I hate that in a place. I get if its a club or some place that is suppose to be loud, but when it not it is just unnecessary. 

The staff was good. They refilled our drinks when needed, gave me a new napkin cloth after ever course, and made sure we were doing good. 

Overall, I just was not impressed. Maybe if I go on a different night than ladies night, but I think it would be too expensive for my taste anyway.",ufn1IPTJP7mRlmQP3a5dIQ,2,1,2,x10CE0_i9F2OObM03Iwi4w

Its transformation from an upscale dinner to a night of dancing seems all too convenient, favorable to ladies like me who loves wearing 7-inch heels. Food can be competitive in terms of helping, a balance of good food in precise amount. I am petite and slim and the food did not satisfy me (Salmon and Steak), however the mashed potatoes are amazing, and I am not a potato lover. The team in bagatelle is very professional and very helpful, a smile though can add more spice in their most attractive uniform, the manager/s I appreciate the courtesy of saying hello and having a conversation, it adds humanity and comfort-ability, an added value that other restaurants seems to forget especially  in a place where you just got acquainted to. I understand the transition of the music as it gets louder as the night progress; it makes sense as after dinner there is dancing! The music selection is carefully selected as well in the transition and it complements the scene. I would go back!",1xte8xMzhMZPXcmdZ-98dg,0,0,4,TxD3SfZF4JMAV0FZ0Yy7Fg
1480200,2013-04-23,2,ns-s43oyaaXN0_lzmrgggw,"I had purchased a Travelzoo Champagne Brunch voucher for two and expected to dine inside at the restaurant.  Much to our surprise the inside had closed permanently just two weeks prior and our only dining option was outside next to the pool. 
I was already irritated that there is no entrance from the casino, so after walking clear around the Tropicana building in 90 degree sun, I was treated like I was entering a nightclub, ID checked, bag checked, unfriendly bouncers (for brunch I might add).  
So, starting off on a negative tone certainly did not help our experience.  The loud club music was not exactly what I expected either - understood it was a party brunch but this was like Tryst or XS at night kind of loud.  There will be no talking over brunch as you could not even hear yourself think.
The hostess asked us if we wanted a table with a view (of quite a colorful crowd I might add in the pool) we opted to skip the view!
The food was just ok.  Nothing to write home about. 
Crowd dining in close proximity seemed to be in the same boat as us, a little myffed about the indoors being closed.  From the pictures it looked very elegant so I was very disappointed to have missed that, plus we did not exactly prepare for dining al fresco and the sun was pretty toasty. 
No misters on, no fans on (despite my request), so we were so ready to get out of there.  
The grand finale was the check - I had already paid $69 for the voucher on travelzoo, which I thought was a fairly good deal - a pastry basket, one appetizer, two entrees and a glass of champagne each, however when I got my check it was $70+, for taxes on food, mandatory gratuity, $16 for two extra glasses of mediocre champagne and average at best atmosphere.  So all in all for $140 total I would pick 100 other places to go for brunch than Bagatelle.  We definitely will not be back and I give this place 90 days at most before they shut down.  
The pool was not busy either (about 150 ppl max there out of capacity of 3000) for a Sunday and near perfect Vegas weather.
Our waiter was nice enough and extremely apologetic and for that I give this place two stars.",4EiFaBpiifBhGbPwQ7O-bg,4,2,2,QwdgayHPVCBEREz-8uF2nw

A huge thank you to Melanie and One Group for comping us ladies a delicious meal! 

4 heavenly courses. I will upload some pics. Our meal included:

-many glasses of champagne and red wine
-crudites
-white truffle mac & cheese
-green salad
-chicken breast
-seared salmon
-rib eye
-giant ice cream sundae in a martini glass with a Sin City Cupcake on top

My favorite bites were the mac & cheese and salmon and of course dessert!

The space is so beautiful, all white decor, multi-levels and a DJ...yes I am describing a restaurant. The vibe here is varied: it can be relaxed for an intimate dinner or more rowdy for a larger group, especially during Sunday Funday brunch! 

Everything about Bagatelle screams 5 stars, but the only portion I don't like is that it is housed at Tropicana. Luckily, Bagatelle has its OWN valet, so you don't have to go through the Trop or its casino. Perfect. Going back this weekend!",haSh72Q0MsQZUpWPeVgp0Q,3,5,5,Aq732ODJJ9PGpY9MpCwEMg
1721275,2013-02-11,4,ns-s43oyaaXN0_lzmrgggw,"Came for brunch at noon on a Sunday. Not completely sure I was at a restaurant or a bordello.  This place is all about the scene and being seen rather than food...even during the daytime.  

If you want your hangover extended or if your Saturday night was not long enough, this is the Brunch place for you. Obscenely loud music, skimpily dress women or men in drag (I can't tell the difference) dancing on the ledges while eating your bacon and eggs and sipping coffee and Bloody Mary.  Not my cup of tea, but certainly entertaining to some.

Surprisingly the waiters/waitresses were all very polite and attentive, and got our orders correct and continually filled our drinks.  The Bagatelle eggs were decent, maybe even above par, but my husband's croque madame was like a dry ham and cheese sandwich. The bread was unbuttered and over toasted, the fried egg was not oozy, and the ""truffle"" bechamel sauce was lacking, which is why it was dry.  The basic Moet I can find at CVS for $8.00/bottle was going for $16.00/glass, again it is all apart of attracting 21 year olds to spend like older sophisticated rich kids with money to burn on ordinary alcohol and ok food. 

One unacceptable observations was the multiple holes in the ""leather""  dining benches. If Bagatelle just opened in 11/2012 then I would expect the upholstery to be in fairly good condition just 3 months later whether this restaurant was refurbished or not.  Could it be the ""wild"" crazy drunk girls stepping on the leather/pleather benches with their stiletto heels to dance on the ledge?  Yeah, not my type of place, especially for brunch. 

Too bad this place caters perfectly to the barely legal vacationing young that really don't have the money for this but are on vacation and will spend because they won't be back anytime soon.  A scene in which to be seen, but lacking true substance to last.",ejBGQeL177ECBqgMXe7sdg,5,2,2,2VLrwetR0SFKLC3Y5-5f1g

3. black truffle flatbread
4. black truffle roasted chicken
5. black truffle french fries
6. black truffle mashed potatoes

I did like the cheese plate and foie gras appetizer.  The king crab salad which I was really excited to have was $29 and a major let down.  It was very small and had a minimal amount of king crab for the price of this salad.  Had the Chateaubriand to share and it was good.

Save your money...and if you are getting comps here, save your time, effort, and hearing and go someplace else!  Bought a travelzoo voucher, and made a reservation two weeks ahead of time.  Two days before arrival, message on cell phone to please reconfirm.  Did this.  Day of res (and also day we were arriving by air) message on voicemail - ""our last seating is at 430P.  Your reservation is at 5P, so we won't be able to serve you unless you arrive by 430.  OK, so we rushed and went straight over.  At the hostess stand, they were clueless and didn't understand the message we received, saying 5 would have been fine, but hey, you're here.  Got an attitude about the voucher.....hey, if you don't want to give discounts, FINE, but don't penalize your customers for taking you up on an offer you put out there.  There are 6 different entrees on the menu....the two we ordered....waiter came back 15 minutes after we placed an order to say they were out of both.  One was a burger, the other the salmon.  Out of the 4 remaining items, the only one we were interested in was the steak, but of course that wasn't included with the voucher offer.   So we ended up sharing the steak entree, instead of having two separate dinners, to avoid paying more of the exorbitant prices.  What I feel grant as good: the bread basket - very tasty.  The salad we shared: endive, very fresh, although the dressing was overpowered by vinegar.  The steak and fries: steak was delicious, the fries would have been average, but were served cold, so not good at all.  The server was told they were cold, nodded and left - we assumed he would bring warm fries but never did.  Although, I have to say...did he even hear us??  He gave a thumbs up and outstretched hands at one point, as if to say ""everything OK?"" Yes, the music is that loud.  I'm with an earlier reviewer....if you're in a club, great.  If you are trying to share a meal and talk to each other, and communicate with the servers...it's WAY too loud.  And stupid - they had a DJ, he was playing good music, and it would have been great at 1/2 the decibel level.   It was very unpleasant at the level they had.  The dancers, costumes, show - I can see where it is not for everyone, we would have found it very enjoyable if the music hadn't been so horribly loud.    
Over all, a HUGE waste of money - even with the discounted voucher.  Don't bother with this place!!!!",d2GwUQABe-iIMLr1VgGdew,0,0,1,O9MLYJRjWA5kjTeEmMDv4g

It's eight of us girls. We are seated at a round table and two of us decide to go to the bar to get some drinks. We asked if they still do the first round of drinks for free? He said Yes. So we got eight delicious shots and back to our table to down them. 
Our server delivered drinks to the other girls while we were gone and then I ordered a drink and he promptly delivered them. 
Dinner service started... Bagatelle salad - pretty much giant lettuce leaves with some type of vinaigrette. Flank steak and salmon for entrees and mashed potatoes and hericot verts for sides. So there are eight of us girls, and for the flank steak and the salmon, there are four pieces each. So we all just split everything... This was my first time here for comp dinner but someone within our group had been here several times before and said the had always gotten A LOT more food than what we had just been served. It was all GOOD though, tasty, but I could have had more! We did have a vegetarian among us though and the chef did accommodate her and brought out a vegetarian risotto dish that was pretty freakin' good too! 
Oh and of course I checked in on YELP and a check in offer popped up for a free glass of bubbly! I asked our server Martin about it and he said he would ask his manager. Griffin came over and I showed him the check in and asked him if he would honor that? I know we are getting a comp'd dinner, but it doesn't hurt to ask! He was very nice and said that was cool and then we all got a glass of the bubbles!
For dessert we had little tiny creme brulees. Not very much flavor involved, and I think they torched the tops of them a little too much but whatever - we scarfed those down. 
Time to check out with our server and head to Ellis Island....
The bill comes and it is $89. Apparently there was some misunderstanding about drinks... We had ordered those shots from the bar and I guess the bartender had transferred those over to our tab and then we had ordered a round of drinks but thought our server had said those were comp'd but only the shots got comp'd. It's not that we didn't want to pay for drinks or anything, it's just that when you think something is taken care of and then it ISN'T we're like WTF??? Not a big deal anyway, we paid and hooked our server up and then we on our merry little ways to... Ellis Island!

2991795,2013-02-01,0,ns-s43oyaaXN0_lzmrgggw,"A friend of mine is a promoter for this place, so when she offered a free 3 course dinner I was in! The deal was free for ladies, and $34.99 for men. This included a salad with butter lettuce, parm chz, and a very unique house dressing. A skirt steak and salmon with sides of mash n green beans. Then finish with a mini creme brûlée. I am super weary about pre-fix menus anywhere. I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of the food. My only real complaint is that I asked for lemons 3 times before they were brought. The salmon was 10x better with em. This place is considered a supper club and I was not quite sure what that entailed. There was a DJ spinning dance classics from all eras. As well as a fashion show that looked like it was straight out Madonna's closet. From burlesque to 80's hooker. There was a singer who was a mix of Nora Jones and Amy Winehouse. She was decent. The overall ambiance and setting was beautiful and entertaining. 
However there is a con, my ""free dinner"" ended up being almost $300. We were offered a free drink. Well we had a party of 6 and only got 5 comp drinks. And they were only good for wells, so all the cool classic cocktails they offer like the amazing jalapeño cucumber mint martini- AINT free. My reservation was at 9. And I was also given 2-4-1 drink tix. Couldn't use those either cuz they are only valid til 10. AND I wasn't able to use my free champagne with check in for whatever reason. BASICALLY there is no way you're getting FREE dinner and drinks. I really liked this place. I wish they'd consider a locals menu even if it was only offered Thursday nights such as this dinner. If drinks were half off for locals and our tab only came to $150, I'd return for sure! 
Also, in other reviews people were saying the service wasn't good and they were not quick enough. I def waited in between courses, but my service was great and I enjoyed the ""supper club"" aspect of it. I think the 2 hour dinner was part of the experience. We got a show, and a gift bag which included make up brushes and a compact mirror. (Which totally broke but was cute)  Our promoter/friend/host was able to stop by our table and make sure we were happy. It was all very nice. I even like how 11pm hits and the dance music turns into base pounding hiphop.

Neo Soul Happy Hour. First of all I have to say the Happy Hour was not so Happy. I ordered the Sliders and for 10 bucks I got Two Sliders. And Pretty much the whole Menu was small portion items for about $10 bucks each. The hour drinks were also 10 buck each as well.  Well Drinks and DOMESTIC beer ONLY were 50% off as well. So Overall, not great Happy Hour Prices. 

The venue... What I liked about the Venue were the Chandeliers. Other than that I did not like the set up or the decor. Many of the booths needed to be recovered, it had too many levels, odd flow, and what was really strange DJ/ DJ booth but no real dance floor. (However, They do have an outside pool area so it may be a nice summer spot. But who knows for sure.) 

Service.... UGH!!! Our waitress was terrible!!! So bad that the manager gave me my drink for free because she forgot to give it to me. Then to add insult to injury she did not bring my bill for the sliders until the end of the night and my friend had to pay for them for me because I went home early. Pissed me off because I was there for 2-3 hours after I placed my order and she never bought the bill. Then my friend said she had to track her down for her bill.

The crowd was nice and upscale but I was not impressed with the venue as a whole. I felt like for a Happy Hour it was over priced and they did not live up to and upscale vibe. I would not suggest this place for people looking for a party venue because in addition to all the other let downs they did not provide us with enough table space even though a reservation was made. Would I go back? Um.... Maybe if a friend I really like asked me to go with them. Overall, an underwhelming experience!",dgVJzkjTHapHRloRKYv4bA,0,0,2,sEqD95T6YSJ9bTKbr5zOPA

I don't really know what they're trying do to but I feel this place is masquerading around like a wannabe South Beach trendy lounge/club, but they just can't get there. I usually park in the 2 story parking garage on the south side of the Trop, when I pulled in, they had it shut down (it's been awhile since I've been at the Trop, who knows what they're up to with that), so I drove around to the north end (facing MGM) and I noticed Bagatelle had it's own entrance and parking lot (I guess they have valet, but there was no attendant and no indication if it was closed or what), I ended up parking in a very confusing lot in front, there was only one entrance but as soon as you entered, there were arrows going the opposite direction. 

Anyways, I didn't know anything about this place, my friend invited me on a Thursday night, apparently they have ladies night on Thursdays that includes a pre fix meal and one drink, now I'm not sure of the specifics because the company she had invited me under was comping this, (again I don't know the details, I just showed up). When we arrived we were greeted by two host/hostesses who walked us down to the restaurant/lounge/bar area. This was a little bizarre. We went straight to the bar, drinks are $14 each and I had the nastiest drink I could have picked. A large group of loud, obnoxious drunk people came behind up and took over the bar, all of them ordering shot after shot, I noticed they all had nametags on, apparently this is a stop along a bar crawl per the bartender. So instead of paying any attention to the two people not with this crowd (who I'm sure weren't tipping, they were drinking for free), so I ended up with one drink because she was more involved in paying attention to the guys. Drink menu wasn't impressive anyways. 

Onto the food. We were seated at a table, and the DJ starts playing. If anyone had been to First Food and Bar, you can understand how loud and horrible trying to have a conversation with the person sitting next to you, and you can't because you will have laryngitis tomorrow from screaming. It was basically club level volume. I gave up on trying to talk. We had the Salad Bagatelle which was basically a head of butter lettuce and salad dressing, Grilled Salmon, Grilled Skirt Steak, Mushrooms and Pommes Puree. Only notable item was the Pommes Puree. Oh and Creme Brulee for dessert.

I will have to be truthful in that I wasn't too impressed with all of it. When you first walk in eh-ok there's potential but when I really began to eye out the place, there was nothing that really distinguished itself from the rest. That opinion is coming from a Party Girl standpoint. (But maybe my opinion on that doesn't even count anymore as I'm a former Party Girl-ain't gonna find me dancing atop tables no more!) 

The pool area wasn't too spectacular either. And again I guess because I've been to all the other day clubs. But it is much larger than others; there were ample cabanas scattered throughout. And I can imagine it poppin once it gets started.

If you want to participate in their ladies night it is best to sign up for their news letter. The first 100 women who replied to the email got the free dinner. 

We started with the heart of lettuce salad which looked plain when it came to the table but it was so good! The dressing was some sort of Dijon Vinaigrette which was really tasty. They served these little pieces of warm bread with the salad. Simple but delicious! We noticed that the portions were a little small so we ordered a Truffle Flat Bread as an appetizer. It was delish and the cheese was gooey! Loved it!

The prefix meals came out it was a combination of skirt steak and salmon. There were two sides of vegetables which was asparagus and green beans.The veggies were cooked just how I like them... crispy. The mashed potatoes were awesome! They had some type of buttery after taste to them. The skirt steak was nothing special. I liked the salmon better which says a lot because I typically don't like salmon. It melted in your mouth. It didn't taste fishy. It was perfection! 

We ended the night with mini creme brulees. They forgot to bring my husband's out so I just shared mine with him. It was good but tiny. 

 They had big pictures of movie starlets like Audrey Hepburn , Bridget Bardot, and Marylin Monroe adorning the walls with white table clothes draped over each table. I also loved the plates with their little logo on it. Very cute! 

I wouldn't suggest you come here if you are looking for big portions or food that looks like art. The food is very simple. Overall it was a good experience and I had a lot of fun!",48vRThjhuhiSQINQ2KV8Sw,5,2,4,W9SU6PfIb4831i5qe5M2sA

When we got to the door, we were greeted by the promoter we had spoken with earlier and got in free with a free drink voucher! Walking in, the venue was intriguing. It was dim with fancy lighting on white walls and seating. There were ..dancers? or interestingly dressed women sitting in seats hanging from the ceiling. It seemed we arrived at an awkward time (~10-11pm) when it was converting from dining to a nightclub.  It was kind of empty, with mid 20-30 year olds dressed to hit up a nightclub. I don't even remember the music, so it couldn't have been very good, but not terrible either. We all cashed in our free drink vouchers and then headed over to Tao.

Overall, experience wasn't bad, but wasn't excellent. Perhaps we just didn't arrive at the right time, and not enough people have discovered it yet.

The rating is reflected in their service not in the quality of the food or their effort when it came to the level of production produced.

Music was great, food was great, but when food is not coming out right or not at the same time as the people you are eating with it all falls apart.

I had purchased a $69 Travelzoo voucher for a brunch for 2.  Made reservations long in advance and even got a confirmation call the day before to secure the reservation.  We initially went inside where there is a sign for the 'bistro' and were told to go back out around the building to the pool.  We approached the security staff at the pool entrance and explained we had reservations for brunch.  

This is where things got super shady...

The security guard, holding his clip board, said ""why don't you just get a daybed by the pool instead and we can serve you snacks out there?'.  We certainly weren't dressed for the pool, nor did we want to lay by the pool.  I politely asked to sit in the bistro to have the brunch that I paid for.  He then walks away from us, leaving us standing in the hot sun for about 5 minutes.  Never to return.  We were turned away by the staff and they did not honor the $69 voucher that they had sold us.

Based on other reviews on-line it appears the bistro has closed and there is no more brunch here.  It is just a pool party now.  They aren't honoring the travelzoo vouchers either.

4893652,2012-11-13,1,ns-s43oyaaXN0_lzmrgggw,"Friday evening I had the privilege of dining and a preview of Bagatelle Las Vegas. Upon arrival and before I tried the Shellfish, scallops, and other exemplary seafood, I had a chat with friend and colleague Todd Worz, Director of Operation Marketing. Todd and I discussed at length the concept, style, and future of Bagatelle.

This would not be the first time I've heard ""...we've built a sexy space that isn't a typical venue."" Outdoor pool space - check, Supper Club, later nightclub - check, Dayclub concept - check. This is not new.  What is new however, are a few intelligent and strategic approaches that may allow success in a city filled with carbon copies. Worz detailed the access, or more precisely location, which can make a break a venue.  Where is Bagatelle you ask?  Bagatelle is located across the street from MGM and adjacent to the Tropicana.  A great location?  Absolutely. Parking adjacent to the beach club without walking across an entire casino floor in a bikini? Good idea. Dedicated entry and Valet rather than hotel entry and trek to the venue? Good idea. Worz made it clear thought was a part of the design.

Mind you, design goes beyond egress. How about two DJ booths at the pool? The main booth large, and noticeably elevated with LEDs. How about sand beach volleyball? Yes, sand beach volleyball. I seem to recall the last ""Beach Club"" to open in town doesn't actually have sand...strange. Worz also reminded me of the design continuity from St. Barth's as I admired the mosaic of Audrey Hepburn. The space features seating for 500 guests in its indoor and outdoor venue including two private dining rooms and a private outdoor dining pavilion. The beach includes a 250-seat outdoor restaurant, beach volleyball and 18 luxury cabanas, plus, the outdoor concert venue with a capacity of more than 3,000.

The rather hidden valet needs more signage and yes, not unlike Tryst and XS there is narrow hallway of death (as I call them) leading to the restrooms, but One Group has done a very, very good job with this space. The stark white refreshing walls, more like Hollywood than Vegas, the chandelier not plated in gold (let's not name names), and the outdoor seating that can be utilized as a real dining space alone set Bagatelle apart. I'm very happy with what I've seen and look forward to returning soon. Let's hope things stay quality over quantity.

with tax and tip came to about $25/per lady 

PROS: 
Valet: They have their own valet separate from the main Tropicana valet so you don't have to walk through the casino.
Decor: Very pretty with lots of white and chandeliers everywhere 
Food: _Salad: Simple, I enjoyed the butter lettuce
          _Steak & Salmon: cooked perfectly
          _ Green Beans: standard
          _Mashed Potatoes: very finely mashed. I liked it.
          _Creme brulee: the top was a little too bitter/burnt 
Service: Good! Martin, our server, and the server's assistant and food runner were all polite. They also accommodated to the vegetarian of the group and brought out a veggie risotto for her.. 
Free bubbly: The manager, Griffin, honored the free Yelp bubbly check in even though we were getting a comped dinner.. Props to Jenny D. for batting her long REAL lashes haha

CONS:
Empty: There were like 2 other tables besides us.
Portions: SMALL this was our biggest complaint! We shared 4 medallions of steak & 4 pieces of salmon between 8 girls. It left us wanting more and not in a good way...
Family style: It would look nice if they presented the food in a nicer way rather than family style. 
Comped drinks: a round of comped well drinks is included with dinner.. The 2 birthday girls went to the bar and brought us what they had thought to have been a free round from the bartender.. Then the server took our orders for our ""comped well drinks."" At the end of the meal he gave us a bill for $90. We were so confused. Turns out they counted the shots as our ""comped well drinks"" and charged us for the round of well drinks.. We didn't mind paying but it would have been nice to have known when we were ordering our drinks. Bad communication on their part they should have told us and not kept us in the dark. 

Any who because of the group I was with I had an amazing time. It is what you make of it but with so many other options for comped dinners for ladies I can't really say that I'm eager to return here.

This time around I was sorely disappointed.  Maybe it was because the last dinner I was at, some of the people in our group knew people who worked there.  Whatever the reason, we did not get nearly the same attention this time around and the portions were so skimpy that some of the girls had to get bar food when we were done.  The last few times I was here, we got so much food we couldn't even finish it.  This time, it was like, 2 bites per person. 

The food is actually pretty good, otherwise I would've given it 2 stars.  The steak was tender and the salmon was perfectly cooked.  I was also sad that they didn't bring us the martini glass dessert since it was a birthday thing, but it was free, so oh well.  Another thing that was really annoying was that I knew one of the bartenders, and I asked him if he could get us a round of shots, which he usually does when we've been there in the past.  While he was getting our shots, our server told us our first round of drinks was free and he took everyone's orders.  At the end of the night, he gave us a bill for the drinks and said that the shots my bartender friend got us counted as the first round of free drinks.  I felt that was wrong since he didn't tell us from the beginning.  However, the manager Griffin did give us each a glass of champagne, so that was good too, except the last time I was here for ladies night the champagne was complimentary and kept coming all night!

I guess the key to getting a really good comp dinner here is to go with VIPs, otherwise you're just getting a really small free meal.  Definitely not birthday dinner status.",LwVUO_5jjHuJRhvl6hlHVg,5,5,3,5BCiYzvU7cfKYN_IlVONkA

5260630,2012-11-15,0,ns-s43oyaaXN0_lzmrgggw,"I graciously had the opportunity to dine at Bagatelle during their Friends & Family event.  With high hopes being that they have several other locations nationwide as well as being a part of The One group, this was what I could only describe as a series of unfortunate events.  I do understand that this was a pre-opening event and the team was still trying to work out the kinks but some of these issues that arose could have been avoided.

My friend and I arrived for our reservation about 45 mins early being that she was able to get out of work and over to Bagatelle sooner than expected.  We checked in at the hostess stand being aware that we might not get seated until the time of our reservation.  The hostess did inform us they would try to seat us as soon as a table was available.  We waited at the bar area as instructed and were give quite a few drink tickets which we greatly appreciated.  After waiting past the time of our original reservation, watching 5 other parties get sat, many empty tables in the restaurant and asking one of the hostess' to check on our reservation, we finally decided to walk over to the hostess stand ourselves.  We were then told that the reservation didn't exist even though they had found the reservation almost an hour prior and had supposedly checked us in.  A small argument ensued amongst the hostess' and the content being each blaming the other for accidently cancelling our reservation instead of actually checking us in the first time around.  Our reservation had to be re-entered and they were able to seat us about 5 more mins after that.

After we were sat, the server for our section was assisting the table directly next to us.  Once he was done with that table, he walked away without even acknowledging that we were there.  It took about 10 mins before he finally returned giving us menus to look over and asked us what beverages we would like.  It took about another 8 mins before someone came and poured water in our glasses.  It took about another 5-10 mins before we were given bread for the table and for our server to go over the menu with us.  We were told that for the invite, we would be able to share an appetizer, order an entrée each and then dessert as well.  

Because we had already looked over the menu when we were at the bar, we decided on the foie gras appetizer, I the rack of lamb and my friend the filet.  We also ordered the potatoes puree and asparagus as sides.  The food was very good however it seemed that they could work on the timing of the courses a little for future services.  It didn't take long for the appetizer to come out but we had long finished the appetizer and the plate cleared before our entrees were served.  There seemed to be at least a 15 min gap between the appetizer plate being cleared before we were given the next course.  I do not know if the kitchen was backed up being that they were probably still in the process of getting use to the menu but it seemed that if that was the case, the server could have fired the next course a little sooner so the kitchen would have that much more time to prepare.  The tables around us did seem to be receiving their courses in a more timely manner.  During the course of our meal, our water glasses were never refilled nor were we ever asked if we would like our other beverages refilled.  

After we were done with the entrees, our server returned to ask us if we would like to look at the dessert menu, as we were about to respond believing that we would be able to at least share a dessert since we were told at the beginning of the meal that we would, our server proceeded to tell us that some parties were getting dessert and some were not.  And that we were one of the ones that was not going to be receiving dessert but that he would send out a chocolate plate.  We were a little dumbfounded being that we were told at the beginning of the meal that we would get dessert also because we questioned, why ask if we wanted to see the dessert menu just to tell us that we would not be allowed to order dessert?  After another 20 minutes, nothing ever came out.  Someone came by and cleared our water glasses before even checking to see if we were done with our meal.  Our server finally came back with a bill fold and thanked us for coming in.  At this point, we didn't see a reason to ask about the chocolate that was offered, paid our tip and left.

As for the ambiance, it is a very nice open floor plan.  It had many levels and seemed like a great place to see or be seen.  But, it was also almost the exact same décor as it's predecessors.  I would have like to see Bagatelle make the space their own and change things up a touch.  

All and all, I do hope that our experience was not a reflection of the standards at Bagatelle.  We are considering going back after a few months to see if things are a bit more streamlined.",0fKCfLixNcnickTwCfwf0Q,3,1,2,0_kTEmvYepPp4b0atR3MKQ

5526844,2013-03-13,2,ns-s43oyaaXN0_lzmrgggw,"Went on a Friday night, not ladies night but dinner was to be comped for the business I was with. We were told our reservations were for 7:30, we got there and the place wasn't even open yet. We weren't seated until well after 8pm. While we waited we got drinks at the casino bar, however we weren't able to bring them into the restaurant so we had to pound them which we weren't happy about.

I was under-impressed by the decor. It seemed very cheaply done. The chandeliers were nice, and everything else looked dated. The place is a decent size with a dance floor and seating all around. There was one other couple there and a group of 4 guys; they seated both parties next to us, which bothered me because the whole place was empty.

Once seated, they brought us menus but since our dinner was supposed to be comped it was supposed to be a prefix of salmon and skirt steak. Turned out there was a mix up and they told us our dinner actually wasn't going to be comped. I almost got up and left right then and there, I was furious that we'd wasted our time. Pricing on the menu was ridiculous for example $18-$30 appetizers - I'd pay those kinds of prices if it were a well established place or they had a famous chef, but not for some trendy new place at Tropicana.

After nearly an hour of discussion with a manager, they finally agreed to comp our dinner. We hadn't been able to order yet and we were starving! They brought out salad, green beans, potatoes, etc. All were served family style. We had a group of  8 people and there was definitely not enough of anything to go around. The food was just ok, definitely not good enough to ever pay for. We didn't get any steak, instead they brought us chicken and salmon. I didn't get to try the salmon because again, there wasn't enough to go around; there weren't 8 pieces, and the pieces they did have were very small. The chicken was greasy and came with more potatoes - two kinds of potatoes in one dinner??

All in all, we ate and left right after, it wasn't an atmosphere where we'd socialize in or spend our Friday evening, which was too bad. That makes it just a dinner place - and the food isn't even good. There was live entertainment, but it was a little much (loud and interactive) for only 3 tables of people. I would think Ladies night (Thursdays) is likely their only busy night. It's not hip or happening when the whole place is dead.

Our group left complaining that we were still hungry and the service and hassle were not worth the free food. I won't be going back.",m2vjSXdfs19kNnqUUpAmOQ,3,1,2,Pok4cFdRH9ygch2yzGJldQ
