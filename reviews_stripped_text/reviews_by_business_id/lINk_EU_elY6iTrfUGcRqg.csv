First time, the sprite was flat, obviously they didn't know the machine needed maintenance. Thankfully I was eating when I got home, pulled a sprite from there. Still doesn't make it better knowing I paid for a rotten drink. 2nd time. Order was completely wrong, wrong chicken parts, wrong sides, wrong tortillas and NO avocado sauce even asking three times. Money thrown away yet again, always a disappointment when you're craving a certain meal. Yesterday, ordered the new Avocado salad plus a 2pc dinner. The 2pc meal was correct...YAY! Now the photo of the salad on the board shows like 10 slices or more of avocado. MINE, ONE brown slice!?!?!. Oh come on! Now you owe me three free dinners as far as I'm concerned. Money is tight, time is even more precious. I choose this place because it's one of the healthier fast foods. But now, the service is terrible, they normally have amazing drive thru staff, so polite & accommodating, especially for fast food. On a good note, the salad was a good salad- black beans, cabbage...fresh and nice for a 100 degree day. The dressing is amazing. But one slice of brown avocado doesn't make me very happy. I'm hoping they get their act back together there. I don't mind paying their higher prices for their menu, but they need to get on top of their soda machines, double check the orders so they are correct & get some customer service back to this crew. It was my favorite place for a while now...not sure what has been happening, but quality in every aspect has been ruined. Too bad.",kxbEjMA9_OxoTQWWairVqA,0,0,2,hpY4JbhJhEmN1-z0dL0V_g

Corporate was called from this visit couple weeks ago. I never do that. Ever. 

I witnessed staff calling a customer names such as liar, a bitch, and an asshole. The staff, including the manager, was yelling at this gentleman, pointing their finger at his face, and laughing. The man was asking for something in his order they forgot. Whether they really did or not is not the point. Their unprofessional attitudes took it to a whole new level. People were leaving the restaurant because of staff's reaction. The manager ended up wearing the rest of the mans order...that's how far they pushed him...over an item that was $2.50. Hhhmmm

My turn...they wouldn't let me use my rewards coupon and I'm not sure if it was because they were now upset they had to clean up a mess or what but the same staff kept loudly telling me I couldn't use my free coupon. The email CLEARLY states the codes to enter to use it. At one point the manager asked me if I was a boy because they email from ThEIR headquarters had a mans name on it. (It was an example on the coupon.)She said since I wasn't a boy that email wasn't mine. Omg. The combined IQ was about 4...no wonder they couldn't figure out the coupon. 

I have never seen such disrespect in my life in a business. Corporate offered me a free $5.00 coupon for my trouble. Are you kidding me? Another coupon to try and use with rude and incompetent staff...yeah right.",jRyO2V1pA4CdVVqCIOPc1Q,5,2,1,YLxFa7jWtyKNBPy43WOKSg

Last time I went here they were out of white meat...I'm sorry sir, you do specialize in chicken right?!!! But this time, THIS TIME THEY WENT TOO FAR!!! THEY WERE OUT OF LETTUCE!!!

2678673,2015-03-07,0,lINk_EU_elY6iTrfUGcRqg,"If there was a KFC, Popeyes, and El Pollo Loco side by side by side and I was in the mood for chicken, I would  walk straight to El Pollo Loco with no hesitation.

I have read a lot of the other reviews for this location and came to the conclusion that most of the people who gave a low rating did so not because the food was bad but because the customer service was poor. I too would give a one or two star rating for bad service no matter how good the food is. However, I started coming here since November, 2014 (I am writing this review in March, 2015) and have yet to experience for myself any bad service. The five stars I'm giving is based solely on my own personal observations with the service, as well as food, I had during each of my visits.

Since poor service seems to be a somewhat common trend in other reviews, I'll briefly talk about my own experiences for this location. Each time I've been here the staff was pleasant enough. Never had to deal with rude or disrespectful employees. Never had any issues with my order. The dining area always seemed clean and sanitary. So, for me, I have no reason to lower my rating for what I feel is five-star quality ""fast-food"" chicken. 

Now that I've gotten that out of the way, on to the food. Like I mentioned earlier, El Pollo Loco is my favorite fast food chicken restaurant. They cook the chicken fresh, right up front so you can see it grilling on the huge grills right behind the cash registers. Each time I've been there the quality has been consistently good. The seasoning may be on the slightly salty side for some but I find it just right. I love how the chicken is cooked just right so that the skin is ever so crispy but not burnt, and the inside is always super juicy yet never undercooked.

The salsa bar is great. They have for your choosing toppings like onions, jalapeño peppers, cilantro, freshly made salsa, etc. My only gripe is a couple times the cilantro seemed a little withered.

The churros here are excellent. I've never had authentic churros before so I don't know how credible my opinion would be in this regard but it's definitely better than taco bell churros.

Overall, I really like the chicken. I have no issues with the service. Five stars.",29frixiJr3P1Hu1P_yLbkw,0,0,5,jCv5uORFwY-XqgM7RDprMQ

She was crazy, rude and unreasonable as she tried to get her 3 bags of food for free. You would never know it based on how the staff reacted, they were so calm and professional and never once got pulled into her drama. 

The salsa bar could be cleaner but it is always well stocked. Salsa is messy.

Why yes, there is. The chocolate nachos at El Pollo Loco. And yet, I have given it 3 stars, because it is marshmallow and chocolate syrup and served to me in my car and I am weak. I understand that I deserve your judgment, but try to forgive me. It's marshmallow sauce in the car for under $3.00.",DwtArpGbgdqWOWnJzNGTpg,2,2,3,uWG23qHmfc8jlaRJvB1qKQ

You can buy combinations plates or by the piece. My husband and I enjoy getting an 8 piece with sides, and love those tortillas.  The condiments bar has fresh cilantro and two types of sauces.

The screen lights were not on and no one responded to me. I drove up not sure if they were open. That's when rude Liz said ""I was just saying hello when you drove off and if we would like to order I have to go around."" Ok sure no problem.. I started my order again with the attitude she stated they were out of chips and I can pick a side. I asked her if I can choose any side and she said yes they are all right in front of me. So I ask the kids Liz the cashier made it a point to say I'm waiting for you to tell me what you want. I wanted something else after that she told me she could not do two transactions but i didn't ask for a separate order. That's when I just told her I'm going to pull up and speak to the manager. Liz literally opened the drive thru window saying first of all. I said never mind I'll go inside. Yessica the manager not any better justified her attitude because they are under staffed and said she heard they way she was speaking. Yessica made my order she said they now do have chips. She did not apologize at all or show any type of empathy for how I was treated. It is appalling to me to have experience such bad service from a well known chain. I was shocked and disappointed to have been treated this way. The end result was the manager Yessica making the order and serving me a burnt quesadilla. It's just sad how ignorant/careless people are customer service is key.",PIvdl0Vl0F-p69TuTZX0yg,1,0,1,njFO_e4l5PvzJUe1z7YRvQ

What disturbed me is that out of the 5 employees who were preparing food, only ONE was wearing gloves!!!  Including the cashier (who was handling drink cups and salsa containers in addition to cash), the guy chopping up the chicken for burritos, tacos and bowls (sharp knife, cut potential) or the people preparing tacos and burritos and bowls, they were all handling food without gloves.  Only ONE woman was wearing them.   This is completely disgusting and unacceptable.  I can't believe this is within the standards of the SNHD.

5716843,2013-07-21,0,lINk_EU_elY6iTrfUGcRqg,"Review is for CRAIG ROAD STORE.  I like El Pollo Loco and love their Tortilla soup.
This location is close to my daughters and I have given it more than enough 'tries', but they FAILED OVER AND OVER. It doesn't matter if I eat inside or go thru the take-out, this place sucks.

SERVICE AWFUL, you tell them something is needed, or not working or empty..NO RESPONSE, NO ACTION, NO ""I'M SORRY"".

FOOD, they are ""out of chicken breast"" !!! WTF? I think the drive thru kid was just too lazy to take an order.  Next time, ""out of Tortilla Soup"", (more than once) !!!
Next time, inside ""dining"" experiences consisted of: sloppy, not too clean looking,  the ice machine was empty. Staff notified (by each customer) no response.  So the show was just  watching people's responses to no ice, one at a time discovering this, hearing them tell staff..no response-ever.  Then- the tea machine shoots the tea out towards you, not down into the cup.  Again, no one cared or did anything about it. (they probably secretly laugh at each smuck that gets tea and jumps back from the spray) No sauce choices at sauce bar, no lemons, no straws, no sweetener.  (One kid spent about 3 min out back looking for sweetener...slowly walked back to me with ONE sweet and low! HAHA !!!  Where the heck did he pull that out of???  I gave him a buck for the 'effort'.  He was the only staff that in all my visits ever did ANYTHING service wise.
I drive across town to ANY other location and will NEVER GO BACK TO THIS LOCATION. oh, BTW...I wrote the company website, it's been over two months, I guess they don't care that one of their franchises SUCKS.",Fjk2oT1hqy-790SOqlJpFg,2,0,1,0UBLkBsv6Rf7VBe30MpM0A

5855621,2016-06-03,0,lINk_EU_elY6iTrfUGcRqg,Well another fast food place that management does no training of the employees. I sent the food back because it looked like someone threw up in the bowl and plate. The shift leader Bryan asks what's wrong with the food. I told him it doesn't look anything like the pictures in the marquee or the adds. He said it has all the same ingredients.  I ask where. He showed me how he places everything on the plate and bowl. He took them both back and remade them .I watched him do it this time. He threw everything on the plate and bowl . No wonder it looks like it did.

The drive through line wasn't long but the wait for just a response to make sure if you have enough chicken was just plain ridiculous. Then the wait for the actual food now. Someone help this place. I swear with the amount of time I waited they must have killed live chickens, plucked all the feathers , and then grilled them on the spot. And they're out of flour tortillas as well. And the other orders after me? Still had to make sure there was enough chicken also. Who the heck is managing this joint!?",nehRszUVmKzAfQi1AJC1og,0,0,1,e2xZgn-zr4kJZpI1i8QjuQ

I go into this store and ask for a family meal and request 4 wings with my 10 piece leg and thigh meal.  The cashier can't punch in the order due to lack of training and the manager tells me he can only do 2 wings.  Now they are for my mom and she only likes wings so I push for 4 and end up with 3.  I thought it was a managers job to solve the problem not negotiate a less than desirable solution.  Didn't offer anything to make up for it not even a soda.,RDB3n1X93zJU6FDxE_OfEA,0,0,3,x-FX_ihlM-cjVD943UNjaA
