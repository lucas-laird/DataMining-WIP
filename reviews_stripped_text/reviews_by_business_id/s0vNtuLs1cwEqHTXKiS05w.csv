As people have already mentioned, it's always packed here so we always order food to go. Maybe I don't understand what exactly a tip is for but last time I checked a tip is for when you are being seated,  served/waited on... When paying at the counter they give you a tab to fill out for the tip before they proceed with the transaction... At that point I cross out the tip(because I don't feel I have a reason to leave tip due to not being seated and served) and return the receipt to the person at the register. No matter who I am dealing with I ALWAYS get nasty or disturbed looks when I don't leave a tip... Unless the tip is going to the cooks I honestly don't feel as I should be leaving a tip for the person who bagged my food or the cashier.  Maybe the process should be alerted or the workers at the front counter should be talked to about putting on a better face when they are displeased.",RCFZhhrU8ruQBHMF__gogg,0,0,1,o57YlPkQScZGvi90DZL6vg

We were looking forward to this breakfast BUT got a server name SHAWNI who got to our table with a sour face with no good morning greetings whatsoever. You felt right away she's not friendly figured having a bad day already so I let it go.  

She took our order with attitude, fine ... she punched our order on a kiosk annex to us literally few feet away and I had to make sure the order we got had the famous red velvet Babystacks pancakes. So I asked , "" Excuse me could you please check the pancakes we ordered are the red velvet."" She didn't even come address us back to the table just her head turned and said with an attitude, "" you got the buttermilk so do you want the red velvet? With such contemptuous attitude ... really?!?!? and came back to our table flailing her hands to us and said ""next time you order you need to say you want the red velvet."" Are you effing kidding me?! I let go of her attitude initially but this time I couldn't and shouldn't let this one go!!!! I had to ask, "" are you having a bad day? Cz you are not friendly at all from the get go? If we were first time customers and not know the difference it is your job to explain your menu & any upgrade."" I had to ask for a Manager because she was just plain RUDE !!!!

Is this what this place represents? Are their employees not trained properly on simple customer service?!?! 

A manager name Blanca came and tried to appease us, but it was too late, our morning already ruined what supposed to be a good birthday breakfast.

It was VERY DISAPPOINTING to get a HORRIBLE server because they are the forefront of the establishment and gives you a negative vibe of the place. Customer Service is so important and this SHAWNI so lacks of it and shame goes with the management as well to tolerate and keep people with no business waitressing if they don't want to serve then they shouldn't be in hospitality job!

CUSTOMER SERVICE breaks or makes a business and I highly suggest to the owner of this establishment to work on that and make it a priority to train their employees well.

NEEDLESS TO SAY WE WILL NEVER COME BACK TO THIS PLACE AND DEFINITELY MAKE SURE TO TELL PEOPLE & FRIENDS TO GO TO THE BUFFALO LOCATION instead who has excellent customer Service and much better tasting food than this Durango branch.",H2AP9mUPpQ2cAuh9Ky-ddw,5,0,1,IpMSfwUpPvmyqky-cMmG2Q

248351,2015-07-20,5,s0vNtuLs1cwEqHTXKiS05w,"Hey, it's a Hawaiian Denny's!

I've been here more than enough to know that this place, this specific location, is the worst. Every time I come here, I have to wait 20-25 minutes. And every time I come here, the hostess responds rudely to me when I return to ask if a table has opened up.  Last time, convo went something like this:

Rude hostess: ""I called your name already."" 
Me: ""I heard you say 20 minutes and it's been 20 minutes."" 
Rude hostess: ""I said ABOUT!""

Woman, I'm not deaf, and what crawled up your ass? I always arrive before or on time. That's the point of setting a timer. Duh. Besides, there's no reason to respond to customers like that. Damn. 

I've tried to order take-out from here to avoid the long wait, but from what I've been told this location doesn't do that on the weekends....or so they say. I showed up on a Sunday for brunch and saw a few customers walking out with take-out. WTF?

I feel like the food isn't up to par like it used to be. I was hoping Lola Cora's Corned Beef Hash would be like a taste of home cookin', but it was dry and unbearable to eat. The Adobo Fried Rice...meh, unimpressed. The Country Fried Steak is pretty good, and the Red Velvet Pancakes aren't bad. 

What doesn't suck about this place? The waitstaff is great, and I've never had an issue. Rock on, waitstaff.",CP4WKLIlLcIVm6ov8umgdw,0,0,2,uxCDd_XSnET_WOU8bOPWFQ

297312,2015-02-15,0,s0vNtuLs1cwEqHTXKiS05w,"I have eaten here a total of 2 times (and almost a 3rd if I had of stayed today) each time I have came with friends or family the taste and quality of the food has been great. The proportion sizes were nice for the price asked and the restaurant has always smelled great from the good food. 

The complaint I have is each time there has been long wait times you should practically eat before you come. They say right from the start 30 mins to 45 min wait (which is some how a secrete code for an hour plus). I heard great reviews so each time I waited but it always left me with a tinge of angst before eating there. 

The last and final straw for me was today when I was told the 30 to 45 min story from the hostess who to me makes a poor hostess (absolute horrible attitude for paying customers willing to wait an hour) after I wait the entire 45 minutes (I was counting). I asked how much longer before I'm seated (party of 3). She said there are 2 people in front of me. 

After 6 parties are seated before me including 3 different parties of 3 I go to ask what gives. She sharply replies your coming up, internally my wheels are moving and I'm resistant to let this go! I ask her to explain what makes the other parties of 3 any different? She replies out of frustration and ask do I want to put a high chair at a bar. 

Even if that is the case it has been an hour, as my family was being seated we looked at each other and thought we can not spend our money here today or any other day for that matter. Considering we waited an hour to eat just to  leave is a good indication of our level of frustration. Perhaps the hostess should go apply at the post office or DMV where you are not required nor expected to have a bearing on good customer service. 

Sunday is a very relaxing day that I enjoy and I can not spend it at a place that had bad service and good food or vice versa for that matter. I'll pay extra for both they fall short here in the service and wait times.  But I can not discredit the food (every time I have eaten here was delicious) as it is the only reason for the 2 stars.",1ZcPyRNnHokXiVAZE1Vngw,3,0,2,-oiYNWLLX3x98A_i6NLm-A

We basically go to this location because it is the closest to our house. We avoid sitting at the bar  because they tend to forget about you there. Both times we sat there we literally waited 10 minutes just go get drink orders.

The food was always exceptional, as was the staff. I didn't like how cramped it was, however, so I was happy when they built this one. So let me tell you why I despise this location. The first time my fiancé and I went here he ordered a coffee that had been forgotten for a good 20 minutes so we had to request another and didn't receive so much as an apology. Then I ordered the Cinnabon pancakes, which I've had many times, without pecans because I am allergic. The waitress said oh okay no problem. Guess what came on top of my pancakes? Yep, you guessed it, pecans!! So that right there did not make me fall in love. BUT...I decided to give it another chance. We went again a few weeks later. I ordered the cookies and cream pancakes and made sure it didn't come with any nuts. I was assured it didn't. When my pancakes came out I saw a stray nut sitting on too of the pancakes...it wasn't exactly hidden folks. The waiter apologized and took them to get remade. Let me just let you know that I  am deathly allergic to all nuts; like throat closing, hospital going allergic. The manager came by to apologize and promise me that my pancakes were being remade and she would supervise. They finally come out after my fiancé was done with his meal. I start eating them, and they are pretty darn good, then I just decide to flip my pancake over and what do I see?!?! Another freaking nut on the bottom of the freaking pancake!!! Are you kidding me?! At this point I'm almost in tears. This is my life, like it's kind of serious. The waiter kind of laughed and took them away again. I'm sorry, is the possibility of me becoming seriously ill or even dying funny to you?! The manager gave me some bs and just kind of danced around it. I don't really know all I heard was wah wah wah. I wasn't just some disgruntled customer who didn't like something. This should have been taken a lot more serious than it was. Needless to say I will never set foot In this building again.

583800,2014-03-04,0,s0vNtuLs1cwEqHTXKiS05w,"I have been to this Babystacks two times now. I assumed that my first time coming was a fluke and that maybe they were understaffed that day, but today I returned to find exactly the same scenario.

When we (party of 2) arrived, there was only one person at the front counter ringing people out and no host/hostess. We stood there for about 2 minutes until another patron walked in front of us and signed herself on the sheet. As she was finishing up, someone else walked up and took our names down. We asked if the counter was first-come, first-serve or if you also had to wait for that. The host told us he had to ask the other parties on the list wanted the seats or not first. He never asked anyone and the seats remained empty, along with several other empty 2-person tables. About 10 minutes into our wait, a group of 3 guys came in and sat themselves at the counter. Nobody stopped them or even glanced their way. 

When we finally got seated, they seated us and the party before us, which was also a group of 2, in two separate 4-seater tables. There were at least two smaller tables on the other side of the restaurant, and I am certain they were already cleaned, because we watched them clean them. Why seat us in the bigger tables and perpetuate the incredibly long wait this place always seems to have?

The only saving grace of this place is the quality of the food. It is very good. If it wasn't, nobody would wait as long as you have to at this place. However, they need to make some serious changes to the way they send out orders. 

When we finally got our food, about 20 minutes after we ordered, neither of our sides were included. They were going to be a few extra minutes. After we had both completed our main breakfast, still no sides. I got chocolate chip pancakes (which are just chocolate chips on TOP of pancakes, by the way) and the other person got toast. When they finally came out, the toast had definitely been sitting out. The first time I came, the situation was exactly the same, but the waiter had apologized and said the kitchen was behind. Understandable, but apparently their kitchen is ALWAYS behind. They seem to need more staff.  

All the while, I never got a refill. The table behind us was seated after us, had their order taken before us, had paid, left, and been reseated well before we were able to leave. 

This location really needs to learn how to manage their volume. It's never NOT busy. They need to staff accordingly. 

Speaking of staff, everyone is very friendly and nice, but it's not enough to make me want to go back when there's Rachel's Kitchen in the same parking lot and a plethora of other breakfast joints just 5 minutes away.",O60kMLO3IdqRkajj75DgBQ,1,0,3,lmIRsfTL2l8sJr2JUKzlbQ

644078,2014-02-26,0,s0vNtuLs1cwEqHTXKiS05w,"I preface this review by stating that my main complaint, and the reason I shall never return to this business is based on one policy (well and other than the pancakes I find there food to be underwhelming).  Babystacks, at all locations, has a policy that they will not seat any customer until their entire party arrives. Under certain circumstances I could possibly understand this but I was so appalled by my experience this weekend and their response that I just can't go back there. So the first time this happened to me was approximately two years ago at the Rampart location.  I was meeting a friend there for lunch, they were busy, there was just two of us. She was literally about five minutes away. I went up to the counter and they refused to seat me until she arrived I was told ""we don't seat large parties until every one is here"" to which I stated ""two people is a large party?"".  By the time she arrived there was a wait, although there wouldn't have been had they let me be seated. But we waited and ate there.  

Two years pass... till now, I admit I went back once about a year and half ago since then  friends wanted to go there. Last Friday I went there to meet a friend and her daughter who is 18 mo. old. It was about 10:00. There were a couple of people in the restaurant but it was not busy by any means and practically the whole place was empty. When I got there my friend was waiting, with her 18 mo old in hand. She didn't have to say anything to me I knew why they handn't seated her but I inquired of the host nontheless and was told we don't seat parties until everyone has arrived. Bad business policy, no one in the restaurant, you have a mother with a toddler (who anyone with kids nows is hard to do in a restaurant in the first place) and they are not busy by any means. I complained and the host asked if I wanted to talk to the manager, I said yes and this other female walked over. I thought she seemed pretty young to be a manager, maybe around 20 but it could happen so I proceed to tell  her I thought that was poor service. Only to find out (after I finished talking to her for about five minutes) that she wasn't the manager either and the entire time she was smirking without apology which again just made me more livid. By the time I finished talking to her and was told she wasn't the manager I was just too disgusted and tired to discuss this yet a third time with a party. In my opinion they should have a little common sense, if there is no one in the restaurant and it is unlikely there will be a rush of people i.e. it's not a weekend morning then why upset your customers by making them wait. So what if I went in and said it was a party of one - was seated right away and then hey I ""run into"" a friend who wants to sit with me - what then. This won't happen as I am not going back. 

Okay enough of my rant - you get the picture. I will not be returning, nor will my friend who promptly left with me.  As to the food, the pancakes are good, however the rest of the food is just ""meh"" to me. They do have fresh brewed tea. Their potatoes are frozen, I asked and the waiter when I previously dined was refreshingly honest. So it's not like there is going to be a hole in life by not going back there. So from there we went over to Lulu's - which leads me to my next review...",xECpt0seSDbTmt1mGcfffA,5,0,1,TyKGzje6fGYhmA6fVO1XMA

Waiter came over, he was really sweet and funny, but our food came out and it was a train wreck!

We ask for a manager and they came over and said that they had no idea where the plastic came from because all their stuff is organic and not packaged, which is bull crap, because when I walked in I could see the shelves with the cans in the back in the kitchen. And I find it disturbing that a manager would say that they have no idea where it came from instead of making us as guests feel comfortable.

The meal comes with a pickle so if that isn't your thing then I suggest you ask them to not include it on your plate.

Their unique-ness comes from their huge variety of pancakes (everything from savory, like bacon pancakes to sweet, like Nutella pancakes, bananas foster, etc). 

The good:
The honey French toast was amazing! Homemade whipped cream, huge slices. Delicious. My husband really liked the bananas foster pancakes, the skillet meal, and the huevos rancheros (ordered over the two trips). The sausage patties & links were both good, though I'd only order the patties again. 

The okay: The Nutella crêpes I ordered were fine, but I didn't think anything special. 

The disappointing: Besides being pretty pricey for such a small, home style establishment (the menu is almost a la carte style), the service was definitely lacking. If I'm going to pay $25+ for a breakfast meal for two people, I expect either a lot of food (enough to be VERY filling or leftovers) OR great customer service OR even absolutely fantastic food. This place had none of the above. The entire time we ate, the previous tables' tip was at the table. We reminded the server SEVERAL times to tell the other server. It was STILL there when we left. Unprofessional. The bacon pancakes were disappointing. They boast pancakes filled with bacon. More like, a few bacon crumbs on top and maybe one or two ""inside"" the pancake (laying in the middle of two).

After coming here for several years, I have tried almost all the pancakes.  Cookies n cream, chocolate chip, banana cream pie, red velvet, hazelnut, honey wheat, s'mores, white chocolate macadamia (surprisingly my least favorite).  My favorites are red velvet and hazelnut.

Their seasoned potatoes are to die for!!  Absolutely delicious.  I always get a side of country gravy with them, and dip my potatoes in it.  Yuuuummm!  I love sourdough toast, and am so happy this place has real sourdough.  A lot of places say they have sourdough and serve you white.  Although their menu says the bacon is crispy, if you like it well-done, make sure you tell them (because you may or may not get it crispy).  One of my only complaints!

FOOD:

I ordered the banana cream short stack and mmmm it was so delicious. I got this instead of the regular banana stack because I enjoy having fruit inside my pancakes, not just on top. I am so happy I got this. The custard and whipped cream that they drizzle on top went perfectly with my pancakes. I didn't even need syrup. 

SERVICE:

I'm a picky and very indecisive eater but my server was very patient and answered all my questions. He didn't rush me nor did he look annoyed (even though he might have been). :-)

This sunny morning prompted us to order Mexican huevos rancheros and Korean kalbi ribs with eggs and rice, with bottomless cups of steaming coffee.  Hubby remarked that the huevos rancheros were some of the best he's had over the years (and he's finicky about those)--he said the tortilla was crispy, carnitas well seasoned, eggs cooked perfectly and it all melded together into one tasty dish. The eggs on my kalbi dish were also prepped as ordered, the generous scoop of rice was topped with furikake seasoning and the kalbi had a nice easy  flavor, although a little too chewy for my jaws (dang that gristle). That still didn't deter me from finishing it. My dish came with a side of their short stack (which we upgraded to the scrumptious banana pancakes sprinkled with pecans).

Their main menu goes from the basic eggs breakfast to a variety of Filipino and Hawaiian inspired dishes.  Spam for breakfast... sure.  Chicken Adobo omelette... of course.

I went simple:  nicely marinated Kalbi ribs and eggs, offered tomatoes on the side instead of potatoes or rice. since I was saving my carbs for the peanut butter pancakes.  Delish...!

1. Weekends are always busy. You will wait. If you have a large party or small party you will wait. Make sure everyone in your party is there or you will not be seated and you will wait. Once you're seated service is usually fast
2. Best time to come is a tues-thurs when school is in session. So a Tuesday in may is perfect and they will actually sit an incomplete party when they are empty
3. Get the pancakes. This is what they are known for. Red velvet is amazing but you may need insulin after. So is their bananas foster
4. Coffee isn't the best here, pretty weak tasting, but maybe you're into that. But it's always hot and they're usually really good at refills
5. Food doesn't come out piping hot. Usually just warm. For a while I was turned off by this, but number 3 gives you the reason why we go here. But hey at least they're consistent
6. I love that they have both hash browns and potatoes as options
7. They try to move you in and out of the place quick so if you come on a busy time, don't expect to just hangout after you're done eating.",bGBp3ptS25gzxmFhVfB7WA,0,0,5,Upm9erJ3wmwrSAcfX68XuA

--------    

[Taste] 3 out of 5: (Chili Skillet ordered with Carrot Cake Pancakes)

Food tastes of a decently cooked meal that one can cook for themselves at home. It's honestly pretty bland and needed to be spiced up with a lot of Tabasco. By the looks and taste of the dish, the cooks are very inexperienced. The carrot cake pancakes were so overcooked they were brown and had the texture of a Frisbee. The chili tasted like canned chili, microwaved and put on top of the skillet. However, the food was  definitely edible enough to finish the entire meal.

[Presentation] 2 out of 5::

Very simple presentation on a plate. Nothing fancy. I'm used to way better presentation at competing, similarly priced breakfast restaurants. Again, it seems the cooks are very inexperienced, or have little direction or guidance from the owners. 

Environment
------------------

[Seating] 2 out of 5: 

Very uncomfortable seating arrangement. Tables are too close together and wobbly. The staff also doesn't seem to understand how to seat people. There are plenty of open tables but people are still waiting in line. Booths are pretty much non-existent. The existing booths are straight-up hard wood with no comfort cushions or padding. 

[Concept] 4 out of 5:

You can't go wrong with a breakfast joint! People that love breakfast can be loyal patrons if you get the right people designing your restaurant atmosphere and concept. Pancakes, eggs, bacon, sausage, coffee, everyone loves these things.

[Service] 3 out of 5:

Service is OK. There doesn't seem to be any ""type"" that the restaurant hires. All really good restaurants don't hire everyone that puts in an application. Good restaurants hire the right person for the job and the concept of the restaurant.",a28y5uZ_J1Ge_rvA2xoyqQ,0,0,3,4fQ7LoKMO7YH6DhqnwgkcA

The food was delicious, living up to the expectations set by the other two locations.  The bacon was thick and crispy.  The garlic fried rice was an excellent complement.  The hazelnut pancakes had a well-balanced flavor, and will be a hit for Nutella fans.

I've been there twice now and the service wasn't great. Here's what bugged me both times. I like buttery pancakes. Both times, I get a stack of pancakes with ONE of those little pats of butter that comes in a foil wrap - like the kind they serve with bread at other restaurants. And one tiny little shot glass sized container of syrup. Both times I ask for extra butter and syrup and the waiter literally comes back with ONE MORE pat of butter and another shot glass full of syrup. Come on guys! Is it really that expensive to bring out a little dish of butters? Really, I'd prefer a little container of whipped butter like most places give but the pats will do- just don't be so damn cheap with them. You should get at least as many butters as you have pancakes. 3 pancakes = 3 butters. The last time we went, first my drink order was wrong and they also brought me out the wrong omelet.

I've been in and out of the valley for years and had always wanted to try this place for the Red Velvet Pancakes. I hate to say but I was soooo disappointed!  The neon color in the inside was the first concern and then they had such a strange taste; nothing like red velvet in my opinion. Our omelets and skillets were either really salty or had zero flavor. I will say the seasoned potatoes were good and the sourdough toast is alright.

I asked her what the WiFi password was and she told me ""I don't know, go ask the people at the front""??!  Okaaaay, let me just do your job for you.  So, after standing in line for some time, I asked for the password which isn't a secret and is literally posted on the cashier stand for everyone to see.

I appreciate friendliness just like you probably do. 

However, something must have happened after that.  Maybe the manager could see I was ticked because different staff started helping us, and I didn't see the original waitress until we were about finished.  At that time, she seemed to have gotten the stick out.

The place had few tables left from what  I am sure was a busy breakfast service.  I have never been a fan of sweet items for breakfast such as pancakes or waffles so I was hoping for someone else to order one of there delicious choices Babystacks has to offer, and I could sample.  Bacon and eggs is more for me to start my day but I do love a good omelet to start my day.  SO that what I did. A build your own where you could select a cheese, meat and two veggies.  I ended up making a selection that was much like a ""Denver Omelet"" and try the seasoned potatoes and wheat toast.  this is a meal that will never let me down.

When the meal came out my omelet was a little small for my eyes but it would do the trick.  So with everyone selections I was able to try the crepes which were sweet, fluffy and delicious. I was able to try the s'more's pancakes as well which was more of the same.  Good but too sweet for me.  Next time I hope some one orders the ""Red Velvet"" pancakes everyone has been raving about.  As for me I might be more adventurous and try the portuguise sausage.  It has been awhile since I have tasted these and if I remember right they were tasty. 

After looking on Yelp there are apparently more than one of these places in Vegas.  If you have tried one you have tried them all.  I will probably stay close to home and not seek out the others locs.  No need to burn the gas.

2nd visit 

Ordered the Lolo's Adobe fried rice special. This specialty dish is an omlette with shredded chicken and fried rice stuffed inside and garnished with green onions.  The filling with chicken and rice was a little salty for my taste mostly because of the heavy soy sauce marinade of the adobo. 

I was also able to try the portuguise sausage this visit.  Not very impressed, it tasted like hills hire farms ring bologna.  I have had homeade portuguise sausage which had a nice spice to it. This had almost no flavor in my opinion.",8fsZcLADFrPTbGrFqMACpg,0,0,3,dqYeNqiNoXCBPXMWZt0jlA

2716987,2015-04-24,0,s0vNtuLs1cwEqHTXKiS05w,"Breakfast is probably my favorite meal and Babystacks is definitely my favorite breakfast place in Las Vegas.  I've eaten many times at the original and second locations on Buffalo, and quite a few times at the third location that opened in Centennial Hills not too long ago.  Although I haven't tried the newest location in Henderson, I have no doubt the food and service meets the same high standard as the other locations.

As the name implies, the featured breakfast item on the menu is pancakes, and if you like pancakes, you have a great assortment to choose from (including Red Velvet, Cinnebun, White Chocolate Chip Macadamia, Carrot Cake, and many more).  At last count there are 18 specialty pancakes in addition to traditional, and you can have them as your main course, or you can get pancakes as a side to complement a different breakfast item.  Watch out:  they're delicious and the stacks are big!  Go with a half stack unless you're truly hungry.

But Babystacks does more than pancakes!  Their other menu items are just as delicious and also range from traditional fare including a variety of eggs cooked to order, omelets and Eggs Benedict, French Toast, crepes, but they also have a few dishes unique to the shop.  Be sure to check out the Kalua Grilled Cheese, the Portuguese (or Spam) sliders, or Rick's Adobo Fried Rice for starts.

Things to remember:  The North Buffalo location is tiny; the South Buffalo location is much larger and more comfortable, as is the one in Centennial Hills.  Also, they won't seat incomplete parties, so have everyone together when you arrive.  On weekends, every location I've visited will quickly fill up and a line will form on weekends.  Go early to be there when they open, or bring a book to enjoy during the wait.  Keep in mind though:  the wait is worth it!

I've ordered the pancake on the side and I got the red velvet pancake and that was good, really fluffy and I like the whipped cream on top and the cream cheese syrup. 
My fiancé ordered the loco moco with the potato on the side and he said it's better than the real thing in Hawaii  and the potatoes were cooked perfect. Idk how that's possible, but he became a fan of loco moco now lol.

The red velvet pancakes are the best I've ever had- nothing else comes close! It's not super sweet, and there are chocolate chips in the pancake itself, and the cream cheese drizzled on top isn't sweet either. They're perfectly moist as well.

If you're hungry, the chicken adobo fired rice wrapped in an egg is also bomb too. It's pretty heavy though, so you may go into a food coma afterwards haha. 

Last time I was here I got the steak and eggs, opting for the garlic fried rice. Just a forewarning- they don't go easy on the garlic here! It was satisfying until the last bite.

No bc it's totally worth it. If I wanted fast food, I would go to a place specializing in fast food; just saying. Also, there is always take out if you don't want to wait and unlike some other breakfast places that shall remain nameless, they know exactly how to prepare a take out order; meaning they line styrofoam containers with tinfoil so my hot food doesn't sit directly on the styrofoam and cook to it which is a huge deal.

I moved to Minnesota to then realize how much I miss the delicious, mouth watering menu at Baby Stacks The logo they have is really simple and inviting. At this location is big and personable. The staff is friendly and professional. The menu has a nice variety which I'm very fond of.

My favorite item to order here is the Mexican skillet So flavorful. 
The potatoes are nicely cubed shaped, which compliments the entire dish. On top of the perfectly golden potatoes cubs is the shredded pork. The shredded pork is  moist, breaks apart simply. Paired with jalapeños, and eggs served on top. On the side fresh Pico and sour cream and a side if buttermilk pancakes.

The hot tea is yummy served with honey.

It looks like they run specials on the whiteboard up front which is cool. I decided on the cookie butter french toast and my wife had the biscuits and gravy. The french toast was decent but there was a lot of egg leftover on the sides of the bread and they basically just threw a huge scoop of cookie butter on top. It wasn't anything special and I can't say I'd order it again. My wife's biscuits and gravy was really good at the other location but at this one it didn't even come close. The biscuits were dry and the gravy was super plain, almost flavorless. 

The whole experience just wasn't what we expected since we liked the other one so much. While the service was ok, not everyone was friendly and they seemed to be understaffed.

We slipped in on a Sunday morning about 9:00am and were promptly greeted by smiling personnel, but were told it would be a few minutes. Although it was relatively busy, about half of the tables were empty. We were finally seated and were made to wait for beverage orders and then again made to wait before giving our breakfast order. The party seated after us and seated right next to us was taken care of first. I opted for the Chicken Fried Steak, which is listed as Country Fried Steak on the menu. It comes with eggs, like you would expect, but you can opt for garlic rice instead of potatoes. What? Garlic with breakfast? OMG! Awesome! The meat was cooked to perfection and the breading was fantastic. I would rank this among some of the best CFS in Vegas. I ordered the eggs over-easy and they were a little on the runny side, so keep that in mind when ordering your huevos. My meal came with a choice of bread, which included buttermilk pancakes, or an upgrade to any speciality pancake. I chose the bacon pancake. Bacon baked right in. Everything is better with bacon, right? The Mrs. opted for the red velvet pancakes with the cream cheese syrup. Wow! It was like dessert for breakfast. I am sure there are healthier choices on the menu, but if you are going to do it, you might as well do it up right. The food definitely lived up to the hype. The service, not so much. We'll just chaulk it up to working out the kinks during the first week.

Checked out this spot which is in our hood and seems like this location has consistency issues. Luckily for us, we didn't run into any issues with our orders.
Babystacks is known for having Hawaiian style breakfast items influenced by a well known spot on Oahu, and If I see comfort foods like Adobo Fried Rice Omelette, and Loco Moco, You better believe that's what I'm goin' for!

Our server Mike (who was also one of the managers) was great the whole time, offering suggestions, checking up on us constantly, and even took some time to chat with us and even after our meal, invited us back to try the Cookie Butter French Toast, one of his personal favorites, Which I've already made at home a few times...;)

Wifey ordered the Hawaiian Style Breakfast Sliders with Portuguese sausage, eggs, and cheese on Hawaiian sweet rolls and added on Bacon Pancakes with maple Syrup and I decided to go with the Loco Moco with a side of their popular Red Velvet Pancakes. They also had a Kalua Pig Benedict which sounded good but when it comes to anything benedict, I just do it up at home, because I have come to the conclusion that no one here knows how to perfectly poach an egg! (at least in all of my breakfast experiences here)

Wifey enjoyed her sliders and I thought my Loco Moco was pretty good. Both the Bacon and Red Velvet Pancakes were delicious, But my faves are still Du-Pars and the Sweet Cream Pancakes at 50's Diner. Wecome to the neighborhood Babystacks!  ALOHA!!!

Options include: Red Velvet, Rocky Road, Chocolate Chip, Bacon (yup, you heard that right), and lemon ricotta (Lemon Ricotta is my absolute favorite). If cakes' aren't your thing, they offer other items like skillets (layers of potatoes, cheese, eggs and other toppings) , specialty items that feature SPAM, Garlic Rice, Portuguese Sausage, or Kalua Pig Benedict (another personal favorite).  Service at this location has always been great. The atmosphere is nothing fancy. However, their fresh cakes' and local ambience hits the mark in my book.

The cuisine revolves primarily around pancakes but there are other options. Some even have a Hawaiian/Filipino take on them like the Hawaiian eggs Benedict they have on the menu. Easily some of my favorite eggs benedicts in Vegas. 

Pancakes here are perfect and not dry like other places. You can get them standard or upgrade them to any of their different options. Most people I know like them upgraded with the red velvet batter but I prefer them with strawberry topping on top.

3903217,2017-08-31,1,s0vNtuLs1cwEqHTXKiS05w,"I am a frequent customer at Babystacks and have been for over six years. I started going to the location near Buffalo and Flamingo because it was near my home. We moved across town and I started frequenting the location near Stephanie and Warm Springs. Now I've moved again and am located between two locations, the one on Buffalo and Smoke Ranch and the one I'm reviewing now that's located at Durango near Deer Springs. 

I prefer the location at Buffalo and Smoke Ranch, but with the severely limited seating options, there is often a wait, even on weekdays. This is my fourth visit to the Durango and Deer Springs location. This location has a large seating area, so there is almost never a wait, which is convenient. 

Needless to say, I know what my favorite Babystacks meal, the Honey [French] Toast is supposed to look and taste like. Before giving a poor review, I wanted to give the location a few tries to see if my experience was a one-time thing. Sadly it has not been. 

On my first visit by myself about two weeks ago I ordered my usual meal, the Honey Toast without powered sugar and coffee. The Honey Toast came out burned, very black on the back and along the edges. I went ahead a tried a bite to be fair, but it tasted like charcoal. In all my visits to Babystacks locations I had never gotten my Honey Toast in that condition. I showed my waitress and she brought me a new order of it, only slightly less burned, but the center of the Honey Toast was salvageable. I went ahead and ate it in disappointment. I didn't have the time to send it back again as I had somewhere to be. 

On my second visit on the weekend a few days later with my boyfriend my Honey Toast was okay, but the waitress brought out his food a full five minutes before mine. 

On my third visit a few days later the Honey Toast looked a little overdone, but eatable. However, when I put my fork into the whipped cream I came out with a kinky black hair. I showed the waiter and he had my food remade. 

Today I decided to give them one last try. My Honey Toast came out burned yet again. I pointed it out to the waitress, but told her not to bother reordering it. I'd eat the middle and call it good. I asked her to please let the cooks know because this keeps happening. My coffee was also served at room temperature, but at this point I barely noticed. 

I'm one of those customers that hates, absolutely hates having to send food back. It's embarrassing and I don't want to ever appear to be a b---h, and I don't want to ever risk the ire of the people making and handling my food. After three out of four bad experiences here, I'm done. I will not come to this location again. It's extremely disappointing to come to this conclusion because I've always seen Babystacks as a restaurant with high standards.

My boyfriend, son, and I came in for a late breakfast on Thursday. There were people there, but plenty of open tables. Once seated, we ordered drinks from the server while we looked over the menu. She asked if we were ready to order, but I wasn't and asked for another minute. She left and we did not see her again for at least 10 minutes. Fair enough though, I did ask for more time and that's what we got. 
We placed our order ; I got the Mexican skillet with bananas foster pancakes, my son ordered bacon and eggs with Rocky Road pancakes, the bf ordered a veggie omelette and strawberry pancakes. After another kinda long wait, out came my pancakes, my bf's pancakes and my son's bacon and eggs. Then another wait. It wasn't too bad for me. I ate half my pancakes before the rest of my food came to the table, but my boyfriend likes to eat his pancakes for ""dessert"". That's just the way the man eats. So my skillet finally comes, my son's pancakes come. The server says to my bf, ""your omelette will be out in a minute"". Fine. Well, she didn't come back with his food until my son and I were about done eating. She just sets it down with a, ""Sorry"". So he scarfed it down since he was starving and then ate his cold pancakes while we waited for him. 
My bf and I have both been servers before so we're pretty understanding of kitchen mishaps and we tend to tip generously, but the way she handled this was all wrong. She could have offered some form of explanation so he would know he should eat his pancakes instead of saying it will be out in a minute. She also should have offered a discount or something for the inconvenience of not bringing his food until we were done. So the 2 stars are strictly for the food which was very good.

I have never had Spam until today.  When I looked at their menu and saw the Specialties section, the Spam Scramble popped out and I knew I had to order this.  Along with this, I opted for the two pancakes you can get instead of toast.  I ordered the Orange Creamsicle pancakes that come with orange syrup, whipped cream, and a small container of cream cheese icing.

Breakfast was great!  Spam is just like cubed lunch meat.  The Furikake mixed in gave the scramble some extra taste and the rice was good.  I didn't finish the rice because I wanted to have the healthier food--the pancakes with orange syrup and whipped cream.

As others have mentioned, this is a large restaurant and they have a large waiting area.  The three of us opted to eat at the counter where there was immediate seating.  Service was great.  My coffee was refilled several times and they were there to refill water glasses, too.

Second time only reason I had to order from here was so I don't have to drive 25 mins to get the stuff to make my own at home. Let me tell you something put the takeout items in a bag so your customer can take it not placing aplastic bag in front me to put the food in the bag after paying for it. You staff was watching put my food in my own bag and didn't do anything. This is so petty but so important. 

Food is isn't amazing it is mediocre and overpriced food that I wouldn't eat unless I have no choice.

4014534,2014-08-29,2,s0vNtuLs1cwEqHTXKiS05w,"Funny enough, we live right smack in between both Babystacks Café places.  We finally decided to take the jaunt in the opposite direction and visit the location on N. Durango!

Place is super busy for breakfast on the weekends.  Especially on a Sunday.  So church goers beware.  You may be in for a bit of a wait in your Sunday best.  Luckily for the wifey and I the wait was only about 10 minutes that day.

Place is nice and lively, and seems a bit more spacious than the other location on Buffalo.  Actually it seems a lot more spacious with the high ceilings and more tables.  I like the colors, actually makes me want to drink coffee and eat breakfast.

Menu here is just about the same as the other location.  Breakfast and lunch items galore!  Nothing in short supply.  I skipped my want of Rick's Adobo Fried Rice (hard for a Filipino) and went with something else out of the menu.

I chose the Ranchero Omelette ($9.25) - four egg omelette with an entire Ortega chile and chicken, topped with fresh green salsa, and pepper jack and cheddar cheese.  Also came with hash browns (love mine well done), and two buttermilk babystack pancakes (of course!).  Omelette was of good size, with lots of chile and chopped chicken on the inside.  The cheeses complimented the omelette well, and the green salsa gave it a nice added kick (but not too hot).  I enjoyed it a lot.  The hash browns were standard, good and cooked how I like.  I however love to drown mine in pepper, ketchup, and lots of Tabasco.  Yum.  The babystack pancakes?  Good to the last bite.  I dunno what it is about their babystack batter, but it's a keeper.  Nice, hot, fluffy (not you Gabriel Iglesias), not doughy or rubbery, perfect with some maple syrup.  All in all a great breakfast for me.

The wifey had the Mexican Skillet ($9.95) - flat top potatoes with marinated carnitas and jalapenos, with pepper jack cheese, topped with two eggs over-easy, and a side of fresh pico de gallo, and sour cream.  Wifey also opted for two buttermilk babystack pancakes.  She said her dish was good, but there was a bit too much jalapeno in her skillet making it a little spicy for her liking.  The pico de gallo also had more onion than tomato.  Other than that she enjoyed it, and gave thumbs up to the babystack pancakes.

I like Babystacks Café for breakfast and will keep coming here for their morning delights.  Service here is great, our server was quick, very attentive, and kept our cups full.  Can't ask for anything more, especially during the early morning rush.

He suggested we eat at Babystacks that serves some Hawaiian Style grinds, and I'm glad he did.  Its located on Durango near Elkhorn, just off the 95.

We ordered Lolo Rick's adobo fried rice ($9.95 | chicken adobo fried rice wrapped in an omelette), with your choice of side.  I chose mac salad, while my friends chose country potatoes.  BS also offers loco moco, portuguese sausage, corned beef hash, as well as crepes and other traditional bfast items.

Da adobo fried rice was winnahzzz!  The chicken adobo was moist and nicely seasoned.  BTW, adobo has Spanish roots combining salty & sour flavors.  The Filipino version uses shoyu & vinegar to accomplish the foregoing.  It went well w/ the omelette, and we were stuffed afterwards:  5 Stars.  On the other hand, the mac salad was suprisingly bad.  It was comparable to store bought mac salad:  2 Stars.

Regarding the ambiance, this is a big place.  There are several tables in addition to a counter.  The space is flexible so you can combine tables for large parties:  4 Stars.  Likewise, the service was really good.  Our waiter was super friendly, and the remainder of the team gave us a lot of Aloha:  4 Stars.

Mahalos to my cuz for the rec on Babystacks.  The entire experience was very positive.  If you don't mind a little drive from the Strip, hit this local place.  You won't be sorry.",o1_sfJ71nrq5QrF00v3Icw,50,46,4,W8LV_tzHCFj3rh2rMlkOZA

We chose to eat at Babystacks because it was convenient. My boyfriend and I aren't really pancake people (we prefer savory breakfasts) and had ordered the corned beef hash and the adobo fried rice. I felt like it would have been an injustice to come to babystacks and not try their pancakes, so I asked our server for their most popular pancakes and decided to get the strawberry pancakes to go with my corned beef hash.

I wasn't expecting to really like the pancakes since I normally don't. BUT I ATE ALL OF MY PANCAKES. IT WAS DELICIOUS. It came with fresh cream and strawberries and this strawberry sauce that was addictive. I almost forgot all about my corned beef hash because all I wanted to do was keep eating the pancakes. The corned beef hash was perfect, it had a nice crisp to it and some softness in the middle. I love eating it together where I'm able to get corned beef hash, a little runny yolk, and potatoes all in one spoonful. 

My boyfriend got the adobo fried rice which was served in an omelett. I've never seen that before so I thought it was really creative. It was well-seasoned and yummy.

For a place that we randomly picked, I was thoroughly impressed and we enjoyed everything we ordered. I'm honestly still thinking about those strawberry pancakes.",dh_2BNnKPlvp3OW3TLTDNQ,1,1,5,pzfo-AweVhZInzRGZc5k8Q

This was my first time at this location and like the others, it's quite busy. I NEVER eat at the restaurant because of how busy it is. Instead, we pick up and eat in the comfort of our own home :) 
The Mr. loves the S'mores pancakes and I typically try different ones. I don't think you can go wrong with any of their pancakes. All that I've tried have been delicious, it's a matter of what you like and in the mood for. I think Babystacks has a pancake for everyone. 
This time I had the Hazelnut and they were, of course, delicious. The best part is their home made whipped cream. It's delightfully creamy, sweet, and fluffy. I typically don't eat pancakes with whipped cream, but this one I can't say no to.
I also tried a new breakfast item, since trying chicken fried steak recently for the first time (if you read my reviews, you already know), I've decided to broaden my breakfast horizons. I tried Corned Beef Hash and it tasted good, flavorful and crispy. Not really my thing though. I usually get Kalua Pig Benny here, it's really good!

This is something any L&L, big city diner, loco moco shop does easily. The gravy too tasted a little... Boxed. The coffee tasted distinctly plasticky mixed with that airplane coffee taste of bad water, and the sugar didn't make it any better.

She went off to the side to talk to another girl, and I said ""Wait, you don't even work here?"" She said no, I just saw you and your family waiting for a long time from inside. I thanked her and said it was appreciated. I went up to an elderly haole woman behind the counter and gave her our name.  She was surprised that we were still there. Apparently they had just given up our table. I said, did you even go outside? She said yes we did. And I thought, wtf? Another non-working customer just came outside to grab us. If it wasn't for that other customer, we would probably still be standing outside one day later as I type this. So stupid. Don't lie to my face that you came outside when you didn't. Despite that Haole's ignorance, our server made us forget her and made or meal great. Get someone else to run the front.",Q_DTTi0hrfE2PPPQ7r5x1Q,0,0,1,Hv6z9T2xPWrUuvc4-iry2Q

Today though my Babystacks love affair might have ran its course.  Was seated as soon as I walked in, no wait which is great, usually there's at least some wait.  Server brings me some coffee, I order, start waiting for my delicious breakfast to arrive...  reading some news articles on my phone I notice a few parties arrive, they've got to wait around 5 minutes to be seated, so I've been seated and food ordered easily 5-10 minutes before they arrived...  coffee cups empty, no big deal food will be out shortly so I wait, it is getting a little busy so I leave the staff alone, not too bothered at this point...  5 more minutes go by, party that was seated after me gets a full spread of food and refills delivered to them.  I start to look for my waitress, maybe my order got jumbled up it happens...  few minutes go by nothing.  Coffee cup still empty...  approach the counter and ask if maybe there's a mix up, people that were seated long after me are well into their meals and I've had an empty cup of coffee in front of me for 10 minutes...  lady is real blunt, ""sir your food it coming we are busy"".  I say ""Yeah I get that but those people sat down 10 minutes after I ordered and they're halfway through their meal, maybe there's a mix up with my order...  she gives me a stop bothering me look, says she'll check on it so I go sit back down...  see her call the waitress over, they have a conversation, while they're talking another waitress brings my food...  coffee cup still empty, no offer to refill...  at this point I'm playing a game to see how long it takes someone to refill my cup.  Food is room temp at best, bacon is cold to the touch...  my waitress comes over to ask if everything's ok, I say not really...  well is there anything I can get you?  Umm yeah coffee would be good since I've been sitting here with an empty cup in front of me for the last 20 minutes...  eat my lackluster $20 breakfast and go to pay...  lady says that'll be $20, I had already set my card down with the check, she stands there with her hand out I point to where I had placed it on the register, she scans my card and just tosses it on the counter.  I'm no body language expert by any means, but you could tell she was being passive aggressive by the way she just chucked it on the counter...  I'm standing there with my hand out to take my card back and she just throws it at me like she's dealing black jack on Fremont street.  By this time I'm past the point of pissed off...  ""Is there a problem?"" I ask.  She gets a look on her face like she's trying to hold back a fart.  I say ""Look, I've been here 100 times, never had this bad of service...  is there a manager I can talk to?""  She gets this kind of fuck you, yeah I'll get you the manager kind of condescending tone...  brings the manager over and it's the same one who brought my food to me when the original waitress didn't...  I'm a pretty loyal eater, I have my spots I love and recommend, this Babystacks has always been one of those spots, but today they lost a customer...  pretty sure it won't hurt their bottom line, just feel really let down by my experience there today...  I'll be sure and let people know about Egg and I or the cracked egg from now on instead of Babystacks...  also wanna point out after reading other reviews I'm not the first who's had problems with the old bitty in the 1982 rimmed glasses that works the register.  Might be time to make a move, a hostess' job is customer interaction, she might be better suited washing dishes or something, customer service isn't her forte.",xDe0OZtMG96bZ-GBMonnxw,1,0,1,wH9OO7LMgX1KwDbVrzXe8A

Honestly I was really excited about this place with the large line formed outside it gives you the feeling of a great meal ahead. But you sit down in a very uncomfortable chair at a fairly small table. The service was decent but not great honestly it was just non memorable at the least. Then we get to the food I don't care what they say these are processed products and there is nothing special about that I can go to a mcdonalds and get that kind of breakfast. The omelet was decent but again besides the eggs seemed like processed food inside the chili was just plain gross honestly. This restaurant is really close to my house but I am just not ever going to bother waiting to eat here again not worth the wait in the least.,k5XFyzSbP1yW2nXkrh6ZCw,2,1,2,QVVQ_2P08lLPu2TX1oJpaQ

The first time we came in we waited awhile (as expected) but what threw me off was upon walking in, you literally have to fight to get your name on the wait list. There is no order, no organization, no one there to greet you. The ""hostess"" is the same person who is running the wait list, seating people and bagging to-go orders. On a busy Saturday/Sunday, that's just not reasonable. 

We came in with the whole family this past Saturday. Busy, again, as expected. We were quoted 30-35 minutes for a party of 5 with a highchair. Waited close to 50 minutes. The hostess was not friendly whatsoever and once we were finally seated, argued with my mother-in-law after she requested an extra chair. 

I will say, the service afterward was prompt and food was definitely good but just that initial first impression kills it all.

The adobo omelette was a huge disappointment. Given, the owners are Filipino, the adobo was horrible. Filipino adobo is based on, garlic, vinegars and black pepper with a touch of soy sauce. This omelette tasted more like shredded chicken over rice and tossed in Kikkoman Soy Sauce! Tasted exactly just that!  I couldn't even proceed to eat it even after adding ketchup! 

The server asked how I was doing and told her I didn't want to eat the salty soy sauce chicken omelette and she offered me something else. I told her I would pay for it and to get me the loco moco. I have to admit, the gravy on the loco mock was good. I paid extra for the garlic rice and the patty on the loco moco tasted good as well!

Lemon ricotta pancakes- this I think is my favorite on their regular pancake menu. Its a bit different since these are thin pancakes, like German style pancakes. I like it because its a good amount of sweet and the light tang from a squeeze of fresh lemon on it is nice. If you like those Dutch Babys this is the pancake cousin.

I know it's hard for chains to be so consistent, but other chains do succeed...

The main things are - 
The food seems to be a bit overcooked. If you look through a lot of the pictures, especially the pancakes, a lot of them are cooked or even burnt. 
What boggles my mind is - why would the cook even serve them? Then, why would the waiter think those are okay to serve? Shesh...it's so bizarre to me. 
We ordered the carrot cake pancakes and they were overcooked, but still edible. Yes, we ate them. I will praise them on one thing, the cheesecake icing is delightful.

On top of that, we had the Mexican Skillet and the Spinach Benedict. 

Both were okay. Biggest thing for both of us were both dishes were very soggy. Everything, from the potatoes to the english muffin. It makes it to where the dish is not very enjoyable. I don't know if they were just sitting in the window for awhile or what. 

The service was good - we went in past 12, so it wasn't very busy. Easy to get a seat and the server was pretty attentive.

Eva tried the Red Velvet Pancakes: Whipped Cream, Chocolate Crumbles & Cream Cheese Syrup. Good as always...probably one of the reasons why they got famous!

I'm by no means a morning person. But tell me we're going to Babystacks, and I'm there! Seriously, this place is a breakfast lover's haven. You'll find most of your typical breakfast items here such as eggs, sausages, bacon, omelettes, etc. They even serve several of their dishes with a Hawaiian twist to them.

Babystacks definitely specializes in pancakes (hence the name). They have almost an entire side of the menu dedicated to their magnificent pancake creations. It's so tempting to try them all, but I always end up ordering a stack of two Red Velvet Pancakes. No visit to Babystacks is complete without these fluffy cakes! They are made super soft and warm, topped with whipped cream and chocolate chips. Some type of cream cheese/condensed milk syrup is also served on the side. Pour some of this delicious sauce on the Red Velvet Pancakes, and you have yourself a real treat!

Since I feel way too guilty having just dessert for breakfast, I always add something of nutritional value to my meal. Sometimes I will build my own omelette. You can choose from a variety of fresh vegetables, meat, and cheese, which is pretty awesome. It also comes with a side of seasoned potatoes or hash browns! FYI, opting for egg whites is an additional .75 charge.

Every time Hubby & I come here, it is packed with fellow breakfast lovers. To beat the morning rush, I'd recommend going before 10am. And whatever you do, don't forget: Red Velvet Pancakes!",oQ0m7zCcppNT-8jMbPC6DQ,3,2,4,mASysJB1xQBDKEcBWh39MQ

I have been here three times now, and I did a take out, and each time I have been less than impressed. Perhaps I will always hold the first location as the best, but really, this one is alright.
The crepes here are not good. Chewy and bland, really a let down. The quality of the skillets and pancakes has been hit or miss. One time my stack was under cooked in the middle, very gooey. 
Service is slow, and the benches are really not made right. They are not comfortable at all.

The bad part about waiting and waiting is...you'd expect your food to be spectacular. So sorry, but it isn't. They do have a spectacular option for pancakes. I won't lie...I sure love their banana fosters. However, it is what it is. Nothing spectacular. You got your bananas...you got your foster. Lol.

The lolo Rick's adobo fried rice has failed us each time only reason we've been back a few times and ordered the same thing each time is because we were hoping each experience was a fluke due to the business. Dry, bland, and the distribution into the omelette seemed poorly executed. At the beginning of the omelette it's all rice then when you get to the end then out comes the meat. 

Kids order typical.spam and eggs so nothing much to review because it is what it is. Spam...and eggs.

They don't seat you unless your entire party is present. So even if you're waiting on just 1 person, sorry...keep on waiting and watch all the people who have come way after you being seated to then having to wait for a table to open once your 1 person arrives. 

Overall, I think this place is highly over-rated. However, I would.pick this place over an Ihop or Dennys hands-down despite cheaper options on said restaurants. But since we aren't much of eating out for breakfast kine of fam anyway, it isn't a type of place we'd become frequent customers regardless. It has to be something really spectacular to turn us into breakfast folks. Service has also been slow. Slow for refill, slow to even ask for our drinks, slow to order, just slow.

It is a great option to have this place up in the Northwest for those who are into breakfast menus, though.

They actually sat us within 15 minutes, so I really have no complaints there. 

The service was good, attentive and responsive. Definitely busy, but again, expected for a Sunday afternoon.

Having no expectations for what they would have on their menu (other than pancakes), I was pleasantly surprised by their offerings. Essentially any kind of pancake and topping you wanted, crepe or French toast as well. We ended up getting lemon ricotta pancakes, hazelnut pancakes, and something on the other side of the menu that tugged at my little Filipina heart strings, Lolo's Adobo Fried Rice Omelete: chicken adobo, fried rice, all inside an omelete. 

The Lemon Ricotta was soft and subtle - the lemon flavor rather eases its way in like an aftertaste, but was not as robust as I would have expected. The Hazelnut was what my Nutella-loving heart was after: Nutella, whipped cream, and crushed hazelnuts, which added a terrific crunchy texture to the mix. I additionally added bananas, which I highly recommend for a balanced sweetness. 

The Adobo Rice Omelet: it brought me home. It felt like a home-cooled meal that my mom would have made me, and I was so glad to have stumbled across it. I honestly didn't need the potatoes that came on the side.

Why don't they tell you that before they seat you?  You think as a courtesy they would tell you that instead of just trying to get your business and make you suffer in the heat.  Got our orders and when they brought the butter packet for my pancakes, it was melted and literally dripping out of the packet.  How healthy or appealing is that!

Great service and nice portions with a good price. 

I'm more biased in ordering their Hawaiian/Filipino breakfasts more than anything else .  I often order the ""Rick's Adobo Fried Rice"" (adobo fried rice with shredded chicken wrapped in omelette) or the Loco-Moco (fried egg and hamburger patty on top of white rice smothered with gravy).   You have an option of choosing a side, which can also be any of their options of pancakes.  I am a big fan of the carrot cake pancake.  For a few extra bucks, you can order another side.  I normally order the Portuguese Sausage (cut into several pieces) or a side of Spam (2 per order) to round up my meal... I know this may seem a lot, but I was raised understanding that breakfast is the most important meal of the day.  

Needless to say, I like this place A LOT.  I highly suggest anyone try this place, at least once.",WDO_asCWPs7dpCG5v_x57g,0,0,5,GN7ZuZ5TUDzb3rXaVJQXVg

I think our negative dining experience had more to do with this location's poor management more than anything else.  It's obviously a busy location, but the process for checking in, waiting, being seated, waiting and then waiting even more....was too much.

The icing on the cake....when someone finally asked how things were....as we are paying on the way out.....when we said it wasn't good and for our first time here we were disappointed....the guy taking our money said nothing!  Not even a sorry about that, yeah today was really busy but give us another try, or even let me see if my managers available???  Nothing....

It seemed like I annoyed her and she's like well there's going to be a 20 minute wait so I sat down.

The pancakes are small in size! The best thing about this place is the hazelnut pancakes with nutella. I must admit that it was very tasty! They do offer a military discount.

The surprise on my face when I opened the menu and saw some of my favorite dishes available: Portuguese Sausage and eggs and even Spam Eggs and Rice. With a side order of their delicious Red Velvet Pancakes and CreamCheese Syrup... The perfect start to my afternoon (considering I have yet to make it there before 1130am).

The environment is moving but not too busy with the constant Hawaiian Reggae tunes playing in the background. The staff is friendly and helpful and the location is conveniently located to not have to worry about parking. My only gripe would be the size of the location making for a sometimes unwanted wait time. Otherwise, great food for a good price!
