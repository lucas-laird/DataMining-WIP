287393,2017-09-11,0,k5pA0N9K2zy5OQZSqeC0jQ,"I ordered the Trio and picked two Caliente burgers and one Cowboy. The Caliente has some heat, but nothing overwhelmingly hot. I believe it came with pepper jack cheese, habanero mayo and some jalepenos. It had the perfect amount of spice for me and the flavor was there. The Cowboy was probably my favorite of the two. It came with bacon, BBQ sauce, cheddar cheese and topped with an onion ring. I managed to finish the burgers and was pretty full after, but I still couldn't help myself to those Burgerim fries/slices.

The family and I ordered two Trio combos, which is six burgers of a decent size, including fries, onion rings and two drinks for just over $32 with tip. Next time, I'll order a beer (too early). I would like to see them include some local brews on tap. 

The staff is very friendly here. Food made fresh to order and our food came out fast. They constantly checked if we needed refills on sauce (ranch and buffalo mayo). Service is definitely unlike any burger restaurant I've had here in Vegas and it's nice to have a place like this so close to home. This will be my new weekly go to for a great burger. Eat here because the food is great and they don't cut corners.",cbe6OifsNSj_qc5hYrWzmA,1,1,5,7YSh_G2pQf4GPqkmQxJjxg

631956,2017-09-18,0,k5pA0N9K2zy5OQZSqeC0jQ,"New burger joint just opened locally. My partner and I decided to give a try.  Basically they make oversized sliders (2.8oz patties) with different 'meat' choices. Quick serve style place.  Friendly staff. I went with the Spanish beef (chorizo), dry aged and beef.  My partner went with beef.  Both of us went with the potato style fries and fully loaded with the standard options.

The presentation was awesome. The food came in little boxes showing the type of meat we chose. What was cool is if you can't finish your meal all you have to do is fold the box down and it's a to go container.

Now for the food.  Chorizo had a nice subtle flavor.  Not over powering at all.  The Dry Aged had a slight salty taste from the aging and the beef was just another burger.

All the burgers were a bit dry but not like cardboard. The beef was my least favorite as it was not really anything special. My favorite was the Dry Aged due to the salty aspect.  We were not a huge fan of the buns as we both like a softer denser bread with some flavor.

Overall we like the place and we will be coming back again to try different fillings.",6olFrba-cqITs2eBCnt3VA,0,0,4,N36bPsuWoDTlwaXHIE_Dxg
655077,2018-02-08,1,k5pA0N9K2zy5OQZSqeC0jQ,I have eaten here before and thought it was some good food. I walked in tonight and was floored by how bad the service was. I sat at the bar with my brother and couldn't believe the service we received. We live in this neighborhood and want the best for our local peeps. We decided to sit at the bar and were greeted with some hostility. We asked for a menu and he told us to just look up at the menu on the wall. He then walked off. A nice girl then came up and asked us if we would like menus to order some food but at this point we decided to go elsewhere.

1227720,2017-10-05,2,k5pA0N9K2zy5OQZSqeC0jQ,"Pros: Unique meat and topping options.

Cons: The menu is actually a bit hard to follow and the person who tried to explain it to me made it a bit more complicated. Wait time was very long and they were not busy. Food was only OK and some of it was kind of cold because we were waiting for other items to be done.

Details: I decided to try this out as it opened recently on our side of town. I ordered take out and there was one couple ahead of me in line and one couple already eating in the restaurant. Since it was our first time I got five burgers, all beef. I selected three of their standard 'special' burgers (cowboy, caliente, and california) and two additional custom burgers along with fries and onion rings. The lady taking the order really did not explain the menu well and I am pretty sure I ended up paying more than I really should have given what I ordered. I waited a good 20 minutes for the food and the customers after me got served first. I could hear what was going on and it was that the kitchen was making one item at a time and missing items in my order (which is what caused some food to be done much sooner and cold when we ate it).

1503535,2017-10-30,11,k5pA0N9K2zy5OQZSqeC0jQ,"I like the concept enough but the execution needs tightening and until everything is a bit better,  the pricing is higher than warranted even for what you might be able to argue is a novelty product. Location is in the end of an awkward strip center (particularly if you're coming north), service was friendly enough, being able to customize your order online is convenient.

LIKES: You can pick the bun (GF and lettuce wrap included), burger (so many choices, wagyu was best!) and toppings (eggs, bacon, cheeses) for a truly custom slider experience. There are plenty of sides, and you can even go wild with drink choices thanks to the Coke Freestyle machine, and there are even non-slider options for those who want to go big with regular-sized sandos. Service was nice enough, bar seating for solo diners and booths for groups.  Seems like they thought of nearly everything.

DISLIKES: All burgers were on the dry side, both in terms of meat temp (despite specifying MR) and the fact that none of the sliders include condiments? They're on the tables but you're SOL if you get takeout. You can add specialty sauces (garlic was good!) to your order for a fifty-cent charge, which is the start of the nickle-and-diming. I understand the premium topping surcharges, but the half-sliver of avocado I got is comical. Both wheat and white buns were dense, 2 burger combo should be sufficient for most. Opted for half and half sides with Burgerim fries (plain coin-cut) and onion rings, neither of which was seasoned, but the kicker is the $3.50 split charge which should have warranted an entire additional side rather than the TWO onion rings I actually received. My order was over $20 and I only finished one slider. I came from the gym so it wasn't due to lack of appetite.

They could easily cut down the menu to just burgers fries and wings. Tried it the first time to see what it was like, comparable to any other place you could get burgers or wings and probably save costs. The wings were really small too. You would get bigger sized wings at Buffalo Wild Wings for almost the same price. If you really want to try it, do it. If you want more bang for your buck, go to a jack in the box or McDonalds.

When we asked for some more onions we were told ""it comes 2 slices per burger"". We ordered 3 burgers so shouldn't we have gotten 6 (2x3) slices?
We also asked for ranch. We were told that we had to pay for it in the front counter. We had to go back and stand in line to order 2 ranch sauces ($1.00). 

Summary: The burger didn't taste bad and the burgerim fries are good too. The 1/2 fries, 1/2 onion rings wasn't worth $3.50. (20 over cooked skinny fries + 3 onion rings).

The interior decor is very nice and it's well decorated and put together in a great aesthetically pleasing way. I found the menu well designed and the staff extremely friendly and well trained. 

I only tried the grilled chicken sandwich and onion rings. So I can't speak to the burgers. The onion rings were good. Nothing out of the ordinary or different than you'd get at any burger joint. Nothing wrong with that but it's the same as you'd get at Burger King.

The chicken sandwich to me is probably better at Burger King. At least there the chicken has that nice char broiled flavor. I always eat my sandwiches without sauce so maybe the aioli would help it but I tend to think the chicken should stand on its own. It was just average. I really want to see new places thrive but my advice to the owners is to kick it up a notch. To survive in Vegas without a recognizable chain brand you have to bring it on the food. It just feels like any other burger chain to me. Well executed concept but food not bad but not something I'd go out of my way to eat.",f7Q14HePdG1vZpx28PpDRg,0,0,3,OlH8NBr7MjO4Z3RLSV_5aA

They offer smaller burgers with lots of options to customize your meal. There's an option where you can order one, two or three of their smaller customized burgers with your choice of side and a drink. They also offer appetizers,  regular sized burgers and salads. 

We love trying new places to eat, so I was pretty excited when the bf suggested this for lunch. I'm a burger purist and I only like lettuce, tomatoes, onions and pickles with it to really let the flavor of the beef shine through. I opted for the burger duo with one patty being regular beef and the other patty wagyu beef (50 cent upcharge). I took a bite of each and couldn't tell the difference in meats. Both were also just dry and bland. The patties definitely needed more seasoning. Thank goodness for the garlic aoli that we got on the side; which cost 50 cents extra. It was definitely needed to cut the dryness and add some sort of flavor to my burger. The garlic aoli was the best part of the meal actually. The fries and onion rings were forgettable as well. My bf opted for jalapeños and pepper jack cheese on his burgers, so his food had more flavor than mine did. But he agreed the meat on his was dry as well. 

The employees were friendly and patient with all the questions we had. Another plus was for the multiflavor Coke machine. Other than that, if I'm feeling for a burger, I'll just go elsewhere.",BI4jBJVto2tEQ0NiaR0rNQ,9,5,3,8B32lquvAHp9wKMOFpXHtA

Located just off Bermuda and Silverado Ranch it's tucked away from the busy intersection at a newly built strip plaza. Burgerim's menu for us first-time patrons seems overwhelming but their friendly staff was able to guide me through the steps. The ability to customize flavors of bun, meat, veggies, sauces and sides is catering to the picky and/or adventurous masses. We like to create our own food experiences while also being able to rely on house favorites.  It was lunch hour and I was hungry, so I chose the ""duo"" one chicken breast slider and one turkey patty slider with different toppings. Both sliders were hearty, healthy (wheat bun), and flavorful. As for the side, I chose ""half and half"" for onion rings and potato chip slices. They offer a kids menu, fun mini desserts, and the soda/drink station where you can go wild over 150 ways. Wait time for your meal is approximately 10-15mins as it's cooked fresh and they use the buzzer method while still bringing your meal to the table.

3432227,2017-10-22,0,k5pA0N9K2zy5OQZSqeC0jQ,"I have been waiting and wanting to try Burgerim for sometime now as I've seen the sign ""Coming Soon"" for a little bit.  Since I missed the neighborhood opening and delayed lunch opportunities with co-workers, I finally said, screw it, I'm going.

There's a couple of reasons why I like Burgerim a lot.

1. I love sliders, especially when you can mix it up.  And because the burgers are smaller than the usual, I consider this as sliders. The better thing about it, the patty is thicker than your normal burger as well as slider.

2. Variety of protein. You have a choice of beef, chicken, turkey and salmon to name a few. This is a big plus if you're trying to cut down on red meat and looking for healthier options.

3. Variety of toppings like egg, avocado, bacon, for an additional fee of course. Thus allowing for 100s of different combinations.

During this visit, I chose the pre-determined CA burger as well as the regular burger. I figured, I should try the basics just to see what the normal burger would taste like.  If the basics can't be done right, then I wouldn't think that the other meats would be done right either.  So I'm glad to say that the regular cheeseburger was done as expected.  Good burger, I like the special sauce. I'm not a pickle person, but the sliced pickle was just as large as the burger itself. My husband is going to love that for sure. 

My second burger was a CA. Because the burger does come with avocado and mixed greens, I did pay $.79 more.  The CA comes with chipotle mayo so there is a nice hint of spicyness to it.


4. Reasonably priced. Eating out adds up. And if you're like me where you need to get out of the office to break up your work day, finding a place where lunch is under $10 is very helpful.

With this visit, I did get the Duo which includes two burgers, fries and drink. Duo's start at $9.95 and because I got the CA, I paid the extra $.79. So not too bad. However, I really don't need two burgers. The Uno combo starts at $6.95. Even at this price and with the few additional upgraded toppings, one would still be under $10 and content without being over stuffed.

5. Atmosphere and cleanliness is so very important. If a restaurant looks or feels unclean, then this could kill even the taste of the food. Thank goodness the restaurant is newer, clean, current in decor, and the music selection pretty good variety where you can hum to a Bob Marley song or imagine yourself singing like Alicia Keys.

6. Good customer service helped to close out a positive experience at Burgerim.  Thank you to the very helpful employees.",leyNDNVu09Ldbg5ujPWMhQ,2,1,5,547GD3qaVUQlbgLATWVMEw

The Good: super clean, really nice staff, beer on tap.  Fries are a little different and they're good.

3634282,2018-05-03,0,k5pA0N9K2zy5OQZSqeC0jQ,"This is a nice, clean little burger place. The burgers are not regular sized. They're basically sliders, but a bit larger than your typical slider. The food is good, but I think A couple things need some attention.

The menu is a little awkward. Now that I've been there I get how it works, but I had to be walked through it the first time. Instead of just ordering a burger, they have 4 steps to follow:

Step 1: How many burgers do you want?
Step 2: What kind of patty do you want? (Beef, Chicken, Vege, etc...)
Step 3: What style do you want? (Classic, California, BBQ, etc...)
Step 4: What side do you want? (Fries, Onion Rings, etc...)

I think it would be better to just offer several different types of burgers and show photos of the product.

I ordered two classic beef burgers and fries with a drink. $10.

I don't care for the fries. Instead of regular fries, they're small, thin discs about the size of a quarter. They taste fine, but it just wasn't a satisfying french fry experience. I can see why some people might like them, but I prefer a traditional, thicker fry. The onion rings looked delicious.

The ketchup and mustard is located in the corner near the front door. This makes things a little inconvenient. When I picked up my order, instead of going back to my table I had to walk the tray over to the ketchup / mustard station. The burgers are served in a tight, cardboard type box. Since I prefer the mustard on the bottom bun, I'd have to remove the burgers from the box and flip them upside down right there at the ketchup station. Because I'd rather not handle my food at the ketchup station, I skipped on the mustard.

After I sat down, I realized that I forgot to put ketchup on the tray for the fries. So now, I have to get back up and carry the whole tray back over to the ketchup station. This is silly. Just put ketchup and mustard on every table and be done with it. And where's the salt and pepper?

As for the burger itself, the ingredients are crisp and fresh. The whole thing is well prepared and similar to a homemade mini burger. I thought the taste was fine, but I wasn't really all that impressed. For the same money, there's other burger options around town that are much better.

I would eat here again but only because I'm a little curious about the Cowboy burger with bacon, onion ring and BBQ sauce. If it's a hit, I'll be back; otherwise, I don't really see this place becoming a regular lunch spot for me.",k_ygij9GEqELTg3nYca_zw,0,0,3,Cl-8OCq4XZf9CCoXYpzn9Q

After a long boycott of this establishment by myself because of how they handled their grand opening food giveaway, I finally decided, WTH let's give them a shot. Unfortunately, I should have held tight with the boycott. I walk in at lunchtime and there is just one table with any patrons at it, and they were served right after I ordered, so I figured my wait shouldn't be long. Wrong... apparently it's takes way more time than I realized to cook a burger that is the size of a quarter. And even though they are tiny little pucks of meat, they are priced like a regular sized burger. And none of that would have drawn my ire had they simply made my one teeny, tiny burger as I had ask them to, which they did not. Not even close. And when I called to let them know how they goofed, I didn't receive an apology, but rather was told to come back for the correct burger. Yeah, I'll pass on that.

I love the burgers they sell here since they are petite size burgers. It's all in the portion size so, with eating a smaller burger I am keeping the portion size very low. If I don't celebrate the small victories then what's the point of being healthy at all. Don't know a better way to celebrate than with a fabulous burger!

The menu is so extensive here when one places an order for a burger. With the various ways one can dress their burger I decide to keep it simple. One of my twins was along this trip so we're going to share the duo of burgers. Dressed with pickles, lettuce, cheese; and one with an egg. The types of cheese one has to select from are very healthy too, since most of the varieties of cheese are white. The fries here are very tasty ,so we are sharing one of there signature fries too!

We decided to eat here since the burgers are all messy and oh so good. The dining area is very comfortable and plays very upbeat music.

My husband's caliente turkey burger was moist and way too spicy! The mini burger had around 5 jalapenos. So every bite you got a big piece of jalapeno. The whole by her probably only took 5 bites. The turkey meat was not dry, which is good.

My party ordered: 3 burger combo - 1 dry aged beef with American, red onions, and lettuce, 1 chicken with grilled onions, sautéed mushrooms, avocado, and Swiss cheese, an order of half burgerim fries half onion rings, 6 piece sweet chili chicken wings. 
The good: the onion rings are delicious! Definitely top 5 of all the onion rings I've ever eaten. They have a coke freestyle machine. 

The bad/ugly: the beef burger did not have any onions or lettuce on it, it all somehow ended up at the bottom of the box when they brought it to my table and I had to scoop it up and put it on my burger. The burger was TERRIBLE. It had a weird taste, not like seasoning but like maybe they left the meat out too long before cooking it or idk it was so bad I took 2 bites (we all deserve a second chance) and threw it away. The burgerim fries leave much to be desired. They look like they're supposed to be good and coined after the restaurant itself (like buffalo chips at bww) they should be good, but THEY'RE NOT! They're too crispy, too greasy, and bland. The chicken wings look amazing! They have the perfect crunch. The sweet chili sauce tastes like medicine and the chicken is rather lackluster and tastes like the cheap bag of party wings you can get in the freezer section at your local grocery store.

I got a ""three-pack"" with a drink & some fries.  Other than the drink having free refills from one of those cool machines that can mix-up almost anything, it seems like they are actually charging more for the burgers because of the 'novelty' of them being miniature.       

In the future, I'll go to some other fast-casual burger joint instead, paying about the same, but getting a burger product that's more than what the Burgerim ""sliders"" add-up to, and if I want ""sliders,"" I can go elsewhere & get them for less $$.

I had a falafel and a veggie slider ""California style"" which means with avocado, mixed greens, chipotle mayo, and I think another topping but I forgot what.  Both sliders were delicious!  I think the California style went better with the veggie Patty than the falafel Patty, though.  I ordered the sliders as a combo with a choice of sides (you can choose any side but the home fries as part of the combo) and a fountain beverage.  The side I chose was the burgerim fries which are a hybrid of French fries and potato chips--similar to tostones but with potatoes instead of plantains.  They were delicious and filling.  It was amazing how much they tasted like french fries, even though they looked liked potato chips.
The interior was attractive and the employees were very friendly and made dining there a pleasure.  I look forward to dining there often and highly recommend this restaurant!",4Sv_jHe_zIUgm_CiDrxKUQ,1,0,5,xaY58LufBeuZK_-R7M4zAQ

There burgers are a little bigger than sliders and the patty itself are pretty thick. The fries look like home made potato chips which were good too. My husband got the wagyu patty and aged patty. He said they both were amazing as well.

What's wrong with this picture? I guess the cashier didn't hear I wanted ALL beef patties, no onions, pickles & sauces on the side. Turns out burgers were sliders not full size. Ended up with 4 chicken breast filets and 4 beef patties....disappointing!!!  Partial fail!

When asking about chicken, I thought she was talking about the chicken wings sauce on the side but she was talking about the burger. 

Selected Crunchy garlic sauce for the chicken wing....I ended up with sweet chili sauce ... big difference!! Chicken wings was over cooked & dry. Fail! 

Something happened when we went to try their Wednesday 50 cents per wing special. Over cooked and dry! Fail!

But once the food came out it smelled delicious. Once we got home we tore into everything. We ended up getting 2 Trio Combos, 1 Double Combo and a Kids Meal. We ate everything! My little one who normally takes her time eating, ate all of hers and wanted more. The Burgers were super fresh and juicy. The fries (Burgerim) were awesome. Basically a mix between fries and chips. The crunchy ones were like thick chips and the soft ones were like flat French fries. We all like our fries and consider ourselves fry connoisseurs and they were delicious. The price is to be as expected since you are getting higher quality food. I would say average around $10-$12 per person and it's more than enough food.

Wednesday Wings are the reason for me to come check this place out and I'm glad I did.   
I enjoyed their buffalo and crunchy garlic sauce.   Perfect amount of sauce and super crispy!   
(Note: They also have BBQ sauce as an option, but I didn't try it.). I also enjoyed the sweet potato fries and onion rings as my side.   

Tips.   
Definitely come in on Wing Wednesday for $0.55 cent wings, you can order as much or as little as you'd like.  I also ask for them to make it extra crispy.    

The combos can get a little pricey especially when you start customizing it so I suggest you come on a Thursday when a combo is $5 (uno burger, fries, and a drink) if you're trying to save a little money

Sides, opt to get the half and half so you can try a combination of fries (burgerim, slim, sweet potato, or onion rings).  

Overall you can choose slider type burgers (choose from beef, chicken, or salmon and then customize it), sandwiches, salads, or wings.  Maybe I'll bring some friends to try other things on the menu next time, but I'm definitely coming back for the wings !",7P6t9qnhKLOa8SqGb85B7w,3,2,4,rTj-QksXOBbyH26iLA2CkQ

If you aren't reading this review on your MacBook in a Starbucks sipping on your fifteen-adjective beverage, take your hunger and your wallet elsewhere.

The slider selection, four basic options, were not too bad. Meat quality of the beef burger is fairly high (about 80% as delicious as one from Habit burger) and the menu seems to let you customize a slider to taste with miscellaneous toppings. Their signature fries seemed to be slices of small potatoes, fried and salted. thick enough to not become potato chips but nothing remarkably different from other real fries.

The 'sweet and spicy chili garlic sauce' on the wings is just a rendition of Mae Ploy. The wings were decently sized, but had too much batter, and certainly does not justify costing nearly a dollar each, and extra for dips.

Service was good. I had no real idea what I was doing there but the person behind the counter guided me through my order well. My order was ready in about ten minutes. I sipped on a drink from the Coca-Cola Freestyle machine while waiting.",ndMHThI6lIqDMdCSpuyPcw,0,0,2,D1t0cErcgPwqqyWg7uzdBA

I had looked it up on Yelp and knew that this place serve Gourmet sliders. Their menu was a little bit over whelming because of all the choices. I ordered the three Burger combo. You can mix it up and have three different types of burgers if you want, which is exactly what I did. I kept all the toppings as standard.

The Merguez:
This was my least favorite. It's beef with Mediterranean seasoning. The seasoning was okay but I think it made the Patty soft.

The Wagyu:
This one was pretty good. I've never had wagyu before and the toppings mixed well with this one.

The Veggie:
Of the three burgers I got, this is my favorite. It was cooked just right and mixed well. It seems to fall apart in my mouth. I would definitely get the veggie again.

With the meal, you also get fries and a drink. Their fries are a little bit different. You can get a few different styles of fries but I just got there burgerim fries. Next time, I think I will try their sweet potato fries.  They have a coke machine with a variety of flavors you can choose from as well.   

I'm surprised at how many people think this is expensive.  For my 3 burgers, fries, drink, and 2 sauces, I only payed around $15.  And honestly, next time, I will only get the duo because the three burgers was more than enough.",Yy0CAv2eIy-X1BDbtzXykQ,0,0,5,aSCpJMXIkWPrhSfpZbgMHQ

They are a little pricey, especially for their sizes since they slider sizes. They're a little big but than a slider but much smaller than a regular sized burger. Lots of choices to choose from. I wouldn't pay extra for the bacon because they only put one tiny slice, maybe because it's too small to fit one. I wouldn't pay extra for the wagyu meat either because you can't taste the difference from the beef patty. Maybe if you ordered a regular burger with just bun and patty, MAYBE you'd be able to tell which one is which. The fried egg is a nice touch to the burger, very delicious.
