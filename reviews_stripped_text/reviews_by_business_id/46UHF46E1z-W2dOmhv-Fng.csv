There is just a few other people here.  I came up to the bar to ask if they can put the game we came in for on one of the TVs and it took FOREVER for her to even acknowledge me sitting at the bar.. Then she says to me, ""I really have to finish this story (and points to a male customer) but what do you want?"" - rudely.  Then I come up to the bar a little later after our group has already spent quite a bit on drinks, and I'm trying to order food for us ... Guess what, I sit there with the menu in hand for at least 10-15 mins and still no acknowledgement... I sit and patiently wait as she's talking it up with another male customer then goes on her cell. Finally I said, fu*k it.  I cannot believe how horrible the customer service is. And I think it's because either I'm not a regular or I don't have the right body parts. I am utterly appalled.

In my work's shopping complex (that's dangerous,lol), we have seen the news here, handfuls of rounds bought by the bartender when -name your team wins- I aint a fan of football so whatever. I'll take the free drink anyday though!
We've seen managers on their way to bigger and better things, co-workers send off to other stores, and happy birthdays. Really we go there all to often to blow off steam. They know what we drink!
Wolf has been there for years,though I havn't seen him in a while..

2017506,2016-04-30,0,46UHF46E1z-W2dOmhv-Fng,"Meh. I'm a 20+ year Vegas resident and have always known this location existed, but have only been here 3 times in the last year. One Sunday for football, a swing, and a grave. With the exception of the Sunday day shift bartender, each time I walk out feeling that I just wasted time and money that I wish I had spent elsewhere. 

I couldn't tell you what color the walls are in this place, but it always feels dark and dingy. Even during the day. The staff is no different ..seems like they're just going through the motions waiting for quitting time. The clientele reflects the same. As if people are just there out of convenience.

Having been to various PT""s over the years, (with very few exceptions) most times if you don't personally know the bartender the service sucks and people who work there seem to be hired for every other reason other than their knowledge, abilities and customer service skills.  Good bartenders get moved to shifts where there are no customers, or leave altogether, and bad bartenders get rewarded with busy shifts seemingly just for sticking it out, being under 35, or having tits.

PT's marketing seems to pretty much amounts to a  concentrated strategy of ""Put one on every corner and then put all of the pressure on the min wage bartenders (who by trade are not marketers) to magically make something happen"". 

With the exception of a handful of locations and employees,  the company has become a boring, cookie cutter, stale reflection of what it thinks Vegas used to be, and is completely out of touch with what Vegas is and the markets and neighborhoods that they serve. It's main goal seems to be amassing real estate, not actually innovating  or customer service. 

How do you know you're not at a PT's? You get a beverage napkin under your drink, and the bartender actually checks on you from time to time even if you aren't gambling. 

In 2016 when anyone can pull the world up on their cell phones, it's strange to put money into an ""internet"" jukebox and find ""certain"" music blocked. I've been to a lot of bars in many states and Pt's jukeboxes are the only censored internet devices (for grown ups) that I have ever seen. Even Rick James?! C'mon! 

Why even bother having a jukebox? Just play satellite radio and leave it at that. I understand that certain gamers may not want to hear Dr. Dre' or Wu-Tang 24/7, but in it's attempt to cater to one specific kind of customer from the 1950's (a shrinking demographic that has almost completely disappeared), PT's as a group has become just blah, outdated, and isn't any thing to anybody. But that may be just a symptom of what Vegas bars as a whole have become and no one seems to be willing to break the mold and move forward. 

Nothing reflects that old mentality more than it's insistence on playing Fox News on it's TV's.You think of your local tavern as the place to get away from it all and relax, and yet every PT's you walk into makes it a point to let you know their political views. Everyone in the free world knows what Fox News is. It's not a secret. 

Maybe it's a not so subtle message to let you know who their target market is and that no one else is welcome. I don't know. it's just strange that they go out of their way to make sure it's always playing, 

I have an idea, since you profess to be a sports bar how about just playing all sports? You know..the thing that I don't normally get at home, or on my phone. I don't need to go to the bar to see Fox News. I go to the bar to get away from things like Fox News.

Overall if you think of PT's for what it used to be back in the day, and expect that level of excitement and customer service, you'll be severely disappointed in what the majority of PT's have become today. Yes they have a lot of locations, most of which they seem to be just dragging along behind them. And yes I'm sure as a corporation they're making money at the moment. However if I didn't know a few people who still worked for this company, I would easily pass it by like a tasteless piece of dried tofu on the side of the road. Options in this town are plentiful. You don't have to put forth much effort to get something different from the same old stale bar with apathetic service. 

I had once hoped that the new corporate PT's with all of their various names (Gold.Tavern. Pub. Place.and so on...)  would raise the bar in this town, but the reality is that they've actually lowered it while simultaneously saturating the market with total suck. And it seems like everyone realizes it except the people in the corporate office.

Is it just PT's? That would probably be unfair to say. The Vegas bar scene as a whole is stale and boring, and none of the main players are leading to improve it.",7Pu4MGcnSbTV2DW5XbZG4g,0,0,2,q6QB7KEipDuskDWE5CfZNQ

The lady manning the bar last night, a little after 8pm (6/16/15), seemed like she hated her job. She was just pissed off and slugged around the bar reluctantly serving guests, never once flashing a smile. I ordered a Long Island Iced Tea and it was really weak (and I'm not even a fan of strong drinks!). When I was finished, I was waiting to get a bill and proceeded to stare at her for 10 MINUTES, waved my hands a few times when she was walking towards me, and I even politely asked her for the bill when she walked by. Eventually, I became fed up and simply left without paying.....and I don't feel badly about it at all, the drink and service sucked.

To PT's management:
Do an overhaul on your employees. Finding a job around here is rough these days are there are a plethora of skilled individuals who will be THRILLED to find paid work. It's to the point where I mention these outings to my friends and they respond by saying: ""Why would you go THERE?! PT's SUCKS!""

Next question, ""well can I please get a chicken bbq pizza?"" Without missing a beat, ""$9 how do you plan on paying for that!?""

First, We asked for suggestion on drinks and her response was ""I don't know you, so I don't know what to recommend"" and also we've been playing the machine and she didn't comp any of our drink! She said ""you're not playing enough so no free drinks!"" After putting more than $80!! She even told us that we're the one who's rude!!",BVKvLX5IG7EDIQjg9H1Mhg,3,0,1,isVlqaRMquOLNtH1DU0nfg

We waited over ten minutes and did not see one bartender, waitress or even a cook!  People were walking out. This PTS is a joke.  People were sitting there waiting for service and to pay. No one ever came out onto the floor. The bar was unattended for the ten minutes we waited and the guy next to us said it had been awhile since anyone was ever seen.",EoHdx-byYkY0X3low3-Rgg,2,0,1,AjMIWZF5yqU7MmlOFlbdmw

The bartenders that were serving us were friendly, kind, and sweet. The music playing in the background was awesome. Ordered the steak quesadilla which was delicious. We had such a great time we were there from 9pm to 2:30am! Nothing like enjoying a cigarette with your drinks and being able to converse with someone without feeling annoyed, uncomfortable, etc. What was great was the fact that it was close by to our homes. All in all, I had a great experience and look forward to coming back. Thank you",eguB3eXzLRK3h40Oi0Iw3g,1,0,5,7JYsCjK3VfcAXb-STnl4dA

I keep visiting this Joint every couple of month with the hope things will improve, but they never do.
The atmosphere is dumpy, the food is greasy, the service is so so.......sometimes better then worst.
Last night I experienced the straw that broke the camel's back, I asked for ranch dressings to go with my (very) greasy fries and was charged $1.25 for a single ounce of it.

Goodby PT's may we never meet again.",KCwfAJkgpi3-J1Es1qlLyg,1,0,2,1vkIzkmy-3_zyC9oUqF_Zw
