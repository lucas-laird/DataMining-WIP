1432171,2015-04-25,14,SJVrnBT80VtUScxxIofB-A,"I was hesitant about going here after reading the reviews for this place. But, a friend of mine told me that his favorite, most underrated spot for some Chinese food, is at this little deli right outside of the International Marketplace. I've been to the IM many of times, and have passed by this store a lot. But my friend is right, this place actually serves some pretty decent food.

So me and my buddy were talking about our favorite dim sum spots in town. He then shocked me by saying that there is a small store outside the International Marketplace that's making some pretty good dim sum. When the time came, (and you know it would happen sometime) I hopped, skipped, and jumped my way over here. Actually, I just drove.. but you get the picture.

It's a tiny store with a small display case, a hot foods buffet type section, and a holding case for all their roasted items. If you've even been to the deli at the 168 market, you will get the idea. The first time I came here, I had to try the dim sum. Each order of dim sum is around 2.29 or 2.75, which is really cheap by the way. For dim sum that has been sitting out on a steam table for a while, surprised to say, it was actually pretty decent. I wouldn't go out and say it's better than KJ's or anything, but it was good, and it was hella better than the 168 Market.

The next time I came here was to try their BBQ and roasted items. From my experience, the 168 market makes the best Honey BBQ pork in town. It probably has to do with the sauce. The one at F2G was a little bit too salty for my taste. But I will say that their roasted pork belly is miles better than the 168 market. The skin is nice and crispy (without being chewy), and it just plain tastes better. 

Foods 2 Go also has some foods that they can make a la minute. I've had the shrimp and wonton noodle soup, the beef chow fun, and the hainan chicken, and they were all pretty good, except that the chicken was a bit on the cold side.

I like this place, the location is centrally located and close to the Strip. The food is a lot better than the Panda, and so are the prices. I will continue to come here for a quick bite and some solid, affordable, well-made food. Wocka Wocka!",gtwM4ijo65AN4DvXdgCu_w,20,20,4,BvYqtUfKh8aW2VX4DV-N-w
1719928,2016-04-30,0,SJVrnBT80VtUScxxIofB-A,"Stopped by to do my shopping at international market and I got so hungry shopping around that I stopped at foods to go on my way out. I couldn't be more satisfied. I ordered very quickly, was even after three people. I was a little hot and went to step outside. Didn't even make it before my wife it was ready! Lighting fat service and the employees were happy and having a good time. I am in a food coma. It was plentiful, and much more delicious than expected. The stuffed buns are amazing. Very moist. The plates are a good price(lookout panda) and the wonton soup are a real treat. Make extra time your next stop by here because it is a must.",H0sRirabPHMsxw0WfyfhTQ,0,1,5,RLp2myw8AXVf7IpCYGWZ7A
1920088,2017-12-21,0,SJVrnBT80VtUScxxIofB-A,"Really good! I got there 5:30 pm. They close at 6 pm but were already taking items out of the window, preparing to close. I had to order quickly before there was nothing left to choose. They sell 1, 2, 3 item combos which comes with rice or noodles. But since they were wrapping up, they only had rice, which is actually what I wanted. I got their chicken curry, it was moderately spicy, tasted like a Singapore style curry, very very tasty. The 1 item combo was $5.99 and I got their chicken rice wrapped in lotus leaf, 2 for $2.99. That was amazing! I skipped the bao which were $2.99 each. The bao were on the large side, but that's pretty expensive for bao, unless you know it's going to be good. It's really a to-go place but across the foyer of the Int'l Foods entryway they also have a small dining area. I'll be back and can't wait to try other hot items and a few of their dim sum.",EDmBPBxg5i6pWSxbWMaVFA,0,0,4,4V0p8W7r_bbHSlfZqMnSKA
1993521,2015-08-26,5,SJVrnBT80VtUScxxIofB-A,"Cheap, good dim sum takeout? A girl can dream! Selection here is very limited, heavy on the buns, and sits under heat lamps for who-knows-how-long.  Service was a bit lacking.

I was disappointed with the selection, but they apparently can't (or wouldn't) make a fresh order. Employee present was unable to name a few of the dishes- not that she couldn't translate them to English, she couldn't tell me what the shrimp dish was because she didn't cook it! Prices are low, but your expectations should be, too. Majority of positive reviews are actually for non-dim-sum items, so maybe I'll have to give up on those offerings. 

I'll give this spot another try the next time I'm at the International Market, hopefully the selection and service will both improve.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,6,3,3,fMgq_EbsUU45RTvst6T9Wg

I've been here multiple times, and will still be coming back. I love their wonton soup and soi gaw noodle. Don't forget their dim sium, they are delicious. Although I wish they have chairs and tables where people can sit and enjoy, but it's not bad if you plan on taking it with you with the comfort in our own home.",gH3B42lDH_lkwQfkZB7U4A,1,0,4,MR9k9MlIeeYrT-YjEPFXVw
2323060,2014-09-22,1,SJVrnBT80VtUScxxIofB-A,Small hole in the wall Chinese joint right outside the International Marketplace. They sell mostly Chinese BBQ and combo mix plates Panda Express style. The food here is dirt cheap but is hit or miss depending on what you get. I'd stick with the BBQ combos though because the other food was ok. They also have dim sum items but I didn't try any. The dining area across from the restaurant is small and kind of dirty. I would only eat here again when coming to the International Marketplace...definitely not worth making a trip specifically here. Stick to Panda!,zBi_JWB5uUdVuz3JLoAxGQ,1,1,3,JFVylgWOhXtoVaiHPoxt1A
2898875,2012-05-10,3,SJVrnBT80VtUScxxIofB-A,"Sometimes, I love going grocery shopping, and seeking out the strangest things at the International Market.     Most of the times, I'm good with the Hawaiian and Japanese food items, and not to mention the Chrysanthemum teas for one of my friends.   Damn, she's drink that tea like how Adam Sandler's Zohan character can drink  fizzy buballah.  

But today, before I walked into the market, there was a new edition added called Food 2 Go at the front entrance.     

Curiosity caught me, and I had to buy roast pork anyway.   It's rather small takeout, and one thing for sure, this place is no Panda express, and more along the line of the deli at 168 Market.    I picked up some roast pork (7.50 lbs)  and decided not to buy a plate which was pretty cheap (2 choices and rice for 4.99).     

The counter girl wasn't Asian, but it didn't matter, because the cooks were all Chinese, and counter girl was totally cool.     

I'm starting to wonder why doesn't any Chinese takeout places like this in Las Vegas doesn't make any Rice Cakes?     I seen Rice cakes all over Chinatown Los Angeles, and Monterey Park.     Step it up Chinese restaurant owners in Vegas... I want some Rice Cakes!

When I made it back home, I set up the roast pork with a few vegetables, and made dinner out of it.   It  had enough flavor to stand on it own.  Not the best I ever had, but it was good.",ePWsbOWDTJcgIus-BFuKpg,3,3,3,zJ5mW72pjXccmlr06WwkVw

The only semi-decent part was the BBQ pork... And it was definitely not good enough to make me want to return-- ever! Just avoid the foods 2 go!",nipGPmPj966iLJQCf9P8tg,0,0,1,cf3MlozxSF6gJOHJuIPkoQ

3510176,2014-06-30,3,SJVrnBT80VtUScxxIofB-A,"For a quick bite after leaving the market I would definitely give this place a try.  I did however NOT like it the first time I came here over a year ago but decided to try it once more.  Pretty good! Nice pricing and I would probably recommend when ordering the dim sum try getting there before lunch time because when we did everything tasted as it would fresh out if the steamer.  I am definitely a fan, not 5 star raving fan but still I would come back and get some more food from them if in the area.  I would however recommend that they elaborate on the dim sum selection.  It was delicious but not much variety.",ssTOI7wBj5jJlBmBjr2bbA,3,3,3,ar_vjsoTFGkCHnpXG3h7eA
3762466,2015-04-11,3,SJVrnBT80VtUScxxIofB-A,Tasty and competitively priced dim sum. I thought the wonton soup with noodles was pretty good. The servings were generous. I would come back again if in the area.,XUEwSGOGARxW-3gPiGJKUg,3,3,3,J3Vwo2q-8k2u_3PPS1Ev1g

No restroom on sight and the view is their parking lot so not really for a date at any time unless you've been through thick and thin, this place is a very thin one for ya :D

Food quality is not really up there but if you want some quick cheap meal then come get em. There meal plate start at $6 and the amount of food is like 2 meals for me. Their roasted duck is real oily (usually the case if you're not an expert on roasted duck) their shrimp Shumai is good, Hagow is not (rice wrap is too thick)",a3yOeL5b0lzbo1ORHF2yHg,1,1,3,vwolHLMfEegRR3TC6ikf_w
