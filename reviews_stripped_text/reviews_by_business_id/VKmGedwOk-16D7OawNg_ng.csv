The sushi was, unsurprisingly, made with fake crab meat. Coffee is not offered here. 

The service people here are not pleasant to interact with.

If you're only in it for the price, this is the place for you. If you want good Asian food, I suggest you try elsewhere.

We were not disappointed. The worn door handle and entry door let us know right off this was an area favorit.  With our Senior discount, we paid $33.28 for their Sunday Seafood Buffet...compare that to $80.+tax at the upscale M Casino and Spa's weekend dinner seafood buffet which limited choices to crablegs, raw oysters and shrimp...no lobster or calamari. Buffet Asia had every imaginable seafood piled high....freshly made and tasty. In addition there  was a huge section devoted to sushi and sashimi plus deserts, salads and fresh fruits. Service was excellent and the environment clean. From the pleasant cashier to the cost of our dinner, to the delicious array of seafoods and cleanliness of the restaurant, to the courteous waiter who efficiently removed plates so we had room for our next dish and kept our drink glasses filled, we had a wonderful dinner in this local, family dinner out restaurant.  When in Las Vegas, skip the flashy Strip with their high prices and enjoy the Sunday seafood dinner at Buffet Asia. My only complaint is the d√©cor was blan.

Surprisingly, the sushi is not bad at all for buffet style, and they have most of your basic sushi rolls.  If you are needing a sushi fix for on the cheap, this is your place.  Just be aware that the sushi is nothing fancy, just your basic, standard rolls and nigiri (California Rolls and the like).  

The crab legs are another reason I frequent Buffet @ Asia, but there have been a few times lately they have been very soft and bendy on the outside, and difficult to crack open.  And everyone knows that eating crab legs can be kind of a lengthy meal in itself, so prying the bendy legs open can be kind of frustrating.  Also, I have been there once for lunch right as they opened, and their cream cheese wontons were dried out and didn't have any cream cheese filling on the inside....like they reheated leftovers and left them way too long in the oven....disappointing because I looooove cream cheese wontons.

They have your standard Asian buffet foods like Fried Rice, Orange Chicken, and Lo Mein, but they also have more unusual items like Frog Legs (which, I found out, do taste a lot like chicken....).

The thing with Chinese food...it's pretty much hit or miss.  There are so many versions of Chinese food...be it Cantonese or Mandarin, or what-have-you, that there is no set way a dish is supposed to be cooked.  What I love about buffets is you can try a little bit of everything.  A little bit of this, a little bit of that.  So, if you walk in here with a mind-set of tackling down their sweet-and-sour chicken or their wonton soup...be prepared for a big disappointment, becuase you're probably going to compare it the way another restaurant does it.

I go to buffets to satisfy my seafood cravings.  I go for their weekday dinners because that's when all the good stuff comes out, without the extra charges of the weekend.

Luckily I was able to find it due to having previously reviewed it. However, I was alarmed by all the recent negative reviews! I was concerned it may have been overtaken by ogres who know nothing about customer service! After some deliberation I decided to chance it and hope the servers don't eat the little ones that are in our group of seven.

We arrived on Monday at 1145. We were promptly seated. Having read many a reviews I was very interested to see if I spot any sour faced employees.  As I was stuffing my mouth with the delicious stir fried string beans and salt and pepper shrimp, I did manage to spot a smile-less server! However, that was more than countered by the other 4 smiling waiters and waitresses I had spotted, not to mention the smiling kitchen workers that were bringing out more fresh, delicious food.

Bottom line is, your mileage may very, I am sure. But for this San Diegan that frequents vegas no more than three times a year, at 9 bucks for adults and kids price in the 4s, with soda priced at 95 cents, buffet asia hits the spot. I am gladly tipping 20% for their prompt removal of our plates and the quick multiple refills for me who drink like a horse, and we are on our way back to mandalay bay to relax by the water.

This time was no different. Despite the reviews on Yelp this place got Best of Las Vegas (at least if my memory serves me right) so we decided to try it. It was at a premium price, for this place, around $16 for the weekend seafood buffet. We went on Saturday night, no wait but extremely busy. Service was poor, I had to track someone down when I wanted a drink refill and in the middle of dinner they took my soy sauce away. I thought to fill it or exchange and bring it back, but no it was just gone.  They had less selection of Chinese food than I expected, maybe because there was more seafood. A lot of people were eating the snow crab, but that is just way too much work for me for so little reward, I am a king crab or nothing kind of girl unless it is already cracked open. They also had salt and pepper frog legs, which was different, although I didn't try it. The only thing that I liked was some sort of seafood medly on a shell with a baked on mayonnaise sauce. I recently saw a poster that bacon was the duct tape of food, and if that is so I think mayonnaise is like the glue - it helps quite a bit to repair food that would otherwise lack in flavor. They had a small sushi bar, and it was well meh - I guess I should be thankful there was any sushi, and there were a few different kinds - tako, salmon, tuna, eel, a number of norimaki rolls. The rolls were okay. Also, I tried the white fish but I wasn't sure what type of white fish it was, maybe Tilapia, but it really wasn't that good. They had salt and pepper squid, which again was okay.  So yes - overall I would say, some items were okay at best but I won't ever be coming back.",xECpt0seSDbTmt1mGcfffA,0,0,2,wFIPt3ST8rIC8ZieZzabjg

It was my mother's birthday last sunday, 25th, and of course she wanted to eat at Buffet @ Asia and  her friends and coworkers even celebrated with us. 

I noticed a couple changes! Good changes. One, they had more varieties of sushi which was cool because I love sushi. However, the sushi is okay, but nothing like wow!

Second, they were serving cut pieces of lobster tails (everyone was going crazy). 

Third, it isn't a soft served ice cream machine anymore. They have real ice cream that you can scoop out yourself - your choice of chocolate, strawberry, or vanilla. 
Sorry no gelato ice cream either or this place would be more pricey!

1159044,2011-06-16,0,VKmGedwOk-16D7OawNg_ng,"For what it is, Buffet at Asia is half-way decent.

It's definitely not the greatest Asian buffet, or any buffet, but it gets the job done. There are a variety of ""Asian"" favorites, mainly Chinese. Ya know, sweet and sour chicken, fried rice, egg rolls, bbq pork, pot stickers, orange chicken, etc. Beyond the Chinese food there are a variety of other ""Asian"" foods like sushi and pad thai.

But everybody goes in for the snow crab legs. I mean, market price for these bad boys is definitely at, if not more, than the cost of entry to B@A. Actually, any of the seafood [frog legs, crab legs, lobster tail, shrimp, fish, you name it, they probably have it] is pretty good.

If soup's your game, they have a few types [wonton, egg drop, oxtail] that are worth a try.

Desserts were a little transparent. Beyond ice cream [traditional chocolate, vanilla, mix], the desserts weren't too good. The fruit, which Asian restaurants are notorious for, were weak. I saw a couple melons, grapes, and berries...and they weren't that good.

Service isn't anything to write on a postcard, but it got the job done. No small talk, no smiles, no anything. Just cleaning tables, refilling drinks, then goodbye.

There was a nice sushi selection; and nice selection of seafood (shrimp, salmon, frog legs, crab), a mongolian grill (you choose what you want and staff cooks it), the usual asian fare and soups, fresh fruit & chocolate for dipping, soft serve as well. 

The building is an older one and the decor is old. But you're not there to eat either so it doesn't really matter to me. This buffet does offer take-out but be warned- they weigh you container to make sure it's not over 2 lbs. No joke, I saw the scale by the register.

Buffet Asia doesn't hide what it is. It is an affordable, decent buffet plain and simple.

The food is decent and for the price you pay, I'd say it is more than worth it. Regarding the foot traffic, service, attentiveness - it is something you can expect from a very busy place. But anyone who has eaten here knows how it goes. You get there, you get your class of water / softdrink and you have to assume it will be a while before you get a refill. 

But still, the food is good, it is all you can eat at a price lower than most places. If you get a bunch of experienced go-ers and eat there, then the experience is good.",NWJYydOUPmL5it7Dmz43qg,0,0,4,a3jnz-mz6Xn42iyQJ-EELQ

As for the food: greasy, limp, over salted, slimy, and with the cheapest grade materials. 

The sushi bar simply consists of a dozen different presentations of a California roll- only two perhaps had a smear of fish. 

Drinks not included.

5 stars for the dinner price of $16.95 at today's prices.
4 stars for having lobster in a $16.95 AYCE dinner price. Don't get too excited. They're just pieces of lobster tail amongst large crab pieces. 
2 stars for cleanliness of the dining areas and the buffet area.
4 stars for having beef/oxtail soup exactly the way my mom used to make it (Filipino style)
2 stars for service. Friendliness and courtesy, not their thing.
1 star for the experience of dining with the other customers. It was super annoying. I can't generalize that everyone who dines here is annoying. But the night we ate there, this was the overwhelming majority. And my parents like eating here, yet they say it's always like that there. What was so annoying? Large parties with undisciplined kids running around with no supervision or correction. People literally standing in front of the lobster pot waiting for them to replenish it. Seriously? Social graces much?
There are a lot of selections. Remember this is an AYCE for $16.95 dinner. You might overlook some of the low scores. 
Skip the sushi. Don't waste your calories on that. Having the crabs, crabs & lobster, fish and beef/oxtail soup, are well worth your money, and enough to pay a return visit, I suppose.
You decide what my scores mean to you. 
I don't know yet if I'd return, but I'm not completely opposed to it. I just don't like eating while stressed and annoyed. And the other patrons can't help themselves.",NkE-ORKVsdVAtwOGuBsbsw,5,1,3,P098EHk106tvjTI8s2S1lA

The decor, and cleanliness can be a little bit better. First off the price was 8$ lunch, 13$ dinner. For what they offer, it is a steal, compared to other asian buffets.  My favorites are the beef tenderloin; juicy and soft. the mussels, baked with mayo and cheese, its like a heart attack waiting to happen, but its so goood. they have frog legs, and they are actually pretty good. wings are ok, but everyone seems to horde the crab leg station, i never do because I am allergic to it. Mostly typical buffet food, they do try to copy the PF Changs, lettuce wraps, and FAIL, i have no gripe about that, because it's not PF Changs, it's a buffet, i have no time to wrap lettuce..im there to EAT. anyways, the real steal of the buffet is, sushi. It's awesome, impressive even. Figure this, if you get an 8 pc roll at other places and they are all the same, it would cost you maybe 7-9$. well you pay 8$ lunch, but could get one piece of each. So it definitely is worth it, even if you just went for Sushi.

I'm not entirely sure if the management has changed throughout the years, but whoever hired these waiters and the grill master must not have taken their applications seriously. 

My first bad experience happened the second I was seated. The waiter rolled his eyes at my party members for taking a little while on deciding what they wanted to drink. He was paying so little attention to us that he even got 2 out of 6 drinks wrong.

Second, I remembered how much I used to love making my own Mongolian barbeque because of how friendly the old grill master used to be... however, not quite this time. I had to call him twice just to get his attention and he definitely ignored me both times because after the third time I asked him to make my order spicy, he told me to go and grab the sauce myself. Sorry grill master, but no tip for you this time.

Lastly, the same waiter that made a fuss about getting my drinks was taking my plates away. This time, this guy manages to spill all the pot sticker sauce all over my table and on my girlfriend's seat while she was gone. The guy never apologized and just simply up and left our table in a mess.

Needless to say I didn't tip these bastards one cent for their horrid service. I would've been better off getting my own drink and making my own barbeque.

They had a wide variety of rolls including spicy tuna, shrimp, eel, as well as rolls wt the orange fish eggs & various rolls wt spicy sauce. All were fresh and very good. The wasabi was kicking as well.

 Other stations offered your basic chinese fare such as brocoli & beef, whole fried shrimp, baked mussels wt cheese, Lo Mein, Fried Rice, sauted green beans, spring rolls etc.

There was also a station wt a chef to cook items to order & Tempura broccoli, sweet potatoes etc. And the price was right = $7.56 total. The desert offerings seemed kind of pedestrian & I grabbed a little muffin of some sort to eat on my walk afterwards & it was pretty good.

I will commend this place on their fast service. I have eaten at this place on several occasions and my drink never stays empty for long, and they always clear dirty plates very quickly. 
Beware... this restaurant is pretty small. So if you have a large party (like groups of 8 or more), it might be difficult to find a table to sit together.

Dinner (weekend) - My husband likes it because the price is reasonable for AYCE. He likes the snow crabs, and the salt and pepper dungeness crabs. He also likes the frog legs, buttered shrimp, Manila clams, oysters, oxtail soup, tomyun, and Mongolian barbecue. I find the food salty for my taste. I eat the lobster tails (you have to elbow your way to the lobster tail area or stand and wait for a new batch which comes in every 15 to 20 minutes) and sushi but secretly throw away the rice (and yes...I feel guilty thinking of the many hungry people but my stomach cannot tolerate too much rice).

Yes, I have to admit that the variety was a little lacking, but the taste wasn't bad at all.

For the price, at around $8/per person for lunch, it really isnt a bad deal, except that price doesnt include drinks, so you would either have to just drink water, or pay an extra dollar or two for a soft drink. But for people who aren't a fan of soft drinks, or extra calories may I say, I thought it was good that they seperated the cost of food and drinks!

Moving on to the food, although the sushi wasn't the best selection, and most of the of course weren't of raw fish, it was pretty decent. This is one of the Asian buffets that actually had sushi and soup that I wouldn't complain about, and most of the time, these are the two big failures at these type of buffets. 

Due to the cheap price tag, wait does take a while though. At arpund 2pm on a Saturday afternoon, the wait was nearly an hour.

My wife and I tried the Rainbow location a year or so ago and it was absolutely revolting.

Perhaps I am picky because I come from Australia where we can get amazing Chinese food (sort of like how in the US you can get great Mexican due to the proximity to Mexico). The fact that I don't eat fish or seafood of any kind didn't help either - The place was VERY heavy on the seafood.  Vegetarians won't he happy either, unless you are one of those fake ""vegetarians"" that thinks fish are vegetables.

The final nail in the coffin for us about this place where the signs on the walls saying that due to wastage, if you left any food on your plate you would be CHARGED EXTRA FOR IT! I mean -really- part of the beauty of a buffet is that you get to OWN the food and decide what to eat. I don't want to have to clean up my plate for fear of trouble with the management.

There are a ton of Asian type dishes, though most of them are Chinese-ish.  Although there is not a lot a meat present, there is enough to keep the carnivoures at bay.  The real key is that the vegetables are done fairly well, such as the asparagus and the brocolli.  One must be healthy when eating 4,000 calories in one sitting.  Eat the ""sushi"", but just remember... $8.95.  So don't get excited when you get a little tummy ache later.

There is pretty much everything standard in an AYCE Chinese buffet such as dumplings, egg flower, hot and sour wonton soups, broccoli beef, kung pow, steamed / fried rice, chow mein, sushi (think fake crab roll and some tuna type rolls), salad bar, fruits (canned type), teriyaki chicken, korean bbq, Mongolian grill, chicken and mushroom... well you get the idea.

It was all the way past the Strip and into a very urban area that reminded me of my hometown.  The place stood out like a Outback Steakhouse around the corner of my house, so it was sort of easy to find.

When we entered, the place greeted me with it Korean employees and promptly sat me down, which is a plus in my book.  The employee was a young guy, probably in his late 20's taking our order for drinks.  When he asked us all, I suddenly looked around and saw a bunch of alcoholic drinks, especially sakes and soju (korean version of alcohol, a sweeter version of vodka).  My friend and i ordered some drinks and we all sat up and went to get our food.  The buffet had a lot of different types of foods like korean bbq, sushi of all kinds (mostly typical ones like california rolls), a lot of seafood options like king crab legs and such, and a LOT of desserts too.

My opinion is average (3 stars) for this restaurant.  Average food, but with many selections that anyone can like.  But, the option for the drinks are rare, especially in buffets.

Service
Refills on water and soda

Oxtail Pho (when there's actual oxtail and not a dish of broth and bones)

Takes a while for things to be refilled at the different stations

It's packed with other families and that is how you know the place is deliciously legit, right?? 

Tonight was my third time here but second time for dinner. We came in around 5pm and were quickly seated 5 minutes after we paid. When we came for lunch it was a 10-15 minute wait for a table of 7.

My favorite food selections here would have to be their egg rolls (full of veggies & crisp), fried rice (fresh and full of different veggies, even ham and egg) and the endless variety of sushi (their soy sauce is just terribly salty). 
For desert they have 8 different selections of ice cream, it's not soft and just perfect for sensitive teeth. Every time we come I fit their sugary donuts somewhere in between plates. It is so good. It is usually near the beef broccoli (beef is terrible - just get the broccoli). 

The only downfalls I have about here is their crabs (I lOVE CRAB) and it's so small that you shouldn't bother with trying to get meat out. There is barely any in there. Plus I ate their shrimp and noticed they didn't clean the poop line. Eww. Beware.

This Buffet @ Asia location reflects the hard work of employees in making this location safe for the public. Make no mistake: not all locations are the same. Be wary of the other ones!

The service up front and table side is pleasant. You must pay prior to seating and no refunds are made once the transaction has completed. A gratuity is charged for parties over 8, but they check waters often enough and the waiters/servers never stop moving. 

The food is par and not over the top. There isn't a flavor that stands out and it's pretty standard. It's what you expect at any Asian buffet place. Panda's express makes this location seem sub-par, but I'm sure others might frown upon my opinion. 

Drinks are not free. They cost $0.95 which is not a bad deal, but maybe you might want it for the Chinese tea. The restaurant also has a sushi bar and soft serve machine.

Large portion of dishes is mainly East and SouthEast Asian with emphasis on seafood. So your getting a good value for the food that is being offered. They have a nice hibachi grill station where your able to create your own Stir Fry. Great for those looking for something different and fresh with the option of soy sauce and spicy sauce flavoring. They have a sushi station but I would rather go to an actual Japanese restaurant since a lot of the sushi taste like they've been sitting out. Some of the items I do enjoy is the Manila Clams and Crab Legs. Others are pretty much a hit and miss. 

It's constantly busy and they have a large wait staff, so the turnover is quick. Do plan ahead especially during the busy weekend and holiday seasons. The inside is still stuck in the 90's and could use a modern looked but for now it's a decent buffet.

+ Large selection of food.  There's plenty of options.  They even have Pizza, although I don't recommend it....it's an Asian Buffet for Pete's sake!

+ Decent service.  This place is always busy and they usually keep up with the pace.  Food is generally kept stocked on the food lines and the servers keep the glasses full.

+ Food quality is OK for a buffet.  It's not great, but hell it's AYCE.....this isn't the Bellagio Buffet.

+ Price.  The price use to be really good, but they've been steadily increasing prices over the past couple of years.....but still, $6.99 for a lunch buffet?!  That's pretty cheap in my book.

- Parking.  Parking is a bitch when it's busy.....it's not the restaurant's fault though and my Star Rating doesn't reflect this....just saying, FYI.

Overall, it's pretty good value.  If you don't like waiting, I suggest going in between meal periods when it's slower than peak times.

My Aunt and I decided to speak to the cashier once again, who then called the female worker who told me she was the manager.

We were greeted and paid first (new policy) I guess there were a lot of people that just gets up from their table and pretends to be using the restroom but actually leaving. Anyways, not a big deal...

My hubby goes and gets some rice and what did he find in there? HAIR...he told one of the workers and the worker quickly took the pot and said thank you.  So, it's a good thing that she acknowledged.  Ok, so we thought it was over.  I go up to their fresh vegetable stir-fry area where the guy does it in front of you.  I picked my veggies (bean sprouts etc...) and shrimp and handed it to him...went and grabbed some of the food and headed back to him to pick up my stir-fried veggies and headed back to my table to enjoy this food.  I have been craving for this veggies all day...I'm about to dig in and what do I find? HAIR!!! AGAIN!!!  Is it booby trap day for us???  I took it to the guy and he said it's from the bean sprouts...I said no, it's not and I actually picked it up with my fork and showed him.  He didn't apologize but asks me if I wanted another one...I don't think so! 

After all this happened, we kind of lost our appetite but we paid $50 for our freaking dinner!  So we were just careful of what we were putting in our mouth, sigh...  

While we were having dinner, my son had to go to restroom so hubby took him. While they were in there, one of the workers came in to use the restroom, he went pee, and blew his nose in his hands and just rinsed his finger tips off and left...that is freaking GROSS!!!!!

Confused, I go up to the host stand and ask for a manager to get the drink I ordered.  I don't think it was a manager that helped me out because she said if it was something she can take care of rather than a manager.  She comes and talks to the waitress and then comes back to my table and in front of my family, tells me that I need to drink all of it before I can order something else or be charged for another drink.  Out of our huge party maybe three ordered water, so I asked if they can get regular (not diet) Coke and I'll just drink it and she said no.

It was just me and my 3yr old nephew, yet they called out and seated numbers that were after us. (They lose an entire STAR for that tacky sh!t right, a potential 4STAR rating is still achievable right? NO, HELLS NAH)

We were finally seated, I promise it looked like a feeding frenzy in there.  I'm a sushi fan, it just looked very contaminated, people breathing over it, no please make my Sushi in front of me Thank You much.  This buffet over somewhat of a variety of dishes, but standard Chinese buffet fare.  You know the staples: orange chicken, beef broccoli, chow mien, egg drop soup, pizza, etc, etc.

Empty tins w/ no food, granted it was busy in there and maybe they could not keep up with the demand but when they did food did come out it was enough for like 5 people.  Some dished were piping hot and others were luke warm.  I'll just comment on the items I DID eat:

Orange Chicken: ok, I didn't eat this but I had to comment on this, Orange Chicken is my go to  item when I go to these type of buffet. Um, Orange Chicken is not suppose to be SOUPY.  I cannot make this up, it looked like orange chicken soup, NO BUENO.

Chow Mien: hmm, greasy, no crunch to the veggies

Baked Mussel: it was ok, mussels were minced with some kind of cream cheese and melted cheddar cheese on top

Fried Butterfly Shrimp: can't go wrong with this, its boxed shrimp, yum yum good :-)

Green Beans: greens beans are my fav, um yea they were greasy too and limp, no snap

Peppered Chicken: that was decent, but the jalapenos took over my pallet so I had to pick around it

Crab Ragoons and Egg Rolls: once again you cannot go wrong w/ fried foods

Pot Stickers: dough was gummy, at the edges it was hard as if they had been sitting out for a long time

Pizza: this is my little dudes favorite, he can eat 3 regular slices...he ate 1 slice and picked at the other slice

Sweet and Sour Chicken: no need for the sauce because the chicken was hard as HELL, another item  that had been sitting out way too long.  needles to say that was not consumed

Friend Chicken Wings: I didn't eat them, but my kid enjoyed them.  I'll say it again,  you cannot go wrong w/ fried foods

the SERVICE: BAD enough said (-2STARS for bad service)

Overall, food was not even So-So, I've had better, HELL - we've ALL had better. $25.97 for $5.00 buffet food.  I'm so done

So, we will not be back to this establishment, and I will take my mom ""The Chinese Food Buffer Connoisseur"" somewhere else.

Although not legendary by any means, this buffet is a perfect cost to quality ratio. The after tax, before tip cost for lunch is around $17.00 including a beverage. The excellent sushi, crab legs and other seafood measure up.

Some exotic things you may find are crispy fried frog legs (tell your friend they're chicken wings), crispy fried squid (was a little over-cooked, but still tasty if you stick with tentacles) and a menagerie of shelled seafood prepared in a number of ways.

To be fair, a lot of the items they offer are garbage, but they have just enough good items to allow you to satisfactorily bypass these items of questionable quality.

Our server provided excellent service. Amusingly, although she had an otherwise thick accent, she could say ""you're welcome"" with absolutely no accent at all!

For those wanting to avoid touristy buffets with inflated prices for the same quality, this is a great place to try.",gaacXSHULOojH_-rKWXFZA,1,1,4,UwJxMvnBLVRyLu0JEBjlgA

We go here at least a dozen times a year. There is a pretty nice selection of food from your typical asian starches to the flavorful meats. My favorite is the beef tenderloins, the oxtail soup, the sauteed shrimp with snow peas, and their ginger lobster. Everything else is pretty decent too. The sushi isn't terrible, but it should definitely NOT be the main focus of your meal.

They have a pretty nice Mongolian station too, they stir fry up fresh veggies, meats, and aromatics into one plate. Get it with extra garlic and spicy!

Service is fast and wonderful, which is VERY refreshing for your typical Asian buffet. The refills are ALWAYS fast, and they actually smile and respond when you thank them. 

I will continue to dine here with family and friends because it's a great spot to hang out for delicious food.

Good Chinese food. Decent price. Great selection. Better than most Asian buffets. About $9 for lunch, not including drinks. Prices for dinner differ on weekends. Your food will be hot and seasoned well. The sushi bar is just a decent alternative to Chinese food.  Nothing spectacular about the sushi. This place is always busy so food is constantly coming out. Teriyaki chicken, steamed gingered fish, and potstickers are my favorite. As for service, the employees seem to be working themselves to the bone, especially during lunch and dinner hours. Your dirty plates will be gone in the blink of an eye and your drinks won't go empty. Be selective with your plates and utensils as they are always a bit wet and dirty......

I've been to this buffet so many times that I already know what I want and where its at.  Sushi is not the freshest here, some days I skip it if it looks like it'll give me a tummy ache.  Oysters also have their off days when they're lacking sheen.. But hey, at least it is always available and I have the option of choosing whether I want to eat it.

I'm always amused at how people go cray-cray for lobster there.  People are like vultures waiting for the lobster lady to drop a new serving off and within 5 minutes everythings gone!  I always get lucky and get some lobster as they're refilling, but if you aren't so lucky, don't fret! They refill the tray just as quick.

I also like getting their salt & pepper crab, oxtail soup, mushrooms, fish, and fried chicken wings.  
And I like making my own chow mein at their Mongolian grill. **add garlic and ask for it SPICY! Super yummy!

I can't say I ever hated it, but I never returned for a couple reasons: I dislike buffets, mediocre food, and rude people. This has basically remained true of this establishment.

My parents are celebrating their 36th anniversary and my mom really wanted crab. So that is how I ended up here last Sunday night for their Seafood Dinner Buffet ($15/person).

My first thoughts upon walking in is that it's crowded, cramped, and smells old. None of the staff were particularly friendly and the patrons were rude and lacked the manners and etiquette necessary for small buffet spaces. Definitely not my happy place. 

The selections for me were minimal. I found solace in the Calamari, Spicy Chicken, White Rice, Schezwan Green Beans, Saut√©ed Mushrooms and vegetables picked out of other dishes. I really liked the Spicy Chicken because it had a black bean sauce, but beware, it is very spicy. The calamari was not fresh, however, I liked the large pieces and preparation. Everything else wasn't bad. I also enjoyed the Cream Cheese Wantons, but they definitely weren't as good as I remembered. I tried the Grilled Chicken, Lobster, Spicy Crab, and Crispy Shrimp, but did not like any of them. The lobster was just gross, the shrimp was non-existent in its crispy form, and the crab was just okay. Nothing tasty. My mom REALLY enjoyed the Spicy Crab and my dad and fianc√© seemed to enjoy their selections (the fianc√© was satisfied with Fried Noodles, Grilled Chicken, and Mushrooms - his favorite foods).

If my parents try to convince me to come here again, I may give in, but not without a few groans and complaints. But, my return is still very unlikely. There are MUCH better eateries for all foods found here that are not horribly priced when quality and taste is taken into consideration.

Besides the typical China Star Buffet located on the central strip, there are dozens of other oriental options to choose from in Vegas, on and off the strip. To reach the Chinese area travel west of the strip on the street called Spring Mountain, between Sahara and Flamingo. The banquet begins just a few blocks from the casinos. There are Chinese seafood restaurants, Dim Sum places, Malaysian, Vietnamese, Korean and even some full fledged Chinese grocery stores, up and down the street. But one of the things I always keep my open for when it comes to Las Vegas, are buffets. And my absolute favorite find was Buffet Asia, a ten minute drive west of Chinatown, just off Sahara on Pleasant Street.

For three days we asked the local Chinese what the best place in town was and uniformly they recommended this place. I was skeptical at first, for one; because in my experience the best Chinese restaurants are never outside of the Chinese area, and two, the name was suspiciously non Chinese (the best places always have weird translations like ABC Seafood). But Buffet Asia was the real thing. The buffet set us back about $15 for adults and half that for kids on a Saturday night, this place was well worth it, starting with a well stocked sushi table, abundant in tuna, salmon, clam and eel sushi plus some very creative rolls. Following that are the soups (wonton, miso, hot & sour, and egg drop corn), not as good as made-to-order but for a buffet they were excellent. But don't fill up on those items because next comes the many traditional main dishes, like snow crab legs (both steamed and fried in garlic), orange chicken, sweet and sour shrimp, oysters, frogs legs, spicy green beans, Chinese vegetables in sauce and many more. My favorites were the clams in black bean, the soy sauce fish, and the lobster in supreme sauce. By the time I was done with all that I was stuffed, and I hadn't even gone to the Mongolian barbeque yet, which offered fresh (not frozen) meats and seafood including thick cut Korean style short ribs, squid steaks, and fresh shrimp. Tea, non-alcoholic drinks, and dessert are included in the price.

So if you are tired of the same old food in Las Vegas and you don't want to break the pattern by breaking the bank at one of the name restaurants on the strip, then I recommend a trip into the interior to check out the local Chinese fare. It turned out to be a real treat for me.",S7VG3vBUtJDLKX_ewbc15A,1,3,4,vzMBqArMrM_nBKUZP0S-Tw

That's generally a good sign, so I decided to give it a chance.

Well, I have to honestly say that I was not all that impressed. The place did look clean, there was a wide variety of food, however the food was just The run-of-the-mill Chinese food.

I personally think it was Packed because there was a lot of food, but not necessarily because of the quality of the food.

I paid $10, and that's exactly the quality of food I received. It's good for a quick meal but I don't think I will be coming back.",cRDQuBEgxaYQoSPHAiEgHQ,0,1,3,VTrT0Mk6Y7Pr2efk5FtPLw

The food variety is really good in my opinion. And the sushi they serve is good too. The price for it all during lunch is reasonable.

My only huge con about this place is that a few times my waiters would take foreverrr to fill up my table's drinks. And i know they saw our table because i would watch them until they fill it up. So the service there is pretty crappy. They really need to fix that :P

Another con is their booth chairs. Alot of them have a deep dent in it and it makes me feel creeped out and uncomfortable to sit on them. The last time i went there, they had gotten new cushions for their booth chairs, however they were a little bit stiff and hard.

Overall, i still eat atleast once every two months. I can overlook the cons a bit; so i still go there since the asian restaurant closest to my house sucks big time!",lQORK1x2dT19rWAhF-pn8w,1,1,3,D2MMlsFBmotzj-xzVPKXTg
4974733,2009-06-30,4,VKmGedwOk-16D7OawNg_ng,"Buffet @ Asia is a place that has never peaked my interest until recently when a family member raved about their Sunday dinner.    

Come Sunday, and you have three ravenous individuals who just came from biking outside in the 107 degree Vegas weather.  (Yeah, we're crazy.)

We walked in around 5 pm, and there's already a line.  Straight to the register, $15.99/pp (adults) and we're seated at a table.  

There's a Mongolian BBQ station - you pick your veggies and meat and they cook it up on this giant flat stove thing for you.  (We all skipped this, which might explain why we never saw the kalbi short ribs everyone else talked about. Damn.)

Sushi - They have a bunch of random rolls with lots of sauce and stuff and some salmon sashimi.  That was something we all avoided as well.

Seafood - green mussels, baked scallops (my friend wasn't sure if there was scallop in there b/c they mix it up with stuff and cover it up with sauce), jumbo hot shrimp (old), cooked cold shrimp (fresh, and not overly cooked - over by the salad bar section), oysters on the half shell (big ones - okay, a bit too 'milky' for me), lobster, salt and pepper crab (not the freshest), snow crab legs (we mostly ate this and a lot of it, with drawn butter), deep-fried frog legs (old), deep-fried calamari (okay), baked salmon, clams (pretty good), and I'm sure a few other things I overlooked.  (There was no crawfish though, unfortunately!)

Cooked items - stir-fried strings beans (I ate a lot of this), mixed veggies with shrimp, beef and broccoli, fried rice, steamed rice, asparagus, potstickers (skin was old), crab ragoons, eggrolls, deep-fried chicken wings, etc.

Soup - wonton soup, oxtail soup, egg drop soup.

Dessert - fresh fruit and marshmallows for dipping into chocolate, egg custard tarts (blah), almond cookies, soft serve, almond jello with fruit cocktail, mango mousse, sesame balls, malasadas (would be better if they were hot), tapioca, and a few other things.

Service is super attentive, especially in clearing plates.  They greet you right away with beverage orders and it's not to hard to wave them down for refills, extra napkins, shell crackers, etc.

Overall, you really can't complain about the price.  We went on one of their more expensive nights and I think we had enough crab to definitely surpass our money's worth.  You have to wonder how they even turn a profit.  Some of the food is just blah, but at least you can have a taste and never get more.  And then there's a handful of things that will have you returning for more.  It works for picky eaters too.  Their menu seems to be changing all the time, so you never know what you're gonna get!

Exterior: The building itself actually looks appealing and in good condition. There is a large parking lot so finding a space is usually not a problem. It's cross streets are Rainbow and Sahara, it is next to a diner which I will try soon.

Interior: When you open the first set of double doors there are a few coin operated toy machines to get your last couple quarters due to the kids nagging. After the second set of double doors you are inside the restaurant, the counter to your left is where you pay and get taken to your table from. The dining area is large and has a couple separate rooms so you don't feel overcrowded. There are 6 food serving areas in the middle of the buffet containing various food items to choose from, there is a long service area containing fruit and desserts with an ice cream machine next to it, there is another long service area containing a good variety of sushi, and lastly there is a grill area for all of your Mongolian bbq to be prepared. I heard there is a bar but I have not seen it.

Food: The food is average with nothing to get excited about but for less than $9 you really can't expect the best or complain. The various dishes in the middle of the buffet are usually hot and switched out regularly. The chow mein, chicken with jalapenos, cream cheese rangoon, and sushi is usually what I stick with. The sushi is actually decent for the price and has a lot of rolls to select. I got a spring roll yesterday and it was extremely greasy. I also got some of the butterfly fried shrimp and they were undercooked. Like I said the food is cheap and I will return when the wallet is light.

Service: The service is actually good. I always get seated quickly considering I always want a booth. The staff never let your drinks go empty and are constantly refilling them. Your finished plates are picked up in a timely manner, sometimes you get a glance if you leave a mountain of food like I have a couple times due to not liking it, but they don't charge you for wasting food so that's ok. 

I give it 3 stars due to the butterfly fried shrimp being undercooked and for waiting for close to 5 mins for the Mongolian bbq cook to show up, he didn't so I ended up leaving a bowl of uncooked food there.",iLaoGVj6x4kWW7xN34pOog,3,1,3,jNGNhSu-2cQSWaF--kBBYg

The Sunday lunch was a great value. We fed all ten of us for under a hundred dollars. They automatically add gratuity (13%) for parties larger than 8. The food is OK. Nothing really stands out, but nothing is really awful.

I'll usually make one trip for sushi, one trip to the Mongolian grill, one trip for whatever seafood (mussels, lobster, or crab) looks good, and one trip for dessert. Keep your eye on the sushi for items that look like they have been sitting around for a while.

A few observations I noticed while here:

While they did have a fairly diverse sushi line-up, regardless of the fish on top, or the sauces added, there was always the following three things inside each roll regardless: Cucumber, avocado, and crab.  Usually not bad, but it honestly made up the contents of each roll.

The hot and sour soup was not a great experience.  It was largely tasteless, other than there was a bit of hotness left tingling in your mouth.  I don't mind hot/spicy things, but when eating soup, I'd like for there to be a few other flavors involved other than ""I don't taste anything, yet my lips are tingling"".

I also noticed that some fellow named ""Bil"" took great pride in writing and carving his name all over the men's bathroom, going as far as to carve his name into the toilet seat.  I wonder if ""Bil"" really thought it through when he would eventually claim ownership of the results of people's bathroom visitations, but if it somehow helps to build his personal empire in ways that I simply cannot comprehend, then more power to him.

....

I guess.

The servers were good about removing plates, and the price isn't bad.  They have a Mongolian BBQ section, so big points for that, but I decided to attempt that for another visit.  For what it is, it's not bad, but the hot and sour soup is useless, and don't expect a lot of diversity in sushi choices there.

UPDATE: As of July 2009, ""Bil"" has been removed from the bathroom walls!  His empire has crumbled, and undoubtedly, those oppressed by his iron rule have been set free.  For the rest of you, you can do your business in peace without fear of claimage by ""Bil"".  I can only hope that his short-lived rule found enough glory for the historic archives of bathroom kingdoms.

5468723,2018-03-20,1,VKmGedwOk-16D7OawNg_ng,"Buffet @ Asia is a little inconsistent with the service. 
The policies can be very unclear, for example my father has a medical condition that does not allow him to eat very much at once and in the past they would allow him to purchase an ala cart take out box to eat while we dine, that way when he's full he can take the rest home. 

When we went for dinner earlier this week, we were told you were only allowed to purchase a take out box once you leave, which contradicts what we've been doing in the past. So basically he wasn't allowed to purchase the take out box and just opted for a regular dine in, an in the end only ate half of one plate which ultimately was a waste of money. I just wish they were more consistent with their policies, as we will no longer be able to eat there as a family.

Other than that, this is an okay buffet that decently priced.
I'm a little sketched out that they keep their Health Department grade on a bulletin board, all stacked up against the old ones so it's unclear which one is current. 

It can get super packed for dinner so you either get the choice of being squished like sardines with other diners in one of their dining rooms or sitting in the bar area that smells like the bathroom that's on the other side of the wall.

But ya... the eyes are always bigger than the stomach. So we overate, stuffed our faces, and stood by the ""no waste or you pay"" rule.

5603765,2017-07-20,1,VKmGedwOk-16D7OawNg_ng,"From my past experiences at this buffet establishment, I would have to say with all brutal honesty, this restaurant is horrid outside, inside and its customer service. The place is so filthy... if you happen to look at the rafters above the general seating area, not the overflow room in the back, you would see that there's so much dust and clinging from underneath it, on top of it and all over the neon light strips installed above it. The bathroom could do better as well, it's not so well lit, at times the floor would be soaking wet in some spots, they could install better sinks with better faucets, the same could go with their toilets. Their hibachi/ Mongolian Beef station could do with a better and competent cook. When I tell them to not add any spicy flavorings to my plate, they would do it anyway by way of not properly cleaning the skillet surface that they work on after each use. Their customer service could use a huge tweaking as well, by removing that ""We Reserve the Right To Refuse Service to Anyone"" sign behind their cashier booth and to properly re-train their servers to be polite and cordial to all customers. Remember the Customer is ALWAYS RIGHT! Their servers always have an attitude towards customers, which is wrong of them to have. I do understand that working as a server is stressful and annoying, however, they chose to work those position.

A list of cosmetic and service improvements I strongly recommend that this establishment should consider...

1. Improve the lighting in the restroom, by replacing the incandescent bulbs above the mirror with recessed LED light bulbs or fluorescent light tubes (I highly recommend LED light tubes).

2. Install new stall dividers/ walls to remove the minor vandalism inside it. *Note: This would also force this establishment to close down or condense the restroom to the women's restroom for a couple of days*

3. Improve the seating throughout the restaurant with much more comfortable chairs and booths. 

4. Install auto flushers for their sit-down toilets and urinals, make their sinks and soap dispensers also sensor based as well. *Note: see number 2.*

5. RE-TRAIN their servers, re-train them on how to replace water that happens to be dirty and to NOT HAVE AN ATTITUDE with the customers. 

6. Either clean the rafters above the general population area of the dust and dirt that cling on to them or simply close it off with a drop ceiling. *Note: This would force this establishment to close down for a few days to a couple of weeks*

Those are some of the improvements that this establishment should definitely consider if they want to continue to have a good business and receive better customer reviews in the future. If not, they'll be closed down within the coming years and they'll lose their business license. They should really consider the customer experience over their definition an ethical business practice.

*ATTENTION*
To all future customers and reviewers of this restaurant, if you happen to look up at the rafters and look closely there you'll see how filthy this restaurant is, let that be your first impression of the place and everything about this establishment will fall into place.",7BqR5zk1O2s1znYt0hlNOQ,0,0,1,SDsGETDfRG8DtLdemPbWyw

Its sad but this Buffet is no different with its food selection but I will say the Black Pepper Frog Legs are the best item on their Buffet and they are simply the best damn Frog Legs I've ever had!

For those of you who love their Lobster dish: yes I tried their lobster dish and this Seafood lover wasn't overly impressed. It was messy and since you had to shell the lobster yourself you ended up with their slimy sauce all over your fingers and if you are a little bit clumsy like me it will fall off of your plate and land onto your shorts.  

Also today's lobster tasted very strongly of fish (for those of you land locked Vegas locals your fish and seafood shouldn't smell strongly of stinky fish. If it does it indicates its not fresh and hours away from making you sick) today's lobster dish was stinky to say the least but I did brave a few bites. Thinking of my digestive health I thought it a wise choice to push the last few pieces aside.

The Sushi seemed OK but was mostly rice. I guess it was what you'd expect at a buffet.

Service at the door was a bit cold. We were there a good hour and a half before closing but the server seemed rushed and disinterested in making us feel welcome. In fact she walked us to a back room pointed at a table and only said sit there before walking away. We were the only new customers so she didn't need to rush back. A simple statement of your server will be right with you but feel free to help yourself would have been nice.

The waitress was very attentive and cleared empty plates and filled sodas quickly. Almost made me forget how we were treated at the door.

I truthfully like this place however this is no casino buffet so people shouldn't be going to this place expecting to get treated like world class customers from staff or expect 5 star diamond treatment all the time. 

The food is pretty standard Chinese selections as well as fruit and salad. They do have sushi as well as limited deserts such as jello ice cream and a couple other things but not much selection or extended variety as other places. Servers are pretty quick to get drinks refilled for the most part and clean up finished plates. 

Their soda selections are Pepsi products such as Pepsi dr. Pepper, and you know the rest. I have gone a few times and do like it however being honest the crap legs like are way to thin and you have to literally grab about two to three plates of them and really spend a long time to break them and go through before you get full. 

On the buy one get one beer even though the beers are the same price they do not let you try to get two different beers which is a little silly in my view. If you want a bud light and to try another beer once you pick one you have to have the same one which is really weird.

Definitely not.  But what you get for dining here is the great selection of items that are constantly being refilled by the staff.

I braved the sushi selection, which is okay at best.  It has your typical inexpensive California rolls to those that are topped with broiled eel and eel sauce.  If you want AYCE sushi, I guess you can do it here on the cheaps or better yet, pony up another $13-15 for it at a AYCE sushi place around town.

The Chinese food section is better. Although there are some items that I would suggest avoiding all together, such as the Salt & Pepper Shrimps (it can be messy to eat, and the quality of the shrimp or the way it was way overcooked makes it not worth the effort or the chance to waste the food).

And here is a quick review of what I remembered eating.

Mapo Tofu. Tofu is good, not spicy, and not the authentic version you would expect if you ordered this at a regular Chinese place.

Beef & Broccoli: I liked it.

Beef Tenderloin: Too tough, which means it was overcooked.

Seafood Combo: The shrimps are cooked well and it is tasty, but the imitation crab meat is not good at all. My guess is the quality of the imitation crab meat used is on the cheap and low quality spectrum, which means it is made more with flour fillers than fish.

Chicken entrees: I tried all of them and I think they are all pretty good for a buffet.  Except the chicken wings, which are fried too long, and pretty dried inside. The teriyaki Chicken is also okay at best.

Vegetable Tempura: Not the refined version served at most Japanese restaurants, but I still enjoyed it.  The yam tempura is my favorite.  As it can get rather greasy, I suggests waiting for it to be refilled and grab the ones on the top.

Wonton soup: Definitely have had better.

Garlic String Beans: Good but greasy.

Mongolian BBQ Station: I didn't try it.
Dessert Donut: Not bad for fried dough tossed in sugar.

Agar agar based desserts: Not bad.  Except all the plates are kept hot for the hot foods, that it warms up the desserts you place on it.

You can also order boba drinks and customize it with the fruit smoothie flavors you want for an additional nominal charge.

Service is good, definitely enough waitstaff to clear the tables quickly and offer to refill drinks frequently.

Location: Conveniently at the corner of Rainbow and Sahara. 

Parking: There are plenty.

Perverted Old Asian Men:  Must have came on a wrong day/time or seated in the wrong section, but I didn't see any.

Take out: Yes

Price:  Pretty low.  So perfect for those on a tight budget that can't cook at home.",RQlnSCjuqMnhR3Qk6j4KoA,5,2,3,699r3trYyPfvBH7pvWeBtw

5936083,2016-04-22,1,VKmGedwOk-16D7OawNg_ng,"One of the worse experiences. Waitress kept saying we had to pay for another person since we wanted a high chair. We had already paid for 8, which was the amount of people in our party, but since we wanted a high chair she said there would be 9. Finally manager came over and after arguing with her about only having 8 people and that we needed the high chair for my niece that we already paid for, manager finally said ok. Then we asked for water and the waitress said if we got water, we wouldn't get refills on our sodas. But when we asked for refills she was rude and huffed about it. At one point we asked her for something but she didn't respond, so we asked her again, when she yelled at us ""I know!, I heard you!""  The food was horrible as well. We all left there smelling of bad fish. Selections were old and nothing tasted good. Will never come back to this place or any other of their buffets. I'd give them 0 stars if I could.",Y5Hl2fhl4OKvIckphulpEg,1,1,1,-TsrE5o6AJQ0zaeTNF6mhw

Not the best buffet I've been to but It's cool.  Lots of different dishes to choose from.  The workers were constantly bringing out fresh food.  The sushi looked and tasted fresh.  The Mongolian bbq station had all the fixings to make your food, but there was nobody standing at the grill to make it for you - sucks!  The workers were quick to refill drinks and take away dirty plates - nice!

All in all - I would give this another try...if and when I'm back in Vegas.",b5Xvksa5eUDfrDJY66Btzg,1,0,3,TItTqVbAJ4e0Omd2wrVbFg

Overall it's just ok , the crab legs are so skinny I think they were on a diet before the got cooker lol. The upside is they are pretty cheap if you are hungry for inexpensive food that is so so in my book.  I like Krazy Buffet better and their crab legs are much more plumped.

Happy yelping xoxox",RCgfxH5PclsgSKRWDGJ86A,0,0,3,ZEsIemUeO6giAGZoxxeoVw

Upon entering, the restaurant was packed. I was definitely concerned and reluctant to go in if there was going to be a long wait. Luckily we walked right in and have no wait whatsoever. The service was ok, nothing exceptional but they refilled our drinks regularly and brought us napkins when we requested them. The food is just standard, as well. Definitely nothing exceptional, but pretty good for the very, very cheap price.

I don't think I'll make this a regular place on my food rotation, but it's good to have this option on the cheap from time to time.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,4,3,3,FfUxzEIyUDU2SuuH1R3k6Q

Complain is that the service is terrible the staffs seems mean and rude and they ask u for the tip before you get to eat so when i tipped usually base on the service so I kinda felt cheated cuz service was terrible they are defiantly not a friendly staff and the decor is pretty out dated seems like they haven't fix the place since 1990s",ZNAPlIS9d2iXzAECaqQX3A,1,0,1,mHYs4V0zuNswQ5mYpXVkDg
