Let me tell you the food was just as great as the service if not better. Can't say enough about this place other then trying it for yourself. 100% all USA beef burgers and dogs.

The Good-

The prices were right. The menu catered to burger and hotdog lovers. They knew what they did good and stuck to it. The patty and cheese were good. The tater tots where golden and crispy. The portion you get on tots was outlandish. We could have fed a family of 5 with the order, same goes with the onion rings. The bacon appeared to be made at the time of order for my friends burger. The buns were quality. 

The Bad-  The gentleman that took my order didn't make my cheeseburger plain. My bun was hard on one side. 

Suggestions- They need to serve Heinz ketchup instead of off brand and offer season salt and vingar for the fries/tots. Also their pickles could be better. 

Over all though it was good and definitely worth giving a try!",FplU4P9iDYFeI90alc9orw,4,1,4,NH8bpZ6XpXUb1Ir6aZa3xQ

A woman was robbed right in front of our table. The robber had a knife and ran off with her purse. We started running after him, but the real hero was an employee from Jared's. He ran after the burglar and caught him hiding. He ended up getting the purse back and saved that woman's day. 

Anyway, food was delicious. You get a good selection of toppings for free on your burger and fries/tots. Service was excellent.",iC1tUrt60pmteeHS19axBQ,6,5,5,8pVrXOVdz7tq-E-ZjZIDyw

The onion rings are definitely worthed. The thickness of the rings and the taste with a cool crunch and the same on the fries. Now lets talk about the in house sauces. The ranch was incredible but that mustard is a omg! The burger and corndog was tasted and reported. The burger was on point and the grilled onions was incredible. The buns wasn't still toasted and the corndogs as well which is what has inspired the trip of freshness. Thats the only reason the 4 came in to play other than that they would have had a 5 all day. I will say the atmosphere, the team, and prices are on point and absolutely amazing.",pf8Vrq6H2us1Bd1cpo7k1A,2,0,4,9WJg0aDfBOFzzLkY4R57aA
1858535,2017-04-06,1,EwUM6gGMBhrjOef0wmqKJQ,Unbelievable that this place had all 5 star reviews. Overpriced garbage. For a single cheeseburger with bacon and disgusting french fries and  canned soda for $12. The burger was a bland McDonald's like patty with no flavor. The french fries were soggy and terrible tasting. Only positive was the bun everything else was uneventful and I have a hard time believing any of the previous reviews are real. We have way too many good burger joints in town for this place to even be in the discussion Inn and Out burger is even better than this place and i'm not a big fan of theirs either. The only thing I can think of is people are excited to be at the Pawn Stars pawn shop because you have to have no taste buds whatsoever to think this place is something special.,rx7oGD_Uu6MTPmFOKB5NwQ,1,1,1,LegfwXamsFMg6Lf4_7c57A

He was cool and it was good to hear the owners still really care about their customers experience. Prices are great & everyone that worked there was super friendly. The girl at the register was helpful by telling us how big things were (tots order is huge!) and the corn dog is one big one cut into 3 so perfect for sharing. Jared sauce was delish! I will definitely come here every time I'm in Vegas! Great location off the strip, outdoor seating & family friendly. Highly recommend checking it out for good eats not too far off the strip. 

Also, while we were there it we noticed a pawn shop in the same parking lot and lots of people outside of it waiting in line and running around with their cameras out like paparazzi! We then realized we were next to the pawn stars reality show shop. So the area was busy but a little busier than usual because the girl that worked there told us one of the stars of the show was right behind us. Had no idea, I don't watch it.

The bun was good and the toppings were fresh. I also got onion rings which were good but maybe a little well done. 

My biggest problem was the service. When I walked in the two employees were eating at the register. That's very odd to me. And they left their half eaten food there the whole time I was ordering.  They both seemed nice but they took forever to make the food. Considering just about everything there comes off a grill or out of a fryer, I was surprised at how long it all took.  There is also no place to wait inside which is a big deal when it's 115 outside.

I love hotdogs and anyplace that is specifically catered to hotdogs or things of that nature I will probably want to go to and will probably like. I mean, I love a good hotdog. We came here to just get a quick bite before we headed out to do other things. There is seating outside that is covered so it has a nice little zippy in and out feel to it but seating so you can enjoy your meal. 

The people at the counter we really friendly and had nice things to say. I was actually surprised when they asked if I wanted a steamed dog or a grilled one. I of course asked for a grilled one. The toppings were plentiful, even for a condiment queen like myself. I thought it was really nice joint.

The hotdogs took a bit to cook since they were from the grill but once I got mine it went down fast. It was more like a foot long dog than a regular dog, or at least I think so. I thought it tasted fantastic and was a perfect little snack.
