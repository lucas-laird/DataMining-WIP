The food was so delicious! I got their BBQ bacon burger with their signature fries, I was very happy with my meal. My boyfriend got the steak dip sandwich with Mac n cheese balls instead of fries, which of course I tried, it was a solid meal. Both meals had some bomb bread, which is the best part for me.

As we got to the end of this one block we came across Eureka! and it seemed to look fun and inviting. Not to mention it was filled w/ people, unlike some of the other places we passed by. Typically if a place is busy, it's gotta be good right? 

We walked in and the hostess let us know the wait time. We asked if food could be served at the bar. Once we found out it could be, we attempted to find a place at the bar. As I looked around one of the bartender's, Ashley, raised her hand to get my attention. Once I saw this, she pointed to 2 open seats. As we sat down Ashley greeted us w/ a smile. She asked if it was our first time. When she found out it was our first time she welcomed us and thank us for coming in. That felt really nice because not many places instill that in hospitality staff now a days. 

When she asked if we wanted to drink, we both had no clue. I told Ashley I wasn't much of a beer drinker, so I didn't know more than half that was on the list. I saw that their whiskey list was more my speed, but again there were some on there that I didn't know either. When we asked Ashley what a beer or whiskey tasted like, she was kind enough to take the time to drop some knowledge on us. 

In the end I said this is the type of beers and whiskeys I drink. Ashley said, I recommend these. She was spot on w/ her suggestions. We didn't end up eating here due change of plans, but we def would like to come back based off of how friendly Ashley was w/ our first time being there and newbies to so many of the drink options. That left a lasting impression on us.",lK6vU1_UCK1owB6VEIOZPQ,3,2,5,Bi3a-sUuajf7mFXij_-q-w

The drinks for happy hour weren't a super good deal (I think $1 or $2 off) but better than nothing? We had a server in training so he was very attentive (and it was pretty dead in there @ 530pm on a Monday) The interior is dark and rustic but there is an outdoor patio if you want more light (and to sweat!!) I ended up ordering the chicken tacos which were good and super stuffed to the brim. They were $12 AND came with a side! I chose the sweet potato fries which came drizzled with honey and cinnamon.

The ginger, lemon ale has a refreshing kick to get your good gut flora to manifest, or at least that is what my wife told me. 

Menu has a lot of choices. I finally settled on the bone marrow burger , very juicy and tasty. The burgers a regular people size, so if you look like me, get an appetizer.  The service was friendly and fast. Overall a good addition to the downtown vibe. 

Sadly, the great beer selection is wasted on me since I don't drink, but I hear it is awesome.

We also opted to upgrade our fries, one to sweet potato fries, and one with truffle cheese sauce on the side. Everything was absolutely incredible. The Bison Burger has this incredible jalapeno bacon jam that is somehow sweet and not spicy at all. The sweet potato fries were glazed with honey (brilliant!) and the truffle cheese was to die for. The feta and fig marmalade combo on my fig burger was absolutely mouth watering! Both burgers were cooked to an impeccable medium. The service was fantastic -they were so helpful attentive, and they were super excited about the food they were serving.

So we left and walked up to Eureka! where we were immediately greeted by friendly staff and the GM who was more than happy to have us there.

Fantastic location (though parking may get difficult at times) and plenty of seating inside, outside, or at the bar.  Not many ""bars"" on this side of Fremont to just sit back and watch a game, so Eureka is a fantastic new option.  Beer selection s fantastic and rare at the same prices in the area.  They offer flights for about $2-3 per pour and samples as well.  The best part is the 10pm Happy Hour, everyday, even on weekends, which I hope never ends as tone of the better deals in the area.  Lots of $6-7 bite options and a few dollars off drinks.

We had the blackened tacos, bone marrow burger, and brussel sprouts off the Happy Hour Menu.  The brussel sprouts were very good and came out super quick.  Large but cut in half, so definitely shareable.  The bone marrow burger was just a good burger at medium rare.  Not really sure I could taste the bone marrow itself as it's in the sauce, but still a big burger and filling.  I liked that they had broccolini and salad as side options as well for only a $2 upcharge above the complimentary fries with the dish.  The tacos were really good and had great filling.  The sweet potato fries were the only disappointing part of the meal.  They came with cinnamon topping which did not go well with any of our dishes ordered.  They were too sweet and more of a dessert than a side.  Pro tip: try their spicy aioli.  Fantastic dipping sauce and made the meal.

Got there in time for happy hour (awesome little bites for cheap!) so we threw down a couple drinks and some Brussels sprouts. The Brussels had a lemon kinda zest to them as opposed to the obvious idea of drenching it in balsamic so kudos for goin outside the box. I went out on a limb and tried the stone double IPA as well as a different DIPA that I can't remember, both incredulous. Let my hair down real hard. Btw these drafts, as well as the bottled beers and whiskeys rotate so you can always find a fresh lineup?? That's awesome. 

The entrees didn't stand a chance. Me and Mika both had burgers that were perfectly portioned. Personally, I like to be able to breathe and move after my meal so the portions were perfect. Especially with an appetizer. Bison burger w/ a BACON jalapeño JAM.. WAT. Fresno FIG burger w/ a FIG MARMALADE and SPICY PORTER MUSTARD THESE ARE MY FAVORITE WORDS. I even threw a tomato dill soup on the side cause I'm bouji. Will return for the kimchi burger and the buco riblets!

The food is well-prepared, and a bit inventive, almost Instagrammable.  The prices are a little high, but what you would expect for the downtown tourist area.

3674029,2018-05-14,0,isw3cS3hOKdKeBgi3lF3-A,"Ventured into Downtown Vegas last night and decided to check this place out. Eureka is tucked away on the corner of a convenient location on Fremont Street. There is patio seating open to Fremont, which is nice on these summer nights. The restaurant itself is centered around the bar, and most of the seating is around the bar as well (not the best place to bring kids). 

We only made it to the appetizers for our meal since we paired it with the beer flights. Here are my suggestions.

What to Get- Appetizers on Happy Hour Menu & Drinks:
Mac and Cheese Bites (cheesy and crispy and comes with a great dipping sauce)
Crispy Brussel Sprouts (light and crispy and tossed in a sweet sauce)
Beer Flights (any and all. fun addition to meal)
Falafel Bites (flavorful and comes with a great topping and Tzatziki sauce) 

I wasn't a huge fan of the truffle fries (larger cuts and not well seasoned). 

Overall, I was let down by the cocktails since the price and hype did not match up with the quality of drinks. I didn't enjoy my Young and in Love and my Electric Butterfly cocktail. I kept seeing these pictures on yelp and decided to give it a try. The Young and in Love was very sour and sweet and didn't have much depth. The Electric Butterfly comes with a buzz button (flower bud) that you chew in your mouth (which completely numbs your mouth and makes you heavily salivate). It was an interesting experience in itself, however the drink was 80% ice cube. I don't understand the purposes of the large purple ice cube, but I really only got 4 sips before the drink was gone. I also tried my friends' drinks- Moscow Mule and the Margarita, both better than the other cocktails but nothing very special. 

This is a fun spot and in a fun space. I'd suggest coming here for good beer and small dishes.",WU9eoIz9KCcSB4bAxhOHXQ,3,1,4,ehVm8_qqYqK8Zi6dpR_-8Q

I was EXTREMELY tempted to get the charcoal lemonade, but I chickened out. Cluck cluck. I ordered some water while my friends got some of the Maui Ale I think, they were definitely fans of how light it was. 

Our table ordered Mac and cheese balls, chicken sliders, and a couple burgers. Mac and cheese balls were decent, but I'd like to give a standing ovation to their sidekick, the dipping sauce. Tasting like a cheesy ranch, I was all in. The chicken sliders were decent sized and they opted for the sweet potato fries. Did y'all catch my rhyme? There were mashed potatoes in the sliders and my pals told me the spicy aioli was awesome sauce. The fries were sprinkled with cinnamon and what may or may not have been maple syrup. Forgot to ask my other friends what they thought of their burgers, but they both ate the whole thing so I have to imagine they were aight. I'll attach some pictures of them so you can feast your eyes. 

For dessert I ordered the bourbon barrel cake, and I was so disappointed with how dry the actual cake was! Reminded me of the bourbon cake at TGIF, just more expensive.

I had the Fresno fig and goat cheese burgers with sweet potato fries, my husband had the 28 day aged burger, added onion straws and cheddar cheese, regular fries.

The burger is made up of shiitake bone marrow butter, charbroiled onion, mustard aioli, and a roasted Roma tomato.  Instead of fries, I opted for the $2 upcharge to have the fried macaroni and cheese balls--a smaller portion than what you get if you order it as an appetizer.

I asked for the burger to be very rare and that's the way it was served.  It was very good.  The fried mac and cheese balls are OK but another time I'd stick with fries.

Eureka! Service: Our server was at the table immediately upon seating to let us know that mimosas and Bloody Marys were $5 currently, excellent.  He answered some questions we had about the burgers and was extra helpful with getting orders the kids would like.  I wish I had gotten his name to give him some props on Yelp, he was on it.

Eureka! Bomb Burgers:  The Mac n Cheese balls were perfect.  Fried perfectly so that the Mac n Cheese inside was still cheesy.  The Jalapeno Burger was delicious!  The fried egg, cheddar, bacon, jalapeno and chipotle sauce all worked well together for an amazing burger.  FYI, the sweet potato fries come extra sweet as they're served with a touch of honey.  My friends enjoyed their Bone Marrow Burger and their Cowboy Burger.  

Ambiance:  Very clean industrial decor with plenty of wood enhances the experience in the open dining area.  The bar is beautiful and well stocked.  This is an attractive restaurant

Two more things to wrap this up.  Eureka! has the best Bloody Mary I've had in a long time.  I'm not really into them, but these are made from scratch and it was so tasty I ordered a second one I didn't need.  The BJJ BFF left his wallet at the table by mistake.

4107215,2018-03-26,5,isw3cS3hOKdKeBgi3lF3-A,"Heck of a craft beer bar. Food's not bad either. (OK, let's be honest: I enjoyed the food tonight far more than I thought that I would.)

Eureka! is chain focused on American food and beer that has set up shop in the Fremont East district of Downtown Las Vegas, just across the street from Commonwealth and El Cortez. They have what you might term ""gastropub"" food and a massive array of 40 taps, half of which are rotating draft beers (check their Instagram account for updates on those). They also have plenty of wines, liquors, and cocktails if you're not into beer.

Because I am into craft beer, I've visited this spot twice now. I can discuss the several beers which I've had at reasonable length, but that may not help you because I only recall having one ""permanent"" draft beer, the Knee Deep Brewing Company's Lupulin River. It's a ""double"" or ""imperial"" IPA, and it has a somewhat addictive hoppy taste with some piney and tropical notes. It grew on me as I sipped on it.

(In case you happen to read this review within a few days, get the Left Hand Chai Milk Stout or the Saugatuck Blueberry Maple Stout ASAP before they're tapped out. Those two manage to convey the promised smells and flavors quite successfully.)

I'll tell you some info that's more useful long-term though. They'll give little samplers (within reason) for you to try, and they have 4-beer flights for $9 (add $1 for each rotating beer). These options will help you to get a wide variety of tastes if you so desire. Just note that they designate certain beers with double exclamation marks (""!!"") and exclude these beers from the flights, which makes sense because these beers tend to be pricier anyway.

As for food, I've had merely a few bites so far, none more delightful than the Bone Marrow Burger ($16.50). It's rather pricey for the portion size, but it somehow thrilled me with the bone marrow shiitake butter and the perfectly medium-rare, tender beef patty. It doesn't hit you with anything too bold, but maybe that's the ""umami"" aspect being carried out so well. The horseradish mustard aioli was subtle but really closed the deal.

I also enjoyed the Mac 'n' Cheese Balls (+$2 for 3 balls), which I substituted for the fries which would normally come with the burger. They're little ""croquettes"" but with cheesy pasta instead of potato, and they're mostly satisfying texturally more so than flavorfully. The accompanying beer cheese sauce is therefore quite useful for adding flavor here.

The Truffle Cheese Fries ($6 happy hour; by the way, that's 3-6pm and 10pm-closing, every night) are a preferable snack to accompany beer, or anything. Seemingly every bite has a touch of truffle flavor. The truffle cheese sauce wasn't that memorable, but that could've been the beer's fault.

Eureka! is a much-welcome restaurant for food lovers and alcohol imbibers alike. I'll definitely be back again and again.",_VMGbmIeK71rQGwOBWt_Kg,6,5,5,fiLbXCwH73v2j_Y_2sYyKw
4114679,2018-06-21,0,isw3cS3hOKdKeBgi3lF3-A,"This place had some hits and misses on our recent visit. The name suggests that the focus is on beverages, and our experience bore that out. I had two sour beers: Amicitia by Avery Brewing, and Revive Pineapple by Upland. The former was OK, not a lot of flavor beyond the sour, but a decent brew. The Revive had a deeper flavor and some sweet notes to complement the sour flavor. I'd definitely drink that one again. 

Moving to the food, we shared a number of dishes between our group of four; here's the rundown:

Crispy Glazed Brussels Sprouts - featuring an orange chile glaze, chimichurri, and almonds, these were really good, with a sweet flavor and a nice char. Probably the highlight of the meal. 

Mac and cheese balls - The beer cheese dipping sauce was probably the best part of this; they were nicely fried, but the mac and cheese itself was pretty basic. 
 
Lollipop corn dogs - Again, the mustard dipping sauce was tasty, but the product itself was pretty plain. 

Osso bucco riblets - These little bites did taste good and featured a tender meat with a nice aioli drizzle. Worth a try. 

Short rib kimchee burger - The kimchee was not very flavorful nor spicy, the patty was overcooked and a little dry, and the fries were about McDonalds quality, which is not bad for fast food, but I'd expect a bit more for these prices. 

Overall, it seems that Eureka is trying, and they did execute on some dishes, but for the prices, I'd have hoped for better quality. Having said that, myself and my group all agreed that the drinks were very good, and I think we'd all go there again for that.",2-qk8ijAEjYszDZXwRmbQA,3,1,3,ppbcUz8U9ZzgO0QJvZh3ng

It was a very well done place actually! Super modern with decor and their menu. I think it's really hard to compete with everybody down here in freemont as there are so many really good restaurants down here. 

We actually only ordered the salmon; but man they didn't disappoint! Seasoning on Black rice and mushroom was so on point that if I put a dab of salt it will be too salty! Salmon was a perfect size and so flaky; it wasn't under nor over cook! It was literary perfect! Pink in the middle and glistening. 

I am a vodka person though unfortunately I think this bar is a beer bar and whisky so they only have a choice of house vodka! And that's a downer for me. I mean I just think every bar should have 2/3 choices of vodka. At least Tito and kettle one like the most popular brand. I usually only drink vodka soda and bad vodka make for a really bad hangover and that's exactly what happened. 

But hey other than that! Service was also on point! Never had to look for someone to get more drinks! They asked before your drinks were even gone! And that's what I call excellent service!

I had seen a bunch of fellow yelpers check into this place and give it high reviews so I was super excited to see what all the hype was about. 

Eureka, you did not disappoint! Your food is phenomenal! 

Personally, I love going to restaurants with a larger group because everyone will order different items off the menu which helps me discover which items are the most scrumptious choices. Every single item we ordered was incredible. My taste buds were soooo happy! 

We started off with a round of appetizers including the shrimp ceviche, truffle fries with beer cheese sauce, and the osso bucho riblets. First off, our appetizers literally arrived within a few minutes after we ordered them. Talk about impeccable service! I was so impressed! As for the taste of these dishes, the ceviche was so refreshing with the perfect balance of shrimp, mango salsa, and a hint of guacamole to tie the whole dish together. I'd easily order this app every time I'd go to this location. Not to mention, the riblets were ever so tender with what appeared to be a spicy buffalo sauce on top. Now combine that with truffle fries and beer cheese and all you'll be able to say is yummmmmmm in between every delicious bite. 

As for our main courses, I ordered the jalapeño egg burger with a side salad as a substitute for fries (since i already indulged in a heaping portion of fries in an appetizer a few moments earlier). Let me just tell you, the flavor of this burger combined with a sunny side egg on top was sooo delicious and savory. I scarfed up every bite within mere minutes. Plus, the side salad was the perfect compliment to end my meal leaving me completely satisfied and not too stuffed. The rest of our table ordered a wide array of dishes including the Napa chicken sandwich, bison burger, 8oz steak, and the steak sandwich. I can honestly say I saw smiles all around that table and each plate was completely empty which could only mean my guests were just as pleased with their food choices as I was.

I came in right when they opened and was so blown away by the horrible service and I received a very nice message from the general manager inviting me back. The second time I came in was great, and now the third time it was back to pure disappointment. The blonde bartender on Friday night has an extremely dirty mouth and was very inappropriate. The guy seemed to not want to be there and I was ignored completely by the 3rd bartender. They seemed to be a little busy but I had ordered the falafel appetizer and it never came out. When I asked the bartender about it she told me ""f*ck I forgot it ring it in"" I paid for my 1 drink and left. I have given Eureka 3 shots and I'm done.

4531383,2018-03-24,0,isw3cS3hOKdKeBgi3lF3-A,"D-E-L-I-C-I-O-U-S-! Went here for happy hour (3-6PM and another late night...maybe 10 or 11PM?) and the prices were pretty decent for shared appetizers. Let me tell you about the food and a special drink.....

We ordered Brussels sprouts (AMAZING!!!), mac n cheese bites (had a little kick), chicken nachos (the jalapeños were hot), and the fries (the cheese and dip were delightful).

What stood out to me most was the Electric Butterfly cocktail. The waitress said that I picked the best drink of them all. Then my friend said she read a review about it in a magazine. They seemed both very excited about this drink that I picked out. I'm not sure why I picked it as I hate butterflies, but the description (posted a photo of it and the drink) looked superb so my tastebuds told my brain, ""THAT ONE!"" The buzz button definitely gave my mouth a strong tingling and numbing sensation, but for sure cleansed my palette a bit and the drink tasted even better after.....and so did my friend's drink called Rosemary's Ruby Red. Hahah. Even the taste of the Brussels sprouts after chewing the buzz button from the drink made them taste bold.

We chilled down with a couple of beers on their list. Seemed like you couldn't go wrong with whatever they had on tap.

We sat on the patio since the sun was peaking out, but as it got cooler, they turned on the patio ceiling heat lamps and it felt good. Sitting on the patio or by the window is a great choice if you like to be distracted or people watch the Downtown Las Vegas crowd. The inside of this location looks very ambient with their dim lights and I was loving the dropped lightbulbs on the colored wires.

The bar had TVs if you wanted to catch up on sports and such.

I will definitely return to try more items and cocktails. As for the price, got to make sure I share with friends as that bill can rack up quick because everything we ordered was so good! :)",bYm6JjJ64F31gzDq2imWJA,2,0,5,5rl4UDtYPkabf7n6AY7i7g

Cauliflower Bites 4/5 nice flavor with a spicy kick

Chicken Nachos 3.75/5 fresh veggies, guacamole and a good choice of chips. 

Fresco Fig Burger 5/5:  one of the best burgers great patty, goat cheese and bacon.

Another entrant spurring on the revitalization of the DTLV Arts District.  On the corner of Freemont and 6th, it has everything you'd expect from ""that"" place.  Industrial chic interior, casual vibe, solid selection of rotating casks and brown libations, craft cocktails, and modern American bar grub.  

Dishes are drink friendly with bold flavors.

""Share It"" dishes ordered were just OK.  The Mac N' Cheese balls (as the name implies, rolled in a parm bread crumb mixture and deep fried),  Crispy on the outside, warm, creamy and cheesy on the inside; slightly oily, solid.  The crispy glazed Brussels sprouts, OK, bitterness enhanced by the vegetal chimichurri but brightened by a somewhat sweet orange chili glaze.  Both work with drinks but neither stands alone.

Ready for your Eureka moment?  This is it, the bone marrow burger.  A thick, all beef patty (mixture of cuts not specified but taste like some dry aged cut is included), well cooked and finished with an umami supercharged bone marrow, shitake butter.  A horseradish aioli enhances the dry aged character of the beef, while a grilled roma tomato adds acidity.  The warm bun soaks up all that goodness...oh heck, it's good eats.

The butcher's steak dip (basic French dip) and bison burger with bacon jalapeño jam also good but I wasn't gonna trade another sample of my burger for either.

Note:  Burgers can be served on a bed of arugula tossed in a lemon vinaigrette instead of in a bun. HAHA!

Service is casual and friendly. 

Very good beverage program.   Rotating selection (including seasonal) of 40 or so casks.  Rotating selection of brown libations.  Creative sounding cocktails though none sampled.  Prices are in line for DTLV.

My wife had the salmon on top of some bland 'black rice.' The salmon was a generous cut and was fresh but did not have much in the way of added flavor from the kitchen. Maybe a grill of some kind is called for. 1 1/2 tablespoons of cole slaw was very good. A standard margarita was $10 with no salt on the rim. The draft beer was 12 ounces instead of a proper pint. The music was two clicks two loud with the tinny sound system making things much worse. Think one step up from AM radio. Stash a subwoofer or two someplace. Service was confused. Water not refilled... something that restaurants in the desert must get right. Dessert was a date nut cake so sweet you needed the vanilla ice cream to cut it.

Crispy Glazed Brussel Sprouts - It's up to par with a lot of my favorite brussel sprouts and that citrus glaze adds a twist to add more complexity to the taste

I did think it was loud inside...I came on Memorial Day at like 11 am...so I sat on the patio. Not too bad...but of course you get to watch the weirdos of Fremont. Hey, it makes for some great conversation and people watching. A thumbs up from me, give it a try.",IPlLcdNG426qOopHH4EwkQ,0,0,4,H9iVzGZklifXAHBSanqWOw

I had the fig burger and promised myself I wouldn't eat the whole thing but that didn't work out well. It was too good!",3O_5151h5_AeCL9cr2L1Lw,1,0,5,Lm_eH1iVksv57cdlQX1Kmw

Sat down with the dime piece, ordered the falafel bites and brussel sprouts for appetizers - both excellent, personally enjoyed the bsprouts a bit more. Steak sandy for the entree 10/10. Had 2 drinks each between the two of us as well and total came out to 72 bucks. Waitress was super chill, and dude playing guitar was a star in the making no joke.",tlM9gQ1Z1lkDmHnYEtKAKg,0,0,5,4C5t3aCf0JD_Sis0P1IaxA

My favorite dinner is the salmon. Friends with us loved the turkey burger, chicken tacos and steak sandwich dip. Truffle cheese fries rocked. Cannot find a bad here and the drinks are terrific.",xbW5xOZsp6gQenx8WOsBJA,1,1,5,yCkVR6jVTjiZb27Kz5wyBg

Cauliflower bites were amazing as well as the sweet potato fries which was cinnamon on them and then are drizzled in honey. Also had the corn dogs which were yummy. The macaroni bites though were not good.,ghgevOASnx9G6PKxllk5dg,0,0,4,d4aHDeXO3B9PxJepNDbF3Q
5769934,2018-05-15,1,isw3cS3hOKdKeBgi3lF3-A,"Hmmm... I wanted to come here because of all the compliments about the happy hour here.  I'm not impressed.  The best you can do is a $1 off specific beers?  Yikes.  The pricing on the happy hour food was ok but not spectacular.

We were there obviously at happy hour and this means we were there for shift change.  Maybe they shouldn't have sat us where they did but I just didn't like being privy to the complaints and gossip of the restaurant.  Do that in the back.  Don't let customers hear you complain.

The food was nothing special.  We ordered the falafel bites but they were out.  Didn't tell us until after we had gotten some of our food already.  Hmmm...

I will say the brussel sprouts were great.  A little oily but very delicious. 

Probably won't come back but that's ok.  Plenty of other great restaurants in the area.",byV70bKT87SHgN0uRtow6w,3,0,3,Q1MK0JscxBZFFMkUOmqoSA

My friends enjoyed the turkey burger and fish tacos. I've had the protein chopped salad twice and love love love it. Also, you have to try the homemade ginger lime soda. This is a great addition to the downtown food scene!",bIw2bHKYXokpA0jsqtKetA,0,0,5,70nk8NrT8fDEHsf5-DT4hw

Had the bison burger and it was great.  Also tried the ""Electric Butterfly"" drink and that was good too. Very good experience. Would come back and highly recommended.",3Q0z9o6dGW7clQe0zvEKaA,1,0,5,-qx4w6A3BLO2RoVLQEh2iw
