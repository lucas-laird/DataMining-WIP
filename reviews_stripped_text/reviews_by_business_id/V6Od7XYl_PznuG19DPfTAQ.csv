Don't expect to get your money's worth unless you speak up and they're still going to act like they can't do it. But the food is great.,0m7U2dmLfU2uusDCdg8eRA,0,1,2,BzCraGwXnxum5Q4jpI9V6A

I recently moved here and was happy to find this location so close to home.  Easy in and out after work.   Love their food.  This location doesn't disappoint.

What DID make me want to never come back here was this: I ordered the food, but  had to wait for the chicken.  No biggie.  I step up to the cashier and he tells me the total, I pull out my debit card, he looks at it, pauses... then says ""ummm..can I see your ID""?  Sure no problem, I show ID.   Purchase was less than $20 but I have no problem showing my id.   My issue lays in the fact that NO ONE else was asked to show their ID after me.  As I stood there waiting I noticed that he didn't ask another person to show ID.  So.... why me?  And before you think I'm going all race card on you, it's the other way around here.   I got a taste of what it's like to be a minority.  I felt really bad.  And upset.  Why me?  What was it about MY appearance that made him question my integrity?   I would like to know!   Does Panda Express give their employees discretion on whom to ask and whom to trust?   I think there should be a corporate policy somewhere that says simply ""anything over $ ask, anything under $ don't bother"".   I think ""Hai W"" needs some additional training before he insults all your customers.   I will not set foot in this location again because of him.",4Riy6T3lpqRHA0VlkICXpQ,0,0,1,tCtvxZ-ACeDE1XXRx5wCyA

My walnut shrimp tasted like they had been ""re-cooked"" and fell apart. My beef tasted like it had been sitting in the pan for a very very long time. The cream cheese wontons were very old and dry.

The only highlight was the kung pao chicken. Lots of chicken and squash. It was delicious. I wish I would have gotten more of it instead of the above. 

I always get the 1/2 1/2 with the fried rice and chow mein. It was ok.

Great spot, you can see it from the street when you drive by. It's on north Durango and 215. I was going to go to the one in Centennial Center but I noticed this one so I decided to check it out real quick. It's right by the Buffalo Wild Wings (yes, I had to resist going there instead) and there's a parking lot for it. The location is very clean and the works are very nice. Chloe specifically was great to work with and very happy! You can sample anything you want so I love trying to new items they have on the menu. I got all chow mein, orange chicken, and beef and broccoli. What's great about Panda Express is that if you ask for it fresh, they have to make it fresh (unless they're closing within an hour.) I love their beijing beef as well. All Pepsi products (try not to cry.) Anyway, for a fast food place it's not bad at all.",Nhk0jTP2gkU12G4LHJVR3A,7,10,4,kTJe3w2mq86P9zmYcL9lXw

We were told it would be about an hour, and showed up a few minutes early. Much to the dismay of all of the patrons in line, when we arrived to pick up our order, everything was put on hold to dish up our chow. We didn't realize we were basically taking cuts in front of everyone else, as we just went to the area that said ""online order pick up."" I'm still not really sure why there was a need to order ahead of time, if they were just going to dish it up upon our arrival. None of the people in line were too upset, which was a surprise. Had the shoe been on the other foot, I may have been a little upset. We were offered complimentary sodas while we waited on one last item to be prepared. The food was good and there was more then enough, with plenty left over. At about six dollars a head (excluding beverages), it was perfect for the party. Nothing to really warrant a jump to four stars, but I would not hesitate to return to this location.",18xIAA444UuAWwEWiPCW-A,2,2,3,jVbPPuaOQQkkSmjQBp1IvQ

4575567,2016-07-27,2,V6Od7XYl_PznuG19DPfTAQ,"Since this is the 2nd bad experience in a row, I decided to write a review. Last week when I went in there was no honey walnut shrimp around 6pm, but I was told there would be some ready soon. No big deal, it's dinner and that means it would be fresh so I didn't mind waiting. I got a 3 entree plate, a large orange chicken, a rice bowl, and a large drink. After we payed, I got the bag and thought it felt a little light for the amount of food I ordered. I checked, and the orange chicken was left out. The guy that forgot it didn't apologize when I went back to the cashier, he walked away. She was very nice and gave me a coupon for a free small drink or orange chicken.  I felt that was resolved and was fine. But, lo and behold, when I got home and opened my plate...there were 3 pieces of shrimp (which I waited for and paid extra for) and 2 strips of chicken and a few green beans. The plate was 90% rice!!!  $30 for rice. 
Now for tonight, I go in at 8:45 ( they close at 10). The first thing I see is no honey walnut shrimp. When I ask, I'm told they are out for the night. Really, they are out or the don't want to cook any?  So I go for my next option...orange chicken. Guess what?  They are out and will have to cook some. If they still have an hour and and 15 minutes left to sell food, maybe they should have food. We just walked out. The whole point of going out to eat is to actually get served food to eat. It is so frustrating to go somewhere and experience a complete lack of care for you as a customer. I may try another location, but with so many options I may give up Panda altogether. I guess I was spoiled by the awesome food and service from the PE in Ft. Walton Beach, FL. So far, Vegas has been awful for food and customer service.",UtSla-0fuM31jRsKUZ-qIA,1,0,1,5RB-4g7PyvmegkSkoJh_rg

Well, was very disappointed with second time at this location! The dishes we ordered were truly so oily that really could not taste the food.

Not sure if they still have it but if you went in before they closed they would reduce the prices which we thought was a good deal.
It just seemed like in the past year the quality of the food has gone down and depending on who was working the amount of food you got as well,
We look for consistency and it is not here at all.
Sometimes the chicken just tasted like it sat too long. The past time we went we didn't feel so well after we both ate the food. So we are not fans of this place anymore.

5906075,2018-04-18,0,V6Od7XYl_PznuG19DPfTAQ,By far the worst experience from a Panda Express restaurant. I walked in with my family at 9:40 pm there was a couple in front of us that received their plates of food. When it came time for us to order there was literally nothing there and the girl working told us they weren't making any more food for the night. So I asked her what time they closed at she said 10:00 pm and I asked her why they weren't making anymore food she said cause their about to close. So I asked if there was a manager I could speak to and of course they wasn't one on site. So we left and went to another one who had a drive thru opened until 11pm. I called the next morning no manager again so I left my name and number didn't receive a call back. So I call today and I was told I need to call back in 30 minutes not that the manager would call me back in 30 minutes or even when she has time. They will never have to worry about me and mine coming back and it's a shame that it's in such a beautiful area and the young women who work at night have such disgusting attitudes of you don't want to work there and be pleasant with all customers get a different job.,PjbcKNi0gQTo23Vf7NUkbQ,0,0,1,iYx4QC7OeWWvNe6qUW0Mtw
