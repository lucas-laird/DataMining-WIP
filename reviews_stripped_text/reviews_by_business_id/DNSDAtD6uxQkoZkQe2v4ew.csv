Came here with my boyfriend to try something new and saw good reviews on here. Unfortunately I have Celiac so can't have any gluten. We called ahead and asked, the dude on the phone said no gluten - no problem. So we went.

And we are both blown away.

After letting the (super sweet and attentive) waiter know I'm gluten free, we started with the chili paneer. When it came out we noticed it was breaded so I got scared for a second; then out of the blue the Chef and owner Ritesh comes to the table, introduces himself and says 'Don't worry about the breading, I used rice and chickpea flour for you so it would be gluten free.' WOW! Such dedication to great service.

The chili paneer was absolutely unbelievable and so were our entrees (Chicken Tikka Marsala, Paneer Vindaloo, and sides of yellow Dal and eggplant).

We will definitely be back and I cannot recommend this place enough. Whether you're gluten free or not, the food here is so fantastic and the staff and owner are so amazing that you're missing out if you don't give it a try!!",xsOzHvvBZ5L5SVN4Q6Fa4w,12,1,5,FfcX_98_TwCCvR-5R7q6Wg

Service was welcoming, friendly, and attentive. They immediately remembered us after our first visit, which is always nice. The restaurant is clean and the decor of the dining area is appealing. 

I'm so glad that Curry Leaf opened up nearby where I live as I've always wanted a good Indian restaurant close by. My brother is new to Indian cuisine so I took him here one time for lunch when he was in town. He raved about it so much that he even left a review here on Yelp long before I did.

Who would have thought you could find genuinely great Indian food in a strip mall in Vegas?! We ordered the samosas and the chili paneer for apps. The samosas were good but not anything overly exciting. The chili paneer, however, was delicious! I mean, it's hard to go wrong with fried cheese smothered in chili sauce. The sauce, by the way, was pure magic. Our entrees were perfectly spiced. I was told the chef that night was ""timid"" with spice so I ordered my lentil soup and vegetarian dish spicy. It definitely had quite a kick but not so much that I couldn't taste my food. If the less timid chef is working I would probably stick to medium spice level. We also had a lamb dish- rogan josh, I believe, and korma with shrimp. Both entrees had complex and wonderful flavor and the lamb was so tender it was falling apart. The service was a bit slow and lacking but I'm not knocking them for it because there were only 2 servers and they were  swamped. They were hustling for sure.   Prices were about average and the atmosphere was cozy. Was this authentic Indian food? To be honest, I wouldn't know. Was it delicious?  Yes. Yes it was.

1056011,2016-05-09,0,DNSDAtD6uxQkoZkQe2v4ew,"This is a review on take-out. We had Tandoori Mix Grill, Lamb Rogan Josh, Aloo Gobi, Tadka Dal, naan (garlic and plain) and Gulab Jamun. 

The Mixed Grill was less than stellar. The reshmi chicken was dry and quite bland. The tandoori chicken was well cooked but the rub remained pasty and almost chalky. Like they cooked the chicken first then threw on the rub. The jumbo shrimp were delicious. The star of this entrée was the lamb kabob. SO GOOD! So moist and juicy. 

A craving for Rojan Josh was what made me want to try Curry Leaf. And the dish did not disappoint. The sauce was exactly like I remember having as a young kid. The lamb seemed a but overdone but the sauce made up for it. 

Tadka Dal and Aloo Gobi were both out of this freakin world. I ordered this dal thinking it would be mild so the kids could eat it. It was on the spicy side which is how I like it. The kids, not so much. But that's their loss. The cauliflower and potatoes soaked up the spices yet the cauliflower remained crunchy and the potatoes tender. This was probably my favorite dish.

Naans were both soggy which could have been because this was takeout and condensation settled in the foil which held the naan so it's not entirely fair to hold this one against them. The garlic naan was very garlicky and very yummy. BUT the plain naan, one corner was entirely raw. It made up about a quarter of the serving size so this was a real disappointment. 

Finally, the Gulab Jamun, I'd suggest making each ball larger so you get more of the soft, syrup soaked yummy center. And maybe up the honey/rose water in the syrup. It was so-so. Be warned though, with a takeout Gulab Jamun order, you don't get the ice-cream. Boo.

So there were some hits, some misses with Curry Leaf. Would I go back? Yes. But I'd steer clear of the Tandoori Mixed Grill and probably explore the vegetarian dishes more as that's where I got most flavor and authenticity.",g1_M-7uw6KSGx747Uz16AA,3,0,3,6oXb2yJWcvgIs1QMPX6nQA

First of a, let me say that this is INDIAN FOOD.  Not American-spiced food of questionably Indian origin.  When you order mild, it will burn the hair out of your nostrils.  When you order medium, you will breathe fire.  No one at my table was brave enough to order full spice.  With that being said, the flavors are luxuriant to the point of feeling pampered.  Their seasonal vegetable korma - I confess, korma is my go-to dish - is creamy, full-flavored and robust.  A pleasant surprise was the paneer contained within!  It had the texture of a really tender chicken breast, and for a moment, I thought there had been a mistake!  No mistake, though - just perfectly cooked meat substitutes, the quality of which could make the culinary gods shed a proud tear.

And their unusual cocktails are awesome, too!  I tried the guava margarita, and I would have gladly put them away until my family had to drag me from A to B if it weren't for my budget.  Sigh - next time.",PtzwGCjkQMEBTz4hkkMRug,3,0,5,mOIs6N03dB5n5Suv10fvfQ

So if you are hungry and want some Indian food and this restaurant is 2 hour far from you then also you should go for it, because its worth it.",5meil_AR-Xk6pHcVe6qhGg,5,0,5,U7eHODqnJXYcQ_HHwLxS0Q

Our waiter was informative and attentive - really good customer service. As well, it's super clean and the seating is comfortable. We ordered the Murgh Makhani and Meen Moilee. Others in our group had the Chicken Tikka Masala and the Chili Chicken. We also ordered sweet naan and garlic naan for the table. Everything was really great and flavorful. The waiter's suggestions on how spicy we should order were on point. The only reason this place isn't 5 stars is because the Chicken Tikka Masala tasted very different from what we had tried in London and we didn't like it as much.

We started with the garlic Naan bread and Baingan Bharta, which is Tandoori smoked eggplant that is mashed with various herbs. It comes in a small half size pot for half the price making it easy to combine with any entree. The flavors were extraordinary.

This was followed by two curry entree's, each served with long grain white rice. We had the Chicken Tikka Masala and the Lamb Vindaloo at a medium spice level. The Tikka Masala has marinated chicken chunks with an onion-tomato tandoor sauce. The Vindaloo has a distinctive onion, garlic, red chili & vinegar sauce flavor. They were both mouth-watering!  - but, literally, the Vindaloo was slightly more spicy than the Tikka Masala due to the red chili's. Of course, the temperature is nothing for those that enjoy heaping spoonfuls of overpowering spiciness on a regular basis.

I can't wait to try more items on the menu. 

The only downside: The restaurant has a ""suggested"" gratuity on the check that is between 15-20% of the grand total including tax. Gratuity should not be factored on top of sales tax; maybe the restaurant is hoping for the extremely generous types that likes tipping more than 20%.",jY1shXf_LQVhSoUyoXqQRQ,29,26,5,pzgWIFUHDvG7QPJWAuEcWQ

First time we tried the samosas. They have the appetizer set up so you can sample three different kinds of samosas. Girlfriend  and I enjoyed all three. 

Shrimp was really good! Perfect spice, really great sauce. Get spicy #6!!!!

Chicken Tikka masala is alright. I think the chicken was a bit overcooked on my serving, but sauce was good. Tastes good when you combine it with yogurt and garlic naan. 

Dessert is gulab Jaman as we always get. They are dough balls drenched in cardamom  syrup. The syrup isn't too sweet like some other Indian places we go to. No wonder she likes them  jk.jk..lol  

Now for service. Our server was ok. She seemed new so I gave her a break. She needs to be more aware placement of the plates while she cleared the table. Also should watch water glass more closely. Had to wait for water from after I finished appetizers to after I finished main course . It's ok though because they are a nice staff.

1624184,2015-08-05,7,DNSDAtD6uxQkoZkQe2v4ew,"Uh where do I start. I don't know how this place has so many high stars. Unfortunately our experience was not pleasant when we attended. I really wanted this place to work out & was looking forward to having an Indian food restaurant so close to work. I made a reservation ahead of time since we were a group of 8. Upon arrival there is no hostess & it's an awkward entry as you have to round the corner & look for staff to direct you. As another Yelper wrote there is a huge language barrier with one of the waitresses. On the evening I was there it was only her & a male employee (acting as mgr) working. There was one other table with 5 people (that came in far after us but got their food 1st) & a couple of booths with 2 people each. I had explained to the waitress that we would be doing separate checks & that was not a problem per the waitress (or the reservation taker). We waited for all in our party to arrive. The waitress started to take the orders & by the time she took about 4 of the orders we could tell she didn't understand what separate checks meant as she was writing everything down on one piece of paper mixing appetizers with entrees of separate diners. I tried to explain to her again that we wanted separate checks & in the middle of me explaining she ran off. So only part of our table had our orders in. We waited thinking she'd be right back but soon came to realize that she was just ignoring us. She started taking orders out for other tables. We literally waited 15 minutes for her to come back to the table to continue our orders. She wouldn't make eye contact & neither would the male waiter. We really should have left at that point but we really wanted to try this place. We finally got her back to the table & got all the other orders in. From the time we started ordering to the time we got it completed it was 30 minutes (I looked at my watch it was 6:21pm when we started & 6:51pm when we were finished.) A couple of our diners ordered beers in which it took her over 20 minutes to get. She was looking through the cooler trying to figure out what a blue moon was. One of our diners that ordered the beer went to the bar to ask her what the hold up was. At that time it became a joke at the table as to how long it would take to get beers meanwhile the other beer sat out on the counter getting warm for our other diner. It took her forever to key in the orders (like she didn't know how to use the p.o.s.) After we finally got the beers & were waiting & waiting for the food to come out we called over the male server who was ""acting manager"" for the evening & explained to him what was going on asked where our food was since it had been a long time. He tried to tell us that it was taking so long because we had ordered separate checks & that they make all their food from scratch. I literally said back to him ""well I would hope you would make your food from scratch."" He was trying to argue with us about the situation instead of trying to smooth it over. I told him that we understand that separate checks to take longer but not this long. Again - he was just argumentative. He asked if we would like the food to come all at once or as it was ready. Are you kidding me? So if we decided to say all at once so we could all eat together then some of us would have our food sitting under warmers while others were hot off the stove. We opted to have the dishes arrive as they were ready hoping they would be all hot (but they weren't.) We were all starving & we asked if we could at least get some naan while we waited. It never came out but instead came when people's meals started arriving. And we were charged for it on top of all the horrible service we received. We tried all 3 of the naans as well as the stuffed naan & they were not worth the $. The garlic naan has no garlic flavor. (Mint Indian Bistro or Taj Palace have far better garlic naan.) The kitchen isn't on their game when it comes to the spiciness level of their foods. Some people ordered their dishes mild but they had great kick while others dishes were bland & no taste when ordered mild. Another diner ordered his medium & it was horribly spicy. No one was impressed with their dishes. Price point to the size of dish is too high in my opinion compared to other Indian restaurants. None of us will ever be back. As I stated I really had high hopes for this place because I love Indian food & it was close to work. Unfortunately it fell completely short.",uByIGcI5EJeKNGyBtCkWBw,6,4,1,mMgxJz4cEupECYPGDsS91A

They have a 1-10 scale, and I had to have a 1 ( not because I want to, but because I have to) ... And I was still worried- but not to worry, ha, it was almost too mild for me (which is near impossible).  But the flavors were absolutely SPOT ON, the textures, and colors and the entire presentation - just brilliant and beautiful!  And this was merely lunch!

The decor is so tranquil and cooling ( greens, with spice colors for accents and flowing silks in gorgeous, cascading hues ) and the open space is not cold, but lets you breathe. It was hot today, but it was perfect here on so many levels.

2016390,2017-06-18,1,DNSDAtD6uxQkoZkQe2v4ew,"I've been coming to Curry Leaf for about a year now and I go atleast twice a month and I make sure to always get Korma. It used to be that I walk in excited to eat, but now I'm walking in expecting problems.

I'll start by saying that the ""Lunch Special"" Korma is NOT the same. In fact, the lunch special ""anything"" is not the same as the regular version. The lunch special Korma is missing multiple ingredients, has a much smaller portion, and it has a characteristic watery-ness to it. It is borderline water korma. This has also been mentioned by other reviewers.

Okay, you don't like the lunch special, but why the 1 star? Why not maybe 3? 

For the past few months, they almost NEVER make your food within their specified time frame. Order over the phone and they'll say 15 minutes, but you should expect it in 30 minutes. Maybe they're crowded? Nope. Unless you think 2-3 couples who've already been served their food constitutes as ""crowded"".

The next thing that has aggravated me for the last time is they began trying to pass off their  watery-goop, ghetto-rigged korma as the regular ""dinner"" version. Occasionally I get the real deal which is always satisfying, but after today when I stood around, yet again, for my 15-minute-late food and only to come home to Water Korma again, I'm done.
It's become apparent that they don't begin cooking your food until you show up.

To top it off, the manager never knows how to pronounce my name. 
They never put napkins in the bag. They never put forks or spoons. You have to actually tell them.

Lastly, the prices are pushing it. Their naan is $3 and in my opinion you need to get two orders of it because they do not give enough naan. My dish and naan was $20. That's $20 for a meal that will feed one regular-sized male person.

2016943,2015-07-09,12,DNSDAtD6uxQkoZkQe2v4ew,"Flavors are on point here at Curry Leaf. No buffet, just a la carte entrees, apps, sides, and desserts. I stuck to some fairly safe favorite dishes and found them all to be of great quality with deep, complex flavors. Ambiance is going for an upscale feel but pricing is reasonable.

SAAG PANEER: Pure vegetarian Indian comfort, with unusually creamy and plentiful paneer. Pairs fabulously with the garlic naan (which was deliciously fragrant and beautifully blistered), this is my preferred meal.
ROGAN JOSH: BF's pick, ordered medium, with a spicy and flavorful sauce. Lamb was in large, plentiful chunks but could have been more tender. Both main dishes included rice.
BAINGAN BHARTA: Side of tandoori-smoked eggplant mash was contender for my favorite dish, with great smoky flavor and good texture. A bargain at $6/side.
KULFI TRIO: We couldn't resist dessert, and the house-made ice creams fulfilled out sweets craving with a bright mango flavor, sweet raspberry, and nutty pistachio. Couldn't pick a favorite as they were all good, with great creamy consistency. 

Interior is upscale with modern (but slightly uncomfortable) chairs and a large bar area (but no alcohol license?), makes for an intimate date-night dinner spot. Unclear whether they plan to expand seating into the adjacent patio area. Service was attentive and polite throughout. 

This is one of those places I would come back and get the exact same meal, rather than trying more on the menu. They do the classic dishes extremely well and the portions were generous. Great option for a vegetarian meal.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,20,12,4,5yAHmfdKnHYmyyYlrMG-Fg

I had the traditional Murgh Makhani. Since I am lactose intolerant, I asked to make it without dairy. The waiter returned with the good news that the chef would accommodate. Man did he ever. The chicken was cooked perfectly. In the red sauce I tasted, new flavors as each second passed. The waiter said be prepared to have your mind blown. He was not kidding. This was the best tasting Indian dish, I have ever eaten. I also had Jeera Aloo, which are roasted potatoes made with many different spices. This was less successful, although still extremely tasty and well worth trying. The rice was also cooked perfectly. I am not a fan of bread, so I can not comment on the roti. 
The atmosphere exuded calm. The colors simple but felt at home, perfect for a modern Indian restaurant. I look forward to sampling all that Curry Leaf has to offer. The food is extraordinary. The only knock is it is a bit pricey. But if you want Indian food at its finest, you will not mind paying the few extra dollars",uWJQO7VpdsVenUkuq2B3Vg,4,0,5,j3DoQrDoqJS0zK_PrPxsGw

2059090,2016-08-29,0,DNSDAtD6uxQkoZkQe2v4ew,"I have now been to curry leaf about 4 separate times. However, last night the service was so slow and one of my typically favorite dishes was so flavorless, the group I was with had to ask if it had changed owners. Although our servers were very friendly, we had to repeatedly ask for water, and during the first hour and a half our group only managed to get our appetizers (we had a party of 4 and there were maybe three other tables). When we asked why the food was taking so long, we were told the kitchen was understaffed and there were a lot of to-go orders. While I understand a kitchen being understaffed it would have been nice for the server to forewarn us that the food was taking longer than usual and perhaps bring us some naan before our dishes. Also, to-go orders shouldn't take priority over customers sitting at their table in the restaurant!
That being said, I have loved it here previously. The chicken 65 and the fried shrimp in soy/garlic appetizers are delicious and different. The tikka masala, and paneer korma, along with the saag (with chicken or paneer) are also each delicious. Don't miss out on the lemon rice, or the bullet stuffed naan, or a side of lentils (normally).  I really hope that the next time the service and the lentils, which for some reason this time came out flavorless and watery, improve.

The interior has a fun Indian vibe. The menu is kind of small but oh so good. I've tried a few other Indian restaurants in Vegas and absolutely hated them so I'm glad Curry Leaf broke the bad streak. 
With most meals they offer Nan bread and I always choose the Garlic Nan. It is so good that I could eat a whole meal of just Nan. Dip that Nan in your Lamb or chicken dish and it's even better. 
They offer some unique beers that you won't find at other establishments as well as wine and non alcoholic beverages.

There doesn't appear to be a restaurant here. Welcome to Curry Leaf Flavors of India!

I might get flamed for this (do people even say that anymore?) but I feel pretty strongly about this: unless you're utterly desperate to have Indian food for dinner, avoid having dinner at an à la carte Indian restaurant. It's just a terrible value compared to the ubiquitous (and inexpensive) Indian lunch buffets available all over the world.

Curry Leaf is no exception. It's all à la carte, and the good stuff on the menu is $13-$15 a portion. The portion size is disappointingly small-to-medium. There are $7-$9 ""side dishes"" of things like baingan bharta (good but annoyingly small portion) and dal, and after you add in the naan ($4+) and biryani ($13) you're looking at least $30/person and you might still be hungry when you're done. There is no way that the parties of 8 that I saw dining got enough to eat. Ask for extra white rice and you will be dinged $3-$5 depending on how much more you want. That's pretty telltale.

The Paneer Tikka Masala ($15) was served lukewarm and it was a stingy portion, as was the side dish of baingan bharta ($7). A 22oz. Taj beer was $9. Again, *all the money* for a strip-mall Indian joint that would be impossible to find if it weren't' for Yelp.

Aside from the general bad value, dinner was pretty tasty, but it all came out *way* too fast to be entirely made-to-order. My guess is the curries are all pre-made the day before and added to the proteins you order. I'd bet a lunch buffet on it.

For apps we had the Lamb Seekh Kebab, Samosa Teen Tarike Se & Garlic Shrimp.  All really good but Garlic Shrimp was on a level all on its own.

For entrees, we had the Tandoori Salmon, Lamb Vindaloo & Chicken Tikka Masala.  Again, all really excellent!  Asked for mild to accommodate the child in the party and my wife that likes it a little less spicy than myself.  All arrived with good portions and mild.  Still tons of flavor and dipping the Garlic Naan in the sauce is always a must.

We also had the side Kuchumber Salad.  Again, excellent.

Mumbai is famous for its seafood so the fish curry here has to be amazing, and it is. Try a Mumbai Mule to wash it down too.

In South Asian cuisine the simple things are the determining factors to successful restaurants and you can tell by the amount of south asians that frequent the place that the food is second to none. 

Samosas are amazing, naan is good, lunch specials are great. I love the decor and atmosphere. I've been for casual dining and held business dinners here and no one has left disappointed.

What makes it contemporary, I suppose, is the small plates. I have one Pakistani friend that doesn't like tapas because he isn't full unless he has a curry, so we were able to keep everyone happy here.

My favorite here is the lentil soup made with curry powder.. best lentil soup in town. I visit this place every few months.

The curry bowls here are very tasty. I tried the Aloo Gobi, Madras, and Kofta. The Aloo Gobi is very flavorful and I loved it. I also tried the vindaloo and marasala here on previous visits but didn't like it so much, there are local spots that does it better in my opinion.

One thing I'd say is that the portion size is very small. For around 16 bucks you order a meat vindaloo dish and you get a small bowl of curry and rice. Wouldn't stop me from coming back for the Aloo Gobi and Lentil Soup though.",dqU621Ol6vswgP5BjDPU_w,4,3,4,kwgedUb6a4cblkh5fQCGJA

Once you enter it is liked you are transported from the west side of Las Vegas to Mumbai. Lots of interesting decor and a full bar once you enter the restaurant. As I noticed on the wall from the Las Vegas Review Journal ""Curry Leaf's colorful atmosphere shows attention to detail..."" I truly concur.

We were quickly seated by a window and if the weather permitted, they have patio seating available. We looked over the drink menu and decided on the Mojito Mumtaj 4/5, dangerous as it tastes mostly like fruit juice and The Himalayan 5/5, very strong and served in a goblet. we started with some garlic naan bread and dipped in the sauces. For entree's we shared the madras paneer with veggies 4/5, would get more spicy than medium next time and the vindaloo chicken spicy 5/5, nice flavor and even better to clean up the last bit of sauce with another garlic naan bread ;-)

For dessert they had a Yelp check in offer for a free rice pudding dessert! Served nice and warm, you can't beat F-R-E-E! Overall a great date night meal and under $60 without gratuity.

My experience tonight prompted this review. Tonight, I called to place a to go order and was placed on hold, but I could still hear everything. Right after I was placed on hold, the woman started to take down a huge walk in take out order. After 10 mins, and the order was placed and paid for, nobody came back to the phone to take my order (it's like they set the phone down and walked away). I called back numerous times for the next 30 mins and the line was busy. I finally got through and placed my to go order (an entree, extra rice and plain naan). When I finished, the woman said ""that's all you want?"" How rude. I said yes and she told me, ""well if that's all your ordering it will be 50 mins before it will be ready. I'm busy and just got a big order."" I told her I know I heard the order while I was on hold for 10 mins. She said ""oh yeah, well I have a full house now and if that's all you're going to order it will be at least 50 mins."" I hung up after that. I got the impression that if I ordered more food and spent more money it wouldn't be such a hassle. What poor communication and customer service skills.

Unfortunately, it seems I'm 15 minutes away from any Indian restaurant. Of three top contenders, I ended up siding with curry leaf.

I called in to make my order of lamb Tikka masala with basmati rice and garlic naan - the classic. It only had a 15 minute wait, just about the time it would take to drive there.

It was easy to park and there was no fuss to pick up my order - very smooth. After what seemed like a very long drive back home smelling tantalizing aromas, I finally got to dig in.

First off, they did a good job packing everything. No spillage or anything like that. Taste was excellent. Lamb was very tender, and the curry was flavorful. I ordered medium, and it was at the appropriate heat level. Rice did its job soaking up curry, and garlic naan cleaned up well too.

Must mention that the presentation of the dishes was appetizing as well. This is a well run restaurant with knowledgeable and engaging staff. 
Melica, it was a delight having ongoing food related discussions with you. You are a lot of fun and that helped make our visit very comfortable. 
Lamb Seekh Kebabs - Had this dish as an appetizer and, at first bite, we knew that the chef had the control over the Tandoor oven and preparation of its dishes. Kebabs were spiced to our liking and paired really well with the Merlot. 
Roghan Josh - Prepared and spiced just right. It's creamy texture balanced with succulent cubes of lamb was overwhelmingly delicious. Portion was generous and we fought to share at the table. It made the Merlot's day. 
Chicken Tandoori - This dish at one time, used to be the pride of the Indian Cuisine. The advent of Buffets and the dish's inclusion in it by unskilled chefs has diluted its value over time. This is my all time favorite Indian dish and CURRY LEAF absolutely delighted me with its flavors and tenderness. This dish was finger licking good. The Merlot saw its last drops vanish. 
Gulab Jamun w/ Vanilla Ice Cream - Nice combination. Perfectly satisfied the sweet tooth in me. A dessert item that closes the entire experience very well.

First off, try the grilled spicy shrimp appetizer. Amazing. The texture is at least as good as the flavor. It's a bit crispy and the shrimp is done to perfection. Also got samosas. Three different fillings to try and all good.

For the main course, went with a staple of chicken tikka masala and the lamb rogan josh. I liked the chicken tikka more but the rogan josh had more spice. Paired those up with nan bread and a vegetable raita. Take my advice here, get the raita with whatever you order! It's a yogurt dish that pairs with everything.

Once again, no recommendations on appetizers or entrees. Server just walks up and said ""ready to order some appetizers?"" I had to ask for recommendations and suggestions. 
Also, we tried to take advantage of the Yelp offer for free naan by checking in but was told it was only available by ordering the chef's special. It felt like deceptive advertising.
All this before my food was even served. The host was polite and the food runner that just brought my food was very nice. Lets hope the food makes up for the service.

I admired the peacock curtains - super pretty. Good service; birthday girl waitress informed us she will be leaving for the night but the others can assist. No delay in any wait. Water glasses filled without asking.

Chana masala was okay. The chickpeas were whole.  Decent serving bowl size. Seems best to eat it with naan. Flavor spice was 3 that tasted more like 1. Weren't sure with the spice level here as other places seem to vary with what is considered spicy. 

Lamb tikka masala extremely excellent! Could boost up the spice level in this one too. Nicely paired with mushroom rice. Would definitely order this again and highly recommend this dish. With the sauce left over makes perfect for naan scooping. This holds the highest rank of what we ordered for dinner.

Mushroom rice... really good. Seemed a little moist than expected, but rice wasn't stuck together. Rice has several choices other than mushroom to include in ordering rice.

Garlic naan was semi burnt. The puffy parts of the bread looked like burnt bubbles. Still finished it since the bottom was edible and garlic flavor was still present on the taste buds.

Indian flavor score 4.5****. Was thinking how much more better fresh cooked food tasted than the ready mades I usually purchase for my easy lunches. Yeah this place gets my vote for a return visit.",JQIZhoQB-Tg9hdBEj90m4g,30,28,4,TKE9UCxXh7gvDKHEBRIKFg

I was excited to try this place. The wine isn't worth your money it's cheap brand so skip that but the food is DELICIOUS! The garlic naan was perfect. My boyfriend and I split the Madras Lamb and Chicken Tikka Massala. We LOVE spicy foods but we're not accustomed to Indian spice. We ordered it medium and that had barely any spice at all, they were still flavorful and delicious but if you like spice order it hot. 
We were disappointed in the lack of spice even in the middle spice range. 
I'll come back 100% I highly recommend this place. The chicken was tender and juicy, not dry at all and the flavor was there but lacking spice.. ( have I said that enough ? Haha) 

My only reason besides the spice for a 4:5 instead of 5/5 is my napkin was stained with grease and that's really off putting. 
Please toss any greasy stained napkins that even through the wash won't be clean again...

The food came out in 15 mins, not too bad on the wait. The dish came with a small bowl of rice and they were ok. I have had better. I thought it was pricey being $16 the portion was small compared to other restaurants. I do really like Rose Lassi.

I knew about this place for a while and since me and the BF wanted to try something new and didn't know what else to eat, we figure on giving this place a try. 

I don't really know Indian food too well so, the BF did all the ordering. Based on Yelp photos, I did know that I wanted the fried cauliflower appetizer. 
Also ordered the samosas, cheese naan, mixed tandoori plate, and lemon rice. 

Can I just tell you that the cauliflower app was the most amazing thing we ordered tonight! Hello, it's fried cauliflower covered in some sauce that reminds me of BBQ sauce but WAY BETTER! I've come to really love cauliflower apps lately, it's like the new broccoli. 

Samosas were super bomb. Flakey but, thick. If that makes sense. I loved that it wasn't meat samosas, all veggies. Corn, garbanzo beans, and some green thing/veggie. 

Mixed tandoori came with chicken, shrimp, beef. Lots of protein on grilled onions and peppers. Didn't care for the chicken too much cuz it tasted dry. Nothing a little mint chutney sauce can't fix tho! 

Lemon rice was good and they gave a lot. Didn't realize it was that much in one order. 

Cheese naan is best describe like a fluffy quesadilla! Super bomb! I wanna try the cheese with garlic next time. Cheese garlic naan = mind blown!!!! 

All in all great meal. Nice service! And all close to home. Can't wait to come back for more cauliflower. 

Next time I wanna try the garlic shrimp!",uERlyO-ASZag6XXouCrkhg,7,8,5,x7fU8oLfIMxhlXtXZjyr3g

It's in a small strip mall south of Tropicana on Fort Apache. 

When you walk inside the place is beautiful, spotless and the decor is really nice. Nothing like any Indian place in town. 

The food is excellent in taste and quality. I had a Cucumber salad to start us off and it was so tasty because of the dressing. They took time to cut up the vegetables and it was presented beautifully. 

Chicken Vindaloo curry and chicken tikka masala curry medium were so full of flavor we were both surprised. If chunks of white meat chicken as well. Plain rice came with both and we ordered a side of lemon rice. First time ever I have had a side rice that actually tasted of what they said it was. Light and fluffy yellow and tasted of lemon. Not over powering but you knew. 

Two beers and a glass of wine with garlic naan bread that was awesome and it was 60 dollars, a really good deal for a lot of food. 

Smaller menu than any Indian place we have seen which is nice. Too many places have ten page menus and there is no way you can make that many dishes well. Smaller menu means quality and it showed. 

If you like Indian food you have to try this place.

Called for a take out order. Ordered 2 lunch special Rogan Josh. Picked it up and it came out to be bland and very watery. There are only 4 scraps of meat and all watery soup. Called and spoke to the manager Elmer and informed him of the quality of food. I asked for a replacement or a change of order because I wasn't expecting a soupy dish and the portion wasn't satisfying. 

I asked for a dinner portion instead and an order of naan bread and I'll will pay for the difference. The Manager told me not to worry about it and to come pick it up in 10 mins. 

Apparently, the manager has inability to listen to customer's need as two lunch specials were made instead of the order of dinner portion. I came back in once again and told him this is not what I asked for over the phone. He said the chef just want to make the same exact thing I ordered in the beginning. Since when does the chef decision overrule the customers' want ?

Seriously? How cheap can you be? I have told them that I will pay for the difference if needed but saving that nickle and dime is more important to them than customers' want. 

I told him that I don't the lunch special and I would like to have a dinner portion instead. He grabbed my lunch portion and said he will put it in one container. Really ??? 

Wow. This manager needs to be fired. He does not listen, has poor attitude and bad customer service. I told him that I don't feel comfortable with him taking the food away from my view and doing stuff at the back which I can't see. His attitude continue to worsen.

At this point in time, it's useless to even try to talk to him. I walked out and told the lady server that it's a shame to have him ruin the establishment. I have been coming here for a while and they rather lose a regular customer and save that nickle and dime than to make things right. 

Ritesh, if you are the actual owner and reading this, my advice to you is that don't lose your customer over nickel and dime. You need to fire Elmer and retrain your staff to listen to customers' want. Do not say one thing and do another.",PwS260gy26l3LDIoNa_lqQ,3,0,1,PIiFOfB71P51wjffNzRx-g

Curry Leaf Flavors of India offers just that, delicious clean flavors you can savor. My first experience included the samosa appetizer. A samosa trio with two dipping sauces. The green sauce gave the samosa a creamy mint compliment while the other sauce added a sweet and slight tang flavor -both delicious and I found myself double dipping! 
For lunch, we shared the Chicken Saag, Chicken Tikka Masala and garlic naan. The flavors were superb with just the perfect amount of spicy kick and flavor -you can request your comfort in spice level.

I called late in the afternoon for pick up after their dinner opening time.  I ordered the trio of samosas called Samosa Teen Tarike.  One was filled with green peas, one with potato, and one with paneer and corn.  The pastry was light and fried perfectly and the fillings were very tasty.  I really didn't need the sauces that were packed with them--a mint sauce and a tamarind sauce.  Both were good.

For mains, I ordered chicken tikka masala for my wife--spice level mild--and I got the Madras curry with chicken and spice level hot.  Both were well done and the sauces were mild and hot as we both wanted.  We got two containers of basmati rice with the curries.

I got a double order of garlic naan and it was as good as the first time I was here.  The order was packed perfectly for the short ride home and everything was hot when I opened the containers.

A word about service.  Navi took my payment and offered me a glass of water at the bar while I waited.  Mr. Patel, the owner, came out to speak with me as he had done when I was there before.

The pro:
1. food is delicious!!! from Nan to entree, they are all so good, their lamb is super tender as well as the chicken, I don't think I will ever go back to another indian buffet restaurant now because when your food is made to order, it just simply taste better that way.
2. Interior is very pretty, clean and inviting! waiter and waitress are all very polite and nice!

The Con:
1. service is ok....a bit slow sometimes especially when it's busy, if they are not busy, the service is slightly faster
2. Watch out on the tip suggestion on their receipt, you should NEVER tip on the 8.1% tax, ONLY tip on the original food price, but the tip suggestion they give you also include the percentage on the tax part, I do not like that at all, and hope they will fix this soon.
3. If you go, I strongly suggest you go during lunch time, it's much cheaper and you get nan for free, they told me dinner portion is bigger, but it comes in the same bowl they serve me during lunch, and you will have to pay extra for Nan as well....maybe they did give me a little more, but it's not anything significant to where I can tell...(honestly I can't tell at all that dinner is bigger....)",OmSz8hJI5tbG7Ww0Q9IkNQ,2,0,4,KDlzBjq9AJISuOmtZMVfMg

I took the food home, then I realized there was no utensils given with the food. I thought maybe it's because I was eating 'indian' food, and it's their tradition, but they could have asked me at least. Well I still had forks at home, so I managed to eat it.

The food itself was alright. It was decent tasting, but it was very oily. By the end of my food, all I had left was oil. I might try another indian food next time.",s01liMq8lG4G3f3AvJMi5w,2,1,3,dxDt2mlHoBaVZrDsh8n9RQ

My knowledge of Indian food was limited to the curries, but I have never been much of a curry fan - so I skipped over Indian food in general.

I saw Curry Leaf on Instagram and they had some lamb dishes that intrigued me. So my husband and I went!

We told our server we had never had Indian food and our server was great and gave us some suggestions and seemed excited to share with us. That made us feel a lot more comfortable, so if you don't know what to get - don't feel awkward asking!  One of the other servers who was refilling our drinks was also amazing, we mentioned it being our first experience and he was so passionate sharing his favorites. It made us excited to come back and try more dishes.

We started with the fried cauliflower (gobi manchurian) and my husband got Dum biryani with lamb, which was a rice dish in a small pot with a Naan like cover . I got Lamb Nihari (lamb shank). They had a lamb chop appetizer that pictures look amazing of - and I should have gotten that too. I wish it was a dinner option.
We got Gulab Jamun for dessert which might have been the best thing ever. It is a must have.

4530065,2015-06-23,5,DNSDAtD6uxQkoZkQe2v4ew,"Experience:  my friend Lance (check out his review on here) tried this place an raved about the food. So he invited a few friends to come try it out. We came around 7:00 for dinner. 

Facility: beautiful!  This is a very upscale, modern decor with heavy Indian influence. So beautifully done!!! They have tables and chairs, bar seating, and some booths. They have some outside seating coming soon too!  I loved being able to look around and having some things to look at...from the Ballywood-esque mural, to the beautiful window treatments. I have to mention the seats were pretty comfortable too, which is rare in a restaurant. 

Service:  This is the only reason, I'm marking them down. Otherwise they would have a 5 star from me. They are very polite servers; however, the first thing we ordered, was my cheese naan and the eggplant. This was my main meal. The cheese naan was the last thing that came out, after asking 4 times for it.  I was actually full eating other folks food by the time I got it. One waitress I questioned on the status said they didn't even have cheese naan, although it was on the menu. Then she brought another Garlic naan instead. When they finally brought my naan, they said the extra garlic naan they brought by mistake was on them.  Of course!  How about comping my cheese naan instead!  They also took forever to bring out another friends Chicken Marsala. Hopefully they get it together soon. I do love how personable the staff was, and the owner even came out to greet and talk to us.

Food:  A-maz-ing!  I love Indian food and this did not disappoint.  Everything we had was good...honestly, there was nothing I disliked. We ordered a lot, so I will try to remember all we ordered. We asked for everything very hot on the spicy scale. 
Cheese naan - 5/5 so good and cheesy!!!
Garlic naan - 5/5 hot and fresh!
Basmati rice - we had order rice to go along with our meals, as it's not included. It was cooked perfectly. 
Chili Paneer - 6/5 yep, that good!  It had a great chili sauce it was tossed in, and was crispy outside, with a creamy, cheesy middle. Yum!!!
Murgh Tikka Trio - 4/5 every piece of chicken was spiced well and still juicy in the middle. I did find myself adding more sauce though. 
Samosa - 4/5 loved, but the cheese corn was not my fav.  I loved the potato the most and then the pea. They were all crispy, hot and good!
Baingan Bharta - the eggplant dish I ordered - 5/5 so yum with a nice texture from the pop of the peas. I loved the flavor and this went well with the naan 
Chicken Saag - 5/5 great flavors, tender chicken. 
Madras - 5/5 we ordered the lamb for this one...it was my favorite. It was creamy and loaded with flavor. Loved to dip my naan in the sauce too!!!
Chicken Tikka Marasala - 5/5 this was the spiciest of our dishes with an amazing flavor
*I also wished they offered something complimentary, such as naan with a full meal or even the rice with a big order such as ours.  I hate when places make you order every piece of the meal to make it a meal. 

Overall: I do realize, they are brand new and still working on their groove, so I'm definitely willing to come back in a month or so, and hope they got it all together, so I can bump to a 5. Because the food is already there!!!!!
Come try it out!  It's delicious!!!",-50XWnmQGqBgEI-9ANvLlg,8,7,4,4UpVz97gY6jXk3ks4MpOgQ

Everything me and my buddy ate was amazing.  I'm primarily a vegetarian, but I will occasionally eat a little meat and had to try some of his chicken dishes.  I'll start with the appetizers:

Chili Panner: Think of chunks of smooth cheese, almost cheese-curd like, in a sauce similar to Kung Pao, but obviously more complex.  DELICIOUS!  This will become a regular item for me

Chicken 65:  Chunks of fried chicken in a thick tikka masala-like sauce.  Need I say more? 

Naan:  Solid good ol' garlic naan

Entrees...

He had the Chicken Tikka Masala which is of course a fairly common dish for us Caucasians, but it was above average.  Huge chunks of white meat chicken in an aromatic fragrant sauce.  

I had the Dal Makhani which is sort of like an Indian Chili with lentils and red beans.  MIND BLOWN!  This was soooooo amazing.  I ate almost the whole portion which can be dangerous if you eat a large amount of Lentils lol, but I couldn't stop.

Most of the options come with a bowl of rice. The lamb nihari is one of my faves. The meat is so tender and flavorful. The lamb tikka masala is a curry with onion tomato sauce.

5013175,2015-07-01,2,DNSDAtD6uxQkoZkQe2v4ew,"We finally have a great Indian restaurant on our side of town.  Took my parents and brother from out of town there for a belated Father's Day dinner.  My parents' previous experience with Indian food was sparse and bad.  My father said he thought Indian food was gross and my mom said she got the runs the only time she ate it.  But, my reputation for picking good places to eat is deservedly awesome so they went with it.

I ordered lamb saag and chicken tikki masala with garlic and butter naan on the side.  Samosas for appetizer.  Pretty standard but I wanted to go with popular dishes and maximize the likelihood they'd enjoy it.  I shouldn't have worried...the food was really excellent.  Flavorful and beautiful.  The samosas were nice and crispy on the outside and no toughness to the pastry at all.  It just shattered in your mouth like it should.  Fillings and sauces were delicious.

The saag and tikki masala were excellent.  Excellent with rice, excellent with the naans, and excellent eaten all by themselves.  I ordered them mild because of the parents but I think a little heat would have made them even better.  I'll do that next time.

Our dessert was absolutely fantastic as well.  We normally don't get dessert since Chinese usually just eat fruit or weird sweet soups but I ordered us the milk cake with vanilla ice cream to share.  Fantastic buttery note on the cakes finish and the ice cream was fantastic.  Nice contrast of hot cake and cold ice cream.  It really was the best dessert I've had in a long time and at $5 it was a steal.  If you ordered that on the strip it's $12 easily.

Hope everyone checks this place out.  The chef told me they've been busy but when I went it was near empty.  We NEED this place to thrive.  It's exactly the kind of neighborhood restaurant that deserves to be a huge success.  Decor was beautiful and the service was excellent.  Waitress and bartender were beautiful and that never hurts either.  ;)  Highly recommended.",-Ox7QPz0G56GOzT0ex-f5Q,6,2,5,L0EU_7Nwd6uMlVF8L2LprQ

We ordered:

Chicken Tikka Masala
Lamb Rogan Josh
Saag Shrimp

Overall, it was okay. It was good, but for some reason, some of the curry seemed powdery? It's a weird texture/consistency to me. But, you know. Whatever. Maybe I don't know anything.

Service was awful. The waiter barely checked on us. As someone who works at a very busy restaurant, I understand how stressful things can be on a server. But to not check on us until we have been finished for over 20mins is unacceptable. 
Upon being seated, we had another server, who made a weird face upon greeting us...probably because we had a faint smell of herb. I'm guessing he didn't want to serve African Americans that smelled of herb (he most likely made some general stereotypes about us). So instead of following through with us, he decided we were a waste of his time. So he sent another server to assist us instead. 

This other amateur server immediately came out of character after taking our order. He wasn't professional as he was with all of his other Caucasian tables. He even said ""fuck"" a few times while conversing with us. Also very unacceptable. 

Chicken Tikka wasn't authentic at all. When I asked for a side of the Tikka masala sauce it was bland and not spicy at all (level 5). 

By the looks of it this is NOT an authentic Indian place. I saw no Indian staff members. This is place probably where white people go to enjoy Indian food in the comfort of their own kind.

When I asked the server if we could have some yogurt because it was spicy she immediately insisted they remake it with less spice, I assured her that wasn't necessary. She then mention two types of yogurt and asked which one I wanted, I wasn't sure so I asked which was better and she said the vegetable yogurt, and she was right it was so excellent and a great complement to the dish. We also had the yellow lentil soup which was very good also. They always filled our glasses with water and was very attentive, service was excellent!

I was sold on Lamb Rogan Josh within seconds of perusing the menu.  The boneless pieces of braised lamb in thick, rich curry hit the inside ""spot"" that only Indian cuisine can.  The slow cooked tenderness of the meat was ideal and required minimal work with a knife.  Hearty and comforting, it was like wearing a mental snuggie.

My wife got the Saag Paneer and enjoyed every bit of its pureed spinach glory.  Their homemade cheese was a bit different than any other we've tried as it was softer, more like buffalo mozzarella, yet it still retained some of that signature firmness that made it undeniably paneer.  Maybe their secret is milk with a higher fat content?  We ordered this dish ""hot"" which wasn't over the top spicy, but a nice smooth burn from start to finish.   

The $6 vegetable sides were great to see as well.  Many places don't offer a half portion, so if I really wanted Chana Masala, my only choice would be to order an extra entrée.  We went with the Baingan Bharta, basically an eggplant mash which was a nice change up from the other plates.  I also liked that the bowls of rice that accompanied each dish were of generous portions unlike their only nearby competitor a few miles south, which only offer rice in a kid size.

I am curious to see if they stick with entrees for lunch or cave with the rest of the in crowd and go buffet.  That won't deter me from going back during those hours though.  Can't wait to try more!",8DEyKVyplnOcSKx39vatbg,95,75,5,pAf992EBuBEW84gfnX-UFA

For appetizers we ordered the Gobi Manchurian; which was breaded and fried cauliflower with Indian spices and sauce. They had me at this dish. It was so savory and flavorful, with some good heat to it but just enough that you could enjoy it without sweating all the spices out. 

For entrees we got the Korma and Rogan Josh (lamb). The only complaint was that we were too full to order more! Again, so flavorful and savory. We mopped everything up with our paneer stuffed naan. Soooo good!!

We topped everything off with the Gulab Jamin for dessert. Hard to explain but it was like cake soaked in sweet milk, breaded, fried and then served with ice cream garnished with cardamom and honey. Orgasmic.

5607812,2015-09-22,4,DNSDAtD6uxQkoZkQe2v4ew,"Overall this was a disappointing experience - everything fell a little flat. There are better indian places in Vegas. 

Decor: Fantastic. I really liked the layout and ambiance. The furniture was modern and the decorators did a nice job of making this look like an indian bistro. Great photos on the walls and the wine rack over the bar on the wall was nice. 

Service: Meh... Attentiveness was fine, she didn't communicate well any answers to questions we asked. 

Cocktails: This is where the majority of points were lost. First of all, don't have any of the cocktails. The server lost points for not being able to describe in greater detail a drink I got that had a masala seasoning to it with tequila. I asked if it was served up or on the rocks and she said on the rocks. Out came what could be described as salty, room temperature, tequila masala broth (with no tequila taste) with two floating frozen cat testicles for ice cubes. Not sure what they were supposed to be, but this drink was absolutely horrid. Usually, I lower my gaze and bite the bullet on something I order, but this one was a for sure send back. My alternate drink was a Jameson and Ginger ale -- they had no ginger ale. *le sigh* My dining partner got a mojito with curry leaf -- rum, curry leaf, and soda -- no flavor whatsoever. The waitress was cool with taking my drink off the menu, but we pushed through the mojito and just stuck to nothing unique for the rest of the meal.

FOOD: Average. Plating was nice, portions were good, everything was just a little less good than I've had in several other Indian venues in Vegas. Appetizer was a three skewered chicken dish - great for two people. A little inconsistent on the cook of the meat, but nothing raw. Lamb Saag and Chicken Tikka Masala were the entrees with Jeera Aloo and Garlic Naan. Everything was edible but just flat; not good enough to return. 

We came based on the reviews and won't return instead choosing one of three other places that do everything except decor better.",3EPBhYWMcglaqhJYgcofHg,3,2,2,xQUQvSMQrr4Fs8sB1nUJZw

I also ordered one of their house cocktails, the curry mojito. Appetizers came out quick as well as the drinks. The cocktail was a little disappointing. I was expecting the curry flavor to be more present but the flavor of the drink was flat. Definitely enjoyed the trio. Our main entrees came out as soon as we finished our appetizers. I fairly enjoyed my vindaloo while my girlfriend enjoyed her masala. Probably just a preference in food types. Definitely a good place for lunch and portions weren't too big.

Ok, back story, I live in N. Las Vegas, Aliante area, my gf used to think this was her favorite restaurant in the world and she wanted to take me. We travel all the way there (it's a 35min drive). My meal comes out a good 4-5min before my gf. This puts us both awkward situation and I try to share. Because she is treating me I don't want to seem rude and I completely force down my meal, I'm not complaining, I'm just thinking to myself: ""next time she wants to come here avoid and ask her to make it a girls night."" Truly, if just myself didn't like the meal I would've never spent this time to warn you, but... it wasn't just me!!!

My Gf as she was eating her meal looked horrible; I asked what's wrong and she said: ""eat this chicken?"" I tried to, I really did, but what I was chewing was like horrible old frozen hard meat with the freezer burns and everything not even dethawed and forced cooked to where it was so rubbery it almost made me sick I had to spit it out in the napkin. 

The only good thing(s) I can say about our meal was our server was AWESOME, kind and hard working (I tipped him $9 on a $32 tab because I felt so bad he worked at such a horrible food location) and the ambiance was beautiful. But as far as the food... 

I study under a Swami from India who cooks amazing food when he's in the states. I legit, love, immensely Indian food. This my dear friends reading is not Indian food. 

Every place has its bad nights; this place was definitely sharing theirs as a fellow diner family next to us was so disgusted by their meal they were complaining as well.

All in all, unless you want to be on the porcelain toilet at now 3:35am hating your life's decision to go here; please avoid this catastrophe at all costs.

Yes, my gf was also so disgusted by her meal she did say: ""never, ever, again will I go here."" Glad I don't have to voice my disgust to her and after this review and the hours it'll take to pass sitting on the toilet, afterwards, I'll forget this place and only will be reminded while scrolling through my reviews.

This is the best Indian food I've ever had. Knocking down a star for service.  

I've visited this restaurant three times on two separate trips - yes, the food was so good I visited it twice on one of the trips! I ordered vegetarian items and all was fresh and well spiced (I asked for spicy and they made it spicy). 

I usually get the aloo gobby and paneer saag. Both were excellent.

Service: I remember very clearly how I ordered take out and dessert that I ordered took FOREVER to be prepared although I told them that I am in a rush and they said it will only be a few minutes. It's fine if it takes long, but the waitress was incredibly rude to me. I eventually just asked for the whole order to be cancelled and walked out.

5740502,2017-04-08,4,DNSDAtD6uxQkoZkQe2v4ew,"Pretty sure this is ""Indian"" food not done by Indian people. It took a while for someone to seat me, because no one was working the front area despite there being next to no people in the restaurant. The music they played was loud, vulgar club music, though they switched to Indian music for a little while when a father and his young son came in. Then they switched back when they left.

The food was mediocre. The paneer tikka was about 50% overpriced (I initially misread the menu and thought it was $10 when I ordered, which would've been a more reasonable price point); four pieces of tikka with some out-of-place veggies accompanying it (broccoli, carrots, cherry tomatoes). The flavor of the sauce was too sweet, not complex or sophisticated, and underspiced, though the latter is a general trend in Indian restaurants not overwhelmingly patronized by people who really know the food.

They focus a lot on their alcohol, and it feels like a place for Americans to come and have a few drinks and eat something somewhat resembling real Indian food, like a non-chain ""Indian"" version of P.F. Chang. No thanks.

I reserve 1 star for the insultingly bad--stuff that makes me sick, or service that offends me, etc. This doesn't sink to that level. But I was deeply, deeply disappointed and given that there are other, better Indian options fairly close by, I can't imagine ever returning to this one.

EDIT: the same person who has responded to other negative reviews messaged me that I ""should've known that paneer is flavorless"", a rather odd response given that my critique was of the sauce, not the paneer itself. The paneer was fine. The sauce was not. It wasn't a matter of it being flavorless, it was a matter of it being too sweet, and not complex.

Curry Leaf opened a few years ago & is just down the street from my house, but every time I went by I was on my way somewhere & never had the time. What a terrible waste of eating opportunities!!!! The moment we walked through the door we were welcomed by the most delicious smells, & our eyes were filled with beautiful saris in every floor-to-ceiling window. It was a breath-taking effect.

For starters we ordered the samosa trio appetiser, one each of potato, pea & corn, and the garlic shrimp and they were so darn good!!! I could have eaten a dozen samosa myself they were so tasty, but had to save  room for chicken korma & naan.

The chicken korma was so tender & flavourful, the sauce the perfect accompaniment to the fragrant rice & the naan - we got both butter & garlic varieties. The cucumber raita was one of the very best I've ever had.

I also got a takeaway order of Tandoor chicken & garlic naan, & even though I was still stuffed from lunch, I checked out the chicken later in the evening & OMG!!! Absolutely delicious -- tender, juicy & I cannot wait til dinner tomorrow to have this!!! 

I am so thankful that Janice chose Indian as our lunch, & I am thrilled that I finally tried Curry Leaf.

The appetizers, are also great, Chili Chicken is my favorite! The naan is available in the usual flavors, and it's always crisp and flaky on the outside, soft, tender and chewy on the inside. REALLY GREAT!

I would suggest going for lunch. There is no buffet to try several items, but the ala carte entrees come with the naan of your choice and include basmati rice that's light and fluffy. all for around $10-$12

They have a full bar, so might as well make it a two martini lunch while you're there!

ATMOSPHERE -

The restaurant is intimate, yet colorful. There is booth seating on the perimeters and tables in the middle. There is enough space between all tables so that you don't feel like you're sitting in your neighbors lap and can feel comfortable to speak freely at a reasonable level with your company.

All and all, I would feel comfortable having a casual date or business meeting here (and have) without any concern. Well worth the visit!",bc8C_eETBWL0olvFSJJd0w,5,4,5,kcQ9DGbMdl1RsA9m5bpk2A

I'm glad he did because every stereotype I had with Indian cuisine went out the window! The food was refreshing and the spice was just right. The food was colorful and unique.

Service wise was not bad, food took long to come but it was worth the wait. The service made you feel welcome. I'll definitely be more open to Indian dish. Everything they had were made from fresh ingredients, and you can definitely taste it.",N_hxsnWKVBVIqjAo_WlcCA,3,0,5,jlr8tjbfmVOE5415zmLOCg

The food is simply amazing, all the flavors, spices are so well balanced and unique that we can't get enough. We always get the chicken tikka (delicious) and the Dum Biryani (a pot of rice with veggies covered with bread, amaaazing!). My friends got the lassy once and it was delicious as well. Actually, there is nothing bad about this place. Staff is great, very nice and authentic as well.",cGY3BfrfJZLH3l3ETTQzeg,3,0,5,HwHSBJW1pUFus5dupINbhQ

I asked about a wine list, and our waiter, Navi, brought over a single page that had two whites and four reds (along with a few beers).  I'm a white wine drinker, but can't handle either of the two, Chardonnay and Pinot Grigio.  They honestly get me sick.  He offered to go to the nearby liquor store and bring back anything I wanted.  I was going to skip the wine (horrors!), but the owner came out.  He explained that they were set to have a meeting this week with the wine rep, and they were working on setting up a full bar service, including more and different wines and specialty cocktails.  Though I posted a pic of the current list, I'm going to remove it.  I don't think it's fair to keep it, since the restaurant is new and still a work in progress.

The owner, Ritesh, is a highly educated professional who switched to cooking as a second career.  We thoroughly enjoyed talking with him, and his desire to please radiated during our whole meal.  He insisted that Navi go get the wine I wanted, so I acquiesced. I was a happy camper.

The menu is so atypical of the usual Indian restaurant.  It's very small, but everything is cooked fresh.  Ritesh explained that this allows him to focus on the quality of each dish.  He will, though, be adding a few other items, including a thali, which we love to order, since it allows you to sample a variety of food.

We started with samosas, an order of three:  one with peas, another with potato, and the third with paneer and corn.  I don't think I've ever seen corn in an Indian restaurant before.  They were incredibly light, with pastry unlike the usual Chinese eggroll stuff you usually get, and the fillings were delicious, expecially the paneer and corn.  I'm not a pea lover, but loved the dense filling of that one.  The creamy mint and tangy tamarind sauces were yummy.

For our mains we shared a Saag curry bowl, with chicken added, as well as paneer and fresh vegetables.  We ordered both of our dishes medium-spicy, and that's how it was.  Along with that we got Baingan barta, and the smaller size of smoked eggplant dish was a good accompaniment to the large portion of Saag. The garlic naan we ordered was covered with minced FRESH garlic. Last time we had it, at a different place, I couldn't even see or taste garlic.  As it was, I could barely eat much of the main courses after the filling Samosas, but then, I'm not a very big eater.  We'll have my very favorite meal - leftovers - tonight.

As if the great food and phenomenal service weren't enough, a treat awaited us at the end.  Our wonderful waiter was nearby and heard me toast Herb for his birthday.  He said ""Oh, is it your birthday?""  I told him it had actually been two days before.  But when we finished packing up the leftovers, Navi and Ritesh came out with a birthday dessert for us to share - their beautiful Kulfi trio:  mango, pistachio and raspberry, artfully presented on a long rectangular plate.

Even better than the fact that it was a delicious meal, it was a special and memorable experience, and I wish Curry Leaf a long and prosperous life.",m-BZLIIh5PCAKnzH0qj_0Q,14,8,5,l75TMQWej45MVCJ5p6rmDw

We came in for lunch on a weekday so it was not very crowded. During lunch they offer a small lunch menu so if you want tandoori or anything crazy you need to come for dinner.

For lunch:
Samosa Trio
The trio means that there are stuffed with different delights. All 3 of them were delicious!! 

Lamb Rogan Josh
Chicken Tikka Masala 
Both curry dishes were very thick, rich and chocked full of meat unlike the lunch AYCE places and at the same price. Be warned that they are a little heavy on the spice so you may want to order a little lower than normal. We got medium and man it made me break a sweat while I was eating.
The garlic naan was phenomenal!!! I know it sounds silly to rave over a starch but man it was truly one of the best naan that I've had in Vegas. They were perfection topped with garlic!! 
Quality food man...

The only dim spots on our visit was the mango lassi which was almost milkshake consistency and was very sour. Aside from the lassi, your experience was top notch. 


We still need to make it for dinner to try the tandoori and other dishes but I can still say:

Eat with confidence

Wow! Was he correct.  We had mild to medium spicing, which was warm without being uncomfortable.  The flavors were rich and diverse from one dish to the next.  

The staff were friendly and attentive and several families had brought their children with them which created a true family friendly atmosphere to make the experience even richer.",EEfQak4YGFBG8aAUNM8rng,5,1,5,79yrXVk1FmYYt7Q2MEs5UQ

Next was tandoori chicken and tandoori shrimp, they brought us two tandoori chicken:( we told them it was wrong, and they corrected it very fast, unfortunately the shrimp wasn't great, but the Jerra aloo was the best I ever had in the States.",3-_bQjgIpamGo5kSGBWJRg,0,0,4,XJ5dveBkfrd_DbOd97QqcQ
