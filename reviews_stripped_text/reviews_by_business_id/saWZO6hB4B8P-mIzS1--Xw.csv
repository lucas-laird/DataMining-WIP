Amazingly, after being seated, it takes 3 minutes for someone to take our drink order.  After ordering a water and soda, the server rolls her eyes - i sense it was because we didn't order more.  Order the kabob combo,  geez i don't even remember what else, the delay in taking the order, the delay in getting the food, i really can't remember what the food was like - fuck this place !",N044aCKJv3G5WuvwT5AJcA,3,1,1,Mxunr5MHhLGRK-yP1VFtqw

The food for the buffet started trickling out after 1 PM and the last dish came out at exactly 2:11 PM, approx 1.5 hrs when we arrived.
The food was tasteless and the gentleman at the counter kept telling us everything will be out in 1 minute! I tried the meatballs but there seems to be egg shells in them! I could hear and taste the crunch!
We still tried what they brought out, but for the money we paid ($8,95 per), I would have rather gone to Zaytoon's on Durango at Twain.
This place is a sorry excuse for a restaurant.",nD5TPV68i9_uYuwLIxUTHg,0,0,1,JHWorbm9RtGkUSRb26AiOg

The Combination Platter is an excellent starter cant go wrong with it, and any of kebob dishes are winners.

The only thing holding me back from 5 stars is the Samosa isn't exactly what i'm used to and sorry to say but a bit on the bland side.",7A7FOLZZKL0iokQVOAEbgA,1,0,4,AAUFQRL3wiuC3EJNdcad7g

It's closed and for a true lover of Middle Eastern food - it was a great place for me to go so I'll give 5 stars in honor of its memory! :)  The food was amazing - I ordered from the menu but they had a killer buffet with an array of stews....and one of my favorite discoveries, Bouranee Baunjan!  Eggplant stewed with tomatos and peppers in sauce and yogurt.  I now make this myself as this place used a lot of oil in their dishes (maybe that's why it was so tasty).  I hope they've just moved and really haven't shut for good.  Vegas does not have a large selection of Middle Eastern restaurants.",rE8zEf8_M6OYCabKvE6Ylw,1,0,5,jjHQdC10Licv49UWJTRApg
2652219,2008-02-13,0,saWZO6hB4B8P-mIzS1--Xw,"I drove by randomly and caught the Kabob sign out of the corner of my eye. I was starving, but decided it would be worth waiting for the food to cook. And what can I say, it was the best decision of my life!

 I ordered the mixed kabob (chicken and shami - minced meat). The shami kabob was spiced just right and the meat is Halal to boot. The guy actually orders the meat from California. The prices were perfect as well. You don't need to spend a lot of money to eat well and have a good time.

The Persian/Afghani staff were very welcoming.  

Definitely, try this spot when in Vegas!",K15cZ4fpTAOlrGwihFresw,1,0,5,dC89HkaC7dw5OdJ-XjyLqg

I'm glad they're still open...  Our office had lunch from here & ordered 9 that's right 9 different items so we could share:  lamb shwarma, mediterranean salad, kebab combo, falafel plate, chix salad,  sausage plate, greek salad & 2 other unidentifiable plates that we ate (everyone put their order in & we all ate smorgasbord style).  Although some commented that some of the plates looked ""strange/unfamiliar""  all agreed it was all good.  Main standouts were the hummus, baba ganoush, ground beef meat kebaby strip thing.  No complaints despite many being dye hard McD, Taco fans but of course I tell 'em change is good especially Mediterranean!!",FjIu5bf6dPW7_V_-0Jg4kQ,0,0,3,cbOo7WOPukS-H2qTt_rPVg

This is my go-to place when I'm in the mood for a gyro, plain and simple.",-k5yFUChotBMGQgHdFZvLQ,2,0,3,vRKq5AB4X--SdBtwlJ5G_Q
3454106,2008-06-24,3,saWZO6hB4B8P-mIzS1--Xw,"I went here based on a couple reviews and I was expecting something fabulous.  The food was really good! Four stars for the food but two for the service equals a three star review.  What went wrong?  It took about 45 min's for a couple of pita sandwiches and we were the only ones there, and when the order came it was wrong!  My friend had to get his to go while I ate mine.

Don't get me wrong the food is really good and I would probably go back but come on people please get the order right, and speed up the service a little! Maybe somebody should tell them or leave a Yelp card to let them know that we love the food, but the service needs to be improved!",8zp4gAptFQbmJTHszbntLQ,2,3,3,MvtDuNEegs4a_3tv4clROg
3457342,2009-10-04,0,saWZO6hB4B8P-mIzS1--Xw,"Are you freakin' kidding me? I can't see how this place could possibly get more than one star. In fact, if I could give it ZERO stars, that's what I'd do.

Terrible service. And someone was having a big screaming match in the back, so they turned the music up to try to drown them out.

Tough, disgusting, dry, overcooked excuse of lamb kabob with sides that weren't any better. 

Decor = -1. Service = -1. Screaming match = -5. Food = -1

If you want good kabobs there are way better places to go.

Yuck.

Place seems to be under new ownership and the location looked different. I wonder if my past review was confused about locale or if this one is.",KefuZdgU_o1A6GM95T39Nw,0,0,1,1lloZDLd2R9-SBhfZ8n83g

4169241,2008-07-15,4,saWZO6hB4B8P-mIzS1--Xw,"I decided to check this place out to see what all the fuss was about.  Four reasons to not bother:

1. Despite being in a strip mall at the intersection of two major roads and close by several upscale neighborhoods, the ""Palace"" was completely empty at 12:30 on a weekday.  Never a good sign.  Guess this place doesn't do a lot of lunch business. 

2. I had the lamb kabobs which were dry and gamey like overcooked deer meat.  Meh.

3. The decor leaves much to be desired, the food leaves much to be desired, and the service was slow and grumpy.  Did I wake them from their midafternoon siesta?  

4. Even Olive Garden has more variety, more consistency, a more pleasant atmosphere and better value.  

With so many better options in Vegas, why would you come here?  Oh that's right.  No one does.",Ti5Bpj0eRmRYTBnep63S1Q,5,3,1,hCRicngcbNC6ijaRRA_ZuQ
4237381,2010-02-23,0,saWZO6hB4B8P-mIzS1--Xw,"The place is very average, but the food is good. I can get away with dinner for two under $30 with tip. If you're into atomosphere and trendiness, it's not for you. If you're not a snob, and want good food at a fair price, this is a good place. 

I don't reccomend it if it's a ""first date"" and you're trying to impress.",QvLg2kxqHHahxxOlHlEIZw,0,0,3,j05T73NFG3D_wSJ27BGqwA
4484547,2010-07-18,0,saWZO6hB4B8P-mIzS1--Xw,"This is an update to my previous review, and I'm happy to say that I wasn't disappointed.

This time it was Poker Widows' Night, and I went with my two friends.  Two of us (I was one of them) had the Lamb Kabobs, and they were incredible - lean, tender, juicy, and perfectly seasoned.   As on the previous visit, we ordered rice for one, salad for the other, intending to share both.  The waitress offered to have the kitchen divide it for us, and when the plates came out, it was if we weren't sharing at all - we each had so much rice (perfectly cooked) and salad (fresh and full of a variety of stuff), together with a substantial portion of the lamb, that we each took home enough for a second full meal.

The other friend is Israeli, and this is her comfort food.  She had a hankering for Liver and Onions.  If she hadn't been with us, it would have been another 5-star rating.  But her liver was way overcooked, and she didn't like it.  She did, however, love the hummus, which we ordered as a single side dish but had it as an appetizer.  It was a huge portion for $4.50.  (It costs more when ordered alone, but who'd go there and just order hummus?).

I have to agree with XX, when he/she said: "" You walk in and can't tell whether or not they're open...""  We went fairly late, and were sure it was closed -- until we walked in.  I don't see it as a bad omen, though, just that the owner needs a neon ""OPEN"" sign.  This is Vegas, ferchrissake, there's sure no shortage of neon to be had!

I'll be going back to Kebob Palace, but I'll stick with the chicken or, especially, the lamb.  Kebob.  As in Kebob Palace.  And I sure won't be ordering the liver.  Not there - or anywhere.",m-BZLIIh5PCAKnzH0qj_0Q,0,0,4,8DKlyC6ysP60rAexOST7GA

Had the qabili and yogurt with mint. Qabili was very nice though not much lamb in it. Was served with a beef and split pea stew which was warm not hot and a small bowl of cucumber and tomato salad. Yogurt and mint dip was rather thin.
Service slow as always despite small number of customers.
Good value though at $18 or so",GFkDRbR4n-TstOIuFn25Og,2,0,3,tYcNcHBxjc9IQYtdAPwa2Q
