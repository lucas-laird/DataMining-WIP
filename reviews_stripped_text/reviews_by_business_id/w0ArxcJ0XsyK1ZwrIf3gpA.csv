The expieriance was unpleasantly forgetable, first of all he ignored us for at least 15 minutes before finally offering us a drink. The bar was not that busy  and once he did come around we were  200 dollars down gambling without a drink because he was too busy flirting with another female customer.He slammed our drinks down on the bar as if we were bothering him.and it was the wrong order,He slammed down on the bar and it was not what we ordered.. We just  chose to drink it instead waiting another 20 minutes.  Few minutes later I visited the restroom only to come back and find Jake drooling on my wife making rude sexual gestures. This guy is the worst bartender I have ever encountered and I will never return to this bar. My wife and I are big players and we were looking for a new place to play  my wife was so offended he made her skin crawl and we will never return to this establishment again. I will tell all my friends never to go there because of this particular bartender Jake. Otherwise I thought it was a nice new place but he just ruined it I do not see how anyone would hire this a-hole . the owner of this establishment must be blind to keep this particular person working behind his bar representing his establishment. Word of mouth is the best form of advertisement that you can't buy and I will inform all my friends and family never to go to four sevensSports Bar and Grill ever. This May be a very nice place but because of JAKE I'm sure this place will lose a lot of business just as you loss possible great customers.   I wish the owners luck with the worst bartender I've ever experienced but he must be f****** blind not to see the rudeness to his customers and the offensive behavior towards women and I'm sure it was not only towards my wife. Good luck when filing bankruptcy .    Sign great gamers never to come back. I hope Jake is only in training and not a permanent employee if that is the case you shouldn't really get rid of him and I may consider returning.",wNzx10pGxyOgV3aTEtbT4g,1,0,1,6Ovhtytu-tzpSphieENNTg

551555,2014-03-11,0,w0ArxcJ0XsyK1ZwrIf3gpA,"At first glance this place seems like an awesome sports bar. Unfortunately it is not. They have pool tables, dartboards, foosball, shuffleboard, alcohol, four poker tables and I did not think it was possible to screw up all that cool, but they pull it off every week. I've been here twice, both times the same crappy service from the old ornery man behind the bar. At first the place was almost empty minus a few locals. We asked to hear the basketball game that was on one of the TVs in hopes he'd put it over the bar speakers. Instead, the bartender Jake grumbled something and turned the volume on the TV up very very little while letting the 50s music this place always has on play well over it. Our party of three made uphalf the patrons in the place at the time and it never once seemed like the bartender wanted to serve us or was even happy to be alive. Even between songs with the bar dead silent we still couldn't hear a word from the announcers on the TV. The half-dozen TVs had me thinking one way, but I guess this isn't a sports bar. The one waitress I've seen there is OK at her job, but same as the bartender never happy to be at work and brings nothing to the place. I overheard the owner of this place is a millionaire and that dumbfounds me. I assume he made his money somewhere else and a bar must be a safe investment because he sure didn't put much effort into this establishment. This is Las freaking Vegas, how hard is it to find a pretty face with a god damn smile on it that wants to pour my beer? You don't play the music you want to hear either, you ask who's in the bar or at least pay attention to your clientele and put on something appropriate, not 50s music non-stop. I asked to order food, was handed a menu, and both staff members vanished for 20 minutes not to be seen behind the bar again. I walked out and went to Del Taco.

608237,2013-11-03,0,w0ArxcJ0XsyK1ZwrIf3gpA,"We don't drink really and hate smoky bars. The Bar may be great but the restaurant if that's what you want to call it lacks anything resembling service . The prices are reasonable for Bar-type food but the Chinese is only moderately priced if the portions are large. Service is a joke, probably the worst I have experienced in years. Service is by a cocktail waitress whose primary duties apparently are to the bar patrons as she only comes into the restaurant side ever 20 minutes or so. After we seat ourselves, we wait at least 10 minutes for her to take our drink order. 15 or 20 minutes later she returns to take our dinner order-nothing out of the ordinary-a hamburger and a ribeye steak. 40 minutes later, no food, although she did check in on us one time to explain that the reason the kitchen was so slow was that everybody in the bar was eating! By the way, there was just one other diner eating on the restaurant side. 15 minutes later she returned to say it would just be another 5 minutes. 15 minutes later our order arrived. The presentation was quite nice but the steak was almost room temperature. The burger was OK. It turns out the order was brought to the table by the cook who apparently didn't think we should have to wait for the cocktail waitress. After a leisurely dinner, the waitress returned to see if we wanted anything else, to which we replied just a take-out box (so that we could take the steak home and heat it). She did bring it right away and you would think that would signal that we were ready for the check. She never showed. We calculated the tab and left cash plus a more than generous tip.

863267,2016-05-25,1,w0ArxcJ0XsyK1ZwrIf3gpA,"The 5 star reviews for this place have got to be fake. There is no way this is a 5 star establishment. I would give them 1.5 but not 2 - hence the actual 1 star rating. It reminds me of the ""before"" bars on Bar Rescue - a tv show that fixes horrible bars.
Starting with the only positive - a pitcher of draft beer was only $7. However, I watched the bartender gal draw it and it started out as mostly foam. She ended up pouring at least half of it out to actually get to the beer and make it a decent pitcher. This in itself says a lot about the bar maintenance and the beer delivery system. Could be dirty supply lines, could be long lines that allow the beer to get warm before it hits the spout, could be leaks allowing air in. Regardless of the reason, it screams of neglect. I would guess not profitable too.
I didn't eat, but the food I saw looked less than average. I don't think I would ever eat there just based on looks. I bet the kitchen is scary...
Decor was tacky and kinda dirty. When there are beer advertising banners hanging everywhere, it is an immediate red flag for me. Let me repeat, RED FLAGS EVERYWHERE.
I went to see a friend play a showcase set on the 7777 Tuesday night Reno's Jam Night. While they did an ok set, the sound was horrendously bad. They finished their set and then the ""jam night"" started. I didn't think it was possible but the sound got worse. The musicians had no concept of playing for the audience. It very much seemed they were playing to feed their egos and not to entertain an audience. It was poorly organized and poorly executed. I left after two songs - with about 20 minutes of dead air in between the 2 songs I heard. It was truly awful - no better than a below average garage band in a below average garage. 
All in all, it was just not comfortable or enjoyable. It was just a mess, a wreck, and a disaster! Had it not been for the fact that I went to support my friend's band, I would have turned around and walked out immediately. I certainly won't be back.",z21uBsK7layUkXZsHWF4rQ,5,1,1,Rtb8b8nNToCXOdRc7ThDzg

Last time we had an amazing middle aged woman working the bar. She was beyond friendly and when we wanted to order from the Chinese menu 5 minutes before they stop that service she ran into the back to ask him if he would squeeze in a couple of orders...which he was glad to do.

The second time I went in I didn't eat just had drinks with a friend.
The bartender seemed to take issue with anything we ordered. As if we were insulting him by even ordering drinks...even though there was only one other guest in the entire bar. I decided maybe I was just imagining this hostile undertone until it got close to 10 pm and his relief showed up.
As soon as the next bartender hit the door he looks at us and says ""Hey I gotta cash you out.""
No big deal. I've worked service for over 10 years. I understand.
So I simply ask him ""Do you need to run my card now?"" 
My purpose for asking was to see if he had the card on tab already or if he needed it back, or if he just wanted my permission.
His reply was: ""I'd rather you give me cash...don't you have cash?""
Working in service all of my adult life there are very few things you can do that will cause me to stiff you. But this guy came close.

The next time we go is basically my last night out in Vegas before I moved. I'm trying to have a small celebration with some friends.
Same guy.
Getting drinks was like pulling teeth
My friend asked about the types of dressing options for her salad, and his answer was: ""ranch...and some other stuff....why? what ELSE do you want.?""

Here's the bottom line...this place is awesome...as long as the one bartender is not working. If i'm ever back in town I'll probably swing in and have a drink...unless he's working...in which case I'll just drop off an application to Dick's last resort for him. He'd do well there.",2DECrukmumziXTBI20idTA,6,0,3,ltbNC7rqk_ywmMaocuqYqQ

Good location to begin with, easy to get in and out of the parking lot. I read that they have pool tables. That's a plus for me. A lot of so called 'sports bars' don't offer the beckoning appeal of soft green, or in this case, red felt of a good pool table AND pool cues that aren't as crooked as a dog's hind leg. $1 a game and $6 pitchers of draft (American) beer, and these are good size pitchers too.

The restaurant was closed for some reason, I didn't ask why but there was a sign posted. I didn't come here to eat but was a little strange why closed on a Saturday night.
They had a 3 piece band playing in the back room, just back enough as to be more background music...the karaoke started around 9 and that was fun. Some dude there was a ringer for Barry White.

Jake the bartender was very cool, he said he was the only one working and was pretty busy but when a bartender pours a fresh pitcher for you without being asked, that's a guy on the ball!

Too make a long story short he said no rap in my bar (we have been playing it all season) and when asked about Beyonce he flipped out on a paying customer and said keep drinking you'll die sooner. And then kicked him out and physically pushed the costumer. The owner is creepy and seems drunk all the time.

My husband and I wandered in at 930 the other night, out of the rain looking for Chinese food. After ordering a drink we find out the Chinese food is not offered after 9. In light of that, we kind of made a mutual (all be it non-verbal, kind of happily married for a long time Jedi type mind message, that nobody else can see) decision to finish the drink & head out. 
This is where it becomes exciting. At this point Jake, the bartender, apologizes like crazy. He offers us a happy hour/ football menu, which is a far cry from the extensive Chinese menu we were after. We glance over it, as a courtesy. Sticking to our original decision, (-now actually spoken, to save our Jedi powers.). We make designs to settle up & head back into the rain. When out of nowhere, the chef/cook (not sure of his title) Mike comes from the kitchen to talk to us & offer us amazing non-football food options. 
Between the bartender, Jake (works swing nearly every night) and the cook, Mike, and their collective efforts, we decided to stay. My husband got the chicken tacos and I got a fabulous Caesar salad. That and a couple more drinks and we had forgotten the missed Chinese we had come in for. 
On our way out we ran into the owner of the place, Ron. When we explained how nice his staff had been to us, especially under the circumstances, he seemed genuinely pleased & proud to hear they had been the sole reason we had stayed to eat, gamble & drink. 
This is a must stop, if you haven't already. These guys will restore your faith in the lost art f customer service.

At first, as a good liberal arts-educated citizen, my reaction was to be offended, but when I looked at my Taiwanese husband he just laughed. So, for this unexpected combination alone, they earn my early respect. And, yes, we did see the Chinese chef exit the kitchen at one point. 

The story is that the bar owner's girlfriend is Chinese, so she oversees the Chinese cuisine. The menu is legit featuring everything from hot pot to Chinese meatball. When we visited, we weren't starving, but we decided to order some pork and cabbage dumplings, and they had the appearance of being homemade: a little imperfectly shaped and filled with fresh pork. They were worth ordering again, but we would probably get them pan fried next time. 

The menu also features standard American grub alongside pizza that looked pretty good. It appeared that they had CSN students cooking in the kitchen. 

The other thing I like about this video poker spot is that there are lots of windows, so it is fairly bright. It isn't your typical cavernous Vegas bar. They have plenty of TVs for sports viewing complete with all the requisite sports ""passes,"" so they will have every NFL game, NBA game and the like. 

The spirit selection is decent, as is the beer selection. They have two Tenaya Creek brews on tap. They also have something happening almost every night from karaoke to comedy, and they have a pool table, foosball, electronic darts and Golden Tee. 

It's a good neighborhood spot, and the dumplings have definitely left me wanting to go back to try a few more of their Chinese dishes.",qewG3X2O4X6JKskxyyqFwQ,26,15,4,YsyQ_dmZJrYDHlmW5wF2mQ

Seems like it's perfectly set up to be the hangout spot.  Add the Chinese menu twist to that and you also have something pretty unique.  But I'm just not feeling it...

The good things:  The aforementioned games & TV screens; sports paraphernalia on the walls; decent wings and pizza; decent prices on beer.

The iffy things:  I felt like I was at one of those Lions Club cafeteria.  Not sure what it was, just the overall setting and atmosphere.; the service was good, but not overly pleasant nor efficient.  Food was okay, some things being good (fries), others just decent.

The not-so-good things:  Nothing here is bad, but a couple of minor complaints.  The wings were tiny - were they from undergrown baby chickens?  Tasted good though, not overly dry;  the bill came to $35/p, which we didn't think was a bargain based on what we had.

So I guess it will really depend on how comfortable you feel here, but for my money spent I think we could have asked for more.  I just didn't feel it was a $35/p type of a place or experience.

Table-for-1 Factor:  Perfect for that, they have a good-sized bar and atmosphere fits the bill just right.",52Oq0fCJWaHpQtuKqTkN4g,8,2,3,iO3WxA_nRP0BystKQk8PPQ
