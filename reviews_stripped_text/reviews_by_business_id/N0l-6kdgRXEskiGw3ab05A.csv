Took away one star for the size of the restaurant and the cigerette smoke odor coming from the casino.   Great burger at a decent price.,1e8BEktGPUGcFw1CCpBWqw,2,2,4,sXPJGt7WzfqiSwa2uJVVEA

The manager then came back and said now the 'Owner' said they would absolutely not accept it and that they weren't participating in the Groupon (they changed their story). 
The groupon clearly said the Silverton location. They had their location taken off the Groupon site but non the less the way they handled it was very poor. They lost a customer.
In this case it was just plain horrible management. They did a VERY poor job in handling this. We purchased a groupon in good faith, we went to the location that was specifically on the groupon, and the owner was a jerk about it as if we did something wrong.",L8mt1u1DoxH1oA-IQhawbA,1,0,1,jC0w2n8fk8hxd_QautVyIw

971192,2010-12-28,1,N0l-6kdgRXEskiGw3ab05A,"Scenario: Christmas Eve. Me and the hubster are bored, it's just the two of us this year, no crazy family (yay!). We need to kill some time. 

We decide on Silverton. It's close and we love to browse around Bass Pro Shops. But we are hungry, it's lunch time. LIGHT BULB! There's a coupon in my 2011 Entertainment Book for Johnny Rockets in the Silverton. Perfect, it has been decided. 

The restaurant is in the newly renovated/added area and it's pretty small. There is a counter with maybe 8 seats, a few booths that seat 4 comfortably, and about 10 tables (a variety of 2 and 4 seaters). The 10 tables kind of hang into the casino area, and there wasn't a clear place to go to notify someone you were waiting for a table. We just kind of hung around waiting for one to open up. Luckily that wait wasn't long. 

Our coupon was buy-one-get one, up to a $7 value so we kept that in mind while ordering. I had the combo with Fries and a Bacon Cheeseburger. Husband had The Original combo with Onion Rings instead of Fries. Each came out to $7. So with tax, tip and drink we came out of pocket $14. I think the prices are kind of high, but we are in a casino/hotel so that might be one reason why.

The food came out pretty quickly and the server was OK, not amazing, but OK. My burger was very good! Lots of flavor, loved the pickle relish, special sauced rocked and the burger was moist and juicy. The fries were just, eh. Kind of under cooked in my opinion. I like 'em crunchy! Husband enjoyed his burger too, but agreed that the onion rings were just, eh. My only other issue was that the burger might have been just a little too juicy. I know, right! But the bun was kind of soggy at the end :( So maybe the burger wasn't too juicy, but the bun was to WEAK! LOL. 

I'm sure we will come back. I have another coupon and I was very happy overall with the experience. Next time milkshakes are a MUST!",m2gyh-W4wdVEAPmp6pkV0A,2,0,3,9SPKYKfgyhDm11fRkUPONw

I always vary my order! Truthfully, my fav is the #12, it has a nice kick! sometimes,
I ask them to add bacon and burn my meat... and they get it right everytime.

stopping by for a lil bite (no burger)
the place is open late, which is cool! I really really like the 50's atmosphere!
someday i hope they can get those retro-counter jukeboxes to work. lol

1398916,2013-09-04,0,N0l-6kdgRXEskiGw3ab05A,"Johnny Rockets inside the Silverton is a good option for a quick and inexpensive bite to eat. I like that they stay open later than the other dining options with the exception of the 24/7 Sundance Grill, but there have been instances where I've come by before closing to find them closed, even having asked a few hours prior when they close. I like to eat late, and I'll set my alarm on my phone to be sure to show up 15 minutes before closing, and it stinks when told ""sorry, it just wasn't that busy so we closed early"", which means off to the coffee shop I go, or I have to quickly drive somewhere close by that's also closing soon. Keep in mind I'm usually staying at the Silverton, on vacation, and by 11PM, I've tied one on, so hopping in the car isn't so,etching I can do, and a $10 cab ride to the In and Out a mile away is wasted $$$. 

The food here is okay. The burger isn't anything special and neither are the fries. Just average fast food that's not cooked until you've ordered it, thus guaranteeing it'll be hot. Where Johnny Rocket's does shine is in the milkshake department, and since it's often very late when I'm ready for a snack, a milkshake is a great treat. I haven't explored the fancy shakes as a vanilla malted is a classic shake in my mind, but there are numerous options which look very appealing. 

I wouldn't bother going out of my way to eat here; I guess I actually try to plan my evening so I'm not stuck eating here, but in a pinch it'll do. The shakes, however, are worth it if you are in the mood for a guilty pleasure. Service is perfectly fine, just be sure to check in if you are planning on pushing your visit to right before closing time.",RTtdsBlyFcpeKI8MMD-A3Q,1,1,3,Rg72-MeCIw2QHnxfLyVkFw

Like $10 A BURGER high. I know that doesn't sound like a lot but because they weren't $10 good is why I'm saying that. Now granted we didn't get a burger but instead got the chicken club sand and the Philly cheese which sound and looked amazing but the actually outcome.....I think I had better at Denny's and theirs comes with fries and Denny's have bomb seasoned fries too. So I can't say if their burgers are worth it or not. So 2 so so sandwich and a side order of soggy fries and burger king tasting onion rings and a soda for $30 something bucks I will have to say I wished I'd spent that somewhere else. I'm not sure if it because it's in a Hotel Casino but even if it was I wouldn't have mind if it blew my mind.

2250546,2011-06-30,3,N0l-6kdgRXEskiGw3ab05A,"What finally got me into Johnny Rockets was reading that they served a good chocolate malt. In a milkshake kind of world, the promise of a proper malt gets me right off the Sofa of Exhaustion and into the car like a sheepdog who just heard someone say ""dog park.""

Besides, if we liked Johnny Rockets, we could use that as an excuse to someday try a Royal Caribbean cruise. (RCL features the chain on their ships. So far we've only cruised Carnival... but they only serve milkshakes, so this could be a personal tipping point. Page Malcolm Gladwell.)

The Johnny Rockets at the Silverton casino is right on the edge of the casino floor, tucked into a corner with slot machines close to the two open sides. On our visit we witnessed the sad spectacle of a kid sitting bored in a chair at the edge of the JR ""border,"" watching his dad play slots a few feet away. 

(Sad not only because of this kid's grim situation, which lasted our entire meal, but because he was taking up the clean table-for-two we coveted. Hey, I never said I'm not selfish, We ended up avoiding several dirty tables, all of which were still dirty when we left despite the growing number of customers in the small room, and making do with an awkward two-top in the short corner. This table was situated with the theory that it fit in the space, but only if no one actually sat there.)

Our server was polite but busy. We waited for water until just before our food came, but it was obvious that he was overstretched, not only waiting on tables but making the drinks as well.

The malts were nice enough. Not very ""malty,"" that Whoppers/Maltesers taste that sets the drink apart from a regular milkshake, but I'm easily pleased by any kind of chocolate drink. It was expensive compared to other fast food malts, though. I felt like we were paying more for the ""'50's Maltshop Experience Right Out of a Box"" brand than any real quality.

This couldn't be more true when it came to the burgers and fries. On the one hand, three-cheers for offering a vegetarian burger. On the other hand, it's a Boca burger. Blergh. With Boca, you either have to cook it with great care to get some flavour in there (didn't happen), or you have to hope for excellent toppings to mask the taste (didn't happen).

The food wasn't inedible, but it's the kind whose quality goes downhill quickly as it cools. The cheese congeals, you notice the fries are sort of mealy, and the burger tastes like one that cost much less.

Even now, as I look at the online menu, the idea of Johnny Rockets appeals. Burger, fries, and an excuse to grab a malt. Everything in the pictures looks both fun and good. (They pour your ketchup into happy faces!) The reality, though, is that this is just overpriced fast food with a strong theme. If this is authentic 1950s fare, please cancel my order for a time machine - we'll use those parts for a malt machine instead.",l9YOhaPYvTJi_qfD3Y-wBQ,4,4,2,m1CiA2bhu9WN-SZ9dnNprQ

Long story short, We were headed to Wuhu Noodle, to only find out that they were closed. Yelp says they were open until 12 and it was a little after 11p when we walked up to see that it was closed. 
After going back and forth on where to eat, we said, Efff it! let's go to Johnny Rockets as our ""meat cheat day.""

We grabbed a menu and sat down, as soon as we looked at the menu, my BF and I look at each other and was instantly excited that they had other meat options other than beef and chicken. You can now order any of their delicious burgers and swap out your meat of choice (Beef, Chicken, turkey, and they even have a black bean patty!!) I'm literally dying right now, lol.

Instead of my ""meat cheat day"" I ordered the Route 66 Burger with a turkey patty topped with swiss cheese, mushrooms, caramelized onions, mayo on their brioche bun. YUMMY! is all I can say. I tried just the turkey patty itself and it was well seasoned, juicy, yes, i said JUI-CY! and then the caramelized onions were cooked to perfection in my book and that definitely says something in my book because me and crunchy raw onions don't go. 

I also ordered tots (just plain) instead of the usual fries and a peanut butter banana shake. Tots were good, not greasy which I loved. They do have other tots that they have on their menu with cheese toppings and such. The Shakes are always soooo good! The peanut butter to banana ratio was perfect. I love how they give you the remaining shake that didn't fit into the glass. Makes me feel like I get my money worth.

Customer service was on par, and the gentleman that served us was awesome! Food came out quick and hot!!!

I got chicken fingers and fries which I expected to be very greasy due to the smell of burning oil in the air however they were not.  Worth stopping by if you're in the mood for something quick while at the Silverton.,lLS3A-62z7oJGj1KSso53g,1,0,4,u2FXS6E5MfxfF9XejRItYA

Literally, 3 servers walked right past us as if we weren't even there. The manager and a server stood by the cash register (which is probably 5 feet from where we were sitting) and talked to each other the whole time. Needless to say, we got up and walked out.

Do yourself a favor and go eat at the Sundance Grill in the same casino. The burgers there are awesome and you'll probably get served in this lifetime.",dLBdb-efIEkfaftYinQryw,1,0,1,cVQYIXDRAhJLqbAkK7ynZA

I ordered onion rings and a grilled cheese. I asked for it not to be slathered in butter, and they were ok with that, but it wasn't grilled the way I like it. It needs to be dark and toasty and with a crispness to it. It did not have any of those. The onion rings were ok, I did add a few on my sandwich and that was ok as well. My cousin ordered the wings and they barely had any meat on them. I'm not joking. They use the tiniest wings I've ever seen.

For the quality of the food, it's pricey. If the food were better, it wouldn't seem so bad. 2 waters, a grilled cheese with .99 add on for onion rings and 8 tiny chicken wings, over $18 seems like a lot to me! Service was just ok.

The red stools that spin at the front counter, the small old school music boxes, all the art hanging on the walls, and obviously not to mention the great food. 

At this particular location the service we received was really good. We ordered strawberry shakes and 5 minutes we were sipping on them. Even though there were several customers we had our food within 10 minutes which was really good considering how many customers they had. 

I ordered the Totnachos which were really good and filling. My son ordered the bacon cheese fries which was a very healthy serving. We also had a strawberry shake each.
