I love that Zaba's has a choice of wheat tortillas and brown rice. Last time I went to Chipotle (which was awhile ago), I don't think they had brown rice. I also like that Zaba's will add fajita veggies to your bowl at no extra charge. I'm also all about supporting local eateries vs. the chain ones.

I agree with the others that parking kind of sucks there. It doesn't even connect to the shopping center with Marshall's and Target. You have to go around to the other entrances. 

I normally get the chicken, steak or shrimp bowls. All cooked wonderfully and seasoned well. I recently been trying the tacos which are fat tacos with the filling always falling out cause there is so much.",DGDlpOVeUNEkBDYkJLvdBQ,0,0,5,49MesjIh-fP5YO6r7qvJGQ

Moving on, I'm a big fan of Zabas, and I eat here often- at one point my husband didn't even have to tell them the order, they would just know when they saw him. I usually get the shredded beef tacos or burritos, though the taquitos they've recently added to the menu are really good as well. 

The staff has always been really friendly, and the cost is reasonable for what you get. Highly recommended.",EsOq_EegwysF9b0iiFd9aw,0,0,5,HzeKdeJm42M1iLi_tREvPA
410515,2009-08-01,0,tNky09c0HBYiHxizht0gCQ,"I love zabas, its one of the few places I can eat repeatedly.

The chicken has this wonderful seasoning, its subtle at first, but the more you eat, the better it is.  

I find the steak here to be a bit bland at times, so I save that for when I'm just looking for a little bite.

They added shrimp a few months ago, omg, I don't even like seafood, shrimp, anything like that, but shrimp tacos here? Wonderful.  A very nice alternative to the beef or chicken I normally eat.

I like to make my own combos, so here are some of my favorites.

For breakfast I like a breakfast burrito on a wheat tortilla made with chorizo, real eggs, potatos, a teensy bit of pinto beans, and a lot of cheese.

For lunch I tend to get flour tacos with chicken, a little bit of pinto beans, cheese, and cholula.  

If I'm in a ""different"" mood, I might get a steak chesadilla, drip some cholula on it along a little bit of pinto beans on the side.  Its awesome.

Many of my coworkers, like another commenter, love the fish tacos, personally I'm a bit afraid of sea food, but one day I'll take the plunge (maybe). o_0

Everything here is made fresh, the chips, the guac (the fresh guac is awesome, unfortunately being allergic to onions, I have to avoid it except in small amounts), the salsas, the chicken, the beef.  Nothing comes out of a bag premade except for the tortillas!  

Wow, wish I could get over there in time, I'd have some tonight. ^_^

Oh, and for iced tea lovers, they use fresh brewed shrangri-la brand iced tea, which personally I find to be nonbitter and I drink without any sort of sweetener.",02sxoqCJ_1lbk_t2GCLxQQ,1,0,5,5Y8Mrul5PVSWJirHRiQsyQ

When I asked for an extra scoop of beans because I asked for no rice the worker was so rude I could not believe it. I had to ask 3 times and I was asking extra nice just so she would finish making it nicely. I actually got 4 salads total with nothing special or extra but asked for the dressing and sour cream on the side bc I was taking them to go. So the worker girl tells the girl at the register to give me the to go sides in Spanish. I didn't think anything of it until after I paid filled up my drink and then  went to put some napkins in my bag. I noticed all she put in was two sour cream sides and one chipotle ranch. So I went back up to ask for more and she was extremely rude. Took out two containers and barely put any ranch in either of them and pushed them over to me like I did something wrong. Wow Im sorry I'f your having a bad day but why are you taking it out on me? I have never known them to be so rude or Stingy before.

I used to come here after classes at UNLV and grab lunch before heading home to study. Now that I'm living in the Mountain's Edge area I don't get here as often as I would like. Typically I stop in when I'm at Aaron Brothers or Nordstrom Rack. It's a little treat in the middle of my shopping Saturdays. 

Their style is much like that of Chipotle, but I like that it is locally owned and operated, and not a national chain. They have obviously mimicked a style of Chipotle, but hey, it works so no complaining here. The restaurant is always clean, with plenty of seating.

I like to order the Grilled Chicken Salad or the Grilled Chicken Zaba Bowl. Their salsa and fixins have great flavor and are made with fresh ingredients. The guacamole is great and I love that hey have Cholula! Much better than Tapatio :)

Thank you Zabas for healthy Tex-Mex style food! Yummers!

On 5-23-2013 I ate here with my son once again after approximately a year. They were short staffed, the poor guy who seemed like he was a supervisor was very nice, appologetic and worked as quickly as possible, great job there. Now for the food: WHAT A RIP OFF, they put about a tablespoon worth of chicken in my burrito. I said, ""Could you spare it?' Sarcastically of course, he relented and gave me a little more. I have been in the restaurant business for many years, yes, he is entitled to a profit, however, the cost to put a generous or fair amount of chicken in the burrito is minimal. At $7 a burrito he is making a huge profit with those portions. I don't think I will go back now, I have given them enough chances. For the rest of you suckers, pay attention to what they are doing. The only reason that I gave them two stars is because they do have good tasting food. After reading some,  other reviews I wanted to add to it. In one review it was mentioned at how much he was charged for a side of sour cream, once again, they are entitled to a profit, and like myself when they first opened, I used to eat there 2 to 3 times a week and then they nickle and dime you.

I've been to this location, and a few others around town many times.  The food is constantly fresh and affordable.

4540465,2013-07-21,1,tNky09c0HBYiHxizht0gCQ,"I am going to give this place only 3 stars.  The reason is I went in today and ordered a Vegetarian bowl and the people behind the counter had NO IDEA what that meant.  They did not know that it included guacamole and tried to charge me for it.  Even though they have fajita vegetables, (bell peppers & onions), apparently this is NOT included in the Vegetarian Bowl at this place and they want to charge extra.  

So, I guess a Vegetarian bowl in their eyes is the same as any other item but without meat.  The menu even specifies guacamole is included but they are clueless.  If the vegetarian items do not include any and all vegetables they have available, I DO NOT see the point in visiting this place again.  There are a lot of competitors who will give you what you desire without question.

Hopefully someone in management will read this and respond, otherwise I DO NOT RECOMMEND this place for Vegetarians.",kzRq4H_nSf4b3F_sdymWSw,3,1,3,4LjZC0FGdaJWWHTihSVIpA
4687678,2012-08-09,1,tNky09c0HBYiHxizht0gCQ,"First impressions are not always great ones. Zabas has left me shrugging my shoulders and thinking ""I just don't get it"". You walk in and it looks like they copied Chipotle decor and layout wise. What they didn't copy Chipotle on is offering diced potatoes, whole wheat tortillas, and did I see sweet potatoes? 

My burrito was made fast, but they were out of chips so no chips and guac for me. They have a weird placement for their fountain drinks and it's kind of awkward to get enough napkins that is if the multiple dispensers are even stocked which they weren't. 

So I grab a seat and start in on their massive burrito. And while it was good, it wasn't great. Even going back and getting their hot salsa to pour on it didn't help. And the chicken is just blah. Compare it to Chipotle where they add some minor spices to it and I found myself wishing it had a little bit more seasoning. 

Overall it wasn't bad, but it wasn't anything that had me jumping up and down for joy thinking I found a local alternative to Chipotle either. 3 Stars...ho-hum, I may go back and try it again or I may not. It's nothing I would make a special trip for...I've drove 110 miles one way for Chipotle more than once.

Since going to college, whenever I'm back home, I always want Zaba's at one point during my stay.

Similar to Chipotle in its menu and cafeteria-style set up, but light years better in taste, quality, and selection. Zaba's offers so many options for the health-conscious: brown rice, wheat tortillas, sweet potatoes, fajita vegetables, and a killer (as well as super fresh) green salsa. Their menu spans from the typical (carnitas, carne asada, and chicken) to the alternative (shrimp, fish, and vegetarian options). 

Yeah, I may have a Chipotle in Seattle. I'd rather just wait to come home and eat Zaba's.",rzatTfGhdFwgyfAP9yhPLg,0,0,4,nEUwzhKI2Qh9TAGjO0AOQg

The menu is much larger than Chipotle's and has some yummy things I haven't seen other places. I'm a sucker for their pesto sauce - it's incredible. They also offer sweet potatos and regular potatos for your bowls or burritos. Their queso is pretty awesome too, we always have to get a side of it! Prices are on the high side, but the quality is great. When I'm low carbing I get a bowl with a smidgen of black beans, white meat chicken, lettuce, tomatoes, sour cream, cheese, and pesto sauce and I'm a happy camper indeed!",kmE8w5Y785eZmodsx0V6Ag,3,1,4,S8d-UUdvPLEkspvRVQhXyQ

Eastern Ave is an easy off the highway stop before getting into the mess of the strip.
I saw Zaba's is a local Chipotle style chain so we stopped here.
Were there not so many restaurants like this by now I would likely give 4 stars but most places are just better than Zaba's
Sure, they  have two kinds of potatoes you can add to your bowl/burrito/taco/salad but the rest is standard and nothing really stood out in taste.
Take that back, the Cilantro Pesto I put on my salad was AMAZING!!!
The rest, boring.
Nothing was really warm, I like my food piping hot.
I had the salad with everything except for meat, it was fine, all due to the pesto.
The man had the burrito, didn't say much, I'm assuming fine, not stellar.
My son had the kids quesadilla with potatoes, super cheap at $2.99.
Service a bit lacking as no one really understood much english, but the place was clean and spacious.
$17 for lunch for 3 is great, but I don't think I would bother to come back, there is too much good food in the area.",nmdkHL2JKFx55T3nq5VziA,3,4,3,jPygn5qh79gS-41oAZiFiQ

5575747,2008-03-24,0,tNky09c0HBYiHxizht0gCQ,"This place reminded me of another Chipotle. My friend and I ordered their fish tacos. They were supposed to be the best there. We didn't get their Chipotle Ranch dressing though. The tacos were ok, with their corn exterior and cabbage/lettuce interior.Btw, the fish takes 3 minutes to cook. Everything seems to be made fresh to order. Most of the workers there didn't speak English, so another worker had to repeat and translate our preferences for the filling several times. Overall, the tacos were good. You could make them with any of their four salsas: mild (pico de gallo), medium (fresh corn salsa, green tomatillo salsa), and hot (roasted tomato & red chile). There are also other items like balsamic vinagrette, chipotle ranch, and homemade guacamole. Everything is supposedly fresh! They all looked pretty fresh and tasted fresh, so I believe it! 

The food is a bit pricey for what you get. The fish tacos (3) already cost about $8 with tax! Geez! I could have gotten more authentic, tastier, bigger tacos at Fausto's!

We actually arrived about 5 minutes until closing, and they were able to accomodate us. What service! We felt bad, so we left in 10 after receiving our order. That's why I'm giving them 4 stars!",Tk_FWXueutKii3f9yJFsdw,2,0,4,8qgw5rgBBsB4_z31wVZnFQ
