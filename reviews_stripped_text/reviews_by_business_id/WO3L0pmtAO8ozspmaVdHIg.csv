Tucked inside the Fremont hotel in downtown Vegas, this little hole-in-the-whole, fast food, Panda-Express-like place fitted in perfectly with the rest of the downtown scene. No glitz, no frills, just an authentic, real, and delicious experience. Plastic utensils, wooden throw-away chopsticks, seating that would put Subway to shame...The staff was incredibly friendly, joked with us, and teased us as we asked them about the oxtail soup. 

Yes, that's right. Oxtail soup. 

We came here specifically to find this delicacy, and were not disappointed in the least. Tender, tasty, hunky meat that falls off the bone with the touch of a spoon. Topped with a good handful (or two if you're nice) of shiitake mushrooms and fresh-cut cilantro, this amazing meal befriends your wallet at a mere $7.95 (with or without white rice)!

1460930,2016-05-13,6,WO3L0pmtAO8ozspmaVdHIg,"This place is a small food court inside Fremont Hotel and Casino. I was too exhausted to walk to California Hotel for their popular oxtail soup as part of their graveyard special. I've landed here instead since it's been a few years I've had their oxtail soup.

I received my order almost instantly since there was no line going into midnight. The soup was served in a medium sized disposable bowl with a scoop of rice on the side. I was impressed that there were ample portion of oxtail meat (big and small) with lots of cilantro and portobello mushrooms.

The meat was surprisingly very tender but were not falling of the bones which I like. The broth was really good and not too greasy or salty, but having lots of portobello mushrooms does change the flavor of the oxtail soup due to the woodsy flavor from the mushrooms.  

The only downfall with this meal to me, the bowl  was not the right size  to enjoy this meal. I had to put some of the meat to the side to give more room for my spoon to move around. The soup was warm and not hot and that shouldn't matter what time of day someone would be dining in. This soup can use more broth and that would be greatly appreciated. 

Yes, I still prefer the oxtail soup at the Market Street Cafe inside California Hotel, but this does the job as an alternative. If they just pay attention to the small details, this would be a delicious soup to savor and I may go out of my way to dine in frequently when I find myself at Fremont Street Experience with all the interesting crowd around.",pm7K54T6OmsDHREtiVBWGQ,9,9,4,T6w1Le4dxs7YR_e91-ZFiA

There was a bit of a line, probably because they were the only fast food at that time of night, and there was a guy begging for food.

During late night, they do not serve Chinese food. You can still get the hot dog, shrimp cocktails, musabi, and a few other items. There is also a breakfast menu. The steak and eggs was pretty cheap, but it seemed like everyone was ordering that and since the steaks are cooked to order, there was a bit of a wait. We decided to get the breakfast plates instead. It consisted of 2 eggs, biscuit or bread, hashbrowns, and sausage or bacon. We went with the scrambled eggs since they had a big tray of those so we wouldn't have to wait for eggs.

What drew my attention to this place was that they Portuguese sausage eggs and rice, very popular combo for a local Hawaiian from the islands.

The staff is friendly and the portions are more than enough! I've actually heard customers in the nearby seating area mention the same thing.

From biscuits and gravy, corned beef and hash, French toast, country style potatoes with red and green peppers, there's something here for everyone.

I stick with what I like the best from this place and that is the Portuguese sausage and eggs.

The above mentioned are from the food line, there is an overhead menu if you'd like to order a la cart.

This also another place to get some really good oxtail soup!

I mentioned this place closes for breakfast at 7am, then it re-opens and turns into a Chinese food place.

I've not had their Chinese food but I wanted to give it a mention.

I have given this place only 4 stars because I've tried the other breakfast offerings and I honestly didn't enjoy it. I believe it's because much of the food had been sitting in the heated food line and loses its flavor appeal. 

But, If you're creeping back to hotel in the wee hours of the morning on Fremont, you know you can stop by this casino and grab you some breakfast.

the three of us didn't quite know what to eat since almost every restaurant on Fremont Street was either packed to the walls or there was a long wait to get a table. On the suggestion of Minh's finding, we decided to try this joint out. Walking through Fremont Hotel, you really get to see just what kind of people downtown Vegas attracts after midnight (bleh). We arrived at our dinner destination. A) It was not to busy. B) there were a lot of seniors, local folks and some sketchy people either in line to order or already seated and enjoying a hearty meal of congealed slop. 

We looked over the menu and then at the hot plates of hopefully editable food. Prices are definitely budget friendly. After saying a quick prayer to the food gods, we grabbed a table then got in line to place our order!

The lady behind the counter reminded me of an ex cafeteria worker as it was her business to get the order and slop whatever it was onto a plate then send you on your way to the cashier!

Taking my chances, I ordered Orange Chicken and some Eggrolls. She handed me my plate and said you can pay at the register. 

The orange chicken had a funny taste (as it was old or reheated) the sauce was super thick and sticky. I still ate it and was sort full after six big pieces. Now the eggrolls looked pretty inviting but sadly, they fell short of taste. To me the roll tasted like an old shoe mixed with off brand spices. People of yelp, whatever you do... do not get the sauce!

4750685,2016-05-18,2,WO3L0pmtAO8ozspmaVdHIg,"My friend drove all the way here from LA to get oxtail at California Hotel's cafe. Having had it 4 nights earlier I really wasn't looking forward to it. But we went and ate. It was not that good. It wasn't salty enough as Saturday, and the carrots, etc., were not cooked long enough. Some of the oxtail were chewy as the meat did not fall off the bone. Not to mention, the fat was not trimmed at all. I stared into a bowl of heart attack. So, instead of ordering a second bowl we decided to go for stop #2...Fremont Casino.

My Hawaiian friend has been telling me about Fremonts competing oxtail for months but I've never dared diverge from the old reliable. It's been close to 10 years since I've eaten at the Fremont's Lanai Express cafe. If you want old Vegas, come here. You will reek of cigarettes like you were the poster child for chain smokers.

The oxtail was not too bad. It's served in a classy Korean ramen plasticky bowl and a separate bowl of rice. The rice is really sticky and clumped together. I didn't bother to try it. The oxtail is cooked with cilantro on top, and shitake mushrooms. Problem is that the mushrooms probably would have enhanced the flavor but it was cold and thrown on it as garnish more so than taste, or else they would have cooked it in the broth. I did get 2 Heinekens for $2 tip as there were slot machines right next to the long line. So, as my friend waited, I played $0.05 poker. I was confused by the screens of 3-6 row poker and how to hold cards. I pressed all over the screen but nothing happened (I assumed it was touch screen, yeah?) So, the beer came before I even lost a nickel. Yup, this college grad got out-smarted by the numerous seniors chained to the machines who figured out how to lose their social security checks while I sipped a beer and stared dumbfounded at the screen. (Just as well, I won't get a SS check when I retire anyway. No need for the early practice.)

Aside from a smallish bowl, plastic, and lacking the magic ingredient of ginger, the broth was tasty and the oxtails were generous. If you don't want to wait until 11pm, this is a viable alternative. It's not a restaurant environment like California so it's weird eating it amongst the hot dog eaters. Almost all of the the tables were sticky and had the previous occupants eating utensils. I was amazed at how many thoughtful people must have came before me who believed in recycling utensils for the next guy to sit down. Thoughtful. Not deserving of their thoughtfulness, we trudged to the Dunkin Donut side and planted our tookishes on there. I looked at other peoples food and it looks like they were pretty good and were large heaping portions. The foot long hot dogs used to be $1.50 for weiner and soda but it's now at $2.99 I think. The old $0.99 shrimp cocktail is still there, minus the celery that used to be underneath it looks like. It used to be served in a plastic wine glass and now it's served in a plain plastic urn looking contraption. Oh how the mighty have fallen, just kidding.

So all in all, it was not a horrible alternative. It was pretty good but it's just too smoky. Personally, I hate smoke and try to avoid them whenever possible. California has been remodeled to look like the Golden Nugget, and doubled their air intakes, but Fremont is still panning for gold in plaid shirts and long johns.",xRpAEg0M0azAPuKVg7WtgA,2,1,3,7Rna3vdrpeawyuxeCFv40Q

Well this time we made it a point to give it a try. Hubby and I both got one while lil guy was fixated on the foot long hot dog and the spam musubi.

The foot long hot dog was a great deal. For about $2.50 you get the dog plus a drink. The spam musubi was also pretty tasty although the nori was chewy because the lady warmed it up, but the flavor was good.

The shrimp cocktail had way too much sauce on it. The shrimp was so overpowered by the sauce I couldn't even taste the shrimp. There is some chopped up lettuce, onions, celery at the bottom to give it flavor, but again, TOO much sauce. If you plan to go, ask the woman NOT to add more sauce to the already sauced cocktail. Otherwise, your shrimps will be drowning and crying out for help. The other thing is, these shrimps are so damn small you can barely taste them. Go to Costco and get their shrimp cocktail for $10 and eat to your heart's content!

This place also serves saimin and oxtail soup for those of you craving Hawaiian fare.

The food is decent, prices are fairly cheap, and the spam musubi, well, go try it yourself!",FIk4lQQu1eTe2EpzQ4xhBA,1,1,3,5vOAaCBOdvAFeCOS2VW_wQ

5657893,2011-07-13,0,WO3L0pmtAO8ozspmaVdHIg,"Pretty cool little cheap place. For some reason every time we come here it's always way to packed to dine in. It might be because there are 3 other restaurants that share a dine in spot. It's darn hard to find a seat to eat at after ordering your food. Well almost every time we come to fremont street, we come to check this little joint out. They serve Hawaiian food here along with what my son always gets, the spam masubi. Every time I come here too I always order the same thing, 99cents shrimp cocktail.....yummmy. I also heard that their oxtail soup here is good to, but I've yet to try it.

Besides the fact that it's hard to find a seat to eat your food, and how long the line is every time we come here (and sometimes, just sometimes they run out of spam masubis) but other than that food is good here and I will continue to come here when we go to Fremont St.

5695154,2017-05-29,1,WO3L0pmtAO8ozspmaVdHIg,The Chinese food here is terrible. Ordered a chili dog this time. Just as bad. Bad chili dog?  Yes pretty disgusting.  On top of which it was barely warm. Towards the middle it was down right cold.   Who serves food like this????   Maybe they're trying to go out of business,69CCS-_2tXwOFAepksrXug,1,0,1,1TohMmijrqLfW8p7xwUMbA

5846946,2016-02-20,0,WO3L0pmtAO8ozspmaVdHIg,"Our family friend recommended eating the oxtail soup here. They claimed it was just as good as the California's Market Street Cafe. Me, being very defensive about my oxtail soup from the California as the best I've ate, was taken for lunch by my grama and uncle.

Anything free tastes great in my book! So, when my bowl of oxtail soup came I was excited. The first thing i noticed when I opened my bowl (it came in a container), was that there was a lot of shiitake mushrooms and a good amount of fresh cilantro. It smelt amazing too! Ok, at this point I was pretty impressed. I open my chopsticks and now I'm ready to dig in.....well, this is where my ""in awe"" kinds of stops. Now, I've already waited at a table for about 15 minutes for a line of about 7 people and I waited even longer for the food to reach my mouth! The oxtail was a bit hard to get off the bone (sad face). So I did as my uncle did, grabbed it by the tail, and man handled the meat off with my lipstick smeared mouth. It came off surprisingly easy which just made me mad that maybe the restaurant gods didn't want me to eat it. Oh well~ Now before I forget the soup was good, but if I had to nitpick  (which, yes I do) it tasted too much like shiitake mushroom water mixed with shoyu. It sorta tasted like salty mushroom water, but I still downed half my bowl. Like I said, free tastes good.

The only reason I am giving 3 is because of:
1) The wait. It seemed like the cashier (although she was great, patient, friendly, and kind) didn't really know what she was doing. Maybe she was new? 

2) Salty soup. Nuff said.

3) Seating. Not good for groups of 4 or more. Luckily, we only had 3 which was still a little hard to find seats as it is. It's like cafeteria style seating.

5953688,2017-05-31,17,WO3L0pmtAO8ozspmaVdHIg,"I never would have given this place a second thought but my mother and brother saw the $0.99 shrimp cocktail. So we had to go in. It's this weird little food court looking place inside the Freemont Hotel and Casino. 

Customer service was pretty decent. I had no complaints there. The woman working wasn't terribly social, but she wasn't the stereotypical Angry Asian Lady either. She was pretty nice, actually. So was the woman cleaning tables. 

My mother and brother ordered the shrimp cocktail after seeing the sign outside. It's shrimp for $0.99. Somehow I wouldn't expect spectacular. They didn't get spectacular either. I don't eat seafood, so I have no opinion on how it tasted. But they got it, and mixed the sauce and whatever shredded up green stuff was in there in too. Big complaint was it was too spicy for both of them. 

They asked one employee there if they could rinse the shrimp off and get that horrible sauce off, not wanting to waste food/product. The waitress, I suppose you could call her, looked at us strangely. Like she had no idea what a strainer was or even how to rinse something off. Some people can burn water, and I would presume she is one of those. Anyway, instead of rinsing the yucky sauce off, she just got them two new shrimp cocktails and they didn't mix it into the sauce again. 

Customer service was good, I had no complaints there. Food was so-so. I looked at everything they had out on the line, and nothing looked exciting. I'm not a big fan of Chinese food though either. 

Would I return? No. It's not a place that screams anything special to me. Like I said, had we not noticed the sign and my family wanted to try it, I would've walked right by it and kept going.
