One thing that I was not aware of is that it is a drive-thru Mexican style restaurant. Not that there's anything wrong with that, but maybe I was expecting more of a hole in the wall, divey taco joint? 

The tacos were only ok,  but the agua fresca was fab.  I mean you can't really mess up agua fresca, but I would definitely come back and drive through for another one. Lots of different flavor choices, and fast and accurate service.",qNeMBnzJc3Kwk8Z39TDZEg,2,2,4,k3JfT-q9ViLp_jIlYXJI8g

My work schedule has me by one location or another nearly every day of the week and it's hard to stay away on taco Tuesdays. The new drive-thru available makes this even harder, now that it's so fast.

Their asada is consistently smoky and fresh, one of my favorite versions in town, and their al pastor is my second-choice protein. All tacos come with the works, done right with cilantro, onion, and guac, with additional red and green salsa at each table. Sides include chips/salsa (which I wish were included) or rice/beans. Treat yourself to a tasty agua fresca with your meal- and if you can't decide on a flavor, they'll combine them all for you!",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,17,12,4,8xQv-k4XlExVSGxVJe3pHw

Why don't you walk in and order? Well why have a drive through if you don't use it! Also, I usually have a sleeping baby in the car. 

Food was okay. My steak salad was huge, needs a bit more dressing than they give you. My husband got a steak burrito. It all was very boring tasting. Yet I kept going to give them another chance. I live very close.

2713194,2018-04-02,0,3281FKql3HVOzSVxymjJRg,"The concept of the restaurant is good.  Mexican food and aguas frescas.  If you've never been, be prepared to sample their spin on aguas frescas.  They have your tradition horchata but they also have drinks with chia seeds.  It's quite different but tasty.

On my visit I ordered the carne asada nachos and a carne asada taco.  I made the mistake of not asking how their large tacos are prepared.  The taco is more of a folded up quesadilla with carne asada stuffed in the middle.  They add salsa and guac.  If you are a fan of those things, you will enjoy.  I, however, do not enjoy the texture of quesadillas so this was a bit off-putting for me.

The nachos are ok.  They are served with pinto beans (whole, not refried), carne asada, guacamole, sour cream, and salsa.  They taste great to start, but because the beans are too watery they make the chips soggy quickly.  I like my nachos to be crispy.  An improvement would be to serve the toppings on the side as a dip for the chips.  The carne asada I believe is cooked on a flat top so it doesn't get the char that a grill would provide.

Overall, it's decent for a quick lunch and if you know how to order.",xSvbDk6TFQoVn9lioHSssA,0,0,3,Z3OKW1BowMyOOBx-jNf-xQ

3088835,2018-02-01,0,3281FKql3HVOzSVxymjJRg,"To think that I thought Frijoles and Frescas was too upscale for my weekly taco fix. 

Desert Inn is unfortunately just far enough away from Charleston and Tropicana which both have amazing taco selections. I thought Frijoles and Frescas could be the answer but it is not. Their building and menu make this place look like a Chipotle or something. We ordered 2 Carne Asada mini tacos, an al pastor burrito, cheese quesadilla and cheese nachos. About the last two.. I made better nachos in a microwave in high school. The cheese burned a hole in the styrofoam container. Probably half the nachos didn't have cheese and the quesadilla was paper thin. The Carne Asada tacos were better.. meat wasn't too fatty. I could get a few of these again if I were desperate. The al pastor burrito wasn't as plump as burritos from any other taco shop nearby. The al pastor flavor was strong, too bad it didn't have any pineapple. 

Pretty disappointed in this place. It was the exact opposite of what I thought it was going to be and definitely not worth coming back when there are so many other taco shops to explore.",rYPjqZO89ABei1fsZBSUbA,1,1,2,-T9uK8kx6xPPFb2lJQlgSg

Frijoles? Well...not so much.

My friend and I stopped by for lunch and were pleasantly surprised at how nice the interior is for a joint that has a drive-thru. The reclaimed wood, lanterns, and flat screen TVs definitely step them up a notch from most comparable taco shops.

I got the watermelon fresca and it was a treat. That was probably the best part of my meal. You know when you hear a new song on the radio and you shazam it and it becomes your seasonal anthem? That's what a watermelon fresca tastes like. It's my new jam.

I got the chicken quesadilla and sad to say, it was kind of disappointing. I can get a better one elsewhere -- they seem to skimp out on the meats. My friend opted for a burrito, and in the style of a deflated balloon, it tilted toward the scanty side. 

I'd be back to try their other frescas, but I'll probably skip the food.",HcT3BZLc25R9eekoHBA1MQ,1,0,3,RufbOYDMe0_hAmgH9Rm4Jg

The tortilla was a perfect combination of slightly crisp on the outside soft on the inside. They also use a light hand on the cheese which allowed the flavor of the meet and guacamole come through. The hot and mild table sauces were also delicious.
