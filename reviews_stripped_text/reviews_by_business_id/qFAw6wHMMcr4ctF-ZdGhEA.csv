12032,2015-12-27,0,qFAw6wHMMcr4ctF-ZdGhEA,I have been coming here for years and it only gets better. The service is fantastic and it has the charm of a cafe in Venice. I would highly recommend the fillet mignon meatballs and the eggplant appetizers. Great wine list and great prices for AMAZING food. Will be back soon!

13527,2013-10-01,3,qFAw6wHMMcr4ctF-ZdGhEA,"Nice lady that seated us but it was all downhill from there. 

WAY OVERPRICED!!!!

They charge $8 for an iced tea!!!!

So we ordered a diet Pepsi instead $4, thinking I could choke that down since this is a Vegas hotel and $4 is standard (albeit criminal)...... Out comes a super tiny glass bottle of diet Pepsi with a glass of ice. I didn't even know they made glass bottles that small. It was sent back. 

The linguini bolognese was bland. Plus, we ordered spaghettini (thin spaghetti) instead of linguini, but got linguini.... Maybe that's because the guy didn't write anything down.  He also didn't check on us, despite walking by about 5 times (this place is VERY small) until we were half way through our meals. He offered to remake the meals, but we said not to bother. 

Conclusion: A RIPOFF FOR BLAND FOOD. GO ELSEWHERE.",8sbrIM_nbiOUdCz4WioMVQ,0,2,1,AKwZBsTUaIMmrHCtpA2RgQ

It was a cute place but the waiter was unapproachable and seemed annoyed by us every time we asked him something (aka to get the menu again etc.). After reading the other reviews I was expecting amazing food and service but it was very average and not good customer service. Oh and the garlic rolls weren't that great either like others said.

So we get to sit & don't feel very welcomed. ..money is still green right? Anyways we order the ceasar salad & shrimp scampi, the salad was just like any other you can get anywhere & our pasta dish was blah! It didn't look appetizing and had unnecessary bread crumb crap on top of the shrimp that my husband & I both had to scrape off to taste the flavor of the shrimp. Oh and the garlic bread that I was sooo looking forward to after reading the other reviews wasn't great, I don't know if we got an old batch or they cooked ours differently, but they lacked flavor. We will absolutely never eat here again even if it's the last Italian restaurant left in Vegas.

67764,2011-11-22,0,qFAw6wHMMcr4ctF-ZdGhEA,"Came during our anniversary trip. I was looking for a great non-celebrity chef Italian place for dinner and read all of the great reviews on this little gem. We were not disappointed! It is kind of hidden away from other restaurants, has limited seating but we had no problem getting a table immediately. The garlic rolls were so fresh and garlic-y! Husband ordered a delicious red wine - dont recall the exact name but it was a $38 Primativo. Our entrees came out very quickly and piping hot. Husband had gnocchi with pesto sauce and I the linguini carbonara. Pesto sauce w as extremely fresh and vibrantly green. The gnocchi was the perfect texture, not gummy or pastey. The carbonara was so creamy yet light. Even though we ate all of our entrees and were extremely full, we decided to share the tiramasu. We managed to polish it off quickly! Highly recommend! We will definitely make this a regular stop on all of our future trips.",gDiLE8ItF_yHGwtkPHGbfg,0,0,5,I7swx9EeJnmu5-9_aRfPyg
74731,2011-07-22,0,qFAw6wHMMcr4ctF-ZdGhEA,"I'm really surprised, actually shocked, by this place averaging 4 stars after 60+ reviews! I definitely do not get this one at all!!! I guess I must be a little jaded because I grew up in an small town area of New York where probably half, maybe more, of the restaurants were owned by Italians. When I first walked up to this place I was a little reluctant to eat here. In fact, after looking at the plates on the tables my friend and I kept on walking. However, we couldn't make a decision on where else to eat so we turned around and went back. Oops! (why didn't I listen to my first impression?) The dinner rolls that were served at the beginning of the meal were cold and tasteless. I certainly hope they were not the garlic rolls that I see praised in several reviews. If they were then they must have forgotten the garlic with these rolls. The only redeeming part of my meal was the eggplant rotelli appetizer which was rolled up eggplant with ricotta cheese covered with a pomodoro sauce. If I was forced to eat here again then this is what I would order.  The meal I ordered was Chicken parmigiana. I guess I must have strayed too far from their mainstays on this one. The chicken was very tough. It tasted as if it was frozen the heated up in a microwave. The pasta served with it was covered in the pomodoro sauce which actually is uninspiring but goes well with the eggplant and ricotta. The pasta also tasted like it came from the microwave. In fact, the past was so hot I cannot see how it could have been made any other way. It didn't dawn on me that an Italian place could not at least make an edible chicken parmigiana. 
The service was okay, but I would not call it a friendly place. I guess their goal is to serve 5% of the people that walk by their establishment at least once in their lifetime which is enough to make a go of the business. 
If you ever spent time eating at restaurants in Italian areas back east then run as fast as possible away from this establishment. 
By the way, this was $37 each even though we split an appetizer and had no drinks other than tap water. It was a horrible waste of money. This is definitely not a $$ place if you are ordering a meal. I guess it fits the bill if ordering a pizza.",xOjtlIjWS0djtoYhjBDgxA,0,0,1,3e2z9cEU6k6rQqjMOVwqHg

We got the menu and everything and were excited about the food. Then the manager came to us and kicked us out. He said there was no server to serve us at the bar. Why would they seat us in the first place and then kick us out?! The service management is truly horrible. Which business does that???,o_h44NrSRh51eQDyhSWCdg,0,0,1,z7V4see6-H1w_gU_UiyyQg

Pros:
Good service
Nice waiters
Dishes have generous proportions.  Two people could split one seafood special.
Yummy soft bread smothered in garlic.  Sooooo good.


Con:
Pricey.  The dishes aren't worth the price.  It's good food but not THAT good. For a family of 4 it was $160. Crazy. We all got pastas. No drinks. 
I feel like the seafood quality should be a little better but that's just me. I'm picky with that cus my parents have a sushi restaurant.  So i like the fresh stuff. 
And for the price i wish they would make fresh pasta..",a9qU9PLgCZ3Sdn5qSAyQpA,3,0,3,pIKnVvKDCwiswy2gisVVMw

120733,2013-06-01,0,qFAw6wHMMcr4ctF-ZdGhEA,"My husband and I were craving Italian, so we made a special trip here after reading the great reviews. Before writing this, I actually pulled up the photos to make sure we'd eaten at the right place!

We arrived at 8 and found a wait of about 15-20 minutes (after calling about 30 minutes earlier to inquire about the wait and make a reservation and being told we would have no problem being seated); oh well, not a big deal. We went next door to the magic shop and returned at 8:05 to the four parties or so waiting next to the host. The two parties in front of us were still planted inches from the host (including another party of two that had been waiting when we first arrived). As we stood there, we saw two people walk up to an empty table that had just been cleared. The host hurried up to the party and told them that the table hadn't been bused but there was a table in the back that had been and he led them to it. WTH?!  Clearly, this annoyed those of us waiting in line. After seeing this, a party of two that was AFTER us on the list rushed to the host and demanded to be seated. And they were. Just like that. My husband talks to the host and of course we are blamed because he called our name and we didn't answer. Hmm, so he called our name within 5 minutes of us arriving (after JUST estimating that the wait would be 15-20 minutes), ignored the fact we'd been making active eye contact with him since, and somehow he called our name before he called the parties of the same size immediately in front of us in line. Right. Dude, no sympathy for the fact I've been waiting patiently with a big pregnant belly?

For some reason, we stayed and the host did apologize for the wait when he finally seated us--but not for being unfair and likely dishonest about calling us. The garlic rolls were tough and bland except for the topping. The service was polite, rushed. We saw our waiter a few brief times. The gnocchi itself was very good; the pesto lacked bite. The meatballs were the highlight.

Since my last visit about a year ago they have expanded their business to the unit next to them -- business must be good and I can see why. They make one of the best if not the best meatballs. Really no lie! Their meatballs are consistently soft, plump and tasty. I have yet to find another Italian restaurant that makes better meatballs. Good decor and ambiance -- felt cozy inside with opera like music playing in the background. Clean restaurant and attentive servers were a plus.

205964,2011-04-23,0,qFAw6wHMMcr4ctF-ZdGhEA,"My friend and I went here for dinner while we were staying at the Venetian. My thoughts:

- The place is really small - probably 6-7 tables inside the restaurant and another 7 or so in the mall just outside the restaurant (still indoors). But I liked the feel, it's a cute place.

- Our waiter was great. I asked for a wine suggestion and he gave it to me. It was a house wine, nothing amazing, but I did like it better than the cab that my friend got, which was my alternative, so that marks it as a positive. He also joked with us, was very nice and courteous, just all-around good service.

- The food was very good. Granted, I was really hungry, so part of the satisfaction was certainly just getting food in my stomach. My friend got the chicken francese and I got the baked ziti. We semi-shared (I gave her a 1/4 of mine and she gave me a 1/4 of hers). I enjoyed both dishes, although maybe the baked ziti a bit more than the chicken.

398873,2012-02-03,0,qFAw6wHMMcr4ctF-ZdGhEA,"We went here for dinner.  
Started off with garlic rolls were good.  Virgin Olive Oil and Balsamic vinegar were provided on the table for dipping.  The Balsamic vinegar was sweeter and not as acrid as the one from DOCG.  I accompanied my meal with a Moretti, an Italian beer and really liking this over Peroni.  There is less of an aftertaste and more pleasing to my palate.

Ordered the Linguine Carbonara.  I wanted to taste it so I have a reference of how it should taste.  Most comments online say why order it when you can just make it at home.  They are correct.   Most restaurants serve carbonara but they often add heavy cream and a whole bunch of other items.  Trattoria Reggiano was the only one I found that serves it how it is should to be, Pancetta, Cheese, Egg, and Pasta, that's it.  Overall, the taste was close to how I make it so I'm glad I'm in the general vicinity.  The criticism I have though is that they a used a little too much pancetta and the sauce could have been a little looser.  Additionally, there was little or no black pepper.  Should have asked for freshly cracked black pepper but instead used black pepper on the table, which didn't add much.

My friend had the Chicken Marsala.  It was very good.  The dish overall was not greasy.  The sauce had a lot of flavor.  Unlike a lot of Chicken Marsala we get in Hawaii where they use too much butter/oil where it masks the Marsala and chicken flavors.

Regarding they other parts of the meal, service was ok.  It lacked in the beginning but picked up later on.  Didn't really care to eat outside in the mall as the tables were too close to each other.

I would highly recommend this place if you are looking for simply Italian food.",8HSPqescPcwOmQ6sQ3-TTg,0,0,4,69HWU-OVVxRdeF_sBSoJbw

420636,2017-04-05,0,qFAw6wHMMcr4ctF-ZdGhEA,"Nice little Italian restaurant in the Venetian. A little bit hard to find as it is tucked behind the food court and surrounded by a couple of other restaurants. Made reservations last minute for 6:30 and was happy that they could accommodate my party of 4 at such short notice. We were able to get a table on the outside of that restaurant that gives a view of the Grand Canal Shoppes. The place itself is a bit noisy with the open kitchen and the foot traffic around the restaurant. 

First off, they provide the table with garlic knots. Very aromatic and fresh and warm and soft when I pulled it apart. Very happy that they give it to us complimentary. For appetizers, we ordered the calamari to share. Nice light batter on the calamari so it wasn't too heavy of an appetizer. For the entrees, I had the penne a la vodka. The rest of my party had the chicken parm, linguine with clams, and shrimp scampi. Let me start of by saying that penna a la vodka is my favorite pasta dish so maybe my expectations are too high. Don't get me wrong, there was nothing wrong with the pasta as it was decent but the sauce wasn't as thick and creamy as I am usually used to. There wasn't that much sauce to cover all the pasta and the sauce was a little watery. The rest of the dishes were alright as well but not the best we have had.

On a side note, our waiter was very nice and made jokes throughout the night, which was entertaining and appreciated. He seemed to really love his job. Also on top of the tablecloths, they put a sheet of paper (I'm guessing to keep the tablecloths clean) and provided the table with crayons, which was nice to pass the time as we waited for our food.

Really good garlic knots but other than that your average Italian restaurant. Nothing terrible but nothing superb on the menu.",by-tJ56fIfWjTJFivDxkAg,0,0,3,ayFihaL0y10c4_7aQFMalA

The second time was last week, and my entree this time was just okay.  Nothing special.  However....I have to rave about their caprese salad with imported mozarella cheese.  It was awesome!  My wife and I just returned from a two-week Italy tour, and we ate all Italian food and drank a lot of Italian wine.  We had our share of caprese salads, and I tell you, Trattoria Reggiano's caprese salad is as good, or better, than those served in Italy!  It is worth recommending.  They use imported buffalo mozarella, and it is wonderfully delicious.  You must try it, even if you're so-so on tomatoes.  The combination is terrific and not to be missed.

As for an entree, I would suggest maybe ordering something with a sauce other than tomato based.  Their pasta is very good al dente; I just think a sauce other than tomato-based gives more suble taste and texture back to the pasta dish itself.  Next time I'm here I'll try the veal.  

Do not be dissuaded from trying this Trattoria from the setting.  Yes, it is in a hotel mall next to a magic shop and a Coffee Bean, but the food is good and it is run by genuine Italians.  Not as expensive as the numerous famous chefs' restaurants at the Venetian Hotel, not in as nice a setting, but the proof is in the pasta and sauces. Give it a go; I don't think you'll regret it.

4 girls total who ordered similar things: 3 girls ordered the linguine and replaced the clams with shrimp. ($24)

I personally ordered the agio e olio ($14) and added shrimp (+$6) - it was embarrassingly horrible. Oil was splattered to try and mask the low-quality, dry pasta. Even an attempt to make the dish tolerable by adding spices did not work at all. It was beyond disappointing. 

The other 3 dishes were just as dry. One of the girls ordered Alfredo sauce as a replacement to the original and let's just say, they all looked the same.

None of us finished.

Our conversations at the table consisted on how much better we could have made pasta, and how awful our waiter was. While asking for drink options, we merely said water. To which he asked sparkling or regular. We said regular and that was it. He brings out a bottle and slaps on a $19 charge for 2 bottles water. Of course we complained and got that taken off, but we should have also complained about our food. That was one of our biggest regrets.

I've tried Taqueria Cañonita which is a restaurant located close to Trattoria. Their food was good but with smaller portions and double the price.

747402,2012-10-09,0,qFAw6wHMMcr4ctF-ZdGhEA,"My husband and I had a late lunch/early dinner, nothing over the top, but not the usual 'chain' meal. Based on the reviews I read on yelp, we thought we'd give Trattoria Reggiano a go. We weren't disappointed. 

Never have walked through the maze of shops within and around The Venetian, so we enjoyed the stroll to find T.R. tucked into a small curve in The Grand Canal Shoppes.  We arrived around 5:00 and had our choice of dining 'in' or 'patio' (which basically means the wide side-walk of the shoppes). We joined two other parties on the patio (it's always entertaining to people watch in Vegas!). 

Warmly greeted by Amanda (who was fabulous); gave us time to look over the menu. I wasn't sure about the chianti served by the glass and she offered to get me a sample. Pleasantly surprised to find it was a nice little chianti and was poured a very full glass of wine ($11).   Hubby and I decided on a starter of Filet Mignon Meatballs ($12) since many reviews highlighted them; very good start to the meal. Good flavor, great sauce, and nicely proportioned.  

For dinner, my husband order the Salsiccia pizza ($15) while I, based on Amanda's suggestion, tried the special of  mushroom fettuccine ($16).  In the meantime, the home made garlic rolls arrived (yummy) along with the above mentioned meatballs. May I add...the leftover pomodoro sauce from the meatballs is amazing with the garlic rolls. Hey, we're on vacation, calories and carbs don't count, right?  Our entrees were served within 12-15 minutes.  

My husband enjoyed his pizza - especially the pieces of fresh garlic that were cooked in the pizza sauce. Said it had very good flavor although it didn't look anywhere as good as it tasted. The crust was nicely browned; crisp but a nice soft center. However, he agreed that my dish was definitely better.  The pasta was cooked slightly al dente (perfect); the sauce was delicious and not too overwhelming (as I've had at other restaurants); and the mushrooms gave a wonderful depth and texture to the dish.  Amanda had said it was her favorite meal but typically is only served once a month. Lucky me - it was wonderful. 

The pizza was enough for two as was my pasta. As we (luckily) have a hotel room with a kitchenette, we took the leftovers with us.  Nice late night snack after spending an evening in the casino, lol.  The ambiance of T.R. is quite nice; quaint vibe of a Italian cafe much like you see when visiting Italy. As we visited for an early dinner on a Monday night (10/8/12), there was seating available. But leaving an hour later, all the tables were full and I noted some people waiting. 

If you're looking for some good Italian food, in a casual setting, with some top-notch service, you'll want to visit Trattoria Reggiano.",0xNghten2qrcsgmkzpQytg,0,0,4,Ew5LFCkZvmwE1gmYqOLhZA

It usually has a lengthy wait because it's fairly small, but it's definitely worth it. The staff was very nice and remembers my friends whenever they go back.

I had the Spaghetti Puttanesca with no anchovies and asked for broccoli instead. They brought broccoli on the side and it was the best steamed and sauteed broccoli I have ever tasted.

-Garlic bread (free): delicious.  If you aren't afraid of carbs, which no one in my family is, these are your best friend.  Warm, soft, and garlicky.  These were so good that we asked for another serving after devouring the first basketful.

-Calamari ($14): a very generous portion.  It was almost too much for the four of us, almost.  There was a nice balance of both the tentacles and the rings/body and the marinara dipping sauce was just right.  

-Baked ziti ($16): cheesy penne pasta; my sister seemed to enjoy this dish quite a bit.

-Spaghetti and meatballs ($18): the spaghetti is good, but what makes this dish great is the meatballs.  They are certified angus beef filet mignon meatballs.  These meatballs are perfectly seasoned, perfectly soft and flavorful.  I would definitely recommend this dish. 

-Gnocchi ($18): they were out of pesto so we opted for the alfredo sauce.  The gnocchi was perfectly soft and the alfredo was nice and creamy.  In fact, the sauce was excellent for dipping the garlic bread into.

-Cannoli (free): it was my birthday and the waiter let me pick out a dessert for free!  He brought out four spoons so that we could all share also.  

If you can't tell already, I really enjoyed my dining experience here.  The service was very friendly and helpful, the food was hot, and tasty, plus- I got a free dessert!  The prices are very fair and the food is high-quality.",CNiC7YaqoPwhaLPLaHnUAA,2,0,5,DefN2pQEPRDSgha1BaRFww
995589,2009-09-04,0,qFAw6wHMMcr4ctF-ZdGhEA,"We stayed at the Venetian in August for our anniversary and were looking for a place to eat for lunch on our last day in Vegas. This place is hidden away close to the Food Court area and behind a few of the shops on Canal street. There is a outside sitting area where you can watch people walking by and some booths inside. 

The GF and I were craving some pizza and the pies looked good (yes I was looking at peoples food while walking by :-p). So we decided to stop in for lunch, it was quiet as it was a Tuesday afternoon. We sat in a cozy booth and it was quite comfortable. They brought us some garlic rolls with olive oil and balsamic vinegar. The rolls were just ok, but they were free so no complaints from me. We shared the Pepperoni and olive pizza. It was quite a tasty pizza, the sauce was really good, and tasted great with the peperoni's. I was quite impressed with how good the crust was, thin and crunchy, not too doughy. It was the perfect size pizza for the two of us and I was not overly stuffed when we left. While we were eating an Italian tourist came in speaking Italian to the wait staff, for a second we felt as we were in Italy. Our waitress was great, attentive and provided to the atmosphere. 

Overall a good experience, would I eat here again if i was in Vegas? Probably not but that is not because of the food or service but simply because there are too many place to try in Vegas. Why eat at the nearby food court when this is right next to it? If you're looking for an relatively inexpensive, tasty meal, I would definitely recommend Trattoria's.",OCJAXpxRUzY1gV8mYO470Q,0,1,4,ADyVDatcSUWJTGJDTtQO8g

I LOVE, LOVE, LOVED this place. As when you're walking through the Venetian feeling like you're ""outdoors"", strolling Venice, Trattoria Reggiano exuded a relaxing respite from shopping and the many, many frou-frou Vegas restaurant options. The smell of the fresh-baked garlic rolls becomes more pungent as you get closer and the warm, welcoming personalities of the staff definitely made us feel as if we were walking into our neighborhood Italian restaurant. Everything felt very authentic from the quality of the olive oil, the fresh-grated parmesan cheese, and the colorful options of Italian soda and (iced) teas. 

Food standouts (SOOOO good my friend and I ate there two days out of our 3 day Vegas trip): 

- Garlic rolls: Ridiculously delicious. Served piping hot. 

- Spaghetti Aglio e Olio: generous portion of pasta cooked perfectly al dente with olive oil, crushed red pepper, parsley, and fresh grated parmesan cheese. A simple but traditional dish so you know the flavor was REALLY good. 

- Penne in Vodka Sauce: another generous portion of pasta cooked perfectly al dente with shallots, vodka, proscuitto in creamy pink sauce. My friend is super-model skinny and she ate the entire dish - it was THAT good. 

- Cannoli. Holy eff. This is the best cannoli I've ever tasted. The marscarpone cream was light and fluffy, the shell was crunchy, and there were just enough chocolate chips for sweetness. 

Considering all of the trips I've taken to Vegas, Trattoria Reggiano is definitely a standout. I can't wait to visit again. Delizioso!",dJnqnQ4MgQX0NmjHEysvoQ,0,1,5,VI5872Bdm5p1zwC-yL8BXA

Warm Spinach Salad: huge portion. Meant to be a shared appetizer or a main dish. Not a side salad. All the ingredients were fresh The tomatoes, nuts, bacon, onion, cheese... EVERYTHING WENT SO WELL TOGETHER.
Lobster ravioli: good portion of lobster in the ravioli. Did not taste seafood-y at all which was pleasant.

One would think there would be several more dining options open and serving late night dinners, especially on the weekends and after shows but the options are a bit scarce. 

The best thing here... the garlic rolls! I really liked them. Everything else was just mediocre.

Our drinks - I had a carafe of red sangria. Not great! Didn't finish it. I didn't think I was very picky about my sangria, turns out I am. Perhaps I just like Blake Shelton's version. My boyfriend had a mojito, he didn't seem so fond of it. I was looking for a nice Sangiovese on the menu, they don't have one.

I had Linguine in Clam Sauce. Gotta love a meal that puts you to work after midnight ;) the baby clams sautéed in white wine, garlic and olive oil were yummy, the linguine was lackluster. Did not taste like fresh pasta at all.

My boyfriend ordered the Spaghetti and Meatballs so I refrained from ordering the Meatball appetizer since he'd have them with his dish. Our server was so sure of these meatballs made with filet mignon he even said he'd take care of us if my boyfriend didn't like them. I thought for sure they'd be amazing. My boyfriend wasn't impressed at all and since I don't eat a lot of meat I wasn't going to even give them a try. My boyfriend finished his meal and we both replied politely when asked how things were.

I mean who wants to be the couple at closing to tell them their food isn't great...? Not us, apparently :)

I love Italian food and this place does not disappoint.  From the large portions, delicious food, and friendly service... it's no wonder why there is wait.

If you love Italian food and are able to find this place in the shopping malls of the Venetian, you'll be in for a real treat.  The meal starts with the complimentary garlic butter rolls... sinfully good.  As usual, we shared a number of entrees for the table including a appetizer, pizza, and pasta.  So we ordered calamari, prosciutto pizza, and the famous spaghetti and meatballs.  All were very delicious and are actually making my mouth water while I write this review.  I do have to point out that their meatballs are far from regular.  Their claim to fame is that their meatballs are filet mignon... and I believe them 100%.  The meatballs are very tender and almost fall and you cut through them with your fork.  They are ridiculous good.

Don't miss out on Trattoria Reggiano if you are in search for good italian food in Las Vegas.

I LOVED the eggplant parm and the penne.  We also got some baked ziti, which I didn't particularly care for.  It wasn't bad, but the sauce/cheese combo just didn't jive with me.  The bread could have been good, but it was very cold; like they took it right out of the fridge.

I do want to call out that the waiter was kind of an ass.  It was strange, because he would do everything we asked and would return relatively politely, but whenever we asked for something he always grimaced, sighed, or pouted.  Very strange.  All the waiters here were old men.  Maybe he was just tired due to old age.  I don't know, but I found this strange and worth calling out.  And it wasn't just him; even the guy we talked to in terms of seating was pretty rude.  He said we could have this ""inside"" table right away and when asked about an outside ""table"" he rudely just said, ""NO!"".  The service is the only reason I bumped my review down to 3 instead of 4 stars.

There were at least a couple of other highly rated restaurants at this hotel.  I wish we had gone to one of those.  I'm sure they would've had great food AND service.

After finding it in a mall like food court within the Venetian we were surprised at how small it was! It was pretty packed, but we offered to wait, and it was worth it! The food was great and it was nice getting away from the craziness of Vegas for a little bit without breaking the bank.

Sadly, we were seated by a group of young drunk guys who were spilling their drinks and being loud and rude to the waitstaff. If we didn't have the misfortune of this, I would give the place 5 stars. I understand that this is more common when you're in Vegas, but I have to judge the overall experience fairly, and with the place being so small in size, it was very hard to ignore.. Outside of this, the restaurants was 5 stars itself, keep up what you're doing and maybe throw in a apology or two when your guests have to put up with other rowdy customers ;).",YPCWMsF7BLzK_CQ18QNOcQ,0,0,4,jkNGrIOK-Kc2JfO2iFaw7A

1353925,2015-10-19,0,qFAw6wHMMcr4ctF-ZdGhEA,"On our most recent Vegas trip my family chose to dine here again instead of trying a new place because it is THAT amazing.  About three years ago we celebrated my sister's birthday here and we loved it so much we celebrated my mother's birthday here this time. Three years and it is STILL consistently great!

I made a reservation on Open Table for a Monday at 5:30pm. We arrived on time and our table was ready. There were other guests, but it wasn't too busy - understandable given it was early and a Monday.  The atmosphere is kinda casual dressy - there are white tablecloths and cloth napkins, but it is brightly lit and open. There were children dining as well so it is kid friendly. I think they'll even give the kids crayons. 

The waiter was VERY friendly and funny! Made casual jokes but wasn't inappropriate or anything like that. He promptly brought us water and their delicious buttery/oily/garlicky rolls! They're so soft and fluffy! There's olive oil and balsamic for dipping as well. Mmm the perfect way to start a meal. Our food came out pretty quickly too. It's an open kitchen so you can see them preparing everything fresh!

Chicken Cesar salad ($16): a little pricy for a salad, but I had it as my entree so not too bad on Vegas price standards. They give you a big plate of romaine perfectly coated in creamy dressing. It's topped with shaved Parmesan and grilled chicken that was marinated in balsamic. So good and a good amount to share. 

Calamari appetizer ($14): perfect size for the 6 of us to share. Each piece fried crispy and there was a good ratio of rings to tentacles. Served with yummy marinara sauce and lemon. 

Filet mignon meatballs ($16): my sister and her husband shared this appetizer, but let us all try it. The most tender meatballs you will ever have! Mmm the tomato sauce is perfect with it to. Topped with Parmesan and comes with three to an order. 

Penne in vodka sauce ($18): perfectly cooked penne in a creamy tomato sauce cooked with onions and topped with prosciutto. My boyfriend and I thoroughly enjoyed it. 

Chicken Marsala ($22): my mother's boyfriend ordered this and said it was the BEST chicken Marsala he's ever had! I tried it and it WAS good, considering it's something I would probably never order. The chicken was tender and the sauce was well balanced. 

Spaghetti bolognese ($18): my sister and her husband shared this and said it was very tasty - they ate the entire plate. 

Since we were celebrating my mother's birthday they gave us a tiramisu on the house! So sweet of them. It was served in a glass cup with two lady fingers sticking out of it. The cup was held to the plate with caramel which was tasty and cool to look at. 

Once again this restaurant did not disappoint and I would return and recommend! I'm sure everything on the menu is delicious, but then I always want to eat my favorites because they're that good!

1442095,2011-04-10,0,qFAw6wHMMcr4ctF-ZdGhEA,"For our last night in Vegas we were looking for something a little on the cheap. The roulette wheel was not kind to us. The Venetian website listed this as a casual dining place in the one $ price range so it seemed like it'd be the perfect place. 

For two glasses of wine, some meatballs for an app, and two pasta dishes we walked out $90 poorer. When you start approaching the $100 range I'm thinking of a decent place back home on Federal Hill in Providence or the North End in Boston. While Trattoria Reggiano wasn't bad, it certainly wasn't worth it. 

It's a small place with some very crowded tables outside the restaurant. We were quickly seated at one of these and it had all the atmosphere of a mall food court. By the end of the meal I felt as I intimately knew the couple on the side of us because we could easily hear the conversation as well as we could hear our own. Luckily the small children on the other side of us were extremely well behaved because being stuffed so closed to them, it had the potential for disaster. 

The service was ok, but there was a team of four guys working the place and each of the four had a hand in our service. We didn't have one set waiter. One of the guys didn't like to talk and took our order with mumbles and gestures, but the rest of the guys were nice enough. 

The small plate of tortelini I had was decent enough, but nothing to write home about. The gnocci that the girlfriend had was drowning in pesto and wasn't homemade. 

We would've had a cheaper and more enjoyable dinner at Olive Garden. We threw money away like drunken sailors all week and then picked a bad time to try searching out an inexpensive option. We would've been much better off dropping a few extra bucks on a nicer place.",9d5qvuyqYp07I-w2ovCKLw,2,0,2,WBpcMCMjPmDwz3fFMDQC0A

We walked up with our three kids when we saw there were at least six tables open.  We were told ""there was a reservation"" and that we could put our name on the list.  We did and went for a walk, for about 45 minutes.  We walked by again and guess what?  The same tables were open.  I asked again and guess what we were immediately seated, though the hostess seemed unwilling to do so.  What about that list? It was never mentioned.

They put us in the back corner.  I saw the same open table in the front patio that had been and still was open when we first asked to be seated.  And when I asked, you guessed it, a ""reservation.""  

The hostess had an extremely unwelcoming attitude. She said that they didn't have a kids' menu and we would have to order off of the adults menu.  Once we sat we were ignored for about 10 minutes.  It was clear that we weren't welcome, so we got up and left. 

When I walked by an hour later after eating somewhere else, that table was still open.   

Let's get one more thing straight - this is no gourmet restaurant - it's in the middle of a mall adjacent to a food court!  There are kids and families everywhere.

My expectations for the garlic knots were way too high.

The knots were barely warm, I don't even want to use the word ""warm"", but yeah... sad.  I believe they were tossed in some oil, herbs and garlic.  hmm oily cold bread.. meh.

I ordered the chicken marsala which I did not find anything special about.  It was rather bland and the sauce was not sticking to the pasta.  I also tried a bite of the bolognese and was not wowed by it either.  The pasta didn't really seem to absorb any flavor.  I was pretty sad because I wanted to try this place and dragged my friends there.  Most of them seemed ""meh"" about the food.

On the other hand, I tried my friend's lobster ravioli, and I really enjoyed it.  There were chunks of lobster inside, and the creamy sauce coated the ravioli well.  I would recommend this dish.

This restaurant is located near the shops.  You can also get there walking through the food court that's next to the parking structure (it is behind the Coffee Bean at the shops, not by the escalators).

The restaurants in St. Mark's Square were buzzing and had at least 20-30 minute waits, so we decided to give Trattoria Reggiano a try.  It is off the main canal areas and is definitely lacking atmosphere compared to many of the other Venetian eateries.  I had hoped the tucked away location would mean excellent food to make up for the lack of glam, but unfortunately the restaurant didn't deliver.

My husband's wood fired pizza was good and had great flavor & tasty crisp crust, but my meatball panini was more like a hoagie and was just ok.  The meatballs lacked flavor and the hoagie style bun ended up soggy.  I definitely regretted not going for the pizza!  I felt it was pricey for the quality.

It took us a while to find it since it's tucked away, but if you find the coffee bean, it's right there.

Wait staff was good and I'd give this place 4 stars if you want a quick pre-show bite or you're not worried about the ambiance.  That said, you're butted up against your neighbors and I was having to stare at a $150 gorilla suit and a crazy magician trying to sell a disappearing light that got old after 30 minutes (they have a magic shop next door). NOT A GOOD DATE PLACE, it's a cafe.

The tables are small and a bit cluttered (I don't need an industrial size of balsamic and olive oil, but I do need a plate to put it in).  The garlic bread knots were good, but as stated below, room temperature which took a bit away from them.  I do not agree with the other reviews as I thought the balsamic vinegar is a bit sweet for my taste.

The GF got hot tea and it was a packet of the cheapest tea in existence (I don't know that they get many people asking for tea, so wont dwell on that one.

We started with the warm baby spinach with goat cheese on flat bread, it was ok, I'm not a big fan of flat bread that's soggy in dressing, but the first couple were decent.

We split the spaghetti with meatballs which equated to a meat ball each with spaghetti.  It wasn't bad, but nothing to write home about either.

In short, it's a decent quick & easy bite for relatively cheap in the Venitian.  For better Italian, check out Enoteca San Marco or Postrio's pasta dishes in St Mark's square.",L7hVyYRvjou4_CGMoLtkUw,1,0,3,VHeF0DWEbzNpjVYdFu3QeQ

Trattoria Reggiano was an absolute delight as our last meal in Vegas. The flavors and consistency of their sauces is what going out for Italian is all about! I had the Baked Ziti entree with a side salad- caesar of course. My friend ordered the tortellini alfredo.

We arrived without a reservation around 930pm on a Friday night. We were seated immediately with no issues. There were a variety of menu options to choose with a primary focus on pasta and pizza dishes. Prices very between $10-22 depending on your level of hunger. But considering it's Vegas (inside the Venetian hotel at that) the prices were moderately fair. 

Our server was very attentive and courteous throughout our visit and the service was excellent. I would say we were in and out within 45mins-- I'm serious. 

Overall, I would definitely recommend this spot for an inexpensive, highly satisfying Italian dinner. The walk along the way also helps too. Soo many photo ops!",k_PlEjlkkcoYBQh3jSiUuQ,4,2,5,N3cURN43QhI343Jc2y_9Lw
1725766,2008-10-26,2,qFAw6wHMMcr4ctF-ZdGhEA,"I have mixed feelings about this Trat. 

Visiting Las Vegas last week, we wanted an intimate dinner before seeing The Phantom at the Venetian, and the Trattoria Reggiano is only a moment's walk from the theater. In light of the other reviews here, it seemed an inspired choice. It was less than that. 

On arrival, on a not-terribly-busy Thursday evening after the theater - about 9 PM - it looked terribly inviting: Tables in the walkway as if a true Italian trat, and a few booths and tables inside near the open kitchen. Charming. We asked the Maitre' d for a booth (it helps my hearing, which is very poor), and were told we would not have it, and were shown to a table inside by the wall. OK, but a disappointment, even though it saved me $10 top to the Maitre' d, who seemed oblivious.  

Delicious bread, with decent oil and vinegar, rapidly arrived, as did our waiter, who I asked for a recommendation between the spaghetti with meatballs (""filet mignon"") and the linquine bolognese. ""Eh!"" He said. ""It's the same sauce, just not in a meatball.""  Ummmm. The staff says the food is the same?  Disquieting. 

My pasta and my wife's Ziti arrived almost immediately, as we were still on our first piece of bread. Good service is not the same as fast service; this isn't Pasta Now, but a relaxing meal. Still, it was hot and freshly prepared. The Bolognese was tasty, and (as usual) I ate half, expecting to take it back to our room for lunch the next day. My wife, who eats like a bird, ate about a quarter of her Ziti, and as the second waiter came to remove our dishes, I said, ""It was delicious, but we want to take it with us."" He nodded and left.

 A few moments later, our waiter returned with a check - strangely, for an Italian restaurant, without asking if we wanted dessert - and I asked, ""Where is our food."" I got blank looks; the second waiter said, ""Thrown out.""  Argument follows. Finally, the headwaiter said, ""Wait. We'll recook for you."" This time, it takes longer, but when the bag returns, there are two tins inside; I look in the top one, and find bread. ""Where is my linguine?"" I ask. Blank looks all over again. More argument. Finally, another recook, we take the food, and leave. 

The service is obviously challenging, perhaps due in part to there being several languages and accents going on among the staff. The food was good, but not great; the meat sauce lacked seasoning (garlic is not all there is in this world). The Ziti was nice, but as it sat on the table, the cheese started changing from gentle yellow to bright orange. ""Cheese powder, perhaps?"" said my wife. But it was good, albeit a bit incandescent in appearance.  The ambiance was very good, with a slight hint of New York Italian as a result of the dark stained booths. 

Overall, better than the food court next door, but not the place for the intimate and relaxing after-theater supper that many might wish.",4Jz_1K3AfgEuawH-pQDUrw,5,2,2,G1q1suf1du06Hc40f2lNIg

After we ordered, our server brought us a basket of garlic cheesy bread with olive oil and black vinegar. The bread was warm and delicious!

For the appetizer, we got the filet mignon meatballs. There were 3 big meatballs in marinara sauce. I thought they tasted good but really tasted like normal meat balls to me but a little softer? I'm not really sure haha.

For the entree I got the lobster ravioli. They were very generous with the amount of lobster. The ravioli was delicious and the filling tasted like some kind of cheese with lobster! The sauce was an orange colored lobster sauce.

The ambiance was quite nice. This is in the Venetian so you kind of do get the feeling that you're in Venice. Also the server was very very kind and attentive! 

We left super full! The servings here are very generous. It is a little pricey though, since the total for our meal + tip for 4 people was around $140.",zVKVXvX6Fp-XSG3zEyLmDQ,1,3,4,X7k10EqVPiHYoNdohO2lIQ

If the slots aren't treating you well, at least you'll hit the jackpot here!
After passing this place up many times before, I had to stop in on my most recent vegas trip.  

It's easy to miss this place because it's located in the food court behind the Coffee Bean, but follow your nose and let your heart be your guide... either that or ask someone.

Filet Mignon Meatballs -  Holy meatballs!!! They're good.  The pomodoro sauce that the meatballs are served in is delicious but even without the sauce, the meat is tender, juicy and is filled with subtle flavors. 

Penne in Vodka sauce - I had to get my alcohol in some how, even though it was only 11am.  The penne was cooked to al dente perfection, sauteed in a pink sauce with bits of prosciutto.  The prosciutto pieces are very small, so if you want some meat, make sure you opt in on adding the grilled chicken, shrimp, or meatball to your pasta order.

Gnocchi al Pesto - How do you say it? GnoKki? GEenotchi?  Doesn't matter, because once you start eating, you wont be saying anything except, ""MmmMM.""  Probably one of the best gnocchi I've ever had and the pesto sauce is not too watery, not to thick -- divine.

I wish I had enough stomach room to try one of their desserts, but their good sized portions filled me up.

This place isn't ""cheap"" but it's so worth it.

So, why didn't this place get a 5 star rating?  
The bread.  
I am the queen of carbs and I love my breads.  The service bread looked like it would be amazing --buttery, golden brown, with parmesan.  But it was actually fairly dense and it wasn't warm.  I'm not sure if this is how they always serve their bread but if the bread was hot and soft, this place would merit a five star rating.",MspXtBLBkKJwEyfJ79YYJw,0,0,4,MaUG1wDxuKVYhnPH2085IA

Here's what happened: My friends asked the waiter what he recommended for pasta and he suggested some kind of pasta BOLOGnese, and they ordered that.  When he took my order, I said ""I'll also have the pasta BOLOGnese,"" I was craving pasta.  When our orders came, they got pasta dishes and I received something piled deep under green leaves.  Turns out he heard me order the Veal MILANese, and then he gave me attitude about it. Dude, you just recommended some bolognese stuff to half our table and I said I would also have that!  He did offer to replace the item, but I was too hungry to wait and didn't want my friends to wait for me to finish whenever I did get my replacement order, plus I already angered the guy that brings the food, so I wasn't going to risk it.  Conveniently for them, the Veal Milanese was one of the pricier entrees...

It should be a sign to you how good the food is that I gave them 4-stars despite my little kerfuffle.  Seriously, it was not easy trying to maintain a pissed-off front while eating that rather great Veal Milanese.  A lot has been mentioned about the quality of the bread, yes, it is also really good.

The pizzas aren't necessarily great, they're alright, we shared one as an appetizer, didn't really leave me craving more, I didn't even try to fight for the last slice.  Also, and this is very European of them, they serve the tiny-bottled sodas, meaning refills aren't free, and that is annoying.

I told him that I could buy an ID card right now in front of him to show him that's not real. He said ""that's our policy. If you don't have an ID you can't eat anywhere.""

We (a table of 6) were seated right away and garlic knots were at our fingertips before we could blink.

We tend to stick to cheaper places but everyone agreed the price was well worth how delicious the food was.

Read the Yelp reviews and they were all over the place, some five star, some one, so decided since food is pretty subjective we'd give it a try.

It's in the middle of the restaurant row and it's not quiet by any means.  Service was prompt and our server was pleasant but had absolutely no sense of humor and apparently didn't get that smiling is a nice gesture. 

We were immediately offered bread which instead of large hunks or bread sticks turned out to be rolls which were very good.  The server brought oil and balsamic to dip them in.  We each had a salad, big mistake.  They are huge and easily could be split.  Nothing to write home about, just a salad.

My husband who thinks the only Italian food is lasagna had that and said it was not bad.  Actually for him that's pretty high praise.  I had shrimp scampi which was strange to say the least.  Apparently I didn't read the description very well.  It was 7 shrimp sauteed in wine, garlic and butter which was fine, but then they topped that with some sort of odd stuffing.  I've never had shrimp scampi like that and I scraped the stuffing off after eating a bite.  The pasta is obviously home made and tasted very nice, cooked al dente but way too much pasta.

They have a nice wine list and I had a delicious pino grigio.  Would we go back again, probably not.  It was ok, just not great.",1HvVTMBEs8ZArJ62IGMbCw,0,0,3,kfSlvmwTbIFAiqpEAcrFOA

The food came out pretty quickly. Before your entree comes, they give you complimentary garlic knots and they are to DIE for. It comes out super hot, soft and delicious!! Dip it in some balsamic vinegar and oil and I could eat it for days. It's definitely comparable to the garlic knots at C&O's in Los Angeles if you've ever been there. I was thinking of ordering the lasagna but our waiter said they were out of lasagna for the day. HOW DO YOU RUN OUT OF LASAGNA AT AN ITALIAN RESTAURANT? Sure, it's one of your more popular items, so shouldn't you have a lot of ingredients for your popular dishes? To say the least, I was severely disappointed. I settled for the penne a la Vodka which is topped with diced prosciutto. The creamy pink sauce has a nice, delicate taste to it. I wish there was just more sauce though.

Anyways, this place is tucked away at the end of the Canal Shoppes at the Venetian. No, it doesn't have a big, neon sign and dim lighting. But it does have FABULOUS food in HUGE portions for CHEAP in VEGAS.

FABULOUS. HUGE. CHEAP. VEGAS. YES!!!

I enjoyed the Penne in Vodka Sauce much more than I did the Linguine Carbonara, though that was really good as well. But by the time I was getting really full, the Carbonara was getting too rich and cheesy, so the Penne was a bit lighter and therefore tastier to me.

Service was friendly and the people there are very non-pretentious and warm. The bread at the beginning, although a bit on the greasy side, was great too! Nice place to eat a meal without killing your wallet in Vegas :)",ileI06mnGv32dYOk3Qwmmg,1,0,5,0ZCiRElM-oIznTXmlSSjZQ

Caesar salads came, I am not a fan typically but picked off their plates and enjoyed! Not overwhelming Caesar dressing. My friend said she would have preferred it stronger, but everyone has an opinion :) Hubby had lobster ravioli, my friend had linguine &a clams in red sauce and I had the special (rigatoni with mushrooms, sausage and red sauce). We all cleaned our plates! I can be pretty picky about red sauce, and this was fabulous! Just enough sweet to cut any acid from the tomatoes, but still a really delicious tomato sauce!

We with started garlic knots . . . Bathed in butter.  Not what I call a good start.  We decided to make up for the bread with an appetizer of Calamari.  It came out over breaded and with a rubbery texture.  The sauces were tarter (can you say bottled), and marinara that was close to ketchup.

For the main course I had Salmon.  It was not well prepared and two carrots with mostly potatoes were what was supposed to be a vegetable side.  My son had veal piccata which again was bathed in a lemon butter.  Has no one learned that you can't cover bad food with butter and lemon?  His vegetable was the same as mine so nothing to rehash here.

I know we're in Las Vegas and meals are inherently expensive on the strip, but the quality and value of what we received was horrible.  It belongs in the fast food chain category, not Las Vegas.  The Venetian / Palazzo should be ashamed for having such a restaurant in their venue compared to the other wonderful establishments they have on site.

This place was legit. Everything from the filet mignon meatballs, to the cold antipasto platter, to the pasta, to the chicken, to the veal, to the seafood...it was all amazing. Like New York amazing. This was probably the best dinner we had during our 4 day stay. I only wish we had room for dessert. We were such fatties that there was no way we'd be able to eat something sweet and not need a nap. There was gambling to be done, after all!

Service was efficient and they made excellent recommendations when we were torn between a couple of items. They take pride in their food and it shows. You cannot go wrong here.

2575636,2011-11-17,0,qFAw6wHMMcr4ctF-ZdGhEA,"Delicious!  Best restaurant in the Venetian.
Found this restaurant on Yelp and couldn't have been happier.  It's hard to find within the canals of the Venetian.  In fact, we could barely even find it on the property map, it's that small and several employees we asked didn't know where it was located.

I had the Veal Parmigiana which may have been the best veal I have ever tasted.  The serving was huge and the veal was nicely breaded with a crispy crunch.  The sauce was an unusual orange color, but extremely tasty as well.  The bread, to die for...

I travel quite a lot to Vegas for work and have eaten at many of the famous chef restaurants including Batalli, Flay and LaGasse.   This was far better than any of those restaurants and I look forward to my next visit.

Note:  if you are having trouble finding the restaurant, it's right next to Harry Houdini Magic Shop...",DfWOHkcMFtljWihugUkZwQ,1,1,5,aZxqDKWxE3z6vqwCSgrbDA
2586538,2014-05-04,0,qFAw6wHMMcr4ctF-ZdGhEA,"I seriously love this cute Italian restaurant. Located inside the Venetian near the food court. It is closer to the back, a few shops from near the entrance of the parking garage. (You'll understand when you go there.) We went in and was seated in a booth. The inside was very small, but the booth made it feel spacious. The yellow walls and rustic photos made it feel very cozy and charming. The music was very nice too. It felt like I was in Italy, but not quite. But it made the ambiance a lot warmer.

Our server was very nice and was quite speedy. He had our waters out to us and our bread to us quite fast, but it was okay with me because I was thirsty. I read some of the other yelp reviews, and decided that I wanted to get the calamari. Calamari is probably one of my favorite appetizers. It was a huge portion. The calamari was so crispy and it was just delicious. It wasn't too salty and it had a tomato based dipping sauce which complimented the calamari perfectly. The added lemon juice made it extra delicious for me. This calamari dish was one of the best I've had. My boyfriend and I devoured that, hehe. The bread was wonderful too. 

For our main dishes he had the chicken parmigiana with the spaghetti. It was a good sized portion, if I would've known better I would have just shared with him! You could really taste the tomatoes in the sauce. I had a lemon dish with chicken, I forget the name. Sorry! I won't lie though it was a little too lemony for me, and I am a big lemon fan. So rethink that dish if you don't want to be overwhelmed by lemon.

Hi there! I only have two photos of two different pasta plates due to my other friends devouring it before i got a chance to capture an image of the pasta. Many things i want to say about the 5 different pasta dishes. I am a pasta man.

5 types of pasta dishes we had: 
- Chicken Parmesan 
Breaded chicken breast in our traditional San Marzano pomodoro sauce and melted mozzarella, served with spaghetti

- Chicken Francese
Fresh chicken breast sautéed in lemon-white wine sauce and a touch of butter, served with spaghetti

- Linguine Bolognese
Slow simmered ground filet mignon in San Marzano pomodoro sauce, fresh herbs, spices, and Parmigiano Reggiano

- Spaghetti Carbonara
Spaghetti pasta, imported pancetta, egg yolks, and Parmigiano Reggiano are combined to create this classic Italian specialty

- Spaghetti & Meatballs
Housemade filet mignon and pork loin meatballs with our classic San Marzano pomodoro sauce, olive oil and spices

All descriptions are from the real menu itself.



1. Texture of pasta and meat itself:
Pasta was cooked nicely. Softer than Al dente. I'm sure the chef would be able to boiled the pasta to give it a chewier texture if asked. So if you enjoy soft pasta, but not too soft, then you'd like their pasta.

Chicken wasn't dry and had a very nice texture! Any beef plates, such as ground filet mignon sauce in bolognese, and meat sauce in spaghetti had plenty of flavor!

The Carbonara is your typical pancetta, egg, and parmesan mixture. Initially, the plate is bland itself because of how easily the pancetta can make it salty and I felt like an addition of salt was needed but overall, it was a good dish.

Only reason why i didn't give the place a 5 star was because of the amount of lemon was added to the chicken francese. Though reading the menu, i knew the dish was going to be a semi-sour dish, but lemon-wine was also added to the spaghetti making the dish dominantly sour. Don't get me wrong, the chicken was cooked perfectly, i preferred this chicken itself have the taste and maybe the spaghetti should become less sour and more sweet. Maybe add a sauce that would dress the spaghetti and not drench it? My personal opinion of course. I personally had the linguine bolognese, and although i very much enjoyed the dish, i felt like it was drenched in oil. The oils that came from the grounded filet sauce. Near the end i had to take the meat out from its original plate to finish it off because it was very oily.

Overall, i would definitely recommend and would go out of my way to eat here. But not often because it's fairly pricy 

Rating 4.2/5

My third picture is the cost of all the plates. You can assume that the pasta dishes are around ~20$
Trattoria also serves other entrees that vary around 25-35$


Tips: GREAT TASTING GARLIC KNOTS AS FREE STARTERS! (Only first order is free) Plates look small in picture, but are big in person. Don't let it deceive you! We order an extra pizza and didn't even get to it!

We ordered the stuffed baked clams app. Was a daily special at the time they clams where so small and filled with breading there was not any clam at all. We then ordered pasta both our pasta dishes were undercooked. We took one bite of each and could not finish it. Then the waiter came and when we told him they were undercooked he almost laughed and it knew it was going to be. We then asked for the bill. We ended up paying 24 bucks for 8 tiny tiny clams and 2 pops. Never eat here. if you can't cook pasta don't call your self an Italian place. Wouldn't even go back for the bread total rip and I warn you stay away.,125UF25ph1xdlmqy-Tlfgw,1,0,1,q41aJoAhhVo4JHWYz46ffQ

2920083,2014-04-19,2,qFAw6wHMMcr4ctF-ZdGhEA,"Let me begin with this: I spent 4 months studying abroad in Florence, Italy. I am extremely picky when it comes to eating at Italian restaurants, and I am highly critical when reviewing said restaurants. 

Upon arriving, we were promptly seated and pleasantly greeted by our server. The service reminded me of what they offered back in Italia with the tables being out within the walkway of the Venetian itself. The tables were already set up with flowers,placemats, and silverware ready to go. I must say the environment and ambiance seemed to quite right to me. 

After being seated, we were brought garlic bread that tasted pretty awesome. I ordered the chicken parmesan while my boyfriend went for the slightly more fattening veal parmasean. We opted out of ordering alcohol- they had a fairly extensive list that consisted of both domestic and imported choices- so that we could allocate our funds to dessert instead. 

Our food came and was absolutely delicious. It wasn't dry but both our meats were tender and juicy. We had pasta and pasta sauce on the side, both of which did not overpower the veal and chicken. The sauce atop our meats too wasn't too much- just the perfect amount, along with the cheesy mozzarella slice.

We had to box the remainder of our meals, and order our cannoli to go, because we were stuffed to the brim. It's a good option though so you can return to your room, let your food settle, and enjoy a nice, romantic dessert later.

I would recommend this place if you are in the area. Sure, it's a little pricey, but it is well worth it. Great meals in Italy are not cheap; the same rule applies for the states. You won't be disappointed!",-0hfJIT3R7Dyfa9OzjokyA,2,1,5,0yUYMcgBRpBz338AHWhWjw

Read reviews about the filet mignon meatballs being the yummiest and juciest. So, of course I HAD to try 'em for myself as an app. Goodness, boy, do I ever agree. You could just eat the serving which comes with three meatballs and share an entree because these bad boys do their justice as a mini meal. The chef and owners of Trattoria Reggiano are not shy about their food. Oh, plus you are treated to homemade, soft garlic rolls as a starter. Mmmm.

A quaint and intimate restaurant, half the dining area is inside the tiny restaurant and half is out in front, what would typically be equated to the ""sidewalk"". I ate with my family in this latter area which I preferred because the inside seems a little tight. 

Ok, on to the oh-so-tasty and al dente pasta entrees we all had. My linguini with clams in white sauce was so light and perfectly seasoned, and came with BIG, fresh clams! Family had the linguini carbonara and shrimp scampi. Sauteed in a buttered, olive oil sauce, the shrimp in the scampi was again, not a greedy amount. They were huge and fresh and not overdone.  The applewood smoked bacon pieces in the bolognese sauce for the carbonara really takes this dish to another level.

Service got better as the nice progressed but I can say see how others thought there was crankiness goin on. It's a tiny place and 2 waiters are pretty much doing everything. So, for that, couldn't give it a full 5 stars. But, i'd have to say that our waiter did warm up and took good care of us!! Highly recommend it!!",NH1KIDhyC_mXdsClSjOmKw,2,2,4,eTo3-qwDUXJ_Lrr9BTi6tw

Loving Italian food and all things pasta, I couldn't wait to be seated at this place.  We chose to sit in the not-so-outdoor dining area to people watch and enjoy the 'view'.  

When our server came along he seemed to be nice enough as he took our drink orders first.  While waiting for him to come back to take our actual food orders another duo came and sat in the next table beside us.  He proceeded to take their drink orders and walked past our table even when we tried to flag him down.

Finally giving up I decide to use the restroom while I tell my friend to order for me in case that husky slob of a waiter finally decides to come to our table.   

When I get back surprisingly my friend has ordered for the both of us and even has his coke he ordered, however my glass of water is no where to be seen.  The other table who came in and ordered after us has both of their drink orders as well as some bread on the table.  20 minutes have passed and we only have one drink and no bread.   We wait another 10 minutes and I still don't have my damn water or any bread and by that time I'm starving.  While during the whole time our incompetent server is leaning at the bar chatting away.  

Who the fuck hired this fool?

3081654,2013-05-28,0,qFAw6wHMMcr4ctF-ZdGhEA,"In the meandering maze of mercantilism that is the shops and restaurants and kiosks of the Venetian's Grand Canal is hidden a very nice Italian gem.  Although not easy to find, once there you will find a very cute, mom and pop vibe eatery with tables extending out into the walking area.  Depending on the time of year and body mass index of those strolling the shops, this can be good people watching or good impetus to cut down on portions eaten.  We arrived and were immediately seated by a quiet, older gentleman with what seemed to be an old world accent.  The orders, food, and flow continued seamlessly sand resulted in a very satisfying dining experience.

The Good: Cute atmosphere.  If you prefer not to be on display in the walkway while you eat, sit inside and enjoy a cute kind of deli feel. The bread they bring with the meal tasted fresh, hot, and garlicky/buttery like good bread should.  Our waiter was very kind about accommodating our individual requests (""no ma'am I'm afraid the kitchen does not have any fettucine pasta today, but the tortellini is excellent with the alfredo sauce"" and ""I'm sure we can substitute the puttanesca sauce with your Chicken Parmesan""), and his helper kept our drinks filled. Everything flowed nicely from start to finish.  The tortellinni alfredo was good as advertised.  They used the large pillow style pasta that I normally associate with ravioli, but they were cooked perfectly.  The sauce relied heavily on butter for it's flavor, but then it's alfredo.  If you want diet food, order sliced fruit. My Chicken Parm had nice flavor and the breading was not as thick and KFC-like as I have had at many spots recently (although sometimes that heavy fried/batter thing can be a guilty pleasure.) They were nice enough to make my side of spaghetti with the puttanesca sauce instead of the normal pomodoro which makes me a fan from jump.  I'm going to give the puttanesca a 7/10 just because I like a little stronger garlic flavor and more fresh basil ribbons, but that is just my quirkiness.  Did I mention the great bread?

The Bad: Nothing.

The Mediocre:  Getting to the bathrooms to wash your hands before the meal requires navigating about 4 right turns and not missing the passage off top the side, but then that was my experience of the whole Venetian Grand Canal Shopping area itself. 

Overall:  Nice Italian food, in a difficult to find location, but still well worth the effort.",m_7E3dV1W79Cj7WvMUpSbg,0,1,4,8yoV1bfJQMvLHe8htxKIQA

We got the arugula salad which was very fresh and simple, the pasta e fagioli soup which was very light and scrumptious.  All the food seemed to have been made very authentically. My sister had the swordfish, my mom- the linguine bolognese, and I- the spaghetti alili e olio.  Everything was really good. The best thing about this place was our server- an older Italian man who was so accomodating. We wanted wines by the glass that were not on the ""wine by the glass  list"" and he said, you can do whatever you want. I thought that was really nice of him.

3183040,2015-12-25,5,qFAw6wHMMcr4ctF-ZdGhEA,"Do not come here unless you want to be intimidated and made to feel stupid. 

I give this establishment 0 stars but Yelp won't allow me to give less than 1 star.

I came here tonight (December 24) for our first meal with my mother after we arrived in Vegas. I found a killer vacation deal over the Xmas holiday and thought why not do something different this year. Anyways,  I found this restaurant on Yelp (like most restaurants I visit while out of town). It had great reviews and I was also very excited to try the buttery buns Yelpers raved about.

My experience here was terrible. I have never felt so unwelcomed and ridiculed. The buttery buns arrived at our table with a bottle of balsamic vinegar and olive oil. I asked our middle aged Italian server if I could have another plate to pour the EVOO and vinegar in. He flat out told me ""this is not how we eat our bread. Use the same plate you have"". I was completely floored and just looked at him. I guess he realized that wasn't a good answer. He then grabbed a side plate from the empty table near me and pretty much threw it on the table. The underlying tone of his comment was condescending and made me feel like the way I like to eat my bread was completely irrational. I should have asked him who this ""we"" is. I didn't know a oil and vinegar police existed.

Our server then ignored us while being attentative to all neighboring patrons. I was quite peeved and blurted out loudly- ""the service here is TERRRIBLE"" so that all my neighboring patrons could hear me and also conveniently while he was serving them. This quickly changed how he treated us. He quickly came over and asked me how the pizza was. I said ""it's OK"", then he has the audacity to say ""it's ONLY OK?"". There was no underlying joke behind his comment. I just ignored his comment and he left. 

We quickly finished our meal and asked our busser to send the bill. I paid, leaving a 5% tip (the bussers shouldn't be punished, even though they only get a small cut of the tip). 

On my way out I flagged down the manager, a middle aged Italian woman, and told her the situation. The first thing she says is ""what do you want from this?"", as thought she thought I was expecting a comped meal. I said ""nothing, I already paid and am not happy with the service"". She then defended our server saying that he is very good and that I misinterpreted him and that he was probably joking. I was thinking in my head what a joke THIS IS. No wonder service is so bad when management can't set an example of basic customer service and makes the customer feel stupid. I told the manager we are leaving since this was hopeless. The manager then clues in and says ""let's discuss this with the server and have him apologize to you."" I declined and she told me to come back tomorrow and she will make sure we ""get served right"". No thank you and we walked away. 

Do yourself a favor and don't eat here.  There are plenty of other delicious Italian choices on the strip which provide excellent or even decent service and good food.",3uLHp-m1xvOE_eZehqlmXQ,20,2,1,WxaKeIfl5ZJkJijjfd09hw

Take the escalator in the Palazzo forum, above the waterfall, and it's not hard to find, but it's a small restaurant. Even though they have additional seating out in the corridor/walkway, you're there for the food. If you come during rush hour for dinner, be prepared to wait depending on how large your party is. We had 6 and it took us about 45 min - 1 hr. Wait was totally worth it for the following reasons:

1) They serve hot fresh bread, garlic olive oil bread with option of dipping in balsamic  vinegar and olive oil

2) The portions are filling and very affordable for Las Vegas prices - $16 - $30ish for entrees (I recommend the pasta)

3) Service is attentive and they speak Italian (great sign for an Italian restaurant)

Cavatelli is my favorite pasta and it's something that you may have a hard time finding on menus. They also bring you complementary garlic knots.

AMBIENCE:
The Venetian was my home away from home for the weekend last month when I was in Vegas, so it was in a convenient location.  Walking past the place, it looks like a small, quaint little restaurant, but inviting at the same time with the warm lighting.  There are also tables that sort of stretch out of the restaurant, so people walking by can get a good look of what people are eating and the diners are able to people watch.  It was a little bit awkward waiting for a table because there really isn't any designated ""waiting area"".  Standing too close made me feel like a stalker and standing too far keeping watch on whether my name would be called also made me feel like a stalker.  Recommendation - get there early to avoid the awkward wait.

FOOD QUALITY:
First thing we got on the table was garlic bread.  From my previous posts, you'll know that I love carbs/bread with a passion.  I was sorely disappointed when I took my first bite out of the garlic bread.  I was expecting warm, delicious bread - what I got was cold, oily bread.  Gross.  
I thought maybe it was just an off day with the bread, but the bad didn't stop there.  If the pasta sauce that I buy at the grocery store tastes better than Trattoria, then you know there is a serious lack of skill in the way they cook pasta here.  This is especially disappointing considering it specializes in pasta and Italian food.  My group and I all ordered pasta and ALL of our pastas were undercooked.  Andrew D. ordered spaghetti and meatballs and the meatballs were a little bit cold? - How does that even happen??  All of our dishes were not hot.  All of us didn't want to finish our dishes, but we also didn't want to just throw away $20 per person for our dishes right down the drain.  So, we all just sucked it up and ate our subpar pasta.

SERVICE:
Service was poor.  The hostess seemed a little spacey.  The waiter also took forever getting to our table to take down waters and when he dropped off our food, he was basically MIA for the rest of the time.  I had to wave down the hostess after she was done zoning out to bring us our check since our waiter went MIA on us.

The service and food are really great, if on the pricey side. The garlic bread they give you to start is fantastic, but the pasta was not to be outdone. I got the chicken marsala, which came with spaghetti, and I licked the plate clean of that good good sauce. Lots of mushrooms and shallots make the dish really flavorful!

3408601,2008-09-01,0,qFAw6wHMMcr4ctF-ZdGhEA,"We loved this restaurant.  

Sometimes what you really want is a good meal that, while decadent, has a home-made comfortable feel.  Add to the experience an intimate atmosphere (yes, it is possible to find intimate atmosphere somewhere in a hotel restaurant on the strip), a personable chef and staff, and a sense of authenticity (not post-modern authenticity, but the actual authentic kind).  We go to Vegas to do two things:  play poker and eat.  And we pack a lot of both into each trip.  It's safe to say that for all of our eating in Vegas, Trattoria Reggiano has no rival.

When you go, it might be tough to find in the maze that is the Venetian.  Head for the food court in the canal shops.  It's a few doors down from the food court seating area, but don't let that fool you.  Fake al fresco is fine, but for a nice quiet meal, see if there's a table inside.

Another online review that says it all, by ""pepprdine"" on yellowbot.com:
""The Best of las Vegas.  Trattoria Reggiano is one of those street side cafes that you think of when you are strolling down the streets in Italy. Instead of traveling to Europe you can now just visit the Venetian to find this outstanding restaurant. Excellent service, original menu and true Italian owners who care about their heritage are just a few of the reasons you should visit. Acclaimed Chef Jack Borruso is there most days and nights ensuring that every diner is satisfied. If you end oup visiting the restaurant you need to sit down with Chef Borruso and let him tell you some of his stories about cooking in Italy. You can sit there for hours listening.  You can go to those other ""trendy"" restaurants in Las Vegas and take out a second mortgage on your house to pay the bill and you might be satisfied or you can go to Trattoria Reggiano and get a taste of what a true Italian Trattoria conveys; chbefs visiting your table, authentic Italian Cuisine, smaill, intimate atmosphere and a menu that is better than most high end Italian eateries in Vegas without charging you so much that it would be cheaper to fly to Italy and dine in Rome. This is a must visit when you are in Las Vegas. """,tYXmFkgbuUqtndYO48YHQA,0,0,5,Vq7r25g6xL4Eakzaqft2Ag

3438042,2012-04-29,0,qFAw6wHMMcr4ctF-ZdGhEA,"My girlfriend and I were seeing the Blue man group and needed a place to dine before the show. We were in the mood for Italian and happened to stumble upon this little joint. It's rather peculiarly located-- as though it's purpose as a restaurant was an afterthought in the tiny enclave's design. It almost feels like a genuine old fashioned mom and pop-- if it weren't located in a major strip resort. It's a quaint and intimate little dining experience with all the decorations you need for a casual italian dinner.

Aesthetics aside, let me simply say that I give this place my stamp of approval. The bread is tasty, and the food arrived fairly promptly. Our waiter seemed to be an authentic Italian immigrant who had an excellent knowledge of the menu and provided valuable dining advice. My girlfriend went for the tortellini and I settled for the swordfish piccatta. The food arrived promptly and did NOT disappoint. The swordfish was succulent and the seasoning was just right-- so as not to overpower the flavor of the fish. Delicate capers draped over the fish helped me finish my portion in no time. I tried some of my girlfriends dish as well and was pleased to find that the alfredo sauce was rich and well crafted. The portions are just right to fill an average appetite and you probably won't have leftovers. For the price I paid I was quite satisfied with the quality of the food and would recommend it to anyone in the area.",U4ERp63gvcIeOis8UdtxvA,1,0,4,B290aJoSa4al0uADGC05XQ

I'm thinking well is there some kind of compensation, and are they CPR certified here, what if someone chokes, there's no warning written or verbally about eating the ravioli. Smh, anyway the lobster ravioli was the best tasting out of everything we had from here. The chicken Caesar salad was ok, the chicken had a VERY grilled smell to it, very strong, not sure why, but the chicken was also a tad bit dry. The cheese on it was yummy though, and I expected to see a smaller salad but it was meal sized. The caprese salad was just ok , the cheese was fresh and moist,the tomato was ripe,but I added a little balsamic vinegar to up the flavor . The shrimp linguini was not too bad, not as much sauce as I expected and a smaller plate than I expected but I was still satisfied and got full.

3481733,2012-03-10,0,qFAw6wHMMcr4ctF-ZdGhEA,"If you've never been here before, be prepared to take an extra 15 minutes to find this place because of how huge the Venetian is. This restaurant is in an indoor mall within the Venetian. Though it's indoors with a controlled climate, most of the seating is still ""outside"" of the restaurant on the patio, so you might have a bunch of random people and kids and strollers walk right past your table. If you don't mind that, the food is great and the staff is kind and attentive.

I went with my friend and her mom, dad, brother, sister, sister's husband and their baby girl. The menu is big but not too large, but big enough to make it hard to decide because at least two things sound awfully good. I teetered between gnocchi in pesto cream sauce and lobster ravioli. I absolutely love ravioli and thick, chewy pastas. I went with the lobster ravioli. The texture of the ravioli pasta was just right, and the filling was a mixture of cheese and lobster. I forget what was in the pink sauce, it was tomato and a bit creamy or buttery and I think they put some shrimp on it as well. My friend enjoyed her very cheesy rigatoni, her sister's gnocchi in pesto looked amazing and I wished I had ordered it, her husband got the same thing I did and ate it all up, her mother I think got the eggplant parmesan but don't quote me on that... I believe it was gooey and flavorful and cooked to her liking. My friend's brother ordered the spaghetti and meatballs and of course that was done very well with al dente pasta and a good sauce. The meatballs are very large and a bit more delicate than they seem from looking at them. I accidentally dropped half a meatball someone had ordered on the side into my water glass due to underestimating the strength of the meatball in relation to my fork. The waiter smiled and just brought out another big meatball in sauce free of charge. I believe everyone was satisfied with their meal. I I didn't end up finishing my ravioli however, but it's my fault because I ordered something too fishy for my tastes. On occasion a bite of the lobster ravioli was too strong and lobstery for me. Don't ask me why, I'm picky and mild with my seafood flavors. The shrimp were fine. Ultimately I had hoped they had my favorite on the menu, mushroom ravioli. I order those everywhere I see them, they always have such a rich nutty taste and they mix so well with cheese and make a great filling! I think that's the reason I ordered the lobster ravioli... I really craved mushroom ravioli. Anyway, I think I should have gotten the pesto gnocchi, that looked INCREDIBLE! I bet it was. If I ever go back I'll try that.",XIZI_eL80szGDzyZgV3lLA,0,0,4,udCem-f70WmBu4smJIvRMw

3578421,2012-03-24,0,qFAw6wHMMcr4ctF-ZdGhEA,"I was visiting Vegas to ring in the New Year and we wanted to get some dinner. My parents decided to let my brother choose the food that night and he wanted to eat Italian. After looking up some places, he chose this one, and I am extremely thankful that he did.

Looking at the menu, I immediately freaked out because of the pricing (double what I usually pay for). However, I decided to roll with it, as we don't splurge that often, and it was Vegas, after all.

What we ordered:

Starters: Filet Mignon Meatballs ($12): These were absolutely amazing! It comes with three plump meatballs, much bigger than we were expecting, with a delicious tomato-y pomodoro sauce and some spaghetti. We wished we ordered it from the Pasta menu, but maybe next time?

Pasta Specialties: Gnocchi al Pesto ($18): Soft ricotta dumplings with a creamy pesto sauce in a large plate that I simply could not finish! These are a meal on their own, and in my case I had leftovers. These cheesy dumplings should not be underestimated, as they do fill you up!

Individual Brick Oven Pizza: Primavera ($16): A light vegetarian pizza loaded with flavors. I have had a pizza with similar toppings, and that pizza absolutely pales in comparison. This pizza was not very greasy and seemed to be quite authentic.

Drinks: Cappuccino ($6.5): The most expensive cappuccino I have ever had, but one that I will never regret ordering. After having that cappuccino, I have craved it many times over. The drink comes in a small cup with a small piece of biscotti on the side and a small stick of rock sugar. It was the perfect cup of cappuccino in my opinion.

My family (4 including me) shared these dishes and we had leftover pizza and gnocchi, which we (I) later on devoured at our hotel room. The service was great, with our server giving us time to eat and periodically refilling our water glasses. I was surprised that he didn't come by to check on our food as often as people usually do, but it was a nice change, and I'm guessing more authentically Italian?

Those are not on the menu and they did not hesitate to change things up for us. The food was amazing. The pesto tasted absolutely homemade. The shrimps were fresh and the marinara sauce tasted authentic. Finally, the whole wheat pasta was cooked perfectly. It was not hard and it did not make me wish I ordered white pasta.

Tucked away and tightly run, this restaurant understands how to move people right through their meal, which I think is great. I was coming off a cold and wanted nothing more than the homecooked feel of spaghetti and meatballs, which I had with the house chianti and the famous house garlic knots. 

Best spaghetti and meatballs ever. The sauce was impeccable, balanced but distinct flavor, and light enough not to stop your stomach a few bites in. Pasta was just as perfect - you know you've had a good meal when you remember how much you enjoyed the experience of simply eating it. I'm not usually capable of putting a lot away, but I finished the entire plate, and got a congratulatory, ""Good job, boss"" from my cameriere. Much better than the chiding he gave the Italian sitting next to me, who was apparently letting his pizza get too cold while texting.

The bill was on my table in a flash, the real boss told a waiting guest ""This table will be ready in 30 seconds,"" and I was on my way. Grazie!",J8_KEdgc9_k9PCLia16DlA,1,1,5,L2sz9pBxwPNXI5PuAiRlWQ

Why not 5 stars? The seating, although cute, is kind of invasive and too close for comfort.  We were seated next to a couple that was arguing ""quietly"" and I heard everything...awkward. Also, what's up with these bottled soft drinks? Major AUGH for no refills.

The service was pretty great! Servers were attentive and friendly.  How could they maneuver amongst such a small space?! 

I ordered the Shrimp Scampi with a side of Grilled Chicken Breast. I LOVE that you can add chicken breast to ANY menu item! More protein to counteract the pasta carbs, please!

My food was so damn delicious! Sorry for the damn, but damn! The pasta was so al dente and flavorful! The shrimp was BAM! And the chicken was DOUBLE BAM!

My boyfriend had the Chicken Marsala and he liked it a lot! No, he did not love it but at Regianno's defense, Marsala isn't that flavorful in any place and my bf was kinda drunk lol

Oh boy am I glad we did. The food was phenomenal, it was probably one of the best meals I had during the trips. Even better than those steakhouses that we spent $75 for a piece of steak. 

Garlic rolls: Hot, soft and garlicy, it was pretty amazing. It was so hard not wanting to eat it all but I had to control myself since I wanted to save room in my stomach for the other dishes

Meat and cheese platter: Huge platter! So much meat and cheese!  We shared it between three people and still had a lot of left overs

Linguine with clam in white sauce: Typically I am not a white sauce kind of person but this pasta dish was too good not eat. The sauce was light and the clams were fresh. They were really generous with the clams too. I totally recommend this!

Veal parmigiana: My coworker ordered this dish and she kept raving how tender and delicious it was.

Calamari: Fried to perfection and the portion was huge.

Lobster ravioli in a creamy tomato sauce: Sooooooooo good. There was chunks of lobsters in every bite.

Tiramisu: Hands down the BEST tiramisu I have ever had, ever. I am not a tiramisu person whatsoever but this tiramisu was beyond amazing.

Garlic Bread: I hyped this up a lot in my head, but the bread was, well, bread. Not super garlic-y as I'd hoped, but very soft for sure.
Spaghetti and Meatballs: the filet mignon meatballs were nothing special. Spaghetti sauce was a little on the sour side. Nothing out of the ordinary.

We had calamari as appetizer, we waited too long and we noticed the other table came and ordered their meal after us actually got their calamari around 10 - 15 mins earlier than us. By the time we got our calamari, it was another big disappointment, it tasted like it was sitting there for a while, it was just warm and not crispy, passes the best timing. We had pizza and pasta, the pizza also passed its best timing like our calamari, just warm....they didn't bring it to our table right after it was ready. We are pretty sure it was sitting on their kitchen counter for at least 5-10 mins. 
We kind of pointed our concerns to our waiter, we asked him why other tables came after us actually got their meals earlier than us, and he just gave us some ridiculous excuse saying it was the kitchen, he doesn't have any control of it.

3907204,2017-03-06,0,qFAw6wHMMcr4ctF-ZdGhEA,I simply love this place. Like every review you have probably read about the place don't judge it by its location. Of all the restaurants in the shoppes this one is kind of hidden away but the food and the service is terrific. It has an old Italian restaurant feel. It judging by what happened from my last visit I owe them a great review. For starters the bread rolls are excellent they give you a lot and they oil and vinegar is kept at the table so you can add more to your plate whenever you want. Like every Italian restaurant I go I got the calamari. I can tell you that it taste terrific and they give you a huge portion. I was almost full from eating the appetizer with my wife. I got the Italian sangria to drink a very different but welcomed taste from other dark sangrias I'm used to. For dinner I had a Frutti Di Mare here they use bucatini noodles instead of the thinner linguini most restaurants do. It was excellent and is loaded with clams and mussels. Now to my wife's meal she had a moscato to drink and ordered something off menu a swordfish in piccata sauce. My wife doesn't like seafood at all but wanted something different. Of course she didn't like it but I had to do my due diligence and taste it and as far as fish dishes go I thought it was delicious the swordfish really sucks up all the piccata sauce making it very flavorful. My wife stated that she did not care for the meal and the excellent waiter ( what's up Victor) replaced it with a filet mignon which was cooked to perfection with potatoes and veggies in a pool of a sauce I can't describe but it was amazing.

3970915,2015-03-27,1,qFAw6wHMMcr4ctF-ZdGhEA,"Before a show at the Palazzo, I came here for dinner.  First impressions were not that good as there was no one at the podium.  A waiter came up to me, didn't say anything, and then turned and left.  Another waiter came over and showed me to a table on their ""patio"" along the Grand Canal Shops at the Venetian.  The tables are very close together in this area and as has been stated in other reviews, this is a high traffic area.  I tend to like people watching so I didn't mind the traffic.  It would have been nice if I didn't have to pretend not to hear the conversation of the two women at the table an arm's length from me.

I was brought a menu and asked about drinks.  Soon a server came with three cheese and garlic rolls and some balsamic and EVOO which he left on the table.  My iced tea was brought and I ordered.  Asking the server what was the smallest appetizer, he suggested the caprese.  I ordered the caprese and the pesto gnocchi.  

The caprese was OK.  The tomatoes were hot house tomatoes and not very flavorful and a bit hard.  The burrata was quite good.  The pouch of cheese pulled apart and I could place it on the tomato slices.  My server had done some freshly grated pepper on the caprese and that helped.  The best appetizer would have been simply the cheese with some bread and EVOO and let the tomatoes die on the hothouse floor.

The pesto gnocchi was pretty standard.  There wasn't a strong pesto flavor, but the gnocchi were soft and tasty.

After dinner, the server brought me a tray of dessert replicas and I chose the tiramisu.  It's done in a manner you don't see very often.  Instead of a cake like dessert, this version is mostly cream with lots of chocolate powder and some pieces of cake and chocolate near the bottom of the cream.  This was the best part of the meal.  The cream was perfect.  My only complaint is the dessert was served in a fluted goblet, but in the manner of drizzling syrups and sauces over dishes for looks, the plate on which the goblet rested was lined with caramel sauce and confectioners' sugar.  Why decorate a plate on which there's no food?  In fact, I got part of my hand on the caramel and I needed to find a washroom after I left to wash it all off.

And I can proudly say we tip very well. Our total came out to be $52.50 and I have gave the waitress $62.50 making this $10 back in cash. We waited 5 minutes while he continuously passed by our table taking care of the other customers, mind you this place was not busy at all. Finally my boyfriend spoke up to another person asking for our receipt,  and our change. A few minutes go by and our waiter comes back to our table with a crumpled up receipt. His response was "" I always throw away the receipts, here you go"" and I quickly respond, ""What about my change?"" He hesitated and mumbled upon words and began to explain of how he was confused that I have give him $62.50. And I responded once again ""To get  $10 back"" he then REACHES into his OWN pocket and pulls out HIS tip money and gives me MY $10. I took that money got up and gave it to the busser who actually helped us. I'm sorry but last time I heard it's an option to tip and not a requirement. He didn't give me the option, he just jumped right into it.

The setting is like a small street side restaurant in Italy.  The staff look like they are all family.  The meal starts with warm bread and olive and balsamic vinegar for dipping.  The lasagna and penne vodka were delivered very quickly and more then met our expectation.  The lasagna was loaded with cheese and meat.  the pasta was al dente like you would find in Italy.  The only downside to the experience is the view which looks out across to a fast food lobster restaurant and being a small restaurant  you hear conversations from nearby loud tables.

We stumbled across it on our way to find the passage to the Palazzo, in which we were staying, but I don't think that we would have discovered it otherwise. There is a limited amount of ""indoor"" and ""outdoor"" seating available, in quotations because the entire thing---which is basically doused with that charming mom-and-pop vibe---is inside a hotel, all decorated with a retro-Italian theme.

I ordered the Penne Primavera, a veggie-full dish with no sauce but just a dash of garlic for taste. It came fairly quickly, which was a relief because we were so hungry, but they also give you unlimited baskets of bread to eat with olive oil and vinegar. The Penne ended up being the slighlty-bland you would expect from something so healthy, but as I am trying to eat clean I decided it was a good choice and jealously eyed my friends' spaghetti and meatballs and Linguini Bolognese. I only had a taste of each, but I can attest that Trattoria sauce is exceptional. The meat is tender and perfectly complements the pasta.

Hubby ordered calamari- for $15, the portions were HUGE, and he said they were cooked perfectly! I got the marinated balsamic basil chicken salad for $16, which was one of the only gluten free items on the menu. It was delicious! The olive oil is some of the best I've ever had, and I couldn't stop pouring it on everything. The rolls that come out gratis are hot and melt-in-your-mouth delicious. Hubby also got a moretti beer- his favorite!

Amanda our server was so sweet and accommodating. I really appreciate how knowledgeable she was about the menu, especially with my severe gluten allergy. She made sure I knew exactly what was safe to eat, and what wasn't. I truly appreciated her concern. 

Unfortunately, the other waiter working the lunch shift yesterday, a tall thin man with spiky hair, was so rude to everyone, yelling at his tables and then yelling right next to our table when the hostess seated a couple in his station, screaming that he couldn't handle any more tables and that someone needed to help him! It was so sad! I'm so glad we had Amanda as our server and not him; he would have ruined our meal. 

The espresso is illy but it's watery and not worth the $4.50 price point. It does come with a mini cantucci though. 

The other disappointing thing about the restaurant was the horrifically rude floor manager/hostess, in a brown striped top with brown hair. She yelled at us when we asked about gluten free options before sitting down, as if she couldn't even waste her time talking to us, and told us to leave- thankfully Amanda saved us and said that yes there were gluten free options, albeit few, and that she'd be more than happy to help us.",JgOsI4hTFBiT-_ROgb1kqg,3,0,4,sluZTTeCfoiDTQFYsdL6uQ

Food was served very promptly as it should be for pastas. The presentation did have anything special but the food smelled delicious. I didnt add shrimp to my aglio e olio this time because my sister is allergic to shrimp, but you can also add some for 6 dollars, and their shrimps are always cooked very nicely. We wanted gnocci but they were out of pesto sauce, so we didnt, but I would definitely try it next time. Linguine was tasty as well, the clams were cooked right and there was enough juice on the dish that the linguine was moist until we were done eating.

When I walked in, I was immediately seated and served some fantastic bread! I placed my order and started a glass of wine. Before I could even finish my first piece of bread, my spaghetti and meatballs were already brought to the table! The service in this place was great!

My food was fantastic (apparently, previous posters weren't joking about the filet mignon meatballs)!  My check was a total of $27--not too bad at all, especially in comparison to the other Italian spots that are found all over the area.

All in all, it was a great experience. Also, this place is legit--the servers were all speaking to each other in Italian--I loved it! I definitely recommed paying Trattoria Reggiano a visit!",50Kz9-sXq0wwE_Kg9w_HJg,2,0,4,tRRdJPVbIydskWSGdetmUg

We headed to the Venetian since she knew some good places there. Unfortunately all of the places she wanted to go to had long waits and we just wanted someplace to sit down and eat good fun. We were almost ready to eat at the food court when we saw this small italian cafe right next to the coffee bean. I looked at the menu and the prices were perfect, with everything under 15 dollars, best of all, no wait and we were seated immediately. Instantly garlic bread balls were brought out and they were amazing. The service was incredible, it felt like we were in someones home even though we were a few feet from the food court. We split a caeser with nice big chunks of italian cheeses along with a simple pasta and it was the perfect meal.

4262639,2014-03-27,1,qFAw6wHMMcr4ctF-ZdGhEA,"1) Most importantly, food was an A. Pesto gnocchi was flavorful, texture was perfect. Then again, it would be hard to mess gnocchi's texture up, wouldn't it? Lobster ravioli too was full of flavor, came out pleasantly warm and both dishes were good portion sizes. As were the filet mignon meatballs, which make quite the appetizer (if you are considering ordering them, just do it). Wine prices by the glass and bottle were typical. Garlic knots were a little too reminiscent of a local pizza parlor's, but I'll take it. A little dressing of balsamic vinegar and Olive oil will do the trick. 
2) Secondly, service was a B. Our server was very friendly, but simply put, we just didn't see enough of him. Of course we want to enjoy our meal privately, but more intimate interaction would have warranted two thumbs up instead of one.
3) Atmosphere was a B-. If you're sitting inside I imagine it's a little more cozy than the outside tables that are uncomfortably close to the passing Venetian guests walking by eyeballing your entrees. I hope your dining guest is easy on the eyes, for he/she will really be all there is to look at during your meal.",pgMxiwSL7Hhz98jxCkYqHA,3,1,4,CAqoReUfmGzDk_OG1bxmJQ

4291711,2012-07-13,1,qFAw6wHMMcr4ctF-ZdGhEA,"Went there for an early lunch to avoid the crowds during peak mealtimes.   Not a bad idea since the restaurant is on the small side and they do not appear to take reservations.  

After reading all the rave reviews about the meatballs, well of course I had to get them as an appy!  The server was kind enough to offer the option of cutting down the standard order down to only one or two meatballs from the usual three, so that I can enjoy the entree that I really wanted without killing myself ; ). 

People weren't kidding about the meatballs -- they were great for sure, but in my opinion,Trattoria Reggiano truly shines with their killer bolognese, bar-none.  

For the main, I decided on their daily special, which happened to be mushroom ravioli bolognese.  Boy was I ever in for a spectacular treat!!!  It will definitely be difficult to go back to the usual pink slime bolognese that the average restaurant serves, where the ground ""meat"" simply melts into the sauce for the most part.

Not only were the al dente ravioli large enough to be nicely stuffed with that aromatic mushroom/ricotta/goat cheese mixture, the generously portioned pillows of pasta were heavily blanketed by the other star of the dish: an uber thick and hearty meat sauce made with nothing other than abundant chunks of  high quality ground filet mignon.    Each bite was full of lean, solid meat and juicy tomato chunks.   Insane depth of flavours and textures....best pasta I've had to date, short of traveling to Italy.  

The bill came to $34 but there was enough left over to cover dinner.  There was no microwave in the hotel room to heat it up but that did not diminish the food's taste by much. Still thoroughly enjoyed it unheated as much as I did at the restaurant.

We wanted to sit inside because it looked cozier than the tables in the middle of the walkway, but we were told actually they were starting to clean up in there so we would have to sit outside. No problem!

However, we felt immediately like the few waitstaff were visibly upset we had been seated, particularly our waiter. He looked tired, and annoyed he had a table. So much so we literally asked him 3-4 times if it was really OK that we were sitting down to eat. He assured us it was OK if we put the order in quickly. 

Overall, they pushed the food out quickly, and we all enjoyed our pizza/pasta. For the price, this place is quite the deal on the strip. You get a lot, it's in a nice indoor location, and the food was very good. If this was a normal restaurant I would give it 3 stars (entirely because of the feeling like we were a burden, the food was great), but the value vs others around make it a 4 for me.",x-W0OQiUdNLsoMhg6GfXSg,3,1,4,FLkDuoIZD1uHqBqzE5tcBA

Each time I visit Las Vegas I make it a point to eat here; although this year I was only able to make it in once.  The service is fantastic and the ambiance is certainly like visiting a small Italian restaurant in Italy.  

It is always a pleasure to see server John, whom I mostly always have wait on me, even if we have to wait for an open table in his area.  Also it was nice to see and say hello to Carl, who has also waited on me when John was off for the night.  The service was just as wonderful as always and it is so nice to have John and the other staff remembers me from year to year. 

The new manager, Flavia, who has been there about 1 year, replaced the previous manager, Stephano, who went to one of the family's other restaurants.  Flavia was a just a pleasure to talk with and I enjoyed her.  I look forward to seeing her and the rest of the staff on my next trip.

Arugula and Cherry Tomato Salad and Spaghetti Puttanesca.  Great salad and fantastic Spaghetti.  Be sure to stop by and have some garlic pizza dough rolls slathered with olive oil once you sit down.",-s3ATMWSYnjM2gIwXYkY1w,2,1,5,JiuILr-1e12rhkNJgBvkaA

My wife and I were in Vegas looking for good Italian food. We searched Yelp and other resources and decided we wanted to try this restaurant. 

Our journey: this is not the restaurants fault, but worth noting. Not knowing how to get to this establishment we relied on the directory. BIG MISTAKE. no joke it took us 20 min to find this place. After asking, and looking at several directories ( that show ""you are here"" backwards from where you really are). At one point my wife and I were tempted to just eat any place, but it became a game to find this restaurant. Once here it was smaller than expected and kind of exposed to the mall. But we were happy to find it! 

The service was superb! Wish I remembered our waiters name. A younger Italian gentleman. Super nice, checked on us at all the right times. Overall very good service. 

Food: we both had Caesar salads that were very good. I had chicken parmesan which was great and my wife had chicken Marsala. It was honestly very good food. 

Our bill came and it was ""cheap"" for Vegas, around $80 or so. Considering we had great service and good food I put $120 bucks in the binder and we finished our drinks. Our waitress took the bill, asked if we needed change and I said no you're all set. 2 min later he walked pasted us and thanked us which was nice. As we left he made it a point to thank us again saying he really appreciated it. I wasn't looking for that, but it was very nice of him.

Our server had major attitude. Told me to ""chill out"" when I was trying to move items on the table to make room for the food, then he spilled Parmesan cheese in my drink.

We ordered the meatballs as an appetizer. This came with 3 generously sized meatballs. PACKED with flavor and high-quality filet mignon and pork loin. Delicious but a little on the salty side! The meatballs came with lots of marinara sauce, making it perfect to pair with the bread! 

For pastas, I ordered the daily special - a penne with pine nuts, spinach, sundried tomatoes, and tomato sauce. I asked for the penne to be replaced with spaghetti and they did it with a smile! This was simple, nothing spectacular, but definitely memorable because THIS WAS HUGEEEE! It came as a mountain and I was overwhelmed by how much there was.

Since I arrived into town late for a convention and wanted to grab a quick bite to eat, I was dining alone. This caused a bit of a problem because while there was a small line (maybe 10 people waiting), I did not want to take up an empty table of 4 or 6 if there were other parties behind me that would fit the table better. So I suggested to the hostess to seat the parties behind me until a smaller table opened up for me. She felt so bad that she immediately brought me a complementary glass of wine! After about 10 minutes of sipping my wine at a coffee shop across the way, she excitedly waved for me to come over. Upon seating me, she immediately poured me another glass of wine and thanked me for being so nice. THIS is the way a restaurant should treat its customers! In fact, while eating my dinner, I noticed how friendly the staff was to each other. What a great group of servers!

Now onto the food... Having been raised by an Italian mother in New York, I was cautiously optimistic about all the rave reviews. I ordered the linguine with shrimp marinara, which not only arrived piping hot...but with perfectly cooked pasta and about 20 LARGE shrimp. Now, this is how I'd normally make it for my family at home...but for a restaurant, this was outstanding! What really made the dish was the scrumptious was the pasta sauce with its chunks of garlic and fresh cut basil. Watching other dished being served, all I could think of was how fresh everything was. Sooo good! The garlic rolls that were served were the perfect accompaniment.

I was so pleased with my meal ($24) and the friendly service that I made sure to tip the waiter well and I even sneaked the hostess $10 on the way out. I felt it was the least I could do for the two free glasses of wine she served me!

What a delight this restaurant was. Small, cozy, romantic and very friendly. It reminded me of many of the small restaurants I used to visit with my family in NYC's Little Italy as a kid.

This little restaurant was tucked in behind the lobster me stand. There were about 6-8 small tables outside, and 2-3 booths inside. The ambiance was interesting, it was somewhat an authentic italian feel but was off put by the venetian traffic walking by. The staff was attentive but seemed hastened. Nevertheless they were very sweet. 

Our noms:

Complimentary Bread: Garlic knots - should have been a bit warmer. I'm a seasoning nazi and I think if they added more seasoning to the dough and added lots of garlic it would be delicious. Outside was very buttery. I took these guys home and baked them and added some garlic seasoning which made them bomb!

Starter: Fried calamari appetizer - Large portion, lightly breaded and fresh tasting. Not bad but not the best i've tried either. Marinara that came with it was warm but strange. I had to add some more s + p + crushed red. I'm starting to think I just have a salty tongue! 

Entrees: I can't help but get pasta at every italian restaurant I come across. The man got the spaghetti + filet mignon meatballs. He thought it was OK, but then again we are spoiled by Enoteca Adriano in San Diego's spaghetti and meatballs. (Best i've ever had) For filet mignon meatballs I thought they would be moist and tender, they came out a bit dry. Spaghetti was nothing special. 

My entree: linguini w/ shrimp in white sauce. This usually comes with clams but I had a bad experience with eating clams far from a coast. I loooved this. It was light and refreshing. Linguini was perfectly al dente. I finished the entire thing and even mopped up the sauce with some garlic knots. A squeeze of lemon and fresh parmesan made it even better! (refer to picture posted) 

All in all, I would come back for the linguini. 3.5! Ohh the struggle of rounding up or down for a 3.5 star place. I'm gonna have to round down because of the boyf's lackluster spaghetti and meatballs. Sorry guys!

Honorable mentions: Olive oil + balsalmic were absolutely delicious. They were obviously imported. Yum. 
Note: Pasta dishes ranged from $18-28. $18 being the most basic pastas, so I would say it is almost towards $$$.

Happy eating! xo",PyyJdP60TYF3EmcdwvpH4g,10,8,3,HQ5RnO8ieuN9n30pRMNaBA

The food:
They bring you out garlic knots, which were pretty delicious. We ordered the Spaghetti & Meatballs and Linguine Carbonara. The meatballs and sauce were tasty. The Carbonara was a little too oily and didn't actually feel or taste like a true Carbonara.

I had been debating with myself for a couple days (I am truly such a foodie) as I often do. If I'm going to spend the money I want above average food. Well I am so glad my husband and I came here while in vegas..The service was spectacular ,everyone was very accommodating and helpful,they kept drinks filled and brought extra bread and croutons without a hint of complaint or frustration..On to the location although inside the Venetian cobblestone shopping area the restaurant is open and it is in a busy area near the food court behind lobster me and so while the restaurant itself is very nice it can become an incredibly loud meal with all the bypasses( this I would say would be the only real issue.
On to the food,wow my taste buds were awakened with exciting flavors,I so wish I could give this place a 10 star review. They start u out with from scratch Gaelic knots and they don't cheap out on seasoning and flavor. They were so epic that when they brought the arugula Caesar salad with truffle oil I had a hard time putting the bread down which I can say rarely if ever happens . When I finally came out of bread coma I bit into the salad and more amazing flavors,the truffle oil complements the lemon flavor in the caesar dressing..with anchovies on top,perfect amount of dressing this salad I would give a 10 out of 10 if I could absolute food perfection. And know we get to the lobster ravioli ,I am not usually a huge fan of tomatoey sauces(I  aware that's not a word) how ever the creamy tomatoes sauce on this was heaven,the pack the ravioli in beautiful flavor and an amazing amount of lobster and the precede to puns on loads more on top of the ravioli.i give this what I wish could be 11 out of 10.
  So case in pint you are missing out if you don't come here while on vegas,the price is great and the food is out of this world amazing..

We ordered marsala, baked ziti, linguine bolognese, bruschetta pizza.... and it all tasted like food you might barf up after a drunk night on the strip... Well, that is, after you washed it off in the sink.

I'm serious. It tastes like you washed it with water. And in the $20 price range.. where you could make this all at home with no experience for $1-2, they are sheistering you big time.

We were a group of four, and our server was hesitant to give us seconds on the bread rolls... which by the way I recognized as frozen Pillsbury dough boy dinner rolls  covered in butter and garlic powder salt (not even real butter).. it tasted chemical-ly.

Another in our group recognized some of the flavors as Stouffer's frozen food.


This review is written by native Los Angelinos New Yorkers and Europeans... maybe our expectations are too high.

You'd have better luck eating next door at Grand Luxe Cafe. I guarantee your food will be better there, even though that's a chain. After all, this is a fake boutique Italian restaurant in an indoor shopping mall.",rVVKgd1YnmAYc0DEY4eOJA,2,2,2,T1PM9J3Bnt-NiQIsXLTf7g

As always, our tummies were too small for our ravenous appetites, so we ordered a tad bit too much food. Nonetheless, everything tasted great and we had a good time! We stopped by around 2 pm on a Saturday and the place was basically empty. As a result, we were able to snag a comfy booth and our server was really attentive throughout our meal.

I knew I needed to check this place out because they have filet mignon meatballs. Yup, you read that right. Filet mignon meatballs. My boyfriend and I got an order each (three meatballs for $18) and split a dish of chicken marsala ($26). The filet mignon meatballs tasted as heavenly as they sound. Juicy, flavorful, and tender; just how a meatball should be. We originally ordered the chicken marsala dish on the side to share since we figured three meatballs wouldn't be able to fill us. However, these meatballs were huge! After finishing one of my meatballs, I felt like I already ate three. I ended up unfortunately wasting one of my meatballs since the Venetian doesn't have a refrigerator or microwave in any of their rooms :( Nonetheless, this is a solid 5 out of 5 star dish and potentially my favorite meal I had in Vegas.

The chicken marsala was decent, I'd give it a 3.5 out of 5 stars. Everything was cooked nicely - the chicken was moist, the mushrooms had a nice amount of chew to them, and the noodles were perfectly al dente - but compared to the filet mignon meatballs, this dish just fell a little flat. It also didn't help that I was already stuffed to the brim once this dish came out! 

Other smaller notes:
- The complementary garlic bread is delicious. It's super soft and they definitely don't skimp out on the garlic butter spread. If you're looking for a cheap, delicious, and filling meal on the strip, I'd just order the filet mignon meatballs for $18 and stuff yourself with yummy free bread.

It is tucked away in the back of the food court. Location isn't great...I suppose that is how they keep the prices down. ""Outdoor tables"" are actually inside. Lighting in the interior of the restaurant is way too bright.
Service was very average...our waiter was a hyper-macho Italiano who kept himself busy fawning over the young girls eating next to us, and chatting with his buddies out in the food court plaza. At the end of our meal he was so carried away with his buddies that he had totally forgotten about us, and need to be retrieved by a bus boy.

I'm unsure what our server sounds like because the only word she muttered was ""sure"" when I asked for both the calamari and spaghetti to be served at the same time. 
She literally did not say ANYTHING else.
Not when I asked for a refill not when I said thank you as she dropped off the check... nothing.

If you have been to Vegas before then you know that eating in the middle of the Venetian shops might not be the most romantic dinner.  Yes the restaurant is small.  So small that you are seated basically in the middle of all the tourists.  I think they want you to feel like you are in Italy sitting outside in a European cafe, but this is Vegas!  

Food:  We ordered the meatballs that everyone raved about and they were so acidic that I couldn't even get 2 bits down before the heart burn started.  They aren't the hearty meat taste you might imagine.  They are made with Filet Mignon so they are just bland.  Then we had Linguine with Clams.  It was like water and the noodles were starchy.

Vegas is expensive, so if you are watching your dollars - we found this place on Yelp! allowing us to make the right decision to eat here vs the other many Italian restaurants and we feel we got great value.

VENUE & SERVICE:  Cute restaurant and our server was really friendly.  You are right in The Venetian close to everything so it made for a good pit stop.

BREAD: We appreciated the garlic knots and they even asked us if we wanted more but we had ordered enough food.

MENU: Lots of choice and prices were reasonable. Big portions - great if you are hungry and great if you like to take home leftovers. (We were both.)

We got: 
- Meat balls
- Baked ziti 
- Linguine bolognese

In hind site, we could have got the baked ziti with the meat balls since we were sharing food. But if you are more than two people, get this appy for 3 large meatballs.

With all that we were stuffed, so we didn't try any dessert.

AND BONUS (for us)... we took home leftovers that got us through two other meals. Our hotel had a kitchen, so I was able to transform leftovers into a second slightly different big meal with some items picked up at the local market.  Awesome - that's important to me :) that's good value!

4961624,2015-05-21,0,qFAw6wHMMcr4ctF-ZdGhEA,"After perusing the Yelp reviews of Italian eateries in Las Vegas, the hubby and I decided to give this place a try on a recent trip there.  I'm pretty sure this place makes it money on their wine and alcoholic beverages because I was all geared up for a glass of champagne until I discovered that the only brand of champagne they carry had a price tag of over $100.00 a glass (I believe it was actually $130.00!), and I seem to recall the cheapest glass of wine being somewhere in the vicinity of $13.00!  O.k., so I settled for water and a cappaccino (sp?) as an after-dinner drink!  

We ordered their ""greens"" salad ($13.00) and it was gigantic, so plenty for the both of us to share.  For our entrees, I had their baked ziti ($18.00) and the hubs ordered his usual favorite, lasagna (same price).  The baked ziti was a very generous serving, but the lasagna looked kind of lonely on the plate, so hubby downed what remained of my entree after devouring his lasagna.  They were both very, very good but I was disappointed in the sauce, which was a light, pale, almost pinkish color.  I was thinking it was maybe either a vodka sauce or pomodoro, but the waiter told us they mix ricotta into their marinara sauce; hence, the paler sauce.  I'm not a huge fan of ricotta outside of it being contained in ravioloi or layering it in lasagna.  I prefer my Italian sauce deep, dark red and rich, so this took away from the dish for me, but that is just my own personal preference.  There were large layers of melted mozzarella covering the baked ziti, which was delish!

Now for the best thing at Trattoria Reggiano - DESSERT!!  And, yes, a ""specific"" dessert at that!  It's spelled C.A.N.N.O.L.I!!!  This was the highlight of our dinner experience at this restaurant!  If you eat here, you simply MUST - and I can't stress this enough - M.U.S.T. indulge in one of their cannoli's!!!  Absolutelyo TO-DIE-FOR - the BEST cannoli to ever make acquaintance with my palate!!  And for a Bostonian gal, this is really saying something as Bostonians take their cannoli's VERY seriously (just ask anyone if you ever happen to be in Boston!).  In the several decades of living on the west coast, I had never yet experienced a cannoli that could compare with the way they're made on the east coast.  But, I'm here to tell you that at Trattoria Reggiano, they are pure HEAVEN!!  No. 1, they are huge.  They are filled with marscapone, as they should be, with a few, very few, chocolate chips scattered throughout, whipped cream on top and a light drizzing of  caramel syrup on the plate to make it look fancy!  I was NOT happy about sharing this with the hubby, especially when he's never really cared for cannoli's before!!  I wanted to be a glutton and eat the entire thing myself, but I decided to be nice!

Lastly,their bread is also noteworthy.  They're small roundish little knots of bread with a buttery, garlic topping.  Very yummy!

The only thing that prevented me from giving this restaurant more stars was the fact that I wasn't crazy about the sauce, but that is just my own personal taste.",D8QhUr_Y41HdB0VYM8uiVA,1,0,3,HMB3CSNg4vGJBh_GmPZRzA

4968149,2014-01-08,0,qFAw6wHMMcr4ctF-ZdGhEA,"Found this on Yelp, as we were craving Italian food that was within walking distance of Treasure island. This place was a little hard to find. I get that it's in the Venetian, but some signage would be nice. If you hit to Palazzo from the Venetian, you're going the wrong way!

The place is pretty small, so we were happy to have gotten seating on a Saturday evening. The host that seated us was super friendly and our server was nice. Everyone that helped us here sounded legitimately Italian. Either that or they had a legit Italian faccent (fake accent), which was so good that it may be real. 

Food here was a bit pricier than I expected (but was it really? It's dining on the strip...), but was good. They start you off with these garlic bread rolls. Make sure you're limiting how many of these you eat. They will come to suffocate you later when you try to fit more carb into your body. The pastas here come in pretty large sizes and are so tasty you just want to keep eating them. Don't. Trust me when i say to box about half of your pasta. I did just that and I was full after a while, and my family finished theirs and I almost had to roll them to the car because they were so full. It may not have helped that we finished with the tiramisu, which was a custard mixed with ladyfingers served in a wine glass. Everything we had here was delicious. I had the carbonara, my mom had a seafood fettuccine, and my brother had the bolognese. All were really tasty and plentiful.  

One of the things I would change about this place is pricing (but I know it's hard to complain about pricing on the strip). Each pasta plate cost around $17-20+. The other thing I would point out is being able to hear the staff get yelled at/scolded since we were seated near the kitchen. It's almost shameful to the staff to face the customers after they just got scolded!

5014503,2015-07-07,0,qFAw6wHMMcr4ctF-ZdGhEA,"I thought the food was good, but not especially noteworthy - tough competition in Vegas. The carbonara was authentic (no cream) but isn't the best I've had. The balsamic and olive oils left tableside are high quality. And the antipasto platter is huge; even a half order would feed four people! 

But the entire experience was marred by awful service that felt like being at an Applebee's and having a waiter-in-training. When we sat down, the menu had barely been presented when we were asked if we wanted to order - he totally misread us and thought we wanted a fast service instead of a relaxing meal (or else he just wanted the table turnover). I am able to look past that, we took our time, ordered, and when the antipasto platter came out, they had substituted a hard cheese for the fresh mozzarella which was disappointing.  When my waiter finally reappeared I asked him about it, and he said ""well it should"", shrugged, and walked away - no offer to fix it or even query the kitchen for an explanation. He also never offered a refill of the raved-about garlic knots - I didn't particularly need them given the size of the platter, but an offer would have been nice and appropriate.  He also brought our entrees prior to the appetizer platter being finished - poor timing by either himself or the kitchen, again expecting fast turnover instead of a relaxing meal. Definitely the opposite of ""authentic Italian""!

Finally, older reviews talk about a hard to find quiet spot, but the current location is in the food court so there is a lot of foot traffic walking by. In conclusion, even though the food is good (three-star), there are many good Italian places in Las Vegas to dine at, so I can't recommend Trattoria Reggiano.",KyCJW_tKT7jpAyc7vjZ_Dw,0,0,2,wCPuQxtrzkuK8AxF7pC-RQ

Vegas is know for restaurants large enough to seat the population of a small country, not the case here.  It's an open kitchen with a few tables and a few booths.  Sure the alfresco dinning is in the middle of a mall but it worked. Sometimes you need to get away from the bustle of Vegas and just enjoy a meal and the company you're with.  

The service was great especially since we were a party of 4 chatty women wanting separate checks with a bottle of wine.  Ok he couldn't split the bottle across 4 checks.  The waiter handled all our questions by saying, ""I've been married for 30 years ask away!""  The perfect amount of cheekiness!!!! 

The food was traditional Italian  -
Few people had eggplant parmigiana.  Huge potions.  Those that had a fridge in their hotel room, they took it home for lunch the next day. Those that didn't, took it to go and gave it to a homeless guy on the strip.  
The pizza with eggplant and ricotta was good.  Bonus points for the fact that they removed the skin from the eggplant.  I had a few slices and the rest went to the homeless man mentioned above. 

We washed it down with a Chianti sans fava beans!",LQJ7jEWxBBLYiaGVWdN5Dg,3,2,3,i0aKrw1IV6TwC95PVM602A

On this most recent adventure to Las Vegas I got to experience it again so I went a different route and didn't have a rerun of the filet mignon meatballs that I fondly remember from my first visit.

Once we found the place I think I even got the same charming Italian server that I had the prior year. With a very good imagination you could envision yourself at a small bistro in the middle of a village in Italy. The servings at this restaurant are very large so it would be most ideal to share a meal with a friend rather than feel like you need to be wheeled back to your hotel.

The garlic knots/muffins are so darn good I could probably be happy just eating a Caesar salad and this garlicky piece of heaven.

Push a button, any button, and *whoosh* you're off to some exotic destination. Is it the great pyramid of the Mojave or will it be a poolside oasis in this devastating heat? 

Well, my mama and I wished to be whisked away to the canals of Venice. *Whoosh* and off we went to Palazzo via the Monorail. Although only 1 stop away from MGM Grand where we stayed, we wanted to avoid the 92º heat at 8PM. Sure we still did some walking, but it was nice and cool amongst the marble laden hallways. 

After viewing pictures on Yelp of the foods served here, we we're insatiably curious to taste them for ourselves. Our tummies were VERY happy with this choice and so were our wallets! 

Trattoria Reggiano is a hole in the wall, tucked away within the Grand Canal Shoppes. Although it has a limited number of booths inside, the seating spills out into the hallway, creating a street cafe effect that seems both authentic and quaint. 

We sere seated immediately and we dove right into the menu. And the garlic balls! We both started with wine, ahhhhve cooooourse. To share, we split the meatballs.

Oh, the MEATBALLSSSSS. So tender. So simple. So hot. So meaty. Smothered in the house ""gravy"" or ""marinara"" sauce, these went perfectly with the garlic balls served complimentary. The best things in life, come in ball form. They almost always come as a pair too. 

For our entrees, Mama went for the chicken marsala and I, the carbonara. 

Mine was so rich, creamy, and the right amount of salty bacon. Although I was extremely full from the meatballs and bread rolls, I don't know how I scarfed this amazing bowl of pasta down, but it was DAMN DELICIOUS. 

When all parts of a restaurant (ambiance, service, food, timing) come together in serendipitous unity, it's pure bliss. It's also the button I wanna press all the time in the Great Glass Elevator.",4-xndHdyqyBZ1Cj7-qpsag,10,9,5,r4QJ9aekT9luDqCqzmtt1A

We got here around 6:45 on Saturday night and there were a couple groups ahead of us.  Despite this, the host/manager said to come back at 7.  We arrived at 7 and he said it'd be a few extra minutes.  There was an empty table for 4 being cleared and I knew we were next on the list, but he sat a party of 4 there before us, leaving us waiting for a party of 2 to get up.  I realize that they don't have many tables and it would seem like a waste to sit a party of 2 at a 4-top, but it was poor service since they rushed a party of 2 out after that, though we still waited another 10 minutes for them.

The server wasn't nearly as friendly as last time.  He was a little rude when I asked for bread and said, ""Lady, this a busy store!"" in his Italian accent.  I realized it was busy, but we'd been sitting there over 5 minutes before he even came over and then he didn't bring bread the first 2 times he stopped by.  And I was damn hungry.  We both lightened up and he got a nicer toward the end of the meal (probably to bring up his tip).

Food was still excellent.  Got the penne primavera with grilled chicken.  I wish I got something with red sauce, though, because it looked so good, but I remembered how good the primavera was.  Big portions and despite my hunger, I couldn't finish it all.  Pinot Grigio wasn't as good as I recall, but maybe I've just had better since then.

My husband and i got married at the Venetian resort, which is an amazing hotel, and we continue going there every year. The night before our wedding we and our four friends decided to go to this cozy looking Italian restaurant mainly the atmosphere seemed very nice and we love Italian food. 

However, I ordered a pasta dish not sure which one, with chicken and it came without, which I instantly noted to the waiter. Of course the waiter was apologetic, went to the kitchen to ask for the chicken, which I found very strange, perhaps even more strange when the chicken came out in a bowl, they had cooked the already frozen cooked chicken in cream in the microwave, so basically I was meant to add that to my pasta, It was hilariously disappointing, and our friends weren't very impressed about their pizzas either, and barely touched them.",tFjhZT5TMHHGBnyZotSf2w,3,0,2,GbwN4KsVf8wFYwUMQkQbyA

While I cannot answer that question, I can tell you that we were not fans.  First, the service was terrible.  Our waiter was un-friendly and abrupt.  After we were seated, he came to our table and asked if we knew what wanted to eat.  He never asked us for a drink order.  We had two friends join us who had already eaten, and in the time it took our waiter to come over they were able to walk over to the coffee bean, order drinks, pick them up, and enjoy them.  

So we ordered, and we placed our entire order at that time - drinks, apps, entrees and desserts.  Then we waited.  And waited.  And then we got our entrees with no appetizer.  The waiter seemed pissed off, and made a comment about the kitchen staff.  Well, what about his job of checking on our table?  Ugh, annoying.  So we canceled the appetizer order and just ate the main course.  We had the pesto gnocchi.  It was bland.  The gnocchi was nice though.

The bread was also delicious, if not a tad bit oily.  But still, warm and yummy.  Our friends ordered dessert and one of them liked the Tiramisu, but the other did not.  She was expecting a layered-caked style tiramisu, vs. the layered in a glass tiramisu they received.

The atmosphere also brings this review down a star.  The majority of the tables are set up in the hallway and it makes it feel like you are eating in a shopping mall food court.  Lots of people milling around staring at you while you eat, from an arm's length away.  Not really what I would call charming ambiance.

We're ignored the entire time while she's laughing with coworkers. We put in for appetizers, and when she finally stops ignoring us and comes back to the table, her response is, ""So are you ready to finish ordering or what?"" I'm glad I had my back to the kitchen because my husband saw them literally opening a bag of pasta to serve! My lobster and his shrimp were frozen.

The short version: overpriced, terribly RUDE service, and bland food will definitely keep me away from this restaurant. 

We visited this place to celebrate having family in town. What better place to celebrate family than in an Italian restaurant, am I right? Well, today I was sadly mistaken. 

The place was half empty despite being a busy Saturday in the Venetian. We were seating immediately after our arrival and an older waiter came to our table to drop off the menus as well olive oil and balsamic vinegar. Not the friendliest of greetings, but I let it slide. 

While we were waiting to decide on our meal, I asked our waiter for some bread (thought it was odd we got the oil and vinegar, but no bread) to which he abruptly replied ""bread comes to the table after you place your order"". What's this all about? Was he afraid we were going to dine on free bread and water?!? Anyways, we then placed he order and things got really awkward. 

After waiting for our food for a few minutes, the waiter came to our table, literally dropped my girlfriends plate in front of her from about an inch above the table top, and set my plate as well as my brothers. He left without a word. 

Upon a closer look of my dish, something seemed off with the ingredients, but before asking I thought I would try it. This dish was bland, tasted of canned sauce and was not what I had ordered. Before I could even say anything, the waiter rushed to my table, took the fork from my hand and then pulled my dish of the table... without saying a single word. 

That was it for me. I raised my voice and asked him what was going on only to hear him utter the words ""the chef made a mistake, I'm fixing it"". While I appreciate him trying to fix it, his gross demeanor and terrible attitude interrupted the mood in the table, and upset everyone. To add insult to injury, the manager came over and tried to brush the incident off by justifying the waiters behavior and telling me not to worry about it. Not worry about it? Why would I be worried? I didn't do anything wrong!!!!

The worst part of all? The manager was within feet of our table the whole time, and he apparently knows this waiter is terrible.

5353778,2016-02-03,0,qFAw6wHMMcr4ctF-ZdGhEA,"I was browsing through recommended Italian restaurants while visiting Vegas with the family and ran into Reggiano's reviews and decided on it from a long list of options.
We had some trouble finding the place and almost gave up on our search by entering a more visible (and quite busy) Italian eatery, but we persevered and made with the location. 
The restaurant area is small which in my opinion helps it with its mom & pop feel (just ignore the food court traffic). Tables were close together but I have to admit I did not feel crowded in there. I do believe we scored a very good table in the small patio area - we may have gotten really lucky there. We were seated promptly, server was prompt to our table and overall very pleasant.
Ok, let's talk food now, shall we? One of the main reasons we decided on Reggiano's was the hailed filet mignon meatballs, so that was a must order item for us.  We ordered the appetizer meatballs and before even trying them, I was brave (and confident) that ordered some more in my spaghetti entree, since I decided to go simple and take full advantage of the raved meatballs. I'm afraid I couldn't tell you what the fuzz is all about. The meatballs we simply OK and nothing to write home about (yet I am writing about them here). Equally blend and unimpressive was my spaghetti entree. Expecting to taste a traditional and flavorful sauce, I felt I was eating something only barely better than a fast food joint pasta plate.
I do regret not having the opportunity to try some of the other entrees mentioned, but I did try the tortellini with chicken in alfredo sauce and that is a plate I can stand behind. The chicken was perfectly cooked, soft and juicy and was an excellent to the delicious cheese-filled tortellini. I was not alone in this verdict, as we all shared our plates (as any sensible family would do). This makes me regret not ordering a chicken based entree, but I hope to get the chance to try other recommended plates on the menu in the future.",tNoOgSMjIMkAUJMxTxw5eA,0,0,4,TLsgnQMMqwET2JZl8qp-7Q

You might just walk by this little restaurant if you don't pay attention. Among the many shops and little stores within the Venetian, Trattoria Reggiano may only catch a glimpse of your attention because of their ""outdoor patio."" It's more just some tables set up nicely outside. Not bad, but I think they do that just to seat more people. Inside the restaurant seats just a few parties because there are about 10 small booths more or less. Their kitchen is tiny! Their ambiance definitely catches the intended theme of an ""Italian street side cafe.""

It's a cute little place if you're craving some Italian food. Great garlic rolls, almost drenched in the oil and seasonings, some might complain. But I personally really liked it. We ordered the margarita pizza, and a pasta dish that I cannot recall the name of. But neither of the dishes were memorable and I really can't see myself ordering anything other than the basic spaghetti or Alfredo the next time I go there.

Paolo came to our table the first time we dined at Reggiano, and since then we have always dined in his section when possible; but even if we can't he and I always find time to greet each other and catch up!! I grew up in Milano (I'm an oil brat, my Dad worked for oil companies ) and Paolo is from northern Italy too, so we reminisce together...
The FOOD: really good, honest, Italian food. Pasta cooked properly, al dente and not drowning in too much, overwhelming sauce. My fave is the Carbonara, but I've had excellent Spaghetti alle Vongole and other pastas.
 As a starter, I'm very very partial to the Calamari: perfectly crispy, with a good ratio of rings to legs, and the lemon halves covered with an elasticated 'cheesecloth' so the seeds don't get on your calamari!
Of course the Caprese is soooo good too, lovely tomatoes and creamy, luscious Burrata that melts in the mouth... mmmm, I can almost taste it !
 Reggiano also has my fave cocktail and liquor, too :
Negroni and Limoncello respectively.

We ordered a Margherita pizza to share, a glass of wine each, and also munched on the complimentary bread (with olive oil and balsamic vinegar). We were worried that our memories of the meal last year were clouded with time and we were building it up, only to be let down. No, no we weren't disappointed. Oh. My. Goodness.

Our server was great. He was actually honest about recommendations and would say something wasn't as good if we asked. He was attentive and friendly.

I went for a classic four-cheese pizza, which was enough for me and really could be shared between two people, which would help save you some dough. It was really tasty all around-good sauce, good crust, good cheese.

Fun little extra? All the workers have pretty thick Italian accents and are extremely friendly! Although it makes ordering via the phone a little difficult at times.

Both times I have gotten the Tortellini Alfredo. Medium chewy pieces of tortellini stuffed with delicious cheese in an extremely buttery cream sauce. The portion for this is a bit deceiving visually when you first get it, it seems small, but it will definitely fill you up! Plus, the free garlic knots that come with it are delicious and are a wonderful vehicle for you to scoop up any remaining sauce you have on your plate. YUMS

I yelped a place and this came up and seemed perfect. First, it took us forever to find the place A pretty well hidden. Then, the place was in reality small, lots of light, and there wasn't anything special about it. We didn't really care - we were there for a good Italian meal and to catch up. 
Five stars for service - the service was actually good and everyone was nice and courteous at all times. Five stars For the tiramisu as well. Even though I am not a tiramisu person at all but that was the table's choice I loved it. It comes in a glass and the tiramisu part is really only on the bottom - there's something like a vanilla pudding/creme brûlée filling that was very tasty. 
However, the food was ok. Just ok. Absolutely nothing special. We got couple of pizzas that were ok and my husband got the ny strip special ($60 meal) and described it as ""the worse steak"" he recently ate. For that kind of money you can get a real steak at a good steakhouse and go home happy.

Yes, of course I'm a people watcher and who wouldn't want to be while your in Las Vegas.

I decided on the spaghetti and meatballs but as our server took his sweet time bringing us our waters, I had changed my mind and now it was set on a pizza.  They brought us bread which was really very good bread.  We made a dipping sauce with olive oil and balsamic vinegar which was on the table.  Holy Cow, that balsamic vinegar was delicious!  Our server said that the balsamic vinegar was brought in especially for this restaurant.  Very nice.

So, the table next to us ordered the spaghetti and meatballs.  It looked and smelled fabulous.  I was pissed I didn't order it.  I know they ordered it to rub it in my face a little, just kidding.  Seriously it looked awesome.

As I sat there being mad at myself for changing my order last minute, here came our server with our food: Marghertia Pizza, Pizza with Pepperoni and Mushrooms, and the Tortellini Alfredo.  One word = Delicious.

The meatballs melted in your mouth and the leftover sauce made for great dipping sauce for the amazing garlic rolls (ask for seconds!!). We got two pastas each: a lobster ravioli and another pasta I can't remember the name to.

After a show at the Palazzo, we decided to have a nice dinner afterwards at the Venetian. After bumbling through the over priced and busy restaurants, we came across this little trattoria. The menu options and prices upon first glance were exactly what we were looking for. We were seated promptly and our server Paolo was wonderful. He was so sweet and made the effort to get my girlfriend an extra napkin as she was wearing a white dress and he didn't want it to get stained. Our table had a paper covering and some crayons, so we colored and it was a very fun and cute way to wait in between our food. We were started off with the most amazing garlic knots I have ever had, did I mention they were complimentary?! I ordered the spaghetti bolognese and my girlfriend got the margherita pizza. The portions were on the larger size, even for the low price. The filet mignon used in the bolognese made all the difference and was the most remarkable pasta I had ever had. The pizza was a personal size, but again a little bigger as I had to end up helping my girlfriend eat some, and we were still left with some slices to take home! The fresh cheese and beautiful, bright tomatoes were fantastic on the pizza. For dessert we had the cannoli and some coffee. Both were equally as delicious and satisfying, and were a wonderful way to wrap up our meal.

The bread is excellent--better than most free breads I've had at Italian joints, and they provide it in copious quantities at exactly the right price of zero.  The atmosphere is a little mall/foodcourty (then again, so is all of Vegas), but the food is definitely well above that caliber.  The meatballs are made out of filet mignon, so expect some high end protein in your spaghetti.  They also make legit carbonara--no canned cream sauce.  It's a hair off four stars; it would make the cut if the ambiance was a little nicer.

The dish with solid, noodles were al dente, and chicken was seasoned and cooked to perfection. We tried a few different desserts, every one of which was freaking delicious. The ricotta cheesecake was ridiculous, and a must for diners with room left. Every person in our party had a great time thanks to the well prepared food and hospitable staff.

We began with very garlicky large Garlic Rolls and a not too cheesy, not too saucy, and fairly thin Salsiccia Pizza, followed by a tasty bowl of Pasta e Fagioli Soup with big Cannelloni Beans.  Then, while Diane enjoyed Tortelloni Alfredo, I savored very good medallions of Veal Marsala along with first-rate Fettuccine Alfredo topped by fresh Parmigiana Cheese.

5868746,2015-01-27,0,qFAw6wHMMcr4ctF-ZdGhEA,"To be fair, my wife and I were not expecting the highest level of food and service when we reserved a table for dinner at Trattoria Reggiano.  We had already eaten a couple of the celebrity chef venues in the Venetian / Palazzo complex over the prior few days.  Rather, we were just looking for tasty food and good service at a presumed slightly lower price point.

Our waitress was also working behind the service bar, was very pleasant but either not trained or focused on the task at hand.  We were seated at a booth with settings for four.  The extra settings were never removed, (we finally stacked them to the side) we asked to split a salad and ordered two pasta dishes as our main courses.  After a short wait, the salad came with no plates for splitting with the main courses arriving  within a minute after.  I asked that they take the pasta dishes back until we completed our salads, but immediately realized that the dishes would just sit in the back until we asked for them, so we hurried through our salads and flagged down a server to have them returned a few minutes later.  (The table was never cleared of salad plates until the end of our meal)  We ordered a bottle of wine with our dinner, (reasonably priced compared to some of the other venues in this complex) but other than the initial pour, it was self service after, which I'm fine with,  just unusual to not have a waiter or waitress offer to pour more when the glasses are sitting empty even in a restaurant of this level.

The food was OK, safe, unimaginative.  My wife's Lasagna was somewhat dry, (even a little Marinara poured over the top would have shown effort) and the best description that I could come up with for my dish was Hamburger Helper on steroids.  It was (Supposedly Tenderloin) ground beef mixed with marinara sauce over pasta.  The sauce was flavorless, one step above tomato sauce out of the can with a few dry spices added to it..  

All that including the wine and tip (yes, I still tipped the waitress 20% since she was pleasant and I truly felt she was just poorly trained) was $130.00 for the two of us.

The manager came by at he end of our meal and asked how our meal was.  I told him very nicely that it was disappointing and overall not what we expected.   He started to offer to get us another dish, but honestly, we had discounted that option earlier since we didn't really see much hope that the food or service would change with a different dish.  I politely declined and he mumbled a thank you for joining us as he walked away.

I'm by no description a food snob.  I've been served much worse, and obviously for many their food is very satisfying.  I personally would chose a dinner at Carrabba's any day over this restaurant in the future if I had the option.....hands down.",IzyGoQpTSuijbsxM4sbqrw,3,0,2,QOULYBiDg9WglMfq_Svk9w

We decided to duck into the Venetian for some food, after wandering the strip all morning, and ended up here. We didn't want to take leftovers since we weren't headed back to the hotel room for a while so we ordered a dish to share. The Eggplant Parmigiana was delicious! The dish was the perfect size for 2 people, especially since they give you DIVINE complimentary bread to munch on while you wait for your food. Divine! Divine, I say!

The place is really small, only has 6-8 booths & tables inside and about the same number crammed into a space outside. The slight cramped-ness adds to the cozy feel though, I really liked the decor and atmosphere. The walls are lined with pictures of old-time Italian people (just like Buca di Beppo, except better because it's not like the ""Illustrated Archives of Italy, c. 1800-1950"" threw up on the walls like at Buca...of course the food here is 20x better as well). 

The staff are really great, friendly and attentive without being overbearing. It's funny, our waitress so resembled a b&w picture of an Italian woman on the wall that we wondered if they were related. We forgot to ask though!

The cannoli was amazing. Our waitress gave us a great suggestion for wine too, and they were really nice about the fact that the mister brought in his own beer that we picked up at a bar on the strip. They even gave him a proper mug for it so he wouldn't have to keep drinking it out of a plastic cup!

The garlic roll rivals the best garlic bread in any restaurant, lavishly brushed with butter and garlic. The bucatini frutti di mare is full of flavorful seafood, clams, shrimp, and little calamari. Of course, the lasagna al forno and spaghetti and meatballs are savory with fresh garlicky tomato sauce that you will want to soak up with the garlic rolls. Everything is fresh and simple, great basics make this Italian eatery a primary stop in the Venetian. It's easily comparable to Buddy V's, Carnevino, Maggiano's or any of the Italian pizzerias in the area. Dora, the manager, always stops by to kindly chat and make fantastic food recommendations.

Once you step in however, the service and care that is given to both the patrons and foods really makes you feel loved.

The Garlic Rolls are wonderful, soft and flavorful and quite honestly you can really get filled up fast on them, so be careful!  I had the Spaghetti with Bologna, noodles were perfectly firm to the touch and the sauce was very fulfilling.  

My wife had the clam linguini and they did NOT skim on the clams at all--I think that probably will get a good 5-7 more clams than you're normally used to !!

I must say however that the dessert is nothing to write home about, I was really having a sweet tooth and decided to splurge on dessert.  Bad Idea IMO, the $8 dollars could've been better spent elsewhere, the cannoli I ordered was way too rich and dense that I really need coffee to break it down.  Next time I come here, I will skip the dessert and save they money.

5964368,2014-02-18,2,qFAw6wHMMcr4ctF-ZdGhEA,"During a recent trip to Vegas my husband and I were looking on Yelp for an Italian restaurant that was in walking distance of our hotel. Upon seeing the reviews and pictures about Trattoria Reggiano we were both sold. I wasn't thrilled that it happened to be located in the Venetian's Grand Canal Shops. I don't like that hotel and I don't like malls. However I will endure a lot for good food. As predicted walking through the Grand Canal Shops in search of Trattoria Reggiano was beyond unpleasant. Vendors and merchants were harassing us and when we paused to consult the directory/map an employee dressed like a Carabinieri offered to show us where the restaurant was. He walked us back towards the direction we had come from and pointed to the WRONG restaurant. Major fail. We ended up walking in a giant circle before Trattoria Reggiano nestled off in a side enclave near a Coffee Bean and the Houdini Shop. 

The waitors here are all older Italian gentlemen. They notice customers  and announce how long the wait will be. There is no hostess or sign up sheet. We were told it would be a few minutes as a couple tables paid and got bussed and exactly a few minutes later we were shown to our table.

I can't really put my finger on the ambiance. It's like they're trying to be a fancy Italian restaurant with white table cloths. But then the Dean Martin and Michael Buble blaring from the speakers, along with the sound of pounding coming from the kitchen (meat tenderizing? I'm not sure but it was really loud) really threw it off. 

I started with a glass of wine - they don't tell you what brand the wines by the glass are, but the cabernet sauvignon I ordered tasted an awful lot like two-buck chuck. 

The garlic knots were good. We ordered the filet mignon meatballs to start, but they really weren't anything special. There was nothing interesting about their texture or the way they tasted. The sauce was flat in taste and more watery / homogenous than I would have liked. I ordered the linguine carbonara, which was fine, but was a little soggier / less al dente than I would have liked. My date had the chicken parmegiana, which was also a bit on the ""soggy"" side. 

Vegas is sorely lacking in pasta places and this satisfied my craving for pasta (brought on by Olive Garden commercials on repeat on Hulu.. and I flat out refuse to go to Olive Garden)... but it won't be somewhere I make a special trip for.",GQ_2kpEee1KXZCKEtpeEfw,0,0,3,uIuXN6Mo5MhSIPW79yL0uw

Hier werden sowohl verschiedene Pastas wie auch Pizzas serviert zusammen mit einer überraschend grossen Weinkarte die es - für Las Vegas Verhältnisse - zu vernünftigen Preisen gibt. Zu den Vorspeisen werden leckere Parmesan Rolls serviert die die Wartezeit auf den Hauptgang verkürzen. Als Main Course gab es Tagliatelle an einer Rahmsauce die gut war, aber nicht mehr. Als Nachtisch wurde hausgemachtes Tiramisu im Glas serviert welches fünf Sterne verdient hätte. Alles in allem ein gutes Esserlebnis zu vernünftigem Preis.",4xkmVbqGBth8QnguPYqKBg,0,0,4,QFiP-Sy25M-Gj5hGIaJLFA

I think you can tell a lot about the skills of a chef by the taste of their most basic dish, and the spaghetti and the meatballs are out of this world, which tells me they know what they're doing! i've also tried the caprese which was amazing, the carbonara (to die for!), the aglio e olio YUM, and their veal milanese, which they graciously topped with a ton of prosciutto when we asked. 

i'm the type of person who tries not to go to the same restaurant twice, but this place i will be visiting EVERY SINGLE TIME i'm in vegas.",17Wjm9XB6LzOMncFooJn0w,2,1,5,JjYQ8OPEP4LhaMZRdkykUg
