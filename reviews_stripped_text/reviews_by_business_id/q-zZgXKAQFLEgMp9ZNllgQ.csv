Then, she sat us at the front table nearest the front entrance and it is 105 degrees outside and they have so many table available. I asked her nicely if I can sit at other table instead. Do you know what she said to me? She said you have to sit here and you can't move to another tables . WTF! The problem I have with her is her fxxking attitude and her facial expression that make me sick. If she doesn't want to be a server, quit and do something else. Then I went to the Chef and let him know what's going on. All the Chef always been great to us when we go there.

169306,2016-04-22,0,q-zZgXKAQFLEgMp9ZNllgQ,"Goyemon has been my favorite AYCE sushi joint in town for quite a while and I've been very hesitant to try other places because I'm always disappointed when I do. However, I was really craving uni and Goyemon was all out so we decided to give Umiya a try based on all the great reviews. Now I see what I've been missing out on. 

Pros:
Oysters, uni, amaebi
A lot of items on AYCE menu
Half rolls available
Dinner starts at 3pm

Cons:
No salmon skin
Extra 50¢ for quail egg
Only ice cream desserts
Dinner starts at 3pm

Firstly, they have quite a selection of items to order, which is great because you're likely to find a few rolls that float your boat. They also let you order half rolls, so you can try more rolls.  I mean the whole point of going to AYCE places is so you can order a lot of different things. 

I love that the dinner menu starts at 3pm, because uni and the seared tuna sashimi in AJ sauce is only available for dinner. It's totally worth the extra $5 for me, but if you don't like uni, amaebi, or seared tuna sashimi, this wouldn't be a pro for you as those three items are basically the only difference between lunch and dinner. (The seared tuna sashimi in AJ sauce is so good though! I'd definitely recommend everybody to try it)

The sushi chefs and serve staff are rock stars. It was packed during my first visit and everybody was hard at work. The chefs banged out orders and didn't let a plate sit for more than a few seconds before yelling out the table number again for the servers to pick it up. We came back just a few days later (this time during the day when it was super slow) and the chefs were all busy prepping for the night.

My friends & I came here about a month ago because we were craving AYCE sushi & wanted to try someplace new. The reviews looked good on Yelp, so why not? 

There were a couple of good things going for this place. It is a BIG space, which is nice compared to smaller sushi places like Goyemon or Sushi Koma. Another nice thing is that their nigiri is small, which we liked so we could have more of the other sushi.

Now, onto the bad. The biggest thing I did not like was their service. We ordered the first round of sushi & rolls - which was fine. Then a couple more. Then we decided to ask the waiter for recommendations. We ordered some of the special rolls since our first round of sushi was mainly nigiri. Well, the waiter who brought our rolls brought the wrong rolls! & the original waiter LEFT FOR THE DAY. Wait, what?! I'm used to places introducing the second waiter or at least letting us know if they are taking a break or leaving. So, of course, we're telling this new waiter that the rolls he brought us are NOT the ones we ordered. He kept saying one was the lobster roll & we had a shrimp tempura roll - which was the same thing! So we had these two baked rolls (that were the same!) which are heavy, so of course we got full faster. We didn't send one of those rolls back which was our fault, but in the end, they didn't charge us for what we didn't finish, so I guess we're even.",8kblFESkorfP00ryDTBuRQ,2,1,2,TwlvlEj5AXJU3fEZ9oIBUw

I would recommend going for the ""all you can eat"" option. Especially if you are at least two persons since you then can order different things and share (if you don't like sharing you suck). For me sharing the different rolls and talk about them as we eat is a good experience. I will recommend starting with a Screaming O(rgasme) and some Edamame. Of the rolls there are several good ones: Orange Blossom, Sexy Roll and the Baked Salmon Roll are among my favorites. And you have to get the tuna pieces in AJ sauce.

My mom got up to just look at the waiting list to see when our turn was and the waitress who was in front of my mom gave my mom an unpleasant look and started talking to the waiter next to her saying ""That lady won't just sit down and she keeps wandering in front of us"" like my mom was some annoying person who's just randomly annoying her. First of all, my mother is not just ""that lady"". She is your customer and despite the fact that we are in a restaurant, isn't it just straight up rude giving someone who you don't know at all a nasty look and talking about them? I was just so mad and shocked about how they treated my mother. 

It was just my mom, my brother, and I who went to eat. As I was eating, I can see and hear with my two eyes and ears that the servers were asking around ""How was the food?"" or ""How is it going so far?"",yet all we got was ""Are you guys done eating?"" like they wanted to kick us out and bring in new customers. I know. Dinner time is very busy and they had a lot in their minds but they were treating us like we weren't going to pay and just take off or like we've been staying there for hours which none of it is true. Those services just started to make me think ""Is it because they see my mother as a single mom or something?"" or because it's just two weak women and some 7 years old kid. 

Eating dinner outside with your family means having a meaningful time outside with your family by spending money. I am not sure what my mom did to deserve this kind of service but it was terrible and I was just so furious.",PEzJzvaWJGqD4TSME6vqMw,0,0,1,jCsUlAOOPsrT2SNDLhB_HQ

It was fresh and the rice proportion is good. The atmosphere was nice-more of a restaurant feel bc it was a bigger space, had nice dim lighting. Service was awesome but we went in between lunch/dinner time so it was not busy. Their appetizers are better than most ayce sushi places and the rolls are decent. They have crab meat in a lot of the rolls, which I'm not a fan of so the choices weren't great for me but they had a couple rolls we really enjoyed!

425607,2014-09-15,4,q-zZgXKAQFLEgMp9ZNllgQ,"We just had the worst experience of AYCE sushi ever.
We were there for lunch today.  We planned to have sushi lunch for me and one of our group's birthday. We had been picking a sushi place for the whole week. One of my friends picked this place ad I was here last month for dinner. I told my friends I liked the interior this place. So we ended up here.

There were only 3 tables were seated when we got there. Our table had 6 asian girls with one baby. We got water all set up. Oh good. A server came right when everyone got there "" are you ready to order?"" well we hadn't even looked at the menu yet. We were discussing about paying dinner price to get sweet shrimp and sea urchin. then we ordered salmon nigari to start and the question we got was ""so are you gonna pay lunch or dinner?"" I replied ""start with salmon nigari. it is in both lunch and dinner. and we will decide in a couple minutes"" I got a little annoyed. We decided to just have lunch because some of us don't eat sweet shrimp and sea urchin.

Once we started ordering, one of the servers said ""make sure you guys read all the rules"" the rules are pretty much the same as the other AYCE sushi restaurant. No rice left, no sharing with non-AYCE, and so on. We all got annoyed. I understand the waitress was doing her job by informing us. but we all know the rules.

Food is good. We got our orders pretty fast. There were some confusion but we ignored it. There were two waitresses. on we got too many orders of grilled mackerels, and i told them ""don't worry about it. I will eat them."" 

Here come the worst parts. They got more customers coming. There were only two waitresses. Our water and hot tea was empty. We had to call them and asked for refills. One time my friend pulled out her dr.peppers bottle to drink, the server came right at her ""no outside food or drink in here"" or now they were more observant with outside drink than our glasses of water that were empty. awesome job ladies! Morever, in the middle of the meal, the server came and told us ""you have to finish all the rice"" We know. and we were still working on our food. We were eating and having a great conversation. Our meal started to be ruined by. Another server came and picked the spoon in my miso soup bowl and said ""you have to finish rice in the soup too"" oh this is so RUDE. You can talk to me but you don't touch my spoon in my food that is right in front of me! I said ""I eat my soup with rice"" she said ""oh ok because someone tries to hide rice in soup"" I got so pissed. They spoke to us with attitude. honey, let me tell you here. If we cheat about rice, we make sure you can't catch me hiding all the rice somewhere.

Our group decided to not tip them because this was so bad of dinning experience, but the server dropped the check and said gratuity had been added. We still gotta pay them without gratuity anyway.  Lucky for the server that I saw a gentleman walking in and out the restaurant for a while. I decided to call him and asked ""are you a manager?"" he said ""I am the owner"" Bingo! We told him the food was great but the service was really bad. He said ""talk to me, tell me everything"" We told him everything. He said ""they are trying to protect me"" but they didn't try to have a good service to protect you from the bad review. We asked if he could take the gratuity out because there is no law to add gratuity in vegas anymore. he said it was in the system, then he handed us $20 to be a part of the gratuity we had to pay. The owner is really nice guy. One of our friends told him to the point ""we are not cheap. When we tip, we tip a lot. We are in service industrial too. We know what is good what is bad service."" We gave him his $20 back. Then he gave us a couple 20% discount cards and told us to come back. We felt like we could let this go and we wouldn't review anything, but we won't come back. 

Unfortunately, the server wouldn't let us go. We put all the money in. Of course we are pain in the ass when someone is a B to us. We paid the check with all $1 bills. she said ""Oh my god"" why? it is the money too!!!! we tipped you! because your employer is nice to us and he protects his employees! I told her ""we already talked to the owner"" 

****GUESS WHAT SHE TOLD US? SHE SAID ""it's ok. He is not the owner""**** 
They need to fire this girl. I feel bad for the owner or whoever he is. He could be a partner/a manager but he is her employer. He tried to protect her and took the money out of his pocket to help us pay for gratuity, but obviously she didn't protect him.

NOT done yet, we all were still sitting and eating after we gave her money. Only one of us had to stand up to hold her baby because she started crying. That server said to me ""everyone has to finish the rice"" more like yelled at me. I couldn't stand this anymore so I yelled back ""I AM STILL WORKING ON IT!"" god damn it! I didn't wanna finish my mackerel and rice anymore. We just walked out right after. 2 bites of rice left they can finish it.",082wJ2cKw5SOg0UXaVNQMw,12,3,2,P-g4NrNY3iRPabXobSf6Jg

I had it for the first time coming back from a 3 day camping/hiking trip to Zion, and let me tell you. We killed it. It was so good that I went again the very next week while I was in Vegas... But it's so good! And so close to the strip.

Honestly I would put it on same the level as Bacchanal. I know they're totally different, but on my scale of buffet/AYCE choices... Umiya is pretty up there with Bacchanal. Hands down better than Wicked Spoon. 

The UNI... So good. But sadly its limited to one order.. So is the SWEET SHRIMP, AJ SAUCE TUNA. All the ones labeled 1D. But that just means you know it's bomb! So order all them 1Ds. 

They have ramen too and it's pretty good. Pretty large selection in sushi, rolls, and appetizers. TUNA SALAD, SUNRISE ROLL, FIRST KISS ROLL, PORK BELLY, BAKED MUSSELS, ETC! They let you get half orders of rolls too so you can try as many as you want.

Oh and don't forget the green tea mochi icecream and green tea tempura for dessert. :)

They have a huge screen showing a mix of Kpop and top20s style music videos on one wall and then a TV with like some random news channel on the opposite wall. So just a warning, whichever side of the table you end up choosing on... You will have a very different scenery for the next 1.5hrs. Because that's the time limit; you'd think that's enough time, but it goes by pretty quickly!

The fish was fresh and flavorful, the service attentive, and there's a decent menu selection for AYCE. Excited to have found a great new sushi place, I went back to try the lunch specials, which were also great. However, over the last few months the quality and service have taken a nosedive. 

A friend and I were in on a Sat night for AYCE dinner. We were seated promptly even though it was somewhat busy, but we hadn't even got our coats off before someone came to take our order. Clearly not ready yet. Then, when we were ready, despite the army of staff, no one came. I'll spare the extensive list of service fails throughout the evening, but it's really the service that is earning the 2 star rating here. Basically, we didn't get what we ordered the first time, were unable to get someone to take a follow up order, had food thrown down on the table by servers on their way to somewhere else, and were overcharged. To top it off, the fish was bland and the portion sizes had shrunk from previous visits. I'd rate the food about 2.5 stars. Time to scratch this one off the list.

The price was pretty decent (around $8-$15 per dish) but we had to go for an all you can eat deal since it would be a better deal for us and it sure was! The server was very friendly and provided us with a great service with a big smile on his face. He recommended us with all these great dishes that were on the menu. The food were incredibly awesome!! The chef is a truly master chef! Every dish that came out was a piece of art! He greatly dedicated his time and his master sushi chef skills in making our food looks to pretty and artsy. We were blown away by his creativity and his fast cooking skills.

Conclusion:
At the end I would definitely recommend all my friends and family to try out this new all you can eat sushi restaurant. It is a great bang for the buck$$!

Pros: 
- All you can eat dinner for $26! We had (for apps): fried oysters, soft shell crab, pork belly and gyoza. All delicious! We ordered 4 half rolls and 1 full roll (all great!). Then 2 mochi (awesome!) and 2 tempura ice cream. Walked away pretty full and very satisfied (not stuffed and uncomfortable). In summary, the food was great as expected. 
- Food arrived timely
- Service was good 
- Noise level = good! Not too quiet but great for conversation 
- We didn't have to wait for a table at 6:30pm on a Friday in December

Cons: 
- The waitress literally warned us that they would charge us for food not eaten even if we said we ""didn't like the roll"" :-X I understand what they are trying to do here, but it was maybe too stern of a warning. I think instituting a ""no more than x rolls every x minutes per person unless the food is gone/eaten"" is perhaps a better way of getting people to not order a ton of food just because it's all you can eat.
- I'm nitpicking here, but I would like to see a larger selection of alcohol, especially beer. But this is an overall complaint of mine for most Asian cuisine restaurants so take it with a grain of salt 

Overall a great value and delicious food for Vegas. I always complain that it's hard to use Yelp in Vegas because everything is rated 3.5 stars or higher. I've been to Vegas 5 times and this place, in my opinion, is above average! Check it out if you don't mind going off the strip!",Ifm9hXsiQR3TZdZZZkS0Tw,0,0,4,2FALtmEyVPksIyqSGh_nTA

My favorite nigiri here are unagi, salmon, giant clam, yellowtail, halibut, garlic tuna, and sweet shrimp. I'm not much of a roll eater, but I highly recommend the Rattle Snake Roll and the Touchdown Roll. Best of all, mochi ice cream is included in ayce, so many sushi restaurants don't. Overall, this is my favorite sushi restaurant for ayce!

I also threw a birthday party here once and they brought out a plate with ice cream and mochi decorated with whipped cream and caramel syrup and it was so nice of them.

Staff was very attentive, constantly refilling drinks, taking orders often (good for AYCE, because you can keep asking for more and not worry about time!!). 

The food came out fast, tasted amazing, and they didn't even charge us for leftovers like at a usual AYCE. I had never experienced much sushi beyond a few basic Cali-rolls and I think this was a game changer on my opinion of seafood!!

1126382,2015-06-03,0,q-zZgXKAQFLEgMp9ZNllgQ,"First time ever coming here with a friend's recommendation. Have to say I'm not a fan. Came in with my boyfriend and his friends. There are basically 3 rules when eating here.
1) if you have all you can eat you can ONLY share with people who eat all you can eat. 
2) if you don't finish they will charge you extra. 
3) if there is a (1) next to the food you can't share it. 

The food- not the greatest sushi I have had. It was decent. Had the caterpillar and it was complete mush. Any sushi roll we tried picking up with the chop sticks came apart instantly. 

The service- everyone seems like they are in a rush here. They sit you down and rush you to get out. When they drop off the food they say it completely fast and literally run off. The WORST of it was the MANAGER. Her name is ASHLEY! She was completely RUDE. Any time she reached over she would elbow you in the face and walk off. She hit our friend twice in the face hard. When she dropped the food off she said everything fast and tried to run off. When we stopped her to repeat thinking it wasn't out food she says it again and laughs at us in a mocking way. We asked our server who the manager was and he said that Ashely was. We were shocked and in disbelief. We couldn't believe a manager would treat us like this. 
I wanted to give this place a rating of 0 but our server TAYLOR changed my mind. He was friendly and made us all laugh and took his time with us when we were having problems deciding what we wanted to eat. We all hoped he was the manager or we want him to be promoted because he was professional and caring. 

All and all I would never come back here again. I would recommend going to Oyshi on Sahara and Tenaya instead if you want good sushi and better service.",tXOs5gth5L84aByvvfnwKA,0,0,1,BSvek-DECHS6fInzZPxXMg

Service and employees where attentive and prompt. Food was not the greatest but definitely delicious (4 stars when it comes to food)

My experience changed when I was treating my guest to dinner. 199 to be exact. 
I left my card with the server and waited to receive my receipt. This is when one of the employees comes back to the table and ask ""who does this card belong to"" capturing everyone's attention. That's when the employee said loudly ""your card is declined."" I was speechless and felt uneasy because of how it made me look really bad. It seemed like the employee was happy to say it was declined. 

I called my bank and they said they did not receive a decline and to have them try again. So I went up to clear up the situation and fix what happened. I saw with my eyes the card declined and had to use another card. 

Anyway, I asked for a manager which seemed like a young kid compared to the gentlemen that embarrassed me. When I explained what happened he told me in a calm not really caring voice sorry. He said he will talk to the employee. I felt like no justice was being served so I mentioned I will just leave a Yelp review about my experience. He just smiled and continued with business.

So I went back to my table to ease my guest and let them know the bill was paid. As we were leaving the young manager tried to apologize and made up an excuse to say his English was ""bad"" and that he will have a discussion with the staff. The employee even used broken English to say sorry.... here the crazy part. The same employee that was using broken English was pronouncing ""who does this card belong to"" and the word ""decline"" in perfect English. Maybe dropping the YELP hint changed his heart to make discipline sound more serious. It was too late after giving you the first opportunity to fix it. 

I would have given this establishment a 5 start rating until what happened at the end. 

All my friends agreed that this place was great until the employee changed the whole mood.

This place wasn't too far from home and had great reviews, so it was a no brainer.

Appetizers: Baby Octupus Skewer, Bacon Scallop Skewer, Tuna Poke, Mushroom boy, and Crispy Rice with Spicy Tuna.

All delicious. Highly suggest them all.

Mushroom boy is a deep fried mushroom filled with cream cheese and spicy tuna. No further explanation necessary.

On to the rolls.....

Philly Roll, Hawaiian Roll, Chicken Teriyaki Roll, and Vegas Lasagna.

Normally, there'd be another roll and 2-3 nigiri orders but. We tapped out. Today our bellies could not withstand AYCE as usual. But it's all good. We'll be back for sure to try everything else we missed!!

The service was very quick and on cue. Always ready to serve you and refill your drinks and take your plates.

Ambiance is laid back and cool. Love the bar and how big it is. Plenty of space for the 96 rolls you're gonna order.

They have some amazing sauces on their stuff, and just enough.

They have the news and sports on while playing top 40/EDM

This place used to be the old sushi Kaizen. Never been to that one so I would have nothing to compare it too.

Came here with a pretty large group, and suffice to say, the service was excellent. The server did a great job taking the orders and made sure that each person got the correct dish, even while she was taking care of other tables as well. I also liked how we were able to order from the runners and bussers when she was busy.

Food wise, everything was mediocre to OK. One thing I had to mention was that the rice wasn't really good, it tasted like it had been refrigerated or undercooked. It was weird. The fish quality tasted average at best. As many of people have mentioned, they make the rolls and nigiri pretty fast here, but presentation isn't really their strong suit. And, they are pretty heavy handed with the sauces. I did like the chicken katsu roll, something that I have never had before. But, don't be fooled by the miso or tonkatsu ramen that is on the menu. It isn't late night Goyemon's. I ordered the miso ramen and it was their regular miso soup with instant ramen noodles LOL.

Everything on the menu is available for all you can eat, unlike some places that have a separate AYCE menu.  There are also the standard exceptions of a few items that you can only get one order per person.  

I usually habit Goyemon, but wanted to try something different today. I dragged a few friends along, and this place really hit the spot for everyone. Fish was really fresh. We had giant clam, uni, sweet shrimp, oysters, baked mussel, yellow tail, salmon, soft shell crab, a bunch of rolls.... And much more. They were all delicious! Definitely would recommend the Snow White roll, the spicy tuna rice cracker and the Seared tuna with AJ sauce.  The spicy garlic edamame was great too.

Only complaints are that the agedashi tofu did not have much broth - basically fried tofu with a little sauce on it, and the ahi poke had too much sesame oil that you could barely taste the fish.  Also, drinks are not included.  I had to pay extra for hot tea ($1.75).   And they were out of a few dishes like yellow tail collar and scallops.  Also limited to one dessert per person and no stamp cards.

What I can say that stood out was the fact that they had skewers in their AYCE and man did we order a bunch of the bacon wrapped scallop skewers. They were A-MAAZING. They put a little too much eel sauce on it, but I got over that quickly.

Baked mussels were alright, when they reached us, they weren't super hot. 
I didn't like the fresh oysters we got, they tasted really fishy and straight from the ocean. But hooray they are included in the AYCE. 

I really like crispy rice, the texture is so chewy and crisp, I love it. They have a crispy rice tuna appetizer, which I loved so much, that we ordered 2 orders of it. 

We ordered a TON of sushi rolls. They were all made to perfection. Baked rolls were  baked perfectly and delivered hot. While the regular rolls weren't wrapped with too much sushi and were bite size and they looked like they were delicately rolled. 

I recommend getting the **snow white roll** and the **orange blossom roll** 

I also ordered a mackerel at the end of all of our sushi roll rounds which was a mistake because it was a hearty portion. They give you the WHOLE mackerel. 

Dessert option is kinda bleh, as you only get ONE from the entire dessert list. It's your average dessert list from sushi restaurants (ie: tempura ice cream, mochi, etc)",u0bAtrQrgEoHjFybAl9FeQ,3,2,4,u5V1in_Bg0LFnl75R1nnFA

It was my first time and my sister thought I'd the place better. She was right as usual. Umiya was located in a small Japanese plaza right next to a starbucks. As soon as I walked in, the cool ambience and decor already began to soothe my hangry (hungry × angry) mood. Our server Jay was polite and got us our drinks quickly. He took our orders promptly and our first dish came out in less than 10mins! Every dish we tried was very good. Although, we didn't order many rolls because we thought it would fill us quickly, between the three of us, we ordered a lot of food. I felt like I was at an expensive course menu restaurant. I ended up having 5 courses in total with a tempura ice cream dessert. Jay probably refilled my diet coke 10 times which I appreciated as it was a seperate cost (even though with a check-in on yelp you get a free soda!). All in all, this is the evolution of Las Vegas buffets. All you can eat Japanese buffets have been popping up and all I could think was..how could the owner afford to keep this place? The quality of the food was outstanding, everything came out cooked-to-order, and service was 5 stars. The establishment was clean, the ambience would be great for a date, and also suitable for business meetings or hangover cures in the low light tents they have set up. Excellent Gem of a restaurant. I really don't understand why this joint wasn't busy while Goyemon was packed.

Maybe the kitchen was low in staffing since it took them about 15 minutes to get a few small plates out. The service was poor since they never filled our drinks and kept forgetting our dishes/giving it to another table. You have to be careful and remember what limited items you order. They are not organized with the orders at all and tried to tell me that I had ordered the limited items already. I know I've ordered it but it didn't go to my table. Once or twice I will understand but 4 times and telling me it was delivered, I really think it's their fault now. For example: When I ordered the uni and the sweet shrimp together they would bring out the sweet shrimp and not the uni. So I asked about the order and was told it's out already. Same thing with the single baby octopus, amaebi head, 2 rolls were not received but ordered. The food was 3.5 stars. Nothing I would crave or come back for. It's just an average sushi spot.

 The service was fast and came to check on us every now and then to ask if everything was good. Would love to give my experience 5 stars but I felt a little unwelcomed when I was being served. I did not care so much for the underwhelming service because I was hungry. it was ending lunch when we had come in so I assumed they were all ending their shifts so they must have been tired.

it's worth it.. i consider this place much better than its competition of goyemon, kaya and jjanga

this is an elite ayce experience",UXd56jH3f76kppekXqui9g,0,0,5,56upp1wppJHCC_V_tCD3Uw

Almost everyone got AYCE. After the waiter took our order, we waited for a long time for our food to come out. Besides our table, there were about 4 other small tables. Not so busy. One of us ordered Chicken Katsu, he waited 40 minutes for it to come out while the rest of us ate our sushi. It should not take that long for them to make chicken katsu unless they had to hunt a chicken down, skin it, THEN cook it. The service was terrible, the quality of the sushi seemed like they pre cut it. I tend to stay within my usual ayce sushi places but since this was for my friend's 20th birthday we all tried it out. 
The only reason why I'm not giving it a 1 star because of this one waiter, unfortunately I didn't get his name but he looked Korean and he had a cross necklace. He was the only waiter who provided us with good service. The other workers had attitude and one female worker with red hair accidentally hit my friend on the head with a plate and he did not get an apology.

The waitress was quick to take our drink order. As she was doing this, another server came to take our food order. I really need to become better at getting the servers names. There was just such a team effort and they were all moving so fast that it was difficult to pinpoint one. 
The food began to present itself and they did not miss a beat. We had a table of 9 and not one item was missed. I have a habit of letting everyone order before me as a courtesy. That tends to get my order last and by that time, everyone has already eaten. It was a pleasant surprise to receive my food so that I could enjoy it with the rest of the party. The faster we ordered, the quicker the staff brought our food. The drinks never dried up and I was pleased with the overall experience.

1865209,2017-01-08,14,q-zZgXKAQFLEgMp9ZNllgQ,"I initially blew off Umiya due to the location. It's so close to the Strip, I figured half the high ratings were due to tourists from landlocked midwestern cities trying AYCE sushi for the first time without any frame of reference. A friend pulled me aside and told me to check myself, and insisted I go try it ASAP.

And the reviews are right, this place is awesome. I'm happy to eat my words, along with a large assortment of apps, small plates, grilled items, skewers, nigiri, rolls, and desserts. The menu has nearly anything you could ask for, and everything was done well from the baby octopus skewers to the macaron desserts and all the sushi rolls in between. The rolls, and particularly the sauces, are where they stand above the crowd of other options in Vegas- try anything with the unique tangy sauce. Favorite rolls include the King of the Ocean and the Orange Blossom.

The tasty food comes with funky izakaya style decor and incredibly attentive service: they use a team approach, so anyone nearby will ask if you want to add any orders. Dishes were whisked away within seconds of the food atop them being consumed, drinks never got less than a two thirds full, sushi came out within a couple of minutes of being ordered, and everyone had a great attitude and a smile. 

In a city with so many sushi options that come and go or vary based on who is working behind the counter, Umiya is my new go-to. Whether you are going with traditionalists who order nigiri exclusively or those who love rolls or even one of those weirdos who don't like sushi at all, this spot will satisfy them all.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,27,22,4,xyHPuRuP4sJs-WNLqo-2Fw

I usually frequent Sushi House Goyemon whenever I have that sushi craving but this one is up there with it. There are somethings that are done better here than over there and vice versa but Umiya was a pleasant surprise. They have a huge selection and have a 90 minute time limit.

Highlights:
Crispy Rice with Spicy Tuna - OMG can I say that this was one of the best crispy rice and spicy tuna combos I have ever had. The rice was perfectly crispy and didn't overwhelm the spicy tuna. The Spicy tuna was perfect and had the right taste - I could taste the freshness of the fish.  I had two orders of these because they were THAT good.

Nigiri, Salmon and albacore - the fish was super fresh and exactly what I expected. They didn't overdo the rice like they do at other places so I am thankful for that. 

Agedashi Tofu - THE BEST AGEDASHI TOFU I'VE EVER HAD. Yes, I had to put that in all caps to emphasize how good it was. I had 4 orders. You heard that correctly. I know this is a sushi place but they do all of their other non-sushi dishes so well! The broth was delicious and the batter was light and crispy while the tofu was silken and melted in my mouth.

Spicy Tuna Salad - large chunks of tuna in a spicy sauce mix. Delicious! Too bad you can only order 1 of these per person.

The only negative thing I would have to say about this place is that they have more dishes that are only 1 per person (desserts, some sushi items, etc) than Goyemon and that they don't do half rolls (so I can't try as many rolls as I would if I were to go to Goyemon).

December 31st, 2015 at 4pm I walked in for all you can eat and absolutely did not appreciate my waitress's sassy attitude... After being seated she left us with the menus not asking if we wanted hot tea or water... 5 minutes later I wanted to leave once another customer opened the entrance door directly behind me I felt a cool breeze. I was at discomfort first the terrible greeting, no beverages, uncomfortable wooden chairs and negative feng shui. 

As I was waiting patiently and browsing through their menu my waitress came back asking if we were ready to order. Um sure how about I start off with my free drink please. I asked for green tea she said"" cold ""I said ""hot"" she said ""how about cold ""so I said ""okay cold"" assuming that the hot green tea is free refills... 

She then took down our order I got done with the first stage, went to the restroom and started throwing up. They forgot a couple of things I asked for and waited as I was receiving my second stage of order, I started to get very sore stomach ache after eating their hamachi and orange flower. I absolutely did not enjoy their sushi with any fish on it because it was NOT fresh... I should have stopped ordering knowing the fact my stomach was sore. Went to the restroom again then came back to my table and I'm not even half way done with my cold green tea she asked ""would you like a refill"" I said ""actually may I get hot green tea I'm not feeling very well"" she said ""it's extra charge but I can give to you this time because you didn't know."" I said ""thank you"".

I Drank my hot green tea as my stomach felt alittle at ease.... I finished my third stage of order because if you don't finish all of your food it is extra charge. I just felt even worse! Very sick... I spent my New Years in the hospital the entire day and night vomiting

1947501,2013-02-18,6,q-zZgXKAQFLEgMp9ZNllgQ,"I really dont like trying out new sushi places especially if the group going is in the double digit numbers. For one too many people make a lot of issues with the wait staff as well as the kitchen. Sushi is a made to order type of dining experience and is best with just a handful of people. So far off the top of my head there's one place *cough*GOYEMON*cough that can handle an entire private room full of diners and not miss a single order as well as another *cough*KOMA*cough* where the waitress will go out of her way to remind and boss the sushi chefs to push the orders and correct mistakes. 

So this was Chad's UYE and he threw up a whole bunch of recommendations on what we should all try out with the AYCE menu. Sure this sounds great and all but....

Problem is i didnt receive over half of the initial order i put in the beginning, eventually one out of many came but it was so late in the game i didnt really care about it any more. As for the others such as the oysters and the baby octopus...i guess they've gone through the doorway into Narnia out to take the one ring to Mt Doom before the Death Star blows up the planet because they sure as hell weren't anywhere in front of me or anywhere near me...

Service was...typical of any Asian restaurant. For being known as a hard working people, servers are fucking lazy...When we tell you in the beginning we want SEPARATE CHECKS it doesn't mean put everything one bill and let us play the 'oh well on the back of the receipt we put our names and how much we want charged to the card. oh wait we dont know how to divide up the service charge, the tax and everyone's individual drinks...oh my god this is getting complicated'. Server offered to split everything up and brought us back SEPARATE checks with all the tax and mandatory 18% all split up. Wow thanks bro you brought us what we originally asked for after you determined what a pain in the ass it was bringing an undivided check...Stupid of us to ASK for SEPARATE checks in the BEGINNING. 

Drinks were okay, I had 3 Sakeinis which our server assured me was on the buy two get one free deal and they were. The best tasting was the Lychee one. Perfectly balanced between booze and Lychee flavor. The Peach and Pineapple were so bland and tasteless i might as well been drinking a bud lite. Not to say that both these drinks tasted like bud lite, i just mean there was no harmony no balance between the natural or artificial flavors of the fruit to match or complement the flavored sake they used.

As far as everything else food-wise i dont know i just dont know at all. Over half the things i ordered never got delivered. Most of dining experience was grabbing bits and pieces from others around me. Noticeably the spicy yellowtail hand roll was absolutely amazing when i first ordered it. They did it Goyemon style where it was chunks of yellowtail with spicy sauce drizzled all over it. It was so good or i havent had one in so long what ever it was pretty damn good so i decided to order another which was on par with the first as well as a spicy tuna hand roll. Wow the tuna was an epic fail in my opinion. Both the yellow tail and tuna were ordered as hand rolls, both were ordered spicy...yet two VERY different things were delivered other than the type of fish. As stated before the yellowtail was cubed and had sauce poured on top. The tuna was...minced into a paste with hot sauce and visible chunks of chilies in the mix. Totally not what i was expecting and was a bit spicier than i was willing to put up with. Good thing LJ was around...Big up to LJ!!

For the most part a lot of the nigiri was decently fresh especially the yellowtail.

Overall...i dont know I wanna give this place another chance by coming back with a considerably smaller group...but...i know other places that do a considerably better job. 

Oh and dont get drunk here or try to get drunk here you might die of massive liver failure.

This little place ranks up there with some of the best AYCE I have encountered anywhere...and the $26/p is ridiculously cheap for the quality. 

The menu was very extensive, the quality was exceptional and the food came fast...like 3-minutes from ordering to your table fast! Plus their waiters were very attentive and would constantly check in on you if your plates were getting empty. 

I don't give 5-Stars often, but this place deserves it! Check them out!",1jf-06oejKNpJKEGICLK3g,0,0,5,cYu7L4YMURv65qtER0iMAA

Upon walking in we were greeted in a prompt manner and sat immediately.  Our server asked if we wanted the all you can eat option and neither of us girls wanted to grub too crazy so we just ordered a few rolls each. As a starter we got a miso soup and patiently waited for 2 rolls. One of them was a dragon roll and the other was a salmon salsa roll. 
15 minutes later we finally got our rolls. And just as I was getting ready to get my chopsticks ready, I noticed something a little off about my roll. I took a closer look and guess what was in my roll? A hair. I immediately called for my server and told him there was something in my roll and that it looked like a hair. He then took my plate, took a quick look at it and said that he didn't notice anything. I then pointed out the hair that was protruding out of the baked eel dragon roll and he said... oh I see it now and quickly took it away. He then said he was making me a new one but by that time I was pretty over it.  And didn't want one to replace it all. I ate my other salmon salsa roll thing and when I finished they had brought me a new eel roll but I asked them to take it back because I was kind of grossed out. 
Our server seemed sorry about it.  And he comped us a mochi that we had ordered towards the end of the meal. However, I was really thrown off. He also gave us a card that gives us 2 free drinks with the purchase of $35 or more but I highly doubt I would ever go back.

We have tried several places, and Umiya is definately a step above the rest. The interior is warm and inviting. You are immediately greeted by the friendly hostess and sushi chef. There is seating either at the sushi bar, or traditional table seating for large groups, there is also tables available for couples. The AYCE option is the best value. Lunch is $22.95. The menu has a wide variety to choose from including lunch specials you can find their menu on usmenuguide.com/umiya-las-vegas.html. We have had different salads and starters such as Cucumber salad, Poke, Edamame(spicy or garlic spicy), Gyoza, Rib-eye steak, Japanese steak, paired with an excellent steak/teriyaki sauce, Bacon wrapped scallop skewers, marinated pork belly, and New Zealand green mussels. The Nigiri is very good, the fish is super fresh with just the right amount of sushi rice. The Rolls are simply the best I've had, because of how they are made. The rice they use is japanese sushi grade, and the chef uses just the right amount. They are rolled tight and never fall apart in your soy sauce as has been the case at other establishments. The sauces are a whole other story. Simply the best I've ever had. They are flavorful, not drenched just the right amount of sauce to compliments the roll, and use different sauces for each roll, complex in flavor and taste. Just makes you want to try everything on the menu. The food comes out fast and with excellent service. You also have 90 minutes to eat the AYCE. Most AYCE sushi restaurants only allow 45 minutes to an hour for lunchtime. Looking forward to also trying their AYCE dinner menu and sake and saketini cocktails which we haven't gotten around to yet.

First, the menu is EX-TEN-SIVE. For an AYCE place to have this many choices (granted, some are 1X only) is mind-blowing. From the nigiri, to the appetizers, right on down to the mochi, you will be hoping for a second stomach by the time all is said and done. I certainly needed one!

I made the mistake of filling up on rolls instead of the fresh fish, I won't do that again. The albacore, salmon, oysters, filet, pork, octopus, whatever you want, it's delicious! The rolls were awesome too, but with such a huge selection you'll do better to keep those to a minimum. 

I did happen to ask for their hottest roll and they made one up that is now named after me (yeah, right). It was hot, spicy and delicious. I'm sorry, I ate so much last night I forgot what was in it, but I'm pretty sure it was basically seafood and avocado dipped in hot ass sauce. Whew!

The service was superb. I didn't wait for drinks or food for very long at all. I loved it! The place is also beautiful and big so bring a party, you'll enjoy the heck out of it!

Nigiri: A majority of what I order at AYCE is nigiri. Most of it was pretty fresh! The yellowtail was subpar, but the ika, halibut, uni, salmon, surf clams, sweet shrimp, and tuna tasted fresh. The oysters are especially fresh! The one thing that I didn't like at all was the rice. It's overcooked and doesn't go well with the fish. I've noticed that many Korean-owned sushi places don't get the sushi rice quite right. 

Rolls: The roll that stood out was the Kiss of Fire roll, which is great if you're a fan of spice. 

Appetizers: The bacon-wrapped scallop and octopus skewers were pretty good! The poke was really underwhelming, but I did just get back from Hawaii. 

Entrees: The udon is pretty good, but the ramen and yakisoba are really disappointing. Both lacked flavor and the necessary consistency. 

Service: What bumped up my review from three to four stars! They're really attentive and friendly! They constantly check up on you and don't avoid you like they do at mos AYCE sushi places I've been to.

Right when I saw ""Free mug for a Yelp review"" I knew this place was a fake trap. 

When we came in, we were not noticed for a good 5 minutes. Just standing waiting for anyone to help us. 

When we were finally seated at the bar, we sat and waited for anybody to take orders for us. I asked the sushi chef if we order from him and he rudely told me he'll ask for the server. The staff were very RUDE and cold. Every time we tried to order, the guy would slam his notepad and say what do you want. They were so disorganized that they came up to us 5 times with food that wasn't ours. 

The nigiri was paper thin with a huge chunk of rice. The rice itself was so dry and tasted very off. The oysters were disgusting. I almost threw up trying to swallow it. With as much lemon and ponzu on the oysters, nothing can hide that foul dead ocean taste. The seafood ceviche was even weird tasting like it was old. There was random pieces of fish from idk what part of fish. The ribeye was JOKE! It was so dry and thin that it couldn't been ribeye. It had to be some cheap meat on sale at Smiths.

THE BEST PART. I ordered tuna roll and it was literally 5 percent fish and 95 percent rice. I couldn't help but laugh because I've never seen a roll like this in any sushi place in my life!! 

I also tried their ramen which was INSTANT RAMEN. I wish it said that or else I would of never ordered it. It's okay though, I used the ramen to hide my pitty tuna rolls in. 

I was so disappointed at this place that I didn't even brother with a second round of nigiri. Save your money and go else where NOW!",w15NByGsVedQLmpydJ7gPg,16,4,1,ihMnUXMa8Xgt2g4kn-KAnA

When I've gone on a Friday or Saturday night, they usually give an estimation of 30-45 minute wait; however, I've never waited more than 20 minutes or so. The all you can eat is a great deal. From my experience, it has the most appetizer items available as part of the AYCE menu. The udon soup is one of my favorites! As for the sushi and nigiri, it is absolutely delicious. I love how for most of their rolls, the sauce comes on the side, allowing you to decide how much to add to your roll rather than it being served smothered in sauce.  This is our go to place.

We had a big group so it took us a while to get seated. But once we got seated, our orders came out really quickly. We pretty much ordered everything on the menu and they all tasted pretty average except for the salmon skin. The salmon skin was burnt and we had to send it back. Avoid that if you can! Other than that, the fish to rice ratio was pretty good. It's nice when the piece of sushi hides the rice underneath it.

Yellowtail hand rolls were amazing with nigiri sized fish with minimal rice.

The AYCE selection is better than any other place in town and the dinner was $26.95 a person. The service was happy, and not snooty or too busy, even when it was. The seating was a bit more BBQ house type, but in all honesty, this did not matter to me. The sushi was fresh, the oysters were soooo good. It made me rethink Shuck's oysters and their quality. 
The bill was not split correctly, so double check as you should anywhere else, and head to this sushi house. The orange blossom and other rolls are good to try, but the nigiri is so good. Especially for being in the desert.

(1) service: slightly zealous server who wanted to know what we wanted right away(3) Value: there is no real positive value when your head is in the toilet (0)

Okay, it was my fault. After being without sushi for 3 months, I had a big craving. So after looking at the reviews online we settled at this place for lunch.

We came for lunch to check things out. We were kind of leery about making a huge commitment to ordering the AYCE option. First of all, we weren't that hungry and we had a Yelp event planned later in the evening. Secondly, the AYCE menu is $21 for lunch, consisted largely of carb heavy rolls and cooked items which didn't really appeal to us (there is no sashimi on the AYCE menu).

Our server was slightly overly attentive to the point where she was checking every 2-3 minutes of us getting seated to put in our order.

We ended up ordering 2 lunch specials. I got the sushi combo which comes with 4 pieces of nigiri and a choice of spicy tuna or California roll plus miso soup. ($10.95)The hubs got the bento box with a spicy tuna roll, tempura, salad and miso soup.($9.95)

Our food came out suspiciously fast - like definitely not in a good way kind of fast. Like literally within 5 minutes of getting our soup. 

The miso soup tasted like bilge water. The little tofu swimming in there looked like the dehydrated stuff you reconstitute from the small miso soup packets.

My sushi combo was supposed to be salmon, red snapper, tuna. The fish tasted very ummm...fishy in an unpleasant way with a slightly mushier texture than expected for sushi grade product. The rice was not seasoned well and was too firm. The maki spicy tuna roll incorporated way too much hot sauce so it suspiciously masked whatever flavor of fish that was in there. More on that later.

The hubs experience with his spicy tuna roll was the same as mine above. His tempura was overly battered and thick. The salad was a tad sweet but was otherwise okay.

Overall, at that point we were thinking 2 starred joint. Nothing too offensive, but not great either. Definitely not a repeat experience. We figured hey! it was only like a $10 meal per person and didn't set us back too much.

That is until we got home and the vomiting began. 

How I heaved into my toilet! Betwixt me and my beloved hubby, we were out for the count. We were totally bummed that we had to miss out on a Yelp event due to the the food poisoning.

At the time of writing this review, the bile is still rising in my throat from the thought of what I ate for lunch. Deep down, I think perhaps the spicy tuna is the culprit as it was the only common denominator for my hubs and I.

It on point tasty and delicious like everything else on the menu! The broth such nice depth of flavor unique taste unlike other true ramen restaurants. It little less salty then other places, the noodles solid, and AYCE just the right size portion have room for other stuff. 

Sushi Chef Alex is awesome. I was able too try some stuff not even on the AYCE menu. I had the black sea bass nigiri style, fresh eel (he showed me fresh eel; ever since my experience at Yummy feel sushi chef presents the fish see that quality adds personal touch) that never had before amazing, and even more AMAZING thing was the fresh Umi. Unfortunately again not on the AYCE but presented fresh UMI then he literally cut it open served order a la carte another table but kind enough make me one nigiri. Wow! If could get that kind of fresh Umi I would kill the whole population of Umi. Lol! Lunch is never that crowded really one of the best times too go. Truly one of my best sushi experience one that not only truly feel sushi chef Alex passion for sushi, the attention too service is on point (never have empty glass of soda or water), and all sushi chefs are easy too talk stories with just makes it that much more enjoyable.

It sounds like I'm being a diva, but it needs to be said! You can't happily eat your weight in AYCE sushi if your butt starts to hurt.

The food, though, is good. The sushi rice seemed to be lacking the vinegar, but it wasn't a huge deal considering this is an AYCE place. Service was quick and friendly. Nigiri is yummy but the rolls kind of all taste similar. There are a quite a few reviews on here stating that the seafood wasn't fresh, but I did not find that to be an issue on my visit. 

I think I have really high standards when it comes to sushi places, but this is a solid sushi spot and I'd be willing to come back again if I was in the area.",wai1J7wtI5Wp0DUwy3QG2w,5,2,4,PlfbztKfzC1into04UxmRA

2349947,2016-12-27,1,q-zZgXKAQFLEgMp9ZNllgQ,"When I saw a 4.5 rated AYCE sushi restaurant right across the street from our hotel, Palms, I knew my family and I had to go.

On weekends they open at 12, so my parents and I made it by 12:10. Good thing we came early, because this place gets PACKED! At 12:10, there was half of the room already full with more people flooding on in. There were only 2 servers during opening which made service really slow at first, however, once more servers started their shift, it got more consistent. One thing to keep in mind is that all the servers work together, you're not just assigned one. We totally kept trying to get the attention of the first person who took our drink orders before eventually realizing that every server attends to every table. Wooooopsss!! Don't make this mistake y'all, you'll save yourself a lot of frustration lmao.

$21 all you can eat sushi, yes plz. My parents and I ordered an assortment of items from both the sushi bar and the kitchen. There are some items that they only let each person order one of, but a majority of the stuff is free for all. Although the pieces weren't super fat, I was honestly impressed by the quality of the nigiri to the point were the slice size didn't bother me, especially since you could just order more. The salmon (sake) was extremely fatty which made it all the more delicious! DEFINITELY skip the seared albacore though. This was the one dish that I was very disappointed in. Other things I would recommend getting include the poke!! The tuna chunks were really thick and seasoned very well. I also really liked the grilled mackerel and grilled squid from the kitchen. Polished off our palettes with some yummy green tea ice cream too.

Overall, I really like Umiya. Except for the seared albacore, everything was fresh! Meats weren't as impressive (we got rib eye and pork belly), but it's always nice to have that option if you're craving a little bite of meat. There are tons of AYCE sushi options in Vegas, but I definitely feel like Umiya is one of the best, hands down. My only major comment would but that I feel like they should get at least ONE more server per lunch/dinner rush though. The servers are constantly running around and I feel bad for them!! They're working hard for sure.",p8VlaSVW1cLCNA9RHNP90w,6,1,4,zkMzoAvMZNj4zauFs3vANg

Food was fantastic as well. The tuna tataki is a must. Although it is listed as a one time item, I think I had about three rounds.

2388706,2013-03-03,0,q-zZgXKAQFLEgMp9ZNllgQ,"Another sushi restaurant in a city of plenty.  Umiya is located right next to Starbucks in a plaza off of Flamingo and Arville. It's a very nicely decorated sushi spot definitely the nicest, 5 star for just that. 

They offer a large AYCE menu of sushi and non-sushi items with a few items that you can only order one order of, as many other sushi restaurants do. Order the items that you can only order one order of and on chef's special menu first, just to get them out of the way.  They have a pork belly that could maybe rival Goyemon, maybe, I don't remember how Goyemon pork belly taste like again I need to go again soon. It's 3 delicious thinly sliced pieces of pork belly in a sauce that just melts in your mouth.  I made the mistake of sharing once, never again all mine.  They serve a fried soft shelled crab which was heavily battered which wasn't my favorite but it could be with less batter. Their baby octopus are very delicious. Their nigiris and hand rolls aren't that bad too.  Their beef was very good.  Oysters fried and not fried, poke salad, specialty rolls, deep fried tempura rolls, shrimp tempura, uni, everything you usually expect from a sushi spot they probably had it.

Drinks aren't included in the AYCE sushi price you pay extra, soft drinks were extra $2 but refill are included.  Also they no longer have AYCD on for extra $10 its something like buy 2 get the 3rd free for certain drinks. Know you limits when drinking they probably won't kick you out for being a drunken mess but it annoys everyone elses who are trying to have a nice meal with family and friends, especially if there in another party.

As always when going to a sushi restaurant sit at the bar right infront of the sushi chefs, you'll get food faster and chefs are usually pretty cool guys. Customer service was great but once if got busy they had a hard time keeping up with food and drink orders. Try not going when busy but if your patient enough like I am go whenever you feel like sushi. 

Their prices are average, sushi quality and selection good, but probably won't replace any of my top 5 but top 10 in Vegas sure.",vWP8-aQX0rYJszqkWVL7Ew,5,2,4,1pZrIZV3aBgg8qSs08HT5g

Service: For me, service is something that I cannot reiterate enough. It is the break or make it factor for me and sadly, the service can do a little bit of cleaning. I have been here a handful of times and I get the same service... rudeness. I am not sure if the servers are being purposely rude, but the last three times I have been there (less than a month), they have been rude. I was trying to order something at the bar one time and the lady who was taking care of our orders rudely said that she will come back to us and take orders from her other tables. I understand that me and my party was not ready, but she did not have to be rude and impatient. I was baffled by how she reacted to the situation with me and my party. Unfortunately, this is not the first time that has happened. I am constantly getting rude service. Also, I happen to get new servers every time I go there. I do not know who is taking care of me at the end of my experience.

Quality: The food and quality of fish is amazing. Even though I do not get service how I am used to getting, the food can help balance it. The seared tuna AJ fish is to die for! I constantly crave it and come back for it. They also have special yuzu hamachi nigiri and salmon belly. it tastes so good and so fresh I cannot have enough of it! They also have an array of sushi rolls, appetizers and other stuff that they have on the menu. They have a lot of things on their menu that a lot of other sushi restaurants set them apart.

Overall, I am very impressed with their menu. It really sets them apart from other sushi restaurants and they have their own style. However, service can be so much better. If all the servers were willing to give their 100% everyday no matter how late is or early, then this place would be my favorite places in Vegas. If they didn't have good items on their menu, I wouldn't be back because of their service.",SWCLYANLMiXiPhW0mzicVQ,2,2,4,vFhcs0x067PJNBnxA_QK7Q

We got there at 6 pm and the restaurant was nearly empty. The space itself is really pretty and open. We got drinks and our first orders in within a couple of minutes of being seated. Our rolls came super quickly, which continued throughout our meal, despite the restaurant getting much busier. Those familiar with AYCE know how important superfast ordering and delivery are!

The food was completely decent. The rolls themselves are on the small side, but very light on rice. I really liked the size, since each one takes up less belly real estate, so you can try more tasty things! The fish quality is average, depending on the roll (the salmon and ahi were great; the super white tuna was meh). As with a lot of sushi places with huge menus, the sauces on the rolls can be their downfall. There are many that come with spicy mayo, but they're easily avoided. 

The AYCE menu is enormous. There are lots of fresh, fried and baked rolls, plus nigiri, various non-fish items and dessert. It's $27 per person for dinner, with a HUGE 90 minute time limit. Umiya is definitely our new go-to on this side of town!",__RoSKn4Y5gImPoRkwJACQ,2,0,4,AJnk1HmUKkMe1LH-ZZpmmA

Second day I've rolled by there and they've been closed! AND I almost went to go try Korean Garden BBQ cuz they have a pretty cheap AUCE BBQ price but I quickly pulled up some reviews and they were weird. ANYHOO. This is what I stuffed into the fat girl stuck inside of my body:

Spicy Garlic Edamame - a little overcooked, some of the shells were downright MUSHY. The flavor was OK. A little spicy, but not much and the garlic flavor was rather mild. I LOVE garlic.

Marinated Pork Belly - I have been CRAVING pork belly lately! This didnt necessarily satisfy my craving either. The pork belly itself was melt in your mouth tender and the marination was aiight. Not bad at all - I am just personally craving some samgyupsol!

Grilled Shishito Peppers - served with Bonito flakes on the side. I always love shishito peppers but these could have use some togarashi!

Crispy SS Crab - I highly DON'T recommend this. Too much breading and not enough flavor. I even tried dipping it in some spicy mayo but ended up just leaving the other half, untouched. 

Baked New Zealand Mussel in Dynamite Sauce - these were good. Nothing stuck out about them but they werent bad at all.

Seafood Dynamite - good as well. Typically these taste the same wherever I get them. Not bad at all.

Tuna Poke - this was REALLY good! A little seaweed salad on the side and just enough seasoning and spiciness to leave me wanting more!

Jalapeno Popper - spicy tuna and cream cheese inside the jalapeno and deep fried. Um. No. I ate one out of the four. Just not a good combination and really not much flavor. They probably deseeded the jalapeno taking all of it's delicious spiciness with and the half way cooked spicy tuna inside wasn't cuttin it. Besides, COOKED spicy tuna is NOT something I EVER look forward to.

The Nigiri I tried was: 
Tuna, Albacore, Super White Tuna, Salmon and Yellowtail. ALL of it was VERY good. Very fresh tasting and fatty and melt in your mouth. The Albacore was kind of fishy but that just might be how the fish is suppose to be. I'm not a fan of really fishy tasting fish, but some people are! 

Anyway I finished off my meal with a salmon and avocado hand roll and a banana split!!!! I love handrolls and this one did not disappoint! Really good quality fish! 
And my banana split was a nice small personal size - just a scoop of vanilla with a banana and some chocolate syrup. Simple and tasty.

My boyfriend and I enjoy eating fresh fish, nigiri and trying a few appetizers when we dine at AYCE sushi restaurants, unfortunately the nigiri and appetizers here do not shine. The fish to rice ratio is inconsistent. The sushi rice was undercooked and compacted under paper thin slivers of raw fish. After a couple nigiri my stomach felt dense and full. That's not a good feeling or a good value. 

There were a few fish we tried that were extremely enjoyable and sweet such as the albacore and salmon; but the paper thin sliver made it difficult to really enjoy the quality of fish. We actually sent back the salmon belly because it was offensively fishy and old.  

I also felt very limited with the appetizer selection, some items were sized too large for us to feel comfortable ordering and the others were just not desirable. 

Here are some appetizers that were enjoyable: 
Miso Soup
Baked Mussels
Tuna poke
...that's it?

Pass on these:
Jalapeño popper (super dense and crazy filling with ok flavor)
Fried soft shell crab (all soggy batter)
Most nigiri...

I suggest going to Sakana (on Maryland) for fresh fatty cuts of fish on their nigiri with a generous fish to rice ratio, a big flavorful selection of appetizers and also creative, juicy rolls.",u_wqt9RshdZsoj8ikLqoEQ,11,4,2,YIQJ5FW-pYO_u4LNNZNHyA

Outside, it is on a barren road. There is a parking lot and several other Japanese restaurants nearby. Parking should not be a problem. There are plenty of spaces to park.

 Inside, it is dark. It feels like it is nighttime once you enter. There is a bar to the right and sushi station. The tables are wooden in the middle and have wooden benches. On the sides are small regular tables and chairs surrounded by willow, tree-like strands. To the left of the entrance is an Asahi alcoholic station. I'm not much into alcoholic drinks, but people would probably like it. There are restrooms in the back and no free wifi. 

 The service was pretty bad to be honest. The servers were bored and never smiled while serving me. But, the service came by at about the 5-10 minute mark. 

 The food is very good,  high quality and fresh. I felt it was one of the best I have ever eaten. We happened to order the all you can eat. I felt it was expensive but, you get what you pay for here. The all you can eat for adults at dinner time which is after 3pm-2am everyday costs us $25.95 a person. The lunch was cheaper at about $20.95, this option is only open from 11am-3pm. The rules are: no leftovers or you pay extra, you only get 90 minutes to eat and no sharing. I found this out the hard way at another sushi restaurant. This is standard for most, if not all sushi places. 

 The prices are high for majority of their items on the regular menu. At least for the good entrée items, it ranges from $12 and up. Overall, my experience here was great. I felt that the service let me down and all you can eat prices were a little on the rough side, but felt it was worth the try.I",o1QAhT9-HOVzyso46he00w,37,23,4,jWCfDr0v5VFA7MHhrzcsZg

I ordered a few of the popular rolls such as: King of the ocean, Kiss of fire, First kiss, sunset, sunrise, rainbow, firecracker, etc. also ordered a bunch of nigiri. 

I honestly wasn't too impressed with the fish. It wasn't as fresh as I would have hoped. And the flavors didn't go as well either. There was one roll I got called Seafood Volcano Roll and it was a bit of a mess. There was a lot of things going on with it. It had mushrooms which I thought was a bit out of the ordinary but didn't go very well with the fish. 

I ordered a spicy seafood salad, which I thought was really good. It had a lot of fish in it and the dressing was just right. They have a variety of mochi ice cream flavors which was appreciated but of course it is just 1 order per person. I tried their plum wine flavored ice cream which I really thought was delicious!

First off, their menu is highly incorrect. I asked for seared salmon. Both times it was taken out and guess what...???? It wasn't even seared. Seared salmon is torched and becomes a light pink. Each time the ""seared salmon"" came out it was raw. After explaining to the waiter that this is not seared for the third time, he never returned to the table. I don't believe that's how the customer service industry works. It took over 30 mins for someone to bring us our bill. My date had to get up 2x to ask for the check. If he didn't get up, how long would it have taken? Hmmm....
The food was so so. Tempura calamari, I would not recommend. Crispy rice with spicy tuna was alright, not the best. Chicken skewer tasted like a McDonald's chicken nugget. Enjoyed my miso soup, and cucumber salad, which explains the sushi was not good or fresh tasting.

I like AYCE sushi for variety and this place has it. 

I went in specifically intending to eat a bunch of non sushi. 

I'm gonna skip most of the obvious good stuff

The ramen isn't as bad as the other reviews suggest. I got the tonkotsu. I enjoy good ramen. Ramen sora is my go-to. This isn't amazing ramen but given the choice between plain miso and this porky treat, I'm going porky treat every time, babe. 

The house salad is so good. Always get two orders. Quality dressing and ingredients. Comes with a slice of avocado. I haven't had a house salad this dope at any other restaurant I've been to. 

Fish Katsu is some choice, moist, crunchy goodness. I'm typically not a fan of mayo. I'd still recommend getting it on the side but it goes well with the fish. Sprinkle some of that shichimi on that mayo and *muah*(is that the kissy noise?) I was in love. 

So obvious stuff, pork belly, sushi, skewers are a good time. I'm not very refined when it comes to these things but this was definitely worth the price. 

I had to give it five cuz I was so happy with the my orders but the service ain't necessarily top notch. It's a common complaint with sushi places. I don't know if I was being unreasonable but it took a really long time to get another house salad after asking for it. Maybe this is a quality takes time situation, but I just expect an order of salad to have a pretty quick turnaround time. Easy fix. Just request two orders right off the bat.

The nigiri is fresh and served with very little rice.

Tips:
1. Go with at least 3 friends if you can. That way you can share food as a table instead of trying to eat something all by yourself. You can try more this way.
2. Don't order rolls that have 8000 pounds of rice! You'll be full super fast like the rookies at our table.
3. Order everything on the limited menu/special. Make sure you order those things as they are limited for a reason! 
4. Eat the fried shrimp heads! 

Stay away from some things like:
1. The iced tea. It tastes weird and like it's from fountain concentrate, not fresh.
2. The fried calamari. It's fish cake-based, not actually squid.
3. Fried banana ice cream. Not tasty.
4. Green tea mochi. Tastes cheap and actually floral.
5. Ramen. It's a throw away of stomach space and not exactly a ramen shop.

No reservations unless it's a party of 6 or more, so time your trip appropriately.
You get 90 minutes to eat. We were initially worried it would take forever to get food, but our server was the absolute shit! We slammed him with the world's largest order and then told him ""we trust your judgment"" about anything he wanted to add. Our food came out so fast at 8PM on a Sunday right after we ordered. 

If you want the most chill, AWESOME server, get the guy with sideswept hair. I want to say he's Filipino or SE Asian. (Bro, I'm so sorry if you're not, but everyone there is Asian, so I don't know how to describe you. You deserve big money, and I hope people throw tons of it at you.)

3023855,2017-01-11,2,q-zZgXKAQFLEgMp9ZNllgQ,"Never realized that there was a hidden gem down the street from my house! Plenty of parking in the plaza, but it has few street lights and looks kind of sketchy from the outside. But never judged a book by its cover because the insides atmosphere is sort of like a club! Good music and dim lighting! I felt super rushed eating because I felt that all the servers were running around. Food came out quickly and dirty plates were taken away promptly. 

I like the appetizer options here as they offered a lot of things you wouldn't normally see in other sushi restaurants, at least none of the ones I have been to! My friends gobbled a plate of shishito peppers (limit one order per person), the plate had quite a few peppers on them. I did not try them but my friends said they're good, and taste like bell peppers.

THE GOOD: 
- oysters (limit one order per person). Quite meaty and clean! I didn't have a mouthful of sand or bits of sand in my mouth after eating it. We were all surprised at how big the oysters were.
- baby octopus skewers. They literally give you a tiny one
- soft shell crab. I was surprised at how good this was! You can literally eat the entire thing without having to spit anything out. We wanted to order more since it's limit one per person I think, but we were saving room for our rolls. 

THE EHH
- chicken skewers look nothing like the picture on the menu. There were hardly any vegetables on the skewer. Maybe one piece of onion or bell pepper to separate the chicken pieces. 
- Ginkgo has a lot of Heath benefits and it came in a bowl with about 10 or so. Tasted sort of like boiled peanuts
- bacon scallops. They gave us 2 pieces and the bacon was too crispy/overdone. 

I'D SKIP
- mussels were overcooked and a bit too chewy IMO. 
- yuzu ceviche (limit one per person): I would not order this again. The fish pieces tasted really off and they were kind of mushy. 
- ribeye was very small. We got 4 small slices and it was over cooked. 

You can't go wrong with any of their rolls but the nigiri had way too much rice. I'm used to 1/3 of the rice they out in the nigiri but the quality of the fish wasn't bad. Our favorite was the eel and salmon belly. 

Their dessert options are kind of limited. They offer tempura ice cream (green tea or vanilla) which is a single scoop of ice cream. It's not very big, so I would recommend not sharing! They also offer different mochi ice cream flavors including red bean, green tea, strawberry and others. And, ice cream scoops as well. 

If the rice ratio is a big deal for you then I wouldn't recommend coming here. But the upside is that they do offer a variety of appetizers and the food comes out super quick! Plus service is great.",ukkRTJLkQTx95fCalVn6BA,5,3,3,VzZF6reEjgRwpJg5dZlakQ

But one Friday night, my wife and I were looking for an AYCE sushi spot and we saw this place and everywhere else was a crazy 1-1.5 hr wait.  So we decided to try the place out.  We immediately took to it because of the atmosphere and it was spacious.  It wasn't crowded nor was the place like most sushi spots where it's small and compact and there's barely any room to walk on. 

The staff was very friendly and warm.  The menu is very extensive! It actually has 4 whole pages of food, including a huge amount of foods that aren't seafood-ish.  I know many people would say, ""why go to a sushi spot and not eat seafood or sushi?""  Well some people have something called ""allergies"" and we don't want them excluded, especially since I have a brother who is allergic to shellfish and a nephew who is allergic to freshwater fish.  So, it was really awesome that they had plenty of great choices for those who cannot enjoy certain aspect of sushi eating.  Including steak, teriyaki, noodles, beef, pork and chicken dishes.  

My favorite is Snow White and the Ono nigiri.  But. their Tuna sashimi w/ AJ sauce is to die for.  My wife loves the oysters and she said that their uni is very fresh.  The food is just all around very good, fresh and well prepared.

The server came to check on us very often, and the sushi rolls are served just few minutes every time after we ordered.

3033556,2017-08-18,2,q-zZgXKAQFLEgMp9ZNllgQ,"I came here with my brother, my son and niece last week some time. Me and my brother have different preferences in places to go for sushi. He named this one and Oyshi. I picked this place because it had a higher rating. Of course he likes to be opposite than me, he thinks Oyshi is better and doesn't believe in ratings lol. I personally love Sushi Hero and their ratings reflect it. I started at Yama on Flamingo, then to Sakana. Anyway, let's talk about Umiya...
I tend to get more of the kitchen stuff now rather than the rolls, and I love the kitchen food here. I always need my fresh oysters, shrimp tempura, seafood salad or some sort, baked mussels and Tako. This place has Fish Katsu and I was like o_O OMG, it was heaven to just have it on the  menu and even a higher place in heaven was the taste. Their Sashimi that you can get in the AYCE was delicious as well. Too bad it was only 1 order per person. 
Now to the ""negatives"". 
1.They seem to focus too much on making sure you only ordered the ""1 order per person"" once, that when my brother ordered the 2 sashimi orders (for him and his daughter, I went to order it and she said we already had two orders. I said ""we have 4 people"". And when my brother ordered the fresh oysters for me, because he doesn't like it, he was worried they would see me eat it. I hope they don't trip about that because we paid for 4 AYCE so no matter who eats the 1 order per person stuff, we can get 4 orders. So don't trip on little things like that for the price we're paying. 
2. I know it was a little busy but if you're gonna put a time limit, you should make sure you're  fully staffed enough so people can get their orders in. There was a point in time neither of us 4 had any food to eat LOL. First world problems, I know..but still...Time is money. 
All in all, I'd go again. I'd probably just sit at a table next time, since I really just like sitting at the bar if we can order directly from the chef. You don't really do that here. Okay bye.",nbhr-alrwRnj8hovMuFyEQ,1,1,3,2uQRy1srPZAv26pnghETIw

The moment my sister and I entered the restaurant, it was quite busy so none of the servers greeted us. We only got a half hearted greeting from one sushi chef. Then we waited around 5 minutes for a server to get us seated, but we stood at the front counter awkwardly because one server was busy dealing with checks and talking on the walkie.
For the ayce, we didn't even get to look at the menu for 1 minute before the same server came back. He honestly seemed bothered with our presence and all the other servers kept eyeballing our table at first. (??) Throughout our dinner, they didn't come to check up on us to really see how we were doing but it was more like to pick up our empty plates. We were rushed to order more and rushed to finish fast. Not too enjoyable. 

When we got to ordering, the rolls came out very quick and there was one nice server who was good with refilling our water. 
On to the food... the only ones that stuck out to me were the Who's Your Daddy appetizer and the First Kiss roll. The other rolls tasted similar and was quite lacking on the eel sauce for those that we ordered with eel sauce. But then halfway through our dinner, my sister noticed a hair in our soft shell crab roll.... uhh I know damn well that it is not mine nor hers because our hair is pretty long while that one was significantly short.

I'm surprised that this sushi restaurant has such high reviews because compared to other AYCE sushi restaurants like Sakana and Yama Sushi, this is by far the worst AYCE sushi restaurant I've been to in the Las Vegas area. 
First off, the server was extremely rude and rushed us to order right after we sat down and my boyfriend and I didn't even have time to look at the menu. After ordering once, we had to wave for a server to take our orders even though there were only four other parties in the restaurant at the time. 
As for the sushi, the sushi rice was soggy and too wet. It wasn't even the sauce that made it soggy, the rice was probably just cooked with too much water. The salmon nigiri tasted chewy and did not taste fresh at as if it's been frozen for a long time. 
We could tell that the restaurant was very unorganized because we kept receiving appetizers after we received our sushi rolls, which was really weird. 
The only great thing about this restaurant is the amount of items in the menu, there's a lot to choose from ranging from appetizers, soups, salads, poke, and sushi rolls, however everything that my boyfriend and I ordered did not taste as good as we were expecting. I believe it was the bad sushi rice that ruined the sushi rolls for us.",R5ib_YyEWsLt1tklXpkEag,0,0,2,X6pyzJTSgAKFZkWLS0PoTQ

3184174,2018-05-04,0,q-zZgXKAQFLEgMp9ZNllgQ,"Our table of 9 was..... disappointed. 

So we checked in at 7:17p and we didn't have a table until about 8-8:10p.  See, that's not usually a problem since we understand that we're a large party arriving at dinner time so yes, we expected to wait quite a while. But after 40 minutes, we decided to sit inside the restaurant. we noticed that the hostesses has absolutely no idea of seating or planning. An entire table that could comfortably sit 10-12 people were occupied by a couple. One couple. They actually sat one couple down at a table that could easily fit ours. 

Moving on. We ordered (ordering is already a pain since it seems like there's certain people only available to take orders and they seem to disappear as soon as you hold a menu in your hand). throughout our night, the food kept coming out like, in spurts. Like 4 dishes would come out. Then 15 minutes of nothing would come. I ordered nigiri and after 20 minutes, i accepted that it wasn't put in. So I ordered the same thing again and explained the situation to the waitress. After another 20 minutes, it still didn't come. Towards the very end of our meal, all of the nigiri came. Like really? 

Annoyed, My sister's fiancé actually asked a waitress if they have some sort of system or list that they cross off as the food is delivered to our table. She actually said no. Which explains the unpredictable timing of food, delay of food, and just ... it was chaos. 

The food itself was, alright. My sister literally broke out in hives after eating at Umiya. The drive to find an open pharmacy was intense (they all seem to close at 11p by our house). For all parents with a child breaking out in hives: GET BENADRYL. it works faster! Today my sister's doctor said that the food might not have been fresh or the oil clean. 

Our waitress saw 2 little rice pieces of rice (from the nigiri) and she immediately prompted us with a speech about how left over rice will be an extra charge. Wouldn't be a better idea to prompt us towards the END of our meal? Because my dad planned on eating the sushi rice with his soft shell crab... 

I understand that we are a big party. And we always loved coming to Umiya. But the quality and service has been going downhill steadily. It hasn't actually affected us until now.",gRo8XRk7QKfnetXvoH0Q2Q,0,0,1,KLK0iqETnKaMM-w3B0t3_Q

I noticed immediately that the service was a little slow and was a little unorganized. We were seated though immediately but the orders were taken after 15 minutes. I mentioned it was kind of unorganized because after the male server took our orders, after 5 minutes the female server approached our table and asked if our orders were taken.

Now let's rate the food...

I can say the fish quality was good, fish was very fresh and firm (Nigiris).

Grilled seafood was so so... I've eaten better.

Deep fried items were also so so... The soft shell crab that I ordered was drenched in oil. Also they don't put the dipping sauce on the side but they just drizzle it and it makes the dish more wet rather than crispy and light on the outside and moist in the inside

Rolls were okay... I ordered the Tuna Tataki (Rating: 7 out of 10) and Snow White (4 out of 10). 

I can say though that the Seared Tuna with AJ sauce was something different and it was really good. Too bad it's only 1 order per person.

Desserts... Also ordinary and it's one per person too. We tried the mango mochi and tempura ice cream.

I've been here twice now, and I gotta say that overall this is my second favorite ayce sushi place in Vegas (Sushi-mon on Sahara still being number one on my list). Most ayce sushi places that I know of have a 1 hour time limit, but the time limit here is a generous 90 minutes. $20.95 for lunch (11AM-3PM) and $25.95 for dinner (3PM-Close). They have a broad selection of items from ramen/udon noodles, to grilled skewers, ribeye steak (1 order per person), miso marinated pork belly, and a vast array of nigiri and rolls. Their fish is pretty fresh, and I like how they don't put a lot of rice in their nigiri. However, the service was a bit inconsistent today. One of the servers was really accommodating and on top of our orders, but it seemed like some of the other servers there were trying to rush us out. My buddy was eating his ramen, and even though he wasn't done, they kept trying to take it away lol. Also, he literally asked for his salad like 5 times before it finally came out. Not sure what happened there...

I would say that coming here for lunch is definitely a bargain at $20.95. Even if you're not a huge fan of sushi, they have enough non-sushi items that will compensate for that price.",NCRGj36ihdwX-VUCYEX41g,6,5,4,5GLKCjmecnBoj00CyADbYA

But with that said - I haven't been this disappointed with an AYCE sushi restaurant in a long, long time.

The sashimi just was NOT fresh. Whether it was the salmon, tuna, ono, yellowtail, uni, or the sweet shrimp - all you can taste is the FISHINESS of everything. The rice was huge, the quality was poor, and to top it off wreak of fishiness.

After my first round of sashimi, I was so turned off by their nigiri I ended up ordering hot food instead in fear of food poisoning.

The only thing Umiya has going for them is that their service was very attentive. 

But even that was then undid when I had to experience the horrendousness of sitting at the bar and watching their kitchen staff grounding up raw salmon and tuna like it was ground beef.

Excellent dinner. 

Secret is...come at 4pm, because at 4:05pm (okay, after 5pm) it starts to get crowded pretty quickly. And when that happens, you don't get your food as fast since they have to serve everyone else. 

80% of the menu is good! Did not like the ribeye (one per person) since it was overcooked and tough. My girl loved the pork belly (sizzling oh yeahh) and thankfully it was nicely thin. 

The ceviche was refreshing, the uni NOT good (not sweet/fresh), all the rolls great but beware,  they are filling and you will have leftovers that you must force down. The oysters were also a bit meh. 

A must get also is the soft shell crab! we got more than we should have.

3397302,2016-08-15,2,q-zZgXKAQFLEgMp9ZNllgQ,"Walking in, the decor is appealing, lighting was the perfect not too dark and they sat us in tables off to the side kind of intimate little areas, leaving their long tables for large groups. BTW, I think this would be a good place if you have a big group of friends or family because of their farm tables.

Started w/ house salad- loved it. It had a great sweet/salty, & tangy dressing. Very good portion of fresh mixed greens, juicy tomatoes and avocado slices. Loved the sticks of marinated cucumber throughout.

On to some Grilled Skewers- 
-baby tako (spicy, yummy BBQ like sauce) too bad it was tough, took a lot of chewing :/
-grilled chicken, had some soggy skin that didn't crisp up, unappetizing
-bacon wrapped scallops were great, (crispy, sweet, succulent) of the ones we tried, I would have tripled our scallop order and scrapped the rest. Good to know.

Creamy shrimp comes with a little ketchup dipper and side house salad. Good concept with shrimp wrapped in wonton wrappers & cream cheese, then fried. Unfortunately, it seemed they used pre-cooked shrimp, drying out the shrimp; even cream cheese cannot save rubbery and tough shrimp. Dish has potential, though, if only the shrimp were succulent! I also think the ketchup was a weird sauce choice-  maybe a citrus ginger or one of the sushi sauces. Just not the ketchup.

On to sushi, we went basic. Sometimes when I'm not sure about a restaurant, I start with a spicy tuna roll. Gotta be able to make a great spicy tuna before earning my trust in rolls! Theirs was decent but low on the spice factor IMO and they had decent Philly California roll, as well. A nice bowl of tempura ice cream and that was it folks, we were stuffed. I'll say service was a rollercoaster as bigger groups came in and received more attention, understandable, but still we were sometimes hanging out there in space and sometimes our servers (there were 2 tag-teaming) were on top of it.

3418409,2013-02-19,2,q-zZgXKAQFLEgMp9ZNllgQ,"This was formally known as Kan / Kaizen Sushi. It's about $30 for dinner AYCE including tax. The hot tea is $2 each but during their Happy Hour it's buy two drinks get one free, so with four people it came down to $1.25 per. It's located on Flamingo and Arville in the plaza by the Starbucks. 

My friends got here before I did, so they got us all a table, while of course waiting for me. It's a real nice place inside, loved the decor, very simple, elegant, and modern. There weren't that many people there when we were there, maybe around 20-ish people there including us. Service started promising, but as soon as the place started to fill up with only two servers, the service just went downhill. I didn't understand why they didn't have more servers on a Saturday evening during a dinner service. I was a little baffled by that. 

Not sure if this matters, but this place is run by Koreans as is most sushi places in Vegas it seems. Started with the usual, tuna, salmon, and yellowtail. The quality was mediocre, it wasn't that bad but it wasn't good either, they weren't really fresh in my opinion. The tamago and masago were okay as well, the tamago was definitely better than any of the fish. The Ikura, well didn't really look like regular Ikura to me, it was much smaller than normal, and the color was a bit off to me, which goes back to the question of freshness, it wasn't really fresh, as it tasted different from what I'm used to (and I usually order about 20 pieces of Ikura). What really got me was ordering the sweet shrimp, I nearly gagged on this and really felt nauseous eating it. That's a huge no no for me, they poured Ponzu sauce on it what seemed to me they were trying to mask the age of the fish, it was NOT fresh at all. One friend ordered Uni and well the presentation of it was bad, it looked horrible to say the least, and he was very skeptical of tasting it after my reaction with the sweet shrimp. 

My friend got the rib eye and pork belly. They weren't bad according to him and for the pork belly though, it was dripping in oil. Like the plate was saturated with it. Looked good at least, but I wouldn't touch it without at least dabbing it down with a napkin. We also got a first kiss roll since it sounded it, it wasn't too bad, but I'm not usually a fan of rolls in general.

At the end we ordered dessert, two tempura ice cream and two ice cream, one order per person, and waited close to 15 minutes for it, before we cancelled and just left. I don't know what was going on in the kitchen, but it seemed under staffed all around for a Saturday evening. 

The only real good thing I would say on the menu is everything else but the nigiri. They have an extensive AYCE menu, but it'll be a very long time before I come back here, if ever. It's worth a try, and I hope the experience of others are better than mine, but I do have high standards for sushi restaurant in general. It's worth a try if you cannot tell the difference in quality or freshness of fish as some of my friends cannot, but if you get easy queasy from bad fish, I would avoid it at least for now.",dM1HHK4szA5Qs6NSAaEk1Q,3,1,2,FW0ebgp8e1r4xDEWA4mpKQ

3445699,2017-01-07,0,q-zZgXKAQFLEgMp9ZNllgQ,"My family was coming in to town for Christmas, and we decided to have dinner here on Christmas Day. We made a reservation a few weeks in advance.

The interior was very modern, with bench-style seating and pop music videos playing from screens on the wall. It was also definitely on the noisier (but lively) side in terms of atmosphere.

The restaurant was VERY busy that night, and they almost gave up our table (they will only hold for 15 minutes after your reservation time, and your whole party must be present to be seated). Service was friendly, but I don't think food came quite as fast as some other Yelpers have been mentioning in their reviews. In particular, any hot kitchen items (e.g. that required deep-frying or baking) seemed to take a particularly long time to prepare. They also ran out of some ""dinner only"" items such as uni and even agedashi tofu at one point, which is kind of silly since it was only 7PM and the restaurant is open until 2AM. In addition, the lunch and dinner menus are essentially the same, so to charge several dollars more per person for dinner without having all the dinner items in stock is a bit unfair.

Overall, the food was very tasty, and the menu is extensive. Like another Yelper mentioned, I think they shine more in the appetizer/non-rolls area, as the sushi rolls were not particularly special/memorable. 

They didn't strictly enforce the 90-minute time limit, but did start trying to nudge us along after that time passed (given that there were people waiting for tables). One of the managers wanted to give us the check, but we said we were still waiting for some dessert items. In addition, my mom's boyfriend ended up proposing to her during this meal. That same manager was very honest though, as he came back to explain that they had already added an 18% gratuity since we were a large group and the payer had inadvertently tipped based on the post-gratuity amount.

My aunt and uncle were griping about how this was a Korean-owned Japanese restaurant, but at this point, I'm used to it. There are a ton of Korean-owned Japanese restaurants in many different states, and while they are usually not 100% authentic, they still serve up decent food.

Oh, and if you don't want to opt for all-you-can-eat, there is a regular menu too/you can always order a la carte. However, it is really easy to spend the same amount as AYCE, so you might as well choose AYCE unless you just aren't that hungry.

The thing I loved most about this place was that the nigiri came with small portions of the rice and a good sized slice of sashimi on top.  The sake (salmon) was oh so good! melt in your mouth kind of fish.  They also had many great appetizers to choose from my favorite had to be the either the fried soft shell crab and baked mussels, literally heaven!  The staff was great, our waitress was funny and even cracked jokes with us during the night which I always like seeing.  The only con I have about this place is that when i ordered my uni is tasted a little frozen not as fresh as the other places I have around Vegas.  

But for the most part I enjoyed this place very much and will definitely be back for another round at Umiya :)",xSKKWjLQMqZ5f5JWQSwtxw,1,1,4,fwh1u0BeUwws_SIfyXAC-g
3519424,2013-05-19,1,q-zZgXKAQFLEgMp9ZNllgQ,"I'm a fan. I've been here a few times and more often than not, all the food I get is pretty good, if not great (at least for an AYCE place). Their AYCE menu is fairly large. The dinner price is $26.95 and for kids it's about $13.

Most of the nigiri I've tried was good, with standouts being the tuna, super white tuna, sea bream, yellowtail and eel. Other items on their menu that I'm a fan of include their gyoza, the yellowtail lover roll, and crispy rice with spicy tuna. Their oysters and pork belly are decent and worth ordering again.

I wasn't a fan of the seared tuna in AJ sauce or the Hawaiian roll.

The interior is cool with the long communal tables and benches. It also seems to be easier to get a seat than other AYCE places around town. The times I went I've never had to wait, which is perfect when my patience is running low, I'm hungry, and all I want to do is stuff my face.",C2C0GPKvzWWnP57Os9eQ0w,7,4,4,SNnZYfZo8ZFEDpDBNS3qDw

Out of the few times I have been here for dinner, there has always been a wait so I guess that just shows how popular the place is. 

We ordered a bunch of items, but I would recommend getting the Yuzu Hamachi and the garlic tuna nigiri! Both are really flavorful and delicious. I ended up eating like 4 pieces of each lol! In terms of rolls I would recommend trying the orange blossom roll (it is my favorite at the moment). I really like the citrusy taste along with the crunch from the tempura. I also got to try the ribeye appetizer along with the soft shell crab. My friend got ramen (IDK why he did that), but it tasted okay. I'm pretty sure the vast selection of appetizers you can pick from is just there to bait you, so I would recommend just trying 1 or 2 and focusing most of your energy and stomach space on the sushi! I would also get the 2 cucumber wrapped rolls (I think one is called the Naruto and I forgot the other, but they are listed next to each other). I have always wanted to try the chicken katsu, but I think that would fill me up relatively fast. 

You can also order more than 1 dessert item here so I would recommend the red bean and green tea ice cream scoop. 

I would recommend checking this place out if you want a sushi place that has a decent selection of items that goes beyond sushi. I would give this place 3.5 stars, but since I can't do that, I will be generous and give them 4 stars lol!",29yBaTFMSh-l6wNwy9d_mA,7,7,4,JjB_2WEWsXxiKl7cBmHaMA

THE GRILLED SQUID WAS GRILLED TO PERFECTION I swear, it was soooo good and it's pretty big! The beef teriyaki was delicious too!!! I know I sound like I'm exaggerating but it's not my fault that it's so good?! It's actually really really good. I like my beef teriyaki super sweet so it hit the spot for me.

They also have a large selection of beers but their house sake is tasty! oh not to forget they also had no rice sushi rolls wrapped in cucumber which I love.

Some of the items on an ayce sushi list are sweet shrimp, white tuna!! oysters, ramen, Kalbi, and pork belly dishes. Some of the desserts are Mochi, ice cream, banana splits, all included in the ayce.

 My favorite are Salmon Skin, tempura shrimp, soft shell crab and Snow white rolls and the sushi wrapped with cucumber instead of rice, I forgot the name.

The first time in I went up to the bar to see the fish.  Well they don't display the fish here so no looking at what you're going to order like most sushi places.

One of the sushi chefs yells at me ""What do you want sir?""

I asked him ""What is fresh tonight""

Him, ""EVERTHING IS FRESH!""

Me;  Okay, then what do you recommend? What is the freshest?""

Him:  ""EVERTHING IS THE FRESHEST!""

I kind of knew right then that this was not an honest place.

The good:  Tempura, fish katsu, Tuna poke with seaweed salad (excellent!!).  We had this twice and I would get it again.  Salad was fresh and tasty.  Good rice too.

The bad:  the ""no-rice"" roll with crab was actually Krab (Pollack) and daikon radish and cucumber.  It tasted essentially like daikon radish and the 6 slices were no more than a 1/4 inch thick ($12.00???) We actually sent this back it tasted so bad.

The worst other bad:  Seafood Chirashi:  I've had this dish many many times at other establishments and I always get 10 to 11 different types of raw seafood over rice.    Here I got tomago, tuna, a light fish I could not identify, a single small cooked shrimp, salmon and tobiko.  The fish was sliced very thin to make it appear like more was there.

Half the bowl was covered with shredded radish as filler.  What a joke.

I could see straight away that the tuna was bad (dark and sagging), one sniff and I moved it to the side.  Next I smell the light colored fish and it seems okay so I try it and nope, its bad too.  Also warm!!  Had to spit it out type of bad.

I had to send the whole dish back and ordered the fish katsu again which was excellent.

They did not charge for the Chirashi but they did not own up to the fact that the fish was bad.

I know they will read this and think I am full of it but seriously guys I've been eating and MAKING sushi for 30 years.  Also, just read the reviews where people claim food poisoning from your fish.  I am sure it is true.

I came here this past weekend after a long trafficy drive from LA. I called Umiya Sushi on the way there and ask how long the wait it would be for 2 people. They told me it was around 15-20 minutes. I didn't mind and I was hungry so we drove here anyway. It was about 3/4 full and we got seated fairly quickly (didn't end up waiting 15-20 min). 

We decided to just go with AYCE and not the a la carte menu because we thought it would be around the same price. I do understand they have a 90 minute time limit for dining in. To be honest, I usually don't take that long to eat as long as the food comes out in a decent time period. They were very pushy and I felt very rushed while eating. I had not even been there for 30 minutes and at least 3 people came by and kept trying to get us to order more food. I see their tricks...order fast, fill up on rice, gtfo quicker. No thanks. Just wanted to enjoy my sushi.

Their fish was decent but man...they put so much rice on their rolls. Ive been to places back in LA where they aren't trying to rob you of your money by giving you 5:1 rice to fish ratio. 

Also, one of the servers put down a half order of sunrise roll. The sunrise roll consisted  of: 

Inside: spicy crab 
Top: salmon, avocado, green onion
Sauce: Spicy ponzu

As soon as he placed it down, he told his manager (might possibly be the owner too) and said the avocado looked a little off and brown... Manager came by, inspected the roll in front of us and told us the avocado looked bad and then said he would make us a new one. Why would you even place the sushi down in the first place if it looks bad? It made me feel more uneasy when he came over and inspected it and then told us it looked bad. 

I guess.....Thanks for not letting us eat bad avocado, but no thanks for making me not want to eat it at all, even if it was a new one.

I think its safe to say I wont be returning here...",X8wVNRAuh6WqPU9Rjv8vKw,4,0,2,lRneueOUbijxHUgs9KrVug

I also would have to point out that this place is most likely not run by Japanese people. They hand you the bill before all the food on the table is gone which is less than cordial.

I'm iffy about coming back here mainly because the service just wasn't good. I know that service can be of less quality when a restaurant is busy but in my case I came at an off hour and only a few tables were full. 

The food is good enough for me to come back - the nigiri is of good quality but it can be a hit or miss sometimes you'll get a good cut of fish and other times it won't be as good as another. The tuna poke is also good. 

One thing a server said with a sort of attitude when I ordered 10 orders of a nigiri was ""it's 20 pieces, are you sure you're going to eat all that?"" I don't think he realized it was going to be split between my friend and I so he thought I was going to eat it on my own and that's kind of rude to say??? I mean I can read the menu so I know what I'm getting myself into and if I can't eat it all then I'm going to pay for it lol 

Another thing is that when you try to flag down a server it seems like they either can't see you or they ignore you. Now I work as a server in the food industry as well and if I were to not be paying more attention to the restaurant patrons my boss would be so pissed and yet these servers are walking around not aware of things half the time. 

I think an experience here is a hit or miss for the most part since I've read several other reviews that say negatory things about the service here as well. Come with caution.",d9QOgv82HxE2s-o-tnjeZg,1,0,3,lJZeMnT0mC2QeGezwnmjFw

My friend and I like to venture over to Umiya when we're looking for a decent meal. They have the standard AYCE prices with dinner specials available such as salmon kama or a specialty appetizer item. Their lunch specials are pretty decent and filling if you're looking for something to take home or if you just want an entree. We like to check-in and get a free soda or iced green tea (the real deal and not the Coca-Cola one). 

One thing that this location offers is the super white tuna or ono. I've been noticing that some restaurants are choosing not to carry this item, due to a supplier issue, but I'm happy to enjoy it at this location. Is it true super white? Who knows, but it sure tastes like it. They have interesting dessert-style specialty rolls which contain fruit and eel sauce. If you're getting AYCE, you might as well split a half roll.

We've come here a couple of times and it's safe to say that service depends on the moon and the stars, the Dow Jones, or the shape of the clouds because I don't get it. Whether busy or slow, the service can be super quick or patiently long and I'm just talking about placing an order, not to receive the food. I often have to ask for refills and usually have to flag someone down to get something. Myabe this speaks for the lack of adequate staffing. Who knows? Either way the food is pretty good.

Note: They're offering free mugs for posting of reviews. Will this lead to an oversampling of 5-star reviews? Probably. Did I get a cup for this? Not yet, but who doesn't want a free cup?",cQzo2WX1TyPEmS5jPzOUoA,4,3,4,LghSbFdFKo62n1LoIkMwPg

Came on a weekday night and the restaurant was not very busy so we got a seat right away. I do have to say that the service is very good and at any point when our drinks were low they would come refill it without us asking. That is always nice and a change from most of the other sushi joint. 

There were a few creative appetizer items such as the monkey bring, which was decent but over fried. We did order a bunch of nigiri sushi and for the most part the rice was huge and the piece of fish was very small. Generally I would say the ratio is terrible compared to many of the other places in town. I do like that they have a variety of other items on the menu there appetizer menu is quite extensive, and they have 5 different skewers as well. The quality of fish was decent, but we did order the salmon belly special item and it tasted very weird.

The comments about attentive, awesome service....CORRECT

Food/Fish/Portions Quality: Outstanding (Try the Lobster Roll, Las Vegas, Baked Mussels, Octopus, Salmon & if course...the Tuna) BTW...The chef dropped me a few pieces of Toro just to show how legit everything really is.  

Poke is BANGIN & Seaweed Salad is fresh.  

Sake & Beer: About 10-12 solid brands (sake) & all Asia beers.

3813553,2016-11-08,5,q-zZgXKAQFLEgMp9ZNllgQ,"Went here last night with a group of friends for a going away dinner for a coworker. The moment we sat down the servers assisted us right away considering that it was busy. Do keep in mind that they will not seat any party that is incomplete, everyone in your party needs to be present upon being seated. 

This review is a combination of my last visit a year ago and recently. Both times I came here was in a group of friends/coworkers. The cool thing about this place is the communial seating arrangement with outdoor picnic tables and chairs with an industrial like ceiling. Great when dinning with a group of friends because they are able to accommodate sizable groups. One group had 14ppl, another table had 12ppl and there was a mixed amount of 6-8ppl at other tables during our visit.

Our small group of 4ppl went with the AYCE menu with the exception of 1, who opted to order individual items. This place is a good option to introduce someone who is not to familiar with AYCE and Japanese food.

Some of the few items we enjoyed:
-Baked Green Mussels-Fresh and seasoned just right with the a good amount of cheese. ""Oceany"" taste according to two of my friends.

-Hawaiian & Firecracker roll was really good and left a lasting impression, considering a few of us who don't do Nigiri.

-Tempura Ice Cream & Mochi Ice Cream was good.

In my personal opinion, I would given this place 3.5 stars because their Nigiri didn't have a fresh consistent taste with a few a bit dry ones but there were times it was good. Since Im biased with Nigiri opposed to rolls.

The reason for my 4 star rating is based on the attentive service, because there isn't really a set server. More of a group of servers working as a team. We had a few order takers, food runners, bussers and the manager occasionally checking up on us. The great thing our group appreciated was that they were able to split the check in 4 individual checks, which made it easier to pay with less confusion. This option is not common in many Asian restaraunts.",6pzA8EDhHgW3A5-rBObhBA,6,6,4,Wq3NKCfIB-HRQDnFChmR0Q

I am an Executive Chef and I was really impressed by the freshness of the Sushi.
We went on a Wednesday nite and everyone knows that the WEEKENDS are the best times to eat fresh Sushi.

We sat right at the counter and I can spot fresh gleaming fish when I see it .
After I saw a few orders of fresh fish go out and they looked delicious, I decided to give it a try.

I started with the halibut, next the tuna, then the salmon, then the albacore.
I really was totally impressed and the place wasn't that busy.

Then I went for the kill, pork belly, rib-eye steak,  squid,baby octopus,fresh oysters.
I downed a bottle of saki and some beer, took a little breather.

For my final finally I had bacon wrapped scallops,flamingo rolls.
I had the lobster roll and it had nice chunks of lobster that you could really taste.

I wanted to try some of the nice desserts that I saw, but I was just to full, and I don't believe in wasting good food.

I am very picky about what I eat and I have to say everything was great.
overall this is a great place and I hope they do well.
I left a good tip also.

I will be back next week and so will my friends
Anyone who complains about this place for the price and variety, are just some unhappy souls.
I looked at some of the stupid remarks of others and for some reason they don't realize what their getting for $27.00 .
On the strip I would have paid $150 or more for all this.

So for all the cheap complainers, don't expect Wagyu Filet and Australian Lobster when your paying McDonalds prices.

3857402,2015-02-12,0,q-zZgXKAQFLEgMp9ZNllgQ,"So I actually want to give this place 3.5 stars...but alas I have no such option.

Why?! Do you the...oh so inquisitive minds, observantly inquire...well...something fishy going on with the rice. (Pardon the pun...I know, I know...corny)

Sushi rice is supposed to be big round sticky pressed vinegared grains of rice...well specifically Japanese White rice AKA ""Shari or Sushi-Meshi""...basically something that specifically complements Sashimi turning it into Nigiri. (Can you tell I really, really, really like Sushi?) I'm not sure what this place uses...but the rice turns out strange. 

The cuts of fish over the Nigiri are actually very good...fresh, perfectly proportioned over small servings of rice. But the rice itself is either not done correctly or it is not the right type of grain. I just tastes odd...like an inexperienced Sushi chef made it. One of the other mishaps here was the Rib-Eye I ordered. i requested medium rare, but got it medium...to well. There was nothing rare about it...no pink at all. 

Other that that...hands down this is one of the better AYCE places I had the pleasure of dining at. I ordered a fairly long list of items...a bit tedious to list here, so I will only put what I thought was outstanding...but feel free to take a look at a pic of the bill I posted. The Sweet shrimp was very impressive! One of the best I had, considering this is coming from an AYCE restaurant. Succulent, meaty and actually sweet. They even asked me if i wanted the heads fried separately...bonus points! 

The service here was very good, I was frequently checked upon, my Tea was refilled regularly and the waitresses were polite and courteous without being overbearing. I came here on a late afternoon, around 4:15, so I might have beaten the crowds...well actually I did, because there were only five other people in the restaurant...so maybe that might have been a factor to consider. All the food came out rather quickly. I was impressed at the promptness my orders were filled.

I like Umiya for one thing and one thing only: their sushi and quality of fish. Most of the rolls that I've tried are pretty damn good. (Salmon killer; orange blossom, and although this roll was my absolute all time favorite, they must have tweaked something because it just doesn't taste the same; snow white; rattlesnake) The nigiri is composed well in terms of the ratio of rice to fish. The quality of their ingredients are fresh--with the exception of avocados perhaps being too fresh since it was nearing raw in my Monkey Brain. Oh man, with an abundance of ginger flowing with my nigiri and rolls, I'm a girl in heaven after a long day at work!

The only thing that holds me back from a 5 star rating is the service. To pick on the nitty gritty stuff, even though the servers know my sister and I their greeting is always the same. (I work in the service industry as a waitress and I can't say that I'm the best in my field but 8 out of 10 customers complement me on my service and I can say with confidence that 100% of the returning customers like to be recognized.) Whether they are busy or not, they rarely check up on my table and we always have to ask for attention. Even when they drop off our orders they never seem to ask if everything is alright and if we need something.

Some of the dishes I enjoyed included the daily special yuzu hamachi, sweet shrimp, grilled mackerel, uni, and the AJ (seared tuna sashimi in sauce). Some of the many missteps include the service which forgot to place our initial orders and then failed to apologize or acknowledge it, the soft-shell crab, and the unforgivable spicy tuna nachos. There was no flow to the ordering and our server even tried to take a second order without us having received the first.

The layout of this place is amazing, and it should fit a lot of people even if it gets popular.  Here's hoping this place picks up, because it was dead when I went.

No complaints about the AYCE really, other than the limitations on quantity of certain items.  They even had similar unique appetizers to Goyemon, including crispy rice spicy tuna and pork belly.

My friend was a non-sushi eater and seemed pleased with the steak options on the AYCE menu, so that's also a major plus.  Oh, and this is probably the closest AYCE to the strip, which can be a HUGE plus.  I'll be back.",1O638BDK_fWuxgTVJwff-A,5,2,5,wmAzc8c1_9UPb23qrvuPjA

There are actually 8 types of bento boxes, and I got the 4-piece sushi & chicken teriyaki. 

What made this bento box the bestest was the chicken teriyaki specially prepared with artfully cut carrots, zucchini, mushroom, broccoli, onions, in a savory sauce.

Another thing Umiya did right being ""new"" is adopting what's good and getting rid of what didn't work.  Umiya is not totally new, it was the former Kaizen Fusion.  But with the name change it severs any affiliation with the other Kaizen.. except the sushi names have been kept the same.  

The only times I come in is during their slow hours and before dinner service.  Because it's slow, service has been great.  I sit up right at the bar and get even better/faster service.  Any time you can order straight to the Chef, that's how you should do it.  Trust me it works, I've done it at Honey Salt.  If you come in during lunch like me it's not worth upgrading to dinner price for the Uni/Ama ebi/Seared tuna sashimi.  

There were some good items and some AYCE grade sushi, neither is bad.  If you know what to look for then ask for it, more likely than not they'll have it or he'll lie and say he doesn't.  Some of the few items I asked for was salmon belly, fresh wasabi, yellowtail belly, etc.  They had some of these items but not advertised anywhere, so ask. 

When you come in, order everything you can order one item of which includes:  Baby Octopus, Gingko (if you know herbal medical properties or take vitamins then order it, if not, don't), pork belly, oysters.  Ask for specialty fishes, every time I have come in there hasn't been one but keep asking.  Uni was good, ama ebi I was a little disappointed in especially the pre-prepped head/deep fried antennas.  

The ice cream was good and I confirmed it by ordering a second but different flavor.  The waitress gave me a hard time about getting another even though I told her I'd pay for another, separate it on a different check if she needed, there was no language barrier here and I knew I only get one per AYCE.",k4M43lXJuQMpQW65DTqzIQ,13,6,4,dz_y0evps8gEswXG997Opg

I don't have a favorite place, but I do have places I like to go depending on what I'm craving. This is definitely an appetizer place for me. That means their rolls and nigiri were just like everyone else, but they had a lot of unique appetizers that I liked that they carried or that I RE-ordered. I have to say that their uni was an honorable mention though.

So Umiya is right off the strip and just south of China Town so it's a pretty popular place. They have bar seating, some booths, and communal looking seats in the middle. 

Most sushi places like this are gunna be very similar so I won't go into much detail. Price was just like everywhere else give or take a buck. 

My main draw here was I loved how fast service was here. There are multiple servers bringing by orders and taking away plates. I eat a lot and my bar area never seemed too crowded because the servers were around constantly.

4054653,2013-02-17,6,q-zZgXKAQFLEgMp9ZNllgQ,"Previously Kan Sushi, Umiya is a new sushi joint out here that's actually close to the strip.  

This was Chad S's UYE and I couldn't resist the combination of meeting new Yelpers and eating sushi.  When it comes to this place, it's all about AYCE.  I'm one of those guys that can eat a ton, so AYCE is never a bad choice.  As for the food, I got so much of it that it's tough for me to remember, but I'll try.

-Yellowtail and Tuna Nigiri:  Small, but since it's AYCE it wasn't an issue. Tasty, fresh, and the texture was just right. Believe me, I've had some stale dry nigiri before.  My favorite Yellowtail is still at Kaizen off Paradise.

-Katsu Chicken:  Not bad, just a little greasy.  Still fresh and crunchy.  Tasted perfect with their chicken fried rice.

-Chicken Fried Rice:  Thick pieces of chicken mixed with their fried rice.  If it's not sushi to come here for, then it's their fried rice.

-Ramen (miso):  Just okay, but it's also one of my first ramens.  Not much to compare against. I didn't think it was bad, but others have stated that Chinatown has better.

-Tempura Shrimp Hand Roll:  I use to be a western roll type of person. Now it's all about Nigiri, Shashimi, and Hand Rolls.  Still got a yum yum type hand roll and it didn't disappoint.  Again, small but it's ACYE.

-Tempura Ice Cream:  Not a dessert person, but couldn't resist on this visit.  This was pretty good too. 

Service wasn't bad considering that our group was fairly big.  Between all the food request from other Yelpers, the fact it was Friday night, and because this location was close to the strip..I felt that the service was decent. 

Overall, I will be back.  There's a ton of other sushi joints out here in Vegas.  But this one is little closer to the strip, which makes it a good stop when out of town friends/family are in the sushi mood. 

Thanks to Chad S. for setting this up.  Got to meet some Yelp friends that I've never met in person.  Also was able to hang out with some Yelpers that still are the coolest peeps around. New Yelper Alicia R (Terri R's twin) was in attendance. She ended up being my run/walk buddy for the next day's Color Run 5K.

The environment was lovely and just love all the bench seating. The service was great until after we got our desserts. No refilling of water and they weren't anywhere to be found. 

The food was okay, nothing great. They made their rolls really weird is all I can say. For instance, philly roll, instead of putting everything inside the roll like its suppose to be, the salmon was on top and it just made it taste a bit off. Their poke tasted pretty horrible. It didn't seem like nice big chunk of smooth tuna, instead it was grainy like. The hand roll was just filled with rice, just way too much.

Overall, I didn't enjoy myself. I definitely would not be coming back at all. I prefer Sumo Sushi I/II instead.",ZF-1QU2jweLa59a5gYQptA,1,1,2,APTNq6va7IHcPi35ifeE5Q

Let me start off by saying that the service was spectacular...stellar...mindblowingly good! Not only was the staff incredibly helpful and on point, but even the chef/owner came out to make our experience that much better. He personally recommended most of the dishes that we had that night and made quite a few of them himself, even throwing a few lessons on fish quality and freshness our way.

I wish I could remember what we had that night, but unfortunately I have no recollection of the names. I do suggest trying the dishes on their ""Specials"" board...they were all fantastic. I don't think you can go wrong with anything on their menu. Everything was fresh and had a unique twist to regular dishes.

4108172,2016-03-06,4,q-zZgXKAQFLEgMp9ZNllgQ,"A popular recent discussion in Yelp Talk of Las Vegas has been about overrated businesses. Well, count me in as puzzled at the 4.5 star average rating of this restaurant.

I first tried Umiya Sushi back when I was frequently exploring different all-you-can-eat sushi restaurants. Although I did have a positive impression at the time, it ended up being a one-and-done visit until tonight because it wasn't nearly as good as other AYCE sushi spots. My group's options were more limited late at night though, and we settled on one of the closer ones.

There are certainly some positives this meal. Some of the highlights from my first visit were also standouts on this trip. I enjoyed the tuna sashimi with AJ sauce and the baked New Zealand mussels as much as any AYCE appetizer. The oysters were pretty fresh and decently sized. The fish katsu was a surprise hit with tender fish, a crunchy fried exterior, and just the right amount of sauce.

Tsubugai (whelk) was on the one-per-person specials menu. It was a first-time nigiri for me, and the flavor and chewiness was great. Unagi was spectacular, with a bit of extra caramelization than usual that gave texture and flavor. Yuzu hamachi (yelllowtail with citrus) and garlic tuna (albeit more sweet than garlicky) were also nice. The uni was above average in an AYCE context and had little of that ""dirty seawater"" issue that often plagues AYCE uni.

The rolls that I tasted weren't too bad either. Yellowtail Lovers with hamachi and spicy hamachi, and both of the no-rice rolls. I would have gone for more, but we were all getting pretty full

The list of letdowns is too long though. Soft-shell crab was fine, especially with soy sauce, but the shell was just a bit too hard and persisted while chewing (note: photo omitted due to low quality). Salmon was bland in all versions: salmon nigiri, salmon belly nigiri, and salmon kama. The kama was overcooked and dry as well. We have not been AYCE friends for a little bit too long, sadly. Screaming o salad was actually nice, but I only found three relatively thin slices of tuna in the huge bed of salad. You can't skimp like that on a one-per-person order.

Super white tuna nigiri was also boring. I do prefer unsauced ono, but this version was bland. I think this was also the nigiri that had a few hard grains of rice, which is rarely ever seen even with the lower standards of AYCE sushi. Amaebi (sweet shrimp) had the right texture but was also bland. The crispy rice with spicy tuna was one of the more boring versions that I've had. The grilled mackerel was also on the dry side. And both the green tea and plum wine ice cream scoops were a little icy and just seemed like another off-balance way to end the dinner (although the mango mochi was fine, probably because it's the standard packaged stuff).

The biggest lowlight was the mixed karai. My friend's bowl looked tempting with its assortment of fish, but I got the impression that my bowl was made wholly of thin discarded pieces and/or low-quality cuts. It was a chore to eat it, especially one of the big chunks of tuna. I found myself dipping the fish in soy sauce or leftover sauce from one of the no-rice rolls. I can't remember having a worse mixed seafood salad in town.

Service issues were again present. They somehow missed giving us the uni on the first order and we had to re-request it. Perhaps they gave it to another table? The servers seemed to constantly bring out superfluous items, forcing us to tell them that we hadn't ordered whatever it was. I just don't run into these issues with table dining at another AYCE sushi restaurants, so it's telling that it's happened 2 out of 2 times here.

Umiya is a passable AYCE sushi restaurant if your options are limited or if you're hanging out in the vicinity (such as the Strip or one of the Flamingo Rd casinos), but I really wouldn't mind staying away for another three years. There are simply far better options in the genre.",_VMGbmIeK71rQGwOBWt_Kg,10,5,3,Znvvh11QWEmhDZYDrav0Kw

The rice was hard and they give u plenty of that, I was also informed that if we left out any rice we would be charged, but after a few sushis I almost didn't give a shit cause it was so bad

My suggestions, stay away from the sushi or rolls, or anything with rice in them

I used to think I wasn't into AYCE sushi but more and more good places are opening up, it is no longer sushi waiting too long sitting in the little fridge by the unfriendly guys in front getting old before it's served sushi.

So I guess with this, yet another good AYCE, I'm into it! 

When you walk in you are greeted with the usual loud ""Konnichiwa!!!""  They have a nice area with tables in a kind of tented areas off to the sides, a large bar to watch the chefs and lots and lots of a picnic kind of tables all throughout.  Both times we were here there were men from Japan drinking their butts off hanging in the restaurant so if from the fish capital of the world love it why can't we?! 

The AYCE menu is huge, the first trip we came with his mom and dad who were in town.  She eats nothing raw, so I put my preferences aside and we order cooked food.  In most cases I am left with the everlasting want for sushi until we head back to one, in this case I left happy and satisfied.  All of the cooked rolls and food were nummy!  Next trip was with people who eat it all, so we did.  As mentioned earlier they have a 90 minute limit ( I was done way before, but for you men or heavy eaters out there! ) My boyfriend and his friends enjoyed it all, no I truly mean it all! ;) lol  The staff was nice and fast the entire time and even though the guys ate a TON of food they never made us feel bad.  

The quality of fish:  Good, in lines with some of the other top AYCE places in town, not as good as some of the best non AYCE places in town but what can you expect.

The baked green muscles are great and all the fish comes out at the right temperature which is not always the case here in Las Vegas because it is a desert!  

The fast service here and water refills really separate this place apart from the rest!  Keep up the good work!

Notes:  This location actually gives you a receipt with every item you ate even if it's AYCE.

The place was not very busy for dinner during the weeknight. Jay and Krystal was our servers that night and they did a wonderful job of taking our orders and refilling our drinks. We never had to ask for refills they just knew when we needed it. They are very friendly and accommodating. 
We went for all you can eat buffet style. For dinner it was 26.95 per person vs. 22.95 for lunch. The only difference is that for dinner you can order one Uni, sweet shrimp, and some tuna dish. But honestly not worth the extra four dollars you have to pay unless you can not make it for lunch or you love Uni. The food for a buffet was good and reasonable fresh. (I mean we are out in a dessert LOL). We enjoyed all the dishes except for Uni (not a fan of the slimmy sea creature=P_) and the Ginkgo (some kind of fried beans). The rolls were big and very filling. I would recommend to order one roll at a time and try lots of appetizers and udon/ ramen dish. This way you will not fill up on the rolls without getting the chance to try the other dishes.

4207675,2017-07-07,0,q-zZgXKAQFLEgMp9ZNllgQ,"It is our first time visiting this AYCE Sushi restaurant on a friend's recommendation and based on service alone, I would have rated 1-star but gave it 2-stars for the average sushi.

The sushi nigiri is decent with good ratio between rice and fish (the fish were a tad dry, but I'll stop nitpicking). Miso soup is something I usually order FIRST from sushi restos but would totally avoid it here -- instant miso packets bought from a supermarket tastes way better! And the sad part is it's the first thing we ordered but had to keep asking for its whereabouts a few times before it was delivered. We also tried their tuna poke and fresh oysters which were excellent but then let down by the heavily breaded soft shell crab and sour-tasting calamari. And don't get me started on how awful the spicy tuna roll is, it's a simple dish that should be the least hardest to screw up on.

The service we received was sub par to put it kindly. Maybe we arrived after lunch rush hour and everyone is dead tired but I'm making excuses to understand why the wait staff sucked. Our inattentive waitresses (yes that's plural) often neglected us and kept ""forgetting"" simple requests like napkins, soy sauce, wasabi and then (almost) tossing in orders on our table as they flew by.

On a larger scale, it became increasingly annoying when we kept getting wrong orders and repeatedly had to ask for and follow up our sushi orders which we eventually gave up on and decided to move on and just pay our bill. In Las Vegas where there's lots of choices, including good AYCE sushi joints, Umiya will not be one of them.

I can overlook mediocre food, even bad food, but crappy service is unforgivable especially if the price point is higher than better places. At least I can tell my friend we tried the place and it was 'okay' at best.",J4LGq7xYlHDfbfHbwbyK8Q,1,0,2,vs68SQsvR3r5W2L5PFpIHA

We got menus and started going through it then a server (male) came over to our table and said ""what would you guys want to drink, I'm only taking drinks order!"". At that moment I felt we were being rushed and probably had pissed off that server for the fact that we came in 1 hour before they were closed. An hour is actually plenty of time to give your customers a full service dining experience without rushing them, I know because I'm a long time server myself at a full service sushi restaurant. I get it when customers come in late but thats a con when you work in this restaurant industry. After that server took our drinks order a new server came and took care of us the rest of the time.

If you like AYCE for the non sushi selection, they have pretty good stuff. I really like their grilled salmon and this tofu dish. I actually really enjoyed the tuna poke. I did like that they had more variety for their ice cream mochis than other sushi restaurants.

- They have pretty much every type of fish available including uni & fresh oysters. But for items like these there is a limit to your order (ex.1 order of uni per person)
- Plenty of appetizers available including miso soup, ceviche, baked mussels, seaweed salad, gyoza, spicy tuna on crispy rice & soft shell crab
- Full 2 pages of rolls if you're not much of a sushi person
- Wrap up your raw meal with some meat (teriyaki, rib-eye) and noodles (udon, ramen) 
- And don't forget... ICE CREAM! From tempura ice cream to mochi ice cream (1 per person) like o m g pls don't miss out on this!

We visited Umiya for a late lunch AYCE, Tues. around 2:30 and there was only one other group seated, so virtually we had the whole huge open place to ourselves. (Liked that!) Once seated, it took her about ten minutes to come by and take our first order. I'll say only one thing about the service and that it was chilly but businesslike: take order, bring order, clear plates, take order, bring order -no eye contact, no smile, and no re-filling of beverages unless we requested. It is what it is. I can usually warm up any chilly server, but not this one! Might try sitting at the bar next time so as to not be 100% reliant on the server. 

Nonetheless, the food was pretty spectacular. If you're familiar with the AYCE sushi scene in Vegas, you get a little hard to impress after a short time. This was a happy surprise and I'm delighted to be impressed after so long... 

The menu was indeed very extensive. I'm sure you could visit many multiple times and never duplicate, yet leave full and happily satisfied. Since it was our trial run, I took some tips from previous yelpers... 
1. Screaming O salad: did not like this - it was like a mayonaise soup. Steer clear if you don't like a heavy-handed dose of the stuff. 90% mayo, coating of thick mayo on top, three thin slices of ahi underneath, and some lettuce swimming in the watery mayo soup at the bottom of the bowl. Now we know...
2. The snow white roll and orange blossom roll were FRIKKIN AMAZING. Snow white roll -each individual piece of the roll is ever so slightly grilled, so it has a whisp of a smokey flavor. My little tastebuds were freaking out. Insanely good, and so different! Orange blossom roll was also enjoyably different.
3. Red Rock roll - kind of forgettable, but I do remember thinking, ""ugh, more mayonaise?""
4. Rib eye steak - was just ok. 
5. Now, there's one thing on the menu we discovered this day I would place in the ""EXQUISITE"" category. The bacon wrapped scallop skewer. O. M. G. These tiny little gems come two (ONLY TWO?) to a skewer. Just trust me -you're going to want a few of these. I popped the first one in my mouth, and just had to sit there for a moment-what was this? Sweet, salty, chewy, fluffy... what? I just stared at my pal across the table. No words. Eyeballs scanned the restaurant for next closest waitress/server. ""Yes, another one of these, please?"" I forced my now-stuffed table-mate to try one because they are that good. Crack. Bacon-wrapped-scallop CRACK. 
6. Mango mochi for dessert. Couldn't hold a candle to the sweet candied bacon wrapped goodness I just described.

Few little notes:
- I could imagine a full house, with such a big open space and all hard surfaces would get pretty obnoxiously loud. Prepare, and time your dining session if that would bother you.  
-They charge $2 for green tea. This really chapped the hide of my dining partner. He was personally affronted -like they were charging for breathing air. Again, so now you know. 
- Service with a little charm doesn't cost anything, but apparently its not a priority here. Ok, got it. (The food outshines this aspect of Umiya.)

Overall: excellent and delightfully impressed, will be back, again at an ""off"" hour.

Is there anything better than taking a chance on a restaurant and finding a hidden gem that could become an absolutely favorite?!?!

By far one of the largest AYCE menu selections. Although some of the selections are a 1x order only it's an absolute must try! 

The staff was friendly and attentive. When my gf and I ordered the food came out rather quickly. The seafood salad was absolutely yummy!

The decor is beautifully understated. Long tables with wooden benches. Not the average sushi spot with tables. Great place for groups!

4553417,2016-04-04,0,q-zZgXKAQFLEgMp9ZNllgQ,"This. Place. ROCKS! 

The little known secret about AYCE sushi joints in Vegas is that most of them have marginal sushi. Maybe that's why they don't care how much you eat because they aren't spending for the best quality or hiring great sushi chefs. So I was a little skeptical when I left the gym and decided that if there was ever a time to give it a shot it was when I was carb depleted and starving. :) 

One fantastic thing about Umiya is that they let you order half rolls which gives you a chance to try a lot of different options. Let's just say that I took full advantage of this option! The big winners for me were AJ Tuna (unreal!), Orange Blossom (love the sauce), Yum Yum Crab Roll (perfectly named), Spicy Tataki Roll, Vegas Lasagna and Crunch Lobster Roll. 

Another thing that led to the 5 Stars was the service. Friendly, prompt and they kept the food coming without much of a wait at all. Some AYCE waiters/waitresses act like you are stealing food from their children's mouths every time you order another item (OK, maybe only like they have to pay for it personally but you get the point). Not this place. They would have just kept it coming but everyone has their limit and I tapped out full, satisfied and happy that I found this place. And all for $26! Cannot beat that price for the quality of this food, volume of choices and awesome service.

They open until 2am, so my first impression would be that the food won't be fresh and that they would be rushing us to get out of there, lack of service. I was totally wrong!! We came and opt for the AYCE and the owner (I think) said they stopped taking orders around 1:20am so we were okay with that. We were seated and I ordered whatever that caught my attention to ensure I got to try everything before the cut off time. Everything was made to order and served in little platters one by one and everything was delicious!! They limit certain dishes to one at a time which is good because I would've just ordered probably 3 plates of everything because my eyes are bigger than my stomach! They have ramen, steak, teriyaki, nigiri, tempura, appetizers, dessert, grilled fish, etc! It's about $27 per person after tax and it is definitely worth it. Also, free soda with Yelp check in. Everything was nice, hot and fresh except for the uni, which was so bad you can see it in the color but it was okay because it was near closing so I skipped it. I especially like the fresh oysters and the spicy tuna over crispy rice! Felt bad I couldn't finish some items because I was so full and I read that if you don't finish your food, you will be charged for it! I got scared so I forced myself to it but the owner was really nice, she brought out the check and didn't charge us for it and not only did her and her employees didn't make us feel rushed or bad we came in late but they were really friendly!

We were seated promptly after walking in however it took about 10 minutes before someone offered drinks or a menu. Once we had menus several people stopped in a 3 minute span to ask if we wanted to order. 

They were prompt in getting rolls and nigiri out. As far as the nigiri it was reallllly good. They werent overly thick or large pieces. I also had a screaming O salad with tuna and it was delicious. The spicy garlic Edamame was cold and tasted like it was tossed in just sriracha with no garlic.  The rolls left a little to be desired.they tasted alright.  They were not very neat. What I mean is they were messy. One roll we ordered kept coming unrolled when we would use the chopstick to grab a piece. One roll had an excess of crunch on top. I'm all for crunch I really am but it went everywhere, I have never had crunch on a Japanese lasagna either. There wasn't anything special about the sauces on top (if any.) mostly just straight sriracha or eel sauce. One roll came out to us with no sauce but the description had a ponzu sauce and spicy mayo so we couldn't tell if it was even the right roll. Now I know you're thinking well did you tell someone. We tried. After several failed attempts we just ate it. One thing I really liked was they offer macarons! My husband loves mochi, I do not so when I saw chocolate macorons I was pretty excited and they were good! Another odd thing was our table was not level. It kept wobbling back and forth which is slightly irritating while eating. 

Recap: nigiri was great (salmon,tuna, yellow tail and red snapper) the rolls were meh but they weren't awful. The wobbling table was irritating and it seemed either every waiter showed up in 2 minutes to ask if you wanted to order or they disappeared for 10 minutes all together.",XOCXW96-T0_ekYt22z_4VQ,0,0,3,ZR51XI-ZexK2Ul2vjqCTtg

One of the best deals in Vegas.

Came here last week with a bachelorette party of 8. They seated half of the party that showed up first so I guess you don't need everyone to be there to get seated (and I think we had reservations). 3 out of 8 girls did not get the AYCE (1.5hr time limit) and those girls regretted big time! I was definitely NOT one of the 3 girls. It was an easy pick to do AYCE sushi for the price (about $30/person including a drink, tax, and tip) which was a good deal to me! 

What's better is the selection of food. You honestly want to eat so much from their menu, but you can't because your belly won't be able to take it. Choose wisely also because they supposedly charge you for any leftover food. In terms of taste, everything was tasty. I don't think I was disappointed with any of the items and when sharing with 4 other girls I honestly got to try so many food choices! After paying I totally remember that desserts come with AYCE, but the girls and I were ready to leave so we asked for our green tea ice cream in cups and the staff absolutely accommodated us and even gave us big scoops of ice cream! Yay! 

The only reason this establishment did not get a perfect rating from me was because after we got our drinks, our initial waitress never came back to us. It took 10-15 minutes to actually flag down another waitress just to start our first order of AYCE. The second waitress was helpful though. Overall, great choice for AYCE sushi!

I'm sorry to rip into this place, but I hope they read this. The oysters (which are my favorite thing to eat) were so bad I couldn't eat more than one.  It tasted so fishy and awful compared to the number of oysters I've had in my life.  The yellowfin tuna was like dull brown yellow with a fishy taste as well.  We were told if we didn't finish food from our all you can eat that we would be charged. Never have I ever left food because I didn't like it, until last night.  Soho blows this place away on a whole new level.  If you want a descent priced all you can eat sushi, I recommend GOYMON, and it's not that far.

We didn't want to pay a ridiculous amount of money like you I would on the strip, so our friend told us about this place and said it was BOMB! It was pretty packed when we got there so I'm guessing everyone had the same idea as us. 

All you can eat sushi?... but lets just all take a minute to appreciate those 5 words  I feel like sometimes when I eat raw seafood, I get a little picky and concerned if the quality is gonna be good... but OMG the food was so good! The fish looked fresh and everything came out in a timely matter. I didn't think we could eat so much sushi!! 

They give you a time limit of an hour and a half, which is more than enough time to eat as much as you want. They also have desserts! Alcohol and tea cost extra. Some items on the menu are limited to one per customer. + The menu has a lot of pictures and tells you exactly what's in it.

I suggest going with a group of people so that way you can eat a little bit of everything. Or if you're super hungry, you can just go by yourself. Either way, it's so worth it! Another suggestion is to order as you go. If you don't end up eating everything, they will charge you extra. So it's better to just order a few things at a time so you know you can finish everything. Think I ended up paying only ~$30 (take in mind I ate like 4 rolls, an udon, steak, 3 appetizers, and dessert). I usually pay that much, if not more, for like 3 sushi rolls at other places. 

Definitely a must eat place if you love sushi and are super hungry! I was very impressed by how much food my friends and I consumed! I left feeling so food drunk  I will be back next time I'm in Vegas",NWgBRq2evY3lMsgsgMtLLw,3,2,4,0ZhEmhyuire8ueC7t-Noxw

Service is also tremendous here. They gave us a wrong order or an extra portion but quickly remedied the issue. They are also constantly available to take your orders and the food comes out so fast.

We came here after deciding not to spend $55 per person at a different buffet because we had a vegetarian and non-seafood eater in the group.  Well.. this place was clearly a mistake.

This place charges for anything you don't eat.. and boy, are they strict.  My hungry friend accidentally ordered a lot of items because she was super hungry.  Well, instead of bringing it out in waves so perhaps we could cancel some of our orders when we realized the sheer volume.. they just brought everything out within the span of 3 minutes.  Yes, our ENTIRE table was full of food.  Did the waitress warn us or did they tell us about their policy (which is printed in their menu)?  Nope.. they knew this would happen.  In fact, after all the food came out.. a male waiter came to our table to let us know they would charge us.. then as we looked at the TON of rice they put on everything (which is how they get you.. with that much rice, you really can't eat that much more than two orders.. why don't they try to make the proportions smaller so nobody really wastes food), they sent this waitress to our table to lecture us like children.  Never in ALL THE RESTAURANTS I HAVE BEEN TO HAS THIS EVER HAPPENED.  That alone will get me to go to the six hundred other restaurants in Vegas.  It was rude and completely unnecessary.  

Oh and when we were talking about how this service was terrible where none of the waitstaff was anywhere nearby.. they magically appeared and seemed to know what we discussed.  For sure.. they have microphones at the tables so watch out.. the food police will be on you.

They overcharged us $20.  Dinner is $25.  If you were to truly finish all the rice for whatever you order, you'll probably be only able to order 3 items so they will make money off of you one way (the dinner buffet cost) or other (charge you for not finishing your food).  The food was okay.. a lot of it was standard.  Soft shell crab, uni, and sweet shrimp were good.  I wouldn't say anything stood out except the fact that the food came out within the span of 3 minutes so I would suspect they either have 10 chefs working in parallel OR that a lot of their stuff is made in advance which makes me question their freshness.

Still.. the lecturing that I got from this waitstaff is something I will never forget.  Learn how to be in the service industry or risk all your customers never returning.",z_9oeZ5aN8g8AzPNENht8w,1,0,2,XXX7swcNM_khA_CsOZGtNA

The waiting staff is very attentive. The busser do ask if you are satisfied or need any assistance.  

As much I enjoyed eating from it. There are a few things that bothered me:

- I had ordered Uni and had a shell piece in. It was quite noticeable. 
- I had a order that I waited longer than usual. Turns out it was given to the person next to me
- One of the roll I received was cold. A tempura based one. 

The service was exceptional fare for both ends of the house. I was very pleased with most of the items and selection and as well expectation. The only criticism I have if the chefs could be more wary of the food they produce and given to. I had the courtesy of sitting near the Expo/Lead cook. The available of items is exceptionally.

I started with their spicy tuna salad and it had a lot of flavor and different types of fishes mix with it. My friends and I ordered several specials orders such as the Hawaiian roll, firecracker and all the dishes was delicious.

The first visit was perfect. A friend was at running a booth at CES so i took him to this place. Just the two of us. Perfect! Good was great. The waitresses was very attentive to our needs. Cool. So 7 days later when my friend's last day at CES. We decided to go here as a group with my family and his family plus a friend. Total 6 of us. Bad! Service was horrible. It seemed as though they wanted us to hurry up and eat and leave. The table next to us cam it after us and they were given more attention than our table. My friends wife ask for low sodium soy sauce. They charged us $1.50. Not a big deal but i dont recall regular soy sauce and low sodium soy sauce were much different in price at the market. After our dinner we were charged a service fee. Which most of the time i would give more. But this time I didn't the server deserve what any tip. Her service was horrible. So my suggestion is dont go here if you have a big group.

This time we paid more attention, UMIYA is right next door of Starbucks. It looks small from outside but inside is very modern and upscale looking.
I was very surprised by the quality of foods for AYCE sushi place. Food was fantastic, me and my husband was so busy to eat to take any pictures. When we realized we were only able to take two pictures. We really liked everything we ordered. Orange blossom roll, The bacon wrapped scallop skewer, Marinated Pork Belly, Baby Octopus skewer, Fresh Oyster, Crunch lobster Roll( plenty of real lobster)....I can't remember any more but all was so good. 
I highly recommend this place to anyone love sushi but don't eat AYCE sushi because the poor quality of food @most of AYCE sushi places.

You have one designated waiter/waitress that is incredibly attentive as to when you need to order, what you need, etc.  But you also have the ENTIRE wait staff coming to check up on you to make sure everything is going well.  I don't think I've gone more than 5 minutes without someone asking me if I need a refill, need to order anything, or if everything is good so far.  It might sound annoying, but it really isn't.  They do it so casually, it doesn't even bother your meal.  I am completely loyal to this place now specifically because of how AMAZING their staff is.  Also!  My waitress was incredibly knowledgeable about the menu.  She picked out two great rolls for me when I asked which one she thinks I should get.  She took her time to go through all of the options for me and made sure that I would love it.     

Food portion:  I really LOVE their meal portion for AYCE.  You get one complete roll, but the rolls aren't fat.  They're cute size.  So you don't feel overwhelmed with one roll.  This is great with AYCE, that means you can order a lot more rolls and still be able to eat them all.  There isn't a lot of rice on their sushi, which gives you room to eat a lot more.  

If you see my past Sushi reviews, I tend to lose loyalty if the service is terrible.  Needless to say, this place has gotten my loyalty and I will definitely be back.  How I know that this service isn't a fluke:  I overheard an experienced waiter teach a new waiter to make sure to always be attentive to all of the tables.  Not just his, but all of them.  I heard him go over how if you see a dirty plate, you take it away immediately.  You make sure you go around and ask if everyone is doing okay.  Refill their drinks, etc.  That's how I know that they take their customer service serious and that this isn't a once in a full moon service.  This is type of service that they strive for.

I refused to eat the uni because the color was brownish looking, very scary. I mentioned that to the waiter and explained it to her the reason I could not eat it. Another waiter came and explained to me the head chef has told him that's how the uni looking like recently. He came and showed me the entire piece to prove that they weren't giving me the old ones. I appreciated they took time and explained. However, I would still not eat it since it looked really awful. 
However their rolls and cooked stuff were not so bad. The only thing I would eat from the place is hamachi kama( the yellowtail collar) , that was pretty good and most of the ayce places don't include that.

Called ahead to see if Goyemon had a wait and they did so we ended up at Umiya~
I didn't know it was Korean owned until the server started speaking to us in Korean haha awesome~ The place is a nice size, looks modern & is clean with a few flat screens and k pop music playing in the backround.. reminds me of the Korean bars in LA with their wooden tables (some people might not like the bench seating but at least you're not forced to share a table with strangers..) but they also have a few regular tables towards the back.. 
Our server was friendly and fast.. 

We both did the AYCE dinner ($26.96) 
and started off with:
-tuna poke salad (1/pp)- good chunks of tuna, nice marinade and not too much salad
-seared salmon salad (1/pp)- I liked the salmon quality and it came on a bed of greens & daikon
-salmon skin salad- I wish the salmon skin was crispier
-raw oyster (2pieces/pp)- wasn't the best quality but better than Hikari's 
-seared tuna sashimi with AJ sauce (2pieces/pp)- good quality I liked the sauce it was creamy & tangy
-agedashi tofu- yummy
-softshell crab- these were HUGE 
-monkey brain- spicy tuna stuffed avocado.. it's deep-fried but doesn't mention that on the menu
-grilled yellowtail- was kind of dry and they were out of salmon & yellowtail collar

Then we got assorted nigiri:
-quality- ok...it's not that it was bad but the fish quality was just not all there for me.. Some things like the ikura tasted SUPER fishy and the coloring on some of the fish like the tuna was dull and not appetizing.. Also they charge extra for quail egg and soy paper even when you do AYCE.. They don't have fresh scallops on the menu :( What I did LOVE was their fish to rice ratio.. they give you very little rice.. YAY ;]]] 

I also noticed some things we ordered never made it to the table like baby octopus skewers, pork belly, fried shrimp heads.. So there must have been some miscommunication with the kitchen.. 

Like I said over-all experience was a 3.5... I think I will come back for a lunch bento box or back if they did some Happy Hour prices on their apps and rolls but maybe not for AYCE.. well not until they step up their fish quality game haha ~

We were greeted warmly and with a smile which is always a good start to your meal. They have picnic tables in the larger eating areas for those large groups coming for good sushi. With smaller tables scattered about the main dining floor is not to cluttered. We were lucky we got to sit towards the back in one of there rooms that was portioned off by curtains.

Our waitress was a very polite young lady who took care of us really well. My apologies I for got her name.  
The sushi was delicious, period! AYCE for $26 was a great deal. You are always kinda skeptical when you see AYCE sushi for such a great price. We were happily surprised with the quality and portions. Most of our meal we did the half portions which is a good option if you want to try a little bit of everything. After our waitress took our drink orders it was on. Mom & Steph ordered the yuzu drink and loved it so much. We started our first round off with 2 orders of monkey brains, 2 orders of Japanese lasagne, 4 orders yellow tail, 2 orders unagi, 1 order spicy scallop. All was amazing! Portions and sushi on the smaller side but good cause you can eat all kinds of different types of sushi. Second round was more Japanese lasagne 2, 4 yellow tail, 2 maguro, one order each of the rice-less sushi which was different but good, crunchy scallop roll 1. Third round was more yellowtail, maguro, mom got an udon and that was it. We threw in the towel. An amazing meal and a wonderful dining experience. Thank you to the staff at Umiya Sushi on flamingo!

I've dined here on several occasions and each time was because I was REALLY HUNGRY and wasn't feeling the wait at either Goyemon or Sushi Koma during prime times (around 7pm) of the night. This place can really turn and burn- and for an AYCE restaurant? I'm quite impressed.

The quality of the food wasn't there for me. The first couple of bites after coping with starvation is good but it's sad to realize that you're judgement will drastically change once you're 30% full. The menu is more extensive than most AYCE restaurants but I guess that's why you're getting mediocre quality dealing with the amount of overhead this place carries. The fresh oysters? Probably my favorite part of the place but it limits one time order per diner. Bummer, really.

The service really stood out for me. The staff didn't mind how busy it was and was heavily focused on attending to our every need. Water refills, clearing empty plates off the table, letting our server know that we wanted to order more; their teamwork have earned their high tip since working at an AYCE restaurant can seem annoying.

The best part? Food will literally come out the minute after you order. I'm not sure if this is a good or bad thing but it was definitely good since we were hungry. If I'm ever on a time restraint, I'll come back. If I'm looking for quality vs. quantity, I won't. This place has its perks though.",P49ulSRSHLNnIP-efK-qhw,3,1,4,h55BbaKMnG8YfxLMqBja3g

I ordered an assortment of sushi and non-sushi items and I can't say any one of them stood out.  Everything did have a common theme and it's that NOTHING was fresh.  The white tuna and the sweet shrimp had this fishy (old) odor emanating from them and the other fish were sticky, kind of like when you sweat and it dries on your skin.

Overall, not worth the price or the quality.  I understand that Las Vegas isn't exactly near the ocean so the fish is probably sent in frozen but everything just tasted like it was on the verge of going rotten.  The staff kept messing up our order and the table next to us had to tell the waiter/waitress several times that they didn't order something that they brought over.  Not to mention, the staff were a bit rude in trying to rush us out after less than 1 hour into our meal just because people were waiting and we weren't even close to reaching their self imposed 2 hour limit.

Everyone likely has opinions on the merits of AYCE sushi concept.  However, for us, the tastebuds want what the tastebuds want.  Looking for a place we hadn't previously tried, we went to Umiya Sushi for its AYCE lunch on a Friday.  Located in a strip mall on W. Flamingo just past the Palms, Umiya Sushi offered a decent price ($20.95/person for lunch) for its AYCE sushi.  We sat at the sushi bar in the dimly lit restaurant.  I found the selection offered to be merely average and of seeming lesser quality/freshness (the poké comes immediately to mind) compared to other AYCE sushi places we've been to in Las Vegas.  Service was hit or miss, too, as items that we ordered were forgotten and only delivered after we asked about them or were simply forgotten and we didn't feel the need to inquire about the forgotten item since we had other places to be and things to do.  Umiya Sushi was merely average, at best, and easily the most forgettable meal we had while we were in town.  Call it 2.5 stars, rounded up to 3.",le3Xn9Mheb1hNxWurF7RSw,6,5,3,OU5RrQXOhvA2DTn0cPQV9A

The reason I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because even though the food was really good, the service wasn't. We were there for 2.5 hours total and they completely forgot about 2 of the rolls that i ordered and the rest of the food took an extremely long time to hit the table.

5051069,2013-05-12,3,q-zZgXKAQFLEgMp9ZNllgQ,"There's many AYCE in town and you gotta standout to get noticed. A few things going for them off the bat - right by the strip ( off Flamingo in the strip mall by the Palms casino) so easy for industry folks and tourist to hit up, it's nicely decorated, open late until 2am daily and the menu selection is large and offering unique items other spots do not in terms of appetizers. Probably a good place to take folks who aren't sushi people when you want to eat sushi yet try to still meet them halfway. 

Appetizers 
Screaming O Salad - seared salmon (or tuna - your choice) with spicy ponzu, mayo, shredded daikon, mixed greens - decent but I think I prefer without the greens which is how most places do it.
Oysters - it was a  briny varietal probably from SoCal waters so I'm not a fan.
Tuna sashimi w/ AJ sauce - good but only 2pcs 
Grilled Yellowtail collar - awesome! one of my favorite things, but most places you can only order one whereas there isn't a order limit here! 
Soft Shell Crab - another favorite and theirs were lightly battered but crisp and with a tiny bit of Japanese mustard sauce on top. 
Bacon wrapped scallop skewer - reminds me of bacon wrapped dates as the sauce had that similar sweet flavor about it 
spicy rice cake skewer - crisp outside and chewy inside, the way I prefer my dokbokki
Crispy rice with spicy tuna - these were large compared to other places and came 4 to a order! 
Pork belly - pretty good and base. It's thin slices and grilled like KBBQ, not roasted in a big hunk and then sliced.

Nigiri 
There are daily specials so ask a server or look at the small glowing board on the left wall of the sushi bar. The specials today were sea bream which was fresh and really good, spanish mackerel which was decent though I thought maybe the sauce was slightly too sweet for it, giant clam which was crunchy in a surprising way and I like the thin slice of nori on it.
Super white - pretty fresh here! 
Seared Salmon - more like peppered style than a fresh torch like some bars do. I liked it and enjoyed the flavor of the pepper and ponzu sauce. 
Peppered Albacore - this was good, but thought the seared salmon was better.
Yellowtail - this was just OK, had a different flavor about it. Don't know how to describe, just different and the BF didn't like it. 
Tuna - acceptable level of freshness, but nothing outstanding. 
Masago - good, but I don't know when masago is ever bad. 
Uni - pretty fresh and was sweet so I was pleased.
Mackerel - not a salty nor vinegary brine to this so I wonder if it was cured at all? It was fresh though, but not what I'm accustomed to. 

Sushi 
Snow White - this is the BFs favorite roll elsewhere and I think it's better made here. It's spicy diced up soft shell crab, avocado topped with super white tuna that's been torched and then Japanese mustard sauce. 
Salmon Skin Hand Roll - it wasn't crispy enough so it wasn't too pleasing to have a few bites with chewy skin bits. 

Rice to fish ratio here was very good, more fish than there is rice for sure. No roll half orders except for one per person here. Like always, stuff like uni and specials are one per person as well. 

Dessert is included. and we got a mochi and a tempura green ice cream.

Service 
The service was very nice. We had a male server that checked on us and was super friendly explaining everything. We also had a female server that took our initial orders and also often brought us plates. The sushi bar was also friendly and asked if everything was tasting right and how was our experience at the end of the meal. It's evident that they do care about the customer, which is hugely appreciated by me. 

I don't think they have a stamp card, at least non was offered to us.

Overall, this was a solid inaugural visit. I think it has a lot of good things going for it so I'm sure I'll be back. I don't think it tops my favorite spot, but I think it's good to put into the rotation.",n86B7IkbU20AkxlFX_5aew,9,4,4,fEPFe_ObUIShykcdjTLVkQ

I'm not a big fan of rolls but their banana roll was amusing. I believe it is my had avocado, shrimp tempura, and a sweet piece of banana on top. And the usual sushi rice of course.

Their oysters were alright, not too bad but definitely need more lemon and sauce. Some were a little bit fishy though. Bigger than regular oysters FYI.

Poke salad was pretty good, but the cerviche was okay. Nothing to write home about. People were also raving about the seared sashimi but I thought it was alright. 

To end the night, the pineapple sherbet and pistachio almond ice cream were the best finishing touches on a quite satisfying meal.

The staff was also super nice, fast, and hard-working. Bless them cuz it was packed on Christmas day. About an hour wait at 6:30 pm. Would definitely recommend when you need that sushi fix.",GR5zk5ur7YvMWb2HH9YYCg,2,0,5,1HzTANfTVC3kyxzBaUqhQQ

They have a good selection of rolls, but I don't think they are to die for. A lot of their rolls come with the sauce on the side instead which would make them taste a little better.

I'm not sure if this is just a Socal thing which is where I am from, but usually for AYCE sushi they limit you to the number of rounds you can order sushi but at this restaurant there were no limits for number of rounds which was great because it took off the pressure for what to order.  There was a variety of things to chose from other than sushi like tempura, udon, chicken, etc.  All the food tasted very fresh and I like that it comes in small portions as well.  You can also order the rolls in half rolls if you want to be able to try more rolls without getting full as quickly.

The only thing that has room for improvement was the grilled hamachi but it was still edible.  The thing I wish would be different is that they would stop charging for hot tea and soft drinks... :-/

They explain the rules up front: 90 minutes, items with a 1 you can only order once per person, if there's a D it's dinner only, and if you leave too much behind you will pay extra! Knowing that...we started!
Major pro: for the sushi rolls you can do a half order! This is awesome! It allowed us to experience so much more! So here is what we ordered:
Tuna poke- tender, favorable, delicious 
Miso ramen- eh. Not the star of the party. Tasted like packaged ramen. 
Pork belly- YUMMY! Flavorable, crisp, delicious! 
Yum yum roll- this was my favorite! So much flavor!
Vegas lasagna- again delicious! Excellent blend of flavors
Shrimp lover roll- basic but good 
Rattlesnake roll- this was my least favorite roll. It wasn't bad, but I could do without it 
Banana roll- this was surprisingly good. The sweet of the banana and the savary of the crab inside was a good pairing 
Green chili tempura roll- I didn't taste green chili. This is another roll I could do without. It wasn't bad, it was just ok
Fresh n easy roll- wrapped in cucumber and no rice, it was good! I liked it! 

I'm leaving here about 10 lbs heavier but it was worth it! If you're visiting Vegas come here. You won't be disappointed!",YGJlTKA9iLJLnt1q7wxvUA,1,1,5,cvkR3jYLP6aiW92Ou7vf3g

First of all, the location of the restaurant is very convenient and it's in a good area, near the Palms Casino on Flamingo only a 10 minute drive from the Strip.

Secondly, the service is very fast and efficient.  The Manager is constantly walking around to make sure that all of your orders are completed.  He even followed up on a few orders that was missed and heard him in the radio to his staff to hurry up the order (in Korean, watching Korean soap operas are paying off).

Third of all, the restaurant is spacious and has feels even bigger with very high ceilings.  The tables are quite large, enough to hold all of the food you will soon order. 

The sushi is not bad, nothing really stands out from other AYCE sushi places and are pretty much on par in terms of quality and selection.

However, if you're a roll person, my friend ordered a few which were pretty delicious. Their appetizer menu is larger than most. I would say it's comparable to that of OYSHI. My favorites being the spicy garlic edamame and spicy tuna crispy rice. 

Service has always been up to par. The servers are generally friendly and attentive. It's never so crazy busy in there that you feel as though you're ignored and can't put an order in.

Sat at the bar and the workers were nonstop talking to each other in Korean which is cool, but they completely ignored us the entire time and I felt like I was annoying them  to interject an order. It was like we weren't even there.

Now to the food. TOO MUCH SAUCE!

My first roll came drenched in this oily sauce where I couldn't even pick up a piece of the roll without it crumbling. The rice was cold and hard and just horrible. My girlfriend tried one piece and didn't even want to finish it with me.

I ordered another roll after that and asked the guy if he could put the sauce on the side. 
He called the order out to someone else and the thing came drenched in this oily nasty sauce AGAIN where you can't even taste what fish you are having...couldn't tell if it was red snapper or tuna or salmon. 

Pissed me off that he totally ignored my request for sauce on the side.

I ordered another roll...told him PLEASE NO SAUCE.

He calls out the order to have one of his friends make it...and how does it come?

COMPLETELY SOAKED in sauce a third time. My girlfriend who hated the sauce, just ate ramen and was disgusted by the whole experience.

I've been to many AYCE joints that try to pull a little fusion with these different sauces, some creamy, some spicy, some whatever in an attempt to try and compliment the roll (so I'm not a total sauce Nazi)...but this place DESTROYS it's sushi with this nasty oily sauce that doesn't compliment the sushi whatsoever and makes it unbearable to finish. 

This was my worst AYCE sushi experience in Vegas to date. 

Get your act together, listen to your customers...and give a shit about their requests. 

Your sauce is effing gross. I didn't come to eat half a bottle of oil based Ken's salad dressing.",r52bugu98l77gdqTnIJ2oQ,9,2,2,FGSP5q75y0oRvYcg_14W0A

     To start off the pricing is just like other AYCE sushi places - $25.00 using yelp you also get a free soda! 
      The staffs gotta be the best as well since you basically don't get one specific server and all the servers work together which isn't something you'll see everyday.

First off, everything nigiri is excellent. Tuna, salmon, red snapper, smoked salmon- I'm going through withdrawals as I write this. Gotta add some healthy to it, so I always order a veggie roll. Awesome. Hand rolls were great too.

The crispy rice with spicy tuna is delish! Pork belly, bacon wrapped scallops, monkey brains were surprisingly good- fried avocado stuffed with spicy tuna. 

Service was absolutely excellent as well. We sat at the bar and the sushi chefs were friendly, fast and made great rolls. The waitresses were actually the ones who took our orders and our plates away as soon as we were done with them.

While we were settling in, one of the sushi rollers dropped off a salmon sashimi salad in front of us which we thought was complementary, as in our past experience at sushi joints sitting at the bar sometimes yields tasting plates on the house. Well, apparently this was not meant for us. When our server came back to take our order, a man whom I can only assume to be the owner or manager started yelling, asking if we ordered the tiny salad in front of us. I said no. And he began to yell at the workers behind the counter. It was very strange and uncomfortable. I finished the rest of the salad, which ended up being the best thing we ate. 

Our plate of sashimi was made and given to us by the same man, who dropped the plate and then quickly picked something off a piece of tuna before saying, ""ok it's good."" Not very reassuring... All the fish - salmon, tuna, and super white tuna, left a strange after taste that was off putting. Doesn't need to be said, but not a good sign when eating raw fish. 

Lychee martini tasted of straight lychee juice with a splash of saki and had whole ice cubes floating in it. Rolls were reasonably priced and large in size, but again, I just didn't feel the fish tasted all that fresh, and even the avocado on them looked past its prime. 

Service is a mess and food nor drinks make up for it. Would not go back or recommend. Shout out to the sushi roller though. He was really friendly and cool.",7J__wa-UVbq5p54m9A9UQA,3,0,1,L2Ye40LHapXqF4uqnuPWDg

Word of advice: Order half rolls!!!! Gives you the opportunity to taste different things off the menu and knit pick which ones are your favorites.

What I didn't like and have had better in other sushi restaurants: lobster crunch, super white tuna and green tea ice cream.  The langoustine on the lobster crunch tasted too briny.  The super white tuna was rubbery and didn't taste fresh.  The green tea ice cream tasted like medicine.  It reminded me of the time I ate green tea ice cream I had in the freezer for a year.

I've never been to an all you can eat sushi place before, but I've had some real good high quality sushi and a lot of yelpers said they have fresh sushi; so I had to give them a try.

It was near midnight and there were a few groups. We didn't have to wait, we sat at the sushi bar. I was real excited for the AYCE menu. We ordered a variety of sushi and sushi rolls. The sushi didn't taste fresh and the rice was hard and dry. It tasted as if they used regular rice instead of sushi rice. The sushi rolls were nothing spectacular. They were very simple and was not worth it.

I don't think I do very well at AYCEs. I was expecting really fresh fish, but they didn't deliver on quality. I'm beginning to think Las Vegas restaurants are overhyped. I've been to a few with high reviews, but they've only disappointed.

For the same price I could eat a simpler, but fresher sushi meal elsewhere. Our server was friendly and attentive, but the sushi chefs looked arrogant and rude. They didn't talk to us much and we ordered some sushi rolls from them, but they didn't seem happy and even frowned as us. 

For some reason, I don't usually give second chances if my experience was horrible, but I want to come back when I'm in town; so I can see what this place has to offer. Perhaps it was a mishap, perhaps they do suck. Only a second visit will tell.",2s27wyX1hn2lL1jv5Sn36w,7,2,1,irroFUXSmxuU3cnCXLdRZQ

I was really looking forward to visiting this place due to its high ratings. So, when my sushi-loving brother came to town, I decided to take  him there. Big mistake. The staff was rude, the food was rushed, and good flavors were nowhere to be found.

There was no greeting when we walked in, and all the person at the check-in desk said was ""you are going to have to wait, ok?"" After waiting for about 10 minutes (mind you, we had reservations), the same rude server walked us over to our table and sat us down. No interest in knowing if it was our first time, nothing... he just left. Once our waiter knew some of us were not doing AYCE, every server became obsessed wanting to know why that was the case. They repeated the AYCE no-sharing rules several times, despite everyone understanding we could not share the food.

Most dishes were wrong and bland, with the servers dropping off dishes we hadn't ordered and then running off to waiting other tables. We then had to flag down any of the servers running by to take the unwanted food away. I get they were busy, but the way the staff was literally running around and essentially plopping food on the table and leaving, made for an unnecessarily awful ambiance.

5366102,2013-08-16,4,q-zZgXKAQFLEgMp9ZNllgQ,"I tried Umiya during my recent visit to Vegas since it was close to my hotel. The restaurant is about a mile off the strip, across the street from Palms Place.

Upon entering, the sushi chefs shout out 'Hello' and 'Welcome' greetings in Korean. In the background, there are TVs with PSY music videos playing on repeat (Gangnam style and Gentleman). Kind of strange to be in a Korean environment while eating Japanese sushi, but if you focus on the food, the awkwardness can be filtered out.

Umiya carries a similar menu to other Vegas AYCE sushi restaurants. For example, tuna, albacore, super white tuna, salmon, yellowtail, halibut, red snapper, shrimp, eel, mackerel, etc are on the sushi list. However, Umiya distinguishes itself from the pack by offering premium sushi. There are 3 daily specials of high quality fish. During my visit, they were spanish mackerel, giant clam, and striped bass. Sometimes, the specials may include sea bream and giant scallop. These varieties are rarely found in common AYCE sushi lists. On top of that, there were oysters, uni, and ama-ebi. All of the premium and special items have a limit of 1 order, but it was not really enforced since order forms and records were not used. 

The oysters, uni, spanish mackerel, and halibut were my favorites. The quality and freshness of the fish were invariably excellent. Fish were cut thick, characteristic of the Korean preference. Unfortunately, the presentation was sometimes poor. Sauces were overapplied to the fish at times, resulting in sauce overflowing onto the plate and rice. A carefully-crafted piece of nigiri should not have ponzu or soy sauce staining the rice before it reaches the consumer. This is a common occurrence in Korean sushi restaurants.

Organization was another issue that I encountered. Umiya did not utilize order forms at the bar. Each customer is expected to order in front of a chef. Unfortunately, the chefs could not handle large orders. I tried making 10 orders at once but he was overwhelmed and could only remember 4 to 6 at a time. When the restaurant filled up halfway during our meal, I was neglected for over 30 minutes in favor of the new diners. An order form might be useful for Umiya to implement in the future.

Aside from the aforementioned issues, Umiya is still phenomenal for the price. $25 for unlimited decent seafood with premium options is an exceptional deal. This is perfect for those who are hungry, seeking a budget sushi restaurant in Vegas, and can sacrifice a little bit of quality. I am already anticipating a visit to Umiya during my next visit to Vegas.",YHr-ijGyWQg3hsP-sEEl4A,7,4,4,enC4QLVCgpof1Zx5DWIM0Q

They played catchy pop music both in English & Japanese and that was fun. Their decor was what interest me the most as it wasn't the typical sushi restaurant with basic seating. You just gotta see it for yourself. Awesome! We were able to order half rolls on ALMOST everything on the menu, which gave us the opportunity to try basically everything. We ordered 3-4 rolls at a time to keep a steady pace, and we received our orders within 5 minutes. I'm only giving 4 stars simply because we also ordered soup midway into our visit & we asked for it probably 3 times. They just kept forgetting about it.

5444859,2017-03-14,0,q-zZgXKAQFLEgMp9ZNllgQ,"In this city of sushi bars galore, finding a good one can be tough. In the past, I had two favorites. One of which (whose name I can't even remember) was in The Lakes area and closed many years ago. The other one, Kobe, I have since moved too far away from to justify making the hike for AYCE lunch. For all I know, it could end up being dinner by the time I get there from where I currently live. 

So, the hunt began for me to find a new sushi joint. I've heard many sing the praises of Yama. I wasn't impressed. Sushi-Mon? Overrated. Ra Sushi? Decent rolls, obnoxiously clubby and trendy atmosphere coupled with high prices and the lack of AYCE. I learned that many of the no-name joints where the main sign literally just says ""sushi"" are like that for a reason. Sushi 21 was my main go-to for a while, and it was pretty decent, but that's it. Nothing mind-blowing. Eager to have sushi but wanting something mind-blowing, I was led to try this place.

Yes. This place is pretty mind-blowing indeed. It actually blows my prior two faves out of the water.

Located in a strip mall that appears to be slowly becoming Little Tokyo due to all the Japanese-related businesses popping up, it is a space that is fairly large but still maintains a degree of intimacy. The music is noticeable, but not TOO noticeable. The servers are attentive and friendly. 

As for the menu? Probably the most extensive AYCE menu I've ever seen. For starters (no pun intended), the list of appetizers is so long that it takes up a whole page. I've never seen that before. There's also some very creative rolls indeed. A chicken katsu roll? Again: Mind. Blown.

Everything came out quite fast, with the pork belly being sizzling hot and the right balance of tough and tender. The chicken katsu being tiny in the most satisfying way possible. Their eel sauce was off the chain. The lobster roll was a bit messy, but that's easily forgiven. I mean, it's chunk lobster meat after all. 

The Final Verdict:

Pros:
Great ambiance and dining setting.
Large AYCE menu at a decent price (20.95 for Lunch)
Copious amounts of appetizers on the AYCE menu.
Fresh, flavorful and creative rolls.

Cons:
Messy lobster roll....but this is minor. 
Yum-yum sauce and japanese-style mayo seemed to be everywhere.

Suggestions:
Lay off the Japanese mayo please.

Return Factor: 10/10. Already planning on it.",h-nw7NECMw5qo1LEmpXxeQ,3,1,5,PCcgvFG6qIfXm1rF01mNYA

We got waters and lay down our first round of orders. This was okay, but after this service slowed down. I was feeling a little sick soon after and this might've been because of the quality of food. 

We'd be constantly overlooked and ignored and we were in the middle of the restaurant! I'd watch other tables get serviced except for us. Service is just bad. They let people wait up front when there are clearly tables empty and ready to go. They say AYCE can only last 90 minutes, but we can't help how long we stay when no one takes our orders! 

This was our second time eating here and service was still just as poor(first time was a few months ago). Bathrooms were dirty as well. Food was good for the most part, just bad service.",QQ7eAwcRYcs3xGWr4Jf97A,1,0,3,NUjc3FHZszieSWPS39YsQw

I told her about our issue last time with not being able to get our favorite roll that we have gotten for the past year. She was very surprised and went up to the chefs and they made us two of them on the spot.

5517533,2016-12-08,2,q-zZgXKAQFLEgMp9ZNllgQ,"This was the first time I walked into a sushi spot where we didn't get no ""irrashaimase"", sushi chefs all looking down, host's back facing us. When he did turn around it was to ask how many in our party. I normally don't prefer taking the whole crew out for an AYCE sushi, but on this night we did. It wasn't as busy when we entered in comparison to when we left. We were able to get seated pretty quick. The tables are more of picnic style seating where their tables are connected so be prepared to share another end with another couple/family.

Since the whole crew was present, that meant a highchair was needed. I quickly made a mental note to never bring the babies with me when coming here because the highchair is seated at the end of the table where they have this button system...which of course any curious toddler/baby turn into gumby just to press those buttons. Which....gets pretty annoying because the button isn't something you can move off. Therefore, you have to scootch the highchair more towards the corner of the table giving your kid an awkward seating and the potential to slam his/her face on that corner because he/she is throwing a fit over not being able to reach the button. Sigh.

Anyway, they have quite a selection for their AYCE. I found Umiya to be pretty good. I loved how their rolls/nigiris weren't rice/sauce overloaded. No fishy flavors which is a great thing! I personally ordered/tried their garlic tuna nigiri, crispy rice with spicy tuna, salmon lovers roll, vegetable tempura (a brocolli, zucchini, carrot), spicy garlic edamame (which wasn't spicy at all), spicy tuna toll, and their ribeye steak (which is like 4slices of steak served alone). The only thing I didn't really care for was their garlic edamame. I love edamame, didn't love it here. 

The husband had uni, ebi, fried shrimp heads, salmon belly, yuzu yellowtail, unagi, tuna, salmon, and aji. Don't even get me started on the quantities. Lol. He thought they were all pretty good. Typical.

Anyway, they clearly have a system. Water was quickly refilled, plates were quickly cleaned off, service wasn't neglectful at all...out of all the sushi spots we have ever been to...I swear it felt like 5mins after we ordered...we were getting our orders. I connected my eyebrows a few times upon getting our orders because the turn around was ridiculously quick! At this point...it was busy so getting our orders quick and it being busy...that was quite impressive. I looked back at the chefs a couple times convinced there was an octopus working. 

Even though we didn't get the greeting upon entering, my husband never getting his masago and me having to remind the waitress of an order and reminding one of the wait helps of the fork he was supposed to bring...we gave it a 4 because despite it all...thought our experience was pretty deserving of a 4. 

We'd come here again but I don't think this place is as kid-friendly especially if you have one needing to be in a high chair and that damn button system thing. Okay, so the button is to call your waiter over, red button is for your check, and I completely forgot what the other colored button was for but I believe it's for drinks. 

Definitely worth a try if you are looking to try a new spot. I'd say slip bringing the kids in so you can thoroughly bask in the ambiance and enjoy. But if you do bring the kids...highchairs have working buckles! For AYCE...kids ages 3-7 are 12.95 (half-off). Children 8 and up are full price. For desserts...their ice cream are unlimited except for the mochi. 1 each per person.

They offer a few dishes most AYCE sushi joints don't like ribeye Big Wong style, fresh oysters,  and kushiyaki (meat on a stick) options like bacon wrapped scallops.  It's actually a good place to bring that one friend who dislikes sushi.  I also like the all you can drink beer/wine/sake option for $10 more but they said they're going to change it next month.  Ummm....why??  

This location used to be Kaizen and you can definitely tell from the look of the place.  Interesting mix of old and modern and the long tables definitely encourage groups to stay a while.  We sat at the bar to pick the chefs brain on recommendations.  The whole staff was Korean.  Not too much of a big deal for me.  

Sushi standouts were the halibut and super white tuna nigiri.  The chef, Alex, said it was the freshest fish they had and it was great.  There were a ton of great options if you like cream cheese, rolls deep fried or something in unagi sauce.  I am not one of those people but knock yourself out a la Drago vs Creed if you are.  Basic rolls were fine and the freshness was acceptable.    

I was really intrigued that they offered both miso and tonkotsu ramen.  I just HAD to try half a bowl of tonkotsu made by Koreans.  The noodles, broth and 2 big pieces of pork belly were pretty good but it wasn't exactly Japanese ramen.  Koramen?  Alex took pride in the fact he made the broth from scratch as he should..it was tasty but not Japanese by any means.  

Service was definitely on top of things.  There were 3 waiters checking on us throughout the meal and earned their gratuity.",8DEyKVyplnOcSKx39vatbg,32,13,3,P25oZEhtfoRw0jDyiSpC0Q

I have to admit I expected better or more affordable. If you got the dough to blow for mediocre sushi then go for it. It was my bad. I was in a bind and needed to eat ASAP. 

I probably would either go to a more affordable place or go high-end. This middle of the road gets you crushed.",JWsbYJabmM9JgtmhjgnF0g,1,0,3,X_DjRq1SrZfrjUcTLdrVyQ

Sometimes it can be a little slow to get your first order in, but once it's in they are good about coming around often to ask if you need anything. Sometimes we have the same wait person and sometimes several come around. They are always pleasant no matter how busy it is. 

Good menu, favorites are the green valley roll and kiss of fire. If you don't like the crab with mayo like us you can say no crab and they are very good about that.

I rarely ever eat raw food besides tuna, and even then I can't stomach too much of it. However, this place changed my mind. I started with their spicy tuna salad (delicious!) and got hooked. Pretty much everything I ordered after that had spicy tuna in it!

We also ordered crunchy lobster roll, oysters, tuna naruto, red mountain, baby octopus, shrimp tempura, crispy rice with spicy tuna, and king of the ocean. Everything tasted great, no complaints from me or my boyfriend, we loved everything.

TIP: most rolls can be ordered half sized so that you don't get full from one roll and you can try a variety of menu items. (5 or 6 piece rolls and the whole deep fried rolls can't be half sized)

On that note, this place was up to par with all three of my criteria. 

It's a pretty place; modern, open, and stylish. It was dinner time and there weren't many people in there -- although, it was a Tuesday night. I like a social atmosphere, so being one of the few groups there was a downer. 

The service was great, outgoing, and very accommodating. They even let us order one last roll out of the 90-minute AYCE limitation. One of the best parts of Umiya is the full bar, a rarity in sushi places. 

The deals were the best part. Very competitive AYCE prices. Also, there were great sake deals with buy two, get one free (we had nine in total).

I'll be brief because this place was not very memorable.

The Good:
Decor (Very nicely decorated, lots of space and table room)
Salmon nigiri
Ika Nigiri
Yelp check-in = free drink

The Bad:
Service (No one even looked me in the eye, let alone acted friendly, aside from the lone waitress)
Yellowtail (Not horrible, but probably one of the worst I've had in Vegas)
Ikura (Noticeably small and tasted kind of funky)
Charge for hot tea

The Okay:
Everything else we ate (all nigiri, mochi ice cream)
Presentation (ex: tuna poke was haphazardly piled onto the place with seaweed salad, looked unappealing, bad cuts of fish)

Nigiri- maguro, hamachi, ono were all cut thinly and uneven, as if cut with an old knife. The tako was clearly over boiled and fishy which suggests it was cooked, frozen, then thawed again. All skewers were overly sauced taking out any flavor of being grilled. Miso soup was warm by the time we got it and lacked any seaweed or tofu. We did order one maki, a cucumber wrap instead of nori. That roll actually turned out to be quite refreshing and fun.

The wait staff seemed like they wanted us out quickly as they insisted on picking up the bill 3 times prior to us finishing our rock hard mochi ice cream. Pretty persistent on us leaving considering there was only 3 tables dining at 930pm on a Sunday night.

What a major disappointment this place was. Service was terrible; we had to ask for someone to take our order because the staff was busy chatting. We had to ask for our drinks twice. The teriyaki beef was so tough that I couldn't chew it. I ordered scallop & bacon skewers and got shrimp and bacon instead. Several dishes ordered we didn't get and got tired of trying to wave somebody down to ask for them finally just giving up. Sauces are thick and mayo based with zero flavor. Spicy tuna is NOT spicy.

Service seemed promising at first but as soon as they got busy for the dinner rush, it went downhill FAST. They should have staffed better on a Saturday evening, and dinner for that matter. 

The place is run by Koreans by the looks of it (if it matters to any of you). The tuna, salmon, and yellowtail were actually pretty good, IMO. Uni and sweet shrimp were pretty awful.  I didn't try the sweet shrimp nor uni personally but my friend wanted to gag on the sweet shrimp. I liked the tamago and masago. For dessert, they have tempura ice cream, regular ice cream, mochi ice cream, and banana split. Didn't get my spicy tuna salad either :(.

It took awhile to order when it got busy so it also took awhile to get our orders. We even ordered dessert (1 item per person) but never ended up getting them cause it took too long so we just left. We had already paid by then.

To sum it all up, for the price and my first experience, I will most likely not be coming back. I didn't try any of the rolls personally since I can only eat so much in one sitting. I think the sushi itself wasn't too shabby (for the ones that I tried) but the overall experience was just bleh. Hence the 3 stars as opposed to 2.

Their AYCE menu is pretty extensive, though. So if you can eat a lot, you can try a whole bunch of shiznits. Like pork belly, ribs, skewers, and salads among other things. I wouldn't say to not give it a chance, but just saying my first experience didn't make me keen on going back.",7weuSPSSqYLUFga6IYP4pg,1,1,3,SkkS0U7hU1kJF7-3L59qiQ

Sushi twister is still my go to spot, but its a bit far from the strip, about 20 minutes out. Ive been here 3 times now and sadly the best part of this place is their hot dishes. Bacon scallops are delicious, even though they are the sizs of a nickle. The sushi was a huge disappointment my last visit a couple of days ago. Like alot of other reviews say, the fish just doesnt taste that fresh like its been sitting at room temp for too long. And the unagi is a bit on the rubbery side compared to good fresh and properly grilled unagi that is flaky and delicious. The salmon belly honestly had a sour aftertaste which totally ruined my appetite for raw fish from this place. The salmon roe is way saltier and fishier than at sushi twister.
Probably wont be back for a while. I also find it funny that all the employees yell japanese greetings even though they are all korean but thats beside the point. All the sushi chefs are young korean dudes, and you can tell they dont put enough pride into their sushi here.. the taste just isnt nearly as good as the competition.",2r0CnsEbhBo75KYoVF8eGA,0,0,3,VVz7QDXy9qGOh6vuQBhE1g

5778803,2014-05-10,6,q-zZgXKAQFLEgMp9ZNllgQ,"I really don't get all of the great reviews for this place - this wasn't the worst sushi I've ever had, but it comes pretty close to the bottom of the list. If it matters to you, this is a very Korean sushi place, not Japanese run - complete with K-pop videos and a particularly cute flower boy (pretty) waiter who looked straight out of my Korean dramas. 

Service was very friendly and since it was empty, the food came out ridiculously fast. This is normally a positive, except that in this case, speed meant careless and sloppy sushi. I got mostly nigiri and everything seemed pretty fresh, but the rice was borderline hard, and the nori was coming off nigiri and hand rolls. My friend's fancy rolls were ok, but drowned in way too much sauce. 

One of the daily specials was ocean trout, which I've never tried before, but now LOVE - it's really similar to salmon, but better somehow... Spicy tuna on crispy rice was the only other thing I'd say was good. They didn't have a few of the sides pictured on yelp like the fish collar, and nothing that we tried was really above mediocre. 

Rib eye was half well done, half rare. Japanese hamburg steak (like salisbury steak) was ok, but weird to serve it without rice. Ika yaki grilled squid was rubbery but not bad. Poor grilled baby octopus skewer was just cooked to hell, but I liked the kochujang sauce. Teri chicken was a big bowl of chicken w/ lots of stir fried veggies, friend said it was ok. Soft shell crab tasted like old oil. Pork belly was soft, but not much flavor. Seared tuna with AJ sauce (whatever that is) was a mess, but tasted ok. Uni was sweet and better than some other ayce places. Spicy scallop wasn't spicy at all, and was barely even scallop - it was mostly mildly spicy imitation crab. 

We mostly came here because of positive yelp reviews, along with some miscommunication on which sushi place a friend had recommended (we found out later that she wasn't talking about Umiya). Unless I came to stalk the cute Korean waiter, I won't be back. I always forget to abide by the rule where if a sushi place has majority non-Asian customers, you should just leave. Every single crappy sushi place I've been to, I look around before we leave and it's a lot of non-Asians enjoying an awesome california roll.

5825108,2016-06-02,3,q-zZgXKAQFLEgMp9ZNllgQ,"Ok.... As a business owner I'm telling you up front to take my review with a grain of salt.  Here's why.  

#1  It's a Wednesday that I'm writing this review.  I know many sushi restaurants don't carry their freshest stuff on Wednesday's but that it comes in for the weekends.  I get it.

#2 After coming here did I find out it's an ""all you can eat"" kinda place.

With that as a preamble here's my review.

At roughly $26 per person for all you can eat ... I mean ... what do you expect really?  Top shelf uni?  Top shelf ... anything?  In any case when I see 4.5 stars on Yelp where I come from (New York) I expect buttery toro, perfect texture uni ... so creamy, baby yellowtail, king salmon, kunomoto oyster, live scallop ... if  you've ever eaten top shelf YOU KNOW EXACTLY WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.  Apparently 4.5 stars in Las Vegas is NOT THE SAME as 4.5 stars in New York.  THAT'S FOR SURE.

Did they have uni? Yes. It was so mushy though and two of the four pieces were various colors ... :-/  

The ikura (salmon roe) was rubbery. The true test of fresh salmon roe is that it POPS in your mouth.  That is 4.5-5 star quality.  Is it just me or do people in Las Vegas don't know great sushi?  Did I catch them on a bad night?  IDK... I've been here to Raku twice and both times during the week it was off the hook and met my expectations.

To it's credit ... the staff was very helpful and the service was FAST.  I love fast service. 

With regards to the food ... large quantities at cheap prices always seems good but if you've ever really experienced top shelf sushi/sashimi and you're looking for that here... uh uh.

You've seen what I said regarding the uni and ikura.  To it's credit the yellow tail was very good as were the two special rolls we ordered which were the salmon everything kinda roll and the yellow tail lover roll.  See ... when you go to any sushi restaurant you'll always find the best ""flavor"" in special rolls where they can cover up the freshness that you would otherwise find in their sashimi dishes and when you order the ""all you can eat"" you are prevented from ordering sashimi.  :-/  THAT'S BECAUSE they want you to fill up on the rice.  As a business owner I get it ... it makes sense. ;)  But if you are a true sushi connoisseur ... homey don't play dat. By the waiters suggestion I did order the oysters and to their credit they were really good but were they ""great""?  Sorry.  I like my oysters ice cold.  Call me a sushi snob but I like my raw fish fresh and cold.

So ... my recommendations for a person coming here.

If your sushi habits are to have all you can eat on a budget ... this is the place for you. $26 per person... you can't beat it.

If however you are a sushi snob like I am and you've been spoiled with the likes of top shelf raw fish ... don't bother coming here while in Vegas.  Face the facts ... you've going to have to bite the bullet and check out some of the higher end places.  

I'm willing to come back here on a weekend and see if I'm wrong but ... we'll see. Till then ... no more than 2 stars.",PNyl89h1YyWb55tfL-FYDw,2,0,2,XFdHzfI6KdwZsh2vwGaKNg

Our waiter Tony took control right away and sectioned us into 3 groups of 6. He started getting orders for each group and he did not miss one order. 

We ordered do much food, these are the highlights:
The Best:
*Tsubu Gai (giant clams) super tender and clean tasting.
*Yuzu Hamachi - Yuzu definitely elevated the freshness of the hamachi. 
*Salmon Belly - yum
*Uni - creamy goodness. 
*Fresh Oyster - I had 6 of these by myself YUM! 
*Bacon & Scallop Skewer - small, but wow was it good. 

The Good:
*Tuna Pokè
*Marinated Pork Belly
*Rib Eye Steak
*Baked Mussels
*Tempura Green Tea Ice Cream 

The Bad:
None

They have entree stuff listed with the AYCE menu such as steak and chicken, which is great. Also, they have ramen.

The appetizers included in the AYCE are more than the typical gyoza. I had a ""Who's Your Daddy"", a fried ball of shrimp and other stuff. Delicious. The spicy rice cake on a skewer? Must have for anyone that likes spice.

The huge negative here? The kitchen time is absolutely horrible. Throughout the whole time, the food coming out was pretty slow. But towards the end, I ordered one last order of tempura shrimp and a spicy rice cake skewer. Our friend ordered dessert, and my fiancé wanted to wait for me to get my order before placing our dessert order. For the scoops of ice cream that our friend ordered, it took at least 20-25 minutes.

All you can eat option for $26 a person, with terms. You have to eat the rice, or you will be charged. You have to eat everything you order, or you will be charged. There are items that can only be ordered one per person. Sashimi is not available. 

The all you can eat menu is large, lots of appetizer, nigiri and roll options. The menu goes beyond sushi, we did not look at that part. Nigiri pieces are small. Tuna poke is good. We enjoyed all of the rolls we ordered, trying a variety. 

Communal large tables and benches where you share the table with others. Makes it very accommodating for large parties of people. 

Service is fantastic. There are plenty of servers working, walking around refilling water and clearing plates. Not once was our section of the table cluttered. We had more than one server taking our order as well. The food comes out fast.",Vir8SoyPh0EBFSrCawJEjA,7,5,4,KMpouxSfG2NqLEhqlzxCjQ

I don't know if I have any favorite dishes since everything was so good! The albacore melts in my mouth, the oysters were refreshing, the unagi was decadent. 

The yuzu drink was wonderful too!

Lunch was $21 and dinner is $26. SUCH A STEAL! Will definitely be returning on an empty stomach.",QRhZChDuwfBbuhqIazv5jA,6,5,5,wE-mZ72_f8keWMMowe9ffA

The sushi from this place is flavorless and paper thin. The sushi rice should be seasoned with sugar and vinegar, but these have no seasoning and no shine. 

Come here for the quantity not quality.",9ZrKmTkTo1NPr24g3axaow,0,0,2,2WtJC-cppA6GzyKFCqvP-A
5923871,2015-12-02,0,q-zZgXKAQFLEgMp9ZNllgQ,This sushi place has been one of my favorites ever since I started eating it. They give you full or half rolls and the customer service is amazing. Rolls come out quick and are always fresh and they give you very large cuts of fish in your sushi. I've been to other places where the wait time is 45+ minutes but this place always treats you like family. Highly recommend!,KwwGzeWZsvbq12mKI9ldPw,0,0,5,lLxLGLp2m1oABbL4k7R0Kw

Not much places are opened after 12am but we came across this place on yelp and decided to give it a try. They offer an large all you can eat menu but we decide to do a la carte since we weren't that hungry and we didn't want to eat too much that late. Everything we had were pretty good. Would definitely come back during our next trip to Vegas when we want some sushi,5TrL2F8QzYF2IDOx_RRoDQ,0,0,4,vPmqTAXpmzbb6TUowfOmaw

Service is okay, can be improved but the food makes up for it. Their baked sushi is by far one of the best in town.

5976457,2014-02-15,0,q-zZgXKAQFLEgMp9ZNllgQ,"First time trying Umiya and it was a hit and miss in one seating. I would say the best thing would be their appetizers because they're all so yummy ! I really liked their baked mussels and their bacon wrapped scallops. Also their tuna poke is probably the best around since I'm really picky about what I like ! I tried their oysters and they're really fresh and taste so good !

Moving onto the main course, the AYCE sushi ! I love love love sushi, but it was just alright to me. I had really high expectations, but I was disappointed /: everything tasted so bland and simple, not much flavor to them. And although they had a wide selection, I didn't find anything interesting to try out. Probably the good ones were the spicy rolls, but I didn't try since I wasn't feeling something HOT. Ohwells.... Oh ! And they burnt my rice when making their baked rolls, so be aware !!!!

Overall, I love their appetizer selection. The AYCE was fresh, but not enough flavor to satisfy. And dessert was good, but their tempura part of the tempura ice cream was not good at all for me. 

Not sure if I'll come back /: sorry, I'll be taking my money elsewhere.",pGmQFnXcAAXHWjKrRAcyhQ,0,0,3,jkh8HjXl5JImMNyHfu4GYA

It wasn't super busy which is nice cause sometimes then it's hard to get service if it's to busy. Sucks that some of the menu items are you can only have one per person, and then can't order anymore like the oysters, and some of the other items on the menu. Next time I think I will come with another person, or only get the smaller items cause some of the main rolls you could not get a half order and I was like dang it, almost to much. Mostly cause I usually just want 2 pieces of something then I want to try something else. Unless it was really good then I want to get more. My fav thing I tried here was... the raw oysters, and the baby scallops. I didn't get to find any of the main rolls that I liked alot cause some of the rolls I ordered where the ones you can't order half order with.",N26-dXhOoB3gHhX6meMMNw,2,2,4,E56KjEGYV9G8bKidsIReRQ
