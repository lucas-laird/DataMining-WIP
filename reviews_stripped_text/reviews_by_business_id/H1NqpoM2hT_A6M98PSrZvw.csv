Placed an order through Uber eats, food was delivered and was missing a whole plate and another plate completely incorrect! Contacted this place and the rep had no kind of sympathy, I told her I'm on my way to pick up my plates. I get to this place and she tells me you have to bring the other plates back. I told her I'm not driving all the way back home so you can see what you did wrong!! I'm telling you as a paid customer what was wrong!!! She tells me we're making it. After waiting 20+minutes, she says she contacted the owner and he said to come back tomorrow with the incorrect plate and the receipt!!! WOW Unbelievable. The rep didn't say she contacted the owner until I asked what was taking so long, UNREAL! So she says you have to come back tomorrow to speak to Robert Gonzales to see about making the plates. This was once my favorite place but after dealing with incompetent individuals who apparently can't read or make things right with a customer, I will never come back here again! I will be there tomorrow bright and early to see the owner and return this incorrect plate tho!!! SMH",VTFg5eWTX5c8nz57XuFypw,0,0,1,TM-A7RTWGdkTYek89me3kQ

My boyfriend is always torn between two choices and tonight we realized there's a two protein option, so he got to try both the beef teriyaki and spicy chick. He raved about both. Also got the half and half. Noddle and rice. 

The register gal also asked if I wanted my veggies steamed or stir fried which I super appreciate since I am more health conscious than my boyfriend.

1340239,2017-12-17,0,H1NqpoM2hT_A6M98PSrZvw,"This is a great place to go if you want juicy, tender, and flavorful Chicken Teriyaki. Initially I ordered my meal as a take-out. The wait isn't that long and the meal is cooked hot and fresh with quality ingredients. When they delivered the takeout order to my table, I'm thinking I'd probably be better off just dining in because I am super hungry. 

I chose the Chicken Teriyaki Plate ($8.99) with Brown Rice and Stir-Fry Veggies. Also I got an order of Chicken Yakisoba ($7.99) and Unsweetened Iced Tea ($1.99). The quantity portions of meat and veggies are so worth the price. However I do wish they had given a little more brown rice to enjoy with the Chicken Teriyaki. Now with the Chicken Yakisoba, my only concern is that the noodles were lacking flavor. I had to request the thick Teriyaki sauce to mix into the noodles and make it taste better. As a result, the thick sauce did make the meal more enjoyable. 

What I am most happy is how family-oriented the service is. There is a kind and elderly gentleman who is always looking out for the customer. He makes sure the restaurant is tidy and clean, and he goes above and beyond in hospitality. It's like having your grandfather there taking good care of you. The commitment and dedication that he and the team provide to the customers really does shine with excellence at this location.",dpvR4LYXr0CYHtHf8BeCKg,1,0,4,tuussp9fjjnDG292ISt0EQ

Get the regular chicken bowl with veggies and brown rice, add on a drizzle of sriracha, and you've got a solid lunch or dinner with good macros (31P/73C/9F) and a huge portion that could satisfy the Hulk.

Tries to remember everyone's name. Always says thank you. However, the new girl working the counter with glasses is a Debbie downer. She been there the last 3 times I've gone. Always has a sour face, never says hello, goodbye, or thank you. She rarely makes eye contact. I tip 20% on a to go order and say thank you. I still get zero response. No thanks, no have a good day. Nothing!!! It's so rude!!! It makes me not want to come back. I gave 4 Stars because the restaurant is great. I just wish they would talk to this girl about her customer service skills or keep her off the register. If you don't like your job get a new one girl.

It's just the perfect combination of spicy and crunch I love. The place is also next to a Starbucks if you find yourself some iced tea. They offer different sides as well if you don't like noodles you can either get fried or white rice. And the steamed veggies so healthy for you!

I told him I handed him a twenty.  Then I looked at my receipt and it said I gave him 20 and he gave me 10 back.  We got into an argument and I confronted him on the receipt and he said he hit the wrong key on the register.  I asked to see the video and he refused to show it to me.  Then he said he will count the money from the register and if he has extra money he will give me 10 dollars and tell me to leave the restaurant.  Of course he lied after he counted the money and said he was short money.   He yells at me in front of customers.  He is a thief and is extremely unprofessional.  I will never step foot in that place again.  He is the loser.  He lost me as a customer and I have written a bad review.  All over $10.,_kyyMAf_oF55jTxBgWyOow,0,0,1,nsunJVtNzWbWjeEe74oIXA

Apparently, this store just opened 10/252016 so they were passing out menus and coupons to drum up business. We both ordered the Chicken Teriyaki plate which came with your choice of two sides, I chose white rice and vegetables. My companion had white rice and macaroni salad and a side of noodles.

The food was GREAT! I give it 5 stars! However, the pricing $22.68 was not worth what we got. Will I return? More than likely not. Just to pricey for me for what you get.

The staff were all very nice and the interior and exterior were nicely done. The place was very clean. Restrooms too!

They said I would have to deal with it with Uber and that it wasn't their problem. The girl pretended to go back and speak to a ""supervisor"" but came out and basically repeated that it wasn't their problem. I can understand that I may have to request any refunds through uber but the utter lack compassion and customer service in the face of a customer that paid two times the price for their food to be delivered and still had to drive to the restaurant to get their order, and the total dismissal that the issue may be on their end and not on the apps end.  After a while they finally offered to provide veggies but all in all a horrible customer service experience and attitude from the staff.",i2DrB0SGtsukFTf8y-BVTA,0,0,1,jHMCMyaxLzOhEuvs7SMhKA

Got a teriyaki chicken bowl with fried rice and veggies. Total was only $9 and change. So far so good. They make the food to order so it was very fresh, I like that. The employees also bring your food to you, even if it's to-go. All the employees are friendly and offer great suggestions. 

So now the food, for one the portions are pretty large. I could barely finish the bowl, I couldn't imagine eating a whole plate haha. The chicken was tender and juicy, not over cooked and the veggies were perfectly cooked...not too crunchy, not too mushy. I enjoyed the flavor of the fried rice. Everything complimented each other. 

This is place is fairly busy, especially at lunch time so I noticed a lot of people called ahead for their order or ordered online. Plenty of options if you want to get your food more quickly. 

I'll be back for my next teriyaki bowl fix and will try the noodles.",dL4_drDAJAPCsiw1y-xPNg,0,1,4,kk4oeFfs3qBc0ALyoww87Q
