870533,2008-10-13,0,JRoJwJkO-VtBFngswsIhgw,"Went here the other night with my girl.  It's a cozy little place with nice decorations.  The food's pretty good.  We tried the fried rice with some sort of fried fish in it (forgot what it's called) and fried oysters with pad thai sauce.  For dessert we got the durian with sweet rice and the roti with pandan filling.

The owner was really friendly to boot.  I'd definitely come back here to try more of their dishes.",G1Ip79wpnQyidRgzTvl9Pw,1,0,5,UBrur5wjcjROLmEcOGPf0A
1333298,2009-03-10,0,JRoJwJkO-VtBFngswsIhgw,"This is a great Thai place. They have added a bakery still desert case that was very pretty. They gave me several samples while I waited for my pang shrimp and Tom Kah Gai soup to go. The desserts were all so nice and my entrees were very very good. I eat panang and Tom Kah Gai every chance i get. Royal Thai's versions were top notch, with very subtle but complex taste. The staff is so nice too.",CSsZKyjgef2GS20JtP4W2w,0,0,4,F41AljfTVLYkwinIB5Wirw
1755890,2010-08-22,0,JRoJwJkO-VtBFngswsIhgw,"I found this restaurant while in the neighborhood looking for another Thai place. The hostess was very friendly and brought me a side of ""Nam Pra Prix"" -- a hot sauce that enlightened my chicken curry (forgot what kind!), which was exceptional. I have attached a picture for your total enjoyment. Will go back soon. :)",pvaELJvaxTGN-h-YRSsGUQ,3,0,5,TfFVgu9PenhNAVXYogXs8A
2621897,2010-06-20,0,JRoJwJkO-VtBFngswsIhgw,"The Thai iced tea was very sweet.  I don't mind this, but it may be too sweet for some.  I ordered the koi soy (noodles in a curry soup), one of my favorite Thai dishes.  I found it to be a little bland, but still good.  I ordered medium heat, but the curry in the koi soy was barely hot at all.  I also ordered the crab fried rice, and was a little more pleased with it.  The rice was light and fluffy, and not at all greasey.  Again, the flavor was a little more bland than I prefer.

Based on my initial visit, this is a rather average Thai restaurant.  I would return if I was with friends and in the area, but I wouldn't seek it out.",wOGfOjBaP-lCS1NW_En2LQ,0,0,3,7SWxIoBZNG7_7mQqwW09Sg

5919211,2011-11-11,0,JRoJwJkO-VtBFngswsIhgw,"Sorry to hear this place closed!  I went here many times, mainly for lunch, and in an area that is a little downtroden, in a mini-mall...and from the outside, it looked like nothing special.  When you walk in, you are in the most lovely place with friendly and warm service, cute and colorful thai decor, large portions, good/clean cooking style, and quality.

I wish the ownership and staff well...and kind thanks for many happy meals I received.",ZIOCmdFaMIF56FR-nWr_2A,1,1,4,JZ_k3NCUdlXVgYGHqV7sdg
