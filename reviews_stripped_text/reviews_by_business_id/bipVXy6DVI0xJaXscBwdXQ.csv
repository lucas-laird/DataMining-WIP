And they all didn't compare to The Big Easy Balls from Sauced! The best part was I only had to wait about 15 minutes!

1309591,2012-09-05,0,bipVXy6DVI0xJaXscBwdXQ,"It seems as though food trucks don't have as much of a following here as they do back in California, but Sauced can still hold it's ground fairly well. 

I loved that you get a discount if you buy more items. So 1 items is normally $3.50, 2 for $6.50, and 3 for $9.00. So naturally, being a student on a budget, this appeals very much! Originally we got 3 items, thinking it would be enough for 2 of us. We ordered the Big Easy Balls, Turkey Slider, and Jerk Pork Tacos. First impression, they weren't as big as we thought so we knew we'd need to get more but we dug into it nonetheless. Also, any sauce can be put on the side and they're included with the food.

Big Easy Balls: So excited for these, a little disappointed. The balls themselves had a nice crispy outside and it was soft and gooey on the inside. But it didn't have much flavor. I expected there to be a little kick from the Andouille sausage, but flavor was a little lacking. The sriracha sauce that you can get with it was much needed, and it was very good.

Turkey Slider: Probably my favorite. The bacon confit was delicious and went really well with the turkey patty. It was like a dressed up, much smaller, turkey burger.

Jerk Pork Tacos: We weren't big fans of this. The pork didn't have much flavor and nothing really stood out. Also, there was a pretty big hunk of fat in the taco.

Next we had the Asian Chicken Nachos and Drunken Balls.

Asian Chicken Nachos: It's supposed to have a Thai coconut sauce but I didn't taste any of that. I liked that it was served in a fried wonton shaped like a bowl, I thought it was clever presentation. 

Drunken Balls: I'm glad they had small bits of cilantro in it or else it really would have been just a fried ball of potato. Nice crispy skin, and when you got a bite of cilantro it was quite tasty. Again, the cheese sauce was needed. 

Overall the food was alright, but I'm not in a hurry to come back. The things you should try though are the Big Easy Balls and Turkey Slider, those were the better ones of the selection.",-LEJFq5RC0rQAG831uYRKg,1,1,3,3WUUqrxPoDFNL1BHZTVXsA

This event is for a school in a low-income area to raise money for students in need.  Mike told us that he had an event that cancelled, then was back on.

2054209,2015-10-18,2,bipVXy6DVI0xJaXscBwdXQ,"Ok so once upon a time long long time ago I had a chance to try Sauced food truck at on of the first Silverton's foodie Fest but only had some; I believe it was either mac and cheese balls or some kind of croquette bites I can't remember it was so long ago. All I can remember was it was a little pricey and it was good. 

But this last Saturday I attended my wife's company picnic and they were there serving up food and I was so glad! I don't know how much what was what because it was catered but I will be willing and happy to pay good money for their burgers. 

We got the Blue Burger and the Hawaiian Burger which both came with amazing seasoned fries. 

Blue Burger 5/5 for sure or beyond the buns were delicious, I don't know where they get it from or if they make it but it's not something that I just toss like normal. It was light, airy and toasted so perfectly. The burger patty was a great size and had the right amount of crispiness, chard-ness and juiciness. OMG was it juicy. Packed with great flavor and topped with perfect amount of Blue cheese not over kill and grilled Caramelized onions yummmmm. 

The Hawaiian Burger 5/5 Ah Aloha
My wife is not too crazy about teriyaki anything other then chicken and she LoVed this burger. Same thing with the patty grilled to perfection smothered in some sort of teriyaki sauce and topped with a grilled pineapple so freaking good, not soggy and not over whelming with the whole sweet and sawha deal and of coarse the fries were crispy and seasoned so finger licking good! 

They have tons of sauce option for your food and I sure hope so being that their truck is named ""Sauced"" lol and the service was amazing nice and friendly people and I even had a short convo with one of the their guys finding out about his life as a new dad and dad to be, (I can relate I have a 2 year old and a new 6 months old)can't remember his name but very cool guy, ""Congrats again btw."" Any how food came out fast and fresh and we truly enjoyed it.

I had heard great things and am happy to say they went above and beyond our expectations.  Mike was so professional and available for questions every time I called. The food was just amazing. All of our guests are still talking about it and the party was in December. The big easy and Buffalo chicken balls were awesome and the burgers were over the top good. The hits of the night were the pesto grilled cheese and porky's revenge. All of their sauces were delicious and everything was fresh, hot and made to order. I highly recommend Sauced for any party or event. The price is much cheaper than traditional catering and such a cool option. The only downside was we were so busy partying we didn't get to try everything so we are on the lookout for the truck to try the rest of the menu.",i6EggEhN-tSUiWPYgkTVZg,1,0,5,q1v3hCrr1aP7jic7QswsNA

I went to a party where the food truck was catering so my food was free and I'm sure some of the menu items were a bit different. I got a vegetarian sandwich that blew me away. It was a fried pattie filled with different types of beans, corn, and other veggies and spices. And the bottom of the bun had some pico de gallo that really was great. It came with a side of seasoned skinny fries and and tried the sriracha sauce blend with them. There were other things on the menu like fusion tacos, sandwiches and small plates. My friend got the Seoul Taco and LOVED it. Hope I get to try this truck again soon.",eCwl6zWjwj3ypgPbjom6gw,1,0,4,e4l9WMZtXn0HuBc-Vi7gKA
2389075,2013-12-21,0,bipVXy6DVI0xJaXscBwdXQ,"When we found out that a food truck was catering our Holiday Party at work. None of us were thrilled. They gave us a menu to look at a couple weeks in advance and I decided to just go with a regular cheeseburger. 
The Holiday Party was today and by the time Sauced had served the first batch of coworkers they were giving rave reviews. My coworker asked what kind of sandwich I was getting I said ""a cheeseburger"". You could have sworn I just slapped her in her face. "" You could get a cheeseburger any day!"", she yelled. Hearing her going around and boast and rave about the ""Hawkeye"" sandwich made me rethink my decision of just getting a cheeseburger and I'm glad I did! I decided on the Saucy Mama which was chopped chicken, ham, and Swiss cheese fried together in a batter which made it look like a patty. It was beyond good and was served with seasoned fries and a soda! I was so full I had to save a portion of my sandwich for later.
This was a definite upgrade from past Holiday Parties and now I'm checking the Sauced Truck schedule to find out where they will be next!",QE-HsCOqPGKZY7jP-6RsJQ,1,0,4,_NbKcDwhTCkZGFXlheO40g
2406832,2013-10-09,0,bipVXy6DVI0xJaXscBwdXQ,"We just had 'Sauced' come and cater my daughter's 1st birthday party.  I have to say that they were absolutely amazing.  We were looking for ways to feed the crowd that was different, filling, and affordable.  Mike and his team fulfilled all of those requirements and then some.  Mike was great at giving suggestions and accommodating all of our requests, he responded to promptly to my emails and phone calls and made the whole process incredibly easy.  

They arrived early and set up at the end of the driveway and our guests made their way out and ordered from the menu we had set up ahead of time.  

Everybody LOVED the food...the Big, easy balls/great balls of fire/and sliders were the most popular, but the tacos were great too (Seoul food and veggie), plus the fries to be able to sample all the sauces was great.  It was nice that the portions were big enough to get full-but small enough that you could try a variety of things and find what you liked the most.  Everybody had MORE than enough to eat and I didn't have to cook or clean a thing.  

This is a class act of an operation and you can't go wrong whether you're just trying their food or having them cater an event for you!",7KrkHrEj6af-fe6ftgvUcw,1,0,5,5H0H-bS2UODpRsGdi-ogpw

4107246,2013-11-17,0,bipVXy6DVI0xJaXscBwdXQ,"Interesting. Second place I've encountered in a week with a fancy purple and white ribbon from the Bite of Las Vegas. It was for creativity, and one of the Sauced ladies explained that it was for their Big Easy balls.

Unlike during my last ribbon rendezvous, I actually didn't end up eating that item, but I helped one of my friends take care of his leftovers, which included the ""Buffalo chicken in a ball"" Great Balls o' Fire, and the surprisingly hugely portioned fried mac 'n cheese. The leftover ball o' fire was kinda too salty and sour for my taste, but the fried mac was really good, especially with whatever sauce it came with (friend said it contained bacon, which is always good).

Another friend shared his loaded fries, which came with some bacon, plus this heavy cheese sauce that cooled and congealed kinda quickly in the cool weather. It was decent though. They were my favorite non-dessert truck of the day, and I think I'd visit them again and try some of the other menu items if I see them around town or at another food truck gathering.

When I arrived at the truck there were a couple folks ahead of me but I was served quickly and with a huge smile. The ladies were once again super sweet and engaged me while I was waiting for my food. 

Not only did I get to try two of their signature tacos but she recommended the right sauces to try with my tacos and they were delicious.

They do big plates or small plates and you can make that into a combo of sorts, 2 for $7  or 3 for $10. I decided to get 2 small plates so I can try a variety. I got Big Easy balls which were huge creole style rice balls. The rice was pretty good and the batter was pretty crispy. Chicken tsunami taco had good flavor with the thai peanut slaw, though maybe a little salty for me. My brother got a seoul taco and the big easy balls and thought his was good as well. 

I like that they have a variety of homemade sauces, I threw on the sriracha ranch on the big easy balls and wasabi cream on my taco which complimented both things well. I was curious about their chili mustard, though it didnt go with anything I ordered, since I love mustards. It remined me of McD's hot mustard, but a better version of that.

It seems on their schedule they are regulars that park at Premium Outlets near the weekends so if you're here and don't want the food court, keep an eye out for trucks.",n86B7IkbU20AkxlFX_5aew,3,1,4,qUs2a_NrMO9XLRhub8-CFQ

The Big Easy. Two crispy fried balls containing cajun chicken, Andouille, risotto & garlic herb cream cheese. Awesome. Creamy, little spicy, meaty, all balled up in a deep fried goodness.
Unfortunately, it only got 3 stars because the fritter wasn't that great. Although texture wise, it was nice and crispy outside and soft and fluffy inside. I could see pieces of corn and diced jalapenos, but couldn't discern much taste from them. The fried batter tasted just basically of flour. There were 3 fritters and I couldn't even tell if there was cheese in the first two. The third, I could see some cheese in it, but that, like all three, was overwhelmed by the taste of flour.",zL2wX9mGV1p1nUSOk5mKxg,2,1,3,I5VqECWzcLNhDxb8MrjwJA
