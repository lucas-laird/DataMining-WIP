Salad was bland and boring, Octopus appetizer was ok, but unimpressive. $120 bone-in rib eye for 2 had me initially excited but ended up tasting like it was cooked in a greasy pan (though I'm sure it wasn't). The waiters recommended drizzling the steak in olive oil. This recommendation ended up just making the steak... slimy. Further, once the carving process was finished, the steak was served warm, at best. The potatoes that came with the steak were... potatoes... with a sprig of rosemary... completely unexciting.

Apart from the unimpressive and expensive food, the restaurant was about 80 degrees (not exaggerating) and was adjacent to a loud, booming club. Sweating, uncomfortable, and having to hear booming bass throughout the meal destroyed any chance of having an enjoyable setting.",Yq0IIHcE4b99uJ_GAuZw9A,0,0,2,mdRBflhhmkOiDkhbrlJPAQ

I went to celebrate a birthday with my wife and we planned to have dinner at BandB and Atelier Robuchon the next night. I love food and collect wine, so I brought a special old DRC bottle, but the BandB waitress informed me  they don't allow BYO at the restaurant.     The sommelier/manager soon arrived to tell me that he did not want to argue with me, but Clark County laws did not allow them to open the bottle.     I knew that was a lie since I had brought wine to Picasso, Mix and other places in Vegas... I told him I would gladly open it myself, but he refused, always claiming The Clark County Laws. We left and walked less than 50yards and had a wonderful meal at Valentino's, where they gladly charged us $35 corkage , which was fine with me.",riRQYhgKJaX5opjp8C1W9g,0,0,1,9Mz9VvXnvSEhTwyNQ8EGrQ

The food,service and atmosphere was spectacular and among the best experiences that we have had. The hostess gave us a very nice quiet table. The server was very familiar with the menu  and provided several good suggestions. The octopus appetizer was the best octopus I have ever had. Next  I had  the goat cheese ravioli ,while my wife had the beef cheek ravioli . It s amazing how well the pasta is cooked at every Batali /Bastianich  restaurant.  For my entree I had the lamb for two ( which could have fed 4 easily). The lamb was succulent ,and grilled root vegetables terrific. For dessert I had the date Napoleon. I love the traditional Napoleon but  this was the best I have ever had.

42787,2009-08-09,0,GTR39A2jwNIS_NV8q2r_JA,We were looking forward to the dinner based on the reviews and  ratings.  However I had some concerns as there were some recent negative reviews.  This was probably the most disappointing dinner we have ever had.  We started with the octopus and calamari. The octopus was far too salty and inedible.  The calamari was chewy and bland.  The main courses we had were the lamb and linguine with clams.  The rack of lamb was composed of about half fat.  My wife had the linguine and the noodles were hard and chewy.  When she asked about the chewiness of the noodles they took the plate back and said they would prepare a new one.  They brought the same plate back just hotter (probably in the microwave).  Will definitely never go again and will not reccommend.,htPkukOadqkKR7t-5zJ1BQ,0,0,1,6Y9HSgCrALEM5m7FgAeCWA

I love truffles and eat them whenever I can, and paid the $45. for a small amount of noodles with truffle.   A surprisingly large amount of truffle was shaved onto the noodles-I was so excited.  Then I noticed there was no truffle aroma, which is very unusual.  When I ate them there was no taste at all-none, as if they were plastic shavings.  The noodles were lukewarm.  I was so disappointed. This should not be served at any Italian restaurant.

 On the good side, the servers were excellent explaining the menu options for our group, answering questions and taking care of us.

The Bucatini ""all'Amatriciana"" is by far the best pasta I've eaten to date. The pasta has a hole going through each pasta as if it were a long straw that tastes like you're eating a cloud. It has a slight kick like Bruce Lee or Chuck Norris is swimming in the dish yo!

The Beef Cheek Ravioli with Black Truffles and Crushed Duck Liver tastes like wet cement. You can't get the pasty texture and cement flavor out of your mouth even with mouthwash. If you want your mouth to feel like it's in prison, go for it.

53919,2010-04-06,0,GTR39A2jwNIS_NV8q2r_JA,"My wife and I had dinner here a few weeks ago.  We're big fans of Babbo in NYC, and B&B is basically Babbo transplated to Vegas.  Great food, great service, and an all around good experience.

The service here is excellent.  They pace the courses so that you have plenty of time to enjoy your food and wine.  For some, that may be a bit too slow, as you're waiting between courses.  But that is the pace that my wife and I really enjoy, so we can have some drinks and talk.  Overall, it's about two hours for the whole meal.  The waitress was very knowledgeable and very helpful, and the overall service is attentive but unobtrusive.  

The wine list is 100% italian wines, which my wife and I know very little about.  So we took advantage of the sommelier who picked a really good wine for us.  The nice thing about this sommellier is that he asked us for our preferences and familiarity, then proceeded to recommend a range of wines.  Some leaning towards my preferences, some towards my wifes, and some he identified as good compromise wines.  He also picked a wide range of price points, which was also nice.  The one we ended up picking from his recommendations was excellent.

The setting is nice, but it's along a fairly busy area of the casino.  So even though the lights are dim and they play nice music in the restaurant, you occasionally get a lot of noise coming from the outside.  This might be nice if you want to people-watch, I guess.  It's not nearly as quaint as the townhouse Babbo is in, but it is a nice setting overall.

The food is great.  They do a full three course meal here (four if you get desert, five if you count the complimentary appetizer).  The menu also has sides that you can order, so if you wanted to just get one dish and some sides you can do that too.

Between my wife and I, we had:
-Complimentary appetizer.  This is too big to be an amuse bouche.  It's basically a crostini with garbanzo beans and some kind of dressing/paste on it.  Very good, but the beans were really cold, as if they'd just been taken out of the a fridge or off ice.  It still tasted good but the coldness was a bit off-putting.
-Grilled octopus in limoncello vinaigrette.  Amazing dish, the octopus was very tender and the dressing was excellent.  You basically get the whole octopus too; I was surprised at how much was on that plate.  This was probably the best dish we had all night, although the rest of the food was great too.
-Rabbit Confit crostone.  This was a grilled piece of bread with a salad and rabbit confit on top.  I thought they skimped a bit on the rabbit but it was still excellent.
-Beef cheek ravioli with truffle sauce.  I was surprised by this dish; it was extremely beefy and unusually creamy.  It had really big bits of shaved truffle on it.  I enjoyed it quite a bit, but I think the texture might throw other people off.  
-Squash lune with amaretti cookie.  We've had a very similar dish at Babbo, and this was just as good.  It's basically a squash ravioli with an almond cookie shaved on top.  It sounds odd, but it's very good.
-Orange duck.  This was very good, but they serve it with the skin on so it's quite fatty.  I don't know what they do, but the duck is really infused with orange.  Very good, but I had to stop eating because the fatty duck was a bit too much for me.
-Grilled halibut.  They manage to make the skin on it super-crispy.  Like potato-chip crispy.  It was served with some type of cherry tomatoes that were very potent in flavor.  Again, a great dish.

One tip is that their limoncello is house-made and excellent, but not always on the menu.  So be sure to ask for it if you enjoy limoncello.",uOmGw_dh7nwRI43drtsGWQ,0,0,5,za0doo1bm590rUuE7q22_w

next we shared the pumpkin lune. this was good. and perfect amount between the two of us. i could have used more sage though. traditional dish done well. then i got the beef tagliata and a got the trout. my meat was cooked right, but it was only ok tasting. a's trout was nice, but his riso nero was undercooked, like really undercooked. also was too salty. 

for dessert, we shared the meyer lemon pudding. that was the best part of the meal. there were crunchies on top and it was the perfect amount of sweet and sour.

76480,2010-02-22,0,GTR39A2jwNIS_NV8q2r_JA,"The one thing that I can't tolerate about restaurants that charge more than $40 per entree is BAD SERVICE.

We waited an hour before our server, let's call her ""B"", came back so that we could order drinks.  She never came back to ask us how our entrees were.  And we never received any of the complimentary sweets that everyone on Yelp has raved about.  All of this would have been fine except that we left her a ""mandatory"" $80+ tip. I think that the bad service on our server's part can be partially attributed to automatic tip and partially because we came towards the end of the night.  

Realizing that servers and busboys make most of their livelihood from tips, we decided pay the 20% tip and not punish the busboys, who were very prompt and polite, never letting our water glasses go below half empty.  I did go talk to the manager to let him know that the service at his restaurant was less than perfect.   When I did, he shrugged and said, ""Thanks for telling us.""  He didn't offer us any kind of compensation OR even note which table we were sitting at and who our server was.  With management like that, it is no wonder that the so many people have criticized the service as lackluster.

The food was pretty good--the pappardelle bolognese was delicious, but the pasta was a little too al dente, and the veal chop was juicy, flavorful, and all-around amazing.  The gnocchi tasted like an overly firm polenta.

Then they brought my fish to the table to show me it was cooked whole and stated they would be back with it after they de-boned it. They carried my fish around the restaurant as they stopped at other tables. Next they took my fish over to the hostess at the little wine bar and she began picking the bones out of my fish with one knife and her fingers. Other servers came by and leaned their noses over my fish to take a smell. They finally brought my half mutilated fish to me which was now cold and once again extremely over salted.

We were very much looking forward to it, until I started reading the Yelp reviews.  We had pretty much decided against it, until we just said, screw it, let's go.  So happy we did.  We both got the Pasta Tasting Menu of Mario's Classics with the wine pairing.  It was incredible.  Our waiter took the time to explain the wine and dishes with absolute care.  The meal was paced exceedingly well, and when there was a bit of a lull, our waiter was sure to see if we needed anything and often refilled our wine glasses.  This was the best meal of each of our lives.  Every course was fantastic - Jose's Pyramids and the gnocchi with oxtail sauce our favorites.  And that is not to say that the Riccotta with Asparagus was lacking or the delicate balanced taste of the Lamb's brains ravioli.  I ate brains, and I loved it.  The desert of the Fried Date was simply fantastic, and the other equally as good.  

The setting was very nice, and although I was expecting Led Zeppelin to be blasting, it was not (which kinda disappointed my husband).  The staff was very attentive, and I can't believe that the service has been complained about.  

All in all, very happy I did not listen to the previous reviews - maybe yelp has become more of a place to complain than praise.

for appetizers we had the B&B affettati misti.  if you like this sort of thing, you might love it.  it's cured in house.  but if you live in seattle, just skip this and go to salumi's.  my friend had the warm lamb's tongue.  i took a few bites - it was one of the better things i had that night, aside from dessert.  one of those things you can't just get anywhere.

i had the spaghettini with the one pound lobster.  when asked for ""regular"" or ""non-spicy"" i opted for ""regular - if that means spicy!"" of course.  it's not spicy at all, and i'm not just saying that cause i'm asian and i can handle serious spice.  i don't know what ""spicy"" meant.  it had a good amount of lobster, but everything just tasted pretty bland.  i did like the sweet garlic, but if you do decide to go here, try something else.  unless you like bland pasta.

my friend had the special - a stinging nettle pasta with wild boar ragu.  it's very good but if you see this one the menu - it's surprisingly awfully rich.  we wish he would have warned us about that.

the waiter recommended their most popular dessert when we ordered our entrees as it would take 30 minutes to prepare: a date & nut strudel covered in cardamom honey.

I think he needs to have a chat with his cooks. It was so salty as to make it just a shame. Service was excellent. Kevin, our server, handled our input well.

I had Octopus it was just ok, followed by Short Rib, which was dry, bland and the polenta was tasteless. It was a small portion and I only ate half of it.
My wife had pappadelle bolognese, which was very undercooked and bland. Could probably get much better for $12 elsewhere.

We were sat at a broken banquette, then when moved, sat for 15 minutes without menus, water, bread or a waiter to greet us. When the waiter finally greeted us, with menus, it was another 10 minutes to get bread - and we had to ask for olive oil (which was fantastic). It was another 10 minutes before we were given empty champagne glasses and another 5 before they were filled. 
Okay, so the squash blossoms were delicious and the corn sformato with porcini - divine. Then we got our pasta course. The hot plate given to me, was dirty and had to be sent back. The spaghettini with one pound of lobster in a spicy tomato based sauce was fabulous, the gnocchi with oxtail was flavorful and tender, and the mint ravioli envelopes with spicy lamb sausage - spectacular. Once again, however, the service was horrible. We took the suggestion of the waiter for a red wine to match our pasta course. Unfortunately, this was served 10 min after our pasta - which was stone cold by then. Difficult to enjoy the wine suggested to compliment the meal, when served in this manner. 
All of a sudden, the timing of service picked up and two waiters asked if they could serve our fish course - whisking away our partially eaten pasta. 
The Orata was beautiful in it's parchment paper package. Opening it, we could see a lovely piece of fish on green beans, tomato and clams. But, the smell was very industrial - almost as if sprayed with rancid oil. I asked if the fish was fresh or salt water, but no one asked us how it was. We would have told them.
Dessert was fine - grappa scented panna cotta with Mission figs stuffed with honeycomb, but the service was so horrible and distracting, it made this special occasion difficult to enjoy.",7xouYXfCI3VuCXiOxb8Byw,0,0,2,UjpRwXb0UIHfJyjtmfbMGQ

B&B gave me the best possible customer service one can ask for all the way to the end. I contacted the restaurant about doing a custom pasta tasting because there were certain pastas I wanted to try and my wish was there command and even offered to do a custom wine pairing for it as well, which I didn't take advantage of. While I didn't really like the ambiance of the restaurant, just felt like I was eating in a mall for some reason...idk weird feeling, but I did love the food. The amuse was Bruscetta w/chickpeas & olives which was alright but nothing that impressed me. The first pasta dish was the Sweet Potato ""Lune"" with Sage and Amaretti. As said before I'm a huge sweet potato fan so of course I loved this dish. It has a strong sweet potato taste filling inside a small flat ravioli and a sweet amaretti cream sauce that almost made the dish to sweet but I still loved it!

Pasta dish two was the Lamb's Brain ""Francobolli"" with Lemon and Sage! Call me Hannibal but this dish is what I was looking forward to the most during my trip. It was surprisingly very good. Tasted slightly like ground beef with a much smoother texture. It was filled in small raviolis covered in a lemon sauce that added a nice lightness to the dish that was simply delish and had me almost licking my plate! I am now a Lamb's Brain lover and which is why I like Mario Batali because he isn't afraid to try something crazy like this.

Pasta dish three was the there pasta of the evening which to be honest I don't remember because I didn't like it so I will skip that one and go straight to the last pasta dish which was the Pici with Lamb Ragu. Tasted and looks just like spaghetti but with a little kick which I liked and had little bits of lamb that tasted much like sausage. Great dish!

For my deserts I went with the sorbet of the evening which was coconut and a special pumpkin torte that they had. The sorbet was very refreshing after having all those rich dishes and had a light sweetness to it that made it feel like I was eating a nice refreshing piece of fruit over some sugar enriched sorbet. The pumpkin torte on the other had was WAY to rich and had to stop after two bites. Tasted just like pumpkin pie but found it to be much more richer.

Overall I loved this place. Even though I didn't like the ambiance, the food made up for it. I love Italian food and I think Mario Batali's strong points are in his pasta's. While I've seen many bad reviews of this place, most of the people who had something negative to say was geared towards his entrees or Secondi's he calls them. When I go to a Italian restaurant I go for one thing and one thing only, PASTA! I experienced no over saltiness at all but did experience pasta that was flavored just beautifully. Service was top class through the whole meal. I can't wait to return and to try his restaurant in NY!",zjdNmQTjA6IXQaJZUYYwHg,0,0,4,01mpkp6eEA9mkY5Ekl8ugg

The tagliatelle with charred sweet corn and truffles was excellent. The sauce was made with a special butter(I forget what kind)  that was more flavorful than normal butter, but not as cloying. The bucatini was also very good and spicier than other allamatriciana dishes I've tried.

306748,2011-11-19,2,GTR39A2jwNIS_NV8q2r_JA,"First off, how this place does not have a 5 star rating on yelp is mind-blowing. My wife and I stumbled in here one Sunday eve (on the eve our one year anniversary), and we now feel we discovered gold. After all, it is the wild west....

Let's start with the service. A ""10."". Nothing else to say. Kevin (with the cool mustache) was - besides being amazingly friendly - one of the most knowledgable staff members of anyplace we have been. And to be honest, we eat very well, all the time - whether it's home in Hollywood or in NYC, SF, Boston, Miami - whatever.  We consider ourselves well-versed and qualified to rate any place on the planet. However, personally, I enjoy most those places that are over the top special, but still straightforward - and not too, too formal. After all, we want to be comfortable. That is what B&B is.  While the room is nothing special, certainly for vegas, the Seasonal menu is not short of perfect. 

The must haves:  any type of burrata salad (they change monthly, depending on their purveyor, yes, there is one person who Batalli employs for his empire who sources goods); bone marrow ravioli is like nothing you have had, the osso buco on top is just even more amazing; it was fig season, so a fig salad and a type of fig burrata brûlée was off the charts. Also, remember, no one does burrata like Batalli. Or for that matter, meat and cheese. The lobster spaghettini just amazing.  And of course, a top 5 dish ever for me, the grilled octopus.  Everything has its own special type of vinegrette prepared for the dish. To give an example of the talent and ingredients here, one was made with the ""last press"" of olives for the season, when they ""clean"" the presses with the citrus from the same farms in italy, so the olive oil has this amazing fresh bite from the process. That's how involved and thoughtful this menu and kitchen is.  

And that's about half of what we ordered, all with the help of Kevin, who made us feel like you are truly taking a trip through Tuscany with his knowledge and his own love for the menu and food.  You just cannot stop ordering. Yes, it's that good. My wife made me stop. 

To all who say the portions are too small:  it's not the cheesecake factory.  You obviously don't eat out much.  And yes, it's not priced like it either. But what do you expect, it's in Las Vegas. But I will say, these prices would hold up in LA (as they do at Mozza in LA) because great experiences that involve expensive ingredients are not cheap. 

If you are in LV anytime, you would be remiss in not going to B&B. Even  if you are solo, their bar area looks like a great place to experience this menu. The only drawback is that Kevin is not the bartender, and I think he is a giant part of that experience.  My wife even convinced me to get started on a mustache the next day, which didn't get past a week. (not for me)

My wife and I are thinking of flying in for the night just to eat here again (and maybe an hour or two of craps wouldn't hurt....)

UPDATE:

Just went again this past week while in town for a couple of nights. This time, with a friend from the east coast. Once again, it didn't disappoint and of course, Kevin was on his game. I am telling you, if you go there, you have to request to be in his area. It's a completely different experience there when you have someone so passionate about the ingredients and dishes there. But there are other very friendly folks working there, the bartender that night was another. 

Yes, the bill was insane for a random tues night with an old buddy in town, but we loved it and it's worth the premium. They played the entire Queen Greatest Hits album the whole night, which is one of my favs...as I know some here on yelp think that it should be more Sinatra than classic glam rock, but they don't get it.

We decided to try B & B for a couple of reasons: 1.) we wanted tasty Italian food, 2.) the owner/chef Mario Batali is well known, and 3.) it's in the Venetian and we had tickets for Phantom. 

My first impressions: dark, wood, classic, brown, fine-dining, lots and lots of staff running around. Like another reviewer stated, they almost hovered around you at times. The menu is set up in a traditional Italian style--appetizer, first course, second course. The main courses are eclectic to say the least--rabbit, quail, something called white-shrimp. My gf played it safe and ordered the pork chop, but I decided to be a bit adventurous and get the quail. But before that, let's talk appetizers and first courses.

The server recommended the buffalo mozzarella appetizer and we were going to pass (you can't come here and not expect to spend at least $100), but it sounded amazing and--it was! It came out drenched in olive oil, topped with red onions and seasoned with a generous amount of salt (apparently Batali is not afraid to use the white stuff). The mozzarella was so soft and fresh--it literally melted in your  mouth. Now, for the first course--we were starving when we got here and really wanted some pasta-action, but when we saw our neighbor's small portions, we thought: we better get entrees too.  Anyway, Christina ordered ""lune"" ravioli filled with sweet potatoes. Mmmmmm...very sweet and savory. I tried the homemade orecchiete with a sausage ragu. The pasta was authentic and the sausage ragu was spicy and satisfying. 

So far, you're probably wondering why I only gave this restaurant 3 stars. Well, it's all about the entrees. The pork chop was cooked well, juicy and the vidalia onions gave it a tangy flavor, but it was just a pork chop. I tried the quail and it was so salty, I barely tasted anything else. Like most fine dining places, everything is ala carte, so they came with nothing! All in all, $178  later (we did get a half a carafe) of wine, and I only felt  mildly satisfied. If we return, we'll create our own pasta-tasting menu with four pasta dishes along with a couple of appetizers and we'll skip the main courses.",oN73H8MWTaUVCQsAQYHFDA,0,0,3,2Pglo37DaiG5hK4KvGnejA

The waiter we had ""Anthony"" was the most Knowledgeable waiter I have ever had anywhere hands down. He knew everything about the food and all the Green practices of the restaurant. He was a little stiff at the beginning but after engaging him in conversation he brightened up.
Had the Burrata and Heirloom tomato appetizer w fresh pesto, Delicious. Also combined that with the meat selection for one, pretty good, not spectacular but decent, maybe ordering it for 2,3,4 is better. But one thing about it the pickled vegetable on it were horrible. Ok onto main courses....
Had the Papparadelle Bolognese, I thought it was great. Fresh wide ribbons dressed with a delicious meat sauce and freshly grated Reggiano Parmegiano . It wasn't piled on meat sauce like in american italian restaurants, the pasta was dressed in meat sauce like you would get in Italy. with a glass of red wine perfect. Next had a pork loin special with fingerling potatoes and arugula salad with a pan reduction sauce. It was too much food but very good, the sauce excellent and the potatoes crispy salty and delicious. Cappuccino excellent, Biscotti terrible. 
But its interesting that people don't like B&B because I went to Mario's causal place in the Venetian and it was the worst pizza I ever had.",91-JxdOIAyQyZ7tO48-qQg,0,0,3,azbmyGICMLTuMciyEd0aCQ

When we got our food all five main dishes were so over salted that they were impossible to eat.  Our complaints to the idiot server did nothing  In the end we had to scrap the salt off of the various dishes in order to eat them  At the end of this awful meal someone (possibly the manager) offered us 5 truffles  because she was told about our complaint.

There were five of us and we were seated right away for our reservation.  We were greeted by a server and asked for our drink order.  Two of the guests ordered a cocktail and the server came back with the wrong order.  He took the two drinks back and came back with the wrong drinks again. One of the guests offered to drink it anyway so it wouldn't go to waste but the server told them that if he left it there, he would have to charge for the drink.  For getting the order wrong twice, he should have given the drinks for free!  The other three (including me) ordered a bottle of wine and the server brought only one glass for the wine.  I know it was loud in there but I clearly told him that ""the three of us are going to have wine with our veal chop and rib eye."" He even recommended the wine to drink with our meals. Not sure where his mind was. He was very nice but just couldn't get the order right.  
The garbanzo bruschetta that was brought to us in the beginning was a nice touch.  We ordered the octopus as an appetizer and it was very delicious. It was the most tender octopus I have ever had. They also brought us a slice of cold bread for each. It was a little hard and did not offer to bring more.
The meals took a long time to come out. Th server explained to us that the rib eye for two took longer because it was so big. He quoted us 15 more minutes but it seemed longer than that. Maybe the chef was too busy in the kitchen.  Once the food came out, I struggled with my veal chop.  It was not tender and it was difficult to wrangle. I asked for a steak knife but they did not have one. The veal was very tasty but it had too much fat for me and it was not tender enough.  The rib eye that my friends has was better. It melted in your mouth! The other two guests were also happy with their meals.  We shared two desserts: the trio of gelatos and the flourless chocolate cake.  They were both really good but the gelato lacked presentation. The three scoops were piled on top of each other in a small metal dish.   
I would have given it a 4 but I was not ok with the mistakes that the server made. I saw a man in a suit walking around the restaurant (I assumed the manager) and never came to our table to see how everything was. There was table with some celebrities next to ours and a lot of focus was given to them.  But everyone should be treated equally in a high end establishment such as that.

the best part dessert: citrus with ricotta cream. at least something good to send us on our way. thumb up

644053,2014-03-05,0,GTR39A2jwNIS_NV8q2r_JA,"Came here on Sunday night.  Started with drinks at V Bar (happy hour until 7 - well drinks $6) almost next door to B&B and I was glad I did because reviewing the mark up of approximately 300% of wine at B&B I decided against wine with dinner. This was by no means an easy decision as Italian food begs for wine to accompany it but nonetheless I just didn't want to pay $20 a glass. Although had I been in a different mood I probably would have.  

As to the ambiance - it was more casual than other Batali restaurants I have been to. We were sat next to an open window overlooking the thoroughfare outside the restaurants where tourists walked to and fro. I would have preferred something a little more intimate and well in my experience these type of spots out in the open are generally reserved for people without reservations.  The restaurant was about 1/3-1/2 full. The acoustics made it so it was louder than I would have liked. They were playing AC/DC while we ate. While I appreciate rock music I would have preferred a more Sinatra experience. We were dressed up however there were a number of people wearing jeans. 

We ordered two appetizers - the straciatella, which I always adore. I was recently told by Due Forni that they were the only place in town that imported and served this but maybe they meant the only non-strip restaurant? Either way the straciatella was $16 and came with two pieces of bread, we asked for more. The cheese is creamy and has a mild almost nutty flavor to me. We also ordered the calamari, it was grilled and was delicious although it was approx. $20 and only had three larger tentacle pieces.  We then ordered the bone marrow ravioli, they brought it out on two plates for sharing. While it was good, I don't think I would order it again - the bone marrow must have melted upon cooking it because there really wasn't any within the raviolis although there was a taste of bone marrow. Again around the $20 range. For the secondi I ordered the veal saltimbocca with arugula salad.  The arugula had a light vinaigrette on it and as plentiful and the veal also came with two larger pieces, although the veal was a little tough. We think it would have been better if we just ordered a few appetizers to share. 

The service was not impeccable. We were sat at a two top. They let the menus and wine list pile up and brought out plates before they took the order and brought out the amuse bouche of bruschetta (which was two small toasts with a chickpea compote on top). Instead of taking our orders and taking the menus they sat the menus next to me on the booth side of the table. Also, we had to ask for drink refills.  They didn't place the napkin on my lap (yes I realize that is knit picky but that is what reviews are for right). I also overhead the waitress, our waitress, tell another table that a slow roasted meat was tougher because it was cooked longer - really?! Obviously untrue and I couldn't believe she said that and that they patrons believed it but I restrained myself and didn't interject. I asked for bread with olive oil/vinegar - the waiter forgot the olive oil and I had to ask a second time.  Also, waited forever to bring the check and then forever once we gave her money for the change. I watched the waitress walk around the restaurant and take two more table's orders prior to retrieving our change.  We were even more ancy as service was slow and the chairs were not the most comfortable and we were anxious to leave. 

Also, I found the Mario Batali cookbooks lining the bar area to be obnoxious - like a cheap advertising ploy. So I think next time I will pick another Batali venue. We still love Carnavino and I would go back there over B&B.",xECpt0seSDbTmt1mGcfffA,1,0,3,oCawGv9Gt0GTF8d96P4EfQ

Ok, the service was attentive and helpful, but the food (except for the Limoncello Octopus appetizer) was awful. We were six people, and not a single entrée was satisfactory. Mario, Please remove your B from he name as soon as possible! I had the Linguine w.Clams, and it was like biting into a block of salt. The Linguini were actually Spaghetti. Obviously they fried some Pancetta, added some Garlic and  clams, then fried the al dente pasta in that pan which dried out and hardened the noodles and clams. Then drenched the whole thing in olive oil! No broth at all! I had better pasta in some cafeterias...

I didn't quite like their ""breadsticks.""  They were really sticks like the pretzel sticks which was not appropriate for an upscale restaurant.  It feels ""cheap"" to wrap up tiny bread sticks in paper.

Farallon, in San Francisco, serves tiny portion as well but the food they serve taste MORE DELICIOUS and REFINED than B&B Ristorante.

We arrived to B&B about 10 minutes early of 5pm since we had a 7pm show to make. We sat at the bar and enjoyed a craft made ""Smoked Potato and Rosemary"" Martini that was like an amuse on its own. A perfect starter prepared by a very knowledgeable bartender. 

We were seated at 5pm, with our waiter already informed of our time line. He started with a great introduction and briskly informed us of the best choices that we could manage. Any questions were answered with detail and a reassurance that you were making the correct decision. He also noticed that my wife was pregnant and offered a custom ""Mocktail"" for her. 

ANTIPASTI: 
Warm Lamb's Tongue with Chanterelles and a 3-Minute Egg $17 - a great balance of pickling, tender, and savory bites that come to life the second you break that egg yolk. 

PRIMI: 
Beef Cheek Ravioli with Black Truffles and Crushed Duck Liver $26 - a classic Batali dish that emphasizes texture and the control of flavor. The mixture of duck liver was and beef cheek was fantastic, with the liver just adding that necessary mineral, woodsy accent. 

Goat Cheese Tortelloni with Dried Orange and Wild Fennel Pollen $25 - Just an awesome dish. The goat cheese filling was so creamy and smooth. Again, no single ingredient over shadowed the other, the all play together perfectly, exciting your palate with every bite. 

SECONDI: 
Crispy Polenta Sweetbreads with Favas, Oyster Mushrooms and Spring Garlic ""Fonduta"" $36 - A great dish executed with a delicate touch. The sweetbreads where simply creamy inside their crispy thin crust. The favas, mushrooms, and ""fonduta"" simply created a lovely sauce coating eat morsel. Paired with a recommended glass of red wine that I wish I could remember, perfect. 

We had to skip desert, but the choice was difficult.

I tried to make reservations on OpenTable for a party of 7, but the max you can do is 6.  So, I called the hostess and requested a table for 7 people at 9pm on Sat.  When we arrived, we were escorted into a private back room (where they store the wine).  The ambiance of the room was fantastic!

At the table, we had the following dishes that I found particularly memorable and delicious:
Gilled Octopus - Best octopus I've ever had
Bucatini 'all'Amatriciana' - This was so good that I got it again at Enoteca San Marco (Batali's other restaurant in the Venetian) 2 days later.  The pasta noodles are nicely al dente.
Jose's Pyramids - We got this as an appetizer.  Delicious!
Steak ""Tagliata"" - The gem butter lettuce accompaniment was really good.  The steak comes sliced (so it's best to order it a bit rarer than you normally would) and is encrusted with delicious peppery-salty goodness.
Harry's Berries Strawberries

Suffice to say, I am not a huge fan of the town, but am certainly excited by the number of restaurants renowned chefs have put their name behind.  I was particularly intrigued by this as not only does this bring Molto Mario to the table, but also brings Lydia Bastianich's son's influence.  Lydia, for those that don't know, is the quintessential Italian Nonna, and was a celebrity chef (PBS channel) before Food TV made a brand out of their chefs!

The menu did not disappoint -- the bold, rustic, real Italian offerings you would expect from Mario.  Everyone at our table was quite happy with a range of options -- roasted beet salad, prosciutto to start.  We opted to share a couple pastas so we could all taste pasta while ordering the temptations for the secondi section.  WOW!  We has the mint love letters pasta -- a bright fresh green pea and mint pesto filled ravioli envelope with a rich, spicy lamb sausage sauce. Such great combinations of flavors, and the perfect balance of sweet and spicy. We also had the beef cheek ravioli with black truffle and crushed duck liver.   Yum.  Warm, rich, earthy flavors.  (in fact, this is a good dish to share as the richness may be too much for a solo dish.) I thoroughly enjoyed the short rib dish - brasato al barolo.  Tender meat braised with a barolo reduction; rich and heavenly! Others at the table enjoyed the calamari, the sweetbreads (yes, really!), the rabbit, and the branzino (a white fish).

All in all, glad to have tried a higher end Batali joint, and will continue to do so!  He really has such great insight to real italian food. The ambiance, however, was lacking a bit for me.  It is partially open to the brightly lit 'mall' so it does not reflect the rustic charm that it really could be, particularly given the price.

Service brought this from four to a three.  Waitress did not like the notion that rather than her suggestion of ordering three pastas to share, we only ordered two.  Oh, and when she was starting to go over the specials and detail out some of the dishes we were interested in, she departed suddenly with some sort of grunt to assist another table, coming back to us a bit later. Oh, and very unhappy we did not order desserts/coffee.  (We were stuffed! This is big food! - maybe not huge portions, but hearty, heavy, happy belly food!) Seemed very put out with some of our questions on the menu, and yet seemed to be very serious when she indicated we could top above the built in 20% they added since we were a party of six.

This was hands down one of the best dining experiences my girlfriend and I have ever had. We enjoyed the balsamic lamb ribs, possibly the best appetizer of my life. Than split the Gorgonzola tortoloni, which was a nice refreshment course of lighter flavors after the intense flavors of the ribs. We than had the best bolognaise I have probably ever had, and followed that with an incredibly tender melt in your mouth short rib served with polenta. Our desert was phenomenal as well as very light. The apple fritters tasted delicious.

The food, incredible, the service was also phenomenal. Our waiter was extremely knowledgable, no doubt an expert in the business that is probably a career here in Vegas.

They tell you that the norm for 2 people is 2 appetizers, 1 pasta, and 2 main dishes.  We weren't starved, so we decided to split one of each.  Good move here.  We started with the Steamed Clams in a spicy broth, with extra bread to dip into the delicious broth.  Next we split the Beef Cheek Ravioli with crushed duck liver.  Rich and delcicious.  And then on the main meat.  We split the lamb chops.  As is the case at nice restaurants, we were expecting a small portion of lamb chops.  Imagine my surprise when 8 lamb chops came out!  They were delicious.  

I was on the lookout for the issue with the salt that other reviewers have mentioned.  The only thing that could have used less salt was the eggplant underneath the lamb chops, but it did not affect the actual meat at all.  Perhaps they have worked towards solving the problem of oversalting.

The service was great, ambience great, the wine was good and surprisingly reasonable for the 1/4 liters, and the gelato AND vanilla semi-freddo for dessert were delicious.  The gelato was a treat from the pastry chef for my birthday.

I chose B&B for a friends' reunion. I dined there 3 years ago and was happy with my meal then...  Not so last night. 
Let me start by saying the service was excellent.  Our server and almost all the supporting service team are the only ones who deserve a star in this review.
I really expected much more from Batali and Bastianich.. and their executive chef. To see Joe Bastianich on Master Chef (e.g. spitting out substandard food and chastising the guilty chef), you would think he would expect a higher standard from the chefs at the restaurant with HIS name on it... especially with the priciness of the menu items (I won't even comment on the wine since I expect a 2x-3x mark up in Las Vegas.)
Here's where things went wrong:
1) The Heritage pork bruschetta (open-faced pork pastrami sandwich) came on soggy bread; it was meant to serve a few of us but came as one long bruschetta and when asked for a serrated knife, the sommelier huffed, and proceeded to mutilate our bruschetta with a spoon and a butter knife
2) A friend just wanted chicken.. it was on the menu.  They ran out of chicken.  How does a restaurant run out of chicken?  That's always the last to go.  I'm guessing they ran out because the guests who ordered the pork chops (describe below) ended up returning their meals as I did and ordered the chicken instead
3) One of the recommended dishes was the grilled pork chops.  I should have known not to order when the server said it was brined for a long period.. I was trusting Batali's and Bastianich's reputations.  The server came with my chop and said that the chef recommendation is to finish the pork chop with a balsamic vinaigrette.  I wanted to taste the flavor of the meat so I couldn't understand why so I asked for some on only half of the chop and then perhaps a side dish.  After my first bite, I understood why.  The pork chop was inedible... I  love salt, but it was well OVER-seasoned. The vinaigrette and peach served with the pork were meant to cut the saltiness from over-brining. Even if that had worked, I would still have consumed more salt than I would in a week.. the cut of the pork was excellent, the flavor would have been nice too, but for the over-seasoning
4)  Pass on the desserts.  We sampled four (chocolate torte, blueberry crepe, not tiramisu ""tiramisu"" and fig crostada (puff pastry with salty mascarpone filling)... by the way, both the desserts with mascarpone had salty mascarpone..)
The night was made enjoyable because of the company of old friends... but we could have taken our business elsewhere and had both great company and (most likely) much better food.",yn0itXcRX3iWDvOQSzFEcQ,5,2,1,AGRjOZ_vcw7ZPERBxoOH-w

If Mario had eaten this meal, he'd want to kill himself.

The short ribs are worse than an over-cooked crock pot dinner--mushy and dry. Thank goodness the portion was very small because more would have been an insult. The tablespoon of polenta under the meat was tasteless.

The octopus appetizer is equally bad. While the octopus was cooked correctly, the sauce was too strong. I'm not sure if it was too much balsamic or too much salt, but it was a disaster. 

I enjoyed the wine, and the coffee was outstanding. 

The service is good, but they should offer more than one small piece of bread per person without having to ask for more. I eat gluten-free, and I told the server to give my husband my piece of bread, and he ignored. me.

I won't be back.

Was there with a party of 4 and tried 2 Atipasti, 3 Primi, 2 Secondi and one desert.  Here we go:
Chic pea brushcetta--got this complements of the restaurant.  Did not care for it, tasted weird to me.
Bread--It was not good at all, don't even try it.
Antipasti
Tomato fresh mozzarella (can't remember the fancy name) was good, a bit salty.  Tomatoes were sweet and fresh, good combination of flavors.
Crispy Pork Trotter --awesome, great combination.  Loved it!
Primi
Spaghettini with lobster --I did not like this dish, it was ok, would not order again.  For me it was weird and did not work very well.
Goat Cheese Tortelloni--this was a hit, pasta was good and it was a great combination with the rich taste of the goat cheese. Portion was small, but I think is because the assumption is that you would get a secondi, so that makes sense.  
Bucatini all Amatriciana--amazing!  It was so good, I wanted more.  It is perfectly spicy and the bacon was just outstanding. 
Secondi
Lamb for two--it was great.  Cooked to perfection, tender and juicy.  Our came with roasted peppers.  I wish they would warn you that some of the pepers are hot, like really hot.  I took a big bite of the green one and omg, fire in my mouth.  Although the waiters were on top of our table all night long, they could not keep up with how much water I was drinking to put off the fire in my month....
Veal Chop--I did not try this dish, but the people who eat it said it was great.  I would add it looked just like the picture on their web site, really good.
Dolci
Dark Chocolate torta--it was not good and so small.  The waiter recommended a cherry wine to go with it instead of the rum as suggested in the menu.  The wine was a winner, great! 
We also had red wine, not sure which one it was as I did not select it, but it was outstanding.
Overall it was a good experience.  Like some of the other reviews, it is difficult for me to assign an overall review because some of the dishes were amazing and some I did not care for.  Overall, I would give it 3.5 stars.  I am rounding down because of how expensive everything was.  Dinner for 4 about $700 with tip and we actually shared a lot of the food...

I was with my boss and another colleague on business and decided on your restorante over many other establishments in the Venetian primarily because I have always respected your cooking on TV but never had the chance to experience it.  After hearing the waiter provide the review of our options, I persuaded the others at the table to go with the Pasta Tasting dishes so we could get a feel of more than one thing.  Not only was everything too salty, but it took at least 45mins to get the 1st dish which was basically a portion so tiny, it took me 2 mouthfuls to eat.  It smelled like bleach, and the plating was very beige and white with nothing high class like I would expect for the price.  45 mins later out next course came out, smaller than the first, looking the same and tasting the same...salty.  After another 20 mins or so for our next course, I was so embarrassed about it all that I felt bad my boss would be paying for it.  He actually said something to the waiter that we had an early morning and could he speed it up.  Another 30mins passed, with 2 more dishes of equally tiny portions, mine being one amount, and the others at the table have either was more, or way less, with the last black spaghetti being the only plate with any real flavor that was worth it.  Only problem was there was barely any there to eat.  How can you justify the price for an amount that is equal to maybe half a dinner plate if it all came out together?  I just don't get it.  The only saving grace was the dessert, but even that looked like the same bland beige looking meal, that was about 3 mouthfuls to finish.  

It took 3 hours for us to complete our meal, and if it wasn't for the 5 pieces of bread I ate, I would have probably gone to McDonalds to at least get something substantial in my stomach before I went to bed.

Our appetizers were decent (grilled octopus and baby artichoke salad), but our entrees were extremely disappointing.  My husband's brasato was dry and stringy; it had almost no sauce at all.  My Texas red fish and roasted cauliflower  were so salty that they were inedible (and trust me, I love salt).  I sent back the fish dish, and the waitress returned to confirm that the chef had tasted it and agreed that it was ""way overseasoned.""  No apology -- just informed me that another one would be made and brought out.  That did, in fact, happen, and it was much better, but my husband had finished eating before my entree arrived, so I just ate a few bites.  

The decor is quite nice, but there are few things that are ""off.""  The restaurant is dark, intimate, and cozy, but one side of the room is open to a hallway in the Venetian.  I could understand if it were a cool view, but it's not.  So, one person gets a nice view of the restaurant, and the other person gets a view of the harshly lit hallway.  The other incongruity is the music.  It is apparently music from Mario's iPod, including Beastie Boys, etc.  -- not exactly romantic Italian restaurant music.  I'm sure it's supposed to be cool that it's Mario's favorite music, but I found it distracting and out of place.  I actually like a lot of the music, but it would be more appropriate in a different venue.

Service was adequate.  The sommelier was good.  Our waitress was OK.  She forgot to tell us about the day's specials, and we didn't think to ask.  We later heard her reciting the specials to the people at the next table over.  And, again, I really felt that she should have handled the inedible entree issue more graciously.

Octopus: It's great if you like your food burnt with a charcoal like flavor. Most of it was black from the grill and could not be safely consumed. 

Spaghetti with lobster: Menu says the lobster is one pound, but it's more like 1/4 pound.  The lobster is not bad. The sauce is just okay. However, the pasta itself is from a box and not fresh like it should be for $36.

Short rib: Meat itself was good. It was fairly salty and the garnishment was a weird celery / salad deal. I would not order it again, but it's not bad.

Summary: the only reason this place survives is simply the celebrity chef buzz and there is a constant flow of tourist. I doubt most people return for a second time. Again, it's not awful, but in Vegas there are far better options.",2vuDXERC2M9L0OHT7cniuw,0,0,2,dD6G8YuOwAfWx1FNBbvFjQ

1007173,2007-06-24,0,GTR39A2jwNIS_NV8q2r_JA,"Yet another one of Batali's projects. His picture is all over the Venetian in order to promote it. It is where all the other restaurants are, but tucked away in a corner, with a little flag to hail you.

The recent Batali restaurant I ate at was Mozza, which didn't quite suit my taste and so I had some biased expectations. But a look at the menu cast all those skepticisms aside, as it was filled with things that aren't what you see in a conventional place, such as tripe, tongue, and brain. That fascinated me and I remembered reading Tony Bourdain's words that chefs are now able to explore a bit more by putting such things on their menus, and people are starting to accept them more. 

You are greeted by Batali's books at the door, but they are not shoved in your face as Bobby Flay's face is when you enter Mesa Grill. And in fact, once you step into the dining room you can easily forget about them. A very cozy place with a wall full of wine bottles. Simple dark near-black wood theme with clean white tables, and a center table for the workers, which also is a clever interior design job. The center table is where all the waiters put the finishing touches of your dishes, all the little garnishes and de-boning of the fish are done in the center of the dining room. Its center piece is a giant but slim vase with tall sunflowers (real!) that just touch the ceiling, which shortens the ceiling to the eyes and hence gives the place a more intimate and cozier feeling (even though it is standard ceiling height). And there are many servers that come in and out of the kitchen and mingle at the center table, giving the whole dining room a very live and bright feeling, without unnecessary flashy colors that I've seen way too may restaurants have.

The hostess offered me and my date a small table, then asked us if we preferred to sit side by side, and proceeded to turn the table sideways for us just so we could sit closer. Is this fine dining service? I've *never* had this offered to me before, and she even rotated the silverware for us. 

A little gift from the chef to start the meal, chick pea bruschetta on tiny little toasts. Very simple, yet curiously good. I swear I tasted olives but I have no idea where they were. The appetizer we ordered was three goat cheese truffles, little balls of goat cheese rolled around in spices. We first had the pimenton, or smoked paprika, which gave my mouth a nice little tingle with a bit of tang, a sign of very good paprika. Then the fennel seed powder was more bitter, and to my delight it brought out a whole new part of goat cheese's flavor. Next was poppy seeds, which again was a different experience, and that was when we also explored the roasted bell peppers, which was very fresh and very well prepared, and together with the goat cheese it was a different world.

We decided to try two different raviolis that interested me, one with lamb brains and the other with beef cheek meat. The lamb brain was incredibly smooth, the sauce for the ""postage-stamp-sized"" ravioli was nothing but butter with a bit of lemon and sage, very rich but you don't notice it until you leave. The beef-cheek ravioli was the opposite personality, big and meaty with very intense beef flavor. The crushed duck liver and truffles made it very savory. 

Bombolonis were shared for dessert, essentially donut holes that were served with melted dark chocolate. They give you plenty of chocolate too, that went down in spoonfuls. The waiter came to check on how we were doing and all the food was gone.

All the staff was young but mature and warm. It was a pleasure to talk to them, the entire atmosphere is laid back. I especially appreciate its location as it is away around a corner, unlike Mesa Grill where you are staring right at the slot machines as you eat. Quite easily you can forget that you are in a casino in the chaos that is Vegas, it has a mood of its own that suits me very well. Casual, with no pretension, all it is about is enjoying food.

Mozza might not have suited me so much but seeing this place and seeing the difference and the direction of Batali's passion for various aspects of food makes me respect him highly as a celebrity chef, and look forward to what his next adventure will be.",mvH7LLr26Wj3STZeBdi7Jg,4,1,5,f8q3BN_0PhLhxjFcc2S78w

As a big fan of Mario Batali and Joe Bastianich, having dined at Babbo, Osteria Mozza and Pizzaria Mozza many times, my expectations were high. What a huge disappointment. 

We were 4 and we each started off with the Field Greens, a very nice, nothing fancy salad. We then ordered two pastas to share; the Stracchino Ravioli with Leak Ragu and Breadcrumbs and the Homemade Orecchiette with Spicy Lamb Sausage and Rapini. The ravioli was over cooked and under-seasoned and the orecchiette was so salty it was hard to eat. Then the entrees came. My husband and I ordered the ribeye for two. The waiter brought it to the table to show my husband then took it away to slice. My brother-in-law ordered the veal chop and my sister the Short Rib ""al Barolo."" After slicing the steak (it seem to take forever) they brought all the entrees and NONE of them were hot, not even warm, like they had been sitting. They kindly offered to heat them so 2 of us accepted, but the second time around they weren't much hotter. You can only reheat meat so much without ruining it. Still some of the steak pieces were so raw, fat not rendered, we didn't eat them. The flavors in the entrees were all good, just not hot! For a steak priced at $120 I would expect the cook to be perfect. 

The service was not much better. Our waiter was a fine enough waiter, but was a little on the pushy side telling us how we should order. When my brother-in-law wanted to order a bottle of wine to drink some while we were having Proseco, the waiter told him to wait until he put our order in. The server (waiter assistant?) was officious and pretentious. When the manager came over to ask about our meal she really didn't want to hear that it was cold and offered a half-hearted apology.

We sat down and were asked if we were on a time crunch or had any shows to attend. We didn't, but later thought maybe we should have lied. Service could have been perceived as slow but I sort of liked the pace. I didn't feel rushed to shove food down my throat. 

Most of us had two courses instead of the four on the menu. I started with the artichoke salad. My first bite was super tart (thanks lemon!), but the parmigiano was a fantastic contrast. I ate the whole salad, and honestly would have been fine with just that. 

My main course was the rabbit porchetta. My friends selected other items: blue crab ravioli, Jose's Pyramids and the short rib. 

The rabbit porchetta seemed like the largest portion. The rabbit was a tad salty but perhaps that was for the best. I really enjoyed the dish. It was served on a bed of peas and lima beans. This may have been the only time in my life that I enjoyed lima beans.

The blue crab ravioli (from the bite I took) was very rich and the 8 or so raviolis seemed almost like too much. For anyone saying there were too few, well, we must have very different preferences. 

My two other friends (with the short ribs and Jose's Pyramids) were really happy with their selections as well.

I honestly felt the service was really good. They ensured we had full waters, refilled wine glasses and bread between courses. We received complementary chick peas bruschetta at the beginning and some collection of tiny desserts at the end. It looks like other reviewers weren't impressed with the chickpeas bruschetta.

Unless you want leftovers, which is hard to do when you're in Vegas and most likely do not want to lug the food back to your room and then you have no way to heat it up (unless you're staying at an extended stay type room).",0NNBYWXPDr_CR3ZoU15NiQ,1,0,3,jHT8UsT8rJN2CCB9-ssj7w

My recommendation is to get a cocktail, spend some time with the menu, a drink and an appetizer and ask the wait staff questions about any dish that seems interesting. Small portions for you huge eaters out there but excellent flavors. 

If I could have one complaint I would say that the dishes were a little heavy on the saltiness. I am a salt fan but one other person at our table commented on this and I had a similar thought during the meal.

My better half and I landed in Vegas at 10pm on the Sunday after Thanksgiving and headed straight to our late night reservation. Given the timing of our dinner and the holiday weekend, rounding up seems fair.

I am a big fan of Batali's LA outpost Mozza, so I was excited to try this vegas incarnation. The menus are quite similar, but the atmosphere at B&B is a little lacking. I was surprised that the space was as small as it is and that most tables were right on the ""main drag"" of the admittedly beautiful Venetian hotel. That being said, it kinda creates an effect of eating at an upscale mall in the OC. And the space just isn't as nice as Mozza.

The food is awesome! Even without the cheese bar. Some of the dishes seemed quite similar, though, to dishes at Mozza. They had an amazing regional and seasonal tasting menu (Piemonte), but given the late hour we opted on a few courses from the main menu. We shared our first two courses and ordered individual secondi, but the server misunderstood and split one between us. It was quail which we both love, so it worked out. I would have been harder on them if I were not completely stuffed. It was, afterall, the end of Thanksgiving weekend.

Overall, again I am positively alotting four stars for my first experience at B&B. I had the notion that we would walk in and leave Vegas behind, but it felt very Vegas from an ambience (guys in ball caps) standpoint. The server was nice and earnest but did misunderstand us and seemed like she was trained to talk to tourists, ""...with pancetta, or Italian bacon."" A lot of unnecessary translations, but it was kinda cute. The bread offerings were good and we received comlimentary sweets at the end.

On July 3rd, everyone in the group seemed to have individual plans and my husband had been wanting to try out B&B Ristorante since he is a fan of Mario Batali. I'm not a big fan of Italian food so I checked out the menu before going and decided I would be having steak instead of pasta for my dinner. Upon arrival, the service was attentive and timely. We were seated and the waiter was very helpful in explaining the various dishes as we were not well-versed in Italian food. When I told the waiter I would like steak for dinner he pointed out the grilled ribeye for two ($120). He then let us know they ran out of their regular ribeye so we were in for a special surprise. Since they had run out of their normal ribeye, they were serving a 6 MONTH dry-aged special reserve ribeye from Carnevino for the same price. Normally, this steak would cost over $200! We were completely caught off guard and couldn't be more delighted. So for the appetizer we decided to order the grilled octopus and it was really good. It didn't have the rubbery chewy texture but was actually juicy and tender like eating a seafood steak. For the next course we ordered the beef cheek ravioli upon recommendation from our waiter. It was ok, nothing spectacular, kind of like eating beef pate inside of a ravioli. I wish I had ordered the bone marrow ravioli instead, next time! So then our waiter comes out with our main entree, the glorious huge 27 oz (with bone) ribeye on a wooden plank. He presents to us the meat before slicing it into strips for us. He arranges the strips of steak on the plate with potatoes and some other stuff I ignored and then drizzled some beautiful balsamic and olive oil on top. I've never had steak like this but it was the best steak I have ever tasted hands down. It was like eating the most tender juicy filet but had the bold fatty flavor of a ribeye. The balsamic and olive oil combined with the steak was the most amazing combination of salty and tangy with a subtle sweetness. I was really sad I couldn't finish it so I had to take the leftovers back to the hotel. Later that night after partying at Marquee, I went back to the hotel and ate the leftover cold steak. Even cold, I'd rather have that steak than any other steak cooked, HA! I know we got lucky this time with that steak and sadly I'm not sure if it's something that is readily available or even on the menu at B&B Ristorante or Carnevino. It's bittersweet to eat such an amazing steak because from then every single other steak has to be compared to it and will ultimately pale in comparison. Next time we head back to Las Vegas I will hunt down that steak and pay whatever they ask because I know it will be worth it.",lsqRuKmPuF3h16NOuv9WfQ,1,1,5,paWP2eMw3RWHhfX5SR1llQ

Decor - we were seated in a small wine room, to the right of the entrance, so I can't speak for the entire place.

You feel like you are in a private enclave, away from the crowds. Loved the place! Found a great wine under $50 (not easy).
Service was good, knowledgeable and straight, no frills, no BS.  
Food, bread was good, but would have been better if accompanied by something (olive oil, tepenade...something). The must commented upon Beef Cheek Ravioli is good (in my estimation, though my wife hated it), but it should be a little more clearly described as a liver sauce, liver tasting dish. The liver is overpowering and it's all you taste. Good, if liver is what you like and want, but disappointing if beef cheeks is what you are going for. My advise is to ask plenty of questions so you know what you get.
The prices are, as you would expect, close to the value of the food weight in silver, and the portions are small. I had sweetbreads. If you like that stuff, you are going to like the dish.
I find $120 for pasta tasting to be a bit much, and I guess if you don't spring for two dishes you are likely to leave hungry.

Because I'm always a little too nervous to approach him, I wait for him to approach me. Bold. Clear amber hue. A city boy with southern charm. I'm intrigued. Dapper. He makes me feel like a classy lady. Compliments me. Has manners. And when the attraction is too much to resist, my inhibitions go away and put him to my lips. He tastes as smooth as he looks. It's passionate, slow, and affectionate. I take my time for I know our affair must be short-lived. His tastes lingers long after our last touch. I will miss him dearly. I hope we meet again soon.

After looking fruitlessly for a place to eat at Mandalay Bay we cabed it to the Venetian.

We finally ended up here at B&B. Looked good from the outside and one of our party had heard of it, so here we ate.

Our combos:
Grilled octopus/Sweetbreads
Prosciutto/Beef cheek ravioli
Sardines/Brasato (Short-ribs)
Vegetables Fritto/Brasato

Our appetizers came out quickly but the entrees took a very long time. And then on top of that, those of who had the brasato (my wife and I) couldn't eat them for they were too salty. In fact too salty for even my wife who puts salt on almost everything first. They offered to replace the meals but by then the others were nearly finished with their entrees so why bother. Again, a more attentive waiter would have been good. The lower servers (bread, water were spot-on).

Later, upon further discussion, other dishes were a bit salty too.

Service was ample, but a little rushed for the price range.  Waiters were knowledgeable, but only when questioned.  There was also some mis-communication between the fleet of servers, bussers, etc.  

We had the tasting menu ($99+tax, wine, etc).  It was good, but lacked the extra bit to make it awesome.  Some of the dishes outshined the others, such as fried dough and house proscuitto and baby octopus.  But the lackluster dishes thrown in sort of threw off the balance.  Dessert was also a bummer, and I asked to finish with the intermezzo again- cause that was awesome (blood orange sorbet).  The problem with dessert was that the flavors were very bland and featured figs, which were also in the first course.  The spiced cake was also a bit dry and lacking- nothing like a sticky toffee.

Overall it just wasn't worth the price.  There was some inconsistency throughout dishes, which I'm sure would have been better if the fat man was there himself.  I think I'll try another place next time.

1470293,2009-12-29,0,GTR39A2jwNIS_NV8q2r_JA,"I am actually kind of shocked to see the rating of B&B Ristorante, but I do agree with some of the reviews in that I think what your expectations are before you go has a lot to do with what type of experience you are going to get. I have been here a few times before and I think it might come down what type of experience you are looking for.

I had reservations this past weekend and I think along with the review for this day, it might help others to also compare it to my previous visit a few months earlier as both experiences were significantly different (but for me, equally enjoyable).

On my visit in Sept (my second time here), I ended up getting the pasta tasting menu. As noted by other the tasting menu is about 7 dishes. The tasting menu entailed the following at the time (attached a pic of the card they place there when you get the tasting menu):
1) Garganelli Pomodoro with Paula's Basil - Yummy
2) Black Spaghetti with Ricci di Mare - Super/Uber yummy! If you like spicy, you will love this!!! It is a completely different type of spicy!
3) Ricotta Cavatelli with Canestrino Tomato, Flageolet and Ham Hock - Very good
4) Jose's Pyramids with Purple Cherkoee ""Sugo Finto"" - Very good as well.
5) Goose Liver Ravioli with Basamic Vinegar and Brown Sugar - Kinda of bitter from the Vinegar and sweet from the brown sugar. Might be an acquired taste for some but for me very good!
6) Frutta Fresca - Not bad for a palate cleanser!
7) Roasted Canestrin Tomato with Sweet Corn Gelato - the desert was awesome!

If you do try the tasting menu, definitely be prepared to spend at least 3-4 hours on this meal. If you cannot dedicate that much time to the meal, skip the pasta tasting menu and get individual dishes.

I think the the reason why some like B&B is they are expecting the food to compete with excellent cut of beef, pork, or etc with some intricate sauce made by the masters from the mountains of Odo and forged from the blood, sweat and tears of the people of the land and then passed down from generation to generation on the backs by the grandmas of the world. FORGET IT! I hate to break it to you... but its pasta. You need to think about comparing apples to apples and oranges to oranges. The pasta tasting menu has to be some of the best tasting and prepared pasta I have ever had. all hand made that day and all very fresh! This place puts your standard concrete, flashy sign, chain restaurant in the suburbs to shame. If you are looking for flavor up the wazoo that you can compare to a steak house or other fine dining establishment, then read on and forget everything you just read.

On my most recent visit, we ended up going the appetizer, two ""main"" dishes (they call a ""primi"" and ""secondi"") and desert. A lot of the waiters recommend going this route if you aren't interested in the pasta tasting (others call it  prix fixe) menu. You get a wide variety of things (not just pasta) and you can choose food than interests you. For this recent visit, I ended up ordering:
1) Calamari and Seppie Fritti - sorry Bobby Flay... in my opinion, Batali's Calamari tops yours easily. although others in my party might disagree with me.
2) Gnocchi with Braised Oxtail - this is simply amazing. I have never tasted anything that good before!! Its got your ""pasta"" and your meat. Hook me up with this again!
3) Duck with Baby Green Cabbage and Speck - Yummy!
4) Desert (forget the name of it) - I ended up asking them to bring what they would recommend for desert.

To sum this all up, I think if you are looking to be WOW'ed and want compare it to other restaurants for the same type of money you are spending, you want to individual select items for your dining experience and get an appetizer, two ""main"" entries, and a desert. Going this route you can get a little more meat/seafood with your meal. Trust me you will enjoy it more. However, if you are looking for tasting simple (with few ingredients) yet unbelievably good and equally complex food, get the pasta tasting menu. Hopefully this will steer some people in the direction food that is better suited for yourself.",cTf5rrUd253mkJtUW0DYKQ,3,2,5,5cWMyTexCJWJQoZsaeZ_wg

The service was excellent and the decor is satisfactory. The servers were prompt and courteous. Each time water was refilled, they would cover the lip of the glass with napkin to keep the water from splashing onto you. I thought the tables were a little close to each other, but whatever.

On to the food:

Octopus - I couldn't taste the octopus. All I tasted was salty carbon because the meat was so burnt and they used so much salt. I mentioned this to the waiter and he said that's the way it is supposed to be. I was thinking that it is too bad it is supposed to suck. He graciously offered to take it back and bring something else. He recommended:

Cheese custard with shitake mushrooms - This one was a winner, had they not sprinkled coarse salt at the bottom of the dish. The dish didn't need any salt! Nonetheless, the custard was outstanding. This was the only remarkable dish.

Some fried pork patty with salad - Whose idea was it to grind up some pork and fry it into a patty? The presentation was poor and it was soaked through with oil. We thought that the dish might be redeemed through its flavor, but alas, it was no good.

Oxtail with pasta (the one on their tasting menu) - The best part of this dish was the pasta. It was well cooked and springy. The oxtail was plain. The way they were cut into little cubes reminded me of dog food. 

Quail - The quail was perfectly cooked, slightly rare and delicious. The presentation was good on this one. Then, they ruin it by adding this small red pasta at the bottom of the dish with a very salty sauce. Why?

The food was bad for $100+/person. I've lost a lot of respect for Mario.",mEpr4S6J83OanL7GIHbRFw,3,0,2,Avq4wRVLr9pBJQmFlKjVpg

How you can make a seafood linguine for $29 dollars is beyond me.  I'm guessing their clams are clammier than your normal clam.  Or found in some distant, unknown cove in the Sea of Tranquility.  If so, I couldn't tell.  Seemed like a normal seafood linguine to me.  As for my beef cheek ravioli, I'm sure Mr. Batali's idea for creating this dish was ""Let's stuff everything that's tasty into a small pouch.  Texturally, it felt like I was eating baby food.  And it was too rich.  Every bite felt like eating a pillowcase of butter.

However the hostess continued to seat other diners in the same area,cramped and right next to each other.  Another couple asked to be moved as well.

The food... We started with the grilled octopus, and it was delicious! The octopus was tender, and moist.  The chef got this on point.  I ordered the linguine with clams which was bland, and the noodles seemed too undercooked.  My boyfriend ordered the short ribs, which were ok, nothing special.

1593470,2009-12-23,1,GTR39A2jwNIS_NV8q2r_JA,"On vacation over Xmas break, and our local friends really recommended this restaurant.
My wife and I went with high expectations....we've been to many highend restaurants and I'd consider us very adventurous and open eaters.

We were very DISAPPOINTED!

Most of the tasting menus that I have tried at other highend restaurants are actually tasting menus that included many dishes that are also available from the a la carte menu.
The dishes from these tasting menus are totally different that what is offered on their a la carte menu.

I didn't think much about this disrepancy at the time, and especially because the waitress really recommended the tasting menus, that was what we ordered. They had 2 options, both 7 course dinners for $99.  The first was the pasta tasting menu, which my wife ordered; the 2nd was the regional tasting menu, which i ordered.  Thus we were able to share and taste both tasting menus.

The pasta tasting menu, to say the least, was GROSS!
It started off decently....lamb's brain ravioli, a squid ink pasta; however the main course was totally DISGUSTING!  Duck testicles and liver and cocks combs in a simple pasta.  I am generally very good about eating all sorts of organs and animal parts, however, the stink of the meat was just too much for me.  Usually, a great dish that involves some very stinky meat will try to mask or downgrade the stink of the meat.  This dish, however, really accentuated the stink of the meat to the point that I needed to drink more wine to wash down and get the stinky taste out of my mouth!
My wife almost puked at the odor of it after just one bite!
The next course wasn't any better....liver ravioli drenched in so much basalmic vinegar that i started coughing as soon as i put it towards my mouth!!

The regional tasting menu was very similar....a decent first 2 courses which included a simple egg yolk truffle pasta and a rabbit ravioli.  Again, it was the main course that really bordered on inedible....
I was expecting a nice piece of veal, but what I got was a long strip of veal (really fatty, almost like bacon) which was rolled with chestnuts and anchovies.  It seemed like a great idea, however, it was more fat than veal.  Each bite was pretty much a soggy bite of grease to the point where i just couldn't eat it anymore after 2-3 bites....

To say the least, my wife and I barely made it through 3-4 courses, and just couldn't take anymore of it....

The waitress basically directed any concerns immediately to the manager who basically said that it was our fault for ordering something that we either didn't understand or simply didn't enjoy....especially after speaking with the pretentious manager (I believe her name was Melinda), my wife almost left the restaurant in tears.  My wife was so disappointed in our meals, and the manager just didn't seem to care enough to do anything about our unsatisfying experience at the restaurant.  The manager basically insisted that although our meal was totally unsatisfying and borderline GROSS, we had to pay the full price, so for about $300+ for the 2 tasting menus and a bottle of wine, we had one of the most horrible experiences ever at a restaurant.

Bottom line:  AVOID THE TASTING MENUS even though the waitress really pushed it.
And if you run into any problems or issues, don't expect a satisfying result because the very pretentious and stubborn manager doesn't believe in satisfying unsatisfied guests.  And the entire situation could end up ruining your vacation as one of the most horrible dining experiences EVER!!!

A restaurant is considered great because of its great service and always consistent quality of food.

I went with 3 other gfs for dinner a few weeks ago. The venue was cute and the servers started off very professionally and attentive, and then it kind of went downhill from there. We would ask for random things like olive oil or separate checks, and they would forget about it. We had to ask twice. Our server was nice, but a little too stoic...and not  as attentive as I would expect from such a restaurant. 

As for the food, one word: salty. But I've heard this could be Batali's style...so maybe it's just me...but my pasta was so salty, I couldn't finish it. 

This is what we ordered:

Octopus salad: pretty good. Probably the best dish of the night. The octopus was tender.

Beet salad: Also pretty good. Very colorful. 

Linguine with clams: disappointment! My noodles were not only undercooked, but dry. They said it's bc it's al dente. I like al dente, but this was beyond. Many of the noodles were stuck together and they were pretty hard. So I sent it back. They made a new dish for me. Noodles were perfect. However, it was so salty, I couldn't finish it. And I really tried, too. Salt lick. 

We got a few other pasta dishes. My gf had to send hers back bc the noodles were also undercooked. My other gf 's pasta dish wasn't appetizing, so she didn't finish hers. Another gf of mine got the short ribs, and she enjoyed her dish. It tasted pretty good. Salty, though.

We picked this restaurant (they have 3 in this location) for it's more adventurous and unique menu.  We were not disappointed. In fact, I was sent into full-on crave mode, and the next day we lunched at Canaletto. Pasta, just please give me more of his pasta. I went from virgin to addict overnight. 

Anyhoo, the order - house made salumi, prosciutto with perfect pears and charred bread (both mouthwatering), green salad (basic but lovely - get it to achieve balance), pasta bolognese and pasta with lobster (both outstanding). Top quality ingredients, simply done and perfectly cooked.  The amuse of chick pea bruschetta rocked. It was a toss up whether to get dessert or cheese - and the ricotta and fruit dessert fulfilled both desires in a well portioned, not over sweet way.  

The room is dark yet open, masculine and shiny - with walls and walls of glass doored wine displays. Flowers and rustic wood touches warm it nicely.  

Service was top notch - how often do you actually want to converse at length with the staff? They were incredibly knowledgeable, and both the waiter and female sommelier could have joined us for dinner and we would have been perfectly happy.

When Paulo Duran left Otto to join re-join B&B as the new GM, of course we would follow him. The outstanding service he and his team provide makes us feel special and valued, and has made us loyal followers. So when we heard about an olive oil dinner, we were intrigued.

The evening of January 25th we arrived at B&B a little early for the Tenuta diCapezzana Olive Oil Dinner. I saw another couple, and curious if they were there for the dinner I approached them. Much to my surprise, the woman was Beatrice, whose family owns Capezzana, a 345 acre farm producing olive oil & wine. Also on hand was one of our favorite chefs, Chef Nicole Brisson, formerly of Executive Chef of Carnevino and recently promoted to Culinary Director of B and B Hospitality Group. The evening was promising to be great!

1st Course
Trio of Crostini - chicken liver, cavolo nero, and traditional ""fett'unta""
Yes, chicken liver. Nicole did a nice job of balancing the flavors and the earthiness paired with Capezzana's fresh-pressed olive oil was really nice. My favorite was the very simple fett'unta, where the olive oil really sang.

2nd Course
Insalata Pinzimonio - wonderful palate cleanser of cold shaved radish, carrots, green olives and more drizzled with Capezzana's fresh-pressed olive oil

3rd Course
Tuscan Ribollita - a Tuscan soup of mixed vegetables and cannelini beans, warms the soul!

4th Course
Tordelli with Swiss Chard and Ricotta - wonderful little pillows of pasta delicately resting in softened ricotta with al dente swiss chard and a little heavenly bite of what I believe was pancetta.

5th Course
Dry Aged Bistecca Fiorentina - Oh. My. God. Nicole brought this luscious 100 day (or was it 120 days?) dry-aged goodness from Carnevino. The depth of flavor and tenderness was absolutely incredible! Drizzled with a bit of Capezzana's fresh-pressed olive oil and we were in heaven! And to add to an already wonderful course, Fagioli di Fiasco and sautéed mixed Baby Kale were served as accompaniments.

Dessert Course
Schiacciata alla Fiorentina and Olive Oil Gelato - what a wonderful way to wrap up!

Service was so-so.  The waiter knew the menu well, however I was less-than-impressed when at the end of my meal, I told him to mention to the pastry chef that one of the complimentary sweets (the oatmeal cookie) that came with the check was prbably mistakenly made with salt instead of sugar - and he simply brushed it off.

It was white truffle season, I had the special pasta made from yolks, tossed in butter and finished with about 5 grams of white truffle shavings.  It was made perfectly and totally decadent and delicious.

I ordered a side of roasted brussel sprouts with pancetta.  The brussel sprouts were nicely charred however, even though I know pancetta is very savory, the overall dish was overly salty.

At the end of my meal, along with the check came 3 complimentary sweets - an oatmeal cookie, a tiny fruit paste and one more item I can't remember now.  As mentioned before, the oatmeal cookie was as if it was made with salt and a whole lot of baking powder of some sort - it was definitely a mistake.

somewhat pricy food and it's less than amazing Italian cuisine. However, if you talk to my fiance, and he will tell you a different story. 

I first came here when it was fairly new. I remember waiting for a bit to get seated, even though we had reservations. But I didn't mind; the white wine I had kept me preoccupied. Actually, I must say, their wine selection is what seriously stood out more than the food itself. I was able to enjoy a bottle of a white and a red wine which totaled more than $400.

I recall that during my first time, the pasta entree my fiance bought was a bit too ""al dente."" The server offered to have it prepared less al dente but we just sent it back without asking for an another dish. Instead, I shared my gnocchi with him, which was decent, but nothing extraordinary.

Did I mention, this place has THE BEST calimari I've ever had the pleasure of munching on?! The squid was so tender, the spices and citrus flavors were very well balanced, the breading was perfect and the bits of cauliflower was a nice touch. At 18/19 bucks it better damn well be the best! :P

Anyway, my second visit was...anti-climactic. I was hoping I'd have a very similar time as my first visit but something was missing. The service was subpar and my salmon was...OK for 40 bucks. I felt like I was being served by someone at TGI Fridays at some points, which is not a big deal if you're trying to make a classy restaurant have a more casual atmosphere. I also thought the salmon wasn't as fresh tasting as I would expect and wasn't the best quality I had. At least the herbs, spices and citrus flavors along with it being grilled brought the salmon together nicely; it just would have been nice if the salmon itself was of better quality.  My fiance's lamb was superb and of course, the calamari did not disappoint. 

Overall, I think I'd go again...only if someone pays and their calmari does not run out or experiences a change.",j0vDYYFE2eNvjm5NXHFmbA,1,0,3,z2d5QLlwUbQQIh4_Aswl6A

And on top of that, we were going to try the restaurant associated to Mario Batali and Joe Bastianich. I had really high high high expectations, but was really really really disappointed.

We ordered:
*Bone Marrow Ravioli with Osso Bucco Ragu $32. I believe the concept of wrapping pasta around bone marrow is both spectacular and a delicate process, however, the dish failed to wow me. The pasta was fresh and super al dente. When I ate it, I felt the texture of the bone marrow oozing out of its al dente shell, like a gusher candy, but the flavor was lacking. I guess bone marrow is better paired as a topping to compliment a dish rather to serve as the main content in a ravioli dish. 

*Spaghettini with Spicy Budding Chives, Sweet Garlic and One-Pound Lobster #32. The dish was sufficient. The lobster was there, but the spaghetti was yet again, too, al dente. We also started noticing the chef tending to give a heavy hand of salt for each dish. 

*Roast Pork Cheeks/Belly. Tasty, but a little too burnt as you can see in my picture. I know the place was dim and has romantic lighting, but it was a little too burnt to be acceptable. 

*lled Ribeye for Two with Roasted Potatoes and Aceto Manodori $120. After waiting 45 minutes for the dish to come, it was displayed to us over a cutting board as a one piece of steak. Then the waiter, took it aside, and sliced it into more management pieces and reorganized it onto a dish. The meat was cooked perfect for medium rare. However, it was apparent, too much salt. We were too lazy to complain because we couldn't wait another 45 minutes for a new one. We were so hungry. But it was truly disappointing. 

Overall, I was so super disappointed with B&B. I was really expecting top knotch food. The service was great, but the food was horrible. It will be hard for me to go back to any place with the name Batali or Bastianich associated to it. There are a lot of great restaurants in Vegas, unfortunately, B&B doesn't cut it on my list.

Las Vegas is filled with high-priced restaurants backed by celebrity chefs.  Unfortunately, most of them are very expensive and simply not that good.  They tend to feature menus that do not change that often and the food quality is just mediocre at best.  There are some exceptions.  MGM Grand's L'atelier de Joel Robuchon features exceptionally creative and modern French cuisine that embraces French flavors and techniques while losing the richness and heaviness to deliver more vibrant and lighter cuisine. And Mario Batali's Carnevino (in the Palazzo) serves very good and thick cuts of beef though the sides, (most of their) pastas and desserts underwhelm.

Batali's other high-end Las Vegas restaurant (B&B Ristorante) is also located in The Palazzo / Venetian, but it focuses on Italian starters, pastas and entrees and not the steakhouse fare of Carnevino.  B&B Ristorante immediately reminds me of Batali's Osteria Mozza in Los Angeles.  The menus look the same (and some of the dishes even seem very similar).  A pasta tasting menu is offered at both spots.  And the decor at both places are similar--lots of dark wood (dark lighting too).

The food though is just not as good.  Starting with the amuse of crostini topped with garbanzo beans.  It was perfectly fine, but it lacked the punch of the similar amuse crostini at Osteria Mozza, which features creamy and freshly made ricotta as well as fragrant and fresh basil.

B&B's burrata starter was a simple preparation with cracked pepper, olive oil and good and grilled bruschetta-like toasts.  The burrata starter was fine, but it was something I would expect to find at Batali's more casual and much less pricey Pizzeria Mozza than a supposedly high-end spot like B&B.  Osteria, on the other hand, showcases much more creative burrata dishes with great flavor combinations and ingredients.

B&B's octopus was garnished with a mix of Italian white beans and a limoncello vinaigrette.  The octopus was big yet soft and the overall flavor was good though I think the octopus at Osteria Mozza is much more focused and thus more intense and distinct.

The beef cheek ravioli with black truffles and crushed duck liver is a popular pasta option here, but I found it very underwhelming.  While the flavor was fine, the truffle flavor was not there.  The pasta itself was okay, but the beef cheek filling was very puree like.  I would have preferred a more braised beef-like filling.

The crispy sweetbreads entree was served atop a butternut squash puree and with a side of frisee salad garnished with crisp apples.  The frisee salad was fine, but the sweetbreads had a very unattractive color.  They looked like karaage not fried at a high enough temperature.  There was not much crispiness on the exterior (not much flavor either).  The inside was okay (not too fatty), but it lacked the hot and juicy center of really nicely prepared sweetbreads.

For dessert, the warm chocolate torta was the all-too-common chocolate molten lava cake, but it was still satisfying with a good cake-like exterior and a rich and warm chocolate center (it came with olive oil gelato).  The tiramisu was kind of like a modern take on tiramisu with a cake topped with mascarpone cream and then garnished with a chocolate sauce and an espresso gelato.  It was an okay dessert, but it lacked the great strong flavor of tiramisu.

The apple crostata with vanilla bean gelato was not good.  The apples were not that caramelized and the pastry was a little greasy.  It was too soft--not crispy enough like a great crostata or puff pastry.

Service was okay--pleasant enough but ordering and getting the bill took too long.  Service was just not as attentive as it should have been.

As mentioned, B&B features a mostly dark interior so it does not have that memorable of a look.  The restaurant gets loud.

Prices are very high, but that is to be expected given that the restaurant comes from Batali and it is in Vegas.  The pasta tasting menu seems like an okay value if all of the pasta courses are satisfying.

B&B Ristorante is, unfortunately, a lot like many of the other upscale Las Vegas restaurants--it feels the part and comes from a big name, but the food is simply too expensive and nowhere near the same standard of similar restaurants in cities like San Francisco, Los Angeles, Chicago, and New York.

The Palazzo / Venetian, like all the other major hotels and casinos on The Strip, offers complimentary self and valet parking.",w-w-k-QXosIKQ8HQVwU6IQ,16,11,2,DSAXuFN4rP9JXkiR2bEOgQ
1712086,2012-05-07,1,GTR39A2jwNIS_NV8q2r_JA,"I had the pleasure of enjoying the pasta tasting menu with wine pairings las month. As I was alone, I sat at the bar. Ian and Adam, the excellent bartenders, were very familiar with the menu and helped me in both selecting what to order (I told them that I was interested in a tasting menu; they did not try to upsell me) and guiding me through the dishes (both flavor and history) as they arrived. 

Mike, the sommelier, was also great. He paired the wines exquisitely and did an excellent job of explaining both the characteristics of the wines and the reasons for the pairings.

The food itself was wonderful. The flavors were so excellent that I had to pause and enjoy each bite. There were two standouts, though everything was excellent: the polenta pasta (cresc'tajat) with truffles was simple and beautiful and the fettuccine with Norcino ragu had beautifully married flavors. With respect to the fettuccine, Adam told me that the ragu takes over 8 hours to prepare. It shows and is well worth the time. Lovely.

Am I effusing? Yes. But, it was really that good. I love excellent food and really appreciate great service. I found both at B & B. Please, don't miss it.",Swc5vpwq4PFsC5rqIil0Cg,5,2,5,OLlgRBHJ9gEOELqzhDVGJw

So many years idolizing you and trying to get reservations to your restaurant in New York Babbo but to no avail so I was so excited in trying your Italian cuisine. First the seating was horrible. I sat on the booth side and there is a definite flaw in the design. The seat is too low and the table to high making it uncomfortable to eat.  I was not the only person to comment on it. Another party sat beside us and they quickly commented how odd the seating was and asked to move.  The seating was just the beginning, the service was not great.  The waitress forgot the side dish altogether and didn't even let us know about the chocolate budino (soufflé) which usually takes 20 minutes and is customary to ask if you would be wanting so they could prepare beforehand. We ordered the orecchiette with lamb sausage and rapini. The dish was good, but nothing out of this world. The octopus was the only dish we had that I considered to be worthy of a four and five star restaurant.  I had the rabbit porchetta which was different, but wouldn't order again. We also had the Veal Chop which was  good. Not even the dessert was pulled off.  We ordered the chocolate cake served with a peanut butter shake. The chocolate cake was hard as if it was frozen, on the other hand the milk shake was phenomenal. The seating, service and dishes that were average contributed my 3.5 stars. I am disappointed since I have been a fan of Mario Batali for many years and I refuse to believe this is all there is so I will be going to Lunch at his other restaurant Otto. Hopefully this will help restore my vision of him as a master of Italian cuisine.",ut0_rAUnJYkrAKQKHxbH5w,3,4,3,rQ_aM9HF3q_3yvZHbCzsRQ

Six of us chose this as our ""big"" meal out in Vegas. Terra was our server and she was eloquent, very generous with advice. 

Started with an amuse bouche of toast points topped with chickpeas tossed in a black olive tapenade and sweet basil. Garlic tempered with dulcet tones of basil and fresh bean. 

The antipasti dish is served by the person and varies depending on the night. They have a big storage area for cured meats. Four of us tipped in and we got six types of salami. Simple food but extraordinary tastes. The prosciutto was buttery, soppressata brought the heat, the sage spices dominated and then we discovered the chewy bologna. But best of all? It comes with a bag of steaming savory sopapillas. Tiny little pillows of heaven. 

I got the octopus appetizer, which was thick as a good steak but tender, no chew at all. They served it with a pungent pepper chutney and some thinly sliced radish. Tasted very spanish, paired with some house cured olives and peppers. 

Anything with fresh produce or herbs was a hit. They've got an exclusive herb grower, Paula Pudwell, who provides them with all the main herbs as well as some lesser known types, like mint lovage. Apparently they grow well in the arid Vegas soil. We had no complaints, especially when the mint straciatelli gelato hit the table. They've also got an exclusive forager, Kerry Clasby, who travels throughout California to track down their produce. They say that its driven out each night to arrive fresh each morning. Quick tangent. Apparently they've organized a local farmers market on wednesdays for these products. It used to just draw cooks but now it draws the larger community or so they say. 

My two minute sicilian lifeguard squid was tasty but next time I'd go for a chop entree or the pasta bolognese. Perhaps more boring but so comforting. I did enjoy the beef cheek ravioli with duck liver. 

My highlight was the yogurt semifreddo. House made yogurt served semi-frozen with an almond dough base topped with candied dates and honey. I was stuffed but then they brought out tiny desserts, a triangle of apple gelee and a petite orange cornmeal biscotti.",PntWHBXMz37_GHPtjY0_2g,8,4,5,EUM_7yqPpcdfibT4oeswHA

1729365,2014-10-21,3,GTR39A2jwNIS_NV8q2r_JA,"My boyfriend is a huge fan of Batali, and we've been meaning to go here awhile. Managed to snag a last-minute reservation on a whim, but by the time we left I was almost irritated with the overall experience.
The appetizers we selected were awesome, the pasta we shared was terrific, but everything after that was extremely underwhelming. Best advice is to sit at the bar, order apps and some pastas to share, or do the tasting menu. 

Started with a complimentary CHICKPEA BRUSCHETTA that was interesting but not something I'd suggest they add to the menu any time soon.
PORK TROTTER ALLA MILANESE with Roasted Tomato and Cannellini Bean Vinaigrette (BF's favorite) and WARM LAMB'S TONGUE with Chanterelle Mushrooms and a 3-Minute Egg (my favorite)- both really good, would get again.

Shared the HOMEMADE ORECCHETTE with Spicy Lamb Sausage and Rapini, which was very nice. The pasta was perfectly fresh and chewy, the lamb and rapini paired well together, and the sauce didn't overwhelm the other ingredients.  Made me wish I'd just ordered different pasta dishes instead of meat-based entrees.

RABBIT PORCHETTA with Peperonata, Sunflower Sprouts and Crispy Confit was underwhelming and slightly overcooked. Wasn't wowed by this at all.
GRILLED PORK CHOP with Kuri Kuri Squash, Apples in ""Agrodolce"" and Green Walnut: I'm not a fan of pork chops and apple sauce, but this upscale version worked. The chop was flavorful, fatty, and salty but the squash and apples mellowed it out well. Wouldn't get this again, though, this isn't really what I'm coming to a Batali restaurant for.

Lastly, we ended with the TIRAMISU with espresso gelato: BF's pick as I didn't want dessert at all. We received the plate with the gelato already mostly melted, forming a puddle of soup. I would have taken a picture of the travesty, but wanted to get at least a single bite. Not impressed at all.
Received a complimentary dessert sampler of bite-size goodies like meringue and biscotti: these nibbles were better than the dessert we actually ordered, which somehow just made me more irritated about spending $14 on melted gelato.

ADDITIONAL DETAILS: I suggest sitting at the bar because the dining room tables are so close together and the majority of the smaller tables for couples are alongside the open wall by the walkway. The passing traffic was so noisy that I couldn't comfortably carry on conversation even before parties were seated on either side of us. After that? Forget it, everything had to be repeated several times.
The service, while knowledgeable, was not personable. Whatever.
Everything ordered after the pasta was mediocre, and the fact that half of my dessert was melted when it reached me is an oversight I don't expect when dining at a restaurant of this caliber.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,6,4,3,lX10lV9crkQi-lDb9yLO2Q

I think I enjoyed my meal here, but the reason why I think this as opposed to knowing this is because I was drunk off my rocker. Now, I came here with my ex for ""breakfast"", which, in Las Vegas time, meant 4 PM - so we actually had an early dinner. I ordered a fantastic pasta with pulled lamb's meat, and even in my pathetically drunken state, I remember thinking to myself, ""WOW! THIS PASTA IS PERFECTLY AL DENTE!"" Oh - and the meat was so incredibly tender that I remember sobering up for 10 seconds. Just 10 seconds.

We came in after seeing the Phantom of the Opera (during its last weeks performance in Vegas). We had a reservation for 10:15pm but came on early. We did not have any problems getting in early. The hostess is very nice and pretty too :) I gave them 4 stars because we were seated in a very tiny area where people sits very close to each other. The 3 ladies that were seating behind us was very noisy and were flirting too much with the boys seating right next to us. My Mom and I had a very hard time hearing our conversation. All we can hear was giggles from the girls table. One good thing with the room eventhough its a little bit on the dark side is we were seated right next to the wine stack which is very interesting. I kinda like it.                                Food wise everything is superb !!! We ordered several of their favorites. We were given an amuse bouche and a complimentary bread. Both were delicious.    We shared a salad. For the main course we ordered the beef cheek ravioli with truffles and it was very good. The pasta is perfectly cooked. Mom had the Branzino. They were very nice to asked us if we wanted to have it fillet. The fish has lots of bones so its a good idea to have it fillet. It was very good too. After we enjoyed our entree we decided to get dessert. Peaches and cream and my all time favorite tiramisu. Overall it was a great experience. I was not disappointed.

1739854,2011-01-17,3,GTR39A2jwNIS_NV8q2r_JA,"Before going to Las Vegas for my best friend's 21st birthday I asked around a bit for recommendations of restaurants to take him to. The typical suggestions were given (Michael Mina, Joël Robuchon, etc) but one name stood out in my mind; B and B Ristorante. I did my research on the place and found out that it's on the amazing list of Mario Batali owned restaurants. Perfect. The same friend and I just recently went to Manhattan for my college graduation and we ate at multiple Batali restaurants (Lupa and Pó) which both blew us away. I've also dined at his Los Angeles restaurant, Pizzeria Mozza (next door to Osteria Mozza). Each and every time I've dined at a Batali owned restaurant my stomach has left extremely happy and my wallet isn't too hurt. B and B was a perfect choice to celebrate my friend's second birthday dinner.

B and B is inside the very classy Venetian Hotel and is tucked on Restaurant Row. It's Friday night in Vegas so the casino floor is bumpin' and there are suits and cocktail dresses galore while walking to the restaurant. Thankfully we came prepared and were sporting our suits as well. After walking the million or so steps through the humongous hotel/casino we arrived in front of B and B and were happily greeted by the two gorgeous hostesses. We then were led to our seats against the ""window"" in a cozy half booth half table. Sitting by the window was great because the people watching outside couldn't be beat. Out of all the hotels we went to beforehand, the Venetian definitely had the most attractive, interesting, and fun-looking crowd.

Our extremely professional server came over to greet us and take our drink orders. Right away we felt as if we had been teleported off the bustling Las Vegas Strip and into a fine dining restaurant tucked under a stoop in NYC. After looking over the menu we came to our decisions.

To start, we got one order of calamari and seppie fritti to share. This was probably the best calamari I've tasted in my life. The sauce at the bottom complimented the calamari perfectly by adding a slight spice to each bite but not enough to knock you out of your chair. We devoured the dish pretty quickly and then sat back to wait for our pastas.

My friend and I are big pasta lovers so we stuck to the Primi section of the menu. My friend ordered the spaghettini (with spicy budding chives, sweet garlic and one-pound lobster). The second my friend said his order our server got ecstatic. He said it was one of their best dishes and also one of their most popular. He then described in great detail exactly how it is prepared as well as how each ingredient compliments the next. Whoa. ""This guy knows his shit."" For me, I got the goat cheese tortelloni (with dried orange and wild fennel pollen). Again, our pro-status server then described how it's cooked and how the ingredients would taste with each other. My friend's dish was amazing. It had a small kick of spice but the lobster helped even out the flavor. Also, the lobster was the most tender, melt-in-your-mouth lobster I've ever tasted. My dish was also fabulous. I'm sold immediately to any dish that is prepared with goat cheese and this dish didn't upset. The milky goat cheese gave an explosion of flavor with each bite and the tiny shavings of orange offered a different and interesting flavor every third bite or so.

Before our meal started I told our server very discretely that it was my friend's birthday. He said that if we order a dessert they will add a candle but they don't offer any special (by this I mean complimentary) birthday desserts. Hm, oh well. We ordered the dark chocolate torta (with spiced huckleberries). Sure enough, out came a candle and script writing on the side of the dish. It looked beautiful (as well as delicious). Needless to say, we devoured this thing pretty damn quick as well.

Being familiar with Mario Batali's cooking we both came in knowing exactly what to expect; an amazing meal. We both left very satisfied. We then proudly and excitedly crossed yet another Batali restaurant off our list.",aYM006S1U0VwX9ZTjR3KQg,5,4,4,EQiaEae5xd1cKmTylBEsdg
1749759,2009-09-10,0,GTR39A2jwNIS_NV8q2r_JA,"I think it's not bad but it's a Batali place so I expected more.  The menu seemed similar to Babbo in NYC (which requires very advanced reservation) so I was excited to try B&B and was able to make the reservation the day of.  

The amuse with chickpeas was nice but nothing special. 

We started with the special of the day app, which were the fried squash blossoms stuffed with ricotta cheese.  I usually don't see this on most restaurant menus so I was excited that this item was on the special menu. They light and I loved the sauce they were on.  I think it was around $18 or so for 4 blossoms.  Ouch.

We went with the seafood theme so we both ordered the lobster pasta.  I was not impressed.  The sauce was just ok, it didn't taste very fresh to me.   There are several Italian places in NYC that I think would make a better version. 

For the main, we shared the grilled branzino.  It's simply grilled fish, nothing special.  What really shined and was memorable was the herb salad that accompanied the fish.  Unfortunately, there was only about a tablespoon of it.

Perhaps they're better with meat items but considering that we paid about $200 (without wine, and 1 dessert) for 2, I expected more.  If the price was lower then I would have given 3 starts but the price doesn't justify the quality.

Perhaps they're catering to tourists and not local repeat customers which explains the quality but I guess I'll have to make that reservation at Babbo to find out.

Overall, the experience was utterly mediocre for the price.",bhk04kv2BU9tVRUeJ7808w,1,0,2,72Ap7z6NRGhubYLehgkoQw

Granted, I ate what may be the best pork chop of my life there (a bone-in number with a quintz accompanyment), but I didn't walk out happy.

We each got one of the tasting menus and were overall disappointed. I had a glass of the Morellino di Scansano I Perazzi La Mozza 2007 Toscana and enjoyed this glass and a half pour with a mini decanter very much.  Very smooth, no acid, no tannins, not great fruit, but just enough. 

For starters both tasting menus start off with 3 courses of raviolis.  Its just raviolis after raviolis.  For example, for the Pasta tasting menu, you get a ricotta ravioli in butter sauce, lambs brain ravioli in butter sauce with sage, a green pasta with a light meat sauce, and then another ravioli filled with short ribs. I mean enough with the raviolis. The next course Gnocchi was a real disappointment.  The gnocchi was really super firm, bordering on hard, obviously not hand made, and definitely not light.  and again with a braised oxtail which tasted like beef brisket. The highlight of this meal was the 2 dessert courses.  The Zabaglione with grapefruit was absolutely light, sublime, transcending, magical.  It reminded my friend of some delicious Japanese dessert crapes he had in Seattle with strawberries, whipped cream and Zabaglione in a crape cone.  The final dessert was an Italian Flan with crunchy cocoa nibs which was very good. Overall a C+.  Portions very small.  5-8 ravioli per plate. All the ravioli were hand made.

The Lombardia Veal Tasting Menu was not much better. The first course was a thin deli like slice of cooked veal over a mayonnaise sauce with some capers.  Next was a very creamy Tallegio cheese ravioli which tasted liked warm brie inside ravioli, melt in your mouth good.  The next bone marrow ravioli was not memorable at all. My friend liked the next course best, a pounded thin slice of veal, breaded with like panko and deep fried very crispy and topped with arugula and a lemon wedge.  I liked it, but nothing to write home about.  I've had very good country fried steak which were better and more tender. Next was a very slender piece of medium gorgonzola cheese with some candied fruit, a very small and delicate cheese plate.  The desserts for this tasting menu were awful.  Toasted panttone with apricot jam was a joke.  Cinnamon, honeyed butter toast would have been better. And the fried Italian donuts were dense like dense cake, not light like a good beignet, not worth the calories or effort to eat the whole thing. 

They also raised the price from 100 to $120 on Thursday March 10, 2011 and raised the wine paring from 70 to 75.  They comped my wine because of the confusion, but that was still not enough to erase a disappointing Italian meal.  All my buddy and I could do was to recall better meals we had in our lives.  

I can't speak for the rest of the menu.  if this was their best foot forward, then I would spend my money elsewhere.",s06IMX1XdPgzgflWh7qbaA,0,0,2,BD4BXBGJHEBSVR9GVsSPQw
1776628,2010-03-23,1,GTR39A2jwNIS_NV8q2r_JA,"I took my mama here for a very big birthday. Sorry I can't tell you which one bc everytime I want to mention it she subtly kicks me in the legs or taps my arm not so lightly. It was a tight rush but we arrived at B&B with 1 minute to spare (literally) straight from our check-in at the MGM. The hostess seated us right away.

I ordered my mom a glass of Moscato di' Asti which is very sweet (usually served as a dessert wine) and slightly sparkling. I got a glass of the Barolo Lecinquevigne Damilano 2004 from Piemonte. If you like sweeter drinks then I would definitely recommend the Moscato. Its the highest quality that I have ever had. It tasted like they were crushing the Muscat grapes in my mouth. The Barolo was nice but I think I was hoping it would be a little bolder. 

We got the Grilled Octopus with Limoncello vinaigrette for our starter. The best! I thought it was going to be like a salad with octopus but the octopus is really the feature of this dish (and you get alot of it). They serve the octopus on top of a flagolet beans + pickled red onions. The sweetness of the red onion (candied a little?) contrasts really well against the tartness of the limoncello. But the smokiness of the Octopus (cooked perfectly by the way) is what really makes this dish shine.

For my main I ordered the Beef Cheek Ravioli with Duck Liver in a brown butter sauce. Obviously this dish isn't for the faint of heart (no pun intended). The butter sauce has alot of goodies from the ravioli's so its a very rich dish through and through. If was good but if I went back for a 2nd time I would probably get the bucatini or the branzini. My mom ordered the black spaghetti with nduja and sicilian pesto. She really liked it (me not so much) but she's a spicy person. The waiter warned that theres some type of red pepper that is used when they make the sausage used in the dish and that is why it is so hot. 

We ordered the chocolate torte with candied hazelnuts and salted caramel gelato for the birthday girl. My mom is a ""death by chocolate"" sort of girl. She loved this dessert but I can't do desserts this sweet. So I ordered a cappucino and it was really good. 

All in all a good experience. Only slight negatives of the night were the cold slices of bread they give you (pre meal) and are waiter was a newby. You could definitely tell he hadn't spent any time working his way up from buser to server.

Only down fall was the tiramisu, but Ian quickly exchanged it with a smooth chocolate Gelato! So overall with food, service and ambience I give it a 5 star...or 4 3/4.",yzmjH7q7h_zn9BuPpd_0lw,1,1,4,OMWIl3tfmi4hXM5pgbWS7w

I decided to go with the Toscana Tasting Menu and a nice red wine chose by my waiter that would pair reasonably well with everything.

The restaurant opens up into a walkway in the Venetian near the Rock of Ages theater.  I thought the music might be disturbing to the restaurant ambiance but did not find it to be so.  It remained well in the background.

Course 1 - Culatello Riserva ham with ripe nectarines.  Great starter.

Course 2 - Pappa al Pomodoro.  This tomato and bread soup was excellent with bright flavor and not too heavy.

Course 3 - Pici con Rigatino.  This housemade pasta was perfectly cooked and served with a rigatino, pecorino, and herb meat and olive oil dressing.  The portion looked small but the noodles were dense, flavorful and satisfying.

Course 4 - Berkshire Pork Shoulder with a peach mostarda condiment and fennel.  The meat was perfectly cooked and seasoned and was butter-soft tender.

Course 5 - House Made Ricotta and glazed figs on crostini.  Creamy light ricotta made for a nice finisher.

Course 6 - Tiramisu with espresso gelato.  Add a cup of coffee and the meal was complete.

I asked to waiter to pick a good amaro as a digestive.  He brought a glass of Cio Ciaro.  This was awesome.  I asked him to show me the bottle and write the name of it down.  I'm getting my own bottle.

The Italian wine selection is well thought through, we had a nice bottle of wine from Piedmont.

My best friend booked this restaurant as a surprise and when we got there I was very excited.  I've never tried a Batali restaurant and so I was anticipating a wonderful Italian dining experience.

The service was not up to par.  While our waitress was very knowledgeable about the menu, etc., she was very pack luster, did not sale and I felt as if there was somewhere she'd rather be (well, of course! She was working.  But, at least loom as if you love your job!!).

I had the crispy pork trotter appetizer.  Very so so.  But, I de died to order the lamb's tongue and mushroom app for the table.  I did it incognito so that nobody would know what it was and just try it before they knew.  Well, our wonderful waitress announced what it was when it was brought to the table.  Really??? Right after I just pointed it out quietly to you and asked you to bring an order to the table???? Of course, the ladies refused to try it after knowing what it was.  But me and my buddy really enjoyed it.  It's the only reason why I gave this place 2 stars instead of one.

My main course just stunk!  It was homemade orecchiette with sausage and broccolni.  It tasted like Ragu from a jar!!  After that dish we decided to skip dessert.  We even skipped coffee.

The wine, ORDER wine by the glass, the servers pour about 12 ounces into a decanter for the same price as a glass at a fancy restaurant: $26.

 Very average food, pasta was the highlight of the meal. Unique taste and flavor combinations, such as the mint ravioli with the lamb merguez. For entrees the short ribs and polenta was a hit. 

The two minute calamari was not what I expected, and sadly underwhelmed by the dish. It was under seasoned and missing a flavor dimension (either acid or salt or perhaps red pepper). The steak with porcini mushroom mustard was a unique combination.

The service was impeccable, something to be expected from the caliber of the restaurant and the price tag.

 Beginning with the terrible chick pea and toast, free but tasteless, wasted ingredient. Calamari was ok but no sauce and large portion, while the aged meats plate was decent. 

Then ordered the lobster pasta and the sweet sausage pasta. The lobster pasta had very little sauce and when asked for more sauce we were denied by the chef, also not allowed to have drawn butter apparently! Not worth 32 dollars and was not offered parmesan or crushed red peppers! The sweet sausage pasta was good though, again no condiments allowed. 

Our final course was the veal which was expensive and ver marbelized, to the point of being work to find the meat, but the parts that were edible were very good! 

 Oh by the way, be ready to order all of your courses at the same time bc that's the rules.

 Waiter also ignored shawna even though it wad my b day dinner and she picked up the bill, which was way overpriced; and also was charged for our comped desert which was awarded to us bc of poor service. Desert wad bland chocolate w berries, coffee was also lame. 

AVOID THIS PLACE bc there are so many other great places that will treat you right and also serve amazing food for less than what we spent. Waste of money, time, and food. Poor form Mario Batali.....

1904779,2008-04-19,2,GTR39A2jwNIS_NV8q2r_JA,"I've been here twice. The first time was within my first few weeks living in Vegas, and I thought I'd hit a goldmine. My dining companion and I stuck to the appetizers and pastas per the smarmy but likable barkeep's exhortations (we sat at the bar). To our delight, every dish was fairly exquisite, the octopus salad and mint love letters filled with lamb were especially notable. Expensive, but worth every penny.

My second time I relied on the trusty barkeep's wisdom once again, ordering mostly apps and pastas, but was severely disappointed. Dishes whose flavors had popped off the tongue on my first visit were either bland or pathetically exaggerated on my second. 

I'm still struggling to figure out what happened...did the restaurant just have a bad night? Doubt it -- kitchens can fuck up a dish or two on any given night, but not an entire meal amongst 4 diners. Did my fleeting Mario Batali man-crush cloud my judgment during my first visit? Maybe. As much as I love flowing red locks atop a greasy Italian belly wearing clogs (I don't), my taste buds have been through enough heartache to know not to be swindled by infatuation. Maybe I was too shell-shocked from all the silicone and awful dye-jobs to taste the food my first time. Most likely I got stuck with the backup chef my second time. But any restaurant worth its salt shouldn't vascillate that dramatically with its second stringer behind the pans. Cuz if that's the gamble I have to take when I walk through the door, I'm taking my shit elsewhere. 

So a measly 2 stars for your Vegas joint, Mario. Not Michelin stars, Yelp stars. Consistency matters.

p.s. it's also irritating as shit to walk into a half-empty dining room to be told that they're ""completely booked,"" and we'd have to sit at the bar while your gamboholic comps gum it up at the craps table, flanked by some plastic flusies. but that's vegas, and what's to be expected when dining on the strip. which is why i try to avoid it.",tEcUrOeTabyFkUxdGECAkQ,2,2,2,rYzeugPBCoWEQ18rpELeHA

Great service, food is exquisite and well presented.
Wow on every item we ordered on a table of four people (yes we shared). I have nothing bad to say as it was perfect. We had - fig salad, goat cheese ravioli, branzino, lamb special, tiramisu, vanilla cheesecake brule, and a flight of grappa. Wine was a nice barbaresco. 
Execution, presentation and see rice were 5 stars.

Glasses never went dry. I was with 4 other foodies accustomed to high end restaurants so he had his work cut out. He was knowledgable about the food preparation and made great recommendations. 

Bar and wine menu was great, no complaints there. 

The food- the grilled octopus is the best I have ever had! So tender!!!! We also had calamari, the truffle pasta (which had generous white truffle shavings done at the table) the orzo and a mushroom rigatoni. All were perfectly made and the sauces just perfect. We also had short rib (best ever) and veal chop. I can't remember the last time I had an Italian meal this good. 

This place is not ""American Italian"". The portions are not for contest eaters. Don't bother to come here if your idea of real Italian food is Olive Garden, or if you are more worried about quantity than quality. This place is not cheap but the quality of the food easily justifies the prices.

To start off, I was presented with a chickpea amusee, which tasted nice, but was kind of earthen in flavor and didn't really awaken the palate. 

I had the Beef Cheeks Ravioli to start. It was a decent dish, the beef cheeks and liver was tasty, and though I saw 2 mini slivers of truffle, I couldn't detect any of its perfume - they might as well not have been there. It was a little heavy but was over all a decent dish. Though in hind sight I should have ordered the tripe, the ravioli was nice but not exciting. The flavor profile was kind of monotoned throughout -- if only it had more umame, perhaps I was supposed to add on 5g of truffle at $15/g? 

I followed that with the Crispy polenta sweetbreads. Sounded nice on paper, but the polenta coating on the sweetbreads turned up hard and unappealing. The sweetbreads were well cooked though and were nice and moist, however, to my surprise, it was completely under seasoned. I don't mean that they didn't put enough salt, I think they forgot to salt it completely. I think the polenta coating might have a little bit of salt, either that or the salting was uneven. The mushrooms and sweetpotato (?I think?) puree was completely unseasoned. I wanted to ask for a bit of salt, but didn't want to seem like one of those annoying dicks that terrorize the wait staff at restaurants. 

For desert, I was recommended a mascapone based desert - it was made like a creme brulee, and was delicious. 

The service was good, perhaps even above average for las vegas.

So 3 stars because the chick peas amusee wasn't very amusing and the sweetbreads were under seasoned. Decent restaurant, but I wouldn't rave about it.",9xXg9BhqoCtTyu56nj7GmQ,0,0,3,Zf08kE36oWyj7OICv9uBrg

This was not my first visit to B&B.  It will definitely be my last.  My  companions and I loved this place when it first opened and had returned because we thought the chefs involved would ensure its consistent quality.  On the evening of May 24th, we ordered the prix fixe pasta lamb menu.  

The first dish, I can only compare perhaps to ramen noodles. Really?  This is what  a top chef has created?  Next up, lamb brains ravioli.  The ravioli was tasteless and chewy and we could not find any discernible filling.  Where did those lamb brains go? 

Then we had penne w/ lamb pancetta.  Salty, tough lamb with overcooked pasta.   Next up, pasta w/lamb sausage.   I couldn't even finish the three bites they gave me.  I have eaten and enjoyed lamb my whole life.  Mario Batali committed  a crime against lamb and humanity with that dish.     

 Now on top of the major disappointment in the food, just imagine that you are waiting 20-25 minutes between courses.  When I spoke to the waitress about the course timing she was defensive and insisted that this is their standard procedure.

On top of a lousy meal now I have a waitress who wants to fight.  And believe me, I don't want to fight with a waitress.  I know what's at stake here.  This is an investment.    I really want this evening to work. So I told her all I want to do is try to salvage what is left of this $600 spaghetti evening, and one way to do that is to try get some food out here before the whole table falls asleep.  

By the time dessert arrived everyone at the table was numb.   Over two hours had passed since we sat down.   Oh, I think I found the missing ravioli lamb brains.  The lamb brains were between my ears for paying $600 for the worst tasting meal and the worst service in Las Vegas. 

What is promised to be one of the finest dining experiences in fact goes down as the worst dining experience ever.  

Apparently we weren't alone in that thought as the  table of Italian Americans sitting next to us were equally as unsatisfied it seems and ranted about all their pasta dishes. 

What a shame that these celebrity chefs like Mario Batali draw us in and leave without ensuring their product is worthy of the hype and cost.

We can assume the following.  Either Batali sucks as a chef. Or Batali has abandoned this restaurant and it just carries his name.  Either way, you are a chump for giving in to the hype of this place.  I'll never dine at a Batali restaurant again.

I spoke to the manager before I left.  Don't think he gave a crap one way or the other.  He said he was sorry.  Me too.

So you are in Vegas and you're thinking okay this is going to be amazing considering his reputation. I was set on trying there Gnocchi, it was such a waste of 30 dollars. I mean there was about 15 gnocchi on the dish in a sauce with no flavor supposed to be a butter sauce but that was flavorless. It had beans and the beans were good it just didnt go with the gnocchi. They gave me one slice of bread with my meal and one complimentary small bruschetta that was bland and had a bunch of cold chickpeas on top. I mean the gnocchi had beans and  ham hock it was just so wrong. The ""Ham Hock"" was chewy and rough, and tasted like a chorizo gone wrong!

We just had a little time for dinner before a show, and the concierge suggested this place since we had no reservations. It was horridly overpriced, and the food mediocre at best. 

The service was, however, outstanding...sorta. They brought a piece of bread before the meal, and never offered another, until we chased the server down and asked. Not cool.

We split the grilled octopus appetizer. The octopus was cooked perfectly, but sauced with an extremely strong balsamic glaze that completely obscured the flavor of the fish. We both ordered the short rib with polenta dinners. The meat was overcooked to the point that it became mush as soon as we started to chew it. The polenta was excellent...both tablespoons of it. The ""dinner"" portion would have been an appetizer anywhere else. This meal was thoroughly disappointing, especially at $36 a pop.

The wine, at $22 a glass, was no better than the wine they bring for free if you just stick a dollar bill in the penny slots.

2178515,2015-06-28,0,GTR39A2jwNIS_NV8q2r_JA,"Restaurant Week Dinner menu 2015 review. 

The Skinny: delicious pastas,  subpar secondi(3.5) service: very attentive (4) value: expensive for the level of cuisine (3).

I wanted to try B&B's 4 course restaurant week tasting menu for $50 which is a great deal considering what they normally charge to eat here. 

They started us off with an amuse bouche of chickpeas/cumin/basil bruschetta.  This wasn't anything to write home about (a little bland) and the way it was served made it difficult to eat with all the chickpeas falling off the croustini. 

A wonderful crusty loaf with EVOO and balsamic was provided for their bread service. It wasn't warm but the crunch/perfectly dense texture of the bread hit the spot and we both consumed two thick slices each by the end of the evening. 

We both got the salad course which was a mixture of field green served with some parmesan cheese. This was an okay dish for me.  The salad was overly dressed and slightly wilting from the dressing. 

The primi dishes offered were the pork trotter ravioli with cherry tomatoes and the garganelli with summer squash. Both pasta dishes were exquisite in terms of flavor and execution. The ravioli filling tasted like a porky bone marrow and the tomatoes provide just that right amount of sweetness and acidity to cut through the richness. The garganelli was a surprisingly simplistic dish which highlighted the freshness of the ingredients and also executed extremely well. 

We chose the pork loin with wax beans/arugula/fennel and the short rib with polenta. 

The pork loin dish was more of a riff on a lighter version of a bacon and bean dish. The issues I had with the dish were largely the uneven seasoning of the dish itself. The various beans and mildly smokey pork loin were a bit heavy on the salt. The sauce underneath the dish was great and mellowed it out somewhat. Arugula and fennel added a bit of lightness to an otherwise heavier dish. The portion size on the pork loin was small (two very thin slices) for a secondi. 

Short rib with polenta was a disappointment. The short rib was quite tender but was surprisingly bland. The polenta texture was a bit thin while the vegetables (large celery flavored) were rather one note. Portion size was okay but the taste overall just wasn't there. Pass on this dish. 

Dessert was a nice light gelati. The blackberry was stellar while the chocolate was only okay for me as it had a mild grainy texture to it. 

Overall, I would highly recommend the pasta and completely skip the entrées and appetizers. Given the experience I had,  the food gets a 3.5 only because of the delicious pasta dishes. The other courses left me feeling unimpressed. When you factor in cost, this joint leaves me ambivalent about returning as there are other better high end Italian restaurants in the city that provide more bang for your buck.

For the entree, I ordered the black spaghetti with Njuda and sicilian pesto (the waiter had told me that it was spicy, but this spaghetti was REALLY spicy).  It was so spicy that my mouth was on fire and it completely took away from the rest of the dish which was pretty tasty, I think.

Our meal started off nicely. Service was fine (if a little too chummy/chatty for my personal taste). The amuse bouche of chickpea bruschetta was well seasoned and tasty enough. And our appetizer of grilled octopus really was delicious -- best thing we ate here by far.

Then it all went downhill with the entrees. When we were ordering, we were warned by our server that the black spaghetti was very salty and to reconsider ordering it if we weren't into that. When we asked if it was possible to make it less salty, he said no. That's fine, I can understand chefs not wanting to change their dishes and cater to their diners' whims. So we ordered other things, figuring better safe than sorry...

Holy salt lick, Batman! Every single one of our 5 entrees (spaghetti with garlic and lobster, orecchiette, bucatini all'Amatriciana, bone marrow ravioli, and lamb chops) was oversalted, ranging from that's-pretty-salty to almost inedible. So I can't even begin to imagine how salty the black spaghetti would've been...

Living in NYC, we get to eat a lot of amazing Italian, from homey and rustic to modern and upscale. So we had prepared ourselves to eat mediocre yet pricey Italian in Vegas, but this failed to meet even our very low expectations. Don't know how there can be so many good reviews of this place -- maybe they're more attentive with the tasting menus (which they did try hard to sell us on, but we just weren't that hungry).

- Warm ricotta crespelle: excellent dessert, to die for!

Waited at the bar for 20 minutes with NO service.  Not even an offer for a glass of water.  

Was finally seated in the small dining room...so small that the tables were so close no one could walk near my chair without bumping my it....every...single...time!!  Service was good at our table, wanted for nothing and never had to ask for anything.  The menu is extremely hard to understand with almost no vegetarian selections.  I had to ask the server for an explanation of each item I considered ordering.  

Appetizer - Ordered a salad for an appetizer.  Appetizer my tail, there may have been a tablespoon of greens on the plate with a few mushrooms and at $15 or so, can I say ridiculous?!  

Entree - After much debate over what to eat since I try to stay vegetarian unless the options are limited, I decided on Spaghettini with Lobster.  Received a 6 oz serving, with the lobster already diced and included with pasta.  The pasta was extremely under cooked and the flavor was poor at best.  I've had better pasta sauce by opening a jar of Ragu from the grocery store!!  For the most part the lobster was rubbery, except for the occasional undercooked pieces.  This is no doubt why I'm sitting in bed feeling disgusting right now!  A friend ordered the Ravioli - the look of disappointment on his face with the plate arrived was priceless.  Took John only 3 minutes to finish his serving.  

Dessert - I'm sorry, maybe I'm too Texan, but dessert should be sweets...not cheeses.  But with that said, we ordered the cheeses and coffee.  I have to admit some of the selections were very good, but the coffee was thick and gross!

Wine - They were out of the first selection, but the second selection was nice - a Pinot Noir - don't remember what selection, but it was nice.

2217146,2014-12-17,0,GTR39A2jwNIS_NV8q2r_JA,"Holy balls this was some good stinkin' pasta.  We ordered the ""Mario's Classic Tasting Menu"" on a recent trip.  You know that story about the human body being incapable of drinking an entire gallon of whole milk in an hour?  I'm fairly certain that if you replace ""whole milk"" with ""pasta"" then this tasting menu falls a fraction of an inch below that quantity.

I only remember a few dishes but they were all spectacular.  One had crispy turnips and fried guanciale.  One was beef cheek ravioli.  There was a goat cheese tortellini and there was something with duck liver and black truffle.  Oh the black truffle.  Even the pre-dessert was a pasta course.  Yes, you read that right; the dessert before the dessert.

Everything was wonderful.  Some dishes were better than others but when each course features handmade pasta you can't really go wrong.  All in all it was a fantastic tasting menu that you should definitely try.

Also, the chocolate budino is a must have.  Seriously.  If you think of a rain cloud that is just about to burst and make that all made out of chocolate, that's the budino.  It's a fluffy creamy light chocolate flavor that is drenched with a dark chocolate ganache.  You wonder how you can possibly eat another bite when it's placed in front of you.  And then you wonder how you finished it all.

On top of the delightful food the service was impeccable.  Plates are set down and removed in unison.  Server was super friendly and knowledgeable.  Attentive, of course.  Just a really great dining experience overall.  Obviously the price point is high since it's a celebrity chef restaurant on the strip.

Pacing of the courses were very disjointed but service otherwise was very good. They tried to be as attentive as possible. 

One of our party ordered lamb medium rare and it came out medium well which left him waiting for his entree well after we were finished eating. In  the meantime they brought out multiple ""we're sorry about that"" small dishes to him, but in the end it was a disruptive gaffe. 

Other dishes were equally underwhelming coming out bland and uninspiring. 

I would highly recommend two dishes if you end up here though. One being the grilled octopus. Large portion, perfectly cooked and worth every penny. The other, the bucatini dish was a great plate of pasta. 

In the end I feel that B&B is priced well above it's value. I feel that having  Mario Batali's name attached to it draws more stars than the end result. That being said, it wasn't awful either.

3) We literally had 7 minutes to scarf down our food & leave for the show
4) My husband and I were left to RUN to the Bellagio to catch the show. Literally made it into the doors before they locked us out. (yes, running in slacks in heels -even though we took a taxi for the main portion of the drive)
THIS ONE HUMORS ME THE MOST:
5) The restaurant claimed to comp my friend's wine (the one that hit his tooth on a stray bone in his meal) however, the restaurant ended up putting the ""COMPED"" wine on my husband's tab. However, we did not catch this mistake until we left since we were in such a rush to make it to the show. Tackiest move to say the least.

I thought the whole experience was not worth a cent that we paid. It was infuriating.

UPDATE:
I also emailed the manager about the situation upon my return from vacation. His response was sent within 10 hours of my email. I was very impressed with his quick response and apologies for the experience. I have changed my star-rating to compensate for the professional way he handled the situation. He assured me that they train the staff to be mindful of guests' allergies or time schedules for shows and other events.

While I cannot recommend the actual restaurant, should you accidentally visit B&B Ristorante in Las Vegas, you really MUST try the amazing Veltia hand-drying machine in the bathroom. 

To say I was disappointed with the food is like saying you were disappointed when you walked in on your mom and me trying to conceive your new baby sister (surprise!). Yes, the emotions under discussion are roughly analogous, but they're not really comparable. In my historic review of Lupa I said Mr. Batali was a wizard because that restaurant and Babbo, two of Batali's New York joints, are made not of brick and mortar but of the Platonic ideal of Italian restaurants coalesced into tangible shape and form. Considering how much I love those places I had to find a way to reconcile the crappy impression left on me by B&B. And I did. Here's my theory:

In 2006 a disgraced, leprous chef approached Mario Batali after spiking the chubby ginger Gandalf's drink and  stabbing him with a heroin syringe. 

""Mr. Batali, I have a business proposition for you,"" our villain said as the drugs raced through Batali's veins. 

""I'm one with the universe! Time has no meaning!"" Batali said. Special note for kids: intravenous drugs act with almost instantaneous speed. You're welcome. 

Sensing an opportunity, the asshole wannabe chef said, ""This is the Lord, Mr. Batali, and I have a business proposition.""

""Give unto God what is God's, unto Caesar what is Caesar's! What would you have me do, Lord, on this my road to Damascus!"" 

Heroin. What a drug.

The antagonist continued, ""I want to make a restaurant with mediocre food, but it's prepared elaborately and attached to an exorbitant fee, so people won't know any better!""

""Lord, I made Otto and Lupa and Babbo,"" Batali said. ""My 'strants kick ass as a rule, I really wouldn't feel comfortable--""

""THOU WILT DO AS THY GOD COMMANDS!"" said the son of a bitch. 

And so B&B Ristorante was born, the child of blasphemy and lies. I had no way of knowing this when I walked into that den of woe one fateful Sunday night. 

""Lasciate ogne speranza, voi ch'intrate,"" the waitress said as we took our seats. 

There would be no debate over the menu. I looked my different tasting menu options and ordered the ""regional"" list with the attached wine pairing in order to have the widest range of savory experiences.

The first layer of our meal was the Georgia White Shrimp Spiedino. Shrimp arrive on wooden skewers over a mat of veggies. The shrimp was tasty but laden with salt. The texture was ideal, and I liked that the arthropodic flesh had a flavor that subtly changed as it passed over the palate. Still, too salty is too salty.

The Cavatelli with Rabbit all'Ischitana tasted like store bought pasta with shredded chicken. Boring. Ditto the Maccarona with Ragu Napolitana. Things were getting ominous. Then the entertainment arrived when the Braciole del Portinaio with Eggplant ""Marinara"" numbed the mouths of two of our party members. Right. Just so you know the reason ""marinara"" is in quotes is because they make it with lidocaine (not a traditional ingredient in a marinara). At least the mad harlequin calling the shots in the kitchen was consistent: the braciole was way too salty. 

I don't remember the Calcagno a Crosta Liscia, so I guess it was made of yawns. The calcagno was followed by a micro serving of Chocolate Salumi with House Canned Apricots. I really liked the apricot bit. I scarfed it down and lamented that it had been served with hard cheese and adorable apple slices. No matter how cute your apple slices are, if any part of my meal resembles something my mom would put in my lunchbox as a six-year-old, you need to return to the kitchen and a.) light yourself on fire, Buddhist monk style b.) apologize to me and c.) revise your menu. Not necessarily in that order. 

I want to take time out of my black fuming to mention the wine that was served with the Salumi. The Cascina Ca'Rossa ""Birbet"" was a delight thing to consume . I think one of my dinner mates said it best: ""If I met a girl and she smelled like this I would marry her."" 

Apparently the B&B staff heard my request for an apology because the next bit, the Honey Semifreddo with Huckleberries was a dessert masterpiece. No word on whether there's a smoldering corpse in the kitchen, but it was a noble attempt at an apology. The Semifreddo had a delicate sweetness that perfectly matched the tartness of the huckleberries adorning it.

N.b. the above passages are not all negative. This meal had high points, and besides the braciole none of my food was bad so much as mediocre. Fuck that noise. When I drop two bills the dead better walk and Amaterasu herself better serve my meal. Between the price and the attachment of Mario Batali's name there is no excuse for the meal I ate at B&B Ristorante.",niNmcMMNdxEIhsBLntigsg,3,3,2,KIwLqLsKGx8rAU9qI9Ifvw

I had the pasta with lobster and found the dish to be a bit greasy and lobster undercooked.  The wines by the glass were limited and quite expensive, even with paying a Las Vega premium.  What really ruined the evening was the whole doggy bag situation. Rather than just wrapping our food, they wrap it then give you a ticket so you can pick it up at the hostess stand.  We ended up with three bags.  I took my ticket and retrieved the bags. I then went back to the bar to retrieve my dining companion.   Out of nowhere a suited man comes after me as said ""ma'am, I need to see your ticket.""  I told him I didn't have a ticket because I gave it to the hostess.  He then asked to look in my bags.  I asked if he was accusing me of stealing doggie bags and noted that if I were doing so why would I come back into the restaurant.  I never got a real apology.  Just an explanation that 3 doggie bags was unusual (as though I packed them!).  I suggested that it might be nice to give us a free dessert or knock a glass of wine off the bill.  They didn't see the point. The whole think was ridiculous and put a damper on the evening. Over a doggie bag!! We spent a lot of money at B&B.  I didn't expect to be treated like that.

Further, the wait service at B&B was impeccable.  Our server was charming, fun and attentive and made brilliant suggestions, which we all adopted.

Removing one star because the sommelier wasn't stunning (conversely, the wine director at Babbo, Peter Jamros, is) and the runners and busboys were really lousy.

I expected more people there because it's a Mario Batali/Joe Bastianich restaurant, and we were in Vegas, and so I made reservations. Turns out, they were completely unnecessary.

First thing that came to our table: chickpea bruchetta.
This was amazeballs. It was so good. Seasoned and perfectly cooked chickpeas with basil on toasted bread. I was surprised at how good it was because I'm usually not a fan of chickpeas. 

I got the lamb and rapini (broccoli rabe) oricchette. I found it to be a little salty, but nothing I couldn't overcome. Of course I took the ""chef recommendations"" and added whatever they told me to. 

For dessert, I got the lemon budino. It's basically a lemon souffle, for anyone who doesn't know what a budino is. I had to google it before I ordered. I didn't think it was very good.. It was too tart for me, and the honey didn't really help. Maybe I was already overstuffed from all the deliciousness that I had been eating previously. Dessert also came with a complementary nine bites. Unfortunately, due to my chocolate allergy, half of them were inedible, and the other half I assumed were contaminated by just being in the same bowl or storage unit as all the others. 

Even though dessert seemed disappointing, I'm not deducting a star. Why? Because the service was completely amazing. Everyone working was so helpful, so kind, and so attentive. My fiance dropped his napkin on the floor while heading to the bathroom, and by the time he came back it was replaced. We ordered a bottle of wine, and the sommelier was very knowledgeable about the wine we got, and attentive enough to notice that we weren't there to spend more than $50 on a bottle. I've tried to find the wine we got there, just to have in our wine rack as a commemorative bottle or two, but unfortunately I've been unable to find it at our local Specs. 

The next time I'm in Vegas, I'll either make it a point to come to this restaurant again, or at least show up to a different B&B restaurant. Such as Carnevino.

The one star is for a great sommelier who was able to recommend a great wine by the glass each time.
The first time we went for dinner we ordered the friti mixto which came out a bit salty. I pointed this out to the waiter and was told that ""we don't use salt so its impossible for it to be salty""..well it was and I had to insist that he taste it for him to take it back and come back and apologize and replace it.  The pasta dish my wife ordered was surprisingly too al dente and my dish was overcooked. We had ordered a side of roasted butternut squash which came out with slices of squash that had been boiled.  At that point we skipped dessert. 

Of course not willing to give up on this place, gave this a shot two years ago and again a few days ago.  I don't know what's up with this place but the service has been very bad with the waiters having a very laissez faire attitude towards everything.  On the last visit the appetizers were very slow coming out (did have a fabulous rose) and were not really up to par.  The octopus was a quite chewy (not what you expect from a Batali-Bastianich branded enterprise) and a rabbit confit was quite unremarkable.  I ordered the pork chop and was told it would be prepared med. rare.  I wanted it more medium ...which again led to an argument with the waiter (argument is too strong a word..but he did say that it was better to which I pointed out that a skilled chef ought to to able to cook this even through and yet leave it juicy...which is what I have actually had in Italy!)  This chop which was quite an expensive cut of pork came out quite dry though the mostarda went quite a long way and given the paucity of time, I tried my best to choke down as much as possible, skipped dessert and went out to the cheap noodle place for a roast pork dish which was 1/5th the price and much better IMHO.

For me, this place is a total avoid.  Its kinda funny to see Mr. Bastianich on MasterChef with a purile expression on his face throwing away food from home cooks when a branded restaurant cant do better than a home cook.

All the food was top notch & fresh truffle was shaved at the table for the majority of the plates.

The atmosphere is relaxed, and I never ever feel rushed. The waiters take their time to explain the nuances in the menu, and also to explain Chef Batali's philoshophy on different menu items.

The bellinis are absolutely to die for. The peach nectar is alwasy at the peak of freshness, and I honestly have never had a better bellini. Anywhere.

We always get a bottle of Kerner, and start with a few pastas. My absolute favorite in the papardelle bolognese. Everything is made from scratch, and the bolognese is creamy and rich without feeling too heavy. The mint love letters and black spaghetti are two of their best sellers, and neither will disappoint.

The last time I was here, I branched out and tried the quail. The mascarpone polenta was out-of-this world, and our waiter did not let me down when he raved about this dish. I love the branzino; it's always an excellent choice, and my friend raves about all of the beef dishes, especially the short ribs. I have never had a sub-par here. Never.

The thing I love about Vegas is that sub-par restaurants simply don't make it (in general). There are so many food options, and the competition in such a small radius makes it quite difficult for mediocre restuarants to be successful.

We're generally too stuffed at this point to do dessert, but I'm sure the desserts are fabulous as well. Now I am craving B&B for my next trip to Vegas! I should look at flights right now.",xsZ4s7a4MaBIh48MdMkkPw,0,0,5,EhuCLwaqiSdLPurkKmAffg

After my horrible experience at their New York restaurant, I had no intentions of ever patronizing another one of their restaurants again. However, the wife really wanted to give them a second chance and asked me to accompany her to their Las Vegas restaurant.

I agree with a lot of the other negative reviews below. The food at B&B is way too salty. I had their lamb's tongue which was so salty it took three pieces of bread in order for me to finish the appetizer. Oh and could it have killed them to serve the bread warm like all the other fine dining restaurants, instead of the semi stale cold bread they had?

Then, I had the squid ink pasta. Again, and as other reviewers have commented too, it was extremely salty. Also nowhere on the menu did it say it was going to spicey. It was so hot that I was only able to finish half the plate with 2 cups of ice water, and sent the rest back to the kitchen.

Finally, I had the rabbit. It was overcooked and dry. And surprisingly, it was bland, contrary to the previous two dishes! It came with 5 medallions of meat, but after the first 2, it was unbearable and I sent the rest back. I rather waste the money than have any more of their food go into my mouth.

I don't know what's going on with their kitchen but the food here is generally very salty, and inconsistent and not worth the $200 I spent. I wouldn't pay $20 for the food they served.

Their only redeeming factor was the excellent service and ambiance, in contrast to their restaurant Babbo in New York. However, when I go to a restaurant, the first and foremost importance is the taste of the food. If that fails, nothing else really matters.

I do not recommend this restaurant, nor do I recommend any restaurants of Batali & Bastianich after my horrible experiences at their restaurants in different states at different times of the year.",zQdauCqKiAj3sW2GwBf25w,2,0,1,RlPVuXLpJYYoqi_hKZ8H1A

It often has mixed reviews too. Burnt food, over salty food. I just never had a bad meal and thought maybe those that revied it might have been too picky. That was until I ate there on Friday. Some of the food was so bad we did not eat it. My favorite dish has been the Gnocchi since my first time at B&B. This time it was so salty you could not finish eating it. The mint love letters where also gross this time around. Nothing like my past visits. Even the bread was different and served cold. There was five of us. Our server talked down to us like we where stupid morons. I had asked if we could eat our pasta family style so we could all share. We had orded 5 pasta dishes. Mario has always said food is to be sharred. Even the article about B&B on the Venetians site talks about passing plates. Our server would not give us extra plates or a serving spoon so we could all have a taste. I guess the Los Angles Times people are morons too and they should take that article off the site. I was embarrased that I recomended the restaurant. What pisses me off the most is we were forced to tip for rude bad service. I normal always tip everyone and more than 20% but he made the whole night ruined. I never knew 5 was a big party that forced a tip. Maybe that is why he did not care if we had good service or not.

2465519,2008-03-09,0,GTR39A2jwNIS_NV8q2r_JA,"Mario Batali's B&B Ristorante was exactly what I expected for this Northern Italian style cuisine.  His off the wall food parings and usage of offals and uncommon ingredients are a pleasant surprise from the everyday fair of chicken breast pasta or linguini and clams.
  You must be a true foodie to really enjoy the techniques and matchings that Batali uses in his dishes. 
  We ordered the Warm Tripe A'la Parmegana, Baby Octopus with Lemonchillo vinaigrette, Rabbit with leeks and brussel sprouts, Beef Cheek Ravioli with black truffles and crused duck liver, and the mint love lamb ravioli (strange name).
   Warm Tripe was probably the best tripe that i have every had.  It was in a nicely spiced tomato sauce with a parmesan cheese gratan and served with two rustic pieces of country style bread.  The tripe melted in my  mouth and had no gamey or off taste at all.  The bread was burnt.... :( 
   The Baby Octopus was also a great dish.  The octopus had a lovely smooth texture very similar to squid.  We could really taste the nice grilled flavor on the octopus.  The lemonchillo vinagrette added a nice tangy zip to the dish and left your mouth with a very clean feel.    
   Beef Cheek Ravioli with black truffle and crushed duck liver sauce was a very rich dish.  Definately get this dish as a share item for the table even.  A ture foodies will really appreciate this dish.  The ultra smooth texture of the beef cheeks with a very meaty flavor held up beautifully with the very rich sauce.  The sauce was like eatting foie gras black truffle pate, thinned with a bit of cream and pasted all over the ravioli.  Very decadent.  The only down fall with this dish, and i think with all of his pasta dishes, is that there is no throught of platting this dish nicely.  It look as if the chefs went from pan to plate.  NO ARRANGEMENT what so ever in any of the pasta dishes I saw....but then again that could be Batali's thing, purposly not plating pastas to make them look rustic...
   Rabbit with leeks and Brussel sprouts.  Rabbit was cooked perfectly maintaining all of its moisture through out the loin and the leg meat.  This was a very simple dish but done excellently.  I wish there was more brussel sprouts though...i love them.
   OK...the mint love lamb ravioli...again presentation sucked.  Flavors were a very interesting play on lamb with mint jelly.  I thought that the mint was a bit overpowering for the dish but the lamb flavor really did hold its own.  

   Atmosphere was very bistro-ish...with a fell of Japaneses accents.  Dark wooded frames/boxes, bottles and bottles of wine line the walls and the bar.  Dress was very casual, some very nicely dressed...some in shorts...hey, its vegas.

   Service was very pleasant, but over the top.  We had our server, a bread server, a water server.  New silverware came with every course and I loved the cool little wooden box that they carried the silverware in.  Our water glasses were never empty.   Our server connected with our table very well and was very personable to us.  None of that stuffiness you might expect going into a nicer restaurant.   
  
  We had to skip dessert to see a show but overall this restaurant was what I expected from Mario Batali.   You really must understand the type of cuisine that Mario Batali likes to cook in order to truly enjoy this restaurant.

   If your more into a meat a potatoes place, try Mario Batali's Carnevino in the new Palazzo Hotel.",xs4s455bWJDegXUFJY6ZwQ,1,1,4,Co1iAbX60s9-Aeu5X9PZ1w
2466886,2007-05-03,0,GTR39A2jwNIS_NV8q2r_JA,"My first experience eat at a Mario Batali restaurant. I was so excited.  As my friend and I were rushing to the restaurant in the Venetian, we were star struck, as we saw Heather Lockler walking behind us. But to the more important things, as we rushed around the Venetian, we couldn't find the restaurant.   Note to all, it is all the down the restaurant row, past the Blue Man theater ticket office.

After we got seated, our waiter was very helpful in explaining the dishes and how they are prepared.  Reviewing the menu online, which is actually has the same items from the Babbo restaurant, I knew what I wanted to order.   

First up came the ""Warm Lamb's Tongue Vinaigrette with Chanterelles and a 3-Minute Egg"" and ""Grilled Octopus"".  Both appetizers were very good.  The lambs tongue has a texture like beef, so it was nice and firm. The octopus was just darn good.

Next came the ""Beef Cheek Ravioli with Black Truffles and Crushed Duck Liver""  and ""Spaghettini with Spicy Budding Chives, Sweet Garlic and a One Pound Lobster"".  I like the spaghettinie over the beef cheek ravioli, due to the spicy sauce.  The beef cheek ravioli was to rich and buttery for me.

This was followed by the ""Fennel Dusted Sweetbreads with Sweet and Sour Onions, Duck Bacon"" and ""Veal Chop with Sauteed Porcini and Braised Escarole"".   As it was my first time eating sweetbreads, which are not brains but the thymus glands, it was tasty. Coated with the fennel mixture it is deep fried, tasting almost like a chicken nugget. The veal was tasty but on the well side, as it was supposed to be medium rare. 

The wine list is extensive and quite pricey, more than what I would have expected for the restaurant.

Overall, it was a great evening. As the restaurant opened 2 weeks ago, services was a little disorganized.  Hopefully they get the bugs out.",__05rytNjsye9MBhqB0DMA,1,1,4,hDo7562ZQDBaBnadSJdCyg

We had a private room off to the side of the bar and a couple of staff members dedicated to our group.  Consequently we got pretty good service during the course of the evening.

the space was a little tight for mixing around during the cocktail hour.  However once we sat down, that's when the magic started.

After making some selections, the following food showed up on my plate.
course 1 - lightly breaded calamari - a little salty, but I still scarfed it down and it tasted great
course 2 - 3 pieces of ravioli.  I know this is a meal Battali used to grow his reputation, but I wasn't too excited by it.
course 3 - roasted beef rib.  This was slow roasted for 5 hours and was cooked to perfection.  Any time meat melts in your mouth it is pure heaven.  
course 4 - raspberry sorbet it was yummy and helped end off the meal on a positive note.

(see below.)  but comments about the flavoring of the dishes i pay attention to.  that's why i was shocked at all the comments about how salty the food was.  perhaps the restaurant took note and changed things up; perhaps those reviewers have a phobia of flavor.  who knows bc our experience was phenomenal and only solidified our fanboy/girl status for the heavyset, croc wearin italian.

service was perfect.  our server was enthusiastic, extremely knowledgeable, and attentive, albeit his moustache was a little creepy.  i tried the beef cheek ravioli w/ truffle and duck liver.  delish.  uber rich w/ its velvety meat filling w/ a hint of mineral-y liver goodness.  YUM.

my wife had the bolognese.  she loved it.  i loved it.  it was freaking tasty.  the flavor was delicate, simple and complex at the same time.  the base tomato sauce tasted very close to the ox tail pasta dish at osteria, which was both adore.

i then tried the pork belly.  it was served w/ arugula, heirloom tomatoes, and drizzled w/ that famous 20something year old balsamic.  i was blown away.  the generously sized log-o-meat was fatty, moist, and robust in porky goodness.  highly recommended.  the hints of that sweet and tangy balsamic, the bitter arugula, and juicy sweet warm tomato slices on the bottom, perfectly balanced out the richness of the belly.

we finished the meal off w/ some gelati and sorbetto.  espresso, peach and strawberry.  gawddamn!  probably the best we've ever had.  we were also served an amuse bouche (chickpea bruschetta) at the beginning of the meal and an additional dessert medley at the end, complimentary.  the perfect meal!",UaSBdxaE7TzKxfv6f5AUHA,1,1,5,ngzcfBa6UUiiP5V40VDCvw

The gnocchi with lamb ragu and mint is okay but the evenly ribbed texture alerts me to this being a packaged gnocchi versus one made fresh.  It's been my experience that when you see one with a smooth texture it looks and tastes like it was made by someone's hand and when you see the even ribbed texture it looks and tastes like it was made by a machine.  

Bella has the gnocchi with escarole, prosciutto cotto and smoked ricotta which she said was ""very Chinese"" in the way it was prepared.  The grilled brussel sprouts with Lardo and lemon and Di Cecco broccoli with peperoncino and garlic sides were solid.

My wife and I decided to spend our anniversary night here and we were not disappointed!  How this restaurant has an average Yelp rating is a mystery to me as this eatery has been always consistent in quality and service.

Although there were two different tasting menus, we decided to go a la carte.  We each opened with one of their outstanding signature cocktails (Blood Orange Cosmo for my wife and a Roman Bullet for myself).  They provided a mini warm chickpea bruschetta compliments of the chef as we dug into the menu.

Antipasti:  Grilled octopus (always so good with a vinaigrette that perfectly compliments the soft octopus and beans); Pork Tenderloin Terrine (nicely executed pate complimented with crostini and a fennel and blackberry salad.

Primi:  Cacio e Pepe (simple, Parmesan-y, and peppery deliciousness!);  Garganelli (the mushrooms were soft and the rabbit confit elevated this pasta dish).  Both pasta dishes were perfectly al dente.

Secondi:  We ordered the Ribeye for two and this was the highlight!  Cooked to a medium temp and the outside was charred to perfection.  The flavor of this meat was beyond words and each bite simply melted away in our mouths.  Couldn't even finish it as it was a huge portion.  Didn't help that we stuffed our ourselves on the previous courses, no doubt!

Dolce:  Yes, we managed to save room for dessert and what a way to finish with the Caramel Bonet and Strawberry and Rhubarb Crostata.  Admittedly, we were gluttons this evening!

Brilliant and attentive service throughout the meal and we never found ourselves wanting for anything (thank you Kelly and staff!).

I chose the restaurant because it was my friend's birthday, Mario Batali is one of her favorite chef's and I wanted her day to be special. Yes, I know he's not there but he picked the chef so it's almost the same as having Mario make the meal.

I have to say the service is impeccable and you're definitely made to feel special during your dining experience, which stands to reason based on the prices, good thing nothing's  to good for my BFF.

Once seated, our server came over immediately and welcomed us. We were given time to look at the menu after our drink order.

Omg, can I say the Blood Orange Cosmo 
I've seen Mario mix on the chew and my drink of choice for the evening was the best Cosmo I've had to date.

The bread was good and the olive oil & balsamic vinegar mixture made it so much better.

We had to try the pasta while here because not doing so would've been a crime. We ordered the Paglia e Fieno and I have to say, having spent 3 weeks in Italy and indulging in the finest pasta, this dish brought me back to Italy, it was exceptional, we enjoyed every glorious bite.

Now for our main course we ordered the B&B Dry Aged Ribeye for Two with Roasted Potatoes, it took 45 minutes to cook and while it was tasty, in my opinion, it should've been much more tender and easier to chew. The olive oil & balsamic vinegar gave the steak that extra special touch that made it really good.

The potatoes & zucchini were good too, definitely a meal to remember.

I'm happy my friend finally used the word delicious instead of ok when saying how she enjoyed her meal.

If you have $300 to spare, try B & B, I'm sure you'll enjoy the experience too!

The ambiance of the restaurant was a bit more bistro-like than restaurant-like, which was fine with me but I did find it a bit surprising.  I will say that really liked the cute little wine room in the back which housed their large selection of wine!

I was pleased with the service -- our server and her apprentice really dealt with our slightly inebriated group & random, border-line obnoxious questions well.  We definitely had a playful banter sort of relationship going on with our servers, which made the experience a bit less formal (which I liked).  For those of you that would prefer a more formal experience, our's may have been that way due to the fact that our group was all in our mid-twenties :o)  Other than that, our water glasses were never more than half empty and the man who passed out the bread deserves extra props for dealing with our group :o)

All of the food that I tried was delicious!  I ordered the Beef Cheek Ravioli with Black Truffles & Duck Liver which was A-MAZING.  I would definitely order it again.  The pasta was perfectly al dente with a nice bite & flavor to it.  I also had the Brasato al Barolo which was extremely tender and flavorful -- just thinking about it makes my mouth water!  I tried a bite of the Lamb's tongue antipasti, which was an interesting bite to say the least.  The Stinging Nettle Pappardelle tasted fantastic as well, and if I ever return to B&B I would definitely order that dish!

While in Vegas two years ago I saw that Mario was moving west and breaking ground in the Ventican and was skeptical and excited.  See my other reviews on what I think about his NYC places.

Have an agency who wants to buy me a meal, so I said how about that while walking by.   Let me start by saying, it does not equal Babbo or Lupa in NYC, but everything we had was really, really good.  

Some of the items
A N T I P A S T I:
The Three Goat Cheese Truffles were good, but not overwhelming.  The Octopus with soy ginger was perfectly cooked.
A pork trotter pancake thing - yum!  Fatty meat rolled in panko, smashed flat and fried.

Primi:
Everyone's favorite pasta was the one I ordered - Stinging Nettle Pappardelle with Wild Boar Ragu. I have been wanting to make a stinging nettle pasta (we see it often in the spring where we go mushroom hunting) and am even more inspired now.  It has such a nice, light, but complex vegetal flavor.  And boar - need I say more pig lovers.

Secondi:
There was a quail honey roast that was insane. Absolutely hands down one of the best pieces of white bird meat I have put in my mouth. 
I decided to go a bit crazy as I was not paying for dinner and ordered - Fennel Dusted Sweetbreads with Sweet and Sour Onions, Duck Bacon and Membrillo Vinegar.  It was amazing!  They were like the lightest, sweetest chicken-like nuggets with sweet ducky back - WOW!  I want more thinking about it.

Wine:
I like how they offer Quartinos - .25 of a liter - of wine - basically 1.5 glasses. We were able to order a variety of these to try amongst the 5 of us which was fun to contrast with the bottles of wine we also consumed.  Which lead us back to my new love -  the General Mgr - Lori.  She came by to check on us and we started talking about food and wine at the beginning of the meal and she was able to make some great pairing recommendations based on her past life as a Som in NYC.  Very, very friendly and a total foodie.  We ended up shutting the place down because she kept recommending different course and wines to try.  None of us wanted to leave.

They had a chef's menu and pasta menu for the night with pairings, but I am sure it would not have come close to just letting Lori offer some suggestions.

Just make it easy on yourself in this Mario does desert living place and ask for Lori to make food and wine recommendations.

Side note - she actually joined us for a drink the next night to talk more food and wine.",nsnFc5dcAVliG3X1yS5Mdw,1,2,4,Ev6Am5gDNCVK1sRcCCGI1g

Service was very fancy.  Everyone talks and serves in a professional, polite way.  But the service was a little too slow for my liking and had to ask for things multiple times before either getting it or just giving up.

As for food, it was good, but nothing spectacular.

Must-have:
- fried apple crisps: yum!  good texture and flavor! 
- Pappardelle Bolognese: good flavor

Good to try:
- crispy pork trotter: fine
- lobster spaghettini: good flavor but not enough sauce or ingredients.  a little too al dente for me.
- beef cheek ravioli: good, but not much flavor or texture going on

Avoid:
- branzino: too soft, but in general, i just don't like this type of fish. i prefer cod and seabass.

We made a reservation, dressed up showed up here expecting an amazing dinner. We were originally served chickpea bruscetta and then I got the infamous Mario Batali beef cheek ravioli and my friend got the Alberto's Pyramids. 

The first bite of my ravioli made me pause. It was just unexpected -an aquired taste. I let my friend have a taste and she immediately disliked it. I tried her Albert pyramid and got a very ""meh"" feeling from it. 

Each little thing they gave us from the bread to the broccoli and the main courses to little ending sweet tray they gave us just seemed very ""meh"". It was a good meal.

Reason I didn't give it 5 stars was the price ($304) and the waiter trying to up sell us stating that portions were small, they aren't that small, and you can share dishes and don't need to order your own unless you really want to leave there uncomfortably full.

Lovely, relatively quiet atmosphere, especially considering that you are indeed in the middle of two casinos with bustling shops and a ton of tourists just outside. 

We started with the B&B Caprese salad (with Heirloom Tomatoes and Burrata). The heirloom tomatoes were busting with fresh tomato flavor and the burrata was good enough to sing about. 

On to the Bucatini 'all'Amatriciana' (with Guanciale, Hot Pepper and Pecorino). We first fell in love with Bucatini 'all'Amatriciana in Rome, and order it whenever we find it on a menu. This one did not disappoint - the salty/savory/spicy combination in the sauce was sublime. 

Next up, Batali's interpretation on calamari: Spicy Two Minute Calamari ""Sicilian Lifeguard Style"". We inquired about the whole ""Sicilian Lifeguard Style"" thing and our server explained that Batali put himself into the mind of your average Sicilian lifeguard and then asked himself ""what would I like to eat?"" And thus his Two Minute Calamari was born. The calamari came in a spicy tomato broth with several large caper berries, some Israeli couscous and a sweet fruity bit (currant, maybe?) that actually seemed a bit at odds with the rest of the flavors. And as it turns out, two minutes for calamari is just perfect. 

We also ordered a side of charred corn, but this never arrived at the table. Which turned out okay, as we were stuffed by the time we saw the bottom of the bowl of calamari.",IUrGaOc4Tcb-CAL7_MZXsQ,4,1,4,8UMFJ-BA8nG9qap_z9aHow

No pasta tasting menu or traditional tasting menu
Service: I would have expected even better service since I had the most fabulous service at Del Posto in NYC

Beverages: the boys had cocktails; dad ordered a bottle of expensive wine (can't really remember...was totally distracted with trying to decide what to order off the menu...I would have been fine with water!)

Starter: Ordered pretty much every single appetizer on the menu to share - everything was ""good"" but nothing really blew me away.  For $24 heirloom tomatoes salad, $21 a plate for buffalo mozzarela and $14 a plate for beet salad,  I would expect all these dishes to be amazing, but in the end, they were just dressed up salads.    

Pasta Course: We order six diff pastas to share.  We had to have ""refills"" on two of them  because it was THAT GOOD - 1) beef cheek ravioli with black truffles and crushed duck liver and 2) Bolognese pappardelle.  I LOVE pasta and I am extremely picky when it comes to pasta (maybe it's the Asian in me...from the school of Marco Polo brought pasta back to western world from China...LOL)  I must say, these two dishes were flavorful, unique and what a delight to taste something like the bolognese kicked up 100 notches at B&B.  The wild boar ragu was alright, did not ""wow"" me.  The clam linguine was poor at best - TOO spicy, nothing special, and not flavorful aside from the dramatic heat - it was disappointing. 

Entrees: We each ordered an entree and pretty much everyone ordered something different.  I was honored to eat off of everyone's plate.  

I ordered the rabbit.  The Rabbit was AMAZING.  It was done a few different ways - braised, confit, deep fried leg, and pan seared.  It was flavorful, tender, juicy, and well seasoned.  It had a wonderful balance of flavors - gentle but with a punch.  (my second choice for entree would have been the sweetbreads)

BBQ skirt steak - it was just ok.  It wasn't excellent, it wasn't bad, it was just middle of the road.  Not my favorite cut to begin with, but most of all, it seemed to have been marinated with a lot of salt...too salty for me.

Whole grilled Branzino was quite good.  The fish is very mild and the dish was well seasoned overall.  I love whole fish (once again the Asian in me) - makes the meat so much more juicy.  

Grilled rib eye was shared between two sisters.  I liked the rib eye a lot albeit I only had two little bites.  I mean, it's hard to go wrong with a rib eye, but hey, you'd be surprised...

Dessert: ordered several to share with everyone at the table.  Nothing totally memorable.  The small bites biscuit/cookies they brought out with our coffee were even better than the desserts we ordered (very similar experience at Del Posto...)

1) Baccala mezzune: This dish had a nice fish inside pasta, dehydrated olives, lemon, oregano. It was just the right amount of salty and lightly but complexly flavored.

2) Goat cheese tortellini with fried orange and wild fennel pollen: OH MY GOODNESS. So savory. Exactly what it sounds like. Could have eaten a pound of this one.

3) Tagliatelle with parsnips, guanciale and chili: This was ribbon pasta in a butter sauce with the stuff above. It was very good but of all the courses I might have skipped this one if I had to choose one to skip.

4) Alberto's Pyramids: PHENOMENAL. ""This will ruin beef ravioli for you forever."" That's what the waitress told us and she was right. Perfect pasta surrounding delicious braised beef in a tangy tomato based sauce. Also could've eaten a whole plate of these.

5) Beef cheek ravioli with black truffles and crushed duck liver: RICH RICH RICH. This one was delicious but oh-so-rich to the point where I couldn't finish my little portion.

Our main courses were the problem.  Both of the lobsters were undercooked in the lobster spaghetti (it was also a bit slimy), the short ribs were so salty that I couldn't eat it, and my husbands fish dish (can't remember what it was called) was bland and lifeless.

We started with a pasta to start, and two pastas for the entree. 

Spaghettini with Spicy Budding Chives, Sweet Garlic and One-Pound Lobster $32

This was highly recommended by the server, and he also suggested that we started off with this dish since it was lighter than the other two pasta dishes we selected.  The pasta was cooked perfectly al dente, but I couldnt help but wish that they had used fresh pasta. It would have completely elevated the dish, and the fresh pasta would have absorbed the sauce a lot better. The lobster was perfectly cooked, and the chives  added a bite and freshness to the dish. Sounds all good right? Almost.

The dish was extremely salty. I was a little disappointed since the saltiness took away from the sweetness of the lobster. I tried to ignore it, but it was enough to annoy me. It had the potential to be a really amazing dish. Just needed a few more notches...

Next, our two entrees...

Beef Cheek Ravioli with Black Truffles and Crushed Duck Liver $26 

I was really really excited about this dish. Beef cheek? GOOD. Truffles? GOOD. Duck liver...AMAZING.Right???? Wrong. This dish was a bit of a fail. The highlights of the dish were definitely the beef cheek ravioli. The pasta was fresh, and the filling was succulent and delicious. My complaint stems with the truffle and the crushed duck liver (the server called it foie gras...). . Although it was not foie, you think of a smooth and buttery fatness to liver. The duck liver was extremely gritty and had a very strong flavor that overpowered the delicateness of the pasta. Quite the opposite reaction I was expecting. The truffle flavor did not come through at all, and it seemed like sort of an afterthought. Also, there was two measly shavings of the truffle which appeared come out of a jar. I guess I was really excited for this dish, and when it did not deliver- it just killed it for me. I was pretty much over it after eating two raviolis. 

Gnocchi with Braised Oxtail $27

The server told us that the gnocchi was house made. I pray that he was wrong because it resembled something similar to the Trader Joes version. I love gnocchi. When prepared right, those soft pillows of pasta can really create a euphoric experience. The gnocchi here were extremely dense, and did not at all seem homemade by any means. The dish's saving grace was the braised oxtail. There was a lot of beautifully braised meat, and the flavors were rich in flavor. If only they had served the braised oxtail with another pasta...I would have been much happier.

Ok...so you're probably saying...come on Michelle... give Batali a break. I say NO. Look, if you're gonna charge about $30/dish... and you're a highly rated chef... you should really be paying attention to detail. Make your own pastas, don't over-season a potentially amazing dish, and don't charge an arm and a leg for it. My other complaint was that the portions were rather small. I'm not a huge eater (although i love to eat), but the dishes were around 6 oz. of pasta for a person. 

Would I come here again? It would be hard to  justify it when there are so many other great places in Vegas. I would undoubtedly go back if someone picked up the tab though =)

3 stars for the service, the ambiance, and the food.",SpM-RGzQe5pRNyChsxqmTw,5,5,3,8_I-coM8ZENgjktQ5JEwiQ
2833239,2013-12-08,0,GTR39A2jwNIS_NV8q2r_JA,"Obviously, a Mario Batali restaurant is going to have great food. I was unprepared, psychologically, for just how great it was going to be. 

We started with an appetizer of Grilled Octopus with ""Fagioli Marinati"" and Spicy Limoncello Vinaigrette. The octopus was meaty; salty, and played perfectly with the vinaigrette. It was, by far, the best part of an exceptional meal. I've never had octopus so tender and delicious. 

Next came the primi platters. I had the Bone Marrow Ravioli with Osso Bucco Ragù. While delicious, the portion on it was unconscionably small. I understand that this is gourmet, fine dining, but, for $32, I wanted more than twelve ravioli, each the size of a quarter. 

My co-worker Gnocchi with Lamb Ragù and Mint - I'd love to tell you how that tasted, but judging from the way he growled at me and threatened me with a knife when I asked for a bite, I'm guessing it was excellent. 

My secondi was the Short Rib ""al Barolo"" with Anson Mills Polenta and Horseradish. From what I gather, as far as short rib goes, it was the best ever made. It turns out I don't like short ribs, it seems. Such is life. My co-worker enjoyed that, while I stole the rest of his Crispy Fried Sweetbreads with Italian Butternut Squash and Wickson Apples. I've never had sweetbreads before; I MUST have them again. Those were excellent. 

Finally, because we're gluttonous, I got the Vanilla Mascarpone Bruciato
with Fresh Huckleberries, which was heavenly, and he got the Apple Crostata
with Vanilla Bean Gelato. Both top-notch. 

All in all, worth the trip if you're taking a client out to dinner on an expense account, or you're extremely wealthy on your own.",Io5GxWjhtxqiWnoA-6Fh-w,0,0,5,qREBa0PIFjnPhP_ZAhrVow

They encourage you to buy five courses for each person to really get the full experience but this wasn't the French Laundry, and we weren't about to blow $500 on anything less.  We each got three courses (even though the waiter was trying to bully us into ordering more) and spent close to $300 after tip.  All in all, I'd say that the food was good, but the price was outrageous, especially for what it was.  I've had better food at Jack's La Jolla for half the cost.  Bouchon cost less and it has a Michelin Star.  If you want fine dining, go to French Laundry, don't waste your time and money here.  If you want fine dining in Las Vegas, check out any of the Michelin Star restaurants for a much better dining experience.  If you need to brag to your friends about a famous restaurant you went to in Vegas, check out L'Atelier de Joël Robuchon.  At least they'll make you feel good about spending your mortgage on food.

I loved this place. My wife and I were invited to a friend's event in Las Vegas and we had considerable time to explore different restaurants. This place was one of our favorite stops for dinner. The service was excellent but the food was exceptional. 

We started with the Roasted Kabocha Squash and Grilled Octopus. I can see why some may not be blown away by the squash dish - it's flavors are more delicate and I would describe it as an elegant dish. If you've grown accustomed to overly spiced or salted foods, this may not wow you, but I really enjoyed this app. The Grilled Octopus, however, was hands-down the best I've ever had. It had the most tender consistency, almost like swordfish and rather unlike the rubbery fare I sometimes encounter, even at highly regarded places. 

The Pork Trotter Ravioli was very good and my wife only let me steal a little, but I was happy to get what she shared. 

My dinner included an order of the Orecchiette and the Short Rib ""al Barolo"". Our server assured me the short rib would be so tender it could be cut with a spoon. He was not exaggerating. It was every bit as good as my mother's, which I have never been able to duplicate in the kitchen myself.

The peas looked beautiful in size and with a brilliant bright green color, but had absolutely no flavor.  Nothing special about the Burrata, comparable to something I would buy at Trader Joe's.  Oh, yes, and the mint..there was one mint leaf as garnish. Blah.

My husband had the Beef Raviolis (I think it was short rib filled).  I took one look at them, and first off, thought it was one of the most unappealing plates of pasta I had ever seen.  No presentation at all.  Took one bite and they tasted every bit as bland/blah as they looked.  Not only were they blah, they were lukewarm, and the filling was dry and very salty.  

I chose the Beef Short Rib on polenta.   It's hard to really mess up braised short ribs, so it was okay, but the polenta tasted like something you would serve a baby as one of there first foods. No salt, no flavor of any kind.  I've made short ribs that were much more memorable than what was served to me in a restaurant owned by a world renowned chef.  

I have a few of Batalli's cookbooks, and have made some of my favorite meals out of them.   Tasted and looked way better than anything served or looked in that restaurant!

I told my friends about how much I enjoyed watching Mario Batali on tv and how without hesitation we should try this restaurant. After dinner I walked away with my tail between my legs, as I had committed a social felony recommending this restaurant!

Wine by the glass selection is limited, and we weren't sure what red to order, so the staff wine expert came to our table and helped us pick out the perfect bottle. We really appreciated that and very much enjoyed the wine (which is clear, because I can't remember which bottle of wine we tried)! 

The decor is white tablecloth, surrounded by warm tones---we heard them playing Jane's Addiction in the background which my friends and I really appreciated. We enjoyed the contrast of rock music to elegant dining. Now onto the food...the reason I'm only giving this restaurant 2 out of 5 stars...

We had eaten shortly before, so two of my friends were tempted to split one plate of Goat Cheese Tortelloni (instead of ordering two). The waitress (who in my opinion was unfriendly) said ""We don't have large portions of pasta here"" and with her hands showed us how small they are. Well, yes, the pasta portion was not large like at a typical Olive Garden, but the richness of the goat cheese was PLENTY filling from one plate. My friends didn't even touch their second serving they had ordered. So in short--I wasn't impressed with the service. Our waitress was totally unfriendly and impatient. We had excellent olive oil and balsamic vinegar on the table for dipping, but the waitress didn't even bother to check to see if our bread was warm. It was cold as if it had been recently thawed out.

The filling of the Goat Cheese Tortelloni is rich, but the texture is light. The pasta was al dente--which was fine. This was probably the best dish we tried at B&B even though it was a bit salty. OVER-SALTED is the theme for our experience at B&B. The duck I ordered was beautifully presented, but it was over-cooked and SALTY. The Field Greens with Trebbiano Vinaigrette was too salty, and so was the unconventional Calamari and Seppie Fritti appetizer. I imagined the chef, sous chef and kitchen staff all taking turns that night pretentiously sprinkling salt on each dish, one after the other, behind each other's backs. 

I'm sure the quality of ingredients at B&B is superior, but you wouldn't know it underneath all that salt. More than spending that kind of money for a bad meal, I hated feeling embarrassed that I had so strongly convinced my friends (on our last night in Vegas) to try this restaurant. I had put alot of faith in Mario Batali's name and that was a mistake. Just because his name's on the sign doesn't mean he's running the kitchen. With all of the food that Las Vegas has to offer, I felt we had wasted a meal's worth of time visiting this place. 

So, if you insist on eating at B&B Ristorante, you can have faith that the wine and the Goat Cheese Tortelloni are a hit. I worked in restaurants in Houston for several years, and I know that sometimes the success of a meal can rest solely on who the kitchen manager is and how he dictates the show behind the scenes. Maybe we were just the unlucky bunch that ate there on a bad night. Even taking that into consideration I probably would not try B&B again.",EtBzhzu8h74j8_0yrT-ENQ,2,0,2,QHKZnRET3x4gdXE-tojBLg

this dish is served at other Mario Batali restaurants - Osteria Mozza in Los Angeles CA & Babbo Ristorante e Enoteca in New York NY.  
2. Gnocchi with Braised Oxtail - I would order this anytime!
3. Dessert: Chocolate Strawberry Torta with Strawberry Sorbetto - great for chocolate lovers. The Bônet with Lavender Flowers I heard is terrific. 
4. Cappuccino - was so terrific, I had to order 2. It was hard to find a decent cap in Vegas.

Service was excellent, we asked to be re-seated in another area and it was not problem.  I recommend a cozy booth/table.  We sat next to a wonderful group of people that turned out were from a neighboring town back home.  They enjoyed the Bônet with Lavender Flowers - dessert.  

Recommendations: If you love wine, get a reservation and have them decant your favorite wine ahead of time.  A wonderful selection of Brunello De Montalcino, obviously any from 97 ""year of the gods"", or a 99, or 01.  On a budget, order the Morellino di Scansano, Perazzi La Mozza 2006 Toscana which I think is from one of Mario's vineyard in Tuscany.

anyway, so i went here with one of my colleagues just because i felt like italian and i definitely wanted to try a mario batali restaurant. so we walk in and everything is cool, the hostess was super nice and we were seated promptly. 

so douchebag takes over and he's ok and all at first but for some reason i get this look from him like he thinks i don't know anything and he's real nice to my male colleague like ""i'm going to kiss your ass because you're going to be tipping me"" kinda thing. little does he know that i'm the one footing the bill and he's treating me like i'm the ditzy little date....asshole. 

as for the food, we started off with a wonderful caprese salad with fresh imported bufala mozzarella from italy. man, that stuff was good. very silky and creamy texture. it was light, but it was so rich at the same time. it was amazing.

for the second course i had the spaghettini with roasted garlic and lobster. the pasta was perfectly al dente and they certainly did not skimp on the lobster! it was a whole pound of it on my plate! i love lobster. lobster is my friend!

anyway, back to douchebag...so as we were eating, he seemed to be gravitating more towards my colleague than me which is not cool. he would give me these looks and while i was trying to be polite, the bitch in me started becoming more apparent. my colleague was like...""i actually think he likes you and is just giving you a hard time on purpose..."" well, giving me condescending looks and comments isn't quite the great way to subtly hit on me...

so we decide to skip dessert and douchebag acts like we're making the biggest mistake of our lives. i'm sure the desserts are awesome,  but whatever.

and then the bill comes. douchebag hands it over to my colleague who then hands it over to me. i look at douchebag and say to him right as i get the bill...""someone should have been a little nicer and more knowledgeable..."" and then he starts to kiss my ass. too late. small tip for you. i hope mario sticks a croc up your ass if he ever reads this review....let's see, the server's name was Mike M.",uuS7HybMuQQhZHSmgVHEWQ,3,0,3,4a88zuYFklhlLU1MZuO7mA

My friend and I came to spend money and eat our hearts out, but didn't have the opportunity to do either because we were barely acknowledged by the waiter. Consequently, we left feeling dissatisfied and hungry. A couple of things that contribute to this negative review: 1. We ordered wine that we never received (yet were charged for it); 2. We had to ask for butter/olive oil to go with our bread. After we requested the butter/olive oil, the couple that was seated next to us leaned over and told us that they weren't offered it either, so this seems to be a policy, not just an oversight. 3. Ok, back to the bread. Instead of leaving a bread basket at your table, there is a lady who comes by (once) and doles out one measly piece of bread to each diner. Considering how long we had to wait for our meal, it would have been nice to at least have a choice to indulge in seconds on bread. 4. The food was disappointing beyond words. My pasta was under-cooked (not al dente, but undercooked) and the lobster that was part of my entrée had a rubbery texture and no flavor.  5. The service was lacking. When our waiter asked how our meal was and we told politely told him it was disappointing, he didn't ask any questions or try to find out what was lacking. Instead, he said ""Sorry to hear that"" and quickly left the bill and dashed. B&B Ristorante missed the mark on every level for me. I really feel like this restaurant doesn't care about its patrons having a good and memorable experience; instead, it just preys on the fact that the majority of people who dine there are tourists and they aren't invested in their satisfaction or in them coming back. For a town with so many good restaurants, my advice is to go elsewhere if you want a truly memorable dining experience (I highly recommend Mesa Grill).",bHcNaZ0C75kGICQqmrMMDQ,3,0,1,5KU9XFMbYjUQXDDEy8GGoQ

This being said, there is one dish that I would go back for. and that is Mario Batali's Grilled Octopus with Limoncello Vinaigrette. It was one of the top ten things that I have ever tasted. The octopus was grilled to perfection without any rubbery texture and the limoncello dressing added a powerful citrus flavor that brightened the entire dish. If you do go, order this for your appetizer and a second for your entree!

My entree of steak tagliata with roasted fingerling potatoes on the other hand, was HORRENDOUS. It was so so so so incredibly oily that I could barely finish eating it. I've had better steaks for half the price at hole-in-the-wall Italian restaurants. The potatoes were burnt to a crisp and also drenched in oil--I put one in my mouth and ended up spitting it out (a nice surprise for my waiter in the cloth napkin at the end of the night, I am sure!)

But aside from the food, I must also admit that the wine was delicious. I had a full bodied red by Bastianich and it was stellar (as it should be at $18 a glass!).

The entrees were the Beef Cheek Ravioli and Whole Grilled Branzino. These were polar opposites, and wonderfully complimentary as well. The ravioli was exquisitely rich, with a truffle sauce that was so layered with flavor. The Branzino was grilled whole, presented, and then filleted. It was wonderfully light and simple, and perfectly done. Sampling between the two was a real delight. Dessert was the Bruciato Marscapone, and Dark Chocolate Torta. Also a Yin/Yang combination. The Bruciato light and delicate, and the Torta deeply rich.

My wife's pasta courses were very good and the first course absolutely perfect. My regional menu was very unique but a bit inconsistent. I will say that the calf's brain ravioli was one of the best dishes I have ever eaten. Inconsistency however kept a star off my rating. My wife's last pasta course was super spiced and was left un eaten and my cheese plater was as forgettable as a Costco sampling.

The grilled octopus was very good and probably the highlight.  The bread was ok, the waiter explained it aas being twice baked.  They offer you ciabatta and lard as a special appetizer you can buy, but last time I was in town you could that at Carne Vino for free.

Beef cheek ravioli was ok but a bit heavy and honestly could have been stuffed with anything because there wasn't really a lot of filling to be able to tell what it was.  I got the seared duck breast with the cherry and wine reduction.  The duck wasn't anything special.  There was no crisp to the sear, it was all pretty soggy and HEAVY on the salt.  A co-diner had the veal which he said was really salty.  They did offer to bring something else which was nice but we opted for a comped side of unseasoned veggies to help ease the saltiness.

I didn't have dessert but did have an americano.  Italian espresso is the way to go.  Others got the gelatto something else I can't remember.  They did bring out some little house made cookies/candies which I thought was nice.

When we arrived, we were immediately seated at a table for two in the back corner.  I was not thrilled with the location but it ended up a good spot where you could see the action of the restaurant and the bar.  Honestly, service started a little slow but picked up and was great by the end.  The pacing was a little off, for instance we received our appetizer prior to receiving our bottle of wine.  And, we ordered a bottle of wine (they only have Italian wines) and the sommilier came over to ask us about our preferences after we ordered.  Unfortunately, what we picked out was not what we would typically order but he kindly suggested a wine in the same price range that suited our tastes...he did not try and upsell.  However, he probably should have been there from the beginning so we would have our wine prior to any of our food.  That is my only complaint.

On to the food, we received mini chickpea bruchettas on the house and we ordered the grilled octopus to share and it was fantastic.  It was surprisingly tender and the lemon flavor balanced the dish perfectly.  For pastas, we shared the mint love letters with spicy lamb sausage and the beef cheek raviolis.  Honestly, I cannot tell you which one I loved more.  The beef cheek was extremely rich and I was glad to be sharing because I could not have had the entire plate without feeling overwhelmed.  The mint love letters were incredibly unique with a nice mint flavor and a spiciness that merged perfectly.  

For entrees, I ordered the sweetbreads and my husband had the pork chop.  My sweetbreads were rich (kind of a theme) and delicious and the pork chop was good, but nothing to get too excited about.  We sort of wished we would have just split one more pasta instead of ordering entrees because they were so incredible.  We declined dessert but had the nice tray of petit fours offered at the end of the meal.  Oh, and the wine was fabulous.  We asked them to write the name down for us, but instead they took off the label and put a laminate sheet over it for us to take home.  We thought that was a nice touch.

We did not even notice the music, so maybe they have that taken care of or maybe it just doesn't bother us.  The servers were very friendly and the manager was helpful when applying our comps to the tab.

Most of the dishes that we wanted to order were already out (it was only 7:30pm!) so we settled for our server's recommendations.

We started with her salad recommendation. I didn't expect THINLY shaved Porcini mushrooms and arugula salad with THINLY shaved parmesan tossed in EVOO and aged balsamic vinegar.  Such a plain jane appetizer, it's really not worth the $17 price tag for salad.

However, the grilled octopus with borlotti marinati in a spicy limoncello vinaigrette was too good to be true!  Especially after the disappointing salad starter, it was great to have this dish to savor over. 

The pasta dishes were good, although not quite solid.  My beef cheek ravioli with black truffles and crushed duck liver was exactly what the doctor ordered! (not THAT doctor, I'm talking about the doctor for the soul! ha!)  I love foie and I love black truffles so it wasn't a surprise that I was going to LOVE this dish. The bf's pacherri with clams, mussels and shrimp cooked in a tangy tomato sauce was great, although the pasta wasn't cooked through. I like al dente but some pieces were still raw. 

Service definitely needs improvement, while our busser kept up with the refilling of water, delivering dishes, etc.  I would like to see our actual server pass by more than one time and a ""is everything perfect?""  question tossed our way.

He has a signiture drink called, ""The Green Monk."" It MUST be tried. He also makes a killer mojito. Seems simple, but you'd be surprised!

The atmosphere was comfortable and classy. Everytime someone left the table for the restroom, a staff member would fold their napkin nicely. I enjoyed the little things.

To be honest, this is not the best place for a vegetarian. But it is still lovely and I would go again. I would give 3.5 stars if I could.. but since I have to choose, I will go with 4 because our server rocked it.",W-JDo8XXO14z7xTde7ggAw,0,0,4,e7vmbAIMt10OESCG7ZMQBQ

Our server was absolutely wonderful, it must be said.  He was attentive, funny, entertaining and didn't skip a beat.

We started out with the Octopus appetizer, which was delicious and a very promising start.  I am originally from a seaside city in Australia where we are able to source incredible octopus and this was on par with what I have experienced in dining there.   

The wine was decent, overpriced but it was Vegas, so OK.  My husband enjoyed his cocktail.

Where the meal really fell down was on the main course.  The rabbit was extremely over-seasoned (and I have a salty palate) and dry/tough.  It was literally inedible.  Back to the great customer service, above - the cost was removed from our tab. But, we came expecting perfection....

My meal was a seafood pasta, which was good however the pasta was a much too al dente for my tastes, it was very chewy and difficult to eat.  

The two stars on the review are for the Octopus and the Service.  if you are in the Venetian, stop by for a mixed drink and enjoy that appetizer with a cocktail. If you're not right there.... there are lots of other fabulous eateries in Vegas.  We had a great meal at Bobby Flay's the next day....!",QcjXjJVXRvPD8CbQm-hWgQ,1,0,2,LZHh5Wj7305HqqtEBZc4BA

3517365,2010-07-20,0,GTR39A2jwNIS_NV8q2r_JA,"As with other Mario Batali restaurants in Las Vegas no expense was spared to make B&B look like an elegant fine dining establishment. There is plenty of dark wood, dim lighting, and wine racks full of some of the finest wine on the strip. Unfortunately, being located in a high-traffic area of the Venetian, near the connector to the Palazzo, means they get a lot of walk-ins. Those walk-ins usually mean drunk, yard-glass consuming tourists in shorts and t-shirts, not the typical clientele of fine-dining restaurants seen in other cities.

During my visit to B&B I got to experience first-hand some of the random drunks that stumble into this restaurant. Two guys were seated next to us who were slurring in broken English, but were able to articulate the occasional ""Fuck you, you son of a bitch!"" into their conversation. These fine gents sent back a bottle of wine for no reason, complained about everything from the second they sat down, and when they wanted to ask their server something one of the guys got up and chased him down from across the room while shouting, ""Excuse me, waiter!"" repeatedly at the top of his lungs. Half way through our meal we had to ask to be seated elsewhere because their antics turned from slightly amusing to obnoxious.

Luckily, the food at B&B made up for the ambiance, or lack thereof. Both pasta dishes we ordered were excellent. The beef cheek ravioli was pure buttery, savory, saltiness goodness. The tagliatelle with charred sweet corn and truffles was some of the finest hand-made pasta we've had in town.

For entrees, we ordered the duck and brasato al barolo. The duck is prepared two ways and served with cherry agrodolce and bitter greens. Both preparations of the duck were excellent, especially the duck confit which was so rich and tender. The brasato al barolo is a beef short rib that was fork-tender and very flavorful.

For dessert we got the dark chocolate torta -- a delicious bitter/sweet offering served with mixed berries. We also tried the house-made mint chocolate chip gelato -- smooth, rich and creamy and a perfect way to end the meal. The manager brought over two glasses of a dessert wine that they said would pair perfectly with the dark chocolate torta. They did not disappoint.

Their beer list is limited, but the Sella del Diavolo brown ale that I tried was excellent. Their wines by the glass are reasonably priced, for Vegas standards, and the one red we tried (Maculan) was very good. A single glass of wine is a generous pour, served in a decanter then poured in a glass.

Prices are fairly steep but they do offer locals 20% off. Portions aren't large, but that's mainly because your supposed to order 3-4 courses as your dinner. The pace is slow, but our waiter was kind enough to let us know right after being seated and asked us if we had any time constraints. The service was good but not as finely-tuned as other ""fancy"" restaurants. Although our server seemed to have a lot of tables which would explain why he didn't stop by too frequently.

So, despite the obnoxious drunks (who happened to walk out without paying half way through their meal) it was a very good experience. Their menus are large and I'd love to go back to try several other dishes.",C2C0GPKvzWWnP57Os9eQ0w,3,2,5,YW38pvFWlI1jBcLY67y1vw

3570750,2007-09-16,0,GTR39A2jwNIS_NV8q2r_JA,"After calling literally 20+ times for Babbo, Mario Batali's well known restaurant in NYC, I've decided to go with Mario's new restaurant in Las Vegas as an alternative. The service was the best I've experienced, the atmosphere was dark yet intimate, but the food was only average. B&B is known to serve more rustic Italian foods than the other Batali restaurants. Some of the ""interesting"" menu items are lamb's tongue, lamb's brain, and beef cheek ravioli.

I had an ice tea accompanied by the best beverage service. They brought an empty glass with ice and a slice of lemon, a stirring rod, a tumbler with my ice tea, and simple syrup. I helped myself to the perfect blend of ice tea, ice, and syrup and enjoyed the complimentary chick pea with olive on crostini. 

We ordered Calamari and Seppie (part of the octopus family) Fritti. The calamari was lighter than the usual that you find elsewhere. The marinara sauce tasted like it was freshly made from tomatoes and was the perfect dipping sauce for the calamari. Of course, you have to squeeze the lemon on the side to give the calamari a lighter and more refreshing taste. 

For the main course, I ordered the grilled lamb chops with mint sauce. The eight pieces of lamb that I got were cooked just right but were way too salty. Given that I'm not a big fan of heavily flavored foods and always opt for the natural and original taste, the lamb would probably be salty for the average food connoisseur. I talked to the manager of the restaurant and he told me that Mario's signature style is to soak all meats in salt brine prior to cooking which brings out the tenderness of the meat. Thus, if you are like me, try the pasta instead. The manager told me that the pasta is also soaked in the salt brine but later soaked in water to enhance its texture. 

We finished off our meal with a  today's dessert special of blueberry fruit tart and lemon mascarpone. It was very tiny for $14 but it was good. 

I like Mario's other restaurants a lot better than this one but I still look forward to visit Babbo when I travel to NYC next time. I'll try to make a reservation months in advance this time!",WmxI1qCrehKQf915HCML6A,3,0,3,VNnLVnhC3yM5fr7CppHu8g

However main courses were mediocre at best. Sirloin steak was dry, came with Arugula and about as much balsamic as fits on the tip of your finger. Absolutely no taste to this dish. My friend's Quail was over cooked and overall plate was just poorly combined. Our other companions Linguine was deemed very good. The biscotti plate and Americano coffee were the best part of the meal.

Service was well below what we are used to from the Venetian businesses. Waiter was friendly enough but didn't hide the fact that he didn't give a shit about anything.

here are my rants:

1.  first, we got to the restaurant about 45 minutes early and asked if it would be possible to be seated.  they say sure, but then lead us to sit in the bar and said it would be just a moment.  well, just a moment turned out to be almost an hour.  so, we ended up being seated at our table almost 15 minutes later than our reservation.  i don't mind if they told us they didn't have seats until our reservation time, because that's when we reserved the table for...but why did they tell us that we could be seated early??  

2.  the food:  we ordered the grilled octopus with cranberry beans, pig trotter, homemade orecchiette with with sweet sausage and rapini, grilled quail, and i think brasato (i think they've changed it a bit since ate here), and for dessert i had the panna cotta with huckleberries.  except for the trotter and the orechiette, the food was as good as expected.  the trotter i thought had a bit of a strange after taste and the orechiette with sweet sausage and rapini was almost inedible.  it was so salty, i almost could not swallow it.  and after i did, i regretted it.  we left it almost uneaten when our plates were cleared and no one ever asked if it was to our liking or if there was anything wrong with it.  if it weren't for a show after our dinner, i think i might have sent it back...which is something i rarely do.  

3.  training of the wait staff:  okay, so i know what is appropriate to expect and what is not depending on the type of restaurant.  i'm not gonna go into mcdonalds and ask for fresh ground pepper or to olive garden and ask that my pasta be al dente...anyways,  so i'm eating my brasato and there are some root vegetables i've never had before.  so, i ask a waiter (not our main waiter...it seemed like all the waiters help each other out even though it's not their table) as i point to the vegetable, if he could please identify the vegetable.  he says he doesn't know and calls over another waiter and he tells me that the root vegetable i'm pointing to is couscous.  okay.  i'm thinking, he cannot be serious or maybe i misheard.  so, i ask him to repeat.  he again says that it is couscous.  i say, no, that is not couscous.  it's a vegetable.  so, we ""argue"" back and forth then i just give in...thinking to myself that he is an idiot.  if he didn't know, all he had to say is i don't know, but i can find out for you.  why is this so difficult.  if you're gonna be charging over $50 for an entree, the waitstaff should be educated in the ingredients.

i also didn't think our waiter was very attentive to our needs.  instead of coming to check up on us, we were constantly looking around for him or waiving the busboy over when we needed something.  also all the tables around me with women had purse hangers, but i wasn't even offered.  

if it wasn't for the food (excluding the orechiette and trotter), i would have given only 2 stars.  will have to reassess before thinking about returning.",gUkqdzdD0jhqsjM-AZAWVw,3,3,3,WKeQCmJTAQ3Zq7rgqCe23A

I'm really glad I didn't read all of these negative reviews.  

i will agree that the atmosphere may leave something to be desired, and the restaurant is loud and crowded, however In my opinion the food was phenomenal and the best meal we had in Vegas.  (We went to Picasso two nights later and were truly underwhelmed.)  I would especially recommend the Goat Cheese Tortelloni.

The appetizers stole the show, which is a shame because the main courses should be the star.  The menu design was great, however the execution left alot to be desired.  

Staff was incredibly attentive and helpful in navigating the a-la-carte and tasting menu.  We opted for family style on the a-la-carte menu and they were very accommodating.

Lentil Bruschetta Amuse Bouche:  A+
Really savory.  Simple dish but was a nice opener. 

Grilled Octopus Antipasti:  A
Glorious.  Enjoyed the smoky flavor.  Octopus was cooked perfectly.  Not overdone or rubbery at all, and the olive oil sauce was delicate.

Beef Tripe Stew Antipasti:  A
Really heart beef flavor.  Tripe again, was cooked and seasoned to perfection!  May not be for everyone's tastes though, since the broth was quite gamey.  

Clam and Panchetta Linguine:  B
The pasta was cooked al dente.  However, the sauce was significantly overseasoned.  Not sure anyone tasted this before it was put up to the pass.  Generous serving of clams.  

Sirloin Filet:  A
Perfect medium rare.  Fantastic taste and seasoning.  Great execution.

Roasted Lamb Shoulder:  B
Way too overdone.  Was also significantly overseasoned.  The meat itself was overdone to the extent that it was crispy and dry.  We agreed that this would have been an incredible dish if the lamb were a bit more succulent and if the chef didn't have such a heavy hand when seasoning.

Chocolate Souffle:  A+
Texture was just right.  Souffle was not lopsided.  Filling was not too sweet.  Absolute deliciousness.  

Vanilla Marscapone:  A+
Shards of dried apple chips, pistachios, and an incredibly creamy marscapone.  Really balanced dessert with great flavors.  Erred on the sweeter side but still a pleasant finish to the meal.

PROTIP:  The souffle is on the seasonal menu so YMMV.",Ma_gwnVShENgTuhHNpAvyQ,0,0,3,X8FZ2K9LrYsSZlBnsgZ82g

For the entree, we split the pappardelle bolognese and the pasta was cooked perfectly; the sauce was delicious and well seasoned....BUT....the overall dish was too salty for my taste.  Apparently they cook the pasta in water that is supposed to taste of the sea....which individually was divine; but together with the sauce the whole dish was salt overload.  However, the cocktails that we were served were the most unique and eclectic drinks we had EVER had....no joke.  My fiance is a gourmet chef and I was a bartender that fiddled with mixology.

Potacchio del Pescatore. Like a super crap version of cioppino. Stale, fishy and just bad. 

Budeletti with Guanciale: good, but meat portion (pork cheeks) insultingly small, pasta perfectly cooked, but why should I get .5 oz of pork cheek on the main?

Rabbit porchetta with morels. Rabbit roulade. Decent, but a horrible thing to serve at the price point.

My co-worker went there one day before and told us their spaghetti is soooo salty they had to sent back, but we decided to give it another chance.

We told the waitress to make everything we order w/ less salt because what my co-worker told us. We order the pre-fixed menu w/ lobster spaghetti , few appetizers and 2 black spaghetti. Appetizers is okay, but lobster spaghetti came undercooked that it's still hard and you can tasted the starch so we sent it back. They heated up for us without remaking the whole dish (microwaved???) Because it came back on the same plate and left over food size (me and 2 others all took a bite) and the spaghetti is still a little undercooked.

Black spaghetti is soooooo salty and over spiced (it is not because its spicy because we can both eat really spicy food) which my friend and I both can't even take a 2nd bite even we told them to make everything with less salt. We don't even want to send it back since we already sent back the uncooked lobster spaghetti. So we kind of just left 3 plates of spaghetti there and asked for check.

3831270,2009-09-29,2,GTR39A2jwNIS_NV8q2r_JA,"Mario Batali and Joseph Bastianich team together to provide a high end Italian restaurant on the Las Vegas strip that is surprisingly unremarkable and can be missed by all but the true devotees of the Batali empire.  

I opted for the pre-theater prix fixe menu which includes an amuse bouche, choice of appetizer, entree, dessert, and cafe americano for a reasonable $49.  

Amuse bouche:  Bruschetta topped with herbed garbanzo beans.   A little large for an amuse bouche requiring three bites and follow up by fork for beans that ran astray.  It was functional but not particularly creative.

Appetizer:  I opted for the plate of salumi which included mortadella, lonza (stagionata), salami, pickled ramps, and olives.  The ramps were really delicious, and the olives were of great quality.  I liked the salami and its inherent spiciness.  The lonza could have been better.  Why not use San Daniele prosciutto instead?  The mortadella was surprisingly bland and nothing at all like what I had in Bologna.  Overall this dish was good, but I certainly have had better.

Entree:  I selected the brasato al barolo with horseradish gremolata.  This was a very good dish, but it could have been great.  While braised the brasato was actually a touch dry, and there was no hint of the underlying Barolo whatsoever.  Perhaps more liberal use of the wine in the preparation and a longer cooking time could have made this divine.  The bed of polenta, and the accompanying salad were especially good.  I only wish their portion sizes were larger relative to the very large brasato.  And while the horseradish was freshly shaved before me, I failed to really pick up the taste of it in the dish, strangely.  My glass of Monica wine paired very well with this dish.

Dessert:  I chose two gelati, the peppermint and the ricotta cheese.  The infusion of peppermint worked very well, and I rather enjoyed this selection.  The ricotta was decent too.  This gelato falls considerably short of what can be found in Italy, but for the U.S., it is decent.  

Mignardises:  a tiny biscotti, and two slightly larger candies.  A thrifty selection compared to other Batali establishments, but, again, functional.

Overall at this price point, I was expecting haute cuisine.  Instead, I found good Italian food at inflated prices.  The ambience was atypically boring as well.  At Lupa, Babbo, and even Otto in NY there is a hip vibe, an animated scene, and the restaurants are interesting to be in.  Not here.  This was a cookie cutter formal dining room with no flare at all.  Presentable, yet soulless like the food.

The Yelp ratings are fairly comparable but I def. got the sense that San Marco was loud and raucous so I went with B&B, also hoping that because it was at a higher price point, there might be more Batali-esque cooking there.

Started with two appetizers: The CALAMARI AND SEPPIE FRITO: fried squid and cuttlefish.  They were soooo delicious with bits of tangy caper, pepper lightening the slightly creamy sauce. 

ARTICHOKE, BURRATA and OLIVE OIL:  I didn't enjoy this as much.  While the burrata was sufficiently creamy, it was as if it was broken up and smashed apart.  The artichoke was bitter and overcooked. 

BAVETTE with CARDOONS: linguine with thistle thing (looks and tastes just like celery, was I duped??), garlic, chili flakes, parsley.  This was pretty delicious a bit on the bitter side.  

PORK CHOP with cipolini onions and apples.  Not as moist as it could have been. Could have used a few more of the cute sweet apple wedges.

mint love letters - the lamb and mint went very well together, classic
beef cheek and duck liver ravioli- heavy, but i love things that a rich and fatty like this
sicilian calamari lifeguard style- the calamari was the most tender calamari i have ever eaten. (it says in the cookbook you cook it for 2 minutes or for an hour to ge that tenderness)

i have to say i love mario batali's style of cooking. bold and unrestrained. he really likes to season his food until it hits that border line of too salty, spicy, etc. i love it. 

music that was playing in the background was queen and some other rockbands. i'm guessing these are his favorite bands, because i can't imagine a fine dining restaurant with this kind of music.",YZ0OVOEwAKp3ylp4TiOelw,1,1,5,SxltnW6CP8cWmwyb04f5_w

Don't waste your time or your money.  That's what I was thinking when I left B&B Ristorante.  I read the Yelp reviews before going but Really wanted to try Mario Batali's restaurant.  Big mistake.  I should have listened to the reviewers.  Here's a brief overview of the problems...

Some food way over salted: Yelp warned me
Some pasta undercooked: Yelp warned me
Some meat tough: Yelp warned me
Service was poor: Yelp warned me

Some of the food was unflawed but all of the food was unremarkable.  There was absolutely nothing to suggest that Iron Chef Mario Batali had any influence over the food or service.  Mr. Batali should really consider removing his ""B"" from the name.

For a 4 or 5 Star dining experience, by a celebrity chef, try one of these...

I found this place to be inviting with a great atmosphere and amazing service.
We were serviced by Kevin all night and he was fantastic!. Very knowleadgeable about the food they serve, all his recommendations were great!.
They started us with complementary chickpeas bruschettas, they were alright.
They have a huge selection of italian imported wines and beer (I
I have to admit the prices were pretty high for drinks).
They brought some bread to our table and we ended up ordering the Rib Eye for two, which by the way, was the most amazing rib eye I have ever had. Perfectly seasoned and cooked (medium rare). We were told that this dish is marinated for around 3 months and it has a special process to prepare. 
They cut it for us and plated it beatifully. It came with some potatoes. It was amazing!. 
For dessert, we got the dark chocolate torta. It was very good. The ganache was great as well as the espresso milkshake on the side. Flavours definitely complimented each other.
At the end of our meal we got some complementary sweet bites freshly made by the dessert chef. That was very nice.
We got our bill and yes, it is expensive ($120 for the ribeye only) but if you are looking to get a great meal, it is definitely worth it.
Portions are small so don't go there if you are starving.
I would definitely go back to B&B.
Why not 5 stars? Because the service was not consistant. Kevin was great but I felt the rest of the staff did not deliver the same service.",iBnRs22p7X9HqsQafN58VA,2,1,4,ZUOzi2F7vGwv6IhPOqAPAA

3926654,2014-06-20,0,GTR39A2jwNIS_NV8q2r_JA,"This was our second time at B&B over the past few Vegas visits, and it delivered once again.

They kindly accommodated us when we called to say getting to the strip from the airport had taken longer than expected and we needed to push back our reservation; despite arriving just at the last seating, we didn't feel too rushed.

This is a wine spot: their cocktail menu was only ~4 cocktails long, but the Cerberus (bourbon, ginger beer, blackberry, thyme?) was delicious nonetheless.

It's tempting to go for the full six or seven course pasta tasting menu (the dishes look delicious, and aren't available on the main menu), but they quote it as a two hour affair, so we felt a little guilty starting that up at 11pm, and it also sounded like a lot of food. (Note that everyone at the table has to do the tasting menu if one person does.)

The two of us opted for three antipasti and three pastas. The menu was covered in lamb, which makes sense seasonally, but meant I sort of struggled to figure out how to order without lamb in multiple dishes; perhaps part of why we opted out of a meat dish.

The best dish was the grilled octopus: deliciously charred and flavorful. Thanks to our waiter for recommending it!  I might order two when we come back. The beet salad was the weakest dish; it was missing something: needed some balsamic or lemon or something to kick it up a notch from simply roasted beets. The house made speck (similar to prosciutto) with pluots (hello stone fruit season!) was tasty: the speck was soft and melt in your mouth.

For pasta, we ordered the orecchiette with lamb sausage, and it was delicious, but slightly over salted. That didn't stop me from cleaning the plate! The linguine with clams was the best we have had in a long time: the pasta was boldly al dente, which we liked, and had a taste of the sea (sea salty?): interesting that this one didn't seem ""over salty"" compared to the orecchiette. The final pasta was a tagliatelle with sweet corn, a tasty, buttery but somehow not too heavy or rich dish, and I was impressed that somehow the pasta seemed to infused with corn flavor, even when taking bites without the corn.

Couldn't give five stars due to the plain beets and oversalting, but will definitely be back.",wvt70fUi6MrDfMRhRNj7_A,1,0,4,pQFDk3wGQQfdKoOIvAqYSA

We were a little early for our reservations so we ordered a drink at the bar seating area while we waited. I ordered a Hen n coke as usual, but this bar is super top shelf! The ""cheapest"" Hennessy they had was XO, not even VSOP lol. I would have ordered something else if I knew it would be $45 -____-. 

I came here with my boss and co-worker for dinner and we all chose one of the tasting menus. I went with the ""Whole Hog"" Pasta Tasting Menu with the Riserva Wine Pairing - a 7 course meal, each with a different wine! Each dish highlighted a different part of the pig with a different type of homemade pasta. ($105 per person plus $115 per person for the Riserva wine pairing-- $75 for the regular wine pairing)

Our server was super helpful and explained each dish, as well as the wine pairing. Service was superb and speedy. 

- Complimentary Chickpea Bruschetta: Seasoned chickpeas topped on toast-- good but not as good as what we were about to feast on!

- Minestrine di Torrellini: A nice start to the meal, super flavorful broth! (paired with a 2009 La Mozza)

- Pizzoccheri with Roasted Pork Shank: Flat and wide squid ink pasta with a light sauce-- the pieces of pork shank were super tender and succulent. (Paired with a 2008 Sicilian wine - Etna Piosso)

- Pork Raviollini with Roasted Flamme Tomato Passato: The tomato sauce was bursting with flavor! I could tell that the sauce was made with super ripe and fresh tomatoes and tasted great with the tender pork.  (Paired with a 2007 Monti Garbi)

- Fettuccine with Norcinio Ragu Pork: A lighter, opaque sauce and fettuccine with pieces of the pork's kidney, liver, and heart. You really do get to taste various parts of the pig-- I couldn't tell what each piece was but they were all tasty. (Paired with a 2008 Rubbjano).

** I was already pretty full and buzzed at this point, so don't let the small servings fool you! **

- Black Spaghetti with 'Nduja and Sicilian Pesto: 'Nduja is a spicy, spreadable sausage that is made of different parts of the pig (shoulder, belly, jowl, tripe, spice mixture). The pasta was a little too spicy for me but still killed it (silician pesto contains red pepper). I love the texture of the squid ink pasta because it adds a different, more firm texture. (Paired with a 2007 Cannonau di Sardegna)

- Pear Sorbetto: OMG the best pear sorbet I've ever had! My first bite tasted like I took a bite out of the sweetest, ripest, asian pear! Super light and refreshing, which was amazing after having the spicy spaghetti prior. (Paired with a 2010 Dindarello)

- Chocolate Budino with Huckleberry Sauce: It kind of looks like a souffle but it's actually a creamy custard/pudding. Super moist, fluffy, and not too sweet! The huckleberry sauce tasted amazing with the dessert.  

** Literally felt like I was going to explode at this point **

- Then the server brings out a complimentary assortment of mini dessert cookies along with a shot of a super sweet dessert liquor. A bit too sweet for my liking, but we appreciated it! 

Overall, a wonderful dining experience with great service! I gotta come back here to try items on the regular menu.",F28n26ynklEioZDInyK__A,6,1,4,YvP3ImWnWrW7OXA8kovtbA

When we ordered, we said we were sharing everything and asked for plates for the splitting.  No problem at all.

We started with an amuse-bouche of chick peas on lightly toasted bread.  A very nice starter to get the meal off to a tasty start.

First up were two starters--warm tripe ""alla""Romana and country style paté.  Both were excellent.  The tripe was cut in small strips that were very tender and the tomato sauce was mild and complimented the tripe perfectly. There was freshly grated cheese on top.   The paté, made with pork, was served with blackberry conserve, greens, and cotica.  The paté was very good.  Two nice starters to begin the meal.

For the pasta course, we got the pork trotter ravioli and the beef cheek ravioli.  They allowed us to order off the tasting menu for the beef cheek ravioli.  For the pork trotter, there was freshly grated cheese.  The beef cheek ravioli was in a sauce of black truffles and crushed duck liver.  Both dishes were superb!  The beef cheek had a hearty flavor of truffle and liver.  The pork trotter had pieces of chive and their blossoms.  The textures in the pork trotter ravioli were great.  Two winners for the pasta course.

For main courses, we got rabbit porchetta and roasted lamb shoulder.  The rabbit was accompanied by a carrot sformato, sunflower sprouts and crispy confit.  The flavors were excellent and the rabbit was very tasty.  The lamb shoulder was cooked medium rare and served with cannellini beans and some greens.  Both main courses wer outstanding!  Very flavorful, simple yet elegant dishes.  

For dessert, M ordered the chocolate budino and I ordered a special--peaches and cream.  M's budino was made more like a soufflé and the chocolate could have been richer.  The top was pierced and some melted chocolate poured on the top.  The peaches and cream were fantastic!  The dish consisted of lightly grilled peach slices on a bed of mascarpone and a peach sorbet.  A very simple dish executed so nicely.

After dinner, we were brought a box with 7 mignardises.  A tasty selection of little bites to end our meal.  

Service was outstanding during our meal.  Plates were cleared quickly, new silverware and dishes were brought for each course, and the explanations of the dishes was great!

After walking by B&B so many times and looking at the menu, it was really good to try the place.  Eating with a friend also gave me the chance to taste double the amount of items without eating double the amount of food.",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,12,11,5,2KdSN63sHX2uBqOjdxPZSg

I absolutely loved my Branzino (sea bass) which was skillfully filleted and deboned for me after showing it for approval first. Delicious and so refined.

We opted to skip coffee and dessert since it was rather late, and were pleasantly surprised by two plates of mini dessert samplers. The meringue minis were delicious and definitely my favorites because they're so light and flavorful.

They offer both tasting menus and pre fixed menus (discounted to $55 if you're staying at the Venetian or Palazzo and have a coupon book) that are done in a reasonable amount of time (~1 hr) if you have a show to catch or something.  I opted to just try some of the food a la carte and was pretty happy with my meal.  I ended up getting the bone marrow ravioli and the broccoli which both combined was just over $40 (not including tax and tip).  They originally brought out the wrong side and gave us potatoes, but let us keep the tables on the house and gave me my broccoli shortly afterwards.  However, by then, I had already finished my entree so by itself it was a little salty.  I thought the bone marrow ravioli was seasoned well and the pasta was cooked al dente to my liking, but it wasn't mind-blowingly-good in my opinion.  Other dishes on the table were the beet salad, gnocchi, and spaghetti with lobster.  Tried a little of those and they were all tasty as well, but once again, not blown out of the water.

(he's rarely home...)  and ""I'll never have you over for dinner.."" (err...) and ""It must be impossible to go out to dinner..."" (this is my point for the long personal diatribe...)  Yes, it is very difficult to go out to dinner when I finally get the opportunity to see my husband.  He does this for a living (I do, too) -- we love restaurants, they're our life -- we love food, we love checking out new places -- and yet, when they're bad -- OMG, we're in hell.  I guess because our opportunities together are so rare, so precious, so few -- it's very tough to go to someplace new -- mostly because if service isn't flawless, and he can't relax, it's a horrible miserable evening -- because we spend the evening critiquing it, how to fix the service, the menu, the food, the...

That said...B&B was our ""BIG"" family dinner -- the two of us, my mother -- his only night off during the holidays.  PRESSURE...because I'd not checked it out first.  We've eaten at all of MB's restaurants in NYC -- we're big fans -- they've been some of our most fun dining experiences together -- and he's relaxed.  We even got pregnant after one particularly fun night -- but I digress again...

We had a terrific meal.  A flawless experience.   A wonderful time.
We didn't take pictures of our food -- and it's a shame, because the plates were stunning -- equally stunning was the amount of food we were able to try on our first visit -- we covered almost every appetizer, most of the pastas...  the big winner favorite dish of the night -- hands down, the octopus.   Wow -- what a surprise.  

We also had the Lamb's tongue, the duck egg, the parm reg sformato, the pork trotter and the salumi.  Of this bunch, I could have taken a bath in the Sformato.  It was divine. 

Pastas:  we had the corzetti with rabbit, mint love letters, pappardelle with wild boar ragu and the lingune with crab and jalapeno and the chef sent us from his tasting menu the uni ravioli.  

Amazingly, my husband ordered more...the rabbit and sweetbreads -- I was officially done, although I had to try the cardoons (never had them before and it was making me crazy).

All I wanted at this point -- because we had reservations to go to Love after this (and I really just wanted to lie on the floor...) was a very large espresso and a limoncello...but noooo, dessert came -- salted caramel gelato, grappa poached pears, cheese, chocolate... 

Food coma is an understatement -- but every bite was truly delicious -- even though I couldn't eat for two days afterwards...I can't wait to go back -- and am planning to take my Mother again this weekend (we saw two cozy seats at the bar that looked perfect for an easy supper...)

I just wish I could deal with the drama of the strip (and had a larger bank account), I'd probably be much more of a regular.  

We watched them work every table -- we love their team service.  Yes, the bathrooms were lovely.  

The dining room decor was surprising to us -- how the designers can turn such an impossible space into a charming, romantic, intimate restaurant that feels ""real"" and not staged -- and like it's been there forever is amazing to me -- the magic of Vegas -- the heart of Rob Goldstein -- and eyes (and stomachs) of Mario and the Bastianich family and the wallet of Sheldon Adelson get my fondest congratulations and thanks!",-Fy91nyOFqPv9M_MaZ4W2g,6,3,5,uHwHp2fGFwdbErK7LXyXKw

However, it is pleasant to know that if we had a time commitment, they would expedite our food.

Portions were perfect and our waiter Kevin was knowledgeable about everything. I ordered the gnocchi and absolutely love it!

4129210,2011-01-09,0,GTR39A2jwNIS_NV8q2r_JA,"o.m.g.  Pure heaven.  Except the service was crazy slow.  But I bet everyone was just assuming we'd need to pace ourselves because, oh, we ordered the pasta tasting menu.  Sounds like death, right?

But it sooo wasn't.  Unless death = heaven (see comment above).  This was my first Mario Batali experience, and honestly, it only came about because my girlfriends + I had made reservations at Nob Hill Tavern, and they ended up remaining closed through Christmas.  So one of the girls said she'd had good experiences before with Mario, and off we went, after making a reservation for that night.  Um, and then proceeding to change the reservation about half an hour before we were due.  Um, and *then* proceeding to be somewhere between half an hour and 45 mins late for that one.  Hey, we're working girls, and something came up requiring some expertise!  (And if you knew our occupations, that's be much less dirty.)  But the hostess and staff were still good to us, despite our tardiness - maybe because it was 2 nights before Christmas, and either the night was slow or they were feeling charitable.

BUT: we skim the menu, and I am overwhelmed.  Personally, I've always gone to Italian restaurants with high expectations, and then, even if I love the food, inevitably think, ""Well, I could have made this.""

But none of this I could have made.  Which is *perfection* for me -- I never realize how high maintenance I must be when it comes to food, but ho.ly.cow, I've never been this blown away. I mean, still, and we had dinner on 12/23.

The pasta tasting menu is seasonal, and this time of year, featured game fowl. Or however that makes sense.  6 ""main"" dishes + two dessert dishes (not pasta, surprise!), which we had been assured would satisfy a healthy appetite, but not put someone in a coma. (Okay, that was paraphrased, but I was concerned because I really can't eat too much with the bebe, she gets unhappy with me.)  Each pasta was like eating air, I've never had pasta so good.  And I mean the pasta.  The sauces -- I think I had one outstanding fave, and a couple I loved, and the rest I enjoyed.  One of my friends asked what we could do about the duck liver ravioli, bc I'm not supposed to eat liver --- our server said he'd check with the chef, AND THE CHEF SAID I COULD SUB OUT FOR WHATEVER DISH I WANTED!  Talk about overwhelmed! Luckily, the server had a rec already planned -- boar ragout? done.  And my fave, by far.

Okay, no one can possibly still be reading, but I'll have to say thanks for these next possible treats: a guy dropped by in a fancy suit to clear a little of our table away, and had some dead-pan, real-guy charm -- not the snooty stuff, not the shmoozy stuff, just real.  Basically commented on the tacky tacky shirts I made the birthday celebrants wear (who doesn't love rhinestones?), and asked what we were in town for + celebrating.  The girls are shy and had only agreed to these outfits if we'd lie + say I was getting married -- and with our cream velour outerwear, it was possible. And I heart weddings, so no prob.  But with the guy -- I came clean and said we were actually celebrating birthdays, plural.  Simple enough conversation.  BUT THEN, before our 7th course (or maybe 8th), our server came by with glasses of the *best* bubbly I have ever sipped (bc I only had a sip) -- Moscato d'Asti, and -- noting I wasn't having any wine -- also a glass of a mango-strawberry frozen concoction.  AND the last dessert had ""Happy Birthday"" written on *all* of the plates in chocolate sauce - I love that attention.  Even though I was the only one not really celebrating anything :D  Whatevs.

Loved it: food, service, attention to detail.  Most extravagant meal I have paid for in my life, but I can totally justify it.

And this is terrible of me to throw in at the end, but I can't figure out where to insert it: we were also ""allowed' to add an extra dish to our tasting menu, meaning we got to split it 3-ways: the white alba truffle pasta.  We asked the server to ask the chef how to squeeze it in, and we were surprised it came first.  But what a fantastic, delectable way to start.  Airy.  Truffle-melty.  My only experience with truffle, but it.was.amazing.",jJsEURuPmW059FAKHZQvvw,1,0,5,1guOk6dApatQxA0xhodYQg

My only misgivings about this place is two--finding it in the rat race of the Venetian.  Second, because of the first issue, it felt a little like a high end restaurant experience in a mall.  It's too bad there wasn't a better, more prominent spot that was easy to get to in the Venetian.  Compared to, say, SW or Andrea's, Costa Di Mare, Sinatra or some other very nice restaurants located within Wynn/Encore where you can easily find the restaurant and you do t feel like it's a mall environment, B&B did, and therefore the 1 star reduction.

Normally, the $50/plate kind of restaurants are incredibly pretentious and as a college student who can't afford these kind of meals as often as the rest of the people dining there, it really sucks when you can't have fun with your friends and talk during your meal.  Last time I went to a nice restaurant, my friend and I were almost whispering but at B&B, they had the Beatles playing in the background, the waiters were coming by to chitchat, and we even got complimentary samples from the chefs.  We didn't feel out of place at all and the 5 of us girls had a really good time.  

The food was amazing.  The octopus appetizer which all the waiters recommended was delicious.  I never knew octopus could be prepared so well.  We ended up getting 2 pastas to split as a first course and then we each got 2nd courses.  It was ridiculously filling. The pastas were amazing - whenever I see homemade pasta or homemade noodles anywhere on a menu, I have to get it.  I also had rabbit for my first time, kind of felt bad due to the cuteness factor of rabbits but damn, if I ever have rabbit, it would only be at B&B.  It was prepared in 4 different ways and served on one plate and it was so good!!

I liken this dining experience to a movie that everyone raves about, should be good and you set your expectations very high only to be let down hard. B and B was not only not good, it was overpriced too boot! I don't think there is a foodie out there that does not mind spending any amount typically as long as the entrees are well prepared. Here is the breakdown of my meal so you can compare:

ANTIPASTI:

Beet Salad: One of the better dishes. The marinate had a touch to much vinegar. The pistachio with the beats was excellent however!

Warm Lamb's Tongue: Really bad. I love lamb. Almost every part. Haji Baba in Arizona does wonderfull lambs tongue for $6.00. Haji blew away B & B on every note. The tongue was sliced so thin it was almost unrecognizable. The Chanterelles had very little flavor. A poor dish.

Grilled Octopus: While every flavor hit, it would have been nice if the octopus was cooked properly. The Octopus was dry and fibrous.

PRIMI:

Beef Cheek Ravioli with Black Truffles and Crushed Duck Liver: I LOVE fresh pasta. It should be cooked properly. Al Dente it was not. It actually was hard, absolutely undrcooked! The Beef Cheek was lacking creaminess. The crushed duck liver was not crushed duck liver? It was pureed tpgether with an overly salty beef stock. No earthy chocolate notes from the black truffle was present.

Bone Marrow Ravioli with Osso Buco Ragù: The worst dish of the evening. I'm a Bone Marrow aficionado and this was DISGUSTING! What was inside the undercooked Ravioli was BONE MARROW FLAVORED OIL. The Ravioli was like a Gushers fruit snack. Hard and chewy outside with an disgusting burst of oil inside. TERRIBLE. I actually told the waitress how bad it was and I my comment was dismissed instantly. Basically our waitress turned my statement into a MY PROBLEM, not hers or the restaurants! I had every Ravioli on my plate minus two and she did not offer a replacement or to remove from our bill. The Osso Buco was not Ragu. The Osso Buco was minimal in size, with large anounts of chewy, unrendered fat.

Spaghettini with Garlic Chives, Sweet Garlic and One-Pound Lobster: The pasta was toothesome and cooked perfectly on ONE order of this dish. The other again was undercooked. The Lobster was not sweet, although plentifull. Some was translucent and inedible. The sauce was simple, not a lot going on HOWEVER, I did really like the natural subtle flavors and freshness of this sauce.

We were all very dissapointed! Skipping dessert was a first for me but we did indeed skip. Man, what a fucking let down. Really bummed out! As far as the movie review, it sucked. It sucked worse than Glitter!!",TXSqa_4aKgc-s0QbaoaLzw,3,0,1,EdXXU3K3gtHAYVC7cpSP7Q

For starter, I ordered the Three Beets Salad. I love beets but I did not appreciate this dish at all. it was bland and tasteless. i think Batali's focus on this dish was to showcase the different textures of beets but, he did it in a way where it fell flat. There were no other components here other than beets to give this dish a bit of dimension that it so desperately needed. Next up, I had the salmon over a bed of cucumber salad.

First of all, they messed up our reservation, which I'd made on Open Table months before our arrival. Once that was untangled, we were seated near a bachelor party that was incredibly loud and rowdy- at one point, one man was dragging another around the dining room in his chair. We asked to be moved and while this request was accommodated, it was done so with much huffing and sighing by the staff. 

Eventually, we were seated appropriately and able to order food. It was perfectly adequate for a steakhouse. But if I'm going to travel over 2,000 miles to visit a restaurant owned by a world famous chef, I believe the food should be more than simply adequate. We dined at 7-8 restaurants over the course of our 3 day weekend and I documented each meal exhaustively. The fact that it wasn't until dessert that it occurred to me to take a photograph shows just how...meh...the food at B&B was. 

The icing on the cake was the poor service. At one point, our server came at sat down at the table next to ours to visit with a friend who was dining. We had to wait through their 5-10 minute long conversation before we were able to receive the attention we needed. That was frustrating, to say the least, when one considers the price of the meal. A mediocre meal can be saved by fabulous service. Unfortunately, we experienced neither at B&B. 

The best thing I can say for it is that my spouse loved the fact that the background music included Nirvana and Nine Inch Nails, and that he discovered a new favorite beer while we were there. Was it awful? No. Would we return, or recommend it to others? Also no.

Pappardelle Bolognese as our primi. Beef Short ribs, pork chop, and hanger steak for secondi, along with sides of broccoli, and roasted fingerling potatoes. The antipasti were good, although executed with an overly complex blend of flavors to our taste. I found the pasta to be bland. The hanger steak was very good, the short ribs good, the pork chop not good at all, extremely under cooked in one part, over done in the other. The potatoes a bit dried out, broccoli was actually fried broccolini. Service was excellent. For a high end restaurant, the culinary experience was very disapointing.

4214458,2015-03-01,1,GTR39A2jwNIS_NV8q2r_JA,"Long story short, I ended up going here two days in a row.

Night 1 - Went with a large group. Waitress was spot on and service as a whole was solid. In fact it was borderline invasive at times, but that's ok. The waitress told us that the octopus appetizer would be the best thing we ever ate. None of us felt that way after eating it. It was definitely good, but not even close to the best thing any of us ever ate. I wish she didn't oversell it because I would have preferred ordering something else. We also got the calamari as an app and that too was good not great. Best thing about it was the cauliflower. The waitress also brought out some bruschetta  with a chickpea spread. The spread was meh and the bruschetta was so hard it would have cracked a tooth or cut up my mouth so I did not eat it. For my main course I ordered the black spaghetti. Again, good but not great. Of the 7 people at my table (a couple being foodies) no one was overly impressed by the food. As for dessert, that was an abject failure. Nearly everything on the menu was made with blood oranges. Maybe some people like those, but I am repulsed by the taste. No dessert for me.

Night 2 - For an app I had the gnocchi w/ wild boar ragu. This was pretty good. I got the braised short rib. Definitely decent, but it tasted no better than a neighborhood restaurant in my home town. I'd have expected more from a place with two accomplished restauranteurs. 

One major sore point for me was on both nights, each server pushed me to drink. The waitress on the first night did so in a funny and passive aggressive way and that didn't bother me much. However, on the second night the waiter we had acted coldly towards us when no one ordered alcohol. What a turn off. 

Bottom line, I've been to much better restaurants with a whole lot less pretentiousness  and that were much cheaper. Granted, the ingredients at B&B were top quality and the experience is on par with any fine dinning experience, but the most important thing, the food, was short of impressive.",8f90R210eQ7cYSW3BLJHHw,1,1,2,0ZEhEdTAJEH-Pb4hostUpQ

I don't eat any of this stuff"" but if you are willing to broaden your horizons a bit and aren't scared to sample octopus or rabbit, for example, you will have a one of a kind experience.

I started out with the goat cheese tortelloni with dried orange and wild fennel. I admit that this was a safe order and I could have branched out a bit more...but I love goat cheese and pasta and it definitely didn't disappoint! I also sampled the grilled octopus which I feared would be a chewy consistency but it wasn't at all. I thoroughly enjoyed it and would recommend it to anyone, even those who don't consider themselves to be adventurous eaters.

I was so looking forward to coming here and so excited to try the pasta tasting menu. It was an expensive and bland disappointment.  First off, the wine menu is all Italian and overly priced. We spent over $300 for two bottles of mediocre wine.  

Our server although pleasant, seem bored and uneducated with the menu.  I can see why.  Our table decided to do the pasta tasting menu. What a disappointment!  From the bland, first course tagliatelle through the ending of the undercooked budino, I was underwhelmed.

The tortellini was medicinal, the pyramids and beef cheek ravioli tasted extremely similar, and we didn't get the foie gras ravioli. Instead we got a super spicy squid ink spaghetti.  This actually was my favorite course because I adore very spicy dishes. But only two people at our table of eight could eat it because of the spiciness and it pretty much killed my palate for the rest of the night.

Now for the last two courses, which were dessert (not pasta of any type), it was a steep downhill.  I really thought the chef could've been more creative and incorporated some type of pasta in both of these desserts to stick with the theme.  But instead there were two completely uneventful and downright disgusting desserts.  The first one consisted of what tasted like store-bought pastry and a toothpaste consistency of lemon spread on top.  After everyone took one bite, no one finished it at our table.  And the budino, as stated before, was an undercooked mess.

Our entire table was so disappointed and I felt I was to blame since I wanted to go here.  Never again and I will not recommend it to anyone.  With a restaurant named after two well-known chefs, I expected more talent and taste over the hype.",oMRsIYkl75scsYPcamB45Q,1,0,1,QdfToKR_VuBA1B1-DsGiNA

Cons:
Overstaffed - I know we beat the pre-dinner rush (when I'm sure they are needed) but the amount of hovering waitstaff was annoying and intimidating.
$6 hot tea? You're kidding right?
Pretentious menu with little translation - I almost felt like I was bothering the waiter by asking but I seriously had no idea what 80% of the menu said - I'm not an idiot either, I can usually figure it out but here I was clueless.
Lengthy wait time for food - ok I know B&B is supposed to be a traditional Italian style meal with a leisurely pace but the wait was excessive.
Very dark! It was like sensory deprivation and I didn't like that.

Pros:
Perfectly cooked pork chop - exactly how I asked for it (""not pink"" despite the dirty look I got from the waiter for the request), was probably one of the most delicious pieces of meat I have ever had.
Really excellent flavor pairings - they obviously hone their combinations to perfection here, the food love is apparent.

Dunno if the pros outweigh the cons but I probably wouldn't make a return trip here. Meal was very expensive! Over $110 for two people.",ir689oBNmrJXOspb4yq_Jg,3,2,2,KMRZK3mLsyI9KO37j6IHwA

We got pork belly and grilled octopus as appetizers. Our waitress didn't lie, they were delicious! However she also pushed the special entrée on us which was a lamb saddle dish for two people. She said that this dish is available roughly once a month, is delicious, 'a special treat' and that the restaurant prepares for weeks before the lamb cuts are delivered. The couscous that came with the entrée was decent. My companion liked it even though I myself thought it was just ok. However, we both agreed that the lamb was NOTHING special. In fact, compared to a regular hole in the wall restaurants in NY where a lamb dish would cost $20-$30 dollars, this was well below average. We were both disappointed especially since our waitress hyped it up. And the price for the dish was $95, well above all other entrees on the menu, even considering that it was a two-person sized entrée.

4382430,2016-07-07,4,GTR39A2jwNIS_NV8q2r_JA,"My husband and I were celebrating our anniversary over the weekend and wanted to find something different since we usually lean towards steakhouses. We enjoyed Carnevino a few months ago and thought we'd try another Mario Batali's restaurant. The overall rating almost turned me off, but I'm glad we took a chance on B & B.

I made a reservation on Open Table for 6:00 on Saturday, but I don't think it was necessary. The restaurant didn't start getting busy until we were finishing up with our dinner. We were seated inside the restaurant at a small table. The seating inside is a little tight, but it wasn't too bad for us since the restaurant wasn't busy at the time we were there.

Our service was friendly, attentive, and unpretentious. Our waitress gave us a nice overview of the menu, tasting menus, wine menu, and specials. She gave us a good idea of what was available without being pushy in any way. Sharing is even encouraged since this is a popular dining style in Italy we were told. Our waitress and her assistant were constantly refilling water, offering bread, clearing plates, and checking on us. They did so without being obtrusive. 

To start the meal we were brought a Chickpea Bruschetta. The crunchy bread with the tapenade and the chickpeas worked together so well. I was surprised how much the flavors popped in this starter. We were also brought fresh bread and oil (hold the balsamic for my picky eater). The bread was warm and crusty, the oil was a quality oil with bold olive flavor.

I went for the Pre Fixe Menu since I knew I wanted to try several items on the menu. The Pre Fixe Menu servings are smaller than the a la carte portions. All courses together it still ended up being more than enough food for me. 

The Butter Lettuce Salad was earthy and the bitter greens on top were almost overwhelming to the other flavors. Almost overwhelming, but the lemon vinaigrette dressing was refreshing and the paste under the butter lettuce was delicious. The Orecchiette was delicious and perfectly al dente. The spicy pork sausage sauce was delicious and had the perfect amount of spice. Our waitress confirmed that most of the pastas are made in house which was evident in the taste. Next up was the Steak Tagliata which was well worth the upcharge. The well seasoned, perfectly charred steak was generously portioned. It wasn't the most tender steak I've had, but the flavor won me over. My husband kept stealing bites of the edges with that perfect char. Lastly, the Pistachio Chocolate Chip Cannoli. I was surprised that this came with two cannoli. The shell was crispy and the filling was light with a nice pistachio flavor.

My husband started with Garganelli Bolognese which had the most tender, flavorful noodles. This was the dish that tipped me off to the homemade pasta. The Bolognese on top was delicious and meaty. His main entrée was the Rabbit Porchetta. This was flavorful with the perfect ratio of meat to fat. I don't eat rabbit and I'm glad that my husband made me try it. Wow! This entrée was also a nice portion with six pieces of the porchetta. The dessert of choice for him was Gelato which was creamy and a light sweet to end the meal.

As if al of the other food wasn't great enough the meal ended with a plate of small sweets. Sweet indeed. Great food and great service!",3nIuSCZk5f_2WWYMLN7h3w,6,4,4,COXgNhRr2ojtX31e8KwogA

Hmm...wonder what two items are my favorite?  I'm really sad to see the negative reviews for this place. I've been here 5 times and it is always consistently good. Sometimes we sit at the bar and sometimes inside. Service has always been wonderful and the food has always been top notch. 

If you want more laid back and there aren't a lot of you, I highly suggest sitting at the bar. Jason the bartender is great and remembers when you when you return. Even the other one I've seen there is great but just don't see him as often. You order off the regular menu. 

First off, the grilled octopus antipasto to start off with is great. Don't bother sharing. You'll want this one all to yourself. It's not a lot if you look at the pics. It is so tender. The grilling is excellent. I just can't say enough about it. Just get it. Ive never had octopus like that and probably won't. It's unique. 

Next off is their gelato. OMG!!!  So much better than anything I had in Italy and I ate A LOT of gelato in Italy. The only thing that beat b&b's was the homemade white peach gelato I had on a wine/olive oil tour. Flavors change seasonally at B&B so you'll always get to try new ones. 

Their primis (1st course pasta dishes) have never let me down. So far we've tried 4 of them an have always been pleased. The bavette, gnocchi with summer veggies, linguini with clams, and one more that I can't remember the name of are all good. Because they are only meant as a primi, potions aren't the normal huge size. Like the Italians, they keep the portions manageable. 

I can't say enough about how great this place is. The service is always good and the food is excellent. Some say the prices are high but I think they match the high quality food and experience you get. It's worth it. I rarely give 5 stars to a place.

3.  Being pushed for the $120 pasta tasting menu repeatedly.
4.  Believe a 20% mandatory gratuity is OK for parties over 8, regardless of level of service.

My husband and I went with Mario's Classic Pasta tasting menu.  It was a 7 course tasting menu, 5 courses of pasta and 2 courses of dessert.  Our service was impeccable!  Our waiter was knowledgeable, helpful, friendly, informative, and funny.  The assistant waiter was awesome.  He was in charge of making sure our water was full, we always had bread, we always had new silverware for each course, general chit chat and just to make sure we were completely taken care of.  They made you feel ""important"" and very well taken care of. 

As we were presented every course we were given a detailed explanation of what we were about to eat.  Additionally, if we had questions about the course they were happy to discuss more details with us.  The staff was extremely knowledgeable about each and every dish and were extremely friendly.  I can honestly say that each and every course we were served was unique and delicious.  The dishes were served from a lighter sauce to a heavier sauce which I thought was a great service method.  

My favorite pasta course was the Goat Cheese Tortelloni with Dried Orange and Wild Fennel Pollen.  It is truly hard to explain just how incredible this dish was.  The pasta was so tender, the goat cheese filling was light yet extremely flavorful.  However, it was the orange that made this dish.  The hint of orange paired so beautifully with the goat cheese.  It was truly special.  

My second favorite course was the Handrolled Pasta Sfoglia with Sage Pastry Cream.  When I saw this on the menu I wasn't quite sure about the Sage Pastry Cream.  WOW!!  It was spectacular.  I have never enjoyed a cream more.  Our waiter called it a pre-dessert as it starts getting your palate ready for a sweat dessert.  It was perfect.  

The dessert was a chocolate budino that was absolutely heavenly.  It was light, airy and oh so chocolately.

What was to be a surefire great meal turned into a disappointment little by little. 

First, we started with the octopus. They have the same thing at Carnevino and it was delicious at B and B as well. It was cooked very tender, and the lemon sauce complimented the octopus very well. This item is a must. I highly recommend it. 

Then we went with two of the suggested pastas - Orecchiette with spicy lamb sausage and rapini and the Spaghetti with sweet garlic, chives and lobster. When I had the Orecchiette at Carnevino, it was one of my favorite plates even though it's more of a steak place. I knew B and B's Orecchiette wasn't the same dish but I still wanted to try it. The pasta itself wasn't cooked as well, where it felt more mushy than chewy. The flavor was just fine but nothing memorable. The Lobster Spaghetti was more of a disappointment. The noodles were a bit under cooked, and the chives and parsley completely overpowered the flavors. I was left feeling I could make something better at home and that's not the experience I want if we are spending $30 per plate. The portions of the pasta plates were fair, if not a bit on the small side. You'll definitely need an appetizer. 

We winded down with some cheese for me and espresso for the BF. I'm not a goat cheese fan but most of their selection is goat cheese, so I opted for the Tre Latte which was a blend of goat, cow, and sheep's milk. It was very good. They give you a complimentary box of mini desserts at the end so keep that in mind. 

In the end, everything about the meal and service was good except for the main entrees. Sad to say as a pasta lover but B and B's pasta did not impress me. I left me wishing we went to Carnevino instead.",Wez_YoTdzSxsBWPvx-leaA,1,1,3,2tWHXacZgpYvI0DQvHtWFQ

There was a decent crowd, it wasn't packed, but there was enough people. It was a Thursday night. The restaurant itself had an intimate vibe to it. Nice decor. We had the assistance of 2 servers but yet I had to ask a busboy twice to re-fill our waters. 
I do give it one star for my wine. It was a red blend which costed me $40 for ONE glass. It was pretty good though. I ordered the Bucatini ""all 'Amatriciana"" ($25). It was ok. My 4 year old nephew would've loved it and still would've been hungry. Red sauce with some pork and noodles. Just wished i had a little more of it. Maybe if we were given some bread prior to our meal, that would've helped. Every table around us got bread, but us. I don't know, they probably judged us because we were wearing our sneakers. After being dressed up all day since 10am in a dress and heels til 6pm for wedding stuff, maybe we needed to wear sneakers to rest our feet and just relax. Maybe??
Service was extremely disappointing for the amount we paid. Our bill was a lot less at Delmonico's and we ordered multiple rib-eyes and received much better service. Out of all the places we ate at on the strip, this was by far the worst when it came to service, quality, and food.

The pickled olives, onions, and radishes were a lovely touch.

We had the pasta bolognese and the lobster spaghetti.  My bolognese was wonderful.  The pasts was VERY fresh, and the flavor was good, even if the portion wasn't very big.

The lobster pasta was just GREAT  There was quite a lot of lobster in it, the flavor was nice, but not so overpowering that you couldn't taste the sweetness of the lobster.  The pasta was lovely, and the garlic chives on it tasted like they'd just come out of the garden.  Simple, clean, EXTREMELY fresh, and good flavors.

This was the only restaurant I did not look up at all before visiting Vegas, and I can say my co worker and I were disappointed.

The complimentary chickpea bruschetta was nothing to write home about - it was okay, but a bit salty. Glad I did not choose it, personally.

We both chose to eat light then order more if we felt we needed it. Our waiter praised the bone marrow ravioli with osso bucco ragu. We tried it. On top of being like eating a tough lemon and parsley gusher, the meat was extremely fatty and just tasted like bad pulled pork, to a point I almost thought they pulled some pork and served it, knowing no one would notice in the dim light. My co worker got the same meal, and the look on her face when she bit into the ravioli was just utter disappointment. We chose not to get any wine or dessert since the meal was so disappointing, but some complimentary dessert was brought out anyway. The chocolate covered cherry, which tasted like the cranberry raisinets, was the best thing. The chocolate cake was dry and bland, the biscotti was meh, and I have had better meringue bought at the grocery store, sadly. And I do not love grocery store meringue cookies or anything.

Roasted Kabocha Squash-- had a roasted pumpkin seed pesto, burrata, and some frisée on top. Burrata was milky with a tough skin. Squash and pesto did not mesh well. 

Garganelli-- pasta was perfect al dente and fresh. The mushroom medly was well seasoned. Could not taste the fancy butter/butter sauce. Missing the wow factor.

Yet I found myself here on a regular night after an evening at The Smith Center. And you know what? Totally worth the splurge. 

B&B is the creation of chefs Mario Batalli and Joe Bastianich, which is irrelevant except that now when I watch Master Chef and Joe says something is worthy of his restaurant, I appreciate it more. Regardless of that, this place is awesome. 

The atmosphere here is amazing. I mean, from the moment I approached this restaurant from the Palazzo side to the moment I was greeted by the lady at the front, it's a win. The hostess was great about looking up our reservation and getting is seated in no time. Walking into the place, you're greeted by an atmosphere that is modern Italian (does that make sense?). Our waiter approached us and told us a little bit about the restaurant and took our drink orders -- we each ordered an Italian beer ($14/beer, I believe) but I forget their names. Both beers were great, but not great enough I'd like another one for $14. We each ordered entrees (again, not remembering their names) and both were delicious and well worth their price tag. The food did not take too long to come out, which was great. We were finally treated to a cheesecake-type dessert with berries. It was pretty damn amazing. 

We met one of the managers after dinner and told him how much we loved the place. He informed us of something we had taken note of: real Italian food in the eyes of the chef-owners should not be swimming in cheese and sauce like at some other Italian places. The food should be good, simple, and clean. That was certainly the case!

All in all, this place was awesome. I paid $160 total for our meal, including our tip. I'm generally opposed to any dinner for two that's more than $80, but this place was worth me spending a few extra dimes.

OK, I was intimidated by the $$$$ in the review profile (this ain't no Mozza).  But, you can still have an outstanding meal with a pretty good market value without feeling abused.  A romantic laidback place with music from Stevie Ray Vaughn then Prince makes for a comfy place.

We were hungry but split everything, as we often do. You know the portions are gonna be ample, and this way, you can try more things to sample. And though their policy is not split stuff, just ask, it's no big deal. They'll be happy to do it.

The Spaghettini with Spicy Budding Chives, Sweet Garlic and One Pound Lobster was simple yet soo good. Imagine a light arribiatta sauce, yet when I mentioned as much to our server, well, she had never heard of arrabiatta. Oh well. In fact, our server was fine, but we loved the teamwork provided by (what musta been) the manager, who kept the momentum of our meal and seemed to offer good information when asked.

We also had the Branzino, which I see 50% of the Yelpers also enjoyed. 'Nuff said. We loved it, and it was plenty big to share. We also enjoyed the side of squash---normally not a squash fan--and it sounds better than just 'squash'.  And it was perfect. 

Ended with the warm chocolate budino, a nice way to go. Their coffees were great; wine was divine, and their martini was made to order and a better deal than the same in L.A.

Have the sommelier recommend a wine. He presented a fantastic quality and good pairing on both occasions. Anyone not an Italian wine expert probably won't have much luck with the menu anyhow.

Mario Batali's restaurant in The Venetian is a completely spectacular dining experience. It's expensive, but totally worth it.

I went with a group of 11 people and we were treated like kings and queens by our extremely articulate waiter and the sommelier. Our waiter said most groups order a few Antipasti dishes, a few pastas to share family style, and an individual entree... we decided to go ""all in"" and followed his instructions. 

Antipasti;
Tripe: delicious. Tripe might not be everyone's cup of tea, but people who don't like it are missing out on quite the amazing cup of tea.

Ramp: This was a vegetable I'd never had, but it's a lot like a green onion. Served with delicious, fresh mozzarella. Very fresh and tasty.

Crispy Pork Trotter: These are basically Crab Cakes, but made with Pork instead of Crab. And they are as awesome as that sounds.

Beet Salad: Even this was incredible.

Grilled Octopus: The restaurant's signature antipasti, this was completely epic.

Pastas:

Spaghetti: Made with a full pound of Lobster, the sauce is made from the reduced juices. So good.

Black Spaghetti: Dyed with squid ink and Sicilian Pesto, this was subtle but delightful.

Bone Marrow Ravioli/ Calf's Brain Ravioli: These both had extremely different textures and flavors, but they are also both Raviolis stuffed with meats that make some people balk. Don't balk, these were both amazing.

Mint Love Letters: Stuffed with Lamb and Sausage crumbles, these probably won the award for best of the pastas.

Entree:

I went with the Lamb Chop. Served on the bone with grilled Peppers and Romsco sauce and cooked Medium Rare. Unbelievably tender.

I also tried my friend's Taglietta, served with Salsa Verde, which was perfect.

The Persecco and Red Wine we ordered were absolutely amazing as well. We had no room for desserts so we just ordered Espressos at the end of the meal, but our server still brought us a complimentary cookie platter since we were there to celebrate a couple birthdays for the meal. Nice of them, though our meal did come out to over $1200 so I'm pretty sure they didn't lose much by bringing us cookies.

All of the food was amazing, and our very enthusiastic server took us through every item step by step, explaining what was great about all of it. He used the words ""awesome"" and ""spectacular"" a lot, but he wasn't wrong... the entire B and B experience was incredibly awesome and spectacular.

We also asked for a quiet corner to sit in. They sat us in the wine cellar and it was wonderful! We got to look at all the amazing wines and it was very quiet. There was one other couple seated there and another empty table for 4. Out on the main floor the restaurant was pretty busy, but in our little corner...everything was quiet. 

Our waiter, Kevin (I think), was relatively new, but was great. He explained all 5 menus (we were there during a special fundraiser) and was prompt with bringing us water or bread. 

For our appetizer, we had the: Prosciutto di Parma ""Galloni 30 Mesi"" with Black Pepper ""Fett'unta"". It was very good. Although, it's hard to mess up really good meat like that. 

My husband had the Beef Cheek Ravioli with Black Truffles and Crushed Duck Liver for his primi. He loved it. I tried a bit and found it a bit too ""beefy"" for my taste. 

I had the Goat Cheese Tortelloni with Dried Orange and Wild Fennel Pollen and loved it. It felt rich and light at the same time. The portions were a little big for a primi, but overall, no complaints. 

For our secondi, mu hubby had the Crispy Polenta Sweetbreads with Roasted Hubbard Squash, Wild Mushrooms and Apple Agrodolce. My goodness, they were amazing!!! I was really amazed at how good they were! They were like chicken nuggets, but more crunchy and flavorful!!

I had a special of pork ragu and penne pasta. I was really disappointed. It was too salty and lacked flavor. This is why they are getting 4 stars instead of 5. Ragu and pasta should be pretty easy for an Italian restaurant to get right....

Also, be sure to ask for tap water and not bottled....they charge 7 dollars per bottle of water! But you can get free water...if you want. 

Several other reviewers have discussed the bread and how disappointed they were in it. I found the bread to be very good and very Italian. I felt like I was back in Italy when I bit into it. Good Italian bread has a hard crust and chewy interior. While it was served cold, it tasted very fresh and authentic. 

All in all, our tab was about 150 dollars (before tip) which was about what we expected.

4647981,2013-05-23,0,GTR39A2jwNIS_NV8q2r_JA,"As Las Vegas locals, it's not often we find ourselves going down to the crowded and overpriced hotels on the strip but when we do it's usually for a restaurant.  We never intended on eating at B&B and it ended up being a pretty good experience, however not one that I would do more than once.  My wife and I went down to the Venetian to meet someone who was staying at the hotel for a drink.  We initially set out on a hunt for a bar with a good vibe and possibly some appetizers.  After walking around for a bit we didn't see anything that caught our eye and we were getting hungrier so we ended up at B&B based off of the looks of the place from the outside.  I wouldn't say it was anything special but it looked like a decently nice place that would certainly suffice for what we were after.  We were sat immediately (6:30pm on a Monday) and upon looking at the menu we realized we had picked a pricey restaurant. Here's the quick pros and cons...

Pros:
- Service staff was very friendly and informative.  We all have gluten sensitivities and they were very accommodating.  Not to mention there is quite a bit to choose from that is gluten-free and they offer a gluten-free pasta that they can substitute if you decide you want a pasta dish.

- Wine list was excellent, but pricey.  The wine list was completely in Italian with only Italian wines from what I could tell.  We fancy a Super Tuscan and the cheapest bottle on the list was $135, however even the cheapest bottle is a high end excellent wine.

- The food was very good, no complaints in the taste department.  We started with the salami plate which they charger per person.  We ordered it for 2 people and it was more than enough for all 3 of us.  For the entree two of us got the grilled pork chop and one went with the rabbit.  The portions were decent size, perfect in my opinion, but may be considered small by some standards.  We all had gelato for desert and some flavors, like the lemon, were a little disappointing.  The espresso flavor was excellent though.

Cons:
- Lack of less expensive options on the wine list.  I didn't look at the entire wine list in great detail (it's huge), but from what I saw there wasn't a bottle under $125.  They had a very limited selection of wines by the glass as well and I think most of those, if not all, were North of $15 each.

- The meats section of the entrees was a...unique selection of proteins.  Rabbit, quail, veal, lamb, etc. If you're like me you loved the variety of things you don't see on a menu often but if you're like my two less adventurous companions you're stuck defaulting to the pork chop.

- Price price price.  Our bill came out to around $100 per person not including the bottle of wine we bought or tip. We each had a salad, we all shared an appetizer (salami plate for 2), an a la carte entree, and a gelato dessert.  It was a decent amount of food but if you're really hungry it wont be enough.  And although the food was well done, it wasn't mind blowing.  There are dozens of other restaurants in Vegas with better ambiance, equal food, great wine lists, and much lower prices.

Conclusion:
You will enjoy a great meal but you will pay too much for it.  The only time I would suggest this restaurant to someone is if they were staying in the Venetian/Palazzo, didn't want to leave the hotel, wanted a nice Italian dinner, and money is no object. Aside from that exact scenario there are much better choices in Vegas.",bmtYwrBx-SGlreZfB0C-cQ,0,0,3,jakYPICxm_84ZepSrhG8hQ
4654168,2014-09-21,0,GTR39A2jwNIS_NV8q2r_JA,"The only reason giving two stars is because the staff went above and beyond to make it right and the salads were delicious. 

As I mentioned above, the salads were amazing. The wine selection was also very good although not inexpensive. 

As a huge fan of Master Chef and observing Joe Bastianich critique the home cooks, I anticipated much higher standards. When Joe is displeased with one of the dishes he tastes he makes quite the production of spitting the food into the garbage. This is exactly what we wanted to do with our meal. My husband ordered the orecchiette which was so extremely salty it was inedible.  Our server informed him the dish was salty however this was inexcusable. My pork fusilli the same however for being under seasoned. 

Needless to say we will not return to B&B and suspect to try any of the other restaurants owned by this not so dynamic duo.",ylJbvxe38cTcVq2g4N2afA,0,0,2,WquLMyUoToNT8yLLqgWr1A

I must say the food was very good but did not knock my socks of like Bobby Flay's Mesa Grill did for example.  I had the homemade Orecchiette with sweet sausage and rapini.  This was an enjoyable dish and pasta was cooked nicely.  The sauce was not as packed with flavor as I would have expected and overall it was a little salty.  I forgot to mention I started with mixed greens salad where I think every leaf of lettuce underwent an individual seasoning exercise.  The salad was nice and crunchy and fresh but again a little too salty.  My wife started with baby octopus which she said was cooked absolutely perfectly but was a little salty.  She then finished with linguine with clams which were very nice but also salty.

I have to say fellow yelpers nailed this place when they said 80's rock and roll which was very inappropriate music was the norm and this place is very pricey and dishes are over-salted.

Nothing blew me away.  My main dish was the whole striped bass which was quite good, but unfortunately had to be eaten with the skin on, which is not my preference (for possible health concerns of eating fish skin - the taste is great though).

In the end, my wife asked me if it was worth the price (since it is pretty darn expensive) and the answer is no.  Would I go back?  No - unfortunately.

The Good:
We were greeted and seated promptly.
The food when eventually served was yummy!
(Blue crab ravioli, the Americano, and the spicy lamb ragu.)

The Awful:

Jeffery NEVER inquired how our food was or if we needed to add anything to our order.  I had to repeatedly ask our ""water girl"" for refills on drinks and a cocktail menu. At one point I requested an additional glass of wine and it never came. I had to order it 2 more times before it eventually came.

The blood orange martini was a sweeter choice. Both drinks were made with fresh fruit ingredients. My meal was the gnocchi with peas and Pecorino. I have to start by saying that the portion sizes were very small. We made the mistake of coming here to just grab a bite before the show, not knowing you really need to have a three course meal to have enough to eat. With that said the gnocchi and the bucatini all'Amatriciana were excellent. This is one of the few times I have had pasta that has been salted appropriately when cooked. The gnocchi had a delicious cream sauce with fresh peas. I did not like that they were stingy with the bread. They brought you one slice at a time. I realize this is gourmet dining, but it would not hurt to put two pieces per person as a serving. There was a small complimentary appetizer of bread with a chickpea topping.

Saturday night in Vegas and although we had other plans for dinner a last minute call convinced us that being the guest of the yet unopened B&B might be interesting. B & B is the latest restaurant venture from Mario Batali and Joe Bastianich of Babbo, Otto, and Lupa fame. 

If you've eaten at any other of Batali's restaurants you'll have high expections of top notch authentic and creative Italian food. Batali and co. have done Vegas right by creating a cool joint that is classy and does the near impossible by making you feel transported out of the the desert mayhem that is Las Vegas. The dark walnut walls, crisp white linens, and of course Batali rocks the Zeppelin. You gotta love someone who has the balls to match Zeppelin with fine dining and make it seem effortless and obvious. Of course we're gonna rock fine dining! 

For the primo, I had the Baby Red Oak Leaf salad. I was actually expecting Mario to have concocted some crazy way to prepare oak leaves, thankfully it was a varietal of lettuce that was like no lettuce I ever tried, rich and flavorful. 

For the secondi, I tried a few items starting with the Stinging Nettle papardelle with Wild Boar Ragu. This was spectacular, rich and well balanced, the nettle doesn't really impart much flavor, but is a nice counterpoint to the boar which provides most of the earthy flavor.  
Next up the Beef Cheek Ravioli with Crushed Squab Liver and Black Truffles. Oh my God, yes this was a spiritual experience. * without any hyperbole, this was hands down the best pasta I've ever eaten, better than anything I tried in Tuscany *  And that's not the hangover talking. Two or three other well travelled guests agreed. I think it might have been the squab liver that put it over the top. 

For the secondi, the Brasato al Barolo, essentially bone-off short ribs on polenta with fresh horseradish. As you can imagine, rich and decadent, melts away with every bite and the horseradish provided a nice sharp counterpoint to the richness. 
Next up the Fennel Dusted Sweetbreads which made me feel smarter immediately. At least smarter for trying them. Crisp on the outside, tender on the inside. Possibly Mario's tribute to the chicken nugget. Unbelievable, who knew brains could taste so damn good. 

For dessert,  being in the desert, I felt like some thing rich but also refreshing, and the warm chocolate cake with mint gelato did not disappoint. I could have eaten twelve of these if given the opportunity. The housemade caramel gelato was also pure decadence.

The wine we had was ""house"" wine, and by that I mean Bastianch's Italian wine company and Mario's personal Italian label. Not a bad glass among the bunch. All exceptional.   

Starting off with raspberry bellini's, the wine was paired by their som to match our choices for the 4 courses. Each wine was excellent. I thought for my shortribs, I could have used a slightly bigger wine with more acid to cut it, however the sangiovese blend was still excellent. 
We went through probably 8 to 10  bottles of wine. From prosecco to Rose, to the final Moscato and inbetween, all matched up great with our food.  

Overall, B&B is going into the Vegas rotation, fun, cool, classy, incredible Batali food, incredible wine and I don't need to fly to NY. 

Now I just need to send word that San Francisco needs Mario too.",g2YnG8VUb9opaWF6fx6viQ,6,7,5,zkeMh-BT-wNTVp95QWAO9A
4840947,2012-07-18,0,GTR39A2jwNIS_NV8q2r_JA,"The thing I cannot complain about at B&B is the food and service. We had dinner on a Thursday night and everything were ordered was outstanding. I started off with the warm goat tongue with truffle shavings and porcini mushrooms, which was superb. The tongue was very tender and the greens + mushrooms provided a nice contrast...add in a poached egg on top, which you are instructed to cut into and mix the yolk into the dish and I was in heaven. A rich, complex dish with flavors that piqued your imagination at every bite. The truffle shavings were quarter-sized and although maybe it could have been considered too much, I enjoyed every last bite of this dish.

For my entree I ordered the beef cheek ravioli, which was recommended by our server. Again, a truly wonderful dish, wich beautiful texture, and a rich sauce. The homemade ravioli was not over stuffed, and displayed a brillant balance. I also had the pleasure of tasting the pork chop, which was also phenomenal. I typically shy away from ordering pork chops because I find many restaurants, even higher end ones will frequently over cook pork chops, but B&B delivered an outstanding, perfectly cooked pork chop bursting with juices and flavor. I really don't think I've ever had a better pork chop!

My only complaint about B&B was the sommelier. I thought she was a bit pretentious and tried to steer us to more expensive bottles without asking questions to see what our budget was and what qualities we wanted in our wine. She didn't seem as knowledgeable as I would expect, and was not able to describe some of the wines in as much detail as I would have liked. I do understand that the wine list is huge and would be practically impossible to memorize every wine, but she seemed to be more interested in pushing the higher priced wine than finding the right wine for our budget.

All in all we had a fantastic dinner and I would almost certainly return. I just hope the goat tongue is still on the menu on my next visit!",nJm0FoEIPlNCbyjtpmjfOQ,1,0,4,dC5aYJrwyc-osn2pM3QOFg

I ordered a martini but the bartender decided he had something better in mind and asked if I liked blueberries.  I said yes, so he made me this very interesting cocktail but he never thought to ask if i liked all the other ingredients that were put into it (basil, balsamic, etc... yuck!)  It ended up not being bad but for $17/drink I want something that I would actually enjoy. 

Next, onto our meal.  At first the service was very prompt... taking our drink orders,  bringing bread to the table along with a complimentary appetizer.  We ordered the beet salad to share and two pasta dishes as our entrees.  The salad was delicious considering I'd never eaten a beet a day in my life.  Then it happened, the turn for the worst.  We sat and sat and sat some more.  About 45 minutes from the time our salad was finished to the time the pasta's were brought to our table.  During that whole time we were approached by our waiter approximately zero times.  We didn't get a refill of our bread and the water refill was only one time.  For the price of food you would expect better service for a nice tip.  I even complained to the waiter and he didn't even offer an apology, just a mere ""well it's very busy tonight and the kitchen is backed up"".  Well it would have been nice of you to let your customer in on that say, 30 minutes ago.

It was basically my second time at a restaurant of this caliber, but the staff was there to guide my fiancee and myself along every step of the way.  They had a sommelier that helped us choose a wine off of their EXPANSIVE list that worked for both of us.

The waiter was very knowledgeable about the menu and gave good recommendations so that we could make educated choices on what we were ordering.  They were also very attentive to what was going on: I had dropped my napkin on the way to the restroom.  I picked it up and placed it on the chair. When I returned there was a brand new one folded near my utensils. Great stuff.

I strongly recommend that you follow whatever the ""chef's recommendations"" are.  They really do add a new dimension to the flavor profiles that are in your food. This increase in complexity definitely lets the food go the extra mile so that at the end of it all, when you receive that massive check, you realize that it was completely delicious and wish all restaurants tasted the way B&B does.",109TBEivcWj_U23f1mwnCg,0,0,5,ob5wVSk8w8FPqub4IzWR-A

Since we were staying in The Venetian, I had been eyeing B&B Ristorante being that we are all huge fans of Mario Batali. Overall, the experience was so poor that it will be memorable. Since my sister was the only one ordering food (my other sister and I had eaten earlier in the evening), we decided to sit at the bar. The restaurant hostess refused to seat us at one of the small tables at the entrance which were all vacant. So we sat at the bar, were handed menus, and then left to wait...a very long time...without being acknowledged by the bartender who managed to acknowledge and take orders from all of the men who sat at the bar after us. Led Zeppelin's greatest hits were BLARING ( I kid you not!), and after we were finally able to order my sister's entree and our drinks, we were left to wait for probably at least a good 30 minutes before our Blood Orange Cosmos appeared with the glass of wine that my sister ordered to go with her Bolognese Paparadelle. This should have been our cue to walk out, but being to tired from a day of trudging around the strip we were all to exhausted to take action and get fired up. When our tiny Cosmos finally arrived, they were indeed delicious. However, when my sister's thin slice of a flute baguette topped with chick peas showed up on a small side plate that dwarfed it, we are agreed it was indeed an ""amuse bouche"". Very funny...joke's on us! At some length, the Bolognese Paparadelle showed up. Again, a huge white plate with a serving of pasta that looked more like an appetizer. No bread, no nothing. All this for a mere $28. Finally, a slice of bread (really!) was brought to her when she was half way through the pasta. Her plate from her ""appetizer"" was never removed. I joked with my sister that because there was a tiny speck of sauce left on the plate that the restaurant staff thought there was still a serving left. My sister left hungry, and we all felt assaulted by the music and insulted by the lousy service. The microscopic portions of food were good (I would hope so...it is Mario Batali's restaurant).
I tried to send this feedback directly to B&B, but there is not email contact provided. Needless to say, won't be back, and I certainly do not feel compelled to visit other Batali locations.",0OhVdj2ZC5uiZmMV_39Ilw,1,0,1,fIuEjI0ikBDT5fgVp2h0nw

We ordered the pasta tasting menu and split a single reserve wine pairing.

First, the service all around was excellent.  The server and his staff were very knowledgable not only about the meals themselves but of some of the history of where the originated.

First course was the tortellini minestrone.  It came in a small amount of broth.  Nothing too filling and tasted great.

Second course was tagliatelle, sweet corn and crispy pancetta.  Awesome, the flavors and texture really worked well together.

Third was my wife's favorite, raviolini.  They are ravioli but quarter size and filled with a very tasty braised pork shoulder. This came with a small amount but very powerful heirloom tomato sauce.

Fourth was a ragu with a variety of stuff .... Pork, hearts, liver, etc...I am not normally a big fan of the hearts and livers but actually found this to be the most flavorful and tasty dish of them all.

Fifth and final of the main dishes was black (squid ink) spaghetti with a moderately spicy sausage which somehow reminded me of chorizo.  It was good as well but we are getting full.

Finally, their were 2 deserts.  A strawberry sorbet and chocolate souffle.  Both were awesome.  The chocolate souffle was extremely fluffy.

The wine pairing was excellent and well chosen.  All red wines which we enjoy very much.

One final note, we have ventured here on a prior occasion where it was an extremely slow night (I cannot imagine they have to many).  We simply asked for the chef to prepare us something off the menu and were very satisfied.  This can make for a very enjoyable experience at any restaurant willing to make the effort to please, which they are.",jnzSmMrhgTZTgdgvSmZxbQ,0,0,5,6t1efJKbBM7-XKT1DY8wCA

Since we had to catch a show w/in an hour, we were pressed for time.  The price point was fair, ambiance was casually elegant, and it's a Mario Batali establishment... so what could go wrong?

Well problem was, we left still starving.  It was mainly my fault, I should have known better.  At a nice casino restaurant mid twenty's to thirty dollar dishes gets you nothing.  Pasta portion was small, and the protein in the dishes were meager.

We cut to the chase and ordered only entrees.  My Spaghettini came w/ chives, garlic and a One-Pound Lobster for $32.  Wow, what a deal right?  Imagine my surprise when I got a fistful of spaghetti and a few bites of tail and claw.  I swear, this does not look like it came from a one pound lobster.  I do have to admit it was titillating to the palette.  The pasta was cooked perfectly.  The spiciness of the chives, the sweetness of lobster and garlic, combined with the savoriness of the sauce was gratifying.  I wished I had more of it.

My brother's gnocchi w/ braised oxtail didn't give him the same response.  It was $25, seemed like there were more of the oxtail ragu than actual gnocchi.  He did state that they were soft like pillows.  Just the ragu was not to his liking.

Oh, we did get an Amuse Bouche: bruscetta w/ chickpeas & olives.  Which was good and finely salted.

We made it to our show, barely.  Didn't enjoy it much because I was hungry again 30 minutes into the show.  With many great options in Vegas, it's unlikely I'll be back.",0_flT2OUiuHe7OAdRVVrdQ,2,1,3,A640yyMipxYXRa4GzgO8tQ

We said no problem and sat in front.  I was surprised when our server was the hostess not at full waiter or waitress like they have if we were allowed to sit in the restaurant.

The ""waitress"" told us we were not allowed to order off the dinner menu but order off a special non-dinner menu which had a fraction of the appetizers available.  She took forever giving us water and for some reason brought out two different types of wine glasses for similar types of wine.  The appetizers finally came, but because it was a few of them for three people they had to join another round table hence this is why we wanted to sit inside.  Oh and we had to ask for napkins and silverware as they forgot that too.

Since Mario doesn't have any restaurants in Chicago I couldn't wait to try his Vegas offerings.  We had wine and appetizers at Carnevino, which we couldn't have been more impressed with, and then came here for dinner and dessert.  I was glad we we went to carnevino first for drinks because the bar here was essentially in the foyer and no one was there at all.  The tables were uncomfortably close together and that combined with the multitude of servers made dining there sort of weird, I felt like I was constantly interrupted and couldn't help but overhear everyone's conversations around us.  Our first course of goat cheese, fennel pollen and orange ravioli were amazing!  Next came the mint love letters which just couldn't have been any more disgusting.  My husband LOVES lamb and mint and they were so bad he had half a bite and couldn't get any more down.  We obviously didn't eat the rest of it and when our server came over and asked us what was wrong he immediately removed them and couldn't have been any nicer.  The manager came over next and apologized and offered to help, and then two glasses of prosecco arrived.

I walked in ahead of my (late arriving) group and sat at the bar for a cocktail.  Frank made me a KILLER Old Fashioned, BTW.  I asked what his favorite thing on the menu was and he immediately said the octopus.  Right on the money, as we had two of them at the table and it was amazing.  We also all shared the artichoke salad (good), the beet salad (excellent) and the calamari (best I've ever had).
I had the bone in veal chop.  It was cooked to perfection and went great with the Barbera recommended by our waiter.
Most of the rest had pasta of some sort, all of which I tried were outstanding.
I would happily recommend this to anyone visiting Las Vegas.

We decided against wine and went with some very delicious mineral water. Overall the service was excellent, we let them know we only had 2 hours to eat and they got us out right on time. In addition our water glasses never ran out & they folded our napkins every time someone went to the bathroom etc. The server was extremely helpful when we were trying to decide between ordering a la carte and the tasting menu. 

We decided on the below: 

Starters: 
Grilled Octopus (amazing, slightly over salty for me) 
Grilled Porcini Mushroom w/ Spicy roasted corn (A must order, a fantastic combo perfectly cooked and seasoned) 
Lambs tongue w/ chanterelles (earthy and delicious) 

First course 
Beef cheek and mushroom ravioli (hearty, very intense meat flavor, not my favorite of the dishes although still quite good) 
Spaghettini aka Spaghetti w/lobster (slightly spicy, very light and fresh tasting, pasta perfectly al dente, lobster also perfectly cooked. Not exactly the most inventive dish but absolutely perfectly executed) 
Oxtail Gnocchi (another very hearty dish, very meaty, well executed, but not my favorite as it was a little too rich for my taste) 

Second course 
Steak with spicy greens (forget the cut, my friend really made us look like amateurs when he ordered it, he kept on saying to the waiter to make it charred, the waiter offered to have it extra well cooked, but then my friend said to make it medium but extra charred on the outside and waiter rightfully had some questionable look on his face. The steak came med to med rare, it was quite good, I really prefer mine more rare so hard to say more. Also was a very large portion.) 

Duck (came as med rare roasted breast over a stewed leg, huge portion, especially for the price ($32), very good but wasn't blown away either) 

Veal Chop (EXCELLENT, you must order this entree. I don't have enough great words to describe it. We got it med-rare, it was perfectly cooked and came with some sort of creamy herby sauce stuff. It was the best meat I've ever had. By a huge margin. It's also a large portion of meat (approx 10-14 oz I'm guessing) served on the bone. Again, just in case I didn't make the point clearly enough before, if you are in Las Vegas, and you eat meat, you must at least come here and order this dish.) 

Dessert: 
We had a berry Napoleon something, it was the berriest thing I've ever had. Served with some cold lemon ricotta, I highly recommend this dessert. 

Also, a vanilla flan like dessert with some caramel sauce. It was good but cannot compare to the berry dessert. 

Cappuccinos here are excellent. 

Just a note on the table size, I did not find it too large, but we did order a good portion of food and I was not trying to play footsie under the table.

In my dining experience, Mario Batali can do no wrong (my favorite restaurant is Carnevino), and B&B did nothing to change that.  A group of 4 of us had dinner at B&B on a Saturday around 8:00.  They were doing a brisk business, but the place certainly wasn't crowded.  There are a ton of employees, so if you needed something and couldn't find your exact server at that moment, there was always someone to help out.

We spoke with the somm about some wine options and she recommended a nice barolo that was on the lower end of the price range.  The wine list was good, not the best I have seen in Vegas, but not even close to the worst.  And, the mark up was consistent with other upscale restaurants.  Wine isn't cheap on the Strip, but at B&B it wasn't more expensive than any other nice restaurants.

The chef provided an amuse bouche of marinated chickpeas on a crustini that the table enjoyed.  I started with the butter lettuce salad, served with pancetta, onion, and a gorgonzola dressing.  This salad was constructed very well.  Every bite had every ingredient.  The dressing perfectly coated the lettuce but was not overpowering to the point the leaves were wilting.  I would definitely eat this again.

For the pasta course, I had the Tarajin, a seasonal pasta with shaved white truffle, which they do table side.  This thing was impossibly creamy and bursting with truffle flavor.  An incredibly decadent pasta, I was very glad I came during white truffle season.  It was not cheap, but I would definitely eat this again.  I shared some of the pork trotter ravioli with the table, and this was likewise very good.  Covered in breadcrumbs and cheese, this was a very flavorful ravioli.  But, it couldn't stand up to the mighty truffles.  

For the main course, I had the short rib, served with polenta and shaved horseradish.  This was a good dish, but didn't entirely land for me.  The short rib was fork tender, as this cut should be, and everything was seasoned very well.  It just didn't completely come together for me.  This is what prevents me from giving B&B a 5 star rating.  I wish I could give 4.5 stars, but I can't so it's a 4 star rating.

At the bar, they have some fantastic, spicy breadsticks that you have to try if you end up going there.  They have a nice kick.

We decided on the following dishes for dinner (I have attached pictures):

Pork trotter on top of greens- I wasn't sure what pork ""trotter"" was and I didn't want to find out.  I was assuming it was feet but I was willing to give it a try.  I really didn't like this dish.  It was breaded on the outside and it seemed like it was filled with potatoes and pork fat. Bleh.  Don't get this.

Spaghettini with Spicy Budding Chives, Sweet Garlic and One-Pound Lobster $31-  For $31, I expected there to be a lot more lobster on the plate.  Where did the one-pound go?  The spaghettini was perfectly cooked al dente, but that's all I can say about it.  

Homemade Orecchiette with Sweet Sausage and Rapini $23-  This is the dish I ordered.  Half of the table liked it, but I found it to be extremely salty and average.  

Linguine with Clams, Pancetta and Hot Chiles $26- Average.  This dish was salty too...guess they forgot that the pancetta would make it salty as well. 

Grilled Pork Chop with Cipolline, Artichokes and Vin Cotto $34- The pork chop was very good, probably the best dish we ordered.

I really wanted to like this restaurant, but it didn't do anything for me.  The prices were expensive and the portions were small.  The taste was off in my opinion as well.   There are much better choices for dinner in Vegas.",mmgiD9RKnAasJorjSqmpNA,3,1,2,ppGQcDRq3R8vVcRAcJUTKg

My boyfriend's brasato is super tender, but makes you wanting for a more savory and robust flavor.  My linguine was cooked to perfect al dente.  Both dishes are toward the saltier side of the saltiness spectrum.  There were missing clams from the clam shells (lol.  this is arguable, I might be buzzed from the strong margaritas)

I feel that they could use better service and friendlier, more attentive waitstaff. There's only one attentive wait staff that religiously poured water in our half-emptied goblets.  Kudos to him.

Also, I don't think there's a need to change utensils every 10 minutes for a restaurant that claims to be certified Green.  Emeril's Table 10 on the second level could easily outperform this place with flying colors--without changing utensils 4 times!",H1NTty9Nbsnfgtv-DTcAOA,0,0,2,oskeRr-MiYYl1VuUnhk0aA

Per usual for me, I order the tasting menu.  The pasta tasting menu, as B&B has two tastings.  I'd hope to detail each course for Yelp member but visiting B&B a few course have changed, and the tasting included a lot of ingredients, in particular proteins, I hadn't eaten before.  However, I can tell you that the  complimentary bread given to each and every table is terrible (burnt purposefully),  the goose liver ravioli with balsamic vinegar and brown butter was very good and the 6th and 7th courses, the two desert courses, left much to be desired.

The casual but elegant dining and service were very much to my liking, including the Queen music playing at B&B's adjacent bar.  And, the service was exceptional, as I had expected it to be.

I ordered that here and for 22 dollars, I felt that it was not any better than my Costco mozzarella I get.  The 2 week old olive oil was excellent on it, but I was not impressed.  My companion had the grilled octopus which he said was the best he has ever had at 18 dollars.  He has had some experience with grilled octopus with spending time sailing around the Aegean sea.  I had a chestnut pasta (I'm vegetarian) which was good, but was very small.  I doubt if there were 15 pieces of small stuffed pasta.

Menus are printed daily and have a variety of seasonally-inspired items.  A very tasty chef's complimentary starter was delivered, and some fresh, crusty herb-flavored Italian bread. 

We started with a summer bean salad with excellent flavor and variety of fresh ingredients.  My wife had the pork tenderloin, very tender and just delicious,  served with a killer sauce.  I had a fresh-made pasta with a rich shredded lamb sauce.  Both entrees were standouts.

We split a dessert that was a cross between cheesecake and creme brûlée, with some berries and nectarine slices on top.  As good as it sounds!

5094841,2017-12-07,22,GTR39A2jwNIS_NV8q2r_JA,"""Buonasera. Pronto per il buon cibo?"" begins the server.

""Il mio italiano è terribile Parli inglese?"" my instinctive response practiced throughout Italy.

""What?  I don't really speak Italian"" followed by a good laugh.  And that sets the tone for a meal that time after time I call the most authentic Italian outside of Italy.

To begin, a platter of house cured salumi.  From the well cured finocchiona to gently salty, lightly cured ""hams"" whose fat literally melts on your tongue, to a sweet Earthy culatello, It's hard to resist picking them up with your fingers and popping slices into your mouth. 

For antipasti, the grilled octopus; tender, char adding complexity, a sharp, punchy limoncello vinigrette makes the oceanic aroma and flavor of the octopus explode.  The warm lamb tongue, near perfect.   Sliced lamb tongue atop vinegar imbued mushrooms topped by a three minute egg.  Break the yolk and mix, the result is a rich, creamy well balanced dish.  The gaminess of the toothsome tongue enhanced by the vinegar.

Primi (pasta course), is where the restaurant shines.  Bucatini all Amatriciana stunning simplicity.  Guanciale (cured pork jowls) and its rendered fat, tomato, chili flakes and pecorino lovingly coat very toothsome bucatini.  The cured flavor of the guanciale adds incredible depth, the acidity of the tomato balance.  The Cacio e Pepe, outstanding.  Pasta tossed with pecorino and a lots of black pepper.  The residual heat of the pasta melting the cheese and creating a rich sauce.  Booth the best examples I've had outside Rome.  

Special Note:  If the white Alba truffles are in season, the Tajarin is impossible to pass up.  Pasta simply coated with an acidified cream butter (gently fermented butter) and alba truffles shaved tableside at service.  The aroma alone can make you weep.  $80 for a dish this simple.  Yes.  And worth it. 

One secondi stands above all, the rabbit porchetta.   It looks like a rabbit sausage, the whole rabbit having been deboned, its front legs stuffed and back legs bent back into the saddle with the loin, all rolled up the fully cooked.   Golden brown on the outside, tender and moist on the inside.  The mild rabbit flavor enhanced by its own jus mixing with a vinegary pepperonata.  Dressed arugula adds playfulness.

Dolci if you must.  Keep it simple.  A plate of assorted biscotti (delicate aroma and flavor, the orange hazelnut epically good).  Perhaps an amaro to close.

Service is very good with servers obviously having been chosen to be able to deliver Italian service.
Good wine list with some gems.  Typical Vegas resort markup.

Tip:  Order the cheapest wines on the list.  Still som selected, it's gonna be good and allows the food to shine.

To those who have been to Italy, this place takes you back.  To those who have yet to go, here's your taste.",oeAhRa8yFa9jtrhaHnOyxQ,30,24,5,SWTSkHikROrITvtzrYBBQw
5116074,2011-09-01,3,GTR39A2jwNIS_NV8q2r_JA,"Ok I need to preface this review by saying a couple of things.  First, it was a larger group, second there were two and then a few more potentially buzzed/intoxicated members of the party and three we were all really tired from traveling all day and setting up for a trade show.  OK preface done!

Not being a frequent visitor to the Las Vegas area, honestly its just too much for a simpleton like myself, when I am there it is generally for business and/or trade shows.  I got a call from one of my friends to meet up with her and have some dinner at this great restaurant at the Venetian, B&B.  Learning that it was one of Mario Bitali's restaurants and a fan of Italian wine (oh yeah BTW I am a wine maker) I was quite excited!!

We get there, table is not ready nor are all of our party so we head to the bar.  Drinks ordered .... Negroni consumed.  Probably the best Negroni I have ever had!  Tick tock, still waiting for the rest of our party.  Now with most everyone here they seat us.  Realizing that they did not have enough seats at the table we informed the waitstaff.  Once the balance of our party arrived at the table still without the needed seating the manager came over rather gruff and threw up his arms and walked away muttering not so sweet nothings under his breath.  But I do need to qualify that statement by saying that are late companions were feeling the side effects of drinking Vodka Tonics.  

We order the wine, sans any real help the Sommelier other than ""yeah were are out of that one but if you like Barbera there are more on page so-and-so"".  Gee thanks guy.  

Our waiter was a bubbly guy who reminded me more of a mad scientist from an old western movie with his big moustache and insane enthusiasm for his job and food.  He takes the orders and assists where he can.  Being sure to compliment us on our orders (I dont understand that move) and briskly rushes back to the waiter cave and put the orders in the hopper.

Tick tock, tick tock waiting for apps to arrive.  Tick tock.  I know that the Molto Mario Empire want the world to experience the way that Italy eats but when you are with a group with some members who are more the burger king crowd one would think that the staff would adjust their schedules to turn the table.  Oh well.

Apps arrive, good - not great - good.  One not so good dish but our enthusiastic waiter fixed the situation.  

Wine is running low ....... Mr Sommelier where are you.  Oh there you are, gliding in and out of the room looking down your nose at all the tables.  Um we would like our wine now please.  But you keep walking by ignoring us.  Sure we are a big group, sure we are talking and having a good time but no need to ignore us. Hey man not all of the public are ignorant.  Oh yeah I also like how you take two oz pours to check for tainting.  I wonder how the person buying the $1400.00 Super Tuscan feels when they see you taking $80 out of their bottle?

So before we could contain our now intoxicated friend walks to the wine station grabs our bottles and briskly brings them to the table.  Now everyone on staff is aghast with jaws on the floor and the look of ""I cant believe that fat guy just did that"" written all over their faces.  Oh bother, great now we are going to have issues.  Surprisingly no one said anything, the waiter simply brought a bottle trivet over to protect the already stained table.

Tick tock, tick tock.  Secondi would be nice.  Ah there is our enthusiastic waiter again, lets ask him.  ""They are plating them right now""!  Yippie!!!  Plates arrive.  Again good - not great - good.  Steaks are chewy and medium rare became very rare somehow and the polenta crusted sweet breads were interesting to say the least.  Something about raw polenta and cooked polenta as a crust for sweet breads does not work for me.  Maybe I dont get it?  

Exhausted with the evening we decide to skip dessert and just get the heck out of dodge.

All in all the dining experience was OK.  Perhaps a smaller crowd, perhaps a more refined crowd, perhaps a less intoxicated crowd?  Either way, its Vegas!  People drink and there are large crowds.  Maybe, as I stated earlier, the staff should recognize when they should rush a table out and not stick to the corporate dining model?  

To the waiter and the water/bread waitress .... you are saints for dealing with certain elements of our table.  To the management , relax.   To Mr Sommelier, people skills go a long way and maybe it is time to not take yourself so seriously.

Would I be back ..... maybe but keep it small and simple and dont come with high expectations.",wexuWioPIJ4hcFaxrJLJjw,2,1,3,N2Ebrv3lCMLglYvGTfFwNA

-Service is very prompt and attentive.

First experiencing Mario Batali's cuisine on an off-chance reservation at Babbo during a fateful trip to Manhattan in June of 2008, where the Chef and his team delivered a memorable respite from life's unpleasant moments, and having since dined at several Batali & Bastianich establishments from coast-to-coast it surprises me even as I write these words that it took me so long to visit Venetian mainstay B&B Ristorante - a pre-theater four-course dinner with a friend again proving the restaurateur's abilities to source the finest people and ingredients for his ever expanding empire.  Clearly influenced by his famous space on Waverly Place, both in design and in offerings, but differing slightly in vibe as a dimly lit room with R.E.M. playing gently overhead was complimented by lovely service from a young woman named Kelly our meal began with the staple-amuse of tender, spiced chickpeas on crisp bread and with proper bread service replenished frequently thereafter not a single bite of the food that followed would prove short of exemplary.  Eschewing lighter 'spring' flavors in favor of signatures until later in the meal our first course arrived with creamy pate of pork delivering plenty of spice and sapor while tender tripe compensated for its small portion with textbook texture and complex aromatics - a trend carried over to each $26 plate of pasta; the raviolis averaging approximately $4 each but so delicate, stuffed, and well sauced that it hardly seemed to matter until the plate was wiped spotless with plans to return for the pasta tasting menu swirling my mind.  Transitioning smoothly to things more substantial it would be an exercise in futility to determine whether the rich, caramelized-yet-rare spring lamb over smoky artichoke puree or the nutty roulade of rabbit with flan of carrots was a superior secondi and finishing with dessert both the simple peach presentation and an atypical soufflé-style budino showed the pastry kitchen's prowess - a Babboesque box of petit fours and a double espresso sending us to theater with full bellies and broad smiles.

Obviously prone to complaints of discrepancy in price-to-portion ratio for ""Italian food"" that many claim to be offered at a better value from their local mom n' pop joint a meal at B&B Ristorante is better taken as a ""Fine dining"" event rather than any regional cuisine - not only does the sourcing, preparation, and presentation deserve it but so does the service.  Certainly not a cheap meal as the average diner is unlikely to exit for less than a Benjamin suffice it to say that for a 'celebrity chef' meal on The Strip B&B delivers where many mail it in, a similar sentiment applicable to Palazzo's Carnevino, though the latter is ever so slightly a better 'experience.'",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,8,7,4,WWSabtoL1UvhoSwUVoZYVQ

We decided to get the pre fixe plus wine and it turned out to be $250 for two after tax and tip (not bad at all). The white wine I ordered was also REALLY good. The service was also top notch! 

I had the grilled octopus and short rib. Grilled octopus is one of my favorite dishes and this one did not disappoint! The octopus wasn't chewy at all and was grilled nicely. I had a bite of the calamari and that was also delicious! The orecchiette was very flavorful, but a tad heavy IMO. The pork agrodolce was a little too salty, but still very good. My short ribs were the best thing I ate that night! They had a good selection of gelati and sorbetti and that made it very difficult to choose what I wanted. I forgot what flavor I settled on, I think vanilla (?). I remember it being ok. We also had the panna cotta, which was forgettable and not that great. They gave us a tray of sweet goodies at the end from the pastry chef and that was a great way to finish off our dinner!

5323135,2014-01-15,1,GTR39A2jwNIS_NV8q2r_JA,"This review is a little biased as I had the meal comped at a trade show. Accordingly, it was awesome. We were able to splurge and enjoy a full range of antipasti, primi, secondi, contorni & wine. Our bill for seven people came out to $1180, which did include $400+ in wine, so not horrible for a Michelin-caliber restaurant.

What's funny is when you walk up to B+B in the Venetian/Palazzo Restaurant Row, the 'Beer & Burgers' aspect of the name stands out, as the facade appears to be little more than a 'nice bar.' We were a bit apprehensive as the host had us wait a few minutes - wait, are we really taking these important clients to a burger bar? - but once we walked inside the restaurant, it had the feel of a upscale comfort venue. Cozy, dark wood set the mood, offset by the white cloth linens and an upbeat serving crew, which included an in-house sommelier. We basically let the service run the show, and they treated us well where we had the best grilled octopus I've tried (absolutely tender; barely charred and so luscious), crispy pork trotter, calimari & seppie fritti, gnocchi, capellacci, country style pate, short rib ""al barolo,"" veal chop & spaghetti with freshly shaved white truffle. For dessert, the marscarpone/blood orange & tiramisu were both standouts.

Music was a ridiculous mix of tears for fears and Duran Duran.  In a supposedly fine dining Italian restaurant?  What idiot has made this decision?  Whoever it is, fire him.

Second, we did order the lobster spaghetti which was terrible, with two pieces of lobster in a bowl of sauce that if I closed my eyes, I would have sworn that I was at a Sbarro.  And the worst part, THE PASTA ISN""T FRESH!!!!!!Did you hear that people.  Thirty dollars for two pathetic pieces of lobster and dried pasta????  It is Sbarro!

The Ravioli was wonderful with a silky smooth marinara sauce that was work of art.

I came back the next day and ordered the Burata dish. OH MY GOD this dish was incredible. I have been craving this dish for day after now.

Dimly lit, romantic restaurant. Wonderful staff, wonderful service. Even loved the modern music they played for ambience. But the food didn't hold a candle to Carnevino.
We started with a few specialty cocktails which were very good. We noticed a few similar items that both restaurants share. We wanted to try some different dishes. 
Before our meal we were presented with a Chickpea Bruschetta compliments of the chef...I'm not a big fan of chickpeas, but it was delicious. 
To start we decided to share the Housemade Ricotta with Olivestri Olio Nuovo and Tuscan Kale, accompanied by nice crusty bread,  the ricotta was so light and the oil and kale was so flavorful, they complimented each other perfectly.
We had Bucatini 'all'Amatriciana at Carnevino and it was so good, we decided to get it again and compare the two. It was not as good, but it did seem to have more bacon. We also got Jose's Pyramids, which are a sort of ravioli stuffed with short rib beef. The pasta was nice, the meat was a bit dry and bland and I didn't care for the sauce, I felt like it was missing something. So when I dipped one in the sauce from the Bucatini al'Amatriciana, it was so much better, they need to hire me.
We quit there and decided on some dessert, we shared one of the nights specials which was a Apple Crostini with Vanilla bean Gelato. The gelato was perfect, the apple crostini was good, but the sauce it was served with was a bit strong and overpowered the dish. We were presented with a complimentary dessert sampler of multiple tiny bites, I liked the Meringue and the Pistachio Chew. My husband liked the Chocolate cake.

Most of the dishes were spectacular, but there were quality issues that I thought were below the standards that a Batali and Bastianich restaurant would have.

The bread was terrible. It tasted like it had been frozen or it was straight out of the walk in. The crust was hard and rubbery, and the middle was barely thawed. It wasn't a good first impression. 

The chic pea brushcetta was passable. It was seasoned well, It tasted fine, but for an amuse bouche, it was boring.

The octopus appetizer was where things started to look up. It was incredible. The intense colors of the sauce on the plate made the octopus stand out. It was grilled to a perfect crisp, without a hint of rubbery-ness. It is the best octopus dish I have ever tasted.

My gf had the goat cheese tortellini and it did not disappoint. The pasta was silky and the combination of citrus and fennel contrasted the rich goat cheese perfectly. It was divine. 

I had the short ribs served with a creamy polenta and freshly grated horseradish. The flavors were all there but the short rib was dry, which was odd considering it was braised in barolo.

5450728,2015-08-08,0,GTR39A2jwNIS_NV8q2r_JA,"We were so excited to try this restaurant for my birthday dinner while visiting Vegas.  One of my favorite things in the world is Bucatini alla'Amatriciana and I adore Chef Mario Batali's recipe for this amazing dish, so I was very excited to see it on the menu.  The pasta tasting also sounded amazing so we were very excited.  

We were greeted with very exceptional service.  Specials were explained, questions were listened to attentively, and special requests were honored with grace.  Almost all of us decided to get some type of Prixe Fix menu.  
The cocktails were amazing, including the Italiano Mule (Blood Orange).  

They allowed me to try my favorite Amatricana as a replacement for the pasta course, but charged me an extra ten dollars for this replacement (they charge the same replacement fee for the LOBSTER pasta).  I was a little surprised as Amatricana is only about four ingredients and is relatively inexpensive to make.  Were they just charging for the inconvenience of having to make something off of the prixe fix? 
When the pasta came I was disappointed to see a large amount of whole parsley leaves.  Parsley is never and ingredient in this dish and it completely overpowered the delicate flavor of the guanciale.  It was not everything I had built it up to be.  
The short ribs were also disappointing, not enough sauce and served over very boring polenta.  I could not taste the horseradish at all.  

Our friends that got the pasta tasting had some exceptional pastas that were beautifully prepared and tasted delicious.  The octopus appetizer was quite lovely as well.

They very kindly brought me panna cotta with a Happy Birthday Message but unfotunately the panna cotta was absolutely awful.  It was not sweet at all and had the consistency of hardened paste.

5457819,2014-03-12,1,GTR39A2jwNIS_NV8q2r_JA,"Such an inedible and expensive disappointment. My husband and I ordered one of each tasting menu to share - pasta and traditional. 

My husband wanted wine with his dinner, but not the wine pairing, so the waitress sent over the sommelier. He asked what he could do to help us, then just stood there silently staring at us. After an awkward silence, my husband explained that he was having the tasting menu and wanted three glasses of wine total - one glass for every two dishes. The guy kind of shrugged his shoulders and asked what my husband likes, and answer which we both find infuriating. This went back and forth for awhile, getting nowhere, and finally we sent him away. My husband ended up asking the waitress to select wine for us, which she did, and did a good job.

In fact the service was pretty good other than the sommelier. Server was very nice, bussers were friendly, and they carefully asked us how everything was after each dish. However, they do this odd thing where they ostentatiously cover spills on your table with a napkin, accompanied by a lot of hand flourishes. This happened twice. It only draws attention to your table and I found it really unnecessary, but whatever. Otherwise good service.

The music, while good, is way too loud. We could not hear each other all night, and just ended up making gross-out faces at each other across the table, by which we communicated our disappointment in the meal.

We were served one piece of dry bread each with no dips or spreads or anything else at all to go with it.

As for the dinner:

First course:
Pasta - Tagliatelle. Bland. It needed more spices and flavor, though the fresh herbs were nice. The mushrooms were really good. It was not great, but promising.
Traditional - Veal. I liked this for the most part, though it was overly salted.

Second Course:
Pasta: Tortelloni. This was pretty good, though oddly sour overall with the goat cheese and citrus combo. At this point, I'm thinking this is not really that impressive, but maybe they are ramping up to hit us with the really good stuff.
Traditional: Tortellini in Brodo. This was the worst dish of the night. I have never been served such weird, inedible pasta or such a sour, mushy sauce. It tasted like ground up canned artichokes. This was so bad and bizarre that I actually thought it must actually be amazing - like it was the most beloved dish on the planet to little Italian grandmothers in Piedmonte - and I was just too ignorant to understand it.

Third Course:
Pasta Pyramids: The Tortellini aside, this is where things started going noticeably and undeniably downhill. The pasta was gummy, the beef cheek center was gritty and pasty, and the marinara sauce tasted just like Chef Boyardee. For some reason, I was still holding out hope. This is the famous Mario Batali, right?

Fourth Course:
Pasta: Beef Cheek Ravioli. Presented to me with the proud declaration that this is the dish that made Mario famous. I think, finally!, and dig in. Holy SALTY! I do not believe for one second that this dish made anyone famous, anywhere, ever. They are clearly butchering this man's food in the kitchen.

Fifth Course:
Pasta: Foie Gras Ravioli. I actually kind of liked the ravioli, but the balsamic sauce was overwhelming and ruined it.
Traditional: The salt level of this dish made the beef cheek ravioli look like bland baby food in comparison. Utterly inedible, dry as a bone, and greasy. My husband said they are trying to salt cure their clients from the inside like salami.

Sixth Course:
Pasta: Sfoglia. The best thing we ate. Quite tasty.
Traditional: Semifreddo. Boring. Odd texture.

Seventh Course: 
Pasta: Budino. Good, but let's be honest, its just your average lava cake.
Traditional: Panetone. A dry piece of crumbly bread with honey on top. So bad that it almost turned the night around since at this point we just started laughing.

I really do not understand the high ratings this place gets. The worst meal I've ever had in Vegas, and one of the most expensive.

We booked our table for early in the evening so we could take our daughter with us.  She was the only child in the restaurant, but that was ok with her.  She was very well behaved and patient throughout the entire meal.

We ordered a mixed green salad to start and it was simple and delicious.  I noticed they had polenta as a side dish with one of the courses, so I asked for some. Without hesitation, the server informed me that the chef would not serve a side.  When we asked for plain pasta, we were again informed that the chef would not serve it that way.

Note:  The server never asked the chef ... he just let us know that there would not be any accommodations or special orders.

So I ordered the beef cheek ravioli with truffle sauce.  

My meal was the the color of poo when they put it in front of me.  The ravioli turned the color of the sauce and it did not look good. I was not impressed and I was not inclined to eat much of it once I tasted it. Yuck. 

My husband and my daughter had the goat cheese ravioli and that was much better.  I was wishing I had that instead.  But the waiter never came back to check on us and eventually someone came to clear the plates away.  Bye Bye crap. No one even noticed that I did not eat any of it ... they just took it away without a second thought.

When the waiter did finally come back, we asked for the check. We asked if we could charge it to our room, and the waiter said that it would take 10 minutes to get the manager to approve it.  We pulled out a credit card instead of waiting since we were looking forward to getting out of there.  Just like other Yelpers said, it was disappointing, expensive and pretentious.

1. We have eaten at Mario Battali's NYC restaurants so we knew what to expect. At least we thought we knew.
2. This Grilled octopus appetizer that other people have raved about. The octopus was boiled too long so it was soft and stringy. Maybe we got a bad dish?? benefit of the doubt.
3. The ladies ordered the Black Truffle pasta. ($45). Both of them got cold pasta??? What the?? isn't this supposed to be made to order??? Then the paste was bland. They did shave truffles on the pasta table side but still flavorless. Remember the pasta showed up cold enough that is was starting to stick together.

Made a reservation on open table because I figure it would be busy on a Friday night at 5:15pm. It was not. Had dinner with the wife and another married couple. We like most people on here had tickets to a 7pm show, so we were kind of on a time constraint. 

The decor was elegant and had nice dark wood throughout. The menu to me read as this ""foo foo poo poo w/ a side of fennel something or other"". It was kind of tough to figure out what most of the stuff was on the menu. This is not their fault. It is mine for not speaking Italian. One could translate on their smart-phone if need be. I, instead was sketchy and chose something that might taste good. When the food arrived, it was great.

The waitress was knowledgeable about the wines and made us feel at ease for not knowing what a lot of the items were. She answered our questions without the attitude of ""omg, how do these ruffians not know what these dishes are?!"" That was a great feeling. 

I would come back to this restaurant again. I only took one star off for the amount of money we had to spend for food. Wife and I shared a meal, one salad, two cups of coffee, and one small dessert and it costs us just under $100 with tip.",KNzPnhclecYrzc3iuK6opw,0,0,4,2XsG85y0SDaHAhW_8wOyWA

The service is  very very very bad , the food doesn't taste great at all and their service is really really slow.

Our group was really really dissappointed with this restaurant.

The waiter that served us (including my boss, co workers and other clients) was very arrogant and was LYING to us from the beginning saying that we will make it on time for the Blue Man group show for ordering their Pre Theater show menu. At 6:50 pm we still didn't have our dessert, and our waiter said that ""oh don't worry the show doesn't start until 7:30 pm"". We all believed him and waited for our dessert .To end the story short, we were late and felt so humiliated during the show because they show bright lights on people that are late going into the Show.

Being the pasta fiend, we ordered 4 pasta dishes to share instead of any appetizers or entrees. It was hard to pick since there were about 15 different pasta dishes that all sounded awesome. I really loved the mint love letters - very different from what you would typically see at any normal Italian joint. The best way to describe it would be a ravioli filled with mint pesto. It was fantastic. The other dish that was very original and I can't totally recommend it is the squid ink pasta. It was super tasty but it was hotter than hell. I could not believe you could get food this hot at an Italian restaurant. And this coming from a girl who loves spicy food and has eaten thai chilli peppers raw and unadorned means it was fiercely spicy. Funny because the waiter warned us but usually when people say that its still not spicy for me. Boy was I wrong.

I have been to Chef Balali's Osteria Mozza on Melrose in Los Angeles a few times, so I thought I would try B&B on a recent trip to Las Vegas. Bad idea. Let me tell you... B&B isn't near to the same class as Osteria Mozza. 

The ambiance was nice. Comfortable. Had a familiar feel.

The service was... Lacking. I guess the question should be, was there service? Minimal. 

Homemade Orecchiette with spicy lamb sausage and rapini was fair, not what I would have expected from a Batali and Bastianich restaurant.
Bone Marrow Ravioli with osso bucco ragu was a little better... But still nowhere near mind blowing.
Whole Grilled Branzino with herb and fennel salad was HORRIBLE. The fish did not taste fresh and was a compete waste. Just plain bad.
Veal Chop with pancetta, spinach, and torpedo onions was actually the best item I tried during this visit. It it was just okay. Actually it saved them from a one star rating.

Usually, If I have a bad experience at a restaurant, I will give them a second chance. But this wasn't a minor issue, or one item that wasn't good. It was everything. From the moment I walked in the door. To leaving and heading back to Table 10 to eat a good meal.

Two buddies and I dined here during our last trip to Vegas, and I fulfilled a desire to eat here that was left over from my last stay at the Venetian.

First, the grilled octopus in limoncello vinaigrette. Great, great octopus. Amazing, firm, meaty texture without being too squeaky rubbery or unchewable. Add to that some great grilled flavor in that perfect dressing, with great citrus flavor...I'm hooked. The serving wasn't just tiny tentacles too - these were big meaty slices of octopus, pieces maybe an inch in diameter and several inches long, meaning you got a real taste of the meat. Amazing.

We started with the gnocchi with lamb and mint. I think this is what I want to eat just before I die. The gnocchi are I think the best I have ever had. Clearly handmade, perfectly tender with a slightly al dente center, with a rich tomato sauce, absolutely melt in your mouth braised lamb, and fresh mint leaves that were an unexpected but perfect compliment to the heavily savory lamb and broth. Simply and utterly fantastic.

After those two things, I feel like the meal could only head downhill, and so it did. But not very far. My last course was the slow roasted lamb shoulder, which was delicious - also extremely tender, fall off the bone with good flavor, but the cannellini beans were a bit under done. This was very good, but when you put it next to those antipasti and primi courses, I don't think anything could really have held its own.

We skipped dessert, as nothing really jumped out at us, but were treated to a fun little complimentary sweet course. One thing I forgot to mention was a little chick pea bruschetta to start the meal, which was very good.

I will say that this place can get expensive fast. Lots of good stuff on the menu and portions that are on the smaller side means the bill can add up quick. Is it worth it? Yeah, the meal I had totally was. But just, fair warning. Did we leave full? Yes, we did, but not stuffed. That's probably a good thing. All I know is, if I ever find myself back at the Venetian, I will not miss a chance to come back and repeat those opening courses. Holy cow.",tPufvUuxXLJOMYQ7gzsMVA,0,0,5,BGWtu_P-Q87xubj7fMv7Gg

When we arrived at B&B last week, Ian made us the most fabulous drinks ever - blood orange cosmo for me and old fashioned for my husband.  If only Ian could have been our server, the experience would have been so much better.  Ian told us about B&B whole animal program and a fabulous angus beef special.

When we were seated, our server David didn't tell us about the angus beef special that Ian had.  We asked about it, and David said since he was new, he just didn't know about it.  I'm glad Ian mentioned it because it was the best part of the dinner.  We also ordered the mozzarella and ramp appetizer, which was good but not great.  The ramps were super chewey and difficult to eat.  

For the pasta course, I ordered the mint love letters, and my husband ordered the bone marrow ravioli.  Both were really good, although I liked his a little better than mine.  For our entrees, my husband ordered lamb, and I ordered 2 minute spicey calamari.  I didn't want anything heavy, so David suggested the calamari and told me that it wasn't spicey really.  WRONG - it was very spicey and chewy.  So disappointing.  I would have mentioned this to David had he ever showed up again after we got our dinner.

He mentioned that Shania Twain was eating there somewhere, so maybe he was waiting on her too.  All I know is that we told David we had a show to go see 2 1/2 hours after our reservation, and he was not very attentive.  My husband's lamb was good, but the calamari was not very good.

I had no clue what half of the menu items were, and there was nothing on the menu to decode it for me.  I ordered the black spaghetti with sausage in pesto.   The sausage was in tiny flakes about the size of large grains of salt - literally.   And the price of this 7-oz portion of plain pasta with about a gram of meat (if that) was $26.  And it was too spicy-hot to eat, although the waiter did warn me that this was a spicy entree.  Now the dessert:  Figuring it was a nice seasonal specialty,    I ordered pumpkin & cream.   In all fairness, the menu didn't say anything more than that; I just had no idea that any restaurant would make a dessert that so literally matches the name:  it was a slab of pumpkin, carved right out of the gourd, perhaps baked for a few minutes, and served over some cream.  Looked like a big slice of cantaloupe on the plate, and had the firmness of - well, a slab of pumpkin carved right out of the gourd.

Atmosphere - 5 stars
Food - 5 stars
Service - 5 stars

Background - My wife loves these high end restaurants.  Add to the fact she watches 'The Chew' daily.  We had to go here because of Mario Batali.  The Vegas weekend getaway is our V-day gift to each other.  And I can not top it after this experience.

Atmosphere - The restaurant is dimly lit romantic atmosphere.  We sat at a table on the left side of the entrance.  

Food
  Drinks - A beer of course.  All their beers are Italian.

  My Meal
    Appetizer - It was compliments of the chef, two small pieces of breed cover in a medley of vegetables.  I could tell from this it was going to be a good night.

    Main Course - We ordered the seven course pasta meal.  For me, my two favorite dishes were the first two courses.  But the one that popped for me was the Goat Cheese Tortelloni.  I am a huge fan of stuffed pastas and this did not tell me down.  I could of ate this dish all night. 

    Dessert - Our seven course meal was nine when all said and done.  We had a pre-dessert and a dessert which was a budino, I guess that means spoonful Italian according to our waiter, but it was really a chocolate soufflé.  I was so stuffed at this point I could not even finish mine.  Wait there was more dessert, compliments of the pastry chef, several little samples.  Oh my I need a wheel barrel.

Service - Truly this what you come here for.  Okay the chef's amazing cooking.  So both chefs and servers work hand and hand.  After getting our drinks our waiter wanted to understand our time constraints which I thought was great.  We had none as this was our focus tonight.  We had two plus hours of fabulous service.  My wife pointed out; watch them bring the food to the large group.  Every plate went down at the same in unison.

Future - Well this was a very special treat.  Love to go back but this not a daily meal or experience for me.",gVO3VZwCu54Otc7bUB33Mg,5,5,5,RglHPv99cfzqed9DFxSq8Q

- Orrecchiette - with spicy lamb sausage and rapini - love the bits of lamb sausage.
- Pappardelle Bolognese - with veal and pork ragu. - excellent.

- Short Rib 'al borol' - Anson Mills Polenta and freshly shaved horseradish - Delicious and so tender!
- Lamb Sirloin Special with fregola pasta (looks like bigger couscous pearls) with mint leaves, olives and yogurt dipping sauce - This dish was for 2 people but there was enough slices for everyone to try!  if the chef makes this dish when you are at B&B, go for it!  Don't pass it up!

A coworker brought a small group of us here, saying she had discovered this place a few years back. We went only for drinks, and didn't try any of the food. 

The bartender was making custom cocktails for the group, based on each person's preferences. In some instances he was modifying a popular drink to make it more to their liking, and in other cases just creating a drink that didn't exist. He'd ask what you favorite liquor is and then a little bit about the types of flavors you like, and he'd whip something up. One by one I heard people oohing and aahing and saying how perfect their drinks were. I was a little skeptical, and I knew the drinks were pricey.

Part of Batali's New York based empire,  B&B is the more formal of his two Las Vegas restaurants (Enoteca San Marco is the other).


**The Menu
Anyone who has eaten at Babbo in New York will recognize most of the entries on the menu. In addition to more usual meats and seafood, there are a number of dishes featuring offal or less usual meats. Pasta is of course featured as well.

The meal is organized in the traditional Italian manner. The meal starts with an appetizer (antipasto), followed by a primo (which is often, but not necessarily, a pasta), then a secondo, along with side dishes (contorni). Of course, let us not forget dessert. I thought the servings were generous but not huge. However, if you're a modest eater, you may wish to order either a primo or secondo, but not both. 


**The Atmosphere
There is a lot of wood, both light and dark. Lighting is low.Tables are simply adorned, including a plain white table cloth. With so many hard surfaces, the room is noisy when full. However, I didn't find the music nearly as loud as I had expected, given the number of reviews emphasizing this.

Service started out a little slow. The server delivered a menu, explained it, then disappeared for an overly long time. However, he was very pleasant, and the meal itself was timed well. Overall, good service.

The meal started with an amuse bouche of chickpeas and olive oil on crisp rounds of bread. Maybe I was hungry, but I thought it had very good flavor. The chickpeas were soft but not mushy, and the bread's crunchiness was a pleasing contrast.

My first course was warm lamb's tongue with chanterelle mushrooms and a poached egg. I was a little hesitant to order this, as my only exposure to tongue has been delicatessen style cow's tongue, of which I'm not too fond. However, this dish was excellent. The lamb's tongue was fine grained, with a very rich meaty flavor. A marinade added just the right amount of sourness. Sweet tomato and wonderful chanterelles added to the dish, and the three minute egg added rich liquid to the dish. I used the crusty, slightly charred bread to sop it up.

For my primo, the server recommend orecchiette with sweet sausage and rapini. Good recommendation. Orecchiette translates to something like ""little ear"", and is a lot like what U.S. supermarkets sell as macaroni shells. The pasta was cooked perfectly - very firm but still cooked through - and the flavors went well together. This dish wasn't quite as good as the lamb's tongue, but it was still very good indeed.

My secondo was fennel dusted sweetbreads. If you've never tried sweetbreads, or have tried them but aren't sure you like them, this is the place to order them. Served with sweet and sour onions and duck bacon, the very crispy outside contrasted with the smooth but firm insides. Some sort of mushroom juice was poured into the bottom of the bowl. Its moisture and its flavor were just right. Another very good dish, perhaps just a hair behind the lamb's tongue.

At this point, it's worth commenting on a point I've heard made by some other reviewers - that Batali has too heavy a hand on the salt shaker.  At home I tend to use little salt, yet I didn't find Batali's use of salt objectionable - more than I'd use, but not objectionable. However, I did end up drinking a lot of water throughout the meal, especially during the pasta course, so your mileage may vary.

Finally, dessert: warm chocolate budino with peppermint gelato. It was, fortunately, a very small portion: rich chocolate cake with dense chocolate ganache, served warm. The gelato was wonderful! Make sure to order gelato in some form or other. If you can't arrange a visit here, go to the more casual Enoteca San Marco, where you can sit at the bar and just order gelato; it seems to be the same as at B&B.


**Summary
I've read a number of very complimentary reviews - and some not so complimentary reviews. Based on one meal, I side with the very complimentary camp. However, my choices were on the more unusual side, so it's hard to say what this means with respect to more normal dishes. Nonetheless, this restaurant is definitely on my repeat list.

5831820,2013-05-20,0,GTR39A2jwNIS_NV8q2r_JA,"Food was definitely a 3.5-star kind of place but server was weirdddd. 

We didn't get there til 10:20 ish since we just finished watching Rock of Ages next door (click around for my review of that). We waited about 5 minutes to get a round booth table which was nice. 

I got the pappardelle bolognese and it was exactly what I was craving. Also got the artichoke gratinata on the side and it was quite nice. Though, my girlfriends didn't help me out much so it was quite heavy ish to eat by myself bc of the bread crumbs and olive oil. By no means am I saying it was unhealthy or a huge portion or anything, just didn't feel quite as healthy eating it by myself.

Friend 1 got the black spaghetti (squid ink) which I thought was fantastic, but she said it was a little too spicy. When the server came over to ask how everything was and she said it was too spicy, you could tell he had this awkward mental turmoil in his head where he could have said what was appropriate for such a fancy establishment, something along the lines of: ""did you want me to get you something else?"" but he probably didn't want to so instead he said ""it's good for you!"" ................ .... .... ........ ........LOL. 

Friend 2 got the 2 minute spicy calamari which she liked a lot more. Unfort I'm allergic so I couldn't try haha. 

Other awkward thing was the bread guy gave us bread and no butter or olive oil or vinegar so we just sat there, starving from the show, trying to politely get somebody's attention for a good 10 minutes so we could eat the dryass bread lol. 

I get it, you know? All the people that work in Vegas are super jaded and always expect tips for everything. I'm sorry we're Asian girls watching our figures (we are eating at 10pm after all) and didn't order a primi and secondi each, subsequently lowering your tip, I'm sorry. 

The tasting menu ($99) is probably the best deal out of everything on the menu and I would have tried that if it wasn't for the early flight the next day. I would have looked forward to trying that the next time I'm in town but thanks to the awkward reception from the staff I probably won't return. It wasn't horrible and we didn't feel completely degraded or anything, but it was just awkward haha.",SEzwdRFv4267jo8WAT64yA,0,0,3,NhfBmj6G81FBPm0g4RuzwQ

5841800,2010-07-13,1,GTR39A2jwNIS_NV8q2r_JA,"The first time I was ""introduced"" to crocs was when I was watching Mario Batali on the Food Network.  I didn't like them then and I don't like them now.  That aside, I liked Mario as a chef and when my friend suggested we try one of his restaurants while we were in town, we did some (quick) research and chose B&B.    

We arrived around 9'ish on a Friday night and were seated right away.  Restaurant had a good amount of patrons inside.  Lighting was dim, woods were dark and service was good.

Everything on the menu sounded great.  I chose to start off with the grilled fig salad which was awesome.  Unfortunately, I can't say the same for my entree.  I had housemade orecchiette with sweet sausage and rapini.  The pasta was good, but I thought the dish as a whole was too salty.  Boo.  The Jose's Pyramids were the table favorite - triangle shaped ravioli filled with pulled short ribs and a red sauce.  Yum!

We skipped dessert, had 2 glasses of wine total and the bill ended up being roughly $70/pp.

Don't think I would go back to B&B, but I would certainly try another one of Mario's restaurants.",CcJAs3QyoPdnTTKKpsbA_A,1,0,3,oYfzx9Vomf9LqNWx0FztiQ
5854014,2011-01-08,0,GTR39A2jwNIS_NV8q2r_JA,"My wife and I ate at B&B a few years ago, so my review is based on that experience.  By some accounts, some of Mario Batali's kitchens are flagging a skosh in their quality.... that was most assuredly *not* the case when I dined at B&B.

The meal was a progression of flavors and textures unlike few I have ever enjoyed, yet at its core there remained a solid 'Italian' foundation.  Service was outstanding (something that I've found to be the exception rather than the rule at many of the Vegas outposts of celebrity chef's empires), and the sommelier gracious and helpful.

Beef cheek ravioli, sweetbreads, rabbit.... and those exquisite veal chops!

B&B is, along with the newer Osteria Mozza in Los Angeles, very much 'Babbo West' in its style and execution.  Would gladly return there in a heartbeat.",rPyq8rS0CN9ABMIRHO-GVQ,0,0,4,arkAZMfhdRrBoCaL1-A9RA
5855361,2012-12-01,1,GTR39A2jwNIS_NV8q2r_JA,"With all the great food in Vegas, I feel a little cheated that I wasted my opportunity and money eating here.  It's my second Batali experience and guarantee it will be my last.  

Our server was excellent and knowledgable.  She was able to recommend a wine that met my criteria (I don't know Italian wines), and the bottle was $43.00 which was a bargain since it was $17.00 each by the glass.  The garbanzo bruschetta served compliments of the chef was very tasty.  

We opted for salads, secondis and sides.  While adding a primi would have been too much food, the secondi portions were very small.  

Beet salad was beet salad.  Nothing exceptional. 

I ordered the lamb chops ($28.00) which didn't happen to be on the menu that night.  They serve the lamb with the fat still on the chop.  I liked the idea better than the execution.  The chops were supposed to be medium, they were more like medium well.  Unfortunately, that still didn't give the lamb fat an opportunity to crisp.  It was just too much fat too under cooked.  It would have been impossible to eat all that fat.  

The biggest let-down was the shortrib. ($32.00)  Absolutely tasteless. 

The Quail was corn meal crusted, I didn't try it, my friend said it was good, but it was tiny and 3 hours later he was starving.

Sides: we got brussels sprouts ($9.00) which were hands down the best thing we ate.  They were really outstanding.  Brocolli with garlic and chili flakes.  Good, you know, nothing exceptional.

The service was SLOOOOOOOW.  We didn't have anywhere we needed to be but I was STARVING by the time the food finally came.  We finally ended up telling our server we needed to meet some friends and had to go.  

It just was not good enough.  Nothing memorable, nothing I need to go back for.  Do yourself a favor, and check out Keller's Bouchon instead.  THAT was a memorable meal.",wKPSHbz603kqaAXm-Fw9hg,5,2,2,etAFoOcTWToW63wr-VRh-Q

5868171,2008-11-19,1,GTR39A2jwNIS_NV8q2r_JA,"Ok. I ate here before I became vegan, so ... here is a vegetarian-friendly review:

I came here with my now ex-boyfriend on my 21st birthday, mainly because (1) this was Mario Batali's restaurant, and (2) his brother raved about the service and the food.

And the service.... well, they really do tend to your hand and foot. Our server was pretty kick-ass looking too, with his ear plug and shaved head. You would've thought that he played in a rock band on the weekends or something similar. But anyways, they were extremely helpful in accommodating my vegetarian diet, giving me suggestions on what I could order on the menu and whatnot. 

So I had some sort of mushroom dish (4 kinds of mushrooms?) and whoaaaaa I still salivate over the thought of those mushrooms today. Completely simple and in their natural flavor... the pasta was hand-made/hand-cranked also! Very delicious. My partner had some sort of penne dish I can't remember the vegetable but the penne was damn good. It was hand-rolled and paper thin.... I still salivate over that as well. 

I think the desserts were so-so, not very memorable; the presentation of all the food was beautiful (of course) and we had a delicious glass of Muscato accompanying our dessert. 

I would definitely go back if I were to stop in Vegas again .. and if I had money and they had vegan options, just because the service was so top-notch. What I mean is, the server (or any server) paid attention to you, but not in the annoying salesperson sort of way.

However the location of this restaurant is a bit weird. It's located in a mall. So as nicely dressed up as you are, you.... look out and see a bunch of tourists... in their usual tourist garb.",stlJvtCx8_mxroWChyBuhw,1,1,5,d_SzIWo3xArknLOh3Q3v5A

I'm not even going to complain about the price because if the quality if the food matched the rest of the restaurant, I'd be happy to pay $28 for  pasta Bolognese. But this dish was bland, cold and uninspired. it felt more like a meal you'd get on an airplane than a high end restaurant. Any cheap hole in the wall Italian restaurant could do way better than this.

My friend ordered the short rib with polenta and it was also bland. the polenta was watery and completely lacking flavour or that creamy texture you expect. The short rib was just pulled meat on top of the watery mess.  When I think of short ribs I want a roasted, caramelized rib with tender, highly flavorful meat falling of the bone.

5897926,2013-06-30,0,GTR39A2jwNIS_NV8q2r_JA,"Dear Mario,

I address this review to you personally, because after the incredible experience I had at your restaurant two nights in a row, I feel like I've gotten to know you, and I've come to share your passion for how a meal should be enjoyed. Of course, I share this letter with the world, because I also want the world to know what an amazing team you have at B&B, most notably Terra!

My experience began with a group of 11 in the private ""Grotto"" wine cellar room. From start to finish, not only was the cuisine Iron Chef worthy, it was Terra and her team who made it truly memorable. Balancing the varying palates and experience levels of so many people, Terra made it easy, fun and adventurous for all of us to try so many first and second courses from which we might otherwise have shied away. I lost count of how many different dishes we tried, but I can tell you that every dish was relished by every one of us!

Terra made such an impression on me that I asked if it would be possible to request a dinner reservation with her again the very next night. I considered this a longshot, since the ""next night"" was a Friday, but without hesitation Terra assured me that she'd get me a table and with her as our  server. To be honest, there were several other very tempting fine dining restaurant choices available without even having to leave the Palazzo or Venetian, but none of those other venues had Terra. While your kitchen crew deserves all due credit for providing fabulous cuisine, your team on the floor made it an absolutely perfect experience.

Started with an artichoke salad for appetizer which was $20+. It was a small but well orchestrated dish. Very fresh and crisp taste with some hints of citrus elements. There is a light dressing that accents the fresh crisp taste of the dish.

I got the pork chop for my entree. This was VERY good. Very thick cut which was heavily seasoned (which I prefer). Overall a savory taste. Had a nice crust on outside, and very moist tasty inside. The dish was covered in a sweet glaze that I believe was derived from dates. It had some fresh greens on top which added a nice earthy contrast. I think this plate was in the $40-50 range.

A vodka tonic I think ran around $14-16/drink. 

Great meal, but still doesn't match the price. About 3.5 stars total package, but giving the food the benefit of the doubt",tIZS7vUsc-HSm29SUzrLxA,1,0,4,ABLyh5pzC36cwnNzHYnKVw
