1340237,2018-02-26,1,IEJFia0wQX7UezfXsenI5g,"You can find Grill City Pinoy Street Food inside Seafood City Supermarket. It is near the check out and it has a few selection of self serve Filipino skewered items like Banana Cue, Turon, Pork Isaw, Butchi, Squid Balls, Fish Balls, Lobster Balls, Fish Kikiam, Qwek Qwek, and there is Sweet Corn and Balut. If you're on a time crunch and need a quick bite, this area will surely have something available. 

I chose a few tasty favorites like Banana Cue, Turon, and Butchi. Banana Cue is one of the more popular Filipino snack and it's a skewered deep fried plantain with caramalize brown sugar. It taste best when it's eaten fresh and hot. Turon is a fried banana lumpia with jackfruit that is coated with brown sugar giving it a crispy sweetness. I'm amaze how they make the turon so long, it can be challenging to fit it inside a small take out box. 

Butchi is actually one of my favorite fun treat to eat. It's made with sweet rice flour filled with sweetened red beans and shape into a ball that's coated with sesame seeds and then deep fried. The only downside is that the butchi taste like it's been sitting there for awhile. Next time I will ask if they can make a fresh batch. 

Overall I think Pinoy Street Food is a nice addition to Grill City. I do like their self serve option, but I am hoping they add a little more variety and fresh hot grill items to the station.",dpvR4LYXr0CYHtHf8BeCKg,1,1,3,UtpseOKMurP92N8mLD5zjQ

I ordered one selection from their value meal menu. I had the BBQ chicken value meal which comes with 1 BBQ chicken skewer, rice and a side of salad for $7.99. I personally did not like the BBQ chicken. I wasn't a fan of the marination used and I didn't care much for the salad. I also prefer a smaller cut of meat when on a stick. BBQ meat should also be cut equally of the same size so it can be eaten easily. 

Overall, not a shabby place to dine in for a quick meal. I would come back to try other items. I can't wait to try their bibingka. I was told it's one of their best sellers and it sells out quickly.",pm7K54T6OmsDHREtiVBWGQ,5,5,3,q73ZONukao72VhHYwdAzAA

So happy this place is here now...honestly like it better than Jollibee..

I cannot wait to come back..Idk how new this place is but it was definitely busy the whole time we were there...everyone loves this place..

It was an order as you go food court type place so there's not much wait other than when you are ordering.

For this particular restaurant, it was a total disaster. This place is new and popular, so everyone is going there. There are whole families waiting in line, so employees are unsure who to serve next and it makes the entire experience disorganized. The food is expensive for what it is: I could probably make the same thing at home for half the price. There was nothing special on the menu. I ordered chicken BBQ sticks and they throw them in a to go bag and it's very messy. My mom ordered mussels and they were stingy, only serving three while they served other customers double the amount.

FOOD IS GREAT! 
The reason i am giving 2 Stars
It's because the SERVICE IS TERRIBLY AWFUL.
All Staff are not rude but (SOUR FACE) people misconstrued Sour Face to RUDENESS which is not a healthy image for new tourist when they go check Yelp for review.

The Manager wearing Black shirt is very Friendly! She does know how to Smile!

But the rest fails on this criteria.

Communication is lacking although there is no Language Barrier jusko Tagalog nalang d paba tayo pede mag communicate? Maaapreciate mo pa ung nasa PALENGKE na nag bebenta.

DON'T know how to Smile, don't know how to communicate parang always bago sa work at pili ang kinakausap ung kakilala! 
No Customer Service Criteria in short!
(This is a Place of Business! They should learn to set aside Personal stuff from work)

And the lady probably around 30 to 40 years of age definitely 5'2 height 
She does communicate but will leave you hanging when u have question, and same thing walang Customer Service factor.
Maganda about he she does know how to say thank you upon giving your receipt.

My conclusion:

Parang IMBYERNA mga buhay ng Employees dito! 
Feeling mo they don't care about the Job and they only work for the check not the Service.
Except the Manager 5-5'2 in height brown hair short hair. Her customer service is exceptional! 
She carries her Position very well! D sya nahihiyang mag smile ng mag smile nakaka hawa ung pag smile kahit imbyerna ka napapangiti ka sknya.
Kabaligtaran sa dalawang empleyadong nabaggit ko.

My review was based upon the service given at that period, I have nothing personal but would like to see changes knowing we are a Paying Customer.


Note: THEY NEED TO STOP ON SIMANGOT FACE OR SOUR FACE nangangasim lang? 

Smile naman dyan unless mabaho talaga yang hininga nyo or sira ang ngipin! and communicate more! Making business is making connections! U don't know mga low profile manamit sila ung MILYONARYO!

They want the food that they associate with growing up from mom and pop's house. Eating here is probably the most authentic filipino food that you're gonna get.

Here goes,, you line up,, you connect eyes with one of the people behind the counter. Tell them how many rice youre gonna need. Then you pick up a dish or two to eat with your rice. You move down, tell them what you want to drink. Pay for your food, pick a table and proceed to enjoy filipino food.

Ok, now food... we ordered Chicken Inasal, Whole Squid and 4 Orders of rice. The chicken was sorta dry,, i don't know how you can dry up leg quarters, but it was. The taste was a little bland as well. The rice ""that night"", I'm sure it's different every night, tasted like it was about to turn. The savior of all the dishes, the squid. It was damn good squid!

The biggest problem I've encountered, like many Yelpers have reviewed before me, are the lack of organization and slow service.   The single-file, cafeteria style line just doesn't seem to cut it.  Workers seem confused as to who to serve next at times; often people get skipped only to slow down service even further.  It's a claustrophobic clusterF-... never mind.  Breakfast lines are more manageable.

During breakfast, at a whopping $3.95, you are provided with two sunnyside-up eggs, two generous scoops of garlic fried rice (which I believe in the fine print of an Ad I saw that it is actually unlimited rice?) and your choice of breakfast entree.  These include corned beef, 2 kinds of longanisa (Filipino sausages- sweet, pork-filled), various fried fish, tocino (Filipino bacon pretty much, yummy), and other choices based on the day.  Coffee is free.  I love to literally pig out after a long nightshift at work.

I've tried what they apparently specialize in for lunch and dinner, that which is their chicken and pork BBQ.  While not bad tasting, they will not channel your inner food-child to come back for more.  The BBQ are definitely not worth waiting for in the amusement park-like lines.    

But as I said before, do come for breakfast.  You should get your money and your tummy's worth.  And tell them that Mike sent ya.   You won't get any special treatment.  But you will get looked at funny. =)

They grill up a boat load!  Makes my eyes bigger than my stomach.  What's nice is with how Nessa and I eat, we can share one order.  Except she also gets hungry again quicker than I do, so I get an extra.  I must try the chicken BBQ next.

Loving the naked salad side option.  This is the fresh lumpia filling without the wrapper.  Good idea guys!  See why this kinda food makes one full, a plate comes with two rice scoops plus a side!  Sides include pancit guisado noodles too.  Feeling the food coma just looking at the food... but it's really delish!

They have all main meats here hungry people! Chicken, fish, beef, squid, shrimp in some foods.  Ask them about goat in special orders though.  Oh your tastebuds!  It's fast food but not like American fast food.  This is great grilling flavor.  The menu is appetizing; the display of cooked food is appetizing.

Along with breakfast, they have a nice selection of entrees for lunch and dinner. They have your typical Filipino meats and sides you can get along with your meal.

There were no flaws in the foods that I tried, and their chicken skewers were so amazing, it was my favorite part of my meal. The staff is really kind to their customers, and I really appreciate the professionalism. I guess the only downside to this place is the seating.

I enjoy their bbq and of course my favorite their bangus. It's just a disappointment how they panic when they become so busy, instead of one person taking your order it is passed along about 3 other people which makes everything else complicated because they weren't the original person you placed that order with so once you've reached the counter to pay, the cashier is already confused so it's going to take you another 5 minutes or so explain what you've ordered and which one is yours. Just very inconvenient, I hope they fix this matter so they can speed up their line.

Their food prices is average, but enough to feed your hunger, I believe. This place attracts your senses because it is inside Seafood City, which makes it a lot harder to just pass by.

Everyone seemed to be scattered, without a designated task in the assembly line.

We both ordered the chicken skewer combo, which comes with one skewer, two scoops of rice, and a side of your choice. We chose the pansit palabok, which was nothing special. (I prefer Jollibee's across the way with its skinny noodles.) We found that the rice ratio is unbalanced. Too much! I would've liked 2 skewers honestly, so my advice: get the 4 skewers for $11 and just order a side of rice for each person. The BBQ itself is perfect, but the service still needs to be streamlined. (The titas and kuyas are all friendly though!)",HcT3BZLc25R9eekoHBA1MQ,2,1,3,-vjzDzhWom5DTf5l6m_hwg

3647317,2015-11-24,1,IEJFia0wQX7UezfXsenI5g,"Seafood city opened this eatery right in the middle of the plaza. Their BBQ smelled good & looked delicious, so I was keen to try this place.

My family of 7 adults ordered the Grilled Meat Platter, 6 additional BBQ sticks, and fresh lumpia. 

Everything was delicious & prices were reasonable. We probably could've ordered more, but what we ordered was sufficient to satisfy our hunger (we didn't want to over eat like we always do).
The chicken BBQ sticks were my favorite! It was lightly sweetened & tasted like my mom's cooking.

It's fast food style where you order, get your food right away, pay, and then find a seat. When they're super busy, it can be challenging to find a seat (which was around the time we went).

The major downside, since it was busy, it was way toooooo crowded & tight for me. Seats are literally back to back, & tables are a couple feet away. They should really expand or find another location for this eatery.

Other than that, I was surprised at how much I enjoyed the food. Being there reminded me of Philippines (which could be a pro or a con), but I'll definitely be back.. Only when they're not super busy =)",Kq_Cg-INSv4i8wNo1kDF-w,3,1,4,AXJhJGV3lTJkdxgNKEvBcA

Prior to grocery shopping, I hadn't eaten breakfast yet so I was drawn to their cheap $3.99 silog combo. But the inefficiency of the servers here is just mind-numbing. It seemed like the ordering system is pretty simple. Order what you want then go to the register to pay. But, for some reason, there were 5-6 servers just running around, talking to each other and nothing was getting done. The line didn't move for a good 15-20 minutes. Finally, one of the women noticed I hadn't yet ordered. It was around 10:00 am and they didn't have the entire menu ready. There was only a few of the sausages left. 

Service aside, the food for the price is pretty amazing. It's by no means fancy or anything close, but if you've ever had down and dirty Filipino food, this is it. I love the garlic rice and the longsilogs (sausages). You also get two fried eggs, all for a little over $4 with tax. The portion size is pretty large as well and enough for two meals.

I came from Washington and there's a grill city there. I was excited when one opened in Vegas. It's inexpensive and delicious. 

I really enjoy the pork or chicken BBQ sticks that is packed with flavor. Give it a try! You can get 4 BBQ sticks for $11.00.

For the grill side, I also enjoy the grill chicken which is packed with flavor as well. You don't need any dipping sauce what so ever. I also enjoy the pork belly, who doesn't love pork belly?! Pack with a vinegar BBQ flavor you can resist.

Towards the entrées, I am a palabok fan.. Squeeze lemon package on top & once again pack with flavor.. But defiantly ask for lemon if you were to get palabok cause it can be salty without it.

4014350,2016-04-19,2,IEJFia0wQX7UezfXsenI5g,"Almost there, but Grill City needs some tuning!

Saw earlier reviews about Grill City when they 1st opened and thought we would give it a few months before trying it out.  Hard to say, but I still feel the pain of many past reviews!

Just the smell of passing by Grill City is intoxicating.  It's smoke, it's dead carcass, it's flames!  All it takes to get your olfactory senses going!  And Grill City is no joke when it comes to grilling!  Their grills are filled to the MAX with all kinds of stuff on skewers!  

So into the line we go.  And boy, is it a line!  Biggest gripe.  They have got to so something about this single line control!  It gets long & tiresome, we had to wait quite a while to be helped.  Seems like only 1 person was taking orders that day so it made the line go real, real slow.  Luckily, the wifey speaks Tagalog so our orders were actually placed quickly once we reached the front of the line.  If you don't speak any Fiiipino like me, be prepared to talk slowly!  For the most part one of the ladies will understand you but just be patient.  And believe me, by the time you get to the front of the line to order, your patience will be thin.

Besides the horrible lining, especially on a busy weekend, especially after Catholic church...the food is some charred goodness!  We ordered from the Grill City 'Value Meals' & 'Value Packs' section of the menu:

*Pork BBQ with naked salad ($6.99)
*Chicken BBQ with naked salad ($6.99)
*Grilled Golden Pompano (2 for $13.00)

Each meal comes with a generous (super generous) portion of steamed white rice, grilled meats came with 'naked' salad which is basically sautéed stir-fry veggies.  You could also get a side of soup or an additional entrée for a bit more money.

Grill City was damn delicious!  Meats had that lovely char on them from a flame, marinated well in that sticky sweet sauce we Filipinos love.  The grilled pompano I was surprised I would like because being a weirdo, I don't really like eating whole fish.  Ai sos!  What kind of sad Filipino am I?  Saying you don't like fish as a Filipino is akin to saying you don't like a da lamb as a Greek.  Damn near sacrilege!  But this grilled pompano was good!  They stuffed it with some tomatoes and lemon pepper seasoning, and when grilled gave it a nice smoky flavor. I rather liked it, especially dipped in suko (vinegar)!  And the white Jasmine rice!  Thankfully Grill City makes it right, need those carbs to cut back on the fatty meat.

Another tiny gripe here is the seating arrangement.  Good luck getting a table on a busy Sunday!  I hope you like sitting next to Filipinos you don't know!  But be friendly anyway.  Most of the tables are seated close together it might as well be communal eating.  I really don't mind, I just smile and go on about my business.  But you private eaters out there beware!  A Filipino old lady be all up in your bizness, asking you if you're single & that she has a niece from the Philippines that is just right for you. 9 out of 10 times - don't believe her.  Ha Ha Ha

Next time we'll probably try and come at a time when it's less busy, likely after a lunch rush but way before dinner.  Maybe the lines will be calmer by then, and the wait much shorter.

Service: The worst part. Extremely slow and rude. These ladies have no idea what they are doing. My wife ordered the crispy lechon, rice, and bopis. The lady had no idea to work the machines, and got the weight of the order wrong. We asked for a half pound and she tried to give us over one pound. My turn to order and my frustrations began when I had my food and was trying to pay so I could eat with my wife. 

The cashier completely ignored me. She looked at me, walked away, grabbed a clipboard and started filling it out. Didn't say she would be with me shortly, no smile, nothing. I timed it and after six minutes I've had enough and placed my tray back in the counter and told them I was leaving. They just looked at me and kept working. At least three of them heard me voicing my frustrations and none of them cared, at all. Oblivious to the fact that they are losing business. They were all running around like headless chickens and guess what? I went to Chowking and got something to eat and about eight of them were across from them on break. 

They are more concerned with their breaks than they are giving any level of service. While I was standing in line, one of the workers asked another for help and the other one blew her off to take her break. 

There is no organization. There is no teamwork. There is no passion for their job and giving service. There is definitely passion about ignoring customers and breaks though. 

On top of that, my wife's lechon was burnt and the rice mushy. Any Filipino with a sense of pride and work ethic would be ashamed to work here or even be associated with Grill City. Never again.",SJskhjbY1VPfL8ej0fYPdA,0,1,1,Er9_XdWU754EnlD5HDJMBA

My experience yesterday was such a big chaos and annoyance!! I brought my friends here for dinner who are on vacation here in LV.

The staff don't know how to pay attention! Waited about 15 minutes on the line. When we finally got there, the staff are serving different customers at a time! They don't pay attention on who's next! Felt bad for the old grandpa in front of us.

Two ladies were served first before him. Then they were going to serve us next, missing him again, i said, hey, this grandpa has been here waiting to be served. 

I ordered a grilled meat platter for $22.95. I asked the lady if rice is included in the platter (HEY it should right!! Especially pinoys! Who eats bbq without rice?!) But thought Id still ask. She said yes it's included. She then asked if we want soup or naked salad, since its also included. Soup with meatballs?! EW. But if its included why not. We got to the cashier and she was charging us $27.95 for the platter, im like, i thought it's 22.95. She said, with the rice and soup, it's 27.95. OK.. the lady didn't told me that! I asked if rice is included in the 22.95 platter, she said yes! She didnt mention that at at all! I mean $5 is no biggie, but because Im already pissed off by how super unorganized they were in the beginning, every little mistake will make me mad! UGH!
 
This is what really annoyed me and ruined my day.
My friend asked the cashier how to get a suki card to start getting points. She instructed her where to go and that once she got the card, she can come back with it along with the receipt. Guess what. She got the card, she came back with the receipt, and the cashier told her, ""Oh ma'am, sorry, we can't do it anymore"" WTF! She came back to the table very pissed! She was embarassed. I was gonna tell that cashier off if my friend didn't stop me! Why would you tell one thing and then not do it! UGH! 

They are pretty stingy when it comes to vinegar too! She originally gave us one small container of vinegar for the whole platter! We had to ask her to give us more. She added 2. We had to ask her one more time to add more! She add 1. REALLY! I was so pissed off! I want my vinegar on my rice and bbq so give me a bunch! Lol!

So with the platter, chicken inasal is super dry and tasted old! yuck! although pork Liempo and bbq's are good. We also ordered squid which is 2 for $14. They were bland. KAPUSO's squid is way better.

I hope the staff over here gets it together! I understand they're fairly new. But come on! Simple customer service skills, be nice, smile, pay attention, tell the truth, and don't be stingy on your sauces! GDI!

Walking in to the market, the place smelled brand new. Give it a couple weeks until it gets that unique Filipino supermarket smell. Grill City is the very first restaurant you'll see to the right when you step inside. The communal dining area is very clean after only being open for less than a week, so we'll see how it goes as time passes by. 

For lunch, I opted for their #1 Combo: 1 bbq skewer with rice for $8.50. The marinade on the bbq pork is sweet, but not overpowering. Light coating for sure which my face appreciated for less the mess after eating. Nice big slices of the pork on a 12"" bamboo skewer.  

A la Carte Mungo - nice thick stew-like consistency, instead of the watery versions you get at other restaurants. Love the big pieces of greens inside.

A la Carte Chicken Adobo - not a fan. They use chicken drumsticks and very oily. Lacks the vinegar tang that I'm used to from other places. Definitely skip this for my next visit.

A la Carte Pancit Bihon - rice noodles that is not over cooked, greatly seasoned with no need to add a squeeze of lemon,  but it would be great if they provided a wedge. Generous cuts of vegetables which I love. I wonder if they can do half rice half pancit for my next visit?

A la Carte Calamansi Juice - avoid! Very watered down. Such a waste of money. 

After filling my lunch tray and sitting down,  I was not a fan of the long style dining table. For a brand new place, the table was very unstable. Not the best if it gets full and I just foresee a  accident waiting to happen.

My mom brought me a breakfast plate from Grill City and I was quite impressed with the taste so knowing that we were gonna be doing some shopping at nearby Boulevard Mall we planned on trying their lunch offerings.

As like any other day, parking in Seafood City is always hectic (scary to have so many Asian drivers in one tiny place hahaha) but weekends are the worst and I'm sure the addition of new places to eat in there and 99 Ranch market made it twice as crazy, but oh well, there are sacrifices to be made. As expected it was packed with people and the line was long, my mom stood in line while we scoured for a place to sit. Luckily, a group of gentlemen offered their table but not before some guy tried to hijack it from under our noses, only to be told by the guys that it was for me and my family. He was fuming and even cussed in Filipino hahahaha, he must've been really hangry!

On to the food: We decided on the Mixed platter which consisted of - 2 Grilled Tilapia, 1.5 Liempo (grilled pork belly) 3 pieces of pork or chicken BBQ (they were out of chicken) priced at $22.95 but with the addition of rice and soup or salad is $27.95 which was our order. Everything had really good flavor and charring but I didn't care so much for the grilled Pork belly, I prefer mine more meaty and less fatty. The soup they had was Chicken Tinola, flavor was ok, nothing worth mentioning. For dessert we got their Bibingka (rice cake) $3.99, it was fresh out of the oven but I found it to be too boring, no flavor pop and it had a weird consistency. They had some other food offering but they didn't look too appetizing, nothing we couldn't do a better version of at home. Would I go back? Perhaps. It's not bad, it just didn't WOW me either.",JqjAthJThuVYgTh4iWDZ2A,7,4,3,p1DjpFpmINE50VKGI-SDqw

I always pick up the chicken sticks after I shop at Seafood City. I recommend the chicken sticks unless you like fat. The pork sticks are mostly fat, chewy fat (not always a good thing especially with these pork sticks). 

Not a fan of the fried banana fritter on a stick. 

Friendly service but it's slow. Very slow. Last time I waited maybe 10-15 mins in a long line before I got to order. Not sure what's going on, it may be bad management and organization. 

The next time I'm at Seafood City in the morning, I want to try their breakfast options. Looks a little better than Chow King.

TIP:
* Word of advice... service is SLOW with long lines...bring your patience! :-)",825Ol4rTvAZnUyFMke37jA,11,10,3,Stfvh8S517JT7YEzdTVP3A

One of our orders is Ampalaya con carne worth 40 dollars... So we were expecting to see at least small chunks of beef with it, instead we got dry Ampalaya with very small amount of ground pork. False advertisement! I complained to the manager and she said she understand and agreed that they should change the name of their Ampalaya con carne to ginisang Ampalaya cus it's what it really is, she was nice while talking to me but I wasn't finished talking yet and she hang up before I could even say good bye. I was still talking to her and she hang up! For false advertisement and rudeness... 2 stars",NU8u2ZaslQsHozqELCn7rQ,0,0,2,fmeBS3o4qXcTA9hoVYg6ZQ

5260991,2015-11-03,0,IEJFia0wQX7UezfXsenI5g,Expensive but the food is good need the warmer to be hotter the temperature of the food is in the danger line probably they need it to be about 160° atleast and i noticed that Staff/workers are picking off customers and letting them cut infront of another person. So whats the point of the falling in line? Other than that foods good expensive and need to train the workers well. This is not the Philippines dont bring that suke style and letting them cut infront. Please do something about keeping the food hot and train the staff more efficiently.,0zV4wIOPLyi0iG-k4ZL7wQ,2,0,2,aPtjCV6lSsk2dePP62gR8w

The palabok was soupy and was salty--no other flavor except salt. We tried to complain to a manager but we're basically told, ""Oh, okay.""

I tried their sago drinks and the tapioca pearls weren't cook. They were still hard in the middle. I didn't get to finish my drink. I wonder if they actually taste the sago first before they sell them. I was not pleased with the taste. Hopefully another venue would be different. I hope they make improvements because a lot of these foods I love.",ZZ7fVvKntca6QFRkjPX6gA,2,1,2,OOI4iJbCIaO7mGL1ihCkIw
5327393,2017-01-06,0,IEJFia0wQX7UezfXsenI5g,"Don't overlook this Filipino eatery. With its great value comes with equally simplistic and savory dishes. Before you go and hit the Las Vegas Strip (especially in the morning) come here to get some Filipino style breakfast (meat and egg over garlic rice). Aesthetically, the eatery is in a marketplace making your time here feel more like a cafeteria. Staff is certainly a hit or miss (if you don't speak tagalog) but all is fair here at Grill City. 

Visit Grill City certainly if you are in the area but don't really need to visit unless you're in a tight budget on your trip or looking to get away from the Strip. Happy Eating!",bAyWsPPND__o3pd0NBUTEQ,0,0,3,pBr4hIcktW2B7AzM95Rb5Q

The cook tried to serve the food while the squid was still raw & so the manger tells him to put it in the microwave. Yes they are busy but it's definitely not an excuse to serve costumer a with raw food. So I go & complain & the supervisor tells me that the food is still ""edible"". Then she asks me ""do you want me to replace your food"" & I tell her no I just want them to make sure to serve cooked food the way it's suppose to be.",_0izNX-flPVUCwLJWBndRA,1,0,1,IZelWO-Y06b8GTvXnQXYMA
