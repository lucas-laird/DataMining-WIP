Sushi was very thin and too much rice. One order took 30min to get. Total dining time was hour and a half but I waited more than half of the time. They never apologized.

294339,2016-06-26,0,qpub9UXk8oBJr95oq-MbIg,"Two reasons NOT to go here: The food and the service.

It should have been a glaring sign when an AYCE sushi place in a great location is pretty empty on a Friday night at 8pm.

First, let's discuss the food.  It is like you take the neglected California Roll from a local's casino buffet and pour twelve sauces on it to hide the quality of anything that would need to be fresh.  

Their special rolls are all just cold tempura-ed matter drowned in bland sauces.  Seriously, the crap I attempted to eat here tonight wouldn't pass in a rural town in the Midwest and should definitely not be tolerated in any part of Las Vegas.

Next the service:  Three sushi chefs and two servers (one being the manager/owner?) were completely overwhelmed by four tables.  The waitress (who the Manager declared to us was brand new) struggled mightily to speak English and got 60% of order right within 5 minutes of ordering (3 out of 5 items) and then literally went on break for the next 30 minutes and we were abandoned...

When I got out of the seat and explained this to the other server (Manager), she said ""she will be back soon"" instead of offering to take our next round of items.  At this point me and my girlfriend decided to chalk it up as a bad meal, demanded the check, paid $55 for our mistake, and went to another restaurant down the street to start from scratch.

Read my other reviews, I am not unreasonable.  I just don't think anyone should throw away their hard earned money on this awful restaurant.",KERR-doMPDEBdSqcYHjBLw,0,0,1,wpJ4-axyDh_xwVR4wEqKhg

Today we were served cold tempura, had orders come out one at a time to each person. The portions are very small. We didn't even get everything we ordered. At one point we were tempted to go to the Wendy's next door since the food arrived so slowly. There were 6 patrons in the place at the time. It seems like they deliberately slowed AYCE orders, even though they charge $22 for lunch. Many of the rolls are covered in a sticky sweet tempura sauce. One sushi roll was ice cold as if it had been in a refrigerator.  Better alternatives a mile north on Rampart.",sSNcLNRDwBVIqLgVrexBFQ,1,0,1,WZQurHhDRDx4ZJOFCI2yXQ

When you walk in you are greeted in Japanese and warmly welcomed. They do have the 24.95 AYCE. But you better finish or you have to pay for the leftovers!  I got the ultra tuna roll. Spicy inside with plain tuna on top. Hum. Kinda like me!  Also the roll rice is nice too. Thought it was a roll but it was a mini mountain of rice goodness!

As I was writing this review they changed my opinion from a one star to a 0! when they brought this role that looked like it had pink vomit on it. For those who wonder about flavor let me describe sushi here BLAND, DULL, FLAVORLESS.  To wrap it up I wouldn't eat here free I hope that this place doesnt rip you of because I felt cheated off money.

It's a decent size sushi place with beautiful Japanese decor. Our server was also in a gorgeous top that went wonderfully with the decor. Our server was sweet, and I could see the sushi chef took pride in each roll he made.

We went with the AYCE menu for dinner which was priced the standard of $24.99. They have an impressive menu, and we didn't even get to try everything because our bellies got full. From the apps we had gyoza, which reminded me of the Filipino dish lumpia, probably because it had pork and veggies inside. Still good though. I always like to try something out of the ordinary and samples their avocado and cucumber roll from their veggie menu. This was a bit dry for my taste, but with some soy sauce, better. From their nigiri menu we tried the garlic tuna, garlic hamachi (yellowtail), and super white. I was impressed with both garlic choices, but I was disappointed by the super white. Super white is my favorite thing to order whenever I go for sushi, but this one was very different from how most places serve it.  It had no sauce and it was wrapped in a tiny sliver of seaweed. It was dry, but was fine after dipping in some soy sauce. From the regular roll I took a gander at the spicy hamachi which was yummy and not spicy. From the special roll menu we tried the Aloha (so tasty if you enjoy the garlic ponzu sauce, which I do. It's my favorite from this evening), shrimp lover (good as well), dragon (on point for the typical dragon), Nevada queen (I hated the cream cheese in this, but he enjoyed it), Summerlin (sweet flavor;similar to the dragon. My boyfriend enjoyed the avocado on it.), moon dog (another garlic ponzu flavor), and snow white (this was my boyfriend's favorite because it was  different and refreshing. I liked how crunchy it was). At the end instead of an ice cream treat which is included in the AYCE, we decided to pay more and have the teas. My boyfriend went for the Thai tea, no boba. They took a different spin on it, more creamy, but in a good way. I saw matcha milk tea, and I knew I had to try it, but with boba of course! It was refreshingly good. The server told me this was a new item on their menu and was enthused to hear how much I liked it.

1571000,2016-02-28,1,qpub9UXk8oBJr95oq-MbIg,"Start out with the good: service was great! The waitresses were quite nice and we were well tended to. 

The real meat of this review (HAHA!) is that none of the fish had any flavor. This was the blandest and most mediocre sushi I've ever had. I actually ended up salting everything I ordered (which was a lot, because I did the All You Can Eat). Here's a good application of my opinion: my wife decided she would be adventurous and try some sushi this time. I ordered a roll with things I knew she'd like, and when it came out I refused to let her try any of it. I was worried she would be put off of trying sushi again because this was a very poor example of what she should expect. 

The sauces were fine, which I'm not surprised about. Every sushi restaurant in town probably buys jugs of them from the same handful of distributors. 

The rice was fine, which I'm not surprised about because it isn't supposed to taste like anything.

The rolls were wrapped a bit poorly. The ingredients were distributed unevenly so the end pieces had almost nothing in them but rice. They were also loose I'm really, really poor with chopsticks but I keep trying. Loose rolls are very, very difficult to pick up. I ate half of my food with my fingers instead. 

Also, there was a lot of rice. The ratio of rice to fish to veg was definitely tilted toward rice, and definitely away from the fish. Not that it would have made much flavor difference -- the rice was more flavorful than the fish was -- but if I have the option of eating rice, which is completely empty of nutrition, and fish, which is exceptionally nutritious,the choice is clear. 

And it is really irritating to pay $12 for a roll of mostly rice with a little bit of low-quality fish in it.",7hnwrH20r6IiJOAlNOPgcw,4,0,1,RkjbEIDKyghEmE4cLcJ4yg
1617442,2015-12-24,9,qpub9UXk8oBJr95oq-MbIg,"They may have changed the sign out front, but it's still Tokyoto Sushi- same staff and chefs, same menu. Instead of AYCE, I usually opt for a la carte or lunch specials- the lettuce wrap app is as close to a riceless roll as you'll get here, but they do allow you to order handrolls sans rice, for an additional $1 each.

Lunch specials are on a separate menu. Even going during lunch, this menu is not provided upon seating. It's also not provided when you ask for it. I had to pull up their website menu on my phone before they brought over the lunch sushi combos list so I could order- kind of irritating. Other than that and forgetting my beverage for the duration of my visit, service was polite.

The lunch combo #3 is my favorite: miso soup and two gyoza, plus your choice of two special rolls from a limited list. The given options are just okay, most of them are shrimp tempura rolls. The namesake OMy roll and the Aladdin roll are both fairly plain, and the rice fell apart where sauces were used.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,16,10,3,uOmsy0LCAmex-N1-nztXlg

Well I arrived a bit earlier than my party, and the hostess decided to sit me.  First she was going to place me behind a wall, but I wanted to be near the tv since the marathon was on,  so sat closer to the door at the table that seated four; right in front of the tv.  Well I guess the manager(older woman) didn't like where I was seated in the resturant, and made me move to the table directly right across from the table I was seated-which was behind an artifical tree.  She gives me a lame excuse  ""since your going to be seated with a party of 3 this table is for 4 or more."" I question her motives stating ""the table your requesting me sit at is right next to this one, and it has 4 chairs too."" Not one to put up a fuss I moved to the table behind the tree  (still in sight of the tv) and next to a couple(2) sitting at a 4 sitter table as well. Lo and behold nobody sat at that table in fact they seated a couple with a toddler child 15 minutes after my arrival (see attaches image) 

The experience was so mortifying that I had no words- as the entire resturant seen this older woman direct me a ""black"" woman to be out of eyes view for no reason, besides my skin color . My appetite is now ruined- hate that I can't review the resturant as a whole, but CUSTOMER SERVICE is equally as important. The joke is, when my guest arrived  (white couple) they questioned why are we behind this tree?!

The service was good, the waiter always came up to us and asked if we needed anything else. The good thing is that I was able to order half rolls (4 pieces intead of 8).  I had many things on the menu and I enjoyed it all.  

I am a big Sea Urchin (uni) fan.  Uni has to be fresh and it has to have a specific taste.  The uni here was good, but I admitt I've had fresher else where. 

The sweet shrimp wasnt as good.  The head was delicious but the shrimp I could of lived without.  I get sweet shrimp every sushi place, but like the uni it has to be specific and fresh. 

The spoon shooter hit the spot.  Tuna with a delcious sauce on a spoon.  

The seared salmon was very delcious and fresh and just melted in my mouth.

We came to what seemed would be a nice dinning experience on a weekday and boy were we wrong. I have never experienced such horrible service! It all started with the waitress, she had to repeatedly confirm our order because she didn't write it down correctly. We all did all you can eat and seriously need to consider changing their name to You'll never Eat Sushi being that our entire order was coming out one by one every 20-25min or not coming out at all. We had to ask were our rolls were at several times and all we got was that they were coming. The restaurant was not busy for them to be that slow especially when there are four people making the sushi. One of the orders I placed in my first round came two hours later. You can tell the other diners were upset as they also would ask what was taking so long. We even had to ask for the waitress to refill our waters as they were not doing that either. I'm not the type of person to complain, but I was sure livid! But what made it worse is that they didn't even seem apologetic even after I expressed how upset we were. She was like yes the kitchen is slow. Really, that is all you can tell me. I must admit the rolls were good but definitely not worth the wait. We were there for over three hours and asked to speak to a manager since we felt that we should get a discount for what we had endured. But no manager was available. I was ready to walk out of that place because supposedly they could not even offer us a discount or just simply an apology. I'm not the person to just walk away and not pay, but was close to it after we finally continued to dispute our bill and got them to give us some type of compensation which we told her we would only pay them what we feel we should pay or walk out.

We saw the reviews and were excited to have a yummy AYCE sushi place by our house.
Upon walking it, hit by the overwhelming smell of dirty frying grease. yuck! And I wish I was exaggerating! We had to wash our clothes when we got home. It was disgusting.

We ordered the sashimi salad, which had a picture in the menu that looked tasty! Seasonal greens topped with a yummy selection of thick fresh sashimi. What we got was a fist full of iceberg lettuce and some paper thin slices tossed on with out care, dressing on the side. The good part, the dressing was actually pretty good!

We had some confusion on the sushi, we ordered one special roll, and received another. Our waitress told us it was a typo on the menu, and that the right name was on another roll a few down......ummmmm OK. We got that worked out, still not very good, sadly. Neither were the other rolls we ordered.

I sat wondering, how can this place have all these 5 star reviews? What are we missing? Or are we hitting a bad night? Then I look over and see a sign on the table that stated ""with your great Yelp review, you get a free beverage and a complimentary tea cup to take home."" 
OK... so I guess a lot of people needed the free drink? Or the tea cup?? Am I the only one that finds this a bit odd? Coercing good reviews for free schwag?

Impressed without partiality the second we walked in. We were greeted with accommodation and asked what we wanted to drink. Hot green tea for me, iced green tea for Ness please.

On the table a paper menu with a pen. Ooouuu all you can eat! I got excited. But our server removed the pen and paper menu... and the regular menu... Psych. Handed us laminated flip over menus. I was like hmmmm opposite from other AYCE places. Instead she wrote down our AYCE choices. It works... We can ""roll"" with that.

Didn't know there was AYCE here. Only wanted to eat sushi. Front and back menu listing tons of selections. Oh and they have boba pearl drinks! 

24 side appetizers ???!!! If you just did one of each with just appetizers, you're set. No need to eat the next day - just finish digesting.

105 sushi choices ???!!! Can we download an app that helps us decide? Hey Danny didja find out yet where we can DL the 'slap em upside the head' app? I think it will come in handy for this. Categories included:  Nigiri, baked, special, tempura, regular, deepfried, and veggie.

By the way, who's your mommy? I can tell you she's hot. Find her on the AYCE menu. Make sure you have an ice cold drink nearby.

1 dessert per person included: ice cream or mochi... If you can still fit in your belly.

Wasn't so bad the first time.  Our visit tonight was unbelievable.  Service was extremely slow and they weren't even busy.  There were 3 other parties there when we arrived and because it took so long for our food, all 3 of them left.  So we were the only ones there.  I ordered a sexy lady roll.  When I picked up the 4th piece there was a very long black hair.  I put the hair on my plate and swirled it in a circle.  We called the waitress over and she just smiled and took the plate out back.  She came back a short time later to question me as to whether the hair was in the roll or on the outside.  Told her it was on the inside. She goes back out back. When she finally comes back out she says that it is a dyed hair and not the hair of the lady that was making sushi earlier when we walked in. So I asked her if she was accusing me of lying and this was my hair.  She just stood there with a stupid grin on her face. She said there was no way it could have been on the inside because they cut the roll with a knife and the hair wouldn't have been that long.  The manager or owner never came over  to our table. They never offered any comp of our meal only stood there accusing me of planting the hair there.  Yes I have dyed hair but my hair is red and short.  So fuck off bitch.  It was the lady that was making sushi when we got there.  She had long black hair and was only pinned back with a bow.  If I could give them minus stars that would be my rating.

As for food we had quite a variety of things. My favorites were the Spoon Shooters, Screaming Orgasm, and the Garlic Hamachi. All three of these were delicious and I'd highly recommend trying them. As for the rolls we enjoyed a few different ones, but nothing really stood out as being spectacular. I can't say I tried anything I hated though so that's always a win.

The service was a little spotty though so I'm glad we sat at the sushi bar. There was a couple of times when I'd have to ask for a water refill or remind the waitress of the sake we ordered.

The waitress seemed annoyed like 'how dare these people try our special priced menu' but I ignored it and we ordered. The service was slow, and of the few questions we had regarding the food, the people were in too much of a hurry to explain much. Overall the food was what you would expect from an ayce place, I've had better and much worse, it was the service that guarantees I won't be returning.",3a8JVsABTdbJ8pLVX-Dcsw,1,0,2,VjOdQn3YAcmyod7uBi51Dg

I mean the one woman waiting on tables was all alone. But she was moving quickly. For what I've mentioned so far they deserve 5 stars. However, the ventilation is horrible. I now wreak of old thick oil. My kids needed to be taken outside twice due to the heavy oil smell. It felt like we were covered in grease, and breathing grease. That was horrible!!

We were seated right away at a table (by choice). The service was outstanding. Waitress took our drink order as soon as we were seated. Kirin Light Large $6.00. The menu is huge and the waitress was back right away to take our order. 

We ordered a ""ton"" of stuff, so I am not going to embarrass myself by listing it. Everything was so fresh and what I loved was that they were light on the rice. Most AYCE give you so much rice. The only complaint I have (not sure if it's legitimate) is that I ordered the screaming organism and I am used to the one at Sushi Fever so I was shocked when it arrived and was only 4 small pieces. I hope it's not that small if someone ordered it that was not doing AYCE. But I will say it was excellent. 

I will def. be returning t this place. They were so nice and the fish was cold and so fresh. If you are looking for a new AYCE check this place out. They have been open a month.",nixQjPlfVhMEhrNkmp5FDw,4,2,5,BJWeuI_OWWhRLTziPxIJJQ

I arrived before my husband and kids so the waitress came to take our drink orders. I order water for myself, Dr. Pepper for my honey and 2 lemonades for my kiddos. The lemonades came in nice plastics cups with lids. The only problem I had with this, is that my 7 y/old's lid had a fruit fly stuck underneath and there was a lliiitttlllee teeny black spec of something floating around. Now normally when there is something that was probably JUST alive resting in peace under your child's drink lid, that's a huge red flag. BUT we were SUPER cool about it. We alerted the waitress, who said nothing as she took his drink away. 
Shortly after she comes back out with, what we assume is a new cup of lemonade. By this time we are starving and ready to place our order. I pick up his cup, a low and behold. THE SAMMMMEEE FLIPPIN FRUIT FLY IS STILLL CHILLLIN UNDER HIS LID!!  She got rid of the littttlee teeny spec but not the actual insect????? 
At this point we walked out of the restaurant. 
This place could have the BEST sushi in the world but careless service and complete disregard for cleanliness is unacceptable.. Makes me wonder how many bugs are actually in the FOOD!!",EmB8MbDkxaV0aeF96Iz_wg,1,2,1,y2FW96QGMT51NvceV1qbMQ

Everything is super tasty and the price is fair. We got the all you can eat option and don't regret at all!

Saporo beer only U$3,50!
The AYCE has dessert also (mochi and ice cream).

But when our party of 8 came into the restaurant, we were hardly greeted by our waitress and did not feel very welcome. Our waitress often walked away while we were trying to order and our food came out very slowly, which left the others and I anxiously waiting for our food to be delivered. The fact that our food came out so slowly made us question whether or not we were going to be able to order everything and be satisfied within the 1 hour window of allotted to you when you order all you can eat sushi. 

The food is good and the sushi selection is great, but the service was very disappointing and underwhelming. The restaurant was not busy at the time as there was only two other tables occupied at the time. I definitely wouldn't want to come back.

They have a great menu and a variety to choose from, with curious sushi roll names like ""Snow white"" or ""who's your daddy"". I especially love one roll that they call ""Johnny"" roll, which you can only order once if you opt to get their ""all you can eat"" menu, but so worth it, as it's an absolute treat. This place is good for the whole family, date night, boys or girls night out. It's small and intimate, so you're not competing to talk over other people, and the staff there is very welcoming, greeting you in Japanese with a warm smile.

The uni was good and the unagi was great but for the other fish pretty plain.  The salmon kama was good and recommend that. We also got the salmon skin hand roll would pass on that.
