BBQ short ribs, REAL mashed potatoes with broccoli and salad.  It was a breeze to work with Lisa and she had great ideas that fit my budget.  I HIGHLY recommend using Lisa Marie's Catering for any event.",a9MnUgLEffj6x2Mu-NRgFA,3,1,5,VMPvkGSFauEBaJK-AfFwyw
1404803,2018-05-17,0,v4fuuR7iuyNzPXu_O3jSmA,Lisa Marie was able to pull together a luncheon for us for over forty people with less than 24 hours notice. She and her staff were extremely organized and professional. The food was top notch and all of the attendees raved about how good everything tasted. Lisa Marie and her staff did an amazing job. We were very satisfied with the service and would definitely use them again.,ECiR-fQnwNWfoiaAQO_Lrg,1,0,5,gN6VtCUQiQYhOeK3LiI_iQ

We had a company party at our home a few weeks ago and we are so happy to have found them.  They made every so easy for us including taking care of details like tables and linen rental and a bartender.  Their professionalism made us look good and they were so relaxed and a pleasure to work with. 

I was put at ease when Lisa offered to stop by our home prior to the event to look at the space.  We were able to decide where to place the bar and tables and finalize the menu.   This is a nice touch not everyone offers. They came early to set up and were totally prepared so there was no drama at all. Best of all the food looked and tasted delicious.   We went with a BBQ buffet and everyone was pleased with the menu and quality of the food.  

So thank you Lisa, Mark and Lynn for a beautiful party.  We will rely on you for any future events we may have.  Excellent job!

I had 5 events with them in a week.  We hired her to do our catering and bartending for some business events we had that week.  Her and Mark are awesome!  Super personable, super professional and a great deal! 

They definitely made my life super easy.
 

I would totally recommend them for any of your event needs.",XFeODhLGorlIXaKYlfOOYw,0,0,5,JW9XtkD1Ihrz8ro7-iDu3w

First of all, she's wonderful to work with, accommodating, punctual and easy to communicate with, plus her food is nothing short of fantastic. 
 
I work with caterers around the country as I bounce around hosting events for a national company. Because I plan everything from the West Coast, I need accessible vendors I can count on even if I'm hundreds or thousands of miles from them. Not only is Lisa a true professional, but she also has the patience of a saint. When I was waiting months for a venue to confirm my event date, Lisa worked with me, putting my mind at ease and holding my event date. When I asked her the same questions three times, just to be sure, she confirmed and assured me everything was taken care of - and it was. Her bar manager, Mark, texted me the evening before my party for 200 to ensure all details were taken care of and offering services the morning event if necessary. 
 
Even with all of this above-and-beyond customer service, I wasn't prepared for the day of the event. One of their team members arrived early, quite early. Instead of sitting around and waiting for his team, seeing me setting up, moving tables, etc., he jumped right in and helped until his co-workers arrived and it was time for him to ""work."" Everyone involved was all smiles, friendly and efficient. As the event started, I was treated like a guest with both Lisa and Mark checking on me, offering drinks and food. 
 
I chose an eclectic mix: ahi tuna bites, antipasta skewers, petite BBQ pork and slaw sandwiches, various crostini and more. Of course, her team's handcrafted margaritas were a huge hit. Actually, everything was a hit! 
 
Although I can't say enough good things about Lisa Marie's Catering and every, single person I worked with, I have to get back to work!",TA6E6wPZ3L3AfQ6P1v30IQ,1,0,5,fODRq-wTL-8OPPbAKV4ktA

There is no food in the park and the nearest restaurants were impractical and unappealing. Lisa brought us delicious lunches everyday that the crew LOVED. One night the director even said, ""all I can think about is what we're having for lunch tomorrow."" She even accomodated dietary restrictions. She delivered promptly each day and was generally a joy. Would definitely recommend.",Vq_YjUZVB1RQRRDF4mXAfQ,2,0,5,Q9pQEg0_u0Qktmv1OuLPzA
