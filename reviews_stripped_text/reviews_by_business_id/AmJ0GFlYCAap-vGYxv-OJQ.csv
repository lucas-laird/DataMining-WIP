123999,2011-04-15,2,AmJ0GFlYCAap-vGYxv-OJQ,"Rocky's is a typical Vegas tavern. They have a bar you can smoke in with pool tables, golden tee and video poker. There's also a non smoking restaurant. 

The food is good, had the Appetizer sampler last night and everything was excellent. Onion rings were thick and crispy. Chicken wings were good, mozzarella sticks were awesome and the nachos were also very good. It came on a plate big enough to serve a Thanksgiving turkey with a myriad of sauces.

Full bar, lots of beer on tap. Didn't see a wine list or ask for specialty cocktails so can't comment on that. Jukebox plays whatever kind of music you pick so if you start playing classic rock it will keep with that genre.

Staff is very friendly and attentive.",MnDpS5jNtwi_HTSY2fMbPg,5,2,4,aB-7DEhRsHY1jV3AMQAuYA

Kevin, hands down, is probably, no is the best bartender I have every met. The food has gotten so much better over the last couple months.  Joe, the owner is always trying new things.  I made the mistake of going to another local bar and having dinner (chicken tenders) and  I have to say they were over breaded and over priced.  Rocky's chicken tenders were bigger, lightly breaded, and the hot sauce was much better.  Even though I don't eat chicken wings, I highly recommend them.

We had onion rings (Vidalias) as appetizer, cheeseburger & fries, fish & chips,  and a Reuben. The side salad could have been a meal itself.  Onion rings were freshly-made hot with in-house made ranch dressing.  The burger was cooked perfect medium.  The fish was crispy and hot with tasty slaw and tarter sauce.  The Reuben was good, with more meat than kraut and good Thousand Island dressing, but salty.  Rounded out with raspberry tea and no room for dessert, we left satisfied.  Roland provided attentive service.  We definitely recommend, but suggest you eat on the right side (not bar) if smoke is an issue for you.",Q3cek0fOPRXxJJrbeT2sGA,0,0,5,HnJxESFNymwEYr4WSRCH7Q

734030,2011-12-16,2,AmJ0GFlYCAap-vGYxv-OJQ,"Having been here often (breakfast, lunch and dinner and we've had nearly everything on the menu over the years) we've experienced good food and service about 70% of the time and then 30% of the time it's been...meh. Rocky's was a Timbers for years and when the ownership changed, the price of their food went down but the ingredients for most of their dishes also became noticeably reduced in quality. The upside is that the portions are pretty big for the price.

(On that note, I was surprised that Joyce was mentioned as giving good service because if she's the Joyce who has served us, we've experienced her disappear for long periods of time and seeing the bartender or another waitress notice us and pick up the slack in her section often.)

But the price is right for solid bar food, friendly bartenders, (mostly) good wait staff and lots of great seats - tables, large booths and a non-bar dining area- to watch sports on their many TV's. The alcohol selection's not huge but they have everything from Miller Lite and Bud to Guinness and Bass on tap. Plus, there are drink specials and once the bartenders get to know you (pretty quickly), they can get you what you need quick enough, whether beer or mixed drinks.

Also, calling Rocky's a gastropub is misleading. It is like other ""locals"" taverns that give the off-Strip Vegas dining scene its unique character (PT's, Steiner's, Village Pub). It's a good go-to place for inexpensive bar food and a place to watch the game or celebrate St. Patrick's Day with your friends, but neither the food nor the decor is  what most people think of as ""gastro."" For that, try Shakespeare's on Eastern Ave. or off-Strip Irish pubs like McMullan's or Molly Malone's.

Overall, don't go to Rocky's expecting amazing food, but the portions are large, you won't spend a lot of money for them and your bartender will treat you right. If you need a place to watch the big game, it's also not a bad place to be.",43nXxZLfX8nPUNzQlPpUeA,3,2,3,SrcPLsNWwH8onSQ_4yMCgA

My only complaint is they removed the outstanding beef tips from the dinner menu - this was a signature dish that was always worth the trip, darn tasty.  It is s shame, but the rest of the menu is outstanding, top quality, I have never been disappointed and I have tried about 60% of the menu so far.

My boyfriend and I usually order enough to have lunch and dinner the next day, which includes a pizza, chicken fingers, and a sandwich. Once in awhile, onion rings. Our regular server always leaves a pitcher of iced tea on the table for my guy, who is an iced tea camel to the highest degree, not because she doesn't have time to be back but because she knows he will down it. I cannot say enough about the service here. It has NEVER been bad.

The owner of the restaurant can often be seen talking with his guests and I have been lucky enough to chat with him for awhile. He's very nice and has a lot of standards for his restaurant. He really does care about everything in his restaurant.

4466760,2016-03-06,1,AmJ0GFlYCAap-vGYxv-OJQ,This bar deserves a 5 star review and I'm just the girl to give it. The bartenders are all very nice and attentive.  The bartenders actually pay attention where other bars it seems like some of the bartenders will get caught up with conversations or with there phones so it's nice to have solid 5 star attention. They have 2 pool tables that I try to play but I'm not any good. I think I need instructions. The jukebox has like every song ever sang by anybody who has ever has a microphone. The bar has a lot of seating options along with some booths and a very very small lounge area.

4655491,2015-02-09,7,AmJ0GFlYCAap-vGYxv-OJQ,"The good old  Las Vegas bar and grill, the place where the end of the work week merges into the weekend. This past Saturday, Rocky's Bar &  Grill (abbreviated Rocky's) was the bar and grill where my work week merged into my weekend. 

  Rocky's is located in the small shopping center at the southeast corner of Maryland Parkway at Windmill Lane. The locally famous Grouchy John's Coffee Shop is the landmark. 

  For a couple of years I had been parking near Rocky's when I hung out in Grouchy John's. I never stepped inside until this weekend. 

  In similar style to many bars and grills, Windows here are nonexistent. Once I stepped inside the heavy brown doors, I left the outside world for an isolated world of dining, gambling, and moderate drinking. In similar style to several bars and grills, the layout is a dimly lit restaurant separate from the smoky bar and lounge. 

  From the time I walked through the doors, I waited a few minutes to be acknowledged. The host and only waiter Roland arrived a few minutes later. He was friendly and professional. He invited me to sit anywhere. I chose a comfortable booth in a room that was sporadically populated and quiet to the degree that it is a nice place for a date or me time. The primary sounds were the hard Rock classics playing at a soft volume. 

  My mind was set on the chicken parmesan sandwich. When it came time to ordering, Roland let fall that it is a hero style sandwich that doesn't come with fries. Okay. I'd order the fish & chips. 

  The three large pieces of cod and the steak fries were tastational and filling. The portions were large to the point of Roland placing a second plate containing  bowls of tarter sauce and cole slaw. The cole slaw was out of this World. Rocky gives the knockout punch with the cole slaw. I give Rocky's kudos for including cole slaw with the fish & chips. In my opinion, fish & chips without cole slaw is like nachos without cheese. Yet, it amazes me that there are so many restaurants that just don't get it and exclude cole slaw with fish &  chips. A few restaurants that I lately reviewed that are guilty of this are Village Pub and Red Robin. This delicious cole slaw rounded up my rating from 3.5 to 4 stars. The fish &  chips with bottomless Pepsi came out to $14.47 before tipping Roland. 

  If I was still hungry, I could of ordered a homemade apple cobbler or vanilla ice cream. Subsequently to the end of the work week dinner, I  headed for the beginning of the weekend revelry in the bar/lounge. 

  The bar/lounge is a long rectangular space with sofa style chairs and a bar with monitors above showing sports and video gaming below. I played my video Keno while enjoying a $3 PBR and watching the UFC. I shared the bar and lounge with a friendly clientele. 

  Time went by fast. When I opened the heavy brown door to return to the real World I had a few thoughts lingering on the isolated World of Rocky's. As I put the thoughts to words they are that this is a good spot in the Southeast Valley to enjoy tasty fish & chips that include delicious Cole slaw before a cold one and some moderate gaming or watching a sports event. 

        I                                                                  I

Ordered the 14"" garlic chicken pizza ( based on previous reviews) to go with my IPA.  

The garlic chicken pizza is cooked to perfection topped with diced peppers, tomatoes, onions, bacon and of course garlic sauce.  Definitely hit the spot.  

Pizzas range in prices here from 8.99 (cheese),  9.99 (pepperoni)  (margherita), 11.99 (garlic chicken) (BBQ chicken) and the Supreme (12.99) 


Breakfast specials are large and tasty.  I enjoy them frequently Saturday mornings after my group run with LVR. 

The California omelette, French Toast and the Dueces special being my favorites.

The food is really good, although it's nothing beyond typical bar food.

They've had Golden Tee 2012 for about a month now, which makes my guy friend super happy.  They have been addicted to that game for years now and go in just to play it.

Be careful using your debit card here.  I go here regularly and noticed on my bank account recently that I had been  charged twice after a night there.  I had 1 beer and chicken fingers, so I know it wasn't a case of ""forgetting"" how much you owed.
