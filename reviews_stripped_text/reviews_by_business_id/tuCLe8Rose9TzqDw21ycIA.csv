But, Went in on Saturday with the family, Finally talked the wife into going in.  We placed our orders (They were out of the BBQ Pork.  Bummer).  When we got the orders the portions were smaller then we normally get at work.  I was sitting in the front while eating and observed that the family behind got the portion size I was used too getting when ordering from work.  The Cashier/Cook (Tall Bald Guy) was kind of squirrely/hesitant/standoffish the whole time we were there.  The eating area could have used a little cleaning but I have seen worse.  Just didn't have a comfortable experience while there.  Wife and kids had to stop someplace else to grab some more food due to the small portions Lava Grill provided.  Highly unlikely I'll be able to get the family to go back there again.",OYPTqe2OiivMnoJmH3Mn0Q,1,0,2,0jAlo0BpcFe4L9Alp5gUBg

225736,2015-07-29,0,tuCLe8Rose9TzqDw21ycIA,"Yesterday I called in an order of white meat chicken, brown rice and vegetables for lunch.  The man who answered the phone responded ""We'll get to it when we can,"" which didn't really give me a hint of when I should leave to pick it up.  I had the address but didn't know exactly where it was located although I had an idea.  I asked if they were in the same shopping center where Gold's used to be.  He said ""the address is on the menu.""  He couldn't tell me they were in the same complex as Subway or Enterprise which was weird.  I found it and waited about 5 min. to get the order. As others have said, it's very small inside, not a lot of tables but just about every table had a person waiting for a pick-up order.  It was very smoky inside from the grill, they had a fan blowing full blast next to where I was sitting, I wouldn't have wanted to eat there.  I think they need better ventilation.  When I got back to my office to eat, I really couldn't tell if the chicken was white meat but the flavor was pretty good.  The rice was chewy and I didn't care for the vegetables which were barely cooked and the pieces of cabbage(?) were too large.  For the price ($4.39) it's not bad if you are craving a teriyaki bowl but don't want to spend much more at Panda.",6gL9KyY04VchdaqhYYoKUQ,0,0,3,DpY_rK7y1VCwg7-9LWkLzw

Make sure you are really hungry if you order an entree with the double meat.

Basically it is the meat of your choice cooked over lava rocks, and served with rice or noodles, and veggies. The veggies are cabbage, broccoli and carrot slices. I had the chicken, done GREAT. A friend had same as me, and another friend had the pork with noodles and veggies. You can get extra meat for $2 more but it is really not necessary. I tried my buddy's pork and it was good but the chicken was REALLY good. All three of us got a bottled water ($1 each). The two of us that got chicken ordered the extra meat helping as we didn't know better. Too much food and for all three dinners after tax was $23 and change. A side note, you order at the counter then sit, and then pick it up at the counter. It all comes in a Styrofoam container whether eating in or not.

1503486,2016-01-27,13,tuCLe8Rose9TzqDw21ycIA,"Not to be confused with the 2005 movie Shark Boy and Lava Girl, Lava Grill is a handy, healthy option when you're too lazy to meal prep but want to hit your macros and/or eat clean on a budget. Menu selections are beef, chicken, or salmon, on your choice of white or brown rice, with or without vegetables. The meats are actually cooked on lava rocks for a nice char, and it smells great in here.

But on my first visit, they were out of salmon and on my second they were out of brown rice, which was disappointing considering their menu is already pretty limited. They offer ""lava sauce"" and bottles of Sriracha to add flavor to your food. Everything's fresh and made to order, décor is a little sparse. Wish they had additional sauce options as my food was kind of plain, with just a small drizzle of (teriyaki?) sauce with the meat.

1747066,2016-03-02,0,tuCLe8Rose9TzqDw21ycIA,"I needed a quick inexpensive lunch and I was in the neighborhood. Based on the Yelp reviews, I chose Lava Grill.
Ambiance: This is a small storefront restaurant in a non-descript strip mall. Easy to drive by unless you know it is there. The restaurant itself is very small. Maybe 10 feet from the front door to the counter where you place your order, maybe 15 feet wide. About 8 tables for 2, no decorating. Everything was clean. Clearly, the design is for take-out, not for dining in. After I sat down, four other orders came in. The resulting cooking caused the room to become fairly smokey.
Service: You place your order at the counter. You pick it up when the food is ready - so no service to speak of. The food is ready in about 10 minutes.
Food: I ordered the chicken and beef box with rice and cabbage ($2 extra for the extra meat). My wife got double chicken and veggies. The food was OK, not great but fit the bill for an acceptable fast, inexpensive meal. After I added extra Lava sauce (you have to ask for it. A very small container with about a tablespoon of something that looked like soy sauce). that improved the taste greatly.
Value: I really wanted to like this place. It struck me as a Ma and Pa operation, and they were trying really hard. Portion size was fairly generous. Lunch for 2 with double meat was about $16. Some of the options were as inexpensive as $4. I think the most expensive was about $8.

When we arrived the cashier was not very personable but was not rude either - I gather that it was just his personality.  I didn't take it personally.  I ordered the beef with vegetable double beef.  Also, the chicken and rice, no veg.  It came to under $13.00...sweet!! It is open and you can smell the grilling.  Another worker came from the back and was very friendly.  I asked about delivery to a big organization and they were very helpful and seemed to be willing to accommodate.  Especially because it would be for 20+ orders. We got our food and took it home.  Upon opening, I was disappointed to find that the beef was not as pictured.  Instead of pieces of cut up thin steak, it looked like ground beef, except it was quadruple chopped cheap meat.  There were lots of hard gristle bits that made it completely unappetizing.  The flavor was good but the texture was horrible. The vegetables were steamed and tasteless.  The chicken was definitely better, there was a very distinct char taste and had pretty good flavor.  I'm going to force myself to give it another try because I see the potential it has.  The flavor is there, the concept is good, the prices are great, but I would gladly pay up to $5.00 more, for better quality meat.  I'm not giving up on you yet, Lava Grill, we need more businesses like you, I speak for many who are tired of fast nasty food.

I ordered the beef short ribs (Kalbi) with beef and brown rice. Everything was delicious.. The Kalbi was cooked just right and the beef had some type of sauce that was made with love because it was so darn good! The only reason I gave it 4 stars was because the quantity of the food.

2906719,2016-05-27,0,tuCLe8Rose9TzqDw21ycIA,"Don't tell them you want your meat well-done. It'll come out burned and black.

First off, when we entered the place the glass front door was extremely filthy. I have never been to a restaurant where the first thing you see is filth.

We ordered the chicken bowl without veggies and a pork bowl with veggies and an extra side of meat. The pork was ordered well done because it was pork but it came to us being very burned and we could not eat it. The restaurant was good enough to replace it with another serving of the same meat but less burned.

The vegetables were scant for the extra money we had to pay for it and my friend said it wasn't worth the money, plus the veggies were soggy and limp.

Flavor was very good but the soy sauce on the rice was just a bit overbearing and too strong for my liking.

If you just want a cup of water, they don't have it. You have to purchase one of their beverages. If you want to use the restroom, you have to go outside of the building, walk around the back and there's a rest room in the back of the building.

My friend could not take the almost-constant loud pounding coming from the kitchen area. It was giving her a headache, not to mention that the smell of grilling was strong and we finally decided to leave for a quieter and less odorous place. When we were outside in the parking lot, the smoky smell was still in our nostrils - not to mention hair and clothing, and we had to wipe out the smell from our noses with a tissue.

For the amount of chicken I had in my bowl, I didn't think it was worth the money since most of the area was consumed by rice. My friend said it was certainly not worth the money paid for HER bowl of pork with the added-on beef which was an extra charge of course.

She and I agreed that we would not be going back.",jIH2fzQfXY7RW3C3W1Z1iQ,2,0,2,-VPUmyGyqsbhhybblEgcnw

They do have Free Refills for the Fountain Drinks, and Canned Hawaiian Sun in a Variety of Flavors, and Bottled Water next to the Fountain Drink Machine. 

It is a little small for a Family to dine there...because of limited seating, I didn't see a Restroom, but you can ask them.

**There are a Few Con's that you should be aware of: 1) If You Do Dine in, Please be aware that you will Smell like BBQ when you leave, and it does get smoky in there! 2) The parking in front of the Businesses in the area are 15 Minute Parking Stalls...So you will have to park in the Middle stalls...that place can get busy, and the stalls get filled quickly! 3) There are No High chairs for Toddlers or Babies, should you Dine with Any little ones.

The veggies are perfectly al dente. And you've got a choice between white or brown rice. 

The only down side was everything was served in styrofoam. We know this is ""Hawaiian Style"" of food service, but uhhhhg yuck. Still I'm not gonna knock their overall excellent food and super-friendly service for this one minuet detail.",zlo2SXZBwhbx6JlsVHme5Q,3,0,4,_iGlNdy9wdAbiA-7eW3L-A

5454843,2016-09-18,0,tuCLe8Rose9TzqDw21ycIA,I come here every so often for lunch and I'm never disappointed. I usually get the beef noodle box and the beef is so juicy and flavorful and the noodles are perfectly cooked. The veggies are also steamed perfectly and not too hard.,P19z16iz5I9Hh4T99pY8Sg,0,0,5,Ppr440BdP8rY868KuuH_FA
5455631,2015-03-26,0,tuCLe8Rose9TzqDw21ycIA,"I freaking love this place. It's so affordable, and you can taste the grilled flavor on the food, but NOT burnt. It's quiet in here whenever I come, and food prep takes about 10 minutes, then it's ready. I have gotten the #6 pork/veggies/white rice twice and will order it again and again. This place is convenient and easy to love.",vAQFhyntPvDPyrpAlANROw,1,0,5,SG31Lk4OUZnk5gWMh8BO4g

Apparently their ac broke down but that didnt stop us from eating there. There was only one person working there at that time and he looked like a manager or maybe owner...? He was nice to us and even gave us free cannes juice to make up for the hot dining area lol.",r7NCkJbvwc9QAp6udyBF-A,0,0,5,9eSQoeKxk5WTmfnFMgovPA

5827876,2015-07-29,0,tuCLe8Rose9TzqDw21ycIA,"I just arrived in Vegas & was hungry. My daughter just moved to this side of Vegas so we used Yelp to get suggestions. This place is amazing .We got chicken with veggies & beef with veggies. The chicken was grilled & cut into strips laying over a bed of brown rice. There was a slight sweet sauce as well. The veggies were extremely awesome. The beef was shredded & also over a bed of rice with the awesome sauce & veggies. The tables were few but turn over was fairly quick. The place is clean & the owners were awesome & went out of their way to help us. My daughter had her baby with her, who needed changed & they let her use the employee restroom. Very healthy option for lunch or dinner. I rarely give 5 stars so this says a lot about how great the food is as well as all other aspects.",fe6YAJqcqiiTCUVosY806w,1,0,5,AmyP71uhbpNxzAp4A8oEdA
5978320,2016-07-12,0,tuCLe8Rose9TzqDw21ycIA,"Good prices and decent portions- just enough to fill you up. 

The food is fresh- grilled meat, fresh veggies, and a choice of brown or white rice. 

I ordered their signature chicken w/ veggies combo. For the most part, it was good, but there were a lot of burnt pieces of meat. 

Don't come here looking for an ambient dine-in; two-seater tables and not much else. You'll be here strictly for the food!

Not the best first impression, but I'd like to try the rest of the menu out.",c8bXqrwwCgiV5E6D9pcWpw,0,0,3,__0DEdz5nE1G2GFXp09k5w
