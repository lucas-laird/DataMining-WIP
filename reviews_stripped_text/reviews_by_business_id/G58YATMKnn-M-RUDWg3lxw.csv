61623,2011-10-24,0,G58YATMKnn-M-RUDWg3lxw,"I stay at the Four Seasons this time in Vegas. Friends told me about The Cafe. It's walking distance from my hotel. I thought why not give it a try. 

So here I am. Sitting at The Cafe having my breakfast and writing this Yelp review. I don't normally do this, but the hostess is so rude and annoying that I have to come vent immediately.

I arrived with my computer and some books, ready to eat and work. There were several solo business travelers here as well. The place was quite empty, so most of them were seated in a booth or a bigger table. When it was my turn to be seated, the hostess took me to the smallest, most crowded table in the room. I needed space for my computer and stuff, so I told her I would like to be seated at one of the empty booth (she just seated a solo business man in the booth next to the one I wanted.) She refused and gave me a booth that's right behind the entrance. It's the worst booth in the room, dark and crowded. She gave me a dirty look and left. 

Fortunately my waiter is super nice. I told him that I wanted to move to the other booth that's more comfortable. He had no problem with it. When I was moving my stuff, the hostess saw me and gave me another super nasty look.

Ok. It's 9AM on Monday in Vegas. The Cafe is empty. I don't know what her problem is that she gives every solo diner (mostly caucasian men) nice booths and give me the smallest table in the room. When I told her I needed more space, she gave me such nasty attitude.

On top of that, the breakfast is just blah. My nice waiter deserves a star and that's why I am giving this place two stars instead of one.",InnH44pPmvHffTruiLufdg,0,0,2,M_DD1VHICoOE2ardsAe_Wg

The yogurt had lemon in it and the granola was super high quality. This morning I had the special which was a cheddar biscuit sliders with egg and sausage.

Overall, it is pretty pricey but the food was good. Coffee is good, too, but $4. We had the blue crab benedict and the smoked pork benedict. The crab entree was incredibly flavorful. The amount of crab was disappointing for a $24 dish. The brioche layer was pretty dry. The smoked pork benny was simpler but also tasty. It had nice cuts of pork belly but there was not even a hint of smoke. We each tried a very expensive bloody mary and those did not disappoint.

I came here for breakfast since it is the most convenient place for THEhotel guests.  There were 4 of us in my party and our bill came to about $90.  The coffee was great and everyone enjoyed their meals.  We didn't get hungry again until dinner time!

It's a shame the service and wait was pathetic for the price I'm paying for. 20 bucks for a burger tells its story. I mean it was an awesome burger, it was HUGE, and delicious. I got to order how I want it. Just the meat itself and the buns with lettuce is already about 10 bucks, others are topping. Of course I want my special cheese, grilled onions, sunny side up eggs, bacon, and mushroom in my burger. I assume each is about a dollar, so if my math adds up right, 20 should cover everything.

This might sound strange, but I wasn't expecting such large portions. It seems that in classy establishments (which this place tries to be), the more food is, the smaller the portions (quality over quantity I guess?). This place isn't cheap, but the portions were large. People at other tables were also talking about how much food they got. 

It is pricey though. A small glass of OJ is $5 (but it's good). I think we paid about $58 for breakfast (ouch!). If I would have thought about it more ahead of time, I probably would have gone to b-fast at the Four Seasons (I think it's called Veranda?) for that price.

There were no complaints around the table and with good reason! My huevos rancheros was fantastic! It was a combo of rancheros and verdes, which was a pleasant surprise by far. The sauces were great and the tortilla was a perfect combo between crunchy and soaked in deliciousness. The only thing I could have done without was the chorizo. With everything else going on, it wasn't very spicy and didn't really add much to the dish. Some sausage or bacon on the side would have been fine. My mouth is watering just thinking of this again.

So, after hearing other conference attendees bemoan overpriced meals at The Strip for mediocre victuals, I was determined not to become a Sin City victim. Yelp delivered, and so did TheCafe. I met a co-worker for breakfast, and I ordered the blue crab benedict (BLUE crab, not your Dungeness wannabe crustacean), while she ordered the smoked pork benedict.

Presentation, superb. I asked for the sauce on the side, but since there were chunks of sumptuous crab flesh in there, that completely evaporated my good will. Perfectly runny eggs and crab sat on a perfectly toasted brioche -- the only drawback is that the brioche gets soggy quickly, so you have to eat a bit faster. My co-worker really enjoyed (and photographed) her breakfast. 

My benedict ran about $20, but for blue crab in the middle of a desert, that proved reasonable to me. Ambiance incidentally was very steel-gray-and-dark-wood modern.

You probably have passed by the place before and noticed its always dark, closed or maybe even out of business. That is far from the truth... they just happen to only serve breakfast and lunch here and close down for dinner.

We actually ended up eating here the first and second morning of our stay here. If your staying in THE Hotel like we were, it pretty convenient to grab breakfast here and the food happens to be very good and reasonably priced.

For my first visit here, I ordered the two egg breakfast with the Portuguese sausage. The sausage is pretty freaking good. The eggs and hash browns were the perfect food after a long night of drinking. You get your protein from the eggs, grease from the sausage, and hash browns to fill your stomach to settle it. Great breakfast here.

On my second visit the following morning, I ordered the smoked salmon plate with plain bagel. The smoked salmon was great. Salty but not too salty... just the right amount. They bagel was fresh, but not the hot you might find at your local bagel shop. It came with cream cheese (of course), slices of shallots, capers, tomatoes, and etc. I really enjoyed the smoked salmon. I will definitely have to order this again if I stay at THE Hotel.

Overall, I am completely sold on this place. Great food, the decor is modern and grabs your attention, and the service is awesome.

This was a great breakfast!! I ordered the Dry Aged Ribeye and 3 Eggs and the wife orders the Bacon and 2 Eggs with a side of pancakes. To begin with the steak was at least a 10 oz and would have set you back minimum twice as much at any steak place on the Strip, or back home for that matter. Cooked perfectly medium with a nice char on the edges, they somehow know how I like a breakfast steak it seems, lightly seasoned just salt and pepper to taste the steak and not some sauce . Both meals had absolutely perfect eggs, I am a scrambled person and the wife is over medium and both were perfectly done and served hot despite cooking time differences in the two. It has been said by some chefs that an egg is one of the hardest things to cook right, due to the sensitivity to temperature of the proteins. THEcafes cook has definitely figured that out in any style you like. The hash browns were the star, aside from the steak of course, they are a caramelized onion and parsley hash that are both seasoned and crisped to a golden brown. They are not greasy like some places make them, ughh, and not cooked dry to the extent of turning to patties of starch covered in bland seasoning. Extremely good is what they are! The pancakes, while not my particular favorite ,style was wonderfully done, sweet with a crisp exterior made of a heavier batter more cake like than I am used to, but very good. The coffee, while sevred in a carafe, French Press would be nice :), was deep and richly flavored with nice a fresh finish to it and no aftertaste to cover the food up.

It looks really nice and fancy and is located shortly after you enter Mandalay Bay's THE Hotel.  I really want to stay at THE Hotel now because it looked so nice and I could just pop in at THE Cafe for breakfast.

The French Toast did not disappoint, it was amazing!!!  It would've been nice if white chocolate had been drizzled on top and the raspberries infused within the French Toast.  The raspberries were on the side and there were not a lot and a white chocolate flavor was infused in the French Toast.  Still very good and my favorite breakfast of this last trip!

2918218,2012-01-02,0,G58YATMKnn-M-RUDWg3lxw,"**Breakfast Review**

The Cafe at THEhotel is the best breakfast establishment in the Mandalay Bay complex. I would recommend it for anyone who wants a quality breakfast with large portions...but beware, as you might expect at a swanky hotel with a pretentious name, you will be shelling out big bucks for the privilege.

Food:
The food is straight up good and the star of both our visits. The build-your-own three-ingredient Omelet was huge and the ingredients fresh and plentiful. I went with the bacon, spinach, aged cheddar omelet both days and was very happy I did. The hash browns were excellent and not at all greasy and the bread was also very good.

Price:
The entrees are a little over what you would expect, but not much. It's the drinks that will kill you. For the price of one ~5oz. glass of Orange Juice, you would expect someone to grind the orange right in front of you...or something like that. No refills either. You're getting cha-chinged each time you want another thimble of OJ. Coffee and tea are also priced well above even what Starbucks charges.

Service:
Mediocre at best. We had a difficult time flagging down anyone if our drinks went dry or if we had a problem. Additionally, REVIEW YOUR BILL. We were charged for two coffees we never ordered. The server laughed off her mistake, but I didn't find it so funny at their prices.

Ambiance:
The restaurant's decor is very modern, with extremely high ceilings and open walls to the public walkway. You sort of feel on display, but you also feel like the people walking by are longing for the giant omelet in front of you. :)

So, if you are looking for a great breakfast at Mandalay Bay, but aren't afraid of paying high prices or being let down by service, The Cafe is THErestaurant at THEhotel to visit.",YfVcGgtfxoFw4ATUj2Y3HA,0,0,3,QfTdviZSvxYytRMCydMcQg
2983555,2011-02-25,0,G58YATMKnn-M-RUDWg3lxw,"Review for BREAKFAST

Enjoyed b-fast this morning with my GF.  
Pulled up to Valet, walked in and it was right there.
So easy to access.

MENU:
Loads of options... from pancakes, waffles, french toast to ""pigs in a blanket"" (breakfast burrito), lobster and caviar eggs, make your own omelet, steak and eggs, smoked salmon (aka lox and bagels), crab eggs benedict plus other great sounding entrees.

TASTE:
I *tried* to be good... I ordered an egg white omelet with spinach, mushrooms and chicken.  It was served with hash brown and a big thick yummy slice of toast.  (I love toast.) 

Anyways... the omelet was BIG and fluffy with big chuncks of juicy chicken.  I only ate 1/2..it was very filling.  
And I only ate 1/2 of my hash browns and only 1/2 of the toast.  I really wanted to eat ALL of the toast but thought that might make me too full.  The hash browns were nothing special... in fact they were the downer to the whole meal.... they were crunchy in sections and soggy in other parts.  Anyways... I really enjoyed my omelet and toast.  :)

BLOODY MARY:
Also ordered the Classic Bloody Mary... YUM!  These folks know how to make a good Bloody Mary.  If you've read some of my other reviews... you know that I like to order these to see how well they are executed. I would definitely order another BM from here.  :)  The celery was fresh and the olives were plump and juicy.  The bloody mary itself was not overly tomato-y and had a nice spice to it.  And more importantly, it was not water-y or thin like some other places that try to take poor quality BM mix and fix it with horse radish or by putting more vodka in it.

My GF ordered the French toast and it looked Good.  She really enjoyed it.

The presentation of the food and the condiments was very nice.  Love that they serve individual jars of jelly with the toast.

SERVICE:  Friendly, fast

PRICE: On the high side... for our 2 meals and our 2 BMs... total was $56.  But... I'm so full still that I won't be eating lunch.",PV0VEhlmhc2BjzMZEbpWlg,0,0,4,kkL-4hPwmRTItowMz21twg

I had purchased a restaurant.com gift certificate for theCafe before the trip and the menu looked good and the atmosphere quiet, so we treked over to theCafe to try it out.

One of the best things about theHotel is that it smells so nice...like lavender (not old lady perfume like some places...AHEM...Monte Carlo). And the Cafe sits in an open walkway in the hallway between Mandalay and theHotel, so you get a little of that ""Cafe"" feel.

Our server was nice but things were painfully slow. I did like that we got a whole pot of coffee to ourselves (and dear god we needed it). We both ordered the crab cake benedicts, which were good but kind of spicy. I think I only ate half of mine.

Be ready to shell out for this meal though. Like other yelpers have mentioned, the meal is still expensive even with the $25 off from restaurant.com.

Four stars for food, two for service, one for price. 

We'll average that out to 3.

Small tip: the bathroom across from theCafe is a very decent place to head if you need to um, relieve yourself and find yourself far from your room. The bathroom walls and doors go all the way to the floor for extra privacy. The sinks are nice and there is a full length mirror in the ladies room. And it is CLEAN. We liked this bathroom so much we used it many times during our stay. When we saw The Lion King just steps from here I snuck over to that bathroom (and away from the crowds filtering into MB's casino).

So this time around, I opted for saving as much as possible and pocketing the extra cash; so I did my research online and found restaurant.com gift certificates to use in Vegas.  And this happened to be one of the restaurants featured. 

Time: My bf and I visited this place the very first day we landed in Sin City and to our disappointment, it was closed.  They are only open for breakfast and lunch, I believe.   We were needless to say, a little disappointed and hoped that we would be able to use it. So we opted for the next restaurant.com location, Raffles Café just a few walking minutes away. 

Food: So we finally got to try this place on our last day there. Let me say, it was WELL WORTH THE WAIT!  I ordered the steak and eggs.  It came with a nice size steak, three eggs, hash browns, and 2 slices of toast.   It was an ample amount of food and cure to my hangover morning!  My bf ordered a lamb ""Philly-steak"" sandwich on French roll.  It came with fries that were lightly seasoned with something and it was heavenly!  I kept finding myself reaching over to steal them every once in a while. 

This place is a must, must, must visit (with the restaurant.com gift certificate, of course .. unless you win big and don't mind the splurge!) Our originally $45 brunch, came out to about $22!

The service left something to be desired. Staying at Mandalay Bay each time I visit, I decided to branch out to The Hotel at Mandalay Bay's The Cafe to see if there's a difference.

I thought the greeting upon my arrival could've been more cordial. My companion and my seating arrangements could've been more appropriate (instead of sitting us at the comfortable 2-seater table within the server's area where the breakfast crowd was building , we were placed immediately adjacent to a business breakfast table of 4 in a near-empty restaurant. 

I'm not used to having a thermos of coffee left at my table for me to pour in a place like The Cafe... that was something more relative to IHOP or an Aunt Emma's eatery.

I found myself requesting sugar and milk. The couple of buzzing flies (that came and went because of our table's proximity to the public walkspace) were not a pleasantry.

I understand, it's not Aureole or restaurant of that caliber, but it's at The HOTEL at Mandalay Bay. My expectations for service were higher.

The highlight is, of course, the food. Not one reservation regarding such. The chef deserves kudos.

She ordered a grilled salmon salad and I had a club sandwich.  The club sandwich was pretty good and the fries were actually very good.  The grilled salmon had too much dressing and was a bit disappointing.  When we ordered, we were asked how she wanted the salmon done.  I have never heard this before for a salad, but he suggested medium rare so we went with that.  Well, it looked pretty well done when we got it.  Not dry or tough or anything, but when you order a medium rare steak, you expect pink in the center.

Overall I think it was better than Bellagio Cafe, but the wait is super long here since this is the only place to eat.  At 11am we waited nearly 30 minutes.  The seats are plush and comfortable which makes for good conversation but not necessarily good for eating as you want to sink into the chair.

I went to THEcafe with my mom and brother for breakfast, and we had to greet the hosts (it should be the other way around) and ask to be seated. I don't know if it's the atmosphere at THEhotel, where we stayed, that made this place kind of TOO quiet for my taste. 

The service was adequate, but the food was tasty. My mom ordered an omelette, my brother the steak and eggs, and I got the chicken and waffles. One cool thing about this place is that you can order off the whole menu during breakfast time.

My brother's steak and eggs looked really good. Three eggs cooked to order, a nice-sized steak, hash browns, and some toast. I'll get that the next time I'm eating there, if I eat there next time. 

My mom liked her omelette, though they should let you pick more than 3 ingredients. It did come with toast and hash browns. 

My chicken and waffles were good. I got 2 waffles and one piece of boneless fried chicken. My waffles were pre-syruped.

3746327,2009-07-06,6,G58YATMKnn-M-RUDWg3lxw,"Our server was a horrible, lying bitch, to put it nicely.

She didn't greet us at all; the first thing she said was, ""What do you wanna drink?"" with a bit of an attitude. We saw other tables with baskets of bread, so we asked her if we could also get a basket. Sh straight up told us bread was for the people who ordered from the lunch menu (not us). For some reason, she still brought out a measly basket of bread for us and said that was all that was left -- even though all the other tables had big ass baskets full of all kinds of different bread.

When she took our orders, she didn't ask my father how well he wanted his steak, which we didn't realize until his steak came and it was all bloody on the inside. Maybe that's how it's supposed to be prepared, but she could've at least warned my father. I ordered a Strawberry, Raspberry, and Blueberry waffle which was actually really tasty. That was the best part of the meal.

Then, she took 20 minutes getting our bill and finishing the transaction. We didn't even know what the hell she was doing. She kept circling the restaurant, going in and out of the kitchen, looking around, going back into the kitchen, and coming out with nothing. It was really unfortunate we were stuck with her cos the other server who was taking care of tables nearby us seemed so attentive, and she just failed upon comparison.

And it wasn't just us who thought the service was terrible. The table right next to us were also served by this lazy ass waitress. Apparently, one of the ladies wanted white bread and the server gave her Sourdough. The lady told her it was Sourdough and instead of just apologizing and bringing her white bread, the waitress argued with her and insisted it wasn't Sourdough.  All the lady said was, ""Uh, this is Sourdough. Trust me, I ate it,"" which did the trick. They ended up not finishing the majority of their food and left a $2 tip (for a party of 4), which was hilarious cos you know how expensive food is in Vegas. They didn't follow the ""15% tip rule,"" and neither did we.

I wish I remembered the server's name, so you can all avoid her. She seemed to be Hispanic, middle-aged, short, kind of on the large side, with curly brown hair.  I'm sure a lot of people have had great experiences here considering all the positive reviews before mine; they just really need to get rid of her. Never again!

We had two meals here. The first was a late breakfast, early lunch. I had the steak and eggs and my girlfriend had the bento box. She said the bento box was good and looked similar to those she has had at other establishments. 
The steak and eggs, on the other hand, was a bit disappointing. On the bright side, they allow you to substitute the hash browns for their truffle oil coated fries (these were good). The eggs were cold when I received them but they did quickly replace them with warm eggs after I asked. The steak was a bit thin for me, about 1/2 an inch and had more fat to trim than I expected. Although cooked correctly, it lacked flavor. 
Our second meal was breakfast. My girlfriend had the chicken and waffles. As you'll see from the pictures posted on here, it comes with bacon which was a nice touch (and tasted very good). The chicken was fried properly and had a nice flavor. It comes on top of 4 small waffles, plenty for her for breakfast. 
I had the blue crab benedict - I would HIGHLY recommend this. I posted a picture and hopefully you will be able to see the amount of crab served in this dish. Not only was there a great amount of crab, the flavor was excellent. It's served in a bowl rather than a plate as they provide plenty of sauce used to devour your crab.
I may have mentioned this before, it's not an inexpensive place to eat, $24 for the crab benedict and $17 for the chicken and waffles, $4 for a soda, $4+ for coffee. We had a hotel credit to use so it worked out perfectly for us. 
If you're staying at The Hotel, it's a convenient place to eat. Service is pretty good, the atmosphere is a bit like a club (pretty dark but not near as noisy, black napkins, dark décor, high prices!). But, they do have mini spot lights over the table which allows you to see the menu as well as your food. They are quick to prepare the order (which was one reason the cold eggs were so surprising). Also nice because it is away from the noises of the casino, but it is right off the hallway from the hotel over to the casino (so there is a bit of foot traffic if you sit by it).

This was Mother's Day May 2013. 

We got there and the host stand was empty. We stood there for roughly 5 minutes before someone came back. They were ""all"" apparently working on setting up tables for a group of 9. Once that impatient group was sat our names were taken and then we were quickly seated. There is no seating for those who are waiting to be seated, so if the line gets long you will be in the walk way.

Drink orders were taken. While we were placing my order I asked if the chicken sausage had a pork casing and the waitress told me, "" No! It's all chicken!"" I asked her to confirm before I placed my order as I know most chicken sausages have pork casings unless they are the organic, gluten free kind. She came back and confirmed that I was correct it does have a pork casing. 

I ordered the White Chocolate Macadamia Raspberry French Toast with the Caramelized Onion Hash browns,  and Grapefruit Juice to drink.

Grapefruit juice was good. They seem to have watered it down so that it doesn't have the strong, overpowering taste. If you like grapefruit juice you'll like this one for sure.

The French toast was good. The raspberry were nothing more than four of them around the plate and one in the center.  Other than that they were big fluffy pieces of toasts and the flavor was very good. You will enjoy them for sure. 

The hash browns were no different here than any other place you can order them. I didn't even notice or taste the onions in them. 

Our glasses set empty for a bit but we were so full from the meal that it was quite OK.  I was very pleased with the experience and will go back again for sure if I stay at The Hotel.

Side note: Stop reading if your idea of breakfast in Vegas is 15 strips of bacon, a couple scoops of greasy fried country potatoes, and heaping of eggs scrambled in butter and heavy cream finished with a glass of OJ (for that serving of fruit).  Nothing wrong with that, just remember the city's slogan as you're frantically searching for that special room a few hours later.

The ambiance is contemporary.  Even the suit clad or dot com urban cowboy totes iPads and iPhones instead of printed WSJ or Financial Times.  Service warm and unobtrusive.  The food; the best breakfast on the Strip.

The custard pancakes with vanilla butter and macerated blueberries is outstanding.  Warm, fluffy, and extremely moist.  The pronounced vanilla works so well against the tart berries.  The simple waffle with a warm, fresh fruit compote and the to die for maple mascarpone stays crisp to the very last bite.  Finally the white chocolate raspberry brioche French toast topped with macadamia nuts and frangelico syrup; perfect.  Rich, not too sweet, eggy goodness.

Heavier eaters should opt for the incredible in house cured salmon with its melt in your mouth goodness or the smoked pork benedicts.  Pork with eggs and butter is the breakfast of champions right?

Portions are very large.  Even the sides are huge.  The bone in ham easily 6oz.  The three strips of extremely thick cut, crispy broiled bacon 4oz.

Around $20 per person, a real bargain for the quality and quantity.",oeAhRa8yFa9jtrhaHnOyxQ,12,8,4,nqtbHHl0YUjtKqrCLssQUQ
5134318,2010-07-30,1,G58YATMKnn-M-RUDWg3lxw,I stopped here since it looked quiet & comfortable even though the prices were a bit high.  I thought it would be a good choice since it was located near THEhotel.   I don't mind paying the money for good food but I would have to agree with another review comparing The Cafe to a Dennys.  The sandwich that I had actually had processed turkey & not real turkey breast.  For these prices I was expecting more.   I was actually starving when I left.,Is4FRAQ10XsmOxrQlyighA,0,0,2,Phv7CkvzNyrJP4Fgk2RmlQ

The bacon, tomato and Brie cheese sandwich was awesome.  The tomato soup was a bit on the sour side, but still went well with the sandwich.  The pancakes were fluffy and the warm syrup added a nice touch.  

I kinda like fries.  And what surprised me here were their TRUFFLE FRIES.  They rate up there with some of the best I've had.  Thin, crunchy on the outside, perfectly flavored, and plentiful....I would come back just for them.",KOWl_ZhqhYqY33-CbaJubw,5,4,4,8UGjVmL014p7c5lWlP_ikg

This was on a Sunday morning btw. When the food came out we had to flag the waitress down because we still didn't have any napkins or silverware. My ""over medium"" eggs were basically hard boiled. Corned beef was good. Toast was GREAT but when my friend asked for jelly that took another 15 mins. They charge you for coffee here which I wasn't used to... every other place gave it complimentary. All in all a bad experience and not going back. A shame because I'm a big fan of THEhotel.",UEPG6AafC_CWDLCDEfLy2A,1,0,1,skr8ICP3TZ0OyO2fHLCvnQ

I had the eggs w/the hash and the hash had carrots in it which I found very odd... the worst part was they weren't fully cooked so they were very al dente which didn't go well with the beef and potatoes in the hash. Also, I asked for no bread and yet they brought me bread. Service was okay. My friend seemed to enjoy her breakfast -- simple eggs w/bacon and toast so perhaps I need to just stick with the simple dishes next time... if there is a next time.

5441032,2011-05-08,0,G58YATMKnn-M-RUDWg3lxw,"Beautiful morning, last day in Vegas, woke up feeling like having another great breakfast before going back home. Walk up to a restaurant with a smile on our faces, positive attitude in anticipation of enjoying our breakfast at The Cafe... 1 hour later, we are leaving in disappointment. 

Why? Well a couple of things...

a.  I understand mistakes happen and dirty silverware can land on someone's table... but, please, don't have an attitude towards your customer. At least say I am sorry and run to get a fork from the kitchen and not from the table behind me... This is basic customer service!

b. When a customer asks a question about their coffee, instead of asking ""isn't that what you have ordered?"" just be curious and see if there is anything wrong with it! 

c. When a customer orders a steak, one thinks of a cut full of meat and not just fat! 75% of the steak that was served with breakfast was left on the plate. There was practically no meat in it.

d. Crab Egg Benedict? Hmmm, I see an egg but what about the crab??? Ok, ok, one flake of the crab will count...

So many things in one hour....and  only one question I was leaving with: why on our last day we had to go through such bad experience...

Regardless, I'm not sure if the food warrants such high prices.  I had a burger that was $18 that wasn't extraordinary, but it came with truffle fries that they serve with every sandwich.  My husband had the baked apple pancake that was a huge plate sized apple fritter that he was overwhelmed by.  I thought it was good when I tasted it, but I don't really eat sugary things like that (I love meat and potatoes more).  He thought it didn't have enough apples baked in the dough.

I decided to go for the tried and true, chicken and waffles, because I like to have both a sweet and salty element to my meals. The chicken was cooked so perfectly. Even though it was just chicken breast, it was still so moist and juicy. The crust was crunchy and not oily at all. The waffles  were crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside, exactly what waffles should be. I thought the dish was very well done. The only thing is that they bring it to you with the maple syrup already poured over it, which I would have preferred to do myself but it was no big deal.

The blue crab Benedict was horrible. My girlfriend ordered the lobster panini with fruit. She got a panini that literally ha the cheese harden from being outside too long, and instead of the fruit they served her fries.

Since I get about as much enjoyment out of a bowl of 15 cent oatmeal as I do out of most breakfast joints, it's usually a wasted experience. However, on the recommendation of friends who claimed they got life altering chilequiles from here, I had to go. Unfortunately...they did not have chilequiles on the menu any more. They have a good sounding menu, but I cheaped out a little on breakfast and ordered something non-fancy, as I'm planning to waste plenty of money on dinners while I'm in Vegas. 

I ended up having the Portuguese sausage hash with eggs and hash browns, and it was fine...The most exciting thing I can say it that the sausage was nice and lean, and the serving was enormous. The hash browns had some peppers in them too, which was nice, and it came with a nice piece of grilled sourdough toast. But all in all, this was unremarkable. I think it was also expensive (especially my $4 diet coke) but I will chalk that up to my Vegas naivete, and assume all things are this expensive.",tPufvUuxXLJOMYQ7gzsMVA,2,0,3,qRJNamqC-KDy2sS6qyFbTA

These were probably the best eggs that I've ever had, and I don't even like eggs that much!  They give you about 5 or 6 different choices for a meat, and the Portuguese sausage is an excellent choice.  I'm a little iffy on the potatoes, tho - not quite as crisp or tasty as I would like, but it's still an awesome breakfast.  Your bread comes with jam served in tiny jars, since the Smuckers plastic container with the peel-back lid isn't fancy enough for The Cafe.  It's impossible to wrong with the 2 egg breakfast, but the smoked salmon platter also sounded amazing.
