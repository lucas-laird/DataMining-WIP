The ""man candy"" candied bacon is so sweet and savory and delicious!
Didn't try much of the other food.
I wish the bacon I had on the side of my plate was nice and thick cut rather than the thin flavor lacking bacon used. Chicken finger do not disappoint! Full thinly sliced sided breasts.",1K4PaGkPgAMrIA5SpcFUpQ,2,0,4,Z_tQ4lihLsYmG2VbYa8xxQ

I'm here to tell you that the Bacon Bar and the employees here are great and truly care about their guests. There was a post about the music being awful for that individual and their family member/s. I didn't have an issue with the music as its current, upbeat and what's on the top of the charts. I would highly recommend the Bacon Burger as it was a delicious and the presentation was done great too. There truly is a cook in the Kitchen that cares about what is being sent out and it shows!

There's a HUGE sign that says to show  ID to the camera and you will be buzzed in.  We pulled out our ID's, the door clicked, and in we go.  The bar flies were screaming across the bar how dumb we must be to not know how to work a door.  After a few minutes, the bartender comes over.  I tell her that she should settle down the crowd, all we were doing was following the instructions.  She says not to worry, those are her friends and they are wasted.  Lovely.  We are about 2 sips in when a girl comes over and asks if we are stupid.  Unbelievable.  The bartender was talking to us when HER FRIEND insulted us.  Everyone but us thought it was hilarious.  We asked for our check, paid and left.  That bar is down the street from my house and now I will never be back.

For being called Bacon Bar, they don't have much bacon on the menu.  There is a special side menu with bacon delights.  It's only like 6 items.  Total disappointment.",i87ym8fz2CXB-85Q9SIlmQ,9,0,1,CuVWPenIRfe7MJjsqTiHoA

Bacon?  Not enough pork in the world could get me back in there...jk!

We had lunch and a beer at 2:00pm on a Friday.
We were one of only two couples in the restaurant area and still there were tables with dirty glasses and plates from the time we sat down until we left.

This is a huge bar - LOTS of tables.

The service was very good...we ordered a sandwich to share & without being asked they did split onto separate plates (very nice) - also did not charge a ""sharing"" fee like some places.

We had the meatball sandwich - very good and the fries actually ARE worth stopping in for....
Also, I tried their ranch dressing - let me tell you, the BEST ranch dressing ever!  They make their own!  A must try.

The menu WOW!!!  Although, they recently changed from Kerry's to the Bacon Bar and had new menus - they have already (hand written) prices higher than printed (tacky).  The prices are a bit much for bar food.

There is a huge lack of any atmosphere...

We asked about Sunday football & our server told us to come early as they best seats/tables are taken early - then she showed us seats that the bar actually charges $25 for you to sit at....blowing my mind!!!
Charging for seats...what's next?  - Plates and glass usage fees? 

Also, some of the flyers on the tables still have Kerry's on them and others have Bacon Bar - I wasn't sure where I was....

Anyway, this bar is an easy 6 out of 10.  Prices are too high & no atmosphere.

We watch the show Bar Rescue and decided that while on vacation, we were going to check this place out because.. who ""doesnt love bacon"" !!   When we pulled into the parking lot, we were a little surprised that for a saturday night, this place was not that crowded.  Then again, that was fine with us as we were just anxious to see the place after the remodel.

We were greeted by a very friendly female waitress - Hannah.  She was very friendly and seated us in the dining area near the bar.  She quickly took our drink order and returned with them in a matter of minutes.  

While taking our order, we asked for her opinion on a few items we wanted to try.  She was very down to earth about what to try after asking us what we liked to eat.  We ordered an appetizer of the garlic knots and they were very tasty.

When our food arrived it was displayed pretty cool looking.  My burger had a piece of bacon spiraled on top with a tooth pick holding it in place.  My husband had a beef sandwich that was covered in cheese.   Both our meals were good, however the only item we did not care too much for are the french fries.  They are almost exactly like the new burger king fries, which I am NOT a fan of at all.  No flavor to them really.  We did have our option of regular fries, sweet potato fries or loaded waffle fries, so I am guessing we should have opted for something different.  

Either way - the bar was very clean and in order.  The womens bathroom was also very clean!   

I only saw one person from the show behind the bar, Justin.  we were going to say hello but felt wierd.. lol.

Size: Huge seating area. Huge pizza kitchen and you can see the cooks working away.

Service:  Since I always eat at the bar, service has been completely amazing. If you order a salad or something that can be quick, it will be quick. Never more than 5 minutes. If you are a pain in the rear and want more of this and less of that, they always say no problem at all and modify your order happily. The bartender places the order and a friendly waitress shoots out and delivers it.  

Food:  Absolutely top shelf. The focus is Italian. Spag and meat balls is the best ever. They say they marinate the meat balls in marinara 24 hours bla, bla, bla.... and this meal is hard to make really full of pep, but it really is a zesty dish. The bread hot and fresh baked long roll with hard crust and perfectly soft center.....etc....

I get the Sicilian crust pizza regularly too. The spicy Hawaiian is good. All of the pizzas are good.

I get the chef salad pretty regularly too. It is excellent. The spinach salad is also great, So is the antipasto.

Also had a stromboli once and it was so fresh and crunchy and soft on the inside.

You look at the place and it screams ""Dive bar with horrible food"", but that is not what I am rating. It is once you enter. The bartender always manages an audible hello and also a friendly bye and a wave. Family owned and operated. Great personalities with everyone I have met. You can joke and flirt with everyone and it is reciprocated. And genuinely great people.

For starters, the bacon jalapeños were one of the worst things I've ever eaten. No texture whatsoever. Mushy, overcooked jalapeños with soggy, limp bacon. And they added maple syrup to them as well, which wasn't listed on the menu.

We got THE bacon burger, and while it wasn't that bad, it still wasn't what we ordered. It's supposed to have bacon ground with the beef. Instead there was only bacon on top, and it was dry and overcooked. The burger also came with tomato confit on it which also wasn't listed in the menu description. So both things we ordered came with additional ingredients that weren't on the menu. 

Our server was really somethin too. There was nobody in the restaurant and while we were waiting for our food, she sat at the bar and ate her dinner while she was on her phone.

1230630,2015-07-09,3,59YbAeuiz0isJtRNKATTKw,"SOO excited of hearing about this place.....Not coming back!

Bacon, bacon, bacon..... Who doesn't love bacon?  That's what I immediately thought when I heard about this place. A couple of my friends and I were originally supposed to go to dinner at Hot N' Juicy Crawfish on Eastern. It is a location we have been to, we really enjoyed the food and the service there.  Then roughly 4 hours before we were going to go to Hot N' Juicy we decided to join some of our other friends and try out the Bacon Bar. I got pretty excited to go to a restaurant dedicated to bacon.

We drove up to the restaurant and immediately noticed how old and dated the outer exterior looked like. We all didn't think much of it because most of our favorite bars to go to are what you consider a, ""Hole in the wall,"" or a, ""Dive."" Then my 2 friends and I walked in and we all thought the inside looked pretty cool, that it had a pretty cool vibe. We walked up to the host stand and within only 5 seconds of standing there a waitress immediately greets us from afar as she makes her way to us to seat us for a table of 8. She seemed very friendly.  After we sat down the rest of our table of 8 showed up and she took our drink order.  Drinks did take a little long. We did realize she was the only waitress working and there was also a bartender as well. After 10-15 minutes we got our drinks. I ordered the drink called the Bourbon Boar. The main reason why I picked the drink was because it had bacon in it. I had to get it, right? The Bourbon boar was very good. It tasted like a variation of a Bloody Mary. I am not a big fan of Bloody Mary's but I really did enjoy it.  

Then our waitress took our food order. Right after she hurried away. She was getting pretty busy as tables were trickling in, and still she was by herself being the only waitress on the floor. With my table we were in no rush at all, we 100% understood she was in the weeds with all of the tables she had. There wasn't any manager, buser, or host for her to ask help from.  Just like the drinks the food took an extremely long time to come out. We waited 20-25 minutes or longer for our 3 orders of garlic knots to arrive. My whole table did enjoy the garlic knots and the large portions they served. When it came to our entrees it probably took around 30-40 minutes for everything to finally arrive. I ordered a sandwich called the Cure. It was a sandwich with maple glazed beer braised bacon, fried egg and a tomato jam on it. Oh my!! It was too much!! I thought I was going to get slices of bacon, but noooo. I got this huge 8-10 ounce slab of bacon. The thing is the slab of bacon was 70-80% fat. I do like the fat on steak and pork but the fat of the bacon on the sandwich that I ordered was out of control. I did enjoy their fries. They almost had the taste of the curly fries from Arby's but better. The waitress did also mess up a couple of the orders at my table. She had to have one burger remade and for my friend's burger she forgot to hold the onions, instead there was an abundance of raw and sautéed onions on it. He scrapped all of the onions off as best as he could. She was very apologetic for everything that was going on and fixed all of the mistakes very quickly. 

Then all of a sudden something happened that got me thinking, ""What the hell is going on?!"" As our waitress was delivering our checks to our table this guy shoves/bumps into our waitress on purpose, spilling a glass of water on her. We knew it was on purpose because half way through shoving her he said, ""Sorry bitch!!"" He then walks away pretty quickly. We immediately saw if our waitress was ok. She said she was and then accused the bartender for instigating it all out loud in front of all of the tables. The waitress and the bartender then exchanged words for a minute. Most of us were thinking our waitress was right. The guy that shoved and spilled the drink on her was at the bar the whole time we were there and walked out of his way to pass through to get to our waitress. Who knows, maybe the bartender had beef with our waitress so she had the dude spill the drink on her.

With most businesses that involves customer service most of the time you schedule your staff based the numbers, trends, and the traffic. Yes we did visit the Bacon Bar on a slow Tuesday night where staffing might be a little light, but, DANG!!! Our waitress needed soooooo much help. I even counted how many tables she had and how many people; within 2+ hours she helped out at least 7 tables, a party of 5,3,3,8,4,5, and 6. The bartender maybe helped 5 people total.  A lot of places I have been to the bartenders help out tables when needed.  We really felt for our waitress, to work at a place where you have nowhere to go to for help, not good. 

Sorry for such a long review. I had to let this out. I have never had an experience like this before at any restaurant or bar.",dSRV4T1WFUP6lFC-BHHQdA,8,2,1,5AhSX4NiU-qrluymlteAJQ

They have 4 drinks with a bacon garnish and 4 bacon appetizer/entrees.  The ""Bacon"" Drinks on the menu didn't wow me enough to order one.  

Such a shame ""Bar Rescue"" tried helping this place out! We ordered the man candy bacon strips that are almost candied with a nice little hint of heat, served with Crown Royal dipping syrup.  Since we both were wanting bacon we ordered BLT's.  They couldn't get a order of man candy and two BLT's correct.  Sad.  I ordered my BLT with very little mayo and it was smeared on two inches thick (BLAH) and my friend ordered extra mayo on her's and she had barely any mayo.

This place was rebranded in an episode of ""Bar Rescue."" I hadn't been here in awhile, although I've visited in the past to watch football on their big-screen TVs. But despite the new name and the inclusion of some pork-related decor, it seemed like the old Kerry's. The tabletop cards even still said ""Kerry's"" on them, and their famous pizzas were still on the menu. Although most of the other diners around us were eating said pizzas, my husband and I decided to check out some of the bacon-related offerings. So the spouse ordered the bacon burger, and I had a club sandwich.

The bacon burger was 60% beef and 40% bacon, topped with caramelized onions, cheese, and more bacon. Nice bacon flavor, but surprisingly it needed a little more salt. My club sandwich was tasty as well. The top half of the sandwich mirrored the bottom, so there was a nice ratio of turkey, bacon, lettuce, and tomato in every bite. Both of our orders came with fries, which were fine as fries go, and they were served in a cute paper container.

We each had three draft beers, starting with a Rebel IPA and ending with a Rolling Rock, which was on special for $2 a pop. Sandwiched in between was a Batch 19 lager, a Coors product that was touted as being brewed in the ""pre-Prohibition style."" It was good, but I don't see how it relates to bacon; maybe I read the menu wrong, but I thought it was described as having some sort of bacon taste. Nope; just beer.

Nonetheless, we enjoyed our meal at Kerry's ... er, I mean the Bacon Bar. Our waitress, Trina, was great: friendly and attentive, but not overly intrusive. I was surprised that the restaurant had so few customers, but hopefully that was just a fluke. And hopefully the name change will bring in a few more customers, because no matter what's it's called, this neighborhood bar deserves its new lease on life.",55bAo20xQNIA2CfMKIDtPA,7,4,4,7Yw5-J1Kl96QE6TPs5sa0A

The appetizers, the seasoned fries were served with a very tasty sauce.  The fries were mostly over done and the waitress informed us that there was nothing special with the sauce it was just thousand island with hot sauce instead of ketchup. The bloody Mary's are ... interesting.  I ordered the vodka version and my companion ordered the gin.  Neither was amazing.  And the gin one, well a Bloody Mary with cucumbers and basil? The burgers and onion rings were good.  I would eat that again.  All of the bacon that was served, in everything as expected, was thick cut bacon, not even warm, dry, and had little to no flavor.  It's what I'd expect one of those dog treats to taste like.  The server was very chatty, usually nice but we were trying to catch up at dinner and, well, I just didn't need to hear about their nutritional supplements and how they cut soda from their diet and how difficult that was for them. The service was good despite overly chatty, the prices were a bit higher than the quality deserved for the drinks.  Overall it was mostly an ""ehhh"" experience.

We ordered some beers, and looked over the menu which had a tremendous amount of good sounding items.

We ordered our food, and when it eventually made it to our table it did not have one bit of wow factor.

1596471,2015-04-15,0,59YbAeuiz0isJtRNKATTKw,"Where do I begin. I tried to order the THE BACON BURGER 12.95 (60/40 BEEF TO BACON PATTY | CROISSANT BUN | HORSERADISH AND CHIVE CHEDDAR | CARAMELIZED ONIONS | ARUGULA) but ended up with parts of the THE CURE 13.95 (MAPLE GLAZED BEER BRAISED BACON | TOASTED BAGUETTE |FRIED EGG | TOMATO JAM) and to me they were not the good parts. I specifically wanted the bacon burger for the horseradish chive & the croissant bun. What I ended up with was a hamburger patty (no chopped up bacon cooked into the patty only a couple of slices across the top of the burger), some kind of white cheese (not cheddar), caramelized onions with tomato jam & arugula on a toasted baguette. I didn't get get the good part of the cure burger which would have been the egg. When I brought it to the waitresses attention she tried to tell me that I had the correct burger as in the (Bacon Burger). I explained to her that I didn't think I did because the Bacon Burger wasn't supposed to have tomato on it (because I thought about adding a slice when I ordered it but opted not because of the up charge). Again she told me I had the right burger even though she didn't like tomato I had the correct burger. I don't care if you do or don't like tomato you should know what your burgers look like & be able to tell if something is wrong like the entire thing. She said more than once about different items that she didn't like them (like sweet potato fries) so she couldn't help us decide. Sorry but the burger listed above is directly off of their menu. No where on there does it say tomato on the Bacon Burger. And non the less the tomato jam was this sweet tasting junk that is now giving me stomach cramps. Ugh! Opted to upgrade (for $1.50 more) for the garlic Parmesan fries which aren't worth it in my opinion. They were ok but there wasn't any fresh garlic grated or even tossed from a jar on the fries. It was like a garlic season. So if you want good garlic fries stick to Gordon Biersch (outstanding garlic fries).

1636801,2014-12-31,1,59YbAeuiz0isJtRNKATTKw,"'s hard to pass up a joint called ""Bacon Bar"" and am glad to have not pass it up on this occasion.

We stopped in for a late night bite and upon entering we were greeted warmly by the bartender and quickly found our way to a long row of stools facing opposite of the bar, which I found to be pleasant. 

The place itself has a lodge feel to it with plenty of seating and super clean.  They also offer a shuffle board among other games like the typical video poker machines, which caters to  a great mixed crowd. I also like that it was not smoky at all which made for a pleasant dining experience.

My hubs ordered their signature burger which tasted and looked amazing, and I tried their special Sloppy Joe which was also suggested by the server who says she normally does not care for them but really liked this one.  The Sloppy Joe was probably one of the best I have tried yet. It was a very big portion of ground beef, crispy bacon bits, and great tasting sauce.  It was not overly sweet and had a good amount of shredded cheese that melted slowly and made it on every bite I took.  It also came with your choice of fries-curly, garlic, or onion rings.  I chose the regular fries which were crispy and delicious and for $9 bucks this was not only a great deal but a tasty one.

The service was also very pleasant although I will say that when given the choice of the different types fries or sides, the waiter never explained that this would be an extra $1.50.  She makes it sound like you can just choose, and instead we found out when the bill came as my husband did order the garlic fries.  It is to be expected I guess, but still should have been disclosed by the server.

Overall a great find and will definitely return.",lT49-Xggq_VAB2E9dce0yA,2,4,4,rp3ibCk2PmlpSH508gsM3A

My wife and would come to the restaurant side 3 or 4 times a month. Always bring friends and stay for a couple hours. Last night I couldn't get out fast enough. My wife, daughter, and the waitress spent the hour trying to keep me from walking out.
The meal was so screwed up, I can only go item by item....
My favorite waitress (along with the majority of old staff) is gone. All new. 
The menu has been gutted. Gone are the garlic knots, bacon wrapped onion rings, bacon lasagne, 1lb BLT, etc.
We ordered the Man Candy (great flavor, smaller portion) the bacon wrapped jalapeños (small) and deviled eggs (4 egg halfs for $7 ?!!!!!).
My wife and daughter ordered burgers. Pretty and good, but they switched the patties! My wife's rare was on my daughter burger, daughters medrare on wife's.
I ordered the bacon mac & cheese. How the Hell do you screw up that?!!!! A boring bowl of nothing. Not enough bacon, not enough cheese, not enough flavor.
Now the drinks....
My favorate beer is gone (nitro vanilla Porter). Had a modified Snakebite (75% Guinness 25% Angry Orchard). Lousy bartender can't pour from a tap.
Wife and daughter normally order 2 drinks each, they couldn't finish 1. Wife ordered a vodka Collins extra lime (simple, right?) very weak. Daughter ordered a house special with multiple fruit juices, garnished pretty, but when she tryed to drink it, it was nothing but colored simple syrup and weak.

We played on the machines at the bar for a bit while we waited for our food. 30 min go by, and we see the waitress walk by with our plates. She drops them off to another couple. Then another 15 min. We were going to ask where our food was when we heard the conversation between the bartender and the waitress. He asked where our food was and she had a surprised look on her face saying she delivered it already. Turns out she ran it to the wrong people. We heard the whole convo, since they we're 5 feet away from us. We watched the bartender tell the chef to re-fire our food and then he returned and completely ignored us. He didn't apologize for the wait or the inconvenience, but he did a wonderful job at avoiding us. When the food finally came the waitress apologized. But she kept on apologizing. It became annoying. Every time she walked by us she would say ""I can't believe I did that, how stupid of me"". Still, not a word from the bartender. Then I decided I wanted to try a Bloody Mary, considering they have a few on their menu, and they all sounded delicious. So I order one. And what was the bartenders response, you say? He bent over the counter and rolled his eyes. Then he said to me while shaking his head, ""if you ever order a Bloody Mary after 7pm your bartender is going to hate you."" Then he and the waitress started laughing at me. I kept asking, ""why?"" And they only kept laughing. So I eventually just gave up and got a beer. As a person also in the service industry, I was livid. If I order something from you that's on your menu you will make it. If I am going to pay for it, you will make it. And if you don't have to supplies to make it, TELL ME. Don't laugh at me and basically humiliate me. Just no.

Bartenders ignored us.  We then proceeded to play a pool game, and patiently waited for someone to take our drink order.  No one helped us out during the 20 minutes we played pool.

Prior to us leaving, two girls sat at the bar and were immediately served by the bartenders who had previously  ignores us.  Completely unprofessional and unacceptable!

I had the one with tequila and it was so refreshing I could get addicted to it for breakfasts.  The service was great, very attentive and helpful.  It was a little smokey at the high top bar, because it was close to the gaming bar, so if that's an issue I'd recommend sitting at the table instead.  The biggest disappointment was the food.  A placed named Bacon Bar should have had more flavor in their food.  My husband had the Bacon Breakfast Burrito, and even after dosing it with salt, pepper, and the ketchup-like salsa it still had no flavor.  He left half of it on his plate which is huge for my husband.  I had the italian omelet.  The italian sausage had more flavor, because it's italian sausage, but the egg was dry and the single slice of cheese did nothing the help.

2318513,2015-11-28,3,59YbAeuiz0isJtRNKATTKw,"Not bad but not exactly what I was hoping. 

I dropped in at around 4 on a Friday. Maybe 30% capacity. The bar had most of that. I entered with no greeting. I walked around and found my own menu in a pile randomly in the middle of the restaurant. After looking at the menu and deciding what I wanted, I returned back to the bar to try to find someone to at least seat me. The bartender was helpful but I could tell that she was annoyed and I'm pretty sure it's because the server is always doing this. Just a guess. But after almost 20 years in the industry, it's easy to see. So, on to the food...

Obviously everyone is thinking the bacon is important in a place called ""Bacon Bar."" It isn't. I ordered the vodka bloody Mary and the first thing I tried was the stick of bacon wedged into the glass. Being a chef, I know this common mistake cooks make. They deep fry the bacon or cook it too much in the oven but I'm guessing deep fry because I know the taste and texture. Great for high volume but it really isn't necessary because the volume is not the high. The flavor is gone. Disappointed level 4. As for the taste of the drink itself, well, the olives were wilted, the celery was weak and the mix is probably store bought and not homemade like most premium bloody Mary makers do. Disappointed level raised to 5. The server finally took my order and I got a bacon burger. When it came, she asked if I wante mayo but corrected herself and said there's mayo already on it but there wasn't. Next common cook problem I noticed was the burger had lots of pieces of burnt food on it telling me they don't brush the grill like they are supposed to leaving all those pieces of burnt stuff on everything that goes on the grill and therefore killing more possible flavor. Disappointment level rising to 8. Next was the fries. I upgraded to garlic fries. I could tell that they were either double fried or the fryer temp was too high because of the texture. 3 major mistakes the cooks are making...fryer temp. Improper bacon cooking. Not cleaning the grill. Along with the shifty service, I don't think I'll be back until they get back on track. For $25, I could have gotten 5 great burgers from a fast food place.

Update : so, I got someone's attention and it doesn't sound like a fellow customer. It sounds like someone that works there. Check it out...because, he totally called me out with all of his stellar reasons...haha. Yup..this place should be closing soon.",FgyvflZtqRF03j5bIrlnlA,15,1,1,cQ6__EgUvr-qAx8OgYjxHg

Talk about complete change over all in due part Bar Rescue. The whole sports theme is gone Hello BACON!!! Just totally different vibe then before lot nicer place too come hang out with friends. It still this nice open feeling with the high ceilings, the back of the bar with the Bacon Bar logo big fan of not just name brand here but everywhere you look around Bacon reign supreme, and back pool area feel like added section too the restaurant (same spot seeing the self serving beer machines; new felt on pool table; bar stools around). All around feel more welcoming bar then before and lot more lighting so feel light walking into more classy bar rather then dark dive bar. It nice size bar always place that sit at the bar, pool area, or sit in the dining area. Bar that not have too scream talk stories with your friends.

The food talk about Baconlicous!!! Before loved the pizza ones that they still have on the menu! This night was all about the Bacon and trying new menu items. Between my roommate and I we just about had all of the new items. They have four or five Bacon drinks and then below that four or five food items. The ""Man Candy"". If you could go too Bacon Heaven on earth this is the way too go. Or if looking too go into diabetic coma another way too go. Lol. The combination between perfect crispy bacon not only that but tell nice slice from fresh slab not pre cut ones, and marinade in something on top of little kick too it or spice they add. The sugar coating on the outside and if that not enough sugar dip it in maple syrup. It all the best things about breakfast in mason jar. Yay!  I ordered thet Bacon Burger. I really enjoyed. The 60/40 of beef made the perfect blend juicy cooked too my order on point. The buns were great and loved the personnel touch with branded B on the top bun. Fries in brown paper bag. Loved that concept different plus it was good fries. Roommate ordered not remember but had the fried egg on top of looked short rib. The fact that they keep the fried egg running where as every other restaurant in Vegas scared for health reasons make it yolks running. Deserves Star all on its oWn. I never tasted it but roommate told me awesome.

The service talk about Justin getting bad rap or the truth reality shows is whatever they make of it. On the show they make him out too be bad guy.

2356923,2014-03-21,2,59YbAeuiz0isJtRNKATTKw,"Well above average for Bar Food!

I saw this place on Bar Rescue and went in out of curiosity.  I am now a regular customer.  The owners are always in and around and the quality is excellent.

Let's talk about the food.  First of all..  yes..  they have some GREAT bacon.  You will notice the bacon theme in the food I have eaten.  MAN CANDY is bacon rock candy with maple whiskey and a little bit of spice.  This might be the best treat I have ever tasted...  better than chocolate!  You get 4-5 pieces in a serving (I eat them so fast it is hard to remember) and that is all any one person should ever eat.  The POTATO SKINS are simple and delicious.  Potatoes split in half with cheddar, chives and plenty  PLENTY of crumbled real bacon.  They serve this with sour cream and is a meal all on its own.  The BACON BURGER is a 60/40 blend of beef and pork with a spicy cheese and sauce on a special bun.  Truly delicious.. and you will want to try this BEFORE you go adding ketchup.  It is very juicy and delicious.  It comes with a side of fires which are just average.  The BACON & EGGS breakfast is delicious.  Eggs are regular and served any style you like.  You have a choice of regular boring hash browns or above average cottage fries.  The cottage fries are really potato slices..  or wedges.  They are WAY better than their french fries and go well with breakfast.  You also get a toast choice and 4 slices of big delicious bacon.  The food I have had is quite delicious.  There are a lot of typical poker bar options on the menu and I can't say how good. bad, or average they are.  I stick to the theme .. BACON.

The ambience of the place is kind of blah.   Its big and open and still a little dated.  Some of the touches from the Bar Rescue show are nice like the self serve beer wall and the bacon signage.  But overall this still feels like a big and open space.  When the place fills with people it gets VERY loud, no doubt a function of the large rooms acoustics.  And while the place is clean I don't get a feeling of great cleanliness.  

Overall I really like this place for what it is... a Vegas Poker Bar.  If you are looking for fine dining..  this place will disappoint.  If you want to eat some bacon and drop a bill in the poker machine.. this place will suit you just fine.",qBVFHqJlMn50amD-67wTjQ,3,3,4,IcC-9A6dQA-39W_e2iW5QQ

My girlfriend and I talked all day about trying out the bloody mary's at the bacon bar after a full day of shopping on Saturday 11/9/13.
We got there - sat at the bar - received menus and then nothing...
We waited probably close to 10 minutes and the server never came back.  She was busy talking on the phone over by the kitchen...  We saw her get off the phone, but still hadn't made it back to us, so we left.
We walked ALL THE WAY through the restaurant to get to the door, not a single person said thank you, and she didn't try and stop us either, even though we walked right by her!

So - we ended up going up the street to Viola's.  Great service, Amazing Food, Awesome happy hour specials.  Will definitely make Viola's a regular place to go!!!",iU180JImxkSNE7PearcX9w,6,0,1,fd4_Ato5lBfHP-1VJMSugQ
2426126,2015-05-23,0,59YbAeuiz0isJtRNKATTKw,"Went here today with my wife for the first time. We had seen it on Spike Tvs show Bar Rescue. 

The restaurant itself looked not so welcoming. It was kinda dark. We were kind of confused when we walked in because we didn't know if we could seat ourselves or if we had to wait to be seated. My wife also had to have the waitress show her where the restroom was. Why isn't there a sign that states where the restrooms are?


I ordered the Patty Melt. The bread tasted like it was stale. I ordered my sandwich Medium Well, it was cooked Well Done. The meat was dry. All that came on it was sautéed onions and Swiss cheese. This was a very mediocre sandwich that I could have made at home. It didn't even come with any condiments. 

My wife ordered their Teriyaki Burger. She ordered her burger Medium Well also. Her burger was cooked Well Done and dry. (She had to use ketchup for her burger) Her burger came with Swiss cheese, bacon, grilled onions, mushrooms, and teriyaki sauce. It also came with tomato, lettuce and raw onions. Why would they put raw onions on a burger that already has grilled onions on it?

I ordered a bottle of beer for happy hour and my ordered the Mary's Garden (Bloody Mary). She said that it was the best Bloody Mary she has had since she has lived in Vegas. Another plus for the Bar/restaurant was their ranch. The ranch had a nice garlic taste as well as the texture was thin. 

The waitress was also very nice. She kept our water filled and checked on us, but not in the constantly annoying way. 

We also saw one of the cooks in the back eating food while on the line, making someone's plate. How gross and unprofessional is that? 

Our advice would be to make sure the cooks in the back know the difference between Medium Well and Well Done for their burgers. Also put a sign indicating where the restrooms are located. Also please put a sign that lets the customer(s) know if they can seat themselves or wait to be seated.",lEysk8KSYQxU6DKAARA52g,1,0,2,gq9aBbsIa67u3cfZXl_cCg

2659274,2015-08-23,3,59YbAeuiz0isJtRNKATTKw,"The wife and I were looking for some new bars around town and we came upon Bacon Bar while cruising Google and Yelp. Apparently it had appeared on a television show called Bar Rescue, but we had never seen the show or heard of it, so it did not influence our decision to check it out.

We first visited about a year ago and had expected the Bacon themed gimmick to be cute, but probably not a huge draw. Once we arrived and went inside, we were pleasantly surprised at how comfortable and spread out the place is. Significantly larger than a typical local's dive bar, the place is quite huge. The bar is a good size, running along the entire middle of the bar. There is a large seating area for the restaurant (too large, really) and there is one pool table along the east side. All throughout the restaurant are various Bacon related advertising and comic style wall adornments. The menu is expansive, and is available 24 hours a day. We STRONGLY recommend the garlic fries. They are literally the best we have ever had.

The service is very personable and friendly all around. Various bartenders run the the place, including the son of the owner. We usually go late at night when there is only one bartender and one or two people working the kitchen, but that doesn't mean service is slow. Service is always quick, friendly, down to earth, and with as smile.

We usually go there hoping that their one pool table is open and fortunately for us, it usually is. Games are $0.75 each and there is a change machine and a good variety of sticks to choose from. However, and this is my one complaint, there is only ONE pool table. My strongest recommendation would be for the bar to invest in increasing their pool table numbers by at least one or two, and perhaps cutting down their dining room area a bit to expand their pool table area. This would certainly be a draw and I could see them coming closer to competing with other nice pool bars such as PT's on Spring Mountain and Arville and RumRunner on Tropicana. Both of those venues offer a similar setting, but significantly more pool tables which leads to more customers and more drink/food orders.

Having said that, we usually find oursevles not waiting long to get the table and enjoy playing one or two games with some garlic fries, huge beers served from tap and a significant value. Their prices are extremely low and attractive for the local budget minded consumer. Often, we are able to have a couple drinks, play pool, and enjoy an order of delicious garlic fries for all under $25 with a fairly generous tip.

This is, one of our favorite local dive hangout in town and I strongly recommend it to all. If they choose to expand their pool table selection, I could easily see this review updating to a 5/5 status.",xEbCNG-3GTw-OxFusnVP9g,7,3,4,BxATycMiCb80S4xAQ3w9EA
2675782,2017-01-11,8,59YbAeuiz0isJtRNKATTKw,"This is a really cool place. Who doesn't love bacon?! My boyfriend and I decided to come here late one night for some drinks and food. I got there before my man since we took separate cars and were both out. I sat myself at a machine and put in $6 cash. That's really all I had in cash until he got there. 

The bartender took my drink order which was a jack n coke double and checked my ID. I can't remember the name but he had a beard and a microdermal piercing on his face. He also told me that he couldn't comp the drink for me since it wasn't $20 in the machine. I never asked. I just wanted my drink and to gamble a little. I couldn't care less about getting comped for one drink. I've been in the food industry for a long time, trust me, I know it's not enough. He then tried to close out my tab and have me pay immediately. Uh no. I'm not done. I'll let you know when I am. 

My boyfriend shows up and got his drink as well. We looked at the menu and it was just beautiful. Not the presentation of it, but the fact that the word ""bacon"" was all over it!!! I got the bacon wrapped country fried steak and eggs. My boyfriend got the peanut butter and jelly burger. My country fried steak was massive! Smothered in gravy too. It came with eggs, white bread, and hash browns. The hash browns are your typical hash browns. The country fried steak had my name written all over it. It was one of the best ones I've ever had besides hash house! Keep in mind that the plate is bigger than my machine. I was very happy with the food. Now for the burger.. I was never into the salty and sweet combination, but it was so delicious!!! I'll be getting that for sure next time I go in. It was worth every bite. And everything on the menu is really affordable as well! For the food, it was probably $20 at most! 

My boyfriend wanted another drink but the bartender seemed a little too busy playing games with his friends that came in to notice so it took a while. Took a while for him to noticed that we were ready to leave. All in all it's a great place!

2779061,2013-08-16,12,59YbAeuiz0isJtRNKATTKw,"So they changed the name and the look. This bar went thru ""Bar Rescue"". Something was going on wrong to get to that point. Do bar owners think its only the 'name' or the 'look' that make the bar fail? In this case, I guess so. 
I went in about 12:30am to try one of their new 'signature ' drinks. 
I walked in and took a seat at the bar. Text my friends where to meet and waited for the male bartender(who was in front of me) standing there talking to the guy that I sat next to. After about 5 minutes in the conversation, he went and asked some other group of people if their drinks were good. Then he started balancing a bottle on the back of his hand and doing dog tricks for them. At that point, I moved closer to the middle of the bar area and sat right in front of this, I'm assuming, bar back. All she did was put dirty empty glass after glass right at my spot. 30 glasses easy after all said and done while I sat still waiting for acknowledgment. I saw her look at me, but not even a half smile. I got a text asking if I'm still there from my friends. At that time , I moved to a third location at the bar. There was this girl bartender counting out her drawer or something. She had her back to me as I waited and watched the male do circus tricks and the bar back clean the bar. I wanted to go to the area of the bar where people were getting served drinks. No one was getting help. Everyone (20) people total were just talking and playing pool. So I text my friends at 12:50 and told them to meet me at another location. 
This place blows. 20 minutes and not even a.. 'be right with you'? I read their menu 5 times and had my drink ready to be ordered. I just sat there with a smile on my face waiting for SOMEONE to say, 'we're closed', we ran out of..', we don't serve your kind here', or something. 
I see why this place Failed before and they needed to be ""rescued"". There are WAYYY to many other bars in Vegas to waste time in this establishment. I give this place 2 months after the bar airs on the show before it goes back to the way it was.

2797525,2013-12-23,10,59YbAeuiz0isJtRNKATTKw,"I just literally got back from there and I have mixed emotions. I would say my experience was bittersweet. Let me explain.

What is it about bacon that makes everything good? The saltiness? The greasy goodness? Maybe its the fact that it is really not good for you that it makes it taste that much better. Well, the fact that this place has a bacon theme is what sold me.

With that said, I came with my wifey to check it out. I ordered The Cure and she ordered the Man Candy. We also got the Garlic Parmesan Fries because I love garlic. Then, we capped it off with dessert by getting the Panookie.

The Cure (13.95). Pork Belly with 2 Fried Eggs and Tomato Jam on a French Baguette. 
This entrée was a bit overwhelming. First off, it is very messy, as soon as you pick it up, you have grease and/or egg yolk running down your arms. The pork belly itself was more belly than pork. A lot of fat with some slivers of actual pork. It tasted decent, but a lot of the fat turned me off.

Man Candy (6.95). Glazed Bacon with Cayenne accompanied by Maple Syrup to dip it in. 
Now this masterpiece is a magnificent piece of art that has been placed in a jar for your eyes to feast on. Dip it in the syrup and you will be in bacon heaven. Now this entrée alone is worth the trip just to come here. I recommend getting this no matter what you or your party decides on getting. 

Garlic Parmesan Fries (4.95). French Fries sprinkled with grated Parmesan Cheese and Garlic Powder.
Now this I was a bit disappointed. To me, if you are going to serve the best Garlic Parmesan Fries, use real bits of garlic and sliced parmesan/romano cheese. The best I have had is at another restaurant that I will not mention out of respect for these guys. Message me if you are interested in that place.

Panookie (5.00). A niced sized Cookie baked in a aluminum dish topped off with Whipped Cream, Ice Cream and Chocolate Syrup.
It's exactly as described. Ours was a bit burnt on the bottom so it was a bit hard. I think it was a bit overcooked. It probably would of been great it it wasn't burnt.

Service was decent. Our server was on point with order taking, refills, etc. which it should of been because it was just us and another party of 2 she was serving.

Ambience: Since it's called ""Bacon Bar"", you have to picture a typical bar scene with people hanging out and of course, smoking. Even though we were seated in the ""Dining Area"", we weren't really sealed off from the smoke coming from the bar. So basically you will be inhaling second hand smoke guaranteed. At the bar you have to be 21. But you can bring your kids to the dining area. Now this to me is a big negative. You and your party will be exposed to secondhand smoke.

So my 3 star rating is a bit generous since my original thought were 2 stars. Like I mentioned earlier, the Man Candy alone warrants a visit here. For you not so bacon lovers, they have other things like Pizza, Wings, Pasta, etc. for your other dining options so bacon doesn't have to be your default choice.  Also, they are open 24 hours which can be a good or bad thing depending on how you look at it. Next time I will try the Bacon Burger and I will see if it can be bumped up to 4 stars.",0FMte0z-repSVWSJ_BaQTg,34,14,3,7s_8Tt8BJvylXeBsQSGEWA

Next came the bacon wrapped peppers, which lasted 3 minutes because they were so freaking good! Heather made sure we sampled the Man Candy bacon, but we'll save that for next trip. Next came the main course, a peanut butter and and jelly bacon cheese burgerrrrrrr! The burger was a perfect medium rare. Can't beat hand cut fries! My only recommendation would be to add more jelly to the burger.

First off, I saw the mixed reviews. And I was worried as years of watching makeover restaurant shows hasn't left me hopeful for the longterm prospects of such place. The ""do we seat ourselves"" shuffle threw us off, but a waitress noticed our lost expressions and pointed our way. 

As to the food, it was solid. I'm not sure how much bacon people expect, but there seemed to be a friendly side of bacon in most of the menu items along with the side menu everyone else has mentioned. Husband man loved his ribs, my bacon penne had a light / fresh tomato marinara and the bacon nibblets were delicious smoky treats to balance. And the man candy? Heart attack heavenly! 

For the bar part, the bloody Mary's, while pricey were rich and clearly alcoholic and the thick slice of perfectly cooked bacon was a fabulous treat. The real shining star though was the beer. Coming from San Diego, I've missed being able to walk in to random restaurant to a healthy selection of big name/niche/local/craft beers. This place had some wonderful stuff on tap and apparently they shift around their offerings fairly regularly. Plus, the price was extremely reasonable for the quality of beers we had, and seeing a local brewery's offerings was delightful. 

All in all the bill wasn't off the charts, our particular server was charming, speedy and helpful, and I look forward to maybe having a neighborhood haunt.",DmiwQUy-U7ZzfX4oiQqQjQ,2,0,4,q3_sqcolzW9WUVJRQ_al3w

When we got there, we sat there for about 10 minutes before I asked the lady with tattoos down her left arm if we could get beers. She must have walked passed me a few times and just ignored me, not good business sense. I ordered the Man Candy and after 30 minutes I hadn't received it. I think the left arm tattoo lady forgot to order it. I finally asked Justin and he brought it out promptly.  Now Justin on the other hand was very nice and a great bartender, he took over after tattoo lady was finished. Justin I think has good business sense and he cares about the business, example I watched him show tattoo girl how to make a drink. 

The bar itself is actually very big, and lots of seats at the bar too. Great place to watch a sporting game. I did ask Justin a couple of questions about bar rescue, and was very appreciative of his honesty.

3207579,2018-05-15,1,59YbAeuiz0isJtRNKATTKw,"We had my sailor in town who just returned from an 8 month deployment, and we wanted to meet up with a friend for some bacon influenced food and, of course, drinks.
We got to Bacon Bar at around 4:15 on Saturday, just as the Golden Knights game with Winnipeg was starting. 
There are about 24 tv screens in the front bar area, which is not terribly loud. The large group next to us, while happy and mostly eating and drinking, added to the loudness of the bar.
We sat near the screens, not realizing there is a nice back room too. 
We ordered a Bacon bloody Mary, a blueberry IPA which I later replaced with a great Jalapeno IPA, and another ale.
Our server, Lauren, was great to explain all the different dishes about which we had questions.
We got a bacon candle, which is garnished with a queso-like cheese, mint leaves, and a balsamic sauce. You scrape the candle fat on some nice focaccia-like bread, much like a bruscheta. It was good.
I got the peanut butter and jelly burger with bacon, which to my mind was juicier and better than that of Slater's 50/50 out of San Diego and Pasadena, CA. The seasoned fries were pretty good.
My husband ate schnitzel which he felt was ok.
My son had teriyaki wings which I liked.
My friend had another burger without a bun, with regular fries.
The place was pretty busy and they had what appeared to be too little staff, but we generally enjoyed the attention we did get.
One star would be added if there were a possibility of an easier time getting a server, as they did seem slammed.
All in all, it's great for sports events, but if you are wearing hearing aids, it would be painful with all the ambient noise.",hd-S4mtrPY9Q6iuBJegnOQ,4,2,4,mK3enisZfRnwtISG0NyuiQ

3333590,2017-03-25,0,59YbAeuiz0isJtRNKATTKw,"This review is for 3.5 stars.

I came to Bacon Bar because I heard they had a bunch of TVs and a quality beer selection.  This was definitely the case, with a bunch of beer from local venues as well as some high alcohol strong ales and stouts from notable breweries on the West Coast.  I was able to try a bunch of really strong beers and even was given a few samples for free from the bartender.  They put my games on the TV so I had good viewing pleasure.

Now my biggest issue has to do with the price.  Most of the good beers in the 7-10% range were $8-9.  They serve these in 10oz glasses.  The lower quality beers are $6.50.  I really wish they had a HH or something with half off options or a few bucks off because I like the venue and selection it's just way too expensive.  Also, the bartenders were good when they were around but favored the usuals which I have no problem with but don't turn your shoulder to a potential new staying customer.

It is very much in North Vegas so unless I'm in the area or the pricing model is updated, I probably won't be back.  But still this is a nice beer-centric bar so if you happen to be in the area and love a good beer, check this place out and get some rare varieties.",JaqcCU3nxReTW2cBLHounA,1,1,3,E4C4_By_F_ItqGIHOpJoVQ

3550835,2013-11-23,0,59YbAeuiz0isJtRNKATTKw,"So decided on an impromptu trip to Las Vegas.  Hopped in the car and five hours later we are in Vegas.  Because we had been watching Bar Rescue we decided to try out some of the ""reformed"" bars.  We head over to Bacon Bar.

We weren't really hungry so we just decided to pop in for a drink an maybe a small plate.  The Bar is pretty spacious and you ca tell it has just been renovated.  Because the bar is a few feet from the door, I think they should have some type of hostess stand at the entrance.

We grab two seats at the bar and the bar tender came over to take our order.  I had the bourbon boar bloody mary.  On a scale of 1-10 I give it a 5.5.  It was good but I wasn't overwhelmed.  It was mixed well but was expecting a little more taste on the pallet.  The one negative thing I have is that upon looking at the menu I had my mind set on the ""Man Candy"" appetizer only to discover from the bartender that they don't have any at the moment.  She  stated that once the chef comes in the will have some more.  One plus was that she went into the kitchen and was able to get enough ""man candy""  to have a sample.  The little sample I did have was DELICIOUS!!  It's like the perfect marriage of sweet and salty and its BACON.  When you bite into the bacon you get that crown royal maple infused syrup followed by the salty bacon.  HMMMM! HMMMM! Good.  To top it off after you chew a few times you get a subtle finish of cayenne pepper on the back end. 

Overall my experience was good although I would have loved to have their ""man candy"" appetizer but they were out.  Overall I recommend you check this place out.  It is a little ways from the strip though so prepared for a 20 minute drive.",KCDW_6CWsVIjY-Zar0MDNA,0,0,3,3stLqDUcgKikcMO7_1Xr1A

ATMOSPHERE:

Very spacious clean bar, well lit with multiple TV  screens to catch the game as well as games to play, like pool and shuffleboard. Staff members are very personable and inviting which is a plus. Great spot for a late bite(open 24 Hours) and also a good spot to meet up with a few peeps.

BITES//BEVERAGES:

When at The BACON BAR, order something with bacon, right? Well, you don't have to, but you're going to want to! Appetizers, burgers, sandwiches, salads, pizzas, calzones, strombolis, subs, all that...your typical game day grub, and not everything has bacon, so if you're not into swine, other dining options are available like omelettes and breakfast items as well. Wide varieity of beers on tap and a full bar too.My Ultimate Bacon Cheeseburger was perfectly medium rare like I ordered, and the Garlic Parmesan Fries were the perfect accompaniment. Our waitress Hannah failed to mention the $1.50 upcharge, so be warned that REGULAR fries come with your order. All other options will cost you extra.

CLOSING STATEMENTS:

Cool local bar in the Northwest area that's always open, wide variety of food and drink options, generous portions and reasonable price point with plenty of parking, and surprisingly not overly secondhand smokey. You can enjoy your food without feeling like you're chewing on a a cancer stick.  ALOHA!!!

It's fresh jalapeños filled with cream cheese wrapped with bacon on top of maple  syrup. Very soggy no breading. And then a friend ordered a hamburger with fries it looked good.

3973022,2017-08-04,6,59YbAeuiz0isJtRNKATTKw,"Two of us came here for dinner and we shared several items from the menu as suggested by Chef Christopher Palmeri, owner of the Naked City pizza places.  

We were served:

Man Candy
Roasted garlic bacon buns
B & B pizza
Porky Pile
Bacon beignets
Apple crunch

The Man Candy is for people who like bacon and like it sweet.  It's applewood smoked bacon that's cooked in a candy glaze and served standing in a canning jar with a side of maple syrup in which to dip the bacon slices.  The syrup is not needed--it's a bit of overkill but the bacon is quite good.  Bacon buns with garlic, bacon, and red sauce are good but a serving is meant to be shared by several people.

The winner for the night was the Porky pile--pulled pork, bacon, roasted pork loin, white BBQ, tangy coleslaw, and cheddar on a brioche bun.  This is piled high and served with fries.  It is a dish to be shared but I'm sure one could eat this alone if that's all you ordered.

As for desserts, the beignets were a disappointment but the Apple crunch was quite good and is another dish to be shared by a table full.

I had read of the Bacon Bar and I was glad to get the chance to try out some of the things that Chef Palmeri is doing to change the items on the menu and add some new things from the Naked City menus.",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,17,11,4,8U1tbd-H6QbhtkTmNCe3MA

The bar service on graveyard was great your late night lass did her job. Your kitchen is slacking. I just wanted your bacon burger fries and an extra of coleslaw. 


Here is what sucks, I had a take out order. It is also 5am. I am not inclined to come on back after my first bite, wrap everything back up, put the whole package back in the bag, get in my transport, drive on down, get of my teansport, explain the situation, have it fixed, this time take a check at the bar,  get back in my transport, drive back home and then dine on my just bitten into dinner. 

Dry as hell is not medium. A burger that was requested medium has juice left. It is not bone dry. Your graveyard cook was not giving a damn about his job. If i wanted that type of cooking j would have went to mcdonalds down the street.

Have your graveyard make a medium rare, medium and well done burger on different nights. Take a temp, take a pic, take a bite. I hope it was better than what I requested as I feel I got an overloaded mcdonalds meat which should have hit the trash.",5cxk_eDtMKHU7YOnZHzzsQ,6,1,2,ysIVz2qMCHyJwlZPByFObw

If you go on the website the first thing that pops up is bacon wrapped jalapeños the were not on the menu and it was 10.00 for four small soggy bacon wrapped jalapeño. Not very good the place is huge I was with people that smoke it's all opened area but you could only smoke at the bar so stupid our waitress was less then happy to be there only the signature drinks were on the menu so it was only 4 bloody Mary's the self serve beer thingy our waitress didn't know much about it she said oh that's the bartender you get a card or something and you pay by the ounce. So this amazing wall of beer taps was in the corner of the bar you can't see it from the front part and it's Behind the pool table where a bunch of thugs were playing pool. So I stuck with the waitress and had a Bloody Mary it was pretty good. I had man candy bacon that was tasty too All this appetizer bar food was 10 bucks EACH really!!!!! So I found the bathroom which is behind the bar in a dark hallway and the hallway smelled like shit literally shit. so my bill only mine was 35.00 I could of gone to Texas de Brazil for that kind of money I'm done ranting and I won't be going back oh and next to the bathrooms is the kitchen bar rescue failed as far as I'm concerned,EBdfB7Y3Y0ACOb3H94a5yw,7,3,2,JVkneHZ0LxQg6p-druNr7A

4092023,2018-06-27,0,59YbAeuiz0isJtRNKATTKw,"First off, our server was GREAT, she was quick, friendly and overall a joy!

However the food was a different story.

First we ordered the bacon onion rings. They came out FAST, like quicker than our blood marys fast... They were okay, nothing great, nothing bad. 

Then the Blood Marys arrived. They were also okay, the bacon in them was decent, but the bloody mary juice was not my favorite, but that is common and maybe their other drinks are good.

The problem was our food. We ordered and it took about 30 minutes to arrive. There were about 4 other tables, so not exactly busy. 

One would expect that covering food in bacon would mean it is extra flavorful.  I had the bacon wrapped chicken fried steak.  It was by far the most bland CFS I have ever had, and I have had them in a lot of places.  I was honestly shocked.  

I also normally am a stickler for hash browns over home fries, etc.  However ""diced potatoes with onions"" sounded like Potatoes O'Brien, not chunks of potato cut up, so I gave that a try. Turns out ""diced"" meant cut into 1.5 inch pieces and barely cooked, practically raw--only saw a couple pieces of diced onions, and again, COMPLETELY flavorless.

Neither I nor my buddy ate even close to half our meals and we left very disappointed.

Again, our server was a delight, too bad the restaurant failed. This was my first visit to a Bar Rescue restaurant, something I was looking forward to--in fact we drove over from the strip just to try it out, but I can say there is ZERO chance I would ever return to this restaurant.",vdlbKk8Jq99F8OMO7nSw_Q,0,0,2,7Gdb84PGPUWRYDgLJFmB6g

I can't remember my servers name but she was seriously awesome! My drink was always full and she came by the table continuously to see if we needed anything else. 

I couldn't resist ordering a bacon Bloody Mary and it was sooooooo good! They had happy hour going on where there is a set drink list that is buy one get one free. I didn't order off that menu but next time I will try it. I'd also like to add they have Viking Mead that is delicious! 

Anyways, drinks were awesome but let's get down to the food part. We ordered the bacon wrapped jalapeños poppers which were so good and spicy! I can't remember what my burger was called but it was there simple cheeseburger and it had potato chips on it. The burger was massive and an excellent quality of meat. Tasted great.

I chose a different entree which was the bacon beer battered fish and chips and that was disappointing.

The ribs were dry, the garlic fries was greasy and tasteless, and coleslaw was all mayo and no flavor. The bacon burger sounded promising but was super greasy and did not pack flavor and the wings were just OK. What I enjoyed was the bloody mary. I can't recall exactly which one I had (had to be one with tequila in it) but it was pretty good.

When we arrived we thought that we would have to eat in the bar area but immediately noticed tables in another section of the bar. Barely as soon as we started to walk through the bar a waitress greeted us and seated us at a table. The menu has a lot of food items and as the name of the establishment says a lot of the food is made with bacon. The waitress recommended some items after hearing what we might be interested in. My wife ordered a hamburger and she loved it. I had the chicken fried steak wrapped in bacon and it was tasty. We did order an appetizer of the man candy and I do have to say that I've never had bacon like this and it was good. We were almost ready to ask for the check when the waitress asked us if we wanted dessert. She recommneded a pineapple or apple cheesecake I believe she called it. When we got the dessert both my wife and I took a bite and it was delicious. The place sure does deserve a five star rating as the food and service were both 5 star quality.,K4zo3uUYDVlJVR2iPWJiQA,0,0,5,39Y2-Jw-gqHAWjYIdeP4QA

Quaint lil place.  
Laura was our server.  She was friendly and fast and checked on us enough but not too much that would annoy us.
Dad and I ordered the Bacon Burger well done.  I substituted Swiss I think instead of the Horseradish and Chive Cheddar.  Super good burger.  The fries were good also.
The bacon wrapped onion rings (main reason I wanted to go) were just ok.  The first one was super crispy and cooked perfectly.  The rest....eh.  Although the bacon was crispy, the onion ring itself was not.  Was very disappointed.

There were no specials, no cocktail menu. The only cocktails they advertised were 4 pricey Bloody Mary drinks. I was tempted to order the Mary's Garden but changed my mind because it was 7:30pm and it probably would not go well with the pizza 

The four cheese mini pizza I ordered was meh. The menu did not say that it didn't have sauce. The blue cheese on the pizza was overwhelming and rich. It was basically bread and cheese. 

My awesome friend saw on their website they had bacon wrapped jalapeño poppers. It wasn't even on the menu and the bartender/ waitress didn't even mention it. She also didn't mention one thing about the self-service beer which was such a big deal on Bar Rescue. We noticed that no one was using the self-service beer station and we suspected the bartenders were not promoting because they won't get tips?

The bartender even talked my friend out of ordering a burger because ""the burgers are really too big.""

The place is rather misleading compared to how they advertise it on tv and their website. It appeased to be a really cool place and turned out to be a mediocre place, just another neighborhood bar. 

There was a lot of riff raff in there and overall was just another video poker tavern. 
 Last but not least my 2 wines were NOT comped even though I was playing the machines. That is a load of crap! We won't be back. Sorry Jon Taffer.",TOrRfYRFuxx0k9HH7OC6pQ,16,2,2,ScYFTjnwPHV7yBpkliQskQ

Now I can say the food was excellent, the bar was clean and the beer was cold. Cool. But. It just happen to be ""All you can eat Ribs on thursday"". Keep in mind we had no desire what so ever to  order ribs but the waitress didn't even sit us down before shoving it down out face that they are all out ribs. We didn't care, we didn't want any damn ribs. Now it's also the nba playoffs season and the game is not on any of the 20 TV's. Did I ask about the game? 
No! they shoved that in my face too. Seemed odd since all the other TV's were playing hockey and baseball and even a Tom Hanks movie just fine. Oh yeah and horse racing. Not playing nba playoff basketball in a sports bar doesn't seem like they want to make money. Now after eating our food like I said It was great, one of the best burgers I have ever had. The man candy was a hit as well. As we pay for our food, my lady notices a gentleman behind at his table with sticky hands and tearing down a nice plate of ribs.

Me and my lady are Black. The customer was not. 
Think about how that made us feel. 

Now if the waitress would have never mentioned they was out a ribs before she even sat us down and gave us menus I wouldn't have a had care in the world. I'm not one to complain it
just sucks to have go out and have to feel like that.

The crowd there seem like lots of jerks. My gf told me when we got home that someone was starring at her every time I would leave. The main reason we went out that night was to dance and that dance floor if you can call it that was shit.

Not EVERYTHING is bacon drenched, so if you are looking for something else, you should still be ok with their long-listed menu.  But for the bacon/fat LOVERS out there, you will get your thirst quenched!

I went with The Bacon Burger ($12.95): 60/40 Beef/Bacon Patty, Croissant Bun, Horseradish and Chive Cheddar, Caramelized Onions, Arugula, and Garlic Fries ($1.50 add). Great burger! Super juicy, fatty and messy...just how I like em! Not quite Slaters, but very good, and the Garlic Fries are the MOST garlicky I've had! Vampire worthy for sure!  Yum :)

Also tried The Cure ($13.95): Maple Glazed Beer Braised Bacon on a Toasted Baguette, Fried Egg, Tomato Jam, and Garlic Fries ($1.50 add). This was good, ""bacon"" was an inch thick cut of pork belly lol...heart attack anyone?? It was very sweet, from the Maple glaze...pretty tasty overall!  I'd still recommend the burger of course ;)

If the burger had a little more zing to it, I think it could possibly push this review to a 5!  Prices are super reasonable and the food is great, just needs a little more somethin to get it to sparkle lol

I'll be back for another!

3) The menu on the website that we looked at and used to decide what we would order has been changed. No...it's been gutted. They didn't have any of the items we had planned to order. 
4) I settled on Joe Mac, which is basically sloppy joe meat on top of macaroni and cheese. The pasta was the blandest Mac and cheese I have ever had. Thank goodness the sloppy joe meat was good, it saved the meal. I left most of the pasta in the bowl. 
5) Bartender was more interested in flirting with the 20-something guys on the other side of the bar than in doing her job. She never asked if we wanted another beer and our waters were empty with no refill.

What a concept.  Everyone loves bacon, so why not have a bar that is bacon themed?   

My husband had been here once before a few years ago, but after a night of drinking and karaoke on Monday night, we decided to pop in here for a Bloody Mary on Tuesday morning. 

This bar is huge.  It looks like it might have a separate restaurant side?  But I'm not sure about that.  We sat towards the back wall near the restrooms.  

Service was polite.  I didn't get our bartender's name, but she was nice.  She gave us recommendations that did not disappoint, and checked on us frequently.  

The drinks were great.  Garnished with a huge piece of bacon, we each had a bacon bloody, mine with vodka, his with gin (sounds weird, but it was amazing)

Prices are a little high here.  Drinks were $8.50 or $9 each.  There wasn't really anything on the menu for less than $8, so we didn't try any food yet. 

I do want to come back, when we have a little more money to spend.  I want to try the mantini and also the man candy, among other things.",renPzRDqMZpMaHiCD_e1_A,6,2,3,OTWM65Z43dRpj3oLEkNNRw

I know that wait times are unrealistic and certain items on the menu may be unavailable. I've worked in a restaurant before and feel like people can be incredibly harsh on those who work in food service. That being said, my experience was terrible at the bacon bar last week. The only reason we didn't get up and leave was because of the good company of people who went with me to eat. Despite being a VERY slow Friday, there were multiple problems with our evening. First, when we sat down, the waitress (who was very kind) told us that she didn't recommend that we get their signature bacon bloody mary (which we wanted) because the bartenders ""made like ten in the past hour and they are over it."" Um. Im sorry. What? This is YOUR SIGNATURE DRINK. It's what you are known for and one of the most popular items on the menu. And you won't make one for us? Because you're tired? Shame on the bartenders and also the waitress for making us feel guilty for wanting something that is actually ON THE MENU. Someone in our group was particularly upset by it and we demanded that we get these drinks, which likely ended up having spit in them or something if they're really that pissy about mixing some tomato juice and alcohol lol
Furthermore, our appetizer order came out wrong and we never got the correct order, some of the entrees took over a half hour (like a BLT, come on) and were cold upon arriving, and to top it off, my boyfriend got food poisoning that night (probably because of the temperatures that the food sat at for so long). The checks were split incorrectly and none of the food was particularly exceptional. In fact, my BLT had more lettuce on it than bacon. And this is the BACON BAR?! I had no idea that this place had been on Bar Rescue until we had already ordered, but after visiting it I can say that none of us will be back and someone should come and Re-rescue it. I don't care what kind of mood you're in when you come to work, but you can't just refuse to make certain items because you're not ""feeling it."" In the real world, people get fired for not doing parts of their job that they don't like. I really wanted to like this place, and we all were very polite and tried to be accommodating to the waitress, which is a joke, because we are the ones paying. They should be accommodating us.

Previously titled Kerry's Sports Pub but re-christened ""Bacon Bar"" after a visit from the television program Bar Rescue in 2013 it was always as sort of a novelty that many locals looked at the 24/7 spot at 3520 North Rancho Drive, former Yardbird Chef Melvin Johnson having recently departed for New York after a remarkably short stay and the Restaurant still, apparently, struggling to make ends meet when an odd twist of fate saw them connected with Christopher Palmeri of Naked City Pizza fame.

Self-applying the term 'Gastropub,' though by most standards a Sports Bar not unlike many others in town, the forty-four Beers on tap and 90+ Bottles definitely a focus in addition to the gaming area, televisions and porky décor,  it was just past 6:00pm on a Thursday that two friends with no interest in drinking entered the space to a warm welcome from one of two bartenders, the 21+ signage universally predicting a scent of cigarettes that was thankfully short lived thanks to the smoke-free dining area in back.

 No doubt a unique situation, the ultra-competitive Las Vegas marketplace quick to claim the dreams of many would-be restaurateurs regardless of skill and the recent shutter of Naked City Tavern due to investor issues a particularly painful loss given its aspirations, it was with Chef Palmeri quickly identified as he was training kitchen staff that pleasantries were exchanged, the ever busy man explaining his consulting role and goals to improve everything by way of simplifying the menu in a ""less is more, but better"" way.

Less than 1/8 full on a Saturday during a slow part of the sports calendar, national exposure and a theme built on one of America's favorite indulgences still not enough to hold attention in ever-changing Sin City when the menu is a slipshod arrangement of four different types of bagged Fries, store-bought Pizza Dough and omnipresent Bar Snacks, it was at Palmeri's discretion that the party of two allowed him to chart the night's course, a Bacon Bar standby of ""Man Candy"" placing Applewood Bacon inside a sugary Crust alongside Maple-Whisky Sauce with a little spice, Naked City's Dough offered next in a puffy spiral surrounding more crisp Pig with a liberal bit of roasted Garlic, Mozzarella and a sidecar of Marinara making for some very good Garlic Knots.

Having always shown a good hand with Sandwiches, the South Buffalo Breakfast and Hot Mama offered as brunch Specials at Naked City Pizza on Paradise without doubt two of the best reasons for tourists to venture off-Strip early on a weekend, Bacon Bar sees Palmeri going Hog wild with the ""Porky Pile,"" a fork-and-knife event comprised of Pulled Pork, Bacon, and roasted Loin with zippy Sauce and Slaw beneath Cheddar, juices pouring forth with each bite onto hand-cut fries while three types of Pork also find their way onto one of Naked City's Square Pies with a familiar pillowy Crust plus Garlic, sliced Tomatoes and Arugula tossed in Citrus.

Not yet laying hands on the Dessert Menu, Chef Palmeri at this point taking his leave en route for Paradise and reminding anyone who ever considered such a thing of the rigors of being a Chef with more than one location, it was with the listed Bread Pudding unavailable that the decision was instead made to invest in an oversized ""Apple Crunch"" and unfortunately overcooked Beignets topped in crumbled Bacon and Powdered Sugar, the former just $7.95 for the sort of decadence best shared by more than two people as Bacon-laced Streusel is baked atop a creamy Cheesecake with stewed Apples, Whipped Cream, slowly-melting Ice Cream and Caramel.

***1/2: Allowing Chef Palmeri to take the reins of a floundering concept may just be the smartest move Bacon Bar has made since it switched over from Kerry's Sports Pub, the menu still a work in progress but already selling items like the Bacon Candle and those listed above plus several Naked City Favories such as the Guinea Pie and Suicide Fries.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,7,6,4,97qWvFZcLMA_8D_Y2ayHxQ

5319968,2013-09-20,3,59YbAeuiz0isJtRNKATTKw,"I don't normally eat animal fat but when I do, it's bacon (or pork belly)...stay fatty, my friend. 

This is a bar/pub type of place. There's nothing fancy. You walk in and you can immediately smell porky goodness. They have 4 different drinks with bacon in it and 4 bacon dishes on the menu. They also have sandwiches, salads, pizza and other typical bar food. We tried the Bacon Burger and The Cure, both with garlic fries for an additional $1.50/order.

The Bacon Burger:
60/40 patty comes with arugula, horseradish and chive cheddar, caramelized onions on a croissant bun. Slater's in California has a 50/50 burger which is 50% bacon and 50% beef. Bacon Bar's version is 60% beef and 40% bacon. It's not as great as Slater's but good enough...I wish they have something similar to vampire dip to add on the burger. I didn't taste horseradish. The patty was nice, smokey and fatty. 4/5

The Cure:
Maple glazed beer braised bacon with tomato jam and egg on a toasted baguette. A huge chunk of unsliced sweet pork belly on a sandwich. The bacon/pork belly wasn't crispy so I had to slice off the thick layer of fat. 3.5/5

Garlic Fries:
OMG! One of the best garlic fries ever. Garlicky and crispy fries with Parmesan cheese. I believe they use garlic oil instead of real fresh garlic cloves but the flavor is amazing. 5/5

5328972,2014-07-04,2,59YbAeuiz0isJtRNKATTKw,"I ate here the other day with a friend for lunch and I ordered caesar salad with garlic knots. I couldn't order anything really MEATY and JUICY because I had just come from the gym so I was already being bad with the knots. My friend ordered garlic fries and I couldn't wait to literally try ONE! ( ;o(  ).

Since the knots were an appetizer I expected it to be maybe 3-6 pieces but when they arrived at the table it was ATTACK OF THE KNOTS! These little round knots seemed LIGHTLY brushed in butter, garlic, and parmesan cheese- not coated like I had hoped. I had two sauces (so bad for me) ranch, and tomato. I expected this to be WORTH me eating calories I just burned. Finally after one bite--I didn't really taste anything. I ate another knot--this time dipped in one of the sauces. Nothing. It was similar to eating a pretzel. You know its BREAD---but well, it's just....bread. It was like that with the fries, caesar salad, and my knots! Nothing had flavor. I expected the garlic to roar with flavor and cheese--and the knots nor the fries did that. The knots were also very dry and I gave my cheeks a massage afterwards. 

Overall the service was great, and I love the atmosphere--especially in the afternoon because no one is in there and its quiet. That is a huge plus. I'd like to come back and try something different and maybe I'll have some better luck. Despite the lack of flavor, I do like this place.",jwvmw22-y4eMq2rzi0wAeQ,5,2,3,ZG3giXgPHqfyk2IT2h67aw

5357967,2013-11-11,0,59YbAeuiz0isJtRNKATTKw,"I visited this place because I like Bar Rescue.

If it wasn't in the middle of nowhere for me I would find myself here once a week. I live in the Southwest area so it was a bit of a trek.

The bloody mary was good, but I could tell it was a store bought mix and it needed to be shaken. My first sip was basically vodka. Still enjoyed it. I got the spicy one, and the piece of bacon was the best part.

Our server was perfect. I didn't get her name, but girl, if you remember the chick with the pink pigtails that was with two guys, you were awesome. Just attentive enough without being overbearing.

The pizza was really good. I had the one with pepperoni, sausage, mushrooms, and onions. I love when pizza places aren't shy with the mushrooms, and they certainly are not. I was surprised not to see bacon as a pizza topping option and I think that should change.

The garlic knots are good too, but the marinara is a little simple and lacks depth. It's also enough of an appetizer for at least six people. 

Man candy... Well, I loved it. We got a couple of pieces that were too sticky but the ones that were just barely caramelized were excellent. The Crown Royal dipping sauce made me feel like breakfast.

All in all, I will go back to this place. I'd go back a lot if I lived anywhere near it.",WuPCEBFGX8W3ouTOd57ywQ,10,1,4,hO417WTDHLvQcUlNOABRRA

The place has a good feel with a large room with many available seats. The beer is good with a perfect temperature and they have a huge selection of beers on tap at bar and at world bar. The food is a mix of great and just ok. Certain items such as the appetizer ""Man Candy"" which is candied bacon with a side of syrup dipping sauce is great while other things such as burgers are good but nothing to rave about. I would suggest for someone who enjoys true fatty bacon flank to try a dish called ""The Cure"". That dish separates itself from other bar foods. One of my biggest complaints is the ""Bloodies"" which are a variation of 3 specialty bloody mary. They cost almost 10 bucks a piece which is very expensive if you wanna try a few different things. I ordered a Bloody Mary, The Cure, and Man Candy and my bill was right around 30 bucks. Not too expensive but sort of high for bar food.

They start you off with a whole rack of ribs, a nice serving of fries and a serving of Coleslaw.  If you finish and need more ribs they bring you out a 1/2 rack.  

The ribs are very very good - tender and flavorful.  

The fries are so very good, crispy on the outside and tender inside (but don't get them to go, they lose their crispiness).  

Unfortunately, the coleslaw just is pretty blah.  The good news is that the you don't really need it, just ask for more ribs.

I had the bacon cheeseburger. It was stuffed with chips, bacon, a sauce and a ton of relish. I like relish but it was kind of over powering. Maybe only applying it on one bun. The beef was delicious though. It was fresh and had simple delicious taste. 
My husband got the chicken fried steak wrapped in bacon drenched in gravy. He said it was really good. He did say there was a lot of bacon, but not like he was gonna complain about to much bacon!! 

We came here after looking at yelp and it said it is kid friendly. Although you can have kids in there it's attached to a bar which causes it to smell like cigarettes. I don't like to eat with cigs smoke. With that if you enter through the north door you will have to walk through the bar to get to the dining area. If you bring Kids enter through the south door. 

The dining area was open but kind of dark and some of the furniture is run down but clean!! 

You can see the kitchen from the dining area which always makes me feel better. I can see if the cooks have dirty habits while Preparing my food. 

The wait staff was nice. Our waitress said it was her first day she seemed to be doing a great job considering it was her first day!! 

If we eat here again it will be to go!!",Wk--RNQokW9Jrj2vJuWBww,3,0,4,mH5h42AnbqT3VS0knJHhrw

The bacon bloody Mary just became my fave and with the crunchy pieces of bacon in it, I could have sworn it would be at least $12 but it was only $8-9.  Also we shared a country fried steak meal that left us both full and we had some leftover.  The beer selection is out of this world.  Definitely coming back for another Bloody Mary.

It's a large establishment. There was about 30 people when we walked in & it just felt a little empty. Between the restaurant seating & the bar the space is laid out well. The overall atmosphere was very comfortable. Friendly bartenders greeting you with a smile is always a bonus!

""Awesome Sauce"" Bloody Mary is beyond delicious!

Do not pass up the garlic fries! Best in town hands down!

I had the mushroom burger and although it was loaded with pickles, onions, cheese, tomatoes, and a few mushrooms, it was pretty damn tasteless!!!  Seasoning the meat would have went a long way but they didn't do it so it had absolutely no flavor.   The pickle was probably the only thing on this burger that had any flavor.  I also asked for it to be medium and it came well done. The fries that came with it though were very good. I tasted my sister's bacon wrapped chicken fried steak and it was delicious!!  So, I guess just be careful what you order. Probably safe ordering any of their bacon items.

5877038,2014-06-23,7,59YbAeuiz0isJtRNKATTKw,"Even though the serve yourself bar tap system no longer works, The Bacon Bar was still an awesome experience.

The fiancé loved her Bloody Mary drink but didnt like that her piece of bacon got soggy (pull it out and eat it first I guess) and since the self serve system wasn't working I stuck with Guinness. On two occasions I had an empty mug for 10 to 15 minutes before I gave up and asked for a water and then the tab.

That was the bad. So let me tell you about the 60/40 bacon burger. Its ambrosia. Plain and simple its the best damn burger I've ever had. Perfectly seasoned meat. The caramelized onion mix was divine and whatever the sauce was could be sold like crack on the corner. If this was on my side of town I'd eat here once a week.

We also split a house salad. It was mostly ham and cheese but the lettuce and other vegetables were fresh and flavorful. 

Our friends joined us late. One works at a bar and couldn't get over the sheer magnitude of the bar. Its HUGE. If you have a large party they will be able to accommodate it. Don't know about the service since my beer sat empty twice but for another taste of that 60/40 burger I'd put up with an empty beer mug for a little while.",Yg08tRMxm0eaL-rXyNIAHw,14,8,5,j6PpWldQ8NMAapthNrWX1Q

5934793,2016-08-25,0,59YbAeuiz0isJtRNKATTKw,"Being a huge Bar Rescue fan, this was definitely a place I wanted to check out once I visited Las Vegas and finally got to it last night and it didn't disappoint.

We drove up to North Las Vegas onto N Rancho Drive which is not exactly a great part of Vegas but this place kind of stood out.  We walked in on a Tuesday night and there might've been 15-20 people in the place.  The bartender was pretty welcoming.  The place inside has great decor and a great TV setup to watch the games.  The only blemish is the occasional cigarette smoke that kind of takes away.

We got the BLT burger which includes a fried egg on the sandwich and the bacon was also excellent.  You can see into their kitchen and it was nice to see their head cook Ken from the episode still working in there.  I kind of regret not getting to try the man candy but that seems to be a hot item.  Eventually Justin came out and was helping with the bartenders.  He eventually asked us how we were doing and informed us of some upcoming promotions.    I think Bar Rescue gave him a bad edit but he looked like he was totally invested in the day to day operations and was really friendly to all the bar patrons around him. 

Overall I think everything is reasonably priced and there's a number of items to try out on both the food & drink menu.  Honestly the only downfall is being in a less attractive part of the metropolitan area.  However I can't wait to come back once I visit the area again.",QnjKq9K7a44FrqCHM9gnkg,7,2,5,YtnswSoukcUtmHi2BPx6Uw

I didn't recognize anyone from the taping. Also like Shawn H says not everything is Bacon oriented. I tried the philly steak was really great and also fries where not overly salty witch was nice. I also had a I think it was a choc stout with a cold glass I am not much a stout drinker mainly pilsner but wanted to try, very good if you like Guinness you like this. I did see the father I think witch was cool. Really cool I didn't do the touristy typical yelper thing and snap photos of everything like everyone does mainly at the bar. They are from what I hear a 24 hour operation with breakfast lunch and dinner they have biscuits and gravy witch I am shure to be back for and try.

But apparently they decided  to get rid of the best things on the menu. Now, I wouldn't reccomend this place to anybody. The bacon wrapped onion rings were so good; and now they are gone. So is the ""double edged sword"": a pork belly sandwich that tasted heavenly. They did away with bacon wrapped chicken tenders that were delicious. One of my favorite things to get at any restaurant was their bacon garlic knots; they are now off the menu. I'm sure there's more stuff i missed, the menu as a whole is much smaller than it used to be. They really seemed to cut back on the bacon and the really fun, memorable items they used to have that made this place so memorable. I can get a BLT or a bacon burger anywhere,  but those other items were unique to bacon bar. There really is no reason to go here any more.
