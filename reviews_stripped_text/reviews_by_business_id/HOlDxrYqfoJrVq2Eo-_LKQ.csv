We like this place because it's always clean, and their customer service is awesome as well. Yesterday morning, we had breakfast there. We were greeted immediately by Dominick. His upbeat, yet professional attitude is amazing. I work in this type of industry, and it's awesome to see people enjoying their job. Anyway, I go for the usual....he made a recommendation, which I took. And it was delicious. Southwest Salad Wrap! Yummmyyyyyyy! Our food did not take long at all, but then again... If we would have gone during lunch, I would have expected a long wait time. The tables were clean, and Dominick must have walked around 3 or 4 times, as well the other lady, to ask us if we were doing alright.

Took about 10 to get my order which was fine because I assumed it was cooked fresh. When she(Algerina) handed me the order she started jerking her arm out of the bag handles like she didn't want my gross Joe public hand to touch hers. Spectacular service indeed.

There must be two Maria's there, but I think the manager Keonne told me that her last name was Megunda, had the worst attitude I've ever seen. My girlfriend asked for her zucchini chopped and this lady had the audacity to say no. Now I understand if you can't do certain things, but when she's gone in there in the past and asked for the same thing, the cooks, employees or other managers never had a problem with it. I do think there are managers there that should not be. If this is how she treats all of her guests then you can count my business out. 

On the flip side of all of this, Dominick and Alejandro are amazing employees. They made sure our table was prebussed, food was out on time, offered to refill my drinks, I was very impressed.

A month or so ago, the darling Orchid and I went back to the Farmer Boys for another pleasant experience.  Well ... not any more.  I ordered the same sandwich I always seem to order there, plus an order of hash browns (I discovered that I really liked their hash browns) and a fountain drink.  Orchid ordered pancakes with sugar-free syrup and no powdered sugar, a soda and a milk shake (partly because she had a raw throat, and the milk shake really soothes her throat, and partially because ... well who doesn't like milk shakes?).  She asked that the shake be brought as quickly as possible, for its therapeutic value.

Downhill from there.  My hash browns were WAY undercooked and dripping with whatever oil they use to prepare them.  A request for a re-make was met with, shall we say, less than a smile.  Orchid's pancakes came out ten minutes later, buried under powdered sugar and regular syrup.  A request to provide what we ordered was met with even less enthusiasm than my request for properly-done hash browns.  An inquiry as to the disposition of her milk shake had a member of staff bring out their kitchen ticket showing that no milk shake was ever ordered.  However, the kitchen ticket presented was for someone else's order.  After requesting to speak with the manager on duty, a young lady came out and spent several minutes apologizing, and then she wrote a ""comp"" for two meals on the back of our receipt.

Do you really think that after all this dog-and-pony show, including improperly prepared food, bits and pieces of our meals delivered in a haphazard fashion over a period of fifteen minutes, that I'm ever going to trust this outfit again?  Not bloody likely, as my English correspondents would say.

1781288,2015-02-26,5,HOlDxrYqfoJrVq2Eo-_LKQ,"Fried zucchini. Pretty much the only thing that stands out here. It's a $4 side, but more commonly found at sit-down restaurants than a fast food version. It's actually a pretty giant portion, too. Tried it here for the first time after hearing others rave about it and was pleasantly surprised.

Rest of menu is typical salads (charbroiled chicken version is under 450 calls) and burgers, but they also get raves for their breakfast selection including omelets, bowls, and burritos. I appreciate that everything has a calorie count posted on their menus, even though it's not required here. 

Service is friendly, location is new and fairly convenient, with a drive-thru.

2548906,2015-10-29,1,HOlDxrYqfoJrVq2Eo-_LKQ,"I fell in love with the charbroiled chicken wrap at a different location.  I was near Decatur and Charleston today, and was craving the wrap, so decided to try this location.

First off, as I was waiting in the line, one of the cashiers dropped a drink cup on the floor.  It landed upside down - with the mouth rim TOUCHING the floor.  It appeared that he just stuck it back into the cup dispenser thingy.  But maybe MAYBE there was a trashcan there that I couldn't see from my angle.  I'm not too sure.  I should've said something, but I didn't.

I ordered my CHARBROILED chicken wrap.  I was asked if I wanted fried chicken or grilled chicken.  They didn't ask me this at the other location, so my brain went into a little panic.  (I don't like unexpected questions).  The voice in my head was like, ""We want CHARBROILED chicken.""  Did a few calculations in my head, realized grilled chicken is closest to charbroiled, so I said I wanted the grilled chicken.  Got my food to go, left, went back in to order lunch for a homeless lady, yada yada...

Okay, so I survived the Drunk Driving Convention that is obviously in town this week and made it home safely.  First thing I noticed is that my wrap was shaped like a grapefruit.  Took the paper off of it and discovered that I did receive a wrap, but it was just a big ball of stuff thrown into the middle of the tortilla, and then the edges were folded underneath.  It wasn't wrap-shaped.  Okay, whatever, no big deal.  Good things come in round packages, right?  When I took a bite, I couldn't even get thru it.  I unwrapped my wrapball to see what was going on, and I saw a bunch of hard pieces of popcorn chicken!!  Why bother asking what kind of chicken I want on my CHARBROILED chicken wrap, if you're just going to make it wrong anyways?

I live about a half hour away from this location.  It's not even worth it to drive back and complain.  I'll wait til I'm near Lamb and Craig and just go to that one.

In case you're wondering, the charbroiled chicken wrap does not taste good with popcorn chicken.  Even if they called it a ""Popcorn Chicken Wrap"" and only used the popcorn chicken pieces that are soft enough to eat, the different flavors don't go well together.  It's way too salty.  

Yes, that IS what she said.",elektz6cHmiFgfXmid-xiA,2,0,1,JOJefhuoC2btbJQglgcnGQ
2559241,2018-01-25,0,HOlDxrYqfoJrVq2Eo-_LKQ,"This was a very disappointing visit to farmer boys.   My husband and I ordered a Cobb salad and asked for it to be split like we always have.   We also ordered fish on the side.  We then sat down at a dirty table .  As we looked around there were quite a few tables that had dirty plates on them.  It took a long time to get our food.  

Sergio (team leader)brought us our food. I noticed that the salads were not split in the normal skillet style containers that we have always seen in the past and our fish was sitting on top of our salad.  I spoke to Sergio and said this doesn't look like the salad we usually have. Sergio says it is, we just don't have any skillets available at this time.  I said it looks smaller and there is no avocado on the salad.  He brought us a separate plate with avocado on it.  I asked him for a business card with his manager name on it.  

Sergio (team leader) never asked us what he could do for us. He brought us the business card and left.  Poor customer service , Sergio didn't offer to fix my displeasure over the food. 

The salad was half the size it normally was.   I felt like we received 2 small side salads.  I am adding pictures from this farmer boys restaurant and pictures from another farmer boys to show you the difference.   I also called in and spoke to another lead support person asking for the manager (wasn't there) then the district Mgr phone number, he said he couldn't give that out.  He never offered to give me the farmer boys 1800 customer service number. I called another farmers boys and received the 1800. Number.

I love having avocado in the salad.  The chicken, the cheese, the egg....oh, I guess there is lettuce under all that good stuff.  

I just love that all of the ingredients are fresh.  It's so hard to find a salad that every component part tastes amazing. I've been to countless places where I end up tossing the last 1/3 of the salad because they put crappy lettuce or other unacceptable quality in a salad.

1/22/2018 Our second bad/slow service visit to this location.  We have been here on previous visits and at other locations in Las Vegas.  We normally order the same thing so we know the normal wait times, portion sizes, etc.  This was two in a row with bad service.  We thought the first time was just a bad day or something?

Food came, visibly smaller portions.  They forgot the avocado on the salad.  They did bring some out after we pointed it out.

No ketchup on table.  Resorted to self serve at this point.  Went to a vacant table with a bottle, but that bottle was empty.  The next table I table I tried had a bottle with some in it.

Perhaps that lead to looking at other things.  We most likely will not return to this location....sadly since it is the most convenient.  Things we found unacceptable, that we have not run into at other FB's.

This encounter seemed to be the perfect storm.

(1)Inside order.  15 + minutes from order to table delivery.
(2)All available booths, the tables were not clean.  Person dropping off food didn't even notice ours was not clean.
(3)When food came we made a comment on portion size compared to other FB's.  Excuse was they were out of the normal size plates.  No offer to make anything right in another way.
(4)No Ketchup on table.  Self serve at this point.  Went to 1st vacant table, that ketchup was empty.  Found one with some on 2nd try.
(5)Forgot the avocado on the salad, had to ask for it.  Server had to go get it.
(6)Bathroom (men's at least) smelly and needed cleaned.

Pursuing this with a phoned in complaint at an area or district level (whatever they may call it).  The person that answered said it might take 48 hrs to get a response.  We are on day three, and no call back.  Had they made us feel this was important we may not have placed a review at all.

1/24/2018 We went to another FB location just to make sure it wasn't our imagination. We went to the FB at W Tropical Pkwy.  Inside order.  Ordered the same exact thing.  They were fairly busy so the above was not about hitting a busy spell. Served within 6 minutes.  Normal sized portions we are used to.  Ketchup was on the table, tables were clean, and clean bathrooms.  They got everything right.  They were the opposite end of the spectrum.

I wasted $18.00 for nothing... I returned my breakfast back to the kitchen 3, yes three times!! I didn't eat at all!!
Other Farmers Boys locations are much better than this one. Give yourself a favor and DON'T even think about coming over here!!

Burgers were what looked like the start for us..... I had the Original with Fries, my husband had thew Big Cheese with Onion Rings.
My burger was GREAT!!!  For me, this is exactly how I like a burger fresh meat, pattied by hand. Super soft fresh bun and just sauce, onion and pickle. I can taste the meat without it being so meat filled that I am eating the whole cow! (not a fan of two and three patties)
The fries were good, but the homemade onion rings were crazy!! Thick pieces of fresh cut onion..... I mean thick!! Battered and Fried Fresh.... Yay!!!
I can't wait to go back and try their breakfast menu, they use hash browns not chunks of potatoes..... HASH BROWNS in their breakfast burritos and breakfast bowls!",FEwPxhjdVKxSPVQQAHX2gg,2,1,4,7AWlPxiHqMHs87JlDLxciw

They gave me a burger which had onions and pickles which, I ordered with out!!!!! It was also missing the avocado!! Another 10 min wait while the probably scraped stuff off I didn't want I received my burger again missing the avocado. These people are incompetent and I will never go there again!! The dude at the register made these ladies wait 10 min. Before ordering cause he couldn't figure out why nothing was working since he put the paper in wrong lmfao!!

I was going to get lunch, it was going on noon, but last min decided on the 3 egg breakfast. It came with choice of bacon or sausage patties and hash browns with choice of toast. Hubby got a double cheeseburger of some kind with guacamole, and a side of chili cheese fries. You could get reg fries or zucchini fries as well:) We ate inside and it took about 7 min to get our order. The food was very good. And filling! They have a soda fountain so you can get refills yourself:) And the guy who helped us was super nice! He told us to ring the bell on our way out if we enjoyed our meal, and we did!

I bought the daily special, barbecue chicken wrap, comes with onion rings and a soda, (I chose water). 
My wrap was ok, bland a bit but for the price it's a decent sandwich. Onion rings were bland too. 
My buddies burgers were good. 
VERY friendly and professional staff. The customer walks up to counter to order which takes time after choosing a long table for us. No menus are available at the tables. 
It's a decent place but with so many restaurants available for lunch, I probably won't return but there is a good market at this price and location near dense population/day time business to be profitable.

I was told that I needed to download an app to recieve an instant $5 off my bill; so I did. After the download I was told that I can't use the app discount until I earn 60 app credits, plus it expires within 2 hours of the download. With my order I requested water to drink and was given a sippy cup to drink tap water from the soda dispenser but paid for bottled water...disgusting! I finally find a clean table for seating and there's a staff member seated at a table across from us (seating for 4) with 4 plates of food eating from all plates; with guests waiting for seating. A sad display of gluttony. Then in walks a lady with a dog roaming around people dining and climbing on chairs. I ask the gentleman behind the counter to speak to a manager he states that he would send her over. After another 15 minute wait I walk back to the counter; as he sees me coming he then tells the manager that I requested to speak with her. She apologized that he just spoke to her 5 seconds before I did. I explained the issues and requested to change my order from dine-in to to-go.
