I like the decor of the place and the fact that it's a great place for lunch that won't break the bank at the Bellagio. I had the tuna sandwich with wasabi mayo and my boyfriend had the foraged mushroom pesto pizza. I loved the tuna sandwich. My boyfriend liked the foraged mushroom pizza but thought they could have added a variety of fancy mushrooms to warrant the word ""foraged"" in the name and to make it taste better. There was only one type of mushroom in the pizza originally.  He brought up his suggestion to the manager there and she then had him speak to the chef.  We weren't sure if anything was going to be done about it but we found out today that they now have a variety of mushrooms in their foraged mushroom pesto pizza! It's good to know that the management really takes the patrons' suggestions to heart. Thus, the 5 star rating. We also appreciate the great customer service and the nice, clean environment of Snacks.",W-CgbYGYqAb_f4he--ED1A,0,0,5,EyzLUHxY9MVGYy4DziX0bA

I have had bad service,  but this last time takes the cake.. so,  I ordered a pepperoni pizza to go for my son ($30) at 10:30pm.. 30+ minutes later, I see the cook taking the pizza out of the oven,  then I see the pizza box sitting at the pass through and one of the counter guys grabs it,  heads to the counter area where the single slices are kept warm,  tosses some slices into the box, then my buzzer buzzes and I pick up the pizza. . Curious,  I open the box and discover that. . I wasnt given a whole pepperoni pizza.. somewhere between the pizza oven and the window,  1/3 of my pizza disappeared. .and the counter guy decided to slop in  random pizza slices to fill the gap. . Who does that? ? I'm paying $30 for a pizza and this guy not only doesn't give a crap,  but figures he can get away with it. . I asked to (once again) speak to the manager,  and she (once again) refunds my money.. my only conclusion is that since this place is right next to a night club full of drunk, hungry people,  they can get away with sleazy maneuvers, and nobody will notice. .. but. .

Newly remodeled and reopened a few weeks ago with the addition of a brick oven & updated menu. You order on tablets when you go in. It prints a ticket that you bring to the counter to pay & get your order. Only tried a couple of slices today... Margarita & carne. Although it was a big improvement from previous pizza they still need some work. The menu described the margarita pizza as having buffalo mozzarella & San Marzano sauce. None of that was on it. Not even traditional basil that's always on a margarita pizza. Basically plain mozzarella cheese. The carne was as described but nothing special. Both slices were overcooked..very crunchy... Seemed like if done right the crust would have been light & airy.  Slices are reasonable $6/$7. Whole pizzas around $30....which if I would have got the margarita liked they served, I would have sent it back.

M Life Military members: For those of us that served in the military almost every restaurant in the Bellagio gave us a 10% discount (it shows Military/Veteran on the M Life Card)

The food was good, we had a double burger with cheese wrapped in lettuce, a regular burger, and to drink one tea and an Adult Chata Shake.  Both burgers were good, I loved the Chata Shake, it was very convenient, and there was no need to make a reservation (it was just under $50 for 2 people).

We still ended up paying $32.xx for the snack fries with egg and buffalo wings and a soda (refillable), which is pricey in my book. But still its more reasonable than the other restaurants around.

The only reason why I'm giving them 4 stars and not 5 is how salty the wings and fries were. I found myself parched before I even ate and as I was eating, even more desperate for a gallon of water to balance my salt levels. Lol. 

But, flavor was absolutely delicious. They REALLY NEED TO CUT DOWN the SALT.

1538257,2016-04-15,1,APAsM2DPl9FH0sC6jFEaXQ,"I was actually pretty surprised with this place. Consider it's on the strip, at the Bellagio, and you're looking for something quick to eat and that won't cost an arm and a leg.  At snacks, it's not just candy bars and potato chip bags.  You have creative burger and pizza items alongside some pretty awesome french fry variations.

First, to save time, the menu selection is a touchable screen before you approach the cashier.  It gives you your options of what you would like to have included or removed from your item.  For example, a lot of the burgers come with it's specific ingredients to make for a pretty good burger.  For the socal burger, don't forget to include the kale which is part of the burger.  The combination of the chile and the kale with a unique bun make it a treat, a good treat.  The pizza is not your all time greatest pizza but it's much much better pizza than what you find at those mall pizza spots.  Ugh, I can't stand those!

Pricing? Much more affordable than stopping at any of the restaurants off the strip, especially among any of the other food spots at the Bellagio.

HIGHLY RECOMMEND, if you're at the Bellagio and you can't wait to go anywhere else or walk another half mile anywhere for food, and you want to save some money and make it quick so you can catch up with your spouse, friend, group, whatever, definitely stop by Snacks.  You can find it when facing the Bellagio, it's on the north side near Flamingo road and the valet by the casino and the fancy jewelry windows.

The salmon wasn't the best I've ever had, but the salad itself more than makes up for it. The sun dried tomatoes gave the salad a nice flavor, as did the crushed red pepper and Parmesan cheese available in individual packets at the condiment station.

Great alternative for those that are looking for a quick bite.

Once you get in there are 3 tablets on your right where you can order.  Those that are less tech savvy might take a little longer to navigate through the system but also finding where certain dishes are might take some time as well.  Once you have completed your order a receipt prints out with a bar code that they scan later on at the register.  After you pay they give you a pager and then in about 5-10 minutes later you'll get your food ready to go.  There aren't many tables in the restaurant area itself but it also depends on how busy it is.

The sandwiches are really good here.  I've tried the Big Tuna Burger as well as the Katsu (Chicken covered in panko) sandwich.  Can't go wrong with either.

Groups after us started getting their food and even once we asked about it, it still took over 30 min to get our food. We all just ordered breakfast sandwiches so they weren't even cooking anything.

We ordered 3 slices of pizza, 2 drinks and small fries, a total of $42 dollars. The pizza was extremely stale, cold to say the least and just ok. The sweet potato fries were dropping in oil. 

The ladies in the front not very customer service oriented. Maybe they were having a bad day......

Orders are automated, using a touchpad you can order just about anything on the menu. I was craving a burger, so that's what I got. I kinda went crazy and started clicking all kinds of options and upgrades just like a kid in a candy store. So after you place your order, all you do is go to the cashier and everything is rung up already, they are there just waiting to take your money. Our wait wasn't long at all, very efficient and packaged well. The self seating area isn't that big, so you may have to wait to swoop in. You gotta have a fast eye though, as soon as seats vacate, there are people ready to pounce. We got to our room and the burger was to die for. Very juicy, but not overly to where the bun gets soaked. Fries were crispy and the onion rings were huge. Definitely a pit stop on my next visit.",WnSF_-kTazxPASvxMKMIzw,0,0,5,N2ibK_cqImBiIgGUMGOS2Q

We expected it would be pricey due to Vegas strip prices.  The burger was a bit dried but not too salty.  It's passable.  Pizza was surprisingly better than we thought.  We had some ones where it feels like ketchup smothered on dough.  The kids ate decent enough to hold them over the show.",PtDQ5aoaG9EmDKT3gvOxWw,3,3,3,9g5zgrb7yyR8zGTqHjyFcw

I stopped for a quick breakfast ""snack"" and was absolutely delighted with ""the #1 Classic"" breakfast sandwich. This was really a breakfast burger with Nueske's bacon substituted for a beef patty. I gotta say, I never missed it. If you are from Wisconsin like I am, you know about Nueske's legendary bacon!Tons of melted cheese paired with a scrambled egg gave me all the protein I will need to lose my ass in the casinos later today. This might have been the best breakfast sandwich I've ever had, and I've had plenty. Prices are about what you would expect for the Bellagio: $10.49 for the sandwich and $4.49 for coffee. This is a nice little casual spot in. High end casino. They specialize in craft burgers here and it really shows in their breakfast sandwich!",GBqCVQup28CA4pUlZOFLJQ,2,4,4,wKx8DiQ9cGqpvN0fFOSi0g

It started out with us simply just wanting to grab a quick bite to eat before we start drinking. We stumbled upon this place and decided to try it out since it was close to our room. What a game-changing decision that was for us. 

The food was amazing. We had the Double Cheese Burger, Katsu Burger, Wings, Pork Belly Nachos, Onion Rings, and Snack Fries. I highly recommend the Katsu Burger. For only $12-$13, you get four healthy slices of chicken katsu that were perfectly fried between two toasted Brioche buns. I think I had about three of them in one weekend. The Snack Fries were a little too soggy for my taste with the all the gravy, melted cheese, and meat they put on there, but my buddies all enjoyed it very much. 

Definitely stop by here for a quick late night snack to fulfill your drunchies before heading up to your room. You won't regret it!",pWREFkomFNZ2Fad8V-5ASQ,2,0,5,jBAyErG6Urj06nRz7GnaAg

4823932,2016-12-22,2,APAsM2DPl9FH0sC6jFEaXQ,"Some hearty, fatty, late night snacks before heading up to our room for the night after the plane ride. But way overpriced for very mediocre quality food. $45 for a burger, hot dog, wings, and two slices of pizza Especially the pizza slices -- very small, thin, and lacked sauce and cheese. If the $9.50 burger came with fries, it would have been a slightly better deal, as well as the pizza being a little bigger/thicker and more decadent with more sauce/cheese. Paying for food is never a problem, but not for dinky little items. I will say that I thoroughly enjoyed the hot dog. A thicker hot dog, personally reminded me of the 1/4 lb. beef hot dogs from Wawa's, and a sturdy, toasted bun. 

Extremely nice workers, very pleasant and helpful. Have plenty of condiments available (mayo, ketchup, mustard), packets of relish, salt/peppers, napkins, and plastic utensils. 

Also love that you can order at the self- kiosks and pay for it at the register. 

Around 11:30 PM, it was pretty empty in there, so it was peaceful and quiet waiting for our food. A steady flow of people came to get food/dine- in, as it's the only 24 hour option I believe within the hotel (?) Cute lighting, lots of wooden tables, a wall of faux chalkboard writing, a bar seating that looks out into the casino, 

Definitely worth coming here for a quick late night snack, but I would personally only stick to a hot dog and maybe a chocolate shake.",Zohjr4ZPl76vryPqiQLJ4A,1,1,3,yD8te3CnJKG7MT1eh3dPtg

I got an order of wings and fries, which was ready in about five minutes. After the first bite I had to drink almost a whole bottle of water from how salty it was. I literally only took two more bites before just forgoing the entire dish. They literally must have dipped these wings in salt three times before serving it. I can't even tell you if the sauce was good because it was so salty I couldn't taste anything else.

I see no benefits of coming here unfortunately, unless it's the middle of the night, you're starving and need something quick to eat. If that's the case, grab a slice a pizza instead, which is also served here.",_muhtS8ZFnV61s7Q4JXDwQ,4,2,2,zGmJwELXJ4kv7D09YASqEw
