The Reset Project is filled with positive energy and highly motivated individuals. I highly recommend this monthly event to help refresh your mind & body. It is inspiring, relaxing and fun. It is a great way to recharge your battery and spend some time in rejuvenated downtown Las Vegas. 
Mr. James Wong has created a masterpiece. The Reset Project is well worth the money and time.",qRDvOYimOipPJFC6zmSBoQ,0,0,5,AtDWx_gWDY8BYTavrIkK7Q

My friend had told me about this a long time ago, but with my early onset of dementia, I swear I could never remember to sign up for this (kidding, I don't have dementia). Premise of this is to ""reset"" the mind, body and spirit and to motivate for a healthier community (who doesn't want that)? 

We started out by meeting at the Amanda Harris Art Gallery located right next door to the Lady Sylvia, we then broke into groups, one running a 5k and the other was a walking group lead by a gentlemen that gave a short history lesson on downtown. 

We then regrouped back at the gallery to do some stretching and yoga lead by an instructor from Blue Sky Yoga. There is a different guide each month, a fantastic yogi from a studio in town. Afterwards we heard a motivating short talk from Kelly Bennet who gave us ideas on goals to hit for the month ahead. Again, a different speaker every month, all have been really inspiring. 

To end the morning we were treated to a delicious healthy vegan meal made by Vegan Chef Donald (loved everything he served). 

Fantastic way to spend my morning. Early bird sign up is $10 and $25 day of. Thanks again to Lauren, Kelly, and Jennifer for being so gracious and welcoming today, can't wait to come back next month.",SfY0jEFqBkrqq9bVi6P31Q,7,8,5,OagFSTVsrOAAPuy6lNtT8Q

What do you do at Reset?  In a nutshell, move, stretch, reflect, eat.

Here's the breakdown of the three hours we spent with at least 40 other people:
  
Check in at Fremont East Studios (Las Vegas Blvd. at Ogden.)  We registered on-line ahead of time, which was $20 per person.  It's $30 at the door, but the event sold out so I recommend registering ahead of time.  We were directed to one of the rooms in the studio where people were laying out their yoga mats.  It's good we got there around 7:45am because the room filled up to capacity and supposedly there were 10 people who registered but didn't show up.  They definitely need a larger space to accommodate more participants.

MOVE:  After introductions by James and Kelly, who lead the Reset Project, participants chose whether they wanted to do a 5K run through DTLV led by chiropractor Dr. Donald Ozello or do a 2 mile ""urban hike"" led by Lululemon Fashion Show Mall key leader, Dione.  My friends and I plus three other ladies chose the 5K option.  By the time we got started, it was probably 8:15am and already warm for running, but we had a fun time being together and running around the Fremont Street area and the quieter neighborhoods at that time of day.  We never saw the urban hikers on the route we took so I'm curious enough to try that option the next time.

STRETCH:  When we got back from our run, everyone else was already back in the big room on their yoga mats.  We were then led through a short yoga session, maybe 30 minutes or less, by Joyce Sportsman.  It was nothing too advanced or grueling, so even yoga novices will do fine.  Bring your own mat if you have one, but they did have some there if you forget yours or don't have one.  

REFLECT:  The last part at the studio was a workshop by inspirational speaker Alexia Vernon, which focused on the day's theme of ""home.""  She spoke to us about her life story, including the personal challenges she's had as a new mother.  She was funny, interesting, and dynamic, tying the theme in with her own life experiences and then encouraging us to find our own figurative ways home if we've felt lost or alienated in our personal or professional lives, or both.

EAT:  Before we left the studio for brunch (around 10:00am), there were some items raffled off and the best part was that Suzy H. won a $25 gift card to VegeNation--woot!  That's where we ended our morning, too.  After taking a few group pictures in the studio, we all headed out on foot to VegeNation on Carson.  Waiting for us there was a brunch buffet that included fresh fruit, breakfast potatoes, veggie wraps, and scrambled eggs.  I'd never been to the restaurant before and I was pleasantly surprised at how nice it was inside.  I'd definitely go back to try some of their menu items.

Overall, this was an excellent way to spend a Sunday morning with two of my closest friends.  I'd highly recommend it for anyone who wants to recharge in the way described above and to try something different and unique right in our own community. Reset happens the first Sunday of every month.  Just remember to register on-line, get to the studio early to get a spot on the floor, bring water, a yoga mat, a towel, and get ready to reset.

*July's Reset is scheduled for July 5th, 2015, the theme is 'creativity' and yoga will be led by Jada Fire, co-founder of Barefoot Sanctuary.  The 5K or urban hike options are the same as well as the VegeNation brunch to end the morning.  Namaste!",7Oe6ikklTjVBbEFw9emLcA,8,7,5,L6bsRVHrJeOHtSpr31eWLA
