This place is pretty yummy. They have really good service. Very friendly. ABSOLUTELY LOVE their vibe the place gives off. Hawaiian music, very chill and gets pretty busy at night too. 
As far as fish goes ORDER THE 808 TUNA SALAD! Really tasty.

If youre comming here for all you can eat, I dont really recommend here. I was turned off when I found out they give time limits and only cetain sushi for it. So I'd rather go to Sushi Factory on Eastern. DONT GO TO THE ONE ON TROPICANA, its gross there. 

Also they have a conjointed hawaiian food place. Awesome malasadas!",Cu4Wj1Sd7OJHFzZb9eHjHw,0,0,4,B6Fig1KbLT-AGXYZfz1Y7Q

We placed our original order (All You Can Eat) and  waited 20 minutes or so to receive it. Half of our order was brought out and watched as people came in after us starting receiving food we initially ordered. We asked the waiter but he didn't seem to care & never brought us the rest of our food. One person in our party received two items he ordered and that was it. We spoke to the Manager (Jesus) about the horrible service and he offered a 10% discount off ONE dinner, what an insult to us. I definitely wouldn't recommend this restaurant to anyone that is looking for good food and service. why would you insult your customer, instead of making it right and fixing the situation.

The nigiri had a big piece of raw fish over a small little nugget of rice (How sushi SHOULD be!)

Their plate lunches are winnahz too! I've gotten their saba and laulau plate before. They also have these bentos that come with choice of garlic or mochiko chicken and comes with garlic ahi, spam, rice and fried noodles!! All for $8. That beats Zippy's zip & surf pac anyday!!

Servers were friendly but we were neglected as soon as it got busy and they forgot a few things we ordered. This maybe a problem for people since there is a 90min limit on AYCE sushi.   

Now for the food:

Ahi Poke, 5 Star
Fresh tasting with good color. 

Garlic Chicken, 5 Star
Juicy and flavorful. 

Macaroni Salad, 1 Star
It was too salty and eggy for my taste.

Fried Oysters, 2.5 Star
On the burnt side losing the taste of the oyster. See my pic.

Sushi (Variety), 2.5 Star
The taste and fresh color of the fish was not there, the presentation looked slapped together, rushed and mushy. Blah.

808 Special, 2.5 Star
Nothing too special about a fried banana, vanilla ice cream, whip cream. It was just bland.

Malasada Sundae, 2.5 Star
The malasada tasted old and hard. Vanilla ice cream and whip cream didn't do anything for it, either. Bland.

The drinks were on the bigger side which does not merit stars but definitely appreciated.

The sushi is small and the spider roll that i order had a really strong fishy taste to it which is not normal. So that really brought it down another star.

Service was not good at all. There were only two sushi chefs and not alot of people, it took forever for the sushi to come out. The waitresses didn't even come by once to fill our water or anything.

Our waitress wouldn't even come near us or make eye contact with us during that 40 minutes, while we were trying to get her attention to find out what was going on.

The Ahi poke bowl is just the right mix of spices and shoyu.  They also have a wide variety of flavors line wasabi ahi, furikake ahi poke, spicy avocado poke, salmon poke and even kimchee raw crab!  

I also had the salmon skin bowl and that did not disappoint.  The salmon skin was crispy and just the right amount of saltiness.  Most salmon skin I've had were rubbery and hard to chew.  

Lastly the malasadas are right on point.  I love haupia and they can fill the malasadas with vanilla chocolate and haupia filling.  Almost as good as Leonard's.

The fish selection are great here too.  They are fresh and delicious.  What I like to order here are not just the egglants fries, but the crab tako.  I can chow down three order of these because the sauce and the raw crab goes so well together.  

For dessert, we only get one order per person, so I typically chose wisely.  I would get the malasada if it was fresh, and not just a lump of stale dough.  If I asked and it has been sitting since earlier that day, I would default to the brownie and scoop of ice cream.

Overall, I am a fan and will return.  They also have a AYCE brunch menu that includes item like King's Hawaiian bread french toast, and other interesting items.  Check it out if you have not done so!",2wyP8DL1isAG-6ApKbvDSw,1,0,4,B3pskftfTw3odaqfAK8ahQ

On to the Nigri sushi all fresh and perfectly made: hamachi, yellowtail, Cajun albacore, ebi, amaebi, salmon skin hand roll.....whole lotta goodness in just two entrees.

593251,2009-06-30,2,DzKl51tivGJMLiNsQqf38w,"You bet your ass I gave this place five stars! Whoo hoo! ""QOQ"" will be the main focus of this review. You know, quality over quantity or vice versa? Well, this place can go either way. All-You-Can-Eat Sushi for $24.95 along with $2 Sake Bombs, ALLLLLL DAYYYYY, sounds like a win-win situation in my case! 

A few warnings before we get down to the nitty gritty part of my review:
-A 90 minute time limit to the AYCE goodness (NOOOOOO!)
-A surcharge for wasting food
-Only one order of Uni and Sweet Shrimp per person

So, the food: 
- The Uni: My first time having it, but I'm sure they did it right because the sweetness of the Sea Urchin and the gooey goodness made me want more than just two rolls. Yummy!
- Garlic Chicken: flavor overload in my mouth! Couldn't get enough of this.
- Ahi Poki: FRESH FRESH FRESH TUNA! It almost felt as if the fish were swimming in my mouth.
- Tempura Philly Roll: Fried. Cream Cheese. Fresh Salmon. I can't ask for a better combination.

All their sushi is extremely fresh and they do sushi right. Make sure you order accordingly because they will charge your ass for leftovers. For dessert, make sure you get the ""808 Special"", tempura-battered bananas and strawberries topped with a scoop of vanilla ice cream with a dallop of whipped cream. *drools. 

With a party of 14, the service was exceptional. Our waitress kept us happy with our Sake Bombs and kept up with our nonstop demands for food.

They, also, have a pretty decent ""Happy Hour"", which consists of $1.50 Small Beers and $3.00 Big Beers. So, order a Big Beer and a round of Sake and you've got yourself set for about 10 Sake Bombs! Yes!

So, we walked into this place starving and left this place with our bellies full. We didn't even wanna walk the Strip, we just wanted go back to our hotel rooms and pass out.

600039,2010-05-12,0,DzKl51tivGJMLiNsQqf38w,"My wife and I went there for dinner and had the AYCE sushi. The service was great. The waiters and waitresses were friendly. The sushi chefs were easy going. We sat at the counter on a night with not a lot of customers and the food came out promptly. 

Now the bad news. The sushi quality was not good... but i guess you can't complain if it's ayce? The cooked food was good but it was very filling so I don't recommend it if you are on the AYCE plan.

Another problem was that they used the ""ajitsuke"" nori (the sweet and spicy flavored nori) for the Uni sushi. I don't know if this is ""hawaiian style"" or they were just plain lazy, but this is the only sushi restaurant that I have been to that uses ajitsuke nori for their ""gunkan"" sushi. And because of the flavor in the nori, it killed the flavor in the uni. 

The presentation of the sushi was not like other sushi places too, in a bad way... Even I could probably cut the fish the way the chefs did. It didn't affect the taste, but come on!, they should've taken better sushi-making lessons before they started working behind the counter.

The orders were not brought out in the order that it was taken.  4 or 5 people who had ordered after us received their orders well before we did and it's not like we had a huge order.  The woman in front of us had ordered some sort of crab dish and it was incorrect so they had to redo the order, because her dish was cheaper.  Why not just eat the cost and give her the order?

My cousin asked if they had a roll with strawberries and they didnt, but about 10 minutes later the owner and sushi chef cam and asked what she was looking for. He custom made a roll for her.  We were all doing the all you can eat (I highly recc it), so to go out of his way to make a special roll even though we weren't paying more for us--was way too generous and was the icing on the cake.

During my last visit, the service was dreadful.  They were very understaffed (so, not really the waitstaff's problem) which translated into an annoying ordeal just to get our order taken, water refilled, or our food.  C+

Unfortunately, the food did not make up for the service.  We ordered the salmon sashimi with orgasm sauce ($8).  The salmon was drenched in the mayonnaise-based dressing and, even then, under all that crap, I could tell it wasn't the freshest fish.  Pass.

We also ordered the Joe's Special and Maui Wowie rolls.  I enjoyed the Maui Wowie (shrimp tempura, eel, avocado) but the Joe's Special was pretty underwhelming.  Also, once again, I wasn't impressed with the quality of the fish.  Maybe I was there on a bad day?

The only redeeming quality of our meal was the malasada sundae.  I really enjoyed the fresh malasada (portugese donut), vanilla ice cream, and guava sauce. However, I would not endure another dining experience here just for this dessert.  Which, is a shame, because it's delicious.

A couple was seated 15 minutes AFTER us, got their food, ate, paid their bill and left before we received the rest of our order.  It was mochiko chicken, and other than being a little overcooked, it was delicious.  We then waited another 20 min after completely finishing our meal for our waitress to come back and get our order for dessert (which was included in the price of the meal I ordered) There were only 4 other tables occupied at this point....and at least 2 other wait staff.  This was a very insulting experience.  I can understand mistakes when a waitress is very busy, but being obviously ignored when she only had one other table was just too much.  I skipped dessert and just got the check.  To his credit, the man who took our drink orders ran to get us malasadas to go, which is the only reason I'm giving 2 stars.  Our waitress was nowhere to be seen and didn't apologize for the poor service once.  We spent nearly 2 hours there, and she spoke to us a total of 4 times.

For an AYCE, this is one of the better ones I've experienced.  Very extended menu for AYCE.  Included a wide array of appetizers, sushi, rolls, and desserts.  Only thing is that there are a few item which allowed 1 per person.  This was Uni, Amaebi, seared Ahi Toro, Hamachi Kama (large size, not small), Tako kim-chee, couple of rolls, and some other items. This place is where you ordefrfrom a menu , not a buffett line. Food is freshly made upon order.

Over all, it wasn't bad.  The uni was surprisingly fresh.  Amaebi...tolerable.  Other fish items, not bad...not the best quality, but again, this is AYCE.  It also included some dessert, 808 special...good. So was the malsadas and creme brulee.  Best to order one of each to share.

Of the 5 of us who ordered AYCE, we definitely got our moneys worth.  Better than the AYCE places here in LA (Joe's Sushi, todai).

The meat was so salty I almost choked! If I wasn't starving from a long hike and drove 30 min to try it, I would have sent it back. The manager never bothered to come out and say anything to me personally but instead just stood behind the counter giving me dirty looks. The reason this place gets two stars is because the Poke I ordered in the back was fairly good.  The cook should get dirty lickens or maybe the owner should for allowing them to serve the plate lunches as Hawaiian food.

I've been to Island Sushi many times and think that it's the best AYCE sushi spot in vegas but I had never tried the grill side.  Tried it once and will never be back.

I got the bento with garlic ahi and mochiko chicken.  The ahi was over cooked beyond belief...dry as a cardboard and no garlic taste at all.  The mochiko chicken was soggy and tasted old.  The fried noodles that came with the bento was just that...fried noodles.  Not one green onion, onion, kamaboko, char siu...nothing.  The best thing in that bento was the spam.

The wife got the lau lau.  Horrible...dry and no taste at all.  It was like they didnt add any salt and the leaves were not moist at all either.  Came with lomi lomi salmon but no mac salad?! Blasphemy! 

I'll be back to the sushi side but never again to the grill side.  Its sad cause I hear so many local peeps raving about this place.  If this is what theyre raving about, I need to open up my own plate lunch / bento spot and show these guys how its done!

Beautiful. 
Sarie had a few rolls, loving every bite. She did the classic Sarie rolls (California, Spicy Tuna). What can I say, she knows what she likes...
The service is always crazy good. This time we were laughing at our girl's description of the size of the mochi balls. God bless! ('I've had bigger balls' she tells me)

Not at Island Sushi! For $20.99 at lunch ($24.95 for dinner), you get a large selection of rolls, nigiri, appetizers, and even desserts.  I mostly avoided the apps (ordered a miso soup and edamame), and stuck with the nigiri.  The fish was fresh and tasty, and the quality was just as good for the most part of some of the fancier sushi joints I have tried around the country.  If you come hungry, you definitely get you money's worth without sacrificing quality.

The atmosphere leaves a bit to be desired, as its in a strip mall and seating area is just cheap tables and chairs.  If you want a fancy dining experience, this is not the place.  I was by myself for lunch and the sushi bar has a small flatscreen TV to watch while I stuffed myself.  They also do quite a few happy hour type specials on rolls and sake bombs throughout the week if you aren't in the AYCE mood.  For your non-raw fish eating friends, the other half of the restrauant has a pretty extensive cooked Hawaiian menu.  However, I don't forsee myself trying that anytime soon.

I stopped by after getting my lashes and brows done because personal maintenance makes me hungry apparently.

Trust me, I am not that familiar with Island food although people think I am fully literate on this cuisine because I look Hawaiian or something like that. I do know what I like when it comes to certain Island cuisine and that is when the Island girl makes a guest appearance.

So on my visit, I decided to order the Spam Misubi which I never had until I moved to Vegas. I am not a connoisseur but I have eaten great ones and ones that I felt like saying ""I will never eat this again!"".  The Spam Misubi at Island Sushi was one of the great ones. It was warm and tightly wrapped and so yummy-yummy. I do love spam and rice, I am Fil-Am so I know it is in the DNA.

I also ordered the Specialty fried noodles with Spam and BAM, so spot on!! It tasted like the pansit my mother used to make once or twice a year for special occasions. It truly tasted like something from an Island Mother's kitchen or at least a Fil-Am mother who threw down Grilled Cheese sandwiches in front of me and Fil-food on some annual occasion.

The Poke Express was def. different for me. Never ordered ahi poke to go like that.  We ordered a quarter lb of the poke furikake, hawaiian, and the spicy poke. Decent priced.
 
We also ordered to go... the teriyaki beef with noodle combo & the garlic chicken combo. I kinda felt like i should have asked, ""can i have some beef with my noodles?"" Don't get me wrong, the noodles were good, but I felt like there was just not enough beef.... or chicken.

The staff at the Poke Express area was very very nice. But the rest of the staff behind the grill and register are kinda rude and snoody. And from reading other reviews, it seems like these people have good days and bad days. Word of advice for those moody people.... please leave your bad attitude at home.

I ordered my food for delivery and I'm so stoked to be enjoying this from my house but I cannot wait to dine in! 

I ordered the oxtail soup because I saw it being raved about in the comments and trust me, the comments are REAL about this dish!! Even though I had it delivered, when I got it it was still nice and hot. They even wrapped the containers in Saran Wrap to make sure nothing spills!! I opened my container and holy, it smelled delicious. I saw 2-3 big and fatty pieces of oxtail. The cilantro and ginger came separately which I appreciated because I don't eat cilantro aha. It comes with 2 scoops of rice which tastes delicious with the soup. 

I also got a side of kalbi. It's around 5 individual bone pieces. A little bit pricey imo but the flavor is really good. I'm addicted to rice so I can eat one piece with one bowl lol.

The malasada w custard is freaking BOMB. I only got one since I've never tried. But the custard is like the ones they put in asian bread and it was soft and chewy and came in it's own box.

***THIS PLACE IS NO LONGER POKE EXPRESS***
First off, shame on you guys for taking down the sign that Poke Express moved to a different location.  A lot of old customers does not know (including myself) that Poke Express is no longer there.  Walked in thinking it was still Poke Express.  Quality and Service was horrible.

I order some poke along with a side of rice.  My order was just sitting there while the lady behind the counter catered to new customers.  My order came out after my friends order (he ordered a poke bowl), which he had placed after me.  How hard is it to scoop some poke and rice then have a customer pay for the damn thing instead of just having it sit there? It took 20 minutes for me to get my order.

The lady (sorry), which looked and sound like a man had some major attitude.  No smile what so ever.  We're from LA and we always order a ton of poke to bring back home.  We ordered a ton of Poke to bring back home and felt robbed. 


I found it ""fishy"" after tasting the quality of the poke and also the amount of time it took to get our order, that this was no longer Poke Express.  I had to yelp to find out they had moved.  Eventually went to the new location in which they had advise us Island Sushi took down their sign that they moved.  Basically taking over their business making it seem like it was still Poke Express without anyone knowing.  Shameful.

Please be aware and stay away!!!",hpXchFLOX-BUNKAkE5QN2g,3,0,1,elFGVd5DKo39sL-mb0QeVw

Simply our favorite sushi place in the coun-tray! We had the lunch for two all you can eat. I do really appreciate and respect all the rules laid out for the all you can eat. The owners want you to value and respect all food and not throw any of it away. So, if you are going to eat. You better eat it all and within an acceptable time.

1448188,2014-08-24,0,DzKl51tivGJMLiNsQqf38w,"Disclaimer: I am from Hawaii and love ""local"" (read: non-traditional) sushi!

I have only been in Las Vegas for about three months now, but Island Sushi is my ABSOLUTE FAVORITE restaurant so far!  

I always go for dinner and have never waited longer than ten minutes for two people to be seated without reservations!  However, with a bigger group, reservations are recommended.  I always opt for all-you-can-eat sushi, which is $26.95 for dinner.  It's worth it for me because after you eat a couple of rolls, you end up saving money.  However, I know not everyone has my appetite...

What's great about this restaurant is that the sushi is not overloaded with rice, HOWEVER, most orders come with about eight large pieces of sushi.  The value is there because there is a fair amount of filling and toppings, but you may be surprised with the size/amount that comes in one order!  This is the only downside.

I typically order: California Deep Fried Roll, Island Special Roll, Poke Roll, Spam Roll, and the Town & Country Roll.  Yes, all at one time.  Yes, I get my money's worth.  Yes, I gain ten pounds immediately and roll myself home.  All of them are fresh, delicious, and feature a wonderful array of flavors that complement each other perfectly (e.g. sweet, spicy, salty - yum).

Beware that they do charge $2 per piece that you do not finish.  The strategy I found to have worked best is to order everything you think you want to eat at once.  If you wait to think about it, there could be a delay in your order, and once that food begins to settle... defeat is inevitable.  If I order the aforementioned all at once (read: 40 large pieces of sushi), I am able to finish it once I get on a roll (pun intended).  Also, remember to follow-up on your rolls!  Once they didn't bring a roll that I forgot about until the end, and I was so overwhelmed.

As for dessert, I always have the 808 Special!   I just love tempura banana - something I have never had before!  My friend had the tempura ice cream, but we both agreed it wasn't as flavorful.

If you're looking for a Hawaii-feel, the ambiance is great! I believe they play KWXX radio (read: Hawaiian/local music), and everyone is extremely friendly.  I know there's a take-out portion of this restaurant as well with plate lunches, poke bowls, and the like, but I have not tried that yet.

1448799,2015-08-28,0,DzKl51tivGJMLiNsQqf38w,"Not bad. Over ordered for lunch but have some snacks for later. Good flavor, but not as refined as some other local sushi places. Definite Island style. Especially liked Mickey's rice, a genuine Da Kine comfort food. AYCE prices for dinner are pretty competitive. Will try again. Service could be just a little more responsive. Not really too bad, but the wait staff could be a little more tuned in the customers' needs. Only thing that kept me from grading 4 stars. So 3.5 stars would be a more accurate rating. 

There are two parts to Island Sushi. One side of the business is a sit down sushi and grill joint with well spaced tables and a sushi bar. The other side is primarily a take out ""Poke Express"" that serves up different varieties of poke and other goodies, think Island Style small plates. We only tried the lunch time a la carte sushi side. Definitely will try the Island Style take out on a different occasion. If we can find some taro chips to go with the poke, it will be like the Princeville grocery on the north coast of Kauai. Looking forward to checking out Poke Express. 

One tip if you plan to go. Parking is not good. Island Sushi is in an Eastern Ave strip mall with inadequate parking. Quite a few of the spaces are marked ""30 mins only"" and ""15 mins only"". We just had to ignore that and parked in a 30 minute spot. Another parking anomaly is that the handicapped parking was at the back of the parking lot. Never saw that before. Regardless, solving the parking dilemma is worth the trip.",gNTWnKqdsub0uYjQhb9PxQ,3,0,3,LgZxXynswmRRjeZa5wgdBQ

She said it was really popular...so I did. It was yummy. The spam is fried like chicken katsu before it is rolled in the seaweed. It's more heavy than the regular spam...so I'm going to stick with the basics but I appreciated the suggestion! Prices seem low, which is an added bonus! 

The people working here have always been friendly. I also noticed it's busy, so that's a good sign! One night I went in for sushi and there was a 45 minute wait. The sushi side of the restaurant is extremely small and it was packed! The other side of the restaurant (when you first walk in) is for non sushi items and it was busy as well. I think this is always a good sign, especially in this random little strip mall. The sushi was decent, not great. I will stick to the other menu items.

My favorites are the spam musubi, which is usually why I go here! Most times, I place a to go order for just this. I have also tried to kalbi ribs and teriyaki chicken, they are pretty good.

My husband and I have been coming for years and usually sit at the sushi bar which has always been great. This time we sat at the tables and not 1 employee out of probably 6 didn't even acknowledge us. We stood there for a solid 8 mins with no word from any employee! 

After we got seated, took another 10 mins for our waitress to come to the table. She finally came over took our orders for all you can eat. My husband only likes California rolls and is from Maryland and loves crab! The crab was so filled with mayo it was terrible! We ended up eating everything cause we were starved besides maybe 3 pieces of one of my rolls that had imitation crab in it. I picked around it. 

Server came back and said she would charge us $2 each piece because everything needs to be consumed not just parts of it. Listen I get it, but when it's full of mayo and doesn't taste good (which I told the server) you should prob just take the $6 off the bill as a gesture and not try and argue with us. The female ""manager"" came back with our check (which had the $6 charge on it) and said there's nothing she can do because it's the owners who implement that rule. My husband and I both work in hospitality and thinks it's crazy that not only wouldn't she take off the charge she laugh at us! At that point I couldn't even talk I had to walk out and left my husband to just pay the check and leave.

It was definitely our fault for not saying something about the taste of the crab in the first place.. But everything that happened tonight I will never go back and I will make sure to tell my friends about what poor ""laughing"" customer service they provide. Well you got your $6 bucks!

It's pretty ridiculous how much I enjoyed their sushi.  We decided to try them for lunch since it was recommended by friends. The right side of the restaurant opens at 11:30.  We chose to sit at the sushi counter in front of chef Jason.  He was friendly and quick in preparation.  We had a great lunch thanks to him! 

Since they have AYCE, it worked best for us to try several different creations.  Jason suggested the Hamachi which is yellowtail.  In the first bite there was a unique flavor.  We asked him what it was.  They combine orange and lemon into the yellowtail for this distinct flavor.  We immediately loved it.  

The 007 was our second choice.  Crab and cucumber topped with shrimp, avocado and eel sauce certainly made this a winner.  

The Island Special with soft shell crab topped with spicy tuna, spicy aioli and eel sauce did not disappoint.  Incredible flavors from each roll this far! 

The cherry on top was our final order of the Baked Salmon.  This is a California roll topped with cream cheese, salmon and dynamite.  It just melted in your mouth.

My favorites are the Island Special Roll and Spicy Mexican. Their garlic edemame is super delicious. Also they have these amazing noodles when you order from the Hawaiian part of the menu, they are so yummy.

I've eaten next door multiple times for the Hawaiian food and came with friends to get poke but never got around trying the AYCE here..

Looks run down and outdated which had me iffy about the place before .. But it was the closes sushi joint from the gym so I gave them a chance.

We ordered..
Puhi Maki Roll (daily special) - spicy soft shell crab, assorted fish on top with garlic ponzu sauce (Very Tasty!)
Salmon Skin Handrolls - crispy salmon skin, just enough sauce and not too much rice wrapped in seaweed (DELICIOUS!)
Raw Crab Poke - fiancé got this, looked appetizing and plentiful but I wasn't daring enough to try it..
Eggplant Fries - crispy, sliced, battered eggplant came with Spicy Miso Sauce, which I think didn't really compliment it, but I'm one who doesn't really care for dipping sauces.
Baked Salmon Roll - it was good but nothing special about it, loved that it didn't have so much rice nor cheese on top! 
Tofu Poke - so simple, yet sooo good! Fried tofu in their poke sauce with onions! (SOOO GOOD! Lol)
Malasada Sundae - the malasada (aka Hawaiian donut) tasted like cardboard, was dry and seemed like it's been sitting there for days.. Strawberries were sweet and the vanilla ice cream.. Was just ice cream.. Not a fan.

Sushi chefs were attentive but the waiters/waitresses were not.. Service was slow from the waiters, i.e. took almost an hour to get my eggplant fries.. Bit of a turn off..

Overall satisfied with my meal and will def come back for the salmon skin handroll and tofu poke!",-C-l8EHSLXtZZVfUAUhsPA,9,8,4,FjhQ81mGYnmXAsuAfEytkA

1650129,2013-03-07,3,DzKl51tivGJMLiNsQqf38w,"This review is for the sushi portion of dinner. The restaurant is located on Eastern past Serene, but before Richmar. If you get up to BJs, you've gone too far. Inside of the restaurant is sectioned off in to two areas. Entrance area seems to be designated for traditional Hawaiian grilled dishes, and the area thru the door on the right is the sit down sushi area. We came here on a Friday night and it was packed. They do have a wide selection of AYCE sushi and many sides to choose from (although the sides appear to be half of what you'd get if you were ordering a la carte).

The AYCE menu has two symbols that denote different things. Chopsticks next to the item indicate it is a dinner only item, while the sushi icon indicates it is one order per person.  The rolls were fine and fish relatively fresh. One thing to note is their speciality rolls were in fact not drenched in Yum sauce or mayo concoctions of any sort. A lot of what we ordered had their garlic sauce on the roll itself, and I wasn't a fan. It tasted like gin ...I know strange.  

We sample several rolls: Joe's Special, Black Widow, Spicy Mexican, Lava Lover, Lasagna, Surf and Turf. I also had their scallop mayo and salmon nigiri. The salmon was fresh, the scallop mayo was very bland and forgettable. My favorite roll of the group was Spicy Mexican, the rest were decent, but nothing I would rush to eat again.

The service was fine, minus the initial hiccup. It took a little over 20 minutes to get our first three rolls to the table. I know that it wasn't our servers fault, and it was pretty packed in there. They didn't bring it out roll by roll so we had food coming throughout, instead they waited for all rolls to be made before they brought them out. I guess it makes more sense that way, especially with being so packed.  So although, famished by the time we got the food, I won't hold it against them.

I would recommend this place is you want more simple, non yum sauce heavy rolls with fresh fish and friendly service.",7tpZVkiYuMbDP4-NufK2Iw,7,3,4,MAiPA7tiSMS6qcQSSa6zGQ
1661555,2011-04-04,0,DzKl51tivGJMLiNsQqf38w,"Pretty decent to get your AYCE sushi fix. My fiance and I ate by the sushi bar and based off the random rolls and nigiri pieces we picked out, I thought this place was ""ok"" as I judge my sushi by quality over quantity. (Though, I will say, it is expected that quality does go slightly down in an AYCE sushi place compared on one that isn't AYCE so my opinion might not be too fair.)

Finishing off my meal with the 808 dessert was quite a treat. The service didn't stand out to me and the inside of the restaurant doesn't appear to be anything special either. 

On one last note, I do order breakfast with Island Sushi more frequently than I do sushi and love their menu. I usually order a two egg plate and malasadas. Their malasadas are made to order. I thought their malasadas are ""ok"" as well; it tastes too dense for me and the custard filled one kinda tastes like instant jello pudding mix.",j0vDYYFE2eNvjm5NXHFmbA,1,1,3,dYe4czVetAibgw_PacxnFg

I recommend the ahi poke, joe's special roll and some Teri beef! Make sure not to skip out on dessert. Get the 808 special with tempura bananas! Staff is also amazing.

This restaurant is not buffet style but continuously ordering food from the menu style. The sushi here is really fresh, the food is great, and the service is awesome too. When I came here, the waiter even gave me a discount too because the sushi was taking a bit longer than usual to come out from the kitchen since the place was packed and the kitchen was a bit backed up. They even have my favorite chuka seaweed salad here too which you can order as much as you want.

Keep in mind there is a time limit on how long you can eat. I think it was 1.5 hours but I'm not sure if they will enforce it or not. Also, you can only have 1 order per person for the sweet shrimp and uni sushi.

Today I went here thinking I would get fresh poke just like the north location and just like every other time I came here. Unfortunately there was a big change and I didn't realize Poke Express was no longer there. It looks exactly like Poke Express same setup and all,  but according to Yelp they moved? I got a poke bowl. The employee helping me was already wearing a glove when he came up to me to ask what I would like to order. I noticed him sweating, which always grosses me out because that means sweat has to be wiped and it is usually with a hand or arm. Gross. I ordered by bowl and he used the hand with the glove to make the poke bowl packing in the lettuce multiple times with that gloved hand. Later he took my cash with that same hand with the glove. I sat down and saw he still had on the glove and began to wipe down the area where food was being served. Then he proceeded to take a woman's order after me using that same glove that touched money, a dirty rag, and who knows what else! So disgusting! I am highly disappointed because Poke Express was my go to poke spot when I wanted poke that reminded me of Hawaii. It appears this poke spot is in the same location but the owner is the same for the whole store. I asked someone at the front and they confirmed it is not a different business. I called and spoke to a manager after and he said he would talk to the guy and that he is new but honestly there is no excuse.

1676004,2014-12-09,0,DzKl51tivGJMLiNsQqf38w,"Went to eat here with my family which is a big group.  We decided to get separate checks to keep it easier for both the staff and us.   The food came out relatively quickly but we had no way of remembering who ordered what (as is common with big sushi orders).  My end of the table continually received tons of sushi to the point where we asked if it was a mistake.  The server kept saying that this was what we ordered even after suggesting several times that perhaps it was for the other end of our large party who hadn't received most of the sushi they had ordered.  Since there is a time limit and a per piece charge for uneaten sushi we cancelled the remaining order for our end of the table.  
Meanwhile, the other end of the table had only received one of the rolls out of the 5-6 they had ordered.  When it was brought to the servers attention, she said that it was coming.....but still didn't put it together that our end of the table had gotten way more than we ordered.  
So, long story short, the owner came out and pretty much said ""too bad"" and that they could order more since it was all you can eat...  We were already past the 90 minute limit and most of the party was done eating.  Reality is that they were just unaccommodating.  The sushi was fine and the price was right...but I felt bad that some of our party left hungry and they still paid the same amount as the rest of us who were full of sushi.",jevMic231sgdCVvJCnNJEQ,2,0,2,70mXPD-Qfz0bvWLd2iqQrw
1676888,2014-07-29,2,DzKl51tivGJMLiNsQqf38w,"I knew about Island Sushi and Grill because I order from their Poke Express every time I am in Vegas.  In addition to the poke I would order, I would sometimes order from the grill:

 - Katsu musubi:  the spam is breaded with the same breading they use for chicken katsu.  Adds a yummy crunch to the block of delicious goodness that is spam, rice and sauce.  
-  Goteburg musubi - The portuguese sausage also with rice. Yum!
-  Malasadas - like a creme filled donut.  

Ive recently also had them cater my sister's bachelorette party which was held at the Vdara.  Their catering menu is available online.  I ordered a small tray (feeds about 10-15 people) each of the:   
-  kalbi ($70):  good quality beef perfectly grilled. No sogginess or rubberiness.
-  chicken katsu ($36):  Still even crunchy after it was delivered. 
-  garlic chicken ($36) :  So simple yet so flavorful
-  mac salad ($24) and rice ($17): must haves when ordering Hawaiian food.

I also ordered 6 pounds of the amazing poke.  My order was delivered to the hotel at the time I had requested and without any issues.  I received a call when they were on their way and when the food arrived at the hotel.  The poke was delivered on ice.

Everything was delicious - as expected - and a big hit with the ladies.  I was a bit nervous that it would be too much food for 14 girls, but the small trays turned out to be the perfect amount.  We had enough for dinner, for a late night meal after hitting the club, and even for breakfast!

The atmosphere/decor is pretty basic. We saw tonight , which I now see is true of a couple of nights, all cut rolls were half price. So, we ordered away. All in all, did not find it that compelling.

Their ahi poke is good, and it's nice that it comes with AYCE (one dish).  I'm extremely picky with it comes to poke (my Hawaiian pop makes some that is out of this world), but I would recommend it to others.

What gets me right in my sweet spot is their tempura ice cream.  Oh man, is it delicious.  The batter is just the right amount of sweetness, density and melt-in-your-mouth flavor that can make you want to eat 6 bowls of it.

Service can be hit or miss, sometimes slow and sometimes not.  Food is consistently tasty though, so I'll lean towards a 4/5 on this one.",N5URmpyygDBSC_8UShI_6Q,0,1,4,NRaAWULsIrq8QothAqfNEw

The AYCE sushi is the way that most people go but I never have enough of an appetite so on Mon-Wed I come for the 50% off rolls deal that they offer to locals.  It's a steal and is usually a better deal for someone like me who only gets 2-3 rolls max.  Only beef is that they don't do half rolls, which a lot of AYCE places will do to allow you to try more options.  I highly recommend the kahuku roll (topped with orgasm sauce) and the town and country roll (cali roll with garlic chicken on top).  I also love the lava lover for something spicy.

What I like most is that they don't skimp on fish quality and they don't pile on the rice, even when we do the AYCE.  Plus they have the most extensive AYCE menu out there to include all of their amazing side items--poke, cucumber salad, teri chicken, etc.

If you happen to be in the area on a Sunday and want a great brunch, head to Island Sushi.  They have all you can eat AND all you can drink mimosas.

Now this was about a week and a half ago and we wanted to try it again!!! I had to be at work in 45 minutes so me and my husband decided to met there for a quick bite to eat... My only complaint is that the sushi bar is way to small, there were only about 3 seats left at the bar, 2 were together and one alone. Its very close in there and so there was not enough room for us to squeeze in there cause it would not have been comfortable.

This is clear across town from where I live, but worth the drive every once in a while. I have been reading the reviews for the place and it had me so excited! Finally, for my bf's birthday, who is a sushi fanatic, we tried Island Sushi.

I like the idea of hawaiian fusion mix. We got here, a small sushi restaurant connected to Poke Express, and sat at the bar. We arrived around 4:15p, so it was still early and there weren't many people here at all. I think our sushi chef, Terrence, seemed like an owner or something. Not sure, but he was awesome! I told him it was our first time there and we had heard about it from Yelp, and he explained everything to us and gave us a special treat in the end.

So first off, we are Uni fans. HAD TO try the uni. It was fresh! Also had the hamachi and salmon. And some other stuff, don't remember. But everything was fresh. They also had a good variety of appetizers to choose from, different types of poke, some traditional sushi apps, and some hawaiian type apps. We ordered... hamachi kama (not a big fan but it wasn't bad), eggplant fries (YUM!!), crab poke (didn't know how to eat it!), little fried octopus (like calamari and it was super yummy! it looked cute too), also.. a couple other things. Can't remember it all, but nothing disappointed me at all. Some went far above expectations.

For the rolls, they had a decent variety and we couldn't decide what to try. They don't really do half orders (only on your last roll you can do a half). So Terrence asked us what we liked and just made some rolls for us. One had hamachi inside and outside and it was great. Also had the Big Island Roll. Did a half order of one the soft shell crab rolls (don't remember the name) and then there was another roll, but don't remember.

And then the desserts! We were limited to one dessert each which was a bummer. Yama Sushi is unlimited but they don't have the variety like Island Sushi! I got the 808 rolls after seeing all the pictures of it. Its deep fried banana with ice cream and whipped cream with fresh strawberries and chocolate syrup. My bf got malasadas (deep fried dough) with ice cream and whipped cream and strawberry sauce. Delicious! Not to mention they gave us mini puffs because we are yelpers! (well at least I am).

Overall, great experience. Their prices are decent. And they gave my bf half off since it was his birthday (we didn't even ask for it). Terrence is great! And the food was fresh and delicious. The servers were nice and the food came out quickly. If only they had a location closer to me, but you can't have everything right? I would go back to this place weekly if I could, but my waistline would not be happy with that. But I definitely recommend this place to everyone.

ALSO!! Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday they have 1/2 off rolls all day. Other days they have half off rolls certain hours for happy hour. Check their website for specials. And they have a full bakery attached to Poke Express (same place). Yum.",JY0rvs_4HBjXKdRB07aEnQ,6,7,5,BJYDr1PGstzYyCHtqCgXAA

This is probably the first resto with 3 different spots: plate lunches, poke, and sushi (a sushi resto to be exact). Think L & L , Tanioka's, and Sushi Twister all combined into one. Was the AYCE worth it? I think so. You can order anything on the menu with a limit of 2 for desserts. The poke was great and had that melt in your mouth texture. My dad ordered around 3-4 small bowls of poke alone. The sushi was pretty good but I think still not as good as Yama Sushi.

Good customer service and good food. The lady that had helped me was nice. She explained all the questions I had and was very nice about it. I liked the Hawaiian food mix that they had going on. 

I had the ""grilled"" side of island sushi.  I ordered the loco moco with Portuguese sausage. It was pretty good. I had tried stuff my group had gotten also. No complaints really.  I would recommend coming here just for the poke express but this place is a added bonus. Although it only says ISLAND SUSHI outside and a small poke express on the door when coming in.

The prices are very reasonable. 

The establishment could be in a better lot location, since parking space is a little tight if you have a large vehicle/truck.

My hubby ordered the plain malasada and I ordered the custard filled malasada.  So freaking good!  It was worth going to a shady area just to eat.  Best foodie find in a while.  They were fresh, soft and warm.  The custard was perfect, not too sweet or overpowering and very creamy.  It was so good, it made it worth while cheating on my diet!  The plain malasada was very tasty too, but the custard filled one was over the top.  A little piece of heaven in your mouth I tell you!  They also have chocolate and haupia filled malasadas too!

I would definitely dine here again as they have a pretty large Hawaiian food menu too.  They have very good prices for breakfast and lunch that I will for sure have to try the next time I am in Vegas.

This place should be reported to the health department and shut down.

I've never had an overall bad experience at a sushi place as there is usually something positive to focus on but this place is a clear exception.

1) Service was horrible from the start. The host was confused with the difference between per piece and all you can eat pricing. Once we were finally seated, it took over 10 mins for someone to come over and when the waitress finally did, just asked what we wanted and walked away. We asked for spicy mayo literally five times and when they finally brought it, only brought two even though we asked for individual ones.

2) I had the baked Tempura Roll and it made me deathly sick. It didn't taste bad but after I finished it, I had to rush to the rest room and still felt sick long after.

I was thinking feeding a bunch of teenage girls, this could be expensive so I knew I wanted an AYCE option. I also wanted a place that served more than just sushi because let's face it, not everyone can get down on raw fish. I really think I chose the perfect place! Other than the shitty parking lot, and a few service hiccups, I would say we did pretty well. 
There ended up being 10 of us. I only made a reservation for 8, and they accommodated us. It was a small squished area, and there was a bigger table they could have put us at, but whatever. It was my fault so I was not going to complain.
Three of the girls went with a teriyaki chicken plate that was served with rice and mac salad. It was good. But I was there for the unlimited supply of garlic edamame, gyoza, tempura, tiger rolls, and oh my new favorite, the black widow roll. I did not even realized I like soft shell crab until this roll. They also had great dessert options like brownie sundaes, green tea ice cream, and creme brulee. 
There were certain items you could only have one of, but AT LEAST they offer these items unlike other sushi places. (certain sashimis and desserts) And a few certain items that were only available for dinner. Which is a couple bucks more, but still a great price at $27 p/p. 
The restaurant is small with a mix of Hawaiian and Japanese decor. The service was not bad. It was not amazing. They forgot a coke, and served us a roll 25 minutes after ordering it. They did not charge us for the 6 uneaten pieces of sushi which I was grateful for. Our total bill including 18% tip came to $300. For sure a decent price for 10 at a sushi spot.

2535600,2011-05-22,13,DzKl51tivGJMLiNsQqf38w,"My Island Sushi cherry has officially been popped! My cousins have been telling me to try this place out for months, and finally we all got together to feast!! (I was the only newbie).

WHERE: Located on Eastern & Serene.

WHAT: As a first-timer, I had to do AYCE!! Wouldn't it be a waste if I didn't eat all I could?!! Ok so back to my experience.  I am in love with baked rolls, and the only downside to this place was that AYCE did not have ANY baked rolls whatsoever! I was bummed at first, but when I tried what they did have, my ""bummness level"" decreased.

WHAT I HAD:

The appetizers I had were: ahi poke (I might have to say that this is one of the best I've tasted in town! It was very fresh and tasty), mochiko chicken (ahh, I fell in love after the first bite!), seaweed salad (sweet & delishhhh), and baked mussels (always one of my favorites when on any menu).

Special Sushi rolls I had:
-Mt. Charleston roll; Since they didn't have baked rolls, they did have baked scallops on this roll.  I had to take advantage because this was the closest thing to baked that I'd be getting that night. Haha, when I did get my roll, I was very pleased!
-Ahi Poke roll; I apparently couldn't get enough of the tuna in my system, I needed more! Kudos to this roll though =).
-Island Special roll; this roll was my all time favorite! Everyone must have this! It hit the spot indeed.

*NOTE: if you do decide to do AYCE, you get to choose a free dessert! I always have room for dessert in my tummy =D. There were malasada&icecream, brownie&icecream, just plain icecream, mochi, and I believe there were a couple more.  I settled for my mango mochi of course.

WHY: A lot of people have been comparing Island Sushi to 808 Sushi (because of the whole owner/chef switch, I actually am not so clear of it myself), but I have personally come to conclude that Island Sushi defeats 808 Sushi in my book.",udpfGxriuoBdWRBdplJl-w,15,17,4,PNPfrPLabfEJoazz4VqAlw

My dad received his garlic shrimp plate shortly after, he was pretty much done with his plate before my mom and I received our plates (about 20 mins) apparently there was a mix up in our order not a huge deal cause we were still full from the rolls. Our waiter (mack) was kind enough to give us dessert on him for the inconvenience which was really nice of his!  He was a great server all in all and checked up on us very often! If it wasn't for Mack being a great waiter we probably wouldn't have a huge interest in coming back but his friendliness is what will draw us back in!

Ive eaten at the sushi side a couple of times and just as it was before the service was eeeh ok at best, i expected better and faster service since its not always full capacity when we go.

I really enjoyed the extra pupus that you can order, my favorite was the ""seared garlic-peppered ahi belly"" that was the best thing on there, but the only bad thing was that it was limit one order per person, so i recommend getting that as one of the last of your sushi orders, my favorite dessert from the pupu menu was their small slush or ice cream float shot, the one on the menu this time as the green apple slush float shot, it was very very good i got a brain freeze after downing a couple lol. The rest of the menu was just ok nothing really special.

For the grill side i always used to drive 8 miles just to get their bento or malasadas, pretty far drive just for some food but its worth it when i have the Hawaii food craving, i don't go there much anymore since i always hit up the IslandbreezeLV truck which is almost always closer to me than Island Sushi.",PPxlsFQILSn4hpkgbrHH8g,1,2,4,PpIsRGKLwVrtYbATmiTcbQ

Overall the food is pretty good for plate lunches. But this last time the teriyaki chicken was a little salty compared to previous times.  

Once in awhile they would have coconut custard pie and that's pretty good.

The poke is excellent one of the best in the area.  The deft touch on the shoyu for the poke is on point not too salty.",MljQrqqvCaNr_yvCRohuxQ,0,0,4,c_u2HqUxqnteDIkoSdCcAQ

I must say we were thoroughly impressed! I'm not a sushi connoisseur by all means but I have had my share of sushi from all around the world within 39 years of my life and this place generated a big smile on my face when I left. Most AYCE sushi joints around Vegas can't compare to the quality and price of this place. The items you can order with the AYCE deal is extraordinary...especially when you can order kal bi and poke. To top it off, my 11 year old daughter and wife were so happy to be here and loved every bite. And finally, I want to say thank you for supporting the military and offering a military discount to our meal!!! There are few minor flaws about this place. 1. I wish the bathrooms were bigger. 2. I wish you guys would turn up the Hawaiian/Island music more. I couldn't hardly hear what was playing. 3. I wish you guys would open up another restaurant in the Centennial Hills area, or somewhere close to there. Thank you Island Sushi team for the superb experience.

We all got the all you can eat sushi, and for 10 fatties, it was a great deal.. 90 minute time limit was more than enough to stuff our faces with sushi.  I have to admit that the Nigiri was totally worth it.. fish to rice ratio was great.  Big pieces of fish with smaller amounts of rice made the hamachi nigiri a go-to favorite of the night.  Another must is the eggplant fries! My boyfriend isn't a sushi fan, but he loved the garlic chicken and the eggplant fries. 

Another aspect on their menu is the malasada sundae... and their desserts in general.  A lot of sushi places just have green tea or mochi ice cream as a dessert... Island Sushi has tempura ice cream, brownie sundaes... yum.

I'm thinking maybe employees (or people who know them) are writing reviews on this place. My boyfriend is obsessed with AYCES so we've been to A LOT of places in Vegas.

I don't like the fact that they don't have pictures of the rolls on their menu. I would like to see what I'm ordering. I personally don't eat raw fish so I like to order rolls that are baked or fried. Not one single item was like that. The menu does say baked and fried but they just cook the stuff on top so the rice is still cold. My boyfriend loves albacore tuna. We went at lunch time and they didn't have it so we had to pay dinner prices to get what we came for. He didn't like it at all. He said that the fish was room temperature. I thought that the shrimp and the unagi were fishy. The rolls were nothing special at all. I did like the fact that they were relatively bite size. Some places we go to they cut their rolls so big I have to struggle to get the darn thing in my mouth. My biggest complaint, only one desert per person. The whole reason I go to anything all you can eat is so I can get lots of desert. Luckily my boyfriend doesn't eat sweets too much so I got his. I absolutely love mochi but I didn't get any because the only flavors to choose from were strawberry and mango. I'm a vanilla and chocolate kind of girl.

I've been eating here for over 6 years now and I still haven't written a review for them?! What is wrong with me? I was first introduced to this place when my old roommate brought home their oxtail soup. Immediately then, I was hooked. I knew from then on, if the oxtail soup was good, everything else would be good. 

So one side of the restaurant is a a sit down sushi joint while the other side is a grill making delicious Hawaiian fare. Like I said, I'll be writing about the grill side. They have large portions, enough to have leftovers the next day. Everything is cooked fresh. They have a display of desserts which include malasadas, chantilly cake, guava cake, mochi and other ono Hawaiian desserts. There is also a small poke counter to order freshly prepared fish. I have tried almost everything on the menu, and nothing has disappointed me. I do have my go-to favorites though...

Oxtail Soup: this is my #1 pick when eating here. The broth is rich and deep in flavor. The meat is fall-off-the-bone tender. They give you huge pieces of meat and 2 big scoops of rice. The ginger and garlic are on the side so you are able to customize your broth. Such a filling meal and very satisfying in the winter months. 

Ahi Avocado Bowl: When I'm in need of a ""skinny-person"" meal, this is it. Although it's not really a skinny person meal because the bowl is absolutely huge. The fish is fresh. The avocados and a richness to the fish and rice. The cucumbers add that refreshing crunch. Plus it's extra delish if you add some soy sauce and sriracha on there. 

Katsu Chicken: who doesn't love perfectly crunchy katsu?  That's exactly what this is! It's fried fresh. The chicken is juicy but not at all oily. 

I can go on and on and name a few more delicious dishes like kalbi beef plate and a bowl of saimin, but I'm don't want to bore you. 

Seating is limited, so try to come during non peak meal times or take it to-go. No matter, just come here and get your grub on. I think I'm going to get this for lunch tomorrow!",BI4jBJVto2tEQ0NiaR0rNQ,32,23,5,8bh71h2cre0vJZsTjl-Xrg

I do enjoy this place greatly for Hawaiian food, and it is probably the best in Las Vegas. the Plaza location is way better in though as far as consistency goes. I suggest going there if you want a larger variety of food along with tastier flavors.

Stopped here before making the drive back to LA. The ambiance is very casual. You order at the counter and find a seat. The food is made to order so it takes a while to get your order. 

Food: ordered the katsu and their pork loco moco. The food was good. The pork gravy was yummy but it didn't reach its full potential until it was reheated at home. The katsu was OK. It had more breading than chicken. My friends ordered a beef with sauce which they said was very good. I will try that next time. The food overall is just not comparable to some restaurants in Hawaii but it will do!

Staff: these ladies seemed extremely busy and didn't really smile much. I understand that they have things to do but it felt like I was a bother any time I needed something.

They upcharge 89 cents for teriyaki sauce. They only have soy sauce and ketchup on their condiment bar.

Table and chair seating for maybe 6 people per row. They have a bout 4 rows.

Overall, its a nice casual spot to get your Hawaiian fix but it doesn't necessarily trigger nostalgia that will transport you to hawaii --- the POKE side is great though",6vmfgZN3IC3toXRQdmKtBg,0,0,4,frzRkj2LhfV1yxD9hHY8lg

It was pretty bland. 

A few days later I decided to try the Sushi side and again it wasn't great but not bad.  the Rice was overcooked and they did not use enough sugar in their sushi rice vinegar which made it a little bitter.  and anyone who is a lover of great sushi knows the rice is the most important ingredient to sushi not the fish.  oh by the way the salmon was really bland.

All you can Eat sushi - So worth it - get the
Poki, Lomi Lomi Salmon, garlic chicken , Heck Try all of the pupu side and sushi rolls.   My friend goes there just to eat poki and she orders literally 8 bowls, believe me you'd pay more for just 4 poke bowls normally.

Fast Food side -
Bento Boxes are a good deal
Saimin is good
Malasada's custard filled are Delicious, taste just like Leonards in Hawaii.

Only things that I'm not impressed with is there Eel and Oyakudon bowls, they are soggy and literally when I tried twice to go there and order the Oyakudon (chicken/egg bowl)  they gave me the wrong one and I got stuck with eel.  But to be fair I had a large order both times, so on the 3rd time I just ordered the Oyakudon bowl alone, and I was dissappointed.  I guess I'm used to everything else, which is 98% of the food there 100% onoliscious.  I was hoping their Oyakudon bowl would be like Ichiza's (spring mt), but this dish isn't a staple in Local Hawaiian food, it's more Japanese, so for them just to offer it is remarkable in itself.

Should of been a hint to leave but I still waited and I decided to ask the girl how much longer because people who came in after me got their order and I still had not gotten mines. She responded to me ""what did you order?"" much to my dismay. She sees me standing there and didn't even bother to ask me anything. If in her mind she didn't remember me ordering, shouldn't she have assisted me to see what I needed? So I told her and then she remembers. She ran back to the kitchen and came to me and apologized and said a couple more minutes. I waited about another 15 minutes and my order still didn't come. And the girl just ignored me. I could have thrown a fit like the guy did but I realized how embarrassed they were after he did that. So I stayed patient. The owner comes to me and asks me again what was I waiting on. Are you kidding me? Did they forget my order again? After I tell them for the second time, I see him going back to scoop up my poke, literally 3 minutes later he finally comes with my order. 

I will not be coming back. 40 minutes wait and the poke wasn't bad, but definitely not worth the wait. They need to learn how to run a business and be more punctual.",Kf35Fl31zONNxUxKIVOOzw,1,0,1,WGdeGNBrpzN1yIqnFk3Gcg

The poke bar is all the way at the back and the guy was super nice and friendly. He didn't seem to get impatient as we wanted to sample everything and everything was delicious! He even gave great recommendations and would mix pokes for us.

There fish isn't the greatest for AYCE.   And I'm not normally an AYCE fan... but for lunch this place is pretty good.   I'd actually give it 3.5 stars.

Service: 4 stars - people are really nice and my tea and water were never empty

Menu selection: 4 stars - they have everything from sushi to plate lunch

Fish quality: 3 stars - not as flavorful or interesting/unique as other places like Naked Fish

Rolls: good selection but not overly crazy variations... and you can ask to have a roll customized for you

Ginger: 3 stars - I'm a Ginger fan and was a bit disappointed that there's didn't taste as fresh as I was hoping... it was a little tough and didn't have the sweetness and punch combo I like

Restaurant ambiance: 3 stars - nothing special but it's clean and doesn't smell like fish

Bakery section: 4 stars - their desserts always look amazing but I have yet to give in to my desire to eat them

Poke counter: n/a - have not enjoyed the Poke yet so I'm going back later this week to try it

Parking: easy, lot out front is rarely filled

If I do ever decide to go back, I will eat at the bar (the ONLY place where you get friendly, fast service), demand my bill immediately and tip the sushi bar workers.

Also, having read numerous reviews about the terrible service saddens me that nothing is actually done about it.  Again, I've been going weekly for over a year.

Additionally, there was a vast variety of food on the menu, and every single thing we ordered was delicious! It was hard to narrow down the choices because we wanted everything on the menu after we experienced the taste tasting. On our wedding day, the caterers were all set up and ready to go at our venue when an hour before the wedding started we had to move the reception across town, not only were they flexible, the rushed over to set up at the new location and their execution was FLAWLESS and they did not miss a beat!

All you Henderson residents should be aware that its just down the 215, so there's no need to go deep into Vegas itself for places like this. 

The place is rather small, and it was actually kinda packed for a Tuesday night. Thus, the people I went with were not allowed to sit at the bar because that section was already full.

Their salmon nigiri is pretty decent, and I'd usually get that with every order I made. I also enjoyed the yellowtail nigiri because the place I normally go to in the Bay Area doesn't have it. Noteworthy rolls include the Mauna Kea, Mt. Charleston, and the spicy Mexican. Had a rainbow roll as well, but yeah it was just like any subpar rainbow roll.

You got poke express which is a company set aside on its own . Then two more sections that is just island sushi . One side is mainly the fast hawaiian food and one that is more sit down with the AYCE sushi option. 

They've got a happy hour I like to go to every Monday - Wednesday all day that is half off select rolls. I love the surf & turf! I can't not come here without eating it . The food is really yummy , however the real let down is how they lack in service . It is just so-so and sometimes irritating. Whenever I come to the sit down section I can always expect service to be slow and mediocre. Usually it takes a long time for them to refill drinks and take your order, esp if your an AYCE . There not rude or anything there just extremely slow , which is why it didn't get 5 stars. 

The atmosphere is nice , it clean with two tvs on either side. It also has a sort of mini billboard on at each of the side tables that advertises local businesses . 

I LOVE the Togo/fast food side of this place. It's so yummy , everything that I've gotten from there . I especially love the bentos , can never go wrong with those. If your looking to buy poke I suggest going to the poke express counter .

I got the fried noodle combo with mochiko chicken and garlic chicken. The chicken was good even though it was a little over cooked and dry. The fried noodles was the bomb but little on the skimpy side for the price they charged.  I will definitely be back to try the other items on the menu.

I've been to the sushi side a few times (serves AYCE & more of a sit in restaurant), but I prefer the grill side (sit in & to go available). Bentos are served just like how you would get them in Hawaii & a pretty packed plate for the price. There's always poke bowls on the specials list, but when Poke Express is open that's where I usually order from. Spicy Ahi (tuna with masago & mayo) is the BEST! & if you're into octopus.. Tako with limu is my recommendation!

I probably should've written a review a long time ago, but I guess I was just too busy inhaling all my food. :D",ZmDVfT_3-YwZv9cXnWN_ug,1,1,5,0GJj55Gp-j6nRNU9wHXbFg

Upon entering this establishment, I was a bit confused because there was a hawaiian restaurant in front of me and then a divider on the right which seemed like a sit down sushi restaurant. I guess it was two restaurants in one establishment. Anyways, I came for the loco moco. I ended up ordering the pulled pork loco moco and the chicken katsu. The lady who took our order in the front counter seemed overwhelmed as she was taking customer orders as well as phone orders. It didn't bother me so much that she was working hard, but it's nice to be in the moment with someone you're talking to.

When the food arrived, oh boy did it look good. All in all, it was okay. It didn't really hit the spot as my go-to hawaiian restaurant in LA. It was filling no doubt, but it felt a little bland. It definitely needed salt. The egg on the loco moco was overcooked. I never had pulled pork in my loco moco and I thought it was an interesting meat to add on, but I think the gravy needed to be more flavorful for me to really enjoy the meal. 

The Hawaiian side of this restaurant is small with long table seating and maybe 3-4 booths. There are TVs to keep you company while you wait for your food.

We went in early evening and they had 3 parties ahead of us. 2 tops and we were a 4 top (2 adults and 2 kids). We waited in their front room, the restaurant was behind a lil curtain in its own room. We waited for about 30min. A little too long for only being the 3rd party on the list and with at least 5 open tables in the restaurant. The lady who was sitting people had called another party before us but we stood up and said, we got here before them and we still haven't been seated. She gestured for us to go ahead inside as well. We walked in the restaurant and they had at least 5 tables open. 

We did the AYCE and ordered our girls their own individual bowls of rice and a couple appetizers for their dinner. There was a lot of waiting in between, waters not being filled in a timely manner (we had to ask a couple times for refills), and our server forgot one of our orders but made it seem like they were still making it. It was well over 20min and we ordered another roll after the fact and still got that before the first one. Then he charged us for 2 kids AYCE when they didn't even touch any of the rolls, just what we ordered them individually. That was another 5 or so minutes waiting for them to adjust our bill. We spent 2.5hrs at the restaurant. Half the time was us waiting on their service. We ate our food pretty quick, at the most we were eating for an hour. The rest of the time was waiting to be seated, waiting to order after being seated, waiting for the food, waiting for the bill (we had been done for a good 10min and no one had brought us a bill, we had to ask them), and then waiting for them to correct our bill for over billing us. 

The food is not that great to be receiving such a service. They look busy, but they just have 2 servers for the whole restaurant. At least that's what I had noticed. Maybe hire a couple more servers and you'd provide faster service instead of guests waiting and waiting. Definitely not going back to the restaurant.

So for starters, they have daily specials and I wish it was a WEDNESDAY because they have Meat Jun.  Hopefully it tastes just as good as Dong Yang in my hometown in Wahiawa. Definitely need to make my way out to Vegas during the weekday. 

Food: 
Tako Poke
Shoyu Poke with limu
Spicy Ahi poke bowl
Friday's special - Lau Lau plate with rice and long rice
Fried Noodles with Kalbi
And lastly for dessert 1 dozen malasadas

When you first walk in, there are dessert choices on the left hand side.  Also, looks like that's where you can order ""to go"" items.  Keep walking in and go straight to the POKE station where you'd find lots of different types of POKE.  On the right hand side is the dine in with a sushi bar.  

Our server was alright and nothing really stood out.  Our food came quickly and everyone was really nice.  We even met the owner. Aloha!  

For the food here's my opinion: 
Poke was on point considering that I've had the opportunity to try all different places from San Diego's Best Poke and the infamous Foodland POKE so Island Sushi is good. 
The lau lau was dry, unfortunately.  It was overcooked.  
Fried Noodles and Kalbi was also good.  The kalbi was on point however the noodles lacked flavor which is fine so I added soy sauce. (I like salty food so that's my fault)
Now for the malasadas.  Lots of places claim that they have good malasadas.  I will say that so far on the mainland, Island Sushi & Grill has the best.  We opt for 6 malasadas to eat at the table then took 6 to go.  It was good that I had to return before leaving Vegas for San Diego.  I called in my order and when I got there my order wasn't quite ready.  :( Which is fine so I waited.  The young lady (on a Sunday morning) grabbed a box from the warmer and filled a couple with custard.  This time around the malasadas wasn't as good.  Not sure why, it was also not as hot.  :(  I think I should've ordered when I got there instead. It probably would've been hot.  

Aloha and Mahalo Island Sushi & Grill.  Definitely a restaurant I will return to when I'm in Vegas.   #islandgirlnette",Ar3bat-NGasrXDiS7WF8OA,5,8,4,RQeWad2suhAYd7EZi9HA0w

Back then they had so-so food (we had ok sushi) and average service. Unfortunately, we weren't that impressed and wrote them off. Then about a year ago a friend said that IS has opened up a grill section on the opposite side of the sit down restaurant with a very different menu filled with local plate lunch favorites. We heard a lot of good things about their plate lunches, so we had to give them a try.

We walked in during a lunch rush and the first thing I noticed is how empty the sushi and sit down area was and how packed the new grill section was.  I looked over the new menu and was impressed. They had everything...breakfast plates, saimin, burgers, bentos, and many of the plate lunches you would eat in Hawaii.  They also had a dessert case with all kinds of sweets...cakes (chantilly, guava, & haupia), mochi, cocoa puffs (don't do it, they are FAR from Liliha Bakery's gems!), and cookies. And they do make malasada's and they are pretty good. We also had AYCE ($20.99/ person) lunch sushi menu which was very good for the price. They also have a Poke Express in the back of the restaurant.  If you are hosting any party, this is where you should get your poke. They have a wide variety of poke dishes, ahi, tako, shoyu, crab, etc.

Bentos for $8 you can't go wrong.

I know it's called Island Sushi, and the owner is from Hawaii, but, I don't care much for the raw fish, sushi, or rolls here. I swear I've tasted much better, fresher fish. in addition, they DROWN their rolls in a watery, too sweet, unagi sauce. (I'm used to the kabayaki unagi sauce, which is dark and rich, and found at most other sushi restaurants here in Vegas,)
The only roll that I can remember from here is the Candy Cane Roll, but, still, it's no big thing. But, in any case, I return here with my boyfriend every once in a great while to fill my tummy with pupus/appetizers galore! The selection of appetizers that they offer is VAST in comparison to many other sushi bars ON SUNDAYS. I like the mochiko chicken, eggplant fries, and their tempura sauce! It is sweeter than most places, which i happen to like as well. The Sunday list changes a lot, and it includes mini desserts too. I always get a creme brulee to finish.

The service is decent at best, some waitresses a little friendlier than the others, and the decor, is... well, i don't know how you would call it, but I guess, they're trying too hard for the local island feel. I am definitely not fond of the digital photo frames up next to our table, showcasing various rolls,random groups of people, and, then, seeing it in a never ending loop from the corner of your eye!

My hubby ordered the creme brûlée once and it was laughably small, slightly larger than a half dollar coin! Mocha ice cream is also very good.

Every time I have mainland family visiting, a stop at this restaurant is a must. In Nov 2014, I think I spent over $200 visiting this restaurant because of all the family we had visiting.

I have been coming to this restaurant for the past four years, before I even moved to Vegas. Two reasons why:

1. I'm a noodle head and they have really good fried noodles. Noodles like I used to get from the manapua truck when I was a kid but with more char sui, spam and kamaboko
2. The POKE deli in the back. As far as I know, this is the only restaurant that has this, similar to all the supermarkets from HI. You can sample some of the different pokes they have. You even can choose to get a 1/4 lb of poke. This allows you to get all kinds of poke to taste!  And honestly, I would say that this is the original poke restaurant in Las Vegas. Although poke is the current trend in Las Vegas and all these poke bowl restaurants are opening up. If you want authentic, original Hawaiian style poke, come here. Forget the rice and all the vegetables and load up on poke. Before I forget, the poke counter closes early than the restaurant, at 8pm.

One of my family favorites, malasadas. When you visit this restaurant, be sure to put your order in asap as it does take time to fry up these bad boys. Try the different filled flavors. Be sure you leave room for these delights at the end of your meal as it is best when it is fresh.

And they did renovate the ""carry out"" portion of the restaurant. When I visited the restaurant last week, my family of 12 got there as soon as they opened up. We were able to take up two rows of tables with plenty of room for other patrons.

Because this is an extremely popular restaurant for the ""9th Islanders"", it is important that you plan ahead. Lunch, dinner and weekends, this place is poppin'.",leyNDNVu09Ldbg5ujPWMhQ,2,0,5,S0qX4c4K-WUU69zygT90oA

We ordered some poke and katsu along with the oxtail soup.  You order at the counter first and they will bring your meal to the table.  We went during dinner time and there was 10 people already in line.  There's a sushi only section on the other side of this restaurant.  Crowds of people always stand in line to eat here.  We will have to go back and try their sushi next time.  

The oxtail soup has a different tasting broth.  It's more like an udon tasting broth which we found to be very interesting.  The oxtail meat was very fatty which also made the broth quite oily.  My meat had A lot of fat attached versus what I would get at the California hotel.  Quality was lacking but it was good enough for us to eat for dinner at a reasonable time.  

The chicken Kutsu was prepared just right and I am enjoyed eating this more than the ox tail soup.  The poke was good for what you'd get in Vegas where it is nowhere close to an ocean!  My mother-in-law got the garlic chicken and that was very flavorful!  Overall I would come here again when I'm visiting Vegas.

Service was awesome.  The counter help and the Poke guy in the back helped us out and answered our questions with a smile.  Ordered our food and it came out in a timely manner.

I ordered the Fried  Noodle Combo with Mochiko Chicken.  The chicken was crispy, juicy, and flavorful.  The rice, noodles, and Mac salad was less desirable.  The rice was hard, noodles were soggy and wasn't seasoned, and the macaroni in the mac salad had a weird texture.

My son had the corned beef hash breakfast.  He loved it except for the rice.  Same situation as my plate, the rice was hard.

My wife and daughter ordered Poke bowls.  The presentation was nice.  My wife enjoyed the sushi rice, my daughter not so much.  Poke had good flavor and the sides were good too.  Fresh and crisp Pickled cucumber and Crispy Taro chips.  The portions of the actual poke itself was disappointing.  It was about 2 teaspoons of fish.  We probably will order it by the pound next time.

We also ordered a dozen Malasada's.  6 haupia and 6 chocolate.  These Buggahz was MEEEEEAAAN!  No complaints here.

The Poke is really awesome.  If you like Tagu, it is sweet and chewy and very authentic.  The shou Poke and spicy poke is great also.  If you are a poke fan, do try Poke Express.

I usually get the Bento Box A with Garlic Chicken.  It is a huge meal with rice, Teri beef, garlic chicken, spam and noodles.  Very flavorful and filling.  My wife gets the tuna bowl.  That is huge also.  Great flavors with the tuna and rice.

They have Oxtail soup on Saturdays all day and after 600pm other days.  I like this and it's very authentic.  You combine the rice and ginger and green onions and you have a cornucopia of flavors and textures in that oxtail soup.  It has been the best I could find so far in Las Vegas.

I would pass on the Saiman.  The noodles are good, but the broth is not as flavorful as the other places I've tried in LV.

3522520,2014-11-23,1,DzKl51tivGJMLiNsQqf38w,"Went here last night for the All You Can Eat (AYCE) sushi dinner and I have to say that this was once of the better places I have been to in terms of the quality of sushi. I'd say probably in the top 3. The dinner is almost $30, but you do get a wider selection of choices known as the ""dinner selection items"" which are not available during lunch. Also items marked with a hashtag have a one item per person restriction. 

I got about 25 items and I recommend getting the crunch and black widow roll. The eel, ebi, and salmon nigiri was really good too. The hot lava roll was not good at all because it didn't have much taste besides spiciness and the inside of the roll had a red paste texture. 

Another highlight was each person gets up to two dessert items which was a first for me at an AYCE sushi. Be sure to try the green tea ice cream (strong green tea taste) and the malasada sundae! Malasada is kinda like a Hawaiian donut that reminds me of a cross between a donut and churro. The tempura ice cream was okay because they only have vanilla ice cream and the fried shell was kinda soggy.

Overall, the experience was very nice and I would go back here again. The only downer about this place is the appearance. When you first walk in it looks like a small bakery place with the main dining area on the right side. It has a hole in the wall sort of feel which is okay, but the other AYCE places I have been to have a more classy atmosphere and they even had lower prices haha.

I am obsessed with your restaurant. But today my friend Lisa and I had the displeasure of being served by Mila and I have to say something about it. We were coming to get some sushi. Decided to do all you can eat and heard about all you can drink for $10. Awesome deal. We are both full time business women and wanted to unwind with a few beers and some good food. Mila explained that it's $10 all you can eat sake and beer. Cool. Then she later corrected that they are individual charges. We said fine, Lisa would get the beer and I'd get the sake. We could have it all! Mila corrected us, which was fine. That's her job. But being in the customer service industry, I welcome all feedback and use it as growth to improve every customers time in my store, and decided to tell Mila that I would appreciate if she could just give the feedback to the restaurant management that I feel it should be interchangeable. Just like getting all you can eat and sharing the rolls, getting all you can drink should follow the same structure. * if both parties are paying, then why not?* 

She seemed to think my feedback was more funny than valuable, and proceeded to point at a table in the corner and say ""well they are all sitting over there, so-"" as if I wanted to stop my lunch to go relay the message. 

All she would have have to do is say ""thank you for that feedback, I will make sure they hear it"". 

From then on I just began to lose my desire to be there. Listen, all you can drink is a great idea, in an atmosphere where you facilitate an environment where people feel valued and welcomed. Mila sadly had a poor attitude the rest of our visit and did very routine ""check ins"" but obviously was following a script vs. any kind of genuine interest in our satisfaction as customers. 

We were the only ones there too, and Mila kept going to the other table (the table full of the owners and managers) it made us feel like we were being talked about and it created less of a welcoming atmosphere. Remember, perception is reality. So be aware of your customers. 

I'm so bummed about this experience. It was my friends first time here and I feel she had a very bad impression of what this restaurant stands for. Sure makes me think twice about coming here. The prices are the same anywhere, I come here equally because the food kicks ass, but mostly because of the environment and the amazing customer service.

The plan was H & O will share a chicken katsu lunch and me and hubby will share a Bento Lunch A (teriyaki beef & teriyaki chicken). 

We all shared both but ate all the katsu lunch. We had leftover teriyaki chicken, beef and rice, which will probably be a snack for hubby later after his nap. 

PROS:
-Food cooked fresh
-The teriyaki chicken was delish!  Next time hubby wants just teriyaki chicken. :)
-I loved the Furikake rice in the bento box! 


CONS:
-Long wait to get food (that's what happens when you show up right at lunch time 12:00pm)
-I wasn't too fond of the Mac salad--too dry, not seasoned well. Tasted like it was made a few days earlier and just stored in the fridge. 
-ran out of some poke I wanted to try

I heard Island Sushi has an awesome brunch. Can't wait to try it. I would rank this place higher than Sushi Mon, for sure.  There was no wait to get in, the service is better, and I think the rolls are more creative. I can't compare it to I Love or Momo (apples and oranges).",6Y-l3x4LpUNhTBVMTFmTmA,0,1,4,7xc_wGSWUu-QWAZgCPbB9Q
3675188,2010-01-02,3,DzKl51tivGJMLiNsQqf38w,"HORRIBLE SERVICE.  My group waited 10 minutes to get seated when there empty tables available and the three servers walking around got the orders from everyone around us and didn't bother to ask if we wanted to order anything.  When they finally did, it took them near 20 minutes to get our first sushi orders to us.  I'm no sushi chef and I understand the restaurant gets a bit busy, but when all three servers are busy chatting away with everyone else and forgets to bring you the order you've been waiting for, 20 minutes is quite a long time to be waiting for a few sushi rolls.  Plus, the sushi rolls weren't even cut correctly and fell apart in a mess when we tried to eat the sushi.  After the first round of sushi, they asked once if we needed more sushi (and we said yes due to the pending 8 more sushi we ordered) and despite our long list of ordered sushi, it took about 30 minutes for one of the servers to come by and take our order again.  By this time I had lost my appetite and decided to pay the bill before I became even more pissed off due to their incompetence.  I'm from Hawai'i and when I saw 'Island Sushi' decided to stop in and check this place out, I really thought I would get that local island hospitality.  The only hospitality I got was ""Oh, sorry ah"" when they realized they forgot our table orders half and hour later.

Yes, they have a hawaiian slant to their preparation, and everything tastes okay.  But none of the fish was spectacular, fresh, or well-cut.  

Most of the rolls had tons of sauce on top that overpowered the flavor.  The amaebi was not good, and the heads were overfried.  

One issue which bugged all of us - the servers kept reminding us that we had to eat everything we ordered...and the sushi came out very slowly.  I wonder if they did that on purpose.  

Anyways, right as we were paying the bill the whole restaurant filled with a strong scent of smoke.  We asked the waitress - she laughed and said the chef burnt a bunch of eel in the kitchen.  

On the bright side, you don't have to wait an hour for a table like at Sushimon.  But maybe there's a reason for that.

This place would be two stars if it was in California, but being an all you can eat sushi restaurant in a landlocked state, I'll give them three.",IyU01Jx7GF3BcJ8w-_T2EQ,1,2,3,wpnRv49bON7FGX7KMLI9NA

I like how you can get AYCE sitting at a table & not only at the bar like how most Cali sushi places are.. super plus! 
And unlike most AYCE sushi places in California (specifically the valley area) the food here was great and is sooo much better than the sushi i'm used to. 

I liked how there was 3 pgs of food (basically everything) from the menu to choose from on the AYCE.. plus being Sunday there was a ""brunch"" option that included a few Hawaiian breakfast and special sushi options. 
Try the Lechon from that menu!! It was f*cking delish, chopped crunchy pieces of pork with a vinegarry-soy sauce and pieces of onion and tomatoes, we had to order it 3 times it was so good!
We really loved the yellowtail sushi, Salmon Sushi w/ Orgasm sauce, Kona roll, and especially loved that we got to try the Poke on the AYCE menu (limit 1 order each). 
There was this roll with a sliver of jalapeno on top and sriracha that was freakin the best.. just can't remember the name of it. 

Service-wise they were all awesome.. perhaps it was because we were a party of 7  and for groups of 5+ there's an automatic service charge of 18% so be advised of that.. but honestly they deserved it because they were so friendly and on it with the refills of drinks and the plates came out to us fast AF.

3754684,2011-11-17,1,DzKl51tivGJMLiNsQqf38w,"So my review is based upon some malasadas that the hubby brought home from  Vegas.

What are Malasadas say you? Malasada is a Portuguese type donut.  Malasadas are made of egg-sized balls of yeast dough that are deep-fried in oil and coated with granulated sugar. They are popular in Hawaii and since Las Vegas is considered the ""9th Island"" you can definitely find them in Vegas...  I was craving the famous Leonard's malasadas found in Oahu, so when my husband visited the in-laws in Vegas, I asked him to find some of these yummy treats and bring some back home to the Bay Area.

My only concern was the fear of being disappointed by what he brings back... boy was I happy!  He came back with some haupia filled Malasadas that felt like it weighed half a pound each.  Haupia is a type of coconut custard, and it was perfect inside these warm slightly crispy Malasadas.  The custard was not too sweet, therefore, i scarfed down like 4 of them... *oops!* **blush**was I supposed to save some for the kids? Overall, they are still not as good as Leonard's but they definitely ""fit the bill"" when it came to cravings..

Ordered a bunch of sushi: albacore, tuna, white tuna etc. The fish was a teeny tiny very thin slice of fish on a very large piece of cold, hard rice. I had trouble swallowing the sushi. The quality of fish was ok. I got the dinner price and ordered the crab salad and the sashimi salad, compared to some of the other AYCE sushi joints, the sashimi salad is tiny, and only had very few pieces of fish. Really disappointing quality compared to the other places. Also, I ordered the sweet shrimp which only came with 1 piece, other sushi places gives 2 pieces and charges less.

He swore that he had done his best to oversell the place not just to us, but to many other people, and that nobody had ever been disappointed. Well...he was right. This place is amazing!

Normally, all you can eat sushi is more a matter of finding a place with decent sushi rather than anything great. But Island Sushi is simply fantastic. From the service to the food, I can't believe how good it was!

I'll admit, pulling up to this place, I was somewhat skeptical. It was pretty dark from the outside and didn't even really appear to be open. Even after coming inside, the initial welcome room was dark and pretty void of people. But once we got into the main eating area, it was on!

I knew that we were in for a treat when the sashimi salad and poke bowl came out. I could have eaten nothing but those two and been extremely happy. But my friend was ordering all of his favorites, and we ate all of them happily. The nigiri was perfect--a better ratio of fish to rice than most places. The cooked dishes we had, including soft-shelled crab, tempura shrimp, and beef of a couple of different varieties (one of which was right at the top of the best dishes there) were all perfectly cooked. I probably could have made a meal out of any individual dish I was served, so to have so many different delicious items made for a great experience. Dessert was pretty decent, too. You get your choice of 2 desserts (because you need 2 desserts after all you can eat sushi!), and they're all pretty interesting. There were 2 dishes involving bananas; any place that offers banana desserts gets points in my book.

The service was fantastic. I'm used to waiting long periods of time at any sushi restaurant, much less an all you can eat sushi restaurant, for each round of orders. But Island Sushi was bringing out dishes left and right, as they were prepared. We had a constant stream of food and were never left waiting. Excellent, friendly service!

And price-wise, this place is great. It's only around $25 for all you can eat (although they do limit the quantity of certain dishes that you can order).

First off, this place is the pits. I've been coming here for a while now, and I've experienced quality degrade. The more I come, the less I want to be here. Today is the final nail in the coffin. 

What a long wait time to even order food! I was in line for a good 7 minutes before I was given attention to place an order. 

Prices are outrageous! For what I got, I would have preferred any other Hawaiian restaurant that's more filling and has better quality.

I got the garlic chicken and chicken katsu combo. My mom got a saimin. So what's easier? Two pieces of different styles of chicken and frying it, or putting noodles, some toppings in a bowl with broth? You tell me...

I got mine in 7 minutes after ordering and was told the saimin will be right out. Great! Then, we waited 7/8 more minutes before requesting a refund. I don't like eating in front of other people, and I don't like waiting so long for something so easy. From the time we ordered to the time I requested a refund... 30 minutes. There was a little wait to ask for a refund. 

Maybe I was a little impatient, but don't bring out other people's order when a part of a party has already received their food and the rest haven't. Don't forget to season your customers' food. 

We ended up going to Aloha Kitchen on Sunset road and it was only 7 minutes from the time we ordered for it to be bagged ready to go. And they were equally as busy as this failure.

The saving grace which allows for two really generous stars are for their malasadas and their poke. Besides that, you have plenty of Hawaiian favorites to choose from, don't go here if you want to wait and want to eat tasteless food.",ZTylbqm8egU1UJ_lw8cTHg,1,0,2,SFppGc74Ajr_EmCgG-Ejbw

We had a one year old baby with us who is very picky with food so we had to bring fries with us from a fast food restaurant. The woman who brought us to our table told us that we cannot have outside food inside Island Sushi but I explained to her that it is just food for the baby and to please just let us keep it. She said she would have to ask her manager if that was okay. She spoke to the manager and he came to our table and told her our baby can't keep the food because it is their ""policy"". So for the next hour, our baby just sat there hungry while everyone ate. 

So we ordered our food and our first roll got to our table. But none of us can eat because they didn't provide any plates. We sat for a while waiting for someone to come by and nobody came. My sister stood up and went to the front and told them we didn't have plates. They took 5 mins after to finally bring plates. Next, they brought my niece's fish but she couldn't eat it because they didn't bring any forks. We waited again for someone to come by and after 5 minutes, my husband stood up to ask for forks at the front. And it kept getting worse. We ordered rice with the fish but that didn't come until 15 minutes later after the fish. The miso soups didn't come until 20 minutes after we ordered (which if you go to sushi restaurants often, you know that's the first thing they place on your table). They did not give wasabi and ginger until we asked for it (again, sushi restaurants ALWAYS give this automatically) and when they gave us the wasabi, it didn't come with any bowls so my husband had to get up again to the sushi table to ask for one. In total, our family had already gotten up 3 times to ask for stuff. Halfway done through our food, we had to remind them that they still haven't brought 2 rolls that we ordered. Only the manager checked up on us once. Nobody else asked if we needed anything, which is weird considering there were only about 20 people in the restaurant so they weren't that busy for us to be ignored. 

Worse yet, the food was horrible. The sushi tastes like the refrigerated ones you can buy at grocery stores. The raw fish were thin and dry. We paid half price for them because of Happy Hour but even so, their sushi is not worth it. 

Never coming back to this place again. The only good thing about this place is that the employees were friendly, the manager especially. My guess is that they're just unorganized and forced to follow stupid rules by the owner.",ARKq3KFac2vYXEzyuz1Odg,0,0,1,txyUkH__ngPbkN7cl2oyoA

I was really impressed with the flavors of the sushi and the taste of the food served here.  Of the three other ""all-you-can-eat"" sushi restaurants in Henderson, I have discovered Island Sushi to top it all!  You won't be disappointed!  

One thing that I really enjoyed was that they do not flood each roll of sushi with white rice!  You get a significant amount of ""filling"" and ""topping"" on each of the rolls you order!  They aren't being cheap at all!

One suggestion to the fellow yelpers is to come on Sunday!  Those Sunday specials are a steal and are very delicious, particularly the Ahi Belly!

So I took the wife and kids and we went along with what was recommended, ""ALL YOU CAN EAT SUSHI"" for $24.95!!!  Just two servings of the AHI POKI pays for it self already, and that's just the appetizer.  I would also recommend Joe's Special roll, Ahi Fever, and the Island Special roll.  

As for the kids, we were able to make it there before 5 PM so they had their usual California roll (my boys are 3 and 5 and already eating sushi!) and some Ebi sashimi.  After the meal we treated ourselves with some Malasada to go.

I've been coming here quite often to get my sweet taste of home here in Henderson and I do approve! I mean nothing beats some of the joints back at home, but this place is great!

If you are every craving poke or Hawaiian or local food (yes, there is a difference between Hawaiian and local food), then this is a wonderful spot to go to. 

I've been to both the plate lunch side and the sushi side and both are great dining options. The sushi side is especially good during happy hour where all of the rolls are 50% off! I believe happy hour is Mon-Wed all day! It's a great deal for delicious sushi. They also have an AYCE option but I've never tried it yet since I usually just go for happy hour!

As for the plate lunch side, I've had the bento boxes (which are really filling) and the spicy tuna bowl which I am a fan of, especially the taro chips inside.

The poke is also not bad. I really enjoyed the spicy tuna avocado one. The fish was good quality and had a nice texture but I wished there were more fish/avocado and less of the spicy mayo.

Our server, Mariah, was there quickly with menus, took our drink orders, and brought us our iced teas quickly.  She answered the questions we had about items we were considering.

We order two sushi rolls and two side dishes.  The sushi rolls were the standard California roll and a Lava Lover roll which the menu describes as a spicy tuna cucumber roll topped w/ cajun ahi, chili paste & garlic ponzu.  Both rolls were good.  The more interesting of the two was the Lava Lovers roll.  It was not very spicy and carried just a small kick--wasabi being a good addition to the heat for me.

The two sides were mochiko chicken and teriyaki beef.  This was only the second time I had mochiko chicken and I liked it better than the first time I had it elsewhere.  There was not sweet sauce on the chicken.  Rather, it was served plain which was good.  The teriyaki beef was good with a topping of sesame seed for decoration and a small amount of flavor.

We couldn't leave without some dessert.  My friend ordered mango mochi and I got the malassada sundae.  My sundae was very good.  The malassada and the ice cream may have been overkill calorie wise, but ti was very tasty!

I checked out their case and I know where I can buy poke in the future without having to drive to North Las Vegas where I got it once before.

The slow roasted pork loco moco was really tender and they gave a pretty generous amount (4 big slices)! it's served on a bed of white rice, covered in delicious brown gravy and topped with your choice of egg. It also comes with a side of macaroni! Such a great portion! 
The sushiritto is made fresh to order, so it makes it so much more yummy! It is made tempura - style, so there's a nice crunch to every bite!

The fish is all very fresh and delicious.  The best part about the rolls and nigri is that they dont overload the rice and give a good balance of fish and rice, so you aren't getting ripped off.  You also get a variety of appetizers to choose from, and I highly recommend the fried geso (squid/octopus) and the garlic chicken.  Super good!

If you like crispy fried chicken and garlic, this dish is for you!  It is delicious and will. make you want to come back for more!  The mini size is just the right portion for me.

2. Order from the Poke Express section complete with all your poke needs from Ahi, Salmon, Shrimp, Special combinations, and even cucumber kim chi for your veggie requirements.  My favorites are the Special Combination poke, and the Furikake poke.  The raw fish is fresh, and you can order by the 1/2 pound.  This gets pretty pricey though, and you can get pretty full if you just order a 1/2 pound of poke and maybe a 1/2 pound of cucumber kim chi.  Good for the no carb dieters!

3. Sit down in their sushi restuarant and order sushi.  This I can't comment on because I haven't actually ordered from their menu.   

My stars are strictly for option 1 and 2.  If I try option and 3 and love it, I'll add my 5th star.  I'll be back for sure!!!!

SERVICE
We had a server named Marc who was just awesome! He was attentive and after telling him that it was our first time there, he ordered some of the most popular appetizers and rolls for us to try. They were all terrific!

FOOD
While our server was super amazing, kitchen people were super slow. We waited over 30 minutes for our sushi. Yes I understand the place was packed but I've never waited that long at a sushi place. I was surprised to see that for AYCE, you only get 90 minutes limit. LOL are you kidding me. Half the time is spent waiting for food. Anyways, appetizers were good but sushi was ok. Some of my favorites were:

-Poke Roll
-Garlic chicken (must try)
-Salad (pieces of tuna and salmon in it. It was delicious!)
-Joe's special

I felt like some of the sushi weren't that fresh. Having raised in Japan, I've had some good sushi and know what fresh sushi taste like-this wasn't it.

CONCLUSION
Not the best but not the worst either. If you are not willing to wait 30 minutes for some sushi, I suggest Makinos for no wait & fresh sushi!",mEzc6LeTNiQgIVsq3poMbg,1,1,4,0H-8VJ28TUrluW28sy3vJg

I was going to meet a friend at another sushi spot nearby but when she got there she told me they were closed and open only at night.  I told her to drive further north towards my favorite intersection in LV (215/Eastern) because I've always wanted to try Sunday brunch at Island Sushi.

We both had all you can eat, we had dinner pricing because we wanted some of the dinner only items as well.  They have a special Sunday Brunch pupus menu and I pretty much ordered all of it.  The one item per person on the pupus menu, crab poke something, had a nice spice kick to it and it's basically a small crab cut in half with that spicy sauce. 

I'm the unlimited mimosas champagne, I mean champion, and I had that here as well.  Keep it coming man, keep pouring it.  Unfortunately the restaurant was busy and so service was spotty.  Luckily we sat on the table at the far south east end so servers always passed us but even so, it was somewhat hard to get their attention.  But back to my mimosa, I started with the guava mimosa and it just didn't work.  I ended my next 6 refills with regular champagne.  The thick guava syrup was just too sweet and settled on the bottom of the glass.

Most of my visits to Island Sushi & Grill have been to pick up to go orders (and poke from Poke Express, located in the back) and these experiences have always been solid. To-go orders have always been ready when they said they would be, packaged up properly and handed over by a smiling employee. 

On my most recent visit I took 3 out of towners:
My brother-in-law and his wife aren't big on sushi so they got items from the grill side of the menu while a friend and I both did ACYE. Pricing for AYCE is in line with most spots in town. There are some limitations on the menu (the standards: certain items can only be ordered at dinner, some are limited to one per person, no sharing). All of the sushi we ordered was excellent, nigiri was cut well and had a good fish to rice ratio. My in-laws were pleased with their selections, and we all left happy and very full for a great price.

Service: I've hit up their ayce sushi bar for Sunday brunch, weekend and weekday nights. The staff has always been GREAT! I'll usually sit at the sushi bar and the chefs are all cool but I want to give a shout out to Juan.  He's a great sushi chef who is friendly and is quick with getting your order out.  THe wait staff is awesome with keeping the bottomless mimosas or beers coming which I'll usually pair up with the ayce sushi.  There's a TV and they'll change the channel to the games you request as you throw down ayce and bottomless booze.

AYCE Sushi:  The Nigiri is always on point and I've never had a bad experience.  Everything we order is great but these are my favs: Yuzu Yellowtail, Salmon, Super White Tuna, Squid and the Garlic Tuna.  The Mount Charleston is bomb: California roll smothered with Spicy baked scallops and eel sauce.  Nigiri game is strong af here, everything is solid.

Ambiance: There's two parts to Island Sushi:  Pick up window dining and sit-down restaurant dining.  The Sushi Bar is in the Sit down restaurant which is directly to your right after you enter the Pick Up dining area.  The restaurant area is small and they pack a lot of tables so it's going to be noisy but nothing to derail from the dining experience.

This is my go to casual AYCE sushi joint.  Staff, service and the sushi has never failed me and I appreciate the consistency throughout the years.  It always seems to be crowded with regulars which is a testament to their performance so waits for parties of 5+ can occur.  However, if the sushi bar is empty, it's an easy sit down with no wait.  Keep up the great work Island Sushi, Mahalo! =)",AyjqBovADgbskmLrIBOMlQ,3,2,5,B0hoYR7xgDR_JhHJYDM2LQ
4062829,2015-07-28,0,DzKl51tivGJMLiNsQqf38w,"Big fan but very inconsistent. Sometimes my rice in my nigiri is small, other times it's the biggest ball of rice on this side of the Rockies.  Not in anyway demeaning the quality of fish or sides, but the rice to be honest, not that good. It's almost as if there is something added to the rice that just shouldn't be there. The rice to me, tastes funny, and I never complain because of how polite I am. So I will give them three stars until the quality and consistent size of rice improves.

Terry,

Fish is always great. Love the white tuna, hamachi, and unagi. I try to taste at least one order of each. Rice machines are great. Which is why I have upped my review to four stars.  All this place needs to get to five stars is top notch service. I feel like I come sometimes and the line will be out the door but tables and the bar are open.  Sushi Chefs are top notch and are always great.

On top of all that she over charged us on our drinks and I when I tried explaining it to her she ignored me and started talking to another person in our party WHILE I WAS STILL TALKING. She rudely said ""fine I'll take it off the bill"". Are you serious!?!? Wth is that? 

After she had someone else drop of the revised bill she NEVER came back to pick it up! Our entire party of 15 left because we were waiting so long and me and my wife ended up waiting by our selves until we finally decided to walk up to the cash resister and asked if someone could ring us up.

4148369,2018-05-31,0,DzKl51tivGJMLiNsQqf38w,"BEWARE of ordering off their CATERING menu. I paid $90 for a FULL tray of Teriyaki Beef. I ended up with a HALF tray of Teriyaki-4 lbs of cooked Teri Beef. Menu says it can feed 25-30 people. Definitely NOT TRUE. What they fail to tell you is the FULL tray of Teri Beef is half in height-in essence NOT a FULL tray of beef. What a total disappointment!!! I ordered for my daughters graduation party and did not have enough for all my guests. 

Also, my order was picked up at 1030am. Shrya called me at 1130am to ask when I would be picking up my order? She said it was still there. Which leads me to believe they gave me the wrong order. I spoke to Lee and he didn't help matters. 

So basically, DO NOT order any catering from them. It is a HUGE ripoff. I paid $90 for 4lbs of Teri Beef. Terrible Service and false advertising!

This is my reply to Owner-Terrence Fong
seems like a good excuse to me. I missed Steve's phone call as I was hosting a graduation party and trying to figure out how I would make up for the shortage of Teri Beef. 

It is a FACT that the tray was  NOT up to value. No where on the catering menu did it say ""Full Tray is 8lbs"". That to me equals-FALSE Advertising. I also purchased a FULL TRAY of Deluxe Noodles and guess what? That tray weighed a lot more than 8 lbs. What is your excuse for that? 

I always try to support local businesses. But, how can I when this is he result. Very sad that you decided to respond this way instead of trying to making it right. AUWE!

Upon entering, the first section you're in is their bake shop where you can order malasadas and wonderful treats like cocoa puffs.  To the right is the main dining area.  You can choose to order a la carte style or AYCE.  From their regular menu, we ordered their garlic chicken, mochiko chicken, and fried noodles.  ALL TASTED GREAAAAT!  From their sushi menu, we ordered ahi poke (tuna), tako poke (octopus), ebi (shrimp), ika (squid), masago (smelt roe), unagi (fresh water eel), amaebi (sweet shrimp), and their uni (sea urchin).  We also ordered a few specialty rolls.  All were very good and fresh!  Just writing this review makes me want to drive 4 hours just to eat here!  Okay, back to their review.  Their friendly staff did a great job in making sure we had enough food and when we would place an order, the food came out fresh and quick.  This AYCE isn't your typical buffet where you get up and serve yourself.  Your server comes around and you would inform them what menu item you'd like to order.  Simple as that!  When the place gets extremely busy, they have a 90 min. time limit.  The rules are noted on each table.  However when we were there, it was pretty packed and we stayed their longer than 90 minutes.  I guess they don't want you to practically live there and live off of their awesome food.  Also, they don't like it when you waste their awesome sushi.  So order accordingly.  It's an AYCE, so pace yourself.  DO NOT ORDER RICE OR ELSE YOU WILL GET FULL FAST!  For each person, it's about $24.  Don't come here expecting to eat crab legs all day.  For $24, that is a VERY good deal for fresh and great tasting sushi.  Their AYCE menu is extensive.  Did I mention that their mochiko and garlic chicken are both delicious?

Our cousin said this place has bomb custard pie! If you're from Hawaii, you're used to getting bomb custard pie from Zippy's and Foodland or any other average Hawaii grocery store. Here in Vegas, custard pie isn't such a hot commodity, so when Your Cousin says ""custard pie"", you just reply, ""lead the way""! 

We arrived on a Saturday afternoon at around 1pm. The place was semi-packed, we were rushing so we opted for the take-out side of the restaurant. I ordered the kalua pig with poke plate, we shared a custard pie and a side of chicken katsu. 

When you walk in, the place is kind of confusing...to the right you'll see a sign in sheet on a table with a sign directing Wait to Be Seated, straight ahead at the end of the take out side of the restaurant you'll see an ordering window with Poke Bowl only menu, and to the left you'll see the take out window with bakery showcase! 

I was overwhelmed by all the signage, I just picked a seat and waited for my other half to order us lunch. It took a while to get our order but it was clear that the place was busy. Our food was good, I like that they had shoyu for us on the side next to the soda machine. I also like that they have free refills in the self serve soda machine.

With the new car rental terminal thingy being miles away from the airport, I got lost and wound up going the wrong direction in search of the Strip. Don't laugh at me. I'm horrible with my bearings once I get anywhere, but once I get my internal GPS going, I'm good to go.

At any rate, we wound up consulting our Garmin to look for a sushi place and were actually looking for Koto Sushi (never been, but hell it came up on our search so why the hell not), but found that was Island Sushi instead. Scared as hell that sushi can be either BOMB or ASS, we entered in and knew that it wasn't all bad when everyone, well, almost everyone except us, were island folk! No shit! I was thrilled because you want to go to a restaurant that has the people there. Go to a Chinese restaurant that doesn't have chinese people? Are you high? Anyways, real Hawaiians, real ono food, you heard?

Husbandido ordered the chirashi and was NOT disappointed. Was thrilled when he couldn't finish it (take that SF chirashi!) and saw just how much rice there was to offer. I ordered chicken katsu dinner and lo and behold it came with dessert (808 special is a must have, people). So I give them mad props. I frequent SF sushi just as regularly as I frequent my home, and it's nice to find good, solid sushi and grinds as I would at home. I would dare to say not necessarily just good...but maybe better!

I highly recommend this, even if you're not lost. It's worth a drive out, and it's not too far off the freeway to scare the crap out of you.  You will definitely have enough scratch to hit the casinos afterward. Two hungry people fresh from the plane? $34. Baller status.

It's great because you can specify whether or not you want mac salad, all rice, etc. Then you can specify the time you want the pick up and you can also pay online. So easy!

All I have to say now is, get over here and try it. Even if you are not from Hawaii, you will love the food! Don't be afraid to try anything and everything!

I am usually super duper disappointed with the AYCE sushi places bc they tend to limit the menu to certain items and they're usually items that I do not like... NOT HERE! Liked it all! They had my favs and usuals, scallop roll, poke, and garlic tuna. Poke was good and they give a nice size amount for one serving, garlic tuna had too much ginger and the scallops were cooked, not what I'm used to but they were all pretty tasty. The dessert was pretty good on the AYCE too. I think it was called the Island Special, basically ice cream and fruit. Simple but refreshing! 

The quality of the sushi was good, service was good and the restrooms were clean but c'mon, put some hand soap in the bathroom! They had a sink and paper towels but no soap, what in the heck?! Sorry, had to knock a star off for that, I'm a level 4 germ-a-phobe so it was real bothersome that I had to use my hand sanitizer rather than use what's supposed to be available to you by health department standards. 

One other thing that I was pretty disappointed with what that this place is called Island Sushi and a majority of the people that come in to eat here get AYCE sushi but-- they didn't include the malasadas in the AYCE Menu. Not a big deal but I would've rather have had them... Been awhile since I've had them :(

Word to the wise... You have to decide whether or not you want AYCE right away, they're sticklers for it. My sister-in-law ordered edamame and then decided that she wanted AYCE after the order had been put in and and they said that they had to charge her for it because they ""can't"" change it out.",77lef7kKkoOVupY-7AmieQ,2,1,4,xXywwpy4yu4vTm3cDAqrRA

This review is for their grill side since I have not gone to their sushi spot in years so can't judge it. The grill side has a small amount of seating,  but it's set up more for takeout while the sushi side is more of a restaurant.   I do recall the sushi side had half off happy hour prices on certain days,  so I recommend investigating that before you go for that specifically. 

So back to the grill... First of all this place is the best place to get poke.  Super fresh, great selection of flavors,  and although I have only ordered by the pound, I saw they now also hopped onto the poke bowl and burrito band wagon.  

Their mac salad is possibly my favorite of all the Hawaiian restaurants in town,  and their garlic chicken is fried perfectly, so juicy, while packing a level of flavor that makes me happy dance when I devour it.

One item you can't miss is their malasadas,  it is a Portuguese donut that became popular and adopted in Hawaiian cuisine.   Fluffy round donuts rolled in sugar, and I always get mine filled with custard.   Their vanilla custard is so perfect and creamy.  It's honestly my favorite donut in the valley.  I have tried the haupia filling, but I found it a bit bland, and had a slightly off taste. 

Overall this is the most solid Hawaiian restaurant I have been to,  and I find myself craving it often. Even when I go visit Hawaii I find myself preferring items here, so they are legit,  and I am so glad I live by them.",XYZw8rWQ0wjMWQChRCU8Hg,1,1,5,qsNDSFkKOu4VLzj5xAhbZQ

Probably because I don't have the scooops with the peeps at island sushi. 3) they weren't even busy when we went but service was slow and unacceptable. 4) I have notice their quality in their tuna and it's something I don't recommend.

4413156,2017-09-07,0,DzKl51tivGJMLiNsQqf38w,"Needed my ""fix"" for some local grindz while in Vegas and chose Island Sushi & Grill because of the favorable ratings on Yelp.  Drove 16 miles (32 roundtrip) from DTLV out to ISG just to satisfy my yearning.  For the most part I wasn't disappointed, but I wasn't ""overly"" impressed.  

It's a relatively clean place, but reminiscent of a local hole-in-the-wall diner back in the 808 - similar seats, stools, tables and floors.  Dine-in customers are still provided their meals in takeout containers, so that was a bit of a surprise. Typical local style, riiight?  Luckily the transplanted ""Hawaiian"" community hankering for island flavors are probably keeping this place open and in business.  

I had the regular loco moco and my cousin had the poke chirashi. I love the fact that they make their own hamburger patties as the flavor was very good. The gravy was not generic and a nice change from what one might get at L&L. The mac salad was actually potato/mac, which anyone from the 808 would notice off the bat, so that was a nice distinction.  

The poke bowl my cousin had was excellent. But, for the amount of poke provided it was priced maybe $2 more than it should have been.  It was good poke, no doubt...buuut, maybe a slightly bigger bowl for that price. This is why I won't eat at Tanioka's or Yama's Fish Market back on Oahu...

So why not 5 stars? Aside from the ambience (SO retro-local), it was the service we received...  Sorry.  Maybe because I'm in the service industry, but the staff - who look like kids of transplanted islanders - could perhaps meet/greet customers in a more friendlier tone and be a smidge more attentively as well.  It was taking a while for my plate, so I went back to the register and lo and behold, 3 workers chichatting in the kitchen about something with my order just sitting there. When one of them noticed me, he asked my name (???). WOW, how genius...we were the only ones in there - aside for some private party in the adjoining room. 

Anyways, aside from service and price, this is a good place for local Hawaiians needing their 808 food fix.  Try it and enjoy...",7tWmAqPAPt20wE3Mj0PeIA,0,0,4,SKUrAgPKtdb99j-XKwnTEw

I'm easy to please and usually let things slide but the way she treated my partner and I actually bothered me. I'm not sure if she was having a bad day or if she was too busy but she should know better than to slam customers' meals on the table and she also didn't explain which order is which that I had to go up and ask another server which bento had mochiko chicken and which had garlic chicken. No one there seemed welcoming AT ALL.

I'm more likely to return since I loved the food but I really DON'T want to experience a repeat of that shitty service. The ALOHA spirit here during this one visit was nonexistent. First impressions are LASTING impressions so I'll take a deep breath and kind of expect bad service here again even though I love the food.",Sosl51bdhJYt8Yh9B614pw,7,0,3,ZZYanQPC05vfWNmNHFV4tg

The service was horrible, to the point where I kinda just wanted to up and leave. We ordered our food and after 20 minutes there was still no food. I gave them some leeway as we ordered a lot of dishes and it was kinda busy. Around the 30 minute mark our food came out but by that point we were already kind of annoyed. I spied at the corner of my eye that a table that got there after I did had gotten their food on the spot and that annoyed me even more. After we had finished our food there we wanted to order again but waving down to staff to give our ticket too was impossible. By this point a lot of the other tables had left and there weren't that many people anymore which left me confused as to why they couldn't see my hand waving a piece of paper in front of their faces. They also missed some of our orders and we left rushed and disappointed.

My friend just got back in town and we wanted to catch up over sushi and sake. I Love Sushi (also on Eastern) is our usual go to but I suggested to be adventurous and try somewhere new!

When you first walk in I believe you're in Poke Express, a separate quick service restaurant inside Island Sushi. There is a place to order to the left and casual seating straight ahead. To the right is an entrance that opens up to Island Sushi which is a pretty small restaurant. We waited to be seated and the host said it would be about 30 min for a table. We decided to get started on sake at the bar and was seated at a table shortly after. 

We weren't starving so we ordered a la carte rather than AYCE. I had the spicy garlic edamame, tuna poke, and a spicy tuna hand roll. The tuna wasn't very fresh in either of my tuna entrees. Hand roll was pretty tasteless, so I doused it in soy sauce/wasabi. The tuna poke was highly disappointing!! It wasn't flavorful and the texture of the tuna honestly felt like it sat out for a few hours. Some pieces were dry and chewier than the norm. The tuna was on a bed of seaweed salad, which was also dry. SO dry that when I tried to gather some seaweed salad with my chopsticks, I picked up ALL of the seaweed salad in an large chunk instead. 

The spicy garlic edamame wasn't bad, but didn't taste extraordinary enough to make me want to come back to this place...

No complaints with the service, however, the dishes I tried here weren't memorable or enjoyable. Doubtful I'll return.",WJhQpdUHoFCtpU6gHFjVlQ,9,4,2,rn4prv1URhH37DDkSq7XWw

In the past month and a half, I've come to realize I've come back to this place 4 times. The food is delicious and amazingly priced. That's something that is hard to get around. But one thing that has always stuck with me in importance above everything else is customer service. 

I'm not easy to deal with sometimes. Not because I have an attitude, but because I can be an annoyingly picky eater. For that reason, it is easy to see frustration and eye rolling in a situation where someone would have to press a couple extra buttons to modify an order in a job they don't exactly enjoy.

I can tell at least for a Kapua, Chase, and Gino, that this is not only a job they enjoy, but an atmosphere that has already made me feel welcome like family. They have already remembered me by name, they have went out of their way to make recommendations, check on myself and the friends I have brought with me, and have yet to make any visit any less than fantastic. The three of them have been an invaluable asset to the restauraunt and  instrumental factors regarding my three returns, and all the returns after this review that are to come.

The poke was amazing! I got the furikake, garlic, and spicy avocado. It's about 15-16 a pound for poke but definitely worth it! The slice of haupia cake was pretty good, maybe just a bit overpriced. I probably wouldn't get that again.

I personally wouldn't recommend the oxtail soup. I asked the girl and she said that they just heat it up when ordered. I paid about 12.50 and I got 3 good pieces of meat/bone. I'm not sure if it was because it wasn't fresh, but I don't think the flavor of the broth was too great.

We opted to sit down and were greeted with friendly and fast service as well as an extensive menu for fish and non-fish eaters. The AYCE option seem popular, but my husband choose the ahi avocado poke bowl (yum!!!) and I choose the teriyaki chicken combo, which is only $11 and comes with miso soup, a salad, edaname, chicken, rice, and dessert!!!

The thing that started to bother me was every time we grab our pick up order, they ALWAYS forget things. Whether it's our somen salad dressing or Mac salad. Or they mess up our order. And we don't notice it til we open everything up when we get home. We usually brush it off and don't mind.

But today when my boyfriend grabbed our food, our combo hamburger meal came with a drink. My boyfriend didn't know. And I told him when he came home that we should've gotten a small drink. And we laughed at the sign that was stuck on the bag. We were like, really? It said they aren't responsible for the orders once the food leaves the restaurant.

Being that we are regulars at this establishment, and that they are ALWAYS FORGETTING things for our order. This was a slap in the face. 

Why don't you guys just check the orders better. It's obvious this is a common mistake and that's why they put this note on all the food orders.

Las Vegas is dubbed an honorary island due to ""Local Kine"" diaspora/migration to the desert, and as a result, we get lots of Hawaiian eateries in the valley. Yay! I personally do not like macaroni salad, deep-fried rolls, any roll that contains cream cheese, and sweet sauces. All these preferences go against many Americanized sushi and Hawaiian food protocol. Take my review with a grain of salt. 

Their poke is delicious (at $10/lbs for takeout). Me and spicy food are like kindred spirits. I recommend the Lava Lover and Spicy Mexican. The standard Rainbow roll is tasty as well. The all-you-can-eat is a good deal, as long as you can grub until you burst. I love how the rolls aren't stuffed with rice like other places, but I don't like how many of the rolls are doused with this sweet sauce (miso? eel? ponzu? not sure) which was not pleasant and weird.

Ever since trying this joint out a couple years back, every trip to Vegas is not complete until we have a dinner at Island Sushi!  The staff is so friendly and attentive, the food tastes great, and the atmosphere just feels homey.

The latest time around, I decided to get only nigirizushi.  No rolls at all.  The menu for this AYCE is huge.  I had three rounds of several types of nigiri each round and still didn't make it thru the whole nigiri menu.  I didn't come across one I totally didn't like either.  Favorites would be the mackerel and the super white.  Oh so delicious.  

They have a huge appetizer menu as well.  For appetizers be sure to get a couple orders of the baked green mussels.  They add a little extra spiciness to theirs that make them so tasty.

If I remember correctly (from past visits) the rolls are pretty decent sized aren't heavy handed on the rice.  I like how they don't try to stuff you up with extra rice on rolls or even the nigirizushi.  They truly allow you an all you can eat experience.

Nothing ends a meal like a great dessert (again a decent size for an AYCE).  Only one per person, and you can't mix and match so, be sure to get the 808 special and the green tea ice cream.  Then you can have the 808 special with green tea ice cream!

The food: bomb. Quick. Not overly large rolls. The sushi chefs were nice and helpful. The specialty rolls were creative. Some new pairings I haven't seen before. The nigiri wasn't stingy on the fish. We had hamachi and salmon. Both were tender, fresh, and meaty.

One thing that was awesome about this place is that after 4 full rolls and 4 pieces of nigiri, the people were shocked we were ordering dessert. They wanted us to eat more. That says something about the service. They weren't trying to get us the fock out.

The first time I came here I had the Japanese breakfast (grilled mackerel, 2 eggs, miso soup, green tea).
This time, my two Hawaiian friends took Eric R. and I and another friend to the Hawaiian brunch!
It is all you can eat pupus (appetizers) and desserts for $17.95, add $3 for AYCE sushi!
We tried so many things.  We definitely loved the salmon lover roll.  Handrolls were okay (spider roll was overfried and came with krab which it wasn't supposed to but skipped kaiware and gobo which it was supposed to).  Nigiri was tiny but it is probably okay for AYCE since we could try more.  Saba wasn't my fave and that is usually my test of sushi quality.
For pupus we had so many things - eggplant ""fries"" with spicy miso, fried tofu, crispy rice cake with spicy tuna and avocado, strawberry salad, cold green tea soba, grilled ahi belly and green onions, ginger chicken lettuce wrap, kimchi fried rice, ahi poke, raw crab poke, Hawaiian sweet roll French toast, and so many other things I can't remember.  Desserts: 808 special (tempura banana, ice cream, strawberries), blueberry tiramisu, warm mango mochi and coconut ice cream....the list goes on.
I had iced green tea which was very good.  Service was decent considering the amount of groups and ordering tons of things.

Have to try the Island Special roll. Get 2. My fav thing about this place is the side dishes. Love the strawberry salad which has goat cheese and wonton crisps. The ahi poke is the best. Chicken lovers should try the chicken katsu and mochiko chicken. More must-try's: kimchee fried rice and pickled daikon & spicy tuna - so good!!

I ordered an Unagi Roll, a Spider Roll, and their Ahi Fever Roll. I started with the Unagi. It was OK in flavor, but it was very loosely put together to the point of falling apart. It's really not a big deal, but it does detract from the sushi experience. I then moved on to the Spider Roll. This was the roll that made me question this place. It was flavorless and the soft-shell crab was slightly burnt. After making it through that roll, I finally got to the Ahi Fever. Thankfully, this roll was actually pretty good. I'm glad I saved it for last.

My rating for this place would actually be 2.5 stars. I've definitely experienced better, but I would probably return anyway simply because of the prices.",YwaKGmRNnSa3R3N4Hf9jLw,1,2,2,kgNAqLT9rsk2QHm9eTFyaQ

Everything was fine until the end... When we're done eating we had some leftovers, we eat all you can eat sushi many times & understand how you may be fined if you leave leftovers. Our main server mentioned that we'd be charged for the leftovers. That was fine. She came back & told us a managers gona have to count each roll leftover. We were fine but getting impatient. Then ANOTHER server came to tell us that we'd be charged for the leftovers...OKAY Then to top it off she says, ""I know you guys are full but can you just eat the rest on that plate & we wont charge you for that one"" SERIOUSLY? Don't tell us what to eat especially if you know that we're full. But it doesn't end here folks. We split the bill in a certain way, the server ends up mixing the cards up & charging the wrong card to the wrong bill. We let her know its wrong. Instead of switching the cards to the correct bill.

4654962,2015-12-04,7,DzKl51tivGJMLiNsQqf38w,"Recently I have been an adventurous eater set out to explore the Hawaiian restaurants in the ninth island of Las Vegas. It all started with a few visits to L&L Barbecue that got me hooked on the Hawaiian plate lunch. On a couple of recent weekends, my adventures in dining led me to Island Sushi and Grill. 

   Island Sushi and Grill is located along the thriving Eastern Avenue Corridor south of Interstate 215 between the signalized Serene and Richmar intersections on the east side. It is in a small shopping center that doesn't draw much attention to the business. The first impression of Island Sushi and Grill from the outside is that it is a fancy sushi restaurant. It is a false impression because inside Island Sushi and Grill is a diverse dining experience. 

   Island Sushi and Grill is really two different restaurants that are divided into two rooms. The first room when you enter is a Hawaiin restaurant with pastries and take out sushi. There are a few long tables and two counters. The counter close to the door is where you order the Hawaiin food. The counter toward the back by the condiments and beverage machine is the sushi counter. The room to the right is a full service restaurant offering sushi and other entrees. In summary Island Sushi and Grill is a restaurant specializing in two areas of food: sushi and Hawaiin food. Pertaining to my experiences I experienced the plate lunch dinners on my two visits prior to penning this review/reporting of experiences. 

   On visit number one, I exchanged around $10 for a garlic chicken plate lunch with fountain beverage then a week later on visit number two, I exchanged around $10 on a chicken with eggplant plate lunch with fountain beverage. Being that they are plate lunches they included white rice and macaroni salad. The food was served in a styrofoam box that I brought to the table after they called my order. On both visits the chicken met my expectations. For safe measure, I added schirachi sauce to it just as I added soy sauce to the rice. L&L has far better macaroni salad and Ross J's  Aloha Hawaiian Barbecue serves far larger portions. This is the first restaurant that my food adventures led me that offered chicken with eggplant. It seemed to be chicken over eggplant with a lot of white rice around it and a little cup of macaroni salad nearby. 

   Being an adventurous eater, I foresee many more restaurants to explore. Before I set sail for further dining adventures, my report on dining two times in Island Sushi and Grill is that it is a three star  experience.",0tvCcnfJnSs55iB6mqPk3w,8,10,3,YWVaCD5dL6WHSW4aI61D2g

I had the Polish Sausage and not too much to say about it. Plate came with 2 scoops of rice, 2 slices of sweet bread and 2 eggs of choice. I felt that rice to meat ratio was off. SOOO much rice, which may be good for some but just felt that there wasn't enough sausage. 

Everything served on styro containers which makes it easy to To-Go any left overs. No one else was dining at the time we were there (Sunday morning at 9am) but there were few people who came in for pick up and even more at the Poke counter. 

What I would really like to RAVE about is the MALASADAS. I ordered the dozen (about $15) 6 plain, 2 custard filled, 2 choco filled and 2 haupia filled. I noticed they were pulled from a box stamped with there logo so I'm hoping this is there recipe and creation. I would die if I ever came and was told there were no more, waahhhhh ! Employee pulled out a large tub of custard and injected the plain ones.

 They were so delicious, I'm tempted to type the rest of this review in all CAPS. They were moist, chewy, fluffy and soft. After bringing them home and being kept in the fridge, we would nuke em' in the micro for 30 seconds and they were just HEAVEN. Not tough or rubbery at all. Knowing this has encouraged me to take home at least 2 dozen next time.

4677179,2010-09-16,3,DzKl51tivGJMLiNsQqf38w,"Looking at all the good review of this place, I have a high expectation.
Unfortunately, It's not as good as I expected.

Price is good, Monday-Tuesday 50 percent off for all the rolls, dine in only.
They have breakfast and get 20 percent off from 7 am to 10 am
Wednesday night, AYCE pay lunch price and get dinner value.

Quick summary of what I had:

Fried Tako and Octopus - overcook, taste a little bitter, it's been in the deep fryer too long.

Tuna poke - lots of tuna, very simple dish, pretty much tuna sashimi mix with seaweed salad. Nothing special

Kimchee tako, nothing special. Tako mix with kimchee..

Baked mussel. a little citrus flavor mix with spicy mayo baked. Not so special either...

Lomi Salmon, go get a salsa and mix it with salmon and salt. Not my favorite, can't finish it.

Miso soup, not good...

Sushi rolls looks not great, some rolls can't hold the shape, some okay. I will leave that to ""depends on the chef"".

Most rolls is okay, only 1 that I think is good. Island special roll. Other than that, just so so or not good.

Freshness, average 2-3 stars. Uni is the only one I think is okay.

Ama ebi not fresh, color has changed,
Deep fried head, not crispy enough, if it's not crispy enough, it's hard to enjoy the head. 

Beef teriyaki, better than expected. thin slice beef, tender with a little fat, almost like korean style beef barbeque.

Hamachi Kama, okay. Not too dry, a little crispy outside, pretty good.

Dessert is pretty good, creme brulee, 808 special (fried banana w ice cream), tempura ice cream. 

Service is pretty good, considering on how busy it was, they did pretty good job, refilling the drinks. Although, they don't remember which sushi goes to which person, they almost don't care actually. They should care a little bit if they want to have a 5 star service.

If this is a regular sushi restaurant, only deserve 2 stars, but considering how busy they were and an all you can eat restaurant, 3 stars sounds like a better fit.

When you come in, there's a counter for the Hawaiian a la carte food. Up ahead is the poke station. The room to the right is for AYCE sushi. I usually get the poke & it's the best in the valley, in my opinion. I get a fourth or half a pound of the spicy ahi with a side of rice with furikake. Soooo yums!! Their garlic chicken and spicy tuna bowl are fricken good too. 

Before my recent visit, I haven't been since like maybe a year? Or 6 months? I'm not really sure. But seems like the people behind the poke station are a bit slower pace.

I like to order the hand rolls with hamachi (yellowtail) and sake (salmon). Fresh and delicious. My favorite specialty rolls are the Black Widow, Dragon, Island Special, Tiger, Kahuku, and Pauhana.

We celebrated my dad's birthday there last May and it was also Mother's Day so we participated in the AYCE Sushi plus Sunday brunch. The special menu featured breakfast favorites like pancakes and mimosas. There were also additional desserts that were unlimited like cream puffs and filled malasadas (they were both so, so good).

This is BY FAR the best Hawaiian food I've eaten in Las Vegas.  Most places I've been have been similar by and large, but this place excels.  I'll comment on my favorite dish: Kalbi

Kalbi is basically the same thing as Korean-style short ribs.  The meat is tender and is flavor-packed with each bite.  I could eat two portions without blinking an eye and I can't really eat a lot of red meat.  

My other favorite thing that I crave is their macaroni salad.  The macaroni salads I get at most Hawaiian places are usually very similar and for the most part a little too mayonnaisy for me... good, but mayonnaisy.  

The macaroni salad here is PERFECT.  First off, it's like a mix between potato salad and macaroni salad and not oozing mayo.  

Now that I'm back in this area I will be going a lot more.

This time I tried the Classic Loco Moco and it was by far the best Loco Moco I've ever eaten.  The hamburger steak you can tell was made in-house and was absolutely delicious and super tasty gravy.",qmYullp32aXFUr8WMVFrOA,0,0,5,4BKS7QdsrU2QpLwFv0Z7CA

The first time my boyfriend and i sat at the sushi bar for late night happy hour which is from 9-close.  Half priced rolls and 1.50 for beers! Even imports like sapporo.
My Favorite roll that i had to go back for was the alaskan roll. They put ikura on top which is a delicious twist.  So we ordered 4 rolls and my boyfriend had a beer and our bill was $20.  unbeatable price.  The sushi is good, and even really good for a local joint,  but i give it four stars b/c quality wise, it cant compete with places like nobu.
The second time we tried out the grill part of the restaurant.  We ordered the saimen combo with garlic chicken and loco moco.  The loco moco was awesome.  The saimen, was so so, i've had a lot better.  The garlic chicken was also delicious.  
The 3rd time we went back for the sushi happy hour and it was great.  We started with the tuna poke and miso soup, both very good.  Four sushi rolls and 3 beers.  The bill was thirty something dollars.

We got seated after 5 minutes of standing there, to the right through the shower curtain doors there was a hole in the wall sit down area. The little plates that they put on the table are cute but the little bowl for the soy sauce isn't even big enough to dip a piece of sushi.  Then when you finally figure it out the soy sauce didn't even taste like soy sauce. So I asked for kikkoman soy sauce and three different waitresses passed us by never bringing the kikkoman. We had to ask 3 different waitresses to finally get the soy sauce. So I sat and watched our waitress flirt and laugh with the other table as I was patiently waiting to get some soy sauce to eat my sushi. Wow. To top it off she left a table of 5 people (us) with a tiny dish of ginger and wasabi.... not nearly enough. When we were ready to leave we had to ask for our check and Togo box and wait... All the while another waitress acknowledges us and tells us that if we want to take our 8 pieces of sushi that we had left she was going to charge us full price (we came during happy hour). Wow. Never again, I'll take my business elsewhere, thanks but no thanks.... it didn't even taste all that great. I would rather drive 10 minutes to Samurai sushi, for half price all day long, then ever step foot in that hell hole again.",O4jEU1IsyccHMLZnOhkpzA,5,1,1,HceZ1xj9OZDQsK31tY-PWA

I love the ayce offerings. Its pretty much everything on the menu, including the daily specials. The only items it doesn't allow is sashimi. You can get soups, salads, appetizers, sushi rolls, entrees, and desserts. There is no way you can leave here hungry!

My favorite items are the garlic edamame, 007, and mona loa. Today they also had an apple cobbler for dessert which was fantastic!

i like that they have a ""local foods"" (fast food) side and a ""sushi side"" (full service). the fast food side serves the regular island style fast food (my favorites - roast pork, garlic ahi, garlic noodles, mochiko chicken, garlic chicken and loco moco) and the  mend the weekend brunch) and bentos and combination plates, and alcohol of course. their bento boxes are a great deal! soup, salad, edamame, cali roll, and your choice of side items (i normally get a 3 item bento box with hamachi sashimi, mochiko chicken and salmon teri and if i remember right its only $17) and you get dessert!!! (i recommend the malasada sundae or the 808 special. both reeeeally good!!!

we went in on superbowl sunday for their AYCE. we caught it just in time for brunch, and their selection was perfect! its different every week, but we were lucky to try their ribs. soooo good!!! i like that they include AYCE desserts too. green tea tiramisu and creme brulee are favorites!!!

island sushi has tons of bakery items, as well as poke express, where they sell many different kinds of poke by weight, and make them to order.

now that im not on that side of town, i crave their food all the time. i try to come back as often as i can though! 

i almost forgot - service is great! everyone is very nice and theyre really attentive to their guests, more so on the sushi side. probably best service i've had for AYCE sushi.",_Q7yi_5LzFIb1ny2hpfyYg,1,0,5,FEXk5Zgo43FgCILQqq6q3g

In the past I've had the avocado poke bowl which I 1000% recommend to my fish-eating friends out there. 

This is truly just quality sushi and service. Fresh rice and fish! You can't go wrong.

So this will be an initial review because the only item we got here was the poke.

Location 5/5: So the 5 rating is if you live in the south part of the valley. It's also very easily accessible, right off the 215 on eastern, you'll head south on eastern and its about a quarter mile to the left behind Taco y Taco, and Smashburger.

Da Local 4/5: its a little bit confusing when you go inside, there is a sushi bar to the right, then the entrees as soon as you come in to the left, and finally the poke all the way in the back.

Customer Service 2/5: Even though I'm a Hapa Haole I didn't feel any of the love when walking in, the employees inside didn't greet us. While my wife and I were standing in front of the cashier trying to figure out where the poke bowls where at, non of the employees behind the counter tried to help us out. There were two guys standing behind the counter yet not a single one greeted us or offered his assistance.

Now when we figured out the poke stand was in the back, the lady there was very helpful and did an excellent job, because of her they get a 2/5.

Da Poke 5/5: Da poke was on point I got the spicy poke and it tasted da bomb, flavor so good it broke da mouth!!! My wife got the spicy tuna avocado, hers was just as good! the Flavor brought me right back to the islands. Something to mention about their poke which is very important is that their poke comes from POKE EXPRESS, located in North Vegas, Uncle makes the best Poke in the valley and its great that his poke make it all the way over here. 

PS: the presentation of the poke stand took me back to Tamuras.

Da Rice 3/5: it was alright nothing too yummy nothing too bad just alright, I wish they made sushi rice but hey now we know.

Da Price 5/5: In Oahu, if you go to tamuras a pound of spicy tuna poke is $15:99, here at this mainland establishment it's the same price! This made me so happy because the prices where the SAME!!! I was expecting this type of poke in the valley to be more expensive.

Overall go to this place if you live in the south part of the valley. My advice is to bring your own rice, Teri sauce, and crunch, then buy half a pound of poke and poke salad...now you have created your own poke bowl which will be the bomb as long as you know how to make bomb ass rice. 

If your looking for a really nice establishment but are not brown don't expect nice service here, you know what don't even expect them employees to even look at you. There is no Aloha here and that breaks my heart. Next time I go will be just to get the poke and then get go eat at home.",7KoN2yg19p6wwDg755Qtug,1,0,4,IXPX1hy7ch3a-U5M4NHaTg

4974379,2010-02-05,3,DzKl51tivGJMLiNsQqf38w,"The search continues to find a good AYCE sushi restaurant in Vegas...and Island Sushi and Grill has been getting quite a lot of attention as of late.

We had to see what the fuss was all about as well, so we came on a Monday night to enjoy their $24.95/pp AYCE sushi dinner.  (Lunch is $20.99/pp.)  

When you first walk through the doors, you'll find yourself at a walk up counter.  This is just the 'grill' part of the restaurant serving up lots of Hawaiian plate options.  If you make a right, you'll enter the 'sushi' part of Island Sushi and Grill and if you want AYCE, this is where you want to be.

After being seated and our beverage orders were taken, the waitress came by to ask if we wanted to start with any appetizers.  She also gave us a sheet and pen to fill out for our nigiri and sushi roll options.  

Appetizers: 
* Ahi Belly, Garlic Pepper Sauce (limit one order per person) - A small portion, but tasty!
* Ahi Poki - Pretty good!
* Deep Fried Geso - Our favorite was the deep fried baby octopus.  It comes in an order of three with a dipping sauce.  Pretty good stuff!
* Edamame
* Garlic Chicken
* Hamachi Kama (limit one order per person)
* Pork Gyoza
* Raw Crab Poke (limit one order per person)
* Tako Kim Chee Poke (limit one order per person)

Nigiri - They do give you small pieces of fish on small mounds of rice, which is a good thing. It's AYCE after all, so you can order more.  But it can be discouraging when you first see it.
* Albacore
* Amaebi (limit one order per person)
* Garlic Tuna
* Hamachi 
* Hirame
* Ika
* Ikura
* Saba
* Sake
* Scallop Mayo
* Tai
* Uni (limit one order per person)

Things we forgot to order because we were so full: Eggplant Fries, Fried Tofu Poke, Lomi Salmon, Mochiko Chicken, and Salmon Kama.

Everyone seems to rave about their rolls, but we're not big on rolls with just the two of us.  So, we didn't have any.  But if we were with a larger party, there were definitely a few that we would consider.

I wouldn't say their sushi is the highest quality, but I think people come because they do have a few other items like mochiko chicken, garlic chicken deep friend baby octopus, ahi poke, raw crab, tako kim chee poke, etc.  Like many AYCE sushi joints in Vegas, it's about what appetizers and cooked items are offered as well.

They are quite specific about any charges for leftover food - $1 for nigiri and $3 for an 8 piece roll.  So take you time when ordering, especially if you're ordering rolls.   

You are limited on one dessert option per person.  Everyone talks about the 808 Special, so we got one of those.  It's a deep-fried banana, ice cream, fresh strawberries, whipped cream, and chocolate sauce.  But our favorite was the Malasada Sundae.  One very delicious malasada cut into four pieces, ice cream, whipped cream, and guava(?) sauce.

Service was quite efficient and the waitresses were friendly.  We didn't have to wait long at all for any of our orders, which is definitely a plus.  Beverages were refilled without having to ask and any empty plates were cleared quickly as well, so no complaints about service at all.

They also offer a frequent eater card, ten AYCE and you get one free.

What makes this place a real locals' place is all the specials they offer.  You can tell there are a lot of regulars here - families, couples, singles, etc.  Some are here for the grill menu to go or the sit down sushi.

Chicken Katsu- Very good.  Light and crispy, their katsu sauce was sweet and AH-MAZE-ING!

Hamachi (yellow tail) Nigiri- I know it's fish, however, it tasted a lot more fishier than I'm used to.  This makes me think if it was fresh or not...

Ahi poke- I know there's a poke express right next door.  I don't think this poke was made from them.  I didn't think it was very good.  The Ahi seemed to be a little old.

Geso (fried squid legs with a spicy aioli)- This was GOOOODD!  Whenever I order fried calamari, I always enjoy eating the smaller calamari with legs.  This dish was just legs!  YUM-O.  The menu says spicy aioli but it wasn't spicy at all...BUT DELICIOUS.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!

Garlic Chicken- Sweet teriyaki and garlic sauce all over fried boneless chicken thigh pieces.  Sweet, savory and crispy all at the same time.  ON POINT!

Gyoza- Crispy fried pork pot stickers served with a ponzu (sweet/citrus based soy) sauce.  I love the thin, watery consistency of the ponzu.  Goes well with the crispy gyoza.

Malassada sundae- Definitely a MUST TRY!  First they cut the malassada (fried donuts without the hole and dusted with sugar) in four wedges and fan it out in a bowl.  A scoop of ice cream is placed in the center with a whipped cream topping and the dish is finished with a guava sauce and cut strawberries.  Such an AH-MAZE-ING ending!

I do enjoy the fact that Island sushi is separated into two sections.  One section for just the sushi bar and another section for plate lunch/bento/fast food type service and poke express.  These sections are night and day and appeals to all sorts of diners.  If you are looking for a place that exposes you to Hawaiian-local cuisine, this is definitely the place to go to.",CNaaizAUc2c4WIb1M3BBPw,0,0,4,dC968PNQ3OC3vZipBAbIHQ

5048527,2010-09-06,7,DzKl51tivGJMLiNsQqf38w,"Today we wanted to take a trek to Henderson area to visit a friend. I've been wanting to try this and it's right by their house (lucky them!). 

With so many AYCE places, it's hard to pick and choose. Even having tried many, I couldn't really pick a ""best"", but had more of they're all good, but here's the pros and cons of each particular place kind of answer (IE- some have bomb apps but meh sushi, great nigiri but rolls and apps are boring). I'll go on a limb that this is the best that I've had since it meets a lot of points. 

First point- appetizers are interesting, and have a wide variety. Sure, sure. Come for nigiri to get ""moneys worth"" but it gets a bit repetitive that way. I think I get my worth through the variety of foods I get to eat. 

Ahi Belly with Pepper Garlic- the sauce was light but not overwhelming that you can't taste the fish melty, fatty yumminess or the nice char.
Deep Fried Geso- delicious!! perfectly cooked baby octopus is always a favorite for me.
Salmon Lomi- it was just okay. It was more tomatos than anything.
Ahi Poke- very nice version. ordered 2!
Tako Kimchee- nice thin sliced octopus stirred in with kimchee.
Hamachi Kama- I love kama and theirs had such a good char and perfectly crispy skin

Nigiri- the fish was fresh. The plus to me was that they do nigiri smaller than average (dont worry- the rice to fish ratio is very fairly proportional). Now some people might be taken aback since were all used to largesse given in cuts but, the smaller cut is perfectly bite sized and gives the opportunity to sample more variety. Some of these restaurants serve a two bite nigiri and with the BFs braces and jaw he dislikes how he has to bite in half and break it to eat. 

Standouts:
Escolar/Super White Tuna- pretty good. 
Cajun Albacore- very nice seasoning and ponzu sauce
Cajun Tuna- this has the seasoning and then has a wasabi aioli which was quite unique and good
Yellowtail- this is one of my favorite fish and it was very fresh

All the rest were good too. Only one that was just okay was the mackerel which had a bit of a salty quality to it that isn't the norm. 

 We also got a special chef creation which was also a highlight of the night- it was a thin slab of rice on nori that was toasted to a crispy cake and topped with spicy chunks of tuna, thin slab of avocado, a dot of siracha, and a sweet sauce- probably eel sauce. It was very nice textures and flavors together. 

Rolls- not usually into rolls but only because most places its 90% california roll with different toppings and sauce. Boring. They had some interesting rolls. We tried The Croc which combined a few favorite elements- it has some spice, it has soft shell crab, sweetness from some unagi. Pretty good. I would have gotten more, but between just the two of us, whole rolls is a lot to eat and we wanted variety. Next time when we bring our friends to share with. They don't do half rolls, except on your very last roll you want to order.  I kept getting my favorite handroll though- salmon skin which is lovely here. 

Dessert- not just the standard ice cream or mochi, though they do offer that too. They have a malasada sundae, the 808 special and creme brulee. We got the malasada which was yummy and the creme brulee had nice flavors but it wasnt so solid as it should, more runny, but it was still good. 

I like that this place can satisfy appetizer people, nigiri people, roll people and even dessert people. It's that reason why I think this is my favorite that we can bring all types of ayce people and their needs can be met. It's $24.95, cheaper by a few bucks than most dinner ayce and I think has better quality than those that hit the $30 mark. They give you 90 minutes which I don't really need, but I just like places where they're not timing you....I think here they realize people like to pace and sometimes, you're just waiting for food since it's all made-to-order stuff. 

Did I mention the hospitality? The sushi chef/owner was very attentive, talkative and seems very cool. The staff never even let our ice teas hit halfway and came to check on us a few times to see if we want more appetizers from the kitchen. 

Oooh if I lived on this side of town I will come by all the time! Since I don't, we just have to make day trips to Henderson more often!

Service was fine - not fast, but not slow.  The atmosphere is nice and friendly - it has a great casual Hawaiian vibe.  I would say that the bento box prices are slightly higher than other places, but they give you more food than most - so its pretty fair.

We ordered the one of the meals that came with 3 items (we got the fried scallops, the veggie tempura, and beef teriyaki).  The fried scallops were sooo good!  I would come back just for those... they were large and had a great flavor.  The veggie tempura was good (it came with two huge pieces of sweet potato which is my fav kind).  Beef teriyaki was better than most places, but nothing to rave about in my opinion.  We had California rolls and a tuna roll on the side - pretty standard.  

For dessert, we got the 808 special.  It's like a banana split, but with fried banana.  LOVED it!  It came with our meal and I was impressed with the size of it considering most of the time meals don't even come with desert!

So it took 2 tries for me to get a feel of this spot. First time we sat at the bar, second time at a table. Both experiences was the same. Tight at the bar though. Parking is plenty. Located in a plaza off of Eastern, it is semi busy in the area. Brings in good traffic. The inside of the restaurant is a bit cramed away from the bar. I believe about 9 tables total. Yes pretty small. Because of the small space, it gets pretty loud with a full house. Both times we were there it took about 5-10 minutes for us to get greeted, which is very rare. Customer service is good. Enough to where the Mrs. did not complain.

I'm always a bit leary because what a friend think's is good quality is completely different then what I think is good.  

So... I walk inside and it's divided into 2 types of restaurants in 1 bldg with a wall dividing the two.  Inside the main entrance is the hawaiian side of the dining room with approx 3 tables and a counter area to order from just like aloha kitchen and L&L hawaiian.  On the other side of the wall is the sushi side of the restaurant with several tables and a sushi bar (both halves of this place are VERY small)  So after waiting a few minutes I get a seat at the sushi bar and they have 2 chefs and I think 2 or 3 servers and the place is full.  It is VERY easy to see right away that they are definitely under staffed for the amount of guests they have. After waiting approx 15 min we finally get to place our first order.  The menu looks good and the quality was fine (nothing great but certainly nothing bad at all)  But they were definitely VERY slow both the food and the servers and very cramped inside.  Once thing I will mention is when I ordered the uni (sea urchin) the first piece tasted very funny and odd and I thought ok maybe just maybe it was me.. I tried the 2nd piece and it was very noticeable.

""Book it."" I say and the rest is history.

It's the usual, great Vegas AYCE place.  Super creative rolls filled with lots of deep fried stuff (soft shell crab, shrimp tempura), stuff mixed with spicy mayo, usually coated with a sweet, teriyaki eel sauce.   Most of the fish taste previously frozen or gassed.  All good though if you skip the nigiri.

What sets this place apart is the local Hawaiian style flavors.  Paniolo roll (teri beef inside, miso sauce, outside) and the poke roll (as its name implies).  Only disappointment, the Maui Wowie. Dang it. (You're a better person if you don't get it.)

Oh yeah, plate lunches are as good as back home.  Local style mochiko chicken, teri beef, mixed plates, and fried noodle combos.  

Usual AYCE prices.  Lunch $21, Dinner $25.  All day happy hour with 50% off all rolls (not the AYCE) Mon - Wed. for the lighter eater.  Plate lunches are very reasonable averaging $7.50.

May I also point out that the lady on the phone did not sound happy at all to talk over the phone. So we arrive there around 8:20 just to have them tell us their poke station is closed because they ran out of fish. Fish! What a horrible excuse.

I am surprised I haven't written a review for this place yet. I've been dining here for years and it is one of my favorite Hawai'an - 9th island restaurants in Vegas. I always feel like I'm back home when I'm here. 

This review is mainly for the grill side of Island Sushi & Grill. I have had AYCE sushi here during Sunday Brunch and it was good, but it was a while back (5+ years ago). At that time it was a good price, lots of options for rolls and breakfast food. It may have changed since then. 

GRILL SIDE: 
- My favorites are the korean chicken, garlic chicken, chicken & eggplant, & teri beef plates. 

- The ahi plate is a bit dry but can be improved. 

- The malasadas are great. Freshly made and an assortment of filled malasadas to choose from: chocolate, haupia, and custard. 

I love the renovations. It looks great! I like the option of quick service on the grill side with tables to dine in as well. I usually order takeout by phone and swing by to pick up when it's ready.",825Ol4rTvAZnUyFMke37jA,6,7,4,sko9Qu7n2g9KRbKgkkQSeg

As for the sushi restaurant, the AYCE may be a bit pricey, but everything - and I mean EVERYTHING - on the menu is included in it. My favorite appetizer from there is the fried oysters. If you're sitting at the bar, one of the chefs may make a surprise dish for you, if you're lucky. Rolls are either hit or miss - they may be some ""interesting"" sushi rolls, but the rolls that are hits are very tasty! Customer service is also very good. I've been there in large groups several times before, and they definitely know how to handle them!",n5RLc0MXfRkg8cI9diz8fQ,0,0,4,vVVgvhTqdPBl6EaxDsMlyQ

Literally everyone here is friendly, there aren't a bunch of places I can take my grandmother to, due to rude service or patrons, but this is always the go-to spot for us. I'm from hawaii so everything here is up my alley and I've been here so much I've practically had the entire menu, it's a great place to come, it can be busy if you come at lunch or their rush times. The sushi side is great too I've done that a couple times.

I always order Poke here, I've tried it literally anywhere I could in Vegas, this is the only place I recommend to get it. Even though it's frozen, they prepare it in a way that I can't taste that, everywhere else the texture is mush. Here the fish is always firm as if it just came off the boat I really appreciate that as I can't find it anywhere else for a decent price.

We stood there for 15 minutes and had 5 different people ask us if we've been helped. They had a birthday party going along the back wall, other tables with patrons, two long tables that were not occupied, and then open spots at the bar. We had our baby in the car seat with us or we would have sat at the sushi bar.  15 minutes & each server that came by told us that we would be seated when the party LEFT. They hadn't even started cake..... It was 8:30 by this point and I'm almost positive they close at 9. So we would have been rushed through our meal, just like they did to us the last time. Again... Two open tables we STILL there. Needless to say, we ended up leaving. Last time we'll ever stop there again.

The FIRST time we ate there we were rushed through our meal. Mind you there was 5 of us doing all you can eat & 4 of them were eating and sending drinks to the sushi chefs for the awesome food. You'd think this would end up giving them a kick ass review right? Well, the servers began coming by and taking plates off our table that had sushi on it. Our friend who had a couple pieces left on his plate told the server he wasn't done and she put another plate over it and squished his food. We asked to speak to manager on duty and we were told they didn't have one and that we needed to pay our check and go. I then asked to speak to a manager again and was asked what for. I explained to the other server about how ours was so disrespectful. He came back with a poor excuse of a gift certificate that covered ONE entree..... Gee thanks. 

Thought we'd give you another chance.... Won't be doing that again

Came back the next day for lunch on the grill side. Ox tail is authentic, not fatty, and super delicious. My sisters ordered the garlic chicken bento box and teriyaki beef box. Teriyaki beef was not the usual flavor you would expect, but had a nice Hawaiian twist. 

The poke bar at the back of the grill area had the best poke I've ever eaten. I got the shoyu ahi poke bowl with brown rice and it was THE BESTTTTTT THING THEY HAVE. I get poke wherever I go and this beats everything. The fish was fresh and flavorful. Portions were superb. The regular bowl was about $10 and filled me up.

It does get really busy during lunch time, so if you're desperately hungry, try and avoid coming here during lunch hours on a Sunday.",fd4ALq35GZPRg3l0R96GzQ,2,0,5,eGVPxlcAjTRXYaAFpTlpcw
5348187,2015-05-22,0,DzKl51tivGJMLiNsQqf38w,"I'm originally from Hawaii and have been here many times. However, the quality of their ""plate lunches"" has drastically dropped. For example, the garlic ahi was one of my favorites but now it's terrible. It's a few thin slices of ahi smothered in an awful, oily, overlooked mixture of shredded cabbage and onions. I scraped it all off and threw it away. 

I was also very disappointed in the hamburger steak I ordered previously but I thought it was hard to screw up fried ahi. Boy was I wrong. 

Whomever is cooking the dishes must not be tasting their cooking because the quality and flavors aren't close to what you can get at almost any eatery in Hawaii.

Response to owner: I can't remember the day I was there but it was about a week before my posting. To reiterate, fried ahi has enough taste on its own. Best to season it properly and if anything, place it on a thin bed of fresh shredded cabbage.  The ahi I got was smothered in an oily mess of overdone cabbage and onions. There was more cabbage and onions than ahi. Further, the Mac salad needs more flavor. Just mixing it in mayo doesn't cut it. Sorry for the negative rating but I was very disappointed with my meal and I remember it being better in the past.

Bringing a large group and trying to finish your meal in the 1/ 1/2 time limit is a little tough. Your trying to enjoy the food and socialize at the same time not just scarf food down fast as I can because of the time restraint.
When there are 20 plus in your group the food takes a while to come out also. 

My friends who used to love Islands, also have had some bad experiences as the service not being as good as it used to be when they first opened up.  

The food is pretty decent but because of the time restraint, it's not a good place for large groups in my opinion since I have tried. I know most Vegas sushi places the have a time limit for all you can eat and Islands is a little more generous with the time but huge groups it doesn't help.

I prefer to go to Sin city sushi across the street, even though Sin city is tiny there is no time limit on the all you can eat and we can relax socialize and enjoy the food without any pressure to hurry.

5379491,2010-08-09,0,DzKl51tivGJMLiNsQqf38w,"it's been a week since our vegas trip and our friend is still dreaming (literally) about their poke.

found this little unassuming place through yelp and we will definitely be coming back.  the lunch price was 20.95/person and includes hot appetizers, sushi rolls, and nigiri.  i love how this place is all-you-can-ORDER and not all-you-can-pick-through-leftovers-that's-been-sitting-there-for-god-knows-how-long.  the hot appetizer comes out hot because it's made to order.

you have to get the poke.  it was the highlight of my appetizer, entree, and dessert.  they even have a poke bar where you can buy poke by weight and that looked pretty delicious.

the rolls are not very big so you can try a bigger variety w/o being filled up after 1 roll.  i do think they can use a little more filling in the rolls though.  i would review each roll individually but the truth is that we had so many that i don't remember which was what.  the one that stood out to me was the one topped with slices of jalapeno peppers.. that was pretty yummy.

we tried the fried geso (whole octopus - head, tentacles and all) and that was interesting.  it's very chewy, more so than calamari, but it tasted pretty good.

i preferred the chicken with mochiko breading over the garlic chicken.  the mochiko chicken were lightly breaded, more lean, not as fried, flat pieces of chicken.  the garlic chicken looked like popcorn chicken and when i bit into it, all i saw were chunks of fat.  no thank you.

the gyoza was fried all over also, not pan fried.  i prefer the latter.  well actually i prefer the poke, i wish i had filled up the space the gyoza took with poke.

quality of the nigiri was pretty good as well.  the size of the slices of sashimi was decently proportioned to the amount of rice.  it is not top quality but you are also not paying $5-$10 per order of nigiri either.

if you wish you had more fish and less rice, then just order some more poke.

for desser we had the choice of ice cream, tempura ice cream, or the 808 special.  we just got ice cream cuz we were so full by the end of the meal and the 808 special just sounded too crazy: fried tempura banana with ice cream and whip cream etc.  it sounded like a meal in itself.

all in all we were very satisfied with our meal and glad we took the 15-min trip off the strip.  5 stars for getting what we got for the price we paid.  definitely come here with a group so you can try more stuff.  did i mention the poke was the bomb?",r5v0LNSM58FaXNC09EUFPQ,0,1,5,acQTyWGtGk6DvFYB0CfS3A

We came here STARVING. It was around 2pm, and we had just come back from swimming in the nice pool garden at the Venetian. So believe me when I say that we were incredibly hungry. The server took our order for appetizers, and we got miso soup, edamame, mochiko chicken, shrimp tempura, and maybe a few other things I don't remember. The shrimp tempura is only two pieces per order, so order several if you actually want to eat a decent amount. And who cares, it's unlimited anyway.

Notable rolls: Black Widow and the Mauna Loa. Although to be honest, we tried everything that had soft shell crab in it and that was amazing too. We must have put through a gajillion orders of rolls and they got vanquished within two minutes of being placed on the table. The nigiri came last, and avoid the squid because it's super rubbery. The salmon was decent, and that's pretty much all I tried because I was saving room for dessert.

I have made quite the convenient pairing, because the boyfriend doesn't like dessert and doesn't believe in always having room for it. I, meanwhile, had room for two desserts (I learned my lesson after the Mirage incident, see previous review). So I took my tempura ice cream (with vanilla ice cream, it was delicious) and then I took his green tea ice cream, which was a great way to round out the meal. After that, boy, was I full.

I would come here again in a heartbeat. The fish is great, the sweet sauce they use to cover it is not too overbearing, and for all you can eat, this can't be beat.

Ahi poke bedded on seaweed salad is delicious but at times can be too chewy (possibly not cut correctly?).

Salmon sashimi orgasm is pretty good too. The mussels have too much mayo on it and was too chewy. kinda felt light headed after from that. I honestly have never ate at a sushi testaurant that cut the salmon so lean. Now for the dessert...

Malassadas with vanilla ice cream drizzled with guava sauce and cinnamin crisps was ok but I wouldnt order it again. The ice cream banana tempura smothered in chocolate was better.

5434352,2016-04-15,1,DzKl51tivGJMLiNsQqf38w,"I've been frequenting Island Sushi for a good 6 or 7 years long before I ever Yelped. The Island atmosphere and sushi keep me coming back at least two to three times per year. I come most often with my work colleagues during lunch and they consistently get us in and out for a power AYCE lunch in less than an hour during the busiest times. The efficiency at lunch, the poke, and the desserts separate Island from some of the other AYCE sushi places.

I came for Tuesday lunch with my wife on my most recent visit and we had a very enjoyable meal. A California roll is the closest thing to sushi my wife will eat, but she still has plenty to choose from. The teishoku combination B is plenty of food for $14 (see picture). For AYCE, the ahi poke is a must. When I'm with my buddies, they order more rolls which are pretty standard at lunch, but I stick with nigiri. I'm not a sauce person for much of anything, and while the sake with orgasm sauce isn't quite orgasmic, it's a sauce that's creamy with some tart that I'll definitely make an exception for. The garlic tuna is another nigiri that we all like that is better than most places. I do like the white fishes like red snapper and halibut, but unfortunately, they don't carry these.

Make sure you save room for dessert too. I'll usually get the ""808"" Special and green tea ice cream. The tempura ice cream is solid, the creme brulee is a favorite of my daughter, and the malassada sundae is a dessert that is unique to Island.

Lunch AYCE is $21.95 and dinner is $26.95. They have discounted rolls and drinks during happy hour along with AYCD house sake for AYCE patrons. Service is mostly friendly and accommodating, as it was on our last visit. We've had occasional visits where service has been slow and I think that is completely dependent on who is serving you and if they are on island time or not.

The dining room is small and the sushi bar has about 5 or 6 seats so expect a wait during the peak times for dinner. A crowded lot with no spots will be the best indication of their volume. The longest we've waited was 30 minutes on a Friday night after we signed our name on the list. The advantage of coming in for dinner is that you get to have many of the items that are not available at lunch such as the raw crab poke, raw tako wasabi, and the kalbi ribs.

I usually eat on the grill side of the restaurant, and I've only been on the sushi side once, so this review is mostly about the plates they have.  I usually get a 2-item combo which is a dollar more than highest priced item...  Usually it's garlic chicken and and the chicken or pork with eggplant.  The garlic chicken is just perfect.  It's fried, and I want to drink the garlicky soy sauce that it's smothered in.  The eggplant is also really good and they can make it spicy for you.  I'm usually pretty sensitive to spicy food, but the spicyness isn't overwhelming and provides a tiny kick to your muth.  Your plate is really full of the food you order with two scoops of rice and a mac salad.  I've also tried the kalua pig and mochicko chicken.  I'm not from Hawaii, so I don't know how the kalua pig compares, but it's alright...  The mochicko chicken is really similar to the garlic chicken, but it's good in its own way.  
There isn't much to say about the service since the grill side is more of a help yourself out, but the guys behind the register are all really cool, and if they were servers, I'm sure they'd be really good. 
Also, the malasadas are great especially if they're fresh, and you can get them filled with custard, chocolate, or haupia cream.  They also have a ton of desserts displayed when you first walked in, and somehow I've managed to avoid them (usually because I'm too full to think of dessert when I'm done), but from the way they look, I'm sure they're great.

As for the sushi side, I've only gone once and didn't do the AYCE since back then they had a special for 50% off sushi on Mondays (I'm not sure if it's still there, but I doubt it).   It's been a while, but I think I really enjoyed the Hawaiian roll.  And the food and service on the sushi side is just as good as the grill side...

Typically service is great,  especially if you sit at the sushi bar.

5517462,2016-04-20,2,DzKl51tivGJMLiNsQqf38w,"First impression. 3 stars. We entered around 6pm on a Monday. We noticed the Please Wait to be Seated sign with a sign-in log. It was confusing because we stood there...a family of 6 just standing there for a few minutes that felt like 15minutes. We were completely ignored as if the workers were deliberately not looking up just so that they don't have to acknowledge us. After a few minutes of awkward standing...my husband walks up to the guy by the register to ask what the deal is. Then he readily explains to my husband how it works. First off, it would have been nice to have been acknowledged. I understand things get busy but I come from a background of customer service that no matter how busy you are...you should keep a constant habit of looking up at your surroundings. I almost walked out, but hell...we drove from the North side, traffic and all, just to eat dinner there for my son's birthday...I was going to stick it out.

So, apparently the please wait to be seated sign along with the put your name down is for their sushi side. When we wrote our names down it was like magic. Someone came and sat us down. We opted to eat at the sushi side because we were planning on some sushi anyways. I honestly don't know if on the grill side you have to wait to be seated. I'm assuming you'd just order then sit at whatever tables are available.

Once seated, the servers were completely friendly and homely feeling. However, I couldn't shake off this weird vibe I was getting in there. Don't know if it was the aftershock from standing around waiting part, but whatever, and so we ordered.

Kids collectively ordered the classic Loco moco, mini chicken katsu, and side order of fries. I decided for just the spam saimin, while the husband ordered spicy tuna, spicy hamachi, and the spicy salmon roll. M-W is all day happy hour. 50% off their sushi rolls with the exception of their nigiris and hand rolls. That is an awesome deal! Such deal made their sushi taste even better. The husband enjoyed his. Typical.

My saimin was pretty much....saimin. There was nothing extra special or memorable. But, I wasn't expecting anything magical considering it's simply a spam saimin. I did wish my saimin was a little less mushy. It did the job on my saimin crave, though. 

I can't tell you what the katsu tasted like but the husband said twas legit. My oldest kanacked off his Loco moco. He opted for all rice and boy was that plate serious. Couldn't tell you what that tasted like, but it looked homely put together. 

The fries tasted like the frozen seasoned french fries you can buy yourself. I don't mind that taste so no biggy. It was nice and crispy and that's all the mattered.

Overall, we spent about 34bucks. The server that took care of us was right-on with it. It made up for what had lacked. Once you figure out what happens when you enter...you'll pretty much be taken care of. I did notice it was a man's world that evening. Male chefs, cooks, servers...thought that was kinda cool because that's not something I aways come across. Plus, they all seemed super nice.

I'd return for sure especially for their sushi happy hour if we are in the area or feel like going on a drive. I think it's great that our family has options. The kids can get their 808 fix while the hubs and I can get our sushi on. Overall, I can only give 3 stars because it honestly was just mediocre to me. Maybe in the future I can up a star.

Definitely kid friendly. Highchairs with working buckles, yay! But leave your stroller in the trunk especially if it's busy. For a Monday night...they were poppin'.",MC0aQHT7mQ1WJknOD6u8pg,2,2,3,IDvpA7ddp0U-_ypj9Wj_fw

Service is always prompt, and the AYCE menu is very comprehensive. I love that appetizers are included. The rolls are creative without being unappetizing, which unfortunately happens at a lot of ""creative"" sushi joints.

I always recommend sitting at the bar, and try to sit in front of Chuy if you can. All the chefs are great, but he is so sociable and nice! I don't think he remembers me from when I used to come here, but he acts like he does. And, that's more than I could ever ask for. Super nice dude.

What makes this place stand out from the rest is that there is a separate side of the restaurant devoted to Hawaiian/Pacific Islander type foods, like butter mochi. You can also buy poke, there!

Synopsis:  So my best friend who I have known for 15 years is getting married.  So she decided to have her bachelorette in none-other, VEGAS!!!   Our first meal there was at Island Sushi. It was an L&L look alike.  Why we came here, I have no idea.  I can get this at home, really.  The food was not noteworthy.  However, what was disturbing was inside the restaurant.  The place looked so drabbed down I wouldn't want to be found dead here.  The question remains as to whether or not I would come back here again. The answer is probably no because I don't prefer plate lunches.

Environment: When you come here, it resembles so much like Hawai'i.  Didn't you know Las Vegas is the new safe house for former Hawai'i residents, who can't afford to live there?  Once inside, it wasn't too appealing in color.  You see all the metallic refrigerators, kitchen area.  The floors are drab, the walls are dark tinted yellow.  It is certainly meant for a quick and run kind of sit-in place. 

Food: I had the Garlic Ahi and all brown rice.  It looked like 3 pieces of 3 oz of grilled ahi, once slice of lemon, and 2 cups of brown rice.  This will fill you up for the price.  The Garlic Ahi was a bit bland.  I would recommend having a garlic sauce to go with it to make it jump from mediocre to awesome. I should have opted out for the mini plate on this one, but because I was starving I didn't care. 3/5

Poke: Although, I didn't have this, the fish didn't look fresh.  It didn't have that shiny, unslimmy, I-Was-Just-Placed-Here kind of look to it.  Yikes! Joe and Phil decided to get it anyway.  Luckily, they chose something that was a little fresher, but the taste was not Hawai'I or my father's level of greatness. 2/5

Cost: My plate came out to be 9.95.  That's cheap, considering the brown rice was an extra $1.25.  Ridiculous.  However, what was uber expensive was the poke. $16.99 a pound!  Jesus Christ!  And if you read the latter information, you would know you were being gypped. 

Employees: They were very nice.  The girl at the desk greeted with a smile.  Very courteous, it almost made me forget that the place was a POS.

Parking: This was by far the best feature of this place.  Because it's Vegas, meaning more land space, we had prime real estate, also known as right in front of the doors.",Wc4HvL4Nv54HI5C_bHxDVQ,1,3,3,Pc1ye8Q-c2K_G1UPgx3ngw

Most places are run by indifferent Chinese or Korean people who just want to give you whatever can pass for sushi and then charge you as much as they can for it, or deep fry everything to mask the fact that none of the fish is very fresh.

Island Sushi is different. As far as I can tell, everything was nice and fresh, service was good, the appetizers were amazing (thus providing a more diversified AYCE experience than just eating roll after roll), and of course they still have to cut their losses somehow so there is a 90 minute time limit which I am totally okay with.

Located along Eastern Ave near the 215 FWY and in the same plaza as Red Rice. Parking lot is shared with the other businesses so just avoid the 30 min only parking spots.

The mochiko chicken was tasty. It had a seasoned batter on it and I really liked that the chicken was still moist on the inside. The only thing I would change is maybe dip the chicken in some katsu or teriyaki sauce next time. Other than that, I really liked it. It came with about 5-6 pieces of chicken, 1 scoop of rice and a side of mac salad. I recommend it for sure. The spam musubi was good and tasty. Cant go wrong with a musubi... The lychee green tea is my favorite of all the Hawaiian Sun drinks. So good. It's like the best flavor, best water ever.

I was a huge fan of SUSHI Mon on Sahara ave earlier.  been there a total of 3 times and on the 3rd time, the sashimi on the rice was thin and lacking.  The food wasnt prepared right... some of the hot items were lukewarm instead.

Nigiri was falling apart so I went to Island Sushi after friend's suggestion.

Been there now the 5th time.  Same thing is happening.

At first, I love this place for its rolls.  It has all sorts of amazing sushi rolls... deep fried sushi with cream cheese, or Las Vegas rolls.  Its sashimi portion was generous while the rice was minimal.  No rice pushing.  

The AYCE menu is awesome with many choices... typically the one time order for Uni, Sweet Shrimp and you can always put the sweet shrimp into the soup.  In addition, you can also have the POKE dishes which are awesome, i love the many cool items such as fish head, shrimp tempura.

On this visit, the rice was increasing and sashimi didnt look fresh.  The items came but it wasnt as appetizing as before.  The Unagi was horribly made, it was just a clump of fish and rice and wasnt beautifully presented like before.

Alot of rice in the hand rolls and overall food quality isnt as great.

Im afraid to say, maybe it was an off day, but I did notice an overall decrease in quality.  Its still good, just not as good.  So I will give a 2 star!",AD6XpcOPmbcZ8zhd1jRc1Q,1,0,2,OP017_ZEatppK2x2CHv5ug

The teriyaki chicken had no teriyaki flavor whatsoever and it did not even come with teriyaki sauce. Also, the macaroni salad was the worst Hawaiian mac salad I have ever tasted. It was extremely bland. The food was so horrible it seemed as if it was prepared this way on purpose to keep people away. I just don't see how they could make the food so bad!

5628914,2017-07-25,2,DzKl51tivGJMLiNsQqf38w,"not sure what's happening with ISG but my last visit was terrible. this review is based solely on my visit on 7-20 @ 9:05pm
I was craving a nice HOT bowl of saimin, hubby was agreeable so we stopped in at ISG. we both ordered the saimin deluxe with 4 extra wontons each and 6 vanilla malasadas. we sat ourselves and waited for our soup. and waited. and waited. 20 mins later we got of food. I understand if it was busy, but we were the only ones waiting and the other table was already eating. okay, whatever. I can get past this because their food is good. grabbed my spoon and dug in. and said WTF?!!??! this was lukewarm broth with cold wontons and cold char siu. I couldn't take another bite and took my bowl back up to the counter and asked them to please do something with this cause it's not hot. got it back 5 mins later - soup was warmer but a few wontons were still cold and stuck together. I just shook my head and ate. hubby's soup was no better but he was starving and just ate the noodles and char siu, left everything else.   

it's so disappointing especially when you expect a certain level of service and quality of food. I don't think HOT soup is too much to ask for, no matter what time you come into an establishment. I'm sure each item/ingredient was refrigerated and heated as needed/per order, and that's fine, but what's not okay and unacceptable is to serve soup without making sure everything has come to proper temperature and is out of the food danger zone.",t11KdyiSntMe74NhHrTynw,4,0,1,_gyKr9rpmU6vWa-qVmCHKQ

I wouldn't say this place is sushi heaven but ... for an all you can eat $25 a person, sure enough-- this definitely lives beyond its expectation. 

5 girls, in our late 20's- ate 67 plates! YuP, we have a proof of what we ate from the final check. That's right we had 67 plates. 

Here are what I thought was a must try: 
- Sweet shrimp ( its limited 1 per person) 
- Uni * Get it but its not 100% recommended, not as fresh as I wanted it to be * 
- Egg plant tempura 
- Their Dessert with Fried Banana and Ice Cream ( make sure you get it without the whip cream ) this is to DIE FOR! Definitely try this. 

All of the other rolls and appetizers are all pretty decent but as far as what i thought was really good are what I had listed above.

5723024,2012-09-11,0,DzKl51tivGJMLiNsQqf38w,"I found this place doing a Yelp search while planning my trip to LV.  And the lovely thing was my cousin and LV resident, highly recommended this place for AYCE sushi.  The great thing about this place (to me) is that it's away from the LV Strip.  Been there, done that, y'know? Sometimes off the beaten track is best and Island Sushi did not disappoint!

This place is a hole-in-the-wall. No doubt about that.  You want a Zen or tranquil or a sleek sushi house experience, this ain't it.  This is get-down-to-business-eat-your-sushi-or-Hawaiian-favorites kinda joint. 

We had a fantastic experience.  The servers were great. Always checking on us, clearing plates, refilling glasses and making sure if we wanted more sushi--and not in a ""hurry up and order"" kind of way, but in a genuine ""would you like more to eat?"" kind of way.  

This was my first time doing AYCE sushi (other than Todai which I hated, so I won't count that).  We made sure we understood the rules and then we ordered well.  Very well.  Everything was delicious. Well made and fresh. 

We ordered Ahi Poke and Hammachi Kama.  The Ahi Poke was my favorite--the flavors so fresh. I wish I could re-create it at home because I'd eat it at least once a week. The Hammachi was delicious too. It reminded me of the grilled fish my dad serves.

Nigiri: Tuna, Cajun Tuna, Garlic Tuna, Super White Tuna, Albacore, Hammachi, Salmon, Ebi and Unagi.  Some we loved so much we ordered them twice (and 3 times in the case of Garlic Tuna)  

Maki: Tiger, Spicy Mexican, Joe's Special.  All so good. If you like Jalapeno and Siracha, the Mexican roll is for you.  For me, it had a nice heat, not too spicy.  The Tiger Roll was my favorite because I love shrimp tempura and spicy tuna--well made and tasty. Joe's Special--I don't know who Joe is, but this is also a fine roll--shrimp tempura, cucumber and ahi. 

Save room for dessert.  In fact, if you're full, order dessert anyway.  They're not huge portions but are certainly delicious.  I had the Malassada sundae, made with warm malassada donuts, vanilla ice cream, strawberries and guava sauce drizzle. Every bite was delicious.  I also got to try the warm brownie sundae--also very good. The brownie is dense and rich, almost like a flourless chocolate cake. 

The bro is good at math so I had him check our AYCE price versus if we just paid a la carte--the AYCE is definitely a steal.  This is certainly better than any buffet style AYCE sushi because you can order off of 3 different pages of Nigiri and Maki and side dishes and everything is fresh to order.",RO3vznPVVw5NWcgfP3k17A,2,1,5,8YttrJYfOAfjAtQZGVCr_g

5726667,2012-09-28,0,DzKl51tivGJMLiNsQqf38w,"So after eating at Island Sushi this is now my go to place for AYCE sushi and Hawaiian food.  When one of our friends that lives in Vegas brought us here we were  a bit hesitant about this place.  We walked in and I swear it felt like I just walked into a cafe from Hawaii.  The smell of the malasadas were awesome.  I love how there's a bakery on one side and the restaurant on the other.  So we sat down, a party of 14, and  all ordered AYCE... The faces on the sushi chefs were classic. Hahaha We ordered pretty much every roll they had and every single one was bomb.  I cant remember the names but damn they were good.  The one that got me was the Uni and kimchee fried rice.  Damn that uni was damn good.  I could eat tons of that kimchee fried rice.  So we came to the desert and first thing i see is the malasada ice cream sundae.  WHAT! oh hell yes I will take one pls.  Their malasada was so good we ordered 2 dozen before we left. Hahahaha not as good as Leonards in Hawaii but pretty damn close. The service was the best as close as you can get to the aloha spirit of Hawaii.  Some even still have their pidgin accent. Awesome.

5731519,2017-07-17,0,DzKl51tivGJMLiNsQqf38w,"Sigh. I'd really love to give this place five stars because the food is so bomb and the service on the dine-in side was so fun but I can't because I am 0 for 2 ordering food at the take out side. 

First the good: the sushi here is SO GOOD. They have specialty rolls and during happy hour all rolls are half off. I would actually argue that this is as good if not a better deal than their AYCE option. With AYCE you feel obligated to stuff yourself and that hardly ever ends well for anyone. 50% off allows you to try a few things that you'll enjoy and if you stop at a reasonable point, you'll end up spending less than you would for all you can eat. 

The service is also good on the restaurant side. Though I had some issues when I was there a couple weeks ago. We had AYCE and the wait staff sometimes took ages to bring out our food and sometimes put the order in twice so two of a given dish would come out (and with all you can eat there's some hazard to double ordering..). Anyway, both of those things happened twice which I didn't care for but the staff were all super sweet so it's hard to get annoyed. 

The food is solid though and definitely the #1 reason I keep coming back. This is my favorite place for local food in this area..so give it a try! They also have daily specials on the take out side and some of them look REALLY good. Though if I'm here I like to do sushi. Yum.",2PpCp3l1c_yzcY236ptEKg,2,0,4,iRLbBiTIqeD6xl1FCaqq2A

Food: I asked them if they served a lot of rice with their nigiri and they told me no and believe me they serve a lot of rice. The sushi flavor is ok. Not the best that I tasted.

Came to Island Sushi about 3 years ago when I was visiting Vegas... stopped by to pick up a plate lunch to go... 

3 years later... I'm back at Island Sushi as a Las Vegas resident! Came here the other night... AYCE!!!

I'm a huge fan! Everything I love from seaweed salad, poke, lomi salmon, mochiko chicken, garlic chicken, teri beef, malasada, coco puffs, unique rolls with fun names... I'm sold!

I wish I.S. was closer to me... I would be there weekly for sure! 

If you're looking for Hawaiian food and sushi with a local twist... Island Sushi is the hot spot!

I feel at home when I'm here... locals everywhere... Big Island pictures on the wall... including Hilo my hometown... one of the girls working there as a server is from Hilo... I love being around Hawaii people!

I'll be back for my Hawaiian fix... AYCE works for me!

The grocery store sushi has more flavor than this place! I'm so confused at what I just paid for. Oh, I know: Rice and Sysco MAYONNAISE. There was ZERO flavor here, and frankly, the temperature of the fish was disconcerting. Don't waste your money or risk your health. 



In response to Terrance: You seem confused. Did you read my review?? I said your sushi was *COVERED* in mayonnaise and sauces. How is that protecting the ""integrity"" of your fish? I couldn't even taste the fish! All I could taste was that it was cheap quality and warm. Yuck.

It is a place you'll see a lot of local people from hawaii in here as it is so called the 9th Island for a reason. Just keep the conversation going and hear the pigeon come out in most of the people in the Restruant.  Nothing like good food, mokes, hanging out with friends and family.

Came here twice with a group of friends who sat in the dining area and with a friend who sat at the bar. Both times seating was ready and available. Waitresses were nice and so were the chefs at the bar. The only dispute I have is with the miso soup. Way, *way* too salty for its own good. Everything else tasted great, though.

The rice was over cooked, so mushy which made everything soak into it. For example the loco moco, the gravy soaked into the rice and made it even more mushy. Same with the sushi, the rice wasn't as great as other sushi joints, it lacked love and flavor. It could've been a bad day and that's ok, we all have our off days. 

I believe the hardest way to keep the flavor and the food the best is when it's delivered. Postmates is a God send but the food doesn't taste as if I sat down there to eat a good meal.

I decided to give this place a try on a Saturday evening with my family and when we walked in we were not greeted nor acknowledged. We stood there for about 5 minutes reading the menu that's posted above the register. Everyone seemed busy and I was trying to make eye contact with someone so we could place an order but no one bothered to ask. We walked out after 10 minutes of being IGNORED. 

Fast forward to a few days later, I decided to give this place another chance for lunch and order to go since we live across the street. I called and the guy who answered the phone said ""please hold"". I was on hold for about 5 mins before I hung up and tried calling again. I received another ""please hold"" and continued to hold for another 5 minutes. At this point I'm just furious. I call back a third time and get the same ""please hold"" I ask the guy on the phone if they are even taking to go orders right now because it seems like they are not wanting any business. He says sorry that he had a big group come in and asked me to ""please hold"" once again. I hung up and will never ever bother trying this place. Don't waste your time.

5878443,2015-11-14,1,DzKl51tivGJMLiNsQqf38w,"This review is strictly for the Grill part of Island Sushi & Grill.  There's a huge difference between the two.  

You walk into this restaurant and unless you know the drill, it can be a bit confusing.  The menu is plastered on the flat screen with a good variety of Hawaiian eats.  Then you look to the right and there's a curtain leading into the Sushi side of the restaurant, where you need to sign your name and wait for a greeter to come out.  We have yet to try the sushi, so I can't comment. 

Back to the Grill.  You can always mix the plates for two meats, add brown rice for a fee.

Chicken katsu curry- breaded with panko, fried to a beautiful brown, then a scoopful of curry spread over the chicken.  The chicken evenly sliced and you could see a good cut of meat with just enough panko crust for a good crisp texture. 

Lau Lau- Last I heard, they do fly it in from Hawaii, so you can't mess this one up since it's from a trusted brand.  Good chunk of meat, good small bit of butterfish and love the taro leaves.

Kalua Pork- This is one of my favorite.  It has a nice smokey flavor, good shredded pork and a small amount of cabbage (some times more cabbage, which I like).  A simple, yet flavorful and satisfying dish.

Come for saimin, oxtail soup, local moco, musubi or Korean bbq.  So far, this is my favorite place for authentic Hawaiian flavors.  

They have malasadas (not a fan), haupia desserts, chocolate this, banana that, a whole display case that can be quite luring.  

Pay $2 for the frequent customer loyalty card.  After you spend $250, they credit $25 for food here. (This card is not good for the poke counter, just for the kitchen food and sushi from the restaurant).",sAOdKC09kMqFfnVCrJRWvQ,5,3,4,mBwGCgHluC4n8FO73tmPqQ

we felt like we were still in hawaii at this place, even our nice waitress looked like one local.  my wife did her research which is why we ended up here.  she already knew what she was gonna order so she starts rattling off a whole bunch of stuff to our waitress who goes, ""you sure you no like get the all you can eat? most of those things are on the all you can eat menu."".   so we went that route.  

ordered 2 orders of teri beef, 2 orders salmon katsu, 2 orders of poke, vegetable tempura, edamame, miso soup, and somen salad.  for the rolls, we got the katsu roll, ahi fever roll, lahaina roll, california roll, poke roll, island special roll, and 007 roll.  our favorite was the the katsu roll.  i almost thought we werent gonna finish everything, but we did! every last bit.  and for dessert we got green tea ice cream (it comes with the ayce!).  by then, we were so full so we just shared one.  check out their website, it describes all the rolls on there.

You know a Hawaiian place is good when almost everyone who eats there is obviously from Hawaii.

Haven't had the sushi yet, but I've gone back a few times for the oyako donburi, which is fabulous.  The loco moco is delicious, too.  

But the best thing going for this place is the malasadas!  As far as I know it's the only place in Vegas to get them and they are GOOOOOOD!  Okay, so they're not Leonard's, but they are almost as good.  Just a little more dense.  And they keep well, too.

The theme of the evening was: small. Maybe Im not used to the AYCE portion sizes but the nigiri sushi and rolls were really small. Even my malasada sundae was small with only a little scoop of ice cream in a little cup. 

Island sushi has a strict policy that you must pay for anything you don't finish so not sure why the portions are small. The fish was fresh and the rolls were good, nothing spectacular though. We also ordered the hamachi Kama which was nice to see on the menu (1 per person). You are also able to order many non-sushi items.

The service was very good and I also thought it was a pretty good value for $26.95 pp for dinner so that raised my rating to 3 stars. None of the sushi was outstanding or blew me away though.  I guess AYCE just isn't for me.",86RJ2VAQoUypqdf7ZEpEXg,1,1,3,Xct3ECxkI3OKR75yl3dS1g
5918584,2010-06-17,0,DzKl51tivGJMLiNsQqf38w,"There are so many AYCE sushi options in Las Vegas, and there are a few good ones that I have found, but this place is one of my favorites, in spite of it being really out of the way from where I live. 

I actually came here with classmates awhile back, and I was hooked on the friendly atmosphere and service, and the great food!  I love the mochiko chicken appetizer, even though I know I should be getting my belly full on the sushi and the rolls.  It is definitely a restaurant that is best to visit with at least 3+ friends, so everyone can order and sample more variety of their specialty rolls.

There has also been a 1/3 ownership change in the past few months, and minor menu update with additional items added to the menu offering. So when you go, try the new items and see if any will become your new favorites.

For me, I love the fried baby octopus and the dipping sauce that it is served with.  I dare say that it is the BEST baby squid dish of Las Vegas and would totally fit in on the menu of izakaya restaurants like Ichicha or Ita-Cho (in Los Angeles).

that's the first word that pops into my head when i think of islands sushi. this restaurant has become one of my favorites in vegas.  i don't really like being reminded of home when i'm on vacation, but the food, family-friendly atmosphere & service has been totally awesome, like restaurants back in hawaii.  it's hard to find exceptionally great sushi/local food on the mainland.  if i were to move here to the 9th island, i wouldn't be too sad.

my last visit was great, but not as satisfying only because of pregnancy.  i can't tolerate certain smells and i certainly don't eat much at this point. i was also told to stay away from sashimi, which is fine since i'm not a huge fan.  i like to make the most of buffets and i just couldn't do it, so i decided to not take advantage of the all-you-can-eat deal and instead got a bento box. 

i didn't make a mistake. it was very yummy!  i chose the bento box a - teri beef w/furikake rice, yakisoba, spam and choice of chicken.  i went with the garlic chicken.  it was a lot of food for $8.25. i had to take it home.  didn't eat much of the chicken (i think i had an aversion to it) but pounded the spam and half of the teri beef.  my son enjoyed it too.  i was surprised that he sat still and ate good. 

the 808 special is the bomb. i missed that, some of the rolls and basically just the all you can eat deal. i'm definitely looking forward to it next time 'cause i won't be pregnant when i come back (i think).

You enter from the Hawaiian place to another doorway to the sushi place. Although they claim to be combined restaurants you are not allowed to eat in either one unless you're ordering from there.. even if there's no more room. We were already seated with water and they told us to get up and move.. And there was no people on that side. We ended up leaving.

The waiters on the sushi side are not nice at all and can't even accommodate you..

On the Hawaiian food side, I always ordering from a particular Asian girl with tats. She just doesn't make you feel welcome and comfortable and it's just seems like you're a hassle when she's taking your order.

The wait was pretty long but they were able to seat us quickly if we sat at the bar. The restaurant is very small and cramped. The seating was especially tight at the bar. 

I figured sitting at the bar, service would be better since we had direct access to the sushi chef, but I was wrong. It was hard to get his attention to order anything and there was a number of items we ordered and never received. The service from the kitchen was the same. Slow and on several occasions they brought out what we ordered to another table only to let us know and we were forced to wait a little longer for our items. 

The service issues were enough to make me not interested in returning, but the food didn't really do it for me either. No standouts and almost every dish was something I've had better versions of at other sushi restaurants.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,8,5,2,y_bLznoYFrkfrClRMK1BrA
