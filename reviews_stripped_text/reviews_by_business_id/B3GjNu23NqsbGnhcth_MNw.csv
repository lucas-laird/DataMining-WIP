My pizza was cold, and i asked for a new piece, the reheated the piece i was GIVEN! when i asked for a fresh one, the dough was hard as a rock and i didnt finish and left. I wouldnt recommend this to my worst enemy.",DOL5LEcGdt2BicvDSkNnjw,1,0,1,DgmJEnD072YD2Wmokawmow

Palermo offers pizzas whole and by the slice, calzones, cold and hot subs, salads and pastas for dine-in, take-out or delivery. I ordered some garlic knots and a personal pizza, which is more than enough for two people. The knots are bite-sized and not overpowering. The pizza crust is very similar to authentic NYC pizza. The service is good, too--the cashier came by a couple times to bring our food by and refill drinks.

It appears to be a popular place at lunchtime--there's a sign on the wall instructing students to pick up their orders when their names are called, not to rearrange the tables, and they offer a student discount equal to the amount of sales tax that would be charged.

Overall, a pretty good stop. I would definitely consider coming back or getting delivery.",bFl0Cg7anF3yVN6dcX2Tbw,3,0,4,tOHb08v3RJDp7XnhPWXKfA
