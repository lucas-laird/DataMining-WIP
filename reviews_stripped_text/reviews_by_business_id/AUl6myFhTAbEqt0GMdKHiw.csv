I eat pretty clean and they claim they are GMO free.. My body knows when something isn't organic.. This place is such a disappointment! Along with McDonalds this place is on my shit list! I'm just sad that they claim something as bold as non GMO and it's not even true. We should be able to trust the food that we eat.,5_SsPRKbjJgQm_bhG6bYVQ,0,0,1,3qXYQNGZifH3eFijCqtNnQ
32627,2015-07-25,0,AUl6myFhTAbEqt0GMdKHiw,"Went to this chipotle on a Saturday around 3pm took 17 min to reach the front of the line. I have been to this location in the past and have experienced faster service, however, this visit was very frustrating. There were obviously some issues going on this afternoon they seemed short staffed and having major pos cash register issues but the feeling I got from the staff was very unpleasant. The few people who were working had dead stares on their faces without an ounce of urgency that they have a line wrapping around to the front of the door. A manager of some sort came out from the back and was about to roll a trash can outside but when he saw the line he took the trash can to the back and proceeded to help out. I thought this would make the service faster but it didn't. He simply washed his hands and stirred some food around filled up one container with something and that's about it. He should have pushed the line through or noticed there were issues at the cash register as well. 

After we get our food and are almost done eating 3:40pm I see 6 employees walk through the front door about to start their shift and one just roaming around on his break, go figure. 

Lastly, while in line I was about to order chips and guacamole with my burrito bowl. Looked at the guacamole and was disgusted it was literally brown and looked like it had been sitting their since they opened or possibly from the night before.

I'm usually here about once a week, either before noon or in the late afternoon, and haven't had any unpleasant experiences. Never dealt with any rude employees. I usually get a burrito bowl and receive a fair (sometimes plentiful) amount of meat. 

On a good day when the line is short or non-existent, I'm in and out in less than five minutes. Can't complain.  Well, maybe about the parking.

Found Zaba's out here when i first moved to Las Vegas. Wasn't until after being out here for couple more years that I tried Chipotle who seemed to be the main known place for this burrito style. ( I tend to avoid franchises and chains)

Onto my order today. Grabbed a steak burrito from here on lunch. All in all it was good but seemed to lack the flavor one from Zaba's does. Chipotle is a tad cheaper and has way more locations. This one today was busy but I was still in and out in less than 5 minutes.

Unfortunately, this location is the one closest to my home and it is the worst I've ever been to. They are wildly inconsistent. They tend to be pretty busy and I think they try to skimp on portion sizes do they don't run out as fast. One day you have to pay for extra meat to get the same amount of meat you got on another day. And you pretty much always have to pay for extra meat to get what the normal portion is at other locations. With extra steak now being nearly $3, this is straight up ripping off the customers. If you're going to offer a double meat option and place a 40% upcharge on it, you better consistently define those portion sizes.

Some of the staff are quite polite and friendly while others are rude. This is pretty standard for fast food or fast casual establishments who employ young people for low wages so I wouldn't judge them on that. However, I have been there at 11am, when they open, and the line is wrapped around the store and out the door and not one staff member is in sight - all were in the back, apparently getting a pre-shift pep talk (you cound hear the cheer when it ended). Service did not start until 11:12! Some people had left.

So! In conclusion, be sure to ask for extra of all of your ""fixings""...everything but extra meat (or guac) is at no extra cost to you.

This Chipotle location is in a convenient shopping center and has a nice ambiance for a sit down or take out mexican grill food.

Pros:
- Awesome menu selection (I love their burrito bowls and sofritas options)
- Great food quality (I love how the guacamole comes free with the vegetarian salad bowl)
- Reasonable price (It costs me about $7.56 for a vegetarian salad bowl)
- Love the decor (a very urban and raw feel that add to the experience of dining in)
- Offers Non-GMO food now (yay, less toxic chemicals in our food!)

Cons:
- Lunch time rush can cause a longer wait time (as with anywhere)
- I wish they had more options than tap water and soda (offering alkaline water would be ideal)
- Menu ingredient list is not 100% organic (I would like to see this guarantee to take their quality to the next level)


Final Verdict:
I've been to this Chipotle countless times and love the consistency of their food quality and fairly fast lines. The food tastes great and is at a very reasonable price.

This location is tucked away in the back of the shopping mall, but there is plenty of parking and during lunch (around 12noon) it will get packed. I've seen people walk in and then out because the line was too long, so be sure to come a little bit early if you are in a rush.

The usual options are available for your choice - chicken, beef, barbacoa (shredded beef - a little spicy), pork. Now available is brown rice or white rice, and be sure to add the fajita mix (stir fried red onions and green peppers). 

They say there is a secret burrito menu, but still haven't found this. The only thing that I've tried is asking them to melt the cheese first (like a quesadilla) and then filling in the burrito - this way you get the melty cheese and the burrito wrap a bit more toasted.",6QFyYvYgN1XcVfxMMMWxGw,0,0,4,HARoUcvvieUMTfpnOcQcPg

I admit that I'm one of those people that are more likely to only take the time when writing a bad review. I think it's just as important to write good reviews to let people and owners know what goes on and this one seemed deserving.

It was only a simple gesture but it was very indicative of the type of employee she was which is why I'm recognizing it.

After picking up my order, which was very quick I might add, I was gathering napkins and utensils. I saw a collection of bottled sauces. These were not for to go but seeing them made me think about bringing some with my order. I noticed an employee who was not on shift but she was the first one I noticed after looking around for something to take a sauce home with. I was in a bit of a rush so, without thinking that she wasn't even in shift, I asked her for a to go cup. 

It was at this moment that I realized she was not on shift but I had already asked her. 

Most employees that aren't on shift would look for a way to not answer or to avoid my question. Not only did she answer but she stopped what she was doing to offer a solution. Part of me felt guilty for interrupting her after realizing that she was not even in shift and part of me was shocked at the speed of the selflessness. She didn't even hesitate and offered me cups to put the sauces in. 

This is what it's all about and I guarantee this young lady will be extremely successful in life. That kind of dedication and work ethic is what's lacking in society. Too often does society get on kids for being ungrateful or lazy but if this young lady is even a glimpse of the generation that is coming up then I think we will be just fine. 

And, too often do people forget to acknowledge good work. She reminded me of this. So, I am the one that's learning from her",FgyvflZtqRF03j5bIrlnlA,1,1,5,-jgqOoT7O0n6Dk1fFC-bww

I noticed the last few times when I ate at this location, it was very hit-or-miss with regards to presentation.  At times, the counter where the workers served the food just looked messy.  And sometimes the aprons would look messy.

I used to work in fast food and know what its all about.  I don't see any excuse for this.  I probably pay more attention than most people to this issue, so take it with a grain of salt.

That said - the vast majority of the people who work here are really good and friendly, and the food is very good, which is why I was a regular.

Now I tend to eat here a lot less often, simply because I feel it is a crap shoot as to whether the presentation will be OK or not.",CH2nGjRLku2GBDxMhrHNAg,0,0,3,s9MpzLL8FhPP0NeRVi4dzA

The reason for not receiving five stars is for the inconsistency of the size of their product. One time their bowl can weigh two pounds then the next time it can weigh 5 ounces with the exact same combinations of ingredients. It's the workers who dole out the portions that make it inconsistent. I don't know why they don't use measuring cups or spoons for the ingredients instead of tongs which are then eye-balled.,znpuWlUd8i3UefN4KSyXcQ,1,0,4,NqyFQz_5PnpK-VZ4JkpFrA

I guess he waited about 15 mins and they never called him to tell him it was ready so they sold it to other costumers. I waited in line patiently and then tried to order. The girl making the food made me repeat myself about 20 times...no exaggeration...because she was talking to people on the line. Then I tried to order and she laughed because they were out of soft taco tortillas. They only gave me two. Who I assume was the manager did nothing. As I tried to leave the door was locked..I asked if someone could let me out and they pointed to a side door and laughed at me like I was an idiot because they locked the door.

So this Chipotle location is everything you'd expect. They have a nice clean dining area, a small outdoor patio, it's set back in the corner of a large shopping area so the patio is reasonably quiet and enjoyable. The price for what you get here is well worth the value. My favorite is the Burrito bowl. Basically all the contents of a burrito with all the calories in a giant flower tortilla. So you basically get the same great taste without the extra guilt. For a small up charge of less than $2 you can request double meat! It's handy for the times you get the girl who's trying to save the company a little money by shorting you.

4259319,2017-12-05,1,AUl6myFhTAbEqt0GMdKHiw,"Chipotle is probably my hubby's favorite weekend restaurant to visit (we both have different meal types during the week). We've been to this one several times (more so since moving to Spring Valley), but seems like the one on Decatur/Sahara has been our go-to for the past couple years. 

This one doesn't seem busy any time that we've been here (but we didn't come to this one for the boo-rito special on Halloween), maybe because it is situated at one of the farthest corners of the shopping center (lot of dining options here). This one has indoor and outdoor seating. The shape of the interior is square-shaped. The counter (where you order and pay) is at the very front of the restaurant. To the left is the napkins, forks, sauces, drink machine, etc. And around the corner from that is the bathroom. On this side, is where you can access the outdoor seating. Decor is usually wood & metal, giving an industrial feel. Music playing is quite the mixed bag, with a bunch of weird music thrown in there (and I like different types of music, mind you, I'm from SF). Overall, it's pretty clean. The staff is nice, too. 

I've never had a problem with my food, but I think that hubby might've had an issue once or twice. I usually split a bowl with our son, and this might be his favorite meal, because our picky eater (I have to eat all the lettuce and onions) is always asking for more. I am still missing the chorizo, though (that was my favorite, and they discontinued it for queso). As for the remaining original meat offerings, I like the barbacoa, chicken, and steak, in that order. Our son't fave is the steak.

The meat guy (aka: the portion police [aaka: the inventory security]) was not my favorite person in the world. When I go to Chipotle, I always watch them like clockwork give me a sizeable fist full of meat for my burrito. I literally order the same thing every single time. This time I watched him fingertip some meat in there and transition his hands as if he's about to wrap it. I stopped him and asked if he could put a little more because I didn't feel it was that much, and he explained to me that what he gave was the normal portion. Now, again, at this point I had experienced a ""normal"" several times and I wasn't even being rude I just asked for a little more. He LITERALLY put a little more and threatened that anymore would be a double meat upcharge. To my disagreement, I actually apologized if I upset him but briefly explained I didn't want to pay $8.00 for a fast food burrito with very little of the premium ingredient and before I could even finish my APOLOGY, he cuts me off with this:

""It's cool, man. *Scoff* It's cool.""

I would call him out by name, but a bigger issue is that the other line people brushed it off as if nothing was abnormal which makes the endline issue: management. We're beefing, Chipotle.",4xgbVGM9yklvk8zrOf7tiA,1,0,3,_ojQ98wfbMNp1GYVTNTDJA

Over the years when you walk into any Chipotle like this one at Arroyo Crossing you know what you're going to find.

But just in case you've never been to a Chipotle before the other Yelp reviews can tell you how good the food itself is. 

So this review looks at...space...and cleanliness. The Arroyo Crossing location feels a bit smaller in floor space than some of their other Vegas locations.

We walked up to the counter to order.  No one greeted us.  There were 5 employees standing in front of us.  One was making two burritos for himself it seems like.  They were just chatting to each other.  The guy who made our food had his hands all over counters and on his apron and pockets.  Didn't wash his hands by the way before making our food. 
 The food....brown rice was served raw, not cooked al dente... not even close.  Meat were dried and lack of seasoning.  Same goes to their expensive guacamole.  Everything was super bland the last time we came here.  

FYI, they're charging the 3 tacos differently now.  We always order 3 tacos, 2 carnitas and 1 steak with guacamole.  They charged use individually for the tacos with individual guacamole charges of .75 cents... $1.95 is the regular charge with your meal, now it's $2.25 because they charged me like this.  We eat Chipotle often, I remember guacamole around $1.25 or so.  This is ridiculous.  They should tell people to get it in the container, it's $1.95.  They should have only charged us for the $1.95 as a one time courtesy since I said something.  They're too cheap to make a regular customer happy.

a few friends and I came in to grab a quick and delicious meal at what has always been one of my favorite little places. got in just before the rush, which is always nice.

everything was fine until we reached the condiments section of the building process. the young lady has no sense of any kind of listening skills.
My fiance asked for hot salsa, cheese and guacamole... instead he got lettuce... i don't know on what planet lettuce and guacamole sound the same but whatever, maybe its because they are the same color.... when we cried out ""no!!!'"" the young woman looked up at us, she rolled her eyes at me and said ""what?"" thats what you ordered."" I looked at her and said, ""no, he said guacamole."" and the dialogue continued...

chipotle girl- ""do you want me to take it off?""
fiance -""yes please that would be great""
CG- ""there its off"" (still a mountain of lettuce covering the majority of the burrito)
fiance - ""can you please get at least the big pieces off please? or could you maybe remake it?""

instead of removing the rest or just simply remaking the item she literally takes guacamole and covers the remaining lettuce and rolls the burrito closed.

CG - ""its fine the way it is""

Last time i check its not your call as to if its ""fine"" or not. another girl standing on the line next to her made a face to me as if to say ""oh my god i'm sorry she's crazy""

the problem associate then with a fierce attitude tossed the item into a basket and almost knocked it off of the counter.

I've literally NEVER has a worse experience from any other establishment. the manager on duty was busy so i chose not to bother her - the restaurant was beginning to fill and i didn't want to take away from anyone else's experience.

In closing I'm pretty sure mouthing off to a customer isn't in the chipotle employee handbook... our entire group was completely taken aback by the complete disregard for any kind of professionalism.

I frequent this area a lot so when I am hungry I usually hit up Chipotle. The food to me always seems pretty fresh. If you get there when the steak is just cooked, it will be on the rare side. They have a nice selection of tacos, kids meals, bowls & quesadillas.  They give you an option of white or brown rice, black or pinto beans, grilled veggies, steak/tofu/chicken/shredded beef/pork, hot/mild or pico salsa, corn, sour cream and lettuce. You can add guacamole for an extra charge which is a must. I always ask for a side of lime, cause I love lime on everything. You can get a big bag of chips or ""baby chips"" which is a super small bag not on the menu. 

They do serve alcohol, ice tea and a variety of soft drinks. The location usually can get very busy from 11-12 but with the E-coli scare it is never too busy which is good for me!",NsHeN5dKRmYfJTmTxMITmQ,2,1,4,4NgsJlJpGtcw3oYaMGbUew

Expect a very american taste to the food served here.  The burritos don't taste like authentic mexican burritos but nonetheless it's still very good.  The chicken burrito is my favorite and it's up to you individually of what you want inside you burrito, something similar to the subway concept.  I like mine with black beans, brown rice, hot & medium salsa, lettuce, sour cream and guacamole.  You can also order it in a bowl instead of having it in a tortilla to lessen the calories.

I do have one tip to customers. I made an online order with the steak meat on the side. NEVER ORDER THE MEAT ON THE SIDE.

I'm pregnant so I can't have raw meat, but I love chipotle. I didn't want to be a pain so I figured I'd just order it on the side and cook it to well done at home.

I only got a TINY little plastic tub of meat...I asked the lady at the register,""this is the meat on the side??"" She almost looked ashamed and said,""uhh, yea..""

*there's a photo reference.

Needless to say, I'm sure once I can eat undercooked meat again I'm sure I'll be back. Just sorta sucked because you pay so much for their food, you'd think they'd have larger containers nearby. Plus I know this is a special request.

My friend tried to make small talk with the girl who warms the tortillas and she was so exhausted and mentioned it had been busier than normal when my friend asked which is understandable. the girl who was working the line seemed upset as well. it was then I noticed the cashier, Jalon (whose name was on the receipt, which is really convenient when the employees don't wear name tags) was berating the girl working the line for a mistake she had made and for not being further on the pre closing checklist. my friend said to cut her some slack and I interjected that as a manager in my job, I've never treated my employees with such disrespect. she immediately responded that that was her friend and continued to berate the girl. Jalon rang me up incorrectly and when I corrected the order she yelled at the girl working the line and said loudly to me ""and see you were trying to defend her!"". it was such an uncomfortable situation and I noticed she continued to be rude and abrasive.

Chipotle as a whole is just consistently a good meal. They make healthy Mexican food possible and... cool! They post the calories on the their board, their menu has no fads or frills, it's just great fresh food ready to be eaten.

I always try to get the highest caloric meal I can for lunch.... also the most unhealthy. So I'm a barbacoa hard taco gal (yes they have hard shell tacos, just ask). I really enjoy their guacamole so I always get some to go with an order of chips.

I remember one time, we went close to their closing time and the person who helped me just packed it on. I mean, it makes sense if they do cause ... they don't pay for the stuff. But unfortunately, that person was the only one who packed it :( Everyone else likes to be skimpy. 

You can download their app now and order online for pick up. You get three customization too when you do it i.e. extra scoops.

       - Cheap - I love Chipotle, but this location's service and portion size has been dwindling in months past. It's to the point, I'd rather drive an extra 10 minutes when I'm getting a craving for burritos.
       - Strike #1 - Trying to charge me for double meat when I didn't ask for it and they only gave me the normal amount.
       - Strike #2 - Being so cheap with their portion size as compared to other Chipotle's in town.
       - Strike #3 - Treating their customers like criminals when they screw up and order or forget to give you what you ordered.
**Visit 1**
       - After getting the normal amount of steak I usually get from any other Chipotle, the cashier charges me for double meat.
       - When I told him I didn't order double meat, he had to verify with his staff (since he didn't trust me) and then tell them they'd have to ""talk"" later.
       - This shows me that they are actively trying to lower the amount of meat per portion.
**Visit 2**
       - Ordering a steak quesadilla, the amount of steak on there, couldn't even fit half the quesadilla.
       - When they cut it into 4 pieces, there was a 1/4 of the quesadilla that had 2 tiny pieces of meat on it.
       - I ordered a bowl and drinks as well that day. After I paid, I asked the cashier where my drinks were and she told me she gave it to the person I was with, who had walked to the drink area to get napkins.
       - When I looked over and saw this wasn't the case, I told the cashier. The cashier has to walk around the corner and actually visually see she had not given the drinks to us before actually giving me the drinks.
**Recommendations**
       - I wouldn't really recommend this place. There are many other Chipotle's around town that don't try to cheat you at every turn.",37S80IUIfb8yMsSwWWDsFA,2,1,1,2UPBAIyYF7l6mn5zyIhXcQ
