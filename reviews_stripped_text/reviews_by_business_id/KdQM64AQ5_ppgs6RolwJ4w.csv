Unfortunately, this place had a major renovation a year or two ago. They repainted the walls, and took down all these cool things off the wall. Rumor has it that ownership changed? Since they did that, i feel like food has gone down from what it was, but food is still the best in town. This place was the best mexican food ive ever had 2007-2011ish.
