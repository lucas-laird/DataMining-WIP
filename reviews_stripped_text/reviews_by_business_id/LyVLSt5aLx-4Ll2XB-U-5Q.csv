The pork for their broken rice was too salty and the pho was just so so. That's why we never came back. I was a little scared about trying this place again even though it's a different name now. Possibly under new management? We weren't sure but decided to give it a try still since we were meeting family here. The minute we walked in, we were greeted by two super friendly staff. They took our order right away and the food came fast. My husband and I ordered pho, spring rolls and egg rolls. My sister and brother-in-law ordered pho and bún. I was thoroughly impressed with how flavorful and tasty everything was. Also, nothing was overly salty. The service was top notch. The owner kept coming back to refill our water and also stopped to chat with us. I am glad I gave this place a try. I will definitely be back.",XQTY-9WrOpVjaueQ6ygFrA,1,0,5,_fWnjjB-OaN7wG1ii24cKg

That's good for me because it means that their food hasn't changed, just the name. This has been our go-to neighborhood place for pho. We've been going here since it was Annie Pho 2. 

Their food and service has always been consistently excellent. The pho broth is flavorful and they don't skimp on the items in the soup. You get plenty of noodles, meat, etc. in each bowl. I highly recommend the fresh spring rolls and butter fried chicken wings as appetizers. We've even ordered those items for parties and they've been big hits. In addition to their pho, I've tried their pork chop rice dish. Huge servings with two large pork chops and a fried egg over easy served on top to mix with your rice and pork chops. Like I said earlier, the rice and noodle dish servings are large and they don't skimp. They also serve desserts and Thai ice tea. 

If you're in the mood for great pho (or other Vietnamese dishes) served fast and with friendly service in a very clean environment, I highly recommend Red Lantern (formerly Annie Pho 2).",M0vWoaFVIJn3PfYPTI_uAQ,0,0,5,8XbM8mnNdYkZhb84sPZdWw

928260,2017-11-03,1,LyVLSt5aLx-4Ll2XB-U-5Q,"This place is unique in that the owner and staff are American. That's what sets this place apart:  No language barrier! No ""Vietnamese service"". Eric is amazing.

But that wouldn't matter at all if the food weren't good. The food is fantastic! I have been to most of the notable pho places in Vegas, and there are some really good pho places here, and let's be honest: the pho here is on par with the best of them. Yes, you can get better, maybe at Pho 88, for example, but hardly anywhere else.

And there are things that make Red Lantern special. That's what I look for, when adding a place to the pho rotation: something I can't get anywhere else. Here, you can get proper vegetarian pho, in case that one annoying friend is with you; vegetable pho made with vegetable broth that is actually really good, and unlike other places, the vegetarian options are clearly marked on the menu. I get the vegetable pho sometimes myself, and I'm not a vegetarian.

Here, you can get pho ga, chicken pho, with actual chicken broth. You'll have to ask for the chicken broth, but it is sooooo good. Most places don't do chicken broth, but here, it's available. And if you want the BBQ pork pho, you can get it with, believe it or not, pork broth! That's not something you can find most places! (It's a pork broth with a little chicken in it, what they use in the mi vit quay, the duck soup, and it is yummy.)

I got the shrimp spring rolls one time and they were great. They are served with lettuce sticking out the top, which doesn't affect the taste, but the presentation is great.

Also try the duck, the mi vit quay; it's not quite as good as you get at Pho 88 but it is so good you will make little noises while eating it. The beaf stew is great also.

Service is better than any other pho place in town, no comparison. No ""Vietnamese service"" here. Eric and Rich will take care of you. If you're used to the service at normal pho places this will be a revelation. You won't have to wait for your check, or to have your drink refilled. (Yes, refillable drinks, not brought in a can.)

The owner is clearly proud of what he's created here, and for good reason. Red Lantern is one of the best pho places in Vegas, a town that has a lot of really good pho.",JV0asALxmnJGmnfrHul0tg,3,1,5,SudtgkBuoGovXfy0DtjnAQ

Favorites:

Veggie pho (w/ beef broth)
Chicken curry soup

I always order the veggie pho. It comes with tofu, and what one would think is an entire garden of vegetables. I tend to love spice, so I always order an extra side of jalapeños so I don't have to share with friends. 

The chicken curry soup is so yummy but super filling, I like it's lighter cousin, pho. The chicken is tender, but it does come on the bone so be prepared to work for it a bit.

I remember Co workers told me they didn't like it here because it was slow and closed at random times, but I didn't let that stop me from trying again after the name change. Now I've visited several times and enjoyed every new item I've ordered. I went back and told my co workers how much it's changed and some have returned as regulars.

Red lantern is an exemplary place to enjoy Pho and Vietnamese style food. My first time ordering there I was able to selected the items that I wanted in my Pho, which is rare. Most places don't like straying from their own creations. Let me tell you...If you're looking for perfectly ROASTED DUCK this is the place to get it! I ordered the roast duck with rice as I have several times at different restaurants but this place beats them all by a long shot. No soggy, fatty skin here. It's perfectly roasted with crispy skin as it should be and the flavor is amazing! no bland food here. I also recommend the Kalbi short ribs and the ""Shaking Beef"".

He told me to sit anywhere then as he walked by he put a menu on my table without speaking or looking at me. He came back and asked if I'd decided in an ""you're wasting my time"" tone. No smile or engagement. I asked him about an item and he practically rolled his eyes. He left without asking me if I wanted anything to drink so I has to ask his back for a Thai tea. 
After that I saw him engage with a couple, smile, dote on them but for most people he seemed  uninterested. Apparently his name is Richard. He introduced himself to the couple so that's the only reason I know that.
First came the Thai tea. Super yummy but served in a to-go cup for some reason.
My spring rolls came out next. I ordered grilled pork, I got ham. Back they went to the kitchen.
Next up came my Red Lantern pho. It was actually very good, even better with the jalapenos. The only problem here is that I ordered it without tripe, and, you'll never guess, it had tripe! I took that out and enjoyed pretty much the whole bowl.
Lastly my new spring rolls came out but I was too full to eat them so I actually have no idea how they taste. I'm sure I'll find out during Friday night Netflix and nosh later.

It's good food, low prices, good service, and super close to where I live/work. It's not a five-star YOU HAVE TO EAT HERE. It's a personal five star...

Buuuut if you're a foodie and you're into trying ""new"" things, I highly recommend the curry chicken soup/pho. It's more on the savory/spicy side with a hint of coconut. I like my curries savory/spicy and avoid the sweeter ones so this absolutely did it for me. It has a generous portion of bone-in chicken in it. If you're less adventurous and more of a picky eater, you might ask for something boneless, but I feel like the bone-in is more flavorful than other chicken pho I've had, but this might have more to do with the curry than the presence of the bone in the broth. 

So if you've been eyeing this place for a while and been curious about this chicken curry pho, go for it. Besides the chicken curry, I've had the garlic chicken wings (good, but I wouldn't specifically come here for it - Big Wong's has spoiled me), pho of all kinds (good if you're in the area and in the mood), the Com Bo Luc Lac C7 (this is a solid 4 out of 5 stars and I prefer it to the short ribs which I've also had).",iG-V0nBbeD-pnIcquXH5YQ,2,0,5,_JcIMf9Q2eLSZuEL8MaPCQ

My husband absolutely loves any type of Asian Cuisine. I personally find most of it to be greasy but I have found that Vietnamese cooking and pho is pretty good and if made properly not too greasy.

I didn't know what to expect so I got my bravery badge out and decided to look at what the yelpers were saying and order based on what they recommended. Best decision ever!

I brought it home... My husband and I tore into it like two hungry Truckers... We moaned and slurped everything up in about 20 minutes.

I'm a fan of the basics like shrimp spring rolls, Vietnamese egg rolls, and pho tai and they are on par with most others. 

My boys love the shrimp fried rice. It's a generous portion with a good amount of shrimp. And it's got good flavor and lots of egg and veggies mixed in. I do hate that they leave the tails on. This is a pet peeve. Then, I have to dig through the hot, greasy food to remove the tails. Not ideal.

I eat gluten free for health reasons, so this was a bummer.  2.  They brought straw after straw for no apparent reason. (plastic hurts the ocean) That, and they use Styrofoam for their ""to go"" containers.  It's cheap and not good for the environment.  3.  The waiter seemed to need to be anywhere than with us.  He was a young waiter, but it's no excuse for good service.  4.  He didn't offer sweetener of any kind for my tea, and when he brought my tea refill, it was bitter like it had been sitting for too long.  5.  No pen with my check to sign the credit card slip.

I'm pretty sure we got the egg rolls from the table next to us, because our food came super fast and they ended up getting their egg rolls towards the end of their meal.  Also my combo pho states there's rare steak....it was all cooked.  I hope they sort everything out and ordering/receiving food becomes a little less chaotic.  We still thoroughly enjoy the fried egg rolls and the beef stew.  My husband tried a new item the egg wrapped fried rice. It was a huge amount of food and very tasty.  I probably would not order the pho again....I'll probably stick to my beef stew.  The pho was minimal in terms of meat and smaller bowl then a lot of the places in Chinatown.  We'll keep coming because it's one of the few decent pho restaurants near Summerlin.",Tdv7HZa4Hyjm-X0MtNmeag,3,3,4,2uPHkIfYswdm6ic4_fVZ2g

We ordered the spring rolls which had a beautiful presentation. The rolls were very fresh and tasted fantastic. I ordered the chicken Pho. The broth was the best ever, very flavorful. The soup had plenty of big chunks of chicken. The Thai basil and bean sprouts that were served with it were fresh and aromatic.
The service was excellent and the restaurant was very clean. We will definitely be coming back and we will bring friends. If you have not tried this type of food before you will want to eat here.",0TwshE0TaOF-0fpJshDA5A,1,0,5,KDh47cbVWBAQRYDqCsZBFQ

The food is so good and they have such a great variety of veggie options. Service is awesome. The owner stops by all the time and it's one of those places where you feel like they genuinely care that you have a good experience. 

Inside is super clean and spacious. Used to go when it was Pho Annie's and now love it just the same. Perfect as the weather starts to cool off. 

Andddd the prices are so reasonable. An order of veggie potstickers are 5.99 and comes with 10! You just can't beat that.",xrvyW1ruKS0uz9RtFewC0Q,3,3,5,RPxOuJ0BbxXnfzOMzTqy3g

Pro tip: get extra noodles! It's just a buck or two and, if you're like me, you'll appreciate the extra noodles o go with the delicious broth!",_kQTpPxOGscUIkSI2C7nMw,0,0,5,Dok9XfKyc9tfFbIKXMGpzA

Service: always friendly and attentive.  I know they know their customers, not just us. And it's a great thing to notice. 
Food: we are vegetarian/ pescatarian. And I just love the veggie pho or the seafood pho with veggie broth. The bowls are a great size for a great price! We also love the crab ragoons, fresh spring roll, and veggie gyoza.

Lots of windows and the tile floor remained a little slippery on a winter day.  So many windows and it just added to the dampness inside.  Mainly Caucasians working which was different but cool  My pho wasn't huge like i am used to.  It was almost luke warm and lots of noodle with little meat.  Price was fair and service was okay.  I asked my girlfriend about her pho and she said the same.  I would consider to come here just because of the close  vicinity to my girlfriend.,DsVnd4PH2nkbxo8UeGW3Mw,0,0,3,Vwby8xtLdJ-RnAyrGPsG5Q

So I have to say the boneless pork was amazing, on top of it I love how it came with 2 eggs. The flavor was perfect, not too sweet, not too bland, just perfect! 

I also tried the Pho with rare steak and meatball, that was delicious as well! Ingredients were fresh and soup was tasty. 

I tried the fried egg rolls as well, this one was ok, although not as good as my mom's.

The Thai iced tea was really good as well!

So in summary, good food, clean place, nice and peaceful ambience, also there are a few large tables in the back that can accommodate larger parties even if the place is not that big, very decent prices - $10 and under, great service!
