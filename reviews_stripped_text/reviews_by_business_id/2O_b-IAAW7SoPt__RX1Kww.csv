Came for the breakfast buffet. Most of the food was barely hot or fresh for my first plate. Second plate was not so bad. Coffee was terrible. Took one sip and left the rest. Had to get up and ask for water. Got the water with no straw.

281827,2015-12-28,0,2O_b-IAAW7SoPt__RX1Kww,"This is a Buca Di Beppo, part of the chain, but with the caveats of being open for breakfast and buffets all day.  I believe the breakfast buffet is $13 ($12 for total rewards members, anything over 10 bucks is a dollar less), the lunch buffet might be $14 or $15, and the dinner buffet is $20.  The hours listed on Yelp are not the hours written by the door.  The door claims 7am-10pm Sun-Thu and 7am-11pm Fri-Sat, although the restaurant is indeed closed 3pm-5pm.

I went for breakfast.  Their main draw is the breakfast buffet of course, every menu item is more expensive.  I didn't get the buffet but I looked at it, the former Sidewalk Cafe that was in this location had a better buffet.  All I saw was cereal, oatmeal, scrambled eggs, sausage links, hash browns, and pastries.  I didn't even see bacon, perhaps I missed it.

I ordered off the menu, had the Las Vegas Scramble which contained turkey sausage, veggies, cheese; it was pretty good but it was an omelet and not a scramble.  My friend ordered, among other things, cranberry juice, which was probably a 6oz glass for $4.

Service was somewhat sparse, place was clearly understaffed.

Gets quite busy for breakfast, be prepared to wait in line for 10-15 minutes if you come after 9am when Vegas is busy.  They are not affiliated with Total Rewards, so having a high level players card doesn't allow one to cut in line.

Probably the lunch and dinner buffets are considerably better.",067c1_-jqAaynl1--jWyqQ,0,0,2,G7Yj8VXf5qpvOwtieG0q2g

Hoping for the great Italian food that the main Buca is known for, we ordered the Shrimp Fra Diavolo, but started with garden salads. The salads were soggy & not very tasty. When the Shrimp dish arrived quickly it was a relief ... until I tasted it. I was expecting a spicy red sauce with medium sized shrimp over al dente penne pasta. What we got was sticky pasta with tiny salad shrimp in a tasteless orangish, gluey sauce. Think Chef Boyardee was cooking the night we stopped in because I make better sauce at home & I use canned tomato sauce. Only positive of our experience was the service & the iced tea.

1622056,2015-09-21,4,2O_b-IAAW7SoPt__RX1Kww,"My companion and I have attended a lot of conferences in Vegas; big conferences that provide buffet breakfast for their thousands of attendees.  The included breakfasts we've received at these convention-center steam tables are several times better than what we had here last Saturday.

We were looking for a place with much better reviews called ""Sterling Buffet,"" which appeared from our phone maps to be somewhere inside Bally's (a hotel/casino I'm not familiar with).  But no Bally's employees that we asked could direct us to this place.  They pointed us to Buca.  One pointed us to BLT Steakhouse.  Several of the people we asked couldn't even speak English.  What we should have done is entered the concourse to Paris Las Vegas and noshed at the creperie or nearby bakery.  But we were dumb and impatient.  Friends, don't make the same mistake we did.  Turn around, and RUN, run I say, to the Paris concourse.

We waited in a fifteen-minute line to enter this den of suck, despite the fact that anyone could see from the line that the restaurant was barely 1/3 full.  As we were waiting, the hostess announced that things would be buffet-only from here on out, no more ordering.  No more waffle bar, no more omelets, no more cooked-to-order dishes.  All right, whatever (yet another point at which we should have turned heels and run, but alas, we did not).

Multiple hostesses came and went, tapping things into the console at the hostess station, but not seating anyone.  Maybe one party would get seated every five minutes.  It's got to be really hard to find available tables when more than two-thirds of them are vacant, and it's a buffet, so the level of waitering required is minimal.  How do places like this stay open?

When we got in there, for $13, you get your choice of liquidy, oily scrambled eggs, bacon crumbs floating in grease at the bottom of an empty stainless serving bowl, limp hashbrowns, two dried-out link sausages, limp French toast slices, a selection of fruit running the gamut from unripe honeydew to unripe cantaloupe cubes, and yogurt and cereal (with an empty pitcher of milk).

A waitress came over with two water glasses, one of which was cloudy at the bottom, as if still coated in dishwasher soap residue.  We asked her to replace it; she did.  When we were about halfway done glumly eating or shoving aside the truly gadawful prison fare that we'd salvaged from the buffet, our waiter finally bothered to come around asking if we'd like something to drink.  For reasons I couldn't tell you, he brought two more waters, so we now had four water glasses on the table.  Unlike any other breakfast buffet I've ever been to, including in Europe, coffee was an additional $2 charge.  He brought two cups of it, though only one of us ordered it, and charged for the unused cup (he did remove it from the bill upon request).

The flatware was dirty and spotted; I scraped a tomato seed off my fork; the spoon was filthy and unusable.  I asked for a replacement, but it never came.  My companion's spoon was dirty, too, so I ended up just wiping down and using the spoon handle to stir my coffee.

Restaurant is insanely large. Looks nice inside, and very clean. They seemed to have some sort of buffet toward the rear of the massive section of the dining rooms we were in.

We entered at 13:00. 
Maybe at about 13:35, Anthony brought us gross-smelling bread with rock hard butter, but no silverware; other people who were getting serviced by other waitresses immediately had silverware at their table. We started getting our food at 13:52, and it was bland and not good. We ordered the Baked Ziti and Prosciutto Chicken.  It wasn't even worth getting the rest of it to-go.

Breakfast sausage/Kielbasa: standard low quality salty meats you get in the frozen section of a supermarket
Oatmeal: they should put the bowls closer to the oatmeal. Limited topping selection, raisins and brown sugar. Have to watch the cost. 
Biscuits/fried chicken/gravy. Stale/chicken tastes frozen. 
French toast: syrup coagulates quickly forming chunks. Odd. Something funny; even the cheap High fructose syrup doesn't do this.

Mediocre is the best I can say. The coffee is dark dark dark, which had even my dark roast-loving companion adding an insane amount of cream. Eggs look like they started as powder which, of course they did, but you don't have to crumble them into grains so they LOOK like powdered eggs. Fruit selection is poor. Pastry selection is okay in appearance, not so great in flavor. Bacon, sausage and yogurt are nice. French toast is nice but not warm enough. No omelet station or toast station. The Sidewalk Cafe that was here last time we came through was much better. Still mediocre, but slightly better value (same price, slightly better food with a bigger selection).

Pasta is a good sized portion, lasagna is more than satisfactory.

We had never been to this location but had stayed at Bally's before. There was a little bit of a wait but not too bad. The location is really elegant for a Bucca di Beppo. Not what you'd expect. But pleasantly surprised. 

We had a very good waiter by the name of Buddy. He was very attentive and quick on waiting on us. Good personality. What you'd like to have with a server. 

We ordered the spicy chicken rigatoni, small. Which was more then enough for us to make a dent in but had to definitely take the rest home. We wanted to leave room for their Cannoli's. So yummy and not badly priced for the size and amount you get. 

Overall loved the atmosphere, the staff and food. We like Bucca di Beppo alot. So glad this one is so nice and friendly. Thank you for a great date night for my husband and I.",E7wn_-kRX5FjTeK1yzQw0A,4,3,5,6dmXZfisgz8Ot7NS-8nKxg

5039525,2016-10-07,4,2O_b-IAAW7SoPt__RX1Kww,"What an awful experience this was.  To me, this dated and sad establishment tucked away in a casino corner is what the depressing parts of Las Vegas look like.  I knew it was a bad idea even before I suggested it.  

Our terse and automatically defensive server was a bear to deal with.  The exact opposite of what it was supposed to be.  The food was barely edible and the place smells awful.  

*  Welcome Experience
-  Ordinary

Nothing to note here.   

*  Establishment
-  Awful

It smells bad.  That's the first thing you'll notice.  It's dated and depressing in my opinion.  You be the judge.   

*  Service
-  Awful

Our server was bored and disinterested and passively defensive all at the same time. Zzzzzzz.  So over it.  More about why in the food section.  

*  Food Quantity / Quality / Presentation
-  Awful

On this visit we ordered Lasagne ($27.99 for the small) and the Prosciutto Stuffed Chicken ($27.99 for the small) and the Green Beans.  There were four of us.  Our server says ""The Lasagne is tiny, about the size of a little red brick.  That's not going to be enough for you.""  I asked, ""It's $30 for a tiny brick of Lasagne?""  He prattled out some explanation.  So that's when we added the second $30 ""small"" entree - the stuffed chicken.  

Bread was brought.  It was very dry and lacked any character or flavor.  I'm glad there was something to dip it in. The Lasagne arrived and sure enough it was small.  Three pieces of chicken came with the order.  

The Lasagne was like baby food.  Mushy with overcooked, waterlogged pasta in the center.  The edges were dark where it sat under the heat lamps.  It lacked any remarkable qualities and was just barely edible.  

The chicken meat was overcooked, chalky and seized up.  It was smothered in sauce and cheese, but you knew when you bit into that awful texture.  

The green beans were overcooked and brown.  When the server put them down, I said, ""that doesn't look very appetizing to me, does it look good to you?""  He replied, ""Ehhhh, looks like they cooked them a little too long maybe.""  Huh?  I WANTED to ask, ""Then how did they make it to my table?""  He said he would get another one started and walked away.

We left a full piece of chicken on the entree plate and the four of us had the uneaten remains on our plates   He came with the new order of green beans which were also
discolored and slimy.  When he returned we explained that all three items were very poorly executed. He brought the bill without the green beans but left the other two $30 entrees on there.  We paid and left with having had a horrible and unreconciled experience.

The staff, decor and the food all match here.  It's obvious that nobody cares.  I paid my fee to BDB for this experience and will never return.  I'll also use Yelp to be more creative in the future with my dining selection.",W8Rf7y6vPn4c5WJvSGbRng,6,1,1,65pN2wzFpgObEaeVjNzvIA

There were 5 of us so my kids ordered from the dinner buffet and my husband and I ordered from the main menu. The buffet for the kids was pretty lackluster in terms of selection but for them it was fine. I would have been starving. 

Now for the main menu I was impressed. They had a lot of similar items from Buca Di Beppo but they also had some new unique ones of their own. I started of with a chocolate vixen cocktail that had whiskey in it, but I wasn't loving it so I ordered a Jameson on the rocks and that was much better. Our server was pleasant and happy to fix it.

We started off with a Caprese salad that was the freshest I have ever had. OMG the tomatoes and basil were so colorful and tasty! Then we had the Italian salad which I loved because it had green olives it in and it was topped with crispy prosciutto. Their dressing is incredible! Next up was the cheesy garlic bread! Delicious.

For our main entrees we had chicken picatta, garlic mashed potatoes, mac and cheese for my little one and a dessert so huge the 5 of us couldn't even finish it! Chef Shaylee is the executive chef and she came out to check and see how we were enjoying our meal. (there was hardly anyone in the restaurant at the time) which i thought was really nice!!
