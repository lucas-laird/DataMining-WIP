97478,2017-01-29,0,zYKNDLEExBNKQQrW6vvz_Q,"So my husband and I went there tonight for dinner (hubby has been wanting to try it for sometime now). We went in at 9:40PM and the entire restaurant was empty less two patrons at the bar talking with the bartender. We stood there about five minutes before another worker came out from the back (the bartender looked over at us at least twice but couldn't be bothered to greet us) and proceeded to tell us that they had ""last call"" at 9:30PM and they were closed for the night. Pretty interesting, since their hours of operation are posted as being open 5pm-1am daily. Must be rough working a whole four hours and closing down when you feel like it. Needless to say we won't be back, and I'm guessing they won't be around very long since they want to close up shop three and a half hours early and turn away paying customers.",vgHrJWuR3ZBBmWW9AN0oKw,4,1,1,OtUYydwHpFSsDor8JjlHlQ

I called prior to see if the crawfish was fresh/live and they said yes & that there was a special, buy one & get the second on free. I couldn't pass up this offer, so I had to try it. When I got there, I clarified to the server that I want fresh crawfish. When I got my food, all of my food was nuke warm & my crawfish was not fresh. Just about 1/4 of the insides were black and I was disappointed.

The only plus I did enjoy here were the mussels. Very plump and larger. But after a bad crawfish experience and ok food, I do not think I'll pay a second visit. Also, The prices are a bit higher than their competitors.",ZgzRXqtwueWeHW_-nCWeXA,2,0,1,1Uf4LyrYzTK0GFo-XL8EFw

1030428,2017-02-06,3,zYKNDLEExBNKQQrW6vvz_Q,"It was okay:/

DRINK: I like that they have a bar so if you just want to grab a drink, their bartender was really funny and friendly.

FOOD: Their seafood comes with a choice of lemon pepper, garlic butter, or rockin combo sauce. The Rockin combo sauce comes with actually habanero peppers! If you are like me and can't eat spicy, just be warned that the original spicy level was still to spicy. I recommend getting clams, it is fresh and is really tasty. The crawfish was what really disappointed me...it was way overcooked. It is great that the crawfish is fresh and not frozen, but a crawfish restaurant should be able to flawlessly cook crawfish. I have to say my favorite thing about this place is the garlic noodle. It is a great pairing for the seafood. Tried a few other dishes here, but nothing really stood out.

ATMOSPHERE: 20% grand opening special until mid-February. The staff was absolutely friendly and attentive. I never had to ask for anything because they were really prepared. The brought gloves, bibs, lemon and pepper and all the basics you need to eat seafood.

1697161,2017-04-30,0,zYKNDLEExBNKQQrW6vvz_Q,Sad experience for me. Prices unexpectedly high-family of mine ordered the crawfish very disappointed the crawfish was very small only a few big ones in one of the dishes -my out-of-town family had to go out to a second restaurant after finished eating here due to lack of food our bill was $100 for four people and all we ordered was 2 pounds of crawfish 1 pound of king crab and one bowl of gumbo! We also got one root beer float and one orange cream float -the floats where honestly disgusting the cups tasted like dirty soap water the soda had no fizz! I wonder if they bought the soda at the $.99 store or the dollar tree? Crab is a delicacy of mine that I love I can't say I loved their crab it didn't seem cooked right the flesh was sticking hard into the shell as if it hadn't been boiled long enough to separate and the shell was extremely hard to crack felt like rubber also like it hadn't been cooked long enough! on a More positive note -seasoning was OK and the service was fast-but I think the service was fast because there was only one other person in the entire restaurant. I was going to go to Sakana sushi but the line was long and the family was hungry I have many regrets about not waiting. Taco Bell would have been a better choice. Long story short I would never go back.,Eym2jbYitMY_TF1Drovxkg,0,0,1,hlseB401m5B1A1iKF4_0sg

1964102,2017-01-31,2,zYKNDLEExBNKQQrW6vvz_Q,"Preface: It's still their grand opening, so they're still figuring things out. We went here on a slow night. Only one other table when we arrived. Just three others when we departed. It's located in the Target shopping center, near-ish to UNLV.

The service was...alright. Not exactly upbeat and enthusiastic. And we had to ask for every single thing - gloves, tools, etc.

The decor is cute - is all boombox-oriented, pained in bright colors, and there's even a wall of cassette tapes. Very cool. There's a bar with seating and then several tables.

This is a spot similar to Hot 'n' Juicy and Boiling Crab. They have crawfish, king crab, shrimp, mussels, clams, and dungeness crab. They have a couple different seasonings/broths, or you can choose the Rockin' Combo, which is all of them combined. You also choose your spice-level from mild to volcano. They also have corn, potatoes, and sausage to add to it. And you can get fries, chili cheese fries, sweet potato fries, wings, etc., etc. on the side. They did seem to have more sides than at the other similar places. They also have noodles and rice. 

The beer list was ok - better than average, but not great. There was no beer/cocktail menu. We had to ask the server what beers they had, and he wasn't particularly knowledgeable about them. 

So on to the food... The oysters were disgusting. They were, honestly, the crappiest oysters I've ever experienced. Ever. Skip these entirely. They were tiny, very thin, and ick. They were served with slices of lemon and cocktail sauce and tarter sauce on the side. The cocktail sauce was pretty good. The tarter sauce was meh. It would've been nice to have a fork and/or spoon or something. But nope, you don't get those things.

The bags of seafood were served double-bagged and in a black plastic tub. I appreciated the tub as it gave you the option of dumping it all out into the tub and helped mitigate some of the mess. 

The shrimp was quite yum. It was cooked better than at other similar places. The king crab legs were quite substantial and larger than at other similar place. The seasoning/broth was tasty. It was a little thicker than at other similar places, which I liked. The flavor was slightly different than those similar places, but nothing so different or noticeable that you could pinpoint it.

The cajun waffle fries were a good-sized portion and the fries were large and thick, especially for waffle fries. They were served with sides of ketchup and ranch. I appreciated the addition of the ranch, but it wasn't good ranch.

The tools we received, after asking for them, were two cracking thingys and a pair of scissors. The pair of scissors were nice for cutting the crab legs. However, one of those digger thingys to get the crab meat out would've been helpful. I was using the scissors to try to poke the meat out, which didn't work all that well.

Oh, and the bibs are just paper. They are very easily torn and don't have a pocket thing at the bottom to help catch things. In other words, they weren't particularly helpful when it comes to messiness. There were also no wipes offered. And when we flagged our server down inquiring about gloves, we were given latex gloves, which seemed a bit strange. The plastic ones are a better way to go.

The prices here were also higher than at similar places. But since the king crab legs were bigger and the shrimp cooked better, I wouldn't consider it overpriced. The service could've been better. And they can definitely do better when it comes to tools and things to help keep you clean.

All in all, this place could be great. Maybe it'll be better in time. But I didn't get all the 5-star hype during my visit. And seriously, WORST oysters EVER.",YMgZqBUAddmFErxLtCfK_w,5,3,3,vQQilp9iHhXfXkjaPvEbVA

Mike was very personable as well! He came around to all the tables introducing himself and asking if we were happy with everything.

Food: spicy even for original...crablegs big and tasty, shrimp big as well and comes with corn, sausage and potatoes.
It was an all you can eat special which changed the next weekend to 2 -5p...who wants a heavy meal like that at 2pm!!!
Anyways, I will def come back and refer friends to this place, but they def needs to scale down spice level on original. Some ppl can't tolerate too much spice for whatever reasons.
How about No spice in original???

Atmosphere: old school soda machines and vintage pics. Awesome!! TVs throughout made it nice to watch the games if that's what you're into.

The flavor was on point. For it being the original spice level it had a great kick to it. It starts off with some heat then you can taste sweetness. I really enjoyed their combination special which consisted of crawfish, shrimps, snow crab, potatos, and sausages. The crawfish was very fresh.

Let me start with the garlic noodles that I was thrilled to see as a menu option. So delicious with just the right amount of everything and goes well with the all of the menu option. This trip I ordered a pound of snow crab legs for myself and a pound of king crab for my company. We topped both off with corn, potatoes and sausage which gives it a little extra taste if you ask me. We also ordered some gumbo that was sooo good. I normally do not like gumbo with okra in it, but I actually like theirs. The music here is always ROCKIN they were playing Future when we walked in today. I was like ""OKAY!"" lol. As soon as you come in they have this cool wall displaying a bunch of old radios and speakers, I think it's pretty creative. Overall the atmosphere is pretty laid back. The waiters are always nice and right on time with the wet naps (because I don't use the gloves :-) EVER lol).

I expected the place to be packed like it is when we usually walked by but there was only one couple when we arrived at 7 o clock. We were greeted by a young woman with poofy hair and To be honest she wasn't the most friendly hostess I had ever met. She looked up at us from her desk and motioned toward the dining room saying "" sit anywhere"" so we took a seat at one of the tables covered in a paper table covering. a man gave us our menus then recommended we get the special which is 1/2 pound of shrimp, half pound of snow crab, half pound of crawfish, and potatoes, corn, and sausage all for 25$. We seasoned ours in garlic butter and went for the 'original' on spice level. We also got a side of seasoned waffles fries. The food came out quickly. It was hot and well seasoned. The garlic wasn't overwhelming and it was just spicy enough to hit the spot but not over do it. It took us almost two hours to de-shell all the food. We mostly ate everything but when we rounded up our eating experience, we still had half a basket of waffle fries and lots of crawfish. This place is awesome. My only complaint is everyone there seems to be lacking proper manners. We thanked the staff multiple times before leaving (we kept having to repeat ourselves) and still never received a ""you're welcome"" or a ""come back again"".

We sat at the bar with ""Shug White"" . The music was jumping and even though not many people were there , it sure still felt like the party popping . I miss my old bar from home and this place made me feel right at home. I cant forget my bartendar Shug ! He was just great , I love IPA's and he let me sample one , some tangerine idk whatever it is i know he will know next time im in. He also let us know about Happy Hour and the 20% off until the 14th ! Thanks for the great service and we will be back ! 

Dont forget to sign the bar and eat the deep fried oreos !",5-ZMg3r5mZHc0Z-VipQoUw,2,0,5,jZw_QUrJbG8CBPAktXoBhA

Ordered a pound of shrimp which was about $15.99/ market price. I don't remember how much was the crawfish by the pound but it was very delicious.

Each rice cost about $2 a cup. The Rockin Combo wasn't that spicy at original spice level which is good because I enjoyed it pretty well. I love the garlic butter, usually other places flavor wasn't that good for garlic butter but this place definitely brought that flavor out. The shrimp was really huge and the crawfish was juicy and fresh. The space in this restaurant is a little small but very clean.
