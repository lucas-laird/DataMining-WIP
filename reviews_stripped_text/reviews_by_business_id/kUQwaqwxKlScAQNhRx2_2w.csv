I think a lot of the negative reviews about customer service are simply written by impolite people. You don't have to have worked in food services to understand that things happen. It takes a good business and quality employees to make me write anything on yelp.

One could be angry that they were delivered cold food or they could not just assume that the workers didn't give a ****. What if the customer really just wants to eat regardless of temp and would be more pissed at you making things fresh and taking longer than just delivering things at room temp? Sure, they could call and check but then they're admitting fault and taking time on an order that should already be set while dealing with a large wave of customers. Every impatient person is already irritated. Every patient customer feels taken advantage of.

The RIGHT way to do customer service in this situation was to do exactly as they did. Deliver as soon as they can and if the food isn't up to par, making good on your purchase by offering fresh food or your money back and an apology.

Realistic people really can't ask for more without asking for too much. All the rest of you should chill.",4S2TVX7iiCws9vAYG9T0Ng,5,2,5,BniysJRP9TFcFiYgndUELA

I ordered a pizza for delivery to my hotel on my trip to Vegas.   It was with out a doubt the worst pizza I have ever tried.  The cheese didn't  taste right, the crust was like a soggy bread.  I literally could not eat one slice and pizza is my favorite food.  My thinking has always been that there is no such thing as a terrible pizza.

So I called to tell them and the manager was great.  She said to pick something else and they would bring it by.  I chose the chicken parm grinder and that was also way below standard.  I squeezed the chicken and a lot of bad looking oil came oozing out.   The roll was pretty good.  I ended up just eating that.

Maybe they were having a bad day but based on my experience, beware!

Called for chicken fingers and fries at 1:29 PM - not exactly the busiest hour of the day. Order taker said 40-45 minutes. That should have been my first clue. Called at 50 minutes and they said he was just down the street. Called at an hour and they said 3-4 minutes tops. At an hour and 10 minutes they promised to refund my money (in approximately 5 business days). Still no food. At 2:48 the driver called - from the wrong hotel - said he was right out front. I said ""no you're not since I'm standing outside and you're not here."" Food handed over at 2:52...a full 1:23 minutes after I called in the order. Food is COMPLETELY cold. And it's too bad...actually looks like it might be pretty good. We'll see when we put it in the microwave after we get back 'cause we have to get over to the convention center.

Yeah. Chicken fingers & fries...one hour and twenty-three minutes.

Update:
After getting back from a basketball game and some vicious microwaving, our food was actually very good. So if you know you're going to be hungry for some great food in about two hours, please, call Boston Pizza.

One thing he was excellent at was repeating the order to ensure accuracy yet when I received the order there were fried mushrooms added to the bill. The delivery man was even less thrilled about his job too. Perhaps this is understandable, but he refused to speak to me and only pointed to what he needed from me.

In the last six or eight months, something changed. The crust tastes like Domino's now (not good) and the last two times I've had their delivery, it's been incorrect. And slow. I do like their two-fer Tuesdays but not enough to have them screw up the rest of the meal I order (usually a meatball sub and an order of onion rings).

I like that their onion rings are battered rather than breaded. They're so good!

The cheese they use is pretty good, and is piled high and roasted to perfection, and the sauce is just your basic tomato sauce, but I do have to note that it doesn't have that acrid ""I just came out of a can and am gonna give you Alzheimer's"" aftertaste. The crust takes the show though. I think they're using a combination of baking soda and yeast, so it still has the complexity in flavor that the yeast will give, and the baking soda gives it that thin crusty outer layer, perfect for reheating in a toaster oven the next day. 

They deliver pretty much anywhere in the Downtown area, and they are super fast. (Last time I ordered, they had my pizza here in less than 15 minutes) 

Oh, and if your gonna try them out, order a pickup on Tuesdays, they have the 2 for 1 special which ain't bad for two medium pizzas at 11.99 a piece ;-)

I called up and fumbled my way through ordering a large pizza with extra sauce, extra cheese, and black olives - my standard pizza, in the process confusing the hell out of the poor guy on the other end of the phone and apologetically told him that I was extremely intoxicated.  Now, for the life of me, I seriously cannot remember what exactly the ominous note that the front desk agent threw in, but it may have been one of the following:

1. Extra cheese was probably unnecessary.  Jeeeeeesus christ, that pizza had a metric freakin' ton of cheese on it.
2. The cheese, while not BAD, was lowest-common denominator mozzarella and mega greasy.  Considering that I had like 32lbs of it on my pizza, this made for a pretty greasy pie.
3. Extra sauce was also probably unnecessary.  The sauce was pretty thick and rich as it was.  A little on the acidic and salty side, but not bad.
4. The crust was actually about as cooked as I liked it, meaning that it was pretty lightly done rather than crispy.  The dough, however, was a bit sweeter and tangier than I expected.
5. Although it really was not a bad pizza, it was not a Boston-style pizza - it doesn't have the Boston/NY-style thin/foldable crust... it's pretty standard, rest-of-America-style pizza.

All told, while it wasn't hardly the best pizza I've ever had, it was precisely what I wanted at that moment: a simple pizza as ballast for all of the alcohol in me... the sort of pizza that's always there when you need it, like that bro who's kind of thick, but always has your back and keeps the engine running out front, you know?  The pizza passed the hangover test, too: it was still alright when I stumbled out of bed mumbling about winning a Camaro the next morning even though it wasn't refrigerated (w00t, keepin' it classy), and I didn't actually end up eating again until fairly late the following night because it was probably the most fattening thing I'd eaten in at least a couple months.",3Kl3oO_jgwmMY8sMI_2wKQ,0,0,3,8kesq7rHxrb8-t5ZU3gmKQ

Open 24 hours and basically in the parking lot of Olympic Garden. Daily/weekly specials and great prices. Pretty sure it's a family owned and operated spot. They are always courteous, and genuinely kind. Oh and get a side of ranch no matter what you order, cuz the ranch is just that good.",NjNJ1JLnMlOfnDI6Oz6Qew,3,2,5,f7ws7KHAVIuy6q6OX7R3-A
2583619,2017-12-17,0,kUQwaqwxKlScAQNhRx2_2w,"Listen to my whole review. This place is a hole in the wall. Literally a hole in the wall, and not even a good looking one. Im the kind of guy who was raised eating at upscale restaurants and I was taught if something was wrong with your food, send it back. I stumbled in on this place before and it was on accident on my way to a damn bus stop, literally. I love small restaurants and respect places like that and I've been to a few places from Guy's Diners Drive-in's and Dives and lets be honest' if Guy gets a free meal, the place will get a good review and the places always sort of suck. Now you want over-priced wings that rock, go to wing stop and enjoy those amazing wings that destroy your wallet and are what youd expect. Its traditional with usual flavors and its a big company and yeah its good for what you get. But BOSTON PIZZA. you come to this neighborhood that looks kinda sketchy, and you step out of the car after you park and immediately your nose catches a whiff of heaven. So you want a good italian place thats not too pricy, but you want something thats worth what you pay and something that will exceed in flavoring your bite... Your tastebuds here are gonna die a little on the inside. Is it the best food? Its not for me to say but you will not, i guarantee you will not leave unsatisfied. The only complaint is that the drinks for a refill are a little much but whatever. You come in and its got a map painted on the wall of where theyve been and its incredible. The people behind the counter obviously enjoy their jobs a little too much but hey it pays the bills and the menu... Oh my god the menu is huge. Its got cheesesteaks, sandwiches, submarine sandwiches, wings, chicken fingers, pizza, calzones, pasta, desserts and more. I come in for just cheat day fries and wings and its not like theyre frozen or even like premade and reheated. Its actually made fresh, crazy flavor, its beautiful and its a restaurant i eat at very regularly. If youre visiting Vegas, youre a local looking for something new or even youre just passing through and found this review on places to eat, looking for something good. This is a good stop and its worth it. Do you think id waste my tine and post this? You think id waste all this time to actually make a review this long if i didnt really want to spread the word of this place? Jesus no. This is my home away from home and these people are my family.

The girl asked for ID, which was no problem since signs are clearly posted about this. My particular debit card does not have a name printed on it. Because of this fact, I was informed that she would have to write down ALL of my info from my license...and then she asked ""is that ok?"" Well NO, it isn't OK, but what was I to do at that point? I said I understood wanting to write my name down since that is the same info that you would have gotten had my name been printed on the card.  She responded with a VERY RUDE ""Well you don't HAVE TO use it."" as her answer. Of course I did have to use it, since that was the form of payment I came prepared with.

Upon arrival, the guy behind the counter seemed pretty tied-up, even though the restaurant wasn't busy. But he got the job done and thats what's important.

* Cleanliness: 3/5
kitchen looked clean but some of the tables and seats were dirty while the restaurant was slow...

* Food and portion size: 3/5
Portion size was GREAT. But as for the food... let's just say, it was a step above Little Caesars. To explain, we ordered a large Hawaiian and asked for extra sauce (like always), and of course the cheese to sauce ratio did not match. In fact, they drenched the pizza in cheese. Now, don't get me wrong, the cheese was very good and FRESH but was half an inch thick. Pineapple and ham were very fresh and the crust was good.

Honestly, I feel this pizza would only taste good if you're drunk.

* Atmosphere, room capacity, and menu size: 2/5
Restaurant is conveniently located off the strip but towards the older section of Vegas. The place is SKETCHY (like anything else in old Vegas)... pitch black window and door tinting, beat up parking lot, and next to a gentlemen's club. As for the interior; it is very casual, ambiance is dark, seats are oddly colored (couldn't tell if they were dirty or actually that color) and the menu was rather large for a pizza place.

* Price :5/5
Price was GREAT. $16.00 for a large with 2 toppings.

* Recommend or return?
No, I will not recommend this place unless you LOVE cheese and/or drunk. Unfortunately, I will not be returning.",O8FFEbDNVR7Dyoab8CDkhA,0,0,3,vMlM1g8r3G6NC8GvXjkw5Q

We ordered a small pizza, a philly cheesesteak, some wings, and garlic bread to share with a group of 3 of us. I was shocked to see the philly cheesesteak it's usually made with provolone. And I was shocked when I bit into it. It looked and tasted like melted sliced processed cheese. It wasn't until after I noticed they charged extra if you want provolone. Other wise your getting sliced cheese. So you should really say steak sandwich with sliced cheese not a philly cheesesteak. Also I asked the lady at the front of their ranch house made. She told me it was when it clearly it wasn't. When I tasted it; it was very sour and disgusting. Which made more mad cause if she would have just been honest from the beginning I would have never ordered the wings. The garlic bread with cheese was just as disgusting as everything else. It didn't even have a garlic flavor to it just butter with more of this nasty white cheese. And the pizza I order a combo, we basically got a cheese pizza with the amount of toppings you would get out of a frozen pizza box. I was gonna ask for my money back because all I did was pick at the food and didn't really eat. But I decided it wasn't worth my time. All around this place is just nasty with cheap ingredients. You can definitely tell. I can see how it would be good if your extremely intoxicated. Otherwise do yourself a favor and stay away from this place. *Note* I probably should of realized it when I walked in and it smelled like a Chinese food restaurant. I would give 0 stars if I could.",7rSX7hwvjM2AXZ1FCuUB4Q,0,0,1,3pPF8B1-OgPPWekIcxepCw

- Late night eats
- Cheap eats on the Strip
- Pizza that tastes really good.

Unfortunately, the pizza is becoming more mediocre, the more I visit. I've had crust so hard, it was inedible, and nearly burnt. I feel that they put an insane amount of cheese on the personal pizzas, just for the sake of having a crazy amount of cheese. 

If you're getting a water and a cheese pizza, don't order the special, it's actually cheaper to buy just the personal pizza with no additional toppings and pay for your water cup. Yes, they charge you for a polystyrene cup for water. Water is the only beverage that you get a free refill on, otherwise, you have to pay upward of $.60-.85 for a refill. I don't drink soda, but I think that's ridiculous when the cost of a beverage from a fountain costs pennies.

Tho they do take their time with your food, don't be fooled, it's horrible and burnt and not what you expect, I promise. They are sloppy will not be patient with you when ordering and will walk around disregarding you while you wait at the register for 10 minutes, will not go over the menu with you and will give nothing but disrespectful attitude to you. Definitely wouldn't recommend to anyone, ever. Never have I ever received service as bad as I have here",k3lwRV7SfLEa3k4Tdp9hzg,0,0,1,Y3eTedNjK9xS0xNEEvuQTQ
5773169,2014-01-20,1,kUQwaqwxKlScAQNhRx2_2w,Used to come here back in 2009 and the food was great. Driving by today I decided to stop for a late lunch to kill some time with my beau ! I was extremely disappointed with my chicken Philly and wings along with zucchini chips..this was a horrible meal. Bland all the way around.. maybe they changed owners or something,nVZLzic8X9VhDbTsXlmgRQ,0,0,1,oH-pxWQdJKGbzZsadQI0Xg

5850233,2017-07-24,1,kUQwaqwxKlScAQNhRx2_2w,Awful    Came here as a last resort because we really wanted pizza and couldn't find anything else that was open.   The service here is beyond slow.  But let's get to it already then...  the food is just awful !   The pizza had a very weird taste to it and none of us could finish eating it.   I seriously think the cheese was bad or something because hours late ALL of us started cramping and fighting over the bathroom.

5850382,2015-11-30,0,kUQwaqwxKlScAQNhRx2_2w,Great food at a good value . Good customer service as well . The speed of service was on point and the food came out hot and fresh . I would recommend to friends and family . The location is good as well only minutes away from the main Las Vegas Strip .,Xt3414bzOGCdcdTi6lk8CQ,0,0,5,mJib4MF7A7KaI02KAcCZOQ
5862451,2015-05-06,0,kUQwaqwxKlScAQNhRx2_2w,"First time I went here? The food was terrific. Best cheesesteak sandwich since I left Philly. 2nd time I went? It was 2 for Tuesday. Where they run specials. BAD idea. They were so busy, they didn't pay attention to what they were doing. And because of that,  BOTH my cheesesteak sandwich and calazone were burned. Not toasted but burned. I didn't check my food until I got home. The last time? Today? I placed my order and waited and waited and waited. Then looked at my receipt? They didn't even get the order right. I wasn't going to bother reordering and waiting more. I just left and left the food there as well. Won't be going back. Service and quality of food just way too inconsistent. 2 bad experiences out of 3? Just isn't good.",X7dzSxWdHcJbvCJBHmnDpA,0,0,1,ddjkuo_3Qe9d-voOBxXVeQ

This is the most ridiculous place to order food from. They're completely lost and not organized at all. Too bad they're so disorganized and don't even care. Please save your money, especially tip since they're so incompetent.",kGOi18CpE0CnavSAQmSg_g,0,0,1,4pi0UtZmuRDGiGaj4y1WyQ

5953052,2016-11-23,0,kUQwaqwxKlScAQNhRx2_2w,"Came here on the recommendation of someone I know, and must say wasn't let down. Not quite sure if I would rate it as the best but she certainly seemed to think so. It was very good, don't get me wrong.

Ordered a sausage and double pepperoni pizza, though not quite sure if they actually put double on there. It had enough sausage and good amount of pepperoni, just doesn't seem like double, though I have no experience at this place.

The flavor was good, crust had a different taste to it, not bad or great, just different than what I'm used to. The cheese was delicious and pizza came out hot. Sauce was a little skimpy but had some taste.

Will recommend this place to others. Good food.",_IcrRgXW1gtVNruseNHAJQ,0,0,5,ZDVFuWkE7zVVqlyGolhPPA
