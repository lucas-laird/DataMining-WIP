Tropical Smoothie is like any other fresh fruit mixer except that they actually serve food.  I didn't have any of it as my stomach probably could not handle anything except a smoothie since Vegas nights pretty much destroy any appetite you have.  If you don't know what I'm talking about, then you don't know how to party.

The smoothies are good, they're large and you won't feel ripped off.  Except when you're a cheap bastard like me and you wish you had come to happy hour instead of paying full price.",uT2U2l6YScm4bMUIsO9PjA,0,0,3,xiaYcWUiRuWKP-9Kp93OZQ

Keeping the store clean is good and I do like when they are appropriately staffed for a particularly busy time of day. Two locations around town even have employees who know my name and what I like.

So, why does this location always feel rushed and unfriendly?

Here was my Quick Tip on my last stop in:
""Time to redeem a filled up card for a free Smoothies... Well, not ""free""... She says ""that'll be 11 cents... For the Splenda.""

To be clear, I showed her the punched card, she went to punch it again. When I showed her that it was completed, she implied that I was trying to trick her. She then said ""that will be 11 cents."" I just looked at her inquisitively. She said ""For the Splenda, that'll be 11 cents""

I ran out to the car to get 11 pennies.
What if I had been jogging?? 
What if I had 0 Dollars and 0 Cents and was hoping that a Tropical Smoothie, earned through my sustained, frequent visits, would cheer my broke ass up... NOPE.",rdysF0ymVkMX82Bu_8x3nA,6,0,2,ii2Cxhdr3GqcA529BUwsqg

4300212,2010-08-31,0,PVVb9lGS00W2GoCfBb9o4g,"This is my favorite Tropical Smoothie. It is not the one closest to my house, or the one I visit the most, but it is the one I spend the most time at. This location is near the Sears Auto Center where I take my car to get most of the basic maintenance done. While I am waiting I go to Tropical Smoothie. Why? Two reasons, one, I don't really feel the need to wander Sears while my car gets fixed. I am the kind of person that goes to Sears knowing what he wants, not going to look. Second, its a nice place to get a healthy snack (or smoothie) while I wait for my car to be fixed, and I can enjoy the free wi-fi provided by the bagel shop next door.  I like the bagel shop next door, but I really do prefer TS. 
I like this TS because the service is quick. I've found the food and smoothie quality here consistent with other locations, but by far this is the most well staffed and quick TS I've visited. 
I also appreciate that they never give me flack for asking for a wrap that is not the veggie wrap minus the meat. They are always accommodating. 
Additionally, this location of TS has a 24hr drive thru. I've never needed to get a smoothie at 3am, but if I do, I will be coming here.",qF1V8GyuLL5Fpv40Cyturw,1,0,4,XQEt4_ffJqZa8NiZCOe4ig

This is my go-to smoothie place. I've been here more than a handful of times during many different times of the day, and never have a had a problem with the speed and service from the staff. I never had to wait more than 10 minutes for my order. The staff is accommodating to what I want and quick to fix any mistakes. Get their stamp card to get a free smoothie after you've purchased 10! Also sign up for their text message deals,you often get BOGO texts. I'm a big fan of the Kiwi Quencher, Bahama Mama, and the new Citrus Green Tea with basil.

Overall, I think the quality of the smoothies is better than Jamba Juice, who I think puts waaay too much sugar (e.g. yogurts, sorbets) in their juices.  Tropical Smoothie on the other hand has more choices of smoothie drinks without the extra sugar, hence lesser calories.  Their sandwiches and salads are a great option too!",4wjSbGPlnVpzj9Z3ppuJfA,1,1,4,mpVwoJI45pekQx_rYpjVtQ

We wait 30 mins for two smoothies and a sandwich. They forgot my friend's order FOUR TIMES. They completed everyone's order before hers, and sporadically came back a few times to continue asking what she ordered. We were baffled. We noticed she kept coming back to the register to write down orders on a napkin! Isn't there a ticketing system for this?! 

Two other women we were waiting with had placed orders over the phone and had to wait almost as long as we did! What is even the point of offering this service?!

We barely had time to eat before we had to get back to work. 

Dear god, Tropical Smoothie, please for the love of God...HIRE MORE PEOPLE TO WORK THE LUNCH RUSH.

I really wanted to try their Island Green smoothie made with spinach and kale.. But they didn't have the ingredients to make it.. Why advertise something with big posters when you aren't ready to make it? Settled for my usual Sunrise Sunset and a Buffalo Chicken wrap.. I wanted a banana as my side but they were out of bananas..... WTF. So then I decided on baked chips which they were also out of. 

This whole time there was only 1 girl working. C'mon Tropical Smoothie how are you going to have 1 person working the cash register, making smoothies and making wraps!!!!???! So kudos to her because there were like 4 other people besides us.
