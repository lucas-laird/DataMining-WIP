I went there with my family a couple weeks ago, and yeah it's pretty good. I really don't see what all the hype is about though. It's a good pizza, but far from the best in Vegas. The sauce was a bit too sweet, but the pie was solid otherwise.

The atmosphere in the restaurant is very nice. I especially like the black and white photos of New York on the walls, which match the décor perfectly and really add to the authenticity of the place.

Like I said, it's a good pizza. I'll come back to Grimaldi's, I'm sure, but I won't hype it up to my friends for fear of them leaving disappointed.",UYACF30806j2mfbB5vdmJA,0,0,4,7MTQYugLbY01UO4Kq8NpPw

Ordered a house salad with add on Genoa Salami, they forgot the salami, asked for Chicago cut (squares) I received pie slices. We ordered 2 cocktails - it took over 15 minutes for each drink.

I never thought I would like brick oven pizza are usually like the softer type of pizza crust. however after trying Grimaldi's one time after a friend recommended it I actually loved it it wasn't too soft but it wasn't too hard either and the flavor was amazing. The prices average not little like a Domino's or Pizza Hut would be but also not as expensive as the higher-end pizza restaurants.

I have to say I don't know what happened since our last visit months ago when we loved going to Grimaldi's.   Our previous experience was that the service was excellent and so was the food.  Things are definitely not the same.  We walked in and sat down at an empty bar.  The bartender was standing right in front of us wiping glasses.  She didn't greet us or look up.  When she did great us it was hardly a warm welcome.  The hostesses also seemed disorganized and confused.  When we arrived at our table our server was welcoming but also disorganized and confused.

I routinely order take out here but about 1/3 of the time I end up having to send a pizza back because of the extreme burnt edges on the crust.  I figured it was about time to give my review.  The other 2/3 of the time I eat here the pizzas as great.  But I have to knock them down a couple stars due to lack of consistency.  C'mon guys.

206949,2011-09-26,0,RRw9I8pHt5PzgYGT2QeODw,"I will admit that I am a tough critic on pizza restaurants. I have been making pizza at home for 30 years so I know what type of crust and toppings that I prefer.

 Things looked good when we entered the restaurant and I noticed slightly blackened crusts on the pizzas as I enjoy a crisp crust with light toppings. Normally I order a pizza Margarita (tomato and basil) as it gives me a good idea of the quality of the ingredients and the crust structure and flavor. In this case, I also ordered some of the red peppers as an additional topping. The pizza that was delivered to the table was quite a disappointment. Smothered in sliced tomatoes, the moisture of the tomatoes and the peppers made a very soggy crust I expect a thin crust to be slightly crisp not wet and and soft. I don't mind paying $24 for a pizza (basic pizza $16+$4 for peppers+$2 for tomatoes+$2 for basil) but it really needs to be exceptional. This one was not. By the way, I have never before been charged extra for basil on my pizza!

The Mediterranean salad was OK (large, $10) and service was prompt although my half empty water glass was never re-filled.

Maybe this is a good place to sit on the outside patio for a drink or two but I think that  their main and only dish, pizza, is really not up to par especially for the price. I would prefer Sammy's or Metro any day.",heEhkOC6R1kayjC5Z9Pr-A,0,0,2,veC1-21toHTpAaiLAgg8Wg

They spread the cheese different than other pizza places in that it's put on in drops, so there's drops of cheese and drops of sauce. It's no wonder they have 13 locations in Vegas, Arizona and Texas. They do pizza right. The sauce is delicious. Real pizza sauce, not spicy and no tomato chunks. They have an outside eating area that's very comfortable, but the pizza gets cold out there.

Don't get me wrong, the pizza is good- it's just not fantastic enough for the price or stuffy atmosphere.  How can you charge $16 for a cheese pizza and then another $4 for some artichokes?  Heaven forbid you want to build yourself a multi-topping pizza.  You'll end up paying $30 when it's all said and done.

It's a thin crust, which I like, but thin enough that my husband and I could split the entire pie and leave not feeling like we just pigged out.  The cheese and sauce are good, but I can't speak for the toppings since we were playing it cheap that night and didn't order any.

I'd rather have some more authentic NY-style pizza and head over the Cosmopolitan's Secret Pizza joint.  Plus I can enjoy better music and scenery while I'm there.

I'm a pizza snob from the east coast, and am not easily impressed.  I wouldn't change a thing about the pizza.  My only complaint might be that the people that work at the bar, never seem to notice me waiting to pick up my order, as they continue to talk and mess around with each other.  I have never eaten there, so the servers might be better.  But, at the bar they make it seem like I'm bothering them to do their job.  Other than that small gripe, I love the pizza!

Initially we drove from the strip out to S. Rampart to get away from the congestion.  To our dismay, they said they had to clean the ovens (before the dinner rush hour) and we walked out totally disappointed.  Not 30 seconds later, waiter Moe, comes running out and says they can hold off with cleaning after our pizza.  Nowhere else would I have ever experienced someone who really understood and cared enough to do that.  Anyone else would have shrugged their shoulders and said ""oh well"". 

We ordered the roma tomato, fresh mozarella, and basil pizza.  Any other Margherita type pizzas are scarce with all their ingredients, but not this one.  I couldn't believe how it was made with the eater in mind.  A bite of everything in every bite.  No skimping on their end.  We also ordered the caprese salad for an appetizer and it was outstanding, in flavor, presentation and portion size.  The moz they import from NY is so fresh and tender.  

We will definitely be back on our next visit to LV. 

Now we go back to VA where I have to drive 45 minutes for our second favorite pizza, wood-fired grilled. 

Thanks Grimaldi's on S Rampart and thanks Yelp reviewers of all the Grimaldi locations for leading us to a great find!

The first time I a taste of heavenly pizza was down at the Eastern location and when this one opened in Summerlin I was ecstatic!  As you can see I am a regular at Grimaldi's and these are just a few must haves when you are there!

1. The pesto pizza is to die for, alongside the white.  I usually get a half and half just so i can get the best of both worlds.
2. My Favorite toppings are: Sausage, ricotta cheese, pepperonis, onions, extra garlic, roasted peppers, and maybe some basil.  (these are just a few of my favs that i think are their specialties that is a must, however, all other toppings are very good as well)
3. Their Greek or Mediterranean salads are amazing!  light and refreshing, not over the top heavy creamy dressing which is very nice right before a hearty meal.
4. they have half off bottle wines some nights or some times so it's always smart to ask the waitresses what their specials are in case you are looking for a good time!

Friendly tip:  if you can't decide on the size of pizza, always go with large because you can never go wrong with leftover grimaldi's for a midnight snack or next day breakfast.
if more than 2 people, get two large with different toppings and get creative!  i don't think you can go wrong either way!

don't get scared away by the wait, there's a total wines and shops in this plaza so even if the wait is 30 mins, you can easily kill time in the plaza without going too far.",zeOG1kyPgYmu7YSvIcyTCA,0,0,4,5QZbWQfvDVERzw9Son_Dog

Ordered a large pie with garlic and mushrooms.  As another reviewer pointed out, the first slice was the best; Grimaldi's really needs to invest in some kind of serving plate that does a better job (or any job) of keeping the pie warm.  Pizza was just what you want from a thin-crust style, however incredibly, and I mean INCREDIBLY under-seasoned.  Even with the visible garlic on it, we still needed to douse ours with extra garlic powder, cheese, oregano, red pepper flakes and whatever other seasoning we could find.  Only then was the seasoning adequate.  

My wife and I did finish the whole pie, but the last slices were sadly cold, and my wife pointed out as well that there were bare patches on the pie where there was nothing: no cheese, sauce or toppings.  That is a cardinal sin in our opinion.  

Had cannoli for dessert, they were quite good.",I2LqdDguUbkh22hc06dgWQ,0,0,3,waYUIXzEIOPka6pVvyaT_w

But for once he said this pizza was comparable to a NY pizza, he loved that you could taste the freshness in the sauce and the cheese was also great. 

I completely agree with his assessment but feel that the sauce although very fresh was lacking in spice/flavor. In addition, there was very little of it on the pizza to the point I had to request additional. 

But that was my only disappointment and wouldn't make it a deal breaker as it was very tasty, ya just gotta make sure to order extra sauce.

I was waiting for the right time, one of those days where you're bored at home, want to do something but don't want to go out. A stop into here to place a to-go order, a small white garlic sauce pizza with Italian sausage and roasted red peppers came to a price tag of 23.xx 

When I got back four people had at it, and everyone enjoyed the pizza.  Little pricey, the staff I interacted with were nice and helpful explaining that everything on the menu is chose your own toppings, they dont have pre-set, pre-defined 'specials'.

It was not my choice to go to Grimaldi's because after going to their Fashion Show location, I found their pizza to not be memorable. I never went back until this day when my coworkers wanted to go. I feel the same way, the pizza is ok and I have had better in Vegas. 

The pizza is good. It is not bad, but not great. For a chain, I think the taste is just okay but better than Domino's, Pizza Hut, etc. The waitress forget my iced tea I ordered then charged me for it. When I brought it to her attention she said she would take it off the receipt, but no apology for forgetting. 

What I don't like is their prices and their add toppings per topping and pay per topping. I got a personal white pizza (enough for 1 meal if you are really hungry or 2 meals if you are not that hungry). It has 6 small/medium sized slices. The base price is $10 for a personal sized white pizza. Add artichoke hearts $4, add mushrooms $2, add spinach $2, add mushrooms $2. My pizza is now $20 for a personal size pizza! Hmm did my pizza have truffles on it for that price? I did not even get my sun dried tomatoes or extra garlic because it would cost more $$! I think this is a rip off. You are better off getting large pizzas and splitting them if your party can agree to the pizza type. They really should come up with some pizzas that have the toppings already on there. If you think you are being customized by allowing toppings to be placed on for additional charges, it does not work when it becomes highly overpriced. Well this is a big company and I highly doubt they will ever change their method of pricing per topping, so in that case I highly doubt I would be back (not by my choice). 

We did get a free cheesecake for teacher appreciation week and I got strawberry. I was not impressed with the consistency of the cheesecake, it was soft (way too soft and yes there is such a thing). I like a firmer more dense cheesecake personally. The strawberries were kind of odd baked into the cheesecake, so they got weird mushy. 

I spent $32 for my personal size pizza, half a small salad I shared, water, and tip and tax. That seems like a lot for what I got.",Apj8bnqWlnaiSu4YDl0wDA,1,0,3,3YBVjthmSTV1dkeIqmOqwg
1704743,2012-06-09,4,RRw9I8pHt5PzgYGT2QeODw,"6/4/2012 Got table blocked right off the bat. Told hostess we needed a table for 3 outside headed out and noticed another group closely following then some confusion as they said they were waiting before us so host gave to them. Waited for party to leave so we could get next one. Waiter never came back to get their check lol they ended up annoyed and came in to pay. Fronts horribly managed.  Sat us at a 2 person table...? Not enough room. Had to ask to be moved.
Everything seemed to be fine... at first. They were literally falling all over themselves to help us with drinks etc. Had 3 different servers tell us about the pizzas there and ask us for drink order. Was kind of comical. Pizza came and was good... Our neighboring table that backed up to the wall seemed to be having some sort of issue and the man there jumped up abruptly and then the woman he was eating with did the same. Thought they were fighting... that was until I noticed some visitors on their table. Yes ON their table. That's when we also saw them. It seems Boca park has a rather severe roach problem. We immediately stopped eating when we saw they were scattering less than a foot away from our table and not one or two mind you... Dozens of them were crawling in the bushes and along the wall. I could have and at one point was leaning on that wall. Thankfully they didn't crawl onto our table, our neighbors were't as lucky as one dashed right in there while they were eating. 
Told the waitress as we abruptly moved away from the wall. She said they knew... and it was a problem they were having.  The manager came out who was extremely nice and admitted it was a problem and they had to spray several times a week and was going to start spraying everyday. gag! He gave us a discount. It actually read ""roaches"" under the reason for the discount. I wish I were kidding...
If it's that bad outside what does the kitchen look like?
Here's a tip... when you have a roach infestation don't sit diners right next to it. We took our pizza home but now we are wondering why we even paid for the meal. None of us want to eat it. lol Nasty as hell. Won't ever be back.
Part 2...
Looks like I'm getting some hate mail from .. employees? or overly ardent Grimaldi lovers? lol They must really love that pizza! Pathetic. Now you are just riling me. I was willing to let this go and never go back... but not now. This is a review site! We had a bad experience. I'm going to write about it!
There are roaches there ... outside yes, but the problem is extreme. I grew up here. I know there are roaches outside. This is pretty damn bad or else it wouldn't have been mentioned. No ""Gecko's on a patio"" but then again, that might help them solve their roach problem. I'm not trying to ""ruin the reputation of a restaruarnt,"" (and yes they spelled it wrong, that's a direct quote.) I do have the receipt... would you like me to post it showing the reason, ""roaches"" on the there? It was so bad they have a discount called ""roaches"" in their system. lol It's time they do something about it. When a problem is that severe you don't sit people there! Period. And if its that bad outside I wonder what the kitchen looks like...
I'd be MORE than happy to learn that they've taken steps to correct this little black crawly issue and I would LOVE to post that its been fixed on here for all to see... yet no one has contacted me other than really angry pizza lovers. Crazy.
Maybe we can just solve this and have the health department come out and take a look. If they don't think its a problem then hey no worries!

1729644,2014-08-17,0,RRw9I8pHt5PzgYGT2QeODw,"Delicious pizza and great service too! My girl and I went here to sit down and have a pizza. It was our first time here. This place looks nice inside, brick walls and has a very tall ceiling. We ordered the Caesar Salad and a large pizza with sausage, pepperoni and red peppers. 

Tip: The ""small"" salad size is big enough for two people to have one serving of salad. We got the ""large"" size salad and it was enough for 4 people. The way the pizza works is they have a set price for the sizes (small, medium, large) and then each of your toppings cost extra. But the toppings can get pretty expensive. So essentially for a large I think it was $16. And that is just the crust and sauce. We then added sausage, pepperoni and red peppers and I think our pizza alone came out to $24. So you can see that if you start adding lots of toppings the pizza will get quite expensive. 

The pizza was delicious. Pepperoni was so good and so was the sausage. Had a nice little spice to it. My only complaint (and this isn't the restaurant's fault) is that I like the crust to be a tad bit thicker so I can hold the pizza slice by the crust and have the slice stick straight out. This crust is very thin so if you hold it by the crust the entire slice bends down to the ground.

It sounded like it would be amazing!  I received a birthday coupon for a free 18 inch with one topping so thought this would be a great time to try it out.  
First I will say that the service was phenomenal (hence the second star)!  Our server was prompt and courteous, although I did feel a little rushed by her.  The staff appeared genuine and were very helpful being it was our first time there.
The food.  Hmm.  We ordered a house salad to share, as we were told it was a good portion for two.  It was actually a portion for at least three.  There were only two olives in the salad, the lettuce was cut in very small pieces.  We added on chicken and mozzarella.  The portions added into the salad were so small that we wondered why we had to pay extra for them!  
The pizza.  Wow!  The crust was much thinner than I had expected.  I actually liked the texture of the dough but it had a funny taste to it.  I could not pin point it.  On the way home I realized it almost tasted like a poison.  Something I had never experienced.  I also realized there was no oregano on the pizza.  Something I am used to with two of their competitors in town: Anthony and Mario's Broadway Pizza on Charleston and Metro Pizza.  
Cheeeeeese!  Why was there no cheese on our pizza?  Okay there was SOME....but ....not in every bite!  Where there was no cheese there was the topping.  
I really am disappointed.  I was expecting a much better experience.  I was excited about trying it and feel really let down.  This is one place that had a once in a lifetime chance with me.  How do you screw up pizza?  Well, they succeeded.  I will remain loyal to Anthony and Mario's Broadway Pizzeria and to Metro Pizza in this town.  If I'm going to eat all these calories, I want it to be worth it!

I noticed several of the wines at Grimaldi's that I had purchased before, all of them highly rated.

So far, I've only had the red sauce but I like that they have a pesto available. The large pizza is enormous and their suggestion that it feeds 3-4 people is accurate. Something about the crust and sauce just didn't do it for me- it's good but not great, something was missing and we added a lot of the garlic.

- salty, tasty fresh mozzarella
- soft tasting, smooth tomato sauce (not remarkable, but tasty enough)
- wonderful list of ingredients (including roasted garlic)

A couple ladies greeted me when I entered and directed me to the to-go area which is at the end of the bar. I decided to try a small pizza which is 16in, and added pepperoni, tomatoes, mushrooms and garlic. The small pizza is $14 which is just crust and cheese, and any additional toppings are $2-4 depending on what you get . My total for the pizza was $25! A bit on the pricey side. The cashier told me it would be about 20 minutes so I sat at the bar and grabbed a beer. I was disappointed they didn't have any beer specials, but I ordered a small blue moon for $5. 

So 20 minutes goes by and the pizza comes out and it looks pretty good. I get home and dig in and it is just okay.

I did enjoy the pizza. Crust was great, thin and crispy just the way I like it. Was it worth the price though? I wouldn't say so. We added the sausage($2), mushrooms($2), & roasted red peppers($4) to the pizza. Pretty expensive for toppings in my opinion... especially the red peppers. I was surprised they cost more than the sausage. 

Now, I'm not sure if it was because we were siting outside, where it was a bit chilly - or if it was the pizza - but after about 4 or 5 minutes, the pizza was cold. And, I'm not a big fan of cold pizza.

Service wise, it was decent service. Our server was friendly, but maybe a little too friendly. She took it upon herself to look at my friends iPhone, where she saw she had received a text message, and then proceeded to 'pretend' to unlock it.

holy crap, THE BEST THE BEST THE BEST
This coming from someone who likes(... liked?) deep dish, grim serves east coast which is thin but the great thing about that is you can eat more!
3 of us polished a large, down to the last piece of chicken on the pan. The pies are cooked pretty hot so the crust is crunchy and delicious. 
Its kinda expensive for the toppings though, i think the large was 15, but then you add each topping for about 2-6 dollars i think, the chicken was 5 i remember. We also got meatball. Fantastic. 

Reminded me a lot of Chicago Brewing BUT SO MUCH BETTER. Its rather small on the inside but still looks classy, of course its boca park. Classic red and white checker tablecloths and a bar up front, BUT NO TVs which i actually liked here. Walls decorated with normal new york / italian gear. Didnt see anything yankee which was funny, its like they dont want to be a sports bar (for which i would go to gordon anyway) but they are big on wines, and in a very italian restaurant fashion wine glasses are waiting on the tables for you

Will have to try dessert next time we didnt even look. We did get a caprese salad to start which was very elegant, but to me it was a waste of 7 bucks for cheese and tomato. 

All i could say while eating was ""this is freaking good!""

Uploading a picture of their lighting, its emptied out wine bottles hanging from the ceiling, almost didnt notice these gems!

5 STARS for food and not being snooty, but it is clean and new so dress up a lil, makes you feel better anyway




EDIT!! idk how i could have forgotten to mention this. I came in alone and asked for a table for 3, the 2 hostesses kinda looked at me and i explained that an old man and little girl would be joining me. One asked if she needed to bring a booster seat.

So, after much anticipation, my hubby and I bit the bullet and went for a piece of pie.

Meh. Really. The pizza was not as flavourful as what we expected. We had the marinara (tinned, pureed tomatoes) sauce with sausage, basil and onions. The lack of spice of the sauce and the sausage was  a total downer. The small amount of basil they did put on the pizza did nothing to detract from the overall blandness of the poor pie. Which was rather sad because the crust is one of the best we've tried.

We did go back to try Grimaldi's a second time - this time opting for a ""white"" sauce with meatball and onions. Still, the food was rather bland. Our server this time did bring us some dried oregano and garlic powder which we doused the poor slices with to give it some flavour.

Really, for the food alone, it does probably deserve maybe a three star rating. However the cost of the pizza detracted me from doing so.",h9RUaaHa5kcQKqtJ-sgS0Q,0,0,2,yE0AxQZqw9wrONn31X11CA

Adriana and I were staying at the Wynn to celebrate our anniversary, and we opted for Grimaldi's on our first night there, just because we had such a good experience when we were in town last year, and we were exhausted from the 45 minute flight from Burbank. 

A Lego Store just opened next door, so K'ayum was already in heaven. We scored the last outside table. (OK, not outside, 'cause you're in a mall, but outside the restaurant. Got it?)  Perfect for people-watching.

I ordered a carafe of chianti, and the friendly waitress even scared up an ice bucket to chill it a bit. We started with a small spinach salad  (I, Christopher C., ALWAYS start with a salad) and it was excellent and enough for the three of us to share. 

For a pizza, we opted for pepperoni, spicy chicken sausage, onions, and peppers. The pizza was incredible -  the sausage was nice and spicy and the crust was perfect. It was a great meal, and my son scored a great Lego set! (Note to self: go to Lego store BEFORE consuming a carafe of wine...)

Still overall a very tasty pizza. Very thin and crisp crust, generous with the toppings, and the sauce while thin was very flavorful and a little sweet.

Even though the large is a thin crust, we still had two pieces leftover to take home. It also reheats really well.

Don't get me wrong, the pizza wasn't bad, but it wasn't great. It was just OK. The crust was thin and crispy, just how I like it, and my plate wasn't covered in orange grease when I was done., which is another positive. 

But the pizza, which started out as great, became increasingly boring piece after piece. I don't know how this is possible, but both the sauce and the crust lost some, or rather most of their punch after it cooled down a bit. 

We ordered a  1/2 carafe of their house red and it was lovely, and the service we experienced was exceptional. No complaints there.

2318012,2010-04-04,2,RRw9I8pHt5PzgYGT2QeODw,"After 5 hours of walking and shopping at the LV Premium Outlets, we worked up a big appetite. On the drive home it was decided that tacos and guacamole from Chipotle could be a quick & easy dinner, but as we passed by the newly opened (1 month ago?) Grimaldi's in Boca Park, we made a last-minute decision to give their pizza a spin.

We order a small house salad ($5) and it is large enough to feed 3-4 people, so the two of us have plenty of green to eat. The house vinaigrette is not very vinegary, but the tomatoes and mushrooms are fresh and the whole green olives are good quality. We order a large, traditional Grimaldi's pizza with onions, garlic and jalapeños ($15 + $2 per topping = $21). As we wait for our pizza, a quick survey of the pizzas on other customers' tables make me a little nervous that the coal-brick-oven at Grimaldi's is over-baking their crust. Every pizza I see in the restaurant has dark-brown/black burnt crust edges. (Thinking that it will take a really resilient dough recipe to withstand that level of scorching, I will be very impressed if their crust is actually chewy/crispy!)

Our pizza shows up. The cheese looks great - it has that stark white color of good Buffalo mozzarella. Bonus fresh basil in the middle of the pizza! No visible grease puddles on or under pizza! Overall the topping quantity isn't terribly generous, but compared to Settebello's 'authentic' (i.e. totally skimpy) pizza topping distribution, I find no reason to complain. With the first bite of any thin crust pizza, I pray to the pizza gods that the crust will be perfectly 50% crispy and 50% chewy. Unfortunately, Grimaldi's crust is 80% crispy and 20% chewy, and by the time the pizza is half eaten (4 slices left) it stales and becomes 100% crispy, much like the crust texture of a Tombstone frozen pizza. How did this happen?!

The edge of the crust is unacceptably crunchy and flavorless (and burnt!) and the second half of the pizza left me wondering what went wrong with this pizza - how does a pizza crust take a total turn for the worse after only 10 minutes into a meal? We could have easily left 2 pieces for a togo box for next-day's lunch, but found ourselves in a better-eat-it-now-because-it-will-get-stale situation as the crust was already surprisingly stiff. I actually heard the crust *snap* all way down the middle when folding the last slice! 

My favorite pizza experiences in North America have included a few special pies at Lou Malnati's (Chicago), Pizzeria Bianco (Phoenix), John's Pizzeria (NYC), Frank Pepe's (New Haven) and Pizzeria Rustica (Miami). In Vegas I have had good luck at Metro Pizza and at Rocco's NY Pizzeria, and the pear/gorgonzola/arugula/proscuitto pizza at the Sammy's location on Sahara is a consistently tasty choice. With respect to Grimaldi's, I could say ""maybe we got a bad pie"" but judging from the dozen other over-baked pizzas I saw on customers' tables, I think a baking-time or yeast adjustment could really help - the flavor is all there - the crust just needs a little chewy tweaking! Service is friendly and very attentive. Apparently, the cheesecake at Grimaldi's is homemade and as good as NYC Stage Deli's...",W1AFbtC37Q1RzdrKS51NmQ,2,2,3,1ObA7XjZHWGBAZnn4sL-7w

I stopped in for lunch with a friend on a Monday afternoon and waited a few minutes for a host or hostess. The young man who sat me was extremely nice and chatted while he brought me a wine glass. 
When my friend got here she said she had been here a few times before and really liked the pizza. My server also the bartender named Daniel was very nice and explained the menu to me. We ordered 2 salads and a small pizza. A server brought out my salad first and when I asked where the other salad was she said its coming, I said I would wait and she asked if she should take it back till the other  salad was ready. I said No and waited for the other salad not very long but could not figure out why she did not bring both out. I had the Caesar and did not enjoy it. First it came in a bowl that reminded me of a cereal bowl and not very flavorful.. I even asked for more dressing and still seem blah. 
The pizza which I had heard is awesome was not. First you order the size and crust style then the toppings which cost 2 to 3 dollars apiece. The crust which was thin which I like was chewy.

I took my Mom here for a late lunch. We were greeted by Elliot when we walked in and asked us if we prefer the booth or high stool chairs. Booth pleeease! And I'm glad we did. I never knew how nice it is in the back of the restaurant. I always came in for dinner and sat in the front area or patio seating. Summer time is great with those booths in the back. Melissa introduced herself and asked if we would like to order any drinks. For two of us, she recommended the large Pellegrino, which was way too much for us. At the end of our meal, I burped and it stung my nose so bad, I had a tear fall down my cheek. Order the small bottle instead. Your nose will thank me later! 

We ordered a small Grimaldi's House Salad, which looked more like a large portion! It felt like I drank a tall glass of fresh kool-aid. So refreshing! We ordered their large pizza with green peppers, artichoke hearts, and Italian sausage. My mom creation.. don't ask. Elliot came by with our pizza and asked us.. who would like the first slice. Then asked if we would like any Oregano, Parmesan Cheese, Garlic Powder, or Chili Peppers. We added all those to our slice of pizza and the first bite had so much flavor. I did notice that once the piping hot pizza cooled off.. the pizza, itself became stale. The chewy crust was hard as old french bread. Eat it while it's hot and you're good. Once it cools off, good luck! 

Now to the dessert. I love their Tiramisu here. I absolutely have to order this every time I dine here. It's made in-house and so is their Cheesecake. The mascarpone custard is creamy, light, and soft. The coffee and rum were so balanced that nothing overpowered one another. If you're in the mood for sweets, this is definitely a place for great Tiramisu!!! 

At the end, Melissa, Elliott, and even the happy go manager lady thanked us for dining here and wished us to have a great day. A nice start to the first day of the week. Happy Monday ;)",HVJgTH5qu0goywOHNpOjPA,7,5,5,TQzYhsVvhBwESFSTy3GB8Q

It had the average 20 minute wait for a Saturday night, tables were packed, yet service was on top of things. We ordered a pepperoni mushroom pizza and the manager brings it out to us. He says ""how does this pizza look?"" We're sitting there kind of confused because it was on the extra crispy side and had a bunch of holes in it. He followed up by saying ""it doesn't look good and it's not up to our standards. We're giving this one to you for free and we're making another one for you right now. I just wanted to bring this out because I didn't want you to be hungry."" GIVE THIS MAN A RAISE! That was the best thing I've ever heard!

This is one of the better pizzas I've had in Vegas so far and I'm looking to try another one of their specialty pizzas. The prices on the BYO pizzas could get pretty expensive with $2 to $4 each add on ingredient. Ouch!

Their small is like most mediums (16"") and the large is, well, large!  They advertise coal brick oven pizza and that's exactly what you get: delicious, thin crust pizza with very fresh toppings.  There are a several pizzas (combinations of toppings) on the menu you can chose from, but you can also create your own from a reasonable list of toppings and sauce types.

The staff is fantastic every time I've gone.  You're greeted warmly at the door, seated and quickly have the attention of one of the waitstaff.  I've also ordered pizza to go and don't mind the wait while it cooks.  You're invited to sit at the bar, located close to the front of the restaurant, where the bartenders have also always been awesome.  There are TVs over the bar, and I've always been offered a courtesy soft drink while I wait.  They bring the pizza to you, check to see that it's what you want, pay the bill and  you're on your way.

My only word of advise for those who take out:  because the pizza is thin crust, it cools very fast.  I only live a few miles from the restaurant but my pizzas usually need a little love in the oven by the time I get home.  That said, it's never hurt the flavor and I definitely wouldn't avoid Grimaldi's for take-out because of this.  Fantastic restaurant with fantastic food.

The only thing this place had in common with the original Grimaldi's is the name. Sad. I don't remember much, but there was nothing special about it. I have I guess two categories for pizza. There's NY pizza and everything else. So I can eat a pizza and say this is one of the best I've had, or one of the best I've had outside of NY. My standard in pizza comes from places like Grimaldi's, Patsy's in Harlem, L&B Spumoni Gardens, DiFaras, etc... This place was nothing more than a chain pizzeria licensing the name.

LOL NO Lettuce, nothing else. I guess I assumed the antipasto be like a chopped salad that included lettuce but it was my wrong doing for not asking first. It wasn't the best I've ever had either. The margherita pizza was a little soggy and grossed me out but I still ate it because I was starving. The white pizza was delicious. I highly recommend that.

My order is typically a large white pizza with garlic (already comes with pizza), pepperoni, mushrooms and sausage. Then we get oregano, garlic powder, and Parmesan cheese on the side... and then a side of Caesar salad dressing - great for crust dipping, but I end up throwing some on my pizza as well. I'll go back and forth between the Caprese and the Caesar salad, but I think the Caprese has really good mozzarella and the tomatoes they use are really hearty. I started to get embarrassed here when the hostess kept on remembering us and always said ""welcome back"", but it's really more of a nod to their great customer service here. As of late, we've just been heading straight to the bar to be served by Erin, who is one of the friendliest and thoughtful servers/bartenders you can ask for. She even remembers our order now too, right down to the drinks, but always checks with us first just in case we want to spice things up. Reliable and delicious pizza definitely keep me coming back and hasn't left me disappointed, so I'm really afraid to venture off to the other Grimaldi's locations. We always end up bringing 4-6 slices home with us, but they are great for leftovers the next day. To reheat, we put the pizza on a non-stick pan over medium heat, cover with foil, heat for a couple of minutes or until cheese is soft, and then we once again have hot and crispy pizza ready to go. There's a special going on right now, buy a $50 gift card, get $10 gift card for yourself, buy $100, get $20. Of course, I opted for the $100 and bought it basically for myself.

I came here with a few friends and this was the first time any of us has every been to any of the Grimaldi's locations. The menu looked pretty small at first, but it just has everything you could possibly need/want here. We went with a large house salad: Romaine lettuce, red onions, cherry tomatoes, oven roasted sweet red peppers, mushrooms, olives, and Vinaigrette dressing ($8), a large white w/ garlic pizza with meatballs and mushrooms ($22), and two Cannolis ($4.50 ea.). 

The salad came out in a bowl that was just big enough to fit the portion of salad in it, so it looked like there wasn't much salad at first, but there was actually more than enough for all four of us. I guess I'm just so used to places putting salad in oversized bowls that I don't realize what the ""right"" amount looks like. We each had at least 2 servings each and there was still some leftover. The salad was very fresh and I really enjoyed the mushrooms and Vinaigrette dressing. It's not too often that I have salad with mushrooms in it. The pizza blew all of us away. The crust was very thin, but not dry or overcooked. There were also a lot of garlic bits on top, but it surprisingly didn't bother any of us. It also had a pretty good amount of mushrooms on top, which I loved.

Our waitress was always checking up on us and refilling our drinks throughout our time here and she would even give her recommendations, tell us a little bit about the different menu items, and even joke around a little. It really added to our experience here.

3014533,2010-07-03,3,RRw9I8pHt5PzgYGT2QeODw,"To eat here you must love coal brick-oven pizza, sliced mozarella, fresh sauce and thin crust. If you do, you'll like the pizza at Grimaldi's.  Although I lack experience with true NY style pizza, I must say that if this represents a small percentage of it, I'm down for some NY love.  

Grimaldi's is all about the oven, the crust, and the fresh ingredients.  When I saw the 3.5 star rating two weeks ago I realized that I had to eat the pizza to find out for myself.  Mind you, all of us have different tastes when it comes to pizza, each person wanting a certain stretch to the dough or sweetness to the sauce.  I personally love sweeter sauce, but at Grimaldi's it's more tangy.  I personally love shredded cheese but here it's sliced fresh mozzarella.  I needed to try something different, so I went for the personal with basil.

It took ten minutes to complete my pizza, not long at all.  When I received the box I sort of freaked out at the size.  I'm used to the pizza hut sizes, where personal means that small round personal pan pizza.  Their version of personal reminds me of a medium, or something very close to that.  The crust is super thin, slightly crispy especially on the edges, and the ingredients are layered nicely on top.  It was interesting to see the sauce exposed between the slices of cheese, and crispy basil on top.  I hopped into my car, turned on the a/c, and peeled a slice from the box.

Wow.  This pizza is yummy.  I'm not going to go so far as to say something fabulous, amazing, or even orgasmic, but I love this pizza.  At the point it's slightly soggy from the sauce, but still holds up while you eat it.  It's one of those pizzas I recommend folding the sides in a bit while holding it to eat it properly.  My husband hates crust and he ate the whole pizza--crust and all.  I love the tangy fresh tomato sauce, the mozzarella that stretches beautifully when bitten in to, and I go for basil in the oven rather than after because it gets sweeter and has that crispy texture to it.  Yum.

After the first time there I went back two days later for the same order.  Then two days after that.  Oh and then three days from that day, and then four days ago and the day before yesterday.  Yeah.  I like it that much. I always order the same thing--personal with basil--because I don't want to ruin the flavors of the other ingredients and the crust.  I love the taste of the dough on this pizza--slightly sweet, almost a hint of sourdough-ness, and you can taste the char a bit.  

Remember, we all have different tastes, and many aren't in to this type of pizza.  For me, it's the only pizza I'll eat till I find another great NY pizza joint in town.  The other downfall of this place are the prices.  Many wouldn't pay $9 for a personal size and then pay $2-$5 dollars per additional topping.  The small is $13, for example, so many get turned off by the price.  Still, it's a great pizza joint that I've yet to eat in at because I love the idea of getting a pizza in a box.  It's just this weird thing I have with pizza.

You should try Grimaldi's if you haven't yet.  It's not your typical pizza delivery crap, but something ten times better.  I like it, and I hope that your taste in pizza matches this place, too.",o68A_3bAJTge-ioGXHdxKA,2,2,4,T3f7CWF7yexjDw7X1cokaw

Let me start off by saying that I love pizza. If I could eat pizza everyday, I would! I'm normally not a huge fan of thin crust but we ordered a large pepperoni, ricotta and sausage pizza and it was great. My only issue was that there was too much ricotta, so every bite we took had a nice hunk of ricotta but I shouldn't be complaining... Fresh ingredients, super hot, had a nice crunch to it and it was huge! 

We also ordered the large House salad (I think) and a small plate of antipasta. We had about half of the pizza left to take home. Great quality for a really decent price. 

Our server was very nice and came back frequently to check on us. some people were dressed casually (like my friends and I in gym clothes) or dressed up. There was a couple next to use that seemed to be on their first date and another table with two ladies enjoying wine.

3092532,2012-01-12,1,RRw9I8pHt5PzgYGT2QeODw,"My wife and I were very excited when Grimaldi's Pizzeria opened their location in Boca Park. We have gone there several times since they opened and to say our experience has been a mixed bag is an understatement. Over time we have become dyed in the wool pizza snobs. We look for the best pizza where ever we travel and have learned a lot about what goes into a great pie. We especially like wood and coal fired oven pizzas so we knew Grimaldi's would be right up our alley.  I've had a few very good pies at Grimaldi's and I've had a couple of questionable experiences.

  On our first couple of trips to Grimaldi's we ordered pepperoni pizza and wine. The pies were well made with a nice char on the crust as one would expect from a coal fired pizza. The service was quick and very friendly. We were definitely satisfied with our visits early on. On a subsequent visit things got a little funny. We hadn't tried a margherita style pizza at Grimaldi's so we decided that that would be the order of the day. Now mind you the Vegas location doesn't have margherita as choice on their menu, but it's a pretty simple traditional pie. It's just sauce, mozzarella and basil. Pretty straight forward, right? So I thought. Upon asking for a margherita pizza I was given an explanation about east coast margherita vs. west coast margherita and how each is made. His whole east coast/ west coast thing made me forget we were discussing pizza and had me believing the conversation had turned to hip-hop music. East coast/ west coast? Really??!! It was obvious that instead of telling me he didn't know what a margherita pizza our server wanted to b.s. me. At this point he suggested that we try both pies. Against my better judgment I went along with him. Needless to say, both pies were wrong. The most interesting of the two pies was the east coast pie which did have basil on it: about $40 worth! Since that experience I have made a trip to Brooklyn and went to the original Grimaldi's where they knew exactly what a Margherita pizza is. Must be some sort of disconnect between the mothership and franchises.

  With all of that being said Grimaldi's does serve a good pie and is worth the trip. The serve is always good and the wine list has some nice choices as well. Just remember, if you want a margherita pizza write down the instructions on how it's made! East coast or west coast!!",q2b4pAo_6tP7jNFKI5Hztw,2,1,4,bnU4tfrK0oXoW1xJZVlvqw
3104048,2011-04-30,0,RRw9I8pHt5PzgYGT2QeODw,"I had pretty high expectations coming to this location, and they were mostly upheld, but I wanted better.
The pizza was pretty solid, but the service was lacking a little bit.
I showed up earlier than the rest of my party on Thursday for lunch so I sat at the bar and drank an ice cold glass of water after a morning round of golf. I heard a manager talking, saying he was ""giving this table of first-timers a comped order of canolis"" 
When we were seated we went outside, and it was beautiful out so that was great. The hostess offered ""iced tea, water, or maybe a Peroni"" She didn't ask us if it was our first time, offer to describe the menu and their prices or try to upsell anything like an appetizer or garlic bread or salads. We decided to split a large and the ladies in the group were gonna split a small pizza, and the small is still plenty to share. The girls also decided to split a small caesar salad. We ordered and everything went normal. The pizza took a little longer than I anticipated being a very thin crust and the very beginning of lunch hour, but came out nicely proportioned with plenty of meatballs and onions on one, and plenty of ricotta cheese and pepperonis on the other. The pepperoni was nice and spicy, and the meatballs are full of flavor and nice and large too.
When it came time to ask if everything was going well, clear the plates, get us our checks and get the hell out of there is where the service lacked. Our server disappeared for a good 10-12 minutes when we were done eating and it took a long time to get the check and clear the credit card back to us to sign.  One of the other things that bugs me about Grimaldis is that each topping is at least $2-4 and the personal cheese pizza starts at $10 and the large at $18. If you get a large with 2 toppings you're already looking at $24+ just for a pizza. Add two drinks and a salad and you're looking at $45 with a tip for a lunch.

Also, what kinda place doesn't serve ranch? We asked for a side of ranch to dip the crust in when the pizza came and she said they don't even serve it at this restaurant. With salad on the menu how do you not serve ranch? This is America right? We love our ranch dressing.

2) Tomato sauce
3) Pesto

Then you choose the toppings. The price for this ranged from 2-4 dollars.

My pizza: Half cheese/garlic and pesto with RICOTTA cheese, sausage and mushrooms. Now the ricotta was a a nice touch but I think they could have had a lighter hand loading it on. It was a bit too much.... but the pizza was still delicious. The edges were nice and crispy but the middle wasn't so much, I think it was because of the ricctta.

They do get busy on a friday or saturday night but usually dies down around 830-9pm. The ceaser salad is done in a fresh made ceaser dressing the house salad is very good along with the caprese salad or antipasto. We normally get sausage or ham. Im not from new york or chicago who claim they have the best pizza but compared to amore of chicago and the newyork pizzas they have around here grimaldis is far better. I believe they have new york roots either way great pizza spot good for family and friends.

We always had great management, bartenders (Keith), and waitresses.  Went last Wednesday evening.  Too bad the Health Inspectors were not there.  There was no soap in the family bathroom. I told an employee and our waitress.  I was told by one (not our waitress, she was awesome), just go to another bathroom. He was not going to even fix it.  It just needed a battery.  So, people are just walking in and out of the bathroom without washing hands.  Gross!!!!
    Told our amazing waitress.  She went to her manager.  Manager did not even come and talk to us.  Eventually rectified the situation and the manager did not even have the decency to let us know it was taken care of (she asked the waitress to tell us).  What ever happened to customer service.  
     Not done...The whole area where the pizzas are made (it is an open area) was taken apart.  All of the compartments were taken out and it was a disaster.  Not sure why.  This is at 7:30 or so in the evening.  Why???  We had our pizza.  Awful!!  It was not cooked completely and was such poor quality. No toppings.   I don't think I can ever go back.  Just can't  do it!!!

The first thing you'll notice is how neat it looks inside. Wine bottle chandeliers, and various accouterments adorning the walls. They have a rather odd business model. The base pizza includes dough and sauce. Yes that's right...cheese is a topping. Rather silly way to justify charging more money to your customers. I would have preferred to pay the same amount with the cheese built into the base price of the pizza-- at least I wouldn't have felt my intelligence was being insulted. Although I suppose it's possible that there might be some lactose intolerant customers who take advantage of this opportunity not to have cheese on their pizza...

Anyway you'll also find that the price starts to rack up rather quickly as you begin adding toppings to your creation, which you'll simply have to do at a place like this. We chose mushrooms, meatballs, and pepperoni. The quality of the ingredients is apparent. The meatballs were juicy and flavorful and definitely not frozen crap that came out of a factory. The tomatoes of the sauce are allegedly organic and I did find the sauce to be full flavored. The mushrooms are also a tasty, chewy delight. The cheese takes some getting used to. Ricotta as a pizza cheese is definitely an unusual choice but I did enjoy the meal over all. The lack of grease is a plus. I also really liked the way you can watch them put it all together. The pepperoni had a kick to it and seemed to be something you might find at a nice Italian deli rather than a Pizza hut.

The originality of this place, combined with the quality of ingredients, will certainly merit a return from me, but it falls short of a five star experience.",U4ERp63gvcIeOis8UdtxvA,0,0,4,YfBNRSaB0ZqYbxkAs3lIBA

I'm sad that I haven't eaten here sooner because the pizza we got was delicious. I don't really care what type of pizza it is or how ""authentic"" it may or may not be. The only thing I really care is how it tastes. And, the pie that we had was mighty good.

We started with a mediocre  small Mediterranean salad ($7). It was large enough for three or four.

The pizza we tried was a small white with garlic ($16) with two toppings (pepperoni and mushrooms, $2 each). The crust was excellent, with a decent amount of it charred, as can be expected from a brick oven place. Even with all the cheese and pepperoni that was on the pizza, the bottom of the crust held up well and wasn't soggy, providing a crisp and crackling texture with every bite.

The small pizza is more like a medium and is large enough for two to share. Their ""personal pizza"" is what others would consider a small.

The most annoying thing about this place is that toppings are the same price no matter what size of pizza you get. Obviously, you're going to get more pepperoni, for example, if you get a large pizza. But, if you get a personal pizza you get less but have to pay the same price. These pies aren't cheap, so when you start adding toppings the price can get ridiculous.

I'm not sure I'll be back to this location, just because finding parking at Boca Park is always a hassle. But I will stop by another Grimaldi's spot to get my pizza fix.",C2C0GPKvzWWnP57Os9eQ0w,5,2,4,VEpj1usgtDAjPAYv_tnN3g

Parking was bit of a chore but it usually is in this parking lot. The wait for our table was a short 5 minutes. The dining area inside is smaller then I expected so I can't even imagine trying to come here on a Friday or Saturday night and not experience a long wait. 

We started off with a small ""Antipasto"". It was $9. I really liked the fresh mozzarella and the whole thing in general. It can easily be shared between 2 people. For pizza we decided to go custom. It had ricotta, mozzarella cheese, sausage and meatballs. They only have thin pizza here since it is NY style. The crust was thin but crisp and held the toppings well. I did enjoy the meatball and sausage but I'm not much of a meat eater so, I did end up picking a lot of the toppings off (people in my party wanted the meat and I wanted cheese ahhhh compromise) and next time I would probably go for a personal pizza with just the cheeses. The pizza is cooked using a coal brick oven. Our total was $37 for the antipasto, pizza and 3 sodas. I didn't think that was bad at all!

I would say getting a Caesar salad with your pizza is a must as it is absolutely the best Caesar dressing I have ever had!  I always dip my crust in it afterwards- so delicious!

3827115,2010-06-25,2,RRw9I8pHt5PzgYGT2QeODw,"Ok, I was heading home after checking out another Pizzeria and decided today was Pizza day and stopped by here to give it a try.

I didn't expect to find a nice restaurant, but that's exactly what the place is like.  It's tucked between the Summerlin renowned Kona Grill & Gordon Biersch in the Boca Park Shopping Center.  This spot has failed numerous times over the past 5 years.....I hope these people make it.

Anyway, I sat at the bar and ordered a Blue Moon.  They don't serve Pizza by the slice here....so I had to go for a 12"" Personal Pizza.  Since I already had 3 slices from the other joint, I knew I had my work cut out for me despite the small size.  I decided on a Pepperoni & Jalapeno Pizza.....the bartender Aubrey or was it Audrie?....anyway, she said the Jalapenos kick your ass, so was I sure I wanted it......of course I do!

The restaurant has a cool & comfortable feel to it.  I'll have to bring the family back sometime soon.

After a few minutes my Pizza came out.  It was much larger than I expected.  The thin crust was cooked nice and cripsy....well done, just how I like it.  However, there is a lot of sauce on this Pizza.....more than I normally like, -2 in my book.  

The flavor of the sauce overwhelms the Pizza, so it's hard to taste the other ingredients.  The Pepperoni is the tiny almost Slim Jim type and had good flavor to it....too bad it was drowned in sauce.  Aubrey/Audrie was right, the Jalapenos do pack a serious Punch.....I was sweating pretty good after a couple of slices, and no it wasn't from the 100 degree DRY Vegas heat....it was from the Jalapenos.....good thing Aubrey/Audrie kept my Blue Moon full.

Overall, I enjoyed the atmosphere, service, and the Pizza.

Will I return?  Yes, I will bring the family with me next time and try a different pie.",QJI9OSEn6ujRCtrX06vs1w,7,4,3,8ms5XYsiFXyFKJQPw5zKGA

4014496,2013-11-15,0,RRw9I8pHt5PzgYGT2QeODw,"It was a while since I went to Grimaldi's Pizzeria so forgive me if this review is a bit late.  The O.G. Grimaldi's Pizzeria is located in NYC, and is legendary in those parts as being one of the best places to get a slice.  In fact, the one time I was in NYC and had plans to eat there, the line was out the door.  Needless to say we missed the boat on that one.  

But luckily, even though it's not location #1 there's a Grimaldi's here in good old Las Vegas.  NY pizza?  Made in coal burning brick oven?  There's nothing like it.  Definitely a step above your chains like the Hut, Dom's, or Papa's.

No offense against Chicago, but I love a slice of NY pie.  No deep dish here at Grimaldi's, just yummy thin crust!  Crisp, a nice burnt edge, clean and tasty.  I could eat an entire pie by myself if given the opportunity.

Grimaldi's has a great menu, somewhat typical of what you would find in a pizza joint.  But simplified.  No chicken fingers or intricate pasta dishes here.  Just pizza, calzones, and salads on the main menu.  And I like it!  Simple is good, as long as you do it right.

The wifey and I shared a date night out and had a great meal.  We started with the Grimaldi's House salad - romaine lettuce, red onion, cherry tomatoes, roasted red peppers, mushrooms, green olives, and mixed with the house vinaigrette.  Good starter - fresh, light, and flavorful with a good kick from the vinaigrette.  

For our pizza, we went for a large Grimaldi's seasonal special - The Buffalo Chicken.  It was a pie topped with grilled chicken breast, Buffalo sauce, mozzarella cheese, and bleu chesse crumbles.  Cooked till the crust and top was a golden bubby brown this pizza was pretty scrumptious.  Cheesy and melty, with a spicy punch, and a healthy crunch.  Not bad for a non-traditional pizza.  Next time though I think I might stick with something more Italian, maybe a straight up cheese, or a Margheria with cheese, fresh tomato, and basil.  

Pizzas range from $12 - $16 for an entire pie, with toppings coming in at an additional cost each.  Specialty pies will cost in the $20 - $22 range since they come with a range of toppings included.  Calzones come in around the $10 - $18 range depending on what size you get.  Salads are a good deal coming in small or large sizes at prices from $9 - $11.  You can get away with a decent meal for around $40 after tax and tip.  OK for a date night.

Grimaldi's even does pizzas to go, and they come in a fancy box!  So in case you don't want to stay, feel free to call in an order, pick up, and go.  Pizza Pizza!  Wait...wrong chain.",QCtHk02W_Asu2LFfdmGQDA,1,2,4,u_qDjjmQad3o6fkkf9noFg

Never been much of a pizza bloke as I felt being full by of average crusts and semi cold delivered pizza from the big boys of Pizza, Pizza Hut etc wasn't really healthy or satisfying.

Situated in Boca park next to Cheesecake Factory, Embers and Kona Grill. grimaldi's has a great layout with stool style seating, sit down dining area and a small patio area out the front to boot. The pizza is a Coal Brick oven style that unlike a lot of other places sets up for topping priority tasting dish.

Having been here a few times I've always found the Antipasti a great starter with a nice serving of bread with olive oil and vinegar.

Ordering a Sausage, Pepperoni, Ricotta cheese pizza, the medium size pizza was enough for 3 people easy. Presentation is always top notch and competes with most pizza joints locally.

The service here is prompt but also it can be sometimes a little wait to get a table as it's always fairly busy most day/nights of the week. 

One of the only cons is even though they had high chairs for children, the menu didn't really have much flexibility for what the little ones can be served. I asked if they had a pasta dish that could be served in a smaller portion but the server pretty much nix anything that was asked..",JlwWHBFT76iSJe5mWIcZ4A,2,2,3,WB8kHizPdRJf2ajLPidvPg

We decided on what we wanted, which was our go to of pepperoni and mushrooms on the regular pizza.  We then sat and waited for our pizza to come out while smelling all of the pizzas around us.  We were salivating like rabid dogs just from the wonderful aromas drifting this way and that!  Nothing really smells better than fresh baked pizza in my book! Yummmm.

So when our beautiful pepperoni and mushroom pizza arrived, we attacked the pie like no one's business.  The first bite I took resulting in me seeing fireworks going off.  I totally had a party in my mouth.  All I can say about the flavor is AMAZING!  I was in love from the first bite.  By the time I had finished my lovely first slice, my hubby was on his 3rd piece.  I don't think he was taking time between bites to breathe or even chew.  He was in pizza ecstasy!

We are now Grimaldi's lovers!  It has been added to our list of regular pieces to visit.  They have an email club and if you plan on going, I would sign up for it.

This is a great place for a 21 year old guy to to take his 19 year old date, who he's trying to impress, by ordeing wine with Pizza, and letting her sneak sips of it. 

Pizza is really hyped and not that good. Certainly, over priced. Long wait, and very arrogant staff. 

Went with my then, Hipster Son, and his girl friend. They were impressed, I was not.

I ordered a Sausage Pizza, with double meat. Looks like they were running out of Sausage, and barely sprinkled the pizza. When I complained, the waiter just said,
""That's how it is"".

Negatives:  
- The cheese they use looks weird and has an odd texture (in my opinion).
- The pepperoni slices were too thick and no consistency in sizes and thickness... I don't like that.

Positives:
- Good pizza.  Nothing spectacular
- NOT Deep dish.  
- Split between me and my hungry boyfriend... perfect size for 2

Mediterranean salad: 
- Pretty fresh, some of the pieces of lettuce were wilted and red...

1. Hold your pizza pie up by the crust and it must lie perpendicular to you. The slice was slagging. Grade C-
2. Make sure the ingredients/ toppings remain on the pie. It started to droop off the dough within several seconds. Grade C- 
3. When you bite into the pie, make sure there's a crunch. No crunch to be found. Grade D
4. With the bite, steam should be coming out of your mouth. Indeed it did A.

I like pizza, I eat a lot of it. Am I the only one? Didn't think so. 

Stopped by this Grimaldi's right around lunch time after my friends and I had tuckered ourselves out shopping for Christmas goodies around Boca Park. We were very hungry with visions of pizzas dancing in our heads as wen entered the rustic-looking establishment. It is not huge, nor is it small. The wooden tables and wooden decor all around make a nice, cozy feeling. I caught a glimpse of the lighting above, which are wine bottle hung from the ceiling - loved it!

As for the menu, it's straight up simple here so don't come looking for anything other than pizza, salad, or a calzone. There were no appetizers on the menu, to which I was slightly disappointed. This may be different at dinner, but I can't be sure.

Everything here is pretty much build your own pizza, which I think is pretty cool. We started with the white garlic pizza (large), added grilled chicken, fresh Roma tomatoes, fresh basil, and for a nice spicy kick - jalapenos. Often times I think fresh tomatoes on pizzas make them soggy and gross, but luckily this one did not.

The pizza came out relatively fast; it is a nice, crispy, thin pizza, with a bubbly, brown, crunchy crust. I am not a pizza-connoisseur so I am not sure what ""style"" this may be, but I enjoyed it. I think we got just the right amount of toppings, anymore and the poor pizza would not have withheld them.

My suggestions: come if you want PIZZA, straight up, nothing else. Build your own and experiment with toppings. BUT - do not go crazy, I'd say, 3 *maybe* 4 toppings at the most and make sure you're putting stuff on there that makes sense.

Overall I was pleased, between the three of us we got an amazing pizza, plenty of toppings, and splitting the bill we each owed UNDER $10. Yes. That's a damn good deal. Of course, remember, there were three of us splitting a large, so prices may vary! I will definitely come back here to try some more styles and toppings.",hZfzVrhsCQ9JDAb2jYoJNQ,1,1,5,H7ddyOOlkaQzzpTR8GTVFA

4484732,2017-02-07,3,RRw9I8pHt5PzgYGT2QeODw,"After a terrific Yelp event at a Grimaldi's nowhere near where I live, I thought it was time to visit the one in Boca Park, close to home.  It's been open for a long time, but it was new for me.

I had sampled their private label red wine, Mille Gradi, at the event.  It's a red, which I don't drink.  But I loved it so much that I was looking forward to ordering it.  That is, until I saw the price.  I don't usually get wine that's $10 a glass (how un-Yelpy of me, I know), but threw all resolve to the wind and treated myself.  Some of the wines are reasonably priced, but more aren't.  Case in point: Sangria straight out of a bottle is $11.  I think not.  At most other places it's cheaper than all other wines, even when homemade.  I've just looked at their menu online and find that the wine prices listed are completely outdated, some as much as $3 a glass less than what you're charged at the restaurant.  This is all too common, and really pisses me off.  If I had checked it out before we went, I'd have been a bit riled.  I don't like sticker shock.  I don't think it's deliberate, just laziness, or they don't want to pay someone to update it.

I appreciate a pizza place whose decor is more like a nice restaurant than a pizza take-out.  It's pretty, warm, big but cozy, with great lighting and atmosphere.  We shared a small Mediterranean salad, and that size was actually pretty big, more than enough for the two of us to have a substantial portion. I forgot to ask for the dressing on the side, and was happy that the salad wasn't drowning in it - it had just the right amount, though some people might have to ask for more.

We got a large pizza, with green pepper, baby spinach, and sliced Roma tomatoes.  Spinach, what spinach??  You can buy a bag of baby spinach for $2 bucks and wallpaper at least 10 pizzas with it.  On our pizza, no slice had more than one leaf, a few of those were burned beyond recognition, and too many had none at all.  I'm not one to shut up and eat, so I brought it to the attention of the waitress.  The manager came over, too, and they offered to remake the whole pizza.  To their credit, and our surprise, they didn't take the first pizza and throw it out, but asked us if we wanted to take it home, along with the leftover new pizza. 

I did enjoy the final pizza, though the (red) sauce is a bit light.  I prefer chunky tomatoes and a heavier sauce.  But I did like the crust, because it was crisp and not salty.

The service was excellent, and the manager, David, was extremely friendly and chatty, which we like.  Maybe it was his NY accent, though he's from upstate, but not too far upstate :)

I wish that Grimaldi's wasn't so pricey, because it will impact future visits.  We'll definitely return, but not as often as we might like.",m-BZLIIh5PCAKnzH0qj_0Q,6,7,4,-IKHwqycfJ4lSR9f1S0UrA

My boyfriend and I came here recently got a small which was plenty enough to share. We started with the caprese for an appetizer which was so so but for the pizza we went with meatballs, artichoke, mushrooms, basil, garlic and sundries tomatoes. Ah-mazing!

They have outside seating as well as seating inside. There is also a bar inside the restaurant. The staff is very friendly and we did not have to wait too long for our food.

As far as the pizza goes, it's not bad. It is definitely over priced. It is good thin crust pizza. I can't tell the difference between coal oven pizza and wood fire pizza, but they use a coal oven. It is definitely not NY pizza. I would compare it to pizza like you would get at Sammy's.

The salads were were plain and bland, just like most pizza places serve their salads.

Again. It is expensive for a pizza in this place. Each item is $2 or $3 extra, depending on the item. One pizza with a few items really adds up.

One thing to love about Grimaldi's Pizzeria is their birthday special - a free large pizza with one free topping,

After hiking up at Red Rock last Sunday, a group of us came here famished and ready to indulge! First thing that caught my eyes were the wine bottle chandeliers, propped without their base, cap traded in for a light-bulb. They absolutely complimented the 'old town' feel of the restaurant. 

We went on to order a large caesar's salad (dressing on the side), and a pizza (that came with mozarella), basil and italian sausage. Crust was thin and crispy and meat was juicy. Salad wasn't out of this world, but scrumptious nonetheless (especially after our hike!) What sparkled things (and eventually raised the rating to a 4 from what I believe should've been a 3.5) was the limited $5 Thin Mint Cookie Cheesecake made with girl scout cookies! Oh boy were they fine! Four of us shared it if I'm not mistaken, that cake slice was gone in less than minutes!

If you're up for a free pizza too, ask for an application card, fill it out and wait for their email offer a week before your birthday!",QJMOgjRYeogK43kyfX6PKw,2,3,4,MqbXe7YBo975Pti6F-HJyQ

Tucked in between Kona Grill and Gordon Bierch is the pizzeria that made the Brooklyn Bridge famous and now you can experience EXCELLENT NY pizza here on the West Coast without waiting in a long ass line with tons of tourists on Old Fulton Street.  Just park in the strip mall and head towards the fountain and you will find one of the greatest pizzerias in Summerlin (the other one is Rocco's by Costco).  I'm born & raised NY and my taste buds have been in training all my life, I know Great Pizza.

This thin crust is cracker crisp and will stay perfectly horizontal even without folding.  Here is what separates the Grimaldi style from others: 
1. They place fresh HANDMADE mozzarella slices (not shredded) on the crust FIRST
2. Sauce is drizzled on top after the toppings (white pizza does not even have sauce)
3. Oven temperature is HOTTER than hell which can soar up to 1200 degrees.  This coal oven brick pizza gives the crust that distinct charred flavor and crispiness.  Look under the crust and you will see the color that's different.  
4. Pepperoni are little tiny salty slices which crisp up a bit.  SOOO GOOOD
5. When you have been in the pizza business this long, you know that there are key factors that people connotate with excellent pizza: New York style, NY water, sauce, cheese, oven temperature, etc.  Grimaldi re-creates the NY style of water by re-creating the exact mineral content of Brooklyn water to make sure the dough is just like NY.

The coal brick oven is a goldmine and permit nightmare in NYC.  It wasn't possible to install a coal brick oven in Manhattan where Grimaldi originally wanted to open his pizzeria, so he opened up in Brooklyn (coal ovens had to be grandfathered in from the building).  Under the bridge on Old Fulton Street is famous, but now with the latest lease controversy, there is the new location around the corner from the original.  Back in 1904 Lombardi opened a brick oven pizza in SOHO and you can also wait in line to compare.  In March 2012, Juliana's will be opening up in NY as another Grimaldi spin off.",8MCPA2HbOLScDu80ptHHjQ,0,0,5,OF4UF-_liukwXcJTWtuMQA

Grimaldi's is not brick oven pizza. It is COAL BRICK OVEN PIZZA that is DELICIOUS. 

   This Grimaldi's looks similar to the majority of their restaurants that I have had the pleasure to dine in. Before we walked in the door, the hostess welcomed us. She seated us in the middle. To the back was the open kitchen where they made the coal brick oven pizza. To the right was a hall with the restrooms.  To the left was a bar. Throughout the restaurant were pictures of New York. Above was soft lighting which made for a relaxing supper.

  I ordered a personal pizza ($9). When you dine with other people, the personal pizza is the way to go. It is thin crusted with a portion that will fill you up, and your company will not be thinking badly of you for taking one slice too many. If I had been more hungry I would of paid more for a mushroom topping. The bottomless cola had zero flatness issues. The dinner was supposed to come with house bread. They forgot about it, which is not the end of the world.

  With Grimaldi's major growth, it is easy to return to a Grimaldi's. To me this is a good thing.",0tvCcnfJnSs55iB6mqPk3w,5,5,4,TdydU_ADBgBP3cJFO1-fcA

We prefer to sit in one of the booths in the front of the restaurant, facing the bar, because it feels more intimate there than in the larger dining area, which is usually crowded.

If you like Caesar salad, theirs is way above the normal pizza restaurant quality. The small size is more than enough for two!

Despite another review below,  your pizza does include cheese in the base price. They only charge for cheese if you are ordering extra cheese.

The sauce was wasn't acidic but still had a good taste of tomatoe. The crust was thin with a good chew, it had the perfect thickness.

On the other hand, it wasn't that filling. For being a large pizza, it was less filling than the Naples style pizza that I have tried, which tend to be meant for one person. 

I also got a canoli. The pastry part was fried too hard. The cream was on point, it was creamy without being overly sweet.

But I didn't come here for the cheesecake. Overall, the experience was great, the pizza was delicious, and i would absolutely return.",DBm03EUUIFGOqB_CmWp9FA,1,1,4,MHLZPFqGoVUb5BjHu87yZA

The sauce was ok but just ""OK"". The cheese lacked flavor but was OK. And I ordered extra fresh garlic which they billed me twice for and was not fresh and there was not much there. I liked that they had a nice selection of beers on tap and some decent wine also. My mission was simple: to find the best NY thin crust pizza in Las Vegas and other places while I travel.

Pizza: Very good, the personal size was sized just right, not teeny tiny and not a small size pizza in disguise.  The crust was thing and crispy and tasty, the sauce was fairly good and the topping selection was great.  I had no cheese with sun dried tomato, kalamata olives and artichokes.  The downside was each topping costs 2-4 $ extra, which is quite a lot I think.  However, they did give you a good amount of topping which is important since I don't have cheese.  I would order it again

Service:  The service was good, the waitress was chatty, which was slightly annoying, but she was nice and had good intentions.  

Downside:  The iced tea was tasty but $$$, I think it was like 4 or 5$ for one drink my oh my that's crazy pricey.  Since there were four of us we spent over 20 dollars on non alcoholic beverages

5127036,2011-11-05,2,RRw9I8pHt5PzgYGT2QeODw,"I know I'm hard on pizzerias. I'm gonna preface my review by saying this; Grimaldi's is... different. I don't mean it's a bad place; it's actually a really good pizzeria. It's just coal fire pizza. That's not something I'm particularly accustomed to. It is however not a bad approach. I'll always be a diehard brick oven proponent. To a pizza maker/connoisseur, it's more drastic than a Pepsi vs. Coke argument. It's more like Charcoal vs. Gas grills, American vs Foreign cars, Macs vs. PCs, or Revolvers vs. Semi-Auto pistols. It's just a fundamentally different approach. But I can actually appreciate it for what it is. 

The decor is nice and classy for a pizzeria. Like a more upscale old school NY pizza joint. The quality of ingredients are high. I order different things now and then. I really like the meatball and ricotta toppings. Being coal oven pizza, you still get a pretty crispy pie. Sometimes, the crust is too crispy though, even for me. And since this is all the nature of the beast with coal ovens, the toppings aren't always piping hot. But it all has a really good flavor to it. And the service is outstanding. If you sit at the bar you might have Audrey serving you. She's a good friend, and she's pretty awesome. Tell her I sent you, if she's there when you go. The manager is pretty cool too! I would definitely recommend giving this place a try, if you have any interest in pizza whatsoever. If you are diehard like me, and from back east... you may be more critical. Just look at it as something a little different and appreciate it for what it is. You might actually love it. I've put it in my pizza rotation, and I think that says a lot.

5199339,2010-04-05,18,RRw9I8pHt5PzgYGT2QeODw,"I had an odd experience at Grimaldi's. I have never had a meal start at one star level and then gradually slip into another star dimension. If I had taken one, hot bite and jumped on here to write a review, I would probably have given the pie a solid 4 stars, but that is not what happened. The pizza slowly became a hot, or rather cold, mess. 

The place is cute with old wine bottle chandeliers. The bottoms are cut out, and the bulbs are contained within the bottle. They are clustered around the ceiling and are quite fascinating. It took a minute for our server to show up and greet us, and for some reason, on Saturday evening I was being a stickler for service, so that bothered me a bit. It is quite possible that the brightness of the wine bottle chandeliers made me hypersensitive. The bar area might be more comfortable.

We ordered a small salad and a large pizza with onion, garlic and jalapeno. Based on that scent profile, it is pretty obvious that I already have a man. The small salad was a huge and a good value at $5. The dressing wasn't a standout; it lacked that vinegary punch! Then the pie arrived. As I have been at other local pie joints, I was underwhelmed by the volume of toppings. I might start showing up with my own. Just start pulling baggies of onions and mushrooms at of my purse. Anyways, the first slice of the pizza was great. The sauce is a little sweet, and the crust was a tad crispy, but still with a good chew. No burnt edges, which meant I ate all of the crust. However, as the pizza started to get cold, the crust became stale. 

Perhaps it is yeast or oil deprivation. The pizza was the least greasy pizza I have had in quite some time, but I would trade in a stale pizza for a big ol' greasy pizza any day of the week. Maybe we went on a weak dough day, so I am up for a revisit, but for now it is a 3.44 star deal, which sadly requires rounding down.",qewG3X2O4X6JKskxyyqFwQ,17,11,3,5LPJ-qLg3dZQ3O_AnFIdfA

My husband I don't like the same toppings so we tried to order 1/2 on one side and 1/2 on other side.  They charge full price still for each topping even if only on 1/2 the pizza..  Pizza looked large but not filling due to the thin crust.  A small with two toppings will set you back $16.00 bucks.  Was shopping at Fashion Show mall with friends and they wanted to try this place.  4 calzone's and 4 sodas later set us back $91.00 without tip.  Ouch.

So, a big thank you to them for a very nice treat!  The free pizza came with one topping, and I chose the basic pepperoni topping.  

The restaurant is located in Boca Park which is an upscale shopping area with  various stores and restaurants.  The lot filled up fast on a weekend with nice weather, so it may not always be easy to find a parking spot. This area is quite popular!  

There's a very pretty fountain in the front with outdoor patio seating which is great during nice weather.  The interior is somewhat dimly lit, but that's actually relaxing on hot Vegas days.  The decor is well designed  and there's tables along with  a few booths tucked here and there.  

The pizza is thin crust,  I tend to be more of a thick crust person, however, their thin crust was nicely executed, with just enough crunch but not tough or chewy.  I expected it to have a bit more oven/smokey/coal baked flavor, so that was a little disappointing, although not a huge drawback. The sauce was okay - every now and then, the sauce tasted somewhat like meat sauce that you'd put  on spaghetti rather than typical  pizza sauce, but nevertheless was good.  As some people have pointed out, the cheese has a habit of coming off with the bite rather than sticking to the crust.  Again, not a huge drawback, just a tad annoying.  Let's put it this way:  I've had better pizza and I've also had a lot worse, so Grimaldi's certainly provides a pizza that's worth checking out.

I also ordered one of their in-house cannolli.  As seems to be the case with cannolli, most of it isn't very memorable, with a filling that didn't stand out with any particular flavor.  It contains mini chocolate chips which are tasty, and that's mainly what you taste with this cannolli.  I won't hold that against them, though, because as I say, most cannolli for some reason seems to be run of the mill.  My recommendation  would be to  try a different dessert,  such as  one of their seasonal cheesecakes or their tiramisu. 

They also serve wine and beer, although I didn't try any of those offerings.

Service was outstanding, professional, friendly and helpful.  FIVE STAR on that!  

I was very  happy to have had the opportunity to try this Grimaldi's and if/when I make the trek  here for a second try, I would be more adventurous with the pizza toppings, as per some of the suggestions of other posters.  Bottom line:  if you're looking for a visually pleasing, nicely upscale area to have a pizza located in Boca Park  with friends and family, this spot would certainly be one to consider and check out!",r1Z8dxSnd7T4XEAhVUoA0Q,0,0,3,L48fkGETdRuaI9BULil6IA

Sometimes, you just don't want to make pizza at home, or do delivery.  You just want to sit in a real, honest to goodness pizza joint that's not accompanied by an animatronic mouse singing outdated Barbra Streisand tunes from the 1980's.

But in seriousness, the pizzas are excellent, with a full range of toppings and sides, and it's easy to get enough for two people.  The service during my visit was excellent.  The server was very conscientious, making sure that my beer was poured properly without a foamy head.  It was just little touches that made the dining experience pleasurable. 

Pricing was decent.  You pay for each topping separately, so a more ambitious pizza would become more costly.  But three toppings was a sweet spot.  Service was very fast for a weekend lunch, but nothing felt or tasted rushed.

This was not a big deal for me sometimes the dough bubbles when you bake it and things happen.  What we didn't expect was for him to be apologizing profusely for the hole and informing us that he had ordered another of the same pizza personal size (which is 12 inches) to make up for the hole

The positives:
*This is my favorite type of pizza.  Thin, crispy, not greasy, unprocessed cheese, fresh ingredients.
*The patio area is lovely.
*The passion fruit iced tea is top notch.
*The meatball topping is very nice.
*The cheesecake is delicious.
*Portions are generous.

The negatives:
*The antipasto didn't come with lettuce, so we got a house salad instead.  The house salad was large, but almost 90% lettuce.  Lame.
*They don't serve ranch (I take this personally).  Not only do they not serve ranch, but when I asked for it while ordering the salad, our server didn't say anything about not having it.  I was pretty disappointed when the salad came with a big dish of ""vinaigrette"" on the side.  Vinaigrette = a monkey dish full of oil, with half a teaspoon of some murky purple crap at the bottom.  I couldn't mix the oil into the murky purple crap, or get the murky purple crap out past the oil.  It was disgusting.  If I had been told they didn't have ranch, I probably would have gotten a different salad, or none at all.  The only other dressing they had was Caesar, and I'm not a fan.  There are like 8 salads on the menu, what's with the crappy dressing selection?  :(
*Pizza toppings are all sold separately from the pizza, and they cost $2-$5 each.  Adds up fast.
*The crust stops tasting good as soon as the pizza cools down.
*The sauce is a bit too sweet.
*The service is a little weird.  The pizza came while I was working on the salad, and I told the server that I would use the same plate.  She then unceremoniously plopped a giant slice of pizza onto my plate (still half full of salad) while I was actively eating from it.  Wtf?

In the end, Grimaldi's is a legit pizzeria that does everything right.  Great atmosphere for a pizza joint, great service all-around (although it can sometimes be a bit slow), and the best made pizza I've yet found.  

So let me explain the ""best made"" part a bit.  I can't quite say Grimaldi's pizzas are the best TASTING pizza I've had, although it is among them.  By ""best made"", I am talking about the parts that made the whole.

- Fresh toppings, including things like real basil leaves, real chopped garlic, etc.
- Sauce that's not too much, not too little
- (Outstanding #1) Real, white, sliced (not cut into little pieces) mozzarella cheese that eliminates much of the grease that you find at the typical NY pizza place (even in NYC)
- (Outstanding #2) Perfectly made crust that is slightly crispy outside, perfectly chewy without being overly firm inside, and not too bready

From ingredients and execution standpoint this really is a 5-star pizza.  The sum of all it's parts, however, may fall a bit shy of that since I can't bring myself to truly give it a full 5-star taste.  No matter, it's still close to it.  Plus, their Caprese salad is the bomb!  Fresh tomatoes and thick mozzarella chunks, bedded by giant, whole leaves of basil.  Nyam, nyam, nyam!  Where do they get those giant basil leaves??  And then top it all off with a glass of Peroni.

In my 4 visits to Grimaldi's I've never been disappointed.  The only thing left to try is their calzone which, by the taste of their pizza crust, should be outstanding.

Table-for-1 Factor:  I typically see most pizza joints as ideal solo dining spots.  Grimaldi's may not exactly fit that bill, but they do have bar area where you can sit and nosh on your own.  I don't see why not.",52Oq0fCJWaHpQtuKqTkN4g,2,1,5,xl_0SsHFjA9ZBQD_czQVyQ

I appreciate the access to indoor and outdoor seating. Indoors, the children enjoy watching pizza preparation as they peer through a window overlooking the chefs' kitchen. Outdoors, I don't fret about an accidentally spilled drink and mounds of fallen crumbs. Rather, our focus is on the breeze, a fountain, and at times live music (for example from a nearby restaurant on Cinco de Mayo).

Grimaldi's is prompt to provide crayon packs and kid fun activity menus. Another kid-friendly aspect is the mound of fresh, pliable pizza dough presented on a silver pizza tray to each child. This hands-on activity keeps everyone entertained.

The gluten-free pizza menu is a build your own product. I prefer the GF basil pesto pizza for $16, I too it with red onions and artichoke hearts. The fresh, crunchy Kale Chopped Salad I opt to omit the shaved parmesan ( although the salty taste adds flavor and gritty texture to those who can eat dairy). The Greek olives, sweet red onions, lemons are a blend of refreshing and tangy flavors. Check out the seasonal menu. We ordered an 18"" pizza with chicken BBQ.

The ricotta cheese option makes this particular pizza stand out from others. They give the kids some dough to play with to pass the time, and there's an observation window in the back for them to watch the pizzas being made. Score!

The decor is pretty cool with wine bottles for pendant lights at the bar area and hanging from the ceilings. It's a very ""New York"" vibe with old signage from the original grimaldis. 

I love eating outside, so it's a big draw to me when restaurants have that as an option.

It was the small slices like you'd find on a Red Barron frozen pizza and the flavor wasn't great. We picked it off and still managed to finish the whole pizza. 

We will definitely be returning. Great family place. Quick service. Yummy food. You can't beat it! (Although, I will say... I still miss Ciao Ciao's.)",eCjQpniDmsnw3Hc9qP0ASw,3,1,4,Up30iQw1nXV6GoJqdiLLUw

5846976,2010-10-21,0,RRw9I8pHt5PzgYGT2QeODw,"Now like most college students, pizza is something I eat on the regular. Maybe a slice from Metro Pizza, or a cheap $5.00 from Little Ceasars, but it's not often I go to a place wanting more than just your average slice. Grimaldi's Pizzeria is that place to get that more than average slice!

We decided to visit Grimaldi's after a brief business meeting that didn't run quite as brief as we had planned. We considered going to Monta (refer to my past review that great experience) but based on the size of the group we decided somewhere a little more open would be more suitable. A member of the group had mentioned that Grimaldi's was a great place for some pizza, and so we took a vote and Grimaldi's came out on top.

Once we arrived I was pleasantly surprised by the decor. This place really gave off a classy vibe while still being comfortable and fun. The chandeliers weren't diamond and gold, they were empty wine bottles, talk about inventive! There were older pictures framed on the wall that really made you feel like this place had something authentic going on, which I suppose it did. They only design flaw that came to mind for the group was that there was only one restroom for both genders. Not really too much of an issue when it's not that busy, but I'd imagine an unhappy line of people during the high business hours.

Now whats the first thing you look at after you sit down in a restaurant? Many people might say the table, and in that case you're probably right. But one of the first things you take a good look at is the menu. The menu I had in my night was at first a little confusing. At Grimaldi's they don't have a list of pre-built pizza, every pizza is built to order. There were three types of base pizza. The traditional pizza, a white with garlic pizza, and the pesto. Following that was a list of toppings including items like fresh cut tomatoes, meatballs, and even anchovies. Knowing their menu can be a bit daunting, the waitress was very quick to inform everyone at the table of how the ordering process went. Not only was this very helpful, it was quite entertaining as well. The staff was excellent and very knowledgeable about their menu. The waitress also helped us decide on how we would split the check before we ordered, which is great because at most places we're left at the end with 5 people who need to pay on card and no pre-arranged plan what-so-ever.

Being new to the place our side of the table decided to try something we don't usually see on a menu. We opted for a Large (18 in.) white and garlic pizza with Meatballs, Italian sausage, sun dried tomatoes, and artichoke hearts. The wait for the food was a little long, but understandable considering the table had so far ordered 3 large completely custom pizzas. The pizza that arrived was amazing. The toppings tasted quite fresh and the flavor was fantastic. The crust was enjoyable and the cheese was stringy and delicious, just how I like it. The standard condiments were at the table, parmesan and the crushed red pepper, but they were also joined by a few others like garlic powder. Each pizza was cut into 8 pieces and since we had 6 people on our check we decided it was a good idea to order a second.

The second pizza we ordered was a large Pesto with grilled chicken, roasted sweet red peppers, and freshly sliced tomatoes. If you haven't eaten a pesto pizza before, maybe Grimaldi's should be where you are having dinner tonight, this pizza was amazing. It was full of flavor, the fresh pieces chicken complimented the flavorful pesto while the sweet red pepper really brought balance to the whole ensemble. The waitress had told us that people order combinations similar to this and we can see why, it did not disappoint in the least.

Grimaldi's Pizzeria is a bit on the pricey side, the average large pizza you will build comes out to around $30.00 each, but when you break it down to each person it's not that bad. Grimaldi's over all was a great experience and definitely a good place to go if you're looking for more than the average slice of pizza and want to be daring with your choices.",-4rIIhA9iPs2bR5Ea7Z4OA,2,1,4,EgbE0q5-jGiSxSextBc6fg

My husband and I love their pizza and don't eat pizza elsewhere, unless we really have to. The flavors are phenomenal. I do think, however, that the Eastern Avenue branch makes better pizza on a consistent basis than this one. On a couple of occasions, the crust here was overdone: it was hard, like a cracker. Plus, the service isn't as great as the other branch. We've had waiters forget things here.

After 30 minutes we are seated , our server is truly excellent , offered water , ice teas immediately . They arrive about 2 minutes later . Great.

The menu , Pizza or Salad . That's it , no sides , appetizers , nothing. It's a Pizza restaurant so I suck it up. They do give you a small plate of thinly sliced bread with oil & vinegar so the kids are slightly placated.

We order one large cheese pie , and one large pie with grilled chicken and mushrooms.  These pizzas are FABULOUS! Our server dispensed the first slices , offered some condiments before leaving . Delicious , thin crispy pizza served very hot. Could not have asked for more.

large pepperoni. thats all we wanted.

my girl needs sauce w all her food so we asked for ranch... THEY DONT HAVE ANY she says. im shocked and impressed. they keep it real italian. she offered their creamy caesar and was delightfully pleased.

5876973,2012-05-15,1,RRw9I8pHt5PzgYGT2QeODw,"So Ive had to ponder this review for a few days as Im conflicted. In all fairness this is by far the best pizza Ive had since moving to Las Vegas over a year ago. When I first moved here I ate at a new pizza joint every week in hopes of finding a good slice.

I finally found a great slice made in Vegas and Ive eaten at three of their locations now and the pizza has never disappointed.

That being said I did find a big hunk of metal in my salad. I want to give them negative stars for that alone but I love their pizza so much I cant. 

What I can say is that the manager came over and told me the salads were on the house and helped me fill out their incident report. I was physically fine and just lucky I hadn't swallowed it as I was thinking it was an olive pit. 

We were happy with that but 10 minutes later the owner came over to make sure I was OK and said the entire meal was on him and that we should have desert as well.

Just to show you how much I love this pizza we couldn't take him up on the offer as we were all stuffed.

Ok so outside of the Salad the Pizza was coal fired perfection and the owner/staff made the entire experience top notch and you shouldn't be afraid to try them out.

I know the price can freak you out but its worth every penny.

A break down of our experience here would be:

Salad 1 out of 5 (explanation already given)

Pizza 4 out of 5 (half order of onions turned into light onions on entire pizza)

Management 8 out of 5 (after my last experience like this I have to say all crisis like this should be handled so professionally.

Wait staff 4 out of 5 (we had empty drinks on our table a lot and Im sure that was because she was to nervous to come back to the table. She did a great job besides the empty drinks and we did tip her a good amount even though we were eating for free.

I have to say give them a chance just be careful chewing the salad.",Yg08tRMxm0eaL-rXyNIAHw,2,0,3,8-hTwUxfqrYuRgqRQr4zfw

5918825,2010-06-17,0,RRw9I8pHt5PzgYGT2QeODw,"Went to Grimaldi's Pizzeria for a friend's birthday.  We arrived relatively early for dinner and seating was not an issue, compared to the tougher task of finding a parking space not too far from the restaurant.

We ordered an antipasto course, which I though was good, but not exceptional.  We also ordered 2 medium pizza, with each half having different combination of toppings for more variety.  I like the thin and crispy pizza crust that is served here, which is not greasy like those served at some other pizzerias.

Overall the dining experience was A-OK!  The price of the bill was reasonable, especially for being in the more upscale Boca Park area of town.

However, it is also one of the more memorable dining experience for us, since one of the ladies in our party was apparently hit on while we were waiting for our drinks and appetizers to arrived by a totally random but well dress man.  And of all the topics to use to start the conversation, it was about carpal tunnel surgery (because her arm is still in a sling).  This carried on for about 5 minutes, before we realized that he is one of the FOH managers of the restaurant.  Anyway, he came back several times to check up on us, and also to correct a mistake in our bill (we ordered 2 medium pizzas, but one of them was accidentally written as a large). 

I would recommend this place for a casual get together, especially before or after shopping at Boca Park.",RQlnSCjuqMnhR3Qk6j4KoA,0,0,3,7TCm25pfWj4r-aYK_2-aoA

We walk in & get the feeling that people probably end up here when the wait time at The Cheesecake Factory is 30 mins. or so.

Server was not very friendly, never refilled our drinks & seemed to lack training. Checked on our food, looked unhappy & said ""alright"" (no ""enjoy your meal"" or anything along those lines) when we didn't need anything. Not sure they require servers to have a ""pleasing personality"" here.. When we were done, somebody literally just saw us out -- no 4 word, 4 syllable ""Thank you, good night"", or anything like that. As if we went in there & spat on their pizza?

The one nice person in there was this guy that took us to our table & gave my 19+ mo. old son a piece of dough to play with. The 2nd star in this review is for him.

The pizza is only something to write home about if you're writing your family to tell them not to bother with Grimaldi's.

We ordered a plain large pepperoni and large Don Pizza with green peppers and onions (our own style supreme). We also got a large Caesar salad for the table of 3 kids and 2 adults. It was a perfect size for us and there was enough for seconds. The pizzas were more than enough for us. One pizza would have sufficed but I figure with two hearty eaters (my 14 yr old son and boyfriend), it's best to play it safe. We went home with one whole pizza but I'm not complaining because who doesn't like leftover pizza? The slices were huge and very filling. We all stopped at one and a half and if we went to one of those chain spots, we'd kill a whole large ourselves. The Caesar salad was very tasty and my 4 year old even partook in it (woot woot).

Our server was a little slow at first and didn't greet us for a while and when offering a refill on the juice did not advise that its an additional charge or that the drink did not have free refills. Manager asked how everything was as we were walking out and advise food was delicious as always.
