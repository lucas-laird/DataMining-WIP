Dried old food. depleted cooked ingredients that are only cooked and replenished after someone waits in line for a half hour and orders them. avoid this place like the plague - go to a different zaba's!

The best thing about this place is your can get potatoes on your food! It's something so simple but so different for fast Mexican food. Clean atmosphere and their Zalapeno Balls with the chipotle ranch & cilantro are AMAZING. I either dip them in the ranch with cilantro or break up the zalapeno balls and put them in my bowl and it's life changing. Wow, I'm hungry just typing this.

Ordered food for take out for my family of 4 & they wouldn't give me the included drink with the kids meal because my child was not present, really?! I ordered a side of chips & had to pay separately for salsa. I will never return to this place & will not recommend it for the simple fact that not including the kids drink as advertised, because the child is not present is pretty tacky & cheap. The mall is surrounded by residential areas & I'm sure I'm not the only mother bringing home dinner to the family after shopping. Food is also sub par & customer service was lacking.

1274972,2014-11-17,0,Z1yvzAbs4fGC28s7WtUonA,"It was a gorgeous 70 degrees in Vegas yesterday.  Today it was about 50 degrees. The only thing colder was our food.  

This was our first time visiting this small local Las Vegas chain of ""quick service"" Mexican food restaurants.  After a long morning of braving the cold hiking Red Rock (yes, I'm well aware that it is below zero in Wisconsin ... which is why I don't live there, but that's another story), we were looking forward to warming up with some lunch.   

The food choices at ""Downtown Summerlin"" are rather sparse, and Zaba's won out over Italian.  

I ordered the chicken bowl, she had the veggie burrito.   OK, so I'm exaggerating a little when I write that the food was below 50 degrees ... more accurately it was luke warm at best.  Having noticed that the cheese hadn't melted as we paid the cashier, we inquired if the food could be warmed up; a direct ""no"" was the response.  Alrighty then; at least we knew where we stood on that topic.  

Aside from that, it was your average QSR Mexican food.  The food was tasty enough - nothing special, but nothing horrible.  While they served beer, which was a nice touch, it was disappointing that they didn't have a place to recycle the bottles. The restaurant was quite clean, and the staff (although not very helpful) was friendly.   

In short, if you're starving, it'll fill you up.  But hopefully as more restaurants open at ""Downtown Summerlin"", there'll be better options.",A63h_7zL1phcQvrRuwEpvw,0,0,3,4BMjuBib50RuRkP6L-X97Q

Food: I would say average Mexican food spot, in direct competition with Chipotle. I ordered a chicken bowl with guac. Delicious, but nothing to write home about. I still don't know if I like this place more than Chipotle, but it's worth a shot if you've never had them.

Service: Service was good, as it was opening day. The lunch crowd had made their way in and the line was starting to build up. I was greeted and handed a menu by a friendly woman upon entry. The cooking staff handled my order perfectly and the cashier attemped an upsell of chips, which I declined. All in all, pretty good service.

Decor: the establishment was clean and orderly despite being a bit busy on its first day. Indoor and outdoor seating is available.

After we had left the restaurant we were called and informed that they had not given us enough tortillas. They quickly remedied the problem by having an employee drive to our home to deliver the tortillas along with some extra queso for the inconvenience.

I've tried many different things (taquitos, tacos) on the menu but this time I got the carnitas nachos with the housemade queso sauce (a little on the salty side) and I wasn't sure how big it would be, but it was pretty big, which was surprising (the lady said it depends on what I added to it, and she was right- I had the fajitas (onions & peppers), green salsa, cabbage & some sour cream ). I love the carnitas at Zaba's! The nachos were really good until the last cheesy layer at the end which was at the very bottom, due to the salty queso cheese, so tossed it (plus some of the chips might've been salty, too). I might get it without it next time. Our son liked the nachos too, yup, we shared. Hubby had the burrito but said he likes the carnitas at Chipotle the best. He said it was still good, though, just not the best. For the three of us, lunch was under $20.00.

There are Zaba's Favorites (7 items, like Fish Tacos, Papas burrito featuring potatoes, Veggie Burrito) or Create Your Own Favorite (step 1- choose, your meat, step 2- choose your item, step 3- customize) as well as Kid's Meals (quesadilla, bowl, burrito, tacos), Sides/Combos (taquitos, tacos, zalapeno ballz, queso, rice & beans, chips & salsa, guacamole, & brownies. Drinks are soda, water, and some bottled drinks.

It was early, so the place was empty; except for the couple outside and the people who just paid for their meal. We were greeted right away. One employee was taking the brownies out of the pan; hubby noticed that they are fresh here. After seeing the menu, decided to eat here for lunch. The customizable drink fountains are also free refills (to the left of the cashier). Kitty corner from the drinks are the napkins, forks, and sauces (Tabasco Chipotle is so good) are towards the door to get outside for the outdoor seating. The bathrooms (single for each ) are also pretty close to this area; pretty clean. The glass windows are not tinted, so there's high visibility.  

There is indoor seating which is similar to Chipotle's restaurants- a large square-shaped room. The outdoor seating is pretty good, except, we barely squeezed through with the stroller (ok, it's a common problem we have), had to move some of the chairs to get to the corner table with an umbrella for sun cover. It was nice outside, the sun was shining, but it wasn't hot yet. No bugs or insects to disturb our lunch. We sat overlooking the fountain water feature and Dillards, which was closed. 

We'd come here again (unless another  area restaurant's menu entices us). Maybe try something else. Or else get the nachos without the queso. Mmm, nachos.",fiGqQ7pIGKyZ9G0RqWLMpg,1,0,4,17FVN1gfonEfe9t8czr-tA

I will try to post a picture of the small amount of beans they served me.   We have been eating here since they were located on Rampart and we keep going less and less for this reason.

I got a vegetarian salad with fajita veggies, sweet potatoes, corn, black beans and chipotle ranch dressing. The food was good quality, but lacked taste. I love that they have sweet potatoes and regular potatoes as an option for a different texture, but again, they lacked flavor. I found myself hunting for salt or something. Even the dressing, which I was sure would have some punch, was just creamy in texture, not really flavorful.

Another weird thing...the glass that separates you from the food in the ordering line makes it very very hard to hear the staff. Even though the girl that made my salad was speaking very clearly, it was muffled and I had to ask her to repeat things multiple times. This is not the best design.

In theory this place is very similar to Chipotle, but in practice I think they can make some major seasoning improvements to their veggies.",tnSVm_tdM5zthKgmGF5d1A,4,2,3,m_hdriS17GIS0dzCYM_yow

Taste wise, it is comparable, but the portion is a lot smaller. We got the burrito bowls, which were served on a plate and had a lot less room than Chipotle's tan bowl. And I hardly got any rice!! I felt like I was just eating a bowl of fillings. My bf hardly got any guac when he asked for it, and when he asked for more, the girl said that it would be charged extra. Really? So when someone gets one minuscule portion of guac and asks for just the correct portion, they charge for two. Wow.",uU2B1vrqkpWJI30xoooabw,1,0,2,DAOEO6J6D4fmO6A8ArjMMQ
5072949,2017-07-13,0,Z1yvzAbs4fGC28s7WtUonA,"I met clients for a late lunch today at Zabas. The menu is pretty simple and streamlined. There's lots of customizable options available as the employee fills a bowl for you from what you see in the selection behind the glass. That worked out for me as I'm on a food plan for the next 30 days that restricts a lot of the things that you'd be worried about eating at a Mexican food restaurant like beans and rice. I was able to get lots of fresh grilled vegetables, chili peppers, a good selection of grilled and shredded Meats and then all sorts of salsa, guacamole, and other condiments you could want. 

The service was good. The gal that was helping us was friendly and patient as I hadn't been there before. She let my dining companion have a sample of any meat that she requested to taste before buying. I like it when casual dining restaurants will let you do that.

My one complaint that I have is almost every table that we wanted to sit at needed to be wiped down.  The bench seats had stray pieces of rice on it. It was 2 o'clock in the afternoon so lunch rush wasn't an excuse. I would think that at that time of day there would be plenty of time to do some tidying up after the last diners.

There are a lot of restaurants in that shopping center area. You really need to be on point if you're going to capture more of the casual dining market share walking by.",0oCX_noDIESiIHKf7Sly1w,0,0,4,bgvTwC4j7EcenUBVqJg8rg

5711050,2014-12-15,10,Z1yvzAbs4fGC28s7WtUonA,"Came here on a late Sunday night after visiting a few shops nearby. I've never heard of Zaba's and so me and my friend decided to check it out. 
Right when we walked in, the first thing we had to search for was the menu (which was posted above the kitchen) and to our surprise it was much similar to Chipotle. 
The line wasn't too long nor too short so we had time to decide what to pick. You can customize your order OR you can pick Zaba's favorite meal(s) that include tacos, burritos, a bowl, quesadilla, nachos and a salad. 
My friend chooses to customize her 3 carnitas tacos while I chose Doug's Surf and Turf Burrito (one of the favorites- $10). 
The workers knew what goes inside the Surf and Turf and magically worked on my burrito, putting the necessary ingredients such as the shrimp, potatoes, pico de gallo, guacamole, rice, hot salsa, and steak (talk about a mouth-flavoring burrito!) My friend, on the other hand, had carnitas, corn, pico de gallo, rice and beans on all three of her tacos. The server generously piled the toppings on top of the corn tortillas and my friend couldn't finish her third taco. And as an additional treat (we always get this at Chipotle), we got the Chips and Guacamole ($2.39). Chips had a slight lime flavor and the guacamole wasn't as spectacular as I'd hope so {Chipotle won this round}. Lastly on my receipt, we got 2 large fountain sodas (est. $5). All in all, I paid $24 for a tummy of two and left the restaurant full and satisfied (she's still a chipotle fan-Grrr lol)

I see why Zaba's is slowly climbing up to Chipotle not because of similarity, but more of a slight, unique twist it has. Zaba's has more of a kick and spicyness that Chipotle tends to lack and I'm all about full-on flavor. 
Zaba's also has fish tacos, shrimp tacos, and nacho- which gives a variety of opportunities for those who dread the typical Chipotle meat menu. 

I'll be coming here more often to explore their menu. Great place to stop by at Downtown Summerlin Mall if you're nearby! Highly recommend =)",Bhc91b8DfAYeceqhHRnqHA,14,10,4,Y3fCAp6q25BLsp4BaR9k0Q
