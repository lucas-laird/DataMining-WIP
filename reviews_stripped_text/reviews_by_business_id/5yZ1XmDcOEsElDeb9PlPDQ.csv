We had Omelette ramen and Tanmen ramen. Tanmen had lots of veggies on top, the soup is Shio so pretty mellow and very good. We were told their Gyoza is made from scratch where many ramen places now use frozen stuff.

If Tonkotsu is too rich for you, this is a very good place to try. They have Shoyu, Shio, and Miso.

It surprisingly was not busy and our party of five was seated right away.  We first went to Jinya down the road, but they had a line out the door. So some quick Yelping got us here. 

Our server was very friendly and helpful with the menu.  They have a good selection of ramen and some other dishes.  I wasn't feeling ramen so I had the fried oysters with rice, some fresh veggies, and a bowl of miso soup.  It was delicious. Whenever I eat at a Japanese restaurant, I rate them by the quality of their rice, which was excellent.  The rest of my party had ramen and one had cold soba noodles.  They all mopped up their noodles and said how great tasting they were.  We shared the home made gyoza as an appetizer, which was very tasty.

I love this find and will be back.

Unlike the trendy, hip ramen places that have become popular in recent years, Yagyu sticks to the classics and does them well. 

The tonkotsu ramen I had was flavorful and the noodles were at a good firmness (if anything the soup was slightly too salty for my taste), gyoza and  1/2fried rice I had were great as well. The simplicity of their menu items remind me of what I grew up on.

This was my first time trying deep fried oysters and I was pleasantly surprised by how flavorful each bite was. I highly recommend ordering this appetizer. Some of their other standout dishes: I ordered their Nabeyaki Udon (It's a soup made with thick chewy udon noodles, vegetables, and a variety of toppings, depending on where you get it, from a poached egg to tempura shrimp, kamaboko  and chicken), very delicious. They also had a nice variety of ramen to choose from, everything tasted great. Their Unaju was very tasty as well. Overall, I give this restaurant 5 stars because of their delicious food and excellent service. Our waitress kept coming by to check on us and refilled our drinks without having to ask. She even cleared out our finished dishes so we could have more room. I also liked that they have a huge sign, advertising their frozen beer.

My father ( a sushi master)  and Chef Masa opened Vegas's best Japanese restaurant at the Wynn during the Casino's opening in 2006, I'm sure there is so much more behind chef Masa's culinary background , but his current shop,  YAGYU Ramen's menu has a pretty delicious spread. 
He does over 10 different kinds of Ramens including ( Mabo-Ramen / Kakuni- Ramen / kimchee Ramen / even a Hiroshima style champon ramen )
* Curry Rice Dishes
* Unagi Bowls 
And many more nostalgic dishes to those who have lived in Japan before. 

I had a super simple Shio Ramen ( plain clear broth) 
It was the most perfect classic noodle the way it's served in Japan, straight forward ingredients and just delicious.

The owner used to be the chef of the famous Togoshi Ramen that used to be ""the place for ramen"" until they went out of business a while back.  The owner of the Yagyu Ramen was the old Togoshi's chef when they were really good back in the 90s.  Today, I tried their miso ramen, and the soup was excellent!  So far, I've never found a place where the miso ramen wasn't as good as the Sapporo-ya in San Francisco's Japantown.  Today, I found it!  Yagyu's miso ramen!  It's very similar to the Sapporo-ya's original soup from the pre-90s.  Now I feel much better about living in Vegas. LoL

I've also had Yagyu's shoyu cha-shu-men and Nagasaki chanponmen and they are all excellent! What I found interesting is that traditional Nagasaki chanpon uses slightly thicker curvy noodle, but, Yagyu uses a regular ramen noodle, which draws the soup better when you eat it.  Yagyu's chanpon soup is a bit on the mild side, and is NOT loaded with lard like the traditional Nagasaki chanpon, which make it perfect for this noodle.

Vegas also has its share of many Ramen houses, but most of them are pretty good.  Having frequent Monta and Sora, I didn't think this place could match them.  Noodle quality is top notch and among the best here.  Broth is very good, but I may have to give Monta and Sora a slightly higher score with their broths.  However, this place trumps those two outstanding places with the other choices.  You can get Udon and Soba that cannot be found at the other places.  You can even get Yakisoba.  Another difference, their soup comes out boiling hot.  You may need to blow on your spoon or wait a little while, but as for me, I don't like warm soups, I like them hot.  This place is friendly and parking can be challenging.  But you can always park next door in the Plaza and walk over if they get filled up.

The katsu Donburi was delicious, filing, and surprisingly light of texture. What is usually a heavy, greasy dish was instead graced by a light sauce with much impact, workout overshadowing other parts of the dish. It serves as a perfect don, all ingredients working harmoniously. 

The karaage were well seasoned and had perfect texture,mouth feel, and fat content. Crispy outside and moderately chewy meat. I miss fukumimi's seasoning salt mix though. 

No complaints about the cold soba.

What stood out to me the most was the umani ramen. At first, I was apprehensive about the thickness of the mushroom broth, but the compound action of the shiitake, the seafood, the pork, and the compendium of vegetables made every mouthful new and unforgettable.

I really like that this place doesn't nickel-and-dime the hell out of you when it comes to toppings on your ramen. 

Chashu ramen:
the good: four tender, fatty slices of chashu in there, broth not too salty
the meh: egg was overcooked, noodles were not as enjoyable as Monta or Sora. 

I am a super honey toast fan, and I can't say it's my favorite here. Texture-wise it needed more crunch and was missing a little something. Bottom pieces were just a little too cloyingly sweet with the amount of honey on the plate.

Kudos to these guys for the free Yelp check-in app of yakisoba, but it was a little too sweet for me.

Both arrived simultaneously so I went for the gyoza first. The gyoza wrappers were super tender but I found the ratio of cabbage to pork in the filling was too high for my taste. That may be a good thing if you are looking for a healthier gyoza with a softer texture, but I like mine porkier.  I would rate the ramen above average but definitely not in my top rankings.  The chashu was moist and tender and the noodles had a toothsome bite.  But the broth could have been more flavorful and rich.  I don't get to eat ramen often so I want to be hit with some salt and fat.  The egg was hard boiled but I prefer the soft barely-set yolk variety.  

I'd definitely come back to try some other dishes since they were so friendly but I definitely want to try Monta's ramen to compare next time I'm in Vegas.",-DLMAW50HtlHLGruxhFkYg,2,3,4,dxm7aottmqKoZw5iFnrBKw

I feel like this is a hidden gem (for now), because there's other places like Ramen Sora & Monta Ramen that are almost ALWAYS packed and crammed with their parking situation not being the greatest either. I'm glad this place isn't at the point yet because sometimes I just want a good bowl of ramen without having to write my name down after 8434984 people ahead of me.

The menu is more extensive then other ramen places because they also serve other hot meals. They also have various ramen broths to choose from. Personally, I really enjoyed the ramen omelette. I like to order with extra charsu slices for my meat fix. I like how they have more than just a few broth options cuz sometimes I get tired of miso, shoyu, and tonkatsu :p The charsu slices are nice and big too unlike Monta where I take like 2 bites and I'm out of meat already :( & the broth and ramen itself are very flavorful.

Upon arrival, we were greeted and led to our table. I like the interior - had a very informal but authentic Japanese coziness. Next we ordered the edamame and seaweed salad to start then ordered the ramen.

Food - 8/10. The edamame was delicious (but I'm not sure how you could mess that up anyway). I took off some ratings because I wasn't so fond of the seaweed salad. I am a huge fan of seaweed salads but for some reason did not like the way this tasted. I can't put my finger on it, but there was just something 'off' about it. Wouldn't order it again if I came back. Our main course, the ramen, was good. I ordered the Shoyu ramen and it was very fulfilling. The broth was great - not too salty, not too tasteless.

The first night, on a Friday night, the place was packed, and we had to wait about 20 minutes for a table. The next day, a Saturday, we had no wait but the place was full.  So all the talk about the place being unknown is NO LONGER the case.  

My husband had the charshu ramen with extra charshu on the first night, and he said it was out of this world.  He eats ramen frequently.  I had the umani ramen, which is some squid, a shrimp, pork, in an extremely delicious savory broth.  Super yum.  The second night, my husband had shio ramen, and I had the tanmen ramen; both were much milder than the ramen we had the previous night, but also good.  I think the tanmen broth is mostly chicken broth, and therefore familiar to my palate, and might be well-suited to a ramen newbie.  Also the tanmen is chock full of veggies, which is great.  However, the umani is def my favorite.  The dishes are about $10 each.

Expect to wait for your ramen, and the soups do not necessarily come out at the same time.  On the first night, there was at least 12 minutes between my husband's soup service and mine.  That's pretty poo.

Upon entering on a Wednesday evening around 7ish, it was nearly empty. A nice lady escorted us towards the back to a booth. The menu was packed with pictures of different types of ramen but with no description. Instead of staring at the menu and asking a million questions, we went with something familiar:

Japanese Won Ton Ramen: great broth, chewy noodles and tasty won tons. Really hit the spot. 
Miso Ramen: this place has absolutely the most tender slices of pork I have EVER had. The texture was almost like eating fat, where it just melts in your mouth, but it's actually lean pork. The broth was a bit on the salty side but overall, still great.
Thai iced tea, BOGO @ $3. tastes like all others from other places. 

We were happy to see they had a lot more business when we left. The service was absolutely perfect. They are so friendly and hospitable.

This is definitely a local's spot nestled in between foot spas and tea stores, but I promise it doesn't disappoint. 

Ramen goes really good with beer, so of course I asked the server for a glass of Sapporo. She asked me, ""is frozen beer okay?"" I was so confused. ""Did she mean a frozen glass? Did they forget to take the beer out of the freezer and now it's seconds away from combustion?"" I didn't think I heard her correctly so just smiled and said ok.

Included are green onion and zasai.  Overall, it's not to die for and is nothing beyond ordinary. For $10.95, it's over priced for the quality.

The shoyu ramen is better, but not by much.  It's a bit light on the flavor.  Same noodle, menma, white boiled egg, and same noodles.  For $7.50, it's ok.

Food: HUGE proportions. Working at a restaurant myself, I know when restaurants cheat off their food. While I didn't order there ramen, I was extremely pleased with there curry! The food actually had real chicken breasts. Best part of all? At max 10 minutes for such an amazingly large proportion! Big enough to satisfy bodybuilders too! :) 

Atmosphere: Authentic Japanese vibe and such a clean interior! Bathrooms are obviously monitored almost after every use! I was very shocked with the conditions of the entire restaurant. Plus the music isn't so loud and it helps a lot because the servers are always in sight! 

Service: outstanding service! Not only are they extremely friendly but they always remain extremely professional. They knew when to have humor and when it's time to order, they get down to business. Overall, i have recommended this location to all my friends and family. Thank you so much Yagyu! You never fail to please!

P.s ask about the coupons! On Tuesdays they give a great deal for a free appetizer with a number of visits than any other days!",sYhayoonnMu2wDFmKeWEjQ,2,0,5,-TL_-nIoqUdiIw4oXhlHcQ

5278665,2016-11-12,0,5yZ1XmDcOEsElDeb9PlPDQ,Miso Ramen ($8.95) was the only food I had here. i am a big fan of Japanese ramen. This miso ramen was the worst one I had in my life. The broth was too light and the noodle was too over cooked with zero firmness. Their menu is disorganized. They need a lot of improvement.

5518167,2016-10-30,6,5yZ1XmDcOEsElDeb9PlPDQ,"This place is just meh. These are the words that many reviewers, as well as I, have chosen to describe Yagyu Ramen. 

It wasn't one particular order that left me with a bad taste in my mouth, nor was it any order at all. It also wasn't the service for the day, as I didn't necessarily see any problems with my waitress (aside from the fact that it seemed like she was hurrying me to finish my meal). It was just all average, I guess. 

My order consisted of my usual go-to miso ramen w/ boiled egg and butter, an iced tea, and a free check-in edamame. My S/O ordered similarly to mine, except he changed his bowl to the Tenshin Ramen. 

I guess the broth didn't quite suit to my tastes. While some may not like their ramen oversalted, I do not like my broth under salted, as the point of a miso ramen is to be higher in sodium than other broths. I had to add quite a bit of soy sauce and chili spice to get a flavor that met my match. Of course, it may just be my particular tastes that was in the minority, but my S/O told me that his broth was also quite boring. 

The takoyaki wasn't as flavorful as I hoped, but the octopus inside was chewy!

While eating, I felt rushed by the waitress there. She tried taking away my bowl, thinking I was done, when I still wanted to finish the rest of the broth. She did the same thing when I wanted to look at the menu again while she thought I was ready to pay.  :/

Don't think I'll be coming back.",9E_LCRdvbhUAEgXa8VpGYg,7,7,3,cv2ybta-K2jf2n7XJam5iQ

Great selection of ramen as well as other dishes including the curry and stir fried dishes.  I used to get the beef bowl when it was special priced, an excellent deal in my opinion.  Usually get the gyoza which is consistent.  My favs include the tempura udon, miso yasai ramen and gyoza.  Menu can be confusing as the pictures don't clearly show what is in the dishes or say what's in them.  That's my only knock for this place.",hYjzYrSRNwHif4v2RTvAlg,1,0,4,jWqYi05gg5CBCG-HNXf6PA

5707240,2016-03-23,3,5yZ1XmDcOEsElDeb9PlPDQ,"If you're looking to get away from the Las Vegas Strip for a place that is fast and affordable, this is the place.  This ramen house is located less than 2 miles from the Strip, down the street from the Palazzo / Wynn hotel off Spring Mountain in an extremely busy Asian strip mall. 

We arrived a little after 6:30 PM on a Monday evening. There were a few tables occupied, and we were seated in a booth in the front. If you check in on yelp, you can get an free appetizer side of yakisoba. It's a tiny little plate, but hey, it's free!

The menu isn't just ramen, but has a little bit of everything, from other noodles like udon adn yakisoba, to rice bowls, to curry, to grilled items like fish or chicken. 

Since their business name says Ramen, I decided to stick with cha siu (roast pork) Ramen as my choice, which came with a 1/2 egg, bamboo shoots, nori, and I added corn and bean sprouts to my order. I was given 4 generous slices of pork. Karen even commented that the slices were thicker than the usual places we go to.

I read mix comments about the broth, and I personally felt it was fine. It was not extremely salty, which I was thankful for as I didn't feel like drinking water all night. It tasted like it was chicken / pork stock.  

Karen had the shoyu Ramen, which came with two slices of pork, bamboo shoots and an egg. Stephen didn't feel like noodles, and did not know what to get, so I suggested for him to get the beef bowl. It was a very generous bowl and the meat was marinated just right. Not too sweet, and it look like they use sukiyaki style beef. The beef bowl also came with salad and a bowl of miso soup. 

Overall a very inexpensive dinner for three people, less than $30. Aside from the terrible parking, I would recommend this place if you're looking for cheap eats away from the Las Vegas strip. If you find a parking spot, grab it. Customers don't know how to navigate around this congested strip mall, and will do anything for a parking spot, including driving the wrong way.",cKJ0r01eF7E-tYp2FQOyRA,10,6,4,QlEJZ6oaIfamWk4nSb8iBg

Customer service 4/5

I love the food here. We ordered a miso ramen and shoyu ramen, as well as a gyoza just to compare to other ramen places. Their gyoza is housemade, and tastes like it. Absolutely delicious. For the miso ramen, the serving size is a little bit bigger than other ramen places, honestly not the best tasting ramen I've had, but it's still pretty good. 
The servers are nice. Only complaint is I see them talking to each other most of the time instead of customers. When we were here it was slow so it's not too big of a deal. 
Good place, I'd rate it a 4.5 star place, but since I like this place I'll give it 5. They might need better pictures on their menus though!",fcra9uhtCHmpXdhDamb5cg,2,1,5,Lm1889K_LgMMQF4oYwRMfg
