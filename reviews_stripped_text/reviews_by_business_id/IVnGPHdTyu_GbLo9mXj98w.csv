152362,2013-06-30,2,IVnGPHdTyu_GbLo9mXj98w,"As a tonkotsu ramen aficionado, I'm constantly on the lookout for the next great ramen-ya, especially one that can rival the best in LA, or dare to dream, the ones in Hakata, Fukuoka, Japan. It was with great excitement that I noticed their preopening announcement, and we set out to try them for a weekend lunch. Upon entering the restaurant, we noted a clean Spartan aesthetic but the wooden benches were quite hard and mildly uncomfortable. The menu was simple and straightforward. We asked the waitress what the Tatsu ramen was, and she explained it is their tonkotsu with additional chashu (6 vs 2 pieces). We went ahead and ordered the tonkotsu ($7.77) and Tatsu ($10.77) ramen. Our bowls came out quickly and were accompanied by seaweed, ginger, a tiny bit of green onion and sesame, but no egg. Surprisingly, there didn't seem to be an option to add an egg, or other accompaniments, i.e. additional green onion, corn, etc. Interestingly, the shio and shoyu versions appear to come with an egg though.

While it looked promising initially with the proper thin white ramen noodles, our experience was underwhelming. First off, the noodles were overcooked and not al dente or firm enough. While the amount of noodles was adequate, the amount of broth was on the skimpy side and could have been served hotter. (Usually the better ramen joints serve their broth piping hot so that it is still plenty warm by the time you're finishing your meal.) The porky flavor and richness of the broth was ok but not something you would want to slurp up every last drop of. The chashu was not quite tender enough, a bit too fatty (that I was compelled to pick off the fatty parts), and somewhat bland at the same time. It was also odd that when I asked for shichimi togarashi (Japanese chili powder and a classic condiment), they only had chili oil available.

In the end, Ramen Tatsu was just okay for us. It is better than much of the local competition, but doesn't induce any cravings to return.",LkWNo83Lg92C5V4JEyxOZA,4,1,3,1HFJE52p68dCg6QItitJXw

Soup taste and the noodle firmness is just right.  Nothing fancy or unique about it but my wife and I both love Tatsu for the soup taste and their noodle.
Everytime the ramen is cooked right.

My second choice is Misoya Tomi for very unique and tasty miso ramens and third will be Yagyu (really at home taste for most Japanese, just make sure you order the noodle firm so they don't over cook).",dAHHIffJUdiOUkK7dpimVA,0,0,5,2J85XInHC8uYaiE2DPblsw

While he enjoyed his meal, I thought mine had much to be desired. The chashu was a bit chewy, tough, and lacked flavor, and while the tonkotsu broth appeared creamy, it didn't really taste rich. It was somewhat reminiscent of Anime Ramen's tonkotsu and thats no compliment. The thin noodles and egg were fine, nothing bad to say.

The second time we visited, we both ordered plain miso ramen. The broth was very tangy and tasted rather thin. The thicker curlier noodles served with it were harder (not cooked long enough?) than I would've enjoyed. The chashu, again, was disappointing. 

The service was good - it was just two waiters standing towards the back and watching the second anyone needed anything, seeing as how they recently opened, so I feel a bit bad giving them three stars. I think they'll get steady business regardless, however, since they're in a strip mall that also has that karaoke place and Cue D's.",dAVGTSsykWzKZHTp3yU_xA,0,0,3,m_xDwZkHLBrmPhUsaPaCBg

When I lived in CA I would travel from the Bay Area to Sacramento for Shoki House (their first location), and sometimes to New Tokyo Ramen in Marina, but Ramen Tatsu is awesome. So happy this place is local for me. 
I heard about a few other ramen places in town that people rave about, but the wait times were long, service below average and the ramen tasted like it was quickly prepared and lacked anything that made it stand out. 
Ramen Tatsu takes care of you. 

Friendly staff. 
Been here 5 times now and will continue to come. I don't think they've remembered me yet but each time they're kind, attentive and generous. This place has even given us some of their iced green tea to take home and catered to our 'not a lot of time but really wanted ramen' needs when we needed to rush an order. They rushed it right through by serving two cups of our tea, the check right after food and our second order of noodle right on time while still keeping is from feeling like we were being a bother or like we were just a quick dollar for them. 

Great food. 
Again, top notch ramen in Vegas.
Maybe the 'other' ramen joint that people rave about (starts with an M;) was great in the past, but the last few times I've gone it's been average/good, not great and definitely not as good as Ramen Tatsu.

I've narrowed my go-to bowl as the Shoyu with an extra egg and extra noodle mid way through. My girlfriend enjoys the Spicy Tonkotsu with an egg. It's definitely spicy. Two scoops of hers on my Shoyu change things up enough for me. 
She's had to extra spicy miso too, but enjoys the Tonkotsu more so. 

Price is awesome. We both eat for less than $30 and that includes extra noodles, extra eggs, edemame, two iced green teas (these are delicious), and green tea mochi ice cream. All on top of our two bowls of ramen. 

All in all, I rank it up their for Ramen joints.

587657,2015-01-31,0,IVnGPHdTyu_GbLo9mXj98w,"Short: Decent food, good prices, but didn't leave me super happy.

The long:

Have been meaning to hit this place for a while after seeing pretty good reviews. Arrived and was greeted warmly and told to sit anywhere. The place is littered with their ""Happy Hour"" special and a ad to add extra noodles. Otherwise the place is rather bland for a ramen shop; can't complain. 

I was hungry, so I ordered the Deluxe ramen which has extra chashu (roasted pork slices), cabbage, bean sprouts, eggs, and corn on top of the normal toppings. Shoyu (soy sauce) broth with thinker noodles. Then I ordered a serving of karaage and (a surprise!) takoyaki. For $3 on happy hour for the sides, I wasn't expecting the amount of food I'd get for the sides; the karaage was a meal on its own with the chicken and side salad, and the takoyaki was small but had enough of them to feel worth it. Both were fine, not amazing. I've had better karaage at Fukumimi ramen. and better takoyaki at festivals, but not bad for the price.

As for the ramen: It's the worse I've had. I'm grading it against Monta and Sora ramen, so it's not terrible, but just doesn't make me rave. The broth isn't very complex and lacks punch. The chashu, while there was a lot, isn't very flavorful. The rest of the toppings on the ramen were simple and easy to add, but they didn't make this bowl feel like a ""Deluxe"" special from a ramen shop, more so a hodgepodge of toppings on decent ramen. 

In the end, I left this place stuffed and content, but not very happy. The service is good, the prices are decent (Happy hour sides are great), the food is just lacking in overall flavor and depth. 

I'll try this place again, but I suggest either Monta, Sora, Fukumimi, or Misoya Tomi ramen first.",kBoCLXsjzpSTpOKC9J6FUg,1,1,3,wHFhb-y_oUgy7uUhFvEmUQ

The Japanese lady who took our order is so cute and attentive. If you check in on yelp you can get a free drink, ice green tea included. 

They have many variety of ramens, just like other ramen places. The pork is perfect in between Monta and Sora. I always think the pork at sora is too big and fatty, and pork at Monta is too thin and a bit stingy. Pork here is perfect size and they have regular size noodles and thin noodles, just depends on what type of ramen you get. And their egg is perfectly cooked. The yoke is to perfection.

I've had the shoyu ramen and the spicy miso, I've also tried (a spoonful) of the Tonkotsu and Shio.  My favorite was the shoyu, the flavor was there, more subtle not salty.  Noodles are al dente and according to one of the waiters they are fresh made daily some place in California.  If we are to compare to the other Vegas notorious ramen place, I feel Monta's broth has become too diluted and salty for me. But Ramen Tatsu does feel a lot like Monta, if fact the chef seems to be the old one from Monta.  The cut of pork is thicker here and less marbled fat which I like.  Good, very friendly service.  Pleasant space to sit down and enjoy dinner, maybe not so much the style of a fast food bustling traditional Japanese ramen, but I like enjoying my beers while I eat and I don't mind this lack of authenticity.

Deluxe bowl comes decked out with all of the extra veggies and meat: four slices of chashu, nori, an egg, green onion, sprouts, corn, cabbage, and bamboo shoots. Also added on orders of edamame, karaage, and lychee sorbet.

Broth was understated but still had good depth, and the various toppings and giant bowl made it a more than generous portion for two, well-priced at just under $11. Egg was a little overcooked, which is  a ramen pet peeve of mine and I also didn't care for the corn or overwhelming amount of cabbage. 

Karaage was moist and I really enjoyed the light breading. Squeezed some lemon over it for an extra perk of acidity.  Sorbet was a great palate cleanser with a pop of flavor, larger portion than what is given gratis at Ramen Misoya Tomi.

Sure, that goes for any delicious soup out there, but some of my friends think I'm weird eating hot soup on a hot summer day. I went to a place once and they only serve ramen during the winter season - Boo!

My favorite broth here is their tonkotsu infused with shoyu. Love this savory and somewhat creamy broth without being too salty. What a wonderful option that I am able to choose thin or thick noodles with my soup. They give you good portions of noodles unlike other places that skimp on it. Depending on the soup you order, it comes with basic toppings and add ons are extra charge.

I'm not sure if I come here because of their soup or because they have one tasty fried rice and chicken karage that pair well together. I love the condiments on the table which add flavor to the chicken karage as a dipping sauce. 

The service here is always excellent even when it's usually one gal working solo in the dining area. The older lady is my favorite server. She's cute and always has positive energy when she's serving my table. I love how this place is so warm and inviting! I like seeing the wall decor they put up and the dark wood throughout adds warmth. 

This place also has a family friendly atmosphere compared to other ramen joints where lots of hipsters hang out and therefore tends to be noisy.

I'm not really a fan of spicy food, but my friends are and they said that the soup was really spicy but edible so be wary. Better to have it regular and add your own level of spice. Overall price was adequate for quality and amount of food. Everything was served hot and fresh. The service was provided by the owner herself, she was friendly and quick to refill drinks and check in on us. We came during the happy hour special which starts at 3pm. It wasn't too busy, which made it a perfect spot for my girls and I to chat. The environment was clean and open.

Yes, Yes and Yes.

Tatsu is totally underrated. They deserve way better rating than 3.5 - thus 5 stars to help bump up the rating.

To me, Tatsu comes close to Monta, Sora and Fukumimi (and Shoku, for that matter), if not better. And so far, tsukemen (with authentic, special thick noodle!) is only available at Tatsu (except Hiromaru but don't count).

If you haven't, try the deluxe ramen - it's a tasting menu for their ramen. Also, fried rice and gyoza are pretty good too.

If you tried a long ago before the ownership fuss, give them a second chance.

My wife has more unforgiving tastes than myself (looking at you, Guy Savoy), but she approves Tatsu too. Consider this review two votes.

My biggest gripe is that this place does not like to do any accommodations for customers. When we sat down , we wanted to order tonkastu ramen but the waitress told us they have been out of it which was kinda inconvenient , they should have put a sign on their door that said they're out of it since it's a popular menu choice & we waited so long to get tonkatsu ramen in mind. I asked the waitress if I can switch out the tonkatsu broth w/ miso broth instead and she said no but I can order their miso ramen. My issue w/ ordering their miso ramen is that it has corn and bean sprouts in it which makes the broth taste terrible (mainly just the bean sprouts w/ my experience at Fukumimi) & I just cared about getting pork, mushrooms and broth I like for my ramen. I asked if it's possible to switch out the corn and bean sprouts for different toppings. At first the waitress said no they can't do that but she can just remove those two toppings (and I will still be paying same price). She also suggested that I could order the shio or shoyu ramen since those don't have corn or bean sprouts in it like the miso ramen. However , I prefer heavier broths like tonkatsu or miso. I showed her on their menu the toppings I wanted to be substituted is pretty much almost the same price as corn and bean sprouts so she finally she agreed to doing my order after I asked and mentioned that twice.

Food came out quick which was the only good thing for waiting so long. All the toppings were really cold. I tried some of my boyfriend's shoyu which didn't taste good at all , thankfully their miso wasn't bad. So glad I didn't go w/ waitress' recommendation to order shoyu. Other ramen places have chili paste or spice seasonings on the table available but this place charges you extra.",qtOCfMTrozmUSHWIcohc6Q,2,0,2,Mq0GS4mfQCKvdkWhlgVMdw

Broth wasn't thick and flavorful... If you cook and reduce the broth with the bones you would get more flavor, but it seems like they've just added more salt..

The noodles were broken and too hard. Tsukemen noodles should be soft, chewy and long. With the thickness of the broth and the texture of the noodles, the broth should really stick unto the noodle when consuming.

If you're ever in LA, go to Tsujita Annex and you'll know exactly what I'm talking about. 

Just go with the miso ramen at this spot.. Or just go to LA.. Haha

We usually stop by the Asian BBQ restaurant next door but since it was closed for vacation we decided to come here. I'm glad we did! The Ramen were full of flavors where you know they have been boiling that pork bone for a long time! That was makes a true Ramen and not bland and make it up with lots of salt and MSG etc. Cost was very descent compared to many generic Ramen places. For the taste and flavors in this place, its more worth paying a little bit more anyway for the amount of time it takes to make the soup taste that way. The portion of kimchi fried rice we ordered was a bit small for the price we paid. Flavor was good but nothing to rave about. Has a bit of sour flavor too due to the Kimchi which was meh. Will think twice before ordering that again though. I would just stick with the Ramen. Haven't tried the other stuff though. 

Service:
The one and only lady I see working works like a champ! The place is small but enough capacity where I think it will really help to have 2 people. She took orders, brought your food, refill waters without you even asking and get your check. Even with all that by herself, she was still quick at her service. Wow! It wasn't until toward the end, we saw another lady walked out to help. I hope she was just taking a little break because otherwise, the heck you will leave a partner in chaos by herself?

Ambiance:
Cute little place with the generic Japanese theme. Not much decor but enough to get the idea your at a Japanese restaurant. Place is clean and AC was good enough to bring the mood to eat hot soupy Ramen at 105F outside!",qpActPt-ts9RRiZvn0n2KA,0,0,4,cjqeU0tOc5yzBDDgff2pMw

So when we got in we noticed tsukemen wasn't anywhere on the menu. The waitress told us that when they received the noodles for the tsukemen it was the wrong kind and will be another month of so till they the new noodles. Not sure what rake so long to get different noodles. 

So we decided to just try the regular ramen and it was full of disappointment. May have been the worst ramen I had. 

We ordered the smoked chasu to share and I got the Tonkatsu shoyu ramen with garlic chip and egg add-ons. 

Smoked chasu was very flavorful and delicious. Meat quality was decent and the spicy sauce and the garlic on the side was a nice addition. Now on to the ramen. 

The broth - very light, kind of bland, and had a weird aftertaste. 

Noodles -  wasn't bad, wasn't great. I prefer the thinner noodles for Tonkatsu shoyu normally but decided to try it with thick since that is what they normally serve with this ramen

Chasu - the chasu in the ramen is of worse quality than the smoked chasu. It is probably some of the worst chasu I have had in ramen. Just looking at it you can tell the meat is of subpar quality. 

Garlic chips - I liked the crunchiness of the chips, but seemed a little overcooked to me.

My ramen obviously became expensive now.. Extra cost for extra spicy and chashu.  This bowl of soup better be worth it. 

After several slurps, the spiciness  began to kick in.  Very good tasting broth, but I did not feel like it was anything special.  The spiciness was only a tad more than the regular.  The thick noodles were a nice change since we are used to getting thin types at the other places.

Service was excellent since our waitress was consistently coming around to see if we were doing okay.  

Overall, this place is not bad in my book.  It just that there are plenty of ramen houses in this area.",yobIvoK2taIhooUPSrjuiQ,2,0,3,w21JH0vDq49_Vf9Iw4ob8w
2150552,2013-06-30,4,IVnGPHdTyu_GbLo9mXj98w,"The Skinny: at the end of the meal, I had a half filled bowl of broth - 'nuff said (3), service: efficient and fast (3); value: it's okay - not too pricey for a bowl of okay ramen... but nothing that I feel like I need to return for (3 stars).

When we saw the signs for a new ramen joint opening up in the Chinatown area, we were stoked. We love ramen - tonkotsu ramen in particular - and we were very interested to find a ramen joint that serves the traditional thinner white noodles with their tonkotsu broth.

We headed over to their soft opening just to see what they had to offer. I believe that their menu is truncated a bit at this time. No matter - we decided to hit up their Tonkotsu ramen ($7.77, 2 pc chasu, green onion, ginger and woodear mushroom) and their Ramen Tatsu (basically a tonkotsu ramen with more chasu and in bigger bowl of noodles).

Okay, let me get this straight. Ramen for me is all about the broth. That is the most difficult part to get right and where all the flavor comes from in your bowl. If I am leaving a bowl of ramen with at least half a bowl of broth behind, that says something - it just ain't that good. The tonkotsu broth didn't have the luxurious porky depth that it needs to really distinguish itself from other ramen joints in the city.

On to the rest of the bowl. The chasu in the bowl didn't really have much of a marinated flavor with it and rendered it a bit bland. The noodles - although they were the legit kind - were a little too soft for my taste. I would also venture to say, the bright pink ginger topping should be left to the side instead of incorporated in the bowl. I was also a little sad that the wasn't the option of adding an egg to your bowl. Perhaps this oversight will be corrected after the soft opening.

Another thing of note was they did not have togarashi to go with the ramen - only the chili oil. As my hubs is a total togarashi fanboy, he was verily disappointed.

Service is quick and efficient. I believe we were in and out within half and hour.

Overall, in the big scheme of things, Ramen Tatsu is alright. However based on the offerings today, I don't feel a huge urge to return again soon.(3 starred review).",h9RUaaHa5kcQKqtJ-sgS0Q,7,4,3,p2c5_ACXMCVc20Zuf8ihSg

Tonight, was one of the saddest eating experiences of my life.  I took like 9 bites and just couldn't eat anymore because I disliked it so much.  I got the tonkotsu shoyo.   Just something about the broth tasted so bad to me.  Like something in my brain telling me that I shouldn't be eating it.   But every other review seems to think it's fantastic.  The meat in it was okay.   And I'm sure their noodles are prepared correctly but they were too hard for my taste.  

Price was reasonable at $7.77 but my mouth is in a state of morning.

There are many options on the menu, including rice bowls. We ordered the deluxe ramen (egg, corn, bean sprouts, cabbage, seaweed, green onion, charsiu, thick noodles) and asked if we could get it with miso broth instead of the tonkotsu broth it usually comes with. Our waitress said yes, but neglected to mention that it was $1 extra. Not a big deal, but it would have been nice to know. The miso broth was okay but nothing to write home about. It tasted a bit watered down to me; I've had stronger, more flavorful miso broth from a packaged ramen from the Asian grocery.  What I did enjoy was the ample amount of vegetables that came with the ramen, as it made for a texturally interesting bowl.

2355612,2015-01-28,0,IVnGPHdTyu_GbLo9mXj98w,"It seems like there's a new ramen place keep popping up in Vegas lately.  ""Ramen Tatsu"" has been around for about couple of years now, and my recent visit was my first time there.  I had a Japanese buddy of mine from San Francisco Bay Area visiting during the CES convention, and we usually go to a ramen place at least once during his visit.  This time we went to Tatsu and we were very pleased.  My buddy's name is ""Tetsu"" so, I remembered to go to ""Tatsu.""

We started with some beer and chicken kara-age (Japanese style chicken nuggets) and some pot stickers.  The pot stickers were good, but, no different than any other good ramen places. I can probably pan fry those pot stickers a little better than they can.  Kara-age was crispy outside and moist inside.  Perfect!  That shows me they're very good in deep frying.

Then we ordered our main.  My buddy ordered the ""Tsukemen""  It's a thick ramen that almost look like udon noodles which comes with two types of dipping sauce.  I'm not much of a fan of eating ramen dipping it in a sauce.  I'd rather do that with a cold udon or soba.  However, those dipping sauces were delicious.  I ordered the Deluxe ramen that comes with extra slices of  cha-shu.  I can tell the cha-shu is home made, and sliced thicker than you usually see at a ramen place.  Those cha-shu were very tender and flavorful with not too much fat.  The noodle was firm and very well done, the way I like it.  Toppings were similar to the stuff I use when I make my own ramen, so, not surprised there.  Tonkotsu-Shoyu (Soy sauce based pork broth) soup was also, excellent.  Very rich broth, not oily, nor salty.  Very authentic Japanese ramen soup.  Tonkotsu-Shoyu ramen originated in Yokoyama (Kanagawa Prefecture) and, has been popular in the Kanto region (Seven eastern prefectures including Tokyo).  Tonkotsu (pork bone) ramen is basically, a traditional ramen in Kyushu.  It's like a mixture of both, Shoyu ramen of Kanto with tonkotsu ramen of Kyushu.  Tonkotsu-Shoyu ramen noodles are the regular curly ramen noodles rather than the straight thin type normally used in the Kyushu or ""Hakata style"" ramen.

On the scale of 1 to 10, I would give this ramen a 9.  It would've been a 10 if the cha-shu was properly seared on the outside.  The word ""cha-"" of ""cha-shu"" comes from the Chinese ""chaasiu"" or ""char siu"" which means ""barbequed"" or ""seared"" pork.  Obviously, ramen was invented by a Chinese cook in Japan, unclear of when, but, some historians say about 350 years ago; hence it uses the naming from Chinese words, and uses both Chinese and Japanese style of cooking.  At least I know it's been around for more than a century, and became popular in the 1950s.

Now I've got a place to go for Tonkotsu-Shoyu ramen!",UW7AAceO7uxwyLisyjtNxA,0,0,4,uc1-Z1EIElLoBTzA4VfTCA

They have the perfect level of richness and creaminess without it being too overwhelming and the broth isn't overly salty. Their curry is also pretty tasty and very filling.

I guess you can say I've been spoiled with ramen from LA and SF, so my expectations were pretty high for Ramen Tatsu. Maybe I came in on an off day because I certainly did not experience their 4.5 star reputation on yelp. The tonkatsu broth was the slightest bit tasty and wasn't fatty enough for my taste. The ramen, although generous in portion, was not al-dente but soggy as if it had been sitting in the bottom of the bowl for hours. The toppings didn't come with much: mound of green onions, two slices of cha siu,  and wood ear. I added my own egg, which was probably my favorite part of the ramen.

Nonetheless, the service was great! Green tea was perfect for a rainy night and to soothe my throat. I probably won't be coming here again with Jinya only a short drive away.",g_4zySOI_HisK5rG_2dw6Q,8,3,3,zXNdo4pvV1MqH6Hg214ebw

My recent visit I actually ordered Tsukemen. I don't believe I have ever tried tsukemen before, so I don't have anything to compare it to, but I was pleasantly surprised with my order.
With tsukemen, your noodles come out on the side, and you dip the noodles into a broth that's thicker and more flavorful than regular ramen broth. 
They allow you to order 3x or more noodles servings for just a few bucks more; I went with 2x.
Noodles are thicker than typical ramen and very chewy which I normally don't like for ramen, but went very well with tsukemen. Toppings included the standard chashu, egg, etc., and a wedge of lime.
There seems to be only one kind of broth for the tsukemen, which I believe was tonokotsu shoyu with bonito.

The ramen broth is cooked long and slow in a slew of veggies and bone broth so that it is nice and creamy. The noodles are the right consistency that slurp right off your spoon to your mouth.

This one is tonkotsu yes, but the broth isn't as thick and relentless as you tonkotsuites may be used to. Def recommend getting the deluxe as you get 4 pieces of chashu, a full egg, kikurage, negi (green onions), and noodles. The only downside is the soup isn't very hot. I usually like it when the broth comes in piping hot.

Also got a side of gyoza. The gyoza is delicious, however it is super garlicky so expect to bring some breath mints with you at the very least. Or don't eat it at all before heading out to the strip. Unless you like honey badger and you don't care. Got the Karaage as well. My mom and I both thought it would be a chicken drumstick as advertised in the picture but alas no, it wasn't.

No matter how careful I am, I end up wearing some of my lunch. It was worth it, though, to try their tonkotsu ramen ($7.77). While it wasn't as creamy as I'd like -- the broth was thinner and more diluted -- the pork flavor was hearty. I'm not a fan of the really thin noodles, which were too al dente, but the tender pork with its rendered fat made up for it. The slivers of fat provided an excellent burst of flavor with each bite.

They should totally have this option for toppings. The noodles were thinner in the tonkatsu but I didn't mind it. You probably can request the thicker noodles. A nice plus is that you can get a refill of noodles (kaedama) for only $1.50.

I don't know why it's taken me forever and a day to eat here. Usually when I go to a ramen place, I measure them by their gyoza and their miso ramen. I actually haven't tried the miso ramen yet here because I've been getting their delicious tsukemen! Their version has a strong fish flavor and reminded me of David Chang's Mind of A Chef where he looks into making bonito in Japan. Their egg is perfectly soft-boiled and the chasu served cold is thick and full of flavor. The noodles are extra thick, firm, and flatter than your normal ramen noodle in order to increase surface area for dipping. My husband has ordered the tonkatsu shoyu, which also has a fishy taste. He enjoyed it and his leftovers were still delicious the next day, which I attribute to the noodles holding up very well. As far as sides go, the gyoza meat was a bit dry, so I probably wouldn't order that again, but the curry rice and the side salad are satisfying and filling. The kimchi fried rice isn't too spicy, which I liked, but may be a turn-off for those who want kimchi fried rice from a Korean restaurant. Their iced green tea is not canned or bottled, which is an extra plus for me. It's only $1.77 too with free refills! (a lot of their pricing ends in .77 cents). To top it all off, they have two TVs that are angled strategically for maximum viewing pleasure and the servers here handle their business efficiently and are very helpful/friendly.

Ate here a couple times and both visits were cuz I had a cold.  Normally hot chicken soup with hearty veggies will comfort me.  That's a saying...  Something about their ramen here will do the job just as well.  Those garlic chips!  I know garlic is great for high blood pressure and colds.

Can't say this is the absolute remedy for feeling under the weather.  But my ear was clogged up for three days and the head cold was just hanging out.  It needs to leave.  Ramen Tatsu to the rescue!  In the morning, my ear finally drained.  I can hear!

This is just my take on their soup.  I do love it.  It's affordable and tastes really good.  I don't leave leftovers.  I have my fave ingredients for my cold remedy I suppose.  It works so I'll stick with it.  How's that?  :)",JQIZhoQB-Tg9hdBEj90m4g,53,53,4,vlgbXdOO-HXPNwe2lnhrJA

Anyhow this delicious bowl was quite filling and flavorful as well as a good value for the money.  I went for the Tonkatsu Shoyu Deluxe(~$11).  The broth and noodles was also strong like a virile Siberian Husky in Siberia leading a Siberian Husky Sled team over the frozen tundra of Siberia with a heavy set Siberian Eskimo on board.

After a hard day of 'rastling boulders at Krafts in Red Rock nothing hits the spot after a cold day like Ramen. You don't want Pho, you want Ramen made by the gentle hands of an older Japanese woman slaving away in the back kitchen or a stocky hispanic guy name Enrique (same thing).

When we arrived, the restaurant was surprisingly empty on a Saturday around dinnertime, but it was nice having the place to ourselves. I ordered the Tonkotsu and my boyfriend ordered the Spicy Miso. By the way, the marinated soft boiled egg doesn't come with the ramen. It's an additional $1 charge for an item commonly free at other ramen restaurants. 

Tonkotsu Ramen - The broth had a meaty flavor. Noodles were firm, thin, and cooked well. Pork was fatty, fat, fat. The green onions were on the heavy side.

Spicy Miso - Unless you want to feel more heat, there's no need for additional red pepper. If you've had the spicy miso at Jinya, this is comparable to theirs. 

Being the only diners in the restaurant, service was quick and we received our hot bowls of ramen in an instant.

I've wanted to try a new ramen place, since Monta is always packed and has wait times over 45mins. I found this place with the help of some yelpers. I decided I can't go wrong with a place that offers ramen and appetizers.

I ordered:
- Takoyaki
- Tonkatsu
- 1 Soyu Ramen (garlic chips and extra chasiu)
- 1 Tonkatsu Ramen (extra chasiu and corn)
- 3 Calpico drinks
- 1 Sprite
total about $40

Since i've only tried Monta and (my moms ramen), I'll be comparing the two (mom already wins). 

I LOVE takoyaki and this place makes it so good, it's crisp on the outside and nice and creamy on the inside. The tonkatsu made with a cabbage salad and the tonkatsu sauce on the side, which was cooked to perfection. The tonkatsu was thick and crispy on the outside with the tender juicy pork on the inside. It was delicious.

When the ramen arrived the noodles were perfect, the soup was super flavorful and didn't need to add additional salt or soy sauce to it. Compared to monta's chasiu, this one is meaty in the middle and melt in your mouth on the sides (which is how it's suppose to be). I didn't enjoy the chasiu at Monta because it was like eating boiled fat (it was slippery, melty, and gooey). 

If you want incredible ramen, come here. The waitress was super friendly and helpful. This small ramen restaurant should be deemed the best. The best thing is, it didn't make my love sick, he got so sick at Monta, he was scared to try Ramen again.",RFIZhrka0gCpiL62M5E93g,1,0,5,VFHIG-MGcHx1mexNdUv0EA

If you're unfamiliar with Tsukemen Ramen, it's popularity has grown over the years, and one of the most notable concept of ramen as a regional style, is that it is undressed and the cold noodles are dipped into an accompanying bowl of fishy, undiluted broth before slurping. do not expect a traditional bowl of ramen swimming in a sea of broth. This makes for a great dish during the hot summer months of Las Vegas. I opted to add a few toppings to my noodles as well.

I just don't feel the magic...  The green onions were the only vibrant add on in my spicy tonkatsu ramen.  The broth itself was good n porky, habanero infusion adds a kick to the tastebuds!  When it comes to any Japanese cuisine, I have come to expect the visual sensations as well as the palate sensations to come together in a harmonious combination of flavor and flair.  I know....sounds like a food snob but truth be told!  Imagine a California roll with no red crab, no green avo, just white rice n black seaweed, still look appetizing?  Back to the ramen, maybe add some red daikon? Shredded carrot? Cucumber leaf?  Fish cake swirly thing? An habanero slice? (no seeds!)  I'm no chef, but I know what looks and tastes good!

Most of the ramen shops are comparable to one another - and by that, I mean either average or below average. The broths just don't cut it and the ingredients are always lacking. We tried Tatsu as an alternative to the jam-packed Sora and Monta and the results were about the same, except without the excessive wait times. The shoyu broth was nothing more than a glorified soy sauce base. The noodles and egg were decent enough, but the cuts of charsiu and lack of anything else was a let down. However, I would argue that there are a couple of benefits of getting your ramen fix at Tatsu. First, the ramen comes out pretty quick (almost too quick, which might explain some of the lacklusterness). Second, checking in on Yelp nets you a free soda.

The service was fantastic. She made sure to clear empty plates but not come around so much that she imposed. She was very polite and always made sure our drinks were filled. 

We visited 430 on a Wednesday and were pleasantly surprised to hear it was still happy hour. Some apps and asahi for $3 each, cant beat that.
I like how on the menu they describe the broth very well.

Shoyu ramen: the broth was well balanced and it wasn't too salty, but still had a light soy sauce flavor. This ramen comes with an egg which was a plus.

Tonkatsu shoyu ramen: basically a milkier version of the shoyu ramen. You can tell they really cooked it with bones so the flavors really come out. 

Takoyaki: a good balance of sauce on top. Usually I burn my tongue on this but it was nice that for once it was served at a temp that didn't hurt.

Small curry rice: served with a side of picked radishes. 'Nuff said.
----but on a real note, I was pretty stoked because I was craving curry and it was at the same standard if you went to just a Japanese curry place.

Gyoza: pretty standard but it felt like there was more than what restaurants usually serve.

All this plus an Asahi for $30. Not too shabby. I'll be back Ramen Tatsu.",ERcsc0YO5CCUbkC8EV2INg,0,0,5,B_UsxmU3uXiK7V5-CJiCTQ

This really is great noodles and pork broth. I hear the owner brings in Sun noodles from Hawaii.  The ramen noodle is thin, soft yet firm, holds its own taste while holding the flavor of the broth very well.  The broth is rich and flavorful.

 I've had the spicy miso ramen, chicken curry, spicy tonkatsu ramen, and tsukemen.  All, very lovely.  I don't say this too often while traveling, this is a must eat if you are looking for ramen worth eating.

If I can just find and review ramen restaurants that serves tsukemen all day every day, that would be awesome.

The service was quick and we were seated right away at the bar. The waitress explained the levels of spiciness to us since we were intrigued. My husband ordered a spicy tsukemen while I ordered it in a mild spiciness. The original basic tsukemen is not spicy at all.

Mild was actually spicier than I thought but still good. However, right away, I noticed the noodles aren't like your usual tsukemen noodle. They just seemed like regular cold cooked ramen noodle? I'm used to the tsukemen noodles being incredibly chewy and chunkier. The tsukemen came with two slices of pork, a seaweed and two soft boiled eggs. No frills and bells and whistles here. 

The broth was good, but much saltier than I anticipated. I did enjoy the flavor, but was overwhelmed by how salty it was.

3945787,2017-02-14,3,IVnGPHdTyu_GbLo9mXj98w,"X marks the spot when it comes to good service, here at Ramen Tatsu. I arrived at opening time this past Sunday (02/12 at 11:30), and was greeted by a young, very bright and enthusiastic female server, who told me I could sit anywhere; I chose the booth closest to the door. 

She immediately placed a full water glass and menu on my table, then went about some other duties. When I was ready to order she magically appeared and efficiently took my order, repeated it back to me for confirmation and whisked away to the back with my menu in tow. All the while, more customers were filing in to the place, and she didn't miss a beat with any of them. 

In good time, she returned with a steaming bowl of miso ramen and a small plate of chahan (I chose regular fried rice over kimchi fried rice). The chahan was decent, with a nice bit of wok flavor (I dropped the left over chahan at my mother's, and she thought it was excellent), and the miso ramen was just what I needed after a couple days of hard driving. The broth was hot, flavorful, with firm noodles, plenty of bean sprouts, corn, green onion and chasshuu. While it wasn't as good as a bowl of Misoya Tomi's miso ramen (they're actually closed now), it was pretty dang good. The highlight of the dish was the chasshuu, with excellent flavor in the lean part, and of course, a lot of flavor on the fatty part, which was plentiful. 

After drinking the bowl dry, I pushed the bowl away and almost immediately after, the server dropped the check at my table, and asked me if I wanted a box for the left overs. When she returned with the box, she parted with a warm/polite ""thank you"". 

The industry needs more servers like her. I hope this server, and many more like her, decide to make it their role in life to do this job, and do it well - especially in small, hole-in-the-wall places like Ramen Tatsu.

This place had high ratings so I brought my ramen partner and drove here. 4.5 stars? Can't go wrong! The interior was very appealing with lots of Christmas decorations for the season. There was one floor person who was seating and serving at least 20 people. Kudos to her.

This ramen spot is in a very busy plaza outside of China town that includes J Karaoke, Chada Thai, District 1, and Chinese BBQ AKA parking sucks on the weekend.

Their menu includes more than just ramen: appetizers, curry, and other Japanese dishes. 

I got their karaage and gyoza to start and for my ramen I chose their deluxe ramen with all the fixings. At $10.99 it was a very reasonable price. This includes 3 slices of chashu, corn, cabbage, and some sort of fungus. Basically I didn't dig the broth. I haven't been to many ramen places to compare: Fukumimi, Monta, Misoya, And Jimya. Personally it just didn't have as much flavor and it just didn't taste good to me. I can see it appealing to certain people but my idea of ramen was not this. The chashu was flavorful, but not fall apart delicious.

As a saving grace their gyoza was extremely delicious. This was a stand out for me. The karaage was pretty good too but nothing to write home about.

First time having Tsukemen Ramen and i really enjoyed it.  I asked the server what's their specialty and was kindly steered to this offering.  It's basically a combination of seafood (mackerel) and pork broth.  Those of you with shellfish allergy don't fret.  You're good, brAh!  

The noodles and soup are served in separate bowls, but it is entirely up to you if you want to marry them, or be a dipper.  Have at it.  I personally recommend being a dipper because well.. it's funner!  Food just taste better when the tone is right.  Whatever it is you choose to do, don't fuck it up. I'd hate to watch you enjoy your second serving!

On its own the stock can be really dense, but perfect when pair with the noodles.  Try not to grab too much noodles as it will really pick up on the intensity of the broth.  Loads of scallions are thrown in the clump of grains and topped off with 2 piece of char-siu, a lemon wedge, and a single strip of nori.  The soup is served NOT hot, yet it is warmer than warm.  A little squeeze of lemon over the noodles and this dish actually became quite refreshing in a way.  Sodium overload?? Ain't nobody got time for that!

If you're a fan of the soba zaru (cold buckwheat noodles) then i think you'll really like Tsukemen Ramen here.

Seared Pork belly was meaty and delish!  Would order again.  Gyoza however was alright.

We also ordered the kaarage and it was seasoned just right, crunchy on the outside and moist on the inside. The mister had the miso ramen with butter and he devoured his bowl.

I can tell them I want my soup less salty, and she'll say ""ok no problem"", had it been another ramen restaurant (whose name start with ""Sxxa"" or ""Mxxxxa""), they will give me a funny look as if I'm trying to make their job difficult.  Their ramen are super yummy too (probably because I customize the soup exactly the way I wanted), NOT once I had a bad service from here.

Ramen Tatsu was recommended by a friend who frequents this place and I have to agree that they offer one of the better tasting ramens in Vegas. The ramen shop is quaint, tightly packed (just like most authentic Japanese ramen houses), and run by very pleasant people. We ordered the spicy tonkotsu, shoyu ramen, takoyaki and kimchi rice and weren't disappointed by the flavors and serving portions. The ramen noodles were cooked perfectly, not soggy nor was it undercooked. The broths were delicious and had very satisfying umami flavorfs. If I had any gripe it would just be the smaller than usual sized takoyakis, which had tastiness that made up for the lack of portions. I'm sure me and wifey will now include this spot as part of our ramen rotations, especially now that our usual go-to places are always packed to the brim.

They seem to be a different style of ramen than to Sora's Sapporo style, yet they are pretty good for the price that they offer.

4255789,2015-04-10,1,IVnGPHdTyu_GbLo9mXj98w,"We've found another favorite ramen place!
We started with appetizers: the Japanese kimchi ( which was more vinegary than the Korean kimchis I've tried),  goes very well with the smoky seared chashu.
Their takoyaki comes in 4 pieces. Most of the takoyakis I've tried in other places have raw dough taste, but the ones here are  flavorful, crunchy on the outside and deliciously creamy inside, I highly recommend this. 
The karaage is crispy, and even though it's fried, it's not greasy at all. The greens and refreshing  dressing that come with it complement the takoyaki & the karaage.
My companion had the Shoyu ramen. The chicken broth was tasty. The egg was cooked well. The noodles were chewy in a good way. The chashu pork was buttery with just the right amount of fat. 
I had the Tonkotsu ramen,which has a delicious smoky broth. It also comes with melts in your mouth chashu. Their ramen servings are huge.  Good enough for 2 people.

Service is fast and efficient. Servers are nice and friendly. Place is clean and inviting. My only wish is that they change the piped in music which rendered horrendous covers of pop music from the likes of Alicia Keys and Colbie Caillat. Other than that, this place is highly recommended.

We walked in and we were the only customers here. By the time we left, however, more people came.

I ordered to tonkotsu shoyu ramen along with one of my friends. They cost $7.77. The other friend got the spicy miso, which was slightly pricier at a little over $8.

The same lady we saw sweeping the front also got us our drinks and took our order. She was really friendly, smiled a lot, and even took our picture for us.

They only have one waiting on all tables and greeting customers to their table. Because of this, service is super slow. You have to wait quite some time to be seated (they don't clean right away after someone leaves), some time for them to take your order, and some time to get your check.  For that -1 star.  With this restaurant being busy and popular especially in this plaza, it would be helpful if they could have one more person working. 

The last visit, the meat and egg really disappointed me. The meat was chewy and not tender and was filled with fat and skin instead of meat.  The soft boiled egg was a bit over cooked as you can see from the yolk. The spoon had black marks on it and was dirty. For that -1 Star. 

For something I initially enjoyed and would've given 5 stars, I was quite disappointed in my last two visits. Nonetheless I will return and hope to see improvements.",-KJ49QVnNHPhzu8wVIS_lQ,0,0,3,HAzKqhAOhN9gi_PVBBBxbg

Came here and had the tonkotsu ramen. Amazing! The broth is better than any place I've been in LA. Rich and full of flavor. 
His chashu is unbelievable. Braised and seared, it's a must try.
The gyoza are mini size, but pack a wallop of flavor.
Karaage chicken come out in huge pieces, very moist with a great crunch. 
His cold ramen with dipping sauces is fantastic, especially the sesame dipping sauce. And it's presented exquisitely. 
Asahi on draft is a huge plus!

I ordered the tonkotsu shoyu and it was average. My boyfriend ordered the katsu curry and it tasted below average. He ordered it knowing it wasn't going to taste authentic because he's not a big fan of ramen, so he didn't have much to choose from. 

Don't get me started on the takoyaki lol.

The reason for the low stars is because of service. We didn't get approached till 10-15 minutes after we sat down. 

On the plus side, I think it's cool that they have more options (like curry) that any other ramen place I've been to.

This place didnt have a wait and we were seated right away. 

Their menu is pretty simple-  ramen choices, some appetizers and rice plates.

The 3 stars is purely for the one of the better curry's i've had. The curry almost reminds me of this meat sauce but curry flavored! They have ground meat in the curry that adds more texture and flavor to the rice plate.

I got the shoyu ramen. The broth is a mix of chicken and pork with a little soy sauce. Toppings are half an egg and green onions, along with 2 pieces of pork. First off, I kinda liked the broth. For some reason, I felt like it's similar to a type of Korean soup base, which I bought from Greenland (I don't know how to say it, its all in Korean characters). The noodles were just okay. I traded off egg with my husband's kikurage (wood ear). He didn't like the kikurage at all, I guess it's an Asian thing. Wood ear was the same everywhere. The meat wasn't as tender as I expected.

We sat at a table where she promptly took our drink orders. We ordered the spicy miso ramen, miso ramen, a large fried rice minus the pork, and a house salad. 

As always, the food did not disappoint. If I could buy a bottle of the dressing they use on their house salad I would. The spicy miso ramen had my co worker sweating it out while I enjoyed my pork free fried rice and salad. Everything was so full of flavor.

Not only do they have excellent ramen that taste amazing and balanced but they have curry, that tastes like its from the gods. They even have a ramen that mixes the curry with shoyu and it tastes so good. My dad says that the taste reminds him of when he was in Japan.

After filling up the gullet at HK Star on Mothers Day, I wanted to get some tonkatsu for the mother in laws to have at her place for dinner.  So I was calling in an order and realized that they were closed on Sundays.

As I was planning to pick up some to go items from Asian BBQ and Noodles, I saw that Ramen Tatsu sign advertising tonkatsu so I decided to give this place a shot:

a.  Where is everyone?  On a prime mothers day Sunday at lunch, the place had, three people.  

b.  Take out - I was ordering take out, so I decided to forego any noodles and went for tonkatsu, tonkatsu with curry and an order of fried rice.

- Fried Rice - Very tasty, a nice firm consistency with great taste and plenty of small bits of meat.  I enjoyed this very much.  Not sure what was all in it as I just ate it all .  Yeah, I did give some to the mother in law, but took some home too.....

- Tonkatsu with Curry - Since this was take away, the tonkatsu was packed separately of the curry.  The tonkatsu was decent, no real wow factor for me, yet it was very edible.  Just not memorable.  the curry is pretty tasty. I like the dark color and the richness of the curry.  There was no veggies in it like carrots or potatoes to give the curry a bit of flavor and excitement.  It was just curry.

The food as I said was decent, just not anything memorable. The packaging of the take out was good, separating the curry from everything, but the presentation inside the boxes were a bit minimal.  In fact, if anything, the servings were a bit on the small side.

The service is five star!  The waitress was very pleasant and gave me a glass of water while I waited.   I definitely will be coming back soon to try their ramen and other dishes. I like the fact that it is not too busy but I am bit concerned that they are not too busy either.

When I went there about a month ago, it was closed for renovation of some sort.  As it just opened not very long ago, I'm not sure what they needed to do.  

When I arrived today, it didn't look much different at all, so I'm not sure why they've been closed, but anyway, I was stunned to find out that tsukemen has been eliminated from the menu.  As I believe that Monta and Fukumi are the places to go for tonkotsu, sora for miso, and tatsu for tsukemen, it was quite disappointing.  

Anyway, I had tonkotsu as I just had monta last week and wanted to compare the two.  

Let me just say that their ramen is good, but it's not the TYPE of tonkotsu that I like.  If you like shinsengumi in L.A., you will like their version of tonkotsu, but I personally favor more thicker, heavy tonkotsu flavor that you see in Monta or Daikokuya.  

You do see variation in the tonkotsu flavor in Japan, and I'm not going to say that one is better than the other, but it comes down more to personal preference and this isn't the type of tonkotsu that I like, hence I'd say 3.5 stars.

This place was pretty good. We wanted to find a new ramen place other than the usual spots.

It was pretty hoppin' for a Sunday early dinner. Which is always a good sign. 
They have great prices and a pretty good selection of ramen. 
I, myself, always love Miso broth. So I got the Miso Ramen and had them add an egg. It was really good. The broth was excellent. 
They weren't my favorite noodles. They weren't as thick as I was hoping or as firm. Not perverted. Also, the pork here isn't the most tender. I love my pork in ramen to be very tender to where it falls apart easily. Otherwise, your face is over your ramen bowl and you're trying to tear it to peices without making a mess. Or you have to stuff the entire peice in your mouth and look like an idiot while you're eating...or you just look savage as fuck.
So, depending on how you like your ramen--it will determine your experience, of course. 

And I must say, the service here was excellent. All of the staff were very friendly and very upbeat. Our waitress was super happy and literally sang to us the names of what she was serving us. It made all of us laugh and enjoy our dinner much more. That's one thing that we don't see at the other ramen joints. Most of them are ""get in and get out"".

We are what's scientifically known as fatasses and you'll soon see why.  Keep in mind, the following was only for me and my 5 foot girlfriend. We started with the gyoza and it was seriously good. My gf ate almost all of them and she usually only eats one or two pieces. Then we had an egg with ground pork bowl, which was also very tasty, kinda like shin sen gumi in LA. We also got the small curry bowl (because I love curry) and it was on point! I would come here for just the curry, even though I would have to order a ramen just because my stomach is built that way. 

Those were just the appetizers. Which we demolished. Then we got our ramen. I believe she had the shoyu ramen which I didn't really get to taste, well, because she ate it all. I got the tonkatsu shoyu ramen. I really liked it because usually the tonkatsu broths are a little on the heavy side but this one was flavorful and light. I would like to say we took some home, but no. We finished everything. 

So anyways, we got dessert. Not just a little. We didn't save room for it at all, we just kinda stuffed it in there. We got the Vanilla mochi ice cream. This was only ok. My gf didn't like the skin because it was kind of hard. But we got the mango cheesecake and that was good! It was super creamy. So creamy in fact in inspired me to get the New York style as well. This one was eh.. Only ok too. It was hard and not as creamy. Or maybe it was too cold, probably because we got it after they already closed.

Now for the not so good, I tried the Tatsu Ramen which has a tonkatsu broth with 5-6 pieces of char siu and a piece of seaweed.  I felt everything was a little bland and under seasoned.  The soup base tasted slightly watery and could have used just a pinch of salt to bring the flavor out a little better.  I think this was a general consensus, since I heard the elderly couple next to us actually tell the waiter that they felt their Miso Ramen needed salt.  The pork belly was thicker cut, similar to Ramen Sora, but marbled in fat like Monta's.  However, again the pork lacked seasoning.  They also put the ginger in the bowl for you, instead of having on the side...which i dislike since ginger is pretty overpowering and a personal preference.  They also have the option of two different types of noodles, thick and thin.....I ordered the thick noodles and felt they were a little soggy already by the time I started eating....So unfortunately at this point, I will be returning to my old stomping grounds of Monta and Ramen Sora.",Tdv7HZa4Hyjm-X0MtNmeag,2,2,3,mOnJ_JwAeNibfvKiSycYrQ

5636421,2013-12-19,0,IVnGPHdTyu_GbLo9mXj98w,"I read about Ramen Tatsu in today's Review Journal, in Wednesday's ""Taste"" section. I'd been craving some authentic Japanese ramen for a few days, so Mark and I thought we'd give it a try. I was really looking forward to the tonkotsu ramen. Tonkotsu is a pork based broth that is very time-consuming to make; the southern Japanese island of Kyushu is probably the capital of tonkotsu ramen, and I've had the real thing many times.

Chef Wayne Kageyama's tonkotsu did not disappoint; it was not as rich as the shiru (soup) that I became accustomed to in Fukuoka, and it had a decidedly smoky flavor that I didn't expect but was most pleasantly surprised by. The tonkotsu ramen was the only menu choice to offer the thin noodles that I prefer, and the smokiness of the broth was an excellent foil for the kimchi that I ordered extra as a topping. The very generous portion quite sated me; I had no reason or desire to order extra noodles or soup.

Mark ordered the shoyu ramen, which came with the thick noodles. The garlic chips that he ordered were a little overpowering, but the broth was delicate and not too salty at all.

We ordered a side of gyoza (better known to Americans as ""pot stickers"") and a side of takoyaki - small dough balls filled with pieces of octopus and topped, usually, with a sweet teriyaki type sauce, Japanese mayonnaise and shredded or powdered nori. 

The gyoza were delightful; well-stuffed, fried perfectly and then quickly steamed in the pan to offer a contrast of crunch and chew. They brought back fond memories of sake-soaked late nights in mom-and-pop shops that abound in the back alleys of Osaka, trying to stave off the next morning's inevitable hangover, heh heh. 

Osaka is famous for takoyaki, and unfortunately I found Tatsu's to be a small disappointment in an otherwise exceptional and very authentic meal. There was not enough octopus, and the the sauce that topped them off was almost sweet enough to make them a dessert. I must admit though, I did eat all of them!

I highly recommend this comfortable and clean restaurant for an authentic and reasonably priced adventure into Japanese cuisine. Chef Kageyama is very affable; the staff, who are all Japanese, are pleasant and efficient, and more than willing to overlook the errors in my Japanese, which has become a bit rusty of late.

The restaurant is located in a strip mall on the east side of South Jones, between Spring Mountain and Desert Inn; parking is not a problem. Beer (served ice-cold), wine, and hot and cold sake are available. Major credit cards are accepted. Dessert is conspicuously absent from the menu, but there IS a Baskin-Robbins right across the street, should you feel the need for something sweet afterward. If this review convinces you to try Ramen Tatsu out, please give a ""hello"" to chef Kageyama from me -the ""gaijin"" from Osaka!",UL4bxNpzHk5V-xDrF7H5fA,2,1,4,ZBIICX6Bwe3lOZNvT2jUlQ

Went on Tuesday 7-5-16 around 8PM for a late dinner. This restaurant is located on Jones between Desert Inn & Spring Mountain.  $18.47 got me a shio ramen bowl, a small order of fried rice, an oolong tea, and an order of edamame.  

$7.77 shio ramen- The noodles were nice and thick and at first I thought the broth was kinda bland but after adding some shichimi it was perfect.  I added an egg for an extra dollar.  The portion size was larger than I expected for the price.  A very good value!  The chasu is kind of thin however and not as tender as Sora's version.  

Their fried rice is a steal for $3.77...absolutely delicious and I'm craving it again already!  I also enjoyed their edamame which was served hot and salty in an adorable bowl which also held the shells.  

The server could not have been nicer.  She was absolutely bending over backwards to make us happy!  This place is a great value for the money and I really enjoyed coming here.",VigsAph76fP7pechJ743EA,11,10,4,5TS7NCtpHn54ROjJEy3EWA

There's a great selection of bowls: Shoyu, Shio, Miso, Tonkotsu, Curry, and others. When there's a wide selection like this, I find usually there is a loss in quality - as if having only two or three bowls like other ramen spots allows them to output great flavor in a speedy service. At Tatsu, you get the complete package: quick service and high quality flavor in each bowl; each distinct and unique from the next. 

By now, I've tried them all (they now also have customizable options for additional ingredients). Over the months that I've been coming in here, I've noticed I'm not the only one that prefers Tatsu.  Business is doing well - more tables have been set in place, two flat screens were installed, and the menu has expanded. 

This summer, they introduced Cold Ramen - a different delicious take on ramen for a hot day - and also Tsukemen which has thicker noodles with a dipping sauce of a hint of fish flavor.

My friend is a huge fan of tsukemen ramen (known as cold ramen). Now if you're not familiar with this... It's basically ramen noodles separated from the soup. You pick up your portion size of noodles and dip it into the soup. The noodles are a lot fatter, almost resembling pasta noodles and the soup is a lot more thick.

This place is THE place for ramen in the valley. Having eaten a every ramen-ya in the valley, I settled for the fact that we will were forever doomed to ramen mediocrity. 
The main notables for ramen in the valley do a good job filling a craving for ramen they all fail hit the spot for me. 
As you can already figure out, I am a bit of a Japanese food snob as I have had the opportunity to live in the motherland for many years and made it a mission to eat many a ramen-ya and try the best ramen of many prefectures. 

I am not really bias to one particular style of ramen and usually default to the respective Ramen-ya's specialty. 
For this place they had a nice array of ramen types from traditional miso and shoyu to curry ramen.  

We opted to try one mild (miso) and one wild (curry). 
I chose the curry ramen as I am a fan of curry udon so this was right up my alley. I enjoyed this bowl however it didn't blow my mind: it was ""different"" . The curry flavor was very subtle and ended up getting washed away with the base broth and eventually was lost.I think I will stick to curry udon and 86 the ramen variant. 

The Miso Ramen was the champ here! The base was very sweet and rich and at first bite transported me back to the motherland. Ensure that your order this with corn, butter and garlic: The REAL way to enjoy miso ramen. 
Butter you say? Don't knock it until you rock it. I mean if it wasn't good why would they have it on the menu? And besides that's how we do it in the motherland..

Take it from me this place does miso ramen legit!! This is now my default for my ramen fix in the Vegas Valley. 

Eat with confidence

5918515,2013-10-23,3,IVnGPHdTyu_GbLo9mXj98w,"Saw the signage for a new ramen restaurant that was going to be opening soon while picking up dinner next door.  Fast forward about a month and I saw a few reviews from fellow Yelpers and most were just so so.  In spite of that, I still wanted to try it.  What can I say, I am a sucker for checking out new Japanese restaurants. So I asked Leos to go with me on Monday.  Unfortunately they are closed on Mondays.  So we went to a new Vietnamese pho restaurant instead.

[Visit 1]
So after waiting another 22 hours, I went back to try my luck at Ramen Tatsu (on their official grand opening day) after clocking out at work for the day.  The restaurant had 2-3 parties already when I arrived, but soon after placing my order for a Tatsu Ramen Deluxe I realized I was alone in the restaurant with just the staff.  Nervously I noticed that I was feeling oddly warm, as if I was still outside in the 111 degree heat wave, but it turned out to just be a weak AC unit.

The Tatsu Ramen Deluxe - Tonkotsu + Shoyu based ramen with 6 pieces of Chasiu and vegetables, seaweed, 1/2 egg.  The presentation makes it look bigger than it really is, reminiscent of the Frilled Lizard (http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ocXifB-lZLI/TuBV8QyQ3fI/AAAAAAAADfY/3h3LfMfHrFo/s1600/Frilled-Lizard-03.jpg)  The broth was decent, the noodles was cooked well.

[Latest Visit from yesterday]
I ate already before making an unscheduled stop at Ramen Tatsu.  So I only ordered their Chasiu Rice Bowl. Which is just a basic bowl of steamed rice with pieces of chasiu, green onions and a tiny bit of sauce on it.  It tasted fine, albeit a little dry with all the rice and very little sauce.  But was difficult to eat without potentially dropping pieces of chasiu on the table.

I tried the broth from the Tonkotsu Ramen and Shoyu Ramen that my dining companions ordered.  The Tonkotsu broth has definitely improved, and was definitely way better than any of the ramen I tried at the recent Ramen Festival at the Rio.

The portion for the ramen is what I considered smallish.  But the extra $1.50 for ""noodle refills"" is a great relative value.

Other observations: 
* I asked for the Tsukemen, but it is no longer on the menu.
* The restaurant is typically pretty empty, great if you don't like to wait for ramen, which is supposed to be fast food. 
* Split check request is handled without any fuss. Definite plus.

Decor:  Nice and simple.  During holidays, they will have seasonally decorations,at least they have put up Halloween theme decorations right now.

Cleanliness: Very clean

Service: Friendly and thoughtful

Probability of return visits: Moderately high

5928802,2014-07-09,6,IVnGPHdTyu_GbLo9mXj98w,"Oddly enough, the husband and I were craving ramen on a hot, humid day in Vegas. We usually go to Ramen Sora, but decided to check out a different place this time around. Decided on Ramen Tatsu over Hiromaru, since ""fusion ramen"" sounded too weird and complicated. They are located right across the street from 168 Market. I don't like this plaza at all. It feels too crowded and the parking is retarded.

They were pretty busy on a Saturday afternoon, but we were able to get seated right away. Our server was polite and friendly. I felt that she handled servicing all the customers very well by herself, including the couple sitting next to us. They were flagging her down for every little thing and asking a lot of questions (yeah, they were one of those). I ordered the Shoyu Ramen and a mini curry bowl. The broth for the Shoyu Ramen had a good flavor, not too rich but also not bland. I felt that there were a good amount of noodles. The curry was great! NO VEGGIES, and I believe the meat they used in it was pork. Definitely my kind of curry! It wasn't watery and tasted very good. I'm not sure who the owners are, but this place looks and feels like an authentic Japanese restaurant. My husband liked it as well, despite being located in

5939141,2013-11-09,13,IVnGPHdTyu_GbLo9mXj98w,"Recently I was invited to a dinner which featured several of the most famous Las Vegas Japanese restaurant owners. It was unanimous in their opinion that they believed RAMEN TATSU was the best TOKYO RAMEN-YA in America. Yes, you heard that statement correctly. TATSU is NOT a Kyushu Ramen-Ya, it is a TOKYO style Ramen-Ya that specializes in Shoyu style broth. If you don't believe me, ask the owner himself. The owners name is Wayne and he is a very respected man in the LV Japanese-American community. 

RAMEN TATSU is unique in the fact that all ingredients are natural/organic style. Wayne uses three different types of natural chicken bones for the broth in his Tokyo style ramen. He also uses three different types of natural pork bones for his Tonkotsu ramen. No other ramen-ya in Las Vegas goes this far out of their way to produce such a rich broth. Many Japanese yelpers express that the reason California(Sawtelle Blvd) ramen is so much better than LV ramen is because the California places use this style of cooking. The cook and owner has been the force behind many of the popular ramen-yas in Los Angeles. He was the man responsible for the recipes which have now achieved notoriety, the same recipes from the LA ramen-yas that attended this years Ramen festival at the Rio Casino. 

The signature dish at RAMEN TATSU is the Shoyu-Tonkotsu fusion. This variation of ramen has become increasingly popular in modern day Japan. It's origins stem from the Kobe area, where it has become a new subregional variation of ramen. On account of the fact that Wayne is from Kobe, he has many years of experience preparing this subregional variation.  The recipe at TATSU remains unchanged from the recipe from Kobe while Monta's Shoyu-Tonkotsu is not the authentic recipe, instead it is merely an invention of the Kurume cook(who is now a Brazilian dude), who mixes his Kyushu broth with a generic nonaffiliated shoyu broth. What I am expressing is that RAMEN TATSU has the only authentic Shoyu-Tonkotsu in LV. And, this is the item you should order during your next visit.  

The Curry- During your next visit at RAMEN TATSU, you should not neglect the Japanese Curry. TATSU uses their own secret recipe which facilities a unique taste which upon my assessment is superior to CoCo Ichinbanya and Kaba Curry. In a demonstration of unique cooking styles, the Chicken broth from the ramen is used as the backing for the curry. Wayne's own particular Gram Masala is then instilled into the broth, and combined with three different types of vegetables. The resulting product is curry that is as addictive as Mr. Zenbayashi's recipe. And during a recent conversation with Mr. Zenbayashi, even he verbally approved of Wayne's recipe. That is a major compliment coming from the man who runs the highest rated Curry-Ya in yelp history. 

They also have Shio Ramen which is great for older Japanese folks. A lot of older Japanese people like my Dad refuse to eat Tonkotsu and Miso Ramen, and eat nothing but Shio. 

I will argue that RAMEN TATSU is the most authentic Japanese Ramen-Ya in America. It remains true to the regional recipes in Japan, and the owner refuses to submit to western pressures to ""Americanize"" his recipes(as you can see, many of the negative reviews are due to the fact that the recipe is not americanized). For example, Wayne recently terminated contracts with noodle suppliers because he felt they were not completely authentic to Japanese standards. For the last few weeks, several Japanese noodle companies have been competing for the contract, while Wayne assesses and samples them all to determine which is the most appropriate. The whole reason that Tsukemen is no longer on the menu is because Wayne demanded his distributors send noodles which were 100% authentic to the dish and made in Japan. He would not accept anything lower, and would NEVER serve an item that wasn't 100% authentic to the traditional Japanese recipe. Tsukemen will return shortly from my understanding. This establishment represents the Japanese culture very proudly and will not give into the pressures to westernize the menu. This is the reason there is no Togarashi. This is the reason there is no Srirachi. This is the reason why there is no cans of Pabst Blue Ribbon. Just like the owner of Kabuto, Wayne won't breech protocol which was established in Japan by the Japanese, for the Japanese. And I respect him a lot for this. Complaining that there is no  Shichimi Togarashi at a ramen-ya is like bitching to the chef at Kabuto about why there is no California rolls while you soak your chutoro nigiri in a mixture of shoyu and wasabi that you plan on eating with a fork. I have to say that I vouch for RAMEN TATSU and encourage all the Japanese-American residents of LV to support this business. 

Just a final note- The music they play here is the theme music to the Final Fantasy games, and old school anime like Cutey Honey, Candy Candy, and the Miyazaki films",JM0GL6Dx4EuZ1mprLk5Gyg,30,21,5,qxD-MpXW8eEGr8JNBoxY-A
