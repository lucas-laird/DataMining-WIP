Food on a 5 star scale:

Fried Shrimp 4.5 Star
They give you 8 big pieces, not too bready like L&L. The mustardy tartar sauce might be too tarty for some people. 

BBQ Salmon 4.5 Star
Flavorful with generous pieces... sometimes.

Shrimp Curry 4 Star
About 5 shrimps, with potato and carrots in a yummy curry sauce. A little cincy with the curry though. 

Kalua Pig 2.5 Star
Dry and bland. 

Kalbi 2.5 Star
Too sweet

BBQ Chicken 2.5 Star
Bland.  

Macaroni 3.5 Star
It's much better than a lot of places but not better than Zippy's.

Musubi 3.5 Star
Where's the spam? Nice hint of teriyaki sauce.

Malasada 1 Star
Come on, we know your trick.  Pillsbury biscuits deep fried and coated with sugar.  

Garlic Noodles 2 Star
It was garlicy, but missing something. 

Chicken Katsu 4 Star
Golden Brown to perfection.

Manapua 3 Star
It's all bread and hardly any char sui.

I was craving for gyoza today and I walked in to a fairly empty place. I was pretty stoked since I only have an hour for lunch and I knew ordering gyoza will not be a long wait at all. Well, I was dead wrong.

It got pretty crowded after I ordered. I sat down and 10-15 mins passed, I realized that people who ordered after me got their meals first. Mind you, these are actual meals with rice, mac salad, meat, etc. Two people came in and seemed to know the workers and ordered a bunch of stuff and they got their food so fast!

I waited 30 mins for my order of gyoza and they weren't even pan seared as well as they used to be. Everybody after me got their large orders and I was still sitting down. They only grabbed my order when I stood up from my chair. 

Guys, please figure out a better system. Don't treat customers more kindly than others just because you know them personally.

I've grown to expect a certain level of awesome when it comes to Hawaiian eats in Vegas, which shouldn't really be too unheard of, especially when considering how many folks from Hawaii actually reside here
(Vegas is officially Hawaii's ninth island for goodness sake).

And don't get me wrong, Vegas does have some amazing Hawaiian eateries.
Ohana just doesn't happen to be one of them.

Was it because it is a chain place?
No, for whatever reason, I'm a little more forgiving about that kinda stuff out here.
*Not to say Vegas lacks originality or anything but this town is home to a mini Statue of Liberty, Tour Eiffel, and one pyramid of Giza (complete with Sphinx).

What was really disappointing (besides the food obviously) is the fact it is regarded so highly on Yelp and received some really super positive reviews.

Chicken katsu, pork lau lau, bbq chicken, and garlic shrimp.  meh, okay, meh, and meh.

Craving some Hawaiian BBQ after coming back from Hawaii, my hubby insisted on coming here for a taste Hawaii. 

I tried the Kalua pork and my husband had the curry chicken katsu.

Although the portion sizes are enormous, I can't overlook the fact that the food isn't that great. Just the smell of the Kalua pork was off putting - something about it made me nauseated. The flavour was of over-seasoned canned meat. The watery - yes, watery! texture of the pork is an insult to the whole concept of salted roasted pork.

The chicken katsu curry was also watery and rather bland. 

Given other great Hawaiian places so close by, it's hard to justify coming here. 

FInally, FYI bring your own water if you do decide to try this place.

When I asked for a glass of tap water, the cashier woman said the only water available was the bottled water. Then she proceeded to hand a plastic cup filled with watered down Thai iced tea to my hubby.

I'm not stupid. You have plastic cups, you can fill it with tap water. 'Nuff said.

The shrimp were not peeled so I had to peel them myself. And the beef tended to have a bit too much gristle in it.

The rice was OK. Neither one of us liked the macaroni noodles..

Also, I ordered the BBQ Mix plate and while the chicken was great, the beef was about 15% fat.  The serving size of rice and macaroni salad seems to have gone down to a shameful amount.  The macaroni salad was good... all three fork fulls of it.

No courtesy cup for water!  I was forced to by a drink.  The drink selection from the soda fountain is VERY limited. :(

I've been sick all week, didn't want to cook, needed to eat something, and definitely didn't want chinese food. I figured BBQ was a safe option; grilled meats and rice probably wouldn't tear my stomach up too badly. 

I am SO glad that I came in to eat here. I got the mixed BBQ; short ribs, chicken, beef, served with two scoops of rice, macaroni salad, and mixed greens. Absolutely delicious. The meat was flavorful and tender, I washed it down with pineapple-orange juice, and I had more than enough for a doggy bag to go home with. All for $10.

The place is a bit small and can be really crammed during their busy hours. Aside from that, they have a big selection of food and also offer boba milk tea or thai tea as well as Hawaiian sun drinks. 

I usually order the chicken katsu with gravy or sometimes with curry depending on my mood. I can never go wrong with gravy! The chicken is always very crispy and whether you order the mini or regular, you're getting a lot of food. As for the curry, it's usually a hit or miss. It's not the best sometimes but I really love their chicken katsu so I can eat that by itself. I also am not too fond of the macaroni salad that comes with each dish but you can replace it with more rice. 

The BBQ chicken musubi is my new favorite musubi! Ever since my mother-in-law brought some home for us, I really can't go back to spam musubi (unless it's the only option of course). 2 can make me full so the portion is a decent size and it's perfectly wrapped.

We ordered using the online for for take-out, which was super convenient since I hate ordering food over the phone. So anytime I can order online, I love it.

However, my problem came after the initial ordering. We ordered as on the website -

Chicken Katsu - with macaroni, rice, with sauce on the site, on a bed of cabbage.

BBQ Combo Plate - with macaroni, no rice and no cabbage

Malasadas 


The Katsu came with Macaroni on the side, no cabbage and no sauce to be seen.

The BBQ plate came on a bed of cabbage.   

I don't mind that mine came on a bed of cabbage, and my boyfriends without, but the missing sauce was a big let down.


I had never had any of the BBQ items before (Ribs, BBQ Chicken and BBQ beef) and I really only enjoyed the beef, the ribs were ok, and I didn't know the BBQ chicken was all dark meat.

The Katsu was good like always, but could have used sauce ;)

Malasadas are always delicious, I just wish they came in half sizes.  There are two of us and we don't need 10 of them, 5 would be more than enough.

I have gotten the Salmon in the past and generally enjoy it, especially considering it's price!

*What I usually Order*

Chicken Katsu: 4/5 The chicken is breaded tender and juicy. Their Katsu sauce is a lot different than most Hawaiian places I've gone to. I usually don't order chicken katsu because of how heavy some places drizzle the katsu sauce but this place finds a great balance. 

Short Ribs: 5/5 Even the mini is more than enough for me but when I want extra left overs I get the full size. The short ribs are cooked to perfection super soft and a bit chewy but it falls off the bone ever so easily. It comes with vegetables, rice, and macaroni salad. The whole dish comes together perfectly. 

Drinks: 4/5 Hawaiian Sun Passion Orange is soooooo good definitely a drink to top off delicious Hawaiian food. Very refreshing especially on a hot Vegas day. It's served in a can that they keep in a cool fridge & its super cheap I just wish there was more in a can lol

Service: 4/5 This is a hit or miss most of the employee's are really nice especially this young man which I think is the owner because I think this is a family owned business.

I placed an online order for 40 malasadas, which asks you for you credit card information as well as emails you a receipt. No where on the website or the email does it say to bring the credit card in. They do not charge the card via the Internet, they charge you when you come in. (Which may I add, if you're going to allow your customers to place online orders, you may want to mention this... When you send a receipt to someone; that's pretty much payment).

As soon as I walked into the business to tell them I placed an online order the hostess was already flustered because of other orders, completely understandable. As soon as I told her I didn't have the card because this was a business credit card for my work, I was placing an order for lunch, she got irritated with me and immediately  called her manager. When she tells me that it is fine and they will run the credit card with the information they have, she asks me to write down my contact information and my drivers license number. I simply
told her that I won't be giving her my drivers license number but I left my business card with her to contact me if there is an issue. Irritation comes across her face again and says ""that's what my manager said she needed! Fine, I'll just have her call you."" There were many other ways to handle this situation, rudeness was not one I recommend. 

Simply put, I will no longer be bringing my business or the business of my company into this location.

They just do it better. Of course, nothing really compares to home, but when I have a hankering for Chicken Cutlet (Chicken Katsu with brown gravy) or Kalua Pork with Cabbage, it is delicious. These two dishes are really all I want to eat when it comes to Hawaiian BBQ, so that is how I gauge the taste and quality of Hawaiian restaurants. 

Their chicken katsu is moist with a crispy breading, while their gravy is very tasty. I love that their Kalua pork is moist with tender cabbage, and delicious juices. Their plate lunches come with consistently tasty sticky rice and their Mac Salad is satisfactory. Huge portions for under $10. Service is also very quick. I called my order in during my last two visits and the food was ready within ten minutes.

4749823,2008-09-08,9,RnAb4KkRDmWUBWhhZhugZQ,"Ohana is one of my Fave Five on my phone. Why not? With addictive favorites like their Saimin, Chicken Katsu (I swear, if you're gonna ingest processed deep-fried breaded stuff anyway you might as well enjoy it), Loco Moco, and all matters of curry, it's the perfect pick-me-up for the long haul. Add the extra calories and mayo goodness of the traditional macaroni salad side, and you're easily consuming close to Phelpsian calories if you eat here three times a day. Which I was doing, at one point in my life, until I couldn't bear to smell the Katsu or the green curry sauce any more without dry heaving. Then 24 hours would pass, I'd realize that there are no more leftovers in the fridge, and I'd hit them up again. When placing phone orders, it's often a toss up whether you get the bored college dude or the congenial older lady who doesn't multitask very well, but has a winning smile that reminds me of my cooler senile aunts. At first, I attributed this to her newness on the job, but still getting my usual order screwed up six months later is just bad organizational skills. Not a big deal though, just something to keep in mind when making complex orders over the phone. 

PROTIP: When ordering lunch, call in around 1130. This gives them enough time to open and warm up the ingredients, but does not place you amid the lunch rush. Dinner is often the reverse; I've gotten hefty helpings AFTER the dinner rush many times, a fortunate occurrence I attribute to calling in that brief moment of clarity between ""holy shit that was brutal"" and ""we're almost closed.""

I remember coming here when my first daughter was just a wee-little baby. Now she's almost 6 so it's just nuts to know that I've been eating this amazing food for that long. I did move around the valley so I didn't have the luxury of this local joint as close, but let me tell you... We are reunited and it feels SOO GOOD! 

I usually get the bbq combo plate. That comes with a combination 3 different meats (teriyaki chicken, beef & spare ribs), two scoops of rice and a scoop of macaroni salad! I am a sucker for that macaroni salad, so I always order a second on the side. (I do that at every Hawaiian joint I go to! How weird of me!) 

Lately, we have been getting the Saiman noodles because it is so quick and delicious. It will really fill you up if you're in a hurry. I can't lie, I'm also a big time sucker for the dang masubis. So I usually get 1. If my kids are with me, I HAVE to get them each one, or I won't live to see tomorrow!

I'm very glad that this location is so close, and the staff is friendly, I just wish inside wasn't so cramped. It just makes this claustrophobic, give-me-my-food-so-I-can-get-out-of-here feel. I usually order to-go so I don't have to worry, but man most of the time the food smells so good I can't help but tear that bag open and indulge! 

I LOVE the variety of Hawaiian Sun tropical drinks, it just is a nice way to refresh yourself and really get that Hawaiian feel.

My first time dining there in June, I ordered the Pork Lau Lau then and couldn't really give them a fair review.  My taste buds were shot and everything tasted bland.

This time around, healthy and taste buds in full working order, I went ahead and ordered my favorite, the Pork Lau Lau.  I also asked for two scoops of mac salad instead of two scoops of rice.  (Most Hawaiian restaurants will substitute without charging, so I usually prefer to do that.)

The pork lau lau was definitely a lot better than the one I had at Aloha Specialties Restaurant in the California Hotel!  (http://www.yelp.com/biz/wpnLPAnkMEb1NpC3xiD_qg?hrid=XPspyfknURLxczv4O2ZUvg)  It wasn't dry and old like the other place and had a lot more flavor.  I did add a lot of soy sauce to my dish, which I tend to do all the time.  I could have used a bit more fat in mine too, but that's more of a personal preference.

When I was done cleaning off my plate of two scoops of mac salad, one scoop of rice, and the pork lau lau dish,  my boyfriend looked at me and asked if that was a mini order or a full plate.  ""Uh, a full one...they didn't offer the mini for the pork lau lau...""  I guess it was his way of calling me a piggie! Haha!

1)  Do not go there expecting it to be quick.  It took 22 minutes for my order to arrive and it was a very basic order -- a BBQ chicken bowl and a musubi -- which are staples at a place like this.  It was painfully slow and for no apparent reason.  There were 2 people ahead of me in line when I got there.  There was nobody else waiting around for food.  They had been open about 15 minutes.  

2)  Re customer service.  I stood there waiting and was obviously getting antsy, but received no acknowledgement.  Instead, the lady at the counter avoided eye contact with me.  Finally, after more than 15 minutes, I asked about my order, thinking maybe they'd forgotten it.  She curtly told me that mine takes awhile to cook (really, a chicken bowl?) and it would be coming soon.  After 5 more minutes, she finally handed me my bag, without saying a word.

3)  The meat on the musubi was the thinnest I've ever seen (of hundreds, if not thousands, that I've eaten in my life) and it was overcooked.  Fail.  

4)  The chicken bowl was okay.  Tasted like your basic chicken bowl.  Not a lot of chicken, though.   I wasn't expecting much since it was a bowl and not one of the plate lunches, but still, it was pretty skimpy.  Enough for me, but if you're hungry, be forewarned.

Overall, despite my love of Hawaiian BBQ, this was a bad experience.  But I suppose if you're in the neighborhood and craving it, and you have a lot of time and low expectations, it would be okay.",YuABJc2x2pSDUw2HD6bzWQ,0,0,2,_TxwCTIPTBtx8gfEtsiYSA

No joke, at almost 5 PM, it was more than 100* F outside. I was sweating bullets when I pulled up. I walked inside and other people were waiting for their to-go orders. I ordered two BBQ mixed plates, paid the $20 bill, and said, ""May I please have a cup for water while I wait."" The lady at the register said, ""We don't have water."" WHAT?! We live in a hair dryer in Vegas - hot, dry and windy - and you don't serve water?! What is this cruel world coming to?

Now, for those of you who don't like sweet drinks, like myself, don't think you're going to get away with getting an unsweetened tea or something from the drink fountain. Every drink is sweetened. For shame! I did notice that they have bubble tea, thai tea and 8oz bottled waters in a little fridge that they store half and half in, but I'm not quite sure if those are for sale. If they are, really? Somebody can buy a cup for unlimited fountain drinks but not unlimited water? This, I cannot accept.

Food was decent. I ordered 2 scoops of mac salad instead of 2 scoops of rice, simply because I don't like rice (yep!) and that was no extra charge to sub, which I appreciate.

I noticed a guy came in to order two boba drinks and the lady at the cash register asked him to fill up his cup with ice from the drink fountain, before she filled it up with premade Thai Tea. After watching that (I tried to take a picture because it was so odd) I most likely would not order boba from here.

To save myself from sudden death while waiting, I went and grabbed a water out of my trunk, but it was hot enough to cook a Cup of Noodles without a microwave so meh.",OLn8EvPsu4hNug8V5PF2jA,8,3,3,mJcpCQVDyJP0o6mhcWeUoQ

5778568,2014-05-26,1,RnAb4KkRDmWUBWhhZhugZQ,"So upon moving into the south west side of Vegas, the only Hawaiian restaurant I knew about was Island Flavor. It wasn't until one Sunday afternoon that my boyfriend came home with food from here and we haven't been back at Island Flavor since. Don't get me wrong though! I love Island Flavor, but Ohana Hawaiian BBQ is in walking distance from my house.

Their BBQ mixed plate is delicious - it's my usual go to order if I'm not wanting anything else. Their chicken katsu is amazing along with their kalua pig. Some people aren't a fan of macaroni salad. I, on the other hand, LOVE MACARONI SALAD. The one from here I on point.

I get really iffy when ordering boba from a non-Asian place so I was skeptical when ordering a Thai tea from here... BUT! I was proven wrong. The Thai tea here is just as good as any other boba place which makes me extremely happy because now I am just walking distance away from fulfilling my Thai tea craving.

BIG TIP: Order ahead of time if possible. The wait here can be very long if you come at the wrong time. I was ordering dinner here for myself around 9 o'clock on a Tuesday night and ended up waiting at least 25 minutes. 

Did I mention how small it is? You add on the possible long waiting time and crowded area. You'll probably be eating your meal with a stranger waiting for their order RIGHT next to you.",VhkjxxBz-A4M-mMncpn1ZA,2,1,5,7BOlgssMny32b3FoPc_2tg

This place is in my backyard so I keep going. I've found a staple that warrants a better review: garlic shrimp! 6/5 stars. Awesome. Also the older lady who rings up the orders is super nice. Spam musubi is still delicious, and the short ribs are good too.

Overall after a shakey start this place has won me over.

--------

Admittedly I don't have a ton of experience with Hawaiian food, but when The Egg and I has a better Loco Moco than a dedicated Hawaiian place, there's a problem.

I've been here 3 times. The very first time it was 9:20PM and as I entered the open door, I was stopped by a young girl:

""We're closed"".
I looked at my watch. 9:20. I looked at the sign, pointed, and said, ""The sign says you close at  9:30.""
""We're closed"".
""It's not 9:30.""
""We're closed"".
I left.

4 months later I gave them another chance. The Spam masubi was great, although how you mess one of those up, I'm not sure. The Loco Moco was OK. The brown gravy was the problem. Flavorless. The eggs and patties were passable. There was an enormous amount of rice. So if you're in it for the rice and rice alone, this is your place.

A week after that I had a Loco Moco at The Egg and I on Rainbow and it was way, way better. So yeah. I would expect a Hawaiian place to do a Hawaiian staple better than a breakfast place, but evidently not in this case.",bRZ8lsO2yDVRTvOkC7nX1w,0,1,4,GTE3-1mnWt-dt2om_cHetA

Chicken Katsu - I know this might sound weird, but this was probably the healthiest tasting Chicken Katsu I have ever had. I think it was the quality of the chicken and amount in each bite. I am used to a katsu that is mainly breading, so this dish was different from the rest. The dipping sauce was awesome. It leans towards the sweeter side which is a plus in my book.

BBQ Beef - The marinade for this dish was on point. It was DELICIOUS. I couldn't get enough of it.

Spam Masubi - I need to find out the recipe of the sauce the Spam was dipped in. It was extremely good.

I decided to give Ohana another try when I was in the area again. This time I ordered the BBQ Mix Combo (again with 3 scoops of rice). It came with:
BBQ Beef- about half of it was burnt pretty badly. The few pieces I had that were edible tasted good, but the meat came with a lot of fat. 
BBQ Chicken- full of flavor, cooked just right, and easy to eat. It was the best part!
