The staff are friendly and greet you right away.  It's an almost everyday (closed obn Sundays) buffet of ""Kapampangan"" cuisine.  Mainstays like Dinuguan, Papaitan, Kare-kare and Abobo are favorites here.  These are complemented by a selection of Sinigangs, Paksiws and and sauteed veggies.  Short orders include breakfast plates of Tapa, Tocino, Logganisa or Tuyo with the usual Garlic Rice and Fried Eggs anyway you want it.  You might wait a while for them to prepare it, but it sure is worth the wait.  

It's a family owned restaurant and that's the feeling you get when you eat there, you're treated like family.  And that makes for good eating.",wRqOw05E-gDiNYsWkzmDqg,3,1,5,_ahFcz9DCDQDY8C0t4cnzw
