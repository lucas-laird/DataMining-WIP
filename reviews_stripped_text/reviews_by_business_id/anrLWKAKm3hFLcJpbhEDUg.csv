508102,2014-01-18,1,anrLWKAKm3hFLcJpbhEDUg,This place is a train wreck. We waited at least 10 minutes (maybe 15) for a server to come to our table.  Finally I got out of our booth and flagged him down. His name is Lance and he is without a doubt one of the most obnoxious jerks I have ever come across. When I complained about the wait he essentially said that they were short handed and if I didn't like it we should leave. Naturally I walk to the front and asked for the manager. I was told by the hostess that she wasn't there (big surprise). She did give me her card.  I called and left a message but no return call. I will never go to any IHOP ever again.

We got here around noon on a Saturday and the place was slow.  We got seated but it took 1/2 hour before anyone came to take our order.  When eddie came by, he said that he wasn't our server but that he'd take our order for drinks and food. We waited for another 45 minutes before I got up and tracked Eddie down to find out who our server was. He told me that our server was on break and that the manager sent most of the employees home or on break leaving just eddie and another lady. When our food and drinks finally came, most of the food was burned.  This place is not well managed and should be avoided.

I went there today with my family and right as we walked in, there was another couple there having breakfast however they had their dog with them at the table. I know that many of the establishments here in LV are dog friendly however they do not normally allow dogs inside unless it is a service dog. This was a small to medium-sized dog and its owners had placed his food on the table and him eat off of the table. Once they left, the bus boy cleared the table and another couple was then seated there without them having cleaned the surface of the table.
When we were ready to pay, I asked the cashier (Angel) to explain their policy for pets. At first, she said that couple is a regular customer so they allow the dog. When I said that this is unsanitary and against the law, her response was: ""what do you wanna do, complain?""
I asked to speak to the manager who then claimed they are not allowed to ask if it's a service dog and they allow the dogs into the restaurant. 
I have nothing against dogs but I will never return to this IHOP because I do not wish to eat at a table where a dog was probably just eating at.

She took our order and when our food came out the sisters food had spilt honey mustard on her plate (not a big deal but not everybody likes honey mustard). as we asked for an extra plate she seemed like she didn't acknowledge us and after 5 minutes of waiting for 1 plate she threw it down on the table. we said thank you and she said ""yeah"" and asked the table behind us how they were doing. Not once did Norma bother asking us if we were okay or needed anything. She walked past us and we had to stop her to ask her for the check as she kept walking and said ""yup"". she gave us the check we said thank you and got up to go pay at the front and she didn't say anything. as we were waiting for someone to ring us in all we heard was her screaming ""THANK YOU , YOURE WELCOME"" as she was picking up out table. she then walked to the back and asked 'Janay' to ring us in before she ""knocks somebody out"". Janay was very nice and asked if everything was okay and rang us in and we were on our way. I am not one to write bad reviews but this is just crossing the line. Working F&B is not an easy job especially when you have customers that can be very stressful or rude which we were not and her little comments to us and about us were very rude and crossing the line.

I almost ordered some pancakes but at the last minute I changed my mind and ordered their new turkey and bacon club sandwich.  It's not really a club and had I read the menu I would have seen that it was on a grilled roll.  Misnamed product I'd say.  The disappointing thing about the sandwich was that the turkey was sliced lunch meat, not sliced turkey.  It was an ungainly sandwich and the innards squeezed out as I ate it.  The redeeming part of lunch was the seasoned fries--seasoned mostly with salt, but then I'm a salt freak, so I thought they were great.

Service was OK.  After we got our lunchers, we realized the server forgot to give us napkins or silverware.  Unable to flag anyone down, we walked to another table and took theirs.
