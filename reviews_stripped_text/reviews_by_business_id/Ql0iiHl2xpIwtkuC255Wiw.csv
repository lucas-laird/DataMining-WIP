We spent about $90 for two adults, a 6 yr old and a 7 yr old: all you can eat buffet, and 120 credits to play with a VIP card... We were there for about 3 hours, my kids had a blast with the bumper cars, the bowling, miniature golf, the spinning ride, and the boat. It was like a perfect family day and we pigged out! 

The buffet was well stocked, pizza was ok. Salad bar was awesome! The fried chicken is good, And the cinnamon rolls and cookies were hot and fresh!! 

I've seen the bad comments about this place being dirty, but I think it's exaggerated... The floors were a bit dirty but it's understandable for a place that big with food and play for CHILDREN to get a smudge here and there... However, we didn't go over the weekend, that's when it seems to get hectic..

Over all we loved it and will for sure make this our family Friday fun spot",XA0uTOz98pE1GpytFXLulw,1,0,5,wm-CVnOy7IGSiHTE2t5QaQ

Lesley, the supervisor helped us with our bill and distributing the fun cards. Our party started at 1pm and we stayed until 6pm! I prefer this place over Gameworks or Dave and Busters!

Bc I wasn't gonna yell at the inexperienced assistant managers or the lost and confused ""manager"". Everyone's checking in gets a bad attitude bc no ones on the same page. The reason for my review here today was bc. I reserved ahead of time for a b-day party. When they took us to our area there was no reserved tables. My family was scattered everywhere in there sectional rooms in between other guest the whole night. . It took them 1/2 hour to clean and pull tables together so half of us can be together. This is after already had to wait to get in. . (So pissed) Ok I only spent 700 dollars here. I'm just saying money is good anywhere. So expect disappointment. It is over priced for the quality of food and service John's has to offer.. For big parties they offered to bring full pizzas to the tables, they never did... U decide moms. It pissed this dad off all they tried to give me was a $30 credit vip card. That's 2 kids no game time. Maybe your good for party of 2. It won't be so bad. (It's new and none of the self portrait machines work) sorry selfies CHUCK-e does take pride in memorable days. This is a kids place and dudes be coming here with open carry weapons. And the managers know it. She noticed it when I was the next complaint waiting patiently.. Frustrated managers must be getting divorced soon.. (Work sucks babe super hectic today!)

429909,2016-02-18,5,Ql0iiHl2xpIwtkuC255Wiw,"I took my daughter here in Presidents day. I'd attempted to go here prior but left in protest because of having to pay for the buffet b4 the incredible fun began. To make it worse, horrible yelp reviews had me walking in here with an attitude way before i even the fun began. 

We paid $17 total 4 the buffet & $20 for a preloaded fun card. Given the volume, it's quite impossible to keep the buffet items fully stocked. I think they would benefit by hiring buffet chefs who have culinary experience in keeping up with the large masses. The buffet would be so much better if the food stations had stanchions to control entry & exit. No need to pay for drinks. The cups r a free for all kinda thing. 

We arrived at 1pm, ate n the Fun began. I like the huge variety of games they have. A few were out of order. $20 lasted us from 2-6pm. If we all ate & cleaned after ourselves, the place would be clean. 80% of the families left their dirty plates and cups on the table. 

I like the idea of multiple dining rooms they had. Surprisingly, some of the buffet items empty at 1pm, were still empty at 6pm. I got my money's worth. My daughter and I visited the buffet 4 times. Wasn't gonna let my $17 worth so i think it was more than worth it. 

The gaming technology could use a little tweaks. The fun loaded cards can only be swiped upside-down n then u tap on the screen to get credits. Yeah!  A little retarded. I feel like I double paid on some of the games b4 i figured it out. It was never explained during purchasing. 

So, lose the attitude. Go there hungry, stuff up n have fun. Parking n sales lines r not that bad. U got legs? Then u can find a parking spot n walk inside. 

Lastly, the bathrooms needs paper towels. I hate that bacteria spreading blower that just recycles the stinky air while u dry up. 

I'll be back next time. This time, I'm skipping breakfast n wrecking a harvest at the buffet.",K_FKo_NUXF0gQQuHyy5zgw,4,1,4,eFpVGYY2YkqQZYHEx5qwqw

They had a good time. It is kinda pricey, but for a few hours entertainment what the neck why not. 3 Buffets with drinks (2 kids 1 adult) and 2 $20 fun cards cost $73. The arcade area is quite big, with a wide assortment of games. They do have some rides here as well (bumper cars, a tilt a whirl type ride, and even mini golf). Food assortment is mediocre. To be honest I was hesitant to try most of it so I just stuck to the pizza. They do have quite a variety of different varieties such as nacho, alfredo, spicy peanut butter to name a few. We didn't wait that long in line to pay, less than 10 minutes. At busy times they tell you there is a 2 hour time limit to stay in the seating/dining areas.

We had a fairly large party and were able to pay, find ample seating and pick a good variety of food/drinks at the kid friendly buffet (pizza, pasta, fried chicken, salad bar and desserts) fairly quickly.  The food isn't spectacular by any means but if you have toddlers, fast casual works well.  I was very impressed w/ the size and layout of the place.  They have a good variety of games geared for toddlers along w/ some that would keep a tween pretty happy.  My 3yr old loved the glow bowling, it was the perfect size for him.  The bowling requires 6 credits for 5 frames.  My cousin's 4yr old loved the glow mini-golf which requires 10 credits. Majority of the ticket awarding games require 2-3 credits to play.  They had some toddler rides that require 3 credits and some larger rides that had height requirements that require 10 credits.  The staff were quite meticulous about ensuring that each child met the height requirements, good for safety.  The prize selection was larger and better than most kid friendly arcades.  Our total came to ~$56 w/ our 10% military discount on the food/drinks (2 adult weekday buffets, 1 child buffet, 3 drinks and a $24.99 fun card yielding 125 credits and 2 free rides).

1704052,2016-01-18,1,Ql0iiHl2xpIwtkuC255Wiw,"TLDR: This place helps fill the hole left in the city by the closing of the original GameWorks (which the new one my family calls ChicBarWorks), and is our new favorite to-do. We will be going here again!


We didn't even know this place had opened until we saw a billboard. So we decided to have a late night Sunday adventure.

The place was packed and had a long line, but it was moving fast so that didn't deter us. One of the workers even came out with breadsticks to help keep everyone in a good mood. I never saw a place do this before, and it certainly helped keeping my autistic sons and their friend happy.

They have all dining rooms and rides, whereas what my cousin from Victorville was telling me the one she grew up with didn't have as many options.

The plus side about it being busy is that the food is fresher (although the pasta was cold, at least what I had), and the waiters are picking up dishes and trash often. The pumpkin bars are my favorite, and the apple ones are good as well. The brownies and cheesecake were so good (apparently) that they went fast. Managed to get some cheesecake and was disappointed because it tasted more like a sort of instant custard and didn't taste like cheesecake (rest of my group liked it). The staff was also very kind to my boys.

The downside, as expected on both a weekend and night before a holiday-it is so crowded. When people finally get their turn on a game, especially the ones where most rounds are very short, kids seem patient to let that person play more, while the grown ups snort and are rude if the person at the panel wants to play at least one more time. [Welcome to Vegas, we're full of rude people. I don't down vote places for this.]

Also someone's toddler ran off-thankfully the other lady who was next to me when the little girl came up to us was helping me look for the mum and they were reunited before I could bring her to a worker. Be careful of your smallest ones when it's busy!

Again, the cons were because it's a weekend and the night before holiday. So of course it was packed.

Also, it's very cold outside in the city, but very hot in the restaurant. I brought a sweater expecting it to be cold like Chuck E. Cheese's. Just a heads up for others.",w8N0kRTYwhmny3w2rO-pgA,0,0,5,A5QmSe1Eh-3GGvqjiLzGVw
1708466,2018-04-09,0,Ql0iiHl2xpIwtkuC255Wiw,"This is one of my 5 year old son's favorite places. We took him here on a Saturday to reward him for playing well in baseball. For our family of five (husband, me, a five year old, and a one year old), the bill was $69. Sometimes we get coupons via emails, so make sure you subscribe if you want discount. Our bill included buffet, 115 credits + 2 rides, and VIP card renewal. 
We arrived at 7 pm, and it felt like we were late to a party lol. There were still food, but half of the trays were empty. Salad bar was sad today. Last time we came, they had chopped, hard-boiled eggs as topping. There was none this time. All salad toppings this time were straight up from cans. There were corns, pickled jalapeños, tiny ham bits, olives, and diced tomatoes. 
Pasta & More bar was ok. There were Mac n cheese, pasta and tomato sauce, pot pie chowder, loaded potato chowder, whole baked potatoes, fried chicken drumsticks, roasted cauliflower and green pepper, and breadsticks. Roasted cauliflower and the loaded potato chowder were my favorites. Fried drumstick was the only meat dish, so it ran out fast. 
Pizza bar was a hit for my son. There were cheese, pepperoni, chicken fajitas, jalapeño pizzas. My sons were so excited to start playing that they couldn't focus on eating. They were done after a slice each. We decided to save dessert until after the games. 
The game arcade was amazing! There were many, many, many games for all ages. Shooting games, racing games, air hockey, bowling, basket ball, angry bird, etc. The kids didn't really care about redeeming points for presents as they had a great time with the games.

1769581,2017-01-28,0,Ql0iiHl2xpIwtkuC255Wiw,"Went here for the first time today, and it was not nearly as bad as the other reviews said.  You go through a maze to get to the cashiers, similar to Golden Coral.  You pay for the buffet, which is a requirement to get in.  Adults and Kids 13 and over are about 11.49, this does not include drinks, but you will have to buy a drink.  I do agree it is kind of silly and they should just include it in the price even if they have to raise all the prices. Drinks are $1.99, and your choices include soda, coffee and slushies.  They do sell alcohol but that is a separate counter once you get in. You also pay for your game/ride tokens at the same time, which will get loaded to a card, similar to Dave & Busters and Game Works and even Chuck E. Cheese now.  They charge you 50 cents for a card.  There are three different costs for kids, I think 2 and under are free with a paying adult, 2-7 is another cost and Age 7-12 is 7.49.

The salad was the usual buffet salad bar. The only disappointment was the imitation bacon bits and not the real thing.  They have pasta, bread sticks, baked potatoes, rice, mashed potato, chicken, pizza, and a large variety of desserts.  I would say the only few things that were annoying was there was never sour cream for the baked potato, the butter was frozen and literally impossible to get out of the container to put on my potato and the noodles tasted water logged from boiling too long.  The pizza was way better than Chuck E. Cheese and I'd say better than CiCi's.

Now for the games and rides.  All rides have a button to push, so if there is no attendant and you want to ride, all we did was push the button and by the time there was worker we had enough people to ride the ride.  There was only two games that did not work, Fruit Ninja and a crane game to get dinosaurs.  The prices for the games were very reasonable, with the majority averaging 3 credits.  The games were alot like the ones at Dave & Busters, cost less to play but you get less tickets.  

As for the employees, they are all pretty much high school and college kids.  I cannot recall seeing anyone over 25 working there.  They did not go out of their way to be friendly, but every one we engaged with (at least 4 separate ones) were pleasant and polite and helpful with whatever issue we had.

We will for sure go here again, not as much as Dave & Busters but that is because it is not in the best neighborhood.  Leaving at 9 pm on a Friday night was interesting for sure.",0gXtDaDscQPs8tp-gckMiA,3,1,4,vLAdJo8j4ixGgk-KxIUShw

If you could just include the soda price with the buffet price it would stream line your bottom line and profits. Doesn't make sense to eat with drinks. VIP program could use more work. 

it would be nice if you hired some adults rather than people who appear to be in their teens. I understand it is a minimum wage job so you will get a lot of teen. But balance out the credibility of the staff by hiring some adults. You will see the difference.

Dishwashing could use a lot of work. I am tempted to bring my own cutlery and dishware because I've picked up ""clean dishes"" that still had food residue. Yikes!

I was super impressed with this place. Reasonable price, all you can eat and drink, and plenty of games and a few rides!

FOOD
All you can eat fried chicken, need I say more? Ok, well also fun pizzas constantly being served like Thai pizza, Chicken Quesadilla, BBQ, and others. They even had fresh made donuts, cinnamon buns, and a solid salad bar with rare toppings like garbanzo and beets (and everything in between). Oh yeah, and the bread sticks were amazing!

GAMES
I love the e-ticket system. Unlike other arcades that spit out paper tickets, which you then have to hold onto, and have counted, this place tracks them all electronically. Swipe your play card, and forget it. It basically becomes a rewards credit card, which is really convenient. They even have cool little bonus is like a dance party that brings out with their mascot, then throws out free tickets at the end. And when you redeem your tickets, it seems like they round up whatever remainder you have at the end, to make sure you get to use every last one.

FINAL THOUGHTS
I was also impressed at how big this place was. I never had to wait for food, or games, or drinks, or anything else.

First off it took a looong time to pay and get in even though we were first in line. Next, after seeing that it was $11 they tell us that drinks are $2 extra.. Just to get in... The games I suppose are extra. Once we got in we found the rooms were very cute and we chose the cabin themed one. I read on here that there servers come around often. We were there about a half hour and I never saw the server. The food was also a mix. The pizza selection seemed good, but they were out of a bunch of them and most of the others were cold. I did manage to get a piece of a semi warm bbq slice and it was actually pretty good. Later I tried the pepperoni which was fresh and that was decent. I liked the chicken legs, mashed potatoes and corn though. 
Then the weird stuff: a fight broke out near us by the mini golf and a bunch of the help had to break it up. We decided to work up the courage to try some games and they were fun. Of course that's after we had a problem with the air hockey game where there wasn't a puck to be found. So after putting in 6 credits without being able to play someone had to come help us. She was very nice and did fix it and gave us our credits back. Much nicer than the guy who told us that since we didn't mention that we signed up online at the front right away it was too late to give us the 10 free credits that we were promised. Totally lame and frustrating. So, I guess I'll round up to 3 stars and chalk it up to opening problems. However, I'm not sure I see paying all that money for cheap food for the right to overpay some more for the games.

2076991,2016-06-13,0,Ql0iiHl2xpIwtkuC255Wiw,"Went here yesterday for an end of the year party for our Troop. First off they put us in a party room that was too small for our party so not everyone could even sit down and eat. Then they tried to do party games with our 18 kids and trying to do them in a small corner of the room was ridiculous. Half the kids couldn't even get any tickets or balloon animals.

Now for the food. I've been here 3 times before and this was quite possible the worst the buffet yesterday. First off there was very little selection and the workers told us fat we had to ask for any pizza that wasn't out there. What? You don't have plain cheese or pepperoni pizza in a pizza buffet? Then we asked for a pizza and that took forever to make! We also asked for a second soup (the potato one) and it took almost an hour for them to ""make"" it and then they literally put out one bowl. Not a pot, but enough to fill one bowl. My girls asked if they were going to put out any more desserts (there was a chocolate cake but some idiot had let their child smash all the pieces with the tongs.)  and they said ""no we aren't wasting food."" Seriously? Is this food coming out of their mouth? Not to mention this is Vegas, I can spend $14 and go to a real buffet where I don't have to ask for food to be made and can actually eat more than one slice.

The games were good, most in good repair, the kids always like the rides. However claiming our tickets was a total nightmare. The scanner gun wasn't working. Then we tried to combine 2 cards and she accidentally erased all the credits!!! What?! Then the manager came but didn't know how to put them back on so they gave us paper tickets to go feed into the machine and put back on the card. So because of your mistake I now have to work twice as hard for some cheap toy. You can't just take the card and give me the toy?

Needless to say the kids like it because I don't think they care about anything, but the logistical nightmare of this place is ridiculous. You have multiple people working there that I think are just there to make it seem like there's workers but don't really do anything.

BUT... 
Came here for a party on a Sunday afternoon, and it was CRAZY busy. As in, watch your step or you'll probably trip over someone. 

When we first got here, seems like they were able to keep the food up with the crowd... But by the time we were about ready to leave a couple hours later, there were lots of ppl waiting around empty food displays.. And, only one ice cream dispenser was working at first, by the time we left, that one wasn't working either. Otherwise, I kinda like their buffet, especially for a kid party. But they have a decent salad bar with the lettuce looking clean and crisp.. And I like their Alfredo pizza, garlicky! 

The play area is huge, geared mostly for grade school kids, but there's also a few games and a play area for the younger ones... A noticed several games ""out of order"", which is kinda surprising given that this place is relatively new... 

So I think this place is a decent place to bring your kids, on a not so busy day (if that exists in this town). They may still need to work on how to handle the crowd.. 

And some tips for you PARENTS... 

Teach your kids to share! If they see a line of kids waiting to play a game, don't sit there playing it OVER & over... Play it once (or maybe even twice) then get back at the end of the line! 

And... 

Just because you are ""all together"" in a group, doesn't give the 5 of you the right to cut in front of the long line of waiting KIDS, because you decided to join the ONE lady and kid actually waiting in line (in front of me). So yea, the passive me spoke up, and yea, I didn't let you cut. That's just rude! I swear my earrings were about to come off, hold my purse! Haha totally jk.

So more then a few times tonight my kids waited until someone showed up to be able to get on the very few rides they have. I understand that business demands dictate staffing, but what's the point of me purchasing unlimited rides for 3 hours when your rides aren't being offered at an unlimited pace? I'd definitely seek out other kid friendly places before spending money here again.",zfDcvo9F7d9fAA_hWcBC5Q,3,0,1,ikbKu2Ir89DniyYowG6YjQ

Lots of options at least.  There's a bar that serves beer, wine and margaritas which you might need after being here for awhile.  Every time we have been it has been busy, like a madhouse.

2597008,2016-01-31,1,Ql0iiHl2xpIwtkuC255Wiw,"I could not wait for this place to open. I have been to two of these in California and they were so much. The variety of pizza and games was so fun. I was able to go to this location a few days after it had opened and I was very disappointed. I had talked this place up to my family and my son so much they were very excited as well. Of course there was a long line but we got through it pretty fast. They even handed out fresh bread sticks while we waited. Once we got in we found a room with movie screens all over with cartoons and other things to keep kids entertained. I thought that was great but the audio was to loud and it made hard to talk across the table. The buffet was ok, they had a hard time keeping up with the pizza and people were waiting around for certain pizzas. The bread sticks on the buffet line were the opposite of the ones we got in line because they were dry and crunchy. When we went for dessert my son wanted only ice cream and of course both of their machines had signs saying they were out of order. While picking the dessert we wanted we saw people trying the ice cream machines and they were working fine. Yet they had signs saying out of order. We got out to the games next and started looking over how everything worked. It was a bit confusing because sometimes the card readers didnt work and we wondered how e-tickets worked. All of the games were fun and the rides were pretty cool. Definitely a step up from chuck e cheese and game works. The one thing I didnt like was paying 2.50 for the mini golf ball then having to give it back at the end on the last hole. There were just so many people there that night it wasnt much fun at all. I figured we could go back and do it during the day mid week.

So a few weeks later I took my son mid day on a thursday. As we were paying I saw the manager asking our cashier questions on how the packages worked and how to bill customers out for it, he had interrupted about 3 times. Once we got in it was so nice and very relaxed compared to the first time. When we went to the buffet I noticed that 5-6 different spots for pizza just had covers on them and were not being used. The variety of pizza was almost half of dinner time which was frustrating because the price was the same as dinner but with less selection. When walking back to our seats I saw the same manager cleaning the bar area and acting as if he was working the bar, which I thought was weird. We ate and went to play a few games, when we came back our entire table was cleaned off. They told us to leave our ticket face up and they wouldnt clean the table, but they did. so we went back and got for more food. While eating we needed more napkins so we got up to grab more napkins and they cleaned our table again before we got back. I went and complained to the manage and he said they are just short staffed today and the staff was just trying to stay on top of it. We went back out to do more game and some of the card readers were not working. We tried to go do the bowling and that same manager was there with another worker walking up and down the lanes and in the back of the alleys. I asked if we could use the lanes and they said there was only one ball and they did not know where the rest of the bowling balls went. They said it appeared someone may have stole them! The manager said he was looking around trying to find them but as we walked out I looked up and there was a camera in the bowling area, not sure why he was standing there scratching his head instead of looking at tape. We decided to go get dessert and come back to the games in a little bit. We got a few things and of course when we got back our table was cleared again. As we ate I my son got ice cream on his hands so we got up really quick and went to the bathroom to wash our hands. The sinks are very unique, they have a hand dryer and water faucet combo, its very cool but doesnt work well. its very obvious how they work but the dryer part would not stay on and kept shutting off. It was very frustrating but we got all cleaned up really quick and headed back to our table. And you guessed it, they cleaned our table. We were gone maybe a minute and a half. I went back up to the same manager and told him they cleaned our table again and how it was so frustrating they kept cleaning our table even when we got up to clean our hands really fast. He again said they are just trying to stay on top of it, he didnt even apologize for what was happening. I told him This was so frustrating that we were just going to leave and he said he would go talk to the staff, the same thing he said to us earlier and it did nothing. I was very disappointed once again with this place so we will not be back for a long time. Hopefully its just the beginning and they can get the kinks worked out and we can try it later. As for now I am sticking the chuck e cheese. Even my son said he liked chuck e cheese better and hes 4, hes an expert on these places.",aOxAgDrmOt0yJ9KjY-UkhQ,1,1,2,2KNkHAcnG_kKcfJUEiOowg

2618245,2016-01-20,6,Ql0iiHl2xpIwtkuC255Wiw,"The Urban Legend of this place called John's Incredible Pizza came to light about two years ago when someone told me they serve a PB&J Pizza.  While driving down Maryland Parkway last week I saw this flashy facade that looked like the Children's Discovery Museum.  I had to do a double take and I am glad that I did otherwise I would have never discovered this new family fun center others have been boasting about.  

The perfect day to come was a rare rainy Tuesday afternoon.  Upon entering we we impressed by the sheer size of this facility.  After purchasing everyone's meal pass we went right for the food to keep the fun zone hidden from the kids otherwise we would never get them to eat.  John's Incredible is a buffet style restaurant that has a great selection of salad bar items, pizza, pasta, dessert and beverages.  For one price of $12+ for adults and $5 for kids, you can stuff your face and afterwards you can go have a great time in the fun center.  

I really enjoyed the salad bar section.  All items were fresh and diced so you can have great topping distribution.  They have at least 6 different types of noodles and several sauces for endless pasta creations.  The bread sticks are huge and they also have other dinner items like soups, baked potatoes, chicken, rice, and steamed veggies.  All food is labeled clearly for dietary restrictions like vegetarian and gluten free, I think that is a huge plus for this brand. They have so much food its INCREDIBLY overwhelming.  

The pizza choices reminded me exactly like Cici's combinations.  For example, Fiesta Pizza, Cheeseburger, Alfredo, Chicken Alfredo, Pep + Jalapeno, Ham +Pineapple, Pepperoni, Chili pizza,Spicy Peanut Butter and Garlic Pesto were some of the offering's.  The pizza is by no means incredible.... but it is edible.  Kitchen workers were working hard to keep everything fresh and well stocked.  The crust and sauce were the downfalls for these pies in my opinion.  The slices were to small and floppy and I prefer a more crispy crust.

And if you did not get enough food off the salad and pizza buffet line John's hits you with a huge selection of sweet treats in the dessert line.  Items like, cookies and cream cakes, brownies, cinnamon rolls, apple crisp, peach cobbler, fruit salad, coolies and even ice cream.  WOW! there is a lot of food to choose from at John's.  The place is so big they have 6-7 different themed dining rooms that I am assuming you can rent out for birthday parties and such.  Once you clean your plate then you get to go play in the game center.

I was surprised to see the different high quality games that can be played here.  No dirty coins or money accepted here.  All games require a special credit type card that can be swiped to play each game.  Each game varies in cost from 2-6 credits, rides vary from 8-10 credits.  My favorite was the ""Boogie Bump"" which is a 21st century version of bumper cars.  I could have ridden those all day.  They also have mini bowling lanes, glow mini golf, a tornado type ride that spins, and also a toddler area for the little babies to have fun.  We were only able to be here for about an hour because of a school night but we will be back to John's Incredible Pizza because the entire family had a blast. I think we might do our next Birthday Party here.",8fsZcLADFrPTbGrFqMACpg,12,7,5,iMPNDDf82uOtAmbz7Zx1bA

Here's the lowdown.

Adults 13 and older: $11.49
Seniors 55 and older: $10.49
Kids 2 and under: Free with paying adult
Kids 3 to 6: $5.29
Kids 7 to 12: $7.29

Weekday Lunch Special Monday through Friday 11 am to 3 pm
Adults: $8.29 Seniors: $7.29

Military Discount for members, their spouse and children are 10 percent off with ID.

There is an express entrance meaning you skip the line and walk right in. This is an online purchase only for an additional purchase of 5 bucks a person.

They serve alcohol which in my opinion is a bad thing.

Beer (Blue Moon, Bud Light, Dos Equis Lager, Lagunitas, Stella Artois)
Regular $5.29
Large $7.29

Wine By The Glass (Robert Mondavi: Chardonnay, Merlot, Moscato)
$8.29

Margaritas (Lime or Strawberry)
$5.29

As I mentioned above, the fact that there is alcohol available here is not a good idea. How are you gonna look after your kids if you are buzzin or worse yet, drunk. Then you have to worry about driving home safely. Im surprised I havent heard more stories of people fighting because they are drunk. 

As for the food, its similar to Cici's Pizza but with a little more options and the quality is just slightly better.

Service wise it is also similar to Cici's and Chuck E Cheese. The staff tries to keep up with the cleaning of tables and the floors but people nowadays are just pigs when it comes to not caring just how much of a mess they make.

The number one gripe I have with this place is that the supply for the demand is not always met in an orderly manner especially when it gets really busy. Sometimes you will see people just standing there waiting for things to be replenished. To add to that, if there are no available tables for people just now showing up, you have a 2 hour limit at the table you are sitting at. I have been here about 4 times and it happened twice where we had to leave our table after about 2 hours because new incoming people did not have a table to sit at. Given the fact that most of the employees are teenagers still in high school, the way the place is run is sometimes very questionable.

In closing, I rank this place slightly higher than Cici's and Chuck E Cheese. All three places you will never find more positives than negatives. If these guys resolve the supply demand and keep the place alcohol free this would easily be a 4 star review. Until then, It's just an ok place to come to occasionally.

The place was filthy. The buffet had food everywhere, the tables were gross, and the floor of the dining room I was in was covered in food..not crumbs, food. I am assuming the majority of this has to do with the people who were there, if you drop a whole slice of pizza on the ground you should probably pick it up! A good 1/3 of the games were not working, they either said please stand by, closed or were dark. With the place as busy as it was that meant long lines. There were no employees on the floor trying to fix these issues.

The fact that there is only one location for this place and it's in a ""Not so great"" part of town doesn't help at all. I've been here 3 times already but and my experience has been the same. Super chaotic with kids running everywhere with no super vision from parents. The drink area is always a sticky mess again kids come and drop and spill their drinks and no one to clean it up. I would say the same thing with the food area. I couldn't keep track off how many times I've seen children with no parents come up and grab a pizza slice with their bare hands or just to throw it back with the rest of the pizza. Very unsanitary, you're just asking to get sick. The pizza was okay most of the pizza was stale unless you got lucky and mange to get one right out of the oven. I would say that the chicken here is pretty good but a negative is that as soon as it comes out, it's usually gone within seconds!  The staff here just looks miserable like they don't want to be there. I understand most of them are teenagers but you still have to keep up with customer service.   


I would definitely like to see them open up other locations in the Spring valley,  and Henderson area. Just to see what a difference other areas can do for their business. Picking this side of town was a poor mistake. 

Overall I wish the business would in prove it's services. My nieces did enjoy the games over all. But I would rather have take them to chuck e cheese  or Gameworks",cr-55PYWbRGKrjultAdoHA,1,0,1,V_8BsiOA5KPZpXM7-rQiiQ

For the adults they do serve beer and wine for an extra charge.

Lots of seating with different themed rooms.  You can watch cartoons, kids movies or even the game depending which area you sit at.

The assortment of various games is normal.  They have miniature golf, bowling and a couple rides that you wouldn't normally see indoors.  They do the play games for tickets thing here - but keep track of them in your game card (purchase with a food package, or separately).

We were taken to the party room pretty quickly which was great. We only have limited Time to spend in the room and also to have fun with the games and rides, our time was from 8-11pm. Once we leave the party room and start up our game cards we can not re-enter the party room which is a bummer. The 3 girls that were helping us had no clue what they were doing. They did not even know how to work the radio which took time from playing the ""games"" that were chosen for the kids to play.

Once we got out to the arcade area and the kids received their game cards. They went crazy and of course, as kids that they are, couple of them lost their card. Their game card system should be reevaluated because.. Once we told a worker it was lost, they blindly deactivated a card that ""might have"" been the one that was lost but not 100% sure. He just deactivated the one that was used on the last ride it was used on BUT a few of the kids were also on that ride too! The one that got deactivated was actually the BIRTHDAY GIRL'S! So a suggestion, have the cards be specifically named for the person not just card 1, 2 or 3. 

The buffet portion of the restaurant is pretty awesome. They have different types of pizza, pasta, salads, lots of desserts. Also they have Icee for the kids which is pretty cool. They also have alcohol for the big kids lol. That gets a star for sure.

2984950,2016-05-26,4,Ql0iiHl2xpIwtkuC255Wiw,"There is nothing incredible about John's Incredible Pizza. We wanted to take our 3 year old somewhere new today so we tried out John's. The price point was higher than I expected at $12.98 for adults with a drink. I was optimistic when I saw the 4 food buffets, but that didn't last long. Pizza is the obvious staple on a pizza buffet and it was all wrong. The pizzas at John's are cut 10 times instead of the standard 5 cuts for a medium pie. What you end up with are thin micro slices that are not fun to deal with. Another mistake is that the cutter did not cut all the way through to the ends so when you dish up a slice, all of the pieces stick together which again is not fun to deal with. Every single pizza was cut that way. All of the pizzas I tried were doughy and undercooked. One bite was all I could choke down of each pizza.

     I decided to try some of the soups, figuring I could fill up on something before I go. The baked potato soup was watery and broken down because it had set on the buffet too long.
I moved on to the Fiesta soup and it was the exact same, watery and broken down. I thought ok, I'll try some salad bar and get my family out of this place. When I got to the salad bar, I noticed that all of the veggies were micro cut (Apparently that's a thing at John's). The tomatoes were diced too small and were breaking down into mush. The ham was the same way.

     When I got back to the table my 3 year old spilled her water on the booth seat and some ice spilled on the floor. I tracked down a kid to help clean up the spill. When he came back with towel in hand he saw the ice on the floor and immediately went to get a mop instead of wiping off the booth first. 
We had to stand there and wait another two minutes for him to return.

     The food at John's is low quality. Be prepared to be underwhelmed if you try them out.",m1-HNN4pghUqDIKr2FUcmw,3,0,1,IoTOT9TO6l2csKAMi5T87A

They have nine TVs that create this big screen, any sports fan's dream. They make pizzas on demand.  They have tons of awesome games and digital tickets to boot.

- keep those arcade games updated! You purchased the latest machines but having them at old versions is no good!

There was a long line to pay, and I  realized it was a holiday and we may have erred, but we were already jammed in with at least four families cramming in behind us, so we decided to tough it out.

And tough you must be to make it through a night in this hellhole of disorganization. The median age of the employees appeared to be about 17, and they all had the enthusiasm of teenagers everywhere who are working for minimum wage and would rather be anywhere else.

The place is actually pretty clean, but suspect that is more a testament to its relative newness than to any effort put in by the staff.  The buffet had a lot of items - correction: the buffet had spaces for a lot of items. The salad bar boasted empty containers of mushrooms, cucumbers, croutons, vinaigrette, and ranch. Two varieties of soup were offered, but only one pot actually contained any. The pizzas were the cheap, puffy, doughy kind with a faint reddish smear of sauce and a few scattered ingredients, and were torn apart by grimy little grasping hands as soon as they appeared. They also had fried chicken (I saw only legs), and signs indicated there were mashed potatoes, corn, croquettes, and other sides to be had, but those were also an illusion. 

There actually were some bread sticks, of quality comparable to the Olive Garden, which floats some people's boats, and a few varieties of pasta and some empty sauce pots.

The dessert bar featured a tray of what had been apple crisp in another life, but was now a few mummified fragments of brown fruit studded with a couple of hardened clumps of oatmeal. ""Cheesecake"" was the kind you make from a mix and doesn't require baking, (there were two pieces, both flopped upside down and smashed and abandoned), and some dry and tasteless squares of something that claimed to some sort of peach delight. Hmmm.

On the other hand, one of the more ambitious employees had just got around to replacing the cinnamon rolls (warm, sweet, and gooey), fresh warm chocolate chip cookies that weren't half bad, and some little freshly fried donuts that were fluffy on the inside and just a little crispy/greasy n the outside. OK then.

The soft serve (I hesitate to call it ice cream) machines were labeled to give the impression that chocolate and swirl flavors were available, but only the vanilla worked.

So, I was not pleased that we had paid for a mandatory buffet that was mostly non-existent, but figured most of the staff must have been assigned to the ""Fun World"" attractions in the back. Ha!

You guessed it - the line for the (very fun looking) bumper cars was snaking around since about half of them didn't work, and just when Little guy got to the front, they decided to stop and fix them. Fine, except ""fixing"" involved a lot of idle chatter and standing around. The little teacup ride wasn't working at all, nor were about a third of the games. The situation was exacerbated by the size of the crowd; you had to wait like a vulture and grab at anything that opened up, whether it was what the kids wanted to play or not. 

We were so irritated that no way were we gong to wait for the lackadaisical attendants at the prize desk to cash in for some crappy prizes, so we were just gong to grab a balloon for Little girl at the stand on the way out. Guess what- they don't take cash- they want you to get back in line.  No thanks. Never again.",-qj9ouN0bzMXz1vfEslG-A,9,3,2,reDPhwTqWSGp3RJen1Ge2A

First we had salad and pizza at the buffet. To my surprise the salad bar was really good.  Lettuce was crisp and they had all the veggies you would expect and more.  The pizza was just okay, the slices are small and the pizza is a little doughy.  I liked the chicken alfredo and he had the pepperoni.  They also had pasta, a few other sides and fried chicken.  I would've tried the fried chicken but it looked absolutely disgusting, like some steroid genetically modified meat.  The whole time we visited the salad bar I noticed an employee near by keeping the area clean and another employee stopped by our table to clear dishes.  Now on to the fun. They had all the games you would commonly find at Grand Prix or Chuck E Cheese as well as games I never played before.  I really like how the points go on your card for redemption instead of spitting out tickets.  We played almost every game and I didn't encounter one game that was out of service.

We go bowling all the time so their little fake bowling alley was lame.  The bumper cars was so much fun and there was no waiting for any ride or game.  On the way out we had swirl ice cream.  The ice cream dispenser is too fast which causes a mess but an employee came right over when we left to clean the tray.  John's Incredible Pizza is definitely a step up from Chuck E Cheese.  For maximum enjoyment go during the week when they first open.",putDIQFiBXhEJCe-AYe_YA,0,0,5,WgqujDGGDUyk14S9UjxIzQ

We had a family gathering here for my nephews 10th birthday. My 80 year old grandmother who was only attending for the joy of celebrating with her family was not allowed in without paying for a full price buffet even though she had no intentions of eating. After speaking to a ""manager"" they decided to allow her entry but only after being forced to pay a $2 fee... unacceptable...

NONE of the food was stocked. When we asked where the food was we got nothing but attitude from the kids working who seemed like we were bothering them by asking for the food we paid for. There were 10 different kids of desserts listed, 7 of which were empty. We were told the items had to be made and one hour later they made EIGHT cinnamon rolls. There is three times that amount of people in our party alone. 

The silverware, trays and plates were not clean at all. You do get what you pay for but for the $12 (that you're forced to pay to celebrate a family members birthday) you shouldn't have to worry about hygiene and germs.

I only really liked the chicken & rice, fried chicken, and salad bar was somewhat decent. They have icees! : white cherry flavor is the best. The pizza was doughy(inedible), the dessert did not taste good: the flavor and freshness was unsatisfactory.

We were told that their mascot was going to come into the room to say happy birthday to our son..they didn't. They played a few games in the room but had to move tables to play.  Seemed to be a little unorganized especially when Amber asked my wife to be in charge of the music system during the games. We had ordered two pizzas that came out the same time they brought our cake into the room (after about 20 minutes) so we had requested if we could take it home with us. Amber came back into the room with a white 13 gallon kitchen trash bag and said that her manager said to give it to us to use..definitely a bad first impression when this happened.

The buffet selection was pretty good too & quite delicious. You even see them toss out old pizza (even if it's a whole pizza) ensuring that what they're serving is fresh. Don't expect Bacchanal, but I'd say their food was WAAAAYY better than Chucke E. Cheese's & Cici's Pizza.

They even allow you stay after your party is done, and they have ample seats & tables.

Second : the food area was a disgrace all you can eat buffet yeah right the salad bar was half empty no spinach no garbanzo beans no ranch no carrots etc then the pizza station everything said will make on special request their was only four different pizzas out. The brocolli cheddar sauce looked so old then I took a picture of the floor behind it and their was all kinds of good on the floor. They only had 1 person working all 3 stations clearly understaffed or poorly managed. Then off to the gsmes they have the candy crush game and I won the jackpot and the game froze called customer service over and he seen it and said wow congratulations but I can only give you your credits back sry and I was like that's not fair and he said that was the rules but to top it off this place offers bday parties and etc and when I ask for matches or something to light the bday cake with the manager told me I'm sorry it's against the rules to light anything in the building.

My nine year old daughter returned from camp today at 10:00am.
She wanted a buffet for lunch.

What she got was John's Incredible Pizza Company.

Salad, Pizza, and other pasta dishes are served buffet style just like CiCi's. The chicken Alfredo pizza was good. The barbecue pizza, little heavy on the sauce.
I went back for seconds in regard to salad. One slice of pepperoni was a bit extra greasy.

There is an amusement side to things. Plenty of games and tickets to be won, Chuck E. Cheese style. There are also rides, a tilt-a-whirl style ride that takes you counter clockwise for a good minute and a half. A bumper car style ride. (FUN!) A 9 hole mini golf course. Mini- (Duck Pin Style) Bowling. The lane I was using for the mini-bowling game had trouble resetting the pins. I had to walk over to the prize counter to get it reset. Kind of an inconvenience. A person dressed in a mascot / bear costume came out to make an appearance. I heard no announcement or anything. Just came out of nowhere.

The food is okay at best. The kids had fun in the amusement center. Service however did not impress. The staff seemed to be just running through the motions. No one seemed to be motivated.

Walk over to the buffet 1 pizza sitting there stale and hard as a rock ! Asked for pizza and they said $10 mins 
Walk over to the pasta section , pasta looked brown the Alfredo sauce looked disgusting more brown than white .
Asked for chicken they only fry per request 20 mins ! 
Nothing out in the salad bar . Keep in mind I have 4 kids who are hungry and I bribe them to eat with the games they get to play . So we decide to leave . Ask for a refund they call a manager , young african American lady didn't get her name . She tells me it's over $100 she has to call corporate and that will take about 30 mins or so .... 4 kids hungry ... not to mention we are hungry aswell . So she tells me well I can refund you the food and you keep the fun cards . $60 I had no choice but to agree needed to go feed our kids . So I threw away $60 . Well didn't throw it away gifted it to a horrible company who has no customer service ! 
Of course she kept the original receipt because she ""needed"" it to explain the partial refund . Bullshit !
We leave and I call corporate they supposedly take down everything that happened and will call me back in 2 days .

Meantime we went to Chuck E. Cheese on eastern and 515 fwy ! All you can play $25 for 90 mins soooo much more customer service oriented  here !! Trust me don't waste your time at Johns incredible pizza there is nothing incredible there !!! 

Fast forward to today Thursday the 7th 
Haven't heard back from corporate . So I call them back ! They have no information at all from what happened ! Nothing in the system ! The 20 mins I spent on the phone were all for show ! She didn't input nothing ! Now this lady tells me I can't get a full refund because u have the cards and they don't refund it because I can go and use these cards !!!! That her manager is not in but he would not approve of that ! That she can email me comp buffets and since we didn't like the Las Vegas location we have 90 days from today to go to California to use them in either Montclair or riverside. !!!!!!

Cons: they make u purchase a buffet weather ur eating or not. And that's because it's hard to tell who's paid to eat and who didn't. Second the buffet itself was nothing to jump for joy. The pizza was so so although they have like 8 different choices. They offered a simple salad bar, and some pasta station as well as dessert station.

-The first time I came here was for my God son's 6th birthday party. My family rented a private room. To be honest, it was just okay. For the price they paid, there was nothing special for the kids and the experience wasn't great. 

-The second time I came was for lunch. It was so dirty and messy everywhere. The salad bar was empty (no one refilled it), they kept running out of chicken, the pasta station looked very dry and the ice cream station was so dirty. 

-The third time I came, I decided to celebrate my 35th birthday here since I'm a VIP card holder and I got a free dinner for my birthday. It was about 40 of us. I didn't rent a private room since I didn't see the value in it. I went 1 hour early and just blocked off an area. It was a Thursday night so it was pretty dead anyways. I had a blast for my birthday.

-Order your pizza fresh
-Take a tray of food cause the walk from your table to the food is pretty far

There are no choices of food and there is just one buffet section immediately when you enter and then there are dining room areas with many different themed sections.  This part I actually thought was well thought out, because there was plenty of seating for families of all sizes.

The gaming area is completely saturated by the smell of sweat, dirty socks and not enough arcade games.  I had to constantly wait in line to play a game with my 3 year old son.  Even something as simple as fish tank in a bowl average wait was 5-10 minutes.  There was just too many people and why they picked the Boulevard Mall for this venue beats me.

I do like how everything was setup. You pay at the door then find a place to sit, which there are 5 different rooms for seating.  The prices are $10.99 for adults + $1.99 for beverages and kids are $4.99 age 3-6 and $6.99 age 7-12.

Our group was in party room no.2. It was a little tight with the long table right in the middle of the room while the kids ran around you. Definitely a tight fit. Would have been better if they put the table on one side so the kids can do what kids do on the other side.

The buffet looked ok. Carb overload with different varieties of pizza, pasta and sauces, baked potato, 2 kinds of soup(potato and chicken pot pie today), fried chicken, mashed potatoes and gravy, a salad bar, a dessert area, soft ice cream machines, soda machines, etc.

The chicken pot pie soup was VERY salty. I used it as a dipping sauce for the flavorless fried chicken. Tried a slice of jalapeño pepperoni pizza and it wasn't bad. The pasta didn't look appealing so I stayed away. I did like the salad bar though.

Donuts are fried on site. It got me super excited. Unfortunately, it wasn't very good. Very greasy. 

It takes a while for some items to be replenished but everyone was nice and helpful. 

By 3pm, the place was packed. People crowding the buffet, piling their plates high with pizza, pasta and chicken, one of the ice cream machines was filthy, food on the floor. It was pandemonium! I felt terrible for the staff who were constantly cleaning spills.

All in all, the kids had fun. It was an ok experience for the adults. We were all glad to get out of there when we did.

4044843,2016-02-22,4,Ql0iiHl2xpIwtkuC255Wiw,"Eek indeed.
Somehow I thought this would be a classier version of Cici's pizza. Instead, it's like a more ghetto version of Chuck E Cheese.
The place is huge with multiple huge dining rooms. We went on a holiday Monday around 4:00, and it was packed. We had to go into 3 dining rooms just to find an open table! I can't imagine how it looks on Saturday at lunch or dinner time!
With all those folks wanting to eat, the kitchen needs to be CHURNING OUT some pizza! But they are not. Patrons are waiting 3 and 4 deep for the next pizza to come out to the buffet and then you have to be willing to throw elbows on some kids to get a slice. I got a salad from the salad bar, and they were out of 2 of the 4 dressings! Like completely out. I couldn't even scrape together a tablespoon or so for my sad lettuce. Same with the dessert bar. There are about 6 or 8 different desserts on the buffet, plus soft serve ice cream off to the side. Sounds pretty awesome, right? Not when literally ALL BUT ONE of the dessert stations are empty.
On the plus side, they have fried chicken, and it seemed to be well stocked.
The pizza is ok, when you can get it. I think it's on par with Cici's, which is about all I can possibly expect from a pizza buffet.
Seeing as how there are hundreds of people moving through the buffet area, picking up drinks and foods, there are lots of spills. John's does not have the staff to deal with these spills. There are cones set up everywhere, blocking off sticky areas, which forces the foot traffic around the buffet to be even worse. Plus, it's dirty and off-putting in a restaurant.
The games are ok. I appreciate that it's big and they have a couple rides in there, too, but there were very few games that younger children would enjoy and of those, seriously half were broken. 
$11/adult.
Glad we checked it out, but I won't be back.",YIMeEHUYm69m-Mqf-NjPHw,5,3,1,J-i5XSCDqa6yTyHkoAgpqw
4063019,2018-03-22,17,Ql0iiHl2xpIwtkuC255Wiw,"This review is for the buffet part only. 

When I lived in Vegas back when the announcement came out that they were building a John's Incredible Pizza Company, I was so excited as I've been to several in California and always had a good experience. I love the selection you get here compared to other pizza buffet places like CiCi's. 

From the first time I came into here to coming back after 2 years of being away, I have to say, for the most part, they are very consistent. Prices have gone up a buck or two since they first opened, but for what they offer, I guess it makes up for it. Prices are as follows:

Adults (13+) $11.99 - Lunch special $8.49
Seniors $10.99 - Lunch special $7.49
Kids (3-6) $5.49
Kids (7-12) $7.49

Lunch special is Monday thru Friday 11 am to 3 pm. Beverages don't come with the buffet and is another $1.99 for soft drinks, teas, coffee, and ICEE. I do believe the children's buffet does come with a drink.

As far as the buffet goes, they have a big salad bar with a salad mix, romaine lettuce, tons of toppings from your favorite items like carrots, tomatoes, olives, peas, broccoli, cucumbers, corn, garbanzos, mushrooms, jalapenos, and much more. They have different dressings, and several different premade salads (bean, pasta, etc) as well on their salad bar. 

The pizza part of the buffet is always filled with popular pizzas like cheese, pepperoni, Chicken Alfredo, nacho cheese, buffalo chicken, Fiesta, Hawaiian, and even a pizza called Spicy Peanut Butter!! A lot of their pizzas are available on request, which I always ask for veggie, my personal favorite. 

They also have several pasta choices, fried chicken, mashed potato and gravy, baked beans, several soups, and desserts. 

A nice thing about this place is that they all several different dining rooms all with a different theme to them. Toon Time, Cabin Fever, Hall of Fame, Fusion, Kaleidoscope, and Fun World Cafe. My favorite room is Fusion. Love listening to music while I eat. 

If you come during the week, the place is usually not busy, the tables get cleaned off quickly and employees are able to keep hot fresh food out. Weekends get crazy and many times pizza is all out and when they do get a pizza or two out, someone comes and takes practically all of it!

4146958,2016-01-28,6,Ql0iiHl2xpIwtkuC255Wiw,"John's Incredible Pizza Co. is almost a unique place.  I can best describe it as Chuck E. Cheese's meets Cici's Pizza.  Though John's takes the best ideas of each and improves upon them.  

The Chuck E. Cheese aspect is in the arcade section in the back of John's.  There are standard arcade games like the type that you shoot aliens or fly hover cars around a race track.  There are further arcade game still.  The type that give you tickets for your winnings.  But these are all updated games new(ish) to the 21st century.  I believe I saw such current obsessions like Angry Birds.  If it is not enough to have built upon the gaming aspect of Chuck E. Cheese, John's has added rides like bumper cars and some sort of dizzying spin ride.  They also have a miniature bowling alley and a half hole (9 hole) black light mini golf course.  Taking a page from Dave and Buster's, John's has token cards for all their games and attractions rather than physical coinage.  There is a lot going on here.  It would have been more entertaining if all the various games were functional.  Many weren't which was disappointing.  It was also kind of hot in there given all the people running around and all the arcade games bleeding the local power grid dry.

The Cici's Pizza idea of a pizza buffet is amplified here.  The salad bar has options to choose from both in full salad fixings and dressings.  It is a standard buffet salad bar but a noticeable and appreciated improvement over Cici's.  Some with the pizza.  There are more varieties and better quality pizzas at John's.  I wasn't so sure about it going in but I was impressed.  It isn't the best pizza I've had but also far from the worst.  The food doesn't end here either.  There are several pasta selections.  All pasta is undressed allowing for you the customer to customize your meal by combining one of the many pastas with one of the many sauces.  If Italian food isn't your first choice, there is also fried chicken, mashed potatoes and a few different soups to try.  For dessert, if the crowd has not totally decimated the selection, there is a peaches and cream dessert, fresh baked chocolate chips cookies, cinnamon rolls, and my personal favorite, fresh fried doughnuts which you can watch them make.  Not a bad selection.

There are many different themed rooms for you and your party to be seated in. My group was in the Kaleidoscope room towards the front.  There is a log cabin theme room, a Disney room and some private party rooms.  Probably more that I didn't get to see.  

If you chose to come to John's, be prepared to park a ways away.  And be prepared for a crowd.  This is at the Boulevard Mall and people come in droves.  You'll see families, parents and kids, running wild between the dining rooms, the buffet and the arcade.  It is a zoo akin to an amusement park.  It can be pretty fun especially for kids.  For a guy like me who would rather not be around kids, its a little too much to handle.  I was only there for a nephew's birthday.  I don't think I will make a habit of going but only because it is not a place for me.  For families, you can get some good hours of entertainment and some good food for a fair price.",eOIMO2wT_WbNqmavhnCRxw,3,3,3,GNRYq3_CQk0OjsuJ6q1iog

Most places like this are so dumb because you spend tons of money and cash in 10 tickets for a bouncy ball. I think this is the best arcade as they are very generous with their tickets. The cards are awesome too! No more dealing with actual tickets. We ended up getting three really awesome prizes. My only complaint is the girl behind the prize counter kept waiting on other people even though we had been waiting there for awhile. Not sure why but she just kept helping the line and not us. Finally someone in the line told her that we've been waiting for a long time. She said, ""oh, I'll get to them next."" So strange but we survived. My kids are already asking to go back.

On the second visit we got the VIP card for $5 to get you an extra $5 in ride/game credit every visit. I have to compare it to Chuck E cheese because of its similarities. I have to say John's has way more to offer. My son is terrified of Chuck E and jumps in my arms whether he is a rat or mouse. John's has a bear, but for some reason he is not as scary. My favorite thing is that you get a card with all of your ""tokens"" and you can also get your ""tickets"" on there to redeem prizes. I was always a germ-o-phobe when it came to using all of the coins and my kids would drop them or leave them on the rides. At John's you just swipe and go. I also used tickets to get one of the stretchy wrist bracelets and had them hole punch the players card so that I can attach it to my wrist. So easy! It is nice to have more rides and more area for older kids. There is a good variety with food including pasta's and chicken. The variety in drinks is awesome!

First I guess I should preface this review with the fact  that I'm not familiar with this chain at all and noticed it while we were driving by one day. The sign is very catchy! Kudos to the company for great curb appeal and selling us immediately. When I looked it up I said Wow! It looked like a glorified chuck e cheese, I was instantly sold on the idea and was looking forward to our visit. 

Well today was the day for that visit, Its a Sunday, the day before MLK, I admit probably not the best day to visit but we were determined to have fun and see this place. We had no idea what we were in store for! We just spent 3 long, stressful, hot and sweaty hours there. Let's just say I am not looking forward to our next visit. I will EVENTUALLY patronize this place again but under no circumstance will I EVER GO BACK ON A WEEKEND. EVER. This place was so packed our party of 4 were all a ball of stress from the moment we walked into the doors up until the second we left. I've never left somewhere so eagerly and with such a sigh of relief. 

-Buffet-

The buffet area is one big hot mess! It is situated in the middle of the hallway that connects the front entrance to the gaming area. This hallway not only includes everyone trying to get food but also everyone walking from the front area to the back. There are no lines or any sense of order to the buffet, people just cut in front of you with no regard to anyone but themselves. I am not sure if it's the location but the type of people here were very interesting. Rude and lacking basic manners! Parents who had no control of there children. Children and even some adults just pushing there way by you to grab whatever food they want. Groups who leave there strollers in the middle of the muggy dining areas so you literally have to push strollers out of the way to get to your table. The food gets turned over so fast and there are so many people grabbing food all at the same time that you stand around waiting for it to be replenished. The buffet areas were not as clean as one may want but how could the workers get them any cleaner when there are literally a hundred people shoving there way around and making a mess of things. Buffet area is CHAOTIC! It needs to be double the size and have some order to it. It's one big free for all with a bunch of rude people who lack manners. 

-Games-

The gaming area is great. Huge, lots of games I've never seen before but again it is just so crowded I wondered if this was a joke and we were in Disneyland. I've actually had a more enjoyable time in the heat of the summer at Disneyland on a holiday weekend than I had at this place. Also why is it so damn hot? My whole group including my child were so clammy and uncomfortable. Again, children running wild everywhere. I can't even guess as to how many little kids were unsupervised. While my daughter was playing games we would have random kids come up and stand next to her and just want to take over the game she was playing. Again, parents missing. This happened too many times to count. 

The plastic cards that stores your credits for the games/rides were not very easy to use. You literally have to scan it 2-5 times on each game before it recognizes. Do you know how frustrating that is? To have to slide your card that many times to get it to recognize, was at my wits end. 

Had a unique experience at the bumper cars waiting in line, again a group of young unsupervised kids who just cut in front of us in line. One of their mothers who eventually came up to the front only to yell at the ride operator about how her child was tall enough to ride. ""That the operator didn't measure him right, she was a nurse and she knows how to measure someone"" wtf! Mind you, I am giving you the non graphic, non ghetto version of what was said. 

After all of this we had enough, grabbed our 450 credit pez dispenser from the prize area and beelined for the front exit. On our way out the breeze coming into the front doors was so refreshing that we were happy to be walking into the cold night air! 

I have some questions for the operators of this place! 

Why are there 4 large dining areas that can accommodate an ungodly amount of families but there is only one buffet area?

Why is it so hot and stuffy in the dining areas and gaming areas? 

I want to love your place but I find it hard to get pass all of these things and I hope that it was just a bad night and not the way your place always is.",IGBilULpgNHfKitLfrs7Hw,11,5,2,g0tRIamsU9qS5VKfFpDJzA

She said they always charges for drinks and if you don't want them they will take it off the bill. HELLO I NEVER ASKED FOR A DRINK, DO NOT CHARGE ME FOR SOMETHING I DID NOT SPECIFICALLY ASK FOR. She got rude and offered a refund but said we would have to leave after we got the refund because the buffet was the price of admission and we can't stay if we aren't eating, however I bought play cards for all my kids! Eating an playing are TWO DIFFERENT THINGS!!! I asked her if she would eat any of the food I had on the table, she refused to answer me.  The rice was hard and dried up, mashed potato's had a hard crust on them from sitting.  The yellow corn was literally BROWN and clearly left over from the day before and semi-reheated and put on on the buffet for opening today. So lets move on to the food:  the food on the buffet when they opened was DAY OLD, STALE food!  There was one piece of chicken I took off the buffet solely so I could take a picture of it that literally looked like someone took a bite out of it  then threw it back in the pan! For the entire 2+ hours we were there, the buffet was dirty and most of the food remained old and not replenished.  Corn (yellow corn) was BROWN and shriveled, clearly day old and put back out on the buffet in the morning.  I took LOTS of pictures of how dirty the place was, it was insane!  If what i saw was on the buffet, i can only imagine how bad the kitchen was.  Definitely  someplace the health department needs to keep their eye on!  Literally the corn bread was as hard and stale as a brick, no lie! all of the pasta was dried out, literally dried out and hard, the ""sauces"" they had available had a film over the top of them and were luke warm at best, not even steaming, not hot at all. Some of the sauces had other sauce dripped into them and some actually had crust on the top of them. The soups were old and crusted over as well, and NOT HOT.  Clearly left over from the previous day or days ago!  The nearly non-existent desserts were as stale as everything else. OH and don't get me started on how disgustingly dirty the ice milk machine was! OH holy mold batman, it was so gross it appeared it hadn't been cleaned in weeks, if not months! AND if that wasn't enough there were young teenage employees all around, none of which were doing much just standing around.  In the play area, there was ONE adult working!  Seriously, one adult who had to work 3 of the large rides AND the Prize Area!  Needless to say many unhappy guests! OH and one poor older lady who only spoke spanish and was clearly upset with her service as well could not find anyone to help her.  We tried to help her but we could not speak spanish so we were unable to help her.  When we got home, we called Corporate, they could care less about the rotten dried out food and the overcharges.  We will be taking the pictures and video not only to the Clark County Health Department but also to all four local news stations, and every social media outlet available to spread the word!  Save your money, there are better buffets and better places to take your children for lunch/dinner and fun in this town.  This place was beyond horrific and EVERY SINGLE EMPLOYEE working there needs to be FIRED! No one take pride in their workplace. But that is what you get for minimum wage paying jobs I guess.  GET NEW MANAGEMENT but at the very least hopefully the health department will shut it down ASAP after seeing the video and photographic pics from today!",0ZpApT0cq3Kg0SIwSUKyNQ,1,0,1,4E5dPVBQgcNeolfgZapL9Q

We came in with friends and all of our children on a Saturday night (not the best choice on our part). We stood in a line that wrapped around the outside of the building for 45 minutes (expected). Finally got to the front and paid for our buffet, games and ride fees. The only positive thing I CAN say about this place is the prices are extremely cheap.  

On to the nightmare. Upon walking in, this place is complete CHAOS. Spilled soda every where you walk, lemons on the floor, ice on the floor, RIGHT WHEN YOU WALK IN. The endless ""buffet"" we paid for, was completely empty every. Single. Time. Each time a staff member would replenish a pizza or pasta, it was literally devoured by an over crowd of guests within seconds - no exaggeration. We were able to fight our way for a couple pieces of pepperoni and cheese pizza but if you want to eat, be prepared to get pushy or its gone in a flash. 

That fabulous buffet price even includes all you can drink beverages! Hot coffee, lattes, sodas and icees! Sounds great! Except every machine was either of of syrup, carbonation and Icee machines were all broken the whole time.

When we grabbed our trays and tried to find a place to sit to eat, all tables were filthy. No staff to be found. We had to wipe down our own table to sit down to eat, 6 children in tow and I'm not talking just wiping off a few crumbs..

We moved on from ""dinner"" to the games. It's for the kids after all and it was time for them to have fun. Oh. But wait. 75% of the games we had already paid for on our pre-paid, loaded game Card were OUT OF SERVICE. Now at this point, even the kids were unhappy.

Obviously, we came In on a crazy Saturday night with sugar crazed children running everywhere, it was chaos, I get that. But this place is clearly understaffed. The staff wasn't able to keep up with the large crowd of people that just kept pouring in. It was a literal nightmare. 

Never again. If you have young children that are itching for a fun time, pay the extra and go to Chuck E Cheese, they've obviously been doing it for years and even they don't screw up like this.",yV5GOIgaB2U2ilb7kj1ybg,10,3,1,yccjE_LFfoKgVjQo9QH82w

This facility has several very comfortable dining areas so that you can really enjoy your meal. Some areas had multiple televisions playing sports which was a huge plus for my hubby. We really enjoyed the variety of pizzas, drinks, and desserts. My sister ordered a beer and I ordered a margarita. The strawberry margarita was tasty but I do think it could have used a bit more alcohol. I especially loved their pizza crust recipe. It is very soft and delicious. I had Hawaiian and nacho pizza which I enjoyed very much. There was quite a stampede every time they put out a cheese pizza. So, if you have someone in your family who really wants cheese pizza, be prepared to stalk that station. My 6 year old unfortunately arrived to the cheese pizza station just as a child was taking the last slice. However, it was only a few minutes before another fresh pizza was available. The games and rides were fun for many different ages. The selection of arcade games was substantial and they also have a large variety of prizes to choose from. My daughter especially loved the bumper cars and spinning ride. The staff was very friendly. Everything was very clean and well maintained.

It was hard to find a parking spot and we weren't sure what to do once we got inside. There was a long line and we couldn't see what was up ahead. Once we got in it was so loud we could barely hear what the employee was trying to tell us. Basically they charge anyone over 3 for the buffet. They tried to sell us tickets with game credits included which I'm so glad we didn't buy because the party mom had bought game credits for us already. You'd think since we were checking in for that party the employee would know that and not try to upsell us. Thank baby Jesus we had a private room to eat in because there is a 100% guarantee you will lose your child in this place. It was SO CROWDED. They do sell beer and wine which was one plus. But if you aren't hungry you are spending a lot of money for a buffet you aren't using. There was a lot of food to choose from. You get the party room for 2 hours and there was someone making balloon animals. However it was over an hour before they brought the cards to use for the games that the party mom had purchased and she was very angry. Once we got to the floor to play the games a lot were broken and a lot seemed to just take your money and spit out tickets but had no real point.

Third time here since it opened and it's always been a blast! My friend & I met up with a couple of friends to have a sort of going away lunch event. We had a fantastic time, and since we came early in the day, we didn't have to deal with screaming kids, folks fighting over food, or not having anywhere to sit (which was true of my first few visits, so I'm glad I'm reviewing it now). This place is for kids... I can't stress that enough. IT IS FOR CHILDREN. Can adults go here and enjoy the food and games? Definitely. But it's not Dave & Busters. You're going to be navigating through throngs of children. The rooms are themed to cater to children. Can you get a beer or margarita? Sure. Will you enjoy it? It's alcohol, of course you will. But with a backdrop of yelling, Disney toons music and video games, it's fun for the fam, but not if you just want a bite of pizza.

Speaking of the pizza, it's great. You get a fresh variety of basic staples like cheese and pepperoni, and then you can get a little crazy and try the cheeseburger or nacho pizzas. I'd pass on the desserts, they all taste like someone knew the general idea of a dessert, but something was missed in the preparation. The breadsticks are the holy grail, tho. People literally fight over them. STAY AWAY FROM THE OREO CAKE. Those are NOT oreos.

This was my 4th visit to John's. 
1st visit = bad.....Food Missing and not replaced, bad customer service. 
(Yes, I do give places a second chance, they have off days.)
2nd visit = Good....no issues (Although still slow to refill food on buffet. 
3rd visit = Fair....... (Still slow in food on buffet)

(Due to life being crazy busy, this post is a week late.)

So now we come to visit 4 - Last Thursday Dec 1st, I took my daughter back to John's.....having a Daddy/Daughter night.

We get to John's about 7:20 PM. Waited 15 minutes to pay for entry. One person working the register and 6 families ahead of us in line. 

Finally after getting in, my daughter and I went through the food line before getting a seat. 

Both Soup vats empty. Dried old crusty soup remnants sitting in the pots. 

No potato fritters (Ask about them and told its going to be 15 minutes....Hmmm ok)

.....few pizzas on the buffet. 

We go and sit down with our food in the Kaleidoscope seating area. 

Get back up after 20 minutes and still no potatoes and no chicken. Ask the girl working in the area where's the food and she just shrugs her shoulders and says I don't know. So we grab a few more things and go back to the table. 

After about 15 minutes my daughter tells me she doesn't feel well. All of a sudden she vomits all over the floor. No employees around so I begin to clean up. The first employee Ive seen in the Kaleidoscope area (female) walks in and totally oblivious, even though we are at the table right in front of her. I tell her my daughter has vomited and she says ""Oh, I'll go get someone"" and walks away. NO ONE COMES.  I am a responsible parent so I finish cleaning up the mess with the help of their little sink area thats in that room. STILL NO ONE COMES. 

I have had enough at this point and I go to the front desk and ask for the manager. 

A lady tells me she is the supervisor and I tell her about the missing food and the lack of customer service. Instead of first off saying she is sorry, she asks me, ""WHAT FOOD IS MISSING?"" in a demanding tone. WOW......So the customer service issues start at the management level and trickle down. So I tell her what is missing and I watch her walk over to the girl at the area with chicken and potatoes and ask her if they have been missing......the girl tells her yes. She asks her why and she doesn't have an answer. So instead of turning around and saying,""Im sorry"" or ANYTHING she walks into the kitchen and disappears. THANKS A LOT!! 

So in conclusion, honestly this was our last visit to John's. 50/50 isn't a good ratio when it comes to how a restaurant is. I shouldn't guess which one its going to be on this visit. (The lack of food seems to be every time.) The lack of customer service is bad. It's really sad because this could be a great family place. Also honestly, I think the reason my daughter got sick was because the food had been sitting so long.

First of all, there's a line that stretches to the sidewalk if it was a special day or something. When you get in there, it smells like how a child's dirty hands smell (you know, the smell if they didn't wash their hands after using the bathroom etc) Food options for salad are okay, pasta is mediocre because it's just four to choose from, pizza is alright (barely), but the dessert ""bar"" is so disappointing and gross looking. I was looking forward to the pasta, however, it was so tasteless! I bet if John's Pizza hired my mum, they'd have more success because she actually seasons food and the sauce wouldn't have much of a watery consistency. Really disappointed with the pasta part and the dessert bar, there was literally nothing to get from there except ice cream from the machine. 

Be careful when you're walking back to your seat with your tray because some people will blatantly walk in front of you and out of nowhere just turn, almost causing you to drop your food. 

Oh yeah, the staff barely even assists. Tables are dirty and not cleaned up until one of them sees that you're about to sit in one of the tables. I'd do a much better job cleaning up all the areas if they accepted my application. Anyways, i didn't try the gaming areas because they were all packed and waiting til somebody was done with one would've been a big waste of time. Save your money if you think this place is going to be fun, it's not worth it for adults, but i guess it's worth it if you want your child to play and get tired while you just eat and sort of relax.

It's pretty cool because there are several rooms that are adjustable in size and there are multiple party package options from $12.99 to $29.99pp.

There is a lot of pricing information, so I would recommend viewing it here: https://www.johnspizza.com/las-vegas/admission-and-pricing. Basically, if you're just here to eat, the AYCE buffet is $8.29 to $11.49 for adults (13+) and it's FREE to $7.29 for kids depending on age (12 and under). These prices do not include beverages though. Unlimited beverages is $1.99 for everyone. There are a lot of beverage options including soda, Icee, coffee, hot chocolate, cappuccino, etc. And yes, there is alcohol for purchase at a dedicated bar (beer, wine, and frozen margaritas).

In short, the food is terrible. I took a tour of this place before they opened and given the whole spiel about the food being made fresh in-house, etc. So, I was expecting quality or at the very least, tasty food. Let's start with their namesake, pizza. This probably has the most potential, but the toppings are shamefully scarce and if you're in the market for the more exciting options, you won't have much luck; very few are offered and even if they are, it's always out. The pasta options are okay, but the salad bar is severely lacking. I didn't like the Chicken Pot Pie Stew or Fried Chicken either; both tasted very strange.

If you're here for the entertainment as well, you need to purchase a FunCard for 50¢ and each credit is 25¢. Games cost 1-6 credits and rides/attractions cost up to 10 credits each.

Fun World is very impressive; the rides and attractions especially. Their version of bumper cars called Boogie Bump is much cooler than the classic, there's Glow-in-the-Dark Mini Golf, and a twirling ride in the middle of all the action. They seem to have all the games at you'd typically find at an arcade or similar business. I really enjoyed the Galaxy Collision QuadAir Hockey Table during our recent visit (imagine four players and four pucks for an ultimate air hockey game). Some games dispense tickets that can be redeemed at the prize counter.

Bottom line, you're here for the kids. They enjoy it, so I guess you put up with the bad food, plus, it is really inexpensive.",TdYKJgSgY2GF_YJnwsi5yQ,10,5,3,q1lLnAEa7olUP5RCalxJ_A

It was my first time at John's Incredible Pizza. I expected an arcade, but I had no idea it had a buffet & rides.

For how much the buffet is per person, it was overpriced for the quality. I was not a fan of the food. It also wasn't clean. There were plates, forks & cups that clearly were not washed all the way, which is a big turn-off for me.

I did like the themed rooms, which each had a different vibe & a lot of tables to sit at for your group. My brother didn't book a party, but it's easy to get together & set-up an area in a room.

All the kids received a game card with $5, which is 20 credits. The games seemed to average at ~2-4 credits & rides ~8-10 credits. Each time you swipe, you can see the remaining credits you have & you can have tickets won transfer to the card.

I was going to ride a ride with my nieces, but because one of my nieces was under the height requirement & needed an adult, I was able to ride the ride for free.

Overall, I can see that this is a spot for kids to have fun & it stands out with the rides, but the buffet quality & cleanliness is what makes me think this place is a no-go.",QSMsF78PxVYiAwwwHeZ7xA,6,1,2,OtMI90XgrSPsw9Sxgi0mvg

There are rides, games, arcades, and a miniature glow golf section. We took our 2.5 year old and spent several hours here. He had a lot of fun.

4912464,2018-01-13,0,Ql0iiHl2xpIwtkuC255Wiw,"Update:

While I stand by my review below, I was impressed with 1 thing: The manager at the prize area gave my daughter an 850 ticket prize even though she only had 790 tickets just because she saw it was her birthday. They also aren't picky about you moving from your party room to the general seating tables which is cool. If you come for lunch you can likely even have an early dinner which is cool. I added 2 stars back for this. I hope they address the other issues.

Original Content:


I am so disappointed by the birthday package we purchased and our experience today. I was all jazzed when I booked the party yesterday and I feel so let down. 

We paid $22.99 each for 6 kids and $12.99 each for 3 adults. When I booked online, I chose the option to pay the entire bill at the time of booking. Today, one of our kid guests backed out of attending but I figured I would just eat the cost of that extra kid's fee. We checked in which was a longer process due to a large party in front of us which dug into our party time since they only had 1 party line open. Now keep in mind that if your party starts at 12pm and ends at 1:45pm and they hold you up at the register checking in, you do NOT get extra time in the room. We were about 15 mins late getting to our party room due to their delay. 

So we finished checking in and met our VERY nice attendant, Lizeth (may have been Lizbeth). She was fun, friendly and seemed to enjoy her job. 

One thing I found odd was I thought the room would include decorations like table cloths and cups but it's just tables and balloons. They do have a cable TV in there and the kids put on Disney. 

One odd thing is that although I paid for everything online when I booked, the manager still showed up wanting us to ""settle"" our bill. Apparently when I paid online it was only a deposit although they had offered me the option pay a $75 deposit which is when I decided to pay the whole bill because I didn't want to bother with financials on the day of the party. Also ofd because they took the full bill out of my account online (my online receipt shows this). So when we checked in with only 5 people we went below the minimum booking amount of $170. 

So the manager shows up and pulls us to the back room to ask about our bill. Long story short is that instead of just charging me for what I paid for online, they adjusted the people who did show up to a higher package for 5 kids and 3 adults. Pricing was almost the same at the end which is fine but just the hassle of having to be pulled away for another 10 minutes from the party was annoying after the delayed check in. And the kicker? They wouldn't give us the token cards until the manager ran my bank card so we didn't get the kids their tokens until about 1 hour and 30 mins into our 1 hour 45 minute party. And you bet they kicked us out of the room at the 1 hour 45 minute mark. 

One other thing that made it awkward was the manager asking us how much to add for the hostess' tip. While I had planned to tip the sweet girl who had been so nice to us, it was awkward and uncomfortable to have the manager ask us and stand there while I decided what to give. Some things deserve some privacy for goodness sake. 

Regarding the buffet, pizza was super scarce. They really need to speed up production, after all it is a buffet and mid-Saturday in Las Vegas. The donuts they made were crunchy (overcooked)

The games are fun but good luck trying to win a stuffed animal. I spent about 180 credits/tokens trying to win just one (and never did).

The prizes you can redeem are so overpriced. Other places that I'm not naming offer much more reasonably priced prizes and allow you to pay with cash the balance. They had a weird, complex policy here about only being able to pay for 25% of the value of the item or something like that. Maybe being a paramedic with a masters degree makes me less able to figure out complicated policies and procedures. 

So overall, I'm disappointed. I took a chance on Johns Incredible Pizza and it was a bust. I honestly think I may just do home parties in the future or even try somewhere else. I'm sorry it wasn't better.",oMRDMqk0wIni7bttUFBXuw,2,0,3,VX4cbZmZcg5QrkIsQD0lFw
4917215,2016-01-03,1,Ql0iiHl2xpIwtkuC255Wiw,"First off I'm a big fan of John's, I use to frequent there locations in California all the time. When i heard they where coming to Vegas I was a happy camper.. 

Well they opened their Las Vegas location on Dec. 29th 2015. I'm a bit confused as to why they did not advertise this more..  I went on News years day and was surprised at the amount or lack of business. Talked to a few employees and they said the opening has been a lot less the expected.

 But that being said.. This place is done up very well.. 5 themed rooms to dine in.. from cartoons to sports to just a quiet room to relax. Its a buffet style restaurant , so its a serve yourself.. 

The buffet offers a nicely stocked salad bar, baked potato bar, pizza bar where the show case some unique pizzas such as a peanut butter ( not my fave ), cheese burger, bbq chicken, chicken ranch and a host of others.. And if you do not see what you like they will make it for you. they have a pasta and bread stick bar, fried chicken, mojo style potatoes, soups and of course your desert bar. Good selection of drinks including beer and wine ( beer and wine is additional cost ) . Milk is also available from the bar. ( think outside the box here people, make shakes with milk and ice cream ). its all you can eat and drink. the food is better then cc's and way better then chucky cheese.

 After dining they have a nice arcade of things to do.. Now I am a bit disappointed in this area.. its seems rather void of games compared to the California locations..  although they do have some very nice high hd type that I have not seen in Cali.. They have glow in the dark miniature golf, mini bowling, bumper cars and a tilt a whirl type ride in the center. 

Games give out tickets that can be redeemed for prizes.. most machines are a bit stingy on tickets but a few pay off rather well..  The prize booth has a nice selection of prizes to chose from.. 

 All in all a very nice 3 to 4 hours can be spent here with the family..  Another stop for those with children who visit Las Vegas as well as the locals..",r2wK-bxWTIRTupmbOcrEWg,6,0,4,HdhqxYvdT5jHg_r1jJzYHA

It's a lot more confusing to learn how to load the cards here and to get the best bang for my buck especially with my coupons .. Admittedly I do not always plan my visits so keep in mind they do have deals but paying attention to their website will help with that ..


Today after a visit for the mall that this place is next to attending another attraction they ran out of pizza and I decided to let my son have a chance to come here ... I have another daughter who is 11 so we always opt to get two fun cards and we joined VIP but I always forget ... the cashier we got was Ibrahim and he's super sweet but shy and wasn't sure the best route to help me get the most bang for my buck when I saw my total got to $86 when he consulted Billy one of the managers he simplified the process with a smile and made sure I got my $10 off a $100 like the email I got in the easiest most value friendly way without making me feel dumb or upset for spending $90 .. honestly for all you can eat even at places with about the same level food my kids get to have fun and play .

Depending on your kids there may be other options that are better but for mine ages 8 and 11 this option beats competitors close by because my son isn't old enough to do a lot of the adrenaline stuff and that isn't my daughters thing ..

Listen I'm giving this place 5 stars for an all you can eat gaming experience for adults and kids to be able to enjoy without breaking the bank or causing tears of upset for not being big enough or boredom for not having fun ..

Sometimes I've been and I have wondered why the food and the mess isn't taken care of but as I was reminded today management here wants to help so if you're friendly and ask ..

We took the kids to the new Johns here in Vegas and I have to say that I have mix reactions. 

We arrived and the entrance looks really cool which is what you expect as it is a kids fun center. We paid, the prices are reasonable for a buffet style restaurant. We then went in straight into the buffet area to get pizza there was just one problem.....No Pizza! 

There were a few slices of pizza from two old stale looking pizzas. There was two pcs of chicken that looked stale, and mojos that we're stuck together and we're as hard as rocks.

I was very disappointed at the food options. Not what I expected from Johns. 

After 5 minutes they started to bring pizza out and more options, this only happened after more people started showing up at the stations. 

As far as the games for the kids, no issues there for the exception of some games that were out of order which is expected when they are in use every single day.

So when we got to the play area we got the card which I like that better then carrying tokens around. I did not like how long they took checking the cards that took like 5 minutes each person just to get in the rides, also some of the seats In the twister they did not fill them up with 4 people instead they put two people on each knowing they had a huge line...

What's impressive is that this place is massive! My kid always has a good time here. We mostly play games and will probably try out the rides, bumper cars, and mini golf on a weekday. This place blows Chuck E Cheese out of the water. There are games for everyone, like kiddie games, racing, shooting games, etc.. There is even a toddler area with a small slide and other fun stuff for older infants and young tots. 

The food here is alright, nothing to brag about. Lower your expectations and be realistic. This place is for kids, not a Las Vegas strip buffet or a foodie destination. It's an all you can eat buffet that offers salad, soups, pasta, pizza, breadsticks, fried chicken, desserts, and ice cream.  There are some pretty odd flavors that I would probably not try again like the cheeseburger pizza and spicy peanut pizza. I did enjoy the freshly made mini donuts, cinnamon rolls, and cookies! The different themed rooms for dining are pretty cool. We normally stick with the cartoon room closest to the front, which plays Disney cartoons and decorated with kid friendly characters. 

All staff that I have come across have been friendly, helpful, and are constantly cleaning and clearing used plates.

First, for parties, they have a minimum purchase. For one room(maximum occupancy 24) it is $320. I had 26 people, so I called and they were able to book me for 1 room, no problem. They just told me to bring an extra chair in. They saved me so much money when the online portal would not allow me to get one room.

The food is fantastic in my opinion. The pizza is standard, but the breadsticks are pretty good. And they also have lots of desserts to choose from. Unlimited drinks make it great when there is an ice machine.

While it may be a bit expensive to come here just for fun, having a party is WORTH IT not only for the reduced buffet/funworld credit price, but for the service. They played games with the kids, brought in incredibear to take pictures and made all the kids balloon animals to take with them. When we left the party room, they even gave us a trash bag to hold all the balloons so the kids could still play! While I do admit the hosts were a bit shy, the kids still worked great with them.

When the fun cards were handed out, one was dropped, and the manager replaced it after searching for a bit. When we found it and tried to give the extra back, they let us keep it.

When we were ready to check out, we were told we only had 100+ tickets. After speaking to 2 associates and a manager named amber, we were repeatedly told that ""We must of been confused"". My daughter, whose 4, understood the game and what had happened but apparently my husband and I cant comprehend how to play this game.
The manager gave us 20 tickets because she felt ""bad for us."" and told us we could buy tickets.
 We considered it but truthfully unless you have 2000+ tickets the toys are pretty cheap. 
If Amber honored the 500 tickets like she should have, they toy would've cost maybe 3 dollars retail at the store. 
My daughter was crushed because she didn't want anything with her 100+ tickets. Thank god for amazon prime, she picked out a toy and her world is better again.
My suggestion to you is take pictures of winning tickets or print them out. DO NOT PUT THEM ON A CARD!!

I say this because everything was empty, each and every time we went to the buffet lines. No pizzas, no desserts, no chicken, pasta and salad. You'd think that you give them a few mins and it'll be refilled. Nope! The first time I came was a weekend. Okay, they were packed. I can see why there was never food available. Second time, we came on a Tuesday. Yes, Tuesday! Place was empty! Maybe total of 30-40 people which included our party of 25 lol

Had to update my review as I recently visited for a 2 year old's party. Sunday afternoon at 11am and the place was refreshingly empty! The party room was spotless and well-decorated for a kid's party. The staff were all friendly and accommodating. The ones making balloon animals were so patient and kind with the kids, and they even taught some of the adults some balloon-animal-making skills. Staff were constantly clearing away our empty plates and asking if we needed anything. I'm not sure how much the party host paid for this, but it seems to be worth EVERY penny not to have to clean up after your toddler's party LOL. I went to another toddler's party recently at Bouncy World in Henderson, and this far surpassed in terms of service and ambiance. 

Each kiddo received a card pre-loaded with 60 points, 2 rides, and some bonus tickets. I thought this was extremely generous for a party! We got tons of play time, and our toddler got to do everything he wanted and more. 

As a parent, I realize that I've started to judge experiences according to how they benefit my children, and not how ""happy"" they make me, LOL. So if I were rating this place simply on my own rating scale, it would be 3 stars. The food isn't that good. They don't offer any juices for the kids. It can get pretty crowded and some of the games/machines don't work properly. But my son had a BLAST, and so did all the others at the party. And I was pretty impressed by the service. 

That half star comes off simply because of the location (ugh, the Boulevard mall). Also, I do think they should give out the cards for play a bit earlier on in the party. 

I will definitely be keeping this on the radar for a party in the future!",rNjgVKaBh1PlUA6dYB6EUw,4,3,5,2cRgnTFqqFcG53jJJnmiSw

Cheese style place with bumper cars, arcades, and a full on, large pizza buffet was too much to resist, so of course I had to come here.

Personally, I liked it well enough.

The buffet is huge with plenty of pizza, pasta, and salad options.  Unlike the ""slightly flavored cardboard"" taste of ol' Chuck, the variety of pizza flavors had me finding a few respectable choices.  The greatest pizza I've ever had?  Perhaps not, but I did find some unique and fun flavors to snack on.  Also, it's cheap as everything, too!  Great price for what you get.

Also for adults: The serve beer and wine and margaritas.  If the dull roar of too many kids is wearing you down, you can at least find solace in sweet, sweet booze here.

Each room has a different theme. The missus and I opted for the Tahoe style room, and it was cozy enough.  But they do have crazier choices for room themes.  The place is colorful without being overly obtrusive, and I liked all the styles.

The arcade....  Overall, I liked it.  Bumper cars, mini golf, a few rides, a few arcade style games.  I will be picky as I am a professed child of the '80's, and remember the days of rows upon rows of arcade games.  I know times change, but a ""classics"" row of some Donkey Kong, Centipede, Street Fighter II, and Ms. Pac-Man would go a long way.

Is it fun?  Yes indeed.  Am I going to drag hapless friends to it for bumper cars? Kicking and screaming, I will.  Do I hope this place sticks around?  Absolutely.  I love kitsch, and this place screams it.

Worth checking out.  Bring your goofy-hearted friends, stock up on drinks, and play some games for a pretty enjoyable outing.",H3wPBzQCKCKiHcV7GZK4kg,5,4,4,N13SjKuxb8SAG1q6BTRW6A

This is an upgrade from Pistol Pete's Pizza. Yes, I am that old that I had ran around like an idiot in one of those. Not much has changed in my behavior full disclosure. I had never heard of this place until my niece had a birthday party here. As soon as I walked in, I felt overwhelmed by all the kids and neon lights of where food stations were located.
I enjoyed the set up of the salad, pizza/pasta/chicken, and dessert stations. The staff attempted to keep the stations clean, but with kids ranging from crawling to knee kicking that was an impossible mission. The food was edible, and I didn't get sick so that is where star 1 came into play. Star 2 alcohol. Star 3 digital tickets- no longer do I have save a bunch of paper tickets that I will probably lose or trash in a few months.

The games are ""doodle jump"" or ""candy crush"" and many more that are similar equals silly because you have that on your phone. The place did have activities, such as: in door golf, bowling, bumper cars, etc. The place lost stars because of price and the fact that it takes a minimum of 1000 tickets to get anything fun.

- The staff is amazing and are super positive and helpful.
- The games are super legit I would put them ahead of Dave and Busters and Chuck e Cheese as far as value and wow factor. Although Dave and Busters has a bigger selection, I believe the games are overpriced there versus here where your kids can play longer with the same amount of money. I believe Chuck E Cheese games are a little bit cheaper but are nowhere near as fun as Johns Incredible Pizza. As an adult I am literally playing 80% of these games right along with my kids.  I have been here twice and was really impressed with the selection and having the ability to put tickets on cards versus hard tickets. 
- Cleanliness is pretty good they have a buffet that seems to be more tailored to kids. They do a good job of having staff clean up the area and the bathrooms were impressive. 

Things that can be better- I like what they are doing but I think to bring in more customers they may need to revise price points for entry and things of that nature. I would recommend if members want to just come play games that they have an option with a reduced entry or something of that nature. Although I said I liked a lot of things the buffet was not one of them. I do not feel it was worth the price, as some of the items could have been restocked better and that was an observation from both times. If the buffet is a keeper than put some work into making it better. After leaving the second time I was still wowed with the concept of the place overall but  I cant imagine coming back if I have no intention of eating at the buffet. This is coming from a customer that really likes this place and I am still saying that.Paying for the buffet for me was an  absolute waste of money the second time and if I wasn't trying to show my significant other how cool the games were I would have opted not to go in at all. None of this is meant as a slight to the company. I think they are doing big things and have something special that may need some tweaks to take it to the next level. 

So BLUF (Bottom line up front)  Games 5 stars/buffet 2 stars. I'm giving it a 3. This is just my opinion which does not mean much. Your kids will still have a ball here and they will be ok with the buffet more than likely.",RhZNDUlPO9KzwhJKpRpttA,0,0,3,WCF2nv3wLj33-JjJeoDSMg

Actually a smart move the more I think about it.

Anyways... great variety of games and rides.  Mini bowling and mini golf were nice.  Rides were good overall.

Long review: We brought the kids and relatives from out of town on Friday. You can only get in (to the games and rides) if you pay for the buffet (10.99 adults, less for kids) I actually loved that because it gets rid of the people who are just going to hand their unsupervised kids $5 and leave them to their own devices. 

We got there early and they were just putting out the food. There were a lot of choices, pizzas, pastas, salads, chicken, rice, many dessert and drink choices also...much better than CiCis, everyone was happy with their food and thought it was a good value for the price. 

They have many different themed dining areas which was very cool. We sat in the sports themed room. Everything was very nice and clean, which I'm sure is helped by the fact that this place is new but I am hoping it stays that way . All the employees we encountered were really nice too, especially the ones working the rides and games area. 

After eating we went to the games and rides area, and stayed 2 hours! The kids had a blast. We bought the 19.99 cards, which I think came with 100 credits and 1 free ride. The games were very reasonably priced at 2-4 credits each, I believe the rides were 10. The cards lasted the kids a very long time and the rides were awesome. They loved them. We opted to have ""e-tickets"" (the tickets you win automatically load onto the card after the game) and that worked perfectly. 

We think this is a great addition to Las Vegas and really hope it stays nice and clean with everything working. It is a great place to take the kids :)",YJNVwDdzwjwhptzh9y2vBg,3,2,4,ZaAFiGYmj1z_KGf1RRsUuQ

Not sure if it was because it was the end of the day, or they just don't really care about the quality of the food? Example, the sweets tasted too generic. But the pizza was pretty delicious. Would have given 5 stars but the food was sort of a damper. Overall, friendly service and we have to thank Billy Lee for his professionalism and hospitality.",cRLezm4_emnwsJ41o237KQ,2,2,4,feJJFnhmYRhQP6SSSQrArA

It's like if Chuck E. Cheese & Cici's pizza had a baby and named him John.  And then John grew up and built this sick-ass indoor buffet/arcade/mini amusement park. 
Went on Sunday 1-3-16 around 11:30 AM.  You must pay for the buffet in order to get to the rides and games. 
Adults are $10.99 and my 18 month old was free.  We also bought 75 ""credits"" for $14.99.  Instead of tokens you get credits loaded onto a card that you swipe at each game.  You can pick whether you would like paper tickets or electronic tickets.  I chose to fist-bump mother earth by choosing electronic tickets.  
The buffet was one step above Cici's to me...they had some higher quality ingredients for the salads, desserts, and pizzas and definitely had more variety. Once you fill up your tray with goodies you pick one of five dining rooms.  They have a sports themed one, a cabin one, a cartoon one, a kaleidescope one which was like a diner, and the fusion room which was just playing 90's music on a big screen. 
They have a lovely toddler area, kiddie bowling, mini golf, bumper cars, and two rides.  Everything in the place is brand spankin' new and absolutely beautiful.  The place is huge as well...I bet it would hold at least 300 people.  They have 4 or 5 private party rooms as well.  Each game took around 3-4 credits so 75 credits lasted quite a while and we were quite satisfied with the value. 
I wish my son was bigger so he could appreciate the awesomeness of this place!  If you've got kids go check it out!!!",VigsAph76fP7pechJ743EA,22,18,5,U1GeIxSFF-PZTpvVjOwbFg
5719136,2016-02-05,0,Ql0iiHl2xpIwtkuC255Wiw,"Overall this place is pretty awesome.. And if you have small kids or nieces and nephews you'll pretty much end up coming one way or another... I ended up being there on a slower night, a Wednesday as I decided to surprise my 26yr old boyfriend with a small party between him and his friends to check out what the fuss was all about and as a goofy memory to remember later on. There's a large variety of games which is cool for both adults and children.. Angry birds on a large screen, air hockey, bumper cars, floppy bird, a little bowling alley and many more. The pricing for the games isn't too bad either as its done with a preloaded game card and it's done with a credit system and you can always check your balance on. 2 downsides to this place that I found.. 1. You have to pay to come in, no matter what. If you're hosting a party there, I would say to let your guests know ahead of time if it's there first time attending as it can be confusing the moment you walk in. The fee is suppose to cover the buffet pricing... Which leads to the 2nd downside.. The buffet.. It's just not good and there were so many items missing on the night I attended. There's a salad bar, pizza bar and dessert bar.. I'm possibly missing another.. But I would say that the pizza bar was the best one. No real complaints here- just kinda wish there was a way to go there for just the gaming opportunity then having to pay for buffet pricing to come in..",fkf5UTsQTakNIAiwZfDW5g,0,0,4,0yVnO6BlaTgemwya_NXlbg
5799699,2016-02-07,8,Ql0iiHl2xpIwtkuC255Wiw,"ONE WORD! FILTHY!  Place should be closed by SNHD. Guess what no one cares either. Staff is miserable, managers don't care. Food is unavailable. Dinning areas are a giant mess. Half the games are broken. Great concept lots and lots of work to make it better. For 10.99 you can get a crap buffet any where in this town with many more options that are available. Endless lines of empty trays. Here's an idea pay more staff and cook more food. Clean your floors and bathrooms. Just close and start over.
I attempted to talk to who I believed to be the GM. Tall and gray older man. He said what can I go for you sir. I explained I was at the establishment with 19 other people. Business owners in the food industry as well. I told him the place was messy, no food, rude staff, and down right filthy. He said I'm sorry you feel that way and he walked away.

Never celebrate any occasion here on a weekend!!! Place is packed!!! Lines everywhere ESPECIALLY in the buffet!!!! We had to wait 15minutes for a fried chicken!! People yelling at everybody!!

People pushing everywhere!! It was a mess!!! At some point, i actually missed chuckie cheese!! They just keep letting people in without realizing the capacity of their kitchen to provide a lot of food.. 
They should have a separate food area for the private party area... It was NOT worth it!! Also vape smoke smelled everyhere.. LOOOOONG lines for the rides as well!!!! Uggghhhhh!!!!",lWyVmJfPwgXqWphpq0bs0w,4,0,1,CMCprGR2dz9k3UpMAU9ilg

5956879,2016-03-22,2,Ql0iiHl2xpIwtkuC255Wiw,"Should have a separate room for people for party booking. It was a struggle to talk over everything that it took us 45 mins for a simple conversation cause we needed to keep correcting everything. Even trying to call on the phone was too much of hassle. 

Actually birthday party day was total chaos. I was told I could've been in 15 minutes before my start time so I had my guest come early just for us to be packed in the entrance  way and no workers can tell me what was going on and kept giving me the run around. How embarrassing. I had balloons and decorations with me so they asked if they could set it up in the room.. They literally kept the balloons tied up together and the decorations in the box when we got in.

The hosts were TERRIBLE! I understand that it's a new place but they definitely should've been trained more. Even with simple instructions from me, they couldn't even handle. They were too quiet and too shy and had no itinerary. 

As someone who paid well over $1000 for a 2+ hour birthday party I was expecting to have a better time. I would have never done this if I knew how unprofessional it would have been. Better off going to chuck e cheese paying fraction of the price.",7vzosYBptYT-mLsLjoXkfw,6,3,1,rnWPxFKyGCgteyRwYQK3Ig
