Fish flakes here were about $5 compared to others selling the same for quite a bit more.  Corals are also an exceptional value.

Decided to get into the saltwater fish and coral hobby and I'm glad we have Aquatic Treasures in Vegas.

Bought my 20gal RedSea max nano tank with reefsaver rock and live sand and water. Came out to about $1000 which is what you would be paying online so the prices are very competitive. Sunny, Toni, and Josh are very knowledgeable and help you with the process of selecting  the right tank for your budget and what you want to accomplish. I.e. Are you doing coral? What type of fish are you into? Setting up and ""cycling"" your tank. 

YES, you have to wait about a month and let your tank run before you can put fish and coral in your tank! I have learned hat PATIENCE is key in this hobby!!! Trust me, it's worth it once you see how beautiful your tank can be. 

The process of getting into the hobby may feel like a lot to consume at first, but they really helped me with everything and now it is a breeze. If your thinking about getting into saltwater aquariums this is the place to go, I'm glad I did!",eE08Wq_OIawj66KVZ86qIQ,1,1,5,HyIcdT7YTcas53BMiq3nug

I called a week in advance and made sure not to plan anything for that time slot. 
Next week comes by and no one showed up. 
I waited..... and waited.... and waited..... 
Well no one showed up hours after the appointment so I called the store. 
They said, He is running late. I said, that was ok and to please have him call/text me when he was on his way. They agreed and we hung up. 

Then 1/2 an hour before the store closed and no guy to help with the tank, I decided to call again. 
This time the lady gave me his number. I called and no one answered or responded. 

I came to the conclusion that the prices may be competitive, but it's not worth it when you end up loosing money for taking off time to sit around the house. Especially when I'm a student and have to save up for family dinner expenses & x-mas gifts.

In the end, no one called to follow up on my experience or if any one showed up and I now have to look for a new tank person. My family has gone back home, so having that on my check-list never got completed.",P3Lu0CjQJsh3VWsfPbda6A,6,0,1,QrDf1kR6cJGicpHlNLaZZQ
