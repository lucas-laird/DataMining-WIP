-Roast Pork 
-Sea Bass Filet in Bean Sauce

One of my other friends highly reccommended this place and said it was authentic Taiwanese food. Of course, I had to go and try it! My friend likes to order lots of food. I told her to pick whatever she wants because she has good tastes, so I have no idea what she ordered. Haha.  We had hot and sour soup, eggplants with something, 3 cup chicken, and fish filet with bean paste. I wasn't a fan of the 3 cup chicken. The flavoring was a bit weird maybe it was because they put too much basil.  I loved the eggplant and the fish filet. It was so awesome! The eggplant was very refreshing and very delicious. The fish filet was so awesome! It was huge too! I was stuffed because I ate so much!

I did have an issue with my credit card. I got a notification (I get text alerts everytime my credt card is charge), and I got charged twice. They also overcharged. We split the bill, and they charged me $5 more. They fixed refunded me one of the charges and charged me the right price. On their end, it only showed one charge. They did tell us to come back if the charge did show up on my cc. They did call my friend a few days later (She left her number) and asked if I had been overcharged which was nice of them.  

The servers were very attentive, and I liked the fact that they let us stay past closing and did not try to kick us out. And it was very sweet of them to call to check if I was overcharged.",yP9UmCxs1PSqljLfpR9R5g,1,0,4,DkE2edt99w-P71yGM2Olfw

This restaurant took over the Shan Dong restaurant that used to be here. Kind of hidden by a huge tree, to the right (North) of Boutique World 

NOTE: CASH ONLY ! ! ! ! ! !

The menu says ""Authentic Szechuan Cuisine for 50 years"". To clarify, its not the Szechuan from China. As we were told by the waitress, the chef is from Taiwan and cooks authentic Taiwanese ""Chuan Cai"" which means village food/cuisine. 

Not familiar with taiwanese style foods, and it being lunch, my friend and I ordered from the lunch specials. All lunch combos served with 1 vegetable egg roll, steamed rice (or brown rice), daily vegetable (....wait what? i just noticed that LOL) and soup. 

$4.25 combo - ma po tofu, sauteed cabbage, glass noodle with minced pork, or scrambled eggs with tomato
$5.75 combo - shredded pork with bean curd, shredded beef with bell pepper, chicken with garlic sauce, or sliced pork belly with bell peppers
$6.95 combo - shrimp with scrambled eggs, shrimp with broccoli, beef with bean curd, or beef with mushroom

Not a bad selection amount for lunch. Lots of food. Maybe restaurant isn't too known yet and it recently opened so not busy at all. Food came out pretty fast. 

The soup was a hot and sour soup. Strong on the white pepper. My friend didnt like it but i liked it. Normally dont order/get this soup. XD but it was pretty good. 

Shredded pork with bean curd - decent amount. lots of bean curd. flavored well. 

Sliced pork belly with bell peppers - lots of veggies vs pork belly. A bit on the salty side (for me). Not bad (salty wise) eaten with rice. 

Vegetable Egg Roll - not a fan of vegetable egg rolls but it was freshly fried. Hot and crispy skin. Vegetable........ yeah not a fan of that part. Lol 

Overall, not bad. Good deal for lunch. Would like to come back to try what my friend had gotten to see how it is. Apparently totally ordered the wrong things.",Ksp1e9Dw0Jcog_ZBD3-45g,5,2,3,tmq_M-EPCEyFgdfcEvFC6g

1956652,2017-06-07,0,IBNWrN1k9E0E_bMcRD-GwA,"When I first came to Chef Ching's Kitchen, I was just looking for a place for lunch.  I wasn't particular, just a place for lunch, right after finishing my purchase at 168 Market a few yards away.  I walked in, and it was just a hole-in-the-wall, so I had no expectations.

Oh My God!  Genuine Chinese food, some with a real Szechuan bight to it, and reasonable prices.  Reasonable?  Better than reasonable.  When I finally had the nerve to bring my wife here (she's from the Philippines and not easy to please with Asian food).  She had something from the menu, while I used the ads on the wall.  She told me that now she knows why I've been coming here.  The food is genuine, very well done, and reasonable priced.  She had a dish here, and then a week later she had the same thing at J@J Szechuan, a few blocks away.  She said that her comparison showed her that Chef Ching's did better on the same dish.

I'm not going to recite what I've been having there.  Heck, just take a look at the menu, the wall, of the reviews on this page.  It's true there's sometimes a problem locating an English speaker, but the last few times I was there it wasn't a problem.  They were out of squid one day, but had it the next time, and it turned out terrific.

The food is simple yet authentic, especially love the Country Style Egg Soup, so good, especially on cold days. The Mapo Tofu is delicious, lots of tofu and ground meat, and the sauce is delicious over rice. The fried fish with special sauce was also really good, two big filets of fish with a spicy sauce over it. Other dishes like the eggplant with garlic sauce, shredded pork with smoked tofu, and other dishes were generally very good. 

However, came here again yesterday after a few months of not eating here, things changed. The Country Style Egg Soup was still very good, but other dishes were not as flavorful as before. The Mapo Tofu has to meat like before and tasted a little bland, fish was the same, not as flavorful. King Pao shrimp tasted good but very little shrimp with tons of whole chilis and peanuts. Other dishes were not great.

I don't know what happened, this used to be such a good place to eat, decent price with huge portion, tasted delicious, great place for family meals. Flavors were lacking this time, but I will still come back for the egg soup!",7svBs9qqPJHPRXZ56Q3ZuQ,2,1,3,z6S5hIgV6Xa9z0V92LPtng

2178533,2014-09-08,0,IBNWrN1k9E0E_bMcRD-GwA,"The Skinny: came in for a good bowl of beef noodle soup and eggplant and left disappointed (2), service is very attentive and water glass is always full. Staff speaks primarily Mandarin though (4) value: their food lacks wok hai and flavor depth, but considering the level of service a 2.5 star place with bump up to 3.

I was jonesing for some good Taiwanese beef noodle soup after a long road trip diet of Mickey D's. We used to frequent Taiwan Kitchen which sadly closed. So we've been on the prowl for some good Taiwanese eats.

We came in and were promptly given menus. Unfortunately, there were some communication snafus (I don't speak Mandarin and the hubs is non fluent) but the service was friendly and really good for a small joint this size.

We ordered a bowl of beef noodle soup, stir fried tofu and braised eggplant. I think due to a communication problem, we got the garlic eggplant instead.

They started us off with some free cold dishes - a house pickled daikon and a garlic cucumber dish. I enjoyed the crunch of the sweet/sour slightly spicy daikon. The cucumbers were also very refreshing.

The beef noodle soup was disappointing. The soup base didn't have enough beefy aroma and tasted slightly like powdered bouillon. The noodles were slightly overcooked for my taste. The beef was tender enough and the serving size is large.

The eggplant dish was okay with a good sear to the eggplant. Unfortunately, there was too much goopy sauce in the dish which I wasn't a huge fan of. 

The tofu had the same issue with the addition of not having enough wok hai. It was stir fried with carrots and snow peas which was weird to me. The dish was on the bland side.

Overall, the food is kinda meh and I don't have a strong urge to return. Serving sizes are generous here so you won't leave hungry. 2.5 stars with a bump up to 3 for the excellent service.",h9RUaaHa5kcQKqtJ-sgS0Q,1,0,3,CFeVZ6namJVhSMu_mnE8gQ

This isn't a place for location, ambience, night life or a great wine list. This IS a place where you can get all your favorites, from Jelly Fish to Crispy Tofu and Kung Pao. 

My wife and I had four dishes and were thrilled with all, even a regular item like the fried rice with egg. Besides the fried rice we had Kung Pao chicken that was cooked without killing the chicken and just a hint of ginger in the sauce, really excellent. We also got crispy salt and pepper tofu and fried string beans. The tofu was fresh, high quality and cooked with an excellent crisp outside. The string beans looked as if they were hand picked from a garden that day and they were cooked just right with the right amount of crunch left.

3445646,2016-07-29,0,IBNWrN1k9E0E_bMcRD-GwA,"I came here with a friend who was in the mood for Taiwanese food, and we found this place via Yelp search. This restaurant is classified as both Taiwanese and Sichuan/Szechuan, and the Chinese name of the restaurant (????; an amusing name that roughly translates to ""little fatty's [i.e. chubster] Sichuan cuisine"" and gives significance to the logo of the plump chef) would suggest Sichuan cuisine as well. It is an interesting combo since Sichuan and Taiwanese food are very different, but the menu does in fact have dishes from both regions! The menu was an interesting mix of handwritten specials, color-printed (mostly) Taiwanese dishes, and a plain font black-and-white page of (primarily) Sichuan dishes below the listed appetizers on the back/last page of the menu. The lunch specials look like a steal if you come during lunch, and don't ignore the additional menu items posted on the wall/mirror (they are not featured in the printed menu at all and I didn't see them until after placing my order).

The interior of the restaurant was much nicer and larger than expected from the exterior appearance; clearly, it was renovated in the past. Service was also very friendly, though it helped that I spoke Chinese since one of the waitresses admitted that her English was not that great.

My friend and I ordered an eggplant dish (????), a meatballs dish (???; literally means ""lion's head"" but they are ground pork meatballs), and a plate of appetizer/side dishes (pick three for $6). We picked an appetizer platter of cucumbers, bean curd threads, and pig ear, but I think the bean curd threads and pig ear were just mediocre (the pig ear in particular was not nice and crunchy like cartilage usually is; it was very mushy and so-so). The eggplant and meatball dishes were both excellent though, and came as pretty large portions (especially the two gigantic meatballs). We were also given the option of steamed versus brown rice, and we opted for brown rice (no extra charge). 

Overall, I think this restaurant has a pleasant atmosphere with great service and very tasty food, plus the value is great considering the generous servings for the price (we ended up with leftovers).

Anyways, Today we will do lunch special. Server brought out small complimentary ""small dish appetizers"" where other places normally charge.

I got the tomatoe & egg lunch special. $4.25 !! What??? So cheap!! Yummmy!!! Comes w rice, egg roll, and sweet/sour soup.

Wife got the beef w mushrooms! $2 more but yummy too!!

Hidden away so doesn't have the overcrowded feeling when you go into Chinese restaurants nearby.

Chef/owner cooks the food, Chef Ching, does not have a hired cook, there is a helper sometimes though. But Chef Ching definitely in the kitchen for quality.

Good for groups and table for 4 as well.",SOjFhe2X9ClzDxbJK4vE8A,2,0,5,Y5aG3kmesoqMVgpYJ-Tqyw
4107183,2016-03-22,7,IBNWrN1k9E0E_bMcRD-GwA,"I was gonna try this place last year based on a strong recommendation from Bobby Y., but that didn't work out. Better late than never.

There was a bit of a language barrier at Chef Ching's Kitchen the first time, and it rang true for today. If you can bring somebody to help bridge the language cap, you'll probably have a much better time. I finally went back today with a friend who was familiar with Taiwanese food. And the language (most likely Mandarin). To my rellief, he was able to place orders and request condiments and to-go boxes, all of which 

We started with a selection of cold dishes ($6 for 3). The server had pointed out this deal at the top the back page, so my friend quickly chose pickled cucumbers, shredded bean curd, and pig's ears. The cucumbers are crunchy, lightly pickled, and come with carrots and a fungus that's supposed to be soft inside but a little crunchy outside (but my piece was just soft). The shredded bean curd was surprisingly al dente, a lot like how you'd expect good ramen noodles to be prepared. The pig's ears were mildly spicy and a little oily, but otherwise met my expectations of being mildly flavored and relatively tender (not overly chewy). All in all, this is a great appetizer course.

We each ordered a lunch special. My friend went with the mapo tofu ($4.95), a large bowl of soft, mildly spicy, and fairly soft bean curd. The bit that I sampled seemed good. He paired it with brown rice instead of white rice, which he prefers for the harder texture. My entree was the shrimp with scrambled eggs ($6.95), and it was perfectly cooked plump shrimp with soft scrambled eggs. They were salted fine to my taste, although perhaps a bit much for others. The green onion helps with color and flavor. The portion is really huge considering that it's packed with protein.

The lunch specials also come with rice (as I mentioned), soup, and an egg roll. My standard-sized bowl of white rice was cooked right and carried the entree enough with proper rationing. I'm not sure whether they'll charge for a second bowl because I didn't ask. The hot and sour soup was not too hot or sour, and the vinegar that my friend had requested really added depth to the flavor. The egg roll was unexpectedly awesome for being one of those vegetable egg rolls. It was tightly wrapped, very crunchy, and not too wet inside.

Chef Ching's is at the very least a great lunch spot with inexpensive yet tasty and filling food. It's potentially another jewel in the culinary landscape of Spring Mountain and Las Vegas in general, and I'm sure that I'll be back.",_VMGbmIeK71rQGwOBWt_Kg,10,9,4,t27ffduAGDUmGiZO9sgj1w

We ordered the chef special which is the beef noodle soup. It has a hint of spiciness and the soup is warm and delicious in an interesting way--- I'm so used to Japanese ramen and Vietnamese pho-- so this Taiwanese version will take a while getting used to. The beef is obviously cooked in a slow fire and the cut is lean but flavorful  (not  fatty nor full of ligaments compared to other places I've tried before). I wish they have sriracha on the table to adjust the spiciness. My husband and I shared the big bowl and were really full and satisfied :) We also tried the fish fillet in bean paste as recommended by our very energetic server. It is sea bass filet, crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. The bean paste & chili sauce compliment the mild flavor of the fish. And boy, their serving is huge. We got 2 filets that could feed a family of 6!!! I also like that you have a choice of brown or white rice (I chose the brown rice and it has such a delicious chewy nutty flavor!)

Glass noodles with minced pork - Had for the first time tonight and it's very simple but very flavorful.

Garlic stir-fry of seasonal vegetables - This dish is pretty standard in all asian restaurants, nothing special but solid dish nonetheless.

Tofu stir fry with eggplant - I didn't care too much for this dish, a bit light in flavor for me.

Mapo Tofu - Classic tofu dish that's very tasty.

4750928,2016-02-01,1,IBNWrN1k9E0E_bMcRD-GwA,"Hello. Well, I went to this Taiwanese restaurant on the suggestion of my friend who said it was good. The place looked closed when we drove up at 8pm on Friday night. Strangely the lights were on and we saw someone in the way back. The windows are tinted so you really cannot see in. I am going to guess this might be their first restaurant? Unless they are playing a game of ""guess if this place is open"" with customers. It looked so desolate, I swore I saw the crickets packing it in for the night and choosing a better spot.

So it looks like the lunch menu is super cheap. I don't know why. Why do people pay an arm and leg for Korean and Japanese but balk at paying the Chinese a smidgen? Well, unless it's PF Chang's which does not taste like Chinese food, I hate to tell you all. It's Thai slash, slash Viet, slash mostly American ""inspired"" Chinese food, owned by.... da da dum, yup some white guy. I think PF stands for ""Please fool, Chang's???"", as in do you really think this name is the owner of a Chinese dude? I joke, it's half owned by a Chinese guy.

So the food was actually really good. I felt guilty eating it because the food really is very tasty. I chose the cabbage dumpling, pork intestine noodle (I know I know, what's a Chinese guy to do but order the intestine? I got a reputation to keep), and beef noodle dish. All three were excellent. The dishes were large portions for dinner. They were around $9 each. I am not sure if the cabbage dumplings were hand made or not. It did not taste like it but if they did, I don't know how they can sustain a profit. Back to my diatribe....nah, I've made you suffer enough. The noodles were really tasty, it had a chewiness to it. It had texture and the flavored were great. The pork intestine soup was awesome. They killed any taste of intestine with the heaping mounds of garlic. If you have a cold or vampire infestation, you are welcome. Man oh man, fresh garlic galore.

But it all honesty, it worked and the dish was great. So, if you are wanting to try this place for dinner, pull in. The son will be playing on his phone but the will be courteous and serve you food with a smile. I am accustomed to Chinese severs throwing the food at me like they do at Sam Woos. (note to self, bring baseball mitt to catch your dishes when you go eat there.) The mother figure is attentive and makes up for the guy who is probably a student and the official seat warmer in the back. If that's his job, he is doing great. If you drink a lot of water, you may have to wait for the lady to refill your dish. He's not terribly bright either. I got a fork and chopsticks for my noodle that was filled with broth. I don't know, maybe that's how Taiwanese cuisine is, you gotta to outsmart your food, in order to, drink the soup with a fork. Haha, but it was a minor thing and he got me a soup spoon when I asked for a spoon to drink my soup.

Food

1. Fish Fillet in Bean Paste: This was one of my favorite dish from this place although I'm confused by the name of this dish. I did not taste any bean flavor in there. To me, it taste more like garlic sauce. Fish (white fish) is deep fried and soaked in this yummy sauce of theirs. 

2. Spicy Fire Pot with Pork Intestine: This dish comes with intestine and tofu.I like this dish very much as well. Only thing lacking in this dish is the pig blood cake/duck blood cake. Other than that, it has an pretty authentic taste. 

3. Chicken in Garlic Sauce: It comes with chicken, woodears, and a special type of potato that I don't know what it is called. Chicken was tender and the sauce was flavorful. 

4. Squid in three cup sauce: This dish was just okay to me because I like a lot of basil in the three cup sauce. I did not taste too much of basil in there. 

5. Braised Eggplant with Garlic Sauce: Flavor was great and eggplant was cooked just right. 

6. Rice with meat sauce: The meat sauce it self was yummy but I didn't like their steam rice. It was not moist but rather dry. Hopefully they will change to different brand of rice. 

7. Chinese meatballs (Lion Heads): It was not too flavorful. It was the least favorite among of our group. 

8. Roast Pork Hocks: It was flavorful but the meat was not that fresh that day. I can taste the ""piggy smell"" lol. It was also not our favorite among of our group. 

9. Glass noodle with spicy minced pork: This dish is okay for me as well. I like the sauce and the spiciness but the noodle was bit under cooked in my opinion. 

10. Beef Noodle Soup: Beef was tender but soup was not flavorful enough and I didn't like the yellow noodle that they put in there. 

I also like the complementary side dishes that we got the other day. We had cucumbers, seaweed salad, peanuts and bean spouts. 

Service was decent and attentive. I have been going twice since last weekend and plan on going back again this week. I will keep trying other entrees and keep you all posted!",b7rchNJEp6Gaw0bHR-4s4g,6,2,4,jubMV9nj4e7-CIcSaTyy6g

The pork was really good it wasn't overly fussy, it had green onions and sliced jalapeños and tasted mostly like ginger. The beef bowl had some really great chewy noodles and a flavorful broth. The fish filet was huge and not too spicy. Everything was well balanced and light. Nothing was too greasy, it didn't taste like msg or anything lol the service was stellar.

Defreakinlicious!  The stainless steel bowl served full of inviting tentacles, heads and other parts only a marine biologist could identify with basil and the 3 cups (sesame oil, rice wine, soy sauce) surpassed expectations.  The squid heads were my favorite pieces and acted as the perfect vessel to naturally hold the delicious sauce in.  Couple this with a big bowl of white rice and I could have probably been left alone, unattended to for an hour.  It's definitely not for everyone, but you'll love it if it is. 

Feeling the need to balance out the meal with some greens, we ordered the ""Chinese broccoli with mushrooms"" anticipating a simple stir-fried dish in an oval plate, but what came out looked fit for a king.  OK, I exaggerate, maybe a mayor of a mid-sized town, but even still...I said ""wow"" as the vegetables were nicely arranged around the center of nicely sauced fungus.  It was large enough for a party of four.

Not one to shy away from more carbs in life, the excellent fried rice topped with very tender slithers of pork, bamboo shoots and scallion was brought to the table along with a generously portioned bowl of ""ma po tofu"", which was also very pleasing.

There are definitely high hopes of returning soon to try the fish filets, dumplings and noodles among other items.  I'd easily choose Chef Ching's over most other Chinese options on this block.
