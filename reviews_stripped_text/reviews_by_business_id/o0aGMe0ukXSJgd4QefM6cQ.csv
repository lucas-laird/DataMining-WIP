We try hard to give a good experience every time with a welcoming smile. .  Funny enough, my husband hates seafood but, loves me!  We repeatedly come to the Red Lobster on Flamingo.  Food is fantastic!  Even better, it is so nice to be catered to, the way we cater to others.  Jesus is our favorite server, I'm sure they're all great, we always wait for him.

166758,2017-04-06,0,o0aGMe0ukXSJgd4QefM6cQ,Let me tell you about the 5 star treatment my husband I received yesterday at this Red Lobster location. Lobster fest is a tradition with us. We go every year. Last month we went to our usual location on Stephanie and Marks and the food and the service was the worst (but I'll do that review after this one). We decided to give another try and went to the one on Flamingo & Eastern. First let me tell you about our waitress Dana. She is without a doubt one of the best waitresses I've ever encountered in Any restaurant including 5 star. We told her about our experience at the other location. She apologized for the experience and said our experience there would be nothing like that AND IT WASN'T! She took our orders and then Jessica the manager came over. She said Dana had told her about the horrible treatment and service wed received at the other location and wanted to personally apologize for that experience and wanted to be sure their service so far was up to par. I assured her it was and thank you. Let me tell you that Dana made sure that EVERYTHING was absolutely delectable from the cocktails to the hors d'oeuvres to our main courses where absolutely top notch. We even took photos of how beautifully it was plated as well as the proportions. We also took photos of Dana and Jessica. We live in Henderson and will Never go back to that location again. Because of those 2 lobster fest will remain a tradition for years to come. You need to experience those two for yourselves. Trust me it's worth the drive.,NncStvul67JLUrO4tfvxmQ,0,1,5,nCeMQK5WvXU--EUC1NaH8g

Now this is what you called GOOD and consistent seafood. I would pay the 33.99 for the two lobster tails again and again. Food even tasted good one day after. I enjoyed it to every last piece :).  

They sing you happy bday if requested and the staff are friendly,helpful, and welcoming. Food was cooked to perfection.

I would go again just for the amazing food and experience. 

Great and big drinks too! Huge margaritas and Daiquiris- Taste amazing, whether you order a non-virgin or a virgin drink. 

Everything was good. Lobster Bisque soup, Salad(I had blue cheese), Stuffed Mushrooms, Grilled shrimp, coconut shrimp( you can actually taste the coconut on it!)

We had Surf and Turf, Lobster Lovers Dreams, Lobster stuffed Baked Potato, all served with a smile. We all raved about it.

And it all came fast, and hot. 

Very friendly staff and chief/cook :)

Highly reccomend if you want good seafood, forget those cheap, mass produced buffets and spend the money on some quality seafood- you won't regret it.",tfkUeoQyyqjs28q2mtba5g,0,0,5,Ch2PMXsTZpdddD_dxycbcQ

So, my choice was to either wait 45 minutes to an hour for them to fix the machine or pay a different way and come back again. A total inconvenience to myself and my fiance. 

The second time I came here my experience was absolutely amazing!  Our server, Harrison, was extremely professional and courteous the entire time. My thoughts were that since my fiance and I shared one dish and an appetizer and the server knew that we were pay with a gift card that we would get the cold shoulder (I've worked in a restaurant before so I know how servers can be) Nevertheless, Harrison treated us well and made us feel welcomed.

One knock that I had about this establishment was that it took long for the food to come and it took a while for or drinks to get refilled.

The steak and potatoes must have been under a heat lamp for a very long time. The steak was one of the worst I have had in a while. It was very tough and over cooked.

My dad had the seafood bake which I highly recommend if you love generous portions of seafood. Three half lobster tails and a bus load of shrimp, mussels and scallops on a bed of pasta with a rich buttery sauce. This was outrageous. We all enjoyed our experience.

I entered about 1pm and asked for a window seat and she sat me near the window.  It was pretty quiet and not too many people but that was fine with me.  

Couldn't wait to sit down and get those biscuits and boy were they good.  I ordered an Ultimate Feast however what I ordered definitely defeated me because I only at 15% cuz I was really full off of the bread, salad, and margarita.  

The food took a little while to come out but that's ok I wasn't in a rush just figured they had to prepare my food.  The margarita I ordered tasted ok but it had wayyyyy too much ice so I didn't get much alcohol at all.  Next time I will order it to be blended.

Our waiters name was Jesus and let me tell you about this man. He was amazing in every aspect. He brought water out immediately before we could even ask for it. Even though he sold us on a bottle of wine that you can get from a store for $9.00 that cost $27.00 at the restaurant. Our glass never went empty because he came over to fill it up before it could get there. 

So I remember going to red lobster about 10 years ago and I don't know what happened. Red lobster used to be an upscale restaurant and now i fill like it falls in the same bracket as like Joes crab shack. People would go to red lobster for anniversary and romantic dinners but now you go just for great food.

We got put in Ellen's section, a nice lady that was always smiling and attentive but not too much around. You know? We both had the 4 course meal for $16.99, you get choices for each course. I got the clam chowder, the fresh garden salad and the tilapia and brownie with vanilla ice cream for dessert. Soup was good, salad was super cold and super fresh. I don't think they chop lettuce too much though as one piece I had to cut into 4 pieces! Anyways, the tilapia came with broccoli (a little too cooked for my tastes) and rice pilaf (I'd get something else to replace this side next time-just bland). It was ok. The tilapia itself was outstanding. The dessert of brownie with vanilla ice cream is a MUST! Don't pass on it. It's not too big, but just enough. Although I could easily eat more.
My friend got the clam chowder, the Caesar salad which he loved. He then got the pasta alfredo  with scallops and shrimp. I did taste it though and it was really good. He too got the dessert that I did. 
So when you go to this red lobster, ask for Ellen's section! You will like the food and service. They just need to cook the broccoli less.",dxCce2EdLOAy78Y3fAXCgw,0,0,4,ngSwcHj3KOZcp40Oi7pRTw

I had just gotten off work so I was a bit tired but it was my idea to go.  I went straight to the restroom when we got there.  When I came out my husband had been seated right next to the restroom doors,  with the sun shining right in our faces.  Asked the little hostess girl to please close the blinds and she said wr would have to wait because there whee people sitting at the table where she needed to closed them at.  (She had just seated the family). The mother must have heard me because she was the one to close them. 

Our waitress was good, I think maybe a little busy she seemed to be in a hurry.  Our biscuit came out hot and fresh.  She took our order and came right back with our salads.  When our food came out about 15 min later wr could not eat.  We had not silver ware at our table.  We had to flag our waitress down.  
  
Me, I like to try new things. This times when we went it was lobster fest.  My husband as always ordered the admirals fest and I decided to go with the lobster lovers dream.  Not being a fan of green veggies so I opted for mashed potatoes.  My rock lobster was good it melted in my mouth.  My alfrado with shrimp and lobster was ok.  To much shrimp and not the good kind.  I would have taken a few Nice sized shrimp instead of three small salad shrimp they have me.  When I finally got to my main tail lobster it was over cooked and rubbery.  

We will eat at red lobster again but I suggest going to the one on valley view and 215. Better cooks, better service and better food.",SM96w5Sh1emA0VQkXKmU8Q,0,0,3,-L0-ziePRChkZcY2eremnw

Too bad it was substandard :( They were out of ALL fresh fish, including salmon. Which narrows down the menu to shrimp and lobster, with lots of creamy,heavy sauces. I love alfredo sauce but the one on my shrimp and scallop linguine was bland, with tiny pieces of shrimp and scallops scattered throughout. 

My bf and I got the four course meal, which comes with soup, salad, entree and dessert. Reasonable deal. His mother and grandmother got the seafood trio, which didn't have too many options due to the fish shortage but they said it tasted alright. 

Our waiter Jesus was very attentive and I have nothing but positive things to say about him. Drinks were always filled and we didn't have to wait for anything once we were seated.

However, the food was just WAY too average for the high price tag, and I can't justify giving any more than two stars on this occasion.",wai1J7wtI5Wp0DUwy3QG2w,3,1,2,f8KA0EspIYA3Yb7__F1e3g

The server was good, helpful and doing her best. She could not be held responsible for the food. Biscuits were ok/good, but not great. That was the best part of our experience. 

19-year-old had lobster shrimp fettucine. It was okay. Just okay. It wasn't ""bad,"" but one would expect better from a seafood specialty restaurant.

Partner and I split the shrimp wrapped in bacon and steak with mashed potatoes and broccoli. We ordered the steak ""medium."" The shrimp was ""okay,"" but the bacon was undercooked and rubbery. the broccoli was good and not overly cooked. The mashed potatoes were runny and tasteless.

 The steak was browned on the outside, but bloody and red throughout. It was definitely ""rare."" We sent it back. The waitress explained that this was how they cooked their ""medium"" steaks. When the steak came back, it had been cooked a bit, but was still pink all the way through and ""rare."" We sent it back again. The waitress explained that ""next time"" we should order ""well done"" if we wanted ""medium."" We were still not happy, but they did cook the steak well the third time (which we took to go at this point). 

The manager came by with a laminated card showing a picture of how each steak should be cooked at ""rare,"" ""medium,"" etc. I was amazed: their corporate policy is to undercook steaks at each level (compared to what are standards for how steaks should be cooked everywhere I've ever been). (Did I mention I used to be a restaurant cook?) The manager did comp our meal, which was generous.

The staff really did their best, but the food was substandard and their policy on how to cook a steak is strange (and against industry standards). You can do better elsewhere.",la1T_Z1y9FWQEJK5Xa1YeQ,0,0,1,ns2LchlYvLT3V2a2NBKrdw

After returning to my table, I asked my server to summon the General Manager to our table, which she did, immediately.

When she arrived, I explained what I had seen and how I was ""grossed out"" by what I'd witnessed.  After apologizing, she excused herself and told us, ""I'll be right back.""

A few minutes later she returned to our table and said, ""I just fired him, and your meal is on me.""

3432246,2017-10-02,1,o0aGMe0ukXSJgd4QefM6cQ,"A couple of weeks ago we visited this Red Lobster location for the all you can eat shrimp special.

As we expected for a Friday night at 5:30, the wait time was 20-minutes.

I think because of where we were seated, we did not have the best customer service experience. Our server was pleasant and helpful. But because we were off in a corner and it was busy, it took a long while for a dish to come out. When it did and as we watched, our dinner 'floated' around the restaurant for a little bit until this other server noticed that we didn't have any food and by reason of elimination, made the connection that it belonged to us with the explanation, ""all the servers help one another out. its so busy in the kitchen that when they call out the table numbers, they all run together so I can't really make out which table the food belongs to.' Thanks for admitting that, I think.

So although the all you can eat shrimp was $17.99, the dishes are really greasy. As you get older, your digestive system can only handle so much grease.

As my husband's patience was growing noticeably thin about the wait time and the few times our server had forgotten a few times to drop off something at our table, my husband chalked up the slow service to our server being ""forgettable"".

I understand that people are working hard and I commend them for it. I have no experience working in a restaurant. But as a patron, I have experienced fabulous customer service in extremely busy environments. So I do expect with coaching, one can improve their customer service skills, especially in a very service oriented industry.

Our first server was a total d*** we were brought our drinks but threw us our straws on the table.  
He also brought us the famous cheddar bay biscuits, they where deli. (4).

Our second server seemed to be rushing us. As i have never been to this restaurant. She kept asking what i will be having. She didnt even give me a min more. 

My husbands plate was better and more full of shrimp then mine. By the way mine was more expensive. 

He loved his plate, me on the other hand i was not satisfied. I was not full nor was it the best ive ever had. 
the shrimp on my plate which their was two diff, kinds the one that was suppose to be cooked was raw.  (Someone cant tell me other wise. why, because im a shrimp lover.   I could have done a way better job myself. )  

The breaded shrimp on my plate was ok.  

The salad that came with my plate was gross three crutons too much dressing with a little bit off romaine lettuce.  Didnt even want too finish it 

My soda ran out it took the waiter a good min. Too notice  she then a couple mins later noticed and i was brought a full soda

Our cheddar bay biscuits finished before we even got our main course.  She never brought us more.

We where totally ignored. 

Even when we where done eating we had to get up and look for our own server. My husband had to go ask the hostess, she had to go look for her.

They ordered half the menu, had alcoholic drinks and half way thru they played the manager, that they got sick. Instead of getting them on the side somewhere, we had to see and hear the whole thing. They scammed the store, just get over it and get them out as quotas possible. I really didn't wanted to listen to them how sick they are and their fake throwing up. And one more thing bothered me.

4085528,2017-04-24,3,o0aGMe0ukXSJgd4QefM6cQ,"Red Lobster. It's the seafood equivalent to Applebees, Chili's, TGI Fridays...you know those chains. These places won't kill you with food poisoning but their food will generally be a level of 'whatever' that makes you reconsider why you spent 33 bucks on the crazy entree roulette wheel deal. 

I'm not a huge fan of fish or lobster unless I am near an ocean. There is no disappointment like getting gross fish. They had advertised a lobster roll sandwich deal. It sounds tempting but I know this game of disappointment. 

I went with tried and true popcorn shrimp and friend shrimp combo. I played the odds. It's hard to really mess up shrimp. If you get a bad shrimp, well, next one will be better. The popcorn and fried shrimp are basically the same thing, just different sizes. The cocktail sauce was just sad. Not a dab of horse radish to be found in that sauce. Eating shrimp and not getting a sinus clearing blast of horse radish? It didn't matter. We all know why most people go to Red Lobster anyway.

DEM CHEDDA BAY BISCUITS. 

I filled up on dem biscuits. Mashed potatoes had some garlic flavor in there. My Italian dressing needed more salad, but I guess that's my fault for not asking for dressing on the side. I made the right choice in the end. \

Other people got the lobster roll combo. While everyone else's salads came out, they explained that the salad comes with the lobster roll itself. When the roll did come out, it was apparent why the salad came with the meal. The lobster roll was tiny, even for roll sandwich standards. It also came with approximately 7 french fries. The lobster looked closer to imitation crab meat. I thought to myself, ""at least I didn't spend so much money on my disappointment.""",y1b_9KmwNUWG1AS3CazFLA,2,2,2,RdJiUF5-xCGv55iaYEIHEA

4259481,2010-07-03,0,o0aGMe0ukXSJgd4QefM6cQ,"This is one of our favorite chain restaurants. Is it the cheddar bay biscuits? Is it the Endless Shrimp promotion for $16.99 each, from August to November? Is it the service? It could be a combination of all these things. We've been to this location the most compared to the others (Decatur & Oahu) over the years. This one usually has a wait on the weekends- it seems to be the most popular out of the three locations here. Sometimes passing by, I see people outside sitting on the benches. And the parking lot is usually pretty filled. 

I've had some of the other dishes here and yes, portions are not that great (for seafood). So, we come mainly for the Endless Shrimp event. It is not a buffet. The server brings you the order when you get the urge for a new dish (kinda like the Sizzler, with the all you can eat shrimp). Note: the shrimp linguine alfredo takes a while to cook, so order that first. You can choose from the following: shrimp scampi, coconut bites (used to be divine when they used Captain Morgan's rum, a few years back), popcorn shrimp, shrimp on skewers, and the linguine alfredo (the best out of all of these choice). The server starts us off with the famous warm cheddar chive biscuits. I try to have just one because I don't want to fill up too fast. The server asks you for your two choices (and then go from there). It's easy to get full with this event that we love so much. Everything is delicious. Ok, the shrimp is not going to be huge, at this price. But this is still a good value overall. The service: the hosts are always welcoming, the servers here are all very good and attentive (refilling glasses and asking if we'd like to place another order for more shrimp). If you are still hungry, try the warm chocolate chip lava cookie- it's really yummy. Oh, I almost forgot to mention that when you walk in, you feel like you have been transported to New England. It's got a fun nautical theme. Booths & table seating available. 

If you join the e-mail club, you can print off dated coupons (usually expire in a month). The lunches start off at $6.99 per person. I've had the soup combos, served in a sourdough bowl- it's pretty good.",fiGqQ7pIGKyZ9G0RqWLMpg,3,3,4,C7agVaqD_O3iWzf5fteXiw

My son loves crab legs so this is a good time to check out RL.

The service was outstanding.  Our waitress- Ardell was very very attentive and really deserved the big tip I gave her. 

I AM disappointed in the portions of the crab- as if it was anorexic.  Am I just too spoiled with the LV buffets???
My ceasar salad was ok- the leaves were quite wilted and a bit too much on the dressing.  
The biscuits were always as good as I remember. 
I had asked for medium on the steak and it was barely pink inside which made it quite tough.  When I told the waitress about it,...she took it and was gonna get me the steak the way I wanted it originally and w/out hesitation.  
Got the Alfredo and I was gonna get the shrimp w/ it but Ardell tempted me w/ the crab alfredo.  Yum....that was a good choice. 
My steak finally came but I was already done eating.  
By this time the manager came to the table and I did not even have to ask- she informed me I will only get charged for two choices rather than three because the steak was not done right. 
HOW NICE...
My son was satisfied w/ his crab legs.....he was just so happy he got them.

Service was really good here, staff is very attentive and friendly.

I was whisked away to RL over this past weekend for a dinner birthday celebration for my brother. He wanted lobster, my parents immediately thought of RL. I really wish we had gone somewhere else.

Everything in this place is salted beyond belief. I guarantee you they serve the food this way because they are catering to the general American public and the general American public have an overly iodized taste (in my opinion). I ordered one of their shrimp dishes, and selected the shrimp scampi and seafood stuffed shrimps. YUCK on both accounts. The shrimp ""scampi"" was coated in butter I'm very certain and it was horrendous. The stuffed shrimps were not any better. My salad came out slathered in ranch dressing (I should have asked for it on the side). The famous little cheddar bay biscuits were okay, but pretty dry.

The rest of my family got dishes with lobster tails, and I did have a few bites of the lobster. It was good, but nothing spectacular. However, I really have never had amazing lobster. But I doubt I'll ever get it at RL.

My favorite dish was the appetizer we ordered off of the ""build your own"" appetizer selection. We selected clam strips and mozzarella sticks. Well, it's pretty damn hard to mess up clam strips and I thought they were yummy. I think the mozzarella sticks could have been heated up a BIT more, but they were good none the less.

Our waitress was very nice, good humored, and very quick. She kept our drinks filled and was an all around champ about getting our food and clearing our plates. However - it was definitely mentioned that my brother was having a birthday - and NOTHING! No complimentary dessert! Seriously, RL? That was just really disappointing.

Needless to say I have no intention of ever returning to Red Lobster. If I'm going to throw down money on seafood it better be some effing good seafood and I know I'm not going to get it here.",hZfzVrhsCQ9JDAb2jYoJNQ,1,0,2,r43q1hrulrhlSpDDDvVpCA

I got there just after 11am. The place was pretty empty, which worked out because the service I received was exceptional. I went with the Crab and Shrimp Linguine. Along with my garden salad came some biscuits. They were extremely salty. Disappointing. Then came the linguine. That was also pretty salty. Fortunately, my palate mellowed out and I enjoyed the dish overall.

What won me over, or more accurately, what saved them from a borderline 2-star rating, was the service. Everything came out extremely quickly and the servers were very attentive. Halfway through the entrée, the waiter just automatically gave me a to-go box in case I didn't finish. I'm guessing it's because I had asked about the difference between the lunch and full portions. Honestly, I was planning to eat it all, but his gesture saved me from an unnecessarily full stomach and gave me a nice mid-afternoon meal. Not only that, as I was boxing up the pasta, he even offered to give me extra biscuits (I declined of course).

So the verdict? Red Lobster is A-OK. The food was somewhat disappointing, but they made up for it with great service. In fact, I think I was in and out of there in about 20 minutes!",YwaKGmRNnSa3R3N4Hf9jLw,3,2,3,aOwBTfUM7vbDASEGacjHIg

It was my second time at this location and I liked it much better than the Red Lobster on Decatur. This restaurant was cleaner, had nicer decor and staff was more focused on welcoming you than shoving you at whatever table they could find. 

My selections for the limited time 4 course meal included, New England Clam Chowder, Caesars Salad, Scallop-Shrimp Alfredo pasta and the Chocolate Brownie a la mode instead of the Apple Frittata this time. This dinner of course came with the famous unlimited cheddar biscuits. 

The soup was creamy, not the best I've had, but I really enjoyed it. Now the salad was delish, just enough dressing, crunchy, crispy and fresh. Now let's talk about that pasta. The Alfredo sauce was 3x better than the Olive Garden! The shrimp and scallops were cooked on point. Very well seasoned, super creamy. 

I was kinda full and the waitress was super nice, she asked if I wanted my dessert packed to go! Not many places do that, you eat there or you miss out! I wanted my frittata warm so I opted to have it served. The apple frittata was small, in my opinion perfect size for an after dinner dessert. 

-This second time around the chocolate browny was not as good, it was chocolate extreme to me. I should of went for the the Apple Frittata again.-

Most places that do the number course meals, as offers, tend to always give you smaller size, salads, smaller main courses, but NOT RED LOBSTER! Hurry up and grab some dinner, this special is limited and ending soon!",XT06McUUgrEVvkJZyN26WQ,4,2,5,-oou8iHBRSAO6BXyyST_cA

Went here for lunch (around 3 pm).
Our waiter seemed overly annoyed to be at work and rushed us through lunch.
The food 
Fried shrimp and fries: fries were hot and fresh and the fried shrimp was well seasoned and cleaned (some red lobster locations do not clean the shrimp).

1lb of snow crab with corn on the cob and mashed potatoes: the snow crab was hot....but not exactly fresh. Tasted as though they mixed some of the old crab with some of the new. Mashed potatoes were very good! Corn on the cob tasted microwaved:/

Water glasses had food stuck to the inside of them .....:( had to ask for new ones. Probably wont be back. Too many other options in the area.",HT4r0tWm2D4TsUa3q9i-Rw,4,0,3,9afLPULzBylIv80D1XRbrQ

The outside looks like a dock house in Maine.  When you walk in, you'll see a lobster tank which reminds you where you're at.  The place is dark and intimate.  There's huge dark brown wooden beams and the overall lighting is low.  I was hoping the booths were a little bigger, but loved the windows looking outside.  Our server's name was Penny and she was super nice.  Refilled my water as soon as it hit half full which I appreciated.  

For dinner, we started off getting the Lobster-Crab-and-Seafood stuffed mushrooms for $8.99.  Fresh mushrooms stuffed with seafood, smothered in Monterey Jack cheese and baked golden brown.  It was served in a baking dish and so delicious!  The dish came with 6 large mushrooms.  The cheese came with a slight crust from the browning and I loved it!!  For my entree, I got the Lobsterfest Rock Island Stuffed Tilapia for $18.99.  This dish was fresh tilapia roasted with crab-and-seafood stuffing and topped with Maine lobster meat in a creamy lobster butter sauce. Served with fresh broccoli and wild rice.  The stuffing was a little mushy and seemed like a lot of filling, however the rest was great!!  Loved the wild rice.  It was flavored so well, yet so simple.  The lobster cream sauce was definitely 75% butter and lovely!  The tilapia was nicely cooked and the Maine lobster claw meat was a nice touch!

Red Lobster is a humble place, but so on point!  I'm so glad that this place has made my top list for chain restaurants.  I will definitely be coming back to this place.  You should too!",CNaaizAUc2c4WIb1M3BBPw,1,1,4,bsSgj1Ex5vmfWh6SCQotVw

I noticed at the front there was a sign stating apologies since they were still under construction. Upon entering it was hard to notice that this was the case. Oddly it seemed less than half full but there was a 5min wait. Ok, no big deal. The restaurant as a whole seemed nice n clean. Upon sitting I did see there was some minor touches unfinished but nothing that would bother anyone, even if anyone did notice it. Our server was the bartender which was a bit of a surprise. First time I've ever seen a bartender given tables on top of serving the bar and filling the drink orders. Jeff was very nice and courteous and even though at times it seemed like he was doing multiple things at once, he didn't let it hamper the service. I had the southwest chicken burger & fries. The center of the bottom bun got stuck to the plate. There was a small opening and the liquid from the toppings & burger were starting to seep through. Guess the skewer opened a hole and there was enough liquid to start leaking. Aside from that the burger & fries were good.
When I got the check, I noticed he forgot to include a drink that was ordered($7 difference) and pointed it out to him. He was thankful for the honesty, so he told us to not worry about it, he wouldn't charge for that drink. What a nice guy, left him a little extra for that.

She made sure I was penciled in and her professionalism definitely made me comfortable. Upon my arrival, I checked in with Nicole and after letting her know my name and my seated reservation, not only did she looked at me with confusion but she sent me to wrong seated reservation area under the impression that my party had already arrived. After I told her that my reservation was for 7 not anything before 7, so I definitely checked in early. She then told me with an attitude that ""we didn't have anything reserved for you"" I was completely upset after that remark! She then checked in her calendar and with her sarcastic remark she responds with ""oh I do see your name now, it's because the calendar was faced the other way, so I didn't know"" of course she didn't know which is why when I checked in, I would've appreciated that she paid attention to when I said my name, who I spoke to and what time my seated reservation was for! My table was not even ready and we were then told to wait until the rest of the party shows to be seated! Had I had known that disclosure, I would've told my entire party to be there at 6:45 when I arrived so we can at least sit down and have an appetizer. Check in was horrible!

The service was way to much, there were about 6 customers and about 8-10 servers in the restaurant and the servers didn't  have stations so every minute you'd have a server coming by asking you the same question 4 other people just asked us...sooo annoying, our waiter chris was a nice guy and a good server but he messed with customers heads alittle to much, saying jokes that made us feel rude that we didnt laugh because we didnt understand what he was talking about, but when he asked how my food was and i said ""gross"" he was like ""ohhh you should of told me i'd get the manager for you right now if you want"" i said ""no i'll go to arbys down the street but thank you"" he was saying that i should just talk to the manager and take care of it but at that point i just wanted to get out of that place.In walkes a single mom with 5 little kids with her and they sat them right next to us, the mother of the kids actually said to the server ""my kids are loud maybe we should sit somewhere else"" then looked and me, i just smiled because it was true and i really appreciated her being thoughtful of others, so the server says ""ohh no this is fine"" luckly the kids were not that bad at all, phew.  The host was just a freak, he was staring at us the entire time we were in the restaurant and wouldnt even look away when we stared back at him like ""whaaaaaat"" ???? then some other server or hostess came by with our bill and said ""for your convenience"" which i wanted to say ""it's not ""convenient"" to pay 100 bucks for the worst seafood ever""!!!  (but i didnt i just wanted to escape and fast) so she fails to give me a pen, so i see the host walking by and i say to him ""do you have a pen""? and he says ""not on me"" and pats his pockets, then a server came by and said ""ohhh i have one""..I looked at my partner and said ""NOT ON ME ? ARE YOU KIDDING?  so walking out the door two girls held the doors for us with smiles and have a good day blah blah blah, so as we are leaving right outside the door is a huge pile of trash so we actually had to step over and into trash "" well we thought it was over, then (yes there's more) we were stuck in our car for 5 minutes while two other cars sat behind us arguing about something, it was just so amazing how bad it was.

""David, it's your birthday, let's go celebrate at Red Lobster"". ""You know Red Lobster has a four course meal for $15"". Finally the day has come where dad gets to be the king. Father's Day was the chance to take him to the place where he has been wanting to go to and get it out of his system. Sadly, on the way home, the conversation was centered around how cheap they were with the quality of seafood and how this place used to be the it place to go.

The four course meal is a deal at $15. You get a choice of bacon potato soup or New England clam chowder to begin. It is followed by a garden or Caesar salad. The starters are accompanied by their cheddar cheese biscuits. At this point I was full and there were still two courses to go. My parents and I ordered the butter herb chicken and shrimp while my sister got the mango habenero coconut shrimp. I found my dish to be extremely salty. I had a few bites, but the rest was taken home to be eaten with white rice or something bland. The two chicken breast and eight small shrimp was more than I was expecting at this price. My sister's shrimp platter came with two skewers of grilled shrimp as well as a nest of golden fried morsels. This was the better of the two dishes as I was not gulping down cups of water after each bite. With most of it packed away, I was not feeling dessert, but it came with the meal. Three slices of key lime pie and an order of the cinnamon donuts came out. The key lime was not as tart as I am used to, but the balance of sweet to sour was good. The donuts were a little on the dry side, but was not sickeningly sweet.

After this experience, maybe my dad will stop insisting on Red Lobster and we can go back to Chinatown for less. Anyways, it was a nice Father's Day.",N3oNEwh0qgPqPP3Em6wJXw,0,0,2,Vb4HDjbA3-_xRUAo4y2o3w

I've been to Red Lobster a grand total of 4 times in my entire life. Why? Because half of my family has a shellfish allergy so of course my family never came here because we didn't want only half the family to walk out, the other half being wheeled out by paramedics. 

I went here tonight for my friend Gracie's husband's birthday dinner. We didn't have to wait long for a table and our waitress was decent. Waters were a little slow on the refills, but I've had waiters literally leave a pitcher of water at the table because I drink a lot of water, fast. 

The three of us all got the endless shrimp for $15.99. I ordered mine with absolutely no sides, except a house salad. Skip the biscuits, skip the potatoes, pasta and rice. I think I ordered like... 6 or 7 skewers of the grilled shrimp, 1 parmesan shrimp and 1 coconut shrimp.  More protein, less filler carbs! I'm sure all of that shrimp added up to like 5 oz of meat but whatever - our waitress was still giving us crazy looks when we kept ordering shrimp. 

Coconut shrimp was extremely bomb. It was like dessert...but meat...but still dessert. Genius! 

I might go back if I'm dying for shrimp because it's a pretty good deal.",OLn8EvPsu4hNug8V5PF2jA,3,3,4,XI0d4-Rbfhbqc87S7Y6wqw

5811352,2015-12-08,1,o0aGMe0ukXSJgd4QefM6cQ,"Been here a few times over the years.
I came here with a friend not too long ago. The food is not too bad here for being a seafood chain restaurant it is always pretty consistent and the quality is usually the same.
When walking in the door till you leave everyone is always friendly and makes your visit enjoyable.
The cheddar bay biscuits are always good when they first come out hot. Its hard not to eat them they are so good! I think when someone says something about Red Lobster this is the first thing you think about.
Unless they have a special I think their prices can be a bit high, I love seafood and I think your limited to what seafood they offer here, Example full belly fried Oysters, or full belly clams fried.
That would be awesome to find here, and some things are seasonal. I really like when they have the all you can eat shrimp special. 
Over all Its not a bad place to go if you like prepared seafood dishes at a chain restaurant.. 

We had a great dinner , no problems. Would def come back sometime!",zH6racrZ7rUqqv_Qy6dZDQ,3,1,4,xkgFDwiwLdMPDV-QL0IqxQ

The food was always on point and it just was the best seafood I've had in awhile. Not to mention it was always so fresh! - I was never able to get a picture of my food before devouring it but it was good, and for the amount of food you get the Ultimate Feast's price was well worth it!",0RWKtBFmLTFb8Cuhb3azMg,0,0,5,VfEZasHKtJAA2nou1hsl5g
5848931,2015-03-02,2,o0aGMe0ukXSJgd4QefM6cQ,"OK so Red Lobster is classic as I have been eating at this establishment since I was a kid since the 80's. This is the spot for celebrations of birthdays and such for us, maybe two or three times a year.

This last visit was a treat for my birthday and my first time at this location. I usually visit the location on Decatur as it is closer to home.

Anyhow, I am boring, I always order the same dinner, the seaside trio which is shrimp linguini, fried shrimp and shrimp scampi.  I am a shrimp eater, what can I say? Mmmmm all of that buttery scampi juice going wild in my mouth, it was truly welcome and delectable. 

The service was great, the food was delicious as always and pretty much what we always expect. Although I had to work off the calorie intake from this meal with three sessions, it was well worth the splurge.

If you have eaten at RL before than you know what it is all about, if not than check it out.",deL6e_z9xqZTIODKqnvRXQ,4,2,5,T1o7EGDCdRtr_vUVFKqVwA

I got a shrimp Caesar salad as an appetizer. My shrimp was so crunchy!!! And the size was huge. Then as a main dish I got a big sampler of fried shrimp, shrimp Alfredo and baked shrimp. It was excellent and so big that you can share it with your partner. And of course the famous Red Lobster bread! It's a legend. The service was very fast and friendly. And the prices are fair.
