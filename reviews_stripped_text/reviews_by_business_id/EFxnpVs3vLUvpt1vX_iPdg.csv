Came here for meatball Parm and as I walked by the kitchen the person cooking food was on his cell phone not making anything but the microwave was going . I asked if that was my meatballs in the microwave and he confirmed . It looked as though the kitchen was closed , nothing was going on @ all . Just a guy standing around on his phone .

I did try the stuffed green pepper lunch special once, and it was very good. The food here  has never disappointed. As for the Beef sandwich, it's just the right amount of wet and the sweet peppers are tasty. The fries are nothing special, but they are fresh and hot.  I do recommend getting the fries on a separate plate to keep them crisp otherwise the sandwich will soggy them out pretty quick. Overall a nice little spot to eat lunch with daily specials.

However, the other day I stopped in and looked at the menu.  They had Chicago Italian Beef sandwiches on the menu.  I asked the waitress how it was, and she said it was her favorite, and was a big seller in the restaurant.  So I decided to try it.  I have tried Italian beef at Windy's Beefs and dogs, the Chicago Hot Dog place on Rancho, and south Eastern, all of which have been acceptable if not great.  The Sonio's beef sandwich came, and after the first bit, I almost swooned.  The best beef sandwich I have found outside of Chicago, where I was born and raised.  It was wonderful, just spicy enough, sweet peppers sliced thinly, bread wet (altho I needed at little more au jus).  My only complaint, if there is one, is that the fries were just not crisp enough.  Tasted good, and I ate a lot of them, but I would have preferred them a little crisper.   However, I can't wait to go back for another one!",-8bfKCvDClxD3iKX9o7J5w,3,1,4,GlF-ExHfrhZcWSqMFTLqxw

We went for lunch. My first impression was it's authentic. It seemed like a place you grow up going to as a kid. I ordered the roast beef sandwich and it was delicious! The meat had been marinated for a while and it tasted like it. She got the caesar salad with the gyro meat. The meat was awesome! Cooked well and the seasoning was amazing. I definitely recommend this place for some good eats. 

My only issue with the restaurant is it seemed a little less refined. The bowl the salad came in was chipped and our table wobbled quite a bit. Other than that it was perfect. I will definitely be back!",GQQieareg5cwIAHw7stigA,1,1,4,RiU2UM_MlpQRrUrde2rTjA

They are supposedly famous for their rotisserie chicken, but to be honest I think that the stuff at Albertson's/Vons is better (and cheaper). In fact, even though rotisserie is supposed to help the fat drain away from the chicken, I nearly gagged on a gob of fat. Gross!

The food is supposed to be Mexican (or something) but it's pretty blah. There are no spices and the flavors are pretty much what a Midwesterner might interpret Mexican food to be. They insisted that the guacamole is made fresh, but when I asked for a batch that didn't contain tomatoes, they balked saying that they used all the avocados in the morning to make that day's guac. Uh, ok. That doesn't sound very fresh. Even Baja Fresh will give me a slice of avocado. 

The salads are large and people seem to like that and it also seems to be the best deal in the place. The quesadillas are ok, but then again, it's pretty hard to mess up a quesadilla that just has (rotisserie) chicken in it and cheese.",Uw-v0UN_g_oFvldC7HWXMg,0,0,2,gtCCXbpBlkrLOsY6Mfk2nQ

Great Salads, huge portions. Chinese Chicken Salad and Mexican Caesar Salads are both great options. The greek salad is also a popular item, but I personally was never a fan of greek dressing, I don't know why but I never was, and they put kalmata olives in it, which I just don't like olives in general.

I got the Italian beef sandwich, wet w/cheese and peppers and gardiniere. It came with fries and extra jus, which I promptly forgot once I bit into that heavenly sandwich. It was perfection! It was also ridiculously enormous, I couldn't even eat half.

Hubby did better with his Italian Beef/Sausage combo sandwich, and it was even bigger. I had a taste of the sausage, it was quite good.

Drove past this place repeatedly, but when I wanted to give them a try they were closed: only open M-Thurs til 5:30PM, and on Fridays til 4PM. Limited hours unless you work nearby. Interior reminds me of an old school mexican restaurant.

Stopped by for an early dinner, love that they have a menu of 3PM-close specials.
Ordered the lunch portion of salad with chicken (spicy mexican caesar) and the chicago beef (hot and sweet peppers), upgrade fries to Greek style. Used Yelp check-in discount for 10% off, total was under $15 including tip. Not bad for two meals! Cashier was genuinely friendly, packed up order perfectly, and wished me a good day on my way out the door- unusual to see someone so perky so close to close after a long day of working that type of position!

Salad was fresh and delish- packed in an ingenious way, with ingredients in a ziplock to add your dressing (packed separately) and toss, then serve in your to-go box. So smart! Downside is that they gave me the wrong dressing (regular caesar instead of spicy) and I found a few small bones, but it was still damn delicious. Just wish I had some hard boiled eggs at home to add in.

The chicago beef? It was so good, I barely got a bite before my BF made it disappear in under 5 minutes. You know it's good when that happens! The au jus is one of the best I've had, the bread was clearly fresh, and the meat was moist and plentiful. Peppers were tasty, too!

It's so close by and so well-priced with the specials, that I know I'll be coming back for another salad soon. And yes, probably a chicago beef for my guy.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,2,2,4,yTEb6GvXsbd-pD8sqjciDw

Been coming here for years ever since I moved to Vegas and my co-workers took me here on my first day. Sonio's serves a variety of foods including rotissierie chicken, salads in ginormous bowls, 2 lb burritos and Chicago style Italian beef and sausage. Uncle Teddy, the owner, is originally from Chicago and if you're lucky he'll stop by your table to chat. They are only open from 11 am to 5:30 pm on weekdays mainly to serve the downtown business lunch crowd, and the staff here seems to remember all their regulars which is impressive. It can get busy here during the 11 am to 1 pm lunch hours but they move quick and there's never too long a wait before a table clears up.

I typically like to get the Chinese chicken salad, Chicago style hot dogs, Italian sausage or a combo sandwich. The Chinese chicken salad comes w/ the shredded rotissierie chicken that they roast daily, mandarin oranges and a light vinagrette dressing among other things and is overall a refreshing and filling salad especially with the portions they give here. Their Chicago style foods like the Italian beef/sausage/combo sandwich tastes even better with a side of giardiniera or G as they call it here, although it does cost a little extra.

They sometimes will have a special item that they made just for that day which is nice if you want something different. Some of the specials I've seen are lasagna or meatball subs. I've recommended this place to several friends who are not Yelpers but all of them now love this place. It's conveniently located if you work in the area and serve up great food that is made to order and comes out fast and fresh.",zBi_JWB5uUdVuz3JLoAxGQ,0,1,5,F_653owBQO94KMpnjCEb0A
2385018,2011-07-01,0,EFxnpVs3vLUvpt1vX_iPdg,"Just a quick review for now.  Today was my first time eating at Sonio's but I have heard goo dthings about this place.  I almost didn't have lunch today as it was so hot out that I didn't want to leave my office, but around 1:00PM I finally decided to go out.  Although I didn't know where I wanted to go I drove around first until I ended up on Valley View.  I was going to go to the food court at the Meadows mall until I remembered that Sonio's was just around the corner so I went right instead of left.  

I walked in and it wasn't busy...but oddly the parking lot appeared to be packed with cars.  I was greeted by a very nice lady who directed me to the counter for to go orders as I initially wanted my food for take out.  I got to the cashier, and never seeing the menu, the first thing that caught my eye was the fire dog and fries combo so I just ordered that for quickness.  I ended up eating it there because once again I got lazy and figured by the time I get back to my office the hot dog and fries will be soggy.  So I sat at one of the tables in the corner when my order shortly arrived.  It took about 10 minutes so it was pretty quick.  The hot dog was good but a bit on the soggy side (Chicago style with mustard, sport peppers, green relish on a poppy seed bun), the fries were so so (frozen crinkle cut fries) but fried crispy.  

Maybe next time I'll try a burrito or a wrap...",75COHfu_drTAx1G9rtZnAA,1,2,3,YffOTAnSKuULVUz3gkX0bg

Ordering a business lunch from Sonio's was a horrible idea-- the Yelp reviews indicate Sonio's has been serving the area for over 25 years, but under new ownership they have no right to claim they're the same restaurant. The delivery driver was over an hour late, the food was very low quality, they got our order incorrect, and we ended up having to file a fraud claim with our credit card company. Do NOT order from here.  

Apparently they're under new ownership and the new owner is also the delivery driver (a delivery driver who laughed at our CEO for complaining about the delay and blamed us for getting lost even after we called him numerous times to no avail). The manager, Lily, promised to refund our meal, asked us for personal and credit card information, and then refused to process the refund.

Not to mention by 11am (the said opening time) they had at least 6 tables. Glad we got here when we did. 
Off top I could tell this was a mom and pop, mostly regulars type of joint.

My love and I got a Mexican Caesar salad to split. When she brought us EACH out a huge wooden bowl full of salad, I thought there was a mistake. THIS IS ONE SALAD??? (lights shine down from above while music plays)
I hate it when things say ""spicy"" and then are not. NOT AN ISSUE HERE!! Spicy lived up to its name. 
We went with the Italian beef and Italian sausage, with sweet and hot peppers, wet, add cheese. He got fries, I went with the pasta salad as a side. 
HOLY WORDS I CAN NOT SAY ON YELP!!!! 
Seriously we just got this full off $30. One of the owners (or family members) even stopped by our table and said ""wow for first timers I am impressed, are you from Chicago?""
We told him no, we just know good food, and we will be back! He realized last minute we were yelpers and said ""make sure you write something nice!"" He didn't realize I was already planning and writing my 5 star review since the salad.

3856011,2015-08-01,1,EFxnpVs3vLUvpt1vX_iPdg,"I've been coming to Sonio's since 2004. 

Why? 

1) The food is consistently good. Sonio's has a varied menu of offerings. Their most famous (and longest running) item would be the rotisserie chicken. They also have Mexican food ranging from chicken tacos, enchiladas or their 2 pound burrito that is the size of some people's shoes.  Speaking of gigantic, check out the salads. They don't skimp on the ingredients and the salads are served in wooden bowls large enough for punch. There are newer things on the menu ranging from sausage sandwiches, stuffed bell peppers or lasagna (Mama Mia!). Needless to say, unless you have a tape worm or are a competitive eater, you should be full with whatever you order. The portions are generous on most dishes!

Vegetarian? No problem. They have many things to cater to you.

Looking for Paleo or Low Carb options? They have that too!

For the amount of food and the variety of people they cater to, the prices are more than fair. 

2) The service is excellent. This is a family run business and if you become a regular there, the staff will remember your name. It's such a great feeling when I'm walking in and Lily or Yiorgo will greet me by my name. Uncle Teddy can usually be seen hanging out in his booth and he's always asking me, ""How's your boyfriend? You tell 'im I said hi.""  or ""How've you been? Good to see you!"" Matt will constantly check on my table to make sure the drinks are always full. These interactions don't make me feel like just another customer, but rather like a VIP or part of the family. Every single time, the quality of service from this team shines and I always leave feeling full from the food and fulfilled from the hospitality. 



These two reasons are why I keep coming to Sonio's and why I will continue to give them my business. It's rare to find a local homegrown place where you get that kind of experience with a good fresh meal to boot. These are the kinds of businesses that Vegas need to support. 

If you're in the area and looking for a laid back local lunch spot, I encourage you to give Sonio's a try. Oh, and tell the crew I said, ""Hi."" ;)",BWnz69daxDZIkc5g6uEGpA,1,0,5,SNPPcXmQ5hFx6LSGvTDhIg

We decided to stay authentic and go Chicago style with that special too which includes 2 Hotdogs with sauerkraut,mayo, and onions with french fries for $8.99. What a great deal too? One must experience meatballs if getting their Chicago on! So we paired the hotdogs with a four order of meatballs in sauce too. 

The food being Chicago style also transported us back to when we visited there. This was my twin sons experience with sauerkraut it takes me back to when I first tried mine in Germany. Actually we talked about it over lunch. The meatballs were oh so good and made to perfection.

It was packed during lunch, which is not unusual- it's kind of small and situated in a strip mall across the street from the Las Vegas Valley Water District on Charleston/Valley View. The salads are huge. (If you are not hungry, I would recommend splitting it or ordering something else.) I got the chinese chicken salad (fave salad), which I really enjoyed. My friend got a different salad (she'd been here before, many times). We each sampled a bit of each other's salad, but I liked mine better. Also available are sandwiches.

I don't usually write reviews, but I had to commend the staff here. I will definitely be returning again.",lbG3UArCEb-hOmdrO1iH_w,0,0,5,pNVg8yHnxB8lMTGFtjnTwg

If all the places I've eaten an Italian Beef or here, Sonio's tops the list.  The price is reasonable, especially because it includes fries.  The beef contains a good amount of meat, and is seasoned about the best that I've ever had.

I've also had a few of their salads.  All are good sized and always fresh.  The staff is friendly; Uncle Teddy is always around to ensure you have a great experience.    Sonio's Cafe is a solid local business that deserves plenty of Vegas support, especially from Chicagoans looking for a beef or dog.",L4wssW3_b2UAnI6uErOggA,0,0,5,RBEm0fAI9yK_KvA011zGeQ

Once they switched to plastic utensils, the overall character seemed to change too.  But, they bounced back,  I'm not sure what it was, but they got it back. And that is good news for chicken fans everywhere.",5lOtqU-BVcGdangJNy9kXw,1,1,4,NqCEYyBHwYnXTRmmywCw2w

The wraps and rotisserie chicken are among the best.  The also do Mexican food well.  Extensive menu, fast service and friendly ambience make Sonio's the go to neighborhood lunch place.  Vegetarian-friendly.",WM7MFrRP-7YFuGBAJ6quRQ,0,0,4,xR-01hw1fXMaj8buJ-7cfQ

I actually found out about it when I worked near there and couldn't find much to eat for lunch in the area. I was delighted to find a healthy option. And, I stop in every time I'm near by from across town. When I went there for the first time I got to meet the owners and they were very welcoming. These guys have a class act of providing original recipes for the main dishes they serve and you can enjoy taking home their canned sauces and condiments. One of the best parts is, if you are out of time to cook for your family dinner you can grab a huge tray of lasagna and pop that goodness into the oven at home. My family loves it! Please never under estimate the savory flavors of an original Chicago dog and stop in soon! Highly recommend!",lezrRiKYN5UiCKeHFOY4oA,0,0,5,a4lkCLYAFEPngymH6WtgTw

The gentlemen at the cashier was super friendly and helpful, even in the midst of what was clearly a busy time. He gave great pointers and recommendations. The food was awesome...I had the rotisserie chicken and my coworker the Italian Beef. Definitely a new found favorite.",8jEV6OyFutmzIV_wT6kadQ,0,0,5,E1Uz5vy4r4LkaRs4typl5Q

Everyone's askin you if you need anything or if they can help you with something. The menu is a little smattering of everything. There's some Greek food, some Mexican, with Chicago style hot dogs and deli sandwiches. I was thisclose to trying the Mexican food, but then I ordered the Firedog with fries. SUPER YUMMY! It totally hit the spot. My buddies said their beef sandwiches were pretty legit too. Stop in here for some good food and AMAZING service. Oh this place tends to get packed at kunchtime, so try to swing in early!",cuCf5ydDSmXAgAeCf8ELtA,0,0,4,A9PCfKiQvmJeJ5Xp1azkFg
5959778,2011-03-04,3,EFxnpVs3vLUvpt1vX_iPdg,"Another food excursion we made due to our Groupon. 

Tried the Chinese Chicken Rollup and the Combo Chicken Rollup. A little on the expensive side, but the food quantities are pretty big, so I guess that evens out. We ended up sharing one Rollup and saving the other for lunch the next day. The food was a little on the oily side. I wish it wasn't so saturated in oil. The potatoes were pretty oily and underseasoned as well. I think the chicken is good and fresh, but a little dry and also underseasoned.

Overall, it was ok, but since their hours are so limited, the food is a little bland and it's not particularly close to me, I probably won't be back too often.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,5,3,2,YvY0YYILkRybuZE4GIgV-w

The owner was actively working the place and told us to call ahead, he will reserve tables for larger groups. The seating is designed for a party of four. The food was great and large portions.
