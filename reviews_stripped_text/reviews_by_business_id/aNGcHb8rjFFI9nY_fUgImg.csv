We decided to try out this restaurant due to it offered variety of food.  We ordered the Kona chopped salad, sweet-chili glazed salmon, and basil pesto linguine, the dishes were delicious and very well prepared. The price was also reasonable.  We sat at the corner with a very nice purple lighting back ground, the pictures came out make us look like we were dining in an expensive restaurant :)) Definitely will go back to this restaurant next time we visit Las Vegas.",491p3XzBlFQfA5F6GDi2SA,1,1,5,tOJuBvToaKc_N2dt3OLX4g
101467,2016-06-08,1,aNGcHb8rjFFI9nY_fUgImg,"Came to Vegas for the weekend from the California Bay Area. My girl and I were looking for a good late lunch/happy hour spot and came across this place. SO GOOD. Not even kidding, we came back the very next day. Awesome decor and atmosphere, nice open-air bar with outside patio seating. AMAZING happy hour! As I said I'm from the Bay Area so I'm used to tiny bite-sized portions for the money you pay, you get so much here! BBQ flatbread was basically a full-sized pizza for $7! Love the fusion of cuisine, with plenty of sushi and non-sushi items. I manage at a high-end Japanese restaurant and I have to say the sushi was great and reasonably priced. Everything we ate was delicious. Manny was a great bartender, very friendly and even gave us ""tourist advice"" as far as cool stuff to do and check out. This will be a mandatory stop whenever I go to Vegas.
My only drawback is that the 2nd day we went there (which was a Saturday) they don't offer happy hour but the menus are still on the table and bar top. We had a different server that day and he didn't let us know until we got our check and I asked him about it. Not a huge deal, but he saw us order off the happy hour menu and didn't tell us that we would be paying full price. Simple solution - take the happy hour menus away if it's not happy hour!
Other than that, definitely recommend. 5 stars",JgCnnYm2GW2iOPwvDmrrkQ,2,1,5,wp9KBa0JsiGWjmp4VC5Kdw

Thank you Jose for your reply, and I also feel sorry about my experience at Kona. My intention to write the original review was to find out if this practice was taking place under the management 's disregard, and presumably by what you meant by having a diverse work environment, I should conclude my concern was borrowed. However, I wanted to address I brought up this question because it is true that Asian tourists do not share the same culture as Americans do, which may frustrate the servers at times. Some restaurants on the strip encourage them to tip by displaying a little sign next to the checkbook holder, which consists of 4-5 different Asian languages. So to be honest, I am not really getting what you meant by ""nationality issue,"" unless you intended to categorize Asians as a single national. Furthermore, I bet you had an adequate conversation with your staffs about the addressed issue before you commented here, but I still wonder how having staffs of 20 different nationalities can assure you that the service given by a particular individual was free of any issue. An Asian American who is an American national may choose to provide a bad service to Asian customers due to the listed reason. Here, I am not implying that my server's behavior was based on her racial prejudice or anything, but your comment does not seem to be a satisfactory explanation of the incidence. Instead, I am getting a much more reasonable answer from fellow yelpers than from your comment as you can clearly see, several customers of different ethnicities have attested to the worst service of life at Kona Fashion show as I did. Nonetheless, I admit I have made a hasty judgement on this matter and also want to clarify that my experience/opinion does not reflect or represent the management's stance as a whole. Hope this review would benefit future visitors for their best.

*** Original Review
Visited here on 3/31/17 with my boyfriend, and as vegas locals it was first time we visited fashion show location. It was rare to see high ratings at restaurantes located on the strip so our expextation was high. We were sitted after five minutes of waiting until the hostess showed up from somewhere but had to wait even longer until our waitress finally decided to take our drinks. The restaurant was half filled, and seeing that other customers food had already been served got us wonder why the service was super slow but we were okay because my boyfriend is in FB industry, and we have a lot of other friends that are as well. We are really generous about mistakes and have never been peculiar customers. We ordered the ones in the picture as appetizers, jambalaya, and two sushi rolls. After appetizers, we had to wait for 20 minutes with no one checking on our table. My boyfriend's water and my iced tea had been empty for a while, but they were not taken care of until jambalya was served. I was seating there expecting my rolls to be served soon. We waited so long by ourselves until the server decided to show up and asked us for any dessert. My boyfriend gently reminded her that we were still waiting for our sushi, and she just blatantly replied oh! Excuse me? No apology or anything. She did not even seem regretful or apologetic. She then went over to POS machine which I though she was checking on if our orders were made correctly, but turned out just spending time there minding her own business (she was not in the middle of helping any other customer)  . Like I said, we always do our best to avoid a commotion or anything so waited for our sushi rolls for another god knows how many minutes that finally had us realize our waitress did not have any intention to make up. We then waited her to ask for a check and canceling on our sushi orders but she never came back to our table. We ended up grabbing a different server and asked him for a check and a pen to write these which obviously got him wonder if we wanted to pay with a card. Oh well, that being said, we were not able to leave any tip because at this last moment, our waitress was only directing this other server to deliver our check and refusing to check on us. Considering our tip had never been under 20%, this incident was beyond shocking to us. I had a chance to talk to one of my friends the other day, and she carefully suggested that some servers choose not take care of Asian tables because they are not familiar with tipping, and I should have talked to the manager if that was the case. We have been really curious why the server chose to act like that and did not try to think about it much. But I could not help but leave this review for our first and will be the last visit because I swear to god I do not want to believe, but kind of start to wonder if that was really the case.

My family and I were celebrating our 10 year anniversary in Vegas and after all said and done we both wanted to eat at a place that wasn't a buffet. 
Kona grill came up in our search within the top 5 and with the ability to make reservations via yelp we decided on this place. 

We met a sweet and bubbly personality by the name of Amanda who was very attentive to our needs. She really made us feel welcomed and wasn't hesitant to answer all our questions or provide recommendations.

536487,2016-04-03,0,aNGcHb8rjFFI9nY_fUgImg,"This is the most family-friendly restaurant we've encountered in quite some time.  That alone deserves 4 stars.  Only people who have raised young children will be able to understand how commendable that is.  

When we were looking for places to eat near the Strip, we specifically pick based on how appropriate it would be for kids to be there(since we have two young ones), and whether or not the food offered would fit their picky palettes. On Yelp, Kona Grill is not listed as being ""Good for Kids."" However, we saw on their website that they have a kids menu, and the options seemed pretty tasty and diverse. So we ignored Yelp's designation and made a reservation. First, the tables are very spacious. In a rectangular table for a party of six, we had adequate space to seat three chairs plus a high chair on one side of the table. Had we needed, we would also have been able to utilize the space on the ends of the tables, as there were no other tables closely aligned next to it. Second, the sensitivity to kids that Kona Grill exhibits is a plus. They do not just plump a kids menu down onto the table. They bring drawing pads out for them to play. They also know to bring out the kids food first. Third, and this is the most impressively--they have a family restroom(separate from the usual men/women's rooms). With a changing station. That appears made of stainless steel. Only parents who have raised young children will understand what a game changer that is. For Kona Grill to put this kind of effort into welcoming children, when most of their customers are probably not children(at least not at the time that we frequented), speaks volumes about the type of chain they aim to be. My wife and I were blown away. Oh, and the food was great too. A diverse select was offered, from Chinese-type cuisine on the main menu to pizza(for the kids). They were all executed to great quality. The ambiance is very hip as well, and ought to be attractive to young adults and the like.

It is rare to encounter a restaurant with such a hip feel that puts so much effort into reeling in families as well.  Kona Grill executes this perfectly on both ends of the spectrum.  This is my new favorite chain.",OsweZyCYH_q8jcXN_YeoOQ,1,1,5,mwesYh-Mj7l8WkU4mCbUSA

While in Vegas we wanted sushi and so  we sought out help from Yelp. The reviews for this place were excellent. But I have the habit of reading the poor reviews so I can get an idea of why people don't like a particular place. Let me just say this, if you're coming to a sushi restaurant for a burger or a chicken sandwich and they don't serve you the best sandwich you've ever had who's fault is that? Yours! I don't go to a steak house and ask for sushi, why would you go to a sushi restaurant and get upset because your burger wasn't the best? 

As for the food here...excellent!! We started with the Angry Edamame. Edamame tossed with a citrus and chili sauce. I enjoy citrus so I liked it. The first roll was the Spicy Tuna roll. A good roll with good flavor and quality tuna. The second roll was the Picasso. An excellent roll topped with a slice of jalapeño with a citrus flair, again, I like citrus so this was a favorite of mine. It also came with a Japanese relish that was great! The third roll was the Spider roll, soft shell crab and a nice glaze over the top. Our group favorite was the Voodoo roll. So much flavor and a little kick at the end.  All of it was so good. 

Some of the complaints were that the rolls weren't very tight. This may be true but the pieces were small enough that you were able to enjoy each one without wrestling with the roll.

We walked in and were instantly concerned, as the place was empty (it was a little early for Vegas dinner) and the greeter was extremely uninviting. She never welcomed us, made any eye contact, and just dumped our menus off at the table and walked away.  We sat down, talked about it, and almost left.

Thankfully, the server made up for it entirely. He was very welcoming, very engaging, and even had   conversation with our young kids. He made great suggestions on drinks and food. 

The food was excellent. The calamari appetizer was very good, the Seabass was amazing, and the sushi was very creative and unique.  Between our server, and the quality of food, this is one of the best places to eat in Vegas, and we have been just about everywhere.

For reference, Rome was our hostess. One thing I noticed about her and the other hostess working the area of the restaurant we were in was the very personal service. Genuine smiles the whole time they took your order and if one of them was busy, the other would check on other tables. Wish I knew the other lady's name. A+ for service.

The food was excellent too. I definitely recommend the avocado egg rolls on the appetizer menu. They were served with a honey cilantro sauce that I haven't been able to stop talking about all week. Plus, it's so unique: never seen anything like that on a menu before. We also ordered tuna sliders, Cuban sandwich, and the passion fruit creme brulee. They were all good.

She said all asked and came back with coffee. We got to restaurant  at 9:15. We had a yelp coupon for free app or roll. After looking and seeing only generic rolls we told server can you tell the sushi chef just to make us something his choice. Upon delivery the expo says Caterpillar roll.  Sure enough when we got our bill the server just hit caterpillar roll. Irritating! We asked for a small white rice when the appetizers were dropped off.  before Our food got there mind u!! and she said no The kitchens close. Mmmmm ok. After eating we asked what there dessert menu was. It was our kids 8th birthday !!  kitchen is close she said! we where not told the kitchen is closing or we would have ordered desert with meal cause it's not like they gave her ice cream or anything. yelp said they close at 11 currently they close at 10.  We still got there 45 minutes before but I guess it was still to much of An inconvenience to server us.

That is unfortunately the best way to describe my experience at this location of Kona Grill today. Huge shout out of excellence to the kitchen and the bar for delivering freshness and quality you can taste! 

This resteraunt however had a HUGE issue, organization and staffing. They were understaffed and frantic to pick up the slack. My dining experience was hurry up and wait.. and wait... and wait... and wait. While waiting I saw many people leave their tables or hunt down someone to give them their check to leave. 

I watched while servers crashed into each other rushing to get to tables. I saw customers seated and not spoken to for up to 6 minutes. And there was never once   an attempt made to calm these servers as to not upset their guests.

Unfortunately I was one of the guests to had to hunt down a random employee to get my check. Upon leaving I asked to speak with the GM Luise, to let him know about my experience. When you watch frantic chaos around you while you're eating, it doesn't make you want to stay, it makes you want to leave as fast as possible. Could I have sat longer and spent more money? Sure! But not in chaos. 

According to Luise, there were several call outs that day which is what led to the chaos. I don't know what the right answer is to handle that situation but I have to think calming the staff is the first step.

2399275,2017-07-29,0,aNGcHb8rjFFI9nY_fUgImg,"Occasional guests to Vegas. Me and my husband ate here yesterday for happy hour for the first time! -(keep in mind it's Weekdays ONLY for HH ). I even called ahead of time to make sure what the HH times were, and she verified for me weekdays 3pm-6pm. I feel this information is relevant if you're looking for a great place to save some bucks, and I read all the reviews here looking everywhere about happy hour times and prices which lead me to calling them, so there you are!! 

I LOVED everything about this place. We had great service, and sushi was really good. Between me and my husband, We ordered a total of 5 different orders of FULL sushi rolls, 2 beers, and 1 alcoholic beverage that the waitress recommended to me, for a total of $56. All of our food we ordered was from the happy hour menu, and we got our drinks at regular price on the regular menu (they do have HH drinks, we just wanted something different to try). Now, personally.. I think $$$ that's a good deal. I mean, it's not necessarily bonkers crazy cheap... but during happy hour they have a good list to choose from for full sushi rolls for only $4.50! And have some of the fancier rolls for HH at $10. (They have other foods on the HH menu, not just all sushi rolls, regular entrees also, and normal appetizers). Good size rolls, tastes fresh, the style of the restaurant itself is nice cooler tone Colors and modern, very clean, they have their own bathroom there which I like! Most Vegas restaurants off the strip have no restrooms, and you have to go out and find one. We also didn't wait long for our food at all, again it was like right at 3pm on a Thursday when HH just started.. so business I think was just picking up for them at the time. I think it makes a great place for all ages, I saw a family with smaller kids in there... adults up at the bar, group of girls having a get together it seemed, very good variety of different ages and groups of ppl! Anyone and everyone's welcomed there.. and their patio looks nice and refreshing, they have little misters I noticed out there to make it more refreshing, and very shady. I think this place is great for any occasion, you can literally dress as nice as you want and or be on a date.. or just be casual and go to a cool spot. 

I recommend this place based on the Happy Hour options alone. If that's how good that was, cant imagine how great their regular stuff is off the menu! 

Also a huge plus to me that it's apart of the fashion show mall and half outside of it! You can enjoy all the shops around there with no super inconvenience of major walking or difficult parking down in the garage. (Parking was free too btw). 

Hope this helps for great comfort and great budgeting as it did for us! We will be back for certain!",Qzpag7xOrgWgb2m_2atq8Q,1,1,5,CQGgUyyJtQt3zUTo23Mfmw
2413035,2016-08-08,0,aNGcHb8rjFFI9nY_fUgImg,"I wanted a light lunch and opted for a salad. It was kind of a random order since this place is more well-known for its sushi. I had the Oriental Salad ($12) which had cabbage, green onions, cilantro, carrots and red peppers. The sweet-soy dressing was really good but it was a little bit oily for me. I added salmon for an extra $6. This was one of the best salmons I've had. It was perfectly soft, tender, crispy and was glazed with a buttery sauce. I split the salad with a friend and it was the perfect amount.

For starters, I got the avocado egg rolls which came with a honey-cilantro dipping sauce. I don't think the sweet sauce paired well with the rolls though. But the rolls themselves were delicious. They were $12 but I got them for free. I was trying to find this restaurant in the mall and went up to the Guest Services table for direction. They randomly gave me a coupon for a free appetizer. Score!

This place is right on the edge of the Fashion Show Mall. Very fancy interior and great service. I would come here again to try their sushi next!",debGk_nyF71K2KOfZt5TDA,1,1,4,Bl7m0zQxuo6WSPtqNBOB6w

My favorite app here is the potstickers. The filling is incredibly flavorful and the wrapper dough is spot on - not too thick with the perfect pan sear. Delish.

I was able to sample their highly recommended macadamia nut chicken and sweet chili glazed salmon, both of which were good but wasn't tasty enough to have me return on my own time. At the event, I was lucky enough to score a gift card which led me to return today. 

They are currently offering a free appetizer or sushi roll with the purchase of an entree with yelp check-in (up to $14). I wasn't going to let this generous offer slip out of my hands so I ordered the sunshine roll (spicy salmon, salmon, and shaved lemon) and the jambalaya (crawfish, chicken, crushed red pepper, cilantro, hoisin, sesame, white rice). Both entrees were spectacular! The jambalaya was the best I've ever tried. They were extremely generous with the crawfish and only priced at $20.

The sunshine roll has easily become one of my favorite rolls of all time. The salmon and sliced lemon combination leaves you feeling refreshed. The spicy tuna inside adds a little kick to the roll. This roll is simple, so don't go overboard and drench it in soy sauce. Learn to appreciate the simplicity of sushi rolls if you can.

I was so happy with my meal that I bought the holiday deal that they have going on at the moment. $50 gift card purchase will get you a $10 bonus. Their entrees range from $20-$30 so any bonus will be put to good use. I can't wait to return again and check out their happy hour selections (Mon-Fri 3-6pm)!",g_4zySOI_HisK5rG_2dw6Q,5,3,5,8mzNFblGQ9G3Z82KIiC_GQ

I sat at the bar so I had a pretty good view of the restaurant it was huge inside with nice decor similar to other Kona Grills I've seen. I was greeted by the bartender who was super cool, funny, and very helpful. 

So what happened was I was making fun of how none of the things on the menu went together like sushi and the chicken chili. Then the bartender shut me up when he said it's one of the best things on the menu and he eats it almost every day so naturally I had to try it to see if he was telling the truth.

I ended up ordering the chicken chili and it turns out he was not lying about that chili y'all, it was bomb! I liked that the chili was still like regular beef chili you know tomato-based & with kidney beans because sometimes with chicken chili they just use the Canelli beans and the broth is light colored. Anyway it had so much flavor and came with green onions and white cheddar on top I also got a side of sour cream because I love sour cream and the best part is it comes with three mini corn bread muffins all for $6! It's like one of the cheapest things on the menu which is crazy because it's so hearty and filling. Unbeknownst to how much the chili would feel me up I also ordered the chicken potstickers which are delicious I've had them before but they were $11 and had nothing on the value & flavor of the chili in my opinion even though they were very good too.

The addition of salmon for $6 is totally worth it as the portion appeared to be more than 4oz. My draft beer was $6.50, which is a bit steep but I guess finding drinks inside the mall may be a challenge so an up charge may be warranted here. Our waiter was pretty quick and friendly.

We were just college students and don't really have a lot of money but you guys make it seem like only the upper class people should eat at your restaurant which I think is wrong.

This restaurant is located inside fashion mall and has four out of five stars on yelp. Did I come on a bad day or order the wrong thing? You tell me. I came with a party of 6 on a Friday late afternoon and ordered a buffet of different foods ranging from the BBQ chicken flat bread, sushi, pasta, chicken rice plate, and calamari. The best thing was the calamari. BBQ chicken flat bread literally tasted like bread with BBQ sauce on it. Sushi was mediocre but the rice was sort of hard. Both the salmon pasts and the chicken lemon Pasta was delicious. And the chicken  veggie rice plate just terrible. It tasted like Panda Express. 

Drinks of course were good because we stuck to something we knew. The sake sangria was a different delicious twist. 

When the bill came I had to double check it because I had used my yelp check in for a free appetizer. We also sent the chicken plate back and they said they'd take it off the bill but they didn't. I told the server and she said because we touched it she couldn't take it off. This was not what she said earlier. I asked to speak with the manager at this point.

My fiance & I came in about an hour before closing after walking around Fashion Show for a while. The interior is beautiful and dreamy, with stainless steel tables, dark colors, blue ambient lighting, and a large aquarium that is thankfully not overcrowded with fish so it didn't look tacky. We were greeted, seated, then met by Christa within 5 minutes. She was the right amount of friendly & efficient. She made great recommendations. We were only looking for something light and a drink or two, so I got the tuna tower (wonton crisps on the side) along with a cocktail (forgot the name, unfortunately) & he went with a basic california roll and some Stella. 

Our drinks came out quickly and were beautifully presented with waters on the side. Our food took some time but also came out right when we started getting ravenous. I had expected my tuna tower to resemble a messy pile on the plate which I could dig into, but it was much more tower-like than that. It was an underwhelming small dense cylinder of sushi rice, mixed crab meat, avocados, and raw tuna topped with micro greens and roe. It really did look small, but I found that when I took it apart it was well-worth the $16 cost. Because it was so incredibly dense, it filled me up and the wonton crisps were a spot-on recommendation by Christa. I crave it again as I write this. Even the california roll was good. Would definitely get both if I return. We got two more Stellas.

Thanks goodness for Yelp! I can always trust Yelp.

For starters, the servers were professional, helpful and gave us excellent suggestions for their best dishes. The food was fresh and delicious and perfect. Once we finished eating everything that we ordered, we ordered some more. I will not say that it was inexpensive, but compared to the prices of meals reported by friends and family members who had visited Las Vegas, I would call it a bargain, especially considering the food quality and service.

And speaking of service, our server spent a great deal of time suggesting our itinerary for the next few days. I guess I had not done enough homework prior to arriving. We told her that we did not want to gamble. There was plenty to do in Las Vegas! Our server was absolutely wonderful, the best tour guide anyone could ask for! All of her advice was perfect!

Jason McAtee (yup got his full name as far as I know, he was that cool) was probably one of the best servers I've had in a long time in LA or Vegas. He suggested the Tuna Tataki roll which was much better than I expected for some random restaurant I walked in to grab a drink along my trip down the strip. It's likely their best roll, hands down! Thanks, Jason! He's personable, and honest and valid recommendations. 

We were so into the Tuna Tataki that we had the Yamada Roll...which was just okay--not sure if I'd get it again, but if you like ""sweet and sour"" type things it is fine. Also *disclaimer* softened the blow to get it gratis from the Yelp check-in deal. Happy hour sake bomb is totally worth it BTW. 

So not anywhere near Hawaiian food or the best sushi spot I've been to but I was genuinely and pleasantly suprised by 1) Jason and 2) the Tuna Tataki. Want a no-frills Vegas dinner with screens to boot? This is your spot. 

Also got the Kona Calamari. Too much for 2 in my opinion but I like it with the special Japanese sauce.",pqlax1pqGMPxt9cAjZ7Q9Q,2,2,5,1ZOI4uQeiSLNQ57OTcIy9Q

I ordered a drink, a mule, and it was very good. For a starter, I ordered the potstickers. I was disappointed in them. The sauce they came with was very bland; I actually used soy sauce instead. The dough seemed more like a pastry dough, so that was weird. The filling was pretty dry and crumbly, so once I took a bite of a potsticker the filling just spilled out. For my entree, I order the flank steak which came with mashed potatoes and glazed carrots. I really like the chimichurri sauce that the steak was served with, the carrots were delicious, and my steak was cooked perfectly. Also, the portion size was great. I would have like my starter and entree to be served apart from one another. Right after my starter was brought to the table, my entree arrived. I saw that they had butter cake on the dessert menu, but the waitress recommended the carrot cake saying it was to die for. I love carrot cake, so I decided to give it a whirl. First off, the piece they give you is huge. I could not finish it, and brought it home. The cake is good, but I wasn't the biggest fan of the frosting. 
Overall, I would go here again. I would not order the potstickers ever again, and I would like to try the butter cake. 
I really liked how quick our food came out, our servers were friendly and able to make recommendations, and the location is convenient.",xb6wXsO1tnH6fX-eVO3_Vg,2,1,4,yjxm7yUwQi4Ux239niddzw

We were ignored for over 10 minutes..  no one came up and even asked us if we wanted water (in the Vegas summer weather) and there was at least one server around helping other tables.  We just walked out and mentioned why were walking out to two staff members.  Neither of them tried to do anything to keep our business.

They looked like they liked the food since they both ate almost everything and that doesn't happen very often. Me, I also got a sandwich, but the pan seared tuna sliders. My God they were good and I rarely eat sushi grade tuna. Burgers were not small sliders, in between a slider and a standard burger. Just enough to fill you up but not still be hungry when you leave.

I have never been more disappointed. I have eaten japanese more than any other and this was a westernised attempt. 
When you look around the restaurant and see majority of diners eating burgers and fries, I think that is a dead giveaway that if you want to eat Japanese do some good yelping and find a different restaurant to this one.
It also is hard to leave gratuities in America when you receeive next to no service. That made me sick after it was all said and done.

We arrived around 5:45pm on a Sunday night and the restaurant was quite empty. The restaurant is large and beautiful, with tasteful lighting and decorations and very spacious dining areas. There is also an outdoor patio and a sushi bar seating area.

Service was great. We were seated promptly and our waiter was very attentive throughout the entire meal. We were excited about the happy hour specials, as the listed sushi rolls and appetizers were about 40% off (traditional rolls were $4.50 and special rolls were $10 with happy hour prices), but unfortunately we found out that the happy hour was not available on weekends (apparently it is between 3-6pm on weekdays only). Without the happy hour, I thought the prices were quite high for the sushi ($8-9 for a traditional roll and ~$15 for a special roll). They also have an entree menu with entrees listed for around $15 to $25. 

I tried the following:
Beef brisket burger (seasonal special, $15) with bacon, onion, lettuce, tomato, and fries: quite good, but not particularly special compared to other burgers that I've tried. The brisket flavor was not very prominent, although the burger was cooked well and the fries were crispy and well-fried. 
Alaskan roll (baked salmon, spicy aioli, cucumber, tempura flakes, eel sauce, $8): a pretty average roll. I probably should have calibrated my expectations since Las Vegas is landlocked and the fish has to be flown in, so it isn't as fresh as the sushi I'm used to in Boston.

Facility:  This is a nice spot. It's super modern and trendy. There is some beautiful decor. They have tables and chairs, bar seating, outside seating, and booths. Love the wine tunnel and the blue lights. You could dress up nice on date night or come casual in blue jeans. 

Service: 5 star service!!  My waitress was Kiyanna, and she was awesome!  She was friendly, knowledgable, honest and just plain nice. She was very attentive asking back at just the right times during our meal. I will be asking for her specifically the next time I come in. 

Food: We took advantage of the happy hour choices, and didn't regret it.  For a very reasonable price, you get actual plates of food...not the little 2 bite tapas at most places. We ordered the following...
Avocado eggrolls - these were pretty tasty, but the cilantro sauce for dipping was too sweet for me. 
Chicken Satay 2.5/5 - chicken was good, but not a fan of the sweet hoisin sauce.  The peanut sauce was just ok. But I'm. It a good judge because I don't care for peanut sauce. 
Bulgogi Tacos 3/5 - loved the crispy chewy taco shell. Unfortunately, they put the sweet hoisin sauce on the tacos, so I couldn't finish them. Just way too sweet. However, my friend liked them so much, she ordered some Togo. 
Cheeseburger sliders 4/5 - these were good, and pretty big for sliders. The fries were hot and good!

Overall: I like this place. Although the sweet side of the menu is not my fav, the savory dishes make up for it. And the service from people like Kiyanna take it over the top!!!!!",-50XWnmQGqBgEI-9ANvLlg,3,2,4,Z890OVMzPenF5IlmEpF6Ng

Kona Grill has always been a treasured happy hour spot for my best friend and I. Before they remodeled and had an upstairs at their original location in Boca Park!

With the holidays around the corner I know I'll have a couple more pit spots at this location now.

My brother had never been here so he was very helpful and detailed about what were the house favorites. We got a couple rolls from their sushi bar. One was the piranha and the other was the shrimp and lobster roll. I could be wrong the piranha roll. We were so hungry I didn't even snap a couple photos like usual. The food was so great that well I couldn't resist. With a yelp check in we got a free appetizer and we got the chicken and shrimp lettuce wraps!!! My personal favorite and my brother also enjoyed it very much! Hands down the best lettuce wraps around. We got an order of Pad Thai that the house split in two for us before we even asked.

Told the server and he fixed it right away. Waited a while and the caterpillar roll never came out, was like fine not a big deal. Here's where I started to get a bit sour I ordered the kona fillet med-rare and it came out med-well. I told the server and he apologized right away.  When the check came out our server said ""I took care of the tuna for you"". I wasn't expecting that at all, I was pleased. We get our check and what he meant was that he took care of the tuna nigiri that came to our table by accident. I figured that would be automatic given I didn't order that dish.

5291378,2017-09-26,0,aNGcHb8rjFFI9nY_fUgImg,"A refreshing fusion spot to stop by while shopping at Fashion Show Mall.

Environment: Located on the exterior side facing the strip of the Fashion Show Mall, the restaurant has a nice mix of outdoor and indoor seating, offering a nice view of the strip if the weather permits it, while the interior decorating is just as aesthetically pleasing, with fish tanks, TVs, and glass fixtures. Additionally, inside seating is extensive, with a liquor bar, sushi bar, high tables, booths, and private rooms.

Food: The menu itself somewhat reminded me of similar chains such as Yard House and Tommy Bahama's with the different aspects of Italian, seafood, grill, sushi, as well as a couple other genres which allows for everyone to get a little bit of what they want. We got a spicy yellowtail roll as an appetizer because we wanted a little something light before our main entrees of the avocado chicken club sandwich and the shrimp pasta. The roll was nicely prepared and the slices of yellowtail were generous. The sandwich as surprisingly good as well, not dry at all and very flavorful. The pasta was delicious as well, with a lot of flavor seasoning, and garnishes. The shrimp was succulent, the garlic bread was cooked perfectly as well, and the dish was very filling.

Service: Service was good as well, with our server offering numerous suggestions and checking up on us through various points of our meal, even offering to box up our leftovers for us which was nice. 

Overall, with Maggiano's and Ra Sushi right next door I believe Kona Grill holds its own and I could definitely see myself coming back here the next time I stop by the mall for some shopping.",5fxjUT0sLg9ueMAYtn2PZw,0,0,4,F7tf13ItQ00__D-d5v5SYQ

The ambiance was created for everyone's tastes; no disappointments here.  Lots of light streaming in, a modern look with soft colors, great choices in seating arrangements, very comfortable & cushy bar stools, T.V. screens high up & not in-your-face, a beautiful restroom, the bar open to the outside which houses a terrific & large patio (incl. sofas, stand-up & regular tables), with street noise at a minimum, and... how could I forget... employees who obviously love what they're doing & who do it attentively.  Even the managers yesterday introduced themselves to ask what we thought of the new store (which opened last Saturday).

We had a sushi roll that even my ""No sushi"" partner loved.  Then the chicken lettuce wraps that came with 7 pieces of luscious butter lettuce & they were sooo good!  My partner, rather an expert on hamburger sliders, said these were the best because the two were large enough for his lumberjack appetite,  the cheese was generous & the ""right"" bun topped off the taste.  These sliders also come with a large portion of fries.

The prices have been only slightly raised on food & drink, & don't forget the terrific cocktails on happy hour; also, $2 off all wines.

Yes, and yes again.... we'll be returning, espec. in light of the Summerlin store closing soon for 3 months for a complete remodel (incl. an upstairs with patio) which promises to resemble this lovely Strip property.",kFFhw53ZEPoDo6okPU4eRg,1,3,4,GBEkluTFkJQnweb7K0219w

Our original plan was to go to the burger place, but then I spotted Kona Grill's sign and we went to see the menu which had some good entree names so we decided to eat there.

I ordered a Kona Chopped salad and my wife got a Macadamia Nut Chicken. We also had a soup - tomato basil bisque.

To our surprise the food significantly exceeded our expectations. We thought we would just grab some food quickly before our other scheduled activities that night, but I think it's fair to say that both of us actually enjoyed the food.

All dishes were very balanced with ranges of ingredients from fresh vegetables to flavorful chicken meat. It was quite filling. I ordered a salad and thought I was going to still be hungry after eating, but it turned out that the portion was big enough to get full.

The staff was very friendly and helpful. When we arrived we were greeted and thanked for coming by somebody who might be a manager there.

We sat outside which is a nice experience tool since its in the middle of strip.

The food was very good, I had the Macadamia Nut Chicken... WOW! 
Will definitely be coming back & highly recommend to friends here in Vegas & those from out of town.",i7URI18ODMi6YgS76db-8w,0,0,5,EADRVCEpizbLIeCWnUKzuQ

A friend and I shared: Pork potstickers, Voodoo sushi roll, Spider roll, and Checker Board roll. This was definitely too much food for two people, I would suggest ordering only 3 dishes. My favorite items were definitely the Potstickers and the Spider Roll. If you can see the picture, the potstickers were sooo round and cute--they definitely weren't skimpy with the fillings and it was soo meaty and delicious! In terms of the rolls, they were all pretty good, but I thought the Voodoo Roll was the most unique because I've never had anything similar in the past. Something about the roll made it super 'Mexican'...perhaps it was the habanero? You'll have to try it and let me know. 

The service here was amazing--our server was such a sweetheart and even though she had to work on NYE there were no signs of annoyance (unlike everyone else we encountered that same day). I didn't catch her name but she was super attentive and took really good care of us. Overall I had a great experience at this restaurant!",A06QtUzeJSiDW6MSWp3Jdg,9,10,5,OUsK-Z2S7ibwpMAuEKzNCw

The salad was also huge. Underestimated how much it brought. And they were NOT shy with the chicken it was definitely an entire chicken breast.,DftDwK95WYzrT1qYJ-OL8w,0,0,5,MraIrArWnmxLkJk3NtIChw

The food is great and being a mall employee the discount is great. The staff is all friendly and helpful.

5953612,2018-04-20,0,aNGcHb8rjFFI9nY_fUgImg,I came to the Kona Grill in Vegas.. the food is the same as it is in Dallas.. so nothing special. We sat at the bar.. ordered.. had food.  When it came time for the bill.. the bill had the tip section highlight with a yellow marker.. I'm like what the freak.  Is it because we were 4 African Americans paying.. if not.. i still take offense to  the fact that i always tip.. over the suggested amount.. which i still did in this case.,nNXakPAGJVEbvKG9JgFKtw,1,0,1,lSDNOGHEFZweo8yulhxMtw
5976973,2017-10-30,0,aNGcHb8rjFFI9nY_fUgImg,"Bad experience first time and it's the last one!!

The food is ok , but they are thieves !!

When the check come I ask clear the server (Manuel) to charge my card $83.74

I left tip everything was ok and if I could I would take the tip back!!!

I found out the day after when I was checking my account something weird , and see that kona grill charge me $257.48

When I call them they check it and say it was a mistake !!

How come a mistake of $170 more?

If someone go there make sure to check your account after because no one will let you know that it was a ""mistake"" in your amount ,and they will keep the money .",69QyP9rG2SInJta3-I7siQ,1,0,1,TdexAlhdNpwMM10BN4WH7A

Our server was very attentive and friendly.  We started with the Vegal roll, which was tasty. I had the shrimp lime salad. It was large, full of nice greens and veges. There was a lot of shrimp, which, unfortunately,  was overcooked. Other than that, it was a nice dining experience.",_2rRSDaeAmn3v4YOaS1PLg,0,0,4,V7EJe6ckvIL7F41Y9NXJsg
