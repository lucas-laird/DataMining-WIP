This location is right around the corner from my home but I won't be going back to this one again I'll drive the extra mile and a half 3 miles whatever it is to go to a subway that actually has meatballs. And the people working there don't even seem to care you walk in and ask for meatball sub and they tell you nope don't got it I mean come on. If you're open and you have something on the menu you should have it in stock I can see if this was once where they were just like oh my God we didn't prepare and we don't have enough but this is the second time. Just plain laziness don't wanna make any more don't want to have to clean it up at the end of the night.",fCY7SN6UJzpF5vg7IZxhPA,0,0,1,1d48q6EzFTnfrAo2aYRoeg

Not only that, but she had the nerve to keep the back door open and she stood INSIDE the back of the place letting the smoke not only go outside, but go inside. She smoked her cig, checking her phone, and went inside without even waiting to let the smoke off her.  I saw this all while waiting at the Starbucks drive thru. That's just disgusting and I would not want that around my food.",bGBp3ptS25gzxmFhVfB7WA,0,0,1,bKUCuuYK0p-MrheTBD8U6w

All we have is $15 dollars in gift cards from our parents to spend and a couple extra dollars just in case we go over 
We tell the lady ( older gray/brown hair) we want 3 of the 5.49 deals so she asks us what kind of bread and what kind of meat , we continue to make our sandwiches and we get to the end and I ask for our drinks ( which comes with the meal) she then tells me , oh you want to add a drink 
I said no it comes with one and she continues to tell me that the meat we chose is not apart of the 5.49 meals and now is being charged as a separate sandwich ?
Seriously ? I am a General manager and if my employees pulled some shit like this to make extra money I would be pissed , I knowing try to run my card for the extra money and I know there's not enough to cover the ridiculous scam this employee just pulled so it declines in-front if everyone! Talk about embarrassing I had to sit there and pull money from my savings to pay for this food  , which wouldn't be a huge deal if that's what I decided I wanted to do but we chose this deal for a reason and a very un friendly employee saw an opportunity to pull some stupid shit , this is why subway is going out of business !",1F9bvdySbGXcHQqjw4DZxQ,0,0,1,lLeYu5-YFurKc3CLFrEyFA
