I ordered the individual 1/2 service and they're was enough food for 2 people. Needless to say I'll be having Chinese food tomorrow. There was a lot of food in the main course, egg roll, and fried wonton, and wonton soup that had 5 wontons. It was all delicious. This will be my go to Chinese restaurant from now on. Best of all it's only 3 minutes from my house. Forget Panda Express. My new passion is China Passion. The only caveat was there was a table that needed to be cleaned. When the plates are cleared, the table should be cleaned. This is what kept me from giving the testament a 5 star rating",xUfZnjMAujLV5rvm1NAzqA,0,0,4,RNrdkxGR3WHbzW1rTlSEvg

We ordered Orange Chicken, General Tso's Chicken, Hong Kong Noodles, Beef Chow Fun, Sautéed Veggies, and veggie Egg Rolls.

2117502,2018-03-31,0,xP2zIIqXxW8QNiJqJyE92A,"Tried this place out because of the 4.5 review. Ordered take out: crab rangoons; ""butterfly"" shrimp; BBQ pork Chow Fun; Hunan Beef; Sweet & Sour pork. 
Crab rangoons tasted fishy 
""Butterfly"" shrimp were sticks not butterflies & they were greasy, more fried batter than shrimp
Chow fun was dry and flavorless
The Hunan beef was fatty but very crispy
The sweet & sour pork sauce smelled and tasted terrible, something was definitely off. The pork was very crispy but the sauce was inedible. 
Also ordered a side of steamed rice, it was old and tough. 
The chili sauce also tasted off. 
I instantly got a weird smell when I walked into the place and the entire order was disappointing. We all felt sick immediately and now our stomachs are paying the price. Everyone who ate it is feeling ill and we are all fighting for the toilet. Maybe if Yelpers left 5 star ratings on places because of the quality rather than dirt cheap prices this disgusting food wouldn't have received such a high rating. So disappointed in the place, and in Yelp for being full of people who only care about deals and quantity,  not quality. What a shame.",hMRm1OFJy_-bwCVMobbmxw,0,0,1,QaZo8eQ4UsJqKoDTXFJ_lA

We ordered our food, we tried the egg corn soup, it was served cold. We returned it, they heated it up, then it gained an aftertaste. Before all this, I ordered a boba drink. 45 minutes later, it didn't come. I decided to cancel the order. The rest of the food was served sloppy, and the restaurant workers didn't care. There was no compensation, there was no apology. The worker told us to ""come later"" next time so that we would get ""better service."" I mean what the fuck does that mean?

Well I took a friend after raving about how good it was and I was so disappointed. Soup flavorless, egg rolls mushy, just bad.

5056399,2018-02-09,0,xP2zIIqXxW8QNiJqJyE92A,2-7-18~After reading reviews we decided to give this place a try. What a great little restaurant and some of the best Chinease food I've had. When your seated they give you chips and a hot honey sauce for dipping. Yum!I got the Mongolian beef and BBQ pork as an appetizer. The BBQ pork was incredible! The best I've had. The Mongolian beef was so good. The give you huge plates of food. Plenty of left overs. Dinner comes with egg roll and white rice. For small fee you can have fried rice. Very clean restaurant. Friendly staff. Prompt service. Waitress came back to check on us several times. Love this place! I will definitely be back.,ACMYTmlycF2-HgSZ8lyC0A,0,0,5,WRMiHtN7pG7WOMkF8YM8Gw
5158929,2018-04-24,0,xP2zIIqXxW8QNiJqJyE92A,"I ordered at 7:00PM and the food arrived before 7:30PM. The driver was very courteous and cheerful. The food was hot, delicious, and exactly what we ordered.

The pricing is reasonable per main dish, but you should pay attention to what options are available to minimize overall cost, especially if you like fried rice or chow mien and don't care to have a lot of steamed rice left over. (I use the left over steamed rice to make my own fried rice, but that is another story.)

All told, we will use them again the next time we want Chinese and we either don't have the materials on hand or are feeling too lazy to make it ourselves.",nVlr8wPShCBOjOE9-SmUOQ,0,0,5,qUt-ubNqxY1IZx6LdjUh9A

Plates so large we took some for lunch tomorrow at home. While there I was thinking. Before Vegas we lived in So California for 19 years never finding that one Chinese restaurant that was like home because in California everything is Hong Kong style.
We are originally from Brooklyn and Long Island N Y where we had Cantonese among other styles. ""China Passion"" is the place we looked for over 19 years in Calif.
Thank God we found you. I hear there is another location on Sahara on East side of strip so we have an adventure to look forward to.",XzD4mlhAIlo4GeNxrD2-vw,3,1,5,J6AqqtrRMsbIS2eeDVFymQ

I ordered Kung Pao Beef and Chicken Chop Suey and both were really delicious !! The veggies in each dish were prepared perfectly with still a bit of crunch to them; the noodles are done just enough with the right amount of sauce and the fried rice was fluffy and had no grease whatsoever. Everything was so well prepared you'd almost think you were eating at a health food restaurant but with all of those great Chinese flavors. And yes the portions are big but I like that for leftovers the next day.So with a concerned owner and great food it's a place to try and I will recommend it to family, friends and neighbors !!",m2gIW3qe18scLqPw2JP2BQ,1,2,5,Wpq0zuMoELC59tbRH1eJWA
5789382,2017-10-29,0,xP2zIIqXxW8QNiJqJyE92A,This is the best Chinese food in northern vegas. Great lunch specials and the chicken egg rolls are amazing.  The fried rice and chow mein was delicious. My only complaint is that they only do half fried rice and chow mein with lunch specials only.  They will not do it for dinner. They make you by both full sizes which is way too much for one person. Other than that great food. The garlic chicken is a fan favorite.,BbVoZMe88w9NqQ79Ck_XQg,0,0,4,14q9PxeMz0KrYCPXM6Wmww
