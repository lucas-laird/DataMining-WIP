I came here before going to see O and I was damn hungry. We were actually looking for another place but ended up here by mistake. We saw that they sold real food in addition to their tasty looking gelato. 

Between the boyfriend and I we got the chicken pita (tasted good), chicken caesar salad (stupid), egg bacon muffin thing (I didn't taste it but the boy said it was fine), and a yogurt parfait (it was definitely European style, which I like but some people my find it too tart. I'll rate it as ""meh."") 

Those 4 things cost $40. Are you f-ing me?! I know it's Vegas, blah blah blah, but geez. For a ""quick eats"" place where the stuff was pre-made... Pul-lease. Pre-made! Even McDonald's makes my food to order. Is it because I'm at the Bellagio? Yawn. 

Side note: they have water cups and the cutest glass jam jars ever. I plan to take 10 of them the next time I go.

I definitely want to try their gelato, but I won't be going back for their food.",n2xGqfJOdUXuzGqY1tCUGQ,0,0,2,LOkiINi07_Sxp7yyS0uC-g

Gelato Cafe is located inside of the Bellagio Hotel right next to the pool area! Perfect spot for when summer comes around. 

It's set up like a quick service restaurant where you queue up, order your gelato and then pay. There's usually very little to no wait at all. They also have a variety of flavors ranging from fruity to savory. I also noticed that they had less sugary options as well. I don't really have a go-to flavor here. It's usually just what I'm feeling for that day. Today I ordered a small snickers flavored gelato and it was pretty tasty. I would have liked more chocolate pieces though. Be aware that their small is actually pretty big! 

Service here is whatever. The employees are just trying to do their job at bare minimum.

Kinda tucked away down one of those long hallways in the Bellagio, you'll find the gates to heaven - aka Cafe Gelato.

They've got a great selection of pre-made sandwiches, ridiculously good desserts, pastries that are making my mouth water just THINKING about them, and of course - a shit ton of gelato.

What you wouldn't think to look for here is their SMOOTHIE selection. Not sugary milkshakes or Jamba crap. We are talking all fruit/veggie smoothies. This is the one place in Vegas I can go and actually get some spinach! 

When I stayed at Caesars a couple weeks ago, I walked to the Bellagio just to get my fav green smoothie, the Fruit and Veggie Smoothie.

Seriously, come here. The prices are okay, and you're actually getting what I think is real food. 

All of the pre-made sandwiches I've checked out seem to have cheese on them - that is literally my only complaint.

The first time I came here was as a kid (I'm guessing some time in 2000 or so...I don't remember) because there's an arcade next door.  I had dulce de leche with a waffle cone, and I pretty much fell in love with this place.  And since that day, I vowed to myself that every time I came to Vegas for more than 24 hours, I'd come here to get some delicious gelato.  Spring, summer, fall, winter, didn't matter.  And yes, the tradition continues to this day!

As for the gelato itself, it's just great value.  $6.49 for a scoop (which is in reality TWO scoops) and a waffle cone.  In a town where you rarely find good value for money, you get GREAT value for money here.  Personal favorites are dulce de leche (obviously), blueberry cheesecake, Oreo, and stracciatella.

If you're looking for this spot, it's right next to the pool.  Just go down the hallway that's next to the buffet and you'll find it.",aXuxyyTDs5RGoFrhajPLYg,3,1,5,eW0rWJs69gJwj8LxkGaSlg

I had seen this place before while heading towards the art gallery but never stopped to check it out. Finally on Christmas Day, while trying to escape the crowds on the casino floor I remembered this place existed and decided it was finally time to check it out. Although there was a line, it definitely was much quieter and emptier than in the casino! 

Besides carrying a couple dozen flavors of gelato, they also have coffee, soft drinks, sandwiches, quiches, pastries, and other baked goodies. Because we had already eaten lunch, I decided to just get 2 scoops of gelato: mango and blackberry cheesecake, which ran about 5 bucks. The gelato was good and full of flavor, especially the mango one. It tasted like a real mango! They have a self service ice water and condiment station that is stocked with small jars of jams and honey.

Cafe Gelato is a nice, quiet way to escape the hustle and noise of the casino floor. I look forward to coming back next time I'm at Bellagio. I just wished they had separate lines for food ordering and gelato only because the line gets jammed up when the person in front of you is standing there trying to order sandwiches and I'm stuck behind them hoping they would finish.

The Café also offers panini's and free Swiss jams and honey on the side (make great souvenirs!), in addition to in-café seating and hallway seating (a great place to people watch!).

Go to Café Gelato if: You love ice cream and gelato!; you want a warm sandwich; you want a truly Italian experience - people watching under the façade of ice cream consumption.

Don't waste your money on those yummy looking cones unless you absolutely want one. The gelato you get is enough and the cones are mediocre.

3026060,2016-01-05,0,huOCKRwDvNqGX3KSzYawbw,"I visited Cafe Gelato when I stayed in Vegas with my family during Christmas. I believe it was our last day in town and after having dinner at the Fashion Show Mall food court, my cousins and I wanted ice cream. We've walked around Bellagio at least twice or three times during our visit and after walking back from the mall, we went back cause our parents wanted to play the slot machines. While they were playing, we got ice cream (I am not underage, btw. I am 23 while my cousins are not even 21 yet).

When we got to Cafe Gelato, there was a line but it didn't take long for us to order and pay. Since my cousin and I were still kinda full from dinner, we decided to share a cup. We got a two scoops gelato in a cup which cost about $4 (I forgot about the price). I got an Oreo while she got a Mint Chocolate Chip, while my other cousin (her little brother) got a Snickers. The price was reasonable since we got two scoops while my cousin got one and the scoops were pretty big and fulfilling. The guy that helped us with our gelato was really nice.

When I go back to Vegas, I'll definitely go back and try more flavors!",YYUqEiiX5fc1SK0LSDbMGQ,2,0,4,ORtCjNr1BH5nH10Eu_CNpg

We appreciated how it was open late (until midnight), and how the café interior was so welcoming, bright and warm.

The place was well-lit and very clean and had the feel of a '50s neighborhood ice cream parlor.

We ordered small cones and cups of gelato, and they were all great! Way more authentic than that sold nearby at the Palio Pronto. And the prices were more reasonable, too.

They've got some great flavors that taste very much like the gelato I've experienced in Italy. However, the price here is a bit more steep but still alright. This is no surprise given that it's located within a Strip casino.

My only gripe, which deducts one star from my review, is that the manager gave me such a bad attitude on my last visit. I had asked for two flavors to be included in my one cup. But for some reason he couldn't understand my request. It's not like this practice isn't common in almost every gelateria in the country as well as in Italy. I found it to be a simple request.

The manager gave me the harshest stare and condescending tone as he was trying to figure out what I was asking him to do. It made me a bit uncomfortable. Ultimately, another coworker intervened and scooped me exactly what I wanted. Afterward it seemed as if the manager were thinking to himself that it was MY FAULT that he didn't understand my request. I got the impression he just wanted me to GTFO. Sillys...

They had two staff members working, a girl and a guy. The girl was helping two girls in front of us when the guy called us up. I immediately asked for a sample of the cheesecake - big mistake. The guy seemed irritated that I'd dare ask for a sample. No sooner did he hand me the sample spoon - and he begins chatting with the girls in front of us. 

My friend and I exchanged glances. We waited a moment and then I asked if she knew what she was getting. The guy continued to ignore us. I finally said, ""I'll have a scoop of the snickers"" and was, unsurprisingly, promptly ignored. So I said it a second time, louder. Without making eye contact, the guy continued to talk with the women in front of us, scooped the gelato, and placed a cup on the counter. I asked my friend if she wanted me to order for her since he was still ignoring us so I said, ""And a scoop of oreo."" Again, the guy wouldn't even look at us as he served up the scoop, focusing solely on the women in front of us. 

He eventually was able to pull himself away long enough to ring us up. I told him I had a reward and he seemed offended that I didn't want to pay full price. I ended up tipping him nothing and he seemed pretty unhappy about that, making passive aggressive comments as we left. 

To top it all off, the gelato had ice crystals in it.

The gelato here is quite good. There are about 12-15 different flavors, and the prices are very reasonable ($4.75 for a single, which is actually two scoops of gelato, and $6.75 for a double, which is actually three scoops). We tried a single with a scoop of Baileys and a scoop of nocciola. The nocciola was delicious - strong hazelnut flavor and deliciously creamy gelato.

Das Eis selbst hat geschmacklich einen erfreulich geringen Zuckeranteil und die Geschmacksrichtungen sind auch nicht so wirr, wie bei Ben&Jerry, was zumindest für mich ein positiver Punkt ist.

It is a bit hidden in the Bellagio and you'll have to venture towards the less happening corridor of the hotel near the buffet and directly next to the gallery of fine art and the arcade. 

The two things that really make this cafe worth a visit is the price and the portion size. 

A Single gelato is $4.75 but they'll let you include two flavors and the fill it up and stack the scoops up high.

I really thought their Stracciatella flavor was really good. My only gripe about the gelato is that it becomes runny and melted too quickly but we also did come late at night so that could explain the drop in quality of the batches.

Have plenty of pastries/desserts, sandwiches, coffee, Kettle chips, and of course gelato. I would not recommend any of the pastries as they seemed generic. I feel like a lot of the bakeries on the strip had the exact same thing, and I wondered if they were all made at one spot and then delivered. Could be said about anything, but something I noticed as I tried numerous cafe/bakeries during my visit. 

The small cup was in my opinion very plentiful, and it took me some time to eat it. Creamy, velvety mint, with dark chocolate shavings throughout -- I enjoyed this more than the typical chocolate chips or chunks, as it was more delicate and seemed to blend better with the smoothness of the gelato. Wish I had been able to get more in the evening or tried more flavors. 

Larger space than expected with plenty of seating. I easily found a table to myself, as lots of people grab their desserts/sandwiches to go Also outdoor seating in the hallway. 

And this place is sort of hidden from the rest of the casino downstairs. You need to venture past the elevators and walk down a hallway, towards the pool. Not a lot of people came that way, so in the middle of the chaos , you get some peace and quiet. 

As for my breakfast sandwich, was good, but nothing amazing. Got a prosciutto, egg, cheese since the bacon/egg/cheese was sold out. A little bit more cheese to...well, anything ration, so it felt like eating a grilled cheese sandwich until I got to the egg. The egg was a welcome surprise as it wasn't beaten/cooked. Maybe it was over easy? The whole egg was cooked, but the yolk was slightly underdone, so I got a little gooeyness/texture. Enjoyed that!

The line moved quickly both times. If you're looking for basic breakfast pastries, this is the faster place to visit compared to other locations. 

The coffee was super hot and not too bitter.  I needed two napkins around the coffee sleeve to hold it. The gelato was very smooth. I went with chocolate, that had a rich flavor.",HRC0R4mQGJqpfQ0PvLCC_A,2,1,5,p8tc4ClOqjwRD49D9izQIg

I had the nocciola (sp?) and stratciatella - my two favorites. The first is hazelnut and the second is chocolate chip. These have always been my favorite and I was pleasantly surprised to find them here.

At first I was surprised by the prices but when I found out that a ""single"" meant two scoops, I was okay with it. 

Only thing that I didn't love was that they were selling food here...focus on your gelato, people! It seems odd that they sell soup in an ice cream shop but whatever works...",GYoYKIlYfxh7JmEReCxIig,2,0,5,pcESXDjgAG6niQJyQnwj_A

5640738,2015-02-10,4,huOCKRwDvNqGX3KSzYawbw,"I decided to stop by Cafe Gelato for a sweet treat when passing through the Bellagio. When I walked in at 7 p.m. the place was completely empty so I thought good for me more time to try different flavors. I started with the Tiramisu. The mouth feel of the gelato was perfect, silky smooth, rich, thick with the right creamy consistency and at the right temperature, however the flavor was off and it was one of the worst Tiramisu's that I'd had. I then switched gears to try the dulce de leche. By experience I know that this is supposed to be sweet, but here it was off the charts sweet. I mean it would literally give the not-too-sweet crowd nightmares, complete with the midnight shaking and cold sweat, that sweet. I was not too keen on this but before I could ask for a third taste the demeanor of the gentleman behind the counter changed, like don't you dare ask for another. I quickly looked around if there was a sign which said only two samples per customer or if I was holding up the line, both of which were not the case so I could not understand why the person would behave in such a way. Anyway I decided against another sample and went with a single scoop ($4.75) for which I could select two flavors. I went with one random flavor that looked good and got the dulce de leche from among the ones that I had tasted as the Tiramisu was terrible. Later I asked my friend to sample the dulce de leche and he literally spat it out saying ""diabetes"", but I hung in there and finished it even though it gave me a slight headache.

I would sum this up as reasonably priced, perfectly made gelato with a terrible flavor profile coupled with bad service. Sorry you don't have me as a fan.",HdrdiwMYkhWI49lmNPeziA,4,3,3,CrWBH3QP8YsKyou1qR5UNg
