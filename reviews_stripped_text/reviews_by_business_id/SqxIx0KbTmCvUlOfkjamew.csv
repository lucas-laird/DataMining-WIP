500434,2016-06-18,6,SqxIx0KbTmCvUlOfkjamew,"""Sorry you got sweet and sour sauce so you can't have any soy sauce.""

Wow.
What kind of place restricts condiments THIS MUCH?

We've been coming here for 3-4 years and the customer service has always sucked but the last couple visits have just been extra horrible.
It's not even just this instance, it's just kind of the last straw because of how ridiculous it is?

It's honestly disappointing to see that repeat customers will always be treated worse with each occurring visit :)

edit: we have frequented this place much more then my check ins would lead you to believe. 
There was a period of time that we went every other day. That's honestly why this is so upsetting.
Supporting a local business is good and all, but not when they run their business like this.

Good job saving that 2cents on the packet of soy sauce (we just wanted one or two lol)
And thanks for giving us the sweet and sour sauce spilled all over the bottom of the bag.
That was very mature of you :)",8Xko6Kye0u2o2jbLtj5vHw,4,2,1,7AQ99ZV3fSY4Yd6Fo7s9_w

644090,2013-11-07,0,SqxIx0KbTmCvUlOfkjamew,"I have been here quite a few times now. Both as dine in and take out. We have also frequented the Thai Noodle House on Wynn Road, but once we found out this was the same one but in the northwest we go here all the time. The prices are very reasonable ($8 or so a dish) and the flavor is the same. 

The decor at this location is much more modern and nicer than the original one in China Town i.e. this is casual date appropriate whereas the location in Chinatown would strike me more as meeting up with friends after having a few beers. Service has always been prompt and the food comes out quick. It has never been busy when we are here but I think that may just be lack of knowledge of this location. Which is good and bad, I like that it is not crowded and it is quiet but conversely I really want them to stay in business.  

I have tried quite a few things, but I always circle back to the Avocado and Salmon Panang. I love that they give a lot of sauce, because I like using my rice to sop up all the sauce and there is plenty to go around. I also get the duck curry quite often, but what can I say duck is almost always good. I always get the Thom Kai (same as Thom Kha Ka - please forgive me if I am not spelling this correctly). The meat, even the chicken, is tender - often times at other places, even at my favorite Lotus of Siam, the chicken is dry, more than likely from boiling the chicken in the broth, but I haven't had that experience here. 

This is a million times better than most cheap chinese places and the same cost as the prices are very reasonable. Although don't get me wrong, cheap chinese has its place in my little world too.  Not to mention they are in the same center as the German Bread Bakery - so if you time it right you could go to both and get morning pastries for the next day too!",xECpt0seSDbTmt1mGcfffA,1,0,4,VTy4xvybGGKA8okNSM-XLA

I got food to go so can't review the dine in experience, though all the people I dealt with were very friendly. I got the green papaya salad which was delicious but VERY spicy. I usually get a 7 and did that here also. I'd say their 7 is most other places 10! I also got the panang avocado curry with shrimp. This was totally delicious and while still very spicy it was closer to what I  would consider a 7. (I am not a wuss when it comes to spice but my tummy was a'gurgling after this meal!)

The food didn't seem fresh. I've had thai basil leaf/spicy basil from almost 30 different places and this was the first time I've heard of string beans in this entree however I didn't think I'd mind since it's typically one of my favorite vegetables, but not this time; they tasted dry and dehydrated as if they were old and reused.  Half of the entree box was the entree [mostly vegetables, little meat (this is coming from a light meat eater)] and the other half was overloaded with rice. 
On the other hand they had a sign regarding a minimum spend requirement to use a credit card, but they still allowed me to use my card without a fee (at least I didn't see one snuck in there) which I appreciated.

We started with the Papaya Salad and Grilled Beef Salad.  The Papaya Salad was mediocre at best, but the Beef Salad was fantastic.  Bright, fresh flavors in the dressing and a nice char on the beef.
For entrees we had Duck Pad See Eu and Snapper Pad Ped Snapper.  The noodle dish was awful.  We each only took 1 bite.  It had a funny taste that in retrospect should have prompted me to send it back.  There was just something wrong, like old meat or oil that had me repulsed.
The fish itself was light and flaky inside, but the coating was a soggy mess.  It had been fried, then tossed in sauce, but the fried coating wasn't crispy enough so it just ended up with an almost gooey texture that was very unpleasant.

Was immediately greeted and seated as we walked in. She even put the sun shade down for the boyfriend & I since it was a little sunny. 1 Star!

Ordered our mandatory Thai Teas, in those large beer mugs. Truly appreciate the amount of ice, some places overload it and it gets watery. Sweetness was on point too. 2 Stars! 

Food came right after, Chicken Satay, Chicken Pad Thai (Spice level 6) & BBQ Pork over Fried Rice. Dear lawd, I almost blurted ""Now THATS how it's supposed to be damnit!"" So delicious!!! Chicken skewers had just enough spice and really complemented the peanut sauce. I even put the sauce in my pad Thai. And speaking of that Pad Thai, holy sssshhhhhh, it was everything & more. Spicy but tolerable. Noodles were so flavorful. Chicken was perfectly seasoned. Then the rice and pork BBQ was delicious! The man enjoyed the sweet chili sauce that comes with it while I enjoyed the sweet soy sauce. 3 Stars!

Ended the meal with Sticky Rice & Mangoes. It was really sweet, even the mango. Rice could be softer but I loved it anyway. 4 Stars!

The egg drop soup was decent - it lacked a little flavor. The panang curry was delicious and I was able to taste the coconut milk with a little spice, but had more of a watery texture.

Both are always pretty good, I wish however they would provide me with a larger container for my curry. They fill the container to the rim with the delicious curry leaving me no room at all for my rice. I always end up using my own bowl to make due.

On two occasions they did have a delivery driver available. I ended up going to pick up the food and felt so much better knowing my food was coming from a really clean place.

Tried the chicken Satay. Nothing special, just chicken breast on sticks. No real flavor profile. The crab fried rice was salty.

I can go for awhile without it, then all of a sudden have a craving that simply can't be fulfilled.  By no means am I married to one Thai place, but my favorite is still probably the one by my house.

Don't be confused, though - I still enjoy this place every now and again.  We've spent some pretty good time together.  I've actually eaten here a few times but usually I get delivery to my job.

The pad see ew is absolutely delicious - the flat noodles are nice and well-cooked, tossed with a delicious sauce, chicken and plenty of vegetables (but not too many that you feel like you're getting stiffed).

The red curry I had when I was super-congested - I believe I ordered a 5 or a 6 (their spicy scale is 1-10) - and not only was it, too, tasty, but it also allowed me to breathe with its well-placed spiciness.

The pad thai is good and reminiscent of the pad se ew but I felt it lacked a little flavor as I really enjoy that in-your-face peanut sauce that, to me, is a staple of the pad thai dish.  It had a hint of a lemon flavor, which is the biggest reason I dislike the pad thai from Le Thai, but it wasn't enough to completely turn me off to the dish.  Or maybe I was starving that day.  I don't know, but it was gone pretty fast.

Each time there's certainly been enough for two meals (I just happened to really be hungry on the pad thai day) and the prices are quite reasonable.  Delivery time can vary - once I waited almost an hour while another time it was around 20 minutes.

Should mention we all eat Paleo most of the time and there is lots on this menu for Paleo or gluten free eaters. 

All the curries are great, our favorite remains the avocado/salmon (or shrimp) which we get them to add broccoli to as we require lots of vegetable intake. Also recommend the Chicken Satay, Ginger Snapper and do not miss the Pineapple Fried Rice which has such a special flavor. I have never been a fan of eggplant but do not miss the eggplant on this menu, it will blow you away! 

The prices simply cannot be beat. This is high quality cuisine at a truly reasonable price. 

As for the spot itself, could use some better lighting, it is just exceptionally bright. The tables are clean, the chairs really comfortable, and staff is always friendly and really knows the menu. You have to go outside to get to the bathroom around back but it is very clean. If you order take out be very careful in transport as some items are too much liquid for their take out boxes.

The Noodles hit the table next - ALMOST too spicey-hot - but that really means just right. The Pad Ped was a disappointment.  A completely different preparation from the last time we had it - the breading was not thick and crunchy, but more like a light dusting of fine panko and swimming in a thin sauce (last time it was more like a paste).

I've had most of the things on the menu and the only things I like are the soups, basil fried rice, sticky rice, and papaya salad. All of the entrees I've had were weird and not prepared anything like I've traditionally had, plus they give a huge amount of rice per entree and in the same container so the rice gets all soggy. For the price the soups are a good value but everything else isn't because I don't feel that it's edible. The meats are always a weird texture, almost like they used canned meat or something like in the garlic pepper chicken, ginger chicken, even the fried chicken which has rave reviews was a weird orange and also soggy. How do you serve soggy fried chicken?? I've had more entrees and also ones with beef which weren't to my liking. The only things I have liked didn't have meat in them or had tofu. I'll still come here for the soups and basil fried rice, but nothing else.

2466252,2016-12-23,0,SqxIx0KbTmCvUlOfkjamew,"My father works in the area, and after his own ravings, I had to try Noodle House.

When entering, the front room appears to be dirty, or, at least, the windows do. The tables, chairs, yadda yadda are all pretty good. (Honestly? Asian places are best when they look kinda dirty.) But don't let that deceive that.

The food? Pretty darn good. I personally had a bowl of Tom Kha, otherwise known as Tom Yum with coconut milk. The chicken was of good quality, although the amount of mushrooms definitely left me wanting more. The broth had a great taste, and for the value, the dish was massive. However, that's also it's downfall. While the broth was rich and great, I couldn't bring myself to finish it. Because of it's large amount, the broth by itself is a bit rancid and difficult to eat without any other ingredients, mostly because of its silky smooth texture.

My sister had the Appetizer sampler, complete with the great chicken kabobs, well made crab rangoons, typical egg rolls, and sadly disappointing fried tofu. It was too thin and dry to properly eat.

My favorite dish, however, were the flat Thai spice noodles. The beef had a succulent taste, and the fried noodles were delicious and melted in your mouth. It may have been one of the best thai dishes I had ever had -- even the amount of spice was perfect!

The value alone makes Thai Style Noodle House a must visit. While the rest of their Thai dishes are certainly great, I'll definitely be coming back for the namesake.",r8_eFH3w7d8j_Ig3WuAADg,0,0,4,al0nim9o0TycpulfHrrKhA

2633136,2013-05-09,7,SqxIx0KbTmCvUlOfkjamew,"As for so many other incredible ""gem"" finds, I have a trusted Yelp bud to thank for this one. Feeling under the weather a few months ago and craving spicy soup, I turned to my foodie Jedi Master, Kevin P for sage (and nearby) wisdom. Of course, he knew that this Chinatown staple had opened in our hood. Shares a car park with Smith's/German Bread Bakery, etc @ Rampart and Lake Mead. 

They do deliver, but a GF was kind enough to bring me spicy noodle soup (ordered 10/10 was more Ike an 8, but hit the spot) Like the original, they are known for their duck and it is an add on in many dishes; carnivore friends love it, not my thing. Drunken Noodles are a favorite and tasty and their curries are delicious. Really love that they inquire if you are vegan when you ask a dish to be prepared meat free and their willingness to change dishes for those of us who have restrictions. 

The value cannot be overstated: you easily get two meals from every portion here without compromising great taste. The decor is pretty, service is charming and on point and by now we all know the restroom is outside. Dining in is a lovely experience as the dying art of customer service with a smile abounds here. 

Over the course of several months, we've  ordered them in for Board Meetings, spontaneous gatherings and take and go a half dozen times. Everyone is equally astonished at location, quality and ROI. 

Almost glad to have had whatever the strange malady was which haunted my first week or so of year, as Kevin directed me to a clearly outstanding and unassuming place I'll continue to patronize and suggest to others. Now that they know me, I get my 10/10 spicy level and more. Welcome addition to the hood fo sho!

We ordered: 
1. Pad thai with chicken (with spicy #8) $6.75
2. Pad see-eu / pad see ew with beef (with spicy #7) $6.75
3. Vegetarian egg-rolls (4 pcs) $4.95

Taste: 3 stars - Our takeout pad thai was on the dry side - we prefer our noodles moist and juicy! On the other hand, our pad see ew was cooked very well, the noodles were moist and the beef was tender. Yet, both noodle dishes were lacking much salt and sweetness. We were expecting bold, vibrant, Thai flavors, but instead the flavors of the noodle dishes fell flat. I favored the moist pad see ew over the dry pad thai. The veggie eggrolls were crispy, but sadly not stuffed to the max with veggies. However, their homemade sweet and sour sauce was amazing! I would order extra sauce next time. 

Value: 5 stars - Wow! 2 dinner portions and an appetizer was $20! They were generous, even on takeout orders. They didn't skimp on any of the noodle dishes, lot's of meat and lots of noodles. It's hard to find decent local food on a bargain budget, but here it is! 

Service: 5 stars - The lady was very friendly over the phone and she also gathered up thai bird chilies in fish sauce and jalapeños in vinegar for us, as we requested. Even though we were the last customers in the door for the evening, she was still happy and helpful. 

Spice levels: 2 stars - Not very spicy. The spicy levels here are not true to taste. We ordered the pad see ew with spicy #7. In all honesty, we both felt that it was not a true 7, and more like a spicy #2. It wasn't spicy at all. We could of easily asked for a spicy 10 and enjoyed it. We also tried the pad thai with spicy #8, yes, it had minor heat, but more like a spicy #5. It wasn't spicy enough for us. (Note, we are avid spice fans. We love the burn!)

2991785,2017-01-09,3,SqxIx0KbTmCvUlOfkjamew,"One of my favorite Thai places in Vegas, especially if I am looking for authentic soup. The location is tiny, and easy to miss if you are not looking for it. No special décor, no dress code. Just real Thai food at it's finest, served by people who know what they are doing. 
For appetizers, I love the chicken satay, crab rangoons, and their special style of pot sticker, that is not like your classic gyoza at all. They offer Tom Kha, or Tom Yum, with or without noodle, and you also get to choose between 4 types of noodle. Also, they will totally accommodate special requests. I ordered regular chicken noodle soup, and they made it Thai spicy per my request. 
My daughter loves the pineapple fried rice, and gets it every single time we go here. Its a mix of shrimp and chicken, and is not spicy like other dishes.
Level 8 is my go to. It's almost unbearable, but still has tons of flavor. 
My boyfriend loves the garlic and pepper entrée with chicken, and a fried egg. 
You can get this as a lunch special as well, smaller portion but at a great price! He gets a level 5 or 6, and its just a tad spicy. Average, if you can't handle it, you shouldn't be eating Thai food! 
The curry is also a safe bet, I prefer yellow or panang. Pretty large portions with the dinner, I had to ask for extra rice. 
I have never once dined here and not been totally satisfied with my meal, the service, the pricing, and my overall experience. I eventually will step out of my normal routine and try something new!",NjNJ1JLnMlOfnDI6Oz6Qew,5,5,5,h1lDu4vYt4KnvX2fTC9EPw

Old rice is served, too.  My husband ordered Sweet and Sour Chicken and there was no chicken, just batter on skin.  Ewww.  Very disappointed, we used to love this place.  Either they need a new manager, or they will go out of business.  Waiters are not friendly, either.

3073314,2013-08-01,0,SqxIx0KbTmCvUlOfkjamew,"We liked it. It definitely does not deserve a 4 or more, though.

The inside is nice, clean, and modern. We weren't expecting that, especially after we saw the prices. Dishes were mainly around $7.95-8.95, which we thought were more along the lines of fast food prices. The portions, however, were remarkably small. You get what you pay for I guess.

We started off with a papaya salad, at a spicy 8/10. For some reason the portion we got was very very little, compared to some yelp pictures I checked online. Even the cabbage was just a small hunk, but when I asked for more, they were very accommodating.

We got some sort of veggie stir fry flat noodle, which was good, but could've been better. The vegetables in it weren't great, the carrots were sliced too thin, and the portion was again, too small.

The last thing we got was our least favorite. It was a seafood pancake, which I expected to be kind of like the ones you get a Korean restaurants, so I was curious about the Thai version. It was seriously lacking in the seafood, way too much starch or whatever they mixed it with so as a result kind of bland, and FAR too oily. I don't rarely blot food with napkins, but I did so in this situation. Also not a fan of the bed of stir-fry bean sprouts it came on, I think raw would've been more authentic? Just my two cents.

All in all, we really wanted to like it, we kind of liked it, and we hope that in the future they give bigger portions. We both agreed we could've gotten a fourth dish, which shouldn't be the case with any restaurant to feel full unless it's tapas.",IfgOJxjRPDTIJnXDfRUZKw,1,1,3,PKNd73Cb0797HzJsUTkddg

My husband and I stopped in last night (Saturday) at the recommendation of a coworker who lives in the area, and we really enjoyed the food - this is definitely a solid place for a good Thai dinner!

It's a cozy, welcoming place - very modern decor, with two different seating areas - we asked to be on the left side of the restaurant since nobody else was there, which they had no problem with. Someone came over quickly to get our drink order, and we put our dinner order in at the same time since we generally order the same thing every time we have Thai - chicken tom kha soup to share, chicken pad thai (me) and chicken thai fried rice (him) - all at a 6, or 7 if we really feel like punishing ourselves. 

Our food came out quickly. Portions are a perfect size - there was enough tom kha for both of us to have a couple bowls and take home a serving for leftovers - husband finished all of his fried rice, but I had plenty of pad thai leftover. The food was delicious - very fresh and at the perfect spice level! Very flavorful. Their tom kha soup had more of a sweetness than we are used to, but it was so good - a welcome change. 

At the end of our meal, someone else came around to check on us and make sure we liked our dinner and to ask if we needed anything. We didn't ever feel like we were waiting for service here, even as they started to get busier. Last thing to mention - prices are very reasonable. I think our bill was just over $20.

Service is hit or miss; they never seem to answer the phone and they more than happy to make you wait half an hour to refill water or bring your check.. When the restaurant is empty.

It was an aesthetic, pleasant surprise to see a mom and pop establishment so nicely decorated.

Anyhow, I've been craving some noodles and I went with the intention of ordering the Thai beef noodle soup. From what I can remember, Thai noodle soup has a much better flavor than pho IMO. As I was looking at the different noodle soups I noticed one called Pork and Fish Ball noodle soup. Man, I am so glad I went with his one--this bowl of soup was absolutely delightful. You get your choice of four different types of noodles, i went with the flat rice noodles for my bowl. It contains pork, ground pork, and fish balls in a chicken broth. It is garnished with fried garlic, which is the one ingredient that pulls all these great flavors together so well. The broth had a nice clean taste to it with a hint of white pepper. It looks pretty simple but the flavors are so good, I didn't wanna mess with it by adding anything to it. I left it unembellished and ate it all as it came. This is one of the few noodle soup dishes that I didn't feel the need to doctor up with hoison or sriracha.

The ingredients in this soup was reminiscent of what comes in my fave noodle soup dish called Phnom Penh noodles. The Vietnamese make a version of this soup and they call it hue tieu Nam Vang but I have not been able to find a worthy substitute for my PP noodles until now. 

Great prices, great noodle dishes and friendly service. So glad this 3rd location opened up so I don't have to go to Chinatown or the SW for some awesome noodle soup.",S2tfbnjoCzMX0U0B_cTXVw,20,16,4,W4a6zrS629tDEdLjqVutPw

3770427,2017-11-28,1,SqxIx0KbTmCvUlOfkjamew,"I'm mixed on this place for a few reasons, but thought to round up based on the reason of coming here: for the food.

So on a Saturday night, we were craving Thai food in the area. It seems every place needs a reservation, even a Thai restaurant. The one down the street, I could understand as it was an ""upscale"" version of one. This place, however, seemed to be a mom and pop place that was like any other noodle houses from the LA area I am used to. Just to be sure, I called to see if they needed reservations. The lady on the phone, who spoke non-fluent English, claim I need a reservation for 2 kids and 2 adults. I had a feeling this was yet another place pulling my leg with the ""need reservations on a Saturday night."" And yes, it was one of those spots that lied.

We showed up 10 minutes after I called... to an empty noodle house other than 3 tables occupied. Just as I thought: another place claiming you needed reservations. What was a bit of an insult in addition to that notion was the fact that this place has zero customer service! No hello, no smile, no glance. We stood there for close to 5 minutes until a staff finally said they would be with us. Ok...

Again, the place was rather empty at 6pm-ish on a Saturday, with the exception of hearing a grumbling waitress telling us to order quickly as they're backlogged on orders mainly due to deliveries. So now it's slowly making sense!

Anywho, why were we here--to grub!!!! I will say this: the food here is delicious enough that the non-existent customer service can be waived. We tried the pat see ew and pineapple fried rice: basic Thai food that can easily be botched due to catering to the ""American"" taste buds and not actual Thai. Is this actual Thai? To a point. I can tell from the seasoning that Chinese spices such as Maggi sauce seasoning and Chinese 5-spices powder were used on both of the dishes...but it made the food good! So good that the 2 adults scarfed down every piece of food on our plates. And it was not because we waited around 40 minutes after we ordered to finally eat (hey, they did give us a heads up).

Food: good
Price: even better for the food!
Customer Service: subpar

Overall, I would give this place another shot if I happen to be in the area. I just hope that blowing off customers own the phone claiming they need reservations when it wasn't the case does not deter you from eating at this tiny joint!",bV7-Wtuu_TsE2Z9nEZNXpg,0,0,4,qvReNP9Ht-5zcfX8gr3zCg

ATMOSPHERE
I remember when I first moved to Vegas, this place was an Hawaiian plate lunch place. It was a bright and welcoming place. Now it looks completely different; modern and clean. I just love walking in here.

SERVICE
Better than other restaurants I've been to. Servers here are helpful and very fast. I'm always impressed because there are usually only 2 servers but they provide fast and great service to each and every single customers.

FOOD
Their menu is a bit overwhelming because there are so many choices! If you don't know what to order from here, I recommend:
-Beef combination noodle (love the soup! you can choose the type of noodles. Egg noodle is my favorite)
-Ginger snapper (LOTS of vegetables)
-Orange chicken (always fresh and crispy!)

A sore throat brought me in yearning for something warm and comforting to sooth it.

I ordered the sliced beef Thai noodle soup bowl with wide noodles and the hubby ordered the mixed beef with ramen noodles.  

I would advise the sliced beef if you're ordering this dish. The mixed beef has some mushroom looking cuts that resemble liver so for me the sliced beef was the winner. 

I got it to-go.  However, if you stay in and dine.  Check your good table manners at the door and forget everything your momma taught you because this delicious slurpable broth with loads of flavor, crunchy fresh bamboo shoots and bok choy nesting on top will leave you slurping and licking your bowl dry while begging for more. That is if you can finish it-because the serving is PLENTY for TWO.

4014544,2013-12-24,1,SqxIx0KbTmCvUlOfkjamew,"Great little place for some good Thai food!

Located on N. Rampart in the Smith's shopping center, Thai Style is located on a near corner of a lot.  Go slow or you might miss it because the place is tiny.  Really, there might be just over a dozen tables available for dining in.  But that's ok because Thai Style has no problems with doing take-out for you.  If you do dine in though don't worry, the place is nicely appointed!  New tables, chairs, paint.  Good ambiance, especially when it's quiet.  I hear during lunch is when the crowd is probably the biggest.

Came here with the wifey for a quiet dinner one night after we heard their second location opened up here near our side of town.  Really felt like the place was our own, there were only two other tables taken nearby, and on the counter was multiple orders ready for pickup.

The menu at Thai Style is fairly authentic feeling, with some dishes looking like they may have got a bit of an American touch.  We stuck with what we were hoping was simple and basic, but had a lot of flavor.

I love noodles, but really wasn't feeling Pad Thai.  We instead opted for the Pad See-Eu - stir-fried thick flat rice noodles (almost like chow fun) with egg and Chinese broccoli, all in a sweet dark soy sauce.  This was delicious.  The rice noodles with the sweet soy sauce was heavenly, and was given good texture with the addition of the Chinese broccoli.  It makes perfect leftovers, great midnight snack in front of the TV while watching Breaking Bad reruns!

We also had the Fried Chicken over Fried Rice - marinated, fried chicken breasts over a bed of Thai Jasmine fried rice.  This was good as well.  I would have liked the chicken to be a bit more flavorful, and a bit of a thicker piece.  However, it was yummy with the Thai fried rice which had egg, garlic, onion, salt, and pepper.  The rice was seasoned easily but just right.  And the portion was huge, more than enough for two people to share.

We got out of Thai Style with full bellies and some leftover change.  The bill was not bad at all, our total for two entrees, tax, and tip was under $19.  That was a plus!  We will be back to try other dishes, I really am interested in their red and yellow curries.

Thai Style runs some amazing lunch specials too, for short of $7 you can get a choice of TWO (yep, two) entrée options from a pretty big list, and each lunch special comes with soup, rice, and an egg roll.  Don't want two entrees?  Do just one, and pay less than $6!  Dealio.",QCtHk02W_Asu2LFfdmGQDA,6,4,4,pAm5txHQXEqEvJa5XVfuQA

Noodle house has a few other restaurants in town that have been successful. So I guess it made sense to open in this part of town.

Always try the duck fried rice. It's one of my favorite dishes here with noodle house classic pot stickers to boot!

The food just tastes like they use off-cuts in everything and cheaper recipes for their dishes now. There's more spice than flavor.

We were so happy after that first visit that we returned and took along another couple - who may be moving to our fair city - to introduce them to life as locals.  Our experience was less than stellar.  But I didn't update my review then.  On the second visit, I ordered the same salmon dish I had the first time, and it was so bad I had to send it back.  The waitress tried to explain that they use frozen salmon, and yada, yada.  Its replacement was just ordinary.  The other couple were split 50-50 in their opinions of their dishes.

During our first visit we wanted to get more information about take-out, figuring that we'd be doing that on a regular basis.  We particularly wanted to know about the soup.  Our Tom Kha was fabulous, and it was such a big bowl that we couldn't imagine we'd get that much if we had it as take-out, but the waitress assured us it was a very big container.

So on this uncharacteristically rainy night, we opted for take-out from Noodle House.  My first disappointment was taking an ordinary Chinese restaurant-type plastic container out of the bag that was only three-quarters full.  It turned out not to matter:  the soup was so unbearably spicy that we couldn't finish it.  It also had half the amount of chicken that our dine-in portion had.  

Four vegetable spring rolls were decent, but very greasy.  

We ordered our main dish, Pad Thai, as a chicken-beef-shrimp combination.  It had a ""generous"" helping of two rather small shrimp, chewy and flavorless beef, and some tender chicken.  This dish is usually very bland at other Thai restaurants, but this one was very spicy.  I didn't mind that, since it didn't cause smoke to come out of my ears like the soup did.  But the noodles were rubbery, and if it had chopped peanuts, there weren't enough to taste them.  A disappointment.

I guess it was too good to be true, but we'll go back to the other Thai restaurants we used to go to before our hopes were raised by the opening of Thai-Style Noodle House, which is so much closer to our home.  Those hopes sadly have been dashed.",m-BZLIIh5PCAKnzH0qj_0Q,3,0,2,s8eigNd18TKe7sddKjPOIw

It also came with dipping sauces (sweet and sour and peanut butter ). If I had to pick one thing off the platter the Crispy Shrimp would be my favorite . It is shrimp wrapped in a egg roll wrapper then deep fried. 

I ordered the BBQ & Chinese pork Fried Rice  for $6.95. This was plenty to split and also take some home for lunch the following day. The rice was delicious it wasn't soggy and had fresh veggies in it. I've seen some places that put frozen vegetables in their rice which is a total turn off.

It takes 20+ minutes to put in a simple delivery order. Insane! On top of that frustration, she gets upset with me because I make special requests (which are so simple btw) because I like my food prepared in a specific way and she seems to get overly irritated with me. Did I do something wrong by making a simple request of how I (the paying customer) likes to have my food prepared? I don't think so! She acts as if I'm difficult when in fact it's the other way around. 


Here's a solution: Put someone who speaks clear English to take delivery orders. 

This is EXTREMELY frustrating and the next time I visit in person I will be addressing it with the owner or manager and if they don't acknowledge this as a valid concern then you lose me as a customer forever. Not that they care but I'm making it known in case they read this review. I actually placed a delivery order today and experienced the same problem AGAIN. I will no longer be ordering from here because I get tired of dealing with people who can't speak English clearly enough to communicate effectively. Especially when I am a paying customer.

I had their spicy Thai noodles and a Thai tea both times. The level of spiciness was very inconsistent. I got a 6 the first time and barely made it through the dish. Got a 6 the second time and tasted little to no heat. 
My Mom had the BBQ pork which she thought was dry. She kept putting the broth from the soup on it to make it semi palatable. 
Fried calamari appetizer was the best part of the meal.

It's close by and prices are extremely reasonable! Some of their dishes are as close to authentic Thai food as I can get in this town. The staff is Thai and they service is fast and friendly. 

The food is yummy and great quality. I'm always weird about getting chicken at asian restaurants so I usually get beef. I feel like here, they are using only the breast so I get great chicken pieces in my dish. I grew up with chickens and sometimes, they were dinner so I'm picky and would only eat the breast if I had a choice.

When it comes to food, It being great when it is great is not enough to overcome the times it's not by the food tasting as if it isn't cooked enough or has gone slightly bad or old.

For the most part when I've been here the Pad Tai is great and the soups are good too. But a few times iv'e gotten Pad Tai where the meat tasted as if it, as I said was not cooked enough or had started going bad or old. I got shrimp Pad Tai once, tasted very fishy. So I thought i'll just stay away from the shrimp, then one of the chicken Pad Tai's I got tasted the same way.. little old or uncooked.

4989928,2018-03-25,0,SqxIx0KbTmCvUlOfkjamew,"RUN, DON'T WALK from this truly terrible neighborhood Thai restaurant.

Just about the worst service I've ever had in Las Vegas. 

Each person in our party of six ordered their own food individually. 

It was NOT a family-style or shared or buffet style order. 

Yet they brought out the dishes one by one, with each plate brought out several minutes after the last, So no one could eat at the same time.

They also did not bring out any silverware or extra plates for people who'd not yet been served, so it was impossible for people who'd been served to share with people still waiting for food.

They forgot about my order entirely. 

After being reminded twice to bring out my food, it finally arrived after everyone else had finished about half their meal.

So I ended up having to take most of my meal home, because others were done eating well before me.

To add insult injury, they then took it upon themselves to add an 18% tip to the bill, but then hid this from me by bringing me a credit card slip with a blank for a tip, obviously hoping to get tipped twice.

When we complained that the horrible service did not justify an 18% tip, they refused to lower it or remove it, claiming that they impose a mandatory 18% tip on groups of six.

The food is strictly ho-hum, mediocre, middle of the road. Nothing special about the food. 

I don't judge a restaurant by the decor, but the decor in this place is truly hideous, chaotic and disconnected. There's nothing even remotely Asian (or, for that matter, tasteful) about the decor.

For a better and more authentic Thai experience in the neighborhood, with excellent service, excellent food and beautiful decor, go instead to Pin Kaow on W. Lake Mead Blvd. and rainbow Boulevard",Ddm15k3KLrqhKTWghGFHJQ,0,0,1,ZSfuZaPo93sSCUrgCZSvOg

The Noodle House has excellent lunch specials! Which we totally took advantage of. You can choose from one or two items from their menu. On this visit I ordered the Red Curry with Pork. Joel had the Orange Chicken and Beef with Broccoli. Our meals came with egg drop soup and an egg roll. The egg drop soup was really tasty. I had to stop myself from filling up on the soup it was so good. Plus, it didn't have that fake yellow color egg drop soup always has. My Red Curry was delicious. The pork was tender and the Curry itself had the perfect coconut milk flavor coupled with a great spice that wasn't overwhelming. The egg roll was crisp and full of veggies. Joel's Orange Chicken was also seriously tasty. It's normally not my thing, but it was so tender and not overly sweet. I kept sneaking bites of his chicken.

The BF and I shared the pineapple curry with shrimp. The curry was red curry coconut base which was decent. It was a bit too tangy for me, but it was well made and had a good amount in shrimp, pineapple and veggies in it. It comes with just a cup of rice, we had to ask for another cup, which is extra per cup. 

Spicy Thai noodles - think of it similar to pad se ew, but with other veggies like cabbage, tomatoes, carrots, onions in it. It wasn't very spicy though. In fact, they didn't ask us about our spice level at all, but maybe then they assumed to go mild. I should probably ask next time. 

For the portions, these were cheap... a few dollars less than the average going rate. The flavor I thought was decent. I don't know what it was about it, but I rarely get heartburn and did. It was odd is all. 

Service was just OK. We came an hour before their closing (20 minutes before closing is kitchen last call) and when we entered they kinda seemed a bit bummed we showed. They weren't the most attentive given we were the only ones there, but there were take out orders coming through still. I had to walk up to get my bill since the 3 people in the front were all busy doing something. The food came out lightening fast which was a plus, but also was maybe so we can get done fast.

Your options are extensive and include all of their curries, unlike some Thai spots that really limit what they offer on lunch special. It comes with soup, rice and a fried treat, and the two picks are served in a nice sized dish. I think flavor-wise they are really consistent with the original location, and this location is definitely up the scale on the fancy factor- white chairs, tile on the wall, was that a chandelier? Although, it is odd you have to go outside to go to the bathroom.

I selected the mint chicken and green curry for my two. The chicken is minced, and the flavor was nice, but I probably wouldn't order it again. I realized I am out of Thai Style practice because I didn't remember the green curry coming with a mountain of bamboo shoots. I am not a fan of bamboo shoots, but the curry still had a fabulous flavor. Next time, I have to remember to order it with vegetables, hold the shoots.

Another dish I enjoy is the Pad See Ew, flat rice noodle with a soy sauce based flavor and Chinese broccoli and the option of protein or tofu. A great option from the popular Pad Thai that most people are accustomed to.

My only complaint I have is the customer service. At times the service is great and other times it's been lacking. A few times we have been ignored or the order is wrong. The management needs to take the initiative to communicate the entire staff on how to handle customer service. I have a few friends and neighbors complained that the posted time doesn't correlate to the actual operating hours. I still remember we were turn down at 9:28pm and the posted time was 10:00pm. The staff member on duty told us that the kitchen is closed. This is very misleading to the public and doesn't reflect a professional business practice. I recommend that you call ahead if you plan to arrive later in the evening. Overall, delicious Thai food at a reasonable price point!

When getting the food home we noticed that the crab rangoons did not have a bit of crab in any of them. We paid $8 for cream cheese filled pastrys that were not that great. The Thai curry saved the meal. It was the right amount of spicy, chicken was tender and delicious, and veggies the perfect softness. The chicken pad Thai was okay, but my friend told me it's not as good as The brown rice Thai kitchen. All in all, this place is okay, but didnt blow us away. We may order from here again because the price was right and the chicken curry was good, but we won't be ordering the ""crab"" Rangoons again. The reason I didn't give it 4 stars was do to the service and crab rangoons. If we have a better experience next time I may change my rating.",1sHlSf8FyyYOOSmZnoK4FQ,0,0,3,kWrcLPyjSKFlNQ1-iTMsGw

5386500,2017-12-01,0,SqxIx0KbTmCvUlOfkjamew,"This is one of my most visited Thai restaurants in Vegas for multiple reasons. The food is great for a really reasonable price. I think their Panang curry is super flavorful and that goes for vegetarian and meat added as well. I love their spicy basil leaf tofu, pineapple fried rice, and the pad thai and pad see ew -- which are pretty standard. I also really like their papaya salad + Thai beef jerky--probably the most winning items I have tried on their menu. It's got the right amount of spice and crisp on the edges, and the papaya salad compliments it well. I could go on and on because their selection is great and everything I have tried has not disappointed. 

This location has a good amount of seating and is cute and spacious inside. One thing to note is that it takes a bit longer for food to come out, so not so great if you are in a rush.",wxDM6hqyW5OPp5cXzn6F0w,0,1,4,QRcLNJ3ZYOm-Hk3xkG_7hQ

I think this place is pretty new, because I haven't noticed it until recently.  Excellent food quality & prices.  The service is fast & friendly.  The location is very small, but extremely clean and very pretty inside.  Most of the soups are $6.50 - 7.  

I tried the pork & fish ball soup because of another yelper's recommendation, and I was not disappointed!  I love that they offer 4 different choices of noodles, as I opted for the flat rice noodle.  Other noodle choices include: egg, vermicilli, or thin rice noodle.  Be careful with the little spice rack they bring out, as a little spice goes a long way.  Without meaning to, I overspiced my soup a bit, but it was still wonderful.  I just ended up drinking a lot of water and nursing my runny nose while enjoying my soup.  On my next visit, which will be very soon, I plan to try the Tom Yum soup.  Honestly, everything on the menu sounds great, which offers a full array of Thai dishes in addition to the soup.

5492571,2014-06-09,1,SqxIx0KbTmCvUlOfkjamew,"I've tried all 3 locations and this location wins best decor.  The food is pretty much the same at all locations with the two outside of Chinatown being newer and cleaner in appearance.  Thai Style is my favorite Thai spot outside of the pricier Lotus of Siam.  I think the options are a better value than say Archie's for the typical Thai fare, with some options you might not see at some of the more generic Thai restaurants. Some of my favorite dishes are the beef/pork jerky with this amazing sweet/salty/sour dipping sauce.  The Moo Tod (fried pork) over fried rice is also delicious, with the pork being fried with a hint of sweetness.  The pork comes over a heaping portion of fried rice.  It also comes with a bland soup...which I generally don't partake in...but I'm told it's a palette cleanser.   My new favorite find has been the Three Companion Pork, which comes with sticky rice, papaya salad, and either pork or chicken.  The papaya salad here is a refreshing option for the Las Vegas summer heat.  It's a blend of green papaya, tomatoes, green beans, and carrots sprinkled with peanuts.  It's a bit spicy even when I ordered it at a level 2 out of 10.  My nose was getting runny while eating it, but I kept going back for more until the dish was empty.  I like that Thai Style also offers duck as an option instead of just chicken/beef/pork.  The duck fried rice and duck pad see ew are delicious.  In the wintertime, I also enjoy the beef noodle soup.  The broth is a dark, thick broth with a variety of beef cuts and beef meat balls.  Most items are $7-9 for a large portion.",Tdv7HZa4Hyjm-X0MtNmeag,5,6,5,dGgtKdHtmyBfGXpUphmkXA

5517572,2017-05-02,2,SqxIx0KbTmCvUlOfkjamew,"We still love coming here as our Thursday ritual after the kids are done with their activities. Mainly, it's a 2 minute drive from where we are coming from and by this point we needs-ta-eat. It's not fancy, not grimey...perfect dining setting for our party of 6. We never ever have to wait for a table here especially because of our party size so that's another reason why eating here has become our ritual. While I still love their food and price point...I will have to say we have clearly seen a slight change in their food. My husband has been ordering the spicy Thai noodle (fat noodles) the past few times in a row because he lies to think what he is getting served was just an off night. Safe to say that isn't the case. He's been griping about why he doesn't get baby corn in it. Lol. The past 2 times he's poked his fork around in disgust because he notice that the veggie-to-noodle ratio is well, damnt...I such at math. Why did I even bust the ratio word out. Hahahha. Okay seriously though, his dish looks more like a stir fried vegetable plate rather than a noodle dish with vegetables. 

We ALWAYS order the Thai fried rice and I swear the past several times its either lacked in flavor and/or on the oily side!! They used to serve it all nice to us...throwing coriander leaves on there, etc...but the serving size looks like it has reduced and no more pretty garnishments. Honestly, those garnishments whether it was a part of the dish or truely meant to be a garnish helped made the dish taste even better. 

My beef soup I would order used to have fried garlic sprinkled, enough bean sprouts and baby bok choy to make me feel veggie satisfied...but again, it's like they're skimping us short. Havent had the garlic in it in awhile, sometomes i dont even think there are any bean sprouts, and the flavor has definitely lack as well. We come here weekly for the past few years so we would know for a fact if they have started to change up ways. Considering we have been coming here for a few years and only of late have we noticed a change...I wonder if they have a new cook, on a budget cut, etc...

Bummer. I loathe when that happens. Anyway, we will still be coming in until we seriously have had enough and get fed up. Even with those new gripes, I'd still recommend giving them a shot.",MC0aQHT7mQ1WJknOD6u8pg,3,4,3,RZ9xGSjDjIo5nytkEGforg

3- reasonably priced lunch menu

 today.. I decided to order for delivery. I called at 11 (right when they opened), ordered my food, and the lady said there was going to a $2 charge for delivery because they charge $1 per mile. I don't mind paying it but across the street is not 2 miles, Google maps says the place is 0.4 miles. Then on top of that they said it would take 45 mins for the food. Why? You just opened.. It takes about 10-15 to cook it, and its only 5 min drive to the office.

If I was pregnant, I would have made my husband drive to Komol just to pick up a week's supply. Unfortunately, I am not pregnant and due to my crazy soccer mom schedule I can't drive their myself. (I barely have time to write this review!) 

Anyways, I was still craving some Thai food so I settled for Thai Style Noodle House for lunch since it is minutes from my own.  I have been here twice, ordering take-out both times.  The restaurant itself is decorated really cute.  but take-out is just so much more convenient for me.  Some of my favorite items are Pad See-eu with beef, Green Curry with chicken, and the Panang with avocado and shrimp.  These dishes are full of flavor and the spice levels are just enough to clear my sinuses and make me sweat/ glisten.  My kids enjoy the chicken chow mein (i know, i know...that isn't Thai food).  There is a good amount of chicken and veggies that they will actually eat!

The items that I did not really care for were the Beef Stew noodle soup and the Chicken Larb.  They were flavorful, however it was just too salty for me to eat more than 2 bites. I chugged my Thai iced tea in seconds, and chased it with a gallon of water. In fact, just thinking about it is giving me a salt headache.

** Note: some reviews state that there is no restroom. There is one around back.  It isn't inside the actual restaurant, but there is one.  It isn't the most convenient location, but there is no need to torture your bladder. **

She's a regular so they also brought out extra noodles for her because she likes to take it home and make another meal out of it.
