At the very least a message on an answering machine. So I called your other location and they didn't know whether or not you were open but they were.  They asked if I smelled BBQ because maybe you were cooking in the back. Seriously?  I do love your food but Buzz BBQ got my money today.,YfYas8wdkrrvbqXcBH9x9w,0,0,1,90n-4DNj5IWhJKPn8W6DdQ

 When I pulled up there were people out back bbq'ing  on an open pit and it smelled really good.

They have the big $5 lunch special sign out front and after looking over the menu I was disappointed they only serve chicken,ribs and links here.

No brisket, NO pork loin, no bratwurst, no chili,no mac & cheese

I ordered a 2x2-ribs & 1/4 white chicken plus potato salad & baked beans

The bbq sauce was very sweet and it covered everything. The beans were canned and the potaot salad was creamy. Really creamy?? Whats up with that?

The ribs were tough and gristly with way too much sweet sauce on them. The chicken was juicy but crisy and the sauce worked well with it.

I wouldn't go out of my way again but some people might like that outdoor bbq flavor.",3Vd_ATdvvuVVgn_YCpz8fw,13,10,2,BnehvYnh_aez8LZN9-whEw
5815256,2008-11-03,7,w1gAEE4anHxNNZtJoJOTUg,"The owner of Cook's apparently moved the location further down the street between July and November and the new address is shown above.

The dining options on the Strip are numerous, but overpriced and in some cases downright nasty (see my La Creperie review).

I wanted to take a tour of the other side of Vegas and get good food cheap.  Not the buffets!

The previous review at the old location lured me to Cook's.  That reviewer mentioned that the owner was packin' and I had to see this.

I went to the old location and saw nothing.  I needed fuel for my dinosaur catcher, so I asked the clerk at 7 Eleven, ""Where can I get the best BBQ in Vegas?""  He mentions Cook's and tells me that the new location is down the street.

Burglar bars covering the windows.  Uh oh.  The area surrounding Cook's is somewhat hood and as the night falls that title sticks.   

I drive up and notice a big sign that displays lunch specials for $5.  The specials are served between 11am and 4pm daily.  They include beef, ribs, and similiar other meats with 2 sides and Wonder Bread.   

The owner wasn't packin' (I didn't ask either).  The decor envelopes you like Muzik at the dentist.  Low ceilings and walls that are adorned with pictures of famous black people greet the hunger crazed diner.

Said owner was preaching about politics, sports, gambling, and strippers all at the same time.  I stole a few quick glances at ole boy but he seemed fine....

The ribs and sauce were OK.  Not among the best that I have tasted, but OK nonetheless.  Work needs to be done on both fronts.

Those beans need the most work.  Runny with no flavor at all.  Note to owner who I hope is reading this:  DRAIN THEM THINGS FOLK!!

I polished off the above in record time and ordered the links w/beans to go (Beans, beans, good for the heart.  Beans, beans, great for the heart)!  The story concerning the links gets worse......major work needs to be done here.  

Will I go back.  Yes!  Why you ask???  The price.",4WLBYT9wHBcK-nQxiNvn8Q,5,6,3,NmPK_-4hEPL-70oMRT0TCA
