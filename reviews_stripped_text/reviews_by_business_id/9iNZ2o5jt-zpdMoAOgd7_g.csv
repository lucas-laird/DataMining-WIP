192101,2012-06-14,17,9iNZ2o5jt-zpdMoAOgd7_g,"We've go here all the time for Chinese food. Its the Best in Las Vegas and the prices are very reasonable and they give you plenty of it too!!!! You can go and sit down with  4-5 friends and all of you can spilit the family meal and all eat for $25 bucks and walk away full. Last night we orders a family meal $23 and I did not want the egg drop soup, so they offered to give us an appetizer. They did not have delivery til 5pm but because i called in to see about delivery, they offered 20% off the bill if i met them at the front gate of nellis afb. This place is a heck of alot better then PF.CHANG'S and can not beat the price. I love the orange chicken and sweet and sour chicken, the egg rolls are amazing.  I look back on my first impression of this place i thought it was a hole in the wall. man was i shocked inside is very clean and the food is delicious.Yummy!!!!!",otoVMwdvjyMZbazDBUj6vQ,3,0,5,GduBo1XTMRADNKDK89yRpA

352851,2015-01-01,9,9iNZ2o5jt-zpdMoAOgd7_g,"My first visit. Ordered two things, chicken chow mein and crab cheese wontons. The price is ok too.

The chow mein was ok. It needed flavor though. The noodles I think we're a bit too soft, almost soggy. Needs more cabbage.

The crab cheese wontons, they're really just cream cheese wontons. That was a little disappointing. But still tastes fine.

Will give this place a try again.",9Kgz60mivLD10Xrs5WB5Zw,1,0,3,X61-AILxlQEjulUBuQ7Q2A

2574642,2010-12-03,20,9iNZ2o5jt-zpdMoAOgd7_g,"Close to home, and delicious. I can't argue with that. They have fast service and if you choose to dine in (which we haven't) they will give you a military discount. Also, we get 2 free eggrolls with a $15 purchase. Who doesn't love free eggrolls? They also have surprisingly good chicken wings. I love that they come plain, so you can dress them up how you like them. Great for parties! I was also happy to see that they were not scrawny little wings, but good sized. Although the building looks a bit old, the inside is clean. The staff is always nice, and I would definitely recommend this place if you like Chinese food.",leWfFL7qOWBaBhpnlL0vxQ,6,1,4,2QSWUWYTQG4ansC3N1q7Tg
2664558,2017-05-01,0,9iNZ2o5jt-zpdMoAOgd7_g,Chicken chow mein was the best I've had in Vegas. It took a long time to get our food but we'll worth the wait. The cashier brought us drink cups with no charge because it was taking so long. Fried rice was a little bland and next time I will get steamed not fried potstickers,IrrulcUUCHg3deMsrdF_xg,0,0,4,8XhzpZJYpOxbm6Lx4DtkCQ

I couldn't tell if we were going to be served table side, or if we picked up our food at the counter... The whole experience was rather awkward.

Rice had this really inedible flavor. I was so hungry too. Picked at it as much as I could, but I am pretty sure that was the worst Chinese food I've had in my life..yep, pretty sure.",LnGDsxHFPhoCKT8sFGaViA,1,1,1,9skjykHp7A9DAyM016x2Qw

5311106,2013-01-16,15,9iNZ2o5jt-zpdMoAOgd7_g,"I can't really say much with their other dishes, because we come here for the fried rice. Shrimp fried rice and vegetable fried rice are staples in our household. I am easy to please when it comes to fried rice. Serve me up some crunchy vegetables, shrimps that are not overdone, and eggy rice with just enough grease that it would not make my belly hurt. 

Prices are cheap (between $7-8 bucks for heaping servings of fried rice) and fast (5-10 minutes tops). Did I say I love fried rice?",jxyn_AhI_DY36Nd8KId36w,1,1,3,jw-ei4zqcsDkTbY3v84V6w
