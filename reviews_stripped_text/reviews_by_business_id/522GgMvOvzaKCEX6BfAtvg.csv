Cal and Baja and love Mexican food.  This place may be my new favorite in Las Vegas.  I'd give five stars, but have only had breakfast, so I expect I'll upgrade to five stars when I've been for lunch or dinner (which will be soon).",ZdUFyF5eNyZxete-T4bmZA,3,2,4,FAoCU_Z5X8XB6HdnMXjZPA

692001,2015-05-11,1,522GgMvOvzaKCEX6BfAtvg,"We picked this place for Mother's Day breakfast. The service was absolutely disappointing. The server (owner) took over 20 minuets to take our drink order. She brought my moms coffee first, another 10 minutes later my horchata arrived on a dirty mug with michelada mix on half of the rim. I showed the other server lady because the owner once again wasn't around for another 20 minutes. She assured me the mug was clean just rubbed up against another mug. She acted like it was no big deal and like I was being picky. She asked if I wanted another I didn't want to wait another 10 minutes for a drink so I said no. Finally the owner came back to take our order. My mom ordered menudo, I ordered chicken enchiladas. The food came fast (about 10 minutes) my enchiladas were horrible. They were made from chicken scraps including chicken skin and all dark meat not breast at all. Iv never had enchiladas made from anything other than breast, even taco shops use breast meat. I showed the owner, she said they use chicken legs and no skin even though I was holding a piece of skin almost to her face. She said if I wanted breast they had items on the menu with breast. My mother was done with her meal by then. When I told her I didn't want anything she pick up the plate and rolled her eyes and walked away. I would never pay $12 for two enchiladas made from chicken legs. Another 10 minutes went by and still no check. My mom had to go to the register and ask for the check. The whole time the restaurant only had 5 table, they weren't that busy.

We spend $19 for menudo, a coffee and a horchata, I didn't drink. In conclusion the whole experience was not good, I would never go again to this place for any reason and I don't recommend this restaurant, not even to my worst enemy. We were just trying to have Mother's Day breakfast and left still hungry and wasted our morning. 

In a few words...you should better try Roberto's, Pepe's tacos or Taco Bell, at least you won't be there for 2 hrs waiting on horrible food. That bad!!",rg4TXYvXlWKhFT7nbYZGOg,1,0,1,rbYUkVLCpjAF3IWGZTL4VQ
716133,2015-08-14,0,522GgMvOvzaKCEX6BfAtvg,The food here is to die for! It taste just like a mexican mommas cooking! Classic recipes that have been perfected from the sauces to the tortillas. My family and I enjoy coming here very often. The decor represents the Mexican culture so perfectly as it celebrates Mexicos history. The whole atmosphere in this place makes you feel at home and the employees as so so helpful and nice. I recommend the enchiladas de pollo!,xddHeCZT87qj5khqjPds4A,0,0,5,h_i4YS5akrabcUujUpKJfg

My mom brought us here the last time she visited,  I had a shrimp cocktail which was full of shrimp and avocado. This was the first time I had a michellada, now I am in love with this drink, I crave it. My husband had a shrimp and tilapia dish which he described as delicious!  So we have visited a few times since,  every dish we order tastes fresh and recently cooked. But by far my favorite is the molcajete dish with the shrimp, chicken, steak,  potatoes and a hot sauce, to die for, perfect for a cold day, along with some hand made tortillas.....yumm!

The appetizer salsa is wonderful. Great atmosphere with old Mexican historic photos and posters of Mexican film stars. The owner is so sweet, and perfectly attentive. They always have soccer playing on several screens when I am there, which I love. It's a home away from home for me. Highly recommended.

Mojarra Al Mojo De Ajo: A Whole Fried Tilapia sauteed in garlic  sauce and topped with more garlic sauce. Comes with beans, rice, salad green chile sauce and fresh handmade tortillas. 

 - The fish was fried perfrectly and tasted fresh from the sea, the garlic sauce was no joke (smothered with Garlic!) and extremely strong but I loved it, the green chile sauce was intensified with spices/heat but did not linger (Very nice!)
- Rice and Beans were typical and satisfying
- The Tortillas were Mesmerizing!! There is Absolutely No Comparison with store bought tortillas and their handmade tortillas served here.

Carne Asada Taco: Litlle diced meat, very soft, not much flavor but their red chile sauce, cliantro and onions, especially the handmade tortilla made it a success.

The Price was inexpensive for portion and taste, Place was decored surprisingly vibrant and server was helpful and kind. Would come here more often if it was closer!",mY3mROf28N-vY1fpR-FFUw,13,5,4,oTODasL2133FbpINAh0Ycw

4872913,2017-08-14,1,522GgMvOvzaKCEX6BfAtvg,"Finally! We travel to the East side of Las Vegas and boy did I have a hankering for something special, home style and humble. I remember a long time as a young teenager that after going to Broadacres swap meet we ended up finding a Tejuino vendor and if you don't know what this is, it's a flavorful punch in the mouth of a drink from Jalisco, Mexico. 

After falling in love with this drink for it's flavorful and tangy taste, I quickly  realized that ""Tejuino"" was not widely available among traditional Mexican restaurants that Toni and I visited. I was on a mission, something special maybe a sit down place, maybe something that could satisfy. I had to find it. 

When searching, even google had a hard time searching for anything besides odd street vendor listings, which is amazing because back in the day, street vendors didn't even know what GPS was let along reviews. But good on em' for at least being listed but this wasn't what I was looking. 

After calling my father to see if he remembered a restaurant or sit down spot, he quickly directed me to ""La Reyna"". I was skeptical because not only did he know of a restaurant that specializes in Jalisco style Tejuino, he beet out Google and even gave me an address. So Toni and I were in a mission, and into my Ford Focus we went.

Now, I need anyone reading this to look past the location because I was not familiar with it and when I found it, it was not in a spot that I felt gave this place any credit. You will find a Market, some small style shops and La Reina last from the L-shape shopping lineup. But it was a diamond in the rough...

Walking in, it was a completely different atmosphere. Walls were lined with authentic Mexican film memorabilia and classic Mexican posters. The tables were somewhat clean on the top but had some sticky touch on the crease of the walls and some on the drink specials. Toni also picked up a small smudge on her finger from under the table and we didn't know what it was, napkins at the table would have been a good idea specifically for this. The soccer game that day was playing on the TV loud enough to hear the announcers but low enough to enjoy a conversation from any seating place in the building. 

As always, I had to take a look at the restrooms just to see if this was all a mirage but clean in the men's, will have to assume for the women's bathroom, sorry. We sat on the booth seats together facing the TV and was quickly greeted by an older lady that reminded me of my own family and was quickly transported to my grandmother's house. 

I quickly asked if they served Tejuino and she said that majical word, ""Si, Como no?"". Toni not understanding the magic, she quickly ordered a Coke, she didn't know what we were into. Once we received the menu, most had names and pictures which is my favorite type. Everything looked delicious and a combination of what I would get at my mother's/grandmother's house celebrating a family get together. 

Toni chose her tried and true Chicken Fajitas and I ventured into unknown territory with the ""Mar I Tiera"" plate. Toni's chicken fajitas had a traditional plate of shredded lettus with dressing, authentic beans with crumbled ""queso fresco"" on top and some rice along with the delicious rotisery chicken and veggie slices. At one point, a fly was buzzing around and due to randomness, it fell into Toni's coke. The older lady quickly brought a replacement coke but I thought they could use an industrial fly catcher to fix that problem completely. Toni doesn't impress easily, but she chowed down on her plate and said it was really good, which to me is one of the higher compliments you could get out of Toni. 

Toni also had bits off of my plate which came with the same salad, beans, rice combo but with carne asada, sauteed shrimp and veggies. I am very picky about my rice and beans but the entire time I could only think about the dedication and time it takes to get large amounts of rice and beans exactly to the quality I received that day.

Of course, while there, I only saw the older lady, and heard no one else having conversations in the back around the kitchen. I didn't know if they had a cook or another employee but it felt as though it was just the older lady, Toni amd myself. We might have been there in a slow time, but this place was empty and for what I just had, it didn't reflect the crowd to quality ratio in my opinion. 

At the end of it all, I had two large mugs of Tejuino and as I was paying our bill which was fair for what we had, I ordered a Tejuino to go. Knowing that it was going to be a long time before I would be to the east side of Las Vegas and enjoy the restaurant again from La Reyna but I knew it was worth the trip for the awesome food we had.

If you want to try or get Tejuino and equally great authentic dishes from Mexico, I recommend La Reyna. The small things that were a negative to us were overshadowed by the quality of food you receive. Enjoy and tell them I sent you!",et7-6PTY_O4mlEqw94q5gg,2,2,4,cDbDETGageh9nf3nc6jjCA

I had a Chile relleno combination and the rice was overcook and the beans just didn't taste good.  My husband had a Molcajete and it was not bad.  One thing i didn't like is that we got there we ordered a Jamaica drink and we were told that it wasn'r ready so the waitress told us to try the lemonade that it was fresh made, so we ordered 2 and when she came back it wasn't lemonade, was a margarita mix very very sweet and we were charged $7.00 for it.
