I had the caprese salad and tiramisu gelato, sat at the bar since the tables were all full.  The caprese came with pine nuts, which was a nice twist.  I have a weakness for tiramisu and gelato, and their tiramisu gelato did not disappoint!  Excellent rum and espresso flavor with a swirl of cocoa powder.

This one hurts because it's been my favorite Italian restaurant on the strip for over 5 years, but it's not what it used to be.

Food- Ordered Rigatoni Bolognese and the Lasagna Pizza to share with my husband. The pasta was just ok, but it was cold. The meat sauce was hot, but the pasta was cold for some reason? This has never happened to me before unless it was actually a cold pasta dish...but shouldn't the pasta be hot or at least warm?? The Lasagna Pizza was pretty good, no complaints there, but all in all the food didn't make me want to come back. 

Service-Weak. All the other times I've been here the servers have been very attentive, and available in case we needed something. Our server was never around! We had to wait just to get some Parmesan cheese on our food, and I clearly remember servers doing this almost immediately after you've been served your meal. We finished our drinks, but our server was not around to ask if we wanted refills? The last straw was when we tried to pay the bill, he was no where to be found so we decided to use some good ol' cash instead of our credit card and save us another half hour of this terrible service.


Like I said, this used to be my go-to Italian restaurant on the strip...time to move on.",YzUlvX6xp-TsEd2CJOEwFw,1,0,2,k0WgDmiG1Uykmj0HCYT2Fg

We also had the caprese salad which was way overpriced for the portion we received.  The romano chicken salad was good but I would definately order it with the dressing on the side because it was drenched.

My first choice for that evening was Carmine Italian restaurant within the forum shops but the host guy told us in a very rude way that they were all booked for that evening, it was 3:15 pm when we stopped by, 90 percent of their restaurant was empty.

I am so happy we did because this has got to be the best pizza and tiramisu I have ever had. The atmosphere to start with was perfect. We sat right next to the fountain, the lighting is dim and the air is cool. I don't remember the last time I have felt so relaxed and comfortable at a restaurant. 
Anyway, what makes the pizza so superb is the way the crust is warm, thin, and crusty but still soft on the inside. This comes from the fact they make their pizzas in a brick fired oven. The toppings were also fresh and they use real cheese not imitation. Very filling pizza as well.
The tiramisu we decided to split three ways and it was perfect. The ladyfingers were soft but not soaked through with the coffee and the taste was just phenomenal.

We've ordered the lasagna and the chicken parm--both of which are fabulous.  I have also ordered their sald (Caesar) which is large enough to split among two people.  They give you large entrees and those too could easily be split.  It is easily one of the best Italian places I have been to in Las Vegas.

The only thing that is so-so is the bread...and really who cares much about that? I mean, bread should be good but it's not the deal breaker.  It just has too much herbs in it for my taste.

I'm only giving 3 stars for this review because it's really hard to impress with Italian; there are so many restaurants that cook tasty Italian food, you need to do a lot to stand out.   Visually, Trevi looks great.  It's located in the Forum Shops at Caesers Palace.  1/2 of the dining area is ""outside"" by a fountain, and the other 1/2 is inside.  We chose the inside seating because the outside area is very noisy due to the pedestrian traffic in the mall.  The inside seating is only a little quieter, so if you are looking for a more intimate setting, this might not be the place for you.  The server was attentive, maybe overly so, but it was a little slow when we were there, so I can appreciate the fact he was really working for his tips.  Food was good, as noted above.  I had the pappardelle with meat sauce and meatball, and enjoyed it.  Our total bill came out a little high for this type of food, but hey, it's Vegas, so it's expected.

351567,2008-09-10,0,SsN-SaGGkJn2Qm-jSDQ4aQ,"Time Out - shame on you! The trusty city guide Time Out gives Trevi a top write-up. And with literally 100's of Italian restaurants in Las Vegas from which to choose, why not believe them? Mistake.


 With outdoor temperatures running at about 38* C, it seemed like a good option to seek out the air-conditioned luxury of one of Vegas' top Malls to have lunch. Las Vegas, as you know, is fantasyville, a kitsch creation where the splendours of the World are brought to life in a never-ending series of cloned buildings, monuments and other landmarks. Trevi itself sits alongside a life-size reproduction of the Fontana di Trevi in Rome.


 The menu offered recognisable delights from Italy: Antipasto Misto, Fritto Misto, Risotto, Pizza, Liguine with clams, Scalloppine, Tiramisu, Sorbetti. And there the resemblance to Italian food finished. The proscuitto was pre-sliced - days ago, it seemed - and dull red instead of pink; the roasted vegetables had been pickled; olives were out of a jar. The pasta was dried and tasteless - industrial quality when for $25 a plate you'd have expected freshly made. Pasta had been dropped straight into its sauce, water and all, so that the sauce became a light water-based emulsion. Clams and prawns had definitely been frozen at some stage of their existence.


 I had a little word with the manager, Marcello. Good name, I thought, he'll sympathise with me. Marcello turned out to be Mexican, as were his chefs. That explained why the sous-chef who brought me my pasta and clams offered to sprinkle it with parmesan cheese! Marcello knocked 50% off the bill, but I'd rather have had decent food than a discount.


 Just as well the Mafia no longer run Vegas, because if they'd gone to Trevi they'd have blown it up.",g5KSG97oCB8qffDlwtacLA,0,0,1,WnHOWXb38WKaFCnGxHj7Fg

The service from our waiter was strange. Rufus, you were just weird.  His ""humor"" was insulting and really detracted from our experience.

Michelle was beyond incredible as our reception coordinator.  Trust me, I spoke with a few and it was unreal how well she listened and got together a package for exactly what I wanted.  She was ALWAYS quick to respond no matter how many emails she received from me and was the most pleasant, kind person I could have asked for when dealing with something stressful like wedding planning.  I unfortunately had people from 4 days to 4 hours before my wedding cancel and was fortunately able to have an employee get a hold of Michelle for me (it was on a Sunday so she wasn't scheduled to be in until my event) and she IMMEDIATELY called me back, jot down everything I said and ALL of the changes were made when I arrived exactly how I wanted them.  

The food was exceptional.  Our steaks were cooked PERFECTLY and everyone who had the chicken and pasta raved about it all.  You also can't go wrong with tiramisu  :)  

Everything was presented elegantly and it did not feel like a 'restaurant' atmosphere at all.  Michelle also thankfully was able to help place the favors and some of the décor for us on the day of the wedding as well. We had a DJ and our party was so much fun that the bride and bridesmaids from the quieter reception going on in the restaurant downstairs came running up to sing and dance with us LOL!  It was an amazing time and I will always be grateful to Michelle for all she did for me and for making it so easy when you don't know what to expect.

Service: Sunday night, had about a 10 minute wait for a beautiful table on the ""patio"" (will explain this in a bit) but we NEVER mind waiting at a nice bar. Everyone working this fine restaurant we encountered from the host, server and bar tender were superbly professional.

Drinks: My husband throughly enjoyed a ruby port and I had a fabulous gin drink. More than adequate wine selection which we each had a nice glass with dinner. Beautiful wine glasses topped off our experience only making it sweeter.

Atmosphere: Super chic, modern Italian sort of place without being stuffy. You feel fine here dressed up or in shorts but most folks around Cesar's dress it up a bit at night FYI. There is nothing overbearing or formal about Trevi so no worries.

Food: Cannot say just how much I enjoyed my marsala. Can NEVER get enough marsala and my husband a spicy penne dish - can't recall the name right off hand. What really makes these sort of dishes are the sauces and these were incredible, tasty, not too salty balace of savory with spice and Italian flare. Meals are served with warm fresh bread and a rosemary infused olive oil at the table so you don't have to wait for more to dredge your bread through.

""Patio"" Now this is the crown jewel. Browse the pictures and you'll see the lion share of the seating is ""outdoors"" which is really indoors but with the water fountain, the painted ceilings and the highly decieving lighting you will be completely fooled into thinking you are outside without the wind, the heavy Las Vegas side walk traffic loaded with stumbling drunks, etc. The atmosphere out there is just so peaceful and pleasant. I don't have adequate words.

We ordered cream of mushroom (yummy), calamari (ok), crab spinach & artichoke dip (yummy), salad (gigantic) and 3 of us ordered linguini di mare (huge proportion but bland in taste). Pricey lunch but hey you're in Vegas.

You can sit ""indoors"" at and around the bar area or ""outside"" on the patio next to the Atlantis water fountain...if water noise is soothing for you than definitely sit near the fountain. The fountain will also drown out a lot of the people noise since Trevi is located near a heavy activity hub in the forum shops.

We were attended to quickly and seated...took about 5 minutes for a waiter to show up for us even though there were only 5 tables of people for 3 waiters to handle.

When we were helped our waiter seemed not interested in his job and it took another 10 minutes to get water. We stuck it out and started out with an order of their made-in-house Polenta fries...never had them before and I'd have to say it would be hard to beat these...so good...

Our waiter got a lot better as our meal continued...maybe he had something or someone else giving him a rough time but since service got better I won't let it affect my rating.

My friend ordered the Caesar salad which, besides being a HUGE portion, was well presented and richly flavored. Fresh as could be. I went simple with a margarita pizza...one of the best brick oven fired pizzas I've had. Light, flavorful, and fresh. Everything was better than we expected,

While the service did improve I will say that the food far exceeded the service here. If you're not in a huge rush definitely stop here for good food and people watching.

You've got to get the homemade sorbetto...I don't know what it is but no matter where I've gone in Vegas...good service or bad...crap entrees or good...every dessert I've had has been off the charts good. Trevi follows suite...even with a plain sounding vanilla I was hooked.

Spend-o-meter: very reasonable for 2 people...we hit a little over 50 after tip.
Service: Got better after a really rough start...not counting that I'd say it was B service...count the bad service I'd give it a C/C-
Portions: Large on the salads...ideal on personal pizzas and desserts...
Food quality: A+
Will I go back: Yes...good views, awesome decor, and so much to try on the menu...I also think my bad service experience was a one-off issue based on many of the reviews already here.",sPymS_ZrwE7g7BNPs6Q-Cg,0,0,4,kG1ZpSWCouw8NfOVT2EjWg

The outdoor area didn't have enough A/C, so I wasn't as comfortable eating my food as I would have liked.   Plus there's always people walking by the forum shops and starring at you eating!  We started out with the calamari fritti and pizzeta trevi.  The fried calamari was excellent, lightly battered and deep fried to perfection!  It was served with this tomato caper sauce which tasted very good!  The pizzeta is like a flatbread; topped with some herbs and parmesan...it was light and tasted excellent!  The one VERY DISSAPOINTING thing was the free bread they served us, it was COLD & STALE bread!  Unacceptable for an Italian restaurant!  Minus 1 star for such horrible bread, honestly don't even serve bread if it's cold and stale, that's just terrible!   Plus they served it with olive oil, and no vinegar!  

Moving onto the entrees, I tried their special of the day fettuccini.  It was a fettuccini with pancetta, sweet peas, mushrooms, and sun-dried tomatoes in a cream sauce.   The dish was excellent!  It was heavy, rich, creamy, fattening, and loaded with flavor!  They definitely didn't skimp on the cream, butter, oil, or whatever base they used to make the sauce...maybe they used the fat from the pancetta to make the sauce...whatever it was, tasted excellent!  Probably the best fettuccini dish I have had yet!  Plus, the noodles where cooked al dente, just the way I like it.  The dish was a tad expensive at $32, I mean there really weren't any expensive ingredients used to make the dish, and the portion wasnt huge, but I would probably go back and order it again just because it was that good!  

I also tried a little of the chicken parmigiana, which was ok but nothing special.  The seafood linguini wasn't bad, the seafood was fresh and the lobster cream sauce wasn't bad.  The deep dish pizza was disappointing, they need to add more cheese to the pizza; there was way too much dough and tomato sauce!   The meat lasagna was ok, it could have been bigger.   The fazzoletto trevi tasted excellent!  Out of all the dishes, I liked the pasta dishes the most, so I am guessing those will all be good dishes.  The other dishes were ok, but I have had better.  

I thought he prices here are a tad high, I think it comes out to be around $30-35 a person if you share an appetizer or dessert.  The fried calamari is excellent! The pasta dishes were cooked perfect, but they could work on a few of their meat entrees and pizzas.  The place was packed on a Saturday night, reservations are definitely required!  I would also recommend sitting in the indoors area versus the patio, because there isn't enough A/C in the patio, and who wants a bunch of bystanders walking around and starring at your food while you eat! This restaurant would have deserved a 4 star if they didn't serve cold and stale bread to us, that's minus 1 star!",qnF-Fo5VDP5Tp2PxFsBNkQ,0,0,3,yEFwpP_YS9LuTjsfGBWk1A

Trevi is situated in the the Forum Shops with majority of its seating in the mall. The inside of the restaurant is very nice and comfortable with its high ceilings, open kitchen and dark colors. Sitting in the restaurant rather than the patio is highly recommended. The dinning room keeps all the mall noise out and it feels more like a restaurant rather than apart of a mall food court. 

The service was great at first with prompt delivery of menus, drinks, bread and appetizers. After the appetizers were served service became nonexistent. After receiving the bill, it turned out that the gratuity was already added. It was then obvious as to why our server began focusing his efforts on smaller tables...weather he sucked or not he was still getting his tip. 

The food was not great or bad...it was just something to cure your hunger. We started out with the bread that they serve to each table and it really served no purpose but to fill your stomach with its complete lack of flavor. For appetizer we shared a couple of pizzas that were the best part of the meal. Despite the canned tomatoes on the margarita pizza they were very good. For dinner I ordered the bolognese pasta. The pasta was cooked perfectly but the taste reminded me of Olive Garden. We all shared dessert. The Tiramisu, the hot molten chocolate cake and the ice cream were the highlight of the meal, with the chocolate cake being the best of the three.

Literally had management going over to the table and multiple waiters to greet ""this guy"". Well, I had never seen him before, and don't you go to places like this, and pay prices like this, so you get that same kind of service?

The meal was prepaid (tip included), so I wouldn't have been surprised to get subpar service. But that was far from the case. Our server, David, was friendly and attentive, and the meal was also better than I expected. We each had the Trevi salad, which had mixed greens, mozzarella, and a bevy of chopped vegetables, including hearts of palm. A great start to the meal! We had three options for our entrees, and we selected the chicken fettucine and the pappardelle bolognese to share. On paper, the fettucine sounded better (there were peas and proscuitto along with chicken), and it was good enough. But the pappardelle was great! Really tasty meat sauce and perfectly prepared pasta. For dessert, we split the sorbet (raspberry and lemon) and gelato (chocolate and vanilla). These were BIG portions! And while the sorbets were fine, we both really enjoyed the gelati (I preferred the chocolate, and my husband loved the vanilla). 

We ""upgraded"" the meal by buying a bottle of wine (an Oregon pinot gris), and I had a shot of limoncello after dinner to celebrate my birthday. Prices for both were really reasonable ($35 for the wine and $8 for the shot), especially considering that the menu prices for our entrees were $24 a plate. Good thing we got that deal through Vegas.com! 

Trevi is located next to a big fountain, so it's a little loud when you're sitting outside (like we were). But it's a great place to people watch, and if you don't mind paying Strip prices for pasta, it's a fine place to eat--especially as part of a package deal with Absinthe! (Seriously, check it out.

The tiramisu and calamari was good, the ""imported Italian pasta"" was terrible. Shrimp was Horribly over-cooked, and shouldn't be called a special at all. Definitely not worth 30 bucks. Pork osso buco was not good either, it wasn't tender at all! and lacked flavor. However, the risotto portion of the dish made up for the rest thankfully.

My friend ordered the linguine vongole ($25, linguine with steamed clams) and was very unhappy with it. She said it had no flavor and was not worth the price. Perhaps sticking with simple dishes and keeping your standards low is the best strategy at this restaurant.

The service was fine. Nothing special, but not sub-par either. For the price, convenience, and people watching, this restaurant suited my needs. 

In response to an earlier review, I had a drink in hand coming into the restaurant and the hostess said nothing about it.

They couldn't find my OpenTable reservation when we checked in and then it took about 15 minutes to be greeted after we were sat at this awkwardly placed table that was too close to another table and right next to the bar and main traffic paths. When our server came over, there was no apology for the delay - just, ""can I get you something to drink..."" Very unfriendly. I started with some coffee (which looked like tea water...) and my husband had a cocktail (which actually came really quickly).
We ordered the bacon wrapped chicken meatballs & fried zucchini strips to start. Everything came out really fast, which was nice, but the chicken was dry and un-seasoned. The zucchini was good, but came with this measly side of marinara that wouldn't have lasted for a fourth of the dish. We asked for another side from the expo who brought the apps, but that never came. Then asked the waiter, who did bring one. That one didn't last that long either, so we asked for another and chatted with the waiter about how the portion of marinara to zucchini was not right. He agreed, then said he had a larger side container...but it didn't matter by then. 
We split the seabass for an entree. It was plated well; the parsnip puree & crispy brussell sprouts were super tasty. Adding in sliced green apples was a unique twist, but the seabass itself was under cooked and hard. By this time, we just wanted to get on our way. We mentioned it to our server to let the kitchen know. He offered to re-make it, but we weren't interested in that. So he gave us a free dessert of choice (thus the ""make up"" for service and two stars). We had vanilla & pistachio gelati which was tasty and went on our way.

The food is good. It's not the out of the world best food you're ever going to eat but I've always found my meal tasty. I think my husband and I split a pizza the last time we were here. It was top notch. 

What I like best about Trevi is the atmosphere. It's located right next to a big Neptune statue in a little pool and there's lights and it's just pretty. The people watching is excellent. Watching all types of interesting people wander around the shops is quite amusing. You really never know what you'll see.",0XXfN5vMCBB-582CTiD5OQ,0,0,5,mwt3f9YkO4Q5rLzsFAd2fQ

We had 58 people at our dinner and we had the entire upstairs (mezzanine) to ourselves.  When you walked up the stairs you came upon the seating chart and guest book as well as the bar and some highboy tables for the cocktail hour which lasted about 45 minutes.  It gave everyone time to walk around, take pictures with the fountain out front, chit-chat with people and find their seats.  We had 4 round tables and 3 rectangular tables (1 being the head table) and they were placed by the windows and around the side.  The décor and everything was setup perfectly and the best part was I didn't have to do any of it!

They had 3 dinner menu choices and we went with the Veneto.  The shrimp cocktail and bruschetta appetizer were amazing; my bridesmaid ate all of the shrimp cocktail from the head table!  The salads were nicely proportioned and dressed, but the entrees...WOW.  I had the Linguine Al Frutti Di Mare (A seafood medley of lobster, shrimp, scallops, tomatoes and scallions in a seafood cream sauce) it was absolutely delicious.  I ate as much as I could and wished I could have eaten more.  We also went with the cheesecake for dessert because neither my husband nor I are big cake eaters and we love cheesecake, so it was perfect.  As for beverages, we had an open bar, but some of our guests wanted shots, which were not included.  They made it very easy for them to open a side tab and kept track of everything.  The servers were fantastic, they were great with drinks and the timing of food was perfect.

The best part about Trevi, other than the food, was the service before, during and after the event.  We only went there once and that was to view and choose the venue, otherwise we did all the planning from home in Phoenix, Arizona.  Michelle made it so easy and she was great with responding to emails and questions.  They let us use their easel for our posterboard seating chart and my parents were able to go the day before to take all the centerpieces and décor over for setup.  Overall, we could not have been happier with our choice and I will recommend Trevi to everyone getting married in Las Vegas.",tRrtJ4I7IvPamLsSFoxa9Q,0,0,5,nZ9FFewx1f_iL5v16IOwHA

Several people asked how we were and if we needed anything.  

They had lunch special running that consisted of choosing a soup/salad and entree for $20.  So hubby and I both had the Caesar salad and he ordered the Pappardelle Bolognese and I ordered the Chicken Parm.  Of course we shared the entrees.  Both were really good.  The chicken was breaded nicely and was really juicy.  I didn't care too much for the marinara that topped it, but it wasn't horrible, just a little thin.  The Bolognese was AWESOME.  The dish came with a meatball on the side that was pretty tasty.  It wasn't as good as Rao's, but definately worth trying.

We were in the mood for some Italian so it was either Spagos or Trevi.  We walked past spagos and didn't feel like mingling with a bunch of senior citizens so we decided to roll with Trevi.

Took about 20 minutes to get us seated.  Tip...you want to be around in case they call your name before your approximate time.  They move through the list pretty quickly.  Two calls then onto the next.

We like to order something very basic when we go to a new restaurant.  If they cannot get the basic menu items down, we really don't have an interest in returning.  So we ordered the Calamari for app.  I ordered the spaghetti with meatballs and my wife ordered the chopped Italian Salad.  The calamari was a little on the bready side and the sauce was ok.  Nothing extraordinary.  The spaghetti was ok as well.  I can't say it tasted horrible.  But there's nothing really special about it.  My wife liked her chopped salad.

At the end of the day, we spent approx $70 for food that is worth about $30. So the food is 3 star worthy, but the price knocked it down a star. I guess they have to find a way to pay the lease at Caesars!",ACZauHUxS5MXq7_RTDDppQ,0,0,2,ylSuLtzPzRw8mNml9HjnZg

Dear Brandon,
I was a patron on Saturday February 15 at approximately 10:30 PM at your Trevi restaurant. I wanted to advise you of some good and not so good observations that I feel I should bring to your attention. 
Our waiter Joey was excellent. He was prompt and catered to my party of 8 with great care and hospitality. 

Contrarily, I observed one of the kitchen staff place an order of chicken Ceaser salad  on the table in a not so flattering way. Best description is that it was just tossed on the table without a care. Sorry, I had no name to provide only that he and another colleague were amused at the action. 
Also I and another in my party ordered one of the specials. Swordfish. It was cold and Joey immediately retuned it to the kitchen for a quick microwave. Still I was disappointed that it arrived in that state.

The portions were great also and the staff is A rated in my book. 

It's deep in the Forum Shops so it may be a little walking, check the map before you willy nilly walk around to get there cause you might be walking the wrong way or on the wrong floor. 

They also have a selection of italian sodas and such that (for the price) are pretty good.

1901169,2015-08-28,0,SsN-SaGGkJn2Qm-jSDQ4aQ,"We came to Trevi last night for a birthday dinner in a party of 13.  I will take the blame for dining with a party of 13 in Vegas for dinner (a bad idea in general, I'm learning).  The fountain at the restaurant is really nice and we sat right under it.  The restaurant was about half full.  Great ambiance for dinner.  We sat and ordered drinks.  30 minutes later, after asking about them, they arrived.  My wife's chardonnay had lipstick from the previous user on the glass, so I asked for a new glass and 20 minutes later, we had a new glass!  We ordered a caesar salad to split (we were in Caesar's Palace, so it has to be good, right?), my wife got the short rib and I got the salmon (both $28).  The salad came out quickly, but quite a bit of the lettuce had been frozen, so it was brownish and soggy.  The dressing wasn't bad and after seeing a show earlier we were near starving...so, we ate it.  The table bread wasn't anything to write home about, but decent.

About twenty-five minutes after ordering, the waiter came back to ""talk to the people who ordered salmon.""  Uh oh.  The Italian restaurant was out of risotto (red flag), so he wanted to know what side we wanted instead.  I took his recommendation at Alfredo noodles.  
The dishes took an hour to come out from ordering to serving.  About half of the dishes were warm/hot, the other half were cold.  Stone cold.  The salmon was dry and chewy.  So, right...don't go out with 13 people and you might get a warm dish.  The Alfredo was not quite as good as the boxed stuff you can get at the store.  Although the dish came with asparagus, they didn't give me asparagus with the Alfredo, so I asked for it.  Thirty minutes later, when I was done eating, the waiter told me it would be right out. I told him not to worry about it, but he brought it out and asked if anybody else at the table wanted the ""free asparagus"".  My wife's short rib looked good, but it was also cold.  In a normal circumstance, it makes sense to send back cold food that isn't up to a $28/plate standard.  But, by this time it was 10:30 and the hangover was starting to creep in with no food to counteract a day of ""activity"".  Note: the branzino was the best dish at the table by far.  I can imagine this place being a good experience for two people who knew what to order and had 2 hours to kill under the fountain.

To the waiter's credit, he was very sincere and wanted to do a good job.  He apologized several times, but it was clear he had too many tables and his kitchen staff sucks really, really bad.  He had his manager come over and it quickly became apparent why the restaurant was missing the mark.  She was defensive and told us that she had a horrible week trying to train a new staff with a new menu and that she was trying to manage the restaurant.  She offered us another round of drinks on the house, but at 10:50 PM with little food in us, it would have gotten ugly.  When I went to the restroom (passing the kitchen), the kitchen staff was clearly irritated that they were still working and I got a glare from a couple of them.  Sorry to burden you, guys!  

So, why not 1 star?  Well, the waiter comped $300 off the bill.  That is a lot to comp and it was appreciated.  In my opinion, if Trevi doesn't get their stuff together, they are going to have a tough time making it before somebody who knows how to run a Vegas restaurant comes along.",OEEPi7E6e6GzyzJXtGd7Fg,0,0,2,gRlEv29ndT89gjF3_hItYQ

One tiny thing, drinks were priced around $10-$15 but if you get a double shot, price is also double! My friend paid $30 for a glass of double long island iced tea!

Our food was heavily salted. Swore my blood pressure went up 20 points from the sodium. My tomato basil soup was so salty I couldn't finish and Hubby agreed. His minestrone was better.

Cost: 4. When I'm Vegas, I have a tendency to ignore menu prices altogether and I hope most of you end up doing the same. However, Trevi actually offers a surprisingly good menu for the price especially by Las Vegas standards.

Food Quality: 3. Tempted to give a four, but nothing blew us away enough to truly justify that.  Solid highlights include Chicken Cannelloni and Chicken Limone. Chicken Limone was supposedly ""best thing on the menu"" according to waitress, and good no doubt, but nothing to salivate over.

Service: 3. Waitress spotty, plus it took Trevi 10-15 minutes just to come to our table after we sat down --  other than that no huge complaints.

When to return: A quick bite when shopping at forum shops, in a hurry before a show or flight, no reservations place to eat on a Thur/Fri/Sat night.

Trevi occupies the old haunt of Bertolini's in Caesar's Palace. We loved Bertolini's and we had high hopes. We found that the menu offered the right amount of options and that the prices were extremely appropriate for the quality and portion size.

The waiter suggested the house risotto (featuring Gorgonzola, roasted garlic and pine nuts). It was outstanding. The texture was perfect and the flavors were melded in total harmony. It was certainly a worthy recommendation.

The shrimp scampi was another recommendation that was a home run. The shrimp were tender and filled with garlicy goodness. It is easy to overcook scampi and this dish was not. It was a great example of technique and knowledge by the chef.

The wine list offer something for every course and every wallet. We had a Malbec that was the greatest complement to our dishes.

All said and done, we walked away with satisfied tasted buds and satiated appetites. We will definitely keep Trevi in our Vegas rotation.",QFt2UseFdbkrmQYxLQrqlw,0,0,4,42GdXvVf3Psn3UpxO5xuZA

Trevi is located in the middle of the Forum Shops attached to Caesar's Palace. It's a mostly ""outside"" restaurant on the piazza near a replica of the Trevi fountain.

My friend and I put our names in. It only took about 15 minutes on a Friday night. The host sat us at a two top near a pillar. It was so awkward and we were right where the servers were setting up all their trays of food. It was awful. We were moved to another table which was much better.

Our server was good though he disappeared for a long time at once point. Towards the end of the meal the service was great so he must have been busy.

My friend, Jeffrey B., ordered the minestrone. I tried it and it was excellent. He also got the eggplant parmasean. He said it was good but the portion was oddly small. I order the lasagna pizza. It was a huge deep dish pizza with layers of cheese and sausage and sauce. It was delicious and I didn't even eat half. The bread and oil was also very good. For dessert we got the Spaghetti Ice which was ice cream made to look like spaghetti and meatballs with strawberry sauce. It was really good.

Overall, this was a good meal. The atmosphere was wonderful. I would get the pizza lasagna again but just split it with someone.",EbbOIQ5oAamS9D_B_7cC7w,0,0,4,0u4i3-WuT4jZ-wLx-bWsFA

2-6 pm and in the bar area only you can really get your drink on. Now, the martinis weren't great but I didn't think they were terrible either. There was a lot of booze which helps matters. Still, I think next time I will stick with beer.

I really did like the bar area - it's dark and set back a little from The Shops so you can have an intimate conversation or just hang out inside away from the heat. Of course, the ""outdoor"" dining area is way cool because you can see the sky change from night to day and back again. But, HH isn't offered in that seating area.

We had a fairly attentive frat-boyish server who was personable. He seemed a bit oblivious at times but he still got our drinks out to us with the quickness.

We went on a Friday night around 7:30 and the service was impressively quick (even with a nearly full house). Our waiter did their job but was unengaging and mainly played the role of an order taker. They weren't rude in any way, but this slightly took away from the experience.

For starters, we had the bacon wrapped chicken meatballs, which come on a platter of 3. My expectations were high, but the  flavor underwhelmed (the bacon was hardly noticeable). The food got better from there. The spaghetti and meatballs was great and the sauce had both a zesty and sweet component. The sausage and pepper pizza was satisfying but could have used a little more of a kick.

The service up to this point was pretty good, and we had great time chatting and noshing and drinking.

The bill came (it was $60 something) and the four of us each threw down a $20 and a few bucks so there was close to $90 to cover our bill plus tip.

We proceeded to walk away and as we were trying to decide which direction we should go, the server comes running after us telling us that we were trying to stiff him!  Huh?

Looking at the price I expected this to be fine dinning, however what we experience was nothing short of a complete joke on us! My wife ordered the Chicken Piccata, and I ordered their best dish the Linguine Fruitti Di Mare. Both of these dish were also their most expensive so we thought this was going to be something great. 

Our server was horrible as she never smile or even said what her name was. This turned out to be a series of neglect and just bad service. Had to ask her three times to get a lemon for my water. Brought us bread and pour a little olive oil into the dish and started to walk away. Thus had to ask for some vinegar which she finally got from another table after the third request. Then we had to ask for a napkin and silverware as we did not have any on the table. 

By this time we had to inform the manager that our server may be overworked or too much for her to handle. The manager apologized however the service only got worst. We had to ask for refill of our coffee each time. You would think this is so basic customer service to keep the coffee cup full especially since the cups were clear glass. 

To top it off our Not so great server managed to drop a beer bottle on an empty chair at our table which got beer on my wife new shoes. The manager later came over and said that the server had told him what had just happened. He tried to apologize and only made a joke that lucky it wasn't wine. He did offer a desert, but we didn't want to take any chance for another disaster! 

Well we finally got the bill and noticed that there was no comp or discount. Actually when the server brought me my change back she said that they round off my bill so I guess I did get a price reduction of eight cents! Despite all this and wanting to leave a penny tip I decide not to lower myself and instead of giving my usual 20+% for gratuity I gave around 17% so I could still feel good that I could say that I still gave a fair tip since my mother was a server for many years of hard work.

We were seated, and then told by the bartender (who clearly was unhappy to be at work) that we needed to wait five minutes before ordering, or she would charge regular price - again, it just seemed odd.  Among our group, we ordered the frozen Bellini (way too sweet, not good at all), the Trevetini (awful, cloyingly sweet and had an artificial taste), a lemon martini (ok, but VERY sweet),  beer (in bottles, hard to mess up), and some mixed drinks (very little alcohol, but ok).

We ordered one of each of the happy hour ""bites,"" I think.  They were mostly ok, but tasted like they were frozen and then heated up.  The calamari was pretty good, but the sauce it was served with was stone-cold (possibly intentional?).  The meatballs were pretty good, as well; they tasted like grocery-store quality frozen meatballs.  The stuffed mushrooms were decent, but oily.  The chicken sliders were not good - tough chicken with oily breading, awful.   

Then, when a second bartender asked if we wanted anything else and we had replied ""No, thanks,"" she seriously threw the bill at us (it had been folded in a glass in front of us) and stomped off.  It wasn't crowded, there wasn't anyone waiting for our seats, and we still had drinks which were half full in front of us.  Very odd. 

Overall, the food was adequate but the service was appalling.  We laughed it off at the time, but now I wish I had asked for a manager - it was truly awful service.",WCCTAN6Ws1t4CrMlFWS17g,0,0,2,gkE4qVyjnB-1HMn7V6gfZA

Situated inside the Caesar's Palace Forum Shops in vivaaaaaa Las Vegas, Trevi's gelato was a welcome surprise and discovery.  At first you might not notice it hidden around to the corner of the main restaurant, but the gelato here is molto squisito!  That's Italian for: holy crap this is yummers!!

It's so good, every time I come to Vegas now, I absolutely must stop by this place each trip to grab a generous helping of their very excellent tiramisu gelato.  I highly recommend it.  Real pieces of ladyfingers and just the right amount of rum soaked in - It's the most authentic tiramisu-flavored dessert that I've tried that isn't the real deal.  Of course there's other flavors to choose from but I'm a sucker for all things tiramisu so if they can make it this good, the rest has to be pretty good.  Actually, my friends tried other flavors and they agreed it's very good without having to resort to go to Italy.

Came here because it looked appealing since it was situated in the central forum shops. Was on my ""don't come back here"" list of Vegas dining spots. 

The lasagna was not good because it tasted like a 2-layer lasagna with pasta and beef. I want to enjoy the essence of a layered lasagna where I feel like I am biting into different flavors. I couldn't tell if I was eating cheese or lasagna noodles. 

The ossobuco risotto was on the bottom of my risotto list. There was no creamy consistency in the rice nor was it al dente--too much bite left. Now I don't know if it was a bad night in the kitchen or what, but I did not enjoy my risotto whatsoever.

Their food is not that good, and I had way better drinks for free at the casino. $12 for a drink that tastes like crap (excuse my language). We tried their signature Bellini and strawberry lime or something like this. They just cut 1 strawberry and threw it into a cheap mix you buy $3.99 for a bottle. Belllini was ok if it cost $6 at the beach bar. They did not even try to create something decent. I paid $15 at Il Mulino for a drink and it was heavenly. 3 dollars less and what a difference. No, I absolutely do not try to compare this eatery to Il Mulino, but when you charge $12 I expect something better.
My brucheta was soggy, eggplant cooked in some greasy oil. Do not even start me on the quality of their coffee.

I do not really understand how it is possible to give 5 stars to this restaurant unless all other 4 stars go towards the view of the fountains.

They also were not very accommodating when my relatives asked to split one of their soups. They took the order, but brought one bowl with a soup. The waitress told that they did not split it because it would ruin a presentation. What presentation? There was mess of a soup in that bowl without anything added. She brought an extra plate so we split it ourselves.

They also brought us butter which I did not try but some girls mentioned that it was ice cold. Then we had some shareable apps. I really liked the butternut squash ravioli. It was sweet and savory at the same time. We also ordered bruschetta which was different. It looks more like bread with 3 different dips. The mozzarella app was just ok as well. It came with marinara sauce on top which I liked but just tasted like mozzarella sticks. The highlight of my dish was the Linguine Ai Frutti Di Mare. I wish I saved a pic so I could post it. I told them I was sharing with a friend and they were so nice to split it in the back because we were not exactly sitting next to each other. The half portion was perfect for me and they were not at all stingy with the seafood. This is one of their signature dishes and I would definitely recommend it. Service was on point.

It seemed a good choice as it was fairly reasonably priced with some lighter options - salads, pizzas, soups, appetizers.  The food is definitely not cheap but it was not outrageous, either, especially in comparison with some of the other options at Caesar's.

I opted for the Tuscan Tuna Salad.  It was a very good salad and completely hit the spot (I was searching for something light after eating a pretty large but pretty early breakfast, and drinking a Fat Tuesday drink).  The salad was large with fresh ingredients and a nice flavor.  The tuna added the protein to satisfy me and hold me until a later dinner.  

The service was very prompt and friendly, and the setting inside the Forum is pleasant.  There is a fountain nearby and you can watch people while you're eating.  I didn't try too many things here but, based on what I did try, I would be likely to return if I was in the area and looking for a good bit to eat.",tIP5tmJzK2jFKJh6lE-_Ag,3,2,4,TuZEk5gjk-86rzM4lbglWg

The waiters get better looking the closer you get to the weekend, the specials a little more glamorous, and the alcohol a little tastier. 

We went two nights in a row, and the first night ordered so much food I actually had leftovers. The pizza I ordered was good but not great, but the bruschetta we ordered as an appie was outstanding. The bread was perfectly soaked with the juices of the tomato and the olive oil, and there was a lovely little palette cleansing salad to wash it down with. The only interesting part for me was discovering the mushrooms in the tomato mix... Seriously, fungi? Never have I had that in bruschetta before. Whatev. 

Last night, the waiter forgot to bring us our palenta fries, and when I asked him to take them off our bill and not bring them, he comped them, but brought them out as a bonus. See? Wasn't that nice? In Vegas, everyone's a winner!",Tvk5HuAzmYDJPN9d6fBiiA,0,0,4,keXVeF1uR3z1z-ZLPS4wsA

The waiters were understaffed, did not bring us our drinks or silverware promptly, and simply forgot about things we asked for. The starting salad looked like chopped lettuce from a bag thrown onto a plate. The entree I ordered was a steak fiorentina, medium rare. It was served to me pretty much medium well, with the heavy pesto sauce on top of the pre-sliced steak instead of under it, making the presentation fairly lackluster. Finally, the cheesecake dessert was a teeny tiny portion but was probably the best part of the meal in terms of taste.

My bf and I shared a deep dish pizza: http://s3-media1.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/VPQKFfHwue8TUySxCPmKxQ/l.jpg. It was sooo tasty, with gooey mozzarella, crunchy flavorful crust, and yummy tomato sauce. My bf, who is from Chicago, LOVED it (as did I).

I also downed two refreshing blended cocktail drinks--the peach bellini (http://s3-media2.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/2oiwvXG81qbop3f4tYu1yg/l.jpg) and some sort of tropical drink (http://s3-media1.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/MOgntoG7R3myTEUEzj58RQ/l.jpg). Kim F., my bf, and I all agreed that these were phenomenal--you could taste the distinct and delicate flavor of peach in the peach bellini, and the tropical drink tasted like fresh mangoes. My goal is to find drinks like that in the OC area. However, I am suspicious about the amount of alcohol these drinks contain. They taste pretty much non-alcoholic, and I was not even buzzed after finishing off two in about 30 minutes.

I ordered their chicken meatball soup and their mixed green salad. I wanted some mozzarella cheese on it and the server said no problem. 

The chicken meatball soup was very hearty and fresh. Sadly, there was only one chicken meatball. I didn't think it'd be that huge either. My salad was fresh too. The mozzarella smelled a little but I thought it could just be the brand of the buffalo mozzarella. I only had 1/4 of a small tomato in my salad. 

Why did I mention the 1/4 of the tomato? Well, you see my bill came out to be $30 (rounded up, tip not included). For a side salad and soup!? The salad was $7.95 and they charged me $5 for 3 pieces of cheese AND $2 for the tomato. I never requested for tomato...and if you're going to charge me put the whole damn tomato not 1/4 of it (or at least  half of it...). I love this place but that was way too much for a soup and salad, even for Vegas. If my bill was max $25 with tip included I think it would've been more reasonable.

Went on a Monday night for dinner.

What!?! =( Even our waiter was like ""yeah it was a really good dip too."" Okay now...if it was really good, why did the chef remove it!? Boo. Not good.

So we settled on a different appetizer instead. We got the POLPETTI DI GRANCHIO-crispy crab and pasta balls with marinara-like dipping sauce. This was delicious! I tasted more crab than pasta. It looks like the pasta was little macaroni so it wasn't too noticeable. It was so good I forgot to take a pic of this.

We also got a Caesar salad and pepperoni pizza to share. The pizza was delicious....thin crust with some basil added which was a plus. Almost a perfect rating but the pizza was on the smaller side. Even with the two of us, and we're light eaters too, we were able to completely finish it. Plate completely empty. We each had 4 slices but they were very small.

I was in a group of 12 people last night, and it was one misstep after another.. We arrived early but were seated at our appropriate time..the server seemed to be on his game, until after we got our menus.  The process of ordering your drinks, then appetizers, and the main course took over 30 minutes.. 

So after we placed our order, I noticed that other parties that arrived more than 40 minutes after us, were already eating their main course.. We didn't receive our meal until over an hour of being there... The funniest thing! Although the tables outside were relatively full.. the inside tables were were sparse.. I believe I counted 6 tables were occupied. 

Oh, and my colleague ordered a customized drink.. And after he dropped everyone's drink, and left to attend to other tables.. My colleague was getting up to go to the bar 15 min later to ask if they were going to customize the drink.. And he said.. Oh yah, let me see if they can do that.. Unacceptable.

My water glass was empty for what seemed forever. He finally noticed 15 minutes after it was empty, but it didn't get filled for 20 minutes after that. 

Again, love the food, but if you're hungry.. And you're ever running on a schedule, this wouldn't be my choice place to go.. 

Our bill came out to an average of $74 per person when we divided it out.. Included the meal tax and gratuity.  We had wine and cocktails.. Appetizers and our meals - no dessert because we thought it would only add on to our time there..

We were originally planning on eating at the M Buffet, but we arrived in Vegas a couple hours late, so we were no longer able to fit it in our schedule.  We were staying at Forum Towers at Caesars, so we decided eat somewhere close.  I'm glad that we decided to do so, otherwise we may never have given this place a try.

First off, the prices are a bit high.  So it's definitely not somewhere to go if you're looking to save some money.  But it's also not so high that your wallet will want to punch you in the mouth.  But it's Vegas, so you should expect to spend a bit more money than you would at home.

I don't know if I've ever spent ~$20 on Fettucini Alfredo before coming to Trevi, but the pasta was damn good!  So I definitely came away satisfied.  My wife got the stuffed eggplant, and we shared the crab, spinach & artichoke dip.  We enjoyed everything.  The cheese was amazing on the stuffed eggplant, so I think I'm going to try their lasagna next time.

The ambience was also really great.  We sat near the fountain which was really cool, and we were able to people watch.

Neither my friend or I could get to the bottom of our endless pasta!  At some point, I gave up and just started digging around with my fork for lobster and seafood bits.  I found many.  

The bartender was extremely friendly and the service was normal speed for a Sunday afternoon in Vegas (ie, kind of slow since everyone is trying to cure their hangover by eating).

The bar area lends itself well to meeting fellow travelers and discussing potential meal options and day plans.  The people we were seated next to had a way with words and told us some stories about Italy, getting into restaurants barefoot, and track n' field.

They serve pasta and pizza. The food looked delicious as we walked in and sat at the bar. There were four of us and three ordered off the house drink specialty menu. But not me....lol. I had to have an Old Fashioned with Makers Mark....it was very good to a point of being strong. Everybody loved their drinks.

We got some appts and the real stand out was the calimari.  It was so flavorful and tender. It was mostly the rings with some small while squids. It was really fresh and could have munched on it all night.

They also have a gelato bar, it looked really good. So if your sweet tooth is acting up they have great desserts.",Ekvs3lush6x2p8shD3xnOQ,16,18,5,iLDr9Y7--MT-ZUE_P6-HRw

    My friend ordered a tossed green salad $10 add chicken $7. When it arrived it was iceberg lettuce. It looked like it was trying to be an Olive Garden salad but was lacking flavor. The lettuce didn't look that appetizing and we were starving. She also ordered a glass of wine and it was so weak, that even on an empty stomach she never even felt the alcohol.

I had a few of their appetizers as well. Their stuffed mushrooms had very good flavor but they were too small. I had one of their beef sliders and it was good enough to keep me from buying a burger later.

3298979,2018-01-12,0,SsN-SaGGkJn2Qm-jSDQ4aQ,"This updated review pertains only to JOHN, the Trevi General Manager. He absolutely redeemed Trevi of their previous poor customer service experience that I reviewed from Dec.28, 2017.

I appreciate him very much for taking the time to call me personally on my cell, in the middle of his busy day, which I know is non stop in his restaurant. After he read the review of our less than stellar dining experience, he profusely expressed his regret about the incident and apologized. He acknowledged that it should have never happened in the first place, because they  pride themselves in providing first class customer service. Which is absolutely true. Caesar's and Paris and Bally's and Rio, basically the majority of Caesars entertainment properties I've been to on the Vegas strip, always live up to their elevated customer service reputation. 

John expressed his understanding of my dissatisfaction, and invited me to give them another try next time I am in Vegas, and went as far as to advise me to contact him prior to that visit to make sure all goes smoothly. I don't always do second chances, however I valued John immensely for reaching out, understanding, and not dismissing my complaint. Sometimes all we want is just that, validation that our voice is heard, our opinion counts, and our business is appreciated. For that reason,  next time I'm in Vegas in a couple months, I will definitely give Trevi another shot. Even though I may do it ""mystery shopper"" style, so I get a realistic feel for how their service will live up to our expectations that time. 

THANK YOU JOHN!!!",-v21yktIGgm4O2CHMk8e7g,1,0,5,M28ulEvCSl_j9rTwocQ-Ug

Unfortunately this time I can only give them two stars and that is simply for the service.  The food was very disappointing  we decided to do the price fix menu they offer with show tickets  I was sceptical but since I had eaten there before I felt it was a good deal.  Not at all.  First I had the ceasers salad  my better half had the trevi.  The dressing was tasty but my salad was just drenched and soggy.  His salad was just OK.  Then the pasta came I ordered the chicken carbanara and he ordered the marinara with meatball  they were both so tasteless .  A carbanara should be rich and creamy and you normally take half home  it literally tasted like someone just poured cream over fettuccine.  No thickness or garlic  I literally left half for them to throw out.  The marinara tasted like cheap jar sauce and they only gave him one meatball versus the two you see in the pictures and it tasted more like breadcrumbs.  We took our dessert to go as we were headed for our show.  Incredibly disappointed.  If you are going to offer a price fix menu make sure the quality equals your standard.

The service was fantastic from greeting to goodbye. Our waiter was attentive yet left is alone enough for us to enjoy a great family meal.

The calamari appetizer was among the best squid I ever did.

Blake, the main server, and the trainee, had greeted me within a few minutes, went over the menu and took my drink order.

Delicious - really like the croutons.  BTW... the bread is dangerous - excellent.

Few minutes later, the main entree was delivered.  Overall, it was very good.  The skin was very crispy.  The only small complaint was, the chicken was a little dry. Unfortunately, I did not save room for dessert.

Funny - my table said it was the better dish of the other two bad dishes we ordered. Two others ordered the Chicken Parmesan, but were not fans of that either; the red sauce had a sour taste to it and the chicken was dry. Lastly, my friend ordered the cheese ravioli's and said it was just okay. We all agreed that everything tasted as if it had been pre-cooked hours before and reheated in a microwave. We are not ""foodies"" or picky eaters; however, we expect food from a restaurant to be tasty and fulfilling.

3466057,2016-06-20,0,SsN-SaGGkJn2Qm-jSDQ4aQ,"My husband and I visited this restaurant on a recent trip to Las Vegas. Actually MOST of the food was really very good. So why give it only two stars you ask? A $10.00 salad that came between us and the restaurant. It became a matter of principle and VERY poor customer service. The appetizers of calamari and crab/pasta balls were hot, filling and delicious. My husband's next course of Caesar salad (he had the restaurant week 3 course special) was ok but I thought rather small. I ordered the Trevi salad. A rather large salad with chopped tomatoes, mozzarella, hearts of palm, tomatoes and a vinaigrette dressing($10).  One bite of this salad and I knew something wasn't right with the dressing. I mixed the salad around with my fork, one more bite and I realized the dressing tasted like some type of white vinegar diluted with water. NO seasoning, ZERO taste. As the server came by I handed him the salad and told him very nicely that I found it inedible due to the dressing. He explained that they recently switched to a different kind of vinegar. I said ""that's fine, but that's all that's on it and it tastes diluted. I just can't eat it"" He took the full salad away minus a couple of bites and apologized but thanked me for being ""nice"" about it. The meal continued on and was truly very good. I had a generous, and piping hot portion of chicken parmigiana while my husband enjoyed the papardalle bolognese. We told the waiter how much we were enjoying the food of course with the exception of my salad. After adding two cocktails and a glass of wine and coffee the $140 check arrived. The problem was the $10 charge for the salad was still on it. I just assumed that a good server and a good manager on duty would have removed the charge automatically. I was wrong. This is where what could have ended as a great experience despite the salad, started to go quickly downhill. I asked the server to kindly remove the salad charge. He looked rather bewildered and stuttered a bit and said ""oh yeah sure of course, of course"". After several minutes the manager on duty appeared and without asking me anything stated that if I didn't want to pay for the salad, I shouldn't have eaten it. I told her I had to eat a couple of bites to realize how bad it was but in actuality I returned most of the salad uneaten. She then felt it necessary to tell me the server said I ate the entire salad!!!! I said ""NO!!! Send him here and let him tell me that. We are not complaining about anything else.  Just a lousy salad!!"" She then said I should have taken him up on his offer to bring me another type of salad. I told her he didn't make that offer. Very reluctantly she said ""ok we will remove the charge"" but it was obvious that she wasn't happy about it and was given a different story by the server. When the server finally returned he spun his own tale. I asked him why he told his manager that I ate the salad. He said ""this is how I remember it, you ate the salad and I asked how it was all you said you said 'eh'. That's how I remember it."" Now I could feel my blood pressure rising. I reminded him that that was not the case AT ALL. We paid the check that they reluctantly reduced by $10 and we left with a ""bad taste in our mouths"" not from the salad or the rest of the meal but from the attitude of the server and the manager over what was a very small portion of our meal and the overall bill. Consequently I have tried on three different occasions to call to speak to ""John"" the general manager. I don't know if he was there or not but on all three occasions employees tried very hard to direct me to someone else. My distinct feeling is they are all afraid of complaints going to him and/or upper management. There are so many good restaurants in Las Vegas I recommend skipping this one for one with a more customer friendly staff.

Bellini ($10): A little too sweet for my taste but still okay....couldn't really taste the alcohol. 

Blackberry Italian Soda ($5)

Spinach, Artichoke & Crab Dip ($13.95): Absolutely DELICIOUS. I die just thinking about it. The dip was so creamy and cheesy...served with a side of hot crostini...soooo aaaammaaazzziiingggg. 

Caesar Salad ($7.95): Crisp romaine leaves and a tasty caesar dressing. 
Always a favorite of mine.

Deep Dish Pizza ($14.95): Tomato Basil sauce, buffalo mozzarella and shaved parmesan....this was horrible. I don't even know what made it so bad, but what a disappointment after eating that amazing Spinach Dip!

So they've got a good replica going on at least.

The food was good as I said, but nothing to write home about. Fettuccini Alfredo was much better than say, Olive Garden, but it's probably not going to have you come crawling back for more.

I don't recall what we all ordered exactly but we were all generally pleased with the food portions and quality.

It was so fresh, and so tasty I took my time on it. It was probably the first time my wife ever finished her food before I did. So frikkin' good.

It's also worth noting our entrees made it to the table like lightning. I was floored. I had only eaten one piece of bread prior. I'm always suspicious when that happens, but like I said, this food was very good. And finally, we had the triple Gelato for dessert. I'm a Gelato snob as much as I'm an Italian food snob, which figures since they pretty much go hand-in-hand. In fact, it was the Gelato counter that made our decision. If we can have a nice dinner next to that beautiful fountain under the fake sky with Gelato for the win, I call that a good day. 

I also really appreciated the manager-type who came over to the table to check up on things. What a fun dude and great conversationalist.

We tried the Calamari Fritti to start and it was delicious! Our waiter was very informative and said that they dip the Calamari in milk which makes it less chewy.  The marinara/bolognese sauce they used for the calamari was on point too!

My Uncle tried the Capri Coral Crush, He loved it! It came in a martini glass but was like a smoothie. It was a great mango-alcoholic drink!  I ended up ordering a nice glass of Merlot to compliment my meal.

For my main course I ordered the LINGUINE AI FRUTTI DI MARE and it was to die for! It was a huge portion and was so good that I was able to finish it! The Linguine comes with lobster, scallops, shrimp, tomatoes and this excellent fettucine like sauce! Definately could see why it was their signature dish!

Prior to being diagnosed with celiac disease, this is probably one of my favorite restaurants in Las Vegas. It always provided delicious Italian dishes with a decent price tag and a great atmosphere. I love eating outside the restaurant (but in the mall) on the cobble stone street being able to people watch while enjoying a delicious meal and glass of wine. 

We decided to stop there and have an early lunch one day while out shopping around. They do not have a dedicated gluten free menu but they were able to give me several options on the menu that could be prepared gluten free. While the waiter wasn't as confident about gluten free items, he was able to go back into the kitchen and talk with the chef about choices for me, which made me feel pretty good about eating there. 

I decided on a filet and mashed potatoes. It's probably one of the safest dishes we can eat at a restaurant without getting glutened. The steak was cooked perfectly and the mashed potatoes were delicious. I wouldn't expect anything less from Trevi. 

While they don't have a dedicated gluten free menu, I feel comfortable in saying that folks who can't have gluten but are able to explain and ask questions about their meal would be able to safely have dinner there without any problems.",aWoleC-dZWLcKPn3joeQ8w,3,0,5,h1p1zokhXO9PSisYwPtFqw

My fiance had their margherita pizza, it was underdone and flavorless.

The calamari was good, but overpriced.

I had their signature dish, a fettuccine seafood pasta for $30.  The seafood tasted fresh and good.  But the pasta and seafood lacked seasoning.  I honestly think it was a can of alfredo sauce, dried pasta, and fresh seafood.  They killed the seafood by not seasoning it and with horrible pasta sauce.

For the price, it is not worth it by any means.  We decided right then and there that we would not be hosting our reception there and regretted the $90 tab. 

In all honesty, I could've put together better food for cheaper.  Completely overrated, underseasoned, and overpriced food.

But boy, do I think that this place deserves it!  

Anyway, me and my friends (a total of 5), ended up here after we were told that we would have to wait for 90 minutes or so at the close by Cheesecake Factory.

The ambiance is quite nice, with the fountain, and the surrounding expensive jewelry shops, but ten minutes or so down the road things get quite uncomfortable, since three disadvantages of the fountain become quite prominent:  a)that thing is loud, b)it gets quite chilly, and last but not least, c)you get an idea of how being a movie star is, being on the spot of a couple hundreds of photographs and flashes every minute, from all the tourists that are trying to keep the fountain in the Las Vegas memories...  (and all this while you are trying to eat).

The service:  bad and borderline rude.  I never thought that a server would actually be rude, or indifferent let's say, to his customers, but this guy certainly was that.  As far as time handling though is concerned, it was ok.  Not the best I have had, not the worst either, to be fair.

The food:  Bad and overpriced.  I got the chicken parmesan.  I ate it.  Nothing more to say, it was just a plain plate, a plain taste, just plain...  But, I guess I was the lucky one, because nobody else in my group neither enjoyed, nor ate what they got.  Unfortunately I do not remember what the others got, but it wasn't good.  (one of them I think got the spinach pizza, and I just remembered that because I remembered that he had to perform a surgery on it, taking almost all the toppings off, in an effort to get it closer to being edible.

In a nutshell:  as somebody else said, a tourist trap.  I was a tourist, and I got trapped.... but I am never going back.",zPGEf165KY9U1EcQKu8OCA,1,0,1,FdR57NLLsEc0LrNr9HX3eA

We were starving but everything inside the casino was very high end. We ventured inside the Forum Shops area and stumbled upon this restaurant . The menu looked good and prices were moderate so we decided to give them a try.

We were very happy with our meal. First of all, do yourself a favor and make sure you're seated on the patio (still indoors but you get the same feel) which overlooks the Fountain of the Gods and also makes for wonderful people watching!   The menu is rather large and lengthy with many Italian favorites. As always, we were famished and wanted to order everything. Thankfully, our server warned us that portions were large and suggested against ordering an appetizer since so I was ordering a frozen Bellini, a salad and each of us was ordering a full sized entree. 

So glad we listened to her because out came a basket of the most delicious bread and olive oil. Mmmmm don't skip that!  The Caesar salad was good but way too much dressing was tossed with. I will skip it or share. I ordered the Gnocchi Modenese. While it was rich and delicious- after a few bites, I understood why our server warned us of portions. The gnocchi pieces were like butter (well ricotta and potato) and my stomach let me know so couldn't handle any more bites as it was closed for business lol! My husband had the Ravioli Alla Vodka- cheese filled ravioli with vodka tomato cream sauce. Again- delicious but way too filling. We honestly should've ordered 1 salad and an entree to share but hindsight is 20/20! Lol

We'd made a reservation because there were six of us, but when we arrived it didn't seem that busy. We probably could have done without the reservation, even though it was a Saturday night. 

First they seated us ""outside."" It was SO loud - to the point that we actually asked to be moved inside. I wouldn't necessarily recommend sitting out there, unless you're a bit closer to the restaurant side.

We ordered a bottle of champagne to celebrate - it was pretty good, but I forget the name. One girl in our group accidentally spilled two of the glasses; the server and bussers were helpful in immediately getting it cleaned up, but then the server brought two new glasses. That was nice of him, except then he charged $9 apiece. I get that you need to make money, but don't bring glasses, act like they're complimentary because we had a spill situation, then charge us. I'd have preferred he ask us if we wanted to pay for more.

I ordered the pesto fettuccine. It was meant to come with shrimp, which I don't eat, so I was able to order it without and pay less. It was good; definitely something I'd order again. One girl in our group really wanted fettuccine Alfredo, which they made for her even though it wasn't on the menu. 

It was definitely good food; everyone was pretty happy with theirs. Our server was friendly and quick. The champagne situation was a little annoying but overall, it was a pretty good experience.",_laOfCHYOXa9CuUJRabhFg,0,0,4,Z2ZKr_8XMOJj56YcjlqFEQ

 You could tell that Trevi put love in preparing their food. I can't necessarily say if it was authentic or not, but it tasted darn good to me. The pasta was fresh and light and seasoned well and my pizza was seasoned and I could really taste the basil. The crust was thin and crispy and I could taste a hint of butter. 

My Italian soda wasn't overly sweet and our lemon and strawberry sorbet was delicious! The lemon was tart and you could tell it was made from real lemon.

""Outdoor"" seating is available next to the fountain, which can make for a memorable dinner. My wife and I still fondly remember our prior dinner here, more than 10 years ago.

So on our recent Vegas trip we came back for a return visit. We were reluctant, however, to blow our budget on yet another high-priced Strip dinner. We were delighted to discover that Trevi's as an option for more budget-minded diners: a pair of weekly specials. I had the Pizza of the Month (cheese and sausage) for $9.99, and my wife had the weekly sandwich special, a custom-roasted hamburger. 

We were not expecting anything special from pizza and hamburgers, but were pleasantly surprised what a top chef can do to everyday fare. The hamburger and pizza were fantastic, so good that they almost needed a new name - they were so far and above what we have come to associate with these items! So if you are on a budget it's worth checking out these weekly specials.

Service was also top-notch, best we experienced during our week in Vegas, albeit with one exception cited below. Our server was extremely pleasant and personable, offered excellent suggestions and her service made for a wonderful dinner.

However, I must point out one negative: towards the end of the meal we were hit up to purchase a card good at Morton's restaurants across the country, offering discount meals, for an upfront $25. Perhaps a good deal for some, but not us; there were few of these restaurants in our local area. Still, our server mentioned this twice, and the manager actually came to our table to give us a 5+ minute spiel himself. The sales tactics are overly intrusive, and should be pared back to a short intro and a brochure. I'm deducting one star purely for this.",LH0FkDEJbZmBcvmuoaY5iA,0,0,4,pYFRFYO-J4tViYNVG7x58Q

We were asked if we wanted to eat on the patio or inside.  Because the water flow at the fountain is loud, we asked for a patio seat near the back.  That's exactly what we got from the delightful hostess.

Within moments, our server was there to take our drink order and a runner stopped with fresh bread and a bottle of olive oil with a sprig of rosemary.  She poured some of the oil into a small dish for dipping the bread.  Our iced teas were quickly brought.  We had a few questions and our server, Cheyanne, was an excellent help.

My wife ordered the chicken Limone which the menu describes as ""fettuccine with grilled chicken, artichoke hearts, sun-dried tomatoes and lemon zest tossed in a tangy cream sauce.""  I got the pollo la Griglia which is described as ""grilled chicken medallions with oven-roasted tomatoes, artichoke hearts and provolone cheese in a tomato caper bianco sauce, served with risotto cake and asparagus.""  For dessert, we shared a Coppa Cioccolata which is described as ""chocolate gelato and fresh raspberries with chocolate & raspberry sauces.""

The food was excellent.  The cream sauce with my wife's chicken was very good, and she loved the touch of the sun-dried tomatoes in the sauce.  The chicken was moist and tender.  My chicken was also very good.  The provolone was quite stringy and made the dish very tasty!  The risotto cakes were something new for me and I'm so glad I got them.  I think I'll return and just get some risotto cakes they were that good.

Dessert was also excellent!  The gelato was dark chocolate and had a very rich flavor.  The fresh raspberries and the sauces just added to a good dessert and a perfect size for sharing.

The ambiance was outstanding!  Watching the ceiling lights change brightness and color to emulate sunrises and sunsets and seeing the small blue lights for stars while listening to the water at the fountain makes for a romantic and scenic setting.  It's so much fun to dine at a place like this in Las Vegas where we can watch the tourists as they stroll by and take photos of everything.  What a city!

As for service, it was first rate!  Our table was never unattended by someone.  When I put and empty packet of Sweet 'n Low on the table, it was removed almost immediately.  Cheyanne or one of the bussers kept our iced teas refilled.  She was a very pleasant young woman.  She boxed some leftovers and included a packet with plastic ware and a napkin.  

I had promised Brandon, the general manager, at our Yelp event that I'd be back.  When I asked about him last night, Cheyanne gave him my message and he came to the table and chatted with us.  I also watched as he went to other tables to check on diners.  He's alert to what's going on and he's a very personable guy.  The staff and the food make this place a will return.

First, let's deal with the location. The fountain can be great to look at and of course the people watching probably doesn't get much better. However... the fountain is loud, generates lots of humidity, and that section of the Forum seems to be a hot spot (temp wise). If you're near the fountain, you're likely to be in lots of photos (which can be annoying getting flashed in the eyes all meal long) or having people stand at the railing observing your meal or kids crawling on the fountain wall around you. To me, its a take it or leave it equation. I would aim for the patio just outside the restaurant where the negative aspects may be  minimized. 

I've been here a couple times. Recently, they had a mozzarella, strawberry, basalmic salad that was great! I once had a great risotto, last visit was a combo of over/under cooked (like they had some left over from another table and mixed old w/ new). $40 for risotto with salmon bits, 5 small clams, and a fair portion of calamari is a little steep. Other dishes have been good, can't remember anything I wouldn't try again. Caprese is good. Wine markup is a little much for mostly entry level selections. Service was execellent.

Located in the middle of the shopping forums near the big fountain, the gf wanted to eat here so that we can enjoy the setting. We thought it was beautiful here and we had a great time. I can see why people wouldn't wanna sit here though, it's a little difficult to carry on a good conversation because of the flow of people walking around in the shopping forums, plus the loud fountain, plus the customers trying to talk louder than the surrounding sounds.

Food:
Polento Fries - The best thing they have. We got started with this as our appetizer and it was wonderful. Instead of potatoes on the inside, it's like a very soft, moist bread with a texture like a type of cheese or tofu of some sort. You dip these into their marinara sauce and yum, it's definitely a must try.
Penne Pesto - My gf was craving pesto, so she ordered one with penne pasta which wasn't on the menu. This dish came out pretty bland and flavorless, she mixed in some of the marinara sauce from the polenta fries and said it was okay like that.
Penne Puttanesca - I wanted something that would have a bit of a kick to it. This was a good choice; it had a very bold flavor with a bit if spiciness to it. I was very satisfied with it, I think my gf was jealous that she didn't order this entrée! One problem I had with this dish was that they put way too much capers in it. At first it was okay, but by the end of the meal I found myself picking the capers out. Advice: tell them to take it easy on the capers when ordering the puttanesca!
We also got their gelato for dessert. I ordered their cappuccino flavor. My gf got vanilla. Their vanilla gelato was delicious! My cappuccino... not so much - it wasn't horrible, but it pretty much had no flavor or distinct taste.

Service: 
Pretty horrible. Especially for an Italian place, they were very inattentive and lacked personality. All servers looked rushed & not in sync with other workers. I almost had to yell across the patio to get my server's attention to get refills for our drinks.

My boyfriend likes to go here whenever he wins big at the casinos.. so we made our way here on Saturday night.  It was about 8pm, and there was a 20 minute wait.  Not bad at all.

We started off with Calamari Fritti as our appetizer and for our main course, my boyfriend ordered his usual; Chicken Marsala and I ordered the Penne Diavalo. 

They brought out some fresh warm bread for us after we got our calamari... I was wondering why they brought out our appetizer first but oh well.  The bread was good, but I was trying not to eat too much before my pasta came out.

The Calamari was delicious.  Pretty decent size to share between two people.  Loved the dipping sauce and how crispy/flaky the calamari was on the outside but chewy and soft on the inside.  Yum.

Boyfriend really enjoyed his Chicken Marsala as usual.  He did make a comment about how the presentation looked different this time and how the previous time he ordered, the dish did not come with pasta but it did this time.  So props for that; adding more food to the dish (;

I enjoyed my Penne Diavalo.. but I was slightly disappointed that it had no hint of spice at all.. even though the description said ""spicy"" and even my waitress asked if I was okay with spice... how deceiving.  Overall, it was a decent dish.. I think they added a little bit too much sundried tomatos.. and it would've been nice if the chicken came cut up in chunks or something.. rather than huge slabs here and there, mixed into my pasta.  I'll probably order something else next time since this dish didn't exactly ""wow"" me. 

Prices are a little steep for pasta... we ordered the vodka ravioli and it was almost $20 alone.. but it's Vegas; what do you expect?  Service is good, my waitress constantly brought out refills for us without having to ask for props for that.

No worries though, our waiter was accommodating to our light snack needs, perfectly fine bringing us just a dessert menu. We settled on a sorbet sampler and a few cappuccinos. The cappuccinos were well made and accompanied by a crispy almond biscotti - yummy! The sorbet was also very refreshing - strawberry and lemon were our runaway favorites.

For dinner, I ordered the spaghetti with meatballs (a rare choice for me) and my husband ordered the chicken marsala. The spaghetti, was reminiscent of my younger days of Chef Boyardee. Honestly, not worth $18. The Chicken Marsala kind of reminded me of salisbury steak based on presentation. The chicken cutlets were cut thin and tasteless. The bread and oil dip was really good and had great flavor. Overall, the location was perfect for someone looking for a reasonably priced meal with the forum shops. The food is ok, but nothing to brag about. The food presentation is boring, and I considered the food to be just sustenance for a hungry person.

Caprese appetizer was excellent. Tomato was ripe and the mozzarella was light and fresh. Bread is disappointing, tasted like grocery store loaf with no hearty crust. My coworker had seafood and angel hair which he liked. I had eggplant parm which was far too heavy on the cheese but cut thin and crispy which I liked.

If you happen to be seated in the ""patio"" right next to the fountains (like us), expect to photobomb dozens of pictures throughout your meal. 

Service was slow and bleh.. the waitress didn't seem like she wanted to be there on a late Sunday morning.

Luckily, the food and good company made up for the grouchy server. I ordered a dish with a long Italian name and ""Shrimp"" thrown in somewhere. From my foggy recollection, there were 4 or 5 ginormous shrimps swimming in a sea of pasta shells (or rotini?) dressed in a rich, creamy, mouth-watering sauce. 

I had only finished half my pasta when my entire party (sans me) had their empty plates cleared from the table. I wanted to be considerate with my friends' time, so I packed up my leftovers. Even though I brought food home, the portion size was definitely more European-like than American. 

For the price I paid ($20+/entree), I expected more food. Even the bf was sulking about being hungry after he finished his lasagna.

Vegas prides itself in being excessive, and Trevi fell short of that standard. Sure, the food delivers and the restaurant is a cute date spot, but when I'm in Vegas, I'm going big or going home... or not coming back, but I would love to check out the Happy Hour here.

To be honest, the house salad wasn't that great (get the Caesar salad instead - trust me). The bolgonese was a very nice portion and also came with mozzarella on top! Now onto dessert, you have a couple of choices but we got the gelato. You get 2 scoop of any gelato flavor of your choice! 

I really just love the whole vibe and aesthetic of the restaurant. It's right by the Trevi fountain and tucked in between Cartier, Louis Vuitton, Gucci, and Tiffany & Co. Like wowww, what a view!

I ordered a gigantic seafood salad.  It has shrimp, scallops, crab.... so darn tasty.  The pizzas were perfect, thin, crispy, stringy cheesy.  

We looked at the wine list...really overpriced.  We recognized some of the wines, definitely not worth the price.  But way down somewhere in the menu, near the pizzas was a house ""pizza wine"".  The bottle was 20 some-odd dollars.  It was a light red, bubbly wine.  It wasn't sweet, it was actually quite refreshing and delicious.

The bar in the middle of the restaurant offers seating inside and on the patio, and the happy hour offers were pretty enticing.  The signature drink is a frozen Bellini that really was more tart than sweet.  I don't think you'd want more than one, but it's definitely a nice, refreshing cocktail to try.  Drink and food prices are very reasonable, even by Vegas standards.

We just wanted a light lunch, so we each chose the shrimp cocktail and one of the daily soups.  I had a the Minestrone soup and it was brimming with hearty chunks of vegetables and a variety of beans, definitely more filling than I thought, but also way more delicious.  My husband had the tomato basil soup, and it was creamy but not too heavy - with a light hint of basil.  
The shrimp cocktail was our favorite item - it came with a nice little side salad packed with flavor and textures, and a tangy cocktail sauce.  It truly could have been a meal in itself!  

Service was quick and friendly, and they ask you if you would like bread service instead of just putting it on the table, a nice gesture during a light lunch.  

If you are looking for a laid back but still upscale lunch spot while shopping at Caesar's then Trevi is a great spot.

RUDE!

I always tip generously whether I order alcohol or ice water.

We ordered the Eggplant Parmigiana as part of our meal.  (We did family style here.)  It was soft, but not mushy - perfectly cooked IMO.

We also ordered the Deep Dish Pizza.  I loved how they used actual chunks of mozzarella instead of shredded.  It tasted really good.  I think the crust could have been more crispy and it got soggy really fast, but overall a good pick.

Our 3rd dish was the Pork risotto.  The pork was tender, but it was still a little chewy.  The risotto itself had tons of garlic, not a huge fan of the dish.

Our last dish was the shrimp ravioli, that day's special.   It came with a lemon-y type of cream sauce.  It was an okay dish.  I'm a fan of marinara over creamy sauces.

They serve the usual italian fare, food is good but one must go to experience the beauty of the restaurant.

The patio is ideal for an intimate setting.Perfect place to take your date :)
Happy hour is nice my favourite is the frozen peach bellini you can sip on these for hours while enjoying the beauty of the changing skies at forum.

I recommend going during happy hour if you want the experience without spending too many dollars $$$ (it is Vegas after all and the money just seems to vanish).

Try going during Lunch because evenings are super busy and you might need a reservation.
They also have a gelato bar and don't forget to wish at the fountain.

4585668,2016-05-09,0,SsN-SaGGkJn2Qm-jSDQ4aQ,"Overview: Trevi is an midrange Italian restaurant located inside Las Vegas's Cesar's Palace  shopping center immediately next to the transforming indoor fountain.

The Establishment: This is hands down why you should come here. Located immediately next to the beautiful transforming fountain in an pseudo-outdoor mall, it's one of the most relaxing places to be. Lighting is kept relatively dim and the atmosphere is definitely classy. While your fellow patrons may be dressed in Hawaiian shirts, plenty of others will be wearing their nice ""going out to a club later tonight"" outfits. Spacing is a little bit tight with small tables. Noise is average to slightly high.

The Food: I enjoyed their Cesar salad, Salmon, and chocolate gelato and thought that while it was all prepared very well, I did not feel that it was worth the price. $10 for a Cesar Salad appetizer without meat, $28 for the Salmon, and $6.5 for the chocolate gelato (as of April 2016) was simply too much when the Bellagio offers a ""Gourmet Dinner Buffet"" for $41 or regular dinner buffet for $36.

The Service: Service for at Trevi wasn't very quick and I feel like it's because it's hard to balance out the waitstaff with the intense variation in crowds that frequent Vegas. I see from reading other reviews that many other people have great service here and I guess it depends on waitstaff scheduling. 

Conclusions: Great ambiance, great location, overpriced, slow service, not-exciting but good quality food.",lDUgz8qhkh9peCbxwEOUWA,1,0,3,IeOlCMmBbjr5hOZ02kQGYw

The service was decent and the waiters were nice, but the food was unmemorable. I've eaten food at Macaroni Grill that wowed me more.

My Salmon dish did feature a perfectly cooked piece of fish, but the seafood risotto was boring and lacking flavor. Worst of all the dish came with only three tiny mussels and two shrimp. After reading the menu description of a delicious seafood mix, I was definitely disappointed with what I had.

Italian food that is dry and seasoned wrong.  The chicken roasted was dry.   The carbonara that was so garlicky that you cheered garlic.  Horrible.

Been here twice.  Atmosphere is great. Wait staff very good.   Another note - the busboy was literally running in the restaurant.  Running.   Head chef (guy with beard) just sitting here watching and not saying anything.   Rule #1.  Don't run in a restaurant. 

The staff however both times have been great here.  Carlos is an excellent waiter.   They just need to fix the food.  Just have someone independent review what's going on. You shouldn't have dry food and you shouldn't chew garlic in your carbonara.   The bread was OK but could be redone to be more Italian as well.

We ordered their fried calamari and their sliders for appetizers on the happy hour menu, and we ordered the seafood pasta from their regular menu. Our server/bartender, Kevin, was extremely nice and even asked us if we wanted our pasta split in half for us. The appetizers came out first and were very good. The sliders were perfectly cooked and not dry, while the calamari was crisp and a good portion as well. The pasta also was a really good portion. It filled both of us up even if it was split in half for us, and they definitely didn't skimp out on the seafood.

Overall, it was an awesome first time experience. I'd highly recommend going at happy hour!

First.. Shout out to Open Table for making it so easy to make a reservation here, that site is the best! And I'm happy Trevi utilizes their services. 

We booked a party of 8 for a Monday evening for our team dinner. We were attending a convention so it was business, but we knew we wanted a nice restaurant to let loose, celebrate all our hard work for the past year and to kick off and commemorate the upcoming year. It's our annual tradition. 
This year, I got to pick the place... and after considerable amount of searching I discovered Trevi. And it was a great pleasure to have done so! 

We got a little lost on the walk over so I called the hostess and she was so kind to help us figure out our journey and saved our spot for us because we were running a few minutes behind. 
We arrive and they showed us to our table... a beautiful perfect gorgeous spot on the patio right next to the fountain - we couldn't have asked for any place better. 

Immediately, DELICIOUS WARM BREAD was dropped off with this tasty mellow flavorful garlic dipping oil. It was just so good. We dove in. 

Drinks were ordered. (all phenomenal, try the sangria! does not disappoint!) And our server Carlos kicked things off for us excellently. We had some funky requests (a practical joke to play on our boss) and he went with it. It was just so fun and refreshing to have customer service that goes above the norm. Thank you Carlos! 

THE FOOD- woah the food. Appetizers: the mussels were some of the best we've ever had (and I'm a mussel snob, these were BOMB.COM) We also had calamari (another hit!) For dinner most of our table ordered the seafood pasta, one lasagna, a fish dish, and I had the prosciutto wrapped chicken. We ALL were so happy. Sometimes with large groups, mostly everyone is stoked, but there's always that one that is like man, I wish I didn't order this. NO. not here... EVERYONE was dying over how good everything was. 

Then we got dessert (a gooey choc cake with a scoop of gelato) that we all shared. Also decadent. 

Overall... I am SO excited to go back. The decor, service, food, price, experience, everything: my new favorite in Vegas.

We were walking around the Forum Shops at Caesar's and came across this place. We were distracted by the delicious looking pizza everyone was eating. After looking at their menu, we decided to give it a try. 

We sat at the bar since it was just us two. We got there during happy hour and totally didn't realize how late it was.. It was about 4/5pm but it only felt like it was 1 or 2pm.. (Time difference was so hard to get used to at first) Not to mention that they weren't even crowded. It is usually crowded at places during happy hour back at home but I'm glad we didn't have to deal with crowds. 

At the bar we ordered some drinks to try.. When in Rome right? Or in this case, Vegas. I got their Frozen Bellini which was like a slurpee.. it was awesome! If you know me, I don't like drinks that have a strong taste of alcohol and I like prissy drinks lol. Not to mention I don't really drink. But when you're on vacation.....

We ordered the butt load of food for two people.. Tomato Bruschetta, Stuffed Mushrooms, Fried Calamari (a must for my friend every time we go out) and a pizza. It was all so yummy. 

Service was great and I thought that the price was reasonable for happy hour. But then again when you're on vacation you don't really look at the price =/

It's beautifully decorated, and has an indoor section as well as a pseudo-patio section outside along the forum shops. The outdoor section is adjascent to a large fountain giving it a nice ambiance. It's pretty casual here, and the outside section is great for people watching.
The place is really huge, so even on a busy night, they can accommodate groups.

Food & Drinks: 4*
Most of the food we had was stellar. The margarita pizza here is superb, and absolutely recommended. We had a couple of pastas, most of which were excellent. The desserts and gelato were really good too.
The drinks on the other hand weren't that great. We tried some of their signature cocktails, and they were just meh, nothing special and definitely not worth the cost. 

Service: 3.5*
The servers are friendly, but the service is slow here. There was just one server who was handling the entire outside section, and took a while to take our orders and get the food out, even though it wasn't crowded. Also, before bringing out the check, the server loudly asked us for a tip %, instead of swiping our cards and having us enter it on the receipt, which I found weird and unprofessional.

I reserved our seat via OpenTable.  It turned out that a reservation was unnecessary as the restaurant was basically empty when we arrived (albeit early). We were promptly seated by the fountain.

I should say that service is fantastic! 

The waiter provided a bucket of some kind of 'bread' which none of us liked but I was too hungry to argue. I'm a firm believer that you can judge a restaurant on it's bread. And Trevi was failing early on.

My wife ordered the salmon, my daughter ordered spaghetti (sauce on the side) and I Veal parm.

I'll start with the great - My Veal was exceptional - nearly every time I've had Veal Parm at a restaurant it has been underwhelming at best and like cardboard at worst.  Trevi's was simply amazing.  They should make this a signature dish. Kudos to the Chef.

Our daughter loved her spaghetti - however it came out wrong at first and had to be remade.

My wife's salmon was 'average'. It was cooked properly but lacked any flavor. And it was on a bed of black crunchy something. She fished all the salmon pieces she could off the plate and left everything else.

Dessert menu was passed around and surprisingly our daughter passed on it. If a seven year old passes on sugar, something is wrong with the options. So we asked for the check and left.

What I discovered later is what left 'the bad taste in my mouth'. I received an email via OpenTable roughly 20minutes after we had been seated at Trevi stating that our reservation had been cancelled by the restaurant. I didn't notice it till I got back to the hotel later the same evening. I'll leave it up to you to decide why that might have happened.",A3A5KTNfqCF0lgRgasEXUg,0,0,3,uhEfpeE8eHzaCGOoVxvRrQ

Husband and I went for a quick bite before shopping and had the linguini vongole and a calamari fritti.

The wine list was solid, and they had several selections of white and red by the glass.  We decided to split the antipasto.  It was $13.95 and comes with the usual suspects.  I would want more meat, there was probably only 2 ounces, maybe 3 on the plate.  I think they can add more meat and charge an extra $3 for it and this dish would be a winner.  The marinated artichokes were great, as was the basil leaf included.  Peppers were solid as well, but none were very hot.  I know that most people don't like them hot, but maybe they could offer you hotter peppers if you want them.  Which, I always do.  You do get 4 large pieces of mozzarella.

Gripe #1:  The food was bland, bland, bland.  The portions were huge, so I had a big honkin plate of bland parmesan chicken.  But really, who needs three chicken breasts, plus pasta for dinner?  Same ginormous portions for the bread (which tasted like it came out of a bag) and crème brulee, same bland taste.  I left feeling like I paid a fortune for cardboard.  

Gripe # 2:  The atmosphere was icky.  The restaurant is located in the Forum Shops at Caesar's and we were seated ""outside"" on the ""patio"".  The restaurant wants to be higher end (hence the $30 chicken dinner and Pellegrino water), but it's situated as a glorified food court.  We were surrounded by shops (albeit high end shops...I love you Tiffany's!), so there were throngs of tacky drunkards wandering through in t-shirts too small while wearing guitars full of melted margaritas around their necks with a straw poking out the top.  Really.  A plastic yellow guitar around their neck filled with booze. Don't even get me started.  So not the experience I was hoping for on a bachelorette party weekend.

I give this place two stars, mostly because the service was fine and I didn't get food poisoning (that counts for something, I suppose).  Will definitely not be back.",Tc3ZFjHlL2ucqurPvCE0_A,0,0,2,9BnXaYRewWTlQ0d0z_RYOg

There's the really expensive place by H&M and then there is Trevi which is located by the fountain in front of Louis Vuitton, Gucci, Dolce & Gabbana, Versace, Cartier..... I think you catch my drift. 

FLAVORS: They offer a wide array of flavors. You can sample each and every one of them if your heart desires. There are only 20 or so flavors served here: vanilla, chocolate, cappuccino, pistachio, and more. The other place has a bigger selection but at double the cost.

$: Small (1 scoop) will cost you a few dollars. Large (2 scoops) around $6-ish. 

SERVICE: The girl who was working was really nice and patient. She had a feeling I worked at the Forum Shops (and I do) and she extended the appropriate discount to me. I forgot what it was but I think it was close to 50%.

Our first time here I believe it was 2 years ago, we had the very best service one could ask for. We've actually looked for the same waiter on our last 3 trips, but I don't think he works there anymore (Kevin Bacon) look alike.

My wife always gets Trevi's signature dish. The Linguine Ai Frutti Di Mare, its a medley of lobster, shrimp, scallops, tomatoes and scallions in a wonderful seafood cream sauce.

Its $30.00 and its her favorite dish in Las Vegas. Fresh pasta and just enough seafood so she can fish it all in one serving. My wife tried another seafood pasta dish at another place for like $23.00 and it was night and day. If you like a good meal try this, well worth the extra few dollars.

Like my wife I always get the same thing. I get the pepperoni pizza. I remember the first time , i was so hungry I finished the whole thing. Now I eat most of it and take a couple slices back to my room. its a thin crust pizza and very tasty. Not as greasy as other Pizza places.

We hit up Trevi recently as part of a group dinner after a long day at the convention center. Took a table in the patio courtyard area under the faux sky and clouds. Mock statues and structures of Italy surround the dining area. The skyline rotates from daylight to twilight occasionally. Tourists walk by while shopping at the Forum Shops.

It's pure Vegas cheeze. 

As for the food it's standard tourist style Italian fare. Fried Calimari was over-breaded. Linguini with bolognese sauce was just ok. The Grilled Chicken topped with lemon sauce with roasted veggies was pretty good, plus they do give you a hearty serving. Our waitress was terrific, super attentive, and helpful.

The saving grace were the delicious desserts. The gelatos and sorbets are outstanding. I had the Tiramisu Gelato and could have eaten a gallon of it! Wow.

We saw Trevi had a late night happy hour so we settled in. Well, apparently late night happy hour is for those at the bar. The hostess told us to ask our waiter if it's cool to order from happy hour because there was no room at the bar.

So let me ask you, have you ever felt like your waiter/waitress thought you were a group of cheap people who weren't going to order a lot and thus not tip a lot? Neither had I, until Trevi.

Mind you, at the time, there was literally NO ONE ELSE in the indoor area - as everyone was either on the patio or at the bar. You would also think our waiter would be thrilled to have people to help, especially a group of 8 famished adults.

We ordered drinks and he took our order. It was incredible to see his attitude change when only a couple ordered off the happy hour menu and the rest of us ordered standard dishes. After we ordered, everything else was great. Food was nice (the pasta my wife and I shared was split for us, without having to ask), portions were solid, and the ambiance was enjoyable.

When you take a sit, first take in the surroundings.  The fountain and the lighting is just amazing.  It sets the mood, and it feels like you are really on vacation coming here to eat.  It does get a little chilly, but the food will keep you warm. 

I ordered the Fried Calamari and Special Chicken Pizza. 

Food Quality: 9/10
The food was to die for.  The calamari came out fresh and hot, and was just the right type of crunch.  The squid tasted very real compared to places that mix in real and fake squid.  The texture was very consistent throughout, and the sauces were exceptional. 

The pizza was just cooked to perfect.  Every-bite had great taste of the sauce, and the toppings were just cooked perfectly.  It was quite big, and therefore I was unable to finish it. 

Service: 8/10
This is always a hit or miss.  The place was getting super busy, and sometimes the waiters forget about you.  I am a patient guy, so I did not mind the ""slightly"" longer wait time than usual.  It is best to know what you want if you expect to finish the food to catch a show that starts in about an hour.  I made it to the show thankfully. 

Overall: 8.5/10
The place meets all the requirements for an Italian restaurant.  The food I ordered was amazing, and there were other foods that people ordered that was great as well.  I suggest trying the ""Spaghetti.""  It has their signature meatballs which are to die for as well.

Adding chicken to carbonara seems like a cheap attempt at improving it, but really just makes it a Alfredo. The menu even says it is a ""Parmesan cream sauce"".

The food was very tasty with large portions. We even had leftovers. My daughter wanted some gelatto to go, and our waitress Jenn was awesome and packed her a scoop and gave her a cookie as well.

and sure, I was pretty heavily intoxicated and food was all amazing and almost alien to me at times, but I still do know my food.  Got the calamari fritto and the mozzerella sticks to snack on first.  Breading on both is done to perfection and they started the meal off with a thumbs up.  

Got Trevi's signature dish, their Frutti Di Mare.  This is a seafood pasta, comprised of lobster, shrimp, scallops, tomatoes and scallions.  EPIC.  Pasta sauce was perfect, fish was fresh and BY NO MEANS skipped on, and the flavor combinations went incredibly.  
Got sum dessert the table split, can't honestly tell you what it was but I was on point as well.  Oh, and those cookies they have are dank as fuck too.

I was skeptical of a kitchy Italian restaurant in Caesars, but I thought it couldn't be that bad...blah.  It wasn't exactly BAD, but it just wasn't good.  The best part of the meal was definitely the bread!  The herbs on it were so good, and the oil was the perfect dipping sauce.  They kept it comin' too!

I ordered the lasagna and hubby ordered shrimp amatriciana.  She warned him that it could be ""spicy"" and suggested he get it with no spice so he did.  Unfortunately no spice = no taste.  The watery spaghetti noodles didn't hold any of the ""sauce"" so he was constantly trying to spoon it all together for an ideal bite.  I tasted the pasta and it literally tasted like nothing.  Not impressed.

My lasagna was equally unappealing.  It came to me on a large plate with a glob of congealed cheese on top - like it had been sitting for some time under a heat lamp.  Instead of being hot and fresh, it looked and tasted like yesterday's lasagna that someone threw on a plate, microwaved, and then forgot about.  The sauce was very weird as well - the sauce and the meat were separate.  There were little balls of beef sitting on top of the sauce under the noodles...and it just didn't look good.  It didn't taste good either....it was luke warm and tasteless.  

We had been pumped to order dessert for our fancy night, but we ended up passing.  The dessert menu looked good enough,  but we were just too turned off after that dinner.

Also, wait staff was annoying.  We got there at 9:45 and they closed at 11.  Around 10:30 we had a waitress come by and ask us to swap her oil bottles - in my opinion, if you have closing work, you work on empty tables first and then move to other tables AFTER the customer has left.

c) they took the polenta fries off the menu-now that's a crime
d) keep in mind there's no 'food court' per se in this mall so your choices are going to be limited-The Palms, Spagos, Joe's Stone Crab [not to be confused with Joe's Crab Shack--another crime], RA sushi, BOA -- all high end restaurants so you are going to be paying either way for food here
e) their bread is good. and I liked my entree fair enough [lemon artichoke grilled chicken pasta something or other]. I'm not dying to go back there just for this entree but you get my point

What we shared - Meal: Chicken Limone
Our rating:  6

Ambiance/atmosphere: 8 - The fountains in Caesars along with the shopping are great, especially if you get to sit near the patio. It is a bit cramped, but the environment is lively.

Service: 6 - Perhaps it was because we were a large party, but the service was not the fastest, and it took them quite some time to retrieve our items. However, they were gracious. 

Overall we had a great experience, and would definitely put it on the many places to eat at when in Vegas. We recommend you try to make reservations in advance because it seems to be quite popular and the wait can be lengthy.

Until next time!

Positioned by a mock-up of the famous Trevi Fountain in Rome in the middle of the Caesar's Palace Forum Shops Promenade, Trevi is an excellent place to enjoy a casual lunch or dinner in a relaxed atmosphere with the interesting feeling that you're sitting outside, (when you're actually inside). Try to position yourself at least 30 feet from the large fountain if you want to hear each other speak. The decibel level of the fountain's spewing waters will rival any meaningful conversation you might want to have. 
The Fettuccine Alfredo that I ordered at $18.00 was undoubtedly the best I ever tasted. The Alfredo sauce was creamy with a beautiful hint of parmigiana, and the fettuccine pasta was perfectly aldente. --A true masterpiece. 
My friend's seafood risotto, at $29.95, was also prepared exceptionally well. 
The entrees were preceded by a well prepared Caesar Salad, as well as an artichoke dip, at $14.00, that was quite tasty,but needed  a few more crostini (croutons) for dipping. 

Dinner was enjoyed with several glasses of a nice buttery Chardonnay and capped off by a shared slice of strawberry, cheesecake at $8.00, which was also very tasty. 

I recommend Trevi to everyone. It has such a relaxed old-world charm and atmosphere, and is also a perfect place to people-watch.  --One of my all-time favorites!",EUFfQOTBsbyLejnl9buEEw,0,0,4,-5W_Nt0Xp0sZyUFdGLjuFw

The food came out fairly quickly and was great, but could have been a little hotter. The salmon entree was small but the flavors make up for it. The capellini bianco is an angel hair pasta dish with shrimp and lump crab, light but creamy and delicious!

Service was great but a little slow. I guess many others like to take their time while dining but we wanted to eat and see other things.

The overall layout of the restaurant looks good - they have a pretty large ""patio,"" which is right by the fountain.  Inside is more tables and a large-ish bar with tvs.  The kitchen was open and you could see the action.

The staff was very friendly and welcoming, and we got to taste a few items from the menu.  The meatballs were very tasty, as was the pasta we had (I don't know which it was, and none on the menu look familiar).  We also had a really good chicken - it was the pollo la griglia.  I love anything with a white wine sauce and capers, so I was sold from the get go, but it was very flavorful and tender.  There were also stuffed mushrooms, which I don't see on the menu, so maybe it was made just for the event?  Either way, they were good.  Pretty standard.  Same goes for the bruschetta - it was good, not great.  But I am not complaining either.

For drinks they served a great pomegrante martini.  I am usually a beer drinker, but this was pretty good.  Super sweet and strong, so I had only 1.

The restaurant is easily accessible, since it is located not too far into the Forum Shops, near the fountain.

Service: Our server was really friendly and food came out quickly.

Food: Here is where Trevi fails...

-- The salmon on the salmon salad was rubbery and dry. This was unfortunate because the rest of the salad was nice and fresh. For $24+ I don't recommend this dish at all.

-- Mini-me had the spaghetti with meatballs and demolished it. This could be because I made her walk up an appetite (3 hours worth of walking) but I'm going to go with the notion that she just really liked her spaghetti.

-- Complimentary bread was just okay.

My husband & I went here last week before we left for Vegas. Judging purely by the menu price (entree in the $25-35 range) and its Yelp rating, we were looking for a pleasant experience but we were both disappointed.  Have to say that their service is great though, nice casual atmosphere, but the problem lies solely in the food.  It was Monday nite at 7pm, the place was not fully  packed until we left at 9pm.  We were greeted by some pretty hostesses who quickly seated us at a comfortable table inside the restaurant.  Their menu is of reasonable size for an Italian fine dining restaurant.  

Our waitress was a young polite cheerful lady who promptly served us with some warm rosemary infused French bread to go with the olive oil, which turned out to be a pretty good combination.  We ordered a pizza ($18) and their Signature grilled fish of the day ($32), which was salmon.  For some reasons, the pizza came out way before the salmon.  The pizza was just so so but certainly not the worst we had so far . The crust was Italian-style thin but it seriously lacked the crispness and texture you would expect if it was served right out of the oven.  We assumed someone might have let it sit in the attempt to wait for the salmon to come out together.  Flavor-wise, ingredients (mushroom, red & green pepper, Italian sausage & something else that I don't remember) were fresh but the tomato sauce lacked flavor.  The waitress apologized for the delay when the salmon came out after our pizza was almost done.  However it was not worth the wait; there was little or no presentation to the dish (the plate had the fish, some capers, sautéed asparagus and 2 apparently 2 day-old potato cakes.  There was no sauce, no art, no special arrangement).  The salmon was totally dry, overcooked when flaked.  The only flavor it had was barely provided by a few capers sprinkled on top of the fish.  Other than that the fish has no flavor.  Immediately we returned the dish to the kitchen. The manager and the waitress politely apologized and agreed that it was apparently overcooked.  We patiently waited for another 10mins or so until the manager brought us another fish but this time it was undercooked a bit.  It flaked with a fork on the outside but not on the inside as it was still a bit translucent raw.  We showed it to the manager, and this time he watched over the chef's shoulder to make sure the fish had been properly seared and done.  Third time is the charm, the salmon came out cooked and moist, but again, it was not seasoned and had no particular flavor.  O well, by this time, my husband had long finished his pizza so I shut up and quickly finished it.  

Just as we were about to ask for the bill, the waitress apologized once again for the fish and was nice enough to offer give us complimentary dessert.  So we chose a creme brûlée to share, not dare to expect anything special.  We were glad to give it a shot as the brûlée was one of the better quality one out there.  The sugar crust was torched just right. Creme was not too sweet, had a good smooth creamy texture, right consistency, and the right balance between the vanilla and egg flavor.",MAS-m2KpALtcYd_QHFwPpg,0,0,3,ualPcx8Aln8GJb8mrmhS3A

The crab in the artichoke dip offers a very different texture and taste to that appetizer.  All the entrees looked delicious! I ordered the Chicken Scaloppine, which was absolutely delicious. I am a big fan on lemony tastes so the lemon butter and capers gave the chicken a really delightful taste for me. I really enjoyed my meal.  All my friends said their meals were good. Every entrée that came out was a good portion for each person. The table secretly let the waiter know that it was our friend's birthday, and he came out with this huge ice cream sundae. The waiter was so nice and took a group picture from the restaurant's camera. In addition he prints it out, posted it on a little cardboard frame, and had all the waiter/waitress sign it. It was a really nice gesture. Overall, a little pricey, but its Vegas!! The food and experience was excellent.",KcjzSRPMmN4yI5W4DA0bBQ,0,1,5,QIbV4TuLDnvWx56AN7pQdQ

Funny, welcoming, made us feel like a visiting friend who wanted us to be happy at his own restaurant! Was able to procure us Happy Hour pricing on our drinks, even though we were not at the bar. Splendid Cosmo for me and a girly Peach Bellini for my big husband! Lol! Salads were just mediocre, (Trevi and a Beet & Carrot one), but excellent drinks and tasty entrees made up for so-so salads. Rufus recommended special Linguine Al Frutti Di Mare (lobster, shrimp, scallops, mussels, etc.), which my husband said was delicious! I was equally happy with my Capellini Bianca (shrimp & lump crab w/angel hair). Both served in a white cream sauce that was Uber-light! So happy it was not a heavy cream sauce that would weigh us down in the Vegas heat! The addition of eating under the fountains with King Neptune, surrounded by exquisite high-end shops, under a painted faux sky ceiling...BELLISSIMO!!!",c-TjGYM8eX0AcFDqmHgTdQ,0,1,5,HESKgOUe_mr767DzyTWFxQ

I ordered the meatballs that were great and the stuffed mushrooms which wasn't. Only one mushroom on the plate and not a lot of flavor. 

Service was ok. Girls working at the bar not very engaging. When you're having a solo happy hour you want a little more attention.",LfD4sY0wt4RHS1DPlgdXuA,0,0,4,6iaiKwJaHWoMg32ANhaZHw

The food was excellent and the prices were reasonable for Vegas. Great location to people watch if you are seated on the patio. Next time we go back, we're going to be sure to stop by for their business lunch. 20 bucks for a soup or salad, and an entree? Can't beat that in Vegas.

Anyway. My girls and I were horrified by a 45 minute wait time at Serendipity. For frozen hot chocolate? No thanks honey, i'd rather trek to New York. Trevi it was. 

Entree portions are big. I'm a big eater too, but I still couldn't finish my food. Food is pretty good for it's price as well.",D2epirooWNjvwTI6MFhNGw,2,1,3,95nllEbjLmVDeZcuYR5cCg
