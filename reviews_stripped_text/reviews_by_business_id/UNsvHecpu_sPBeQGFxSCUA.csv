1941583,2017-05-29,0,UNsvHecpu_sPBeQGFxSCUA,This place is kind of hidden. It's a cute place. I haven't tried any of the food yet but the menu looks good. Customer service was awesome. I come here for the smoothies and the boba. I must say the green tea smoothie with boba is my favorite!. However the boba is made right when u order it so the bottom maybe warm. I just mix it up a little an done.,foHszZ5L5VnjNP8qtzhs2w,0,1,5,lvgmUVpIXviFMVmZde85jw

The lady in the front might be the owner too was really nice and gave great customer service. I went to eat there around 2:45pm only the lady was there. When I mean only her. No one else was here no cooks just her. She took the order made our drinks and then when to the back and made the food. I was surprised since my previous experience it takes some time for all that. But she did it. Now my issue with all that is when I got the food it wasn't as fresh as I remember it the food did change. Basil beef is what I usually get today it was different. The portion did get smaller. 

The reason for the 3 stars is the worker she was awesome very nice and attentive. The food wasn't the best but I feel like there should always be a full time cook. And if the same person does everything their is a high risk of cross contamination. I just feel like they don't make things to order like they use to. They just put it in the microwave and serve it.",9SOM8QgW_JYr1-FCTSHopQ,0,0,3,YTpo-8Du68128gszaplVtw

As another review mentioned, this was a one woman show as in the woman (I think the owner) was the only one working. She took our order, brought us water with a nice slice of lemon and we settled into the waiting area at the front of the small restaurant. Everything was bright, cheerful, colorful and clean, but there are only 3 tables available for dining in. 

Soon the air was filled with the scent of garlic and the pleasant sound of sizzling pans.

We waited about 25 minutes for our rather large to go order. We did not call ahead as we didn't know the new name for the restaurant but she made sure to give us a few to go menus to save us the wait  for our next visit. 

Everything was so delicious, especially the garlic ribs and the pad see ew. We also ordered masaman curry with fried tofu and thai beef jerky.

Good quality ingredients, everything was made fresh while we waited and had a home cooked quality that echoed the cozy, good energy from the moment we walked in. 

I even asked if she had done the beautifully neat and precise hand writing on the menu boards herself and she had! I hope she gets lots of business so we'll be able to order those tasty ribs on many more Sundays to come!",HpY0DHQVKnoGR2FeKwPWHw,0,1,5,UPmraenMz9QoCsO3t4eeAw
3447002,2017-06-08,0,UNsvHecpu_sPBeQGFxSCUA,"I was hungry for Thai and thought I'd try this spot, which used to be ""Mr Chop Chop"" years ago. I was pleasantly surprised when I walked in and found that they had redecorated and it's now a very cozy and pleasant atmosphere. 

I started with an order of Chicken Satay, which included one of the best peanut sauces I've ever tasted. Rather than the usual thin sauce, this was a chunky style that I couldn't stop eating!!

For my entree I was torn between trying the curry or the fried rice, but my problem was solved when I saw that they offered green curry fried rice, with a choice of meat. I went with the pork, and was really pleased to see large chunks of tender pork mixed in with fresh onions, peppers and herbs. I ordered medium heat, which had just the right kick.  

This place is a real gem and they have a nice waiting area if you want to come in and get your food to go. Definitely a place to try if you love Thai food.",wmE7kY21MnhX2_wQdeKz7A,0,1,5,yJsbLd9Po97F0rUv-RCALw

Food was very good. The Thai Egg Rolls were a little doughy on the inside but good.

The Thai Beef Mongolia was good but leaked in the bag, despite their attempts to contain it. The veggies were fresh and cooked perfectly.

The Pad See-Ew was yummy! The sauce was amazing. There was broccoli and Chinese broccoli. It was cooked perfectly and tasted just as good for leftovers!",EWzs7KybnyPNurkBcidCzg,0,0,4,3XZiXFYY2k0_zInbf6Z4SA
