55838,2015-08-08,0,VaKXUpmWTTWDKbpJ3aQdMw,"This is mostly concerning the drink comping policy for gamblers.  I was at the bar playing video poker and a girl sits next to me, puts in $20, and orders a drink. She was playing for a while and was up an additional $20 when she ordered a second drink. 

The bartender proceeds to explain that since she only put in $20 she can't comp another drink. The girl politely protests and explains that she has been playing and intends to play more. I backed the girl up and stated that she had been playing the whole time. The bartender, with a look of frustration on her face, reiterates and further explains that comping is not based on your play but how much you initially put in... 1 drink per $20. 

The girl who was gambling asked if she can cash out and put 20 dollars of her winnings back in to get another drink. The bartender says no. This goes back and forth for a bit. I almost felt a little embarrassed for the bartender. She looked as if she would have preferred to just give the girl another drink but also said that the managers really keep an eye on them! Yeah, you wouldn't want to give a gambler a drink that costs you about a buck! Good Managing!

The whole idea of giving gamblers free drinks is to keep them playing, keep them pushing those buttons... especially if they're winning! You want them to put it back, right?  Duh!  
 
As I was leaving I noticed the girl was now up over $100. I can only hope she cashed out and didn't give it back.

I had a similar situation 2 months ago at the BWW on LV Blvd only I wasn't informed of the comping policy as I ordered my 2nd and 3rd beer. I cash out 20 bucks ahead and the bartender brings me a bill for $15 for those beers. I think the real policy at BWW is ""If you are losing they will comp you, if you are winning they try and get some of the money back by charging you.""

Sally Smith, the CEO of BWW, who made 3.9 million in 2014, was recently quoted as saying that BWW would be raising beer prices yet again. Uhhh! Geez!

Overpriced Beer and Wings and a tight-ass comping policy for players...Too Corporate! I think it's time to find a new place. Fortunately, there's a bar on every corner in Vegas!",K3hMHY8QXe2KB08ZQM-pNQ,3,0,2,TbEtTX8kCQ6nrMXuc8Gfdw

CONS:  Prices are high for the level of quality you're getting.  Buffalo ""chips"" that are described on the menu with a word like crispy is absolutely false.  They are grease-drenched (at least to some degree), floppy and soft. Celery and carrot quality is more miss than hit...oftentimes, it's almost white celery or rubbery carrots. They may be understaffed, because the service is sometimes slow, even though you see your server running around like a madman (or woman.)  Hate that they upcharge for an amount of sauce that should come with the orders (for 10 wings, you get 1 sauce and 1 celery or 2 sauces.)  Don't like that when you play the trivia type games, you have to wait so long in between each round for tons of commercials/ads.   When you get there for pick up after ordering online, you'll almost always wait 10 to 15 minutes past whatever was quoted to you online.  Kinda crazy.

I had to wait 40 minutes for them to cook some additional chicken. How long does it take to fry chicken?  Then they forgot the sauce. That took another 10+ minutes for someone to go to the back and fill up two small tiny cups of sauce.  Seriously. When you mess up an order how about prioritizing the correction?

I went to school in Buffalo and Wild Wings is the closest you are going to get to the authentic ""wings"" you can get in good ole' western NY. 

They have a great atmosphere, great staff, and great food. Sports buffs can be found crowding both the bar and the dining area during games as there are screens galore throughout. 

I honestly like this location better than the one on Hualapai & Flamingo, even though this location is slightly smaller.

If your new to ""B-dubs"", they even have a scale of how hot/spicy their different sauces are. And, if you're not in the mood for wings - they have other stuff on the menu too (from salads to burgers to a variety of appetizers).

Don't forget about the ""seasonings"" for the wings too. Essentially dry rubs, there's salt and vinegar, chipotle BBQ, buffalo, and desert heat.

780037,2014-08-15,1,VaKXUpmWTTWDKbpJ3aQdMw,"Let's face it... it's Buffalo Wild Wings which is pretty much standard when it comes to BWW food you'll find at any BWW. Visited this particular BWW about 5 times to visit with friends to watch some games. Been to several of them across the nation and honestly.... not my first choice of places to go in Las Vegas (or even in my top 20 places for that matter) with so many GREAT places to go.

Food isn't bad but nothing to rave about. Mixed drinks are pretty weak. Do anything more than your typical drafts and you'll be paying the price.

Never really worth reviewing this place in the past but the following incident earned this place a fantastic 2 star rating.

Met up with several people that love to go there to watch a game. Ended up at the bar and a couple of people were sitting at the bar next to us as we played the machines and we chit chatted a little. The girl I was with easily put over a couple of hundred dollars in the machines and I also put in some money and played. Ended up with a tab (yeah.. it's one of those places) which I paid. The people sitting next to us were also playing the machines and ended up leaving. Guess one of them did not pay their tab.

Right after they leave... I have a Bartender ask me in front of the lady I am with: "" Are you going to take care of his tab?""

I asked him why that was my problem and he went off on me. Next thing he says is: ""I'm tired of you guys coming in and not tipping me""... SERIOUSLY??? The few times I've been in there I've always tipped over 20% so I got a little upset to say the least.

But it gets better....

We leave to go somewhere else and then eventually end up at a bar down the street. Low and behold there are some employees wearing their BWW uniforms and one of them starts screaming and yelling at me across the bar that he's going to kick my a** and everything else because some person that I happened to talk to did not pay his tab and I was responsible for it???

What fun.....

Needless to say, I'll NEVER, EVER go back to this particular Buffalo Wild Wings. Too many other bars in Las Vegas to waste my time and money where the employees understand service and taking care of people. Especially customers that plop money into the machines.

I prefer to rave about good service / places but this negative review is certainly well deserved. Not just because of the above incident but from my experience, the bartenders there on swing shift seem to be miserable every time I've been there, rarely smile and their customer service skills are shoddy compared to other places I go.

887427,2017-08-16,0,VaKXUpmWTTWDKbpJ3aQdMw,"We were looking for somewhere reliable to eat this particular afternoon. Half of our party needed to eat and run as they had an appointment. We walked in and the place wasn't very busy. Open tables everywhere. Great we thought, not busy we'll be in an out fairly quickly. Wrong! I walked in said hello to the woman behind the counter and told her a party of 9 plus a highchair. She quickly told me ""no they can help you over there."" Not welcome or here let me show you where to go. More of you fool I don't deal with this, that's not my job. 
So we go to the correct person. Two people actually. They acknowledge us and say just give us a minute to pull the tables together. Keep in mind the whole center of the dining room was nearly empty so we weren't waiting for customers to leave or anything to be bussed. Simply pulling the tables together and voila. There was 3 women up front but 2 stood and watched as their colleague tried to ready the tables. I believe the employee readying the table maybe have had some special needs or developmental delays and was being very particular about laying things out and perhaps taking longer than needed to arrange each menu in front of each chair. This wasn't the issue. I applaud this young woman for being out in the work force and taking pride in her job. However two of her colleagues stood there and just watched her. Didn't offer her any help to set the table as needed. They weren't busy. They were literally standing leaning against the wall and counter. This young lady setting the table walked around the table no less than 5 times adjusting and arranging. Then had to return to the podium to get the correct menu and menu inserts twice. Again the other 2 women stood and watched. We stood there 15 minutes waiting. Once we finally got to the table and waited on the waitress we realized there was no way the half of our party with an appointment would be able to eat in time. So they had to get up and leave. 
This left the table with 6 people. 
BWW had a menu insert for a 15 minute or less lunch or it's free. Of the 6 remaining 3 of us ordered off that minute. One of the younger girls in our party wanted to time the kitchen to see how they did. Innocent enough. 21 minutes roll around and finally the food came out. 
The bill came and the 3 menu items that were suppose to be free were still on the bill. The waitress explained that the special wasn't valid on parties of 6 or bigger and we didn't ask her to bring it out before the 15 minutes. First of all the fine print reads 6 or less. So we met that requirement and you're going to tell me that I have to let
You know that ""hey I ordered off the 15 minute lunch menu and yes that means I would like it in that time."" It's not like this was our idea, this was the restaurants promotion. I shouldn't have to tell you hey I'm ordering off this special menu and yes I want it in 15 minutes?
Now the waitress attempted to rectify the situation by asking if we wanted to see the manager. We declined but let her know we wouldn't be return customers. However that manger should've been at our table the second they knew we were displease. We let them know soon after we sat down that the reason half our party left was because it took 15 minutes to get a table in a half empty restaurant. And then when we had to ask why the promotion as advertised isn't applied and we're clearly annoyed, that manger should've come out without us needing to request them. She removed an appetizer from the bill and left it at that. 
Super frustrated with the lack of team work and a manger without a back bone. Come to the table maybe explain your policy. Help us understand. Don't stay in the back as some mysterious person relaying messages through an employee. 
Also the young lady came to the table to apologize. They must have let her knew we weren't pleased. It wasn't her fault, it was her lazy coworkers that couldn't be bothered to give her a hand. 
Also on top of this the place was dirty. The tables had a film. They set up our larger table by combining a square table and 2 round tables. The round table had drop down sides so it could be square. One person in our party felt weird sitting back from the table and the rounded portion so she dropped the side of the table. Big mistake. We then knew why they left them in that odd configuration. They were to lazy to clean the tables in the first place. Disgusting.",_iVPGVK1etnEXsVEXeopUw,1,0,2,KwxyfU9QXfrRpN9mNF6_0Q

991500,2009-06-19,1,VaKXUpmWTTWDKbpJ3aQdMw,I love chicken wings but the wings they use here are a bit too small. The boneless chicken wings is the best way to go even though it looks like chicken nuggets. The variety of sauces are pretty good. This may be the only thing that redeems this place. Everything is ala carte which means expensive for bar food. For the price...not worth it for me . Just buy your favorite  sauces and cook your own wings at home.,HRyFtrmf19GTKEM_kOa2pg,1,1,2,JHYCCodNs4REgZvj0-KikA

Upon arrival, my order was not quite ready... which was fine. However, when it was ready... I had them go over the order. As they opened each box, 2 out of 3 were not extra wet. The lady who went over the order agreed that they seemed like they needed a bit more sauce. She said she would take them back to have sauce added. 

When she returned, she opened each box and we were both in SHOCK at the amount of EXTRA sauce was added. The wings were practically swimming in the sauce. (See picture - wings removed from the sauce to show the excess) 
She sincerely apologized... ""I'm sorry, I am not sure why they did that."" Was her response.

If you find yourself at this location against your better judgment ask for Katrina. If you like your wings on the crispy side, you'll have to ask for this as they tend to come slightly undercooked (i.e., soft skinned). I forgot to ask, so I was slightly disappointed with my wings.  The best flavors of wing sauces are the Jamin Jalapeño and Spicy Garlic.

I have attempted to eat at this location twice before. Yesterday, I managed to stay without leaving before I was served. Even so, I experienced the same problem at the hostess stand as I had two times previously.  There seems to exist a fundamental problem with the manner in which guests are handled when they enter this BBW location.  Unlike most BBW locations that seem to have a half-dozen teenage girls/boys at the front podium, this location tends to have one or two. Everyone else seems to be hiding in the back - I guess. If the hostess is in the middle of taking a take-out order, you could wait for a very long time without so much as a greeting. I consider waiting without a greeting or acknowledgement to be problematic after about 4-5 minutes because it only takes a second to tell a guest you'll be right with them.

Since my friend selected the location with a strong desire to have wings and a cold beer, I agreed to give the place another try. Thankfully, our server Katrina saved the day. She was very pleasant, attentive, and accommodating.  Although the food did not meet with my quality standards, the service and my cold Angry Orchard ciders on tap did. Couple this with some great company, and the venue worked out to my liking.

Ironically, the poor greeting turned into a rather red carpet exit when two staff members sent us off with a pleasant good-bye and grabbed the door for both of us on the way out. Upon quickly comparing my greeting, it felt a little surreal. Although I am not looking for a red carpet entrance, guest should be welcomed and feel like a valued guest when they enter.",jY1shXf_LQVhSoUyoXqQRQ,1,0,3,CeXluVcmZm6aBdICSlYPfQ

The first time we had a bad experience, our appetizer (we ordered the spinach and artichoke dip) came out crusty from the top, as if it's been sitting there for a while. Today, as soon as we walked in we saw the employees, which I assumed were hosts sitting down in the waiting area because of how slow they were. We ordered the same appetizer today and the dip was definitely fresh this time but they gave us tortilla chips, which on the menu it says it comes with pita chips. Not a big deal, we ate them anyway. Our waitress, Christina, when we began to order our food gave us a dirty look as if we were inconveniencing her, she also didn't bother check up on us throughout our dining (keeping in mind that it's REALLY slow and there's probably only two other parties dining) and brought us refills AT THE END when we had already finished our food. We also ordered fries and we never got them, but we were charged for them! Obviously we told her and she apologized and said ""why didn't you tell me"", well it's kind of difficult to tell you if you didnt even bring us our food and you're no where to be visible nor check up on us. We went in on a Tuesday expecting to get the 1/2 traditional wings which is promoted on the BWWs website. When we got our bill we asked her about it and she told me ""well we don't do that here,"" and i told her that it's on the BWWs website and then called her manager over. The manager, very polite proceeded to tell me that the 1/2 traditional wings on Tuesday's is only for franchise stores and not for corporate stores. This is by far the worst experience and I do not recommend this location!

1773251,2016-02-28,1,VaKXUpmWTTWDKbpJ3aQdMw,"The only time I go to Buffalo Wild Wings is for their happy hour and Tuesday specials. I came to this particular location because my friend lives close by to this one. And we were really craving wings ! Although I only crave American wings like once or twice a year.

Their happy hour starts from 2 pm-7 pm and 10 pm-2 am only on weekdays for appetizers and drinks. I like their mozzarella sticks for 4$. Imported and domestic draft beers go from 3-5$. On Tuesdays , their traditional wings are 60 ¢ each at this location. They charge extra for sauce.

I LOVE their ""Asian zing"" flavor. It's a must whenever I come here. However , I was really disappointed with the ""wild"" flavor. It's the second ""spiciest"" sauce on the menu BUT IT WAS NOT SPICY AT ALL. It was ""mild"" at best. I should've tried their ""reformulated blazin'"" sauce (apparently hottest sauce on the menu) but it's just one up from ""wild"" flavor , so I don't think it would be that spicy. Wingstop is better if you want spicy wings.

If they have their Tuesday/Thursday specials , then this is the place to go , but if it's not Tuesday/Thursday , I much prefer Wingstop for their food.",qtOCfMTrozmUSHWIcohc6Q,2,2,3,0uEqgivTkRsKtKySrFpwDg
1781975,2013-12-13,1,VaKXUpmWTTWDKbpJ3aQdMw,"I live between the locations on Las Vegas Boulevard and Durango. This location is definitely my preferred choice.

Setting: It's a sorts type of wing bar. I was seated promptly after arriving to a Tuesday bball game night with $0.60 wing special. Place was packed.  As always, I order myself Garlic Parmesan and Honey BBQ and boyfriend orders the same along with Thai Curry. A basket of onion rings for appetizer. Not anything special, just hungry for any protein that will curb hunger.

What was supposed to be a routine 10-15 minute wait became a 45min wait. The manager did rounds to each table about 20 minutes in and conversed with customers, greatly apologizing. He said one of the fryers was down and kitchen was insanely backed up. He explained that was even no excuse for the wait and that they'll take care of our wings. (I understand that it's not human error...they're doing the best they can!) Staff was sincere and working hard. Server consistently checked in on us and refilleddrinks.

Overall: Food was ok. Onion rings were battered. Not breaded. Not really worth that long of a wait, but what got this place four stars was service.  Service was attentive despite their backup and when the manager said they'll take care of our wings to apologize for the wait, he really meant it! All the wings that night were free of charge.

One of few places where I know manager routinely does rounds with the customers' table. I don't even think other restaurants would try be so accommodating while you wait. Best bdubs in the valley for service",fGRzUxh3oDdLbhkr1Lr8Cw,5,2,4,xgZ-9KcYTh7-Mw1DecIepw

1853623,2015-06-03,1,VaKXUpmWTTWDKbpJ3aQdMw,"This review is long over-due for me. I've been to this BWW so many times since I moved here that I've lost count. I usually try to go during Happy hour/Tuesdays to fully enjoy myself. 

Starting off with appetizers they have a good variety to choose from (Mozzarella sticks/Chips & Salsa/Onion Rings etc) for only $3 during happy hour as well as $3-5 for Imported & Domestic draft beers. Traditional Wings on Tuesdays they charge 60¢ Per wing.


Bar - (Can't have wings without a cold one) For beer selections, they have a great variety of beers to choose from. From Stella Artois to Angry Orchard and some good ol' Samuel Adams. 

Any Variation of BBQ (Sweet/Hot/Honey/Chipotle/Korean BBQ) - I really find the BBQ flavors here to be really bland and lackluster, they really don't impress compared to other places such as wingstop where the BBQ is savory and just overall delicious, definitely won't be ordering them any time soon

Hot Wings (Mild/Medium/Hot/Buffalo) - As far as wings go, these are the ones you HAVE to order, From my experiences in Vegas every sauce that i've tried so far is either too salty, hot, bland, sweet, or vinegary. The sauce should be tangy with a nice vinegar hit, taste rich of butter, and of course have heat BWW hits this perfectly and I couldn't be more pleased.

The main problem that I've had with Buffalo wild wings is just inconsistency in every aspect. The service is either out of this world or straight up awful. As for the wings they could have the perfect amount of sauce and great taste, drowned in sauce and ruin your meal, or they could have no sauce at all and leave you disappointed.

A buddy of mine swears that you should only ever order the wings. Never try for any other food item because you will be disappointed. Apparently, the wings are alright.

The things saving this place from a one-star review is the amazing service that I received at this one particular location, the number of TVs with games on, and the beer happy hour special.

Our server was so much better than last time. 
Her name is Linnea, such a sweet sweet girl, I'm hoping we get her every time we come back now. She was so nice and friendly to us, honestly can't ask for a better service than today. 
She knew what she was talking about, when she wasn't sure about something she went to ask for the info for you immediately. Friendly and talkative to us, which I appreciate bc some servers couldn't care less about their customers. 
I'd like to say thank you to Linnea, if you are reading this. We really appreciated your great customer service. 
We came on a Saturday which I thought was gonna be busy today but since football is over, not a lot of ppl is here.  
Ordered two beers and she got them for us like right away.

They did not even bother removing it while it is still in the kitchen. Needless to say after I saw that I lost my appetite and I just paid my bill and left.

My girlfriend and I came in for the Tuesday special. We ordered the medium size. 10 hot BBQ 5 honey BBQ and 15 buffalo dry rubbed. ALL FLATS. We also got carrots because that's what the Tuesday special includes.

We waited about 20 minutes for our food and received only 10 hot BBQ 5 honey BBQ and 5 buffalo. The guy that brought out our food asked us if it was the right order. I told him there should be 10 more buffalo. He look at the receipt confused and went and ordered the cooks for more. 

15 minutes later the last 10 wings come out. This place automatically lost 4 stars from these set of wings. This set was NOT all flats. The ones that weren't flats were over cooked. I had a hard time eating them. Oh and they had NO buffalo rub at all. Good thing I asked for extra rub on the side, twice.

It was Thursday and they have a wonderful deal of $.60 boneless wings, except that they ended up coming out as fried little pieces of sub-par ""chicken"". We got 5 sauces: mango habanero, spicy BBQ, Thai curry, lemon pepper,and garlic parm. They were all terrible. The garlic parm was HORRIBLE! They squirt slimey, sticky ""sauce"" all over these wings, without a hint of real cheese or garlic and call it good. Lemon pepper was the best, although probably because they were plain fried ""chicken"" and weren't coated in one of their disgusting sauces. Thai curry shouldn't even be a flavor of chicken wings because they were disturbing. Spicy BBQ was nothing original, and on the same level as lemon pepper. Mango habanero were so spicy that we could only eat one each because we didn't want to be in agonizing pain.

We also ordered a side of fries, which were cut skinny and fried crispy. I liked the fries, and tried the salt and vinegar seasoning. The seasoning was tasty for the first couple of bites, but got old very quickly. Overall, we tossed most of the wings because we only tried about 1 of each, when we ordered 30 wings total followed by extreme bloating the following day.

Second time they almost gave us one order for free but being the kind hearted honest hard working type we told them they had to charge us for one of the orders. This comes with after waiting for 20 minutes to get wings we ordered 30 minutes prior online for pickup. They stated that one of their cooks did not show up for work or called out.

Tonight was the last straw though. We ordered online again and I wanted dry rub on the side of my salt and vinegar order. I ordered garlic parm as they put that sauce on the side as well despite the clarification made in the ticket under the notes field on the website. Anyhow....

Love grabbing drink and wings here. My favorite sauce is the hot BBQ. I also like getting the boneless wings. I feel like I get more that way. 

I like that they have mikes hard lemonade. I know, weak drink, but sometimes I just want something other than beer and hard liquor.

Service is always really good here though, servers refill drinks quickly and there are TV's everywhere you go to watch the game.  Lunch specials are available and they even have a frequent lunch card.

3018315,2012-07-27,4,VaKXUpmWTTWDKbpJ3aQdMw,"If you plan on placing an order for pickup with the expectation that it'll be a quick and convenient idea for dinner, think again.

Last night, my sister and I went to this location and placed an order for TWO wraps and an appetizer.  The little girl with a horrible attitude at the pickup desk, ARLENE, read our order back to us and I stopped short when I didn't think I had heard both wraps be read back.  I asked her if she got both wraps to which she nodded her head enthusiastically while my sister joked to her that there was no way our total would only be for one wrap and an appetizer, which ARLENE laughed at with us.

We left for the requisite 15 minutes to Vons and after that time, I went back to get our order.  Arlene brought my bag of food around and opened every container for me to see, but I noticed that there was only one wrap in the bag, so I asked her where the second wrap was.  She tells me, ""you only ordered one.""  I lost it.  I RE-PLACED the order, went outside to grab my debit card and gave it to my sister for her to handle the order...again!

Apparently, my sister voiced her frustrations to this girl and was met with no apathy or readiness to please the customer due to her error.  My sister asked how long it would be for the additional food and Arlene told her it would be another fifteen minutes, at which point my sister expressed how upset she was that the rest of our food would be cold by then. Arlene's respone?  ""There's really nothing I can do about that.""

After waiting an additional fifteen minutes for the rest of our order, Arlene held up the bagged item for my sister who snatched it angrily out of her hands.  Rather than let my sister's anger be the ending to this horrible experience, she closed the night off with a sarcastic and loud, ""Friendly!"" remark to the other waiting customers.  UNACCEPTABLE!!!  

This yelp will be superceded by a call to this location's manager and, if nessecary, further action up the corporate chain.  My advice to Arlene is that if you don't want a job that involves customer service and having to deal with upset customers, especially when you mess up and can't even take responsibility for it, then find something else that would benefit from your limited skill set.",Ner9deZ2TUFxdiRijBpOjA,2,0,1,WbrODObLOP0yDwsZODpsTA

3311281,2011-06-10,1,VaKXUpmWTTWDKbpJ3aQdMw,"I have been a huge fan of BWW's for quite some time now and I still love going there about every week or two. The food is good, the servers are usually pretty friendly, the atmosphere is nice, and the prices aren't too bad. 

First off, the most important thing here, to me, are the wings. I love the traditional wings, but I've been enjoying the boneless lately because sometimes you'll get a gross chicken wing that came from a chicken on 'roids. You know, that super buff chicken that was always a jerk to all the other chickens for not being as muscular as he was... Anyways, those always taste like crap. So I've been sticking to the boneless; they're also more filling. Now the main thing at BWW's are the sauces. They have 14 sauces, 4 dry seasonings, and from time to time they will introduce a new sauce or seasoning, such as Captain Morgan sauce or Thai Curry seasoning. My all time favorite remains the Mango Habanero sauce. As far as the other food, it's really nothing special, some burgers, salads, wraps, and other basic menu items that most American casual dining restaurants will offer. Of course, you can add your favorite sauce to most of the menu items. They also offer a kid's menu and desserts. 

Next are the servers and atmosphere. Most of the times that I have been to BWW's, I have had a pretty friendly server, but there have been times when my server just really sucked. But I guess you will find that with a lot of places and you shouldn't be too concerned about that aspect because it will change by location, time of day, etc.... 
The atmosphere is fun! A bunch of flat screens all over the walls, some projectors, there's music, (which you can pay to pick, jukebox style), playing in the background, trivia games going on, and even games that you can bring to your table and pay to play. They are always showing basketball, football, baseball, soccer, and softball games as well as Nascar races, UFC fights, and other sports events. It's really a family friendly sports bar with good food. 

The prices aren't bad. A plate of wings will cost you from 6-12 dollars, depending on how many you get and if you choose bone in or boneless, which are slightly more expensive. They do have some cool deals though, like traditional Tuesdays when traditional wings are offered at 45 cents each and boneless Thursdays when boneless wings are offered at 60 cents each. Typically, ranch and celery/carrots come on the side at no additional cost, however on these days it costs 60 cents extra for each cup of ranch. 

Buffalo Wild Wings is a good place to grab a quick lunch or to watch the game with the guys and enjoy some good wings and a couple beers. If you haven't been, I would recommend it!",RxOFmw_i8O3kF4bTdjIAug,0,1,4,d4Ivbsq-XgwHay3EkGjv-Q

She then said she would go and grab it from the back for me. Ten minutes later, she came out and said it ""was going to be a few minutes,"" as one of the ""wing orders was extra crispy.""

I waited about five min to get my order. She told me she would go over my order once it's ready but she didn't.

I should've insisted on going over the order because the quality of food was way below bad. The wings were mostly bread and little chicken. They were over cooked. And the worst part was it had very little to no sauce. One of the Parmesan Garlic box that I got had almost no sauce it in that it was like eating chicken nuggets. It was so dry.

Let me say this though. The bartender was great! He was super friendly and made sure our drinks never ran low. He gets an A++. But the food cannot be overlooked. I ordered the snack size of traditional wings with mild sauce and we started with potato wedges with cheese. The potato wedges were okay but honestly a little too salty. The wing sauce was a little spicy to be considered mild in my book and the wings in themselves were super dry and overcooked. I only took a few nibbles before deciding it wasn't worth eating.

If you're with a group consider ordering  the sampler which includes some delicious fresh chips, soft pretzels, some super spicy wings. Ambiance is decent and there's plenty of seating and TV screens around showing all types of sporting events. They also get bonus points for being  having the entire restaurant Nonsmoking ..

I've been here probably ten times. Having a Buffalo Wild Wings in close proximity is .25% of the reason we bought the house in the area. I like what the business does and they usually do it pretty well. However, as happens when you employ actual people, one of them made an honest mistake and put meat on my wife's nachos. Which we didn't discover until I had returned home.

I called them back and relayed the problem (we have dead animal on this stuff. We specifically asked for no delicious animal murder on these chips) and they offered us free food. We said we didn't want free food we just would like an exchange please.
The nachos we recieved looked like the menu. You know how food never looks as good as it does on the menu? These looked like Mario Batali plated our Bdubs nachos. They also *forced* chocolate cake on us. The manager personally apologized. All of this highly unnecessary but very appreciated.

I have come away impressed every time I've eaten here. The beer list is great (this varies from Bdubs to Bdubs) the service is good. The only bad thing is they get full during big UFC events. Completely reasonable.

When I went to this location 7345 S Durango Dr on Black Friday I ordered food and 1 beer while playing video poker for about 30-40 minutes. 
After finishing I cashed out, losing $5 out of $20. Also, during that time I was up to $32. 

When I got the bill the beer was on the receipt, I asked the bartender isn't the drink comp'd because I was playing? 
She stayed that you have to play $20 to get a comp, I said I did play $20. 
She said that you have to lose the whole $20 to get a comp. 
I told her that have never heard that from a Buffalo Wild Wings in Las Vegas before. She said that since the restaurant went corporate 10 years ago it's always been that way. 

So Why don't they state on the machine: play & lose $20 to get a comp drink??

Great establishment.

1 star = for the massive number of TVs they have in the bar, including some huge displays for the big games of the day.  They are willing to seat you near the TV that is playing the game you are interesting in watching.  They are also willing to change the channel for you if the current ones playing aren't of interest.

2 stars = for their selection of drinks.  They offered us green colored beer on St. Patty's day too!

3 stars = for the food!  Besides their wings, they offer quite a selection.  All of their appetizers are awesome.  Make sure to have their soft pretzels; the cheese sauce is amazing and has kind of a curry or cumin kick to it.  Their sliders are huge, and their pita chips w/ spinach dip are yummers!

4 stars = duh! for their wings.  Order them naked so you can try more than one type of dipping sauce; they have lots.  Garlic Parmesan is one of my favorites.

5 stars = for having games to play at your table.  They have trivia to play against other people at the bar as well.

There were a couple of BWW in the Valley in CA that I knew about, but I never gave them a try simply because I was already happy with the food and service at that other place.  I tend to be very loyal to a restaurant once I find one I like.  

This BWW is, literally, less than a mile from our house, so we gave it a shot.  The wings were meaty, the chicken club sandwich was juicy, and the Southwestern Chicken flip that my girlfriend got was delicious.  The service was also very good, albeit a little TOO friendly at times - made it seem as if we were being served by some wings cultists looking for recruits or something.  That's not a complaint (as overly good service is always preferred over the alternative) - it's just that they didn't need to try so hard.

Geesh, long time, and I've gone through phases. I used to love it, then I couldn't go anymore because of health reasons, then I finally went back in moderation and now I love it again.

There are a lot of dishes that could use makeovers, but I'm not here for fine dining, so I order a few select items and I stick to them. I almost always order wings (or ""boneless"" when I'm feeling lazy or don't want to get messy) and potato wedges with Cajun seasoning! Delicious, delicious, delicious. Actually, I only order one sauce now: Chipotle BBQ (well, it's a dry seasoning, but even better because I love seasonings more than sauces). When I'm in a saucy mood, I go for Hot BBQ or Honey BBQ. I've had most of the other sauces and seasonings and they're all good. The potato wedges are just soo good. The chive and onion seasoning and flavorful, crispy exterior creates delicious potatoes. They used to have the Cajun option on the menu, but have removed it for a few years, so just ask for it and they know. And trust me, the Cajun MAKES it the best fries (well, behind duck confit fries..and well, yeah you get the picture; it's not the very best, but it's darn good). Oh, and don't forget the vegetable boat and ranch dressing. Yum.

I'm sure everyone knows about Wing Tuesdays and Boneless Wing Thursdays (and late night happy hour as well?). My brother and I calculated it before and it's only worthwhile when you order a certain amount of wings and if you don't want the veggie boat or dressing/dip (since these are extra on those orders). I like those things, so the wing specials don't matter to me as much.

I've had my share of appetizers and other entrees and for the most part, they're tasty, but not amazing. I do not like their nachos, so I would avoid those if I were you. Also, not very Vegetarian-friendly here; even all their salads have meat, but I'm sure you can order them without the animals.

Oh, and they're open 24 hours. Can't complain!

EDIT (02/26/2013): Now you have the choice of traditional or boneless on Tuesdays and Thursdays don't have a special anymore. Also, I just noticed that they have a black bean burger as a protein option on their menu!! How exciting! And I almost swore them off for Vegetarian eats!

We moved to the area a few months ago, before that, we frequented the Hualapai location. This is the second time I've ordered pickup here and the last.

The first time I ordered a large pack of wings, various sides, and of course a chicken tenders and buffalo chips meal for the kiddo. They forgot the kiddos food, but of course I was charged for it. After setting everyone's plates up and sitting down for the movie, my son opens up his box and all there is is some French fries. I went back to pick it up and caught some attitude from the young lady at the front desk. Not only did she not offer some ranch, chicken, or an apology, they couldn't even offer up a side of manners.

The second time (today) the same thing happened. I figured I'd give them another chance, especially because my family loves the food. Guess what, the tenders and buffalo chips are missing again. I don't know what it is, but maybe that combination is just bad luck. The wife is heading back now to pick up the missing items, since she doesn't want me causing a scene. So I figured I can vent on Yelp instead.

Next time we decide to get bdubs, we'll be driving a little farther.

I was so irritated finally someone comes out says my foods still not ready after stating on the phone it would be ready In 15mins (now 25 mins). 2nd experience today for lunch the greeter was depressing. All she did was stand at the front head on the counter watching tv. Our waitress barely spoke to us other then to take order and check on us maybe twice in an hour in a half.

I tell her I'm missing the Spicy Garlic and she goes back in the kitchen and brings them out. I guess the main reason why I'm so bothered is not because they messed up the order really, even though my bag had a receipt with the exact sauces I asked for. I'm more bothered at the fact that the boxes they gave me were disgusting. It seemed as if the cooks mixed the sauce and wings with their hands and then put them in the box and closed the boxes with their dirty hands.

I've been here a few times in the past, once to a funny/horrible story.  Because everything was handled with such professionalism and grace I'll tell you about it.  

It was approximately a month ago I ordered some boneless Sweet BBQ wings.  In case you've never entered a BWW in your life, Sweet BBQ ranks number 1 out of 28 sauces.  28 being hotter then the sun!  After my first wing my eyes started to tear up.  My server assured me the wings were correct and I continued eating.  After 3 wings I literally broke into a sweat, and told him something was wrong.

The manager came over and took the food back.  When he returned with my new freshly made sweet BBQ he said aloud, ""Those must have been in the frier with the Jalapeño wings.""  He apologized profusely and comped my meal.  Everything was handled professionally and with grace.

 The drinks are good, but no refills on anything but soda, and the wilder flavors of lemonade aren't available to taste, and the waitress told me if I didn't like it I would have to purchase a new one! Whaaaa? Seriously?
 The nachos would have been good, the meat was tasty, except they were covered in so much lettuce we literally didn't know there was cheese on them til the last two! My first bite had gristle in it, and the flavor was exactly like Middle School cafeteria tacos.

I believe  the graveyard wing special no longer exists and its $0.60 tues boneless or bone-in now. I remember when I first moved here in '06 and my sister told me about this great wing place that had $0.25 wings on Tuesdays and I love my wings. My eyes literally got big at the thought of it. What followed was I visiting this B-dubs every tuesday and ordering 3 different sauces of 6 wings each. I worked my way down their heat scale from the mild to hot til I tried them all. Did I say I love wings? haha
The wing special price has slowly creeped up in the past 7yrs sadly and now is more than double what I originally knew.($0.25 to 0.60) Might not go as often as before due to the happy hour not being as good a deal anymore but I'll still go sometimes.
I do try other items on their menu on ocassion but usually I'm there for the wings! My fave sauce has to be the spicy garlic. The fried pickles and their onion rings ain't too shabby either. Service for the most part has been great from the bartenders and waitresses. The few times theres been a problem it was promptly corrected without hesitation.

They don't offer family packs or combos either so that's another downside for me. My husband raved once on how good the Garlic Parmesan wings are so I figured why not try BWW for a change, such poor decision making on my end! Lol.

Food always comes pretty fast even when it's busy, and the food is always ready when they say it will be when I get it to go.

They didn't take off my chicken wings from the bill. As a manager, I would've absolutely AT LEAST comped (taken off) any and all chicken involved with the bill.

Since they didn't acknowledge this as big of a deal as it is (I'm in the medical field and my boyfriend is trained in food safety so it's a big deal to us, as it should be), we will not be returning.

I have never eaten a wing in my life, or at least not that I can remember. I've been a vegetarian for over 11 years and I don't plan on eating any wings in the future either! With that being said, dining at BWW's is a happy medium for me and my dude. Why? Because they have a token black bean burger for me, along with lots of other vegetarian options like flat breads, quesadillas, and your usual neutral appetizers while he gets his wings. Both parties are content! 

SCREAMIN' NACHO BURGER ($9.95?): I always order this with the black bean burger when I come to Buffalo Wild Wings. They used to have a black bean wrap but it's no longer on the menu. Fries are hit and miss. They're usually stingy with the fries. 3.5/5 

SERVICE: Our waiter virtually ignored us. It was difficult to get his attention to order food and ask for refills even though he was standing directly in front of us at the bar. The other couple wanted to order a dessert but gave up because service was so slow. 

VIBE: There was a sports game on but I wasn't paying attention. It was loud inside and pretty busy. 

Worth a Return Visit?
Probably not at this location since it's so far away from where we live. There are 3 other BWW's in much closer proximity, so it doesn't make sense to make the trek out here. Also, this location doesn't stand out at all. I'd rather get crappy service close to home.

If tips went directly to chefs, I would've stiffed him. It was slow, no rush, only about 4-5 parties there and one to-go order.

The manager took our drink order, he brought it to the table quickly once we placed the order. He notified us that the server was busy and would be with us shortly ... time passes ... still not server after 10 mins ... more time passes ... still no server (25 mins had passed) by this time we sat there till 11:00 PM and didn't see our server once, mind you 3 other servers passed us and were tending to there tables with drinks and food so apparently our server got lost. Either way tonight was the last time we will be at this buffalo wild wings because their service is horrible. You don't need a diploma or even a GED to be a server to know 25 mins to greet your customer is to long, so either the server was busy participating in the circle jerk that was taking place in the back or they got lost finding their way to our table to take our order. Either way there are some ignorant lazy ass people that work here. Never had wing stop but that will be the next place we try to get wings from - I'm sure they'll have better service than this place because you can not get any worse than the service at this buffalo wild wings location.

5526749,2013-03-25,1,VaKXUpmWTTWDKbpJ3aQdMw,"Don't come here if you're looking to watch the UFC fights. I started visiting BWW when I lived in the Midwest, I'd go there to watch every UFC fight because they are one of the few places there (or here) that show the fights free.

My boyfriend and I went to this location a few weekends ago. We went to see the Rhonda Rousey fight on UFC. We knew we needed to get there early to get a seat so we showed up over an hour before the pay-per view started. There was a huge wait in the restaurant and I was told I could just go right back to the bar. Well, with the local UNLV basketball game on there wasn't an empty seat in the place. We spoke to a waitress who took our order and opened a tab for us, she told us she knew a few of her tables were not staying for the UFC fights so she'd make sure we got a seat. Well  in short that never happened. A table of hers did open up but when we tried to move there we were told that the manager said we couldn't, he was giving it to a couple who was 'on the list up front'. I was pretty upset because we'd been waiting nearly an hour at this point, the fights had started and when I'd gone up front they told me I didn't need to be on a list. The waitress told us that the manager promised he'd find us seats because she'd told him we'd been waiting. Well, needless to say it never happened.

After standing in a crowded bar for well over an hour one spot opened up at the bar so I was finally able to stand and my boyfriend had to continue standing behind me. Not exactly our idea of enjoying the fight. We were finally able to order food once I sat down, but we had to cash out our tab with the first waitress so she could move our tab to the bar. It was a hassle to have to pay and tip twice.

Sure it's nice to have no cover to watch the fights. But I'd rather pay a cover and be able to have a seat. Needless to say, we won't be coming here to watch the fights anymore.",m2vjSXdfs19kNnqUUpAmOQ,1,1,2,FFq82SHa6HAPV8ZtCUGUUw

Been coming here ever since they opened (6-7 years ago?) because our house is just around the corner, and it's always been a great experience.  So no, their food isn't French Laundry, it's just wings and other bar foods.  But I'm going to give it 5-stars based on one thing - the Mango Habanero wings!  I've had this at other BW3s before, but they're not 5-star-worthy.  This one is.  Mango-y but not too sweet, big time habanero that is fiery hot and does justice to this sauce being the 3rd hottest out of the 1000 sauces they have.  I'm just scared for #1 & 2...

The other sauces are also great (maybe not 5-star worthy), and their burgers are really good as well which was a pleasant surprise.  Service is great all-around, especially the pretty sweetheart at front.  And this place is just hopping all the time with great vibe and lots of TVs.  Just such a fun place, if you can get a seat!

So 4-star value on the food except the 5-star Mango Habanero, at least 4-star service and a can't-fail 5-star enjoyment all rolled into a place walking distance from the house.  How can you go wrong?

Anyways, this location is a decent size. The service is ""on point"" though. They are usually very quick on seating you. Just like all the other reviews - BWW is the perfect place to watch your sports shows. It gets really packed and full of energy during college basketball season, especially when the Rebels are playing.

My go-to order is a toss up between the honey bbq, chicken parmesan, and mild wings. I almost always have to get a regular order of french fries or potatoe wedges with cheese. It's a must in my book anyways. They have a good drink menu. I love their bahama mama - its the perfect fruity drink for me.

To sum it up, if you're craving wings and are on the west side. Don't forget to hit this location up.

Tip: Try to go on a Tuesday or Thursday for their discount price on traditional and boneless wings. If you like traditional go on Tuesday and if you're a fan of boneless go on Thursday.",VhkjxxBz-A4M-mMncpn1ZA,3,0,4,BY1HY-kMjU-COC2_4NHQGg

I had been craving wings for a few days now, and it was late. Most places were closed, so we decided to stop by this location. Which I'm a bit embarrassed to admit, but I didn't really even know this location existed lol..

We were getting the food to go. When entering we waited about 5mins before anyone greeted us. There were a couple of employees sitting in a booth. I guess it gave us time to look over the menu. The place was empty, except for one or two customers at the bar.

Once we were ready, which was instantly, we kinda already knew what we wanted lol.. I asked the young lady if the spinach artichoke dip was still served with pita chips instead of the tortilla chips. Because some locations still do it and since I had never been to this one, I wanted to make sure before ordering it. If they no longer did it, then I wasn't going to order it. No big deal.
She wasn't sure at first and then she said yes. So then I asked her if she was sure and she replied yes again! So I went ahead and ordered it. We also ordered some wings and a salad.

We decided to wait for our food at the bar, figured we'd have a drink while waiting. As I sat down my friend went to the restroom, there were about three people behind the bar. After 5mins or so my friend comes back from the restroom and not one ""bartender"" had approached me or even acknowledged that i was there. I tried grabbing their attention a couple of times but I guess they were too busy.. when the bartender approached me and asked if we wanted anything, our food was already ready so we didn't get a drink..

I knew I should have checked the food before leaving but I was already a bit irritated so we just left.
When we got home, I went straight for the dip since my mouth was watering just thinking about it. When I opened it, I wasn't even surprised that they messed up! Smh, they gave me tortilla chips instead of the pita chips that I specifically asked for! And to top it off the dip wasn't that great! (yes we still ate it) the wings were delicious and so was the salad. 

But the service, for a bww establishment is not that great! I will stick to my original location..",3ajSADFnm71e_Zcip_igWQ,3,2,2,mw1m0xKNFCf8A3AzSgKPhQ
5846880,2009-03-10,0,VaKXUpmWTTWDKbpJ3aQdMw,"Went there really late (10:30pm). It was pretty empty, so we got full attention from the waitress. The food is great though. I had the bbq wrap, which was made perfectly to balance with the meat and the lettuce. Mmm. The sauce in it was yummy. 

This is would be a great place to just hang out with friends and eat great wings. Must visit again when I'm there.",vG12lnFWhWxMn36omvbl5w,0,0,4,kfP9A_fI8QfoIZnvfULwRQ

I chose this location cause I was in the area and wanted to try their happy hour apps.
They have $3 apps, such as mozzarella sticks & mini corn dogs. Both were excellent for the price! The bar area is huge, with gaming on one side and plenty of seating for trivia/socializing. 
I don't watch sports, but you can't ignore the oversized TVs all over. Luckily, the volume was not up on them.",Kp5KHBSmV-Htc9NeSjJfPA,0,0,4,2IsaB-zxQdws7Nwm2RMqbA

5918463,2018-03-08,0,VaKXUpmWTTWDKbpJ3aQdMw,This is the last time I let this place get me. They're inconsistent with their saucing and drink mixing. Every time I come here I get a different experience. I get very little sauce on my wings(to the point where I have to ask for a side of sauce) and a good margarita and the next time perfect sauce and a watery margarita with no salt(i ask for lots of salt). This is really close to my house but after 7 visits I can't take it anymore! Today I came to celebrate an achievement at work and had to leave before they brought me down. Very disappointing.,mDE-5kLLbwEPl04AMRARTA,0,0,2,quXqusClb3nFPrdl415JSg
5921298,2013-03-16,1,VaKXUpmWTTWDKbpJ3aQdMw,"Service here is pretty good. I like my wings boneless, atomic and honey BBQ flavors are my faves. My daughter orders from the kids menu, she likes honey BBQ and her order come with fries. We always order nachos but never finish it. Their cocktails are good as well. Come during when the wings are cheap. Its a bit packed but its always exciting, ESP. On a game or fight night, they have multiple t.v.'s and projectors on each wall.. The crowd is good. Not to mention, this place is kid friendly and he bar is an option but for me personally, I have a 6 year old and we both like the booth. They are pretty decent in their cleanliness and staff is attentive esp. when they aren't busy but it also depends on the server.",at41ymjb1OVu34ii08bCEw,1,1,4,qBod8qf6dEmxyCfBVZwk6g
5923690,2009-04-02,0,VaKXUpmWTTWDKbpJ3aQdMw,"I eat here every once and a while.  It's not too far from where I live and sometimes you just feel like some wings.  Now in terms of wings, I would ranks this place as average.  I've gone to a wing joint in Cali called Wing Nuts and their wings are far better.

Service is good, fun at times depending on who you get.  The bar has a decent selection of drinks. (Edit:  Now corp owned, the drink selection has shrank)   The food normally comes out quickly.  I tried to work my way up the heat scale and got almost to the top.  However, my efforts were wasted one night when I drank too much and had spicy chicken sitting in my beer filled gut all night.  Let's just say that my esophagus has never been the same.  That pretty much ended my spicy food career.

On some nights the music gets a bit loud and you have to yell at your buddies to converse.  But all in all it's a good spot to get some wings if you're in the area.",aj2pS6AFVlzKDDUrisIRaA,0,0,4,1C4ux-wZh0-7_0tyRtYFtg

We don't really frequent Buffalo Wild Wings, but during football season the place beckons us. It's one of the only places I can convince my fella to go during the day on a Sunday. They obviously have great football viewing as well and a huge variety of wing flavors. My fella always goes for the spicy garlic and I order the mango habanero and a large cup of water. 

The service is really attentive and friendly which is impressive since they get so busy. 

Definitely a great place for sports viewing and spicy wings, 24 hours a day.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,5,4,4,yeq4VtsJYCHIPFDMM2F0IA

The servers were rude, and I told them it was my birthday but they just gave  us a dirty look and speech that they don't do that here. (Free small dessert) Really?? It's Vegas  I used to love coming here but the drinks tasted like juice and we were given an attitude by the bartenders who were serving us. We gambled over 20 bucks and because of that we should have been comped a free drink. Instead they gave an attitude and refused to comp us.

5996351,2017-05-25,0,VaKXUpmWTTWDKbpJ3aQdMw,"Use to come here for wing Tuesdays. When it is busy expect the service to be super slow and sometimes you only see your server twice. Once for the order and once to get the check. They have a nice selection of different flavors which is nice. 

Sometimes the food is fresh and sometimes it tastes like it's literally been sitting under the warmer for hours. It is a hit or a miss with the amount of traffic that is present at the time you actually go. 

I usually get the honey bbq bone in wings and my husband loves spicy so he gets the mango habanero. Occasionally, he gets a burger, I believe it's the jalapeno burger.",P0rGN5mDue55uIiAzkrRlw,0,1,3,xB2uIrG534u9tmB0SciF-g
