It's a great addition to those who live in the SW side of town, and they do have tasty pastries. I guess I'm biased because I had really high expectations on coming here from all the reviews, and it's been in my bookmarks for some time now. It's clean, and good compared to other asian pastry shops here in town, but if you ever travel outside of Vegas, you'll see that there are places that can execute the balance of flavors a little better. If I could give it 3.5, I would. We tried the coffee jelly, tiramisu, and green tea cream puff. They're all fine, but I didn't finish any of them, which is unusual for me. Even though I'm only giving it 3 stars for now, I do encourage you to give it a try to taste something different here in Vegas!",dl69uaA2E0Ee2x7kyhNWQA,0,0,3,eaoLDo2Jc1SNLqO4ltEoPA

They are a bit on the pricier end but I would rather spend my money here where I know I am getting the best. The workers are very kind as well. I bought about five items one time, and they threw in an extra cake! I was very happy.

585025,2013-12-28,0,gqdqnFg2lYeSyS20q2ZK_Q,"My experience at Suzuya will be slightly influenced by the fact that I have been to Japan several times and visited bakeries there. With that said, it really is like someone plucked this quaint establishment right out of Tokyo and placed it in Las Vegas.

The decor is very minimalist, but inviting. There aren't a lot of staff there at any one point, but they are very warm and inviting.

The first thing you'll notice is the pristine case of various pastries up for sale. There is a solid mix of iconic French pastries like mille feuille and cream puffs along with some Japanese inspired treats such as the green tea cake and adzuki cream puff.

If you're in the market for overly sweet pastries however, this may not tantalize your sweet tooth. The pastries here are sweet enough to qualify as dessert, but aren't way too sweet.

My personal favorite was the cream puff! Shuukuri-mu or cream puffs are the first dessert I've ever had in Japan, and I can tell you that Suzuya's cream puffs are a far cry from the 'conbini' cream puffs I used to buy everyday. The cream is joined with custard and the pastry its stuffed in as flaky and semi-sweet. A fantastic addition is the vanilla bean mixed into the cream. It gives this puff so much more dimension that what I'm used to!

I also loved Coffee Jelly, which is made from a very bold blend of coffee. It comes topped with a dollop of whipped cream and they give you half and half as well.

On my way out, I purchased 3 slices of their strawberry shortcake to eat for Christmas. The cake with light and fluffy, and the topping as delicious! It's not strawberry season yet, so I found the largest strawberry on top a bit bitter, but that isn't really enough to not warrant it as a delicious cake.

I'd implore anyone who is intrigued by fancier treats and doesn't require a ton of sugar to satisfy them to check out Suzuya! I can't wait to go back & try their crepes!",vR9Wzismt-kYlctVwR6tBw,1,0,5,k1s0Gui4SvQHuUNSdnB_eA

After about 15 minutes of waiting in line to order, I made it to the counter and placed my order for slices of cake to bring home to my family to sample. I got the green tea cake, coconut chiffon cake, chocolate cake, strawberry shortcake, and the layered crepe cake with strawberry mousse filling. They packaged my goods for me to go, and I excitedly made my way back home. 

My palate is definitely biased toward Asian flavors, but I guess not when it comes to dessert. These Japanese style cakes had a great, light and spongy texture to the cakes themselves but the fillings and frosting lacked a lot of flavor. To me, everything but the chocolate cake tasted the same and was bland and failed to satisfy my sweet tooth. To be fair though, the chocolate cake was pretty amazing!

Cream puff - freshly made, great vanilla filling - rich and creamy.  a little pricey for what you get.

Chocolate cake - again, small portion, not a ""traditional"" chocolate cake - ""frosting"" was good, cake itself, a little dry.

Strawberry ""crepe"" cake  - multiple layers of crepe and strawberry cream.  The cream itself was amazing - i didn't care for the texture due to the crepes.

Fuji apple pie - looks nice.  could use some more apples, decent flavor - probably better warmed up with some ice cream.

Small shop, tucked away behind an oil change biz - unusual location.

=:: Location ::=
It's pretty far if your usual stomping grounds is the Strip being pretty far out west and a bit south but thankfully, if you take either 215 or Raphael Riviera to get there, it's not too much trouble to get there by car.

=:: Layout ::=
Small little cafe setting with an excellent view of the days offerings in the glass case and of the crepe griddle as they are being made. Very clean and well kept.

=:: Service ::=
Very excellent. I went during the afternoon on a weekday so I'm not sure what busy looks like and how well they handle it but I was greeted upon entering with a smile. I only got cakes and such to go but I will say that they took great care to place my goodies in the box and even taped down some small cardboard tubes to take up any empty space and prevent them from sliding and mixing during my drive back home.

=:: Food ::=
I regret that I didn't get to try any of their crepes but I will go back and update once I do! As I started at all the goodies, I pretty much ended up walking out with nearly one of every thing on one shelf:

* Tiramisu: Was certainly a highlight so much that my roommate and I have decided we REALLY need our own serving next time we go there.
* Green Tea cake/Strawberry Shortcake/Chocolate cake: Of course, I couldn't really eat everything in one sitting so I'm happy to say that their cakes and pastries survive VERY well in the fridge. Cakes were still moist days after and very enjoyable. If you like your cakes light and fluffy, this place is for you.
* Mont Blanc: I will NEVER turn down mont blanc and this mont blanc made my mouth and tummy very happy.
* Yuzu (lemon) Panna Cotta: Whoo! I bit more tart than I was expecting but still very good and creamy.
* Plain Custard & Anko (red bean) cream puff: I prefer my cream puffs to have custard over whipped cream so that was definitely a plus. The anko was interesting in that I wasn't sure if it was just going to be a bit of it squeezed in or if it'd be incorporated into the cream. It's the first and while it's not bad, it's not great either. I suppose they want to be different from Beard Papas which offers a variety of flavors but I think the taste of beans and custard kinda blend too easily and there's no contrast. Regardless, I still scarfed it down!
* Mille-Feuille: I wish I hadn't waited so long to have this because the pastry got soggy but regardless, the flavor was still very good by the time I got to it.

Very happy, must go back to try crepes, both sweet and savory, and anything else I didn't end up getting that day. Really hoping they have strawberry mille crepe cake next time I'm in too!",ZsaaG2KF5PrCRNXH0JyjUg,3,1,5,KBY89s2w45pZ2yUDlKG1Ug

My most recent visit was after the monthly Chaiya Monastery Food Festival with other yelpers. I had ordered the mont blanc (usual favorite item to get) and by recommendation of Nelson and Sylvia, i got the custard pudding as well. 

If you dine in, they'll put your dishes on a japanese style tray, with utensils. Payment is easy through their mounted square system. 

Custard Pudding - very smooth and creamy. Not too sweet. Have a sauce on the bottom, similar to one with a flan. great combination. forms a wonderful medley of flavors 

Mont Blanc - a dessert that is wonderfully prepared. whipped cream in the center, with piped lines of super aromatic, flavorful chestnut paste-like cream around forming the exterior. topped with a perfectly peeled sweet chestnut.

I could really taste the green tea, and the color of the cookie didn't look fake. It's a beautiful emerald green like matcha supposed to look. I think they infused the matcha into it instead of using food dye, which I appreciate! Best matcha macaron I have eaten. I was hesitant to buy the shoyu, but I am glad I did! It was so delicious! The salt particles pair very well with the sweetness and the caramel. The hazelnut latte smelled so good! The coffee taste was strong, I'm not a straight coffee person, but I do like a good latte. I think out of the five, my favorites were the matcha, shoyu, and hazelnut latte. 

Also, I bought a slice of the green tea milliecrepe cake, strawberry shortcake, and one of the animal cream puff. My husband bought the chocolate cake and cream pudding.

The match milliecrepe cake was okay, but it had a little more bean paste than I would like. The strawberry shortcake was delicious!

1404163,2013-05-05,3,gqdqnFg2lYeSyS20q2ZK_Q,"The locals scene in Vegas has been going through a ""renaissance"" as of late. There are more business' that are being created to appeal to the foodies, as well as the uniqueness that this city has to offer, with its diverse clientele. This has to be the most unique pastry shop in all of Vegas. They specialize in Asian (particularly Japanese) style pastries. I've been here many times, having tried almost all the sweets here, and most of the items I have tried have been fantastic. This time, I came here with a bunch of yelpers at  Nelson's UYE event.

Suzuya is located behind the Jiffy Lube in a strip mall, off of the 215 and Durango, heading west. You'll see the sign ""pastries and crepes"" off the road, and turn in there.  (if you went past the Sonic Drive Thru, you've gone too far). The parking lot is shared with the other business', but I have never had trouble finding a spot to park.

Once going in, I was immediately greeted by Chef Misuzu and her staff. The pastry chef Misuzu has had an impressive career, working in some of the best 5 Star 5 Diamond establishments including Alex at the Wynn, and the Aria Resort. And if her green tea cake looks familiar to you all, before opening up her own shop, she was also the pastry chef of the Mon restaurant group (Kabuto, Goyemon, Sushi Mon).

There are tables set up with chairs and wooden benches. This store is kept immaculate. On the service counter there are crepe machines, pastry display cases, a drink station, and a register. Over near the crepe machines, there is a list of crepes that you can order. Don't forget to look above the pastry display case, there are apple pies and tarts available. Order from the display case. Next to the pastries is a refrigerated case, where they keep cold drinks, many of them Japanese made, available. After ordering, I sat down and let them deliver my goods too me, since there was a big line. 

(Note: While Misuzu keeps a lot of customer favorites in stock, she also changes up her desserts, showcasing the seasonality of her pastries, her creativity and the team)

Anmitsu - This popular japanese dessert is one we don't see very often in America. Suzuya's version uses an agar jelly, red beans, fresh fruits, and tofu mochi which gives it a nice chew. I liked the caramel syrup you can pour on top, and it goes well with green tea ice cream. 

Apple Pie - Wow, what a great take on a classic. This one uses a puff pastry-like crust, giving it a extremely flaky texture. The fuji apples used hold their shape well, and the entire dessert is well balanced. Make sure to ask for it warmed, with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.

Tofu Cheesecake - This was probably my least favorite item. While the cheesecake was light and properly made, for my personal preference, it was hard for my palette to get this one, from the tofu. But, others' liked it, so who am I to say?

Rum Raisin Shortbread Sandwich - These little treats were quite delectable. Crumbly, buttery, sablé biscuit sandwiches with rum raisins. The filling was sort of a buttercream, but denser and less buttery, I couldn't figure out what it was, but it was terrific.

B.A.T. (Bourbon Bacon, Arugula, and Sun Dried Tomatoes) Crepe - Even If you're not a big fan of desserts, I urge you to come and try the crepe's at Suzuya, whether sweet or savory ones. These are phenomenal. It is safe to say that the crepe shells themselves.. the best in Vegas. They are sturdy enough to hold the fillings, but once you eat them, they melt in your mouth, letting the fillings shine. This savory crepe is made with bourbon bacon, arugula, avacado, and sun dried tomatoes. All the flavors go extremely well together, and balance out each other. It kept me interested, and wanting more. I could eat 12!!!

I like good pastries... and I LOVE great pastries. Suzuya is a great pastry shop, with a fantastic staff, wonderful food, and a comfortable setting. They are open 10am - 6, every day except Tues. Come try this place out, I am sure you will enjoy it as much as I have.",gtwM4ijo65AN4DvXdgCu_w,12,8,5,5gUVMPDujH_upYnvIZJdSw

The crispy/creamy mixture was heaven in your mouth! Green tea roulade (not pictured because our 2nd time here we couldn't wait for a pic) came in 2nd. It had some candied nuts on the outside and moist cake and redbean & green tea goodness on the inside.   The green tea crepecake was about 13layers...similar filling as the roulade but I got bored with it after a couple bites. Chestnut Mont Blanc was next...if you like the sweet beany, nutty taste of a chestnut get this.  Cheesecake was good, not impressive. Black sesame macaroon(not pictured) was too chewy, I like it on the lighter more delicate, melt in your mouth side.  That being said I'm not quite sure what a macaroon should taste like.

1473557,2015-01-06,0,gqdqnFg2lYeSyS20q2ZK_Q,"I came here with a relative expecting to enjoy some quick service pastries, and with the sophisticated decor, I was anticipating the pastries and crepes to come. The menu was rather small, it was a set menu of specials in addition to some regular items. The pastries looked fabulous inside of the display case. In addition to the crepes and pastries, they also had varieties of beverages that were interesting as well.

I've preciously enjoyed Japanese crepes before from many places, so I had some rather high expectations from the pricey options and higher-level atmosphere.  I had ordered a crepe with bananas, chocolate syrup, almonds, and whipped cream, with ice cream. My relative had ordered a small chocolate layered cake from the display case. 

As for the crepe itself, the process looked very complex and took way too long. I waited as I watched a young woman making the crepe for over seven or so minutes, which is rather long for a thin crepe and some fresh fruit (keeping in mind we were the only ones in line). It was, however, a beautiful process as she lay the bananas down neatly and organized followed by whipped cream and chocolate syrup. While watching, one thing that did bother me was that she would fan the crepe to cool it down. By the time I received it the crepe was cold and also it was honestly rather tasteless. The bananas were ripe and the chocolate syrup was a bit overdone, but it was very difficult to enjoy with a cold and soggy crepe. I prefer my crepes a bit more cooked and also with some more flavor being the entire focus of the dish. The ice cream wasn't anything special either, just some typical green tea ice cream or something salted that was recommended by someone behind the register. 

After having the tasteless crepe and overpowering chocolate syrup, I was expecting something better from the chocolate cake, perhaps something that came together a bit more, but I was wrong. Although the cake was soft, it was also tasteless. 

The process took a long time, the crepe was cold, the food was tasteless, and no one bothered to check if anything was good, as a matter of fact, the staff themselves weren't that friendly either. 

Not coming back any time soon. There are tons of better places out there.",W99gkZTfCBuEZgS_eFn07Q,2,0,2,oFv_jC_ZUuQJ39LQVp2fGQ

They also have cakes, tiramisu... but it's hard to name everything because it gets changed up. I think that's part of the novelty. 

The only reason I knocked it down a star is because while some may see it as special care in preparing and packaging the goodies, the service is always a bit frustrating.

Coffee menu is small, service is very personable but a bit on the slow side. Opted for the ako cream puff (chef special) and green tea éclair (chef favorite). Both were very light, which I appreciated as I am not much of a sweet tooth.
But the dough for both seemed to be the same, overall just seemed very similar despite my effort to try two different items- should have gone for the yuzu pana cotta as I initially wanted, but thought that would be piggish of me.

Super sweet cashier, beautiful desserts and cakes. Will have to return for the yuzu pana cotta and an iced green tea on a hot day. Or a savory crepe for lunch, they sound delish!

This is a cute little place that looks clean and crisp, with a few chairs and tables. Everyone here is super friendly so I would give it a thumbs up for great customer service. However, what disappointment me was the food. I had expected more. 

Mille crepe cake- I question if this one is fresh. It was slightly sticky, dense, and lacked flavor. It had a slight weird spongy texture and taste. I had a hard time getting through it with a fork. Maybe the crepe cakes from Lady M in New York City has set the bar too high (layers of decadence that is flavorful yet not too sweet) but this one just didn't come close. 

Crepe w/ strawberries and whipped cream + 1 scoop of green tea ice cream- This one is probably the best thing I had here. I actually enjoyed eating this crepe. The green tea ice cream here tasted way better than my green tea cake. This one I would recommend eating when coming here.  

Green tea cake- I love my green tea. I drink it on a daily basis. I eat all kinds of cakes or desserts with green tea. I love azuki beans too. So with the combo, I was looking forward to trying this. But this one tasted a hint too bitter and the azuki beans actually tasted a bit weird with the green tea. The green tea, azuki beans cream, and the chocolate brought together a flavor that was actually weird and unpleasant. A hint too much of artificial flavoring. I took 2 bites and I was done. 

Mont Blanc (chestnut)- The best part is that chestnut on top. But the rest wasn't all too exciting. It had too much cream. The chestnut flavor tasted too artificial. I thought it tasted weird and nothing like chestnut flavor.  

Strawberry shortcake- Not sure what is the hype with this one. I thought it was decent. It just taste like a strawberry cake. 

Amount spent: Around $25. 

Overall, I think their crepes are pretty good. Everything else, I would probably skip. The customer service here is great. Everything looks really cute. I like the box they placed the cakes in. 

Would I come here again? Maybe when I'm having a crazy crepe craving and happen to be in the neighborhood...",O_3ceyOjYpXxLxboGfusYA,1,1,3,Jv1nOBq5cLKZwfc3yhOM6Q

Here's what we ordered, and to be honest, just get them all, and more, you won't regret it!

Mille Crepe -many layers of thin crepe with cream in between.
Green tea cake -OMG!
Mille feuille -aka Napolen. layers of puff pastry with cream and fresh fruits.
Strawberry cream puff -I didn't wanna get it initially cuz after all it's just a cream puff, right? Well, I am so glad I let the kids ordered this. the cream is so good!

I gotta say... It is TINY!!! I think there was 1 table and a few bar seating along one of the walls with 2 tables outside but in this heat there is no way I would be sitting outside. I ended up not staying to eat as the table was taken and there were already a few people sitting at the bar area. Ambiance besides the lack of seating was cute. Very very tiny....:) 4/5 service was great tho...I was greeted as soon as I walked in and as soon as I was ready to order they were right there to take it. Awesome service! 5/5

They also had a small display... And what caught my eye were the macarons....I love love love love macarons and from the looks of them they looked like they were made in house and not bought. It's a pet peeve of mine when a coffee shop/Bakeshop that sells baked goods sell macarons that are manufactured by a machine instead of being handmade. Yeah I know I'm weird. Machine made ones never have that great texture... That chew I'm looking for. The macarons there were amazing!!! Perfect crunch and that perfect chewy texture... So freaking good!! I know now where to get my macaron fix when I don't have time to make them. :) I got 4 and most of the flavors were good but the black sesame was kind of disappointing in the fact that the flavor was lacking. It was just didn't have that strong black sesame flavor that I was looking for. But texture on all of them were great! Most were 5/5.

I also got the strawberry mille feuille... This is more like Lady M's crepe cakes not a true mille feuille... And it was ok... But can I just say that I'm really over the whole pipette craze? I was amazed at how much of the strawberry jam they were able to get into it but the flavor was just not that great. It tasted like it had been sitting there for a bit. The crepes were a little on the soggy side with the top layer being a little on the tough side. 2/5

I will definitely be back... Most likely I will try something else... But the macarons... Oh yeah... I'll definitely be back for those. :)",L3DxG0n3lRq5N2lv1QNrrA,3,5,4,Acc2P01DWY6YhOTuXPrctw

Have bought cakes here usually for a small group of people and it doesn't break the bank. We've ordered the Strawberry, Fruit and Coconut Chiffon cakes, all of which looked & tasted great. Never complete without a personalized cookie placard!

Other items I've tried: (from most to least fav)
-Mont blanc (not for those with a nut allergy, sweetest dessert I've tried there)
-Custard pudding (creamy with hint of vanilla, simple ingredients, great dessert)
-Mango Tart  (seasonal, mangoes are nice and ripe, beautiful presentation)
-Fruit tart (crust is buttery, love it, best crust I've had)
-Apple pie (bf loves this, not loaded with spices, best eaten warmed at home)
-Strawberry Mille crepe cake
-Green tea cake (preferred the version they had when they first opened)
-Coffee jelly (fresh cream on side, non-coffee drinkers will like this too)
-Creampuff
-Yuzu panna cota (wasn't a fan, too tart for my taste)

Crepes are made to order. Light, simple, and with the right amount of filling/toppings; you can actually appreciate the taste of the actual crepe. It's the closest we can get to our favorite crepe place in San Francisco. We get the strawberry with homemade nama cream, sometimes with ice cream. Easy to eat when rolled into a cone.

I am so glad to discover this away from the strip gem. Now I have a place where I can grab fancy little treats without having to travel all the way to strip and truck my way through a busy crowded casino to indulge in beautiful desserts.

The reviews all have pretty much the same thing to say about how the cakes have no flavors and even though I have to agree I didn't have any this visit to judge but I did have some during Christmas when a customer of mine brought in a roll and the cake part itself was a little bland. But then again I know how Asian bakery or cakes are a little more on the dense and not too sweet side. With that said that's the only reason why I docked them 1 star, otherwise I would have given them a full 5 stars.

I hate the Suzuya is right around the corner from me because I usually order too much stuff for two people (me and my husband). I have to space my visits apart to ensure I don't have to regularly buy new (bigger) pants. 

Though I've visited twice on the way home from work, it's best to arrive at or close to opening to ensure the widest selection possible. Whatever time you come, rest assured that the pastry will be flaky, the custard creamy and flavorful, the presentation cute AF, and the service friendly and attentive. 

My personal favorites are the yuzu pana cotta, strawberry mille crepe, cream puffs and millefeuille. The latter is flaky pie dough layered with vanilla custard cream. The pastry is buttery and perfectly crisp.  All of the cream puffs are well done, but I especially enjoy the strawberry and chocolate flavors. The filling on the chocolate cream puff is reminiscent of a quality chocolate ice cream, but stuffed into pastry. What's not to love? You also can't go wrong with the matcha selections. Duh. 

One should keep in mind:

- This is an Asian-influenced bakery. Don't expect something over-creamy, over-saccharine, or over-anything. What makes the treats here so great is that they're balanced or, as all my aunts would put it, ""they're sweet, but not too sweet.""

- Parking is shared with Jiffy Lube. Watch out for those maniacs speeding through looking for an oil change 

- The cafe area is small, but super cute.

- There's a loyalty program now, which means my gluttony will now be rewarded. So long, current pants...

Now let me preface this review: these treats are Japanese in style. In general, I find that Asian pastries tend to be a little less sweet, rich and dense. It is its own esthetic that not everyone will be a fan of. So if you're looking for a really gooey chocolate chip cookie or a slice of uber luxurious cheesecake, you'll probably be disappointed. You have been warned.

Ah - what can I say about Suzuya Pastries? 

Hidden behind a quick lube joint, you probably would miss it if you were driving too fast. Limited parking is also an issue due to the numerous shops (a nail salon, the quick lube, etc.) in such a small retail space.

But no matter. A trip to this bakery will take you less than 10 minutes. There really is no place to sit and eat because of the size of the shop (there's two small tables and maybe four chairs in the store). I'd imagine most people get the pastries to go. The selection is small so come earlier before it's all gone.

The time I went, I selected the Mont-Blanc chestnut cake, a kabocha pie and an apricot/almond pie. I did so to sample their two variety of crusts (a shortbread crust, a puff pastry crust) and their sponge. Suffice to say, I was genuinely impressed.

If you could only use one word to describe the Suzuya's pastries it would be this: symphony. They have a precision of flavors and textures that makes every note in your mouth sing. That's right - this place is the Ode to Joy of pastry perfection. It is a marriage of subtle spicing/sweetening (to enhance but not overwhelm the ingredients) and excellent technical skill.

The Mont-Blanc cake is sponge cake layered with pastry cream and chestnut puree. The sponge cake flavor is just right - not too heavy handed on vanilla. With all the pastry cream, it retained a wonderful texture despite all that moisture. Chestnut purees tend to be overly sweet but they were perfect here.

Kabocha pie - what a wonderful idea! It was a Japanese take on pumpkin pie and truly I was floored. What perfection of puff pastry crust! When it comes to pies, it's hard to find a pastry crust that is equally flaky even on the bottom. Well, lo and behold, Suzuya has it down to a science. The filling to pastry to ratio was just right as well. 

Finally, the apricot/almond pie. This was the husband's favorite pastry. A crispy shortbread crust adorned with glazed apricots and moist almond filling. So good and it was the special of the day.

If I have one criticism of this place, it is the prices. The three items I purchased added up to $12-ish. For the price, it would be nice to have a larger portion size for each of the desserts. However, that being said, I have paid way more for dessert elsewhere and received significantly less enjoyment.

Overall, for some amazing Asian pastries, this place is a 5 starred place in my books.",h9RUaaHa5kcQKqtJ-sgS0Q,9,10,5,erwEPS0VzKH6sxCy4da4hw

Since I was there after 5pm, there weren't a lot of items left, but I still snagged an apple pie, a piece of chocolate cake, and a piece of strawberry shortcake.  The thing I most appreciated about my items was that they were not too sweet.  While I am a fan of sugar and buttercream and frosting, I do enjoy tasting the actual ingredients in my baked goods.  The Fuji apples in my little pie were well-spiced and bursting with flavor, providing great textural contrast to the pastry.  Both the chocolate cake and the shortcake featured alternating layers of cream filling and delicate cake; in addition, the robust dark chocolate shavings on the chocolate cake provided tooth resistance and melted satisfyingly on my tongue.

2255953,2014-04-15,4,gqdqnFg2lYeSyS20q2ZK_Q,"I'm half scared to write this review in fear that my favorite Japanese bakery in Vegas will become overrun with hordes of people. Nonetheless, this place does really deserve recognition for their quality and service.

This very small shop only bakes a limited amount of pastries daily. They have their regular stock of goods daily such as the green tea cake, strawberry cream cake, and anko (red bean) cream puffs. The first two are good but not astronomically mind blowing and I would honestly skip the cream puff.

DAT APPLE PIE THOUGH. Rumored to be the best apple pie in Vegas, it looks deceivingly plain compared to the other desserts and pastries. Sitting directly on top of the refrigerated dessert display, one might make the unforgivable mistake of not even noticing the pie. Get it, try it, and love it! Ask them to warm it up for you in the oven if you plan on sitting and chilling there for a bit. If you're feeling like a slight masochist and glutton, add a scoop of vanilla ice cream to it as well. The crust is perfectly flaky but still not too dry. The filling has the perfect amount of sweetness. Combined together they make a heavenly combination almost as perfect as Brad and Angie, Elsa and Anna, peanut butter and jelly, hot cocoa on a cold rainy day, etc. 

They also offer seasonal special pastries depending what fruits and produce are in season. For summer it's usually mango desserts and for fall it's kabocha (Japanese pumpkin/squash). My favorite specials are the mango tiramisu and the mango mille crepe. 

As previously stated, they only bake small batches of goods so the earlier you go get your pastries, the better. They sometimes start running out of popular items around 2/3 p.m. You can call and ask them to reserve a certain pastry for you if you already know what you want.

Customer service is on point. The patissiere, the nice young Japanese lady, is always there whenever I go. She always greets everyone with a big smile. 
You can really see she's got a passion for what she does.

Desserts are a bit more on the pricier side but then again, this is a small bakery that serves good quality goodies.",EHssES-7rmOl6yFNwXVWiw,7,3,5,ghUfiej9W93ckoWUWlMyCA

They also make suggestions if you can't decide. Interior of the place is very clean and hip. Everything is moderately priced from $3-5 dollars per item for the pastries. I usually get about 4-5 items to go each time I go in. The to-go boxes are absolutely adorable and well made, you don't have to worry about to go items getting messed up or smashed. 

I got 5 items around Mothers Day, and my mom thought I had paid well over 50 dollars for everything just because how nice the box was and how professional the pastries looked.

- James Taylor 

I'm a sucker for yuzu & cream. Suzuya's Yuzu Panna Cotta is an excellent form of this pairing and one of my go-to items at Suzuya. 

I don't know what it is about this charming space specifically, but I almost enjoy stepping into the quaint pastry shop that is Suzuya as much as I enjoy eating their delicious offerings...ALMOST, that is.

Suzuya has its staple items that you will regularly find, but just as significant are the seasonal specialties--typically made with whatever fruits are in season at the time. Sometimes it is easier to remember the lovely seasonal items when they are no longer available...like their Mango Milli Crepe Cake, or Kabocha Pie/Tart, the final of which I enjoy enough to alter the otherwise beautiful lyrics of James Taylor in my opening quote...but it is that good...so good that Taylor would change the lyrics himself if he had the chance to try it. 

I realize that this review is quite late to the Suzuya party...I've been coming for years with a daft for almost as long...long enough to think I already published the review, but if you're new to Suzuya or looking for a place to start they have several popular items including their Custard, Green Tea Cake, Cheesecakes (blueberry is wonderful when available), Strawberry Shortcake, Crème Puffs...oh, and crepes...strawberries and cream and rocky road are popular options for their crepes, but as with the pastry case, it's hard to choose poorly if it's something you think you'll like as so much of Suzuya's pastries and crepes are incredible. I'm not much of a cake fan, but when my love asked me where I wanted a birthday cake from, I knew I wanted it to come from Suzuya",A5A34ixb-yy6nwL42iZsnw,13,10,5,tBnjasTwdu2t8IAHlz5FUg

For all those who ordered a cake in advance: make sure you pick it up the day you said you would, if you come in a day later they will not give you your cake or issue a refund!
I ordered a cake for thanksgiving and was supposed to pick it up a day before the thanksgiving, but got caught up at work. I called them to inform that I cannot get out of work on time to get the cake, and that I will come to get it the next day (they were open until lunch). The cake was already paid for. I was told that it is impossible, that they cannot give me my cake or a refund the next day. I spoke to the manager, and asked a reason why they cannot give me my prepaid cake before. All I got in response was: ""it's our policy, u get it today or get it at all."" I ordered cakes from other bakeries and none of them would take advantage of their customers like that, they would happily save the prepaid cake so you can get it a day or two later.

The green tea log was very good also. The green tea flavor was rich and again, the cake was pluffy. My husband loved it.

2798898,2016-10-23,3,gqdqnFg2lYeSyS20q2ZK_Q,"Having been here a few times over the years, I can safely say this is one of my favorite bakeries in town. Desserts have a subtle sweetness making them good for a light snack or the perfect ending to a meal, as opposed to heavy desserts that you would instantly regret. Their cheesecake is unlike traditional cheesecakes you'll find in the states, with a light, airy mousse-like texture. Yuzu panna cotta has a smooth and creamy consistency with hints of citrus. The mango mille crepe is light and delicate with layers of pastry cream and mango between each crepe. Apple pie lovers will fall in love with their version. It's a rectangular work of art with flakey and buttery pastry covering sweet, caramelized Fuji apples.

If you want something more savory, the B.A.T. crepe is the way to go. Bourbon bacon, arugula, sun-dried tomatoes, mayo, avocado, and balsamic vinaigrette are wrapped in a crepe. The result is a mouth-watering combination of salty, acidic, savory flavors .

Ambience/Customer Service: As I came, my brother and I were greeted by a ""good afternoon!"" And I just started looking around , then the cashier asked if I've been there before and answered all the questions I had and it was fun looking. Honestly I was just such a little kid about everything because the display was really pretty and I wanted to try sooo many things but you know, my wallet was on a diet. The table settings were fancy, with marble table tops and high chairs. It was very clean and I liked that (I mean duh who doesn't!) but this place was impeccably clean. And whoever did the interior design, good job! I felt good and welcome. 

Prices: I mentioned earlier that my wallet was ok a diet, and I was not going to spend more than 15 dollars. And yayyy I got 2 cakes and a decent size tea within my budget. The cakes are around 3-4 dollars and it was just more than reasonable. I could go to the strip and get similar cakes for double the price. So this made me and my wallet happy :) 

Food: So on the day I went I tried the strawberry shortcake and the Tokyo cheesecake. Let me just tell you; the strawberry shortcake is a taste of happiness and strawberry goodness. It was sweet but not overly sweet, and felt like biting into a fluffy cloud. YUM! The Tokyo cheesecake, was not my cup of tea, but it was still yummy in my tummy! It too was sweet but not as sweet. I really like how the cut of the cakes were perfect too. I ordered nitro hibiscus tea and it was good because it canceled out the sweetness in the cakes but not too much and so I never got too tired of the cakes. The hibiscus tea was pretty fruity in taste and tarty, but I know a lot of people who like tea of this flavor. This too was not my favorite but a perfect mix of what I had ordered. I can tell the pastries and cakes were made with quality and it makes all the food taste much more better! 

Overall: Overall I really like this place and hope they grow to be bigger. Keep up wit the great customer experience and with them perfect cake slices.",Sv86YO6HyKB4xeauqH2MZA,3,2,5,47R7jR0BPBd_L660WGFyrQ

Hands down by far the best crepe place we have tried in Las Vegas. I'm a sucker for Nutella crepes. I'm kind of basic and don't like to step out of my comfort zone, but I know what I like and how I like it when it comes to a Nutella crepe. At Suzuya, they are always consistent. Warm, filling and large. Normally, a basic Nutella crepe wouldn't fill me up, but these do. 

My wife always gets something different and always gets at least 3 pastries. Her favorites are the blueberry and green tea cream puffs, strawberry shortcake, green tea cake and the fruit tart. She is always extra satisfied when she eats her food from here. When she's happy with her food, I know it's going to be a good experience. 

We always speak with the owners when we come in and they always remember us. That says a lot about how their standard is when it comes to customer experience. 

Today, is a busy Saturday at the shop. They have hired a pretty hefty staff, with at least 6 people working right now. If you've been in, you know it's a small spot. That speaks a lot on how busy they are getting! They don't have an empty seat in the house!

They had so many delicious looking Asian-inspired pastries and sweets. The prices are similar to what you'd find in Southern California, around $3.50-$5 for the larger desserts and around $2 for the cream puffs and macaron. 

I got the green tea and red bean cake that everyone has been raving about and the coconut chiffon cake. The green tea cake was lighter than most western style cakes and had a very faint matcha taste. In between the layers was a red bean frosting which was really flavorful and grainy in texture. I was hoping for a stronger green tea flavor from the cake but the matcha frosting on top was really strong and delicious. Too bad there wasn't more of it. Overall a delicious cake, especially for red bean lovers but not enough green tea. It was around 4.25

The coconut chiffon cake was heavenly. It was the best chiffon and/or coconut cake I've had in my life! It was so fluffy and light, like a cloud, and not overly sweet at all. The coconut flakes weren't too hard either. I wish I ate a whole cake. This is a must try, especially for just $3.60!",Fde33HEt0pjq35WsNv7RmQ,3,1,5,cG4DlUtIq3X98Ck2_rmn5g

This place is hidden so I would have to definitely say this is a hidden TREASURE BOX for sure. They are located BEHIND a body shop so you would never be able to find it just by driving on Durango dr. The inside decor is simply cute & small. All their desserts are displayed in the fridge for you to pick & choose. Along w/ their pastries, they have yummy soft crepes as well! 
.
The  staff members are ALWAYS super sweet & attentive & happy, but honestly I would be freaken happy everyday too if I worked in that pastry shop!

The pastries for MOST of them have just the PERFECT textures & not overwhelming SWEETNESS. I believe it is these factors that make you simply CRAVE this place consistently. 

CANNOLLI CREPE $4.75 - I am obsessed w/ this crepe cuz it has a little crunch from the pistassio & I like to add nutella for a little more flavor

GREEN TEA CAKE $4.25 - This was simple w/ a little crunch. The cake part wasn't dry.

MONT BLANC $4.75 - I seriously love this mont blanc... it's not like my favorite from raku sweet, but it's comparable when I need a quicky craving fix

TIRAMISU $4.75 - This is my style of tiramisu... lots of cream & a strong espresso KICK

BLACKBERRY CHEESECAKE $4.5 - velvety smooth & very light on the blackberry flavor

TOKYO CHEESCAKE $3.75 - This was a bit disappointing since it was super DRY =[
YUZU PANNA COTTA $3.75 - I don't think I like yuzu as a dessert 
 
COCONUT CHIFFON CAKE $3.6 - I could eat a WHOLE CAKE to myself no problem! Super fluffy & the cream makes it nice & moist

CHOCOLATE CAKE $3.95 - just a simple cake that is NOT overwhelmingly sweet

Service is friendly and excellent which you can always expected from Japanese store.  I have the Ham and Cheese Crepes which is Awesome. I do order lots of pastries and cakes because my wife love sweet, while I have my crepes, the staffs have my order ready and store in the fridge for me so my cakes are nice and cool when I get out. I order 6 different cakes (blueberry cheesecake, strewberry shortcake, tiramisu, mont blac, regular Tokyo cheesecake, and green tea millecrepes) and apple pie. I will have more pictures and update once I have all their cakes. 

Try (Green Tea Millecrepes, Toyko Cheesecake,  and Tiramisu) tonight... My wife like the Green Tea and Tiramisu the most... Green Tea Millecrepes: remind me traditional Japanese sweet. Green Tea and Sweet Red Bean compliment each other.
Toyko Cheesecake: Different then the American cheesecake which is more dense. The Toyko Cheesecake is more light and fluffy.

There are only a few tables, I believe two or three tables, there was only one group of two there when I went, they happened to be speaking Japanese too.

I went without knowing what to expect, as I've been disappointed with Japanese food in Las Vegas (being from Japan and spending most of my life there, I tend to know what tastes authentic). But to my surprise I was quite pleased with this place! 

I got the strawberry shortcake and green tea cake. They were about $2-4 each (will check prices next time), but that's actually basically considered ""normal"" in Japan so I don't mind the prices too much. 

The strawberry shortcake tasted just like the ones I've had in my local bakeries back in Japan, there's a slight difference, but it's hardly noticeable. I will definitely be getting more of them! They aren't sweet and some may not like it because it definitely isn't like American sweets at all. It's like a sponge cake base but it is not as fluffy as American sponge cake, it may seem a little bland to some (my friend felt it was bland). 

The green tea cake is just like matcha green tea taste. If you're a fan of green tea and something not super sweet this is another good one, it also tastes like the ones from Japan as well. 

The two I've tried so far have very authentic tastes from Japan, I will definitely be coming back to try other things!",dM1HHK4szA5Qs6NSAaEk1Q,4,2,4,66nlfPNjr0Srh8NdxAx58A

After browsing online and reading all the positive reviews, I decided to go for it. Their website is very clear and organized with good descriptions and pictures of all their cakes. Unfortunately, the only negative thing for me was that the Tokyo Cheesecake only comes in one size. Because I had a large party to serve, I ended up picking two cakes. I called in and ordered a Tokyo cheesecake and Strawberry Shortcake and just hoped that I made a good choice. 

When I got there, I ordered an iced coffee which tasted AMAZING. I highly recommend if you are a coffee lover. I also love the detail of their strong plastic personalized coffee cup. Anyways, I saw everyone eating their house-made custard pulin so I decided to get one of those too. It was really good, the perfect amount of sweetness and reminded me of a Taiwanese pudding that I love, but better because it was freshly made. There were so many other desserts that I really wanted to get like the yuzu panna cotta and their mille crepe cakes but I'll just have to come back at some point. 

Both the cakes I ordered were delicious. Fresh, light and beautifully decorated. Everyone loved it. The location is a little far from the strip but it's totally worth it if you are looking for a quality Japanese style cake that is light and not super sweet. Can't wait to come back!

All their pastries look so perfect in their display window, that it seems such a shame to eat them.  The portion size is small, but I will come back and try one of their pastries so other time.  Today, I was just there with one thing in mind, a crepe.  I ordered the banana and chocolate crepe with green tea ice cream inside.  Although I am not an expert in crepes, I felt that this crepe was made a little too thick and was not crispy at all.  I just remembered how wonderful Marion Crepes was when I was in Tokyo's Harajuku (Takeshita dori) and I am a little disappointed with this one.  The first crepe they tried to make on the griddle didn't turn out, so they had to start all over.  There is quite the technique to make the perfect crepe, and obviously the first crepe did not pass their quality control.  It looked okay to me.  I felt like saying to her, it's okay, I will eat it anyway.  But like I said before, they are perfectionist at their craft.  The finish product looked great.  The crepe batter was quite tasty, and the combination of flavours wasn't bad.  I just wished that the crepe was a little more crispy and thin.

I have tried for weeks to get my hands on the infamous green tea crepe cake, but to this day I can't seem to find a right time when they're not ""sold out"" for the day. Nevertheless, their slices of cakes are to die for, and they have an amazing selection of crepes. Also if you get a little thirsty, and need something to wash down the decadent cake, I would recommend the Royal Milk Tea in a can. I know what your thinking, ""canned milk tea"" . . . ""yuck"", but this milk tea tastes as if the God's made it. I mean they call it ""royal"" for a reason (#nahwahimsayin). The nice lady at the register told me that it was a really big hit, and people would buy 5 cans at a time and like one slice of cake. I mean you think their cake would be dry or something for a person to buy 5 cans of milk tea for one cake, but I guess its just that good. Anyways, If your in a bit of a coffee mood, don't get your hopes up with what they have. I was expecting something doused in loads of milk and caramel sauce, but what I got was straight up black coffee with some caramel syrup. I mean it was a bit of a surprise when I drank it, but nothing a bit of almond milk and a dash a sugar couldn't fix.

P.S. I thought that little ""Suzuya"" decoration was chocolate, but surprise surprise, its actually plastic . . . or paper . . . anyways it's not edible. Man this places is just full of surprises.

Regular Coffee ($2.85) - I wish the large size was larger, but the coffee tasted pretty good. They have a station with cream, sugar sweeteners, lids and napkins. The coffee was ground, brewed fresh and brought to my table piping hot. They have flavored coffees as well I look forward to trying in the future. 

Banana, Chocolate and Whipped Cream Crepe ($4.50) - This handheld treat was very good. There was a good amount of banana, chocolate and whipped cream inside and the crepe itself held everything together nicely.

Suzuya has become a traditional stop for us right after the Chaiya Monastery Food Fair which is also in the area.

Around this time of the year, Suzuya's seasonal Kabocha items are what I like to look for.Originally a pie, Chef Misuzu has transformed the pie into a turnover which is equally good.(Ask to get it warmed up!) A few of her other desserts have had a makeover as well, but the taste and quality has always remained top notch.

Another new addition to Suzuya's delicious pastries and crepes is their tea selections.
I tried a Milk Oolong Tea which was served in these SWEET Magisso tilting tea cups(from Finland) that have a built-in tea strainer.You infuse the water and tea for a few minutes, then tilt back and enjoy! The tea was smooth, delicious, and fragrant. They have a few other varieties sourced from small independent businesses in Asia, so be sure to inquire when partaking in their tea service.

I definitely plan on enjoying another good cup of tea with Suzuya's pastries and crepes very soon!  ALOHA!!!

Everything and I mean everything we tried was just wonderful. The cream filling was fluffy and not overly sweet. The cake was moist and flavorful. The fruits were fresh and perfectly ripe. You can tell that they take pride in their pastries and treat it like art. Every piece of pastry is a masterpiece. I haven't had such amazing pastries since my last visit to Japan in 2014.

It was a piece of a strawberry, crepe layered cake. A light touch of cream sandwiched between multiple thin, delicate, layers of crepes. Something that seemed so fragile and dainty, that turns into a crazy massive rave in my mouth. 

Manfriend's birthday was approaching and I thought it would be really cool if I could get my hands on that cake! So I made the call to Kabuto and prayed I could somehow manage to order the cake from them. They said they wouldn't be able to do that for me, but they gave me the contact information to someone who could ;D 

And DUH-DA-NA-NAAA, in came Suzuya into my life. I didn't get to reach them for the cake, but I did manage to stop by last weekend. It's located in the corner of the most random spot, and quite small. There's 2 small tables, a corner bar-type sitting area that can fit three, and 2 couches with a tiny coffee table nested in between them. Still, it's a cute little pastry cafe that looks like something I'd see in an asian drama. 

I didn't get a chance to get the crepe cause I was immediately drawn to their clear glass of heavenly delights at the counter. I ordered the Strawberry Shortcake and the Green Tea Cake -- the popular choices. All their desserts are very light and fluffy, not too heavy in sugar. The Green Tea Cake pretty much tastes like Green Tea Kit Kats in cake form. I recommend pairing it with their barley tea, they compliment each other so well. The prices aren't the friendliest, they range from $3-4, but it doesn't bother me too much. Someone behind me ordered their crepe and it's definitely something I have to come back here for...I was practically drooling just creepily staring at it from afar. 

Oh and as for that layered cake... it goes out fast! From what I know, they try to sell it 1-2 times a week and they sell it by the slice. If you'd like to order the whole cake, you must put in a 48hr advanced order and the price for it is around $40.",HmhjcPCVr0TbPsPhXV-Trw,6,1,5,9SHHhsY4YsJxUL8grVHC7g

Another such themed cafe, at least in Las Vegas, would probably muck up their menu with gross artificial boba teas and such, but not this place. Everything is seriously delicious.  

One quibble: They serve cold brewed coffee and tea that has specially sources beans etc. etc. Basically they seem to care about their coffee and tea. Then, if you want creamer, they only offer those gross dinner cafe creamer things that aren't even made of cream but instead weird chemicals and vegetable oil. Organic specialty brew with bizarre chemical fake dairy product? Just a small detail that could be corrected.",nVsn4XfERr0PaCDHMgZjMA,0,0,5,x-wHCqQH-9UH2XpNv_kXZQ

It's small bakery sort of hidden next to Sonic, owned by husband and wife. Workers are friendly, and there's some seating area available. Along with desserts they also serve crepes, coffee and tea. The crepes are good but I'm a bigger fan of the baked goods. 

My number 1 recommendation (if you're a green tea lover like me) is the green tea éclair. They put A LOT of filling and it's not too sweet. Ugh freaking amazing. Sometimes they don't have the éclair so I'll go with the green tea cream puff which is basically a smaller version of it. 

Also, my other favorite is the green tea macaron. Hands down the best green tea macaron I've tried all the macaron places I've tried. It's so nice and soft in the inside and again the filling has a nice matcha flavor and is not too sweet.

Green tea cake, again, best green tea cake I've ever had. The apple pie is another delicious treat. The crepes on the other hand could use a little work. I've tried some of the savory crepes and for me some of the flavors just don't pair with each other. Like for the spinach avocado bacon, I felt like the spinach really overpowered a lot.

I would plan ahead especially if you want to hang out with a group of friends because this place has about 5 tables with room for a dozen chairs. I would recommend getting your order to go, which I prefer. Since the takeout containers are quite neat and cute. It has this Japanese ""Kawaii"" look and feel. 

The pastries were all delicious with a light taste and not overly dense like traditional European or American Style pastries. Just like many Asian inspired café and bakery. This place is like a combination of European inspired with Asian flare. Especially with the variety of flavors that are offered. I personally enjoyed the Blueberry Cheesecake. It was light, moist and not too sweet. However, the Japanese cheesecake was superb. Light and fluffy as if they injected air into the cake, every bite was satisfying. I will need to return so I can try their crepes!

My 2 favorite cakes from here are the Mont Blanc and the Green Tea Mille Crepe cake. Think they might be the only place with Mont Blanc. It's different and sooooo good. I've tried the green tea Mille crepe at other bakeries in town and no where comes even close to how they make theirs.

I ordered a birthday crepe cake for a friend of mine while we were staying in Vegas. They were very accommodating on the phone. You have to call at least 3 days in advance so they can make the cake for you. I ordered a 12in' strawberry creme crepe cake, which is a good size to share between 8-10 people. The price wasn't too bad, I believe the cake came out to be a total of $46, but it was a little over $50 with tax. Again, this was a crepe cake, so it's definitely a bit more pricey than a normal cake.

The only thing I wish was better is the seating. There's only two tables and a little bar area against the wall the dogs about 3 people. It was pretty busy when I walked in and I had to stand in a corner because I had no other place to wait at.

I probably came at the wrong time of the day--around 3 PM, and the selection was less than shown in the other reviews/photos here.   I bought 4 pastries, two chocolate cakes, a Kabocya chestnut Mont Blanc, and the green tea cake.

I did not eat the chocolate cake as that was for my wife.  She thought it was very, very good.  My favorite of the other two I bought for myself varied.  The Kabocya chestnut Mont Blanc was superb!  The chestnut was fantastic and the pastry cream was excellent.  I thought the green tea cake was OK but it wasn't anything special.  I do want to go back and try one of their crèpes.  They were making some while I was there and they look delicious!

A word about service.  Because they were making the crèpes, and two people were needed--one to watch the crèpe on the griddle and one to fill them, the wait for service was a bit longer.  After a fairly long wait, a gentleman came from the baking area and started to help.  Everyone was apologetic for the wait and thanked me for my patience.

All their desserts look very delicate and to an extent they are, the cakes are airy, crusts are flaky. But they all have rich, decadent accents such as frostings, fillings etc. The best thing however, is the sweetness of the desserts. None of their goods are too sweet, if that makes any sense for desserts. It is sweet enough to let you know it is a dessert, but not so sweet as to mask the more subtle flavors such as green tea or almonds, etc.

Their immense reputation certainly precedes them, and I've probably even tried one of their creations at Goyemon a long time ago. But even knowing I would almost certainly enjoy Suzuya, I wasn't motivated to make the drive out until a timely UYE that followed the nearby monthly Chaiya Food Fair today. I'm so, so glad that I finally went.

I ordered the B.A.T. - bourbon bacon, arugula, tomatoes, avocado, house-made mayo, balsamic vinaigrette, all wrapped in a great, almost spongy crepe. This is by far the best savory crepe I've had, and I'd recommend it as a ""meal"" to precede all your desserts. In terms of sweets, I had a banana-hazelnut cream tart, which I almost absent-mindedly started eating before realizing how good it was. And my other dessert order, a mango mousse, was topped with diced mango and a coconut-dang-it-what's-the-word-Nelson-used? and was heavenly all the way through.

I was also lucky enough to try what Michael K. ordered. I actually started off on those, first taste being a nice piece of apple pie that he requested to be topped with green tea ice cream. To make this delight, they use puff pastry and fuji apple, two of my favorites, and it's quite possibly the best apple pie you'll find around Vegas. I believe that I described this as ""really, really good.""

I also tasted a bit of a custard atop a thin layer of sponge cake, which was also very good, and practically half a cannoli crepe, which was not overly sweet but still a treat with the ricotta cheese, crunchy pistachio bits and semi-sweet chocolate pieces. Finally, I tried a green tea eclair with a white chocolate topping, and I almost could have had the white chocolate with that touch of green tea powder by itself.

I have a few more treats in my fridge waiting for me to recover from the food coma, and I'm confident that I'll enjoy those as well. (UPDATE 4/30/14: custard pudding awesome, yuzu panna cotta relatively restrained on yuzu flavor.)

The anko cream puff had me at red bean and custard. Two of my favorite things! The outside end flaky and soft and the filling was oozing out after the first bite. Love the combination of red bean, custard and cream. This cream puff is definitely a winner in my book. 

Green tea cake was good, but not my favorite. Maybe it was the hazelnut cream but anyways it was good just not my favorite. The new chocolate medallion that says Suzuya is nifty. 

This place uses square wallet as their POS so you see how an iPad can be used and you can create a tab and not have to bring money to Suzuya if you use this app. 

Overall, I think this place is quite awesome and like most Asian bakeries, the pastries aren't overly sweet. Perfect balance of sweetness to the two that I tried.",sa5zd7bwBQzajQB48Y9SUw,4,4,5,VO3I5MVEHM4KT25BqyX_6A

Their desserts are fresh and made with japanese flour, which makes their products so much higher in quality. I personally love their mango mousse, blueberry cheesecake and strawberry millecrepes. I got a piece of greentea log cake and almond crepe on today's visit. The almond crepe was a little burnt and the elements inside were not evenly distributed as it usually is, but the greentea cake was good- although I wish they didn't put the rock sugars outside, which overpowered overall sweetness. They have always got friendly service and staff :)

Ps) my sister paid with a card different than the name of her ID, they asked for her ID,  and my sister didnt realize it was different until i told her. Not sure what is the whole purpose of checking ID for card transactions, but it could have just been a simple mistake.

Mont blan cream was good, but I didn't like their sponge cake as usual. 

Tiramisu had good cream, but it could use more ladyfingers. But this is how it's done in Japan with very little ladyfinger and more cream so it is what it is.

I'd have to say out of all the places you can purchase cake, this place is the closest to how it tastes in Japan. Generally lighter (airy) than European and American bakeries.",B1829_hxXSEpDPEDJtYeIw,0,0,3,XWclVrsWwAgSRn2xUAr7Jw

So the orders we DID get were AMAZING! We had about 7 different desserts too.
Let's begin:

1. MANGO TIRAMISU $14.00
It is enough to feed 4-6 people. The crust is flaky, mango mousse inside is creamy and the mango fruit is fresh. (7 out of 10)

2. MONT BLANC $4.75
This is a chestnut cake with chestnut mousse and a piece of candied Japanese chestnut on the top. The lightness of the chestnut flavor might have been a bit too light. (6 out of 10)

3. YUZU PANNA COTTA $3.75
Suuper citrus-y, borderline subtle-y sour. Could be addictive, but maybe with a side of their whipped cream and it would balance sweet and sour. (6 out of 10)

4. FRUIT PARFAIT
Good, but not outstanding. (3 out of 10)

5. CANNOLI CREPE W/ VANILLA ICE CREAM $5.50
MY CREPE! YUMMY! It was my favorite thing here I've tried ^_^ (10 out of 10)

6. CUSTOMIZED CREPE w/ Chocolate Syrup, Chocolate Crunchies, Chocolate Pocky, Whipped Cream and Vanilla Ice Cream $5.10
My niece's reply to her crepe - ""so so so so good!"" (10 out of 10 for her!) 

7. CHOCOLATE CAKE $3.50
Chocolate-y, light + moist. A MUST-get! (10 out of 10)

It didn't have that nice chew that a Macaron should. I'm not sure if all the sesame ones are like this or if it was a fluke. Because the red bean was beautifully done! And I did appreciate that these Macarons weren't the teeny tiny size you usually see, they were just big enough to be more than just one bite.

Coconut Chiffon Cake: Hands down my favorite. It wasn't too sweet and the cream inside, along with the actual cake itself literally melted in my mouth. I would keep coming back for this alone.

Strawberry Shortcake: Again, not too sweet-so I immediately liked it, BUT it was a little dry :( I definitely think that us coming in SO close to their closing time was a huge factor in that though. Next time, we will go earlier in the day. 

Apple Pie: They heated it up for us (even though they were closing in 4 minutes) and it was delicious. My bf wasn't too impressed by it, but I thought it had a great balance of sweet, tart, & crunchy. Probably would have been better with vanilla ice cream though ;)

Their Rocky Road Crepe is incredible. The toasted almonds, marshmallows, chocolate sauce, and whipped cream combine for a decadent treat that doesn't feel overly heavy. Add a dollop of vanilla ice cream and it doesn't get much better.

My buddy and I tried the Strawberry + whipped cream crepe and the Nutella stuffed almond crepe!

Exploding with flavor, the powder sugar from the strawberry one was perfect!

Lastly we ordered the legendary ""YUZU PANA COTTA""
Sour at first, but has an insane comeback that knocks you out of your seat! For such a minuscule dish.. I would've never thought it would be this delectable.

My friend told me I had to try their Milli Crepe Cake, but due to its popularity, we didn't even get to catch a glimpse of this beautiful concoction. We were advised to call at least a day prior to reserve a slice ($4.50) or cake ($45?).

Everything is so pretty! It was really hard to decide on a pastry, so I went with three, hehe. I tried the special of the day, Millefeuille (also known as a Napoleon; layers of puff pastry alternating with layers of pastry cream, topped with fresh fruits), Yuzu Panna Cotta, and Fuji Apple Pie. Everything was so light and delicious!! Nothing is overly sweet, which makes your dessert time guilt-free. The layers of the Millefeuille were difficult to cut with the dainty knife (although extremely adorable!), but it was airy when you bit into it paired with the wonderful cream. The panna cotta was creamy and firm and the yuzu cut through the dessert with freshness and a citrus kick. My friend got a slice of the Coconut Chiffon Cake and that was light and delicious as well! 

They brought our pastries on adorable trays with equally adorable utensils. Seriously, coolest pastry utensils ever. Where do I get these gorgeous forks, spoons, and knives? There was also a carafe of iced water available at the register. Seriously, I don't think you could go wrong with any of the pastries or cakes and I can't wait to try their crepes!",TdYKJgSgY2GF_YJnwsi5yQ,3,2,4,XaxYUkv3gvy1I1y2T5zw0g

The major consensus listed by best to least favorite based on flavor &  sweetness. 

-Blueberry cheesecake: The group's favorite; not too sweet and just the right amount of density/creaminess with a subtle hint of blueberry (a lot of American cheesecakes are quite dense with cheese and too strong in flavor). 

-Tiramisu: great espresso/coffee flavor. The bottom layer of cake was doused with espresso/coffee. The whipped cream was soft and airy. 

-Cream puff: MY favorite bc I love custards and this one had specs of vanilla bean sprinkled through the batter. 

- Strawberry Shortcake: not too sweet, airy soft sponge cake with huge chunks of strawberries. 

- Green tea crepe cake: had little bits of red beans scattered throughout. I kept thinking about Lady M back home and how it didn't match up to Lady M's crepe cakes. Green tea was too subtle and quite bland. 

- Mont Blanc - chestnutty flavor. The lady behind us got mad we got the last one but I didn't see what her deal was after eating it - it was ok, nothing spectacular in flavor. 

-Lemon Panna Cotta - too tart. 

-Tokyo Cheesecake: group's least favorite. It was a dense block of blandness/wanna-be cheesecake.",yjOOyV7mmegV8QeMRwi3gA,1,0,3,EJ8q4CQKc3fp5n_-TGEuAw

If you're a fan of Kabuto or Goyemons treats, these are the pastry chefs that created those items. For those who have never had Japanese desserts the best way to describe them is decadent, yet delicate. It's not about saccharine, sugary highs, but all about balance. Often they play on flavors that are a bit sweet, a bit savory (think green tea, red bean, sesame, etc). 

I picked up some stuff to-go : 

Green tea cream puff - solid cream puff. I sliced it in half and half of the cream is vanilla cream and half was nice, strong matcha flavored whip. We make some awesome cream puffs at home and I feel these are just as good. 

Brandied cherry black forest - I enjoyed the chocolate mousse in this and appreciated that the cherries were brandied and not the usual neon ice cream cherries. 

Yuzu panna cotta - This was bright citrusy pungent flavor that I love about yuzu and the texture was on point of a panna cotta. I get rather disappointed how unbalanced many places are between creamy and gelatine. 

Tofu cheesecake - light and fluffy. I'm a big fan of Japanese style cheesecake since it's almost like a whipped mousse instead of being dense. It's one of those things that you can eat a lot of since it's not overbearing.

For the quality, the prices aren't out of line, but this isn't your cheapest bakery either. The quality though and presentation is top notch and something you would expect to see at a on strip patisserie charging for more. If you were going to a dinner party or gifting pastries, this would be one of the places to consider for being beautiful, and having unique offerings.

I refused to give up on this place and finally found my AHA moment in the form of Kabocha pie and Green tea mille crepe! Lol. It's sort of a ritual for me to stop by here whenever I would visit the Filipino market a couple of doors down. 

About 2 weeks ago they started carrying their seasonal Kabocha (Japanese pumpkin) items and of course I had to try it. Also available that day was the elusive Matcha green tea mille crepe ($4.50) It was love at first bite for me: The Kabocha pie ($3.25) is rich and decadent, the natural sweetness of the squash breaking thru and perfectly complements the buttery crust. The matcha green tea mille crepe is perfection in a slice. With the very prominent flavor of matcha incorporated in the cream and anko red bean for added sweetness in between layers of delicate crepe. In another visit I was given a sample of their version of nama chocolate and it tastes just like Royce! It'll be a bonus if they can make the matcha variety as well. 

Pro tip: Call in advance, especially if you want their seasonal items, they go by fast! They will hold them for you if you plan to go within the hour. If not, you can prepay for items and they'll put them aside for you. Trust me, those 2 items alone are worth the trip!",JqjAthJThuVYgTh4iWDZ2A,7,6,4,MQUn8E3kLrVyQgkUiZT22w

It's cute a little shop and has a pleasant atmosphere, and the staff are nice people too.

I ordered the Mango, Passion Fruit & Coconut Mousse, its unbelievably delicious, I could taste the layers of fruit and surprisingly it wasn't too sweet.
I'm a fan strawberries so I had to try the Strawberry Mille Crepe Cake, its stacked crepes formed into a cake, I like this better than any strawberry shortcake.     
I love Japanese Milk, tastes like black tea except its cold.

Seriously the best crepe I've ever had.

The creme is perfect, not too sweet and the taste of the crepe itself is just sweet enough.

I guess I had to subtract a star because I've made my own standard crepes before and I know how cheap and easy it is to make them, so to pay around $10 for two is difficult though they are way better than my own.

Also, people rave about the crepe cake which is strawberry creme layered between maybe 10 crepes and cut like a cake...had it once...it's ok, but the much better item is just a freshly made strawberry and creme crepe.

It started when I just wanted to grab a quick cup of coffee without having to go all the way to Starbucks.  I live in walking distance of this spot so it was very convenient.  While waiting to get my drink, I watched as the guy ahead of me ordered a strawberry-filled crepe that looked and smelled delicious.  My olfactory sense made a mental note and I knew I'd have to make a return trip.  I ended up never even getting a crepe but tried a personal-sized Fuji Apple Pie instead. Lemme tell you when I say, I'm literally a slave to them now.  I find it very hard to resist swerving into the shopping center to check in to Suzuya to see if that wonderful pastry delight is sitting there calling me like a Siren to indulge in its culinary wonderment.

In the last two weeks or so, I've had about 3 or 4.  I even ordered a full-sized one for Thanksgiving and literally prayed that no one would touch it before the night was over.  THANKFULLY, my prayers were answered and I was able to devour the pie all by myself over a course of a few days since Thanks.  (Try it with butter pecan ice cream and you'll be in heaven!)  I just recently tried the Pumpkin Pie and now I'm torn between which is my fave...so I just buy them both. :) 

The folks that work at Suzuya are sweet, polite and incredibly gracious providing the kind of hospitality that you only get overseas.

Also tried the Yuzu Panna Cotta ($3.75): Japanese Citrus with Yogurt. This was pretty tasty...the Yuzu is a very strong flavor though and overpowers everything else in the panna cotta. Gotta love yuzu to love this!

A relative newcomer to the diverse Las Vegas pastry scene I'd originally been made aware of Suzuya by a friend suggesting the small southwestern store produced the best crepes in town; not particularly a dish I go out of my way for...at least until he also mentioned the phrase mille-feuille and caused me to dig deeper, my research quickly mandating a Saturday visit when already in the area for lunch with a colleague from at Born and Raised.  Small and neat, a simple pastry case and a crepe stone at the front of the restaurant with the kitchen in back and a few stools and chairs for dining in it was just after 10:15 when I arrived at Suzuya and with a couple picking up a custom cake while another woman, clearly a regular, stopped in for two-dozen apple pies I spent some time chatting with the employees about what was best, eventually allowing them to talk me into a crepe to go with a quartet from the case.  Clearly focused on fusion but well-versed in French techniques my tasting of Suzuya started with a pair of crisp and buttery choux puffs filled with traditional Japanese accoutrements and although I'd have personally preferred the squash to be more sweetened the red bean version was exquisite and the pasty textbook, a trend that would continue onward to the buttery lattice of the subtly sweet apple pie and a crisp mille feuille filled to order and garnished with Chantilly cream and fresh fruit - both every bit on par with versions from b.patisserie during my June visit to the Bay and as such amongst the best I've experienced stateside.  Clearly not leaving without at least doing due diligence to the crepe it can only be said that as far as crepes go this was about as good as it gets, the batter light and airy with a silken mouthfeel just robust enough to hold up to the equally light ingredients and a veritable deal at $4.75 which will see me back sooner rather than later to enjoy the mille-crepe cake or whatever Chef Misuzu and Plourde think of next.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,5,4,4,mn05cmadcQSphYTvLk8pxg

The crepes here are well-made, served with cool whipped cream with your choice of fruits which fill the soft crepe delicately folded into a cone. If you've never had Japanese pastries before, Suzuya is an excellent introduction. The pastries are light, fluffy and mildly sweet, lending to a more refined taste.

What a cute little bakery store! I first came upon this store when I was searching around on yelp and found out that they had mille crepe cakes! I sincerely missed the mille crepe cake I had in NY and I wanted to visit Suzuya to see if their crepe cakes were any similar to the ones I had in NY. 

The first time I visited was last month and I went right in the morning. However, they did not have the crepe cake out :( They said they were still making it. I was quite sad that I couldn't try it out on my first visit. Instead, I opted for a piece of their strawberry shortcake and my friend got one of their savory crepes as breakfast. 

The strawberry shortcake was okay. For some reason, there was something missing . It didn't make me go ""eeeeee!"" as most other good pastries do. It was light and fluffy like most Japanese/French fusion bakeries are but not AS fluffy as it can be? Not really sure how to describe it. But my friend's savory crepe was pretty good. I think he got the B.A.T. Very nicely put together. Nothing too overpowering or overwhelming. 

On my second visit to Suzuya, they didn't even make the mille crepe cake for that day. I was highly disappointed and ended up not taking anything else in substitution.

Finally, on my third visit to Suzuya, I got to try their strawberry mille crepe cake. While my friends got a Mont Blanc, Yuzu Panna Cotta, and Coffee Jelly. 

I wasn't that impressed with their mille crepe cake. One of the things that I noticed was that they put the mille crepe cake in the fridge along with their other pastries. I suppose for other pastries, it's okay. But a mille crepe cake's main ingredient is the cream between each layer of crepe. Once that hits the fridge, it hardens and is not as soft. Same could be said for the crepe itself -- it gets a little stretchy and no longer as fresh. The texture and the feeling of taking a bite of the crepe cake was not satisfying. I think it would be better if they left the cake out of the fridge. 

The mille crepe cake I had in NY was left out. Think bakery. They never put it in a fridge. They served the cake fresh most of the time because there's a lot of people that buy it. High turn over rate. However, I did put the cake in the fridge while staying in NY and even though it hit the fridge, the cake's quality didn't change much ... ehh? Quality difference?

However, I really enjoyed their Mont Blanc, which is a chestnut dessert. It has chestnut surrounding it, cake on the inside, and a tart holding it all together. It was really good. Probably the best dessert out of the 4 that we got.

The Yuzu panna cotta was okay. The yuzu was very prominent in the dessert. It was good, but not the type of citrus I liked :P And I never got to try the coffee jelly considering I'm not a big coffee person. 


I do want to try more of their desserts to see how they taste. It seems like they always have new items to choose from. Some are part of their basic menu while others constantly change, such as the mango tiramisu or seasonal mango desserts.",oqTZC9WriodTCby6jl0LfQ,3,2,4,rplF6MZVFI63G6pcdtwl-g

Like lots of things in Vegas that are not on the Strip, this is in a strip mall location.

The back-left portion is dominated with a display case, ordering counter, and behind that some storage and I'm guessing a kitchen.

The display cases are impressive - they've got lots of great pastries in them, definitely Japanese style (i.e. less sweet and lighter).  Presentation on the items was beautiful, and the attention to detail was very evident.  Their display case has a no pictures sign on it.

I had a tasty green tea cake, which had delicate chocolate shavings and a piece of chocolate lace on it, that had a nice airy texture and great flavor.

Coffee was interesting in that it was a pour over, but wasn't advertised as such.

Attention to detail could further be seen when they were making crepes, as they used an IR temperature gun to check the crepe surface before pouring any batter on it, and did this for each crepe they made.  

In hindsight, I should have ordered a crepe as I tend to really like the Japanese-style crepes . . . definitely something I'll have to do in the future.

Definitely worth checking out if you want something that's a little lighter and less sweet, but still compliments coffee well.",fpiirm8MU_hSJBjHpbtIUA,1,0,4,YKBRfuy_YTFF_V2urU9i7w

5487266,2016-04-08,0,gqdqnFg2lYeSyS20q2ZK_Q,"Good crepes, desserts are fine but overpriced. Coffee is delicious. 

Met up with a friend at 10am, and since they open at 10 there was a short line. Did not have to wait long at all, which is great because that means they're truly ready to start once they open, unlike some businesses where if you're one of the first few orders it takes forever because the equipment is still warming/heating up. 

I got the BAT savory crepe which was perfection. Very light and thin crepe that melded well with the filling (bacon, avocado, arugula, and sun dried tomatoes). the crepes are thinner, more elastic (in an appetizing way) and less sweet than your French crepe, and it was a great vehicle for my light breakfast (this would be a great second breakfast or mid morning snack. I was still slightly hungry when I got home). It's served rolled up like an ice cream cone, so it was easy to eat and not messy. 

I also ordered a coffee and it was a pour over. Delicious smooth medium roast coffee. 

I wasn't a huge fan of the two types Of cake. I purchased two slices of cake to bring home - the mango special of the day and the strawberry thousand layer cake. The mangoes in the mango came were really sweet and fresh, and the cream was that fluffy not too sweet Asian-style cream, but it was still really heavy despite its light texture. the strawberry cake was okay too, but I'm not a huge fan of the strawberry syrup flavoring (that's what it tasted like, could be wrong). I've had the thousand layer cake from Lady M in Ny, and that was my standard. This fell short of that bc the strawberry cake had too much cream in between each layer, weren't enough layers in it, & you couldn't enjoy the feel of the layers in your mouth (that sounds weird but if you've had the Mille cake from Lady M Boutique in Ny you know what I mean). This strawberry Mille cake had layers that were thicker, spongier, and not as light. 

Overall the cakes were fine if they were priced at $3.50 or lower. However, at $4.25 per small slice, my expectations were much much higher and the cakes fell short of that. 

Service was great - friendly, polite, and quick.",mHp4g3_z2dmD9UPXzuE8bQ,1,1,4,BJkMRvYzpMOQf5cAu8poEw

I very much appreciated the self-serve complimentary pitcher of ice water on the counter.  Everything in the case looked delectable with beautiful presentation.  I had my coconut cake today and it was delicious, a sponge cake with frosting that was not too sweet.

Standouts:
Shoyu caramel ice cream - the portion is a tiny little scoop but you totally taste the shoyu.
Yuzu ice cream - ditto portion but very yuzu'y.
Yuzu panna cotta - very flavorful and was a proper panna cotta
Millfeuille - Was a little tough to eat but the pastry was buttery, rich and yet light at the same time.
Nitro hibiscus tea - Hard to explain but if you like hibiscus tea, you have to try this.
Black sesame macaron - Very black sesame-y and not overly sweet

The things we were just ok with were the cheesecake (seemed a little mild after all the other flavorful cakes), the millecrepe cakes (both green tea and strawberry) and the chocolate cake.

It was good bu for the little sliver I got not sure it was worth the $4 price tag.  We also ordered the tiramisu which was good as well but again at $4.50 not sure if it was worth the price. Since we don't live in the area not sure if we'll be back especially since there are other bakeries in the area for us to try.,Hv_Sk1QTTBgOScage3uiqw,0,0,3,VHaYx9ID6R2rv3Tt0XQb9A

They have a small but filled display case full of delicious looking pastries and cake slices. I also ordered a rocky road crepe which was great as well. The employees were all happy and helpful. I will definitely be back!",QgAfYR3a_IUo4LtuDO5t1Q,1,0,5,VS_CLg198BBLbojFFdclVw

The space itself is comfortable. A few high tables, some chairs, and a picnic table off to the side. When you walk in, you're met with the case of glorious cakes and pastries. What caught my eye first was the Mont Blanc. An almond tarte with chantilly cream, a hint of rum. It's topped with a whole chestnut that is candied somehow. The texture was soft and easy to bite through and the color is muted yellow. The prettiest and most delicious selection for me was the Millefeuille. I was enraptured by the flakey pie crust with vanilla custard cream layers. I may not be able to pronounce it, but I had no problem eating it.

The woman behind the counter was very friendly and eager to help. I love an enthusiastic guest service experience. It makes me feel like they want to be involved and truly want to be part of the experience so I'll come back. It's like your grandmother is helping you, only she was way younger and had more to offer than vanilla wafers.

I hope to find myself on this side of town again soon... but I may have to find an excuse to just make my way for no reason. No reason except, Millefeuille.",NhgU7RhuYYFmpkb1jlYJ6Q,21,16,5,1bCPqadR8cmxV_9cmEgHyg

I understand that they do run out of some of items so quickly.. but if you saw the delicate presentation they prepare.. you would understand.. it is a work of Japanese art.. All in special ordered containers for each desert...
I luv the flavors of their deserts.. they are so lite and not too sweet..
If you like super sweet deserts this might not be the kind of desert place for you..",xfFbRSH1T609k_aR_D99FQ,0,0,5,Jd2fW2xsUoMJh4JrosVpPg
5902770,2017-01-25,16,gqdqnFg2lYeSyS20q2ZK_Q,"Honestly, everything about Suzuya is amazing. They serve up Japanese-style cakes, crepes, custards, and cream puffs plus more. Even as someone who enjoys heavy desserts, I still appreciate the subtle flavor of all their sweets. I've tried nearly everything here, and while I think most of its worth trying once, I definitely recommend two things:

1) Rocky Road crepe with Nutella and strawberries
-- All their crepes are amazing. They're both fluffy and delicate, with the perfect sweetness level. But their rocky road crepe is on a whole other level. With whipped cream and house made marshmallows, this crepe is super fluffy. The sliced almonds and pocky stick give it a satisfying crunch, while the chocolate, Nutella, and strawberries easily complement each other. This crepe, by far, is the most jam-packed on their crepe menu. If you're feeling underwhelmed by the two-topping simplicity of the other crepes (while delicious), or you're feeling a lil extra, this is a definite must try and not for the faint of heart. 

2) Chocolate cake
-- I'm a true believer in food that makes you feel something. For instance, I mostly opt for rich and heavy desserts that make me feel self-hatred afterwards. Or regret. But this cake? This cake makes me feel sadness. I eat this cake, and I'm so sad when it's over because I fucking LOVE this cake. It's unbelievably light and fluffy, rich with chocolate flavor, but not overly sweet. Seriously, do yourself a favor and eat this cake. And as the cheesy saying goes, ""don't be sad that it's over, be glad that it happened.""",ZIqkcApOQh8QfiydYSiLaQ,28,22,5,JVc4apr_JgUcgkgi_X7OgA
5911072,2018-05-28,0,gqdqnFg2lYeSyS20q2ZK_Q,I ordered the tiramisu and it was my first time visiting this place also. It was very delicious and had a creamy texture as well which was very smooth.  The coffee taste was not overwhelming like other ones I've tasted. It was well balanced My friend ordered the strawberry crepe cake which was quite refreshing. It was definitely the best tiramisu I've had in a while.  The way the desserts were presented was very neat and clean. The bakery is well maintained and clean as well. I wish they were open longer though.,dhxarelx8w96GX0umMIq5A,0,0,4,KZ4CvQ6x69Eruj0Rdgu2UQ

This is better than the bakery in Little Tokyo in downtown LA.  Now I know where to go when I need my fix of outstanding pastries.,RCgfxH5PclsgSKRWDGJ86A,1,1,5,53wWtvvcbWIbFavdiVdHxw

You can never go wrong with Suzuya. They have a lot of signature pastries such as their Crepe Mille cakes, custards, creme puffs, and so on. I am a big fan of sweets and pastries, but for those who are not big fans, they can still find something delicious here. Everything is flavorful and not super sweet. I've not had one thing here that I didn't enjoy. I don't really like coconut and apple but having their coconut chiffon cake and their apple pies, oh man! Totally changed my mind! Somedays I just sit wherever I am and crave for that apple pie. My favorites other than the apple pie include the Yuzu panna cotta, Mont Blanc, green tea Mille, and the kabocha pie. 

Great for a date! The atmosphere itself is quite quaint and super cute. There are limited chairs, just be aware. 

Otherwise, Suzuya is worth the drive if you don't live in the Southwest area.",ZsjuEgOdvx9l5GKZdtwYIw,5,5,5,wdZgWJNIHMqze_FwUH59jw
5959403,2014-01-07,5,gqdqnFg2lYeSyS20q2ZK_Q,"It was love at first bite. I was in the neighborhood and finally got the chance to check Suzuya out. The place was pretty busy, but luckily that gave me ample time to peruse the display case and figure out what I wanted to order. I couldn't resist the strawberry crepe cake and a red bean cream puff for my fella. 

The ordering and payment process is very convenient and I was out the door in minimal time with my adorable little box of desserts. I made it as far as my car before I was compelled to take a bite of the crepe cake. Holy cow! It was absolutely amazing. The flavors were so subtle and yet explosive. The flavors were right on and I can't believe it took me as long as it did to give them a try. I don't have much of a sweet tooth, but this place truly blew my mind. Not overly sweet and the all-natural flavors really shown. 

I heard after the fact that the crepe cake is hard to come by, only making me wish I had bought more than one when I had the chance. Have no fear, I will be back... and soon.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,9,10,5,ncFOkofC8Ai0rSrUAWtlQw
