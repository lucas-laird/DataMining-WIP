Hubby ordered the Truffle Mushroom Swiss (Truffle mayo, saut√©ed crimini mushrooms & Swiss on an egg bun) w/ a side of Smash Fries (their signature fries tossed in Italian olive oil, rosemary & garlic) and seemed to thoroughly enjoy his dinner. I on the other hand ordered the Avocado Club burger (avocado, applewood smoked bacon, lettuce, and tomato on a multi-grain bun); I understand that it's a club so it's essentially a cold sandwich but I think at least the burger patty could be warm/hot or won't that work? I mean, even the bun was cold . . . I will say that the Avocado, lettuce and tomato were fresh!

The burger patties are advertised as certified Angus beef but -- considering how quickly the orders were filled, I suspect many of them must be already cooked and waiting for orders to come in . . . Quick and efficient service.",7QabHqBTl8ZhC_ZznBUkFw,0,0,3,A859TSlhqZvYmTzUkj0N4Q

So, this is located in the new NYC food court-type place right outside the Colosseum in Caesar's Palace.  If you know me, you know I love me a good burger!  I didn't eat before the Mariah Carey show so I was starved by 10pm.  Made a B-line straight for the Smashburger!

Hey, it's Vegas, everything is going to be expensive so I always find it amusing when people complain about the prices.  I ordered the original Smashburger, a fountain drink, and Smash fries and yes, it came out to almost $20.  The burger was not bad at all, it hit the spot.  I had to add mayo (condiments are located to the right by the drink fountain).  It wasn't bad at all, but I liken it to a glorified burger lovechild between McDonald's and Burger King and In-n-Out.  The Smash fries I was really looking forward to, truffle oil, Rosemary, garlic...but they were way too salty.  I usually scarf all my fries down before I even touch the burger but not this time.;

The service was not bad.  I got my entire meal before my mom got her plain cheese quesadilla that she ordered BEFORE me at a different location in the food court.  So I'd say their service could be considered fast compared to others.  Why ""Smash""burger?  They smash the burgers fresh!

Hey, if you're craving a burger and have limited options because you're stuck with your gamble-holic mother in Caesar's palace and it's late, you choose Smashburger.",YSPwb5_9D96yNaB68psHYg,3,2,3,3p-u_Ob1GmXh5LsNNPmZFg

I don't blame her but I guess the policy at all smashburgers are to cook the meat medium well. As someone who eats a lot of meat and a lot of burgers I have never head of this policy except maybe at McDonald's or Burger King. I mean for a ""gourmet burger"" place this is in no way gourmet. They are pretty much emulating a fast food chain but charging 9-10$ for a burger. I mean what's the point of serving ""never frozen"" beef if it is just have to order it the shittiest way possible. 
When I asked Alejandra if she ever had eaten a burger that was never frozen or if it was cooked rare/medium rare she said no. But then again she looked 18yo and doesn't have the acquired taste of a well made burger. Any burger cooked to well done/medium well TASTES LIKE CARDBOARD all crumpled up with peanut foams all cooked in the center. The burger was rubbery and hard and had the consistency of plaster. 
THIS PLACE DOES NOT SERVE GOURMET BURGERS. They are just calling it that to spike up the price.
Also their SMASH Fries- not good at all. Super oily and the rosemary Italian season is BS.

I had to work @ the forum shops for a few hours today early morning & between jobs at 2 boutiques I had some time to try and grab some fast breakfast. 
Boy did I make a mistake trying to eat here. 
After noticing that the smash burger was the only place open early besides the coffee place, I ordered a breakfast burger. 
I received a receipt and a vibrating pager and the lady at the register (Genell) was very pleasant and welcoming. 
I sat down to write up some paper work while I waited. 
After realizing that others were getting their food before me and they were here after me. I checked my receipts time stamp. 20 minutes?!?!? no way I thought, since they were literally empty and all they were selling was breakfast burgers. 
I asked Genell where my order was and she walked over to the cook and they were both puzzled as if I had just asked for the impossible. 
When I saw the cooks pissed look as he slipped on his latex gloves on his face, that's when I decided to just get a refund of the order and the tip I added. 
After having to wait for (Pedro) the manager to come & authorize the credit card refund I asked him what went wrong and he had nothing to say but ""can I get you some food?"" Nah, I'm good. I'm not trying to receive anything for free and in bad terms. 
All I wanted was some quick breakfast and not a bunch of BS.

Me and my hungry belly stroll up to the counter and place an order. The ordering process was quick - no problems there. I waited around the corner where they call out orders. I got a smash burger with cheese and added an egg, I also got the rosemary seasoned fries.... Let me just ask, who serves a burger with a fully cooked egg on top? That defeats the purpose.

At least, this one was better than the one I had in Irvine. Ugh. It's true though, first impressions are important. And for the one in Irvine in Socal, that one made me just be like wtf is this. 

But in the Forum Food Court in Caesar's Palace, I decided that I try Smashburger. Looking back, I should have tried Earl of Sammiches or something else not accessible/not eaten by me, but it was late, I needed dinner at 9.30pm, and this was the first thing I saw in the food court.

First off, really nice service. I was greeted by the cashier and asked how my day was. Heck, most of the places today, you aren't asked that, and as a visitor to a city, you get to enjoy that more to explain that you're from out of town and that you're all giddy with your Fat Tuesday cup that you got from just down the Forum Shops and that you're now hungers. 

I got the original, which didn't look cold, which actually looked palatable, didn't have a lot of oil, didn't look like a menace. It looked edible. A plus. It tasted decently enough like a burger would be, but you know it's fast food, not the gourmet burgers that you get.

It came out FAST. It took within a MINUTE from ordering to getting it to actually get the burger. I don't know what to say about that tho xD

Prices seemed higher for some odd reason, ($7-8), which seems kinda high for a burger.. Hmmm.",tgc4EiUhLO8nlws4Uy0fOQ,10,9,3,GuJEh87Yb-Cy1nLxzVYGwg

The Burger itself is small, reminiscent of the size of a McDonald's burger patty.  Albeit, fresher QUALITY. The taste was mildly salty and the smash fries tossed in salt and rosemary were tasty, yet again on the smaller side. The Oreo shake was great. Made with real big chunks of Oreo and ice cream.
