1420433,2015-11-21,15,xxAGaqYnboeR0SilS7DbAg,"""How great can a grilled cheese truck possibly be? I mean, bread and cheese isn't that hard to do. And what's with the ridiculous spelling?!"" Yeah, so that was before I tried this spot. I was wrong. I admit it. The wacky takes on grilled cheese sandwiches are inventive without trying too hard, and offer something for every taste. If Ludacris can do it, I guess it's okay for these guys. Plus, pun!

Finally found this truck at the Third Thursday event on my side of town- staff friendliness totally made my visit, though the Yelp check-in deal (free drink!) is pretty cool too. The menu is limited but has several sandwich options, as well as an app, a special, and a combo deal, and canned/bottled beverages.

The sweet lady taking orders was welcoming and positive, talked me through the menu and made her own recommendations. I was torn between two sandos, and she let me know I could half-and-half if to try two for $5. I added on the mac and cheese egg rolls too, because duh.

THREE WAY PARLAY: Their take on a classic grilled cheese, with three kinds of cheese and parmesan crusted bread. Oozing, gooey, deliciousness. The simplicity went perfectly with their parmesan wonton fries. Odd combo, but one that works.
THE HANGOVER:  Pretzel sliders, bro. Topped with drunken onions, grilled summer sausage, and pepper jack cheese, served with their special beer cheese spread (which I'd like to buy in bulk). This wasn't my favorite thing, but my BF really liked the meat and hints of spice. Reminded me of a pub burger. The onions and cheese sauce were my favorite parts. 
DADDYS ON A ROLL: Deep fried mac and cheese eggrolls with kimchi sauce. I almost didn't get these, but the reviews rave about 'em. The mac itself is actually a really good classic version without being bland or adding anything funky. The eggroll wrappers make them portable, and the kimchi sauce? It sounded like something I wouldn't like but added the perfect extra pop; it elevated the rolls.

The only thing I'd change about this place is to add a soup option or two- maybe only seasonally for the colder months, but a cup of tomato would have gone PERFECTLY with the 3-way. Something to consider! I'll be ordering again the next time I see these guys anywhere nearby.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,16,14,4,BJtKwuW1IJ7JlzmRdOeKiQ

Stripchezze has changed my mind on that. The egg rolls that are fried with mac and cheese inside are excellent and the kimchi sauce that came on the side added a nice kick. I expected to like the pastrami grilled cheese best and did like it but it was the Hot Streak that has pepper jack cheese and jalapenos inside and the outside bread has some sort of flaming hot cheetos crust that tasted damn good.

Not only do they stuff their sandwiches with delicious cheeses (and other stuff), but they sprinkle parmesan on the bread before grilling, so the outside gets that crusty cheese crisp.  They also serve their sandwiches with fried wonton chips, which are a nice change from regular chips.

My favorite sandwich is the Jam on it - yummy grilled cheese with bacon jam and fresh sliced tomatoes.  There is nothing bad about a grilled cheese with bacon and tomatoes.  It is SO good.",utS9ZAswZZx3QkegS_25SA,0,0,5,W0E90bZ3ljRmFusa0NpwaQ

3516798,2017-05-19,30,xxAGaqYnboeR0SilS7DbAg,"Stripchezze Food Truck is one of my favorite food trucks here in Vegas. Not only is Suzy and her crew always friendly and helpful, but it's very obvious how genuinely passionate they are about the type of product that are putting out. Quality ingredients are used and everything I have had has been packed full of amazing flavor. Don't expect to find any old school grilled cheese made with Kraft singles here at Stripchezze Food Truck, not that I have anything against those because they are tasty with tomato soup, no shame. These grilled cheese sandwiches however are on a totally different level and my taste buds are in love with them.

Daddy's on a Roll ($7) - Deep fried 3-cheese mac and cheese egg rolls with kimchi dipping sauce. These were delicious and not too greasy at all. My hubby liked the kimchi sauce with his while I found the mac and cheese egg rolls tasty all by themselves. Perfectly crispy. Very good and a must try. 

Jackpot Pastrami ($9.50) - Pastrami and Swiss cheese with spicy brown mustard and sweet pickle relish on Parmesan crusted sourdough bread. The bread is grilled perfectly and the Parmesan crust is very good. All the fillings paired nicely together and the pastrami had good flavor. 

Hot Streak ($8) - Pepper Jack cheese and jalapenos served on Permesan and flamin' hot cheetoh crusted sourdough bread with sriracha mayo. Yep, you read all that right! I figured this would be super hot and hard to eat, but not at all. The outer sandwich has just the right crunch and while there is some heat, it tastes great and the flavor is something I haven't had before. Give it a try once and you'll more than likely be hooked. 

Jam on it ($8) - Maple bourbon bacon jam, sliced tomatoes and muenster cheese on Parmesan cheese crusted sourdough bread. This one is by far my favorite! Packed full of amazing flavor, your taste buds will dance and you will constantly crave it, at least I do! That bourbon bacon jam is the effing delicious! I will be consuming many more of this particular grilled cheese that's for sure. 

This truck gets around town.

Stripchezze is a Vegas food truck that debuted last year. Judging from their Facebook page, they actually acquired the Chi-town Hustler truck and spent quite a bit of time developing their menu. They definitely improved on the former owners in both food and ""decor"" (the fancy paint job ubiquitous to these sorts of food truck).

Although they've made numerous appearances at a Henderson brewery or two near my home, I was wary at the odd spelling choice and therefore avoided them for a while. I finally tried them today at Sunset Park'd, a local food truck gathering, and I loved what I ordered. It was the Jam On It ($8 today) with Muenster, sliced tomato, and bacon jam on parmesan-crusted sliced sourdough, and a small amount of fried parmesan wonton chips. The gooey cheese was good, but that bacon jam was the absolute star. It was sweet and savory, and it made me forget that I'd just had another awesome food truck experience. The wonton chips weren't the most addictive crunchy snack that I've had, but they're a fun accompaniment to a sandwich that has a fantastic treasure.

Yeah, I'm gonna get that sandwich again some time. I split the majority of it with some friends, so I'll have to have a Jam On It for myself. Please come back to Henderson soon, Stripchezze! I'll be waiting.",_VMGbmIeK71rQGwOBWt_Kg,7,7,5,cmd2ireLagAWyMZeNF_u3A

I love when I am given an option for a smaller portion at festivals where I want to try many different options, but can only eat so much at a time.",3nIuSCZk5f_2WWYMLN7h3w,5,4,5,PuWVG7FvEM_CRDKhxcFPBQ

The number one must try item for sure is the Daddy's On A Roll, mac n cheese egg rolls. They come with a side of kimchi dipping sauce and are absolutely amazing! The outside is crispy and hot and the inside is like a cheesy hug to your mouth. I've also tried their Hot Streak sandwich before which was good, but not as good as the egg rolls.

You will not be disappointed and it is worth every penny. A huge thank you & shout out to whoever created that god-like snack.",OXSJCjKtvZPf-YPDCXcWZg,2,3,5,3vCabwuvYiz6zETsDwQxBQ

Walk up to this food truck, and prepare your taste buds for a show.
OH MAN, Let me start by saying I'm a Foodie/Epicurean. And it takes a lot of flavor to get my full attention.

I was at the Gold spike a week ago, and had the late night munchies. Decided to give the truck a try. 

Looking at the menu my choices seemed a bit limited. As I only eat chicken,fish,and turkey. 
But to my surprise the lady tending the window.""Susie"" i believe. Who has an awesome freaking personality.

Offered to make me a custom sandwich, with Turkey, tomatoes, and cheese.
The bread which I believe was sourdough, was grilled to perfection. 
The cheese hot and gooey and the tomatoes and turkey fresh.
It's hard to find a gourmet sandwich at a sandwich shop. But to think you could find one on a food truck in Vegas, unfathomable. 

But I did. And it is a must try.
Damn after writing this, I'm having flash backs. Time to find that truck.",TJThC4_fVEL3InuH1IrmpQ,1,1,5,9ZmvQOZEYHJjeq6rqpuCyw

They were at the Life is Beautiful 2015 festival, and I spotted that they serve mac 'n cheese egg rolls. I told myself I would need to get my hands on them before the festival ended and I finally had a chance to try them on the last day. They are oh-so-delicious. The ooey-gooey goodness of the mac 'n cheese made me moan the entire time. We also ordered the hot streak which is a grilled cheese with pepper jack cheese and jalapeno peppers served with sriracha mayo on parmesan and flamin' hot cheeto crusted sourdough. That sh*t was BOMB!!!! I love anything spicy. This was the perfect meal to end the 3-day festival. I couldn't be happier.

Stripchezze has the traditional grilled cheeses and other unique concoctions!

I ordered the two most popular the Hot Streak: Pepper Jack cheese & jalapeno peppers served with sriracha mayo on parmesan and flamin' hot Cheetos-crusted sourdough. The spicy gooey cheese with Cheetos crunch is a marriage made in heaven.  
 
Jam On It: Muenster cheese, tomato, bacon and jam on sourdough. This packs in a ton of salty, smoky, sweet flavor that pairs perfectly with the nutty cheese and crispy bread. 

The prices are reasonable, sandwiches will run you $5-$8. 
Suzy is friendly, nice and helpful person, she knew I was blown away from all the food so she pointed me in the right direction. The food can be filling so it's hard to sample everything, fortunately, you can go can half and half on the each item. 

Stripchezze is one of the easiest trucks to track through social media like Facebook, Instagram and Twitter. That's a huge plus!! 

I'll definitely be visiting this truck again.",bLExVDNKxXMjjZcx3YG36Q,5,3,5,wUve4ZntzhDbLpF7dQoqTA

Seriously.
this is my FAVORITE FOOD TRUCK IN THE WORLD.
Ever. 
Forever.

I encountered Stripchezze at Sunset Park'd...earlier this year? Last year?  I don't remember. 

I DO remember falling in love with the Daddys On a Roll:  mac n cheese wrapped in an eggroll  wrapper, and fried, with an AMAZING kimchi dipping sauce.  
I'm drooling just thinking about it.  

I've encountered them a few times since then, and usually stick to the Daddy, but last night I tried the Jam On It:  A gourmet grilled cheese with HOMEMADE BACON JAM on it.  (get it? Jam on it?)  
Oh. My. God.  

so good. 

I've always had amazing service.  The lovely lady who I believe is the owner has always been super nice, with recommendations, and a great smile for everyone.  

I can't wait to run into my favorite food truck again!!  
I'll be keeping my eye open on their Facebook and Twitter page to find them!",renPzRDqMZpMaHiCD_e1_A,1,0,5,XQf4mWZlZ0i9n7DxFSNLRw

They also had a wide selection of regular chips and drinks to choose from. Not sure what the prices for each sandwich is since they were comped by the event.

I had the Pair-O-Dice pepperoni sandwich my first visit and it was gooey greatness! The parmesan won ton chips served with the sandwiches and so good and quite a refreshing alternative to potato chips. 
The Pastrami sandwich was also amayzing, with layers of yummy meat & cheese and garnished with mustard and relish. It's kinda a new take on the Reuben, which is my fave sandwich by far! I almost didn't miss the Thousand Island dressing. It makes me wish I could Stripchezze weekly, if not more often!

I could have eaten another five of those. It was just an amazing combination. Their 3-Way Parlay was probably the most traditional item on the menu, but it had the perfect texture of sourdough and balance of cheesy flavors.
