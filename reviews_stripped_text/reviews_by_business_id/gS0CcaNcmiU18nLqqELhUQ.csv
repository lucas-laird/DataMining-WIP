734028,2011-12-29,0,gS0CcaNcmiU18nLqqELhUQ,"Before there were a lot of independent coffeehouses in Las Vegas (i.e., 7 years ago or so), places like Palio were the only refuge from Starbucks or other corporate coffee chains. What makes Palio interesting still today is that yes, it's in the Bellagio and so it's a Strip property, but it still manages to pull off great coffee and pastries, has a pretty cool European vibe and it's one place where service has always been good even though probably 95% of its guests are one-time visitors and not often very well-behaved.

The theme is Italian (Renaissance) and so the decor, pastries, gelato and of course coffee offerings all reflect that. Bold espresso, perfectly-foamed cappuccino and strong drip brews never disappoint and are served in a style that reminds you of Europe (until you turn around and bump into some wayward, lone tourist who's plopped itself down and claimed a 4-seat table without ordering anything, but I digress...) 

Seriously, the coffee's great and service is well-done. This place is also a pretty good date spot - try the eclairs, Napoleons or millefeuille along with that latte macchiato! - as long as you make sure not to go during high-traffic times. If you can snag one of the few tables near the windows, you can get a view of the Bellagio pool area with its trees and cabanas. 

3 stars overall, because it's a little cramped and when it's really busy, many tourists act über-entitled, pushing in front of you or blocking out table space or hovering around the creamer/sugar area for no reason. Plus, the coffee and pastries are a bit expensive and hard to justify at the price...until you remember you are on the Strip. Besides, it's well situated near the Bellagio Gallery of Fine Art, not on the main casino floor and somewhere that you can easily grab a coffee and for a few moments forget where you are. And unlike some other places on the Strip, what brings you back to reality is not the often-typical ""OK, whatever"" service ethic, but tourist behavior.",43nXxZLfX8nPUNzQlPpUeA,0,1,3,Ke7n2e6X3jBGcZ3Ah_L3XQ

It ruined my morning since all mama bears know that they need their coffee to function.  I ignored her and moved along.

I also had a tuna sandwich one time and the second time had a ham and cheese.  The tuna was better than the ham and cheese only because the ham and cheese was stored inside plastic wrap and the tomato made the bread somewhat wet, which is not appealing to me.

It's a bit hard to find a place to grab a quick bite to eat in the magnificent Bellagio, since most restaurants are sit down and take your time kind of places. Palio provides some great breakfast brioches, a healthy assortment of fresh and sweet berries, and really large pastries.  I mean really large.

The primary reason why I can't give it a full 4 star yelpin' is their prices.  For 2 people - 2 breakfast brioches, 2 freshly squeezed OJs, and a tray of fresh berries....almost $40. I guess it helped that the brioches were nice, warm, tasty, and exploding with meat (see image), but still...that's pretty pricey for a sit down, quick eats kind of place.

This cafe offers are large variety of sweet and savory cafe choices, juice, and European coffee, Quiche, Croissant, Brioche, bagels, coffee, lattes, and mochas. 

Third visit to Paleo. Remodeled from our first trip. Between the visits to dates we have tried the Brioche, Quiche Loraine, Dolce de Leche Croissant, Chocolate Croissant, Spanish Mocha, Coffee and Latte. 

The brioche with ham or bacon, egg, and butter was a good breakfast item. Brioche is like a savory muffin. Light, soft, and tender were the brioches. Delicious. The bacon was the better of choices. 

Similar to the brioche was the quiche which comes in vegetable or ham Loraine. We ordered Quiche Loraine. It was a little heavier than the brioche but not lost in the flavor. Meat was a bit salty but not bad. Soft in hold. Not bad at all. 

The croissants were buttery light and  flaky. Sweet were the dolce de Leche and chocolate. Not too sweet but a fair balance of the filling to pastry. Scrumptious and so good. Could eat ten of any of these and not feel guilty. 

Tried the coffee, lattes, and the Spanish mocha. Made European style. Fresh and bold. Definitely eye opener or a good day starter. No shortage of energy after drinking these. Best drink was the Spanish mocha. Probably one of the best coffee or espresso drinks I have ever had. The Spanish mocha was sweet, balanced, fresh and hot. 

This place gets busy and the line moves quickly. A little pricey for menu but competitive with other cafés and coffee bistros in the area. Staff is friendly and generally efficient. Generally stocked pastry case. Seating can get full inside or out at the patio area outside which was a nice added area in the last year. 

Overall this is one of the best breakfasts spots I have found in Las Vegas. Menu items are rightly portioned, balanced flavors, and outrageously delicious.

Starbucks carries this for $2 and we all know they are priced high too.  But when you have that 2:30 feeling, you do what you got to do.

The word is out and now everyone seems to flock here in the mornings. The lines do move but they are longer and seating can be tough during peak times. The food and staff are still top notch and I literally dine here every morning I'm in Vegas.

Now the secret is out, so just leave me alone and let me enjoy my wonderful bold coffee, smoked salmon platter and Nutella croissant.

I'm mad. Really, really mad!",qnOkZ1mOfLVCIBPMfyOStg,1,1,5,YiE8cJYoUoy3U10N_otuog
5070519,2016-06-18,0,gS0CcaNcmiU18nLqqELhUQ,"Why do so many reviews discuss whether or not Palio is overpriced? Because two things are simultaneously true: 1.Its price is at the lower end of cost at the Bellagio; 2.For the quality of what you get, it's some of the most over-inflated food in Vegas.

The food isn't made in the Palio. It's made in a kitchen that distributes to other MGM restaurants. The pastries are good but literally interchangeable with most pastries in the Bellagio because they come from the same kitchen. Sandwiches are below Subway quality, given above Subway prices, and presented with the hopes that you'll be caught up in the Vegas mythos and miss the fact that you just ate fast food that a chef put together hours before you woke up.

The employees are clearly not trained to be baristas. Espresso-based drinks and spiked coffee is some of the worst in the strip for some of the highest prices.

The outside porch has a gorgeous view of the pool. If you bought a croissant, a simple cup of coffee, and sat outside you could have a nice breakfast. Anything beyond that, and you'll wind up seriously disappointed.",wWiHJxaSi2yX2cwIj2sY7g,2,0,2,SCWg2d_v89xhY6FVy7AGWw

For lunch, we ordered the chicken wrap, albacore tuna sandwich and cobb salad to share. The wrap was pretty dry and needed mustard and salad dressing to make it really tasty. The cobb salad was really fresh and delicious and the balsamic vinaigrette was perfect. The coffee and cappuccino were also super and I always appreciate free coffee refills! The pastry options also looked pretty temping!",dfYNTBw--CYlZbFz581kYQ,2,1,4,ympwlhh7uXlDG54maZLRwg

Triply benefitted by the new autumn display in the Conservatory, free passes to the Painting Women show at the Gallery of Fine Art, and the fact that I was picking up a friend from Columbus for brunch it was with nearly fourteen miles of early morning running already under foot that I entered Palio Café, the recently renovated space never to be confused with the concept of 'paleo-friendly' in any way, shape, or form.  Located across the hall from the aforementioned gallery, in a flag and tile clad space featuring outdoor dining offered for those lustful for fresh air, it was just minutes after the restaurant's 6:00am opening that I entered a small queue and with a plethora of pastries gleaming behind glass a substantial order soon took shape.  Obviously far less famous than celebrity-backed bakeries touting the names of Keller, Payard, Buddy, and Jean-Philippe but no less innovative in its offerings my experience at Palio began with a duo of croissants and although the explosively flaky almond rendition instantly set a new standard for The Strip it was the overstuffed Dulce de Leche version that soon stole the show - each delicate bite through arches of crisp lamination yielding a burst of creamy caramel that my early arrival found still-warm.  Quickly devouring both croissants before scaling back to a ""some for now/some for later"" approach to the rest it was in the doughnut and cinnamon roll that I next partook and although both were nicely made, the former sporting a pleasant looseness to the crumb beneath light notes of citrus, neither were 'must orders' compared to what followed - a toasty gold pocket chock-a-block full of hazelnut spread that I'd strongly advise sitting down to enjoy as a grab-and-go approach is almost assured to end in a trip to the laundry for shirt, pants, or both.  At this point turning to more portable items as I slowly wandered the tourist-free serenity of Sin City's early morning hours it was next in a bearclaw that I indulged and although nicely textured I personally found the results far too sweet, the lacquer of glaze entirely overwhelming  sparse nut filling and thus leaving me to instead focus on a duo of cookies, the Chocolate Chip a textbook rendition with crisp edges surrounding a soft center but the Oatmeal Raisin far better with buttery notes playing off cinnamon and softly set oats as a mountain of golden raisins added just enough sweetness to taste equally breakfast and dessert.

Undoubtedly underrated due to the lack of celebrity signage and a location slightly off the beaten path, suffice it to say that Palio Café is executing on just as high a level as Bouchon, Payard, and even Bellagio's own Jean Philippe.  While some may say that prices are high, at $4.25 the croissants are no more expensive than the inferior versions at other on-strip vendors while other options actually represent a bargain compared to its peers, both here in Las Vegas and across the nation.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,3,1,4,pVrObL5bgsuSa180Sip0wA

The chocolate croissant was boring and very average. The dulce de leche croissant was HUGE and delicious. The caramel was oozing out all over. It was messy and awesome and I would go back just for that. So go here, get the croissant and share it with someone because it is way too big for one person.",d_TBs6J3twMy9GChqUEXkg,2,0,4,FX-N_fgLBW7tc1qsrdbZAQ

I adore the decorations on the walls and ceilings - the colorful British tea plates complement well with the wooden chairs and tables. The drinks selection is limited compared to Starbucks. Neither chai tea nor green tea is available. The mocha is decent, but it is too bitter for me. Palio is a great place to rest and chat for friends.

This little cafe serves fine coffee, cold-pressed juice, salads, fruits, soups, sandwiches and pastries..........kinda like an ""up scale"" Starbucks!

Although on the pricey side..........I must say the coffee they serve here is quite exquisite! 

If you're ever in the area, it's worth the time to stop by for a cup of joe, and have one of them award winning pastries!",-9da1xk7zgnnfO1uTVYGkA,4,4,4,vjciZlGVGjfqElrWWuQznA
