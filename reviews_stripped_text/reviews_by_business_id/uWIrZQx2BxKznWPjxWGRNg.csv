I asked the Bartender Mark if he could lower it and he got an attitude and he later told his boss Todd Parmelee Director of Operations that me and my buddy said a curse word at him, which did not happen and then I got a nasty email from Todd Parmelee. I will never go their again and the service is horrible. Todd Parmelee recommended for me to take my business to Buffalo Wild Wings.

I am a golden rewards member and pretty much only game at Pt's or Sierra Gold.  So I stopped at Pt's right next to my apartment tonight to have a couple drinks and some food.  I was at the bar by myself gaming and my friends arrived so I cashed out, tipped kindly and moved to a table right behind me at the bar.  The server must have just ended her shift, she was on her phone and ignoring us.  We just wanted a quick bite and another drink.  We gave up on her after 20 plus min.  Went to the bar and ordered food.  The food came quickly and was great.  The two girls bartending seemed to have left but the late night bartender, the gentleman with longer hair in a pony tail, the same guy that cashed me out when I was gaming was busy at the bar dealing with other guests.  We completely understood as we are in the service industry.  about 15 min. later we finally got his attention and received our bill, it was a little high so I asked to see the print out.  The drink that I had while gaming prior to my friends arriving was still on the bill.  I explained to him calmly that I was gaming over $20 max bet and it should be a comp.  He argued then got quite loud so other guests heard him and turned towards us, telling me that I should take it up with the girls that were at the bar before him.  He said he did not see me put $20 in the machine and could not do anything about the comp.  I explained to him that he had cashed me out and he witnessed me leave a good tip.  He said there was nothing he could do.  At the end of the day, you have to take care of your guests.  I gamed and still was not taken care of, my party was ignored, not even acknowledged and not treated as if you need our business.  I will not be returning to this Pt's location and I will take my gaming and any business for that matter to other establishments, maybe I will find one that actually cares about their guests.  I hope you find this email informative and sort your problems out.  I will never do business with pt's or sierra gold ever again, end of story.",4JjO0P4cIJVpvldxhnMu1Q,1,0,1,O7FcL6dBnpMU7R6tCSt6mQ

At first we walked in and decided to sit at a booth the waitress must have seen us about 3 times never came and greeted us or gave us the heads up that she would be with us shortly atleast. So my husband and I decided to sit at the bar and sure enough the Bartender was so courteous and attentive and with a great energy. As far as the waitress she was right next to us and again didn't even bother to even hand us a menu. I wish I knew her name because service like that makes people feel they shouldn't come again. She was black and had medium length black/brown hair. If a manager see's this maybe she needs a little bit of coaching on customer service. Anyway the food was AMAZING we had the nachos for starters and wings for our main dish and it was delish! The bartenders and guy waiters were phenomenal and so nice!

He said ok we will have it right out in about 5-10 min. Later. All of our other friends had left by this time about 20 min.

We waited for quite awhile before our waitress took our drink orders. She brought our beverages (just iced tea and water), and we had to ask for menus. That took awhile longer. I ordered the Bikini Wrap, but with honey mustard instead of ranch, no onions, and sweet potato fries.

The meals came...but with no utensils. We had to hunt her down for those. Mine had regular fries instead of sweet potato fries. We signaled for her, and she apologized and took the plate. It took FOREVER to get the replacement meal, and when I did, the fries were completely overcooked..Almost burned. SIGH.

Ok, so the wrap has to be good, right? Nope. It was FULL of onions, and had the ranch, not the honey mustard I requested. I tried to pick through it, but I was pretty disappointed. Our waitress never came back to check on us.

Another waitress came over to clear our plates and give us the bill. We did mention all of the issues, and to her credit, she took my bikini wrap and the iced tea off of the bill.

Unfortunately PTs Gold dumped my favorite bartender/friend rudely and without cause. I put up with their mediocre food and so-so beer selection for the sake of hanging out with the best and coolest bartender in the entire state of Nevada, Ken. To add insult to injury they have exiled my bartender friend from even coming into the bar for ""security reasons"" which basically means they know he would explain to regular customers like myself what jerks they were and would turn us against them. I was against the idea of falling love with a corporate establishment, but the bartender made it all worthwhile. Without him, it is just empty and another chain bar in Las Vegas with crappetizers and Bud Light.  Here is one last cheer to Ken, unfortunately it will be from BJs Brew Pub or some other competitor of PTs since I will not be returning.
Update: I also just found out that this chain will only play Fox News.  You can switch up the stations but if news is going to be played, it absolutely must be Fox News.  I find this odd and completely closed-minded.  I am a liberal person and if I owned a chain of restaurants and someone wanted to come in and be brainwashed by Fox News, I would certainly allow my staff to change it to this terrible news station.

He is attentive and always looks out for me to make sure I get some kind of snack or something for my gaming.  My complaint is with the company itself, not the location.  They used to give us bonuses for playing with our players cards and you come in and get a nice $10.00 playing bonus or something.  Well, that is obviously GONE!  and it sucks too.  I've been bringing friends and they sign up for the card and in one sitting between the three of us we played about $1000.  I just knew two nights later I would have a great players bonus on my card.  But nope!  Nothing.  I was told that they suspended that for now.  Really?  C'mon company dudes!  Give us a bone.

4265814,2015-12-27,1,uWIrZQx2BxKznWPjxWGRNg,"It's PT's. This location is bigger than other ones I've visited. Let me just get to the food I recently ate. 

The nachos are not 5 star or my favorite as they use the liquid cheese. But I don't have much complaints, you come and eat after a couple drinks or when hunger strikes at 2am., and by then, it is pretty good. 

The chicken strips with buffalo sauce is actually one of my favorite here. I can't believe I'm speaking such blasphemy, but, a friend of mine was shocked at how good it was. So let's just say I may not be cray cray after all. 

Pizza tastes like cardboard. I say stick with the chicken strips, tater tots (shockingly tasted like butter) and nachos (no meat is what I get). 

They have HH from 5pm-7pm and 12am-2am on drinks and maybe just the pizza. not many food options available during HH.",B1829_hxXSEpDPEDJtYeIw,2,2,3,mkBOWpQdw50DgfiO8U-iyg

The other PTs food is somewhat lacking and at this one everything came out great! Super inexpensive for how big their portions are.

4654451,2015-06-23,1,uWIrZQx2BxKznWPjxWGRNg,Never again! I've tried out multiple PTs and every single time they charge me even while I am gambling. You have to actually bring it up to the bartender for them to comp your drinks while you are gambling. Putters is such a better group than PTs. How was it possible that I was $400 in gaming and had 1 beer and 2 shots and still managed to have a tab?,NlsfkoQ66tSUg-JBbqQeMg,1,0,1,Nc5FKyKttmXtjMj1aeC1vg
4766475,2012-09-25,0,uWIrZQx2BxKznWPjxWGRNg,"Great staff!!  Food leaves a bit to be desired, though.  The staff is the main reason we come here because they are all great.  Typical machines, but the PT's players club is among the worst I have seen.  If you are looking for a place to have a drink and relax, this is a winner.  If you are hungry or want to gamble and get a return on your money, no!

Biggest problem with the food is if the fryer goes out, so does 90% of their menu.  The last thing I want with an alcohol hangover is a grease hangover as well.

If you are in a bind or on a diet, they do have one or two wraps as well as a few decent pizzas.",dM2Pvd9v-hewm3oZpLczNw,0,0,3,4v5NTteLnQ7Bk03eYgwJVQ

We were going to order food and possibly more than 1 drink, but that's all that was offered considering we spoke with her once and that was to simply get our initial drink order. Another 20 minutes passes and we just thought, we could've already eaten at the Sonic Drive Thru as well as gotten our own drinks at the local Maverick gas station, so we went and did just that. 
Never we going back, and I legit live across the street. Just not worth the wait, especially if you actually want to eat.",yI7gD7hfKO8VM6yu9auW3w,0,0,2,AhNHXwqjYsw11ycYq4SlXg

The staff are decent, drink prices are average, but happy hour 7 days a week, that in itself deserves 3 stars!  There pizza's are good.

Friend ordered French fries for me because I was on the phone and that's all I wanted. $7 for French fries. A normal portion. That's ridiculous. And they're not amazing fries that would be worth that. Not even Red Robin charges that much and their fries are bottomless. And the same quality. That's ridiculous. I won't be back. I don't expect to pay $13.14 for French fries and a couple of non-alcoholic beverages.,FF7C0VL0O2uueB16aY2sSA,2,0,2,8C8BXd9Ga4m5gVq9jRH4Ww

Wasn't a big deal. Good amount of room in the place and a nice area to play billiards.
