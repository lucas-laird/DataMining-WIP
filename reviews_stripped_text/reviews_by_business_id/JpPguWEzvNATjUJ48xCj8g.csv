1128962,2015-06-21,1,JpPguWEzvNATjUJ48xCj8g,"We've been living in the area for 5 years. At our sons 1st birthday party in 2012 we discovered North Side Nathan's (the restaurant previously at this location). Truthfully, we loved North Side Nathan's and were sad when we learned it closed.  

When our daughter turned 1 we wanted to order pizza and had the occasion to try Pizza My Dear. 

We were more than impressed. I know what you're thinking. ""What's there to be impressed about with a neighborhood pizza restaurant? Pizza is pizza."" For the most part you'd be right. 

What made the experience one that caused me to write this post... And one where we will for sure be returning to Pizza My Dear was the service. 

Once the person who answered the phone caught on that we were ordering pizza for a party she took over. She asked, how many adults, how many kids? And she explained to the slice how many pizzas we needed to order based on how big the slices were. The next part was rather comical. 

She asked what time we wanted the pizzas delivered. Then my wife and I did the thing where I would yell a question to her and she yell back the answer and all of a sudden were in one of those three way conversations between me, my wife and the nice lady on the phone. So the party was at 5pm. My wife wanted the pies delivered at 3pm (you know... Just in case they were late). The nice lady insisted... ""If the party is it 5pm we will deliver at 4:45pm. We really don't want our pizzas sitting out that long."" We agreed an ended the call. But not before the nice lady offered to send a complimentary order of their cheese sticks. She didn't have to do that. 

At 4:40pm the doorbell rang. Pizzas were in time and they were great. And the cheese sticks were gone first by the way. I recommend them!!",i7ei6g4AR-PYlR743xw01Q,3,1,5,cLiuCFhplz6rX1FOlD6W_Q

I like that they have lots of choices for toppings and sauces- more than average.
 The dough tasted fresh and was cooked perfectly. Not too thin and not too thick, soft center with a lil crispness out the outside. I've ordered the same pizza 3 more times since.

Menu states the salads feed 2-3 people, which I initially scoffed at, but they actually are pretty huge. My takeout box was so full that they provided plates to eat the salad. Unfortunately, they filled it with 99% veggies, leaving no room for the grilled chicken. I had close to a cup of pepperoncini but only four slices of  grilled chicken, less than an entire tender. Vegetables were fresh and dressing tasted bottled but tasty. 

When I asked the cashier which app she suggested, she stated the wings were her favorite- the six piece order, hot, was baked in the pizza oven and nicely sauced, with lots of brown crispy bits. 

I'd come back to try another salad. Their pizza descriptions sound good (especially the Bleu!) and the wings'll make a good game day takeout option.

A nice option at this restaurant is that you can get sun dried tomatoes and garlic. This blends with their traditional sauce for the most amazing flavor punch straight in the kisser.

I picked up the pizza with salami and pepperoni on it. It was hot, fresh and smelled like heaven. The girl at the counter was super friendly and joked with me just as they pulled my pizza out of the oven. Great timing! I took the pizza over to my husband's parents for a nice surprise. 

My husband's mom said the pizza reminded her of making fresh, homemade pizzas with her mom as a child. She said she hasn't had pizza like that since until now. I thought that was a heck of a testimony, so I wanted to share that conversation.

We then utilized Yelp to try some to look for another alternative. Cuz,' now, we all wanted pizza.  I was surprised that many of the other pizzs  places either closed relatively early, and, others were closed for the holiday. We came upon Piza My Dear.  

My only negative was that like every other food in Vegas it seem to be a bit expensive, especially since they charged us a $5 delivery fee woth an order over $50 (most others had no delivery fee).

We have a vegetarian,  and a gluten free in the group, so that post an extra challenge.

I work at corporate offices by the original location on Warm Springs and my coworkers couldn't stop raving about it. When I saw amazing yelp reviews and awesome pictures I was really psyched to see the newer location opened on the SW where I live and down the street from the LVAC I go to daily. Aside from Marco's finding let quality and slightly gourmet above average pizza in Vegas is rough even with all the mom pop wanna be so called east coast pizza places in just about every plaza that look run down and have heavy and greasy pizza. Nothing authentic or New York about it (where I'm originally from). 

Long story short got the personal size Surf m Turf pizza, Cheesy Bread, and Tiramisu. I came around 830 after gym thinking perfect non busy time where they wouldn't be rushed and expected quality pizza which I ordered in advance. When I got home both pizza and bread sticks were stale, cold, and dry as he'll and sadly didn't taste any better. There was nothing gooey, Cheesy, or fresh about it. I appreciate they offer more than the typical topping options of shrimp and steal, etc but the cheese and even sauce was non existent. Considering it was empty when I got there I'm just baffled it all tasted as if it was sitting out for an hour prior. I'm not a huge dessert person but Tiramisu is my one fav and even thay tasted like dry cake with layers of whip cream. Everything far from fresh or in a store made per the hype of this place. I get everyone has an off night but for the price and reputation I wouldn't expect such little quality. Would have loved to have found and new local spot I pass daily but so tired of how hard it is to find consistent places and actually get what you pay for..gasp. I might try the location by my work but sticking with Marco's from now on, where I should have gone tonight. What a let down!

UPDATE:
So I left a review for nothing more than the owners to know their quality wasn't living up to the reputation the night I went. I was beyond pleasantly suprised thay the lovely owner contacted me and offered me a credit to try out the place one more time. I really wasn't interested per not eating out often but respected this kind of speedy customer service as most business could care less about a bad review. I ordered a personal pizza and cheesy bread again, trying out the Hawaiian this time. When I got there to pick it up I didn't realize the very nice manager was the one who tool and made my order. He was very sincere and let me say WOW my food this time was amazing, night and day difference just looking at it before I left. Per the hype of everyone I know who loves this place the cheese sticks and Pizza actually were beyond fresh perfectiin this time with soft chewy crust, sauce, and the perfect amount of melted cheese. If I had shown you my order last time you wouldn't have believed it was from the same place. I now see whoever made it the other day just overcooked it times 500, and put next to no sauce or cheese among let it sit out so tasted like I was eating cardboard. I will definitely continue to come here when I need my pizza fix as its so close to my gym and I love the personal size option which is beyond filling however I can only hope the other employees would hold their standards of making food to those of the owners/managers instead of being inconsistent. My first meal after being looked at by staff should have never been served to me as opposed to them just assuming I wouldn't complain when I picked it up. That is a no go in the food industry as don't force the customer to eat the burned or ruined food just to save time on not having to remake it and wasting my money and business among losing customers. Most people take trying new places per first impression and that's it. 

Thanks again to mgmt for letting me try the menu at its best and when done right!!! :)",jBlS7lI93mB0wEDKFqZ6VA,1,0,4,wDunr_QxXXBMA--8Y415nw

I have been driving by this place for six and a half years.  We finally bought a home in the area a year and a half ago.  We've been going to the Rosati's on Hualapai & Desert Inn rd.  Never again.  

I ran out to get my boyfriend a steak sandwich before he gets home from work.  He said he already signed up with their rewards and give them his phone number.  I pulled into the Smith plaza from W. Saddle Ave (behind the Smith's), made a right on S. Old Flamingo Way.  It's dimly lit store front, and I wasn't sure it was open.  I parked at the door and went inside, it felt cozy, just like being on the East Coast again.


Angelique was my cashier, I asked how she was doing and replied with a smile, ""good and you?"", she seemed nice.  I let her know I'd like a steak sandwich with chips to go and my boyfriend signed up for the Rewards Program but didn't get a confirmation email back.  She asked for his information and added him to the program with our address and major cross streets.  She said it would be a few minutes.  I sat in their comfy chair by the kitchen and waited about 11 minutes and she popped out the kitchen with the bag of delicious aroma.

It was torture driving home with the to go bag, I made it home shortly after my boyfriend was home.  I heard, ""mMMmm"",  figuring it must be good if he isn't saying anything, ha ha!  He ate about three quarters of the sandwich and said he was stuffed.  I was eating homemade roast when he offered me the other half and I said sure.


I might of died and went to heaven.  The twelve inch bread, it's golden brown to perfection!  The peppers and onions were fresh.  The mozzarella cheese and the almost paper thin shaved steak was seasoned just right.  I honestly thought about if my dad ever decided to visit I must take him (he dislikes Vegas).   The sandwich is exactly like the place my dad would bring me to in Pawtucket, RI called House of Pizza.

I will definitely be back to try their New York style pizza!!!  I also want to try their tiramisu (my favorite).",_ykg4Fp8j_tU83q2tYC2FQ,6,2,5,0HKdPZsG5KtH6YSmNvdElA

3553853,2015-08-05,0,JpPguWEzvNATjUJ48xCj8g,"My girlfriend and I were entertaining some friends yesterday and decided to try PMD after getting a flyer for their new location. We ordered a large pizza (the specialty one with just lots of extra pepperoni), some mozzarella sticks, and chicken fingers.

First the good : the pizza was seriously the best delivery pizza I have had in the 5 years I've lived in vegas. The crust, sauce, and toppings were all 5 star rating, BUT....

The bad : the chicken fingers looked and tasted like something that should be served only in prisons. They were very obviously just frozen low quality, slightly oversized chicken Mc nuggets. Considering how good the pizza was I was suprised that they would even serve something of this low quality.  The mozzarella sticks were the definition of mediocre, also seemingly just frozen and fried, but not as bad as the chicken.

Despite the bad fingers and meh mozzarella sticks, I'd still not hesitate to order from there again just for the tasty pizza if it wasn't for the rude and moronic delivery driver. Our order was just under $40, and after giving him 2 $20's, my girlfriend gave him a third $20 and asked for change so she could tip him. He begrudgingly made change while making rude comments about this being ""his 3rd job of the day"", and then after getting his tip insisted that she still owed him another $20! Not wanting to make a scene or get me involved (because I would have made a huge scene) while we were entertaining guests, she just gave him the $20. So we paid $60 (plus the all time most UNDESERVED tip) for $40 worth of pizza. I expect management to make this right, the pizza was soooo good and I'd hate to deprive myself of it because of crappy customer service on our first order.",nmnQEiZkI_bRi3hec5Go3Q,2,0,1,wVMIIs419DIhZp9OJZQYWA

I have had the NY style pizza and that is decent I will stick to that if I ever get delivery from them again. I love fried raviolis and this place has them but it's really hit and miss if they overdo them. I don't know if this place is worth it.

Prices are very reasonable and they always include plates and condiments which works out great when I order pizza for the office.

When I asked my wife to order the Californian, she had ordered hella fast, so I didn't get a chance to sample their signature pizza. But I've tried many of their signatures and custom ordered pizzas from the Warm Springs location, but our pizza tasted nothing like PMD that I am familiar with. I will try to make another go at it and my review will be updated, positive or negative, we'll just have to see.",pqeKwn-cEaBMT3aN4lMQaw,0,0,2,-z8l6q238aEMdH-B7Xv4dA

I ordered (Carry out, 25 minutes) a pepperoni and cheese pizza with chicken wings, for the side of my family that still eats meat! Haha and they said it was very good, as for me and my wife I ordered a vegetarian pizza, with no black olive. It was very flavorful, lots of different flavor going on there. With their ""signature mozzarella sauce topped with mushrooms bell peppers onions and fresh tomatoes"".  I should've ordered extra mushrooms (that's my meat substitute). Overall I would definitely eat here again.",8W4969tAJqsmzQVeCRnRZQ,4,1,5,Xr_BssbsI_A_vyNm_CHaGQ

I placed an order for seven people at 11:45 am. My order arrived after 2 hours.  I called several times about the order, and all I got was, either he's on his way or I just spoke to him he's a block away.  He finally arrived with cold food, I called the manager while the delivery guy was here and let him know that he had just arrived and the order is cold.  He said to keep it, and I'll give you a credit.  I called today to use the credit, and was offered credit for only one of the orders. I asked for the manager that I had spoken to last week and was told he no longer worked there.  How's that for costumer service?  FAIL!",GAAP_WIN926RVt5t23C04A,0,0,1,Igj-BfxwXeixPLR91cjBqw
