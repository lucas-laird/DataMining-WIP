The staff were very friendly and attentive. We had Kalua pig with seaweed salad. it was very delicious. My son like spicy food ,so he had the flaming noodle . It was very spicy. he loves it. The calamari and malag were really good dessert . we orderd one more of each calamari and malaga to go. The smoith is fantastic.

I love Hawaiian food, I eat it all over the valley and go out of my way to find new joints. I even learned how to make some of my favorites. Tonight it was just bad. No flavor on just about everything. The mac salad was hard and tasted like just cold shells with no flavor at all (Mac salad IS a major part of Hawaiian). A couple other things about the place bugged me, messed up the order to begin with, no booster chairs for kids sucked, just a couple little things. I spent $35 for our meal and as a family we couldn't eat it and just threw it away and went some where else for dinner. Like I said, maybe it was a off night. I will not however be going back with so many other places to get the same food. I wish them the best and all I can really say is quality check your food all the time, if it is the cooks fault you need to catch it before it goes out, if it is just bad recipes then work it out. There are a ton of places around town you can go and see how they are doing it right. Sorry guys .. this place just isnt for me.",JpPoi78xP3PVxZvn1Gzlug,1,0,1,3TzhcFFCtFuTozaHaj98xQ
1090938,2017-03-15,0,kZ-ytO1SysT7mWchxwguZw,"Decided to try this place out because we had a coupon from restaurants.com. First of all, there was only one person running the restaurant. I don't know when they usually get busy, but it was around lunch time, so I would expect it to have at least 2-3 people working: 1 as the cashier, and the others as the cooks. Secondly, the cashier had a hard time finding the coupon tab because the manager has changed the system on him. It took him like 15-20 mins to find it. I think it's the responsibility of the manager or owner to let your workers know how to work a new system. Lastly, the food wasn't that great.

Char Siu Chicken: had a little bit of taste, but it wasn't char siu chicken
Beef Broccoli: barely any flavor
Vegetarian w/ Fried Rice: most of the vegetables were overcooked
Mini egg rolls (got them free for checking in): it was mushy, and there were only a little bit of filling
Hawaiian Garlic Shrimp: burnt
Fried Tofu: it wasn't crunchy on the outside 
House salad on the side of the meals: soaked in the dressing. I think they should put the dressing in a little container, especially if it's a take out order.

Having bad service is not the worker's fault. The worker, Jaemar, tried his best to work efficiently, but he was working the cashier and cooking the food. So whenever a customer comes in, he has to stop cooking for a little bit and take the orders. I give him credit. I think the food would've tasted better if it wasn't rushed. 

Sorry, but I won't be coming back again unless I'm informed that things have improved.",IHcynv4SeEJsa9zVB4TcKg,1,0,1,hYwvxigEkLkA6c4Hn1Ri1w

I was really disappointed that the chicken seemed so undercooked ( I am hoping that it wasn't; being that I just ate this less than an hour ago.) The consistency was rubbery and chewy, it made it rather unpleasant to chew and I spit the food out because chicken isn't supposed to taste that way.

1438607,2017-05-05,0,kZ-ytO1SysT7mWchxwguZw,"Positive: They honored the coupons with no hassle.  The mac salad was basic but tasty. The char siu chicken was decent, a little heavy on the 5 spice. The employees were very nice and friendly.

Negative: Everything else.  The kalbi ribs were terrible; very dry and salty. The Teri chicken tasted like they boiled chicken and then poured cheap old Teri sauce on it. The mochico wings were burnt and tasted like they were fried in old filthy oil. The garlic shrimp had the same nasty old oil flavor as the wings.  The adobo...wow. It tasted like boiled pork dipped in vinegar and cumin mixed with school lunch brown gravy. The lo mein tasted like what I imagine pig slop would taste like - greasy, super salty, mushy noodles.

Overall: Very disappointing dining experience.  I will not spend t any more money at Oh My Rice.

The unique menu is what caught my attention, decided to give them a shot.  I feel bad that the food was so unpleasant. I always want local businesses to succeed. It was definitely bad enough that I felt I should review them so others can at least make a more educated decision on where to eat. I would like to give them a second chance, but I can't justify spending any more money at the risk of getting a similar result.

1808652,2016-09-26,9,kZ-ytO1SysT7mWchxwguZw,"Hawaiian, Japanese, and Filipino, all on one menu- you can DIY your own fried rice or noodle dish, or grab an entree with kalbi, mochiko chicken, or abobo. We came in super hungry and tried a little bit of everything.

The mochiko wings were our favorite item, but they didn't really resemble mochiko chicken I've had elsewhere. Good flavor though, til we got to the last couple pieces that were undercooked and pink inside. 
I tried the Oh My Flaming Noodle- it is so spicy it should come with a warning! Definitely pair this with the mac salad or seaweed to help cool down between bites. My guy made his own rice dish and really enjoyed it. He also had one of their smoothies with boba, which was freshly made with fruit and juice. I do wish they'd marinate their boba though.
The manager came out to check on us and delivered a dessert for us to try, on the house- I didn't catch the name, but it's a Filipino rice pudding with ice cream? Interesting, not something I've had before.

Service was really friendly and the food came out quick. I'd keep this in mind for a takeout spot, particularly if you have picky eaters or vegetarians, as the DIY dishes can easily accommodate specifications.

I'd ordered the same dish a little over a month ago and thought I'd found my favorite chow fun so close to home, but this was not it. 

The owner walked in to the restaurant a few minutes later and I requested that he recook the dish for me. I was really hungry so I had started eating the tofu and veggies when he asked to take the food back to the kitchen, and subsequently mixed the same veggies with fresh noodles in his wok. I thought this was a poor judgment call considering the first cook had been so careless.

4014493,2017-02-06,4,kZ-ytO1SysT7mWchxwguZw,"O My Rice is a type of Asian fusion restaurant (they seem to be everywhere) that recently opened in my part of town.  Carbs carbs carbs!

This place is akin to your L&L and your Aloha Kitchen, with a mixture of hearty Asian cuisine from all over the world.  Filipino is noticeable on the menu, which is funny because not ONE Filipino in sight behind the kitchen!!  So, as such, we stayed away from the Filipino food because if it ain't better than my Mama's then it ain't worth trying.  Sorry guys.

We had a Yelp coupon that gave us I believe $20 worth of food for $12.  With that we decided it give it a go.  Wound up at O My Rice on a Friday night, it was pretty empty at the time.  Menu boards are pretty straight forward though.  Appetizers, salads, meals, noodles & rice, and desserts.  We wanted to maximize our Yelp coupon so wifey & I decided on a couple of meals and an appetizer to share.  We ordered:

*Kalbi Short Ribs ($10.99) - beef short ribs grilled with Korean BBQ sauce
*Mochiko Chicken ($7.99) - Japanese style sweet fried chicken
*Eggroll ($4.99) - 6 piece

Each meal came with your choice of fried rice or chow fun noodles & choice of house salad, mac salad, or seaweed salad.  For the Kalbi Short Ribs meal we got fried rice & mac salad, for the Mochiko Chicken meal we got the chow fun & seaweed salad.

Order didn't take very long, about 15 minutes from start to finish to be packed up to-go.  Boxes were heavy & packed well.  Quick, friendly service.  Under $20 to boot!

Once we got home, we discovered that O My Rice likes to do just that...O MY RICE!  They pack on the carbs!!  Our plate was heavy with more fried rice than meat!  A heap of mac salad!  The Kalbi Short Ribs was on the small serving side, 6-8 thin cut pieces.  Same went for the Mochiko Chicken, 6-8 pieces but with a ton of chow fun noodles and a decent size serving of seaweed salad.

The Kalbi Short Ribs were pretty standard.  Store bought marinade, nothing very special but they were BBQ'd well with nice burnt edges.  The Mochiko Chicken was much closer to a Teriyaki Chicken (it's possible they made a mistake) because there was no batter on the actual chicken itself, but the flavor was very sweet.  Wish the salad with the meals were packed in separate containers because by the time we got home, the mac salad & seaweed salad were warm and soggy from being in the same container as the hot food.  Pretty much a waste.

The eggrolls were not to my liking unfortunately - very little filling and too much of a sesame oil flavor.  They were fried OK though.

The standouts here were the CARBS!  The plain fried rice & chow fun noodles were tasty!  Must be the sauce they use or the way they are wok-cooked - really adds that Chinese 'breath of the Dragon' taste you get from cooking in a wok with high BTU.  Wifey & I really enjoyed that.

Would be back to O My Rice again if they put a larger serving of meat with the meal & they pack the salad separately.  I would probably have to have another coupon though again to venture out that way.  But it looks like our next order would be from their section of the menu where you can build your own fried rice or chow fun noodle plate.

I was very disappointed. charsu chicken was bland and boiled.....boiled! ""Hawaiian"" garlic shrimp tasted  like flour. Spam musubi and mac salad no flavor and not mouth watering. I did get fried tofu that was somewhat tasty but no sauce at all. 

I think this place has great potential but they should know just a little more about asain hawaiian fusion. It would make a huge difference and most likely get more business. Just a few tweaks.

Takes my order didn't have pennies for change (no biggie) then made small convo. Runs fingers through hair and walks over to get a drink. Comes back to front counter and digs in Halloween candy and gets gum.  counts money in register then is called back to finish food. Gum in mouth hands not washed goes in kitchen and starts to handle food couldn't see whole kitchen but from what I could see he used tongs. Get my food and go home no soy sauce but I make it happen. Food bland shrimp over cooked but spam musubi was good. I said I would give it a second chance but after two bowel movement and stomach pain today I'm having second thoughts. I let the manager know before I left my concerns and he said he would take care of them. So maybe in a couple month.,EXGMovm5s70B8Oe905M7PA,4,1,1,AvX1yIFIeJx_wzLdTeG7CQ

5388806,2017-03-15,0,kZ-ytO1SysT7mWchxwguZw,"This was the First & Our Last! This has to be worse experience ever at any fast food restaurant. It took 15 minutes to take our order , plus it took 50 minutes to receive our food To-Go. To make it worse, the food was horrible, ie: Beef & Broccoli with Fried Rice, it wasn't Fried Rice it was boiled rice & house salad had no flavor at all, the house salad looked like southern greens with no flavor or dressing-to make it worse they charge me $9.99 & the Meal portion was only $8.99, I asked why was I charged $9.99 and the cook said, probably was the tax, I laughed. I didn't ask for my refund because it would of taken probably another 15 minutes. My daughters  Char Siu Chicken with fried rice with house salad was the same as my the beef & broccoli, not worth the money. My Wife's Vegetarian with fried rice was horrible, looked like a pile of dog food. Our Hawaiian Garlic Shrimp 4 piece $4.99, was very burnt waste of money totally, Our fried Tofu $2.99 had no flavor and supposed to be fried, not fried tofu I don't know what it was. Lucky for me I had a $15 coupon, but if I new what i was purchasing I would of save my money. No Fault to our Cashier/Cook Jaemar, he was the only person working during the lunch hour and he was doing his best to cook the food & cashier at the same time & the food showed it. When we were there, two customers walked out and another customer wanted their money back, because they waited longer than 1 hour & the food wasn't even ready. The owner need to really focus on customer service and hire more employees to make his business work, not to just save $8.25 hour, while losing $50 to $100 hour, just doesn't add up! , Plus the food dishes need alot of work, ie. Flavor & presentation. This place needs alot of work, we won't be returning. Save your Restaurant.com purchases on the establishment.

Adjusting my review by adding a star. The owner contacted us directly to apologize for our experience on Fridat. That's super classy; he didn't have to respond at all. Might consider giving this place another shot based on his customer service.

Slowest service, terrible food. 
We tried this place because we heard it was ok. When we walked in there was 1 guy working and 1 lady in line. We ordered 4 meals and 1 smoothie. 35 minutes later we got our food. The chicken is stringy and tastes awful. He gave us mochiko chicken breast instead of wings. The Mac salad is inedible and the fried rice has a pool of oil in the bottom of the box and oil dripping from the rice. My daughter ordered a Sunrise Surprise smoothie - orange & pineapple. It came to our table purple. Not sure what types of oranges and pineapples they use here, but I've never seen purple oranges or pineapples. The server was rude and argumentative with regard to our questions. I totally understand being busy on a Friday, but no apology for our 30 minute wait, no apology for OBVIOUSLY making the wrong smoothie. 

Complete waste of a drive and our evening.",n1cGg7NpJspFPUcyYO4lzw,1,0,2,XD8f_r3HrKj94oN3K5HXUw

After tasting them (teriyaki, char siu, mochiko chicken, garlic shrimp, kalbi) I was afraid if we ate them any further we'd get sick.  It was sad but we threw it all in the trash. 

Maybe we went on a bad night when a cook was gone and someone that didn't know how to cook tried to wing it??  Idk, but with all the other options around I'll never go again and can't recommend this place to anyone.",LtRvzyLIPBYuJoOqfgGVyg,0,0,1,z5Dhbn1EtYtiYY8jfHVsew

I was going to go to my Go-To place Schwarma House across the street , but decided to give this NEW place a try. I ordered the Char-Siu Chicken with Fried Rice and the Seaweed salad combo. The Chicken was tasty and so was the salad. The fried rice was some of the most bland flavorless rice Ive ever had. I had my order to go and when I got home I had to dowse my rice with Teriyaki baste and glaze to give it some flavor. They also used so much oil in cooking the bottom of my To Go container was coated in heavy oil.

You can get an entree with choice of sides or go aka carte and select your rice or noodle then add meat and veggies. They cook everything to order, not buffet style, so that is a huge plus! Takes a minute longer but worth it.
Hawaiian and Asian blend with smoothies and several appetizers and deserts.
We ordered the Kalbi Ribs and Kalua pig with Lo Mien noodles and seaweed salad. All was very good with there own sweet chili sauce. One entry can be easily split between two people.  Entrees around $10 and very fair for the amount and quality.
Hope they do well- we will be stopping there instead of Panda down the road.",zBdfduwvbKUy8tnDLAM9Xg,6,2,4,DcteZyGBAXSppkbkYkXL0A
