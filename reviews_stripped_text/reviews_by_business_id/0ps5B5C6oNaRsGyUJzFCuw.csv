There was only 1 person working at the counter and it took forever despite the fact that there were only 2 people ahead of me on line. The woman's nametag said Miriam and she was in a funky mood with all the customers. I was very cheerful as I placed my order. As she assembled the sandwiches I asked her to place a word on the sandwich paper so that I would know which one was which. As she stuffed both orders in the same bag I asked, ""Did you mark one of them so I would know which one was mine?"" And she said no as she shoved the bag toward me and walked away. It was a bit disturbing when I noticed that she wasn't washing her hands after touching cash before she took the next customer. I don't plan on going back to Subway if staffers doesn't practice good hygiene. And as for the sandwiches, I just as well toss them out.",lD9ayeAcFIxZCkmrpYFUSw,0,0,1,ZtSoDtMOflNHW4ybW-YHrg

OK, thats fine, but when I cannot even order, I start to get frustrated and I order a sandwich and she look back at the menu where I was looking and starts to make the sandwich.  I told her I had to go because I was in a hurry and she did not understand.  I love the fact she wanted to work to provide for her family, but please learn the language first.  It will make your life so much easier and others so much less stressed.  Overall I am glad I just walked away and went to my room.  Maybe next stay will be better.",z8cf4pcU1vX4z1NOUCNrzA,0,0,1,CuaK-kQCpw8SrkGEoDPqBQ
1606559,2015-01-13,4,0ps5B5C6oNaRsGyUJzFCuw,This is a good location. I've never been to a Subway where the staff was friendlier. They really hook up a nice loaded sandwich and sometimes after hanging out downtown I like to stop here for a cold cut combo. No casino marks up here I got my cold cut combo for $5 plus tax. There is seating and the area was clean. I don't know what this Subway is doing so different but other locations could take a lesson because this is a great Subway!,eytpwJXgg5nWU6jrlQ6qAA,9,9,5,FD2QB0fh0x0Gb2sA7f9QjQ

3856202,2014-06-29,0,0ps5B5C6oNaRsGyUJzFCuw,"This is the Subway inside the El Cortez Casino.  The hotel gives monthly coupons for 99 cents coffee. ..and you can get one refill later!  The other coupon is for 2 free cookies with purchase of a 6"" sub!

They will only make fresh coffee for a paying customer.  Had to wait for new paying customer to get my refill.  

My first cup was just warm.  It came out of a pump pot.  Hmmm...",Ggx8iUdJ7lsQSqXRuclXtg,3,3,4,pm7fJATqMGV_jeznZ_Ehfw
4365305,2017-04-10,0,0ps5B5C6oNaRsGyUJzFCuw,"Located in the El Cortez, the sandwiches come in handy in the whee early hours. Aside from the usual drunken patrons during after -drinking- hours, the service is as fast as one person could possibly make it. I don't go out of my way to eat here for lunch or dinner, but I do make a point to come here for my 4am freshly made sandwich. 

If you gamble enough at the El Cortez (1941 points), you can get a $6 credit at this subway.",UrQw8IyTOAAlokN-SMK3_Q,1,0,4,JfPnMWqX9Ltm8nnummNscg

No complaints about this Subway other than the service could be a little more friendlier. The sandwich that I had on my visit tasted great!",17-uzTJOUMH6Betdw4jqhw,0,0,4,PyTSLV3llFkf6bPn2BdIkw
