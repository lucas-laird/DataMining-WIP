Dont get me wrong it was great but far from local.  I was surprised to see a piece of spam (that would be used for a musubi) laid out on top of my noodles, its usually cut up into pieces but thats ok too...like i said ..the flavor was great!  We also ordered a combo plate, spam fried rice, one spam musubi, and an order of manapua.  The bun (steamed) was good but the filler meat was just ok.  I wouldnt order it again.  The spam musubi - lol i would hope no one would fail at spam musubi!  The fried rice and combo plate were good.  Im not a fan of mac salad so i wouldnt be able to give an honest opinion.

Not dirty, so feel free to dine in if you want, it's just nothing special. My husband loves Hawaiian BBQ- he went to college 20 years ago with a lot of islanders and got hooked. Me, not so much. But in an effort to compromise we have searched for places that have a broader menu. This one is hands down the best. He can choose any plate or combo he wants with the macaroni salad and rice, and I am sure to find something I truly love as well. My first ever order was the Fried Shrimp Saimin Soup. So good. I branched out to the sugared donuts (Malasadas?) and hey- fried dough and sugar, can't go wrong there. Finally the other night I tried their Garlic Noodles. Omg- I thought I had died and gone to heaven. This plus one to two orders of Crab Rangoon (served with their pineapple dipping sauce- not just any old sweet and sour) is my go to order now. It is just amazing. The service is friendly and fast. We live less than 5 minutes away. I have discovered if I call my order in advance, by the time I grab my shoes and car keys, I arrive just as my order is finished. Prices pretty decent as well.

I don't know what they do to their meat, but I can't get enough of the flavor their chicken has. I could eat their bbq chicken every day and for some reason, their macaroni salad drives me nuts. When I go there, I always get an extra mac salad.

We got two of each and split them.  Both were very good.  The Kalua Pork had a nice smokey flavor and the Katsu chicken was very tender with a nice crunchy breading on it.  The sauce was sweet and yummy.

I also tried a bowl of the Saimin noodles, which is similar to ramen.  It had chicken, onions and a nicely flavored broth.

You will get a lot of food.  My parents took half of theirs home to eat for later.  The price is cheap and the food is very good and good quality meats.

1099105,2012-09-07,0,M-bM5y8qdE-Z3mfZept1EA,"So, my new latest thing is Hawaiian food. I have several Hawaiian co-workers, one who just left whom I miss dearly. Pining for her Aloha, I decided to try Hawaiian cuisine, and I am HOOKED! In the past month, I've been to three different Hawaiian places.

Ohana is the location closest to me, so I stopped on the way home from work. Now, on the other two places I went to (L&L off of Sunset and Stephanie - it's a chain, so I don't know if I will Yelp it yet, and Island Flavor, which will get a big ol' Yelp coming up soon) one of my favorite things is when I walk in, I'm instantly greeted by a big smile and a hearty greeting. But when I walked into Ohana, I got, ""Hi, welcome to Ohana.""

Oh. Well, that was less than hearty. Oh well, I shrugged it off. I ordered my favorite: chicken katsu with fried shrimp, and an order of pork eggrolls. The wait time was a little long but nothing too excessive, and when I picked up my order, I got a limp, ""Thank you.""

Eh. I took out my take-out and headed home, maybe about 5-6 minutes away. I dug in, excited for my Hawaiian feast...

Continued eeh. Even with the katsu sauce or gravy or whatever it is, the chicken katsu seemed really dry. So did the shrimp, which is really depressing, because shrimp is amazing. Shrimp is the seafood of the gods. Red Lobster Shimpmania or whatever it's called is like a national holiday and I drag people out with me (Emily R. will concur).. Dry shrimp makes Baby Jesus cry. And the accompanying sweet-n-sour sauce seemed more like the sweet-n-sauce from McDonald's than from a Hawaiian place.

Not that that sauce sucks. But... I want something a little better if I'm not at McDonald's!

It was okay, but that combined with the half-hearted service, it dropped it down to only three stars. I will probably go back and try it one more time to see if I just came in on an off day. I certainly hope so, because the proximity to my house could earn them a lot of my money.",8prr02BTumjFLYSLmMpO1Q,2,0,3,oNV0uZwNnSmpqGbvOQGj0A

I ordered the BBQ mix - you get chicken, one slice of kalbi ribs and bulgogi style meat. It also comes with rice and mac salad. I always forget to ask for no mac, as I usually don't like them - but this time it turned out ok. I actually at the whole serving!
 The chicken was good, juicy and full of flavor. The Kalbi was ok. It was what I expected from a Hawaiian joint (I prefer traditional Korean) - I would eat it again, but I doubt I would ever crave it from here. The bulgogi style meat was dry and a little bland. Even Chris wouldn't eat it (and bulgogi is one of his favorites!). 

Chris ordered the chicken katsu plate. It was a big serving and must have been decent, because he ate the whole thing! Oh, and the Katsu plate is the special 3 days a week!

The atmosphere is nothing special, but is definitely comfortable. 

The total bill for us with our 2 dinners and 2 small drinks came to $19.13, which isn't horrible, but definitely isn't the cheapest out there, either. 

It's not a new favorite place or anything, but the quantity and quality was decent. I think I might just stick to the chicken and kalbi ribs and skip the other beef. We both agree that it's not off our list, but isn't really a strong top contender, either.",sDlRFzGHzfpFHaxvJ1JtTg,2,0,3,dDv4yxV6KBehfDcm9hC-Kg

Ohana Hawaiian BBQ is located on the southwest corner of Warm Springs and Eastern Avenue. 

Wanting to try something new, we found this place on Yelp!. Luckily, the place was empty when we got there yesterday, so we were able to step and up and order something right away! The young lady was polite and answered a bunch of questions about menu items without showing the slightest agitation. 

I opted for the 2/2 combo, which allowed me to choose 2 meats to have with my sides of rice(2 scoops) and mac salad(1 scoop)($9.75). I chose the Hawaiian BBQ chicken and hamburger steak. How do you go wrong there, right? My friend decided to go with the Hawaiian Combo mix(also $9.75). We ordered a couple of small drinks and I honestly can't remember the price for drinks, but I can tell you they serve Pepsi products(Pepsi, Diet Pepsi, Mountain Dew, Sierra Mist, etc) and refills are free.

The place was clean and set up nice for the small area they have, with plenty of booths and tables available. They also have a TV set up on the wall playing ESPN. I definitely enjoy that!

I was pleased with how everything was going to this point, but now it was all about the food!

Arriving in styrofoam containers, the first thing that struck me was portion size. For your money, you get a healthy amount of food. Not only that, they certainly don't skimp on the meat portions! 

The chicken was freaking phenomenal! Extraordinarily tender and juicy, I found myself woofing that down in no time! The hamburger steak was tasty, as well. Covered in gravy, think a really, really good salisbury steak! I hadn't had salisbury steak in forever!

The rice was alright. You did recieve 2 scoops, so the portion was plentiful. It was a nice change of pace enjoying the mac salad. It's not too often I see this as a side, with the exception of some sub shops. 

I have a pretty hearty appetite and can definitely put it away, but I actually had to finish this off later at home!

I really enjoyed this place and have already made plans to  go back very soon to try other items on the menu! Can't find a good reason to knock a star off of their rating, so its ..

We've been there so often that we're on a first name basis with the staff; the cashier sees us come in, and all we have to say is, ""The usual!"" The employees are friendly and willing to chat. Prices are almost unbelievably cheap for how much food they give you. He always gets the barbecue beef with double rice, no macaroni salad, and I get the lemon chicken, lemon sauce on the side.
First, the beef. The best way I can describe it is juicy beef jerky, and even though that sounds weird, it's definitely a good thing! I've eaten it dozens of times now, and I still can't identify what's in the marinade. Soy sauce, garlic, honey? The flavor is too complicated for me to discern the individual flavors, but I don't really care. It's so tasty I just want to eat it, not ponder it's creation.
Second, the lemon chicken. Fresh from the fryer, crispy and tender. Really just perfectly cooked. Then, the lemon sauce. It's lemony and sweet, but enough tartness to keep it interesting.

Food:
* I highly recommend trying their garlic shrimp plate, so savory!

* Get the Hawaiian Sun Drink! Any of 'em!! You will not be disappointed. I just wish they had the Iced Tea flavor, but NO ONE carries that except International.
* The portions are perfect, however I always substitute the mac salad for extra rice. Nothing wrong with how they make it though, I've just never been a fan of mac salad.

I smiled, it sends you back to the days of true family restaurants where that was the team, which in turn creates the experience for customers.

Located in a little shopping mall next to a Walmart, Coffee Hunter, & more it was pretty easy to find via google maps. It's a little restaurant but pretty clean & lot's of customers when I walked in which is always a good sign. 

We ordered the garlic shrimp plate, seafood platter, & a free order of pineapple crab rangoon thanks to the yelp app. The garlic shrimp plate was super ono, tasted authentic like from back home. Seafood platter was a bit disappointing. I thought it would be a mixture of breaded & non-breaded like fried shrimp, some grilled mahi, but alllll of it was fried heavily. Probably my fault for assuming a mixture but that's something I won't be getting again. I will say though that they use a good quality scallop in the platter which I noticed after I scraped off the heavy breading. I'm just not really a fry girl but if you're into that then you'll like it. Mac salad here is alright, not the best I've ever had. Added a lil extra to it at home to liven up the flavor.

The BBQ chicken is BOMB, always like the pork Lua Lua or Kalua pork (sometimes a bit salty, but it's really good). I always get 2 Mac balls and 1 rice. The portions are heafty for the price, which makes me a fat n happy man. Have gotten the musubi a few times, it's good but a bit dry as others have stated.

Entertainment Book coupon participant BTW. 

Ok, it's funny, even though we were in Oahu recently, we like to get Hawaiian food soon after getting back- it's been a tradition of ours. We've been to the other one at Blue Diamond. We get the chicken katsu and BBQ chicken regular plates and split it. The plates come with two scoops of white rice, mac salad, and sauce. What we love about the katsu is the restaurant chain uses white meat- much better than L & L. One piece of the BBQ chicken was slightly undercooked (pink), and the chef was so cool about it- he cooked a fresh piece for us. We rarely finish our food- we always have leftovers. Offers Hawaiian canned drinks like Pass-O-Guava. Wish they had haupia too. 

It's clean, the staff is very nice (very friendly), and the food is great tasting, quick and reasonable. There are several tvs mounted up high, for your viewing pleasure. The wall near the doors has a small bulletin board where business cards are pegged- not many up there. The special is a teriyaki salmon bowl for $6.50- but the sign for it is located on the opposing wall on the far right (from the menu above the counter).

I go for the regular bbq chicken plate & I asked if I could get fried rice instead of regular. The lady taking my order said it would be 2.00 extra. So I agreed. I took my order to go since I live not even 2 min away. When I get home, I have loads of chicken and rice, but no mac salad? I call & tell her, & she tells me ""when you get fried rice, it no longer comes with Mac salad"" I understand, but she didn't tell me when my order was being taken. No biggie I guess since some people on here are saying it's bland. I just was looking for that cold refreshing taste with the chicken. That irritated me a little, but whatevs.

Anyway, bbq chicken is tender, juicy, and they do not skimp! Fried rice was plentiful as well. I paid 11.00 & I have soo much left over!! So I would say it's worth the trip.",5WmndveZPDKZJ32xmvL7Og,0,0,4,QVxE2ivvZajrViZyKcgkHw

4655445,2016-05-10,6,M-bM5y8qdE-Z3mfZept1EA,"Recently a hot and popular business named Coffee Hunter has opened in the southwest corner of Eastern and Warm Springs in the Walmart Neighborhood Market shopping center and is taking Las Vegas by storm. In its shadow is a hot and established  Hawaiian barbecue restaurant named Ohana Hawaiian Barbecue that has taken me by storm. The few times that I have spent time in the hot and popular Coffee Hunter was after filling up my appetite in Ohana Hawaiian Barbecue. 

     There is nothing fancy about Ohana Hawaiian Barbecue. It is similar to a nice Chinese take out restaurant with a few tables that serves large portions of delicious food. And, It is their large portion of the mini plate lunch barbecue chicken that I have consistently ordered with a fountain beverage. 

     In Hawaiian ""ohana"" means ""family."" I have yet to feel like family. On the friendly scale, I'd give the employers a 3 out of 5. My main contact has been when I ordered and paid for the food at the counter. A few minutes later, the same employee would deliver my food and the napkin to my table that overlooked a picture of Hawaii. It is interesting that the restaurant goes all out on the food but scringe on the napkins. 

    The droll thing about the mini plate lunch is that it truly is massive. For $6.50 before taxes, the styrofoam plate includes large pieces of barbecue chicken, a scoop of white rice, and a scoop of macaroni salad over lettuce. Their food has always been tasty and filling. To add additional flavor to the food, I have taken advantage of the sauces on the table when I poured hiercha sauce on the barbecue chicken and soy sauce over the white rice. 

    It is funny that early in this review, I compared the restaurant atmosphere with a Chinese take out restaurant on account of the fact that Ohana has expanded into Asian food. To the left of the counter there is a menu of Asian food dishes that include Chinese food. This menu is nothing compared to the large menu on the wall starboard of the counter that displays the sundry of Hawaiian dishes. Personally I will probably never find out what their Asian dishes taste like considering that I prefer an Asian restaurant for Asian cruisine and a Hawaiian restaurant for Hawaiian cruisine. 

    Ohana lives in my mind as one of the many great Hawaiian barbecue restaurants in the Las Vegas valley. Currently the advantage that Ohana has over the others is that it sits in the shadow of the brand new  hot and popular Coffee Hunter. It serves a fantastic and affordable lunch that ties in with subsequently hanging out in the Coffee Hunter.",0tvCcnfJnSs55iB6mqPk3w,12,10,4,JG7X-XKUF-g5sMeje3GAGg

The interesting thing about this place was the variety of choices on the menu. Obviously you'll find traditional Hawaiian items, but you can also order Chinese, Thai, and some American items too. I'd probably stay away from ordering a cheeseburger at a Hawaiian restaurant, but I won't fault them for it. If I go to a Hawaiian restaurant, I'm there to eat Hawaiian food. I had the BBQ Mix plate and it was enjoyable. I had enough leftovers for lunch the next day. I'll definitely be here again.",s8v5KKrZShVK29M4XP8Q3A,1,0,4,aqHsw2ejdG4Cyyj-IPvhAA

Almost a meal in itself. After being impressed by the simple appetizer, I decided to give their other menu item a try.

The beef chow fun was ok. The noodles were not greasy, but the meat was kind of dry. It was not the melt in your mouth kind of beef I have had elsewhere in a chow fun dish. Probably would not order again.

The pork manapua was good. It had seasoned pork inside, but not to be confused with the sweeter char siu red pork. I enjoyed the smaller size of them and four came in an order.

The Spam and Eggs rice plate was ok too. The regular size portion is huge! It also comes with a big scoop of macorini salad. You also get the option of getting the egg scrambled or sunny side up. I went with the sunny side up. The spam was seared well so it had a good charred crust on the outside. The eggs were not seasoned, but I suppose there is enough sodium in the spam already. I added salt and pepper layer, but that's just my preference. 

The Salt and Pepper Calamari was a surprise winner for me. It was tender and had a good batter on the outside. A little salty and a little heat was just enough contrast of flavor for me. I also got two free eggrolls because my order was over twenty dollars. The eggrolls were kind of greasy and was the vegetable kind I was not a fan of.

The service is very friendly and pretty fast. The dining area is clean, casual, with a decent amount of seats. They have a TV in there and it usually is showing a sports game. Sometimes basketball and sometimes football. Overall, I would come back again for the spam masubi and salt and pepper calamari.

Loco Moco mini lunch plate
*everything I expected it to be! Flavorful and very satisfying
Would order again

Pineapple crab rangoon
*simple but delicious
Would order again

Plain Saimin
*Broth is very flavorful! Noodles are oily but tasty
Would order again

Side of mixed veggies
*wouldnt order these again...broccoli was yellowing and there were dark (mold?) spots on all the veggies

Side of curry
*50 cents for a side! I have never had curry from Hawaiian place before so I was scared to order curry dish without trying sauce and I'm so glad I ordered a side of it because OMG it is delicious! It tastes like a cross between indian curry and thai curry almost. Very delicous, and a tiny bit of heat!

Spring rolls 
Macaroni salad
White rice
*all of the above come with the lunch plates. I love the mac salad! 

Spam musibi
*It's like a giant sushi roll but with spam! Would order again

4 is great, someplace I would love to go back to again and again. Backup options to bring/recommend to a tourist

The service is alright aside from the cook who always stares me down. I think he wants to have my babies.

I would suggest avoiding their Chinese food; it is nothing special.",I3zseg5YCXnuuqGwgX4gfg,0,0,4,SZpTQAnLFPnUc-cxsrg0yg

I have never had better anywhere else. The hubby orders the BBQ chicken plate and my son loves the chicken cutlet with gravy. Even the saimin soup is delicious! 

Honestly, I could order everything on the menu and never have a bad plate. The service is friendly and helpful, and the portions are large, so you will have leftovers. For the price, you cannot beat Ohana!",ShPNNs-sbMvrjTT0BuPvcA,0,0,4,f7YIALVBZHzouocLhm3m3g

We ordered quite a lot:
 - Salt and Pepper Calamari - large pieces with good amount of flavor
 - Pineapple dipping sauce with Fried wontons - the dipping sauce was heavenly
 - Chicken katsu - the same everywhere else I've tried it (which is still good, but not noticeably different)
 - Spam Musubi - Look for comment above ^^

So close to home, A LOT of selection can't go wrong!",ANLSKvFmCgRMjxtELq70FQ,2,2,4,jVnqW9rzGN3N9YpeJ00qsg
5889402,2018-05-06,0,M-bM5y8qdE-Z3mfZept1EA,"Ohana Hawaaian bbq, I believe it is one of the more entertaining Hawaiian restaurants in Las Vegas.  It is located in a competitive location where in n out, del taco, i forgot the Memphis bbq.   This place stands out the seating is split to two sides, the fast side and the slower side but owned by the same owner.  The menu is big and they even have pho here.  Menu is vibrant.  Hawaiian bbq is  on point but the pho was just okay, too much noodle that is why for the 4 stars. The staff are nice, accomodating though.  If i were on blue diamond and Eastern  i would come back for sure",DsVnd4PH2nkbxo8UeGW3Mw,0,1,4,kJFbLT1yFntn3wuYJB_DVw

The facility is really clean and feels a lot like a local restaurant i'd see in Hawaii which is a plus. The lady who worked at the front was very kind. The biggest downfall is that it's not the quickest place to eat. Definitely expect a long wait for your food. 
At the end of the day, I'm glad I tried this place out, but I'm not sure it's a place I'd come back to. I would say that there are much better options for Hawaiian food out there.",VJHKjBELocrf5Eh-QxScLw,1,0,3,wb9Tjamxfb3yL7I68veXHA

I have eaten at L&L, and I have always been disappointed in the quality of their meat, and the ghettoness of the restaurants.  

Ohana seems to still be small and authentic (like L&L), but it seems cleaner, and the meat quality is higher (Seems like grade B meat, rather than L&L's grade D).",5uFncIskfmLIV1FI-dNY5Q,0,0,4,jwPZYJ0XQYh5vFwEIF17TA

I was craving kalbi, so we decided to give this place a try. They have a very extensive menu and plenty of great lunch specials. You can get pretty much every plate in mini / lunch or full size. I came in knowing I wanted kalbi, but I was almost swayed by all the other great options. I eventually went with my initial craving and got the kalbi. 

The food was ready quickly and we grubbed and chatted while we ate. The atmosphere is really nice. Clean and comfortable. I wasn't too in love with the kalbi, wishing it was a little more flavorful, but overall it was still a tasty meal. Not the best I've ever had, but I'll probably be back to try some of their other lunch menu options.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,4,4,3,AQeD57alY-qMqFcSLb9Gcw
