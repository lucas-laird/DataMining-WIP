They rolls don't look presentable. One of the rolls I got is a salmon roll. To my surprise, the salmon is cooked not fresh.",FHxs54gZHR5C1DdkCbk6Mw,0,0,1,cJ9895jf34B9njZtcnsGEA

It could just be we lucked out and only had one other party there dining in but nonetheless, I would definitely recommend this place. There is an all you can eat for $25 with a 2 dish max per order. After being satisfied off 2 rolls (1 shrimp tempura roll and 1 Tiger roll) I was glad I didn't get the all you can eat :). My daughter had 2 miso soups and a Cali roll. Total was only $27.51, not too bad. I definitely recommend this place.",QiyvjCMCGhqscz26JcfEkw,0,0,4,Sj1Fr7KTWiofraUKcEZaig

She is quick, remembers what you order when you come back a couple times and very friendly.  The sushi is great and fresh.  We moved to the southwest and have tried some sushi places out here but we still make the 20 minutes drive to fuji san when we want AYCE sushi.",b7eo0foiEPU-skNE26vtqA,0,0,5,0g-ra-tgMf2_EfiFK11bTA
1660516,2010-09-28,0,Whe-J05k_0ZZbMG5LJrKSg,"This is usually one of my favorite sushi places to hit up for the AYCE special, however my frequent visit here last week didn't have me leaving there impressed as usual. 

I decided to go there for lunch with my dad, and it wasn't the best experience. The moment we were seated, the waitress was persistent. We haven't had the chance to really look at the menu and she was already asking for orders. I usually like to order two things at a time, but she was constantly asking if we wanted to order more. Seriously? the service lacked major that day. 

But aside from the service, some of the sushi rolls weren't that great. The baked rolls as usual were good, also the shrimp tempura was great as always. You could tell the sashimi on top the Rainbow roll was frozen, that semi frozen semi thawed texture didn't do good for that roll. And the rice seemed semi dry. 

This was a bummer since this is a place i like to frequent, but hopefully this was just a wack day for them!

On the plus side tho, they do have Punch Cards now!",CmPjoba7N2ZSa3goSsSN6Q,3,1,3,u1EiqPS3RWy1loLEfHeyKA

I like  the fact that its in a strange place.  I also like the fact that it's a female sushi San.

Try this place and you'll be pleasantly surprised.",o68A_3bAJTge-ioGXHdxKA,0,0,3,_XreklZFOQMDpglonhZWmA
3479959,2010-01-02,0,Whe-J05k_0ZZbMG5LJrKSg,"Last day in Vegas before I head back home and went back with my family for dinner.  I had wanted something light so ordered off the regular menu instead of doing the all you can eat thing.

I had seaweed salad, age dashi tofu (off appetizer menu) and Veggie Udon.  Despite the udon being on the lunch menu, they were kind enough to allow me to order it anyway.

It was quite good and the soup was bigger than I had thought.  The seaweed salad was good and I enjoyed it.  The tofu was cooked properly and not overcooked at all.  It came with a nice and light dipping sauce.  It was good enough that my step-mom had to order one for herself after trying a piece of mine.

The veggie udon was good and plentiful.  I personally would prefer more vegetables in the soup but there was a good amount and plenty of noodles.

One other thing I wanted to add, even though I didn't have any tonight.  My family was taking part of the all-you-can-eat sushi and I was noticing that unlike other all-you-can-eat sushi places I've tried in my life, the chef at Fuji San doesn't skimp on the fish and load up on the rice.  They were getting nice sizes of meat in their rolls.  Just wanted to add that as I noticed it while they were eating and remembering how other places tend to load up on rice to fill you up.

I have to say I need to make it a point to come back to this place the next time I make it out to vegas.",fO88aXKiKfy0E1kz_mClwg,4,0,4,YlkBY-ZFYQR5wfe3v3IjWQ

Fish was great and awesome service. On par with Oyshi and better than Kobe. This Was the first time I had a woman prepare my rolls as well and she was very good a quick.


If you like hole in the wall spots this is a good one.",g_zeVgyExnemji9VPX0dgg,0,0,4,13N4W5mYTe7dJsdaQ1SjBg

We sat at the bar and the fish was really good and the service was excellent. Wide AYCE variety with good size portions. I had a great experience here and I hope you do too when you visit thus place.",ssz4_Rj8p1CLgO2WWnIoTA,0,0,5,8VLVI0h4bHQ160txAQ56jg

They give nice portions of fish to rice. They remember what we have had before. One of our favorites is shrimp lovers. But I really haven't had much I didn't enjoy. Gyoza and tempura appetisers are good as well.
Fuji San is tucked away in a strip mall that's quiet. Don't let it fool you, the food isgood.",HEdhMjPZINpAtRE7jq1i5Q,0,0,4,jPfsenrK1AlYniVMDDQzOQ
