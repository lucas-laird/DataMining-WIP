Good service, interesting biography type thing about Jenni perfecting her pho broth for 20years or so on the menu. The pho was not bad, it was not the best I've had but I can say I have had worse especially down the street at that other place...If you are in the Las Vegas area but not near spring mt.

Couldn't even get there attention to fill up my water. I knew they were busy but come on! Takes only a second to refill the glass of water and check up on your customers.

    The only reason why I gave jenni pho another chance was because it was so close to the house and the food was pretty good. So I went back a week
later to order my salt n pepper around dinner time but the waiter ask me to order somthing else cause the chef was not there, are you kidding me? 4 guys in the kitchen making pho but you can't make salt n pepper shrimp?

I live in the Mountain's Edge area.. and it is quite a drive to Chinatown. I'm not about to drive all the way there for a bowl of pho, so when I first saw Jenni Pho open, I was excited that I could drive about 10 minutes for a bowl of Pho. The place is quite small and the parking lot is small too. The service is good, not great but nothing to complain about. The Pho is cheap and the boba is as well, which I'm happy about. Boba is about $2 - $3, whereas in Chinatown, they can go up to $5. The Pho portion is pretty big and they give you a good amount of meat. The broth is ok, nothing too ""WOW"" but decent. Pho is Pho, it's a simple soup dish that they serve on the streets in Vietnam, so what can you really expect? It's a good dish to eat on a cold day and it's my ultimate comfort food. Jenni Pho is not my favorite Pho place in Las Vegas, but since it is close to my home, cheap and decent, I go here often.

Well, I didn't make it to the grand opening, but i made it there today along with two curious coworkers.  as soon as we walked it, we noticed at how busy it was.  also, we noticed that you can peer into the kitchen whenever you want because there is no wall.  its a gigantic window.  its like going to the giant aquarium at the silverton lodge but instead of fish and and fake-topless mermaids, you see a bunch of people cooking and preparing your meals.  no shady business with your food here.  
the menu was quite simple and not as extensive as other Vietnamese restaurants, but  they had your typical pho dishes ~$7, my favorite beef stew dish, vermicelli dishes, and rice dishes, too.  the only way to eat pho is to get the #1, which consisted of thin slippery rice noodles, thin slices of rare steak, well-done flank, extra fatty briskets, gooey gelatin soft tendon, and strings of tripe in a flavorful broth that hummed of star anise.  i love how not only do you have the typical hoisin, and red chili sauce, but they also give you the crunchy and oily red pepper to add some heat and flavorful zing to my pho.   im disappointed but they didnt have the option to get a bigger pho bowl, but my tummy was warm and full after slurping up this entire soup bowl.  service still seems to be learning the ropes.  they did forget our water and utensils.   i also have to add one more thing, when i ordered for Vietnamese iced coffee on the menu, i was told that they didnt have any today, but they did have tea.  WHAT????  that's equivalent to going to the golden arches, and not able to order and cold and sugary icey coca-cola to wash my big mac down.   above all....minus the coffee and the service, this restaurant has a lot going for it, compared to the earlier mentioned pho houses on this side of town, my ass will be plopped here a lot more often after that tasty bowl of pho",Zr4N9sG31fybEa-l3a_46Q,6,5,4,h4UKCKHjoyz9jkKMnCUPSA

I asked the server if they had soy sauce since most places already have it on the table, and she said ""yes"", and just stared at me blankly.  I said ""well, can I have some please?"".  She left and eventually came back with it about 5 minutes later.

Boyfriend:  Steak Pho, which he said tasted pretty bland.

Me:  Vegetable Pho with extra veggies.  Broth was very sweet, and pretty gross.  I tried adding soy sauce, jalepenos, pepper, anything and everything to make it edible; which didn't help.  The only veggies that were in the soup were baby corn, cauliflower, broccoli, carrots, and mushrooms.  Cauliflower? Really?  No bok choy, no cabbage.. Needless to say was VERY disappointed.  Being a vegetarian and having eaten at countless pho places, I was sorry I even ordered it.

Daughter:  Kid's Meal chicken nuggets and fries.  She had no complaints, but then again, she eats my cooking.  Not very easy to mess that up.

Service:  Polite at first.  Gentleman that took our order and delivered our entrees was nice.  Orders were correct.  Then, he disappeared and we had no service whatsoever throughout our entire meal.  We were finished eating and were waiting to ask for a container and the check for over 15 minutes.  A young lady appeared and asked the table next to us (that came in after us) if they needed anything, as they were just finishing up.  They asked for a container, and the lady took her soup to box it up, and didn't even look our way.  Not sure how she missed us, because we were basically sitting right on top of them.  5 minutes later she brings them their box and check and walks away.  My boyfriend literally had to yell ""excuse me"" to get her to even acknowledge our existence.  We asked for a container and the check, which she brought relatively promptly.  AND THEN... we get to the cashier and she THEN informs us that it's ""cash only"".  I thought my boyfriend's head was going to spin around at that point.  SERIOUSLY??!  Who, in this day and age, doesn't accept cards of any kind?? While my boyfriend was at the ATM, I, at least, looked around for any signs stating that it is cash only.  ONE. One tiny, single sign stuck at the bottom of the window to the kitchen.  That's it.  So, you know, just in case the kitchen workers forget they can't use their card..  Fortunately, my boyfriend doesn't have to pay any ATM fees, due to his military debit card.  Had we had to pay a fee, though, there would have been a problem.  That is it for the rating part, but just in case you are enjoying my rant, below I will tell you about the farm animals sitting all around us...

Tables are very close together, and a couple was seated at the table next to us at a table for 4, and the server purposely put the menus on the opposite end of their table, so as to give us room.  Nope.  They move over right next to us, pretty much sitting in our laps.  As we wait for our food, chick next me starts playing videos on her phone at FULL VOLUME, so loud that we can't carry on a conversation.  Didn't help that the music was blaring in the restaurant, also.  Then, a group of 5 adults, one child, probably 4 years old, get seated behind us.  They all start hugging in the aisle like they've not seen each other in decades, and just continue to stand there talking while the kid runs all over the place.  Keep in mind, the restaurant is very small.  They finally sit down and are talking so loud and making so much noise, you would have thought they were at home in their own dining room.  All the while, they are completely ignoring the kid as she takes out ALL of the chopsticks (not wrapped, they were plastic) and plays with them, before putting them back again.  Gross.  Table next to us gets their food, and the chick next to me is slurping her soup louder than any CHILD EVER would.  It was ridiculous.  I seriously began to think that I was On a hidden camera show, or Punk'd, or something.  All around, a very painful visit from beginning to end.

If this place is busy, don't expect any service. I walked in with my sister one time and saw a couple tables clean and open. We made eye contact with 2 of the waiters, and neither of them offered us a table or even acknowledged our presence. We waited around for about 5 min as they continued to ignore and walk past us several times. Then we just left.

Really good pho here. The broth is great; my heart breaks a little every time I see someone dump hoisin and sriracha into their bowl. You're ruining the broth! Those are for dipping!

The beef stew is great, too. I haven't tried the bun bo hue here, but I will order it with confidence if I'm craving it when I visit.

As a unique item, they also have a lobster pho. It's not the crazy whole, fresh lobster in the bowl like you'll get at District One, but for that you'll pay like sixty bucks. This is a lobster tail, and it's only $15 and comes with a free iced tea. I tried it once and enjoyed it a lot.

One problem: one night at around 9 I saw one of the women going around to the tables, topping off the condiment bottles. Not good! How old is some of the sauce in those bottles?? As old as the restaurant?! This isn't just icky, it's a health code violation.

Jenni is chinese and is fun hearing them transition between chinese and vietnamese.  That being said, typical asian restaurants have poor service.  It's been hit and miss each time I've been - to the extreme where I've had to ask for water 6 times!  Other times they didn't miss a beat.

I'm not the best to judge for pho.  We like what we like.  Especially when we start adding in other crap like hoisin, siracha and mint leaves.  Their base is good.  Can't compare to Saigon 8 or Pho So 1 but we like what we like.

I do feel bad for their staff as they don't accept credit cards.  They ""conveniently"" have an ATM next to the register.

From there, we got ready to pay and was told they only accept cash!! What it's 2015, get with the times. They conveniently had an ATM in there that charges a fee. I am sure the owners probably own that ATM and are double dipping from customers. Not only are they avoiding credit card fees for having a credit card machine, they are probably making money off of you getting money out of their machine. This is so not the way to treat customers that are giving your business money when there are so many more pho places in Las Vegas.

Jenni Pho is the nicest and cleanest Pho restaurant I've ever been to.  From appearance, the owners have done a great job of separating themselves from your prototypical Pho restaurants.  The service here is pretty standard though.  Broken english, unfriendly, etc.  It's tough to describe, but there is a certain air here that I haven't experienced at any other restaurant.  Almost as if the hostess and waiters didn't care about their patrons.  This is very surprising considering they had a more staff then customers (with most of the staff just standing and joking around between themselves).

As for the food? Meh.

We ordered egg rolls as appetizers and Pho as our entrees.  The egg rolls themselves were small, light in filling, with a thick friend wonton wrapper.  It tasted like fried dough.  We didn't even finish all of them and that never happens.

The Pho itself was decent.  I ordered a custom bowl with flank, brisket, and beef.  The broth was a little oily for my taste and the size of the bowl and quantity of the noodles was small.  Mind you, they only serve one size here.  For 8.50 a bowl, I expected more from the Pho.  I guess they charge a premium given the decor... which I must say was their saving grace in my rating.",qrOXWSK-bpf24dLWnTx29Q,4,1,2,1sOuAPgSy9e56TrBaIRBpQ

However, I did try the pho a few years ago, and I don't recall having any problems with it and friend who ordered it seemed to be satisfied.

Surroundings - nearby many other restaurant options offering a good variety of different cuisines to choose from, no issue with parking

Atmosphere - casual, normal pho restaurant, ""open"" kitchen where there's glass around so you can see them cook your food

Menu - offers the normal appetizers including egg rolls and spring rolls, regular pho options (I believe you can choose up to 5 items to put in your pho and customize as well), vermicelli, a few specialty dishes, boba, and dessert. I took a glance at the dessert menu and I believe it had mini cheesecakes and truffles which was interesting. My order, the chicken vermicelli, tasted great, decent portion size, and came in a pretty bowl. However, despite the time it took to get my food, my chicken came out a little undercooked. Other than that, no complaints. It satisfied my taste buds and grumbling tummy :)

Service - slow, but kind. There was only one other table besides ours and there seemed to be ample employees (serving and cooking); however, our food took longer than it should have. It's probably the longest I've ever had to wait for food at a vietnamese restaurant. Perhaps it was because we came near closing... not sure exactly what the issue was there.

However, I took my leftovers to go and ate it two days later, and it tasted WAY better than when I was eating there.  I think because the sauce had time to actually soak into the noodles so it had more flavor.  The thai iced tea boba was pretty good and there was a buy 2 get one free deal.

Funny thing, she chose the WRONG Jenni Pho.  There are two:  one at Rainbow and a new one at Spring Mountain.  Since we were at the Wynn, it would have been convenient to just swing by the new location; instead, we hiked out to Rainbow.  And, what a hike it is.

Jenni Pho is located in a compact complex.  Parking is atrocious! And, people in Vegas fail to drive within the rules.  One way means one way and not two way.  Once you see the lot, you will understand.

Restaurant is not that bad.  It is a bit tight walking in and there is very little room.  It seemed like they try to squeeze as many tables together as they can.  Also, to save on electricity, they left the front door open.  So, people sitting next to the front door had to suffer a noticeable cold breeze.  Note:  Since this is during the winter months, this is not good. 

My wife and I both tried the Pho Dac Biet.  We have tasted better.  It lacked a lot of flavor.  It was kinda water down.  However, I think it was a new brew and it actually needed to ""sit"" (like 24 hours) for awhile before being served.  Also, the water was not hot or warm.  I think the noodles were cold and they put the brew on top.  The noodles cooled down the water and it made the meal less appealing.  

Service was decent here.  Unlike many Viet establishments, service was very attentive and they were very nice.  

Overall, I thought the service was good, price was ""higher"" compared to other vietnamese restaurant (not too much, but enough to notice), and food was below average on this occasion.

We still plan to give this another try.  Next time, we probably try the Spring Mountain location.

In the end it's still like any other pho restaurant.
The difference is that Jenni Pho actually doesn't give cilantro in their pho unless you ask for it. It's actually good that they don't considering the amount of people who don't like cilantro. I had to ask for some on the side. 

You know that saying that the dirtiest pho tastes the best? When you know their thumb has been dipped in the soup it gives it it's full flavor? Well of course it's just a joke, but point being, Jenni Pho's pho actually tastes really clean compared to Pho Kim Long and Pho So 1. So, I guess the dirtiest pho isn't the best, but in the end it's up to you to decide. If you do want cleaner tasting pho, or fresher tasting, definitely try this place out. Other than that, it's a pretty standard Vietnamese pho restaurant.

Jenni Pho at it's price point is one of the cleanest and nicest looking Pho restaurants I've ever been in (Bamboo Bistro is nice too). The service is uneven, but they are courteous, and it doesn't have that cafeteria feel. I've been in nicer Pho spots, but they are far more expensive. That made me want to give it five stars alone.

The Pho was delicious. The broth wasn't greasy, and the meat was bright red. So it wasn't sitting around or allowed to cook to hide its freshness or lack of. But after all is said and done... it's just consistently good Pho ... nothing special... not five stars.... 4 1/2

Food: 
Generally if your at a pho restaurant, people tend to order pho, duh. So of course my husband and I ordered pho. Compared to Kim Long where everyone seems to go after a crazy night of clubbing on the strip etc. (must be a reason why). This place lack a bit in its flavor. They lack the genuine beef bones stock flavor in the soup and add too much clove that over powered the soup. This is not the garlic clove I'm talking about but a flower bud herb that is in many Asian cooking. (minus 1-star)


Service:
I wasn't too hungry yet and decided to order the kids size which they were nice enough to let me order. The kids pho came with a soda and when I asked for it when my food came, then he tells me ""oh its for kids only"". In my opinion, I am paying for it so why does it matter? Why didn't he tell me before I ordered? If that's they case, I may have just ordered the regular size which the price wasn't much of a difference now that I didn't get my soda. How much would the soda be for them to serve it anyway. 
I do have to admit, their service is great. But that whole soda situation was unnecessary to upset your customer and risk losing them. I just didn't like the fact there was no communication that if I ordered it, that I would not get my soda because I wasn't a kid?? If you allowed a customer to order it, then honor it.

Some of our group were fiending for pho and this location was in extremely efficient proximity, so we ventured forth. Once seated, we got our rounds of icy cold water and debated over our orders. I opted for their beef special, which included various bits of beefy goodness including tendon, brisket and tripe. I ordered their blood cubes as an addition, which were surprisingly large once they arrived. I also ordered the green papaya salad for the table, which was alright. The salad included beef jerky, which was an interesting touch, though the dressing wasn't particularly noteworthy and a bit overly sweet for my tastes. The pho broth was alright, perhaps not as deep or nuanced as other places I've tried, and they brought ONE small plate of herbs for a table of five (and THREE of us had ordered pho). As soon as we finished and began filtering out, an older woman who worked there sat at our table and stared us down, making me rather uncomfortable.

I just should have stuck with the Pho action. I ordered the grilled pork chop and shrimp also comes with egg custard (name not sure) of sorts. First impression was WOW talk about lot of rice too everything else on the plate. Trust me huge fan of rice grew up on it. If I wanted all rice would have asked for side of rice. The pork chop was good. It was moist, nice grill marks, and nice flavor. The shrimp was solid too. The egg custard was ok nothing special. Here my problem is felt like with all that rice, not enough meat (the pork chop is thin cut and shrimp not u10), and the disproportion not working for me. My favorite spot for broken rice Pho Bosa they give you ample rice too but  everything else you get more of the good stuff!

The prices are very reasonable at Jenni Pho. Most dishes notice was under ten dollars. They have two for one special on there boba drinks. If one that need pic rather then description Jenni Pho has pictures of all the items on the menu. If short on cash have ATM right next too the front door.

I had mango ice tea with boba. Honestly  think that was the one thing that stood out for me more then the food. It was refreshing drink. No caffeine, really no sugar, and add the boba. Awesome. 

Still need too try the Pho but if looking for good broken rice dish no one can beat Pho Bosa in my opinion. I love Pho will be back too give that go.",iSC96O2NjQc3JExGUHQG0Q,2,2,3,6Z2tEugsOeywntFvERBOkw

Upon walking in, the staff at the counter greeted us and seated us immediately. You can tell this place is a homey place because of the way the employees interact with their customers. I was indecisive between the pho dac biet (basically the pho special with everything in it) or the bun bo hue (a special blend of spices to create an extremely savory soup) and decided to try their bun bo hue. 

What I liked about it was the flavor of the soup- nice, rich and flavorful. It kind of reminds me of a bit of lemongrass with pork broth and a few other spices that I can't quite put my finger on. The bowl was large with a lot of noodles, a pork hock, Vietnamese meat loaf slices, slices of meat and slices of coagulated pork blood. I know, I know, it sounds gross but honestly, don't knock it till you try it. It tastes good especially with all the fresh crunchy veggies added to the soup to add a different level of texture. What I wish was a bit better was the depth of flavor- I feel like the soup was delicious but it could have been kicked up a notch a bit more. 

My honey got the honey chicken with broken rice and it was yummy as well. It was char grilled chicken with fresh green onions on top of it and a heaping pile of broken rice with slices of fresh crisp cucumbers, tomato and carrots.

After a long day of moving we decided to start trying some of the places in our new neighborhood that we've never tried before. I had a combo platter that consisted of a moist and tender grilled pork chop. That pork chop was so freakin tender that I was able to take the first few bites by cutting off pieces with the side of my fork! Also included was 3 large shrimp a fried egg, and a sizable portion of rice!

I haven't tried the pho yet but my friends weren't overly impressed. They both ordered the Jenni Special. They noted that it was okay but that they have had much better at other places in town(including several places in Chinatown and the Lemongrass Cafe on Eastern Ave.). I am quite sure I will be back to try it myself and at that time I'll be able to update this review regarding their pho. 

The service was quick and friendly, but then again the place was pretty dead when we went in there yesterday afternoon. 

I guess the biggest complaint I had about my experience yesterday was that we were ambushed by a couple of very aggressive gnats/flies. Very freaking annoying when you're trying to eat!

Be aware that they only accept cash. They also have an ATM inside for your money gouging convenience.

I did like this place enough to the point that I will return and try more things. It does have the potential to bump up to 4 stars and it's so close to the house that it would be great to make this a regular spot.

Sure, it may be more on the oily side but that's ok, I always ask for an extra bowl and carefully spoon out the liquid layers of fat.

The service is quite good; ample amount of waiters and waitresses hanging around ready to help you with whatever. 

My only gripe about this place is that they don't accept cards! Debit or credit, doesn't matter. I think everyone will agree that in this day and age that's pretty unacceptable. They have an ATM but still, it takes an X amount of money for the transaction. I actually told them I'll stop by a BoA and come back. Luckily there's one not too far away.

When our spring rolls came, they were pretty standard like you would get at any other Vietnamese place. The sauce was a little bit different than most  other places though. The sauce had a peanut taste to it, but also this Chinese pasty/bread aftertaste to it, which I particularly liked. It might be weird that I like that pastry aftertaste, or even that I could even tell that it was there. That could just be me being weird, but the sauce was good!

The Bad: The service is abrupt and aloof. I went to pick up take out and the guy behind the takeout counter was surfing the internet, apparently I was SEP and rather than say something polite like ""the cashier will be here shortly"" he just chose to make it mega-awkward and surf (what I assume was some highly captivating pornography) defiantly.

When you get Pho in the restuarant you feel like you're getting a ton of meat. When you get it via take out and get to see it in it's deconstructed form, you're getting about a dollars worth of lunch meat. Not good. I strongly suspect you get far more meat for dining in.

Horrifying: The meatballs, like a lot of Pho places, are just bad. Also they are almost perfectly evocative of reproductive organs. I believed this was my palate until I had good traditional Pho balls at other Pho restaurants. The same is true, even more so, for the tripe. It's about as chewy as it can get here. I am not accounting this into the score though, because I think this may be cultural.

The soup here is kind of bland but there is actually enough taste to make you come back on a rainy day.  It's actually a plus if you're looking for low sodium I guess.

We came here last night 30 minutes before they closed.  I wasn't expecting so much because of all the awful reviews with slow service and the food is bland.  Especially really bad reviews of people coming close to closing too.  

There were two lady servers, they were working, cleaning for the closing.  There were about 7-8 seated tables when we came in.  Two more came in a little after us.  They didn't rush us on ordering and it was easy and quick to flag them down to order.  They came the Asian server came by to refill our water 3 times.  That's a new thing at Asian restaurants for us.  In California, good luck with that one.  LOL, you would ask 2-3 times before you would get it and they give you the dirty look.

We both ordered Pho Dac Biet, $8.95.  The broth is quite nice, flavorful.  You can taste the rich beef, beef bones that's in the broth.  It's no comparison to Pho in California, but it's one of the best in Las Vegas in my opinion.

Overall, we enjoyed the pho and the service was good, not as bad as people claim it to be.  You must keep in mind about service, Asian restaurants aren't like American restaurants.  Elderly Asian family don't tip like this generation does.  The servers don't know or think that they're supposed to hustle to make the extra tip like in the American restaurants or the higher end Asian restaurants.  Mom and pop Asian restaurant are usually the same in service given.  You can always tip them in the beginning and I'm sure they will serve you the way you want them too.  [  Just a thought. =D  ]

We went for Sunday brunch and the restaurant had a nice flow going. We were promptly seated and the server took our order of 3 Phos and an order of egg rolls. I kid you not it took over 35 minute to get our Pho! WHAT THE PHO!!!!!? And then we asked our waiter about the egg rolls and he told us it would be a couple more minutes. When we were finished with our Pho guess what finally showed up??? We told them we didn't want it anymore so they apologized and took it back! 
Then we decided to utilize the boba special they had (buy 2 get 1 free) and so we placed our order with the server.. 5 minutes later he comes back asking what we ordered again because he forgot...!! -___-

4957474,2016-09-27,0,iPM8BXV6vEVEci8ttsOObQ,"So Annoyed with this place. I waited a few days to gather my thoughts before I left a review, because I didn't want my frustrations dictate my views. This is the second time I have placed an order (in person) and the second time it was given to me incorrectly. The first time I ordered 3 meals and a few side orders, I didn't bother checking the bag since it seemed so heavy. It was a $40 dollar order mind you-_-. When I arrived at the house, I noticed the third meal was not there and I called. The receipts they give you doesn't have the items ordered, they only have the total amount. Which is even more frustrating because the burden is on me to prove what I ordered matches the price. The lady on the phone basically challenged everything I said and so I just let it go. I didn't have time to argue with her. Fast forward 7 months and figured I give it a try again. I ordered Honey chicken (4 meals total), egg rolls, Taro smoothy and even pointed with my beautiful finger right over the name. The girl taking my order even repeated it back to me and so I paid an almost $70 price tag. I waited for about 20 min and the girl didn't seem too excited to be there, mostly checking her phone and looking around before deciding to make the smoothy. When I get the order I make sure to check everything and what do I see??? A sunny side up egg plopped on top of porkchop and rice. So I begin to question the guy who brought the food and when the girl (who took my order) noticed me questioning things, she came right over and crouched down to eye level while I sat dumbfounded on the chair. She looked right at me and stated..."" You ordered C6 which is a porkchop, don't you remember what you order""? It took Every ounce of effort to not lose it. Am I not the customer here? Since my debit card had already been charged and I didn't want to end up on the news, so I simply decided to be the bigger person and just leave. With the food of course.

4974831,2009-03-13,0,iPM8BXV6vEVEci8ttsOObQ,"Vietnamese food remains a novelty in the southwest area of Las Vegas.  With the recent opening of Jenni Pho, it satisfies your basic pho desires.

Jenni Pho is a clean restaurant with an open kitchen viewable through the glass window, something you don't see often in Vietnamese establishments.

Their menu is quite limited (versus others), focusing on a handful of pho bowls, broken rice dishes, stir fried noodles, and cold noodle bowls.  They also offer boba and slushed ice drinks.  And yes, it's a bit more expensive than Spring Mountain restaurants.

I've been here a few times, sticking to the pho dishes.  Most recently I ordered the ""Create Your Own Bowl"" for $6.95.  You can choose  up to five items among 8 for your own combo.  I went for the fatty flank, steak, meat balls, crunchy flank, and tripe.  (The other three are brisket, tendon, and flank.)  They only have one size available, which is a cross between the small and large in other restaurants. 

The Husband ordered the Bo Kho (Beef Stew Noodle Soup) for $7.50.  He asked for egg noodles, which costs a dollar more.  When we actually got the bowl, regular rice noodles were there.  We told the waitress and she offered to take it back and change out the noodles but we were hungry and didn't want to wait.  We just wanted to be sure we weren't charged for the noodle change that didn't happen.

They do offer a decent amount of noodles and meat in their version.  

Overall, Jenni Pho has had a steady stream of customers when we visit.  And we notice non-Vietnamese frequenting as well, which I account for their picture menu making lives a bit easier.  It's a bit more relaxed here though, like a leisurely meal taking place.  It works when you're craving basic Vietnamese food in the area.

First off bring cash they do not expect plastic! They do have an atm machine in the restaurant, but who knows the fees that it might hold!!!! 

Jenni Pho is a small cafe. The service was excellent and the Pho was so yummy. Even better then I expected it to be. 
I ordered an appetizer of their Shrimp Rolls which were perfectly cooked. The crispy wonton wrapper was fried just right. It didn't fall all over you on the first bite! For my entree, I ordered the Seafood Pho. It had tons of fish, calamari, and shrimp and the broth was very tasty. I loved all the bean sprouts and other things you get to mix into it.
My friend and her husband ordered two appetizers. She got the egg rolls and he got the spring rolls. They let me try the egg roll and OMG I would go back just for that egg roll. The chicken in it was packed in perfectly, not dry, and again did not fall apart on the first bite. For their Pho, she got the Steak and Flank and he got the Seafood Pho like me.

For my first experience with Pho I really enjoyed it. Jenni Pho makes some tasty broth and I loved the amount of seafood they give you as well. I can't wait to take my husband in for the Pho and the egg rolls! Mmmm I wish I could go back right now! lol",pUQdU4MlkB46jIdYs9oMUA,1,1,4,86v7IGuOqDnjY9KcopWgzA

5091790,2010-02-25,0,iPM8BXV6vEVEci8ttsOObQ,"I have been going to Jenni Pho for at least a year now and find them them really consistent as far as prompt and efficient service, delicious food, and clean/ attractive ambience. There's another Vietnamese joint down the street from them and I feel bad for them because Jenni Pho hits them out of the ballpark as far as flavor and just, well, being so much more NICE inside!

I can highly recommend the beef balls (in the Pho), delicious strips of tendon, tender brisket, and I personally find the broth tasty, with hints of the requisite clove and spices, and not at all ""too salty"" as can be the case with other Pho places who try to extend their soup's taste with salt. I especially love their broken rice dish with spring roll, ""skewer"" pork (meltingly tender marinaded sweet pork) and grilled shrimp. I wish there was a little more shrimp and pork, but it works. It comes with their nuoc cham and some cucumber/ tomato to cleanse the palate.

The fried spring rolls are always hot and savory, with fresh and crisp lettuce and nuoc cham on the side. Any rice dish I've had always wins, though if you like pork, stick to the ""skewer"" pork, not the pork chop- I found the pork chop a bit tough and definitely not as flavorful as the other kind.

Boba in the boba drinks are comparable to any boba joint in Chinatown (staying soft and chewy) and for under $2, their milk-tea boba is a popular and ubiquitious choice.  They are very willing to ""go easy on the ice"" if you tell them to- making the drink that much more ""bang for your buck"" and tasty!

My only gripe is that they only take cash, and while they offer an ATM machine in the corner to address card-only customers (like myself), it still charges you X amount to use it. I'd say, come prepared with your paper stack if you intend to eat here!

Other than that, I love coming to this place and it never disappoints. Even their lunchtime service, full of customers, is reasonably fast. Definitely a neighbourhood favorite and a place I'll keep returning to.",lFcmHJTpCXLY_RtMQHS1BQ,0,0,4,9x8NJnFIH1EtFk4Gao2gYw
5100361,2011-07-24,1,iPM8BXV6vEVEci8ttsOObQ,"I've heard from friends that Jenni Pho has the best Thai Tea in town. And since its right down the street from my house, its 1000x more convenient than driving all the way to Pho So 1 on Spring Mountain ( my usual pho spot ). 

The restaurant is fairly small but well-decorated and well-lit with natural light. Generally speaking, asian food joints aren't the nicest places to eat. But I was pleasantly surprised to see that Jenni Pho is actually a really nice sit down restaurant. 

In addition to pho, the menu features a variety of delicious appetizers and entrees for those who aren't pho people. My favorite bowl of pho is Pho Dac Biet which is their ""Jenni Pho"" so I went with that and an order of fresh spring rolls. The spring rolls were absolutely delicious: soft noodles, crisp vegetables, fresh shrimp. Definitely one of the better spring rolls I've had. But the peanut sauce was a little bit thick for my liking. So I added some soy sauce and sriracha to it to tone down the strong peanut flavor and thin the consistency a bit. 

The server's timing was very good as well. I was halfway done with my spring rolls and he brought the pho to the table. I was immediately disappointed to see that all of the ""rare beef"" was fully if not over cooked. Next time I'll be ordering the beef on the side; I prefer my beef more rare than well-done. Pho Dac Biet doesn't usually come with meatballs. And nothing against Jenni Pho but I've just never been a big fan of Asian meatballs so I removed those from my bowl. Despite my issues with the meats, I still enjoyed this bowl of pho. The broth was very flavorful and it satisfied my craving. 

Before I left, I got a Boba Thai Tea to go. WHICH WAS AWESOME AND CHEAP.

I can see Jenni Pho becoming one of my usual spots to eat. Overall, the pho was just OK. But I did enjoy my meal. And its so close to my home that I just can't pass it up.",AL4hosjTZzsLt99egmBszA,1,1,3,-IR_5PNBHyAXoROCTOdRiQ

With this pho, adding anything to it, only makes the taste worse. So try not to go crazy with the sauces thinking it'll get better. I am impressed however with their salt and pepper shrimp!

I'm a very picky person when it comes to pho, but this place surprised me. I ordered the original jennipho with extra tendon and an order of pot stickers. First of all the pot stickers were AMAZING! The pho was great , the beef was very juicy compared to others. Also the noodles and tendon were so soft. On top of the good food, the customer service was extraordinary! 

My only critique is that the soup was sadly bland.

5392377,2014-02-22,0,iPM8BXV6vEVEci8ttsOObQ,"The absolute most terrible restaurant I've ever dined at.

Walked in, most tables were occupied, sat down, waited for about 15 minutes until someone asked what I wanted to drink, waited another 15 mins for someone to come back with my drinks (water) & to take my order.

We ordered pot stickers, spring rolls, pho & a vermicelli dish. One taro slush & one avocado slush.

30 mins went by.. No food.

I don't know how I sat there for 30 mins without even saying a word. My boyfriend hates it when I complain about bad customer service at a restaurant because he thinks they'll really spit in our food.

45 mins came around & the pot stickers, spring rolls & vermicelli dish came out at the same time.

Boyfriends #1 pet peeve is when the appetizers & main entrees come out at the same time.

But anyway, we ate.  15 mins go by.. Still no pho for me.

At this point, I notice all the tables around us that came after us were pretty much almost done with their food.

I got up & walked over to the kitchen.

Long story short, I left unhappy & they seemed to not care at all. The food was horrible. The slushy drinks tasted like mold.. The Avocado one to be exact.

I once was eating at a Hawaiian BBQ by my house & overheard someone at the table next to me say that he worked at Jenni Pho. Which is how I heard of the place. I also overheard him saying that sometimes he has to call the owner & remind her to pay him his paycheck. I should've taken that as a RED FLAG.

5567519,2011-01-02,1,iPM8BXV6vEVEci8ttsOObQ,"Lately, the weather in Las Vegas has been so chilly :-/  If the weather gets really cold, I'm always craving for some good Pho. Well, I couldn't stop thinking about it all day at work so I had to grab a bowl of Pho the other day @Jenni Pho. I am the least picky eater out there, in all honesty, although I can't have something too salty particularly. The only thing I won't eat now is black licorice, haha.  Anyways, what's the secret recipe for good Pho?? The broth( the beef bone) or the sack of magical herbs in the broth? I once read, in a Vietnamese food cook book that mentioned the beef bone and its relations to the period and temperature that it is cook. I guess, It takes good amount of time to make a good Pho :) I am pretty sure that only Vietnamese mom of generations can cook the best Pho. 
I usually get  'Pho Tai Nam (steak& Flank)-$6.25'. They always give enough beef and a good temperature of the broth. Their broth has a nice, deep flavor and tastes very clean in spite of its cloudy appearance. I usually put a lot of bean sprouts(always very fresh), Thai basil leaves, little bit of jalapeno pepper slices, & a lime wedge. Just having a simple Pho, I like being able to customize it to my tastes; It is a fun moment of all! :P And I always kindly ask a server to bring me a small side dish of sliced onions...As soon as she puts the sliced onion on my table, I like to lightly sprinkle the red hot chilly paste on top of the onions. This is my way to enjoy my Pho ( I can't have a bowl of Pho with kimchi, right? :P). I was very happy that my Pho is accompanied by a plate heaped high with instant onion pickle that I created :) 
At the end, I always kill the soup..,leaving the bowl empty.. 

Overall, Jenni Pho is a clean, has a good size of  parking lot (no hassle), & a good Vietnamese restaurant that is a great addition to the southwest area. Perhaps my complaints will be the slow service that often you get, as the restaurant can be relatively busy at night with a lot of customers.",h0wxG2EiDLhgKjIzI8j2Mg,2,1,4,KqMufeAA1weWQZrRtJ98SQ

Just today, I stopped by and after I finished eating I was just sitting there playing on my iPhone and she cleared everything off my tables including my drinks. Kind of like ""Go play on your phone somewhere else, white boy!"" Haha! I thought it was funny though.

We each order our own pho bowls and boba drinks.  The boba was not that great, tasted watered-down and nothing special.  Save your $3 and make the trip to Chinatown area for the good stuff.

As for the pho, I thought it was good...the broth was tasty, the noodles were just right, and the portion of meats was satisfying.  I had the ""Jenni Pho"" house combo, so it was a mix of stuff.
