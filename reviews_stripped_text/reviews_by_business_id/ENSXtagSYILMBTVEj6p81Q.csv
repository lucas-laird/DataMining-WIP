944717,2016-06-04,0,ENSXtagSYILMBTVEj6p81Q,All of my food was old and obviously microwaved. The cheese in my jalape√±o poppers were rubbery. My tacos were still cold. I don't really expect much from a fast food place but it could have been better!,aWrxKGGrsmrJcdtinW4akw,0,0,1,qBcbZ0efcnFdoIJjOcZBLw
2066855,2017-07-30,0,ENSXtagSYILMBTVEj6p81Q,Terrible service and food. Plus they tried to rip us off and not return the receipt or change. Food cold and sandwiches were smashed and dry. Druggies wandering in and out of the dumpster area. Creepville,L2h_pu4SNf1wW-wT7xmyew,0,0,1,NLhTgBqf0rsdKzafzemcnw
2537034,2016-02-20,0,ENSXtagSYILMBTVEj6p81Q,The first few times I went to this location I didn't receive some of the food that was on my order but didn't realism it until I got home . From then on I check my food from this location before I leave and they always forget something. Just went today and ordered 10 mini churros and they gave me half even though the screen said it was a full order. Maybe they just need to train the staff better,GUITcxfzYuJ62g0tMNKxcA,1,0,1,dO7pGsedrMVTAYjy8JGeMA

Quality of food is always good. Service is good 98% of the time.

The only reason I don't give 4 stars is the continuous, homeless issue that drags down the area.",BkidByf5jyDAy1oN2U4qyA,1,0,3,migzvfCCyyi5o4zcp4OFkw

I honestly wanted some in&out, but for some reason it was closed. So I got me jack in the box instead and I really like
Jack in the box. I should have just got home hungry.
I always get a jumbo jack, but this jumbo jack was like no other. The burger was soggy and I could not finish it. I had to throw it away. Not even my tacos felt like they were cooked right. I was over it once I pulled out the burger out of the bag, as soon as I felt like it was squished and soggy.",G19JJVKk-R2HHjKp9AkoVQ,1,0,1,Txmi3SUMwLgQbk9Q-hVg6Q

I just tried their new waffle breakfast sandwich and it was very yummy.

Their food is always made fresh to order, ALWAYS hot.  I've never had a problem at this location or anywhere else.",9GyTNxzAN8UxpPPSTfei-A,0,0,4,iOyCpJCILBV4gRtS1TRAwA

Spent 5 minutes at the box trying to order, surprisingly they actually got the order right after numerous (and I mean numerous) corrections because they a no comprende. I refuse to speak Spanish in this Country. Thank God for those monitors outside to make sure they get it right. Other then that the order was correct, hot & tasty. I like the Ultimate Breakfast sandwiches and had the hankerin for one.",e8Y8NIX1fTmM9kAan859Kw,0,0,2,mSZBIhF1V5sesRJnlPJu2g
