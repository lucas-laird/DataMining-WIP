The restaurant inside has amazing food.  Just perfect for my random kabob cravings.  The KGB is to die for!!! Two juicy koobideh kabobs on a big flat bread with onions, grilled tomato, and a ton of fresh basil($9.99 ).  I noticed when I dined in the food was on the slower side of coming out.  I prefer ordering ahead and picking up.  Mmm can't wait to be back!",-wVPuTiIEG85LwTK46Prpw,0,0,5,V2zdPn3b1WMCjy7Qcm-n1w

We ordered hummus (of course), a falafel sandwich, and the chicken soltani (combo of chicken and koobideh kabobs). The hummus came with sesame flat bread which was nice and flaky and served fresh out of the oven. The falafel was tasty and the kabobs were well marinated and served on a bed of basmati rice. We wanted to try dessert but were too full this time around. Delicious food combined with reasonable prices and efficient service with a smile makes Zaytoon a winner in our book. We will be back to this neighborhood gem.",LkWNo83Lg92C5V4JEyxOZA,1,1,4,h_RthIVcnQ-hlSjSCjUrmQ

When you walk in you feel the warm inviting atmosphere and the feeling of feeling welcome to a family. Their fresh juices made to order are delicious. The lady is who served us was very accommodating, friendly, and makes sure that we receive the food HOT. I can't stand it when we eat out and the food is room temp or almost cold. We have been here several times now and the food is always fresh and the service is friendly. They don't make you feel rushed. Their fragrant hot tea is wonderful and I feel I can linger without feeling rushed out. I also like their market that's connected, they have such a wide variety of things that come from many countries, their selection is extensive. I even like their fresh herbs, cheese, and variety of fruits. Love this place!",zS_F5QLdBbkMwSw3eJeqag,0,0,5,EvrwrEwUXz_9Gaolt23IjQ

Gotta sprinkle the roasted lemon flakes on the white rice with saffron, winner! Place is really small, with like 7 tables and is located inside a Middle eastern market which was rather interesting in a good way.

197214,2011-01-02,0,saQQmDQQJ14BVkm_sg53UA,"In the words of LMFAO, all I can say is ""you're my new obsession"". My sister and I stumbled upon Zaytoon during our summer trip to Vegas. We had been driving around aimlessly looking for something to eat and then BAM, came across this place. Actually, I don't remember how we found it. I just remember we wanted to get our grub on. We went in and perused the market area. I was hoping to find some cool knick-knacks or other rarities since I hardly ever go to Middle Eastern markets. I didn't find anything that I really wanted to get but my sister got a few food items. They carry some flip flops and some evil eye looking jewelry but I'm pretty particular about what brand of flip flops I wear and definitely am not into evil eye jewelry. 

I decided to go to the restaurant next door, which isn't really next door since it's only partitioned by a screen or something. I ordered two beef sandwiches a.k.a. Koobideh Kabobs wrapped in lavash bread, which cost $7.99 each. You have the option of choosing a Shirazi Salad or french fries so I got the salad for myself and the fries for my stepdad. My sister decided not to get something from here but went to Long John Silvers instead and she regrets that choice to this day. Hahahah. 

Anyway, the food was sooo good that when I came back to Vegas last week I found myself craving it and wanting it. We finally came to Zaytoon on our last day here to have a proper lunch before setting out for L.A. It was just as good as I remembered and the Masto Khiar (cucumber and yogurt) was so creamy and thick. A lot of the other ones I've had before were just plain runny and blah. I ordered the same thing again since I wanted to take half my sandwich for the road and it's a lot easier to eat a sandwich in the car than a box of basmati rice! It's a shame I didn't get a dessert but I got a yummy mint flavored yogurt soda. I couldn't really taste the mint and the uncarbonated version definitely tastes much more minty, but it's all good. My sisters also really enjoyed what they ordered. One of them ordered the same thing I got but with avocado slices and the other one got the Chicken Kabob plate. 

The service was also great. There was just one person working at the time we got here. He was youngish and very attentive. He was also very cordial and polite. He showed me how to mix the yogurt soda and how to open it since there's a trick to opening it. If you don't open it properly, which equates to opening it very slowly then you may end up with it all over your shirt.

Zaytoon is one place that I look forward to going back to the next time I'm in Vegas. Perhaps, I'll go back multiple times if time and my funds permit just to try other stuff. It's affordable, convenient, and the food is just plain good. Now if only I could find a place reminiscent of it back home.",e7YqL66GjjTnKH3r0Na9IA,3,2,4,LMdJRChxGTRr5XHmMuF_Eg

332795,2014-06-11,0,saQQmDQQJ14BVkm_sg53UA,"The bottom line: We are definitely fans of Iranian food and Zaytoon did not disappoint us.

The Pros: The service was very friendly and our server was quite knowledgeable. I once got a tip to always try the daily stew in an Iranian restaurant and Zaytoon's pomegranate stew was no disappointment. The price was reasonable. The variety was very good. We loved the fact that they had ""sumak"" as a condiment on the tables and that the other diners were quite obviously Middle-Eastern. The market that is adjacent to the restaurant has a large variety of Middle-Eastern products that we have been looking for for quite a while.

The Cons: The location is not necessarily the first you would think of if you are a tourist in Las Vegas. The setup is very ""family style"" which we really like, but others may not find ""professional"" enough.",e2LoPn48_y83IEd4YhxeKA,0,1,5,eivdHwuc1n4NsLeGLhZm6g

708669,2016-03-01,0,saQQmDQQJ14BVkm_sg53UA,"I stumbled across this place in a search for Douwe Egberts coffee, which is hands down the best coffee on Earth.  It showed up on their menu and rather than just popping into a Mediterranean place for a cup of coffee on a hot Spring day, which would be a bit weird, my wife and I went for dinner.

It's not an overly large place by any means, but there was no wait to sit and service was prompt.  Feeling adventurous, my wife ordered the Yogurt Soda.  The gentleman helping us was nice enough to double check if we knew what it was because too many people come in to try new things and end up paying for a soda they don't drink.  We ended up enjoying the soda, even if it tasted like salty liquid yogurt dip.

Foodwise, we started with the cucumber and yogurt dip.  The bread comes out perfectly crispy and its flavor complements the dip.  For the main courses, I settled on the KGB and my wife got the Fesenjaan.  The waiter was nice enough to let me know how to properly eat my meal - it's a bit daunting if you have no idea how to go about it!  

Both entrees were delicious.

After dinner, we moved on to the main reason we had found Zaytoon - the coffee.  We paired it with the pistachio/rose/saffron ice cream.  The ice cream was good, but not mind-blowing.  The coffee was as smooth as expected.

The service was wonderful.  They make you feel at home.  Everyone was very engaging and friendly.

After our meal, we got up and walked around the attached market, which contained enough unique wares that we spent more money in there.  Overall, it was a great dining experience.

After trying it out one night, I can't say for a fact that this is true. In fact, I would have to argue that it would not be on my list for best spots for Mediterranean food in Vegas. I thought all the food was about A-OK here.

So some peeps, (and I won't mention who because you know who you are, I hope that you do) told me that Zaytoon was the place to go for some of the best Mediterranean food in town. I was really excited to come here. I thought that this place would change the whole game. You know, a game-changer. Well, the opportunity presented itself to me, in a way that you could understand, but I would still like to keep that a secret, unless you know what it is, then it's fine. But, I don't think you do, or do you? That is in and of itself, the mystery. You could even say its a mysterization of magnanimous malfunctions. Or else.

Well, so came the day when the anticipation would end. Came here on a Dark Knight. It wasn't cloudy as of yet, but I needed my blinkers on in order to see the world from the outside. Zaytoon is a small place, a little cafe connected to a market. Few tables, here and there, bada bing, bada boom, sitting down. Menu? Simple, little confusing with the combos and the non's. Ordered the Kabob of Chicken combo. Waited.

Little complimentary cracker came out. Dusted with seeds. Put it on with the butter. It was OK. Kinda a cross between. Time was ticking. Into the future. Fly like a eagle to the sea. Fly like a eagle, let my spirit carry me. Oh, forgot about the review. Back to it. 

Chicken Kabob combo - White and yellow rice. Needed to put a hellalotta salt on it. Shaking it like a British nanny. Also had to put on the spice on it. Red spice. The Spice of Life. Life giveth. Life taketh. Wish there was something more to it, lacked a lot. Chicken? Cooked alright. Breast meat. Wasn't dry. Still, needed the salt. A lot of it. Dumped the red spice on it. Couldn't figure out where the flavor went. Looking underneath the table for it. Had to take out the gyroscope. CSI Las Vegas. 

Prob won't come here. Game has changed to much. The options are unlimited. And so am I. Got my faves. Gonna look around. It's out there. Just gotta look some more. Murder mystery. Clue. I'll pick the top hat. Do not pass Go. Amen.",gtwM4ijo65AN4DvXdgCu_w,19,18,3,9w7uxSoOQ2qgJklf2jTBDg

All the items are made with care, are fresh and served personally by the owners. They come to check on you frequently and clearly take pride in their establishment. 
A huge plus is the fact that they also serve FRESH FRUIT JUICES!!

Ordered two different types of kebabs, the salad, hummus, and it all was awesome! Service was on point, as it was kind a like being served at my uncles house.

The service is outstanding!!! From the moment you walk in, to the moment you leave, you're always treated like family.

At Zaytoon, every time I've gone in there, there are people of all ethnic backgrounds dining and shopping. 

The market carries everything and anything you need, to prepare a authentic Mediterranean meal. Their products are of a higher standard, and are priced lower than major grocery stores.

The quality and taste of the food stands at a higher level than any of their competition. It's no competition, when it comes to price.

2206289,2012-09-23,5,saQQmDQQJ14BVkm_sg53UA,"The Skinny: craving Mediterranean food - this place totally satisfies from their decadent Mushi to the Koobideh Kabob. (4) service: the owners are super friendly and food is served promptly (5),overall - it's rare to find a joint where you want to return to explore the different dishes of a culture. Zaytoon is one of those places (4.5).

I was craving hummus with some pita one day and the hubs found this place on Yelp. After that fateful night - we've been back at least 3x within the last week -- yes, it is that good.

The key dishes here IMHO are the appys (priced at $3.99 each). Our by far favs are the masto khiar (yogurt and cucumber) and the masto musir (shallot with yogurt). The yogurt itself is so thick and luscious, I bet you could turn the bowl over and not a dollop would escape. Yes it is that decadent. Paired with endless piping hot sesame topped Iranian flatbread (FYI -the owners keep the bread coming) - oh so crispy, flaky - it is definitely addicting. We've tried both the hummus and the kashe bademjaan (roasted eggplant dip) too which are both very good as well. 

I've tried their falafel and veggie sandwiches with both optional sides of the shiraz salad and fries. The sandwiches are loaded with onions, tomatoes, green peppers and cucumbers with a ?yogurt sauce and is oh so delicious. The falafel is crispy on the outside while retaining its fluffy interior. Completely satisfying.

The shiraz salad was nicely acidic to accompany the richness of the other items. Dressed with mint and citrus, the flavours of the onion, cucumber, tomato mixture really pop. The fries are okay and the portions are generous.

My hubby loves to get their chicken soltani. Both the chicken and koobedeh kabobs are well seasoned and moist. The plate comes with a roasted tomato, onions served with a bed of basmati rice. The butter and sumac on the table are used to dress the rice. 

We tried their pistachio ice cream flavoured with rosewater and saffron. Nicely floral with some cardamom mixed it, it was a nice way to finish a meal and cleanse the palate.

Every time we go there, I'm always looking around and try to see what other people are getting so we can try it next time. We saw another gentleman who ordered the koobideh kabob with fresh herbs and on fresh bread (aka KGB) which looked intriguing and has been put on our list to try the next time we are there. Not to mention there was an interesting stew they were offering over a different type of rice. The spinach soup and lamb shank sounded wonderful too.

A key factor to why we keep coming back is the service. The owners of the restaurant are really obliging and willing to take the time to explain the different dishes they offer. I was a little bit curious about their torshi - it's some form of Persian pickled vegetables. The owner actually brought some out for me to try and warned me it was an acquired taste (it was actually very good - a little bit sweet, nicely spiced --- however the hubs didn't care for it). It's really cool that they would do that.

Overall, this a great little neighbourhood joint that serves some delicious, intriguing eats for reasonable prices. Throw in the friendly service,  you have a hidden gem - not to be missed! 4.5 stars out of 5.",h9RUaaHa5kcQKqtJ-sgS0Q,11,12,4,XhKKXO2XVHChP6a7GyhC2g

we enter a small but rather full dining area which i would consider a good sign.
we were greeted immediately as i walked up to the register to take a look at the menu.
i was under the assumption that it was an order and pay first situation.
but when i told the man we were eating in, he immediately, and kindly, asked us to take a seat and he would come take our order.
so nice!

i ordered the falafel ($4) and a side of hummus with pita ($4) while my friend ordered a plate containing 2 giant skewers of meat, a small salad, a whole roasted tomato and basmati rice ($12).
the falafel were very tasty, just ever so slightly overcooked on the outside, but still extremely soft on the inside.
the hummus was also delicious with the standard chickpea and tahini flavors.  
i wasn't a huge fan of the dish the hummus was served on as i prefer it in a small bowl rather than a plate but i'm not one to judge a place on something as trivial as that.
i really enjoyed the fresh pita sprinkled with sesame seeds and could probably eat a ton of that with their hummus all day long.
my friend's dish looked delicious and i think it was since he finished the whole thing.  
i did try the basmati rice and it was very good.

I really had no idea that it was this little ethnic market and restaurant. They have separate entrances if just want sit down in the restaurant. Which is the way I went so never really walked around the market. You can see that they do have lot of stuff for the size of it and couple glass displays with different stuff. My review is only for the restaurant. Next time.

The menu has nice diversity from things that could associate with like Kabob, they have speciality dishes that sound really interesting (am sure traditional Iranian food; or assume because I never had Iranian food too base personnel experience on, and sandwiches most part straight forward. On one side of the menu they do have pictures of some of the more popular dishes just in case need visual. I got to admit helped me out being first timer. I also went with trust the server and ask for their recommendation. 

I ended up going with Kashke Bademjaan (Fried Iranian Eggplant Dip) starter and Chicken Soltani as my entree. The eggplant dip was pretty awesome!! The consistency was almost like Hummus. It had nice creamy texture but still have full body of roasted eggplant. It made for perfect spread on the fresh bread. I killed whole serving of bread with the eggplant dip. The fresh bread. I loved it. It nothing like your traditional bread. I think of it like thinly rolled out dough rolled out flat then popped in oven. It thin and compare to the first batch the second batch was much more crispy with cracker style. The first batch was basically like pita bread but so much better because dough made fresh daily. The bread topped with butter or olive oil and sesame seeds. 

The Chicken Soltani. It came with two kinds of Kabob the Chicken and Koobideh. The Koobideh basically beef Kabob but it has nice flavor and liked it better then the Chicken. The chicken was good. The seasonings for the beef really stood out much more plus it was more tender and not as dried out as the chicken. The rice was interesting used two different kinds. So visual makes for nice looking rice! It was good. The salad talk about refreshing. The waiter asked if wanted have half and half. Not sure if they do it all the time. I would ask because having the best of both sides. Winnah!!! 

The service was awesome. You can tell family run business. They were super attentive and very helpful explaining the menu since it was my first time and giving me great recommendations. Friendly.

For an appetizer we had the Kashk-e-bademjaan which is an Iranian eggplant dip. It was good and had kind of a dark flavor. It was served with DELICIOUS fresh flat bread sprinkled with sesame seeds.

For my entree I got the Zereshk polo with barberry rice which was grilled chicken served with basmatti rice sprinkled with saffron and barberries. I had never had barberries before. They were sweet and tart and reminded me of somewhere between a currant and a lingonberry. The chicken was nicely seasoned and moist.

My wife got the Shish kabob which was skewered pieces of fillet and vegetables. It was nicely seasoned and was served with a grilled tomato and basmatti rice sprinkled with saffron.

For dessert we split the ice cream and carrot juice dish. It consisted of  cubes of saffron ice cream served in a glass of fresh carrot juice. The ice cream has rose water and pistachios mixed into it. I'm not a big fan of rose water. However, the ice cream was still pretty good. The carrot juice was delicious and refreshing.

In one of the special request boxes, I asked if they could add some barberries (small currant-looking berries) to the rice, being that that was not a priced option on the menu. 

Now, I understand adding an additional charge to this request. I figured one dollar or two dollars at the most. They charged me an additional $5 for about a quarter cup of those little berries! Gimme a break! I could've ordered another appetizer at that price. I felt taken advantage of for sure. Will not be returning.",SONAVFINPLLyW5CdzMuN5w,1,0,3,TnmLKd56u6uXO5tJj4Infw

I started off with the hummus since that seems like a popular item. I don't even like chickpeas but IT'S SO GOOD. It comes with fresh bread and if you're reading this please order the hummus. Do it. 

The lamb shank was tasty but I liked the chicken and beef combination plate more. The ground beef was so flavorful. To my surprise, I also enjoyed the greenish black rice that came with my lamb, according to my server it was made with dill and flava (?) beans- I've never had anything that tasted like this before and it was so delightful. 

For dessert, I had baklava and the rose water, saffron and pistachio ice cream. The ice cream was weird at first but I like its unique flavor profile.

I love love love the chicken soltani! It comes with pieces of chicken breast, koobideh, rice and roasted tomato! Need I say more?! Both the chicken and koobideh are so flavorful and marinated perfectly! All the meats there are so tender as well.

The rest of my family are barg soltani lovers... Instead of chicken on the plate, it's a marinated thin sliced beef. Both are wonderful but I love the chicken, LOL!

I realize after tasting the food here that the names may sound similar, but there is a flavor difference. In all Mediterranean restaurants I've treated my flavor palette to, I have not been let down - including Zaytoon.

Chicken kabob plate: served with a good portion of rice. Side of sliced onions; a fave with any meat and balances flavors. Chicken so soft it probably doesn't require chewing - but please do. Recommend the chicken kabob a thousand percent for poultry eaters.

Beef kabob sandwich: added avocado - delicious choice! It's wrapped like a burrito; makes it easy to eat. Ordered with cucumber salad. Healthy meal - loved it! 

Almost got the chicken sandwich . I'm sure I'd be in love with that considering the flavor and texture of the chicken in the plate mentioned above. 

First try of Torshi. Pickled veggies unlike the raw crunchy pickled veggies I'm used to. This appeared almost sauteed cooked. It would've been perfect with a beef rice plate. I made do and ate it with the flat bread with butter, or put some in my sandwich before each bite.

Restaurant shares space with a small grocery store. Wish I had more time to browse and ask questions. 

Anywhoobees, pleasant service from the gentleman and lady tending to a busy lunch time. Also to the chefs in the kitchen for getting our food out in good time although it started getting really busy. We didn't wait long at all to be seated, or for our orders.

First,  the service is great! They are constantly busy but yet still make you feel welcomed.  Waiters and hostess are attentive and very warm.  On my last occasion dining in, a family came in with a child that had disabilities. The staff seemed to know them and made sure to welcome them. They made special orders to accommodate their needs and you could see that they genuinely cared about the family. As a person who has volunteered to work with children with disabilities, this was wonderful to see. Thank you staff for your good hearts. 

Now for the food...eat here...seriously. The lovely combination of flavors in their koobideh is perfect. Love the rice and it's always cooked just perfect.  Nooo hard bits..but uniformed tenderness. You don't need to add the sumac powder, but why skip it? The pita comes out hot, fresh and airy..huge by the way.  You could swaddle a puppy in that thing... The eggplant dip is awesome,  must try.

The dish additionally came with a sirazi salad.  The falafel was dry but didn't necessarily fall apart.  The wrap stuck together well and it wasn't drenched in sauce as some wraps tend to be.  I was hoping for pita instead of a wrap, but that might be one of those ask and you shall receive type of things.  The salad was unexpectedly good.  Usually the wraps I have come a la carte, so when I was told a salad is complimentary, my hopes were not high.  Wet cucumber and tomato, with a nice acidic flavor.  The combo was a perfect lunch.

The downside to the meal was two-fold.  First, I asked for the sauce in my wrap on the side and it came on.  Not the biggest deal, but I expect the customer to always be right.  Second, they charge you $1 fee for using a credit card to pay.  This was not told to me when I paid so when my bill came back $1 more, without warning, I was a little pissed off.

In general Middle Eastern food is flavorful and healthy and delicious.  Zaytoon was all of that and more.  We ate dinner there, where there is only about 7 tables.  The waiter and waitress were extremely friendly and sweet.  We started with their baba ghanoush that was so good I got an extra order to go home.  It came with a great fresh baked flatbread.  For entrees we got their ""bone in chicken kabob"" which was actually a whole cornish game hen cut into pieces, marinated and grill.  Super moist and flavorful.  It came with rice, an onion salad and a blistered tomato.  We also got their special which was a lamb shank and might have been one of the best lamb shanks we have ever had.  Delicious.  We walked out very happy.

Also they have fresh juices that they juice to order.  I got the watermelon and the boy got carrot and beet together.  Both were delicious and refreshing.  I will definitely go back, but just something to keep in mind, this isn't a huge restaurant, it is a very intimate setting.

I ordered the barg soltani, which comes with one skewer of barg and one of koobideh. I like that I was offered the option of getting a smaller portion of rice and getting some salad with my entree as well, to make for a more balanced meal. I also ordered the kashke bademjaan (fried eggplant dip). You are also given a complimentary piece of flatbread, which comes out hot, and is fairly large in size.

The entree came with the standard saffron rice and roasted tomato. I'm used to receiving roasted roma tomatoes, but I think they used a different tomato variety at Zaytoon. 

Overall, the food was very tasty, though a bit pricey. The barg was also a bit of a thinner cut than I am used to. Service was very friendly and attentive though. 

After my meal, I also browsed the adjacent market next door and picked up a few items.

P.S. They charge a $1 fee for all credit card use, regardless of the amount. A little bit annoying given that the fee assessed by the credit card company to the merchant is definitely not $1 per transaction; I would rather that they have a minimum charge for credit card use.",lQCY0csLfjdDn6cdVq43UA,1,2,4,tAJdeFtx6z1dgKWBTZOjqA

When we first walked in, it was kind of awkward because the hostess/waitress just... didn't say anything at all? She was friendlier later on, though.

We started our meal with bread and yogurt-shallot dip which, I'm not sure what I was expecting but it basically just tasted like your standard sour cream and onion dip. The bread it was served with, however, was totally fantastic! Hot, fresh, crisp, a little chewy, flavored with sesame seeds- the bread was top notch!

For our main dishes we shared the chicken soltani plate (chicken kabob and koobideh) and the barg kabob. The barg was juicy and flavorful but I was expecting more big chunks of steak instead of a thin slice. The chicken was really tasty and the koobideh was flavorful. It was all served with rice, grilled tomato and onion. I wished I had saved some of the bread/dip to make a sandwich out of it all- it was delicious!

We had to get some Persian ice cream for dessert because I've been obsessed ever since I tried it at Saffron and Rose in LA and Lavash in San Francisco. The ice cream is from Mashti Malone in LA and it is amazing, but you don't have to eat it there for dessert... you can buy it by the pint in the market next door! That's what I did after the meal and I'm totally going back for more. It is some of the best ice cream EVER- so much flavor.

Overall, our meal was really good and everything was high quality. I am really torn between 3 and 4 stars but I think if I had made slightly smarter menu choices, it would definitely be 4- I think this is a 4 star establishment and I will go back again for lunch for sure.",rUW7_B9pBNdDR3Y2bBz9TQ,2,0,4,OPTqpA-oQ8i51NPjGS5SmA

Although Zaytoon(translates to ""Olive"")  has been around for years, we finally got to experience this restaurant/market, and having been here twice already, I am truly a fan of this local family owned business!

 The appetizers are a great start for a meal, and if you have a big party, the Hummus, Baba Ganoush, and Masto Khiar(love.this.stuff!!!) are all delicious and great for sharing. Baskets of Taftoon(flatbread with Sesame and Nigella Seeds)are brought to your table along with the apps, and if you run out, simply ask for more!

We've tried the delicious fall-off-the-bone Lamb Shank here too, but my favorite plate as of now is the Barg Soltani, a combination of their Iranian-style Filet and Koobideh with Basmati and Saffron Rice, onions, butter, and a grilled tomato. Their fresh squeezed juices are a great addition to your meal as well, and after your meal, you can shop around in their market next door.

Service here is also pleasant and the owner and his wife are always so personable.
Zaytoon is definitely going into our lunch/dinner rotation. Oh, they also have Mashti Malones killer ice creams from LA for sale up front in the market side if you're not too stuffed from lunch or dinner!  ALOHA!!!

I've only had Persian food once, in Los Angeles, so I'm still learning.  After studying the menu, I went with their KGB sandwich--Koobideh Kabob that's served on their fresh baked bread and served with some sliced onion, plenty of basil greens, a roasted tomato, and a grilled jalapeño.  The beef was excellent.  The juices soaked the bread that covered the entire plate.  I got an iced tea with my dinner.

Service was excellent.  An older man waited on me originally and then was replaced by a younger man--the owner, I believe.  Iced tea was refilled twice with no need to ask for a refill.  The server checked back to make sure everything was OK.

Since I'm such a babe in the woods with this cuisine, I asked the owner if there was a correct way to eat the food.  He said what I had done was exactly the way he does it.  Let the juices soak the bread and enjoy all the richness of the dish.

I left without checking out the store section.  When I got home I saw Tony's photo of the ice cream and I wanted to kick myself.  However, with how good this meal was, I'll be a regular.  I have to try some different dishes and enjoy some dessert.",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,11,6,4,hEeV_ZqNEvDU2M8ZRH1CYw

It didn't quite live up to my hopes based on all of the reviews, but what my wife and I had was good, if not rather expensive for what it was. I was truly disappointed in my barg, which despite being filet mignon was served in a razor-thin sheet of meat instead of delectable, three-dimensional bites. I honestly preferred the kibbedeh (ground beef) to the filet. The chicken soltani was decent but could've used more spice.

The shallot and yogurt dip was indistinguishable from standard sour cream, but the bread that came with it was pretty good - fluffy and a little buttery, with a good texture.

If you don't have a fountain and serve your pop in bottles, then Mexican Coke is a must, and they don't disappoint there either.

Service was a bit erratic, and some strange man - who I don't think worked at the restaurant or the market - came up to our table and offered us cookies. Stupidly, I accepted but luckily didn't die.

After waiting about 15 minutes a table opened  up so we promptly sat down before  anyone else walked in and took it. A little while later we saw another group come in looking for a table. Meanwhile the staff cleared our table and got us drinks and we were looking at the menu and after about 10 minutes another waiter came over and said there's a waiting list of people in front of us and we have to give up the table. Wait what? We've been there for about a half hour now and were the only ones waiting and no one said anything about a waiting list. I complained and said that's ridiculous there was no wait list.

I had no idea it was a bakery when I ordered from Zaytoons, but i was pleasantly surprised to see a shelf after shelf of middle eastern goods for purchase! So I made my way up to the counter on the restaurant side and spoke to a man (may have been the owner) and asked if I could buy some Dolma (appetizers wrapped in grape leaves) and he gave me 4 for free. Now THAT is something that impresses me. After eating their AMAZING baba ganooj, dolma, and KGB sandwich, after being greeted warmly by each member of their staff, they earned each of these 5 stars.

It's a small grocery shop joined by the small dining area on the other side. The grocery side has some exotic offerings that you would have a tough time finding anywhere else. I've become addicted to the Mashti Malones pistachio. It's not your average pistachio.. it's bright yellow and you can taste cardamom, rose water, whole chewy pistachio bits! It's insane! I haven't purchase anything here but the ice cream, to be honest.. once I found it it was like tunnel vision.. However, the produce seems to be very reasonable and I could see myself coming here for vegetables now.

So, the restaurant portion! They offer freshly made juices with some interesting combinations like carrot and rose water. I had a watermelon juice which was delightful and oh-so refreshing. On my first visit here, the service was sort of spotty. On the second visit, they were much much friendlier, and maybe this comes from them treating you more like a regular once they know you're not just a one time visit.

The fresh warm lavash they serve here is dotted with sesame seeds and blistered just a little bit. They'll bring you an unending amount of this bread until you say Uncle!  It seems to be made to order, and is perfect for dipping in their bracing hummus, enlivened from the addition of lemon juice. I find most hummus seems to lean towards lemon, or tahini. Theirs is lemony. Oh, and endless lavash. The server was kind of enough to make many recommendations and answer any question without missing a beat. Did I mention endless lavash?

So far here I've had their chicken kabob wrap with house salad. The chicken was cooked perfectly, and seasoned well. The fresh tomatoes in there just added to brightness of the wrap, and it was big enough that I took half of it home. The salad is a mix of tomatoes, cucumbers and onions that have been diced and tossed with some parsley, mint, lemon and olive oil.

The koobideh is seasoned ground beef kabob, which is very traditional, and amazing! Very tender, perfectly seasoned, a lot of interesting flavors. All of the kabobs come with steamed rice and a charred tomato. Love me some charred tomato!",Gap65780O9PI3Ui7Zj6Avw,9,6,4,HdFNL_cdnl9xV02HmlDXLg

I came here about 7 months ago with my ex and son. Hes Persian and wanted to go somewhere besides Sababa. I found this gem on Yelp and off we went. Its pretty easy to find and its a smaller eatery. One side is the resturant and the other is the market. Youre greeted by the owners as you walk in and they seat you. I love family owned businesses!! My ex asked if they spoke Farsi and of course they did so off into a convo they went. The waitress was very kind and caring towards my son and I. 

I ordered the chicken sandwich and my ex got the koobideh combo. We were given the pita, which i wasnt a fan of and sat there talking and waiting for our food. My ex devoured like 3 pitas and I peeked at the market area. The waitress was super sweet and even gave my son lots of attention.

Our food arrived and it was hot and looked yummy! The fries with my wrap thing were seasoned super good and the wrap was also succulent and delish! My bf said his food was also juicy and yummy! Pretty standard persian food here, just a little pricey. Mostly bc I think they use Halal.

I ordered Zaytoon for a Bachelorette Party weekend in Vegas with 9 girls.  I worked and confirmed the order with Saam through email (easiest way for me to organize it since I am in Orange County, CA).  Saam helped me figure out how many of each item we would need and I never felt like he was over estimating, he thought I was over estimating which shows how honest he is! 

We ordered Lubia Polo, Koobideh kabobs, boneless chicken Kabobs, gormeh sabzi, gheimeh, shirazi salad, mastro khiar, hummus, and rice all buffet style.  Saam and I arranged a time to meet in the lobby of the cosmopolitan (where we were staying) and he was prompt and on time with the food along with garnishes, plates, utensils, and napkins (nice and thoughtful touch)!

The bride and a few of the girls are Persian and some of the girls had never had Persian food.  We all LOVED the food! We ate it for dinner on Saturday night, after then club for a snack, for breakfast the next day, and for dinner that night again (we stayed in a suite at Cosmo with a full kitchen which allowed us to do this).  Saam was right, I did order too much food but it was amazing and we ate every last bit of it! I have had Persian food before and Zaytoon is authentic and delicious.

I also tried the dolma which had lttle pieces of pomegranate sprinkled on the top. It was served warm which is a plus for me. I was hoping it would be cooked with tomato sauce. That is how I'm used to eating them since childhood but everywhere I have tried never serves it that way. I guess cooking them in tomato paste isn't the norm.

My main entree was a special cut of Iranian fillet mignon served with basamanti rice. The meat was nice and tender. The rice also had a pleasant taste to it.

Persian food is not mainstream in America, but maybe it should be. There's a lot of emphasis on fresh vegetable and meat presented in the most appealing manner. The beef and chicken kebabs were succulent and worked well with the buttered rice, broiled tomatoes and raw onions. Serving sizes are substantial and can be shared for a dollar or two extra. make sure you try some of the appetizers with the homemade fresh sesame flatbread. The yogurt and shallot ""Dip"" went particularly well with the kebabs. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this excellent restaurant.

It was very fortunate that it was across a dessert place we initially planned on going to but our trip was highlighted by our dinner here at Zaytoon!
Our server took care of us and suggested the Sumac and the Chili oil because we had no idea how Persian's eat this. I copied the guy across our table and put butter in his rice! I whispered ""Dude he put butter in his rice so we should too!"" so we did. Then our server asked us if we wanted chili sauce. I generally do not put chili sauce on my food but since I was trying a new place, I guess why not? THEY MAKE THEIR OWN CHILI OIL! I was expecting it to taste like Lee Kum Kee. It did not. I ended up mixing my rice in Chili oil and next thing we knew. Our server showed us what Sumac is. Oh boy, I enjoyed that Sumac so much I just drizzled it on top like it was rainbow sprinkles on ice cream! I taste tested the chili oil and spices too. I had to make sure I actually made sure I was not dreaming about the flavor of their food. The food just felt homemade except for really good plating.

I told my friends I could not stop talking about my food trip today. I still talked about the food at the Custard place and in our group chat! I could not stop talking about this place to four people so I decided to share about my experience!",ndAF-JnHYaq35t8YiI8smw,0,0,5,dLlv3hbW8fe0FYxBEIHGqA

I would probably give the restaurant 3.5 stars, but the market 5, so it balances somewhere around a 4. 

The restaurant is a great neighborhood place, very cozy, very, very clean, and with a very friendly staff. Somewhere between 5 and 10 tables, and authentic in that wonderful, unpretentious way that announces their food is good, and they live here, so sit down and eat. The food is very good; we had a group, and 3 of us had the kofta, one of us had lamb. Everything was good, but not slap-yo-momma I have to order something else. The kofta started to dry out towards the end, and I sort of felt that overall, most things could use a little seasoning and salt - BUT everything came with a lovely packet of Sumac salt. It needs that. That makes everything much more lovely. Also, we licked the bottom of the Babaganoush. 

OHH!!! OH! And the Market! They have sweet lemons!!!! What, Foolish American who shops only at smiths? ""Lemons are never sweet?"" you say? Ah, fool that you are, you have not shopped at ethnic markets and bought things you do not know the name of. Sweet lemons are sort of like the beautiful godly love child of meyer lemons and tangerines. They are soft, and about the size of a small valencia orange. They are yellow and speckly, and sweet with a sharp tang on the finish. They make margaritas superlative. They are also awesome peeled into mandarin-esque wedges and eaten as snackies. Zaytoon HAS THEM. And about 10 other wonderful citrus and fruits you won't find at albertsons, for prices you won't find at albertsons, fresher than you will find at alberstons.

Went to go browse around and they have a nice selection of goods that are kinda hard to find to make Mediterranean food and in the back they have a cafe. Different canned goods, sauces, spices, bulk bins of beans, yogurts and cheeses, some fresh fruits and produce, lots of cookies and chocolate goodies. I then get to the ice cream and freak the fuck out. MASHTI MALONES ice cream. It's from Los Angeles and is a family owned shop that has exotic flavors: rose, lavender, rose saffron, mango, saffron pistachio, ginger rose, orange blossom.Yeah, it reminds me of happy happy times growing up on this stuff. I got a rose ice cream sandwich since they didnt have pints of anything but pistachio and faludeh. I also found my favorite white toblerones and other foreign goodies.

Came in today after Slider Truck, and they had all sizes of the Creamy Rose so I got their biggest size, a quart and a small cup of Pistachio. We also got gummi bears. I know, why get these at a cultural market? The mood struck and they are super soft and make me happy as I type. I didn't need any cooking ingredients at the moment, but will come and expand some of my spices and sauces when I run out of what I have. 

I'm going to keep coming back though for Mashti Malones. It's one of my favorite treats ever. Thank you Zaytoon for carrying them!",n86B7IkbU20AkxlFX_5aew,0,1,4,amLTIOz89RzqdyLQ9HGLEA

I always get the bone in chicken kabob! However, I know no matter what dish I order it will be perfected. I wish they had better seating. They only have about 8 or so tables. This is one of those whole in the wall places. I've never really had to wait either so maybe the flow of customers for their tables is sufficient. Personally, speaking growing up we'd have my big birthday dinner at a kabob restaurant. Hence, many have closed down or the quality has gone down. This place would be perfect to bring that tradition back if it was bigger. There's a wall diving the seating area and Mediterranean market! It makes sense though and it's killing two birds with one stone. The appetizers are only 3.99!!! The kabob dishes are very reasonable too!

Everything is straight-forward wholesomeness, mildly spiced just to accentuate the flavors of the ingredients.  My favorites are the masto musir with their hot, fresh bread, the chicken kabob with the incredible rice (delish mushed in with the grilled tomato they serve on each plate), and the shirazi salad.  They have some of the best french fries I ever tasted and their chicken kabob sandwich is made irresistible by the special sauce they put in it.",Z11M5QBjRT_kwg1cl4ugKg,2,2,5,Lm-Akw70jpCnX2Zn61sDAg

I enjoyed everything here and the prices are really good and unlimited bread which can fill you up. So be careful no to eat too much bread even tho it so good.

5390859,2012-06-27,2,saQQmDQQJ14BVkm_sg53UA,"Been meaning to check this place out for a while as I'm a sucker for Mediterranean cuisine in general, and because I thought it was a lot closer to my work than it ended up being.  I know, I know, there's an app for that, but sometimes I throw caution to the wind and just go for it.

I called them up for a take out order and decided on the Regular Chicken Kabob Entree and an iced tea.  I must mention that from taking my order over the phone to doing the cashier work, the gentleman who helped me was extremely friendly.  After my long drive back to the office and opening the food, I was extremely disappointed to not see any bread.  Upon looking back at the menu, I realized that it was not something which came with the entree, but rather a side that needed to be ordered.  After bashing my head against the desk for about 5 minutes due to this error, I began eating what I did have, which were some nicely cooked pieces of chicken (though not very much of it) over a HEAP of basmati rice.  On the side were several chopped up onions, and an unappetizing looking charred tomato and pepper.  I'm generally not a fan of these items from any mediterranean joint, so not docking them for that, maybe it's just me.  The chicken tasted fine, but didnt really separate itself from other places I've had the same dish.   I think I would have preferred some more char on the chicken instead of on the veggies, but it did end up very juicy which I must say was nice.   The rice tasted average to me, though I did appreciate the amount they gave.  I can't help but think that had I ordered some bread on the side (though I'd prefer it just came with some) that I might have enjoyed the whole thing more.  I definitely know for next time.

For the lack of bread with the entree, and the fact that there wasn't too much chicken in my meal, I can't say that I thought it was that great of a value.  Zaytoon definitely requires some more investigating to me, and I'll also note that my friend that I brought with me got a falafel sandwich with fries and his fries smelled and looked heavenly.  He polished them off during the drive back to work and I didnt get to try myself.   I have to wrap this review up, the picture of the fresh bread that I can see below where I type now is pissing me off.

I was definitely satisfied, I ordered the garb soltani? And the steak was honestly nothing special, a bit dry but still flavorful, though I wish the steak had a bit more of a sear to it. The koobideh was surprisingly jucier. The sumac is really good, I put that shit on everything. And use the butter they give you for the rice, it takes it to another level. The babaganoush(spelling?) was really good and smoky.

Overall it was a satisfying meal, just nothing to really write home about and the price point of $20 was a little steep for the quality of the food thus the 4 stars and not 5.",2r0CnsEbhBo75KYoVF8eGA,0,0,4,8EGUTw0ydqFwcq6vyxip0w

Came here for an early dinner.

Our restaurant is in the same building. The owner is friends of my family and I got to meet Sam the owner today. But besides the fact that my family is friends with the owner. I love the food.I decided to come here because of the yelp reviews and location near me prior to knowing my family knew the owner. 

No frills, causal dining, friendly service (Hello Ali!) and no stress parking. I love eating in Vegas compare to the city I live in (LA) because of easy free parking lots.

My bff and I sat ourselves down and ordered the chicken kabob plate. Bread service was nice, food came out a decent time and we also tried the Neapolitan dessert. 

I will be be. Decent prices, loved the music and the smell of the restaurant. 

There's also a market attached.

I'll be back!

Shukran!

I'm a fan.",0nOIH8qIMnmZdLCTemnRsw,9,3,5,V64z8UGBNT2kir2zgsOUWA

But, I've concluded that I can't be selfish and this little gem of a place off the strip has some of the best food and hospitality. My bf and I have had the lamb and chicken, both of which are juicy with lots of flavor. The Dolmas are vegetarian and made with pomegranates and love. I could live off of those and the hummus with homemade bread. And even when I feel like I'm about to burst, I can still salivate thinking about the Baklava. My personal favorite are the ones with pistachios however you have six different variations from which to choose. If you take your food to-go, the family run market and restaurant will give you a nice hot cup of tea while you wait. Just take the time to appreciate the charcoal drawing of Time Magazine's ""The Afghan Girl"" the owner's talented wife so beautifully completed.",SAUmR0phGr-D3qAle2Lbdw,1,1,5,VSYEDaOx0fBeAn7SAxbJew

The atmosphere is still the same which is why I won't give a 5-stars because for me, a restaurant is not only about the food but the atmosphere of the place as I said earlier.

Food 4.5/5: My past review was a 3.5/5 and I'm giving them a +1 since my last review mainly because the food is good. Their Zereshk polo is excellent and they have good Kababs. Definitely a good place to eat some good food. Last but not least, the bread is a killer! You should definitely order some Kashke Bademjan with it!
Service 5/5: Really nothing to say about the service. The family is always here to make sure that you're doing good and you like the food. They're great people and that is why I will always support them when I'm in Vegas. My past review was a 4 but I have to say that the service that you get here is higher than average!

Give it a try, you won't be disappointed.",L4S915BUVypnswOLWUWlYw,1,0,4,ff5QaTWIx8kcmSjKU80YyA
5809642,2013-04-10,0,saQQmDQQJ14BVkm_sg53UA,"I recently decided to go gluten free and dairy free. As a result I have been visiting more Middle Eastern, Thai, and Indian restaurants (Mexican is next). I have been to Jerusalem Grill, Amena Bakery (also awesome). Kabob Grill, the place that used to be ""Flame Kabob"" on Sunset by the airport, Stephanos, and Kabob Corner to name a few. Most of them are pasable to good. Sometimes you encounter watery hummus, canned dolma, etc...I have a few goto places so far. That is until I went to Zaytoon. Wow. First, even though I have been forgoing bread, the fresh grilled/baked bread they brought out was amazing, I had to try it. Fantastic. Fresh, hot, steamy, crunchy, chewy, yum. The hummus was rich and creamy, the baba ganoush was garlicky, creamy, and tasty, the dolma were warm and fresh. Wow. I think we ordered half the appetizers. The falafel were hot, crunchy, and so savory. What really wowed me was the chicken kabob and the steak ""kabob"" (I do not remember the exact name, it was less of a kabob and more of a strip of thin steak on a skewer). They were both so flavorful, juicy, and fresh. I am getting hungry just remembering it. Also, the rice was tasty, and they had these currants (or some other red berry) that came on the dolma and we could have gotten on the rice that was sweet and delicious without being cloying at all. I can not wait to go back.

Also, the market they have attached to it has a great selection of middle eastern items I have not seen in town before. Deserves 5 stars even though the decor leaves a bit to be desired since it is both a market and a restaurant.",5fefSJ8gFQd_nANLezdfpw,3,0,5,gWQbGoFwDEGvHVxWeaB7tw

5918911,2010-09-30,2,saQQmDQQJ14BVkm_sg53UA,"After reading Jade W's reply about where else to look for Mashti Malone (Persian style) Ice Cream, I Yelped Zaytoon Mediterranean Market and Kabob, which another patient where I go for my PT sessions had also recommended last week.  So with the location programmed in my head, I drove to Zaytoon after my PT appointment for my late lunch.

The market is larger than I expected for an ethnic market located near Desert Breeze Park.  There are plenty of parking spaces in the strip mall where it is located, so buy as much as you want, because the walk to the car will be a short one.  The market has a decent size herbs & spices section, including Sumac, which I have recently heard about in my Mediterranean Cuisine class. They also carry fresh herbs in the refrigerator and they are in good condition and priced reasonably.  But I was mainly here to try the kabob and the Mashti Malone ice cream, which I didn't find on my own and had to ask about with the owner/cashier.

Anyway, my primary objective is to try their kabob and I ordered their Koobideh Kabob entree ($8.99), which is Persian marinated ground beef, grilled on a sword-like skewer, and served with grilled tomato and Basmati (long grain) rice, and some raw onions.  The portion was good, and the Koobideh was juicy and pretty tasty. I would give it a 4 stars on the food. And 5 stars if they also serve fresh bread (like the one at Flame Kabob) too.

Service was good, but I was also the only in the ""restaurant"" at around 3:20pm, and the older gentleman and later the son(?) both came out on separate occasion to ask how the food was and if everything was okay, plus give me suggestion about the traditional way of eating the Basmati rice (which is to mix it with some of the soften butter and sprinkle with some Sumac).  So 4.5 stars there.

I also asked about and was directed to their freezer right by the cashier and the door, where they keep all the Mashti Malone Persian Ice Creams.  I tried the Rosewater Saffron with Pistachios Ice Cream Sandwich last night, and wanted to try a different flavor today and went with the Creamy Rosewater Ice Cream ($2.99 for the smallest size container or 4 fl oz) so I can have it at the store.  I love the taste and fragrance of the rosewater, which is so different from the other more traditional ice cream flavors available everywhere else.

They also serve fresh squeezed juice at the juice bar, but I didn't see a menu for that.  Their ad states that they serve fresh juice (juiced per order) and have no additives, no added sugar and made from fresh not frozen ingredients.  Which makes this a hidden gem for juice lovers.

With Zaytoon being in my neighborhood, I will definitely be back for more ice cream, kabobs and sample their Juice Bar offerings.

P.S.  They also offer cater services and will deliver within a limited delivery area for a 10% delivery charge and on minimum order of $50.",RQlnSCjuqMnhR3Qk6j4KoA,7,4,4,gttDEHAQCfwxq3j5SU7IWw
