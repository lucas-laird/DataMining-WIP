It seemed the perfect combination of syrup and carbonation.  After shopping, I was craving a soda pop.  The GF and I stopped in to the BK to get one.  There was approximately three cars ahead of us, which one would think was not a big deal but at this particular location on a Monday, one might want to think again.  It was somewhere in the 8 to 10 minute range before we made it to the window.  While at the window I was told my one large Coke was $16!  The clerk at the window when I told him said nothing and turned around to get the manager.  The manager was nice enough and comped the Coke.  Serves me right....I probably should not be drinking ti anyways.",HJj82f-csBI7jjgenwqhvw,6,5,2,CmoWJtYuN2ha0E5jriH22g

Been through several times but this last time was the worst.  Was trying the fry burger and it looked nothing like the commercial.  In fact, the meat was tiny, they globbed some condiments and threw like 4 fries in the burger and called it a night.   I could have ordered a whopper meal and made the damn thing myself better.

Understandably, it is a fast food place but perhaps it's just me.  I expect more from these joints due to their location and I've had better service at their sister places in ghettos.  

Which makes you wonder how they stay afloat at all sometimes.",cviyGIyg_hAa8_BZ9FIFRw,0,1,2,FtI2JiEjIpvZb1LcYUqFgw
3257801,2011-06-16,0,meIoY_9NhN8ttxL7ZcpEYQ,"It's a Burger King.  Standard Formula, standard food.

One thing that bugs me about this location is that they ALWAYS ask me to pull forward (not to the parking lot) but just forward to get my food.  I think it's because they don't want their drive through times to go through the roof.

That being said, the food production here is slower than others I've visited and the employees at times are hit and miss.  Teenagers that give no smile, don't even say a word to you (just put your hand out for payment) and in general don't give you the satisfaction of good service while spending your money.

The food is fine, the employees here need to work on their happy faces.",dLrMDYQ9TwfodJxYLfaKDQ,3,0,2,JX4inoitJnBEk2HuhlncTw

I felt really bad when the manangers, a woman with long black hair & a man with tattoos were raising their voices & being super rude at their coworkers about the hashbrowns that were made. I understand that whatever the problem was with the hashbrowns shouldn't be served to the customers & I'm well aware just like any other restaurant you don't want to serve customers anything bad. However, I'm sure there's a better way to tell a coworker how to do their job or what they can improve on without raising your voices.

I had just done some physically demanding work and needed something to hold me over till dinner, so I ordered a Whopper Jr. It was the size of a kids burger plus it was old and disgusting.(I have eaten at Burger King many times and it was the wrong sized burger) I ate it because I was starving. It was definitely one of the worst burgers I have ever ate. The child behind the register however was quite polite. There was no use complaining as I had many errands to run and even if they gave me something for free on the next visit I would not eat it. I will never eat at that location again.I try to find something good everywhere but if I could give it zero I would.

5367155,2013-05-06,2,meIoY_9NhN8ttxL7ZcpEYQ,"So disappointed! I just recently had my first Whopper and let me tell you I loved it. I went to this location ordered 2 Whoppers, 1 Fish, 1 Chicken, 1 large Fry and 1 large Onion Ring. You would have thought I ordered the entire store. I made my order at 10 am and did not leave till 10:30!! What a joke...

The asst. manager Lazaro was so checked out. He was not leading his team, the store was filthy, food everywhere. Not one person in the store seemed to care about anything. They screwed up my order 3 times and had to re make it. 

Lazaro was looking at me like I was the bad guy. Get it together people, it is just Burger King. Everything gets cooked the same way every time. So after this long awaited wait, I finally got home. Could not even finish this food, it was the absolute worst thing I have ever tasted. I think they were using old meat. I had to toss in the trash because of my fear of food poisoning.

Thanks a lot Lazaro for your great leadership skills. (NOT!!) Most people would be thrilled to have a job in this economy and do it with pride. I will never return to this location. You have most likely ruined my Whopper experience.",nixQjPlfVhMEhrNkmp5FDw,3,2,1,vmgJcv8699WLoZ6EXlEbNQ
