We just started eating here and have never had a bad experience or bad meal here. 
They ask you ""on a scale of 1 to 10 how spicy you want it"" ? 
I'm glad they asked, because I want a 7 , not a 5 and not a 10 ..... usually everyone else is somewhere in between. 
The staff is as wonderful as their Thai Tea. They are just warm genuine people that take pride in the food the prepare and the service they give. 
My favorites are the pad Thai and the spicy fried rice. 
Awesome lunch specials that are $6.50 a plate between 11am-3pm. 

Wish I had more to say , but ""please believe"" its worth checking out!",TtV527nQhO9ziCMEIhGEKg,0,0,5,FrsKvW_2Nb0Xfw3IVuYqKA

When I called to order the lady who answered the phone was very nice and patient with us as we tried to figure out what we wanted. However, that was the ONLY good thing that I can say about this place. 

First off, they told me about 45 mins and it ended up taking almost an hour and a half!! Their portions were hardly anything at all---other than the pad thai, that was the only thing that was a decent size portion. My dad had some beef green bean thing and it barely covered the bottom of the to-go box!! You could still see the foil at the bottom. I have never been to a Thai/Chinese restaurant that had suck wimpy portion sizes. We also ordered the Chicken Satay.....HORRIBLE!!! They were so tiny and super super DRY!!! I couldn't even chew them....they just went in the trash because no one could. :( 

Maybe this place is better when you go to the restaurant, rather than having it delivered...I almost wish I had because I would TOTALLY SEND ALL OF THIS FOOD BACK!! Overall, very disappointed in this thai place! Next time we will be going out!",2knKmIS2P26HkfiuHUEl1Q,0,0,1,qdHVa7-m5aTQSVtXmUqr7Q

Was very surprise how great the food was, if your into larb dishes make sure you order the larb moo(grill pork slice flavor with spices) it is sooo yummy! And also don't forget to order gai yang(marinated grill chicken) it is pact with flavor and very tender. Thats about the only 2 things i order frequently but pretty much everything is good. The only downside is the wait time, make sure you order for pickup and avoid lunch hours if you like to dine in, cause they get extremely BZ.

The restaurant does looks very unassuming from the outside but the inside is clean and welcoming so don't let that deter you.

My husband ordered a tofu curry, and the waitress was nice enough to notice and inquire about the fact that he did not eat the bell peppers in the curry; she happily informed him that next time he orders he can tell them to make it without the peppers and they would be happy to do it for him. I wanted a comfort food, so I ordered a simple Thai fried rice, which was exactly what I needed; it was terrific.

There was a good amount of tofu and veg and nice flavors. I did find one slice of green bell pepper.  The brown rice is a good, healthy option. The medium is spicy, next time i will order mild.

This place is great for pick up or dining in, but pricey for delivery. I spent $20 on lunch, the curry was $10+$3 dollar delivery charge and a tip.

I'm having the leftovers for lunch today with some sesame kale i got from the market this morning.

This place prepares homecooked meals and like the previous review stated, no kidding on the spice.  My wife and I order a level 2 on our Tom Yun soup and Green Curry and my eyes are watery. Whether it be green curry, papaya salad, Thai Sukiyaki, or Mango with sticky rice, the dishes are awesome. 

Forget the lousy service at ""the original Thai BBQ""-which we deem is like comparing In and Out and McDonald.  We are always treated well and always checked upon.  This place is a gem compared to most Asian restaurants in the valley.

As for value for your money, the portions are appropriate for their worth and most dishes are enough for 2-3 people.  I definitely would recommend them to anybody.",O0v4IgJgzLocpbQnZt66fA,0,0,5,4yOhQGH3tVocBqq8ZGDvLA

I give this rating because we frequent the place every week and are never disappointed.  Sakun is small and in a tiny strip mall.  Look past that and there is great food at a very reasonable price that is consistently good.  The staff is always working hard and it shows in the service and the food.  Is there ever anything not perfect?  Sure, it happens, but this little gem is a must stop.  If they ever get any media traction i am sure the food will be rated higher.

As I was driving to work, I noticed a delivery car with the sticker SAKUN THAI Restaurant.  As I yelped it to read reviews, they were decent enough to check if this Thai restaurant satisfied my Spicy Chicken cravings.  

I came for dinner on a Monday evening and was the only one in there, so I was a bit skeptical.  It's a cozy authentic restaurant with the manager/waitress was very friendly, so I didn't hesitate to experiment.

588443,2010-12-30,0,7FLHJMOYszFPCqK3tg5umA,"After work I had a craving for something that had tons of veggies and spicyness.  What else would would be better than Thai?  Since I live right down the road, I pass this place every day and finally decided to stop in.

I've found that the tiny, hole in the wall, ""ma & pa"" eateries usually have the most authentic cuisine, and Sakun Thai holds true to this.  I ordered the Papaya Salad ($7.95), and Spicy Eggplant w/Jumbo Shrimp ($9.95).  

The Papaya Salad comprised of your standard ingredients and had a good flavor.  Only thing I didn't like about it were the tiny tiny tiny shrimp mixed in.  They were so small, only about a half inch in total length, so I'm not sure if they were shrimp or brine (lol), but they were somewhat hard and very fishy tasting.  I picked these out.  After spitting them out that is.

The Spicy Eggplant w/Jumbo Shrimp was flavorful.  It was comprised of shrimp, eggplant, sweet basil, chili, onion & bell pepper.  They didn't skimp on the amount of shrimp or eggplant, and these shrimp were a lot better than the midget shrimp described above.

I could have ordered one or the other since the portions were larger than I expected, and I still would have had left overs.  I got a #7 spice level and still added some myself, next time I'll be going with an 8 or 9.  That's only because I like super spicy.  I had my order to go but the service was still great.  Gina, who I believe is the owner, was very cheerful and we had great conversation while my order was being prepared.

Since the food, pricing, location and service was good, this will probably be one of my regular stops when I need to satisfy a spice craving.  I actually liked this place better than Lotus of Siam (which I think is WAY overrrated).",9xBDxlvOPBT8I2L9lVSqxg,4,1,3,7ciw37dNGYRp9A7ycGCPGg

   I deferred to John since he has experience with Thai food and let him order. We started with :

Sakun Thai egg Rolls
Chicken Sate w/ Peanut sauce
Shrimp Rolls
Shrimp Salad

All were very good

Then we had the Tom Yum Shrimp soup - very good

Orange Chicken
Spicy Catfish - outstanding
Pad Thai Chicken
White rice
Stuffed Chicken Wings - WOW
Thai spaghetti = Thank you Anna

Though our spice level was 3,4 /10 because I want to enjoy the food and not be over whelmed we could have gone to 5,6 /10. The servings are very good for 2/4 people to share
 
Do not be deceived by the unassuming outside appearance, this is a very good Thai restaurant, I just wish it were closer to where I live, but we will definitely stop there to eat when we are on that side of town.

Let's rate the Pad Thai. As compared to Pin Kaow, the dish is not so good; as compared to Thai House on Maryland Parkway, Sakun's Pad Thai is far superior.

All in all I rate Sakun well below Pin Kaow, but far above Thai House, and maybe not quite as good as Satay Thai Bistro, based on food alone. The spiciness, as in most Thai restaurants is geared to American tastes, so a ""10"" comes in about as hot as most bottled salsas.

I will return here, mainly because it's conveniently located to where I work, and the value is good for very edible food.",vgHm8sXiGb1-w_CU66Vvdw,0,0,3,zv_p6PncgvUK5g2kU2hMwA

It was my first time and I can guarantee that there will not be a second time.  I came here with a few classmates and we were all EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED!!! The service was just bad and no customer service skills at all.  The waitress took another table's order when our table came in before them....they even finished their food and our food just barely came out.  That just showed poor management.  And the food was SUPER SALTY and one of my friend's pad thai dish had a hair in it (and the pad thai was very soggy).  When we informed the waitress, she even asked ""where?"" (really??? who does that!! ) and she didn't even apologized at all and just said ""oh, ok"".  Then she just walked off when my friend was still talking to her.  There's more...they claimed to have brown rice on the menu and isn't it supposed to be a healthy purpose...but their brown rice should be called ""purple"" rice because they mixed in purple rice which is normally used for desserts and other sweet dishes (hmmmmm, kind of ruining the healthy purpose here!!!)

I normally don't leave a review but this was just very very very unpleasant....so bad that we didn't even tip at all.  We left a big $0 and left a few comments on back of  the receipt, hoping that they will make a change.  It seems that there a lot of high stars on previous reviews, which was why I gave this place a chance...but definitely after that I will not recommend anyone to come here unless they start having better service and less sodium.  Also, this is not to make any racial comments, but that time I was there, 95% of the customers were non Asians (maybe that's why they might not know the difference between authentic or even good Thai food as compared to bad high sodium Thai food) I do hope everyone to have BETTER experience than what my friends and I had.

I definitely recommend this place for their lunch specials and this is my go-to place for your hour breaks or to-go. It's usually the same ladies that are working and there are usually only 2 working at a time and during lunch time it's really packed (almost every table is filled). I give the women a thumbs up for their service and the quick turnaround of getting our food after we order. After coming here so many times, the waiters remember the plates we want to order which is a plus for me and shows they care about their customers! I'm not sure which waiters the other reviews are speaking of but I've never had an issue with the service. 

Their food is good but not the best Thai food I've ever tasted. I usually order their Pad Thai (Chicken), Yellow Curry, or Spicy Basil Leaf (Beef). However they are nice and I would continue to come here for lunch breaks.

The red curry with tofu was so delicious. Lots of flavor and spice. The green curry, chicken chili mint and pad thai are also fantastic. Try the lemon thai iced tea. Refreshing and yummy. It comes with lemon and without condensed milk. I get it every time.

A big plus for me is the offering of brown instead of white rice. And their brown rice is cooked perfectly with a little black rice also mixed in.

I hadn't eaten all day. 

I had tom kha gai, it was excellent, very flavorful. I ordered it 5/10 hotness because I wanted something sweeter to start with. The egg roll and crab puff were standard, but the mee krob was a nice touch. The choices for the main dish were a little limited, do I chose red curry, 8/10 hotness. The waitress smiled and asked if I was sure I wanted it that hot. Yep, I did. 

The curry was delicious. It was spicy, but not south to take away the flavor. The waitress came back to check on me and asked if I was ok, I assured her I was. Washed it down with a this iced tea.

Red Curry Chicken - (set at a spicy 5 for my colleague) It was good and enjoyed it quite a bit.

This place is somewhat near me and had decent reviews, so I tried it out for a weekend to-go lunch.  I ordered the tofu pad Thai spicy 3 (their scale is 1-10) over the phone and the lady said, ""It will be ready in 5 minutes.""

Eep!  I had to throw on some pants and leave because the drive is a little bit longer than that.  Certainly not the worst problem in the world, though.

The location is easy-to-find and I parked right in the front.  The restaurant itself is nice and spacious, clean and overall a nice atmosphere.  I saw my order was right on the counter, so I paid with the friendly lady and left.

The tofu is certainly superior to Siri Thai but I think it's still lacking a little bit of that tofu texture that I personally enjoy.  The pad Thai was lacking peanuts but the overall flavor was good and the heat was there but certainly not overwhelming - exactly what I wanted.  There was a bit of a citrus flavor that I simply don't like with my pad Thai, but it was much more subtle than other places I've tried.  Also, they were generous with egg and green onion which I love!

While I have not found my new pad Thai spot (damn you, Siri Thai), I think I have found a new place to put into my pickup regime.

Pineapple Duck Curry
Vegetable Fried rice (brown rice!)
Tom Yum soup
Panang Curry
Beef Lard Na

I agree the curry is watery but its THICK on flavor, veggies and meat which is preferable to the skimpy pieces here and there served at... other places. And besides, isn't that what the rice is for - to soak up all that spicy goodness?

The Tom Yum (spicy 4) is the most authentic and addictive in town; and again, full of meat and veggies.

Portions are GENEROUS for the aforementioned items; we receive so much fried rice that it lasts for not 1, not 2 but THREE meals!  I do think more noodles should be provided for the Lard Na but only because the gravy / meat / veggie portion is so generous (which is a good thing).

I am no stranger to settling for mediocre food at a moment of weakness onset by the growls of one's insides, however what was to be a quick bite at a unremarkable strip mall turned out to be a pleasant surprise!  It seems nowadays if an Asian restaurant can pull off a half way decent ""orange-Meat o'choice"" dish  that they can float by in the world of economic Asian cuisine. I exhaustively disagree (despite how much I may love crunchy deep fried tidbits of meat drowned in sticky sweet sauce) and Sakun Thai is a perfect example of what I would like to expect from such a restaurant. 

The food was flavorful and packed with great fresh ingredients. I was most surprised by the Hot and Sour soup which was full of great bits of vegetables, mushrooms, and a small kick of chili heat. There's some love that went into making the soup and you can taste it! I was in for lunch so the rest of the lunch special came with an egg roll and crispy wonton which were nothing to ""Yelp"" about, however the red curry was exactly what I hoped for. Nothing fancy, just done right, with the heat level I asked for. The red curry primarily contained chicken and bamboo shoots which I ate over rice and enjoyed thoroughly. 

If you are looking for casual Asian dining, friendly service, good prices (between $6-10/per person), and most importantly flavorful food, check out Sakun Thai.",zOD4z50ZAqceeJMpqiwZDw,2,2,4,hezWNFUmQWG6ZatmAJi_xQ

I ordered the chicken Pad Thai lunch special (only $6.50) comes with soup and spring roll. 

Pad Thai- very flavorful with lots of sauce. I enjoyed it and was very pleased. I can't really complain, except that I thought it was a little more saucy than I'm use to. However, I think that's the real way it's suppose to be.

Well, we did not know it was the grand reopening and just decided to stop by for an inexpensive, unassuming V-day dinner with the little one. They've expanded the dining room a little into the neighboring space and got new booths, so that's a plus, but overall, the decor is about the same as it was.
The food was still good and we went out on a limb for Thai pork sausage this time. It was a little spicy and served with ginger, peanuts, and lettuce for creating a little wrap, but the meat was a little fatty for me (but then, I find most sausage a little too fatty). My husband and daughter loved it, however, so feel free to try if you're into sausage. 
The service was friendly, but otherwise horrible. After taking our orders, a different waitress came back almost 10 minutes later to explain that they were not doing dinner specials tonight, but did we still want the same thing as entrees. Fine, yes. It took another 10 minutes to get our appetizers, but at least we had some food. It took another 15 minutes to get our entrees and even then, they only brought 2 of the 3 things we ordered. We ate those 2 for about 15 minutes before asking for the check. When the check came, I told the waitress that we never received the pad thai and could she please take it off. She passed it off to another waitress who came back a couple minutes later, saying the pad thai just came out. Um, you were really going to serve my entree over 20 minutes after my husband already got his?
I'm giving them a break on the service just this once, since it was their opening night and they seemed to have some kind of buffet set up for a large private party.
Prices are cheap (~$11 for the dinner special, if you can get it, which includes soup, rice, crab rangoon, and egg roll) and even cheaper at lunch.
The highlight of the night was the Thai karaoke that was going on when we got there, complete with disco lights on the ceiling, and was soon followed by A THAI ELVIS IMPERSONATOR! Oh yes! He played basically the entire time we were there, and our daughter got out on the little dance floor to join a couple other kids who were shaking it to ""I Can't Help Falling in Love With You."" 
So even though I think an unassuming thai meal like this one should take about 30 minutes to order, get the food, and eat (ours was almost 90!), I can't help but give bonus points to a place with live music, LET ALONE an Elvis impersonator.",YIMeEHUYm69m-Mqf-NjPHw,0,0,3,FQApd1NuXUDU511Hc0_F9A

The verdict? It was pretty good. I am constantly searching for Panang in Vegas that comes even close to Archi's Thai Kitchen. I have yet to find it. Still, Sakun Thai is a good find. It's close to work and serves up good Thai food (based on my heretofore one dish experience).

I have recently been trying Vietnamese and Thai food, which I generally don't eat very much of even though I have traveled to these countries and been around the food.

For Thai food, I liked this place and will go back for sure.

1.  Ambiance - Odd, small strip mall, easy parking.  Inside, many tables and plenty of seating options. Typical chair and table or booth setting.  Very basic clean and utilitarian setting. 

2.  Service - We went at 11:30 and there were not too many people. Staff was friendly and super attentive.   Ready to give us recommendations or suggestions as we are still quite the novice.

3.  Food

Tom Yam Soup (Seafood) - Ordered 5/10 spicy and it had a very nice kick.  Plenty of shrimp and the flavor was very subtle.

Penang Curry (Chicken) - Ordered 8 / 10 spicy.  Very nice, flavorful and doesn't burn the mouth. This was very enjoyable.

Pad Thai (Chicken) Ordered 5/10 spicy and it was just right mix as some of our dining colleagues do not enjoy too much spice.

Eggplant (Ground Pork)  - Ordered 5/10 spicy.  The eggplant is not something I normally order, yet it was very tender, very nice texture and ordering ground pork on it instead of sliced beef or etc makes it just right.

Rice - We ordered regular rice since the sauces seem to get absorbed by the rice anyway, and it doesn't seem right to use Fried Rice to absorb the other flavors. Decent portions and they give you more if you ask.

Not much to look at, definitely hole in the wall in an old shopping center, but very solid offerings. Best hole in the walls are like that though- no ambiance, but c'mon it's about the food. 

BF wanted his favorite ground chicken with thai basil. I saw a special on the board that made me happy- smoked milkfish with a mango salad. His Thai Basil was yummy, but this was all about the fish for me that day. That was a might tasty special with a nice blend of the smokey taste to the fish with the fresh sour, sweet of the mango salad. MMM loved every bit and it was a big fish so I had some leftover for lunch. I don't see this on other Thai restaurants menu and would love to come back when they have this. It's very similar to something Filipinos normally eat except the smoked fish is also fried up to a crisp. 

We have also stopped in for takeout and have gotten delivery at my BF's friends place. Gotten eggrolls, satay, more chicken thai basil, chicken panang, pad see ew and everything has been delicious.

The restaurant is spacious and clean, but definitely not fancy. I would not advise bringing someone you are looking to impress here largely because the environs are sparse. 

I am sad to say that the curries were disappointing. I ordered the massaman, and my husband went with the panang. Both were on the watery side, and the flavors were thin too. Specifically, my massaman, which in my past experience has been a sweeter curry, was very sour and did not have the rich complexity that I savor in an ideal massaman. The panang was pretty standard. The menu indicates that the panang comes without vegetables, and it lived up to its description. The curry was literally tofu cubes in a thin curry with 4 thin slices of red pepper on top. I have never seen a curry without a speck of vegetables. Their spice level is on an American scale, so don't be scared of the spice! Go for 8.

Perhaps the menu shines in other areas, but I wouldn't head back for curry. Based on my experience, I suggest trying their specials, something besides their curry.",qewG3X2O4X6JKskxyyqFwQ,13,4,2,q8X4zugpQCINbKDXaMeaew

So we decided to order delivery at work the other day... We finally got everyone's order together and called it in. They said it would be 45 minutes. After an hour and we hadn't received it we called to see what was going on. The lady that answered said the driver left 5 minutes ago. Being that this place is right down the street we didn't mind. Another 30 minutes later the driver shows up. He brought us free egg rolls for the wait. Confused as to how he knew to bring egg rolls if he had already left ""5 minutes ago"". But that isn't the worst part...

Didn't bring us chopsticks... Still not even close to the worst part.

Didn't realize until he left and we were able to unpack everything that one of the curry containers was completely crushed/severed and the contents were all at the bottom of the bag. For real? And our coconut ice cream was completely a melted puddle. Sigh. We called and the lady was extremely nice and asked if we wanted a refund. We didn't want money... We wanted food. They promptly replaced the mangled items but at this point it has been over two hours and a lot of our work time wasted dealing with it which our boss wasn't so thrilled about.

But the food was actually pretty good. That is why I am sad to leave this review. I'm a panang freak and it was solid! Although a bit light on the protein and veggies the sauce itself was delicious. As was the pad Thai and eggplant salad. Only thing is that I don't think Thai places believe us when we ask for it hot. We ask for max heat on the panang and it barely made my nose run. Coworker got the Orange chicken and he said it was really dry. Girl that had the curry mishap said her replacement was really good though.

We will probably give them another chance though because sometimes the universe is out of alignment and things happen. Because they were so apologetic and the food was pretty good by the time we finally got it they deserve another chance.",BbwldZQM1i89cAvV7fce3A,6,3,2,Or2ud8hbFrroUhPG2GehHA

Saturday afternoon and there was no one in the place.  We sat ourselves at a booth - we were quickly greeted and were given water.  We ordered pork larb, panaang curry and pad se ew, we also ordered a side of sticky rice - all came out to $32.  Kinda pricey for a whole in the wall restaurant but food was good.  Portion size could have been a little better.  Gonna try again soon to have lunch special as it seems like a better deal (but only M-F).",zzPvEodjvLPe-5NvV0U_cg,0,0,4,un8B_PoNqRYjl6kMuWnQcA

I usually get the spicy pork fried rice, spicy catfish and the Mongolian beef! Very tasty, spicy enough and very filling. Lunch specials are worth it as well and usually get a curry, with soup and egg rolls. Highly recommend it for lunch. :)",F6bfLeuvoBu35rWMoFybMw,0,0,4,WuYYqRQ1qU2A8BJfHm7Elw

I ordered Tofu Pad See Ew with extra chinese broccoli. It was good but just a tad too sweet.

Co-workers ordered lunch pad thai (which I was surprised at how much I enjoyed this because I usually don't like pad thai) and I really enjoyed the purple rice she opted to have. Good flavor and cooked perfectly. For the price and everything that came with it, it's a killer deal.

Sad to know they'll be doing renovations for the next month and I won't be able to eat there, but it's good to hear they're expanding! Must mean the business and the food is good! A must try!",Sjqmb8QItFE4u7CYg_3mqA,0,0,4,aPnrVYW2afd5loFIdQgHdg

5538149,2012-05-19,0,7FLHJMOYszFPCqK3tg5umA,"This was my first experience with Thai food and I have to say I am very disappointed. 

Originally I had high hopes since the decor was very airy and light and there was a lot of customers. 

The soup was not bad. It had a bit too much MSG and included store-bought frozen wontons but the taste was A-OK. 

However, the curry itself was too watery and extremely sweet. The amount of meat to vegetables was very disproportionate as well (however, their portions for the curry itself is very generous). I expected something much more richer and filling but I could barely get through my dish. The rice was a highlight. Nicely cooked but they do not give enough for a normal meal.

Overall this does not make me want to come back or try another Thai restaurant any time soon.",J_EMXdUyYpODccMTh7G_7Q,0,0,2,vSejKgFfmOirfHf1u9JQFg

Las Vegas has many Thai Restaurants but you won't always find Thai cooks in the back, or even cooks that are any good.

Sakun Thai is authentic Thai Food.   It's as good if not better than the many restaurants I visit on a daily basis in Bangkok.  If you want to try REAL Thai food,  with exceptionally friendly staff,  go to Sakun Thai.

They can serve some dishes not so spicy, but remember,  Thai food is best served when spicy.   So grow a pair, and sweat a little :)",Cs_syt7ksaQq_6zG_cLyYg,2,1,5,xNZumJY2ZmrCH_5bFZdbUQ

5843256,2013-12-12,14,7FLHJMOYszFPCqK3tg5umA,"Thai food is one of my favorite cuisines. And whenever possible, I try to find a good one wherever I go. 

I have to say, my wife found this place. She told me it had four stars and a lot of reviews, I was sold.

Here's the rundown. 
Tom Yum Shrimp - it was a super cold day again, so a hot soup was the perfect remedy for that. Love this soup. I was  craving the sourness from the lemongrass flavored soup. The mushrooms & shrimp were very good. But what set this Tom Yum from the others I've had was the cherry tomato. Never had that in this soup before and it worked so well. The pop in your mouth was a flavor explosion, delicious. 

Satay Chicken - it was just okay. It was lacking in flavor IMO. Even with the satay sauce. The cucumber salad it came with was outstanding. 

Lemon Chicken - I never had lemon chicken at a Thai place before. Usually I find this dish at a Chinese restaurant. But I have to say, I am a fan of this dish. The lemon flavor really stands up to the deep fried battered chicken the sauce was in. 

Panang Pork - I usually get Panang beef. Having pork even though it was very good. I still prefer the beef. The panang curry was outstanding. 

Pineapple Fried Rice - it was good. Chunks of pineapple and cashew nut pieces all over the dish. As for the flavor, it was just ok for me. 

Pad See Ew - my wife's favorite Thai noodle dish. It's a good dish, but it didn't have the burnt wok (in a good way) taste we are accustomed to at our regular Thai spot. Still very good. 

I love spicy food, but on this trip we have a bunch of kids so the heat index was dialed down quite a bit. The pickled serrano chilies help a lot. You can request it and they have them in tiny cups to go. 

This was a solid Thai restaurant. I'm rating this a 3.5 Stars and rounding up. 

I'll definitely be back.",R_xjmz2nZgyOkqFKPmkjnA,16,17,4,yWTX5hHI_zQ6PE-itQo-QQ

This is not my favorite Thai place in Las Vegas by a longshot, but they have solid dishes and considering how often I come here and leave feeling full and happy I think that's reason enough to give them another star. The service is solid and friendly and there are plenty of inexpensive lunch specials to keep me interested as well as a menu full of goodies. One of my favorite dishes to order here is the green curry with tofu or pork. It's flavorful and they always set the spice level exactly at what I order. Never intolerably spicy and never too bland. I have a number of other dishes from their menu and although some have been a miss, for the most part I enjoy just about everything I have tried, minus the bland soup they now serve instead of egg drop. One of my favorite things about this place is the Thai brown rice they serve instead of the regular brown most are used to. That is definitely a nice change of pace.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,3,2,4,AnpmgnLH5nxzh0HnmT9SHg
