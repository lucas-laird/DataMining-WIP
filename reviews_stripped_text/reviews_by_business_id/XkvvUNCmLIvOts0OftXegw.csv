They are a chain, and their locations in Rancho Santa Fe (SD), Palm Desert, Chicago, etc are all way more charming than this one.  That said, breakfast here is always consistently delicious and the service is great.  Their omelettes are fluffy and baked with the ingredients inside, almost like a souflee.  They do a great dutch baby, german apple pancake, and a dutch garden (dutch baby topped with veggies and cheese).  Their pancakes are my favorite- thin and flavorful, you can smell the buttermilk.  They come in every flavor, including seasonal pumpkin (amazing!) and fresh strawberry with whipped cream (during summer months, with fresh not canned whipped cream).  They also have classics like eggs benedict, corned beef hash, and amazing swedish pancakes (thin like crepes).  They also have a location in GVR that is newly expanded, for people on the Henderson side of town.",dEgO4_n8thLMbG1dKfFMHg,3,1,4,Qy2hvB_xQ0dFUYYZA7la4Q

180676,2014-04-04,2,XkvvUNCmLIvOts0OftXegw,"Our waitress was a superstar,  older woman and so friendly and attentive to our needs even anticipated our needs having our grand daughter there.  OPH was my first job in mid 70's actually inspiring me to become a chef and restaurateur.  My main job was preparing the famous corned beef hash in the Hawaii locations. Since then,  I've always made OHP my home and boasted on their food and quality especially since I've lived in Portland,  OR where the original location and family resides boasting the famous passed down starter cultures that make up my beloved Dutch Baby. So one thing I know and know well is OPH food especially the corned beef that I've made all my life. 

2 stars are for my waitress and her service which if yelp broke the ratings in categories I'd give her 5 stars and hire her any day in any if my restaurants. 

Now to the food.  It just sucked period! The Dutch baby was so flat and pancakes were soured only meaning they don't follow protocols for the starters and batter was old and not kept refrigerated causing it to sour. My so called corned beef was a blatant ripoff, they tried to pass off their older ham chopped up and with onions all fluffy and they couldn't make hash with ham because it comes out like fluffy hamburger.  Even waitress said others complained the same thing.  Don't take my word for it, see for yourself,  all I ask is you know what corned beef is and eaten at other locations besides vegas. They are cutting corners to save on food costs and waste. Shame on you!!!!!

My concerns and disappointment was addressed with the manager or owner,  the older gentleman but he denied my findings as a professional chef and was extremely rude even though I was being courteous.  This leads me to believe that the cooks run the place without challenge or proper management.  I will forward my findings to Portland along with the pictures of the fake corned beef.  I did pay for everything and never asked for a discount or any refunds.  It's just a crime what they're doing to such a wonderful franchise and food concept. 

Change management and food and maybe we won't lose our last OPH in Vegas.",SSKpNy9JMH09UXsdGcOz8Q,10,1,2,0hA-N-Nc_DY5iXPGAtLFsA
190009,2011-01-18,0,XkvvUNCmLIvOts0OftXegw,"We won't be going again.

I was really craving the Dutch Baby - which is stellar, and I decided to treat my two boys to breakfast there yesterday morning.

The service was good.  We were seated right away, and our waitress was spot on, as far as service goes.

My oldest son requires gluten-free food.  Normally, for breakfast, this is never an issue.  Eggs, bacon and potatoes are easy, and he loves them.

Both of my sons ordered the bacon and eggs for breakfast, and both asked to substitute the 3 pancakes for the potatoes.  She said SURE!  Guess what?  Not only was the serving of potatoes huge (they could have easily split one - a really good waitress would have suggested this) - but it was a $3 UPCHARGE for each order of potatoes!  Because potatoes are SO MUCH MORE expensive than pancakes?  WHAT?  Ridiculous!  AND - we weren't told about the upcharge!  Since a stack of 6 pancakes is $6, and potatoes are $3, I assumed this would be a wash.  It was not.  Insane!  The eggs were fine - but all of the bacon was completely overdone - crispy and border-line burnt.

My Dutch Baby was stellar, I loved it.  It normally comes with strawberries, but they are out of season (and I understand this) and I was offered bacon.  Not only was the bacon overdone, I was charged $6 for it.  

Breakfast for me, and for 2 little boys, totaled $49.98.  Besides my Dutch Baby, the food was mediocre, at best.  And the best?  We got home and my son had obviously been ""glutened"".  He suffered an adverse reaction immediately.  

Never again.  I'll figure out how to make Dutch Babies myself!",SnJtzOlG9cbjmfI27nJjiw,6,0,1,TfcXZKzqy4_bwWDqpE_1zA

I'm a local and have stayed away from here for awhile due to a few previous bad experiences and not because the food is bad.  I have stayed away because the service is not great.  I tried again yesterday a Tuesday mid morning (not a busy time) because you can't touch the place on a weekend without a major wait.  I had a party of 4.  We walked in with a party of 2 right in front of us.  No hostess at hostess stand.  Waited behind that party for 3min.  When it got to us the two girls behind the counter, not the stand, fumbled around and did not acknowledge us.  There was never a formal good morning or welcome...Finally 3min later she says will a table work and we said that's fine... She starts walking us to the table and we see 2 booths open.  We ask for a booth and she says, ""that waitress is over sat,"" so no, we can't have a booth... Really?  The waitress is more important than your customers? Ok... She did give us the option to wait for a booth... Lol how nice! So we sit at our table and wait and wait and wait... No drinks, No acknowledgement, No Nothing!  10 minutes!  So we got up and walked out... No one stopped us... Sad to say this is not the first time this has happened.  BEWARE: They will not seat incomplete parties,  they have no kids meals, the prices are inflated, everything is an add on and you will be lucky to get a max of 2 cups of coffee.  They run there waitresses ragged and they are usually frazzled...  They could make a few minor corrections to be better with service but ultimately over the years they have been more worried about the bottom line, then the customer.  The food is usually good, so that's the trade off.  I'm not willing to make the trade anymore.  They have lost a customer.  It takes a lot for me to walk away from a local establishment, but I have never got a warm fuzzy feeling at this restaurant.

532811,2012-01-07,0,XkvvUNCmLIvOts0OftXegw,"I have been to the Original Pancake house several times. I have to say that I think it is a step above IHOP and Denny's.

This visit I decided to do lunch. I had a grilled ham and cheese on sourdough with hash browns. The flavor of my ham and cheese was as good as can be expected. The ham had flavor, as some time ham does no have much. And the cheese was tasty as well. It was cooked properly and I enjoyed it very much. I was a bit disappointed with the hash browns this time. Not the flavor. That was great. This time I was disappointed with the serving size. Usually when I order the hash browns I get about three quarters of a cup. This time it was just a bit over a quarter of a cup.

My wife ordered french toast and bacon. I had a piece of her bacon. It was thick and tasty and cooked just right. TOPH does have a tenancy to overcook their bacon, but not this time.

I was very surprised this time on the time it took to get our order. We usually wait twenty to thirty minutes to get our food, but this time it less than ten minutes. I was pleasantly surprised.

One last thing to point out is our service. Our server was great. She was by to check on us so ofter. We were never out of coffee or soda. I am a real stickler when it comes to service. This was some of the best/",I8_iXLcpYHAb_xi2vShgOg,0,0,3,KWcMBtsV04zzjXn8G6gV_g

When this location first opened the food was fantastic and there would always be people waiting to get in.   The food has clearly gone downhill.  Each of the orders included pancakes.   The syrup was so thin it was like pouring water. We requested replacement of the syrup to a thicker one.   Our waitress brought replacement syrup.   It too was runny.   Clearly it was watered down.  This restaurant is obviously cutting corners.    There were only a few people in the restaurant even though it was prime breakfast time.   The other disappointment was we had a restaurant.com coupon and when we tried to use it we were told that they did not renew their agreement with restaurant.com.   I explained that the coupons do not expire.   I was told they would not accept it.   Called restaurant.com when I got home and they said restaurants have to accept them even if they do not renew contract.

I do not usually enjoy eggs unless they are made by mom and at Original Pancake House i enjoy having them.

And it was worth the drive to get one of my favorite breakfast dishes ever: Eggs Michael.

We both love Eggs Michael, so that's what we both ordered. It's basically Eggs Benedict, but swap in sausage instead of Canadian bacon and mushroom gravy instead of Hollandaise sauce. And, oh, that gravy! Creamy with a slight hint of sherry. It's so good that we always ask for an extra bowl on the side. This time, they just poured a double batch over each of our orders. Still love that gravy, but for some reason the mushrooms seemed a little slimy. Not sure if they were canned or just overcooked, but that's the only reason I can't give this dish five stars.

Our server was super friendly but a little slow on the drink refills. And, as I said, it was a bit of a drive for breakfast.

I've been to other Original Pancake House's in the past. Some items I really didn't like. Others, I thought were pretty good. On my most recent trip, I do believe in saying that, overall, this place makes some pretty good food for the price point.

A few years ago, I went to a different OPH and ordered their signature item, the baked apple pancake. Honestly, while the presentation of the beast was truly amazing, the taste just didn't do it for me. It's not that it tasted bad in any way, but after a few bites, I was done. It was too rich and heavy for my taste buds. I then went to another one and tried their (non-baked) german potato pancakes, and I enjoyed the crispiness of the outer edges of the pancake, and the soft middle. The sour cream and applesauce really heightened the flavor, and it was something I liked.

Now, here is shot #3. This time I ordered the Eggs Michael, because i'm Michael, and I like eggs. This was basically an eggs benedict, but with a sherry mornay sauce instead of the hollandaise, and sausage instead of the ham/bacon. The eggs were poached perfectly, the sherry mornay was nicely made, and the sausage was flavorful. I did think the english muffin was a bit tough, but not that bad. It came with a side of the german potato pancakes that I liked.

I also ordered blueberry pancakes. I'm not a big fan of regular pancakes except for Dupar's, but I wanted to give it a shot. The blueberries complimented the soft, delicate pancake wonderfully, and the side of blueberries to put on top of the pancake was a nice touch. The pancake was light, soft, not tough or chewy, and it wasn't too sweet. This is probably my second favorite pancake after Dupar's.

I would definitely come here again. I think the prices are right on the money, and the quality is pretty good. I'm not a fan of their baked pancakes because they are just too much for me, but i'll happily try any of their other items.",gtwM4ijo65AN4DvXdgCu_w,4,4,4,DqyFybI3GZBx3TTa00B_fQ

Firstly, I really dislike when places serve a single waffle as a breakfast meal. Who in the flip eats just a waffle? No bacon. No eggs. Just one single waffle. Everything on their a la carte menu was insanely priced, too. We'd have been better off just going to dine on the strip! 

So I ended up ordering the waffle and another meal, the traditional, that included the eggs, potatoes and sausage (or choice of bacon) that I wanted. 

The waffle came on a plate, by itself, no powdered sugar or anything. Sorry if I am a bit repetitive, I order waffles at breakfast establishments often and I've never seen such a bland looking waffle, LOL. The traditional meal was alright. Eggs, sausage and toast you can't really screw up too bad. Everything was cooked how it should've been. I will note that they don't really try anything clever on their menu. The potatoes though... they were cooked ""German style"" which I had never really heard of. They were.. interesting. I do wish that they'd have been a little crisper... but they weren't all that bad in the end.

The restaurant is clean and comfortable. The atmosphere is pretty active, but they have booths lining the walls that give you a bit more shelter and privacy. During the winter, request a table away from the doorway as they are really busy and the door opening and closing creates a draft that isn't very pleasant. 

Anyway - we've gone to various Original Pancake houses for the last 8 years, and this one is our favorite. Their staff are consistently good at what they do, providing personal service and staying attentive, even when it is obvious that they are slammed. Some of our favorite servers are Yvette (who remembered our orders even if it was a month or two since our last visit!) and Dino, who was always helpful and great. 

The atmosphere and service provide the perfect foundation for the best basic, homemade breakfast food in the universe. Their menu is huge - loads of different pancake options, omelets, benedicts, waffles, french toast, and CREPES, plus some lunch stuff. I. LOVE. THEIR. CREPES. Seriously the only breakfast place I've been to that makes them so perfectly. Their strawberry crepes are good, but pretty sweet. I usually get the ""Shells"" which are their plain crepes with a little powdered sugar and then I get a side of strawberry syrup (which is not syrupy stickiness - it is a housemade fresh strawberry puree) SUPER GOOD. 

Other favorites are the 49er flapjacks, challah french toast, Strawberry Pancakes, Corned Beef Hash (served with poached eggs and dee-licious potato pancakes) even their basic scrambled eggs are incredibly tasty, as are their meats: sausage patties are flavorful and perfectly crispy, the bacon is thick cut and addictive.

I don't love their orange juice (too pulpy for me), their coffee is good and their hot cocoa is just the ticket on a cold day - they use milk instead of water and top it with thick, real whipped cream that is not out of a can ... can't get better than that! 

The prices are higher than a fast food place but cheaper than the strip. 

I've been to lots of Original Pancake locations- 4 or 5 in California, 2 in Wisconsin, 1 in Florida, 1 in Arizona, and all of the Las Vegas locations are THE. BEST. The Freudenberger group runs the Las Vegas franchises and they do a top notch job without all of the weird idiosyncrasies that many of the other locations seem to have.

I'm so sad that I'm 6 hours away from my favorite breakfast spot. I would eat at the Original Pancake every day if I could.

2073782,2014-09-13,0,XkvvUNCmLIvOts0OftXegw,"We came here on a $20 Groupon today at about 1pm.  It was super empty, which is unusual for any OPH we've ever been to, even this late in the day.  

We ordered a Dutch panacake, and spinach omelet with cheddar and gouda and substituted the pancakes that came with it with wheat toast.  With that we ordered a side of bacon and coffee.

The coffee was not the smooth coffee we've normally had at OPH in San Diego.  I had to add a lot of cream and sugar and it was still bitter.  

We ordered the Dutch Pancake while we looked over the menu.  It normally takes a while to cook.  When it arrived it was deflated and looked like yesterday's leftover pancake.  We asked the server if that is normally how they come out and she said normally they have higher walls and look much better and she had no idea what happened to this one.  Why she would serve it then, we have no idea.  So she said she would have them make another one.  Well if it's going to take another 15 minutes and the rest of the food was already here, we didn't want her to take the deflated one while we waited for the replacement one.  So she said she would have them cook the smaller Dutch Baby instead of the regular one.  So that was disappointing.

My spinach and cheese crepe was super good, and very flavorful - maybe a little on the salty side.  It had tons of cheddar cheese inside and the gouda must have been what was toasted on top. It was full of spinach too.  I was quite happy with it. Although, it would have been nice if the server had mentioned that they couldn't do a blend of cheddar/gouda, and that she was going to charge for extra cheese.  But overall I was happy with the omelet.

The bacon was awesome as always.  I asked them to under-cook and it was just the way I wanted it.

Our total bill came to $33.67, which is a bit pricey.  I'm glad we had our $20 Groupon, although it wasn't really all that much of a savings since I paid $10 for it.  We'll still come back.  We love Original Pancake House in general and were excited to find one in Vegas.

We saw them bring an Apple pancake to the table next to us and it looked really good.  So I think we'll try that on our next visit.",xSEq2xfH49G1Bal_Qtb-yQ,1,0,3,U71xWV8q3zAL-KNzsv8x0Q

There is only one reason to come here and that's the giant apple pancake. I'm going to take a few minutes to wax poetic about the giant apple pancake. 

It's not so much a pancake but a poor man's form of tarte tatin aux pommes (or a french word upside down apple tart - essentially).  I swear, when anyone orders this, the aroma of apple and cinnamon surrounds at least a radius of two tables. 

The bottom layer is crisp from being finished in the oven. The middle layers of the pancake takes on a rich, eggy, bread-custard-like quality. This is all topped with apples carmelized with brown sugar and plenty of cinnamon. 

This is not that crappy overly sweet pre-made apple topping you see at a buffet. No - you can still see the bits of peel from the apple - this is the real thing. The pancake fills the plate and is often too hard to finish alone.

Oh yeah, baby. This  is da bomb - and all under $10.

My hubby ordered an omelette which was bleh but the regular pancakes were pretty good. He also ordered a very small glass of juice (cranberry) which didn't seem like a very good deal (at  the supermarket you can buy an entire jug for that price!).

We stopped in this past weekend and had a feast that carried us through the rest of the day. Every time we come in, I ALWAYS order the orange juice and finally noticed the price today, nearly $5! Okay, the orange juice is definitely the most delicious orange juice I've had, but for $5, I can buy myself a bag of oranges and make 3 cups of orange juice. 

We ordered a vegetarian omelet with Gouda and it is SO good!!! I always get this every time I come and can easily share this with my husband and still be super full. It has mushrooms, tomatoes, broccoli, onions, and peppers (I think) and delicious melty Gouda all over it. The best part is probably the hardened cheesy crust on top that contrasts with the soft fluffy omelet containing all those fresh veggies inside. This came with a side of pancakes which is a given to be decent since pancake is in the name. 

My husband ordered chocolate crepes which has yummy crepe batter surrounding chocolate, strawberries, and a mound of whipped cream on top. I'm not a sweet breakfast person, but if you are, this is bliss. We packed this to go and was still delicious at 10PM. 

Lastly, I always order potato pancakes which are like hash browns in pancake form. They're usually really crispy on the outside and softer on the inside but the ones I got were all a bit soggy and unseasoned this time around. If you order these, make sure to get the sour cream! It sounds weird, but it's so delicious. 

So, even though my potato pancakes weren't as perfect as usual, this will always be my go-to breakfast place on days when I don't want to cook breakfast, lunch, or dinner!",EKEtbkIswDNQqxcy8vy8Kw,1,1,4,v5qHg48P7LU2HnGW_Fs_5A

The way they're made at IHOP is the way they should be made, and they're moist.  Here, they're served flat, unrolled and they were kinda dry.  That's where the 4 stars come in.

3993301,2014-01-19,1,XkvvUNCmLIvOts0OftXegw,"I came here for the apple pancakes everyone was raving about. 

They are good, I will readily admit that. For about $12 bucks a large, an approximately 1 foot diameter pancake covered with warm granny smith apples and drowning in cinnamon syrup is placed in front of you. The pancake itself is dense and moist, some areas have a crispy crust due to how it is prepared. It is still hot when served so you do have to be careful when eating. If I had to nitpick their signature dish, I think it would have been better with the syrup on the side, so if you didn't want it so sweet you just use a little less syrup.

The service is what brought the rating down. Although my server was great, the hostess and cashier were definitely not happy to be there. When I first walked into the restaurant, the glare the cashier gave me knocked my back a bit. No greeting, just a stink eye. Then the hostess walks over, I guess she was mad I made her work since I didn't get a greeting from her either. Even though there were plenty of tables and booths available, she seated me in the middle of the room. 

If you are craving a specialty pancake, like german or apple, then definitely give the pancake house a try. Just be prepared to suffer the wrath of the cashier and hostess.

4006013,2015-08-31,4,XkvvUNCmLIvOts0OftXegw,"Original Pancake House used to be my favorite breakfast spot. Ever since my go-to Original Pancake House location by Decatur and Charleston got destroyed by a fire,I have been visiting this location. The quality of their food is going down and I am disappointed with how inconsistent they have been.

AMBIANCE
If you were lucky enough to have visited the other location on Decatur before it got destroyed, you know how great the ambiance was. It was much spacious and multiple windows that brought all the sunlight in made it a perfect spot to enjoy your warm and fluffy pancakes.

This location is complete opposite. It is crowded and super loud. I feel like there's too many people in there...not enough oxygen. I feel sick and overwhelmed when I'm here.

SERVICE
Typically quick and friendly. There is one server named Jesse who is my absolute favorite server. He has the best smile that is brighter than a sunshine and I always feel welcomed there whenever I see him.

FOOD
It has definitely gone downhill. My usual is there chocolate crepe. It's a crepe with chocolate cream inside, topped with chocolate sauce, fresh whipped cream and fruits which changes with season. It's usually strawberry because they stock so much of strawberry but I've gotten bananas few times. 

I noticed this place is very inconsistent. Sometimes my chocolate crepe comes out perfect as it could be, at times it is soggy like it was drenched in water. On my recent visit, it was cold and dry. Please, Original Pancake House, get it together.

My family always gets their pancake and they claim the pancake here has gotten dry and not as good as it used to be. Disappointment is real. 

CONCLUSION
They do have rushes but usually quick to get you to a table. Food has gone downhill but reasonable price and attentive servers. I recommend Jamms Restaurant over this place.",mEzc6LeTNiQgIVsq3poMbg,5,3,3,NOObbaQqusCYTzuCRCjxOw

1. Eggs Michael/Venetia/Benedict: I prefer this over the Eggs Benedict because the sauce is lighter and it doesn't make me nauseous. 2 english muffins and 4 potato pancakes with a side of sour cream and apple sauce. The potato pancakes are winners but to be fair, I haven't had potato pancakes anywhere else for comparison. As far as I know, these are made well.

The Venetia comes with spinach if I remember correctly and it's lighter than the Michael. The spinach is starchier than usual and makes your teeth waxy but still delicious.

2. Corned Hash. Really good corned beef with eggs and potatoes. It's a bit too salty for me but the potato pancakes that come with it are a good balance.

3. Dutch Baby. IT'S HUGE. So huge that the two of us (growing guys) couldn't tackle it all. Beware the Dutch Baby. Delicious and worth a try.

4. Any of their omelets ARE HUGE HUGE. I swear they must use 10 eggs each or something. My aunt's husband ordered one and it was bigger than a newborn. I haven't ordered an omelet from them since so you'll need to confirm that.

We waited about 20 minutes for our orders, which isn't anything out of the ordinary for this place. The food came out piping hot. Sadly, I was super dissapointed with the omelette. It lacked flavor and I was forced to douse it in salt and ketchup. Additionally, it was incredibly fluffy, so although it looked GIGANTIC, it wasn't at all filling. Also, since I asked for light cheese, the cheese was all in one clump only on one side of the omelette..inside of it. So, I had an entire omelette with no cheese, and then about 4 giant bites of cheese.

The hash browns were not hash browns at all. They were potatoes. I don't remember seeing this on the menu, but it certainly wasn't explained. I'm sure they were ""German potatoes,"" but that wasn't what I wanted. 

I will come back here to give this place another chance, but probably not anytime soon.",tnSVm_tdM5zthKgmGF5d1A,1,0,3,_UTt8GenWmIUSA6KQUOriw

4506554,2010-02-12,1,XkvvUNCmLIvOts0OftXegw,"My youngest son's future Father-In-Law had Breakfast at this Original Pancake House location yesterday... the very first time I've been to an OPH, even when I was living here... I was just shaking with anticipation of a great Breakfast.

On the menu...

Irish Corned Beef Hash (***) A Homemade Hash, with a blend of Kosher Corned Beef, Potatoes, Onions and Cream. This entree, under the category ""Specialties of the House"" should have been rated under two-Stars, but because of it's heftiness the concoction provides a Value deserving of something a litte higher. All the ""Specialties"" are Oven-Baked... I asked the waitress what is the difference between an Oven-Baked entree versus something you just grill in a Frying Pan... 

She replied that this was actually her fist week... and that she'd get back to me...  

Otherwise, this is a rather pedestrian and a very bland ""Specialty"" entree... The concoction was pretty high... over three inches, but not because of it's fluffiness.... but rather because of all it's ingredients literally piled on top of each other

I later found out, with the help of my son, that Oven Baking this entree supposedly provides a Fluffiness to the entree that Frying does not provide and supposedly the entree is NOT folded over as with traditional Omelets. But, he further added, that the Yolk of the Eggs are supposed to be separated from Whites and the ingredients are layered during the Oven Baking process.

BTW, all the Specialty items will require a close to 20 minute wait for your Entree... because of the Oven Baking...

Side Order of 3-Buttermilk Pancakes (* 1/2 Came with Meal) I always have to provide a rationale to my son about how I judge Pancakes, especially Flour based Pancakes.

 1) Fluffiness - You have two extremes under this category - The 
  Heavy-Ass Pancake - where it is sooo heavy that you have to go right 
  after your meal. And then there's the light-as-a-feather Pancake that 
  will have you consuming close to a dozen without any ill effects. 
  Unfortunately, OPH's Pancakes are the HEAVY kind...

 2) Absorption - Again, there are two extremes under this category... 
  Pancakes that seemingly act like a Sponge - no matter how much 
  Syrup you pour onto the Pancake... the Pancake still needs more 
  and more and more. And then there's the Pancakes the seeming are 
  resistant to Syrup (or any kind of liquid) - the Pancakes just will not 
  absorb Syrup, but you can sop up the Syrup with each fork-full.

OPH's Pacakes are the worst of the two qualities I mentioned above... HEAVY - and I mean H-E-A-V-Y... and no matter how much Syrup you put on... the Pancakes WILL still need more!

Coffee (***) The Best part of the meal, mainly because it was not objectionable. But the Coffee did not have any positive attributes either.

After talking to my youngest son about my experience at Original Pancake House yesterday, he said that this specific location was supposedly the worst OPH location in Las Vegas. I guess fate drove me here. BTW, my son is a fanatic about OPH... in a good way...",K5FrmVM70cJDbMiZ9ywMag,0,0,2,QuxF_lG76aBgWXTMMyB9oQ

-Their German pancakes are huge, fluffy, and perfect as they are.. yet somehow they manage to go an extra mile of awesome with the Dutch Garden!! A colorful mix of veggies with a healthy serving of Gouda cheese, baked to perfection on that yummy German pancake!
-The Venecia Benedict is my guilty pleasure.. I almost always order this, and never regret it even if I was teetering on another order. It has everything you need and want from breakfast. The best of breakfast vegetables (spinach and mushroom), thick crispy bacon, perfectly poached eggs with runny yolks, on top of a crunchy and chewy English muffin to sop up the creamy Hollandaise sauce!!
-Potato Pancakes ARE A MUST TRY!! With or without the traditional sour cream and applesauce, it's always a hit.
-Great Corn Beef and Hash!
-Giant delicious fluffy BAKED omelets! You can't go wrong with any of them (let alone anything on the menu)!
-The waffles are also everything you ever want Belgian Waffles to be! Fresh strawberry or blueberry waffles are my personal favorite. 
-Fresh squeezed juices, fresh whipped cream, homemade applesauce and blueberry compote, warmed honey, unforgettable potato pancakes and coffee good enough to take black. So many little things that make this place amazing.",QkRmh9oHRpb5wtYBCjAo6A,1,0,5,97lQJf2CY9_Vka6nKCkuhg

So the pancakes are filed with pineapple and dusted with powdered sugar, they're usually served with tropical syrup but their fresh made strawberry syrup is THE BOMB!

Their baked omelets rock on so many levels that my drumsticks caught fire. (ok, I guess that only makes sense if you know I play the drums, my husband laughed until he snorted) The Irish is my favorite (says the ginger) - their corned beef is incredible.

Best of show: Fresh squeezed grapefruit juice. Pulpy, wonderful yumminess. So sweet that it makes oranges blush. They have fresh squeezed orange juice, too. Haven't tried it, but I'm sure it, too, embarrasses a lesser citrus.

Pancakes come with everything you order. I've never made it to the pancake course - even though they do look amazing. I pack them up and donate them to someone more gluten tolerant. Typically, the benefactors eat them like cookies right from the box, foregoing butter, syrup, or utensils, so they must be good.

I did try the potato pancakes this last round. Light and crispy, they're served with fresh, chunky apple sauce and sour cream. Uh-may-zing. I could hurt myself on these.

I got the Venicia benedict which has ham, mushrooms, spinach and bacon. All the toppings were awesome and the eggs were perfectly poached and runny. The kicker is instead of breakfast potatoes, these come with potato pancakes! I love them and don't see them often enough of menus.

Who did they think they were feeding.  The omelette was HUGE. I am quite happy with a typical 3 egg omelete but this had to be a minimum of 6 eggs.  It was very yummy and loaded with lots of spinach and cheese.  I also LOVED the pancakes.  

The reason I didn't give it 4 stars is simple..  Breakfast was $11 + coffee  and I made this same comment about Big Bear Diner.... The portion was huge and yes it was good but it's NOT necessary.  I'd rather have a smaller/more regular portioned size omelette and have a choice of sausage or bacon served with it and hashbrowns and of course a small side order of pancakes for the same price.  I enjoy the basic variety/package that is common for breakfast.  Not just 1 huge main item and no side items.  

Would I go back, eh probably.. But for the same price I can get a good bkfst at ihop, dennys and blueberry hill and get a more varied bkfst.",9GyTNxzAN8UxpPPSTfei-A,3,0,3,9oEwawjv3DK0Xhnjg9kXYg

So, lets begin with how excited my husband and I were when we saw the groupon offer for this place, 50% off for some yummy breakfast......count us in! We arrive and are immediately seated, no wait at all. They were busy but not crazy like I remember the charleston location being. We were welcomed by our waiter taking our drink orders minutes after being seated....hey we're off to a great start. He comes back a few minutes later and we proceed to order. I order bacon, eggs with the side of pancakes. I ask if they can provide a side of salsa, he says sure for an extra dollar. Ummmm, come again? Now it's not that it's a lot of money, but were talking a small side of salsa here, needless to say I passed. My husband ordered (or at least attempted) the bacon waffles with strawberries. Our waiter, ""my apologies but we don't have any strawberries, they are still out of season and we have yet to receive our shipment."" Hmmmmm, that's pretty interesting cause I can pretty much guarantee I can drive over to albertsons across the street and they will have a plethora of fresh, ripe strawberries. In fact, I bought a bulk of them at Costco just a week or so ago for valentines day. Whatever. So my husband opts for the bacon waffles with blueberries. Now I don't know about y'all but I like fast, efficient service but this was almost frightening. We literally put in our order, and about 2 minutes later here comes our waiter with our breakfast. I said, "" wow! That was like the cooks could here us ordering and got on it before you even got back there to give them the ticket."" Well here's why...... Husbands waffles were NOT cooked all the way through. In fact you could taste the runny batter in your mouth as you took a bite. It was so disgusting. He was so turned off he took two bites and put it to the side. I felt so bad, I offered him my pancakes and some bacon. He took my pancakes and took a bite.....wow.....how do you screw up.......pancakes??? Your restaurant is supposed to be known for that very dish! I tore off a piece of pancake, I just wanted to see what he was talking about. Holy shit.....the pancakes tasted like the card board box I assume they came out of. We did not put any butter or syrup on the pancakes, in my humble opinion you should be able to eat a pancake without having to add all that sugar, to me the syrup and butter is just an added little pleasure. The pancake should still taste delicious without the sugar. My oh my....what a waste. I would have been a ton happier at Montana mining company, breakfast for 4.95. Bacon, eggs, potatoes and side of pancakes.....and it's yummy. Oh and they don't charge for salsa. I'll never go back to this place, ever.",ofiyrb5MRJQY3XJz6UDYnA,4,0,1,BxYXQONmjbCp51yPFdtvrw

The pancakes were very fluffy and hot it was so hot that as soon as I put the butter on it had melted and slid right off of the pancakes. I suggest during your visit you ask for the warm syrup that makes the pancakes go to a completely different level of fluffiness in your mouth. I also suggest that you get their hash browns and wait and take them home because eating them the day after makes it that much better.,yS1kK5EGcwatp6D6hFGvlw,0,0,4,5EL0pGyH9QhRNYeBLZ6j8g

Chocolate Chip Buttermilk Short Stack
Challah French Toast
Baked Apple Pancake

Technically a chain, with origins in Portland OR and the famous Walker Bros location in Wilmette IL, it was only when Groupon offered a discount that I realized Las Vegas even had an Original Pancake House and although I guess it could be said that the $8 discount was the impetus for my visit, in reality it was fond childhood memories that drew me through the doors.  Located on Fort Apache, and thus less than ten minutes from my door, it was after another long morning run that I arrived at the sizeable storefront and although the clock had just ticked past 7:15am I entered the restaurant to find the place already lively, a quartet of tables already seated while two couples before me checked in with a friendly hostess soon leading them to their seats.  Eventually finding my place at a booth best suited for four it was mere seconds before my server stopped by and with my order pre-decided based on past experience a simple request that plates arrive in two courses was granted, the long cooking time of the later assuring a fifteen minute delay between rounds.  Sipping on water as the restaurant continued to fill it would not be long before first plates arrived and although the restaurant's eponymous buttermilk batter was fluffy as ever beneath a mountain of whipped cream it was the house-baked challah that truly impressed, the exterior rendered crispy while the center was soaked in sweet custard playing counterpoint the rich egginess of soft bread.  Admittedly a substantial start, and nearly enough to use up my gift certificate, there was simply no way I was leaving Original Pancake House without ordering one of their signatures and this time opting for the Baked Apple Pancake over the Dutch Baby I'll simply say that one cannot go wrong with either, the piping hot pile of thinly sliced Granny Smith's teaming with cinnamon and sugar atop a buttery golden base proving as much a 'pie' as it does a pancake, but absolutely delicious regardless of what it is called.

Individually owned and operated but similar in menu from coast-to-coast there is simply 'something' about Original Pancake House that makes me smile - the service ever pleasant, the space always bustling, and the apple pancake always served so hot that you *know* the first bite is likely to end in a blistered mouth.  Obviously a bit more expensive than IHOP or Denny's but also using superior ingredients including 93-score butter, pure whipping cream, and free-range eggs it's good to know that every once in a while you can indeed find a taste of 'home,' even a thousand or more miles away.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,6,3,4,UAtFOQPBXeJSk8dvH2_F7A

The food quality is bad now. They have a menu item that has a bunch of bacon. The bacon used to be crispy and thick not it couldn't be more thin and under cooked. They give you a huge plate with two items on it and it makes it look like they forgot part of your meal. I've tried everything here. Nothing is good. 

I had the sausage and hash browns. The hash was undercooked (despite asking for it to be crispy). The sausage was cold. Seems they put it onto the griddle frozen and it didn't cook all the way or something. The pancakes alone are okay. The thing about pancakes, waffles and French toast are they are only as good as their syrup. Well the syrup is the cheapest tasting syrup substitute I've ever had. You can taste the sugar/ corn syrup in it. It has no smoky or mapley flavor to it (not even fake flavor). 

Service is fine. Nothing to get excited about. Maybe 3/5 stars. The food is just so horrible that it brought the rating down that much. 
My family and I have decided we will not return unless there are no other options. My warning is just because you had it before doesn't mean it is close to the same.

The coffee is good, the juice is good. I've had eggs, sausage, pancakes, toast, hashbrowns. All good. The poached eggs I had today were particularly good - cooked the perfect amount. My friend once tried the apple pancake which was crazy, and tasted much more like dessert than breakfast. It was delicious, don't get me wrong, but not a breakfast food in my opinion. If you like really sweet stuff though you'll like it.

The service is friendly but sometimes tough to find someone as they tend to be running around.

We ventured here on a Sunday morning when the wait at Hash House A Go Go was 45 min.- an hour. (Never again will I make that mistake- totally worth the wait at Hash House) and walked in to a seemingly unbusy breakfast joint-- ON A SUNDAY MORNING? Seriously, the shittiest places around are busy for weekend breakfast and the dining room here sat mostly empty which should've been my first clue. 

After sitting for several minutes and not being acknowledged by anyone (because apparently, the skanky old waitress helping all the tables around us was not responsible for us) we finally had some has-been waitress mosey on over to take our drink order. We also gave our food order since we'd been there contemplating the menu for a good 15 minutes at this point. 

The breakfast was uneventful. They gave me chewy bacon when I asked for extra crispy. I thought the whole thing was subpar. And to top it off, a $62 bill for 4 of us. You've got to be fucking kidding me... there's nothing worse than bland food, terrible service and a pricey bill to leave a bad taste in your mouth.

The food here is excellent probably one of the best places to dine in Vegas, but as we all know it's about the Service! I've been a loyal customer of this location since it opened a few years back. Every single time that I have EVER dined here since opening I always grab a starbucks coffee and then I will go eat here because I don't like drip coffee. So today was no different than the other 50-60 times I've eaten here except I was denied a table due to the fact that I had my starbucks coffee. Listen, I understand having policies it's a business the issue here is consistency! If you have a policy than you have to stick to it not just simply implement it one random day because you feel like it and not on other days.

The pecan waffles were yummy! The waffle was fluffy and a little bit sweet just how I like it. 

The corned beef hash looked like they opened a can of Libby's and then barely warmed it up in a pan. I have to say Libby's taste much better. It was nothing like the corned beef hash at the California locations.

I definitely will be back just for pancakes and waffles. I might take a chance on other breakfast meats but I would stay away from the corned beef hash.",xA_upwVTOVtXkS0NGISGng,0,0,3,wzJjkC4F2jwxtS6-O0OvUg

We recently came here on a Saturday morning. The first thing I thought when we drove in was ""maybe this was a bad idea."" The parking lot was packed! There were even cars parked on the street. Seriously, is this place THAT good? We walked in and there were many people waiting to get a table. We put our name on the list and they told us the wait would be 15 minutes. Surprisingly, they were right and did a good job cleaning up the tables and getting people seated quickly.

Unfortunately, I wasn't impressed with the food. However, there are 3 good things about this place:

1. The bacon!! Cut thick and cooked very crispy, just the way I like it! Good bacon is important.

2. The coffee. I don't know what it is, but their coffee was great. I prefer a good amount of sugar and some cream, but I did not have to add much of both, and it didn't taste bitter.

3. The sugar. I love the dispensers they use because it makes pouring the sugar very easy, compared to the usual small packets that need to be torn open and can get messy. 

Warning: this place loves onions! 
First, I wanted to order the corned beef hash. I asked our waitress if I could get it without the onions, but she said no because it was premixed. So I just went with the short stack of bacon pancakes. They were a bit dry and the syrup was too watery. Isn't syrup supposed to be on the thicker side? Maybe they were being cheap and diluted it to save money. Ewww. I also ordered the potatoes with cheese as a side, and they had onions in them. Big pieces too! *sigh* My husband ordered the bacon and eggs. I got to try one strip of his bacon, and again, it was so good! Thick, crispy and tasty! In comparison to the thin and floppy ones at other places. Try it, and you will agree that they do bacon right! 

Service was okay for being extremely busy. Honestly, I don't see myself returning, but if I do, I'll just order a coffee and a side of bacon!",FOoN3DJzDUnl4EAQaTJIGg,4,3,3,oFA3EDMMPFOSyYTshvpz9g

I had been dying to try the apple pancake that I had heard many good things about, so I headed to the Original Pancake House. The service was terrible. The server practically forgot my table existed. I had to wait a long time for anyone to even approach the table. When she finally did, I ordered a coffee and the apple pancake. My coffee came out and EW, there was lipstick on the cup. Unfortunately I didn't notice until the waitress had already wandered away from the table and when I was finally able to get her attention again, it took her far too long to return with a fresh cup. 

When my pancake arrived, it was enormous. I looked down to get my fork in preparation of my first bite of apple-y goodness and was appalled to find my fork was dirty. I again had to try to get my waitress' attention to replace my fork, which again took forever.  Finally, I'm ready to eat. The flavor was nothing spectacular and I became bored about three bites in.

I ordered an omelet with spinach & gouda cheese and also the Continental crepes. Omelet was very good, spinach was plentiful and fresh. The cheese was kind of concentrated into one area, could have been spread a little better. The crepes were very good with the tropical syrup, but I had to add the syrup because I only got the tiniest hint of triple sec in the filling. Of course you don't want to overwhelm the dish with triple sec but I only tasted about three drops. The fresh squeezed grapefruit juice was good and quite pulpy, but $5 is a bit pricey. The pancakes that came with the omelet were just pancakes; well made, but just pancakes.
My daughter ordered a corned beef hash with braised (?) eggs on top and, I believe, a Nutella crepe. The hash dish was very good. She did not like the crepe, it was too wet.
