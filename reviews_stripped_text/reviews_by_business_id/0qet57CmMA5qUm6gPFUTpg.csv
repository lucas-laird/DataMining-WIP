Anyways hopefully this place can live up to the OG one. I honestly think this location has a simple classic pizza nothing over the top. They should have gave it more an authentic feel bc everyone is just bashing on something they have no clue about. Di fara in New York is the best period but this on has a lot to live up.

Having gone to the original Di Fara's in Brooklyn, I can't say this was the best pizza as it was nowhere near as comparable as the fresh slice I had made in Brooklyn (I still think the pizza I had there was the best I've ever had). Although this is a small food court version of the original location, I understand that they don't make the pizzas on the spot- instead, they have pre-made pizzas that they will reheat for you. The pizza was still good, especially because we were hungry, but the only part that was similar to the original location was that they used the same pepperoni.

When I checked out of Caesars Palace my flight to Oakland was 3:05 PM. I had already exhausted the $600 dining credit for 3 dinners during my comped 3-night stay at Caesars Palace. I needed something to eat before I headed to the airport. I decided to come here for a quick lunch. I've heard so much about this famous pizzeria in New York. Anthony Bourdain said it's the best pizzeria in New York. However bringing the characteristic and charm of that pizzeria to Las Vegas is tricky. First at the New York location I heard there's only one person cooking the pizza - that suggests quality control. Second at the New York location people wait in long lines in anticipation of a Di Fara Pizza. At Las Vegas the tourists don't have that patience as they want their food fast. The expectations of a New York institution is too hard to fulfill at Las Vegas. Prior to my trip I thought about using the $600 dining credit for room service. One of the eateries on the room service menu is Di Fara Pizza. Because of that I had some expectations.

I ordered two slices: House Pepperoni and New York Cheese. The New York Cheese had a crispy crust. That slice of cheese pizza is unlike any other New York-style cheese pizza I ever had. I can see why a lot of people like Di Fara Pizza a lot if based only on the New York Cheese. The House Pepperoni on the other hand was a disappointment as the crust was soggy. In addition the pepperoni and cheese were dry. The House Pepperoni is the reason why I rated this eatery one star less. I do believe that if I went to the New York location my rating different than the one at Las Vegas. I'm not saying I had a bad lunch, but the expectations that this pizzeria would somewhat be par to the other restaurants I ate was due to that Di Fara Pizza was listed on the room service menu at Caesars Palace. You don't see Starbucks on a room service menu at Caesars Palace. Honestly my rating was due to the fact that I was spoiled for those 3 nights at Caesars Palace when I had 3 comped dinners.",4hVHTZhy70Sw4gmQfk1pJg,12,8,2,EbGLu0qBfhtsSoCUnlhzdw

Not like eating here is a sensible decision though as it's the priciest slice in the city at more than $8 each, a whopping $18 for a 2 slice/drink combo and probably $3 for a fucking napkin.  Is Domenico ""Dom"" De Marco himself tossing the pies back there?

Out of sheer principle, whether it's a party of 1 or 4, the only way to go is with the whole pie (8 slices) at $29.  Hell!  I could have sold the leftover slices to the sorry assed people waiting in the same long line I just did!  We scarfed down five slices between the two of us.  My last mushroom slice was eaten for breakfast a couple of days later and wasn't bad even when sober.
